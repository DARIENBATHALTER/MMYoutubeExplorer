[0.16 - 4.24] hello I'm Anthony William and you're
[2.12 - 6.12] listening to the medical medium radio
[4.24 - 8.96] show where each week I talk about the
[6.12 - 10.76] most advanced healing information and
[8.96 - 13.64] secrets about health much of which is
[10.76 - 15.72] not found anywhere else and is decades
[13.64 - 18.84] ahead of what's out there now as I've
[15.72 - 20.60] always said who has 10 or 20 or even 30
[18.84 - 22.60] years to wait for answers to their
[20.60 - 24.72] illnesses cuz believe me people have
[22.60 - 27.12] been waiting and I've seen it you've
[24.72 - 30.04] seen it you know what I'm talking about
[27.12 - 33.36] and it's no fun it's absolutely no fun
[30.04 - 35.32] and we're talking about gut health today
[33.36 - 36.64] and and the intestinal track and
[35.32 - 38.44] understanding gut health because that's
[36.64 - 40.48] Today's Show and I'll tell you why
[38.44 - 41.80] that's Today's show you know I was
[40.48 - 43.20] actually thinking we were going to do
[41.80 - 45.68] another show and there's so many things
[43.20 - 47.92] in different topics but gut health is
[45.68 - 49.64] serious it's really serious and more and
[47.92 - 51.20] more people I mean I've watched this for
[49.64 - 53.48] decades actually but more and more
[51.20 - 56.32] people now are just saying well you know
[53.48 - 58.76] I can't get my gut better what do I do
[56.32 - 60.64] and there are answers there are answers
[58.76 - 62.72] to fixing problems there are answers to
[60.64 - 65.56] fixing you know everything involved with
[62.72 - 68.48] it constipation bloating gas loose
[65.56 - 72.44] stools poor absorption you know tummy
[68.48 - 73.88] pains strange tummy pains gastritis all
[72.44 - 76.44] these different things we go to the
[73.88 - 78.16] doctor for and we can't get answers and
[76.44 - 80.04] we go to Alternative doctors we can't
[78.16 - 81.44] get answers too we it's well you go to
[80.04 - 84.40] Alternative doctors usually just blamed
[81.44 - 87.04] on candida we can't just do that because
[84.40 - 89.64] a lot of what happens is with gut health
[87.04 - 91.04] is a lot of people they can get better
[89.64 - 94.12] from a little while then it all comes
[91.04 - 97.24] back or they don't get better at all or
[94.12 - 98.48] it gets worse over time or they do get
[97.24 - 99.56] better because they you know there's
[98.48 - 102.04] some people that get better and they
[99.56 - 103.80] removed you know uh gluten out of their
[102.04 - 104.84] diet and they removed a little dairy
[103.80 - 106.40] products out of their diet or they
[104.84 - 108.08] cleaned it up they got rid of pastries
[106.40 - 109.44] cookies and cakes and they did get
[108.08 - 112.52] better but there's a lot of people that
[109.44 - 115.16] don't and they do everything and
[112.52 - 117.84] everything and anything to actually try
[115.16 - 119.88] to get their guts better and look I know
[117.84 - 121.72] how frustrating is so today's show is
[119.88 - 123.96] gut health and we're going to talk about
[121.72 - 126.32] this poor absorption and tummy pains and
[123.96 - 128.80] everything around it and it's just a
[126.32 - 130.84] sign that our guts need attention and so
[128.80 - 133.20] this is serious we're addressing this
[130.84 - 136.00] today because who has 10 or 20 30 years
[133.20 - 138.60] to wait for answers for the illnesses
[136.00 - 140.48] I've said this before I say it again
[138.60 - 141.28] that I've seen people wait a long time
[140.48 - 143.44] for
[141.28 - 144.92] answers and you know when it comes down
[143.44 - 147.24] to gut health the reason why a lot of
[144.92 - 148.96] people don't get better is because the
[147.24 - 152.76] information out there the newest
[148.96 - 156.40] information out there is is has dust on
[152.76 - 158.08] it and it's old it's old information and
[156.40 - 159.56] you know someone was telling me the
[158.08 - 161.64] other day they said you know you got to
[159.56 - 163.72] you think pretty big of yourself Mr
[161.64 - 165.80] medical medium because you're talking
[163.72 - 167.68] about how new information and you're
[165.80 - 169.00] talking about how new books and new
[167.68 - 170.28] things that are coming out about gut
[169.00 - 172.56] health you're talking about how that's
[170.28 - 176.00] old and outdated and I'm like yeah cuz
[172.56 - 178.28] it is it is old and outdated it's not
[176.00 - 179.80] about you know what I believe in what I
[178.28 - 181.88] think what it's about somebody getting
[179.80 - 183.68] better and having the right information
[181.88 - 185.28] so yeah I might come across sounding a
[183.68 - 186.72] little bit arrogant someone said oh you
[185.28 - 188.28] seem like you might be arrogant because
[186.72 - 191.68] you got all the answers that's not it at
[188.28 - 194.84] all spirit's got the answers and I want
[191.68 - 197.76] you to have those answers I want you to
[194.84 - 200.80] have those answers and I want you able
[197.76 - 202.64] to heal and move forward because you can
[200.80 - 204.16] you know and when I look into the latest
[202.64 - 205.64] information it's even out there cuz
[204.16 - 207.28] someone says hey look at this I'm like
[205.64 - 209.36] whoo and I'm all excited and I look at
[207.28 - 212.08] him I'm like look this stuff is ancient
[209.36 - 214.64] history already ancient history before
[212.08 - 217.20] it was even minted you know everything
[214.64 - 219.48] about candida that's that's wrong
[217.20 - 221.72] totally wrong and we're going to cover
[219.48 - 224.20] cover candida a little bit today
[221.72 - 226.80] everything about leaky gut totally wrong
[224.20 - 229.24] I mean there's there's I mean I'm seeing
[226.80 - 232.36] stuff on the scene right now about leaky
[229.24 - 235.88] gut it was 20 years ago and it was wrong
[232.36 - 238.40] 20 years ago it was was misinformation
[235.88 - 241.24] 20 years ago look I have to find this
[238.40 - 243.52] humorous I have to make because it's sad
[241.24 - 245.80] it's sad because that's 20 years of
[243.52 - 247.80] someone not getting the information they
[245.80 - 249.20] need to get their gut better to get
[247.80 - 252.24] their health better because it affects
[249.20 - 254.92] their families it affects their lives it
[252.24 - 257.36] gets in the way of everything and the
[254.92 - 259.52] suffering occurs I have to keep a sense
[257.36 - 261.60] of humor about it because it kills me it
[259.52 - 262.80] kills me to watch it I've watched it in
[261.60 - 264.80] young people I've watched it in
[262.80 - 266.08] teenagers I've watched it in kids I've
[264.80 - 267.68] watched it in older people I've watched
[266.08 - 269.80] people lose their jobs I've watched
[267.68 - 271.36] people suffer I've watched people you
[269.80 - 273.28] know have you know difficult lives they
[271.36 - 275.20] get divorces over it because they can't
[273.28 - 277.12] eat anything the other person can eat
[275.20 - 280.28] and whatnot and it causes problems I've
[277.12 - 282.00] seen it all and so when someone says hey
[280.28 - 285.84] you seem to be pretty arrogant no what
[282.00 - 287.40] it is what it is is is the crap coming
[285.84 - 289.32] out in books and information and
[287.40 - 290.96] literature and everything else in the
[289.32 - 292.88] best sense meaning even including all
[290.96 - 295.84] the alternative about gut health is so
[292.88 - 297.72] way off it's ridiculous and it's not
[295.84 - 300.00] about me being like hey I got all the
[297.72 - 301.92] answers it's about the TR truth it's
[300.00 - 304.04] about what's really happening in the gut
[301.92 - 305.56] it's about what's wrong it's about what
[304.04 - 307.32] spirit says and it's about you getting
[305.56 - 310.00] better cuz and the bottom line is I
[307.32 - 312.44] don't care I don't care whose feelings I
[310.00 - 314.36] heard out there when it comes down to
[312.44 - 315.92] you it's it's about getting you better
[314.36 - 318.80] it's about you having the right
[315.92 - 321.60] information so you know I don't care if
[318.80 - 324.92] a brand new book comes off the running
[321.60 - 326.80] and it's about leaky gut you know and
[324.92 - 329.00] and meanwhile when you look in it and
[326.80 - 331.12] it's literally 20 30 years old
[329.00 - 333.56] information is even the new information
[331.12 - 336.16] and it is wrong right off the press and
[333.56 - 337.80] I'm like oh here we go again here we go
[336.16 - 340.88] again how many people are going to be
[337.80 - 343.20] led down a path for another 10 years oh
[340.88 - 345.04] my God and you know what that's okay
[343.20 - 347.44] that's okay if I didn't have to see the
[345.04 - 349.60] suffering myself that's okay if I didn't
[347.44 - 352.04] have to see it it being real but it's
[349.60 - 354.60] real people are going through hell and
[352.04 - 357.24] back with their guts in testinal tracks
[354.60 - 361.28] no one's clearing the air about it no
[357.24 - 363.00] one is I have to do that I have to do it
[361.28 - 364.84] I need you feeling better you need to
[363.00 - 367.04] know what's going on and we're covering
[364.84 - 370.08] a couple of really cool things something
[367.04 - 373.72] that nobody knows about nobody bottom
[370.08 - 376.24] line okay so that's what today's about
[373.72 - 378.88] check out life-changing Foods okay so we

[383.64 - 388.76] book is packed and I mean packed I mean
[385.84 - 391.08] I I literally I basically thought I was
[388.76 - 394.04] going to stroke out writing that book
[391.08 - 397.04] okay right because I was taking so much
[394.04 - 398.76] data from Spirit so much data and
[397.04 - 400.84] information from Spirit that's never
[398.76 - 403.20] been taught anywhere or learned or
[400.84 - 405.80] anywhere it's not offered anywhere about
[403.20 - 408.52] what over 50 fruits and vegetables what
[405.80 - 410.24] they do do which I call them the holy
[408.52 - 412.16] for these groups of fruits and
[410.24 - 414.80] vegetables wild foods and what they do
[412.16 - 416.60] for people what illnesses what symptoms
[414.80 - 419.12] they take care of so when you really go
[416.60 - 422.32] through this and you pick out the right
[419.12 - 425.52] vac vegetable the right herb the right
[422.32 - 427.56] spice the right wild Food For Your Right
[425.52 - 429.52] condition and you do it in the way you
[427.56 - 431.72] need to do it and it just comes together
[429.52 - 434.12] it's lifechanging I also have a
[431.72 - 436.20] fertility chapter I also have um what
[434.12 - 437.84] not to eat chapter another one of those

[440.44 - 446.48] and you know I I had to get that
[443.68 - 447.80] done I'm laughing because I yeah I went
[446.48 - 449.60] through hell and back with that one but
[447.80 - 452.32] I'm going to tell you right now it's

[466.36 - 470.00] what it takes I'm going to give you any
[467.84 - 472.60] bit of information all the information I
[470.00 - 474.88] can if this is first time you came on um
[472.60 - 478.36] it started all with me at age 4 heard a
[474.88 - 480.88] voice perfectly clear in the ear in real
[478.36 - 482.60] time real time means someone's talking
[480.88 - 484.64] to you in real time it's not being
[482.60 - 486.92] channeled it's not being taken in in
[484.64 - 489.52] other kind of you know ways it's not
[486.92 - 491.16] being like you know Zapped into the
[489.52 - 492.76] Consciousness there's nothing going on
[491.16 - 494.52] like that it's someone talking to me in
[492.76 - 496.56] real time it's a voice I heard since age
[494.52 - 498.00] four that's where the information comes
[496.56 - 499.76] that's how I've helped tens of thousands
[498.00 - 503.16] of people move forward with their lives
[499.76 - 505.12] and have changed their lives and um so
[503.16 - 507.20] um that's how it all really began with
[505.12 - 509.00] me and I dedicated my life into helping
[507.20 - 511.96] people I'm going to make sure you have
[509.00 - 514.56] the information that you need to help
[511.96 - 518.24] your loved ones your friends the people
[514.56 - 521.24] you care for your family members and
[518.24 - 523.56] yourself and that's what matters the
[521.24 - 525.68] most I don't care what else is going on
[523.56 - 527.68] in the world it's about you feeling
[525.68 - 529.72] better so you can live your life you
[527.68 - 531.52] could do the things you need to do you
[529.72 - 533.92] know I've watched it I've seen it I've
[531.52 - 535.08] said this before I got moms telling me
[533.92 - 539.24] they can't
[535.08 - 541.44] believe 20 years later after they birth
[539.24 - 543.64] their child their daughter and their
[541.44 - 546.68] daughter you know is now 20 years old
[543.64 - 549.56] they can't believe 20 years later the
[546.68 - 552.84] daughter their daughter has a diagnosis
[549.56 - 555.72] that they had they have and it's still
[552.84 - 557.84] there's nothing new to fix it nothing
[555.72 - 559.76] new to fix it same chronic fatigue
[557.84 - 563.20] syndrome fibromyalgia Hashim modus
[559.76 - 565.04] thyroiditis all the same nothing new I
[563.20 - 566.72] and you know and and I've had people say
[565.04 - 568.40] look I bought every book out there on
[566.72 - 570.88] Hashimoto's I bought everything and it
[568.40 - 574.04] doesn't even tell you what causes it
[570.88 - 577.72] exactly exactly because there's nothing
[574.04 - 579.72] new out there and it has to change now
[577.72 - 582.56] it has to change and you know and I've
[579.72 - 585.32] had moms they're crying because their
[582.56 - 587.40] 15-year-old daughter is sick with things
[585.32 - 590.28] that she was sick with and and still
[587.40 - 593.76] nothing's done about it and and and it
[590.28 - 595.64] goes on and it goes on and it goes on
[593.76 - 597.64] and you know and and it's hitting young
[595.64 - 602.28] people
[597.64 - 606.04] 177% 17 out of 100 college
[602.28 - 609.12] students go home leave College in the
[606.04 - 611.64] middle of college and don't go back and
[609.12 - 613.44] don't go back it's not because they
[611.64 - 615.80] couldn't do the studies meaning like
[613.44 - 619.32] it's not because they weren't brilliant
[615.80 - 622.60] they left because they were sick 17 out
[619.32 - 625.00] of a 100 you do the math how many
[622.60 - 628.44] thousands of students are going to
[625.00 - 631.48] school every year okay across this
[628.44 - 633.76] country do the math right now 17 out of
[631.48 - 635.80] 100 then do the math what's that out of
[633.76 - 637.48] a th000 what's that out of 10,000

[721.92 - 725.80] interesting is back and I've said this
[724.32 - 728.68] before I'm going to say it again back in
[725.80 - 730.40] the in the80s what happened was when we
[728.68 - 732.84] were at that crossroads where
[730.40 - 734.52] conventional medicine was was just it
[732.84 - 736.12] was just conventional medicine if you
[734.52 - 739.00] were in naturopath you were just
[736.12 - 742.28] completely thought of as just crap total
[739.00 - 744.92] crap if you were an naturopath in 1980
[742.28 - 747.04] okay and this was a really dangerous
[744.92 - 750.00] time dangerous time for naturopaths
[747.04 - 752.16] natural medicine hop you know home paths
[750.00 - 754.76] chiropractors that thought beyond the
[752.16 - 757.84] normal you you name it that was this was
[754.76 - 759.76] a really bad time this was when we were
[757.84 - 761.44] completely divided right now you have
[759.76 - 762.68] clinics where there's conventional
[761.44 - 764.12] doctors you got clinics where there's
[762.68 - 766.44] natural doctors and they're all all
[764.12 - 768.16] working together you even look at some
[766.44 - 770.16] of the most popular clinics now it's
[768.16 - 772.64] like they got they got a nutritionist in
[770.16 - 775.52] there they got a naturopath in there
[772.64 - 777.40] they they got a functional integrated a
[775.52 - 779.44] functional medicine doctor in there and
[777.40 - 781.12] then MDS are flipping over they're like
[779.44 - 782.88] they're not MDS anymore they're MDS and
[781.12 - 785.56] they're functional doctors right this
[782.88 - 787.96] didn't exist back in the 80s it was the
[785.56 - 789.76] Dark Ages and we might still be in the
[787.96 - 791.44] dark ages of misinformation right now
[789.76 - 794.96] but we're not in the dark ages of where
[791.44 - 797.84] we were as far as collaborating and back
[794.96 - 799.44] then I mean it was like it was insane it
[797.84 - 800.72] was you went to the doctor you you were
[799.44 - 802.08] told it was all in your head so if you
[800.72 - 804.04] were a woman you went to the doctor you
[802.08 - 806.64] told you were insane you told you were
[804.04 - 809.12] lazy you're told you were crazy your
[806.64 - 811.20] blood work checked out fine antiquated
[809.12 - 814.96] antique blood work which we still use
[811.20 - 817.04] now you told you were fine and that's it
[814.96 - 819.44] you get you get sent home that was the
[817.04 - 822.12] 80s okay and but what happened was it
[819.44 - 824.20] was happening in such a degree and so so
[822.12 - 826.08] so much of that was happening the
[824.20 - 827.76] naturopaths came on the scene I mean
[826.08 - 829.52] they were always around but they were
[827.76 - 831.36] really starting to come in and file out
[829.52 - 833.96] of schools there was an explosion in
[831.36 - 836.08] the80s and they they're filing you know
[833.96 - 839.04] they're filing out where each state had
[836.08 - 841.28] a few met naturopaths now which was
[839.04 - 843.56] which was which was unbelievable in some
[841.28 - 845.36] states in the US think about it okay and
[843.56 - 847.20] you know the first the first naturopath
[845.36 - 849.28] in California which I actually know
[847.20 - 850.92] personally the first first natural path
[849.28 - 854.64] in California you know coming out in the
[850.92 - 856.12] late 70s early 80s and California where
[854.64 - 857.52] you know isn't that where everything
[856.12 - 859.68] happens first
[857.52 - 861.76] supposingly right and so the first you
[859.68 - 864.84] know naturopath came out but what
[861.76 - 866.48] happened was you know naturopaths and
[864.84 - 868.16] natural medicine need some needed
[866.48 - 870.48] something to hold on to something to
[868.16 - 872.28] bite their teeth into because what was
[870.48 - 874.72] happening is there was a flood of people
[872.28 - 876.72] flood of women like I'm sick I'm sick
[874.72 - 878.52] you know uh uh you know I went went to
[876.72 - 880.28] 10 conventional doctors no answers that
[878.52 - 881.68] still happens today went to 20
[880.28 - 883.80] conventional doctors still still no
[881.68 - 885.08] answers that still happens today though
[883.80 - 887.76] and what happened was the candida
[885.08 - 889.64] diagnosis was born it exploded it was an
[887.76 - 891.80] amazing diagnosis because it was like
[889.64 - 894.60] whoa you got some you got candida you
[891.80 - 896.72] got candida overgrowth in your gut
[894.60 - 899.12] that's what's going on here and what it
[896.72 - 901.32] did was it was like it was like uh an
[899.12 - 904.40] Awakening it was like Angels came out of
[901.32 - 907.20] the sky and like the heavens parted and
[904.40 - 909.08] it was like and Jesus just baby Jesus
[907.20 - 912.48] came down I mean it was like that kind
[909.08 - 914.84] of moment that was the kind of moment
[912.48 - 918.76] where you know hey there is something
[914.84 - 921.08] wrong with me and but it wasn't really
[918.76 - 923.68] candida in the end that's why we've gone
[921.08 - 925.08] from candida to today right now we're
[923.68 - 928.92] going to
[925.08 - 932.24] sibo sibo small intestinal bacteria over
[928.92 - 935.12] sibo we're going into that land now you
[932.24 - 937.00] know and that was the land that 30 years
[935.12 - 939.80] ago when spirit said hey it's not
[937.00 - 941.28] candida Spirit knew it was overgrowth of
[939.80 - 944.36] different forms of bacteria and it
[941.28 - 947.76] wasn't candida see Spirit was ahead of
[944.36 - 950.52] its time 30 years so I've been able to
[947.76 - 952.36] help people for 30 years who didn't have
[950.52 - 954.88] to go through the candida ride which is
[952.36 - 957.52] kill your candida kill your candida this
[954.88 - 959.40] you know what I mean the whole bit so
[957.52 - 961.12] and even sios miss misunderstood right
[959.40 - 962.40] now because sio is still a
[961.12 - 965.32] misunderstanding of what kind of
[962.40 - 966.92] bacteria is in the gut that's causing
[965.32 - 968.80] that over what oh what is the
[966.92 - 971.44] proliferation of bacteria well it's
[968.80 - 974.32] mostly strepa cacus and it's it's it's
[971.44 - 977.24] antibiotic resistant strep sibo is a
[974.32 - 978.68] development of strep that's been in
[977.24 - 980.24] someone's system and they've taken
[978.68 - 981.96] antibiotics through childhood or any
[980.24 - 983.88] other time in their life and they fed
[981.96 - 986.36] the strep strep got stronger then it
[983.88 - 987.76] overgrew later and when you get older
[986.36 - 989.08] and your immune system starts breaking
[987.76 - 990.76] down you're not taking care of yourself
[989.08 - 992.32] and you're stressed out the strep grows
[990.76 - 994.00] even more proliferates even more and
[992.32 - 996.64] that's what sibo is nobody even knows
[994.00 - 999.88] that yet so I'm giving you Advanced
[996.64 - 1003.08] information right there all on its own
[999.88 - 1004.56] so you know the bottom line is this is
[1003.08 - 1005.76] we're going to cover a few good things
[1004.56 - 1007.52] we're going to talk about leaky gut
[1005.76 - 1009.44] let's start with leaky gut okay we're
[1007.52 - 1011.60] just going to have to do that someone
[1009.44 - 1014.32] says you have leaky gut chances are you
[1011.60 - 1016.00] don't have leaky gut leaky gut if you
[1014.32 - 1018.44] had leaky gut you'd be in the in the
[1016.00 - 1021.08] hospital with 105 temperature which
[1018.44 - 1022.80] accept this and dying so you don't have
[1021.08 - 1023.84] leaky gut you have to understand that
[1022.80 - 1025.68] something went wrong with the whole
[1023.84 - 1027.88] leaky gut Concept in fact there's even
[1025.68 - 1030.84] new new information new books out now
[1027.88 - 1032.48] talking about leaky gut totally totally
[1030.84 - 1034.00] Antiquated
[1032.48 - 1035.76] information
[1034.00 - 1038.00] unbelievable yeah I mean it's been
[1035.76 - 1041.96] superseded it's it it's just
[1038.00 - 1043.76] unbelievable and so leaky gut isn't just
[1041.96 - 1045.96] this this whole thing where you got you
[1043.76 - 1048.60] got this permeability happening where
[1045.96 - 1051.48] where all this debris and stuff is going
[1048.60 - 1053.12] through the intestinal lining and gases
[1051.48 - 1056.16] are going through the intestinal lining
[1053.12 - 1058.24] that's not really what it is first of
[1056.16 - 1060.44] first of all if you had diverticulitis
[1058.24 - 1063.72] diverticulosis and it got even to the
[1060.44 - 1066.68] point where something escaped to the
[1063.72 - 1069.52] other side we're talking 104 temperature
[1066.68 - 1072.00] we're talking emergency
[1069.52 - 1073.80] crisis so not even people that have
[1072.00 - 1075.96] eruptions in their colon where they have
[1073.80 - 1078.00] Diverticulitis and eruptions have leaky
[1075.96 - 1079.00] gut it would have to go even past that
[1078.00 - 1081.36] situation
[1079.00 - 1083.20] ation see that's that's how it works
[1081.36 - 1085.68] this is where it's so misinformed on
[1083.20 - 1087.88] leaky gut I I I don't mean to be a pain
[1085.68 - 1090.16] in the butt about at all I don't it's
[1087.88 - 1091.72] just that what am I supposed to do just
[1090.16 - 1093.60] go along with it and not give you guys
[1091.72 - 1098.80] the right information to heal I I don't
[1093.60 - 1100.96] get it so it's so the deal is look so if
[1098.80 - 1102.96] you've been diagnosed with leaky gut
[1100.96 - 1105.16] that chances are you don't have leaky
[1102.96 - 1107.12] gut it's not what's happening do you
[1105.16 - 1109.80] have problems in your intestinal tract
[1107.12 - 1111.24] yeah you definitely could have problems
[1109.80 - 1112.76] a lot of people don't have any problems
[1111.24 - 1114.20] in their intestinal tract and they they
[1112.76 - 1115.80] feel sick they got fatigue they got
[1114.20 - 1117.88] Epstein bar they got shingles they got
[1115.80 - 1119.56] other problems they got you know other
[1117.88 - 1121.48] stuff going on and it's still blamed on
[1119.56 - 1123.52] leaky gut cuz you know it's it's that
[1121.48 - 1124.64] kind of thing you know so you go to a
[1123.52 - 1126.48] gut health doctor you're going to get
[1124.64 - 1127.80] leaky gut diagnosis go to Lyme doctor
[1126.48 - 1130.20] you're going to get a lime do you know
[1127.80 - 1131.80] diagnosis go to Multiple Sclerosis
[1130.20 - 1134.40] doctor you're going to get an MS do you
[1131.80 - 1138.68] know diagnosis I mean have I said enough
[1134.40 - 1141.68] does it go on and on and on so so um the
[1138.68 - 1144.72] deal is with leaky gut that's not what's
[1141.68 - 1148.32] happening what does happen though is our
[1144.72 - 1151.20] liver okay produces less bile due to
[1148.32 - 1152.88] stress due to Foods we're eating okay
[1151.20 - 1155.68] especially if we're eating lots of high
[1152.88 - 1158.04] fat densed foods or we're eating foods
[1155.68 - 1159.56] that have lots of fat and sugar combined
[1158.04 - 1162.40] like like a chocolate cake which has
[1159.56 - 1164.72] tons of lard and then it has you know
[1162.40 - 1167.40] some some it say tons of lard and then
[1164.72 - 1170.48] has table sugar involved or corn syrup
[1167.40 - 1173.48] involved but whatever it is that we're
[1170.48 - 1174.84] eating over time it breaks down the it
[1173.48 - 1177.00] breaks down the liver it gets the liver
[1174.84 - 1179.28] to become more fatty more pre fatty and
[1177.00 - 1181.84] it's usually due to real high intensity
[1179.28 - 1185.52] of fats in in our diet for too many
[1181.84 - 1187.40] years so our liver breaks down
[1185.52 - 1190.44] bioproduction
[1187.40 - 1193.88] minimizes okay so so that minimizes
[1190.44 - 1195.64] hydrochloric acid minimizes hydrochloric
[1193.88 - 1197.40] acid is a blend of seven acids
[1195.64 - 1199.96] undiscovered by science today you want
[1197.40 - 1202.08] to know you want to know the future I'm
[1199.96 - 1205.36] going to tell you some of the future to
[1202.08 - 1208.80] begin with like I said hydrochloric acid
[1205.36 - 1211.04] isn't one acid that's not one acid in
[1208.80 - 1213.00] the stomach it's a blend of seven they
[1211.04 - 1215.32] just have not been able to single it out
[1213.00 - 1218.08] yet and figure it out and like I've said
[1215.32 - 1220.04] before we don't know what happens to
[1218.08 - 1221.76] food when it drops into the stomach yeah
[1220.04 - 1223.88] there's absorption yeah there's
[1221.76 - 1225.76] digestion there's a simulation let me
[1223.88 - 1227.28] tell you something God only knows what
[1225.76 - 1229.32] happens the minute food enters that
[1227.28 - 1231.08] stomach I promise see that that's a
[1229.32 - 1234.72] thousand years from now we're going to
[1231.08 - 1237.72] know exactly how everything works but
[1234.72 - 1239.60] the bottom line is um the bile gets you
[1237.72 - 1242.52] know less production of bile from the
[1239.60 - 1246.80] liver liver gets pre- fatty liver as
[1242.52 - 1249.08] time goes on okay and as all this is
[1246.80 - 1252.92] happening your hydrochloric acid breaks
[1249.08 - 1256.44] down so you get low HCL so that's
[1252.92 - 1259.48] breaking down when that's breaking down
[1256.44 - 1262.24] then um food doesn't digest well and it
[1259.48 - 1264.52] starts to rot and it gets down into the
[1262.24 - 1266.92] intestinal tract and it starts to rot
[1264.52 - 1271.36] when it starts to rot it produces
[1266.92 - 1274.52] ammonia ammonia ammonia is a is
[1271.36 - 1275.96] basically an agent that can move through
[1274.52 - 1279.28] any part of the
[1275.96 - 1281.72] body it can move through muscle so it
[1279.28 - 1283.56] has nothing to do with leaky gut it can
[1281.72 - 1287.20] move through
[1283.56 - 1289.92] organs ammonia can move through an organ
[1287.20 - 1291.72] like a ghost moves through a house and
[1289.92 - 1297.00] goes through the
[1291.72 - 1299.44] wall okay you can have a perfectly sound
[1297.00 - 1302.44] amazing intestinal
[1299.44 - 1307.52] lining that doesn't have one callus on
[1302.44 - 1310.08] it not one pup not one callus not one
[1307.52 - 1313.92] hole from a bacterial infection from 30
[1310.08 - 1316.64] years ago not one anything wrong with it
[1313.92 - 1319.40] and ammonia will move through your
[1316.64 - 1322.20] intestinal track just like a ghost moves
[1319.40 - 1323.84] through a wall if you believe in ghosts
[1322.20 - 1325.56] of course you know some somebody out
[1323.84 - 1327.52] there might not believe in ghosts so I
[1325.56 - 1328.96] don't want to you know insult anybody or
[1327.52 - 1332.36] whatever I'm just
[1328.96 - 1335.36] saying and and so it's the same kind of
[1332.36 - 1337.60] thing that occurs so it and it moves
[1335.36 - 1338.76] through organs that ammonia it moves
[1337.60 - 1342.00] through
[1338.76 - 1345.12] muscle it there's nothing that stops IT
[1342.00 - 1348.56] from going right through the human
[1345.12 - 1350.20] body and then out of the human body
[1348.56 - 1351.88] ammonia just comes right through the
[1350.20 - 1354.80] skin the skin doesn't even stop it it
[1351.88 - 1356.44] just leaks right out of the skin has
[1354.80 - 1359.40] nothing to do with leaky gut on any
[1356.44 - 1361.64] level on any level it's called ammonia
[1359.40 - 1363.76] permeability ammonia permability is a
[1361.64 - 1367.24] word that's in my book that Spirit came
[1363.76 - 1369.24] up with for me to teach people so it's
[1367.24 - 1371.24] our word over here and it's called
[1369.24 - 1374.24] ammonia permeability and it's from
[1371.24 - 1376.96] ammonia leaking through the entire
[1374.24 - 1379.68] body and and that's just the bottom line
[1376.96 - 1381.92] that's how it works so that's that's
[1379.68 - 1384.84] what occurs now that's not leaky gut on
[1381.92 - 1387.08] any level on any way because this
[1384.84 - 1388.12] doesn't mean you're going to feel sick
[1387.08 - 1390.76] ammonia
[1388.12 - 1392.32] permeability doesn't make you tired
[1390.76 - 1396.40] doesn't make you
[1392.32 - 1398.28] sick and it doesn't hurt you it's other
[1396.40 - 1400.96] things that happen in the gut that have
[1398.28 - 1404.28] nothing to do with candida or leaky gut
[1400.96 - 1406.04] that end up hurting you it's that break
[1404.28 - 1408.32] it's that breakdown of the liver meaning
[1406.04 - 1409.92] the liver being stagnant sluggish it's
[1408.32 - 1412.52] food not breaking
[1409.92 - 1416.12] down okay it's food not breaking down
[1412.52 - 1419.80] and rotting and then starting to feed
[1416.12 - 1423.44] STP starting to feed eoli starting to
[1419.80 - 1425.32] feed seiff starting to feed Mera I mean
[1423.44 - 1426.64] we get exposed to all this stuff you
[1425.32 - 1429.00] know you just visit a friend in a
[1426.64 - 1431.76] hospital and and you know I mean
[1429.00 - 1436.36] anything's possible it's like one two
[1431.76 - 1437.96] three just like that and so that's what
[1436.36 - 1440.96] happens is food just starts to feed
[1437.96 - 1442.76] things now if the food is not good food
[1440.96 - 1445.72] like it's food that I tell people to
[1442.76 - 1449.56] avoid like eggs then it feeds something
[1445.72 - 1452.00] worse feeds viruses such as like Epstein
[1449.56 - 1454.60] bar shingles colitis is caused by the
[1452.00 - 1456.36] shingles that's the shingles virus on
[1454.60 - 1459.16] the inside of the lining of the the
[1456.36 - 1461.36] intestinal tract causing colitis and it
[1459.16 - 1462.84] feeds off of eggs it feeds off of dairy
[1461.36 - 1463.84] products it feeds off of gluten one
[1462.84 - 1466.36] thing you're going to get out of the
[1463.84 - 1469.20] show is you're not going to get like oh
[1466.36 - 1471.68] yeah like you know anti-inflam Foods um
[1469.20 - 1473.32] you know autoimmune Foods yeah just stay
[1471.68 - 1474.88] away from the gluten stay away from this
[1473.32 - 1476.16] mot toxins and this and that you're
[1474.88 - 1478.12] going to get you're going to get
[1476.16 - 1479.52] information about what foods feeding
[1478.12 - 1480.64] what causing what illness and what
[1479.52 - 1481.68] disease that's what you're going to get
[1480.64 - 1483.88] you're not going to get that anywhere
[1481.68 - 1487.64] else unless they're listening to this
[1483.88 - 1490.48] show and and and adopting it so the the
[1487.64 - 1491.84] eggs will feed the shingles virus in the
[1490.48 - 1494.00] intestinal tract you won't hear that
[1491.84 - 1495.80] anybody anywhere else it'll feed the in
[1494.00 - 1498.28] the shingles and intestinal tract cause
[1495.80 - 1501.16] an inflammation and eruption of blood
[1498.28 - 1503.16] vessels that's what's happening there so
[1501.16 - 1504.72] it's it's other things that are you know
[1503.16 - 1507.52] worse mean when you have when you have
[1504.72 - 1510.08] viruses inside of us certain bacteria
[1507.52 - 1511.84] inside of us never mind candida candida
[1510.08 - 1514.24] is there to try to protect you it sits
[1511.84 - 1517.84] there did you know this that without
[1514.24 - 1519.60] candida we die how about that one
[1517.84 - 1522.08] without having candida in our system we
[1519.60 - 1523.88] actually die that's what happens an
[1522.08 - 1526.36] overgrowth of candida is because it's
[1523.88 - 1528.80] protecting you candida is literally
[1526.36 - 1531.92] trying to absorb
[1528.80 - 1534.88] absorb and eat stuff and eat food and
[1531.92 - 1537.32] debris to take it away from something
[1534.88 - 1539.68] worse in the body candida is trying to
[1537.32 - 1542.00] save your life by gobbling up whatever
[1539.68 - 1543.44] it can it gobble up that chocolate cake
[1542.00 - 1545.00] because it does candida doesn't want
[1543.44 - 1547.48] that chocolate cake getting to Coline
[1545.00 - 1550.32] strepa cacus getting to you know getting
[1547.48 - 1555.64] to the shingles getting to over 60 VAR
[1550.32 - 1560.04] of Zep bar hhb6 hhb1 hhv1 hhb2 I could
[1555.64 - 1562.72] go on and on forever cyeg CMV and so
[1560.04 - 1564.80] what happens is that candida is sitting
[1562.72 - 1567.92] there protecting your life that's what
[1564.80 - 1569.96] it does that's not even the issue so
[1567.92 - 1572.44] these are such critical pieces of
[1569.96 - 1575.08] information I forgot to tell you put on
[1572.44 - 1576.60] your seat belts I forgot to tell you
[1575.08 - 1580.36] guys you got to guys got to fasten your
[1576.60 - 1582.96] seat belts so I'll even put mine on
[1580.36 - 1585.20] okay right so we'll get the seat belts
[1582.96 - 1587.04] on so anyway we got other things that's
[1585.20 - 1588.52] a leaky gut confusion I'm talking about
[1587.04 - 1591.20] Hydrochloric acid we we have
[1588.52 - 1593.80] hydrochloric acid problems where they
[1591.20 - 1595.48] break down the seven aets that are that
[1593.80 - 1598.44] are just considered one because science
[1595.48 - 1599.96] hasn't funded got the funds or or got to
[1598.44 - 1601.64] the point of Medical Research Medical
[1599.96 - 1603.60] Science to figure out the seven
[1601.64 - 1605.64] different assets that are the blend in
[1603.60 - 1607.84] there I'm going tell you one other thing
[1605.64 - 1612.44] too the scien is not know we're born
[1607.84 - 1614.04] with this like type of hair microscopic
[1612.44 - 1615.92] furry hair on the inside of her
[1614.04 - 1618.48] intestinal tracts and the inside of her
[1615.92 - 1620.64] guts they're to Heart Harper good
[1618.48 - 1621.64] bacteria like elevated biotics like
[1620.64 - 1624.64] we're going to talk about in a little
[1621.64 - 1628.36] while they're there to hold all the good
[1624.64 - 1630.96] bacteria so that bad bacteria can't get
[1628.36 - 1633.64] into Spate Linings and start creating
[1630.96 - 1636.84] Diverticulitis and so forth and
[1633.64 - 1639.68] everything but the problem is we lose
[1636.84 - 1641.56] this hair really fast years ago hundreds
[1639.68 - 1643.64] of years ago we didn't lose it fast it
[1641.56 - 1646.32] stayed with us now because of
[1643.64 - 1648.12] antibiotics it just burns right off of
[1646.32 - 1651.36] the inside of the intestin track and
[1648.12 - 1653.72] colon I mean kids are given antibiotics
[1651.36 - 1655.72] with their first deer infection instead
[1653.72 - 1657.92] of other things being figured out and
[1655.72 - 1660.52] you know it just starts right from the
[1657.92 - 1663.68] beginning lots of antibiotics it just
[1660.52 - 1666.68] wipes out this intestinal tract lining
[1663.68 - 1668.40] this this microscopic fur that's on the
[1666.68 - 1670.00] lining of the intestinal tracts and by
[1668.40 - 1671.80] the time we get into our teenager Years
[1670.00 - 1673.40] and we're eating you know we're eating
[1671.80 - 1675.80] all the fun stuff like Twinkies and
[1673.40 - 1677.40] everything else and you name it and it
[1675.80 - 1679.48] just between that and antibiotics it
[1677.40 - 1681.44] just just wipes right out and now we
[1679.48 - 1683.32] just basically have a bare colon and
[1681.44 - 1685.56] bare intestinal
[1683.32 - 1687.68] tract and that you know and that
[1685.56 - 1689.88] information you can you can only find
[1687.68 - 1691.36] here the problem is with that you get
[1689.88 - 1692.72] calluses and then you got all these
[1691.36 - 1694.60] other bacteria then you get more
[1692.72 - 1696.68] antibiotics and then you get more
[1694.60 - 1698.60] problems and you know then you're eating
[1696.68 - 1700.32] poorly the liver breaks down you're
[1698.60 - 1702.24] gaining weight all kinds of problems are
[1700.32 - 1704.92] happening and this is what goes
[1702.24 - 1707.44] wrong gastritis is
[1704.92 - 1709.20] bacterial so when someone has gastritis
[1707.44 - 1711.92] so they have a lot of gas that's not
[1709.20 - 1714.96] fungus that's not yeast that's not
[1711.92 - 1718.24] candida that's bacteria that's bacteria
[1714.96 - 1720.04] overgrowth that's what that is um and so
[1718.24 - 1724.20] that's what gastritis is so it's another
[1720.04 - 1727.60] thing to understand so inflammation in
[1724.20 - 1731.12] the intestinal tract inflammation like
[1727.60 - 1733.40] IBS in irritable vowel syndrome okay
[1731.12 - 1735.00] that's that's that's a another great one
[1733.40 - 1736.64] because you know I talk about I laugh
[1735.00 - 1738.72] about that it's like oh you got IBS well
[1736.64 - 1741.44] what's IBS
[1738.72 - 1743.04] you know and and so yeah we the whole
[1741.44 - 1744.76] thing with that is inflammation is
[1743.04 - 1747.80] caused by a lot of things it's caused
[1744.76 - 1749.72] mostly by bacteria a breakdown of like I
[1747.80 - 1752.84] said the liver the hydrochloric acid
[1749.72 - 1755.00] food not breaking down okay and and it
[1752.84 - 1757.36] rotting in the intestinal tract feeding
[1755.00 - 1759.20] different types of bacteria we also pick
[1757.36 - 1761.12] up a lot of different kinds of bacteria
[1759.20 - 1763.68] chronically or constantly we're eating
[1761.12 - 1765.12] in restaurants we get it everywhere so
[1763.68 - 1769.32] we have to be careful in how we're
[1765.12 - 1770.80] eating um you know a restaurant you know
[1769.32 - 1773.08] I try to eat as many fresh fruits and
[1770.80 - 1775.48] vegetables as I can you know that's what
[1773.08 - 1777.48] I that's what I like to do because I got
[1775.48 - 1780.00] spirit in my ear telling me that you
[1777.48 - 1781.76] know we we we're only here so long you
[1780.00 - 1784.04] got to get as many meals as you can in
[1781.76 - 1786.40] you that are good and spirit's always
[1784.04 - 1788.32] pushing me to do the fresh fruits fresh
[1786.40 - 1791.20] vegetables that's what I'm always being
[1788.32 - 1794.76] pushed to do uh but when I'm at a
[1791.20 - 1798.48] restaurant you know what I do is I order
[1794.76 - 1801.04] cooked food that comes really hot like
[1798.48 - 1803.28] like hot F you know fresh fruits and
[1801.04 - 1806.56] vegetables that became hot like hot
[1803.28 - 1808.00] vegetables that's what I order because
[1806.56 - 1810.08] you know I don't want to get any
[1808.00 - 1812.16] contamination I don't want to get
[1810.08 - 1814.00] cross-contamination from you know
[1812.16 - 1815.84] somebody at the sink in the kitchen so
[1814.00 - 1818.00] I'm careful because you can pick up a
[1815.84 - 1820.44] whole multiple different varieties of
[1818.00 - 1821.88] bacteria in your journey of eating out
[1820.44 - 1823.56] and doing things I'm not trying to put
[1821.88 - 1826.04] fear in you but make sure you're kind of
[1823.56 - 1828.28] cautious make sure your food comes hot
[1826.04 - 1830.48] that matters
[1828.28 - 1832.36] um it matters greatly a lot of people
[1830.48 - 1834.48] have a whole bunch of low levels of food
[1832.36 - 1837.04] poisoning in their system all through
[1834.48 - 1838.32] their life it builds up it reeks Havoc
[1837.04 - 1840.32] it breaks down a lining of the
[1838.32 - 1842.44] intestinal tract and so forth they have
[1840.32 - 1843.84] antibiotics in and out of it all we get
[1842.44 - 1846.52] a lot of gut
[1843.84 - 1848.80] damage and this is what occurs creates a
[1846.52 - 1850.28] lot of inflammation different pathogens
[1848.80 - 1851.88] creates different inflammation we have
[1850.28 - 1854.68] viruses in the intestinal tract causes
[1851.88 - 1856.84] different inflammation and then then
[1854.68 - 1859.64] there's things like gin bar uh inflaming
[1856.84 - 1861.76] the SP spleen and liver and then causing
[1859.64 - 1864.20] digestive trouble because your liver is
[1861.76 - 1866.56] inflamed your spleen inflamed because
[1864.20 - 1868.40] you have a little bit of epine bar and
[1866.56 - 1871.04] so then it gets confused and we think
[1868.40 - 1872.88] that's our intestinal track another
[1871.04 - 1875.40] thing is there's viruses like the
[1872.88 - 1876.80] shingles that make the nerve sensitive
[1875.40 - 1878.60] makes all the nerves in the body
[1876.80 - 1880.92] sensitive so here's something here's a
[1878.60 - 1882.64] nugget right here that's so important
[1880.92 - 1883.96] there's people out there that think they
[1882.64 - 1886.08] can't digest
[1883.96 - 1888.52] anything they think they can't digest
[1886.08 - 1890.80] any food but that's not accurate that's
[1888.52 - 1894.52] not true it's just that they're feeling
[1890.80 - 1896.48] the food move through them are you one
[1894.52 - 1898.52] of those people because you feel the
[1896.48 - 1901.72] food moving through you because all your
[1898.52 - 1903.76] nerve endings all your neurological all
[1901.72 - 1905.88] the nervous central nervous system the
[1903.76 - 1908.88] vagus nerve the frenic nerves they're
[1905.88 - 1910.72] wired to your colon your dadum your
[1908.88 - 1913.64] intestinal tract so your whole your
[1910.72 - 1915.48] stomach all that has nerves going to it
[1913.64 - 1918.20] all these hot nerves and if you've been
[1915.48 - 1920.52] viral different varieties of Epstein bar
[1918.20 - 1923.24] you've been viral with with different
[1920.52 - 1926.40] varieties of shingles if you a sensitive
[1923.24 - 1928.36] person from a lot of heavy metals from
[1926.40 - 1930.08] um from your nervous system being
[1928.36 - 1932.88] sensitive because of a lot of heavy
[1930.08 - 1936.84] metals toxic heavy metals what's going
[1932.88 - 1938.84] to happen is when you eat your the food
[1936.84 - 1940.64] is going to rub the lining of your
[1938.84 - 1943.60] intestinal tract and colon as
[1940.64 - 1946.64] peristaltic action is happening and when
[1943.60 - 1949.00] that happens you guys you're going to
[1946.64 - 1951.32] feel like oh I just I'm not digesting
[1949.00 - 1954.04] this I don't know what I'm eating that's
[1951.32 - 1955.32] you know feeling good and then what's
[1954.04 - 1957.56] going to happen is you're going to stay
[1955.32 - 1961.28] away from a salad you're going to stay
[1957.56 - 1963.64] away from something like that that rubs
[1961.28 - 1964.60] along the sides you're going to stay
[1963.64 - 1966.40] away from that and then you're just
[1964.60 - 1969.40] going to have like oh the only thing I
[1966.40 - 1971.84] can have is an egg an egg seems to work
[1969.40 - 1974.88] I don't feel any pain when I eat an egg
[1971.84 - 1977.24] meanwhile the egg is feeding more
[1974.88 - 1980.16] inflammation and more nerve problems and
[1977.24 - 1981.44] more issues but yet it feels good going
[1980.16 - 1982.56] down I had people telling me that
[1981.44 - 1984.08] they'll be like well you know the only
[1982.56 - 1985.96] thing I could eat is an egg the reason
[1984.08 - 1988.08] why is the egg turns into a liquid like
[1985.96 - 1990.32] a liquid glue that just sits in the
[1988.08 - 1993.04] middle it doesn't rub the intestinal
[1990.32 - 1995.16] walls or the Linings it doesn't rub the
[1993.04 - 1997.36] sides so you don't feel it but if you
[1995.16 - 1999.68] eat some butterleaf lettuce or you eat a
[1997.36 - 2002.64] Roma piece of lettuce or you eat an
[1999.68 - 2004.84] apple that pecon that that stuff is
[2002.64 - 2007.04] going to go and and start doing some
[2004.84 - 2008.88] healing and it's going to rub the lining
[2007.04 - 2010.88] of the intestinal tract it's going to
[2008.88 - 2012.60] rub the lining of the stomach it's going
[2010.88 - 2014.00] to rub everything and if you have
[2012.60 - 2015.72] sensitive nervous system you're going to
[2014.00 - 2017.76] be like oh I didn't digest this oh I
[2015.72 - 2021.16] can't digest this that's how confusing
[2017.76 - 2023.48] it is so if you're pushed into a corner
[2021.16 - 2027.16] where you feel like you can only eat
[2023.48 - 2028.64] like a piece of cheese and an egg or all
[2027.16 - 2030.56] you can eat is just this one piece of
[2028.64 - 2032.20] chicken and you're one of those people
[2030.56 - 2035.00] that I feel bad when you get pushed into
[2032.20 - 2037.48] that try to try to break out of that box
[2035.00 - 2040.28] have a little bit of avocado you know it
[2037.48 - 2042.36] it will rub a little bit as it goes down
[2040.28 - 2043.96] because it's got fiber in it and Pulp
[2042.36 - 2046.28] but it's not going to it's not going to
[2043.96 - 2048.56] you know rub all so much where it's it's
[2046.28 - 2051.88] getting you upset try to do a little bit
[2048.56 - 2053.52] of some you know some boiled potato and
[2051.88 - 2055.16] try to get that in there you there's
[2053.52 - 2057.96] different things you can do some sweet
[2055.16 - 2060.16] potato some butternut squash um you can
[2057.96 - 2062.52] try different things that won't be so
[2060.16 - 2064.80] you know they won't rub as they go down
[2062.52 - 2067.08] to try to graduate you out of that
[2064.80 - 2070.64] sensitive nervous systems are a big part
[2067.08 - 2072.36] of our digestive like cry out our
[2070.64 - 2075.08] digestive pain and suffering that a lot
[2072.36 - 2076.96] of people have it's nerve sensitivities
[2075.08 - 2079.84] it's vagus nerve sensitivities going
[2076.96 - 2081.76] right to the intestinal tract it's
[2079.84 - 2085.04] frenic nerve sensitivities going right
[2081.76 - 2087.60] into the intestinal tract so much of
[2085.04 - 2089.72] this is these nerve sensitive
[2087.60 - 2091.68] sensitivities from being viral
[2089.72 - 2094.72] neurological symptoms for being vibral
[2091.68 - 2097.00] when someone someone has
[2094.72 - 2098.44] fibromyalgia even they they with what
[2097.00 - 2100.08] they don't know so if you have
[2098.44 - 2103.72] fibromyalgia what you don't know if you
[2100.08 - 2105.48] have a bad case of it the nerves are not
[2103.72 - 2107.04] just in other parts of the joints or
[2105.48 - 2109.80] other parts of your shoulders or your
[2107.04 - 2112.16] arms these nerves they hurt in the
[2109.80 - 2114.24] intestinal tract so when you eat you're
[2112.16 - 2115.92] like I don't know what to eat I ate that
[2114.24 - 2118.04] it doesn't feel good I had a date it
[2115.92 - 2120.72] doesn't feel good I had this but I can
[2118.04 - 2123.76] eat an egg and that feels
[2120.72 - 2126.64] good so it's it's important to know and
[2123.76 - 2128.36] fibro caused by Epstein bar of course um
[2126.64 - 2131.28] my brought that to the world's attention
[2128.36 - 2133.28] quite a while ago and and uh and it's
[2131.28 - 2137.92] getting around so finally people are
[2133.28 - 2139.76] learning um so look back to candida if
[2137.92 - 2142.16] if you were diagnosed with candida don't
[2139.76 - 2145.88] go hog while crazy trying to kill your
[2142.16 - 2147.84] candida whatever you do instead take
[2145.88 - 2150.00] Foods away from whatever bacteria is
[2147.84 - 2152.12] causing your real inflammation that's
[2150.00 - 2154.08] another thing too take Foods away take
[2152.12 - 2155.88] the dairy take the eggs out take all the
[2154.08 - 2157.48] gluten out I'm sure you've taken grains
[2155.88 - 2159.72] out we're going to going to do a show
[2157.48 - 2162.32] just on grains though we're going to do
[2159.72 - 2164.32] a show just on grains that one will come
[2162.32 - 2166.64] up you guys got to hear that one it's
[2164.32 - 2169.24] really cool cuz I'm not against all
[2166.64 - 2170.48] grains so um but when you're dealing
[2169.24 - 2172.04] with you know intestinal INF
[2170.48 - 2174.36] inflammation and you're worried you
[2172.04 - 2176.00] think it's candida you got to bring in
[2174.36 - 2177.92] some fruit you got to bring in some
[2176.00 - 2179.16] papaya we got to talk about all this so
[2177.92 - 2181.00] we're going to we're going to go into a
[2179.16 - 2184.40] lot of this
[2181.00 - 2186.00] so key key things take-home things we
[2184.40 - 2188.28] got to build up your hydrochloric acid
[2186.00 - 2191.40] we got to get your liver stronger we got
[2188.28 - 2194.24] to get your bioproduction up to par and
[2191.40 - 2196.28] we got to get the right
[2194.24 - 2198.56] probiotics the right probiotics I'm
[2196.28 - 2200.12] going to offer later on in the show two
[2198.56 - 2202.84] probiotic companies that I think are
[2200.12 - 2205.84] okay okay that I think are fine but what
[2202.84 - 2208.48] I really like I really like is elevated
[2205.84 - 2211.00] biotics elevated biotics is a term from
[2208.48 - 2213.60] Spirit um to help the world to help you
[2211.00 - 2215.92] get better if there was a time in your
[2213.60 - 2218.04] life where you actually ate a piece of
[2215.92 - 2220.64] kale picked out of the garden it could
[2218.04 - 2223.36] have been 20 years ago the bacteria on
[2220.64 - 2226.04] that kale which is an elevated
[2223.36 - 2227.32] microorganism is still in you today
[2226.04 - 2231.56] keeping you
[2227.32 - 2233.60] alive okay it's not the microorganisms
[2231.56 - 2235.52] that are in soil born microorganisms
[2233.60 - 2237.12] those are weak those are weak that's
[2235.52 - 2241.24] outdated
[2237.12 - 2243.64] information I'm just for warning you it
[2241.24 - 2245.96] look you don't want to live in the past
[2243.64 - 2249.64] you don't want a car without the
[2245.96 - 2251.32] headrest from 1950 so when someone Nails
[2249.64 - 2253.00] you in the back they slam you in the
[2251.32 - 2254.76] back your neck goes back you have no
[2253.00 - 2257.76] head headrest on the car and your neck
[2254.76 - 2260.76] your neck snaps you don't want that kind
[2257.76 - 2263.12] of car you don't want that kind of seat
[2260.76 - 2265.52] you don't want a car without airbags
[2263.12 - 2268.24] today driving around but that's what
[2265.52 - 2270.24] it's like with this with with you know
[2268.24 - 2272.08] with the information with microorganisms
[2270.24 - 2276.08] right now the best newest stuff coming
[2272.08 - 2279.12] out is is outdated was outdated to begin
[2276.08 - 2283.08] with soil born microorganisms are not
[2279.12 - 2285.60] the ones that give us what we need okay
[2283.08 - 2287.00] they're helpful if they're not harmful
[2285.60 - 2290.04] they're helpful because they keep the
[2287.00 - 2293.08] plant healthy down below but they can't
[2290.04 - 2295.68] handle the sun they can't handle the
[2293.08 - 2297.68] wind they can't handle the rain they
[2295.68 - 2300.48] can't handle anything they hide they
[2297.68 - 2302.84] hide in the soil and they're not that
[2300.48 - 2305.00] strong when we consume them if they
[2302.84 - 2307.32] happen to be on our produce and we
[2305.00 - 2309.32] consume you know we consume a little bit
[2307.32 - 2311.72] of dirt it's not going to hurt us but it
[2309.32 - 2313.44] dies off quickly in the stomach with our
[2311.72 - 2315.92] own hydrochloric acid there's a
[2313.44 - 2318.48] microorganism called elevated biotic it
[2315.92 - 2320.88] sits on the leaves it sits on the
[2318.48 - 2323.16] raspberry you just picked it sits on the
[2320.88 - 2325.24] strawberry you just picked it's loaded
[2323.16 - 2327.28] on there and it handles the wind the
[2325.24 - 2329.40] rain it handles the radiation falling
[2327.28 - 2331.64] out of the sky it handles the chemicals
[2329.40 - 2335.72] dropping out of the
[2331.64 - 2337.92] sky it handles you know pollution it
[2335.72 - 2342.04] handles trucks with diesel fume spewing
[2337.92 - 2345.24] out of it driving by and it stays alive
[2342.04 - 2347.08] it sits there on a Raspberry someone
[2345.24 - 2348.64] told me hey I used to pick blackberries
[2347.08 - 2350.28] 20 years ago I found them on the side of
[2348.64 - 2352.60] a road was that okay and I was picking
[2350.28 - 2354.68] black yeah elevated biotics are on there
[2352.60 - 2357.40] microor microorganisms that are sitting
[2354.68 - 2360.36] on that Berry they go deep down into the
[2357.40 - 2364.44] Elum they're the only bugs that go down
[2360.36 - 2366.96] into the Elum down in there and Nestle
[2364.44 - 2368.96] in there and create B12 and save our
[2366.96 - 2370.28] butts so when you go to the farmer
[2368.96 - 2372.32] market go to the organic you know
[2370.28 - 2373.72] Farmers Market you get some kale you
[2372.32 - 2375.48] don't have to you just give it a gentle
[2373.72 - 2377.60] rinse if you see dirt on it you rinse
[2375.48 - 2378.96] off the dirt and you know the elevated
[2377.60 - 2380.48] biotics will be on there if you have a
[2378.96 - 2382.16] if you don't have a garden and you got a
[2380.48 - 2383.68] little pot and you got parsley and you
[2382.16 - 2385.36] stick it on the patio it'll collect
[2383.68 - 2388.76] elevated
[2385.36 - 2390.80] biotics apple apple from an orchard
[2388.76 - 2392.68] elevated biotics if you can only do it
[2390.80 - 2396.16] once a year it helps you do it twice a
[2392.68 - 2397.96] year helps more that's the probiotic
[2396.16 - 2399.56] that's a probiotic that keeps us alive
[2397.96 - 2402.00] that's Advanced
[2399.56 - 2403.64] information I have to I have to harp on
[2402.00 - 2405.72] that advanced information thing in case
[2403.64 - 2407.04] we got new new people on board too you
[2405.72 - 2409.08] guys if you're new this is your first
[2407.04 - 2411.28] show and you just need to know where
[2409.08 - 2412.92] we're coming from here at this show and
[2411.28 - 2414.96] just I just hope you stay with us and
[2412.92 - 2416.84] learn and learn and help people so just
[2414.96 - 2419.40] stay with us and we move forward
[2416.84 - 2421.80] together and I got respect for everybody
[2419.40 - 2423.48] in the audience everybody listening you

[2425.76 - 2430.72] with us and you know we just learn
[2427.36 - 2432.28] together we grow grow move forward um so
[2430.72 - 2434.16] it's those elevated biotics that are
[2432.28 - 2436.40] amazing they will bottle these up down
[2434.16 - 2438.20] the road when they when they learn about
[2436.40 - 2440.36] them and they discover them so I don't
[2438.20 - 2444.64] know when that's going to be I don't
[2440.36 - 2446.80] know but you can't wait those 30 years I
[2444.64 - 2449.28] can't wait okay so let's get the
[2446.80 - 2451.04] elevated biotics in us now those are the
[2449.28 - 2452.88] ones that stop disease those are the
[2451.04 - 2454.80] ones that stop cancers in our intestinal
[2452.88 - 2456.08] tracts those are the ones that stop scar
[2454.80 - 2457.28] tissue in our intestinal tract and
[2456.08 - 2459.24] that's another thing I want to talk
[2457.28 - 2461.32] about scar tissue is rampant in our
[2459.24 - 2464.04] intestinal tracts it's not leaky gut
[2461.32 - 2465.80] syndrome it's Scar Tissue Scar Tissue
[2464.04 - 2469.12] caused by antibiotics burning our
[2465.80 - 2470.92] Linings Scar Tissue caused by bacteria
[2469.12 - 2473.12] Scar Tissue caused by pollutants and
[2470.92 - 2476.32] heavy metals toxic heavy metals and
[2473.12 - 2477.80] that's that's what it's about there
[2476.32 - 2480.04] that's what it's about let's talk about
[2477.80 - 2481.36] some things we can do for all this okay
[2480.04 - 2483.00] we're going to need another gut health
[2481.36 - 2485.24] show I can tell already because we're
[2483.00 - 2489.28] moving we're moving through this so
[2485.24 - 2491.20] far H foods for gut health celery juice
[2489.28 - 2493.08] just go to my Instagram you'll see
[2491.20 - 2494.32] people drinking celery juice you guys
[2493.08 - 2496.68] know you're probably listening that they
[2494.32 - 2498.04] in Instagram all the time you're doing
[2496.68 - 2500.08] the celery juice and you're rebuilding
[2498.04 - 2501.88] your hydrochloric acid you're rebuilding
[2500.08 - 2503.80] your gut health you're getting out of
[2501.88 - 2505.80] that whole fear of candida that
[2503.80 - 2508.52] misrepresentation of candida and
[2505.80 - 2512.88] misrepresentation of leaky gut I mean
[2508.52 - 2515.48] freedom is nice man freedom is nice and
[2512.88 - 2517.04] you know it's it's important it's
[2515.48 - 2518.84] important because when you start looking
[2517.04 - 2520.32] at some of that Antiquated information
[2518.84 - 2522.64] out there and some of the antique stuff
[2520.32 - 2524.80] and you like oh my God I was there it's
[2522.64 - 2526.96] great to be here it feels good I feel
[2524.80 - 2528.36] the same way you guys do trust me I'm
[2526.96 - 2530.00] because I'm because I'm just glad I'm
[2528.36 - 2532.08] with spirit I feel the same way I'm
[2530.00 - 2534.08] honored and and I just I'm just great I
[2532.08 - 2536.68] meaning it feels great to have it the
[2534.08 - 2539.68] information for all of us me me included
[2536.68 - 2541.68] so celery juice 16 ounces of celery
[2539.68 - 2543.56] juice every morning once a day you can
[2541.68 - 2545.28] turn your gut problems around
[2543.56 - 2546.68] hydrochloric acid builds up your liver
[2545.28 - 2548.92] starts to back down
[2546.68 - 2551.28] meaning it starts to calm down if it's
[2548.92 - 2552.76] overheated if it's inflamed it starts to
[2551.28 - 2555.32] get better if you're an acupuncturist
[2552.76 - 2556.96] and you just believe in in acupuncture
[2555.32 - 2559.12] you know I love all forms of medicine
[2556.96 - 2560.72] that are alternative and even
[2559.12 - 2561.88] conventional um many of them
[2560.72 - 2563.84] conventional but if you're an
[2561.88 - 2565.56] acupuncturist you you always find that
[2563.84 - 2568.00] liver heat in your patients I bet you
[2565.56 - 2569.12] know what I mean so you probably see all
[2568.00 - 2571.04] that liver heat in them because you're
[2569.12 - 2572.76] using your intuition you're popping
[2571.04 - 2575.64] needles into them and you're like whoa
[2572.76 - 2577.36] this liver is a mess well the celery
[2575.64 - 2579.80] juice make sure your clients are on
[2577.36 - 2582.44] celery juice if it goes against a belief
[2579.80 - 2584.52] system just try to work it in somehow
[2582.44 - 2586.20] try to work it in but you'll get your
[2584.52 - 2587.56] your patients with all those liver
[2586.20 - 2589.08] problems better because I know
[2587.56 - 2590.44] acupuncturist they talk to me all the
[2589.08 - 2592.20] time about they say well you wouldn't
[2590.44 - 2596.32] believe the liver problems I see Anthony
[2592.20 - 2599.52] I go yeah use some celery juice aloe
[2596.32 - 2602.36] water aloe water that's a big deal so
[2599.52 - 2603.92] you blend aloe in a blender look for
[2602.36 - 2605.36] different recipes I got them everywhere
[2603.92 - 2608.60] I think they're you know go to Medical
[2605.36 - 2610.84] medium.com go to my blog and you'll find
[2608.60 - 2613.96] it it's really
[2610.84 - 2616.64] important so aloe water Alo is an
[2613.96 - 2618.48] anti-inflammatory because it's antiviral
[2616.64 - 2621.32] antibacterial it goes into the
[2618.48 - 2624.32] intestinal lining and it only starts
[2621.32 - 2628.68] going after that bad bacteria that sibo
[2624.32 - 2631.40] bacteria that IBS bacteria all of it so
[2628.68 - 2634.56] you want you want your Alo okay it
[2631.40 - 2638.72] lowers the bad acids acid
[2634.56 - 2642.24] reflux is because hydrochloric acid one
[2638.72 - 2645.16] the seven blend is gone and what took
[2642.24 - 2648.16] over is acids produced by
[2645.16 - 2650.84] bacteria and viruses and that's what
[2648.16 - 2654.52] acid reflux is it's actually bacteria
[2650.84 - 2657.88] produced I mean acids produced bad acids
[2654.52 - 2660.64] produced by bacteria and that's that's
[2657.88 - 2662.04] what it is so you want to get the celery
[2660.64 - 2663.20] juice in there you want to get the aloe
[2662.04 - 2666.12] water in there every day to start
[2663.20 - 2669.52] knocking down that bad bacteria you want
[2666.12 - 2671.40] to get papaya in you papaya papaya it is
[2669.52 - 2673.80] it's a Saving Grace I've seen it save
[2671.40 - 2677.24] people's lives with colitis with Crohn
[2673.80 - 2679.76] with um IBS with intestinal chronic
[2677.24 - 2682.72] gastritis chronic inflammation papaya is
[2679.76 - 2684.92] amazing it helps soothes the nerves if
[2682.72 - 2686.44] you got viral neurological problems with
[2684.92 - 2689.64] your intestinal tract that I was talking
[2686.44 - 2692.28] about early earlier soothes the nerves
[2689.64 - 2695.48] wild blueberries they feed all good
[2692.28 - 2697.80] bacteria they feed elevated biotic
[2695.48 - 2700.84] bacteria it feeds off of that that's
[2697.80 - 2703.68] like that's like milk of the gods to the
[2700.84 - 2705.68] bacteria that's keeping us alive so
[2703.68 - 2707.36] that's important and I wanted to tell
[2705.68 - 2710.28] you about the elevated biotics they sit
[2707.36 - 2712.88] in the Elum and they produce B12 B12
[2710.28 - 2715.76] that's bioidentical to us that our body
[2712.88 - 2719.24] uses to stop methylation problems to
[2715.76 - 2722.04] stop stop our methylation issues that we
[2719.24 - 2726.56] have and that's what the elevated
[2722.04 - 2728.40] biotics really does okay so um if look
[2726.56 - 2730.40] if the a lot of if I've gone too fast on
[2728.40 - 2732.44] the show cuz I'm talking so fast just go
[2730.40 - 2734.20] back to the show listen to it again
[2732.44 - 2736.60] you'll probably be able to pick nuggets
[2734.20 - 2739.72] out of it so you know please go back to
[2736.60 - 2742.52] it if you can um
[2739.72 - 2745.08] oranges oranges are incredible for the
[2742.52 - 2748.32] intestinal tract the bioflavonoids the
[2745.08 - 2750.24] pith all of that oranges are amazing
[2748.32 - 2752.56] they move through the intestinal track

[2967.92 - 2972.08] sure somebody's upset about that but the
[2969.64 - 2974.56] point is it's just it's not good it
[2972.08 - 2976.88] isn't uh with intestinal tracts it gets
[2974.56 - 2978.20] it's really hard on the lining so these

[3015.40 - 3019.04] Advanced information they got into it
[3017.76 - 3021.56] and then they the person was
[3019.04 - 3023.64] recommending canola oil they were saying
[3021.56 - 3025.04] non GMO canol canola oil but they're
