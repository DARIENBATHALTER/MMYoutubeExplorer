[20.88 - 23.60] episode right chemtrails the sky is
[22.88 - 26.96] falling
[23.60 - 28.32] which is really that's a mind blower

[38.40 - 42.32] okay they lied to you really important
[40.72 - 43.76] one got to listen to that one again if

[50.40 - 54.40] notified first

[66.64 - 72.00] but the brain meditation is next and
[70.16 - 74.80] i have to give you a forewarning though
[72.00 - 77.84] on this okay with the brain meditation
[74.80 - 79.52] this is really intense in a good way
[77.84 - 81.76] but it's really intense because once you
[79.52 - 84.40] do it something's going to
[81.76 - 85.20] change so when you do the brain
[84.40 - 88.08] meditation
[85.20 - 88.96] something is going to change because
[88.08 - 92.24] it's about
[88.96 - 94.08] ridding fear out of the soul so what
[92.24 - 96.56] happens when we go through life
[94.08 - 97.36] we get broken relationships broken
[96.56 - 99.52] friendships
[97.36 - 100.80] we get you know betrayal happens in our
[99.52 - 103.84] life people
[100.80 - 106.80] cheat on us they friendships you know
[103.84 - 108.48] uh they they fall apart things happen we
[106.80 - 111.28] go through emotional struggles emotional
[108.48 - 114.32] hardships we get broken trust over it
[111.28 - 116.40] we feel guilt and shame we get fearful
[114.32 - 118.56] we get anxiety over depression all these
[116.40 - 122.16] different things depersonalization
[118.56 - 123.04] and what happens is this builds up in
[122.16 - 125.12] our soul
[123.04 - 126.80] and builds up in our soul and builds up
[125.12 - 129.36] in our soul over time
[126.80 - 130.64] and a lot of fear builds up the brain
[129.36 - 132.16] meditation
[130.64 - 134.48] and this is from spirit of compassion
[132.16 - 136.08] this brain meditation is a powerful
[134.48 - 138.72] powerful way to rid
[136.08 - 140.80] that fear but here's how it works though
[138.72 - 142.08] this is not a man-made meditation so
[140.80 - 145.04] that's one thing right there
[142.08 - 146.56] that's so important it's not man-made it
[145.04 - 147.84] it's a meditation i haven't shared with
[146.56 - 150.00] you guys yet because i've shared
[147.84 - 151.36] meditations with you guys before right
[150.00 - 154.16] you know the medical medium books
[151.36 - 155.68] there's meditations in there and
[154.16 - 157.68] and what i've done you know lectures
[155.68 - 158.40] years ago i would share meditations
[157.68 - 159.84] there too
[158.40 - 161.76] from medical you know medical media
[159.84 - 163.84] meditations it was from spirit of
[161.76 - 165.76] compassion but this one
[163.84 - 167.84] i haven't shared yet so this is a
[165.76 - 170.56] special surprise so
[167.84 - 171.84] um but prepare yourself find a quiet
[170.56 - 174.72] spot
[171.84 - 176.48] and settle in with a quiet spot it's a
[174.72 - 179.68] short meditation so it's not super
[176.48 - 183.20] long but it's powerful
[179.68 - 185.28] very powerful it's it's a chiller
[183.20 - 187.12] actually so it's a chiller so i'm
[185.28 - 187.76] preparing you on that level because in
[187.12 - 190.96] order
[187.76 - 194.40] to rid fear from the soul something
[190.96 - 196.64] actually has to happen and
[194.40 - 198.64] because meditations meditations you have
[196.64 - 199.76] to kind of like keep on doing them over
[198.64 - 201.12] and over and over again in hopes that
[199.76 - 201.76] you can get some relief and feel good
[201.12 - 204.40] from them
[201.76 - 205.36] and all this this is different this is
[204.40 - 208.16] about actually
[205.36 - 209.04] fixing something so this is actually
[208.16 - 210.56] about
[209.04 - 212.16] moving something forward and
[210.56 - 214.08] accomplishing and fixing something
[212.16 - 215.84] within this brain meditation
[214.08 - 218.08] so i'll just give you a little run down
[215.84 - 220.00] about how this works so tomorrow morning
[218.08 - 221.92] the episode's going to be released okay
[220.00 - 224.64] subscribe to apple podcast

[419.28 - 424.48] you don't even know how much so and so
[422.48 - 425.68] this brain meditation here's what
[424.48 - 429.76] happens
[425.68 - 431.68] we start getting out of body with ptsd
[429.76 - 432.96] experiences we have in our life we start
[431.68 - 435.68] disconnecting
[432.96 - 436.96] so our soul because we all have a soul
[435.68 - 439.36] all unique
[436.96 - 440.88] so that's what makes us different right
[439.36 - 442.80] there our souls right
[440.88 - 444.64] what happens is it gets kind of tattered
[442.80 - 445.76] along the way it gets kind of beaten
[444.64 - 447.44] along the way
[445.76 - 449.20] kind of kind of a little beat up and tat
[447.44 - 451.68] and worn and tattered
[449.20 - 452.64] by all these experiences we go through
[451.68 - 455.92] life
[452.64 - 456.96] divorces breakups friendships that go
[455.92 - 460.16] wrong
[456.96 - 461.92] um you know betrayal you know all these
[460.16 - 464.24] different things that happen in our life
[461.92 - 467.20] with relationships with other people
[464.24 - 467.84] with you know with uh careers anything
[467.20 - 470.48] that could
[467.84 - 471.52] happen any kind of struggles losses oh
[470.48 - 473.84] my god
[471.52 - 476.00] terrible losses people people suffer
[473.84 - 478.16] from ptsd because of it
[476.00 - 479.36] and what happens is our soul starts to
[478.16 - 482.48] kind of
[479.36 - 485.04] kind of separate because separate from
[482.48 - 487.44] our physical brain from our physical
[485.04 - 489.60] body because it's just too much because
[487.44 - 490.32] it's trying to get protected because
[489.60 - 492.24] it's getting
[490.32 - 494.16] injured it could get fractured by all
[492.24 - 496.00] these experiences along the way and i've
[494.16 - 498.32] talked about this over the years but
[496.00 - 500.64] this is a meditation that spirit of
[498.32 - 503.60] compassion taught me when i was younger
[500.64 - 505.04] and i've um and i've shared it with
[503.60 - 506.56] family i've shared it with
[505.04 - 508.32] friends throughout the years to help
[506.56 - 511.84] them rid fear
[508.32 - 513.84] so that a connection is made again and
[511.84 - 515.68] we don't know we get this disconnection
[513.84 - 518.80] you guys we don't know
[515.68 - 520.48] that we get this disconnection and you
[518.80 - 522.24] will experience
[520.48 - 525.04] when you do this brain meditation
[522.24 - 527.28] something that i'm just preparing you
[525.04 - 529.28] it's a chiller and i'm saying that
[527.28 - 532.32] because it is because when you
[529.28 - 534.56] start making that connection and fear is
[532.32 - 536.00] leaving you as your soul is connecting
[534.56 - 537.28] to your brain your physical brain and
[536.00 - 540.08] body
[537.28 - 541.76] you feel it it something changes you're
[540.08 - 543.68] changed afterwards and then if you keep
[541.76 - 545.92] on doing this i saw june has a comment
[543.68 - 546.88] hey june i can't thank you in spirit

[646.72 - 653.12] medium podcast that's being released
[649.44 - 653.92] and um i got a smile on my face on this
[653.12 - 656.24] one because
[653.92 - 657.92] this one's really close to me like dear
[656.24 - 659.36] to me this brain meditation
[657.92 - 661.92] a spirit of compassion has taught me
[659.36 - 664.96] since i was a child and
[661.92 - 665.84] and you can have anyone do this and
[664.96 - 667.76] there was a question
[665.84 - 669.60] earlier that came my way was can
[667.76 - 671.04] children do it absolutely of course they
[669.60 - 674.32] can do this meditation
[671.04 - 678.32] and and but it's it's
[674.32 - 682.72] really really healing on a soul
[678.32 - 685.12] level of ridding fear is what it does
[682.72 - 686.24] it's a little bit of a chiller though
[685.12 - 687.68] i'm just being
[686.24 - 689.36] frankly i'm just being straight out
[687.68 - 692.80] about that so pre
[689.36 - 696.48] so get you know get in a comfy spot
[692.80 - 699.68] prepare yourself and get ready
[696.48 - 701.28] because when you make that
[699.68 - 703.76] soul connection back to the physical
[701.28 - 706.56] body all the way
[703.76 - 707.76] when you do this and fear just leaves
[706.56 - 710.48] it's an experience

[909.68 - 913.76] it's only going to help people it has to

[913.76 - 918.08] and tell them to listen on apple podcast
[916.80 - 920.88] um can't wait to hear the brain
[918.08 - 921.28] meditation lisa i'm really excited about
[920.88 - 924.32] this
[921.28 - 925.04] okay because what happens is when we go
[924.32 - 927.68] through life
[925.04 - 929.36] we we get hurt along the way even on a
[927.68 - 929.76] little little levels and it creates
[929.36 - 932.64] little
[929.76 - 933.84] little specks of fear inside our soul
[932.64 - 935.04] because then we're like wait a minute i
[933.84 - 937.60] don't trust that
[935.04 - 938.16] wait a minute i don't trust this wait a
[937.60 - 939.68] minute
[938.16 - 942.00] i don't know if i should do this or make
[939.68 - 944.40] this decision this decision in life
[942.00 - 945.92] i don't know if i should do this and so
[944.40 - 948.88] fear can start to just
[945.92 - 949.92] dominate and dominate in our lives and
[948.88 - 952.24] over time
[949.92 - 954.24] and what happens with this meditation
[952.24 - 957.60] this brain meditation is
[954.24 - 960.40] is it reconnects
[957.60 - 961.84] the the soul and the physical brain
[960.40 - 964.64] because they start
[961.84 - 966.40] to separate which is that out of body
[964.64 - 968.80] thing that goes on that we just start
[966.40 - 972.16] like because life is so hard
[968.80 - 975.44] and it reconnects and then fear just
[972.16 - 977.36] starts to leave and it's really powerful
[975.44 - 979.28] i can't wait for you guys to try this
[977.36 - 980.32] and tell other people tell every people
[979.28 - 982.88] tell people
[980.32 - 984.56] you know on on your on your platforms
[982.88 - 985.76] let everybody know you guys and when
[984.56 - 988.80] you're doing it just no

[1330.72 - 1333.76] going to be a game changer for me
[1332.32 - 1335.68] always feel disconnected from the
[1333.76 - 1338.72] traumas and emotions michelle
[1335.68 - 1340.40] really really good good point
[1338.72 - 1342.08] for me to talk about for a minute that's
[1340.40 - 1344.80] so important thank you for
[1342.08 - 1346.48] thank you for saying that because what
[1344.80 - 1348.32] happens is we have that we have the
[1346.48 - 1350.56] broken friendships and relationships and
[1348.32 - 1352.32] the betrayal and the hardships and the
[1350.56 - 1355.52] losses and all kind even
[1352.32 - 1357.04] on the most mildest way to even extreme
[1355.52 - 1359.20] then what happens is we kind of get out
[1357.04 - 1360.88] of body we get disconnected no one knows
[1359.20 - 1361.44] what that is and what that is is the
[1360.88 - 1363.04] soul
[1361.44 - 1365.04] getting disconnected to the physical
[1363.04 - 1368.40] brain the neurons in the brain
[1365.04 - 1371.04] and this meditation brings things back
[1368.40 - 1372.24] it makes the connection that's why this
[1371.04 - 1373.92] is so powerful
[1372.24 - 1375.60] share it with others that you think are
[1373.92 - 1377.12] hurt or just any
[1375.60 - 1378.48] even if they're not they don't seem like
[1377.12 - 1379.60] they're hurt they still have fear in
[1378.48 - 1381.92] there deep inside
[1379.60 - 1384.08] ashley says subscribe to his newsletter
[1381.92 - 1387.68] for the links
[1384.08 - 1391.76] yep yep correct correct

[1418.32 - 1422.80] it makes it even stronger and stronger

[1514.96 - 1518.88] and that's what i recommend to my family
[1517.04 - 1520.16] and friends that have gone through shock
[1518.88 - 1522.16] or trauma
[1520.16 - 1524.00] and they've gone through hardships ups
[1522.16 - 1526.08] and downs even if it's just
[1524.00 - 1527.12] a relationship breakup you've had five
[1526.08 - 1530.24] years ago
[1527.12 - 1532.48] or seven years ago or something else
[1530.24 - 1535.36] happened in your life like a loved one
[1532.48 - 1537.04] passed away or anything i recommend the
[1535.36 - 1539.12] brain meditation
[1537.04 - 1540.24] twice a day it's a short one you can do
[1539.12 - 1542.64] in the morning you do it at night you
[1540.24 - 1545.60] can do it other other places too um
[1542.64 - 1546.00] repeat it for sure link is pinned in the
[1545.60 - 1548.88] link
[1546.00 - 1549.60] for the podcast is pinned in the
[1548.88 - 1552.40] comments

[1553.68 - 1560.64] god bless you guys too um
[1557.36 - 1563.20] i'm really really okay rosanna
[1560.64 - 1564.64] so it's hard for me to meditate mind
[1563.20 - 1567.60] wanders all over the place
[1564.64 - 1568.80] yes it's meditations out there are hard
[1567.60 - 1570.56] they're man-made
[1568.80 - 1572.56] and man-made meditations are different
[1570.56 - 1573.60] than this this is not a man-made
[1572.56 - 1576.48] meditation
[1573.60 - 1577.60] this is a meditation that's easy to do
[1576.48 - 1579.44] but more powerful
[1577.60 - 1580.96] than man-made meditations this
[1579.44 - 1582.40] meditation comes from above
[1580.96 - 1584.00] since i was child i was taught this
[1582.40 - 1587.04] meditation from from
[1584.00 - 1590.24] spirit of compassion and it's easy
[1587.04 - 1593.28] to do but mind-blowing
[1590.24 - 1595.92] and mind-healing it's a chiller
[1593.28 - 1599.84] i say that because it is it's a chiller
[1595.92 - 1599.84] really important to know
[1600.00 - 1604.24] connie says i didn't see the chemtrail

[1645.84 - 1649.20] that's what i'm all about it's about
[1647.44 - 1650.48] getting people the information and i ask
[1649.20 - 1652.32] you guys if you can do that

[1652.32 - 1658.96] free free free free
[1654.40 - 1658.96] and if you can share it that's my wish
[1660.80 - 1664.88] danielle good question will the
[1662.96 - 1668.48] meditation heal in layers
[1664.88 - 1669.92] the more that we do yes the first time
[1668.48 - 1673.52] you do it
[1669.92 - 1676.80] powerful you keep on doing it powerful
[1673.52 - 1677.60] you keep on doing it powerful and more
[1676.80 - 1680.80] powerful
[1677.60 - 1681.44] and it literally becomes a part of your
[1680.80 - 1684.80] soul
[1681.44 - 1689.04] to get rid of the fear and it becomes
[1684.80 - 1691.12] this anchor so that your soul
[1689.04 - 1692.40] stays with your physical brain and body
[1691.12 - 1694.80] because when we get hurt
[1692.40 - 1696.32] when someone cheats on us boom our soul
[1694.80 - 1697.44] just gets knocked out of us for a moment
[1696.32 - 1699.76] we're out of body
[1697.44 - 1700.96] when we lose a loved one boom our soul
[1699.76 - 1702.40] gets knocked out of us for a little
[1700.96 - 1706.16] while we're out of body
[1702.40 - 1708.24] when we get hurt by someone boom
[1706.16 - 1709.28] when we have a divorce boom when we have
[1708.24 - 1712.72] a uh
[1709.28 - 1715.68] some kind of confrontation boom our soul
[1712.72 - 1717.52] goes out of body and it kind of hovers
[1715.68 - 1720.40] around us a little bit
[1717.52 - 1720.80] and we start getting disconnected and
[1720.40 - 1722.80] and
[1720.80 - 1724.00] when you do the meditation you're
[1722.80 - 1725.52] bringing your soul closer
[1724.00 - 1727.20] to your to your neurons you're
[1725.52 - 1729.52] connecting the physical part of your
[1727.20 - 1731.44] body with your soul everybody has a soul
[1729.52 - 1733.92] that's that's what that's what we are
[1731.44 - 1736.00] we're a soul inside a physical body
[1733.92 - 1739.12] and so it's connecting it and healing it
[1736.00 - 1741.04] it's ridding fear to bring the soul back
[1739.12 - 1742.40] this isn't out there anywhere it doesn't
[1741.04 - 1743.76] exist out there and finally i'm like
[1742.40 - 1745.44] look i get it there's man-made
[1743.76 - 1746.88] meditations out there people are trying
[1745.44 - 1750.32] to do stuff out there
[1746.88 - 1753.84] but it's time it's time i bring this
[1750.32 - 1754.80] anchor in so people get grounded and get
[1753.84 - 1757.44] that fear out
[1754.80 - 1759.44] and heal the soul it's time i was really
[1757.44 - 1762.16] excited about this
[1759.44 - 1764.16] okay julia wells says jump just jumped

[2071.28 - 2075.68] bless your heart i'm so proud of all you
[2073.12 - 2076.48] guys jen says can't wait i really need
[2075.68 - 2080.08] this
[2076.48 - 2082.24] jen um this brain meditation
[2080.08 - 2083.52] every day do it once a day i like it
[2082.24 - 2084.96] twice a day morning and night i'd
[2083.52 - 2085.76] recommend it to friends and family that
[2084.96 - 2087.28] have
[2085.76 - 2088.88] things have happened in their life that
[2087.28 - 2091.20] have stayed with them
[2088.88 - 2092.64] and post-traumatic stress syndrome and
[2091.20 - 2094.32] everything and i've recommended this
[2092.64 - 2095.44] meditation twice a day because it's
[2094.32 - 2098.96] short
[2095.44 - 2102.00] short and powerful and not hard to
[2098.96 - 2105.28] do you find a quiet spot you kick
[2102.00 - 2106.16] back you lay down and you close your
[2105.28 - 2109.68] eyes
[2106.16 - 2112.80] and you listen and you do it twice a day
[2109.68 - 2116.16] and it really
[2112.80 - 2119.04] really helps connect
[2116.16 - 2120.96] that divide that occurs from when we get
[2119.04 - 2121.76] hurt that divide and then fear here's
[2120.96 - 2124.16] what happens
[2121.76 - 2125.52] as a soul as we get hurt through life we
[2124.16 - 2129.12] get that we get betrayed
[2125.52 - 2130.80] our soul leaves our body a little bit
[2129.12 - 2134.00] and then what fills in in between is
[2130.80 - 2136.32] fear so fear fills in the gap
[2134.00 - 2137.36] so the soul starts leaving a little fear
[2136.32 - 2138.88] fills in the gap
[2137.36 - 2141.92] fear fills in the gap soul starts
[2138.88 - 2144.32] leaving more and more fear fills the gap
[2141.92 - 2145.84] and now we're fearful when we don't even
[2144.32 - 2147.04] think we're supposed to or not and we
[2145.84 - 2149.28] have it in the way even if we're not
[2147.04 - 2152.16] feeling it in the moment it's there
[2149.28 - 2153.68] and this brings the soul back rids fear
[2152.16 - 2155.44] brings the soul back more rid sphere
[2153.68 - 2157.20] brings the soul back ritz fear
[2155.44 - 2158.96] and brings it back and then you do it
[2157.20 - 2161.44] every day

[2357.44 - 2363.20] just different emotional challenges and
[2360.72 - 2364.80] what happens is your soul just slowly
[2363.20 - 2366.72] leaves the body a little bit
[2364.80 - 2368.08] so slowly leaves the body and fear fills
[2366.72 - 2370.64] in the center and fills in the center
[2368.08 - 2373.60] and it just starts to divide and
[2370.64 - 2374.32] this brain meditation it brings the soul
[2373.60 - 2376.56] back
