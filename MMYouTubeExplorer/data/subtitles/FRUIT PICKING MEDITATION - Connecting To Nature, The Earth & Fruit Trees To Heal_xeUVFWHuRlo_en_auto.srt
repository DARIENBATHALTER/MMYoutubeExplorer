over 200 symptoms and conditions anyway

283
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,360
look you guys when it comes down to

284
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,600
depression

285
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,000
we start to lose a part of our like

286
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,600
neurotransmitter function

287
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,959
when we're depressed and we're depressed

288
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,600
and we're depressed and going through so

289
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,040
much

290
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,120
and what happens is that

291
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,519
neurotransmitters they get really wonky

292
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,920
if we're in a state of severe depression

293
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,560
if we're in a state of high anxiety

294
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,760

that i had to actually not only

563
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:50,320
understand it

564
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,640
but feel it to a point to a point that

565
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,880
was

566
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,679
definitely almost dangerous when i was

567
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,799
young but i

568
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:59,200
had to still feel it i had to still

569
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:00,720
uh resonate with it i had to experience

570
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,160
it in some way

571
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:07,520
and um so i i just that's why i'm able

572
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:10,720
to describe the symptoms and describe

573
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:14,240
all the struggles and understand it

574
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:15,360
i have to it's the only way to really

575
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,799
understand it or understand what

576
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,160
someone's going because i always say

577
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,760
unless you've been in their shoes

578
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,360
you don't know nothing unless you've

579
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,799
been in their shoes and

580
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,960

illness and symptoms

669
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:26,320
that you know what foods to avoid like

670
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,679
the eggs and i'm not saying

671
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,600
you don't have to avoid the eggs if you

672
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,880
don't want to but i talk about why if

673
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,760
you do want to

674
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,840
um and so it's really important there

675
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,559
carmen says how do you choose which

676
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,400
supplement to take first out of the list

677
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:43,200
read the supplement chapter

678
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,480
i put all that information in here so if

679
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,679
you've got cleanse to heal

680
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,200
and you see all the supplements and

681
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,039
dosages and everything read the

682
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,520
supplement chapter the whole thing

683
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:53,120
it's in there you just gotta look for it

684
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,559
good question really good question i'm

685
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,440
glad you asked because it's important

686
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:58,080
it's important

687
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,760
uh rebunken says i tried the fruit

688
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,559
picking meditation this morning

689
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,600
really enjoyed it incredible and

690
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:05,360
elizabeth

691
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,400
says i could really taste those wild

692
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,240
blueberries do they have the wild

693
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,080
blueberries in mexico

694
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,520
i wonder if they do you know i never

695
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,480
knew if they did or not

696
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,840
um but yeah that's incredible um but you

697
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,760
could taste the wild blueberries right

698
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,400
because you you buy the wild blueberries

699
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,159
and stuff

700
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,679
because exactly you can get them you can

701
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,360
buy them now the frozen wild blueberries

702
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,520
have them right here

703
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,280
but it's hard to find a spot to pick

704
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,559
them live and stuff l

705
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,480
it's hard for people to understand

706
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:32,080
anxiety it so is

707
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,760
did you hear the opening of that episode

708
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,960
the anxiety episode where i go

709
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:38,640
come on knock it off what do you mean

710
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,320
you still have it

711
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,559
just exercise and get rid of your

712
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:45,120
anxiety what do you mean you're bald up

713
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:46,880
on the couch shivering and shaking

714
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,320
did you hear the beginning that one it's

715
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,400
hard for people to understand

716
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,400
anxiety i agree my mom advised me to

717
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,880
breathe deeper because it's a cure for

718
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,120
it

719
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,480
um the problem is with anxiety you get

720
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,559
the tightness of the chest

721
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,240
and focusing on your breath sometimes is

722
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,559
not the answer

723
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,799
it's really difficult really difficult

724
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:07,919
but i'm not saying mom's wrong or right

725
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:10,720
mom's mom's the best

726
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:12,000

you

815
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,080
it is it is amazing in our logical

816
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,760
podcast oh

817
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,520
neurological podcast i forgot about that

818
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,679
you explained all my symptoms better

819
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:08,240
than i ever could

820
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,240
you know what

821
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,080
you know there's people out there they

822
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,279
go oh i know this and that there's

823
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,080
there's health gurus out there and

824
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:16,240
they're like

825
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,760
chanting their lymphatic system stuff

826
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,880
and they're chanting they're

827
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:23,520
they're chanting their spiel

828
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,200
on something about you know iridology or

829
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,399
something or they're chanting something

830
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,640
whatever it is and

831
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:30,240
that's great and all but do you really

832
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,440
know why people are sick

833
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,760
probably not number two

834
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,960
do you really know what people suffer

835
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:41,120
with and how they suffer

836
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:44,159
because if you don't know that then

837
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:47,679
i don't know you have to know

838
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:51,120
their symptoms better than they do

839
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:52,320
because if you don't you don't know what

840
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,600
it's like to be in their shoes so you

841
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,559
better understand it

842
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,520
you gotta you gotta because you gotta be

843
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:59,679
