[97.76 - 103.32] your
[98.88 - 105.92] adrenals they release adrenaline lots of
[103.32 - 108.68] adrenaline because your brain received
[105.92 - 111.80] information do you see this your brain
[108.68 - 115.36] received information I was

[120.72 - 124.20] misunderstanding and as it comes into
[122.84 - 126.60] the brain like we're getting that
[124.20 - 129.60] information and it's Computing inside
[126.60 - 132.16] the brain your brain sending signals to

[140.88 - 144.48] talking about total immune talking about
[142.48 - 146.48] cats claw and why we're talking about
[144.48 - 150.20] that we're going to be on the defensive
[146.48 - 153.92] with our immune system protecting us CR
[150.20 - 157.48] that we have immune system protectors we
[153.92 - 161.64] get bad news we receive that bad news in
[157.48 - 164.36] the brain obviously we hear it with our
[161.64 - 167.04] ears those nerves go straight to the
[164.36 - 171.16] brain the information gets there and
[167.04 - 173.68] then the brain sends information to your
[171.16 - 177.60] adrenals it sends information now to
[173.68 - 181.36] your adrenals your adrenals then explode
[177.60 - 183.84] so they release Lots of adrenaline
[181.36 - 186.28] because it's fight or flight what just
[183.84 - 188.40] happened what was just cancelled what
[186.28 - 192.04] went wrong wait a minute you just broke
[188.40 - 194.04] my trust where's your loyalty you're not
[192.04 - 196.36] loyal what the heck happened why would
[194.04 - 199.68] you do this to me why are we breaking up
[196.36 - 202.12] whatever it is your adrenals are now
[199.68 - 204.12] releasing okay and maybe it's a long
[202.12 - 206.76] ride like a divorce or something like
[204.12 - 209.16] that where it's just constant it's like
[206.76 - 211.32] one thing happening here then now 3 days
[209.16 - 213.60] go by everything's leveling out then one
[211.32 - 215.64] thing happens here would if or if it's
[213.60 - 218.28] maybe mental abuse or some kind of abuse
[215.64 - 220.16] on a person those adrenals are
[218.28 - 221.96] constantly releasing adrenaline so let's
[220.16 - 223.80] get into it a little bit here we go
[221.96 - 227.80] that's your bloodstream right
[223.80 - 230.56] there okay now here comes the
[227.80 - 233.04] adrenaline that's your
[230.56 - 234.56] bloodstream these are immune cells right
[233.04 - 237.80] here you see that you guys these are
[234.56 - 240.48] immune cells your immune system inside
[237.80 - 243.00] your bloodstream really important to no
[240.48 - 246.80] here comes the adrenaline now it's
[243.00 - 249.20] rushing into your bloodstream you've
[246.80 - 251.80] been betrayed broken
[249.20 - 253.28] trust something happened someone would
[251.80 - 255.76] that was supposed to be loyal is not
[253.28 - 258.56] loyal you care about somebody they don't
[255.76 - 263.44] care about you anymore it seems now the
[258.56 - 266.72] adrenaline is rushing in right here okay
[263.44 - 268.72] immune cells do not like
[266.72 - 273.20] adrenaline immune
[268.72 - 275.08] cells do not like adrenaline adrenaline
[273.20 - 277.40] when we're upset when we've been
[275.08 - 281.52] betrayed when there's a trust issue
[277.40 - 284.08] adrenaline is like poison to the immune
[281.52 - 286.04] system and then we get that adrenaline
[284.08 - 287.88] Spike did you ever have the shakes
[286.04 - 290.48] because of adrenaline happy Saturday to
[287.88 - 293.72] you too do you ever have the shakes
[290.48 - 296.00] where right where you're shaking you got
[293.72 - 297.56] bad news and you're shaking I see that
[296.00 - 300.16] happen out there all the time with
[297.56 - 302.56] people and it could be anything
[300.16 - 304.80] that they're experiencing well that's
[302.56 - 307.72] adrenaline now yes you have experienced
[304.80 - 310.52] that yes you too okay that's adrenaline
[307.72 - 313.76] rushing into the
[310.52 - 316.32] bloodstream rushing into the organs
[313.76 - 318.56] social media Terra social media bullying
[316.32 - 320.72] totally right and it's adrenaline
[318.56 - 322.40] rushing in and that's why we're going to
[320.72 - 324.16] protect our immune cells that's what
[322.40 - 325.96] this is about and that's why you see
[324.16 - 329.88] that propolis there that's why you see
[325.96 - 332.12] that cats claw there so as that add
[329.88 - 333.56] adrenaline is rushing into the
[332.12 - 335.92] bloodstream right here and I'm going to
[333.56 - 337.16] make another bloodstream over here too
[335.92 - 341.64] here's another
[337.16 - 345.32] bloodstream right there you see guys all
[341.64 - 348.44] right is that adrenaline is rushing in
[345.32 - 351.72] here it is it's scorching the immune
[348.44 - 355.04] cells so our immune system gets beaten
[351.72 - 356.64] down by it it scorches the immune cells
[355.04 - 359.88] okay it's a little immune cell right
[356.64 - 363.12] there you guys can see it and adrenaline
[359.88 - 366.00] tends to Scorch it we get bad news we
[363.12 - 369.28] receive it right here in the
[366.00 - 373.64] brain right information goes from the
[369.28 - 376.52] brain into the brain stem out the nerves
[373.64 - 378.84] out the cranial nerves heads out to the
[376.52 - 381.72] adrenals the adrenals get a message
[378.84 - 382.80] saying fight ORF flight fight or flight
[381.72 - 386.92] fight or
[382.80 - 389.88] flight and then the adrenals are dumping
[386.92 - 393.08] adrenaline okay
[389.88 - 395.04] and then that adrenaline goes right in
[393.08 - 396.68] you know how many people get the flu
[395.04 - 398.08] they get the flu during some kind of a
[396.68 - 399.52] strange moment a strange time where
[398.08 - 401.04] they're under pressure they're under
[399.52 - 402.76] some kind of stress they're emotionally
[401.04 - 405.24] going through something and then they're
[402.76 - 407.08] just boom down with a flu you know how
[405.24 - 408.92] many people get
[407.08 - 411.56] mononucleosis because of something
[408.92 - 413.76] they've gone through and ups and downs
[411.56 - 416.28] breakups with relationships and then
[413.76 - 418.72] they just hit the wall and they just
[416.28 - 421.12] they have mono right how many people
[418.72 - 423.24] have done that and maybe you're not just
[421.12 - 425.92] up against the emotional stuff maybe
[423.24 - 427.68] you're just wearing yourself out maybe
[425.92 - 429.92] because you have no choice or whatever
[427.68 - 432.44] it is but the emotional stuff is a big
[429.92 - 434.84] deal because it floods that adrenaline
[432.44 - 436.60] into the system the adrenaline gets in
[434.84 - 438.48] there and it hits the immune cells so
[436.60 - 441.80] here's how it works as the adrenaline's
[438.48 - 445.36] going in it's scorching weak immune
[441.80 - 449.72] cells so weak immune cells
[445.36 - 452.64] explode weak immune cells explode
[449.72 - 454.68] they do they die off so as all that
[452.64 - 458.04] adrenaline goes through during that bad
[454.68 - 460.04] news you got immune cells dying off now
[458.04 - 460.92] and as those immune cells are dying off
[460.04 - 463.48] it's
[460.92 - 467.28] leaving space for
[463.48 - 469.72] Invaders it's leaving space for
[467.28 - 472.56] Invaders Elena says every time I am
[469.72 - 474.64] severely stressed I get the flu happens
[472.56 - 477.24] to a lot of people don't think it just
[474.64 - 479.12] happens to you on that there are so many
[477.24 - 480.52] people that when they get that stress
[479.12 - 483.44] when they're under that kind of
[480.52 - 486.60] emotional turmoil whatever it is what
[483.44 - 488.04] happens is they get the flu or they get
[486.60 - 492.40] you know something else or they get the
[488.04 - 494.28] c or RSV or something like that so okay
[492.40 - 496.04] so let's make some new immune cells
[494.28 - 499.32] right here okay we got your immune cells
[496.04 - 501.96] this is your bloodstream right here all
[499.32 - 505.00] right there's a reason why I'm talking
[501.96 - 508.00] about this we can help protect immune
[505.00 - 509.88] cells we can also put things in us that
[508.00 - 511.76] protect us in a lot of other ways but we
[509.88 - 513.80] can protect our immune cells our immune
[511.76 - 516.92] system there's a way to do it so when
[513.80 - 519.76] we're going through ups and downs where
[516.92 - 521.92] we are protected when we're going
[519.76 - 524.00] through ups and downs if we're dealing
[521.92 - 526.48] with any kind of psychological abuse any
[524.00 - 529.48] kind of mental abuse any kind of serious
[526.48 - 532.36] gaslighting we're up against any kind of
[529.48 - 535.44] bullies that we're up against yep
[532.36 - 538.08] anything like that any other difficult
[535.44 - 541.16] um struggles at all we can protect our
[538.08 - 544.32] immune cells so they don't get scorched
[541.16 - 547.84] to death so they don't get scorched and
[544.32 - 550.08] die quickly so immune cells get scorched
[547.84 - 552.44] and die quickly what happens is when you
[550.08 - 554.96] start protecting your immune cell your
[552.44 - 556.64] immune system and you start putting
[554.96 - 559.12] things inside of you that protect your
[556.64 - 561.64] immune system you make your immune cells
[559.12 - 564.84] strong you also help to produce more
[561.64 - 565.76] immune cells and more immune cells so
[564.84 - 570.44] over
[565.76 - 573.20] here what you see right here okay
[570.44 - 574.44] is I'm just putting this green right
[573.20 - 577.96] here
[574.44 - 580.80] okay that's bone mirrow all
[577.96 - 583.60] right that's some bone marrow right
[580.80 - 584.92] there there's some bone marrow might not
[583.60 - 587.96] even be able to see that there's some
[584.92 - 589.16] bone marrow all right maybe you guys
[587.96 - 592.60] can't see
[589.16 - 596.08] that okay immune
[592.60 - 598.64] cells many of them get produced out of
[596.08 - 601.44] the bone marrow your bones producing
[598.64 - 603.28] immune cells you see this there's the
[601.44 - 604.92] immune cells being produced out of your
[603.28 - 607.68] bone
[604.92 - 609.96] marrow as immune cells are being scored
[607.68 - 610.96] and dying off from adrenaline shooting
[609.96 - 614.52] into the
[610.96 - 618.08] bloodstream okay your bones go into
[614.52 - 621.56] overdrive to produce new immune
[618.08 - 623.96] cells so those immune cells eventually
[621.56 - 626.80] get back into the bloodstream like right
[623.96 - 629.00] here all
[626.80 - 632.44] right what happens when we go through a
[629.00 - 634.36] mar emotional hardships we lose sleep we
[632.44 - 637.48] don't sleep good we're under emotional
[634.36 - 641.64] turmoil we don't get a lot of sleep our
[637.48 - 643.96] immune system tends to drop it loses a
[641.64 - 645.84] lot of its strength okay that's why I
[643.96 - 648.16] like to tell family you got to be on the
[645.84 - 650.52] propolis every day is maintenance not
[648.16 - 654.20] just when you catch something or you got
[650.52 - 657.12] a cold sore okay or you got a canker
[654.20 - 659.52] sore or something like that it's about
[657.12 - 662.28] maintenance because you don't know when
[659.52 - 665.24] you're going to get whacked you don't
[662.28 - 666.76] know that's how it works when we're up
[665.24 - 668.40] against different things and we're up
[666.76 - 670.60] against different turmoil our emotional
[668.40 - 672.40] struggles it comes and goes it's like a
[670.60 - 674.32] roller coaster ride right why do you
[672.40 - 676.20] think people say relationships are like
[674.32 - 677.84] roller coaster rides a lot of people
[676.20 - 679.24] have said that over the years right
[677.84 - 680.96] where it's like you're going up and then
[679.24 - 682.76] you're going down relationships some
[680.96 - 684.96] relationships could be just friendships
[682.76 - 686.60] could be like everything's going great
[684.96 - 689.32] everything's going great and everybody's
[686.60 - 690.96] going up great up up up they're all
[689.32 - 692.20] going up and then they're at the top
[690.96 - 693.96] there and all of a sudden something
[692.20 - 695.92] plateaus and somebody says something
[693.96 - 698.80] stupid and
[695.92 - 701.04] then everybody's going down like
[698.80 - 702.76] that and then they go back oh we're
[701.04 - 704.64] making up we're making up friends
[702.76 - 706.40] friends are making up things seem to be
[704.64 - 708.00] okay status quo everything's okay
[706.40 - 709.80] balance them you're going up there all
[708.00 - 711.00] of a sudden plateauing something says
[709.80 - 712.36] somebody says something terrible
[711.00 - 716.00] something happens and everybody's going
[712.36 - 718.68] to scream I hate you I hate you and
[716.00 - 720.08] they're down here that roller coaster
[718.68 - 722.84] ride
[720.08 - 725.48] is really difficult on the immune system
[722.84 - 727.08] that's why maintenance is critical Bri

[814.04 - 819.76] claw I have people that I know that are
[817.16 - 822.00] just they're living on cat's claw
[819.76 - 824.80] they're living on cat's claw because of
[822.00 - 826.84] the very same thing where they can't
[824.80 - 828.68] they they they picked up a lot of bugs
[826.84 - 830.48] throughout their life they've got a lot
[828.68 - 832.60] of bugs throughout their life and
[830.48 - 835.20] they've got a lot of exposures their
[832.60 - 837.96] immune system was up against a lot and
[835.20 - 840.76] they actually have to be on cat's claw
[837.96 - 843.16] every day to to keep them stable they
[840.76 - 845.32] had Lyme disease diagnosis they've had
[843.16 - 847.28] this diagnosis that diagnosis they've
[845.32 - 849.24] been to all kinds of doctors they've
[847.28 - 852.92] seen all kinds of people and their
[849.24 - 854.92] doctors are okay with them taking the
[852.92 - 856.64] cat's claw the doctors are okay with
[854.92 - 858.92] them taking the cat's claw and they got
[856.64 - 860.52] to be on cat's claw I know people that
[858.92 - 862.96] actually have to take the cat's claw
[860.52 - 865.76] every day to keep that immune Health
[862.96 - 867.80] strong to keep it nice and strong so get
[865.76 - 869.28] back to it a little bit you guys right
[867.80 - 871.20] here I got propolis I'll talk a a little
[869.28 - 872.96] bit about that I got the cats claw right
[871.20 - 875.40] here and then total immune those three
[872.96 - 877.64] are from viy that's the brand I trust
[875.40 - 879.56] and there's a reason because guess what
[877.64 - 883.36] when everybody had alcohol and all their
[879.56 - 885.64] crap they didn't people have all these
[883.36 - 886.76] percentages of undisclosed ingredients
[885.64 - 890.04] you don't know about in all their
[886.76 - 891.96] supplements they won't do that it's
[890.04 - 893.28] incredible really anyway so let's go to
[891.96 - 896.16] you got your bloodstream here you got
[893.28 - 898.20] your bloodstream here adrenaline rushing
[896.16 - 901.16] in here comes the adrenaline it's
[898.20 - 903.32] rushing in right you were given some bad
[901.16 - 906.12] news maybe you're going through some
[903.32 - 908.60] mental abuse maybe just anything you're
[906.12 - 911.72] having a bad day maybe you're nervous
[908.60 - 914.04] about something and you're worried and
[911.72 - 916.92] then those adrenals are releasing
[914.04 - 918.80] adrenaline the adrenaline is getting
[916.92 - 921.28] sucked right up into the veins and
[918.80 - 924.08] arteries and getting in there and then
[921.28 - 926.28] it's hitting the immune cells it's
[924.08 - 929.00] hitting the immune cells right here so
[926.28 - 930.84] you got the adrenaline hitting the
[929.00 - 933.44] immune cells here's an immune cell right
[930.84 - 936.40] there and here's the adrenaline rushing
[933.44 - 938.60] the adrenaline rushes and boom hits the
[936.40 - 941.76] immune cell right there the immune cell
[938.60 - 945.36] weakens because that's fight or flight
[941.76 - 947.52] adrenaline it's corrosive it's Burns see
[945.36 - 949.92] that right there you got an immune cell
[947.52 - 952.52] right here here comes the adrenaline got
[949.92 - 955.48] some bad news I trusted you you totally
[952.52 - 958.28] screwed me over here it goes adrenaline
[955.48 - 961.64] boom hits that immune cell the immune
[958.28 - 963.68] cell takes a hit and it gets scorched
[961.64 - 966.56] okay now there's a lot of immune cells
[963.68 - 968.00] you have in your body that will sustain
[966.56 - 970.20] they will be able to sustain the
[968.00 - 971.96] scorching but there are a lot of immune
[970.20 - 973.80] cells different varieties of immune
[971.96 - 977.40] cells that don't
[973.80 - 979.56] sustain they don't and then overdrive
[977.40 - 981.44] your bones right here here's your bones
[979.56 - 983.84] producing more immune cells there it
[981.44 - 986.52] goes that's your bones right there the
[983.84 - 989.56] femur whatever any bone your hip bone
[986.52 - 992.16] whatever there it is okay that's your
[989.56 - 994.12] bones we'll make more bones over here
[992.16 - 996.88] like that those are your bones that's
[994.12 - 999.48] your bone Miro bone mirrow okay there
[996.88 - 1002.12] you go immune
[999.48 - 1004.20] cells producing where do those immune
[1002.12 - 1006.84] cells go they go right into the
[1004.20 - 1008.24] bloodstream right from your bones right
[1006.84 - 1010.96] into your bloodstream right in your
[1008.24 - 1013.08] bones you're up against a new emotional
[1010.96 - 1016.12] experience you're up against new
[1013.08 - 1018.72] emotional trouble okay once again here
[1016.12 - 1021.40] comes the adrenaline rushing in here it
[1018.72 - 1024.32] go goes and it's hitting these immune
[1021.40 - 1026.92] cells adrenaline hits these immune cells
[1024.32 - 1031.28] okay and that's why maintenance is
[1026.92 - 1033.72] critical you guys maintenance is
[1031.28 - 1037.12] critical you can go through something
[1033.72 - 1039.72] that seems mild to someone else someone
[1037.12 - 1042.88] could get into a really bad car crash
[1039.72 - 1045.64] they're in life support for a month they
[1042.88 - 1048.48] come out they recover they're still in
[1045.64 - 1049.80] bad shape nothing seems to bug them
[1048.48 - 1052.24] anymore
[1049.80 - 1053.56] after what they went through okay in
[1052.24 - 1056.64] that car
[1053.56 - 1058.00] crash and and so it takes a lot to maybe
[1056.64 - 1059.64] really shake them up because they've
[1058.00 - 1062.80] been there they've been in that car
[1059.64 - 1064.60] crash and then you take somebody who it
[1062.80 - 1067.64] seems like everything is good there's
[1064.60 - 1070.20] silver spoonfed everything's happy and
[1067.64 - 1072.00] then little things get to them little
[1070.20 - 1074.72] things because they seeming seemingly
[1072.00 - 1076.36] have a protective cushy life and then
[1074.72 - 1078.84] little things like my friend just called
[1076.36 - 1081.24] me an [ __ ] and they Shake they're
[1078.84 - 1082.52] shaking over it they're so pissed at
[1081.24 - 1084.32] this one friend meanwhile that person
[1082.52 - 1086.80] who got to a car crash they're on life
[1084.32 - 1089.64] support for a month that's a joke to
[1086.80 - 1092.48] them that's a joke but either whether
[1089.64 - 1094.56] it's small or large what happens is your
[1092.48 - 1096.24] adrenaline can still rush into your
[1094.56 - 1097.84] bloodstream all the same that's the
[1096.24 - 1099.64] point I'm trying to make right here you
[1097.84 - 1101.04] can have somebody where life is going
[1099.64 - 1102.92] good I'm not going through any real
[1101.04 - 1105.20] trauma but then they're getting really
[1102.92 - 1107.68] upset over little things if it isn't
[1105.20 - 1109.24] just right and I understand that
[1107.68 - 1112.24] situation too because then that goes
[1109.24 - 1113.84] into also some OCD as well and then that
[1112.24 - 1115.92] could be really triggering too but
[1113.84 - 1117.52] either way adrenaline can Rush In on
[1115.92 - 1118.84] what someone might think is a really
[1117.52 - 1121.80] small thing and somebody might think is
[1118.84 - 1123.52] a really big thing right I got so Terry
[1121.80 - 1126.80] young says I got my life back a few
[1123.52 - 1129.64] years ago using his protocol
[1126.80 - 1132.00] incredible that's that's incredible so
[1129.64 - 1134.56] let's see what do you think trying to
[1132.00 - 1137.20] look here all right how often should you
[1134.56 - 1138.80] take these products for maintenance so
[1137.20 - 1140.24] ask your doctor what's right for you

[1344.96 - 1349.84] patients heavy heavy antibiotic
[1347.56 - 1351.96] therapies and and I heard it all the

[1400.00 - 1403.52] quick right so we got a bloodstream
[1402.80 - 1406.96] right
[1403.52 - 1409.80] here okay all
[1406.96 - 1412.68] right let's make some immune cells nice
[1409.80 - 1417.20] big immune cells right here you guys can
[1412.68 - 1420.52] see this right why should you do
[1417.20 - 1425.68] maintenance why should you
[1420.52 - 1427.48] care should you even care you guys
[1425.68 - 1429.96] should you even
[1427.48 - 1432.48] care all right let's get some bone
[1429.96 - 1437.28] marrow let's get some bone marrow over
[1432.48 - 1438.92] here that's right your bone marrow get a
[1437.28 - 1440.76] little bit of that can you guys see that
[1438.92 - 1442.36] it's kind of hard to see a little bit

[1442.36 - 1448.20] too does that
[1445.12 - 1452.92] help little bone marrow right there okay
[1448.20 - 1456.56] there's your immune cells okay toxins
[1452.92 - 1459.76] poisons herbicides pesticides fungicides
[1456.56 - 1463.16] stuff raining out of the sky right sea
[1459.76 - 1467.16] Trails dropping out of the sky
[1463.16 - 1469.36] okay fabric softeners drier dust
[1467.16 - 1472.80] floating in every single neighborhood
[1469.36 - 1476.96] coming out of Apartments all those
[1472.80 - 1479.76] highly highly dangerously charged
[1476.96 - 1482.32] chemical concoctions people are using in
[1479.76 - 1484.60] their laundry in their laundry you think
[1482.32 - 1486.68] your immune system likes that do would
[1484.60 - 1492.08] think do we think our immune system
[1486.68 - 1495.68] loves all that chemical charged highly
[1492.08 - 1498.88] toxic chem you know the kind that lasts
[1495.68 - 1501.88] forever now it's like the sent
[1498.88 - 1504.52] from this fabric softener only gets
[1501.88 - 1507.12] stronger as you touch your clothing so
[1504.52 - 1510.16] all you got to do is touch your clothing
[1507.12 - 1512.40] and the smell from that fabric softener
[1510.16 - 1516.44] or that detergent just comes out even
[1512.40 - 1517.96] more fragrances and more fragrances okay
[1516.44 - 1519.68] all the different stuff we're exposed to
[1517.96 - 1521.52] you go to the gas station you're pumping
[1519.68 - 1524.16] your gas you're breathing in those gas
[1521.52 - 1526.96] fumes are you standing right there by

[1530.52 - 1534.84] fuel that highly toxic petrol fuel all
[1533.32 - 1535.88] goes into the bloodstream so let's do
[1534.84 - 1538.76] this
[1535.88 - 1540.56] okay as all that's going into the

[1786.56 - 1792.60] immune cells are dying watch this now
[1789.52 - 1795.12] your bone marrow is producing overdrive
[1792.60 - 1798.52] bone marrow we need some we need some
[1795.12 - 1801.56] immune cells fast immune cells r rush
[1798.52 - 1804.16] into the bloodstream here we go but
[1801.56 - 1807.88] guess what we don't know how to protect
[1804.16 - 1809.52] your immune cells new immune cells go in
[1807.88 - 1812.00] and then the chemicals start killing
[1809.52 - 1814.28] them off again there we go killing them
[1812.00 - 1817.44] off just like
[1814.28 - 1819.04] that and that's how it works every day
[1817.44 - 1822.16] people's immune systems are struggling
[1819.04 - 1824.76] and then what happens is all of a sudden
[1822.16 - 1828.68] that's right all of a
[1824.76 - 1831.20] sudden an Invader comes in you just got
[1828.68 - 1833.16] exposed to the flu you're down and out
[1831.20 - 1835.00] you got all this chemical exposure it's
[1833.16 - 1838.60] in your bloodstream it's knocking out
[1835.00 - 1840.88] immune cells and then just by chance do
[1838.60 - 1843.04] you want to call it happen stance do you
[1840.88 - 1847.04] want to call it by luck do you want to
[1843.04 - 1850.28] call it just bummer luck you get exposed
[1847.04 - 1852.96] to a flu here you go right there and now
[1850.28 - 1855.52] you got a flu bug right there you just
[1852.96 - 1858.32] got exposed you were somewhere and you
[1855.52 - 1860.00] got exposed you took a nice deep breath
[1858.32 - 1863.44] at a yoga
[1860.00 - 1867.00] class nice deep breath in a yoga
[1863.44 - 1869.32] class and everybody went breathe in and
[1867.00 - 1871.20] everybody was breathing in and the flu
[1869.32 - 1873.96] virus was floating around in that little
[1871.20 - 1877.32] room and everybody was exhaling and then
[1873.96 - 1880.52] you're breathing in and now between the
[1877.32 - 1883.00] chemical exposure and the adrenaline
[1880.52 - 1885.32] exposure and then you bring in that flu
[1883.00 - 1887.12] bug now you're in the flu bug mode it
[1885.32 - 1888.80] gets into the bloodstream and now you
[1887.12 - 1890.52] got the flu bug in your bloodstream and
[1888.80 - 1893.52] guess what your immune system is
[1890.52 - 1895.68] weakened so the flu kicks your butt
[1893.52 - 1898.48] you're coughing your guts out it's
[1895.68 - 1898.48] getting into your
[1898.80 - 1904.28] lungs and then you hear about everything
[1901.92 - 1906.12] else happening to people these days the
[1904.28 - 1907.36] amount of stuff people are going through
[1906.12 - 1909.88] with their health because their immune
[1907.36 - 1914.24] systems are down we have to do
[1909.88 - 1918.84] maintenance we have to do defensive
[1914.24 - 1921.56] maintenance it is critical at this time
[1918.84 - 1924.20] stuff's happening really fast people are
[1921.56 - 1926.32] getting sicker than ever I know that the
[1924.20 - 1928.00] media hides it too and they make it look
[1926.32 - 1930.32] like everybody's fine and everybody's

[2058.00 - 2062.04] doing this for
[2059.56 - 2064.36] yourself now listen when it comes down
[2062.04 - 2066.24] to things like oral health I have
[2064.36 - 2068.40] friends and family that put the propolis
[2066.24 - 2070.08] pure right in their mouth
[2068.40 - 2072.96] that's what they do and they let it sit
[2070.08 - 2074.80] in there and then they swallow it so
[2072.96 - 2077.68] they put the Puris pure right in their
[2074.80 - 2079.72] mouth direct right in so have friends
[2077.68 - 2081.84] and family they're putting it directly
[2079.72 - 2084.52] right in and they're letting it sit in
[2081.84 - 2087.44] there especially if like someone's got
[2084.52 - 2089.68] like some some kind of like sore ulcer
[2087.44 - 2091.72] in there in the mouth anything like that
[2089.68 - 2094.40] I tell friends and family you go to the
[2091.72 - 2096.88] dentist you do any kind of dental
[2094.40 - 2098.60] work you should be on the prob list you
[2096.88 - 2100.68] come back from the dent denst from
[2098.60 - 2103.24] cleanings from any kind of thing that
[2100.68 - 2104.72] you're getting done any polishing
[2103.24 - 2107.36] whatever it is that you're going to the
[2104.72 - 2109.20] dentist for or you get any work at the
[2107.36 - 2110.40] dentist office done to your teeth in
[2109.20 - 2113.28] your
[2110.40 - 2115.24] mouth propolis they got to be on
[2113.28 - 2117.20] propolis after you come back from the
[2115.24 - 2118.72] dentist you're taking propolis and
[2117.20 - 2121.76] you're taking it every single day for a
[2118.72 - 2123.24] while a so you don't catch a flu or
[2121.76 - 2126.60] something else what happens in the
[2123.24 - 2128.96] dentist office it's easy to catch a lot
[2126.60 - 2131.00] of different bugs from the drills and
[2128.96 - 2133.20] the tools things because of people
[2131.00 - 2134.36] touching things like the lamp the light
[2133.20 - 2136.84] because they're touching this they're
[2134.36 - 2139.88] touching that what I tell friends and
[2136.84 - 2142.20] family you tell the dentist or the or
[2139.88 - 2144.56] the the hygienist you tell them to
[2142.20 - 2146.32] change out their gloves because they're
[2144.56 - 2149.12] putting gloves on but they're putting
[2146.32 - 2151.52] gloves on to protect their hands from
[2149.12 - 2153.32] you they're protecting themselves from
[2151.52 - 2155.64] you they're not putting gloves on
[2153.32 - 2157.28] technically to protect you when they
[2155.64 - 2160.56] have their hands in your mouth they're
[2157.28 - 2162.92] putting gloves on to protect themselves
[2160.56 - 2164.68] from you keep that in mind so what
[2162.92 - 2166.72] happens is they're touching everything
[2164.68 - 2168.24] they're doing this and that and I I I'll
[2166.72 - 2169.28] tell family you tell them to change
[2168.24 - 2170.68] their gloves a couple of times
[2169.28 - 2172.32] throughout the process if they're like
[2170.68 - 2174.96] well they're 50 cents a glove you pay
[2172.32 - 2177.20] for it you pay for it anyway that's the
[2174.96 - 2178.96] propolis after dental work after oral
[2177.20 - 2180.96] work any kind of stuff like that oral
[2178.96 - 2182.64] surgery I mean ask your dentist what's
[2180.96 - 2184.92] right for you but I tell friends and
[2182.64 - 2186.40] family you got to be on propolis you got
[2184.92 - 2188.88] to be on
[2186.40 - 2191.72] propolis is is it okay to
[2188.88 - 2194.16] take wild the blueberry is shot right
[2191.72 - 2196.88] after yes it is
[2194.16 - 2199.32] definitely it's what I would
[2196.88 - 2201.24] do okay so we're going into propolis a
[2199.32 - 2206.12] little bit we're going into cat's
[2201.24 - 2210.00] claw so what I love about cat's Claw is
[2206.12 - 2214.56] it's like an immune system
[2210.00 - 2217.92] modulator so it doesn't tend to wear off
[2214.56 - 2221.32] it won't wear off your system doesn't
[2217.92 - 2225.16] get used to it right because you're on
[2221.32 - 2229.16] it every day it's a immune system
[2225.16 - 2232.00] enhancer but modulator keeps everything
[2229.16 - 2234.84] balanced so it's like that defensive
[2232.00 - 2238.60] nature keeping things balanced it's what
[2234.84 - 2240.04] I love about cat's claw all right and so
[2238.60 - 2241.20] many people they're up against so much
[2240.04 - 2242.80] out there I mean you guys see it out
[2241.20 - 2245.08] there like everything from autoimmune
[2242.80 - 2247.68] Under the Sun so many people are dealing
[2245.08 - 2249.24] with stuff all that is immune system
[2247.68 - 2252.56] that's how it
[2249.24 - 2255.56] works because that's what went
[2252.56 - 2258.24] wrong something had to have gone wrong
[2255.56 - 2260.60] first if they got viral or they got any
[2258.24 - 2263.20] kind of pathogens or any kind of bugs
[2260.60 - 2266.44] it's because their immune system wasn't
[2263.20 - 2267.56] handling it properly if they're sick and
[2266.44 - 2269.12] they got all kinds of different
[2267.56 - 2270.40] conditions that's because their immune
[2269.12 - 2271.80] system is struggling you see how it
[2270.40 - 2274.28] works you guys Hill over there on
[2271.80 - 2278.24] YouTube says vimer pure propolis was a
[2274.28 - 2281.04] huge game Cher for me with my head in
[2278.24 - 2283.44] thank you aw and
[2281.04 - 2285.40] so when people come to me friends and
[2283.44 - 2288.12] family come to me guys and they say what
[2285.40 - 2291.20] does aw think about this what does a aw
[2288.12 - 2295.04] think about doing this and and I sound
[2291.20 - 2298.56] like a broken record I'm like propolis
[2295.04 - 2302.00] propolis why are you not on the propolis
[2298.56 - 2305.32] the stuff is is god-given gifted
[2302.00 - 2307.76] Heavenly scent it is unbelievable it's
[2305.32 - 2310.04] the combination of Supernatural Mother
[2307.76 - 2312.32] Nature Supernatural God it's a
[2310.04 - 2315.72] combination of all of that to be in our
[2312.32 - 2315.72] hands right now in this day and
[2315.96 - 2320.16] age and you got to think about something
[2318.20 - 2323.08] like with the propolis you got the bees
[2320.16 - 2326.72] Gathering nectar and and and right
[2323.08 - 2328.48] pollen from so many different species so
[2326.72 - 2331.12] many different flowers from so many
[2328.48 - 2333.96] different species with all kinds of
[2331.12 - 2336.36] hundreds of micronutrients like hundreds
[2333.96 - 2338.76] of phytochemical compounds per species
[2336.36 - 2341.84] right and they're all bringing that
[2338.76 - 2343.44] back right and then they spackle up some
[2341.84 - 2346.40] propolis the bees spackle up some
[2343.44 - 2348.56] propolis they use it as a protected
[2346.40 - 2352.00] inside the hive to glue the hive
[2348.56 - 2354.40] together but it's also antiseptic right
[2352.00 - 2357.60] it's a protected it's like the protector
[2354.40 - 2358.64] the defense mechanism for the Beehive
[2357.60 - 2361.12] it's
[2358.64 - 2365.12] incredible and vimergy does it in such a
[2361.12 - 2368.44] way they use a process that is so clean
[2365.12 - 2370.76] and so pure and so good for the bees
[2368.44 - 2373.68] that I can't trust anybody's propolis
[2370.76 - 2375.56] out there there's no way I can't I can't
[2373.68 - 2377.60] thumbs up for the best it is the best
[2375.56 - 2379.36] stuff so you guys we're talking about
[2377.60 - 2380.88] the immune system we're talking about
[2379.36 - 2382.48] all that let me just clear the board for
[2380.88 - 2384.76] another second you guys have another few
[2382.48 - 2387.60] minutes to learn some
[2384.76 - 2391.00] stuff you guys up for that at all you
[2387.60 - 2391.00] guys got you guys got a couple more
[2391.52 - 2397.40] minutes all right we just clear this
[2393.64 - 2397.40] board off a little bit
[2398.80 - 2405.44] all
[2400.40 - 2409.08] right we're back okay all right
[2405.44 - 2410.96] bloodstream again bloodstream there you
[2409.08 - 2413.20] go
[2410.96 - 2416.00] okay all
[2413.20 - 2419.80] right immune
[2416.00 - 2422.28] cells yep there they
[2419.80 - 2425.00] are immune cells you know what their job
[2422.28 - 2428.04] is your immune cells their job is to
[2425.00 - 2430.80] collect debris get ready
[2428.04 - 2432.60] that's right everybody's bloodstream
[2430.80 - 2435.28] ends up getting dirty dirty blood
[2432.60 - 2437.28] Syndrome from debris so what kind of
[2435.28 - 2440.88] debris are we talking about we're
[2437.28 - 2442.48] talking about everything from plaque
[2440.88 - 2445.40] From Plaque
[2442.48 - 2447.44] deposits even younger people we're
[2445.40 - 2449.96] talking about toxic
[2447.44 - 2452.76] calcium yeah toxic
[2449.96 - 2456.96] calcium building up in here we're
[2452.76 - 2459.52] talking about debris solids it's called
[2456.96 - 2462.60] our bloodstream is not supposed to be
[2459.52 - 2465.48] filled up entirely with solids it's only
[2462.60 - 2468.28] supposed to be partial solids in the
[2465.48 - 2470.56] form of micro minerals macrominerals
[2468.28 - 2473.68] trace minerals but our bloodstreams get
[2470.56 - 2475.44] dirty because of our stagnant livers and
[2473.68 - 2479.04] when our bloodstream gets dirty from our
[2475.44 - 2481.52] stagnant livers solids
[2479.04 - 2484.04] accumulate and when they do your IM
[2481.52 - 2486.52] immune system jumps on them you know why
[2484.04 - 2489.20] your immune system jumps on the solids
[2486.52 - 2492.08] do you know why because it has to go and
[2489.20 - 2496.00] break it down and eat it that's what it
[2492.08 - 2498.88] has to do our bloodstream gets filled
[2496.00 - 2501.28] with solids that aren't supposed to be
[2498.88 - 2505.44] there and then our immune system has to
[2501.28 - 2506.72] gobble it up and consume it and eat it
[2505.44 - 2509.76] and guess what happens to our immune
[2506.72 - 2511.12] system it weakens every day our immune
[2509.76 - 2514.52] system
[2511.12 - 2517.56] weakens and then it dies it dies off in
[2514.52 - 2519.56] our bloodstream and then once again you
[2517.56 - 2522.60] got your marrow over here your bone
[2519.56 - 2524.36] marrow it's overdrive your bone marrow
[2522.60 - 2528.16] is an overdrive trying to produce immune
[2524.36 - 2531.88] cells to eat up solids that's
[2528.16 - 2534.68] right dirty blood syndrome beats down
[2531.88 - 2537.84] the immune cells we have to protect our
[2534.68 - 2540.28] immune cells it is critical that's why
[2537.84 - 2541.64] what I believe in from what Spirit of
[2540.28 - 2543.64] compassion has taught me throughout my
[2541.64 - 2546.48] life is you got to have a maintenance
[2543.64 - 2547.88] immune system plann you have to have it
[2546.48 - 2550.76] everyday
[2547.88 - 2553.16] a maintenance immune system plan that's
[2550.76 - 2555.64] what we have to that's what we have to
[2553.16 - 2558.76] okay put something up there in the
[2555.64 - 2562.84] tech it's critical for people to
[2558.76 - 2565.76] understand this maintenance is critical
[2562.84 - 2566.95] big piece of it all on its own all right
[2565.76 - 2568.76] so let's
[2566.95 - 2571.96] [Music]
[2568.76 - 2571.96] go all
[2573.28 - 2579.24] right lymphatic system how many of you
[2576.76 - 2581.64] guys are in into the lymphatic system
[2579.24 - 2584.92] okay that's your
[2581.64 - 2588.48] lymphocytes lymphocyte production
[2584.92 - 2590.00] lymphatic system okay everybody's trying
[2588.48 - 2591.36] to drain their lymphatic system
[2590.00 - 2592.84] everybody's trying to get lymphatic
[2591.36 - 2594.84] drainage everybody's talking about their
[2592.84 - 2597.40] lymphatic system everybody's talking
[2594.84 - 2598.92] about lymphatic drainage there's tools
[2597.40 - 2601.68] out there trying to drain people's
[2598.92 - 2604.36] lymphatic systems but guess what they're
[2601.68 - 2606.88] not talking about they're not talking
[2604.36 - 2608.88] about how to keep your lymphocytes
[2606.88 - 2611.92] strong
[2608.88 - 2613.08] you can play with your lymphatic system
[2611.92 - 2615.64] all day
[2613.08 - 2617.20] long and if you don't clean up the liver
[2615.64 - 2619.40] and the liver stagnant and sluggish the
[2617.20 - 2621.08] lymphatic system blows right up the next
[2619.40 - 2622.24] day or or three hours later do you ever
[2621.08 - 2623.92] see that when someone comes out of
[2622.24 - 2626.80] lymphatic drainage massage but at the
[2623.92 - 2629.68] end of the day they're like this
[2626.80 - 2632.20] again just spend $300 and I'm like this
[2629.68 - 2635.00] again okay I better go back tomorrow and
[2632.20 - 2636.28] do it all over again because their liver
[2635.00 - 2637.72] is stagnant and sluggish they're not
[2636.28 - 2639.84] addressing the liver so they're
[2637.72 - 2641.12] constantly battling the lymphatic system
[2639.84 - 2644.76] but let's talk about the most important
[2641.12 - 2647.64] part about this lymphatic system means
[2644.76 - 2650.52] lymphocytes those babies are a part of
[2647.64 - 2654.48] your immune system and what happens is
[2650.52 - 2658.20] with lymphocytes they die easy they die
[2654.48 - 2660.20] easy and lymphocyte production becomes
[2658.20 - 2662.52] minimalized because at some point in
[2660.20 - 2665.52] your life it was maximized and it was
[2662.52 - 2667.56] just boom lots of lymphocytes everywhere
[2665.52 - 2670.00] and then slowly over time they were
[2667.56 - 2672.24] broken down they're dying they're beaten
[2670.00 - 2673.96] down and your production is not as
[2672.24 - 2676.76] strong as it was in the
[2673.96 - 2679.44] past and so we need maintenance on
[2676.76 - 2682.56] lymphocytes maintenance to support your
[2679.44 - 2684.92] lymphocytes big piece of how to
[2682.56 - 2686.60] heal I don't talk about the lymphatic
[2684.92 - 2688.88] system every day because I talk about
[2686.60 - 2690.68] the liver the very thing that makes it
[2688.88 - 2692.48] so your lymphatic system gets dirty to
[2690.68 - 2694.48] begin with I don't like doing the
[2692.48 - 2697.20] topical crap I like going to the root
[2694.48 - 2699.12] cause down to really what's going on
[2697.20 - 2700.64] what's causing things if you don't clean
[2699.12 - 2702.04] up your liver your lympha you're going
[2700.64 - 2705.20] to be chasing after your lymphatic
[2702.04 - 2707.28] system the rest of your life you are if
[2705.20 - 2708.96] you don't clean that sluggish stagnant
[2707.28 - 2710.96] toxic liver up you're going to be
[2708.96 - 2712.44] chasing after your lymphatic system
[2710.96 - 2716.04] rainbows you're going to be chasing your
[2712.44 - 2717.60] tail chasing your tail chasing your tail
[2716.04 - 2719.20] but one thing people don't realize
[2717.60 - 2721.32] overall with the lymphatic system it's
[2719.20 - 2723.12] the lymphocytes we got to keep those
[2721.32 - 2725.00] strong and if you don't do maintenance
[2723.12 - 2727.28] to keep those strong you can play with
[2725.00 - 2729.16] your lymphatic system all day long get
[2727.28 - 2732.00] drainage do what you want with it talk
[2729.16 - 2733.68] about it take some lympo you know
[2732.00 - 2735.96] lymphatic system supplements whatever
[2733.68 - 2738.40] you want to do but if you don't keep
[2735.96 - 2740.64] your lymphocyte strong you're not doing
[2738.40 - 2742.88] your your lymphatic system
[2740.64 - 2744.40] Justice and that's what it's about so
[2742.88 - 2746.24] right here here's your see this these
[2744.40 - 2751.12] lymph cells right here so I'll point to
[2746.24 - 2753.00] them right here okay all right so here's
[2751.12 - 2755.84] your lymphatic system over here you got
[2753.00 - 2758.64] your lymph lymph nodes or lymph
[2755.84 - 2760.64] lymphatic system right there those are a
[2758.64 - 2763.08] little swollen right here and people
[2760.64 - 2765.52] have swollen lymph nodes all the time
[2763.08 - 2767.84] because why they're lymphatic their
[2765.52 - 2769.08] lymphocytes and their lymphatic system
[2767.84 - 2771.32] are
[2769.08 - 2773.04] struggling you ever did you guys ever
[2771.32 - 2775.96] experience that like a swollen lymph
[2773.04 - 2778.80] node swollen Li node in your neck around
[2775.96 - 2780.44] your throat swollen glands anywhere did
[2778.80 - 2782.72] you ever feel a swollen lip node in your
[2780.44 - 2785.60] groin did you ever feel one in your neck
[2782.72 - 2787.80] somewhere down lower or higher that's
[2785.60 - 2788.76] your lymphatic system your lymphocytes
[2787.80 - 2790.80] and they're
[2788.76 - 2792.28] struggling they're struggling with
[2790.80 - 2794.36] something that they're battling if we
[2792.28 - 2797.00] don't do maintenance we can't protect
[2794.36 - 2800.04] our lymphatic system the lymphocytes in
[2797.00 - 2801.68] our lymphatic system and so what I tell
[2800.04 - 2803.32] friends and family if you're not doing a
[2801.68 - 2805.04] maintenance plan then what are you
[2803.32 - 2807.32] really doing for your lymphatics so well
[2805.04 - 2809.24] I'm getting lymphatic drainage three
[2807.32 - 2811.04] times you know a week that's what I'm
[2809.24 - 2812.80] doing but are you protecting your
[2811.04 - 2815.20] lymphatics immune system because if
[2812.80 - 2817.52] you're not protecting that then you're
[2815.20 - 2821.12] not truly really protecting
[2817.52 - 2824.28] yourself if you're not protecting your
[2821.12 - 2826.08] lymphocytes if you're not doing that
[2824.28 - 2828.40] then you're not really protecting
[2826.08 - 2830.44] yourself and then what what do I do what
[2828.40 - 2832.32] do I do prop list I told you about the
[2830.44 - 2833.92] prop list oh that's right I didn't order
[2832.32 - 2837.84] it the
[2833.92 - 2841.48] propolis critical to be on some kind of
[2837.84 - 2844.00] immune system maintenance program every
[2841.48 - 2847.00] day if your doctor says it's right for
[2844.00 - 2847.00] you
[2848.12 - 2852.68] it's a big deal so we just I'll just
[2850.04 - 2855.64] recap on stuff a little bit so let's do
[2852.68 - 2858.48] that talked about emotional termoil how
[2855.64 - 2860.96] adrenaline gets exploded into the system
[2858.48 - 2862.32] how it weakens the immune cells talked
[2860.96 - 2864.36] about all kinds of air freshers
[2862.32 - 2866.92] fragrances all kinds of drier dust all
[2864.36 - 2869.32] the fabric softeners the detergents
[2866.92 - 2871.44] right the the scented candles the Clones
[2869.32 - 2874.44] the perfumes and all that all that stuff
[2871.44 - 2877.00] destroys our immune system gets into our
[2874.44 - 2878.84] bloodstream right I talked about solid
[2877.00 - 2880.72] coming into the bloodstream from all the
[2878.84 - 2882.84] junk and the garbage built up eating
[2880.72 - 2884.36] away our immune system Katherine over
[2882.84 - 2887.16] there [ __ ] says I'm coming from
[2884.36 - 2892.08] Connecticut to meet you next month that
[2887.16 - 2893.80] is incredible I will be in person yes I

[2918.72 - 2923.76] right incredible you guys when it comes
[2922.24 - 2926.48] down to our immune system we have to
[2923.76 - 2929.48] give it love we have to give it TLC we
[2926.48 - 2932.16] have to look out for it and I don't want
[2929.48 - 2933.52] to sound like a broken record but I see
[2932.16 - 2935.48] people they just they're not taking care
[2933.52 - 2939.20] of their immune systems and then they
[2935.48 - 2940.72] get sick then they get fibro they get Ms
[2939.20 - 2943.68] they get Tinkles and numbness ringing in
[2940.72 - 2945.28] the ears tentis vertigo they get dizzy
[2943.68 - 2946.76] spells they get the balance problems
[2945.28 - 2948.04] they get the tightness of the chest they
[2946.76 - 2949.96] get the pain in the neck they get the
[2948.04 - 2952.16] migraines they get the back problems the
[2949.96 - 2953.64] sciatic pain they get planter fasciitis
[2952.16 - 2955.52] they get all kinds of different spasms
[2953.64 - 2957.00] and cramps their immune system is
[2955.52 - 2959.36] struggling they get all kinds of
[2957.00 - 2960.64] different vibrations and Tremors and all
[2959.36 - 2962.40] kinds of different neurological problems
[2960.64 - 2964.68] they got fatigue they can't function
[2962.40 - 2966.76] their jaw hurts trigeminal neuralgia
[2964.68 - 2968.56] they have all this going on out there
[2966.76 - 2970.00] every single day and they're not taking
[2968.56 - 2971.96] care of their immune system and they're
[2970.00 - 2975.08] not on a maintenance
[2971.96 - 2978.28] plan and it's painful to watch it's
[2975.08 - 2979.72] painful to see because the suffering out
[2978.28 - 2983.00] there is
[2979.72 - 2985.16] horrendous and you see all these good
[2983.00 - 2988.76] people out there and they're all
[2985.16 - 2990.76] struggling with their health because
[2988.76 - 2992.76] they're struggling with their immune
[2990.76 - 2994.48] system check out the link in the
[2992.76 - 2996.92] description there's the total immune
[2994.48 - 2998.60] with the thyme and the Mullen which you
[2996.92 - 3001.08] can't I mean that's incredible the
[2998.60 - 3004.48] propolis pure right there like I said I
[3001.08 - 3006.88] know people they never saw a mouth ulcer
[3004.48 - 3010.00] again canker stur were the size of
[3006.88 - 3012.68] quarters and dimes in their throat the
[3010.00 - 3015.56] doctors were like kerur were in their
[3012.68 - 3017.88] throat they're esophagus you guys it was
[3015.56 - 3020.36] insane and then you got the cat's claw
[3017.88 - 3023.04] right there and I got friends and family
[3020.36 - 3024.92] doing the maintenance doing the
[3023.04 - 3026.88] maintenance that's why I support these
[3024.92 - 3028.88] guys it's the best stuff there is out
[3026.88 - 3031.44] there that's why I support these guys
[3028.88 - 3033.12] there isn't like 20 things in here where
[3031.44 - 3034.56] you're getting ripped off with a little
[3033.12 - 3035.92] bit of this and a little bit of that and
[3034.56 - 3037.12] a little bit of seamos and a little bit
[3035.92 - 3039.36] of this and a little bit of this and a
[3037.12 - 3042.80] little bit of this and you can't get
[3039.36 - 3045.56] better because it's 20 30 things in a
[3042.80 - 3047.44] bottle and all cheap ingredients all
[3045.56 - 3049.32] mixed up in there and your body's like I
[3047.44 - 3051.80] don't even know what you're taking it's
[3049.32 - 3054.04] different when you go Powerhouse and
[3051.80 - 3055.72] you're taking that cat's claw direct and
[3054.04 - 3057.88] you're taking that propolis direct and
[3055.72 - 3060.16] you're taking that total immune direct
[3057.88 - 3062.36] there's a big difference than 50 things
[3060.16 - 3064.40] in one container cuz somebody comes up
[3062.36 - 3065.76] with a brainiac idea and they throw all
[3064.40 - 3067.04] this stuff in here a little bit of this
[3065.76 - 3069.84] little bit of this little bit of this
[3067.04 - 3072.52] here it is when you're doing something
[3069.84 - 3075.80] like this and it's like in this form
[3072.52 - 3077.32] it's another story it's why people can
[3075.80 - 3080.08] get
[3077.32 - 3081.76] better incredible information you guys
[3080.08 - 3083.16] incredible information link is in the
[3081.76 - 3086.68] description check it out so that's vimer
[3083.16 - 3088.72] g v is in Victor i m is in Mary E RG y I

[3088.72 - 3093.88] because that company right there is a
[3090.80 - 3096.32] God send and when you're doing like that
[3093.88 - 3097.76] kind of propolis pure it is Supernatural
[3096.32 - 3099.24] stuff you're talking about you're
[3097.76 - 3101.24] talking about a combination of Mother
[3099.24 - 3103.52] Nature the bees you're talking about
[3101.24 - 3105.44] supernatural forces keeping coren in
[3103.52 - 3106.92] alive you're talking about all of it
[3105.44 - 3110.32] packed in
[3106.92 - 3113.32] that just incredible see
[3110.32 - 3114.88] guys um yeah here's a question right
[3113.32 - 3118.40] here Deborah says if you take total
[3114.88 - 3120.68] immune do you need zinc also right look
[3118.40 - 3123.36] ask your doctor what your doctor thinks
[3120.68 - 3125.52] okay but I have family members on zinc
[3123.36 - 3128.16] separately every day taking a little bit
[3125.52 - 3131.28] of zinc separately and the total immune
[3128.16 - 3133.68] I do I have family members that do both
[3131.28 - 3135.32] because they need the zinc they're up
[3133.68 - 3137.76] against a lot so I do have family
[3135.32 - 3140.28] members that actually take both you know
[3137.76 - 3142.08] I have friends that take both I do I do
[3140.28 - 3145.00] but that's your doctor it's okay for you
[3142.08 - 3148.52] to do that but yes I take the zinc
[3145.00 - 3151.08] myself okay I do I take it every single
[3148.52 - 3152.36] day I take zinc but I also take the
[3151.08 - 3153.76] total immune there's only a little bit
[3152.36 - 3155.64] of zinc in the total immune only a
[3153.76 - 3158.28] little bit I take the total immune
[3155.64 - 3162.20] that's got the time and the Mullen
[3158.28 - 3165.16] incredible Heavenly info Rissa it is it
[3162.20 - 3166.96] is it is so guys I just want to give you
[3165.16 - 3168.56] the rundown on how it works with the
[3166.96 - 3171.08] adrenaline how it works with the with
[3168.56 - 3171.88] the immune system and what we're trying
[3171.08 - 3176.84] to
[3171.88 - 3179.72] do what's the point what's the point
[3176.84 - 3180.88] seriously what is the point if we can't
[3179.72 - 3184.92] take
[3180.88 - 3188.52] care of our immune system and we're just
[3184.92 - 3191.12] being dragged down by sickness because
[3188.52 - 3194.00] we can't keep our immune system stable
[3191.12 - 3196.00] long enough even when people do a little
[3194.00 - 3197.12] something for their immune system and
[3196.00 - 3198.68] whether they know they're doing it or
[3197.12 - 3201.72] not they do a little something for their
[3198.68 - 3204.08] immune system but what if what if they
[3201.72 - 3206.52] did a lot for their immune system and
[3204.08 - 3208.92] longterm like a maintenance where it's
[3206.52 - 3212.48] long term where all of a sudden 6 months
[3208.92 - 3215.44] later the symptom goes away 8 months
[3212.48 - 3217.44] later the symptom goes away four months
[3215.44 - 3219.72] later wait a minute I can't believe it
[3217.44 - 3223.20] but I forgot about that symptom I used
[3219.72 - 3225.64] to have it's gone now it's
[3223.20 - 3227.88] incredible it's things like this that
[3225.64 - 3230.68] matter truly
[3227.88 - 3232.52] does you guys you guys check out my
[3230.68 - 3234.16] medical meem podcast at Apple podcast I

[3261.16 - 3263.84] quality out there it is and people know
[3262.60 - 3265.44] the difference they know the difference
[3263.84 - 3266.80] with vimergy they know what it's like
[3265.44 - 3268.68] when they're taking vmer and they know
[3266.80 - 3270.84] that difference when they take other
[3268.68 - 3271.92] things versus other things and they know
[3270.84 - 3275.20] the
[3271.92 - 3278.20] difference they understand it they know
[3275.20 - 3280.32] it yep what brand uh people everybody's
[3278.20 - 3283.04] asking what brand it's vimergy okay
[3280.32 - 3284.56] these in Victor I am is and Mary E RG y
[3283.04 - 3287.88] That's a propolis pure right there these
[3284.56 - 3289.68] three supplements but you guys it
[3287.88 - 3291.92] matters you know why I support them too
[3289.68 - 3293.24] you know why I actually support BG
[3291.92 - 3295.28] because there's nothing like this on the
[3293.24 - 3298.32] planet and I don't want it to go away I
[3295.28 - 3298.32] don't want it to go away
[3298.36 - 3302.92] because if it goes away and I think
[3300.12 - 3305.56] about the loss of people's like
[3302.92 - 3307.76] opportunities to heal and to move
[3305.56 - 3310.84] forward and protect themselves that
[3307.76 - 3312.60] right there that that just really is sad
[3310.84 - 3314.68] anyway it's one of the reasons why I
[3312.60 - 3316.52] also support him because when
[3314.68 - 3320.04] something's this good you don't want to
[3316.52 - 3321.40] lose it you don't want to lose it that's
[3320.04 - 3323.68] true you guys check out medical meem

[3333.04 - 3336.48] a couple years ago you guys a couple
[3334.84 - 3337.92] years ago the best propolis you could
[3336.48 - 3340.76] ever get out there on the market had
[3337.92 - 3345.00] alcohol in it it would burn your your
[3340.76 - 3347.12] mouth fuzz it up just a few years ago
[3345.00 - 3349.40] the best propolis out there that you can
[3347.12 - 3351.92] get burned your mouth up because it was
[3349.40 - 3351.92] loaded with
[3351.96 - 3359.04] alcohol that's what I mean without viy
[3356.44 - 3361.88] how are we gon to do what we got to do
[3359.04 - 3364.36] just a couple of years ago like the best
[3361.88 - 3366.00] propolis and I see people still using it
[3364.36 - 3367.92] out there the best propolis out there a
[3366.00 - 3369.52] couple years ago it's just it's loaded

[3371.28 - 3376.16] mouth all that

[3376.16 - 3384.36] free but but not just that living cortin
[3381.12 - 3386.80] is in here naturally in the propolis
[3384.36 - 3389.12] living coratin naturally in the propus
