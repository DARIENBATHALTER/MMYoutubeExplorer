1
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:04,400
we're live right now we're live on

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,000
facebook live on youtube

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,960
live on tick tock live on clubhouse and

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,240
i'm going to tell you guys something

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,240
with the gut health thing that's going

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,519
on out there there's some key things to

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,880
know right off the running i'm going to

8
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,320
give them to you okay

9
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:21,359
first of all good bacteria does not

10
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,000
battle with bad bacteria good bacteria

11
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,000
doesn't

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,119
fight bad bacteria bad bacteria

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,240
stays bad and it stays in you and it

14
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,160
doesn't leave

15
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,320
unless you do something to get it out

16
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:38,160
actively get it out right

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,000
so but what everybody's being told

18
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,840
is you gotta up your good bacteria your

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,079
good microorganisms your good bacteria

20
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,360
get all that good bacteria in there

21
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:50,640
but that has nothing to do

22
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,520
with what bad stuff is happening inside

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,199
of you

24
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,280
you can have all the good bacteria you

25
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:58,719
want and you can still pick up more

26
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,199
bad bacteria doesn't matter you can be

27
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,120
filled with good bacteria filled with

28
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:06,560
good microorganisms you guys

29
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,840
and it doesn't change one thing did you

30
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,040
pick up a new bad bacteria did you pick

31
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,840
up a new strap

32
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,920
streptococcus did you pick up more staff

33
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,040
did you pick up a new e coli eating in a

34
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,320
restaurant

35
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:23,040
did you pick up c diff somewhere

36
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,880
right did you kiss somebody and now you

37
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,040
got a new strep

38
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,159
and what happens and what people don't

39
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,880
realize

40
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,520
is that we collect this bad bacteria

41
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,600
yeah

42
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,720
and we can get problems inside our gut

43
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,159
yeah and we can get sick over time

44
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,159
but you can play around with all the

45
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,399
good stuff all you want good bacteria

46
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:45,439
good microorganisms good this good that

47
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,560
it's not going to change a thing it just

48
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,560
isn't

49
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,560
what it is going to change though it's

50
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,600
going to make the empires

51
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:57,280
rich the health empires rich

52
00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:01,520
it's gonna make all the influencers

53
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:04,799
or health pros or podcast doctors

54
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:07,040
rich because it's an age-old

55
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,119
trick an age-old trick that's been

56
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,599
happening for a long time

57
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,480
and it's oh it's all in your gut that's

58
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,800
the problem

59
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,760
you got to get more microorganisms in

60
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,280
there you got

61
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,440
you got to you know this is what you

62
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,080
have to do and

63
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,280
it's an easy like trick it's an easy

64
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,560
psych out

65
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:30,879
it really is but until you learn

66
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:34,080
how to kill off the bad until you learn

67
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:37,120
what that takes or what that entails and

68
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,000
how exposure of getting

69
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,760
new bad stuff inside of you of how to

70
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,720
limit your exposure to

71
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,519
or at least be kicking out the bad stuff

72
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,680
for real

73
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,280
killing off the bad stuff real until you

74
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,599
go there

75
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,959
it ain't gonna matter and that's how it

76
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,680
works and so

77
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,480
right there so that bad bacteria i'm

78
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,959
just saying

79
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,920
right a bad bacteria we're live on tick

80
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,319
tock live on

81
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,040
youtube live on facebook live on

82
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,680
clubhouse

83
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,879
not bad bacteria doesn't care about the

84
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,760
good bacteria

85
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,400
the good microorganisms doesn't care

86
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,120
they don't

87
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,519
battle each other you see that you guys

88
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,560
they

89
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,560
don't fight each other it's not like the

90
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,000
bad bacteria is like whoa i'm going to

91
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,319
go and kill off some more

92
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,920
good bacteria let me go kill them off

93
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,280
let me go do that and it's not like the

94
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,519
good bacteria is going to go

95
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,599
hey i'm going to go attack that scare

96
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,440
away that bad bacteria and make sure

97
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:34,400
that bad bacteria runs

98
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,720
scare it away doesn't work like that but

99
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,360
see

100
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,239
it's an easy psych out good to see you

101
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,959
guys coming on

102
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,560
really really excited that that we're

103
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,400
here right now okay

104
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,599
just want to give you the rundown all

105
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,440
right um

106
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,680
i'm juicing some celery i'm talking

107
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,319
about what the celery does inside your

108
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,760
gut

109
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:56,799
how it's killing off the bad stuff

110
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,519
the bad stuff right

111
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,159
it's leaving the good stuff killing off

112
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,799
the bad

113
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,319
stuff really important to know because

114
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:09,200
bad bacteria runs

115
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:13,120
on a different charge and celery juice

116
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:15,439
destroys bad bacteria right

117
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,720
celery juice doesn't destroy good

118
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:20,000
bacteria

119
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,400
because it runs on a different charge

120
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,680
they don't battle each other they don't

121
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,919
fight each other

122
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,000
but you gotta learn how to get the bad

123
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,800
out it's not about how much good

124
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,240
you get in unless it's elevated biotics

125
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,639
and we'll talk about that in a minute

126
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,160
too

127
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,680
you guys we're live on facebook we're

128
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,880
live on youtube

129
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,600
live on clubhouse making some celery

130
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,639

131
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,960

00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,759
about it it

137
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,520
costs more to print the book costs more

138
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,120
to make the book it's 19

139
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,479
so i'm just saying if anybody didn't get

140
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,080
a chance or they don't have the book or

141
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,639
didn't get a chance yet

142
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,759
they got a chance now right and of

143
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,360

154
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,560
incredible really good to see you guys

155
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,080
coming on

156
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,800
so we're live right now it's the way we

157
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:36,400
like to do it i got my celery here

158
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,160
okay and i got something else what do i

159
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,199
have here

160
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:44,639
i have a head of lettuce

161
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:46,080
which i grew right so i'm gonna talk

162
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,440
about why this is important

163
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,759
okay so i grew this head of lettuce

164
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,199
right here okay i'm not saying i could

165
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,199
grow things good

166
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,120
that's not it at all because you know

167
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,199
you know you've got to pay attention to

168
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,120
your garden if you want to grow anything

169
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,720
and keep it growing you got to give it

170
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,759
that tlc right

171
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,960
that love and care but here's a head of

172
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,919
lettuce that i grew

173
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,039
okay and what i love about this head of

174
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,680
lettuce

175
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:16,240
is it's got elevated biotics on on it

176
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,880
okay so here's how it works

177
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,680
that's the good bacteria right there

178
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,720
okay

179
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,759
elevated biotics are on

180
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:28,919
this lettuce because it's in the garden

181
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,319
it's growing and millions of

182
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:33,680
microorganisms are

183
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:37,520
covered all over this head of lettuce

184
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,960
that's the good bacteria that gives us

185
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,240
something back

186
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:45,440
right there and even that bacteria

187
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:48,400
doesn't go into war and battle

188
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,039
with bad bacteria it doesn't but what it

189
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,720
does

190
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,240
is it goes down to your ilium which i'll

191
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,680
show you in a little bit

192
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:59,280
and these microorganisms they create

193
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:01,440
your b12 your own b12

194
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,120
right and i tell people everybody's

195
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,960
beaten down inside their guts

196
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,560
they've lost all their elevated biotics

197
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,560
they're good microorganisms that come

198
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,720
from this because they're not eating

199
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,560
out of their garden all the time because

200
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,840
face it we don't get those opportunities

201
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,919
we go to the store

202
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,520
by that time when you go to the store a

203
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:19,759
lot of time has passed

204
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,520
the elevated biotics are gone plus we

205
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,120
gotta wash our produce from the store

206
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,639
because you can have the plague on it

207
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,240
you can have anything on it the flu

208
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,800
viruses and everything else

209
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,080
but in the garden there's no washing it

210
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,880
you can give it a gentle

211
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,960
rinse a gentle rinse if you grow a

212
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,880
little parsley a gentle rinse

213
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,560
grow a little cilantro a gentle rinse

214
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,080
not even barely i mean i don't even

215
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,720
rinse the rosemary i pull out in my

216
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,400
garden

217
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:47,840
so it's loaded with elevated biotics

218
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:51,039
it's those elevated biotics those

219
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:53,199
that do things for us and that

220
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,879
is what science research is not up on

221
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,680
but what you're gonna see is all the

222
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,039
paid for

223
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:02,160

that's what they do

234
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,599
and meanwhile it's just money spent

235
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,360
for some you you know there's nothing

236
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,680

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,279
first thing i say

377
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,120
is you're going to have to juice you

378
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:20,000
know what a lot of them say to me

379
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,600
oh well you lost all the fiber you lost

380
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,959
all the fiber

381
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:27,760
that's not good juicing's bad because

382
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:29,600
you lost all the fiber the fibers where

383
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,200
it's at i'm like the fiber's not where

384
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,240
it's at

385
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,320
it's not you get plenty of fiber

386
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,440
you can get all the fiber you want and

387
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,480
you can still stay

388
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,160
sick there's people that have done

389
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,560
everything under the sun for their lyme

390
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,480
disease their ra their cfs or eczema

391
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,440
their psoriasis their vitiligo i don't

392
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,720
care what it is

393
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:54,000
they've done it they've done it

394
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,360
and they've eaten all the fiber plenty

395
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,519
of fiber

396
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,440
you know and so you'll get this

397
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,040
information that's not helpful

398
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,399
you guys were live on youtube live on

399
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,320
facebook live on tick tock live on

400
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,560
clubhouse

401
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,360
so you're gonna get plenty of fiber i'm

402
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,320
not saying

403
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,519
never eat a fruit and vegetable at the

404
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,000
same doctor

405
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,360
or doctors or a nutritionist or somebody

406
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,839
that would talk to me they would say

407
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,760
okay okay but what about what about

408
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,440
don't eat any fruit i'm like why are you

409
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,440
getting rid of fruit when there's your

410
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,120
fiber so here you are telling me don't

411
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,120
juice but you're telling me not to eat

412
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,279
any fruit

413
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,880
and this is where all the misconceptions

414
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:34,800
are out there there's so many

415
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:36,399
the fiber misconception so

416
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,480
what what i'm doing what you guys are

417
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,600
witnessing right now

418
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,279
you're witnessing an herbal extraction

419
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,160
that's what you're witnessing you're

420
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:49,519
witnessing a medical health tool

421
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:51,040
creating an herbal extraction

422
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,800
you see see the difference on what's

423
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,079
happening there so you're you're

424
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,440
witnessing

425
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:58,480
a medical health device and you're

426
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,800
witnessing

427
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:06,000
an herbal extraction fiber

428
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:09,600
has nothing to do with what we're

429
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,800
trying to do besides you want that

430
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:15,920
pulp and fiber out of here just

431
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:19,440
like when you have a medicinal tea

432
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:21,760
you don't break open the tea bag

433
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,560
after you've had your tea and start

434
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,720
trying to

435
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,079
choke down that tea do you is that what

436
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,560
you guys do when you have your chamomile

437
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,800
tea

438
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,240
when you're out for lunch you open the

439
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,519
tea bag at the end when you're sitting

440
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,279
there with your girlfriend

441
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:36,880
or your boyfriend or somebody and

442
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:39,040
you're sitting there and you're gonna be

443
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,120
like oh wait hold on i have to

444
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,040
go in the bottom of my tea glass here

445
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,959
and i gotta rip open the tea bag

446
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,240
and start eating it because i better get

447
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,079
my fiber

448
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,360
does that make sense john does that make

449
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,880
sense on clubhouse

450
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,639
right steph does that make sense on

451
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,160
clubhouse you guys right

452
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,839
and pearl does that make sense on

453
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,959
clubhouse and tick tock you guys does

454
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,320
that make sense

455
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:02,639
does it right you're missing the fiber

456
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,880
you better eat that tea bag you better

457
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,560
break open that tea bag you guys

458
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,880
because you're gonna lose the fiber

459
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,800
because some nutritionists or some

460
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,959
doctor lorraine l good to see some

461
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,800
doctors some nutritionists

462
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,639
was like oh yeah you got to have your

463
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,600
fiber you got to have your fiber

464
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:21,759
you better eat your celery sticks well

465
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,720
what people don't realize

466
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,839
is celery's not a vegetable that for

467
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,199
right there

468
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:32,000
red flag red flag red flag

469
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:33,839
i remember the media totally totally

470
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,440
just attacking the medical medium over

471
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,040
and over again about the celery juice

472
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,880
because so many millions of people were

473
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,440
drinking it to get their lives back

474
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,800
and the media were so curious and they

475
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,120
were just like

476
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,720
they were like they were like well wait

477
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,959
a minute here um

478
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,240
you're juicing a vegetable and you know

479
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,120
every time they would write something

480
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,720
they would bring on

481
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,759
somebody that was paid to try to like do

482
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,160
a smear

483
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,040
on celery or me right and they would say

484
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,440
well he's

485
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,759
he's wrong the medical medium's leaving

486
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,000
out the most important part the fiber

487
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,520
and the medical medium is just juicing a

488
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,439
vegetable and leaving out the fire first

489
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:12,240
of all this is an herb

490
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,799
so what you guys need to know is you're

491
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,160
looking

492
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:19,199
at an herb right here

493
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,880
you're looking at an herb that's an herb

494
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,600
so what you're doing is you're creating

495
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,480
herbal medicine

496
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,919
that's what you're doing you're margaret

497
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,520
valentine good to see you

498
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:34,720
you're creating herbal medicine

499
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:36,720
keep that in mind and so in today's

500
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,400
world with the plague out there

501
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,080
right and the new plague that's going to

502
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,480
come and the new plague that's going to

503
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,559
come

504
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,840
and then five years later a new plague

505
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,679
is going to come because you're just

506
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,280
going to let it out of a lab somewhere

507
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,440
and they're going to let another plague

508
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,240
out of a lab because they love to do

509
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,360
that

510
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,919
and they're going to then they're going

511
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:56,880
to let another plague out of a lab again

512
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,679
and what happens is when each new time

513
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,320
we get these

514
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,120
these flu related plagues and however

515
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,000
right

516
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,840
it's important to have medicinal tools

517
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,600
it's important to know how to use

518
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:12,520
herbs and herbal extractions and

519
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,400
with everything happening with immune

520
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,520
immunodeficiency issues which are going

521
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,600
to be growing

522
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:21,919
leaps and bounds coming up majorly

523
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,360
majorly people are going to be

524
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,679
struggling with their immune systems

525
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,640
more than ever before in history

526
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,480
starting now

527
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:32,720
and moving forward so and in that

528
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,880
we're not just so here's medical medium

529
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,559
he's just juicing a vegetable and

530
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,919
keep the fight he's kicking out the

531
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:41,039
fiber so

532
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,320
he must be real stupid because the fiber

533
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,400
is the most important

534
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,760
part i'm a nutritionist and a trainer

535
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,520
and he's just

536
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,799
he's just doesn't know that the fiber is

537
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:52,080
critical what a dumb

538
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:55,200
what a dumb ass that medical medium is

539
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:57,360
right you know or some doctor

540
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,039
that's paid to actually be out like some

541
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,080
doctor that doesn't they're not a doctor

542
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,280
because they don't they've never seen

543
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,120
patients before

544
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,640
but they're paid to be on social media

545
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,000
and they're like oh let's rip apart the

546
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,600
celery juice movement

547
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,760
let me let me get out there and do

548
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,720
something in an article or something

549
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,559
and they're like uh celery the vegetable

550
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,240
celery really isn't that good for you

551
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,320
it's got some nutrition but

552
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,000
there's no research in science about if

553
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:23,280
it helps anybody

554
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
there's no studies that say that celery

555
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,120
juice helps

556
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,640
you of course there's no studies so

557
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,799
celery juice hasn't been studied yet

558
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,240
except one way and one way only

559
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,480
millions of people drinking it and

560
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,520
getting real results in their lives back

561
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:40,320
right that beats out any study because

562
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:42,080
here's what i've seen my whole life and

563
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,240
maybe you guys have too

564
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,760
are you guys seasoned are you guys

565
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,640
seasoned enough for this

566
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,799
right are you guys seasoned enough to

567
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:54,799
see what i've seen my whole life

568
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:58,080
people sick and studies not helping them

569
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:59,440
people sick they're sick endometriosis

570
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:03,280
pcos

571
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:07,679
um you know fibroids um hashimoto's

572
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:12,200
severe cmf cms c you know cfs

573
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:15,679
me cfs hostimoto's ra

574
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,880
hyperthyroidism uh all kinds of problems

575
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:20,000
left and right right

576
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:22,240
vertigo dizziness brain fog adhd did

577
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,720
studies ever help any of those people

578
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,240
tell me now what study what study what

579
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,520
citation to a study has ever helped

580
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,440
anybody a single person

581
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:32,000
people stay sick they stay sick they

582
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,159
stay sick and they stay sick

583
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,520
you know so that's what studies do for

584
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,039
chronic illness i'm not talking about

585
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,679
rocket fuel

586
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,400
i'm not talking about rocket engine fuel

587
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:44,400
that takes

588
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:46,000
math that's all math chronic illness

589
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,600
they don't know what causes chronic

590
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,440
illness unless they

591
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,120
steal the information from medical

592
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,159
medium published books which they have

593
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,200
which they have

594
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:58,240
many times now okay and

595
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,480
what happens is that we you know we just

596
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,919
we walk around thinking oh that little

597
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,799
that study are you waiting for that

598
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,320
study

599
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:06,080
are you gonna wait another 10 years for

600
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,480
that study

601
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,720
which is basically an article written by

602
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,960
somebody in a university in hopes that

603
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,480
they did a study

604
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,159
oh what's that study going to be a

605
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:19,679
cellar juice is helpful

606
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:21,039
maybe it is helpful how stupid meanwhile

607
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,600
millions of people are drinking it

608
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:28,240
getting their lives back and guess what

609
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:31,840
no one's gonna spend 200 million dollars

610
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:34,159
200 million dollars to find

611
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:36,559
the subgroup sodium that is actually

612
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,880
turning everybody's life around

613
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,760
that's the macro sodium that's in celery

614
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,919
juice right

615
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,600
the macro sodium and then you got the

616
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,440
subgroup right there

617
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,679
the trace mineral salts that live in a

618
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:51,360
soap in a living solution

619
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:54,400
a living solution around the macro

620
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:56,320
sodium they're not going to spend 200

621
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,760
million dollars to prove medical medium

622
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,159
was right

623
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:02,159
think about that who's going to do that

624
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,600
who's going to come up with 250 million

625
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,720
dollars

626
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:09,120
right so and then and then

627
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,840
have teams of scientists working around

628
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,880
the clock

629
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,480
just to prove anthony william wright

630
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,559
because he gets his information from a

631
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,000
higher source that's already helped

632
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,200
people get their lives back because no

633
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,039
one else thought about

634
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,880
doing therapeutic celery juice and

635
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,880
getting your lives back

636
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,880
and then you can't make money so here

637
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,480
you put 250 million dollars

638
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,120
into trying to prove anthony william

639
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,000
right when you can't make a dime off of

640
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,559
it

641
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,760
that's not going to happen so this is

642
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:38,159
going to be ranking on

643
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:40,080
sell oh you can eat it with crudite you

644
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,400
can celery is good for you if you keep

645
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:45,520
the fiber there and you have crew today

646
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:49,360
like you have it with your dip right

647
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:52,480
but those sodium cluster salts those are

648
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,440
one of the big secrets inside celery

649
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,720
juice

650
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,000
but celery isn't just celery it's herbal

651
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,120
medicine

652
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,039
and you have to take the fiber out to

653
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:06,320
make it work

654
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:10,400
you do you got to take the fiber out

655
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:13,120
really important to know all right and

656
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,799
the other thing too is what you'll hear

657
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,640
too from nutritionists or

658
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:18,320
from rds and i there's a lot of great

659
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,640
rds that follow medical medium

660
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,840
information and work with it there's a

661
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,360
lot of great nutritionists

662
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,360
you guys i'm sure some of you guys are

663
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,520
here now that

664
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,840
work with medical medium information

665
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,760
doctors too of course right

666
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,960
but what you're gonna hear is well

667
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,520
you're wasting all that

668
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,880
pulp so where's that pulp going by the

669
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,960
way

670
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,440
that's all the pulp we have that's what

671
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,679
i love about the mm900 hds

672
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,039
you're looking at the pulp between my

673
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,520
fingertips

674
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:48,559
right all that celery juice and you're

675
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,440
looking at the pulp

676
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:52,640
between my fingertips and it's dry and

677
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,400
it's dry

678
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,760
and that's why the juicer pays for

679
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,279
itself

680
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:03,919
over and over again i'm buying

681
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:04,320
less celery okay less and less celery

682
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:06,480
and

683
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,000
i'm actually the juicer has paid for

684
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,640
itself i say good boy

685
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,640
good boy every day i'm like good boy you

686
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,520
just paid for yourself again

687
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,799
even and right now it's on sale it's 82

688
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,880
off right now right

689
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:20,720
it's like it's you paid for it it pays

690
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,240
for itself and pays for itself because

691
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,200
i'm buying half the celery

692
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,840
that i ever ever bought before and that

693
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,120
pulp is

694
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:31,279
dry to the bone and i've never seen that

695
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,960
with any juicer and i've tried them all

696
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:36,080
and that pulp is dried to the bone

697
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,840
but it's the mm-900 hds it's not just

698
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,960
any omega juicer so

699
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,640
it's the mm-900 hds right and you guys

700
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,960
know i'm working with omega because

701
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,080
when they created this i was like yeah

702
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,200
you better believe it

703
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:52,000
if i can if i can save people money

704
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,279
like half the cost in their salary bill

705
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,600
then i just we just

706
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:57,039
all of a sudden we just did it we did it

707
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,440
because that's what anything i can do to

708
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,279
help

709
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,039
pressing prince good to see you this

710
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:03,600
juicer is hands down the best

711
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:04,799
i have ever had thanks preston prince

712
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,360
it's really

713
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,559
awesome that you're here and i'm honored

714
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:12,000
you're here a monitor here i'm going to

715
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:12,000
pour the celery juice now you guys

716
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,880
um

717
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,240
here's the funny thing get this what do

718
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,760
you guys think about this is this a head

719
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,200
scratcher for you

720
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:24,240
like i was just wondering because it's a

721
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:27,520
head scratcher for me all right

722
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:30,240
is this a head scratcher for you okay

723
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,640
what you'll hear from a professional in

724
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,840
health

725
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:37,600
is you're wasting all that pulp

726
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:40,880
you're throwing all that pulp away um

727
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:44,480
so i'm con i'm confused

728
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:46,000
so when you eat the celery

729
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,520
you're pooping the pulp out in the

730
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,480
toilet

731
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,760
and it's going down into the sewer are

732
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,720
you going to save your poop are you

733
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,760
going to save your poop is that what

734
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,080
you're going to do

735
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,360
is that the plan i want to know because

736
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,480
i've seen this over and over again i've

737
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,600
seen his articles written against

738
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,039
medical media

739
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,679
so much smear against medical means

740
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:05,679
ridiculous it's spiritual racism

741
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,880
100 hands down in spiritual

742
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,480
discrimination

743
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,679
right but the point is is one bad thing

744
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,960
comes out another and here's what

745
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:14,880
they'll do they'll say this here's one

746
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,440

is that what everybody's doing so i'd

766
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,440
like to know what that that

767
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,600
the registered dietitian health of liz

768
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,120
how are you doing right

769
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,600
yeah health food list said yes it's

770
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:03,440
absolutely spiritual racism 100 percent

771
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,039
because health is you're not allowed to

772
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,480
tell a friend sometimes right

773
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:08,640
like hey you know check out medical

774
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,880
medium stuff he's saving lives

775
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,159
and because he hears it from a voice

776
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,360
since age four

777
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:17,279
right and he has that gift to hear it

778
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,799
and the information is is unique and

779
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,559
original it's no

780
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:22,399
hands down can't go near that because

781
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:23,679
it's the spiritual racism card that's

782
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,960
that's happening out there so that's

783
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:27,279
what they they do

784
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,279
they just do pull they throw that on you

785
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:31,200
it's like instantly they're no no that's

786
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:33,200
bs and they try to use that that try to

787
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,880
use that as their card

788
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,320
and so what you see is what do you guys

789
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,960
do with with so

790
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,760
okay so what i like any nutritionist to

791
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,200
know

792
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:44,720
because i'm scratching my head on this

793
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,880
one any registered dietitian any doctor

794
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,320
i'd like to know if you're so worried

795
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,640
about the pulp being

796
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,240
all thrown away and you're juicing and

797
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:56,000
wasting pulp and fiber

798
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:57,440
and that's like a waste creating waste

799
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,880
what are you doing when you're pooping

800
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,000
every single day i didn't know you're

801
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,200
collecting all that

802
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,279
so all these nutritionists and

803
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,840
dietitians and and all these smart

804
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,840
people

805
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:09,039
and all these smart doctors they must be

806
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:11,120
collecting all their

807
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:12,480
and straining it to get all that fiber

808
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,200
back out of it

809
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,399
what are they re-eating it they eating

810
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,240
it after they strain it out of their

811
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:21,200
poop and re-eat it

812
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,399
because i'm confused because they're not

813
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,640
saving their fiber

814
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:26,399
it's going out the other end fiber can't

815
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:30,480
be digested

816
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:32,000
so you guys can are you are you figuring

817
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,360
scratch your head here's the one thing

818
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,279
you're gonna find about medical medium

819
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,919
you don't have to like me

820
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:39,679
you can hate the way i look you can

821
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:42,480
think i'm ugly

822
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:43,520
you can think i'm annoying you can think

823
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,320
that

824
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:47,440
i'm all big on myself you can think i

825
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,279
got some ego

826
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,039
or i'm arrogant or you can think i'm a

827
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:52,559
nice guy whatever you want to think

828
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:54,240
okay the one thing you're going to get

829
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:57,360
for medical medium information

830
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:59,679
is it's sensible because if you read

831
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,440
every article or hear anybody on a

832
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:04,640
podcast talking about health

833
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:08,000
instantly it's not sensible

834
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,200
non-stop not sensible it's constantly

835
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,559
like this

836
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,720
fiber can't be assimilated nor can it be

837
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:17,840
digested

838
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:20,880
you eliminated out the other

839
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,480
end you guys

840
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,080
so you have all these so-called

841
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,279
professionals that have all these

842
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,360
degrees

843
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:28,320
all these degrees i graduated from blah

844
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,279
blah blah i got

845
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,279
i graduated

846
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:38,640
i graduated i have my certificate

847
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:41,360
i have a degree hanging on my wall

848
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,320
i'm so damn smart he's wasting all that

849
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,919
pulp and fiber

850
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,840
then anthony williams is wasting all

851
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:50,159
that pulp and fiber

852
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:52,799
really because use a dummy

853
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,440
use a dummy you might have paid for that

854
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,039
degree

855
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,120
you might have worked hard in school but

856
00:29:55,039 --> 00:30:01,120
use a dummy

857
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:02,799
a real dummy and you know

858
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,399
because what you'll find with mm

859
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:05,840
information it's why doctors around the

860
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:07,440

helped the most powerful people in the

863
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,960
world

864
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:16,720
for many years running okay

865
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:20,799
and because it makes so much

866
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:23,840
sense so much sense

867
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:25,200
it's unbelievable what happened to

868
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,039

even talk to each other

878
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,000

879
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:47,360

00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:43,280
gonna give you the quick run down

1119
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:45,839
the minute celery juice enters your

1120
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:48,800
mouth it's doing something for you guys

1121
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:49,839
right off the running right away right

1122
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:53,200
when it enters

1123
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:54,960
the mouth okay celery juice has the

1124
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:57,440
sodium cluster salts i talked about

1125
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,280
that break the membrane down on all the

1126
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:02,160
bad bacteria

1127
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,119
because bad bacteria and bad viruses run

1128
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,200
on a charge

1129
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:07,040
in electrical charges you guys know that

1130
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:10,079
they run on electrical charge

1131
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:12,000
a destructive one inside your body a

1132
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:14,480
destructive one

1133
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,160
good bacteria like the elevated biotics

1134
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,800
i was talking about on my garden lettuce

1135
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,680
right here

1136
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,560
on my garden lettuce the microorganisms

1137
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:24,800
that

1138
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:27,599
that are on life not on death

1139
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:29,280
they are on the opposite charge of the

1140
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:31,440
bad stuff

1141
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:33,760
celery juice is herbal medicine sodium

1142
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:36,640
cluster salts go in

1143
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,680
go in and start to annihilate bad

1144
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:40,079
bacteria

1145
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:41,119
so instantly when it goes in the mouth

1146
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:44,640
now your stomach

1147
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:46,640
just so you guys know okay your stomach

1148
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:48,240
right here has got those stomach glands

1149
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,079
and i was telling you the other day

1150
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,839
those stomach glands get burnt out by

1151
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:53,680
all that apple cider vinegar all that

1152
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:55,119
red wine vinegar all the other vinegar

1153
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:57,920
the balsamic vinegar

1154
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,880
gets burnt out all the caffeine the

1155
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:01,760
caffeine has

1156
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,319
burnt out you think chocolate chocolate

1157
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,839
is just

1158
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:05,359
safe and fine and dandy and you could

1159
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:07,760
eat these things chocolate i still want

1160
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:09,760
you here i still want you learning

1161
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:11,359
but i'm gonna tell you that caffeine

1162
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,079
burns out your stomach glands inside

1163
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:14,480
your stomach

1164
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:16,160
and then you lose your fighting

1165
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,079
mechanism

1166
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:20,400
your fighting mechanism you guys is your

1167
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:23,520
hydrochloric acid your hcl

1168
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,400
medical medium information okay unique

1169
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,560
information

1170
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,079
talks about it's a seven acid blend in

1171
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:30,960
your gastro glands

1172
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:31,280
not just hcl hcl is in hcl you guys know

1173
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,520
that

1174
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,800
in the human body hcl tear appleman good

1175
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:38,640
to see you

1176
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:40,240
um hcl is not just hydrochloric acid

1177
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:44,880
when it's inside your body

1178
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:44,880
it's a special blend of seven acids

1179
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:51,839
and our stomach glands

1180
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:54,160
have they become disabled

1181
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:54,880
and then your hcl can't kill anything

1182
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:57,839
anymore

1183
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:59,119
your hcl is the killer of all the bad

1184
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:01,040
microorganisms that

1185
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:02,560
that microorganisms that enter your

1186
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:05,520
mouth

1187
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:08,240
or grow inside your gut the bad stuff

1188
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:09,839
your hcl is the killer

1189
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,599
hydrochloric acid doesn't just stay in

1190
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:13,119
the stomach it actually goes down you

1191
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:14,720
guys and research and science doesn't

1192
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:16,800
know this

1193
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:18,079
this is really incredible information it

1194
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,720
goes

1195
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:22,319
it goes deep down throughout your whole

1196
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,599
intestinal tract that's what your acl

1197
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:26,160
does

1198
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:28,000
it travels and it destroys you know why

1199
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:29,119
people got bad bacteria when your gut

1200
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,800
health doctor your

1201
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:32,000
functional medicine doctor or whoever it

you got bad bacteria we did a

1204
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:37,359
stool sample and you got this and you

1205
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:39,200
got that

1206
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:40,480
that's because your hcl is gone it's

1207
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,800
blown out

1208
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:43,760
your gastric glands are blown out celery

1209
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,079
juice

1210
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,839
brings back those gastric lands that's

1211
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:49,839
why people's lives are being turned

1212
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:52,560
around

1213
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:54,000
it's bringing back those gastric glands

1214
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:56,240
so what is this juicer

1215
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,839
or any juicer you can use any juicer you

1216
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,440
want okay i'm just saying

1217
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:01,040
that this is the one that's saving me

1218
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:04,079
money it's the one that i love

1219
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:06,319
it doesn't have the metal gears

1220
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:07,520
the metal gears a friend of mine i told

1221
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:08,960
you a friend of mine was trying to make

1222
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,240
me juice and i was like great

1223
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,319
looks like i'll be doing the heavy metal

1224
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,000
detox smoothie

1225
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:16,480
because of the metal gears the metal

1226
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,920
gears they grind into each other and

1227
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,359
they grind into each other you don't

1228
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,960
think little tiny

1229
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:22,560
tiny particles of metal aren't

1230
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,240
eventually wearing off you know what

1231
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:26,960
your car engine does

1232
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:27,520
eventually your shaft and your car

1233
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,800
engine

1234
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:32,160
your crankshaft wear down you got a

1235
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,720
hundred thousand miles on your car you

1236
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:37,520
got 60 thousand miles 150 000 miles

1237
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:39,520
all your bearings metal all your cranks

1238
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:41,680
your crankshaft your camshaft

1239
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:43,920
all starts to wear down your valves all

1240
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:47,520
start to wear down

1241
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:50,240
that's how it works so i like juicers

1242
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:52,000
that don't have that on this juicer is

1243
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:54,880
exceptional it's an entirely different

1244
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,720
beast all on its own the whole point is

1245
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:59,839
is cold pressed by the way

1246
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:03,760
the whole point is is that's why i call

1247
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:03,760
juicers medical devices

1248
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:08,160
for where we're heading for where we're

1249
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,200
heading with health and what's going to

1250
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:12,160
happen

1251
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:13,040
it's one of those things that's critical

1252
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:16,400
cellular

1253
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:18,640
celery juice cured my acid reflux

1254
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,319
in addition to helping with other stuff

1255
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:24,079
shauna shawna simmons

1256
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:25,839
amazing and but hey

1257
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:27,359
that person saying it's too high in

1258
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:28,720
vitamin k and you're losing all your

1259
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:32,240
fiber

1260
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:35,520
unreal people need vitamin k by the way

1261
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:37,839
and celery juice isn't high in vitamin k

1262
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:39,680
it's got vitamin k

1263
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:41,440
that's high in something way more

1264
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:44,720
critical way more critical

1265
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:47,200
sodium cluster salts that's the thing

1266
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:50,160
that rebuilds your hcl

1267
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:51,760
that's the thing that rebuilds your hcl

1268
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:56,800
and your hcl is the

1269
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:58,079
killer of the bad stuff in your gut

1270
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,400
and when you and you know what else

1271
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:03,200
celery just does too it rebuilds your

1272
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:04,800
bile reserves so you can break down fats

1273
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:08,720
you guys

1274
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,720
so you can break down fats

1275
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,560
think about it people aren't breaking

1276
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:14,240
down their fats anymore they're not

1277
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:16,240
they're just getting caked into their

1278
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:19,920
gut caked into their gut

1279
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:21,760
they're not breaking them down so

1280
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,119
this is just one powerful reason why

1281
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,480
celery juice is so important

1282
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:26,880
so back to the herbal extraction you

1283
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:29,119
guys going to open up your tea bags

1284
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,720
you start gobbling down all that used

1285
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:31,280
tea because you don't want to waste the

1286
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:34,480
fiber

1287
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:35,599

because

1323
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:44,720

1324
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:48,000
different

1325
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:49,680
angle it's still powerful and then

1326
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,119
with where the angle the sun and the

1327
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:54,480

1328
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:56,319

1329
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:58,400
healing because it's still really a full

1330
00:46:56,319 --> 00:47:00,160
moon even though it's not at its fullest

1331
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:02,000

1332
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:03,440

are they just worried about trainers is

1374
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:27,920
worrying about building apps with

1375
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:29,040
someone who hasn't been sick yet

1376
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,880
you know so we get and then they're

1377
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:32,319
sitting there ripping apart celery juice

1378
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,680
gotta think about these things

1379
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:34,960
and i know don't get me wrong it's a lot

1380
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,480
of great traders that follow medical

1381
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,920
meme information they learn about celery

1382
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,920
they're doing celery and here's the

1383
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:41,119
other thing and then there's the dirty

1384
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:44,480
secret

1385
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:46,880
the dirty dirty secret so many people

1386
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:48,800
are drinking it behind closed doors

1387
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:50,240
because when you talk about it you can't

1388
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,599
make money off of it

1389
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:53,119
and the other thing is when you talk

1390
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:54,240
about it all you do is give medical

1391
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:55,839
medium credit

1392
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:57,520

1393
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:59,040

1394
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,319
about medical medium and they're so sick

1395
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:02,000
you hear about people bringing their

1396
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:03,440
books to the doctor's offices

1397
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,200
