[141.60 - 147.18] finally give up so we are on it right
[143.94 - 150.36] now day five medical medium brain shot
[147.18 - 153.30] therapy cleanse challenge I'm excited
[150.36 - 155.04] about it let's go into a little bit
[153.30 - 158.34] let's get going
[155.04 - 161.88] mold exposure
[158.34 - 166.82] mold exposure shots
[161.88 - 168.84] the exposure shots but the mold exposure
[166.82 - 171.54] forewarning man
[168.84 - 174.18] telling you right now I've had the mold
[171.54 - 177.60] exposure shot before
[174.18 - 179.34] it's not the tastiest shot you be the
[177.60 - 182.76] judge of it that's all I can tell you
[179.34 - 185.10] right now you be the judge of that shot
[182.76 - 186.66] and the taste of that shot
[185.10 - 189.24] because that shot
[186.66 - 191.46] doesn't taste sweet
[189.24 - 194.28] doesn't taste yummy
[191.46 - 197.04] it's not the best tasting shot
[194.28 - 199.86] but that shot is rigged and it's it
[197.04 - 203.52] levels you out and I'm excited about it
[199.86 - 207.36] because it is a mold exposure shot
[203.52 - 210.06] yeah and it's intense it's intense
[207.36 - 212.16] but sometimes you need the intense stuff
[210.06 - 216.30] you're gonna battle the mold exposure
[212.16 - 217.80] really important so mold exposure
[216.30 - 220.14] all right
[217.80 - 222.00] when to use the mold exposure shot you
[220.14 - 225.24] ready for this guy's visiting or living
[222.00 - 227.58] in a moldy house or building if you're
[225.24 - 228.90] visiting a moldy building you don't know
[227.58 - 231.18] it's moldy maybe you're at the dentist
[228.90 - 234.00] office there's mold everywhere maybe
[231.18 - 236.40] you're somewhere else maybe maybe you're
[234.00 - 237.78] at the veterinarian clinic maybe you're
[236.40 - 240.24] somewhere else maybe you're in the store
[237.78 - 242.76] or whatever it is buildings mold
[240.24 - 245.88] exposure how about this one
[242.76 - 248.16] working in a moldy office or other
[245.88 - 249.48] workspace so if you're working in a
[248.16 - 251.82] workspace
[249.48 - 252.98] that there's mold exposure right now
[251.82 - 256.88] this one
[252.98 - 259.92] inhaling mold breathing it in right
[256.88 - 263.70] breathing in that mold
[259.92 - 266.28] okay inhaling mold off another person's
[263.70 - 268.02] clothing it's like give somebody a hug
[266.28 - 269.76] and they're they're in a moldy house and
[268.02 - 270.84] you're like how you doing you're giving
[269.76 - 272.58] them a hug
[270.84 - 275.88] right and they're getting it all over
[272.58 - 278.94] all over you it's a moldy shirt
[275.88 - 280.92] I think your shirt's moldy
[278.94 - 282.96] oh my god I think I'm wearing a moldy
[280.92 - 284.64] shirt right now so if you got mold
[282.96 - 287.94] exposure shot if you're up against any
[284.64 - 291.30] of that consuming water contaminated
[287.94 - 293.22] with mildew or mold spores or eating
[291.30 - 296.34] moldy food and moldy food isn't the
[293.22 - 298.56] worst problem unless it's moldy meat
[296.34 - 302.46] that's another story some moldy food
[298.56 - 305.04] moldy Dairy which is mold moldy meat
[302.46 - 306.72] right mold right
[305.04 - 308.58] these are just some of the examples
[306.72 - 310.44] right here if you if you're worried
[308.58 - 312.30] about mold exposure in general that's
[310.44 - 314.34] another reason and if you're not worried
[312.30 - 316.02] at all you don't have to do the shot but
[314.34 - 318.42] here's the thing the medical medium
[316.02 - 321.30] brain shots do things for us that even
[318.42 - 324.18] break the boundaries
[321.30 - 326.58] you take the shot for one thing and it
[324.18 - 328.68] can do wonders in all kinds of different
[326.58 - 330.24] ways so even if you're like well I don't
[328.68 - 333.72] know if I'm up against mold right now
[330.24 - 337.26] but let me try this mold exposure shot
[333.72 - 339.00] you'd be surprised be surprised indeed
[337.26 - 340.62] all right let's move through this a
[339.00 - 342.60] little bit okay

[420.84 - 423.08] it
[425.12 - 429.00] that's what it's gonna be
[427.44 - 431.82] I have a feeling
[429.00 - 433.80] because I know because I did the mold
[431.82 - 435.78] exposure shot before and that's what
[433.80 - 438.60] happened to me but maybe you're like
[435.78 - 441.00] you're not like that maybe maybe not so
[438.60 - 442.38] maybe you're less dramatic and you're
[441.00 - 444.66] that's not going to happen to you you're
[442.38 - 446.46] just gonna make up a face right but
[444.66 - 448.20] that's what I did and maybe you're just
[446.46 - 449.82] gonna make a face and drink them all the
[448.20 - 451.16] exposure shot you're gonna drink and
[449.82 - 454.50] you're just like
[451.16 - 456.36] you know he saw that movie Elf right do
[454.50 - 457.68] you remember that movie Elf right I
[456.36 - 461.16] remember when elf was in the department
[457.68 - 463.44] store and that lady was like fruit spray
[461.16 - 466.50] anybody fruit spray and he goes I love
[463.44 - 469.14] fruit spray and it was a perfume it was
[466.50 - 470.34] a perfume and so she took that perfume
[469.14 - 473.16] bottle and she sprayed it in his mouth
[470.34 - 474.54] and he went no no no no that's where
[473.16 - 476.64] right that's what this is gonna be like
[474.54 - 479.04] the mold exposure shot or you might like
[476.64 - 480.36] it you might be somebody that actually
[479.04 - 482.46] likes it
[480.36 - 483.84] that's the other thing too so think
[482.46 - 486.06] about that
[483.84 - 488.88] all right so medical mean brain shot
[486.06 - 492.96] therapy offers instant relief
[488.88 - 495.90] instant relief it absorbs deep into the
[492.96 - 498.48] blood vessels in your mouth
[495.90 - 499.44] Nobody Knows the combinations comes from
[498.48 - 502.38] above
[499.44 - 504.12] nobody ever knew and ever will never
[502.38 - 507.06] know
[504.12 - 508.74] unless they get it here that if you take
[507.06 - 511.10] fennel bulb
[508.74 - 516.72] radish
[511.10 - 519.12] basil oregano Rosemary and ginger and
[516.72 - 520.56] you put them together in the order and
[519.12 - 522.48] you juice it
[520.56 - 525.84] and you run it through your juicer and
[522.48 - 530.10] nobody knows the power that's there
[525.84 - 535.38] against mold exposure comes from above
[530.10 - 537.78] and if you get a chance 20 off BM M 1500
[535.38 - 540.18] right here so the Omega mm 1500 you guys
[537.78 - 542.40] know I'm working with them now
[540.18 - 544.62] something has something sad has happened
[542.40 - 546.30] in the medical medium Community there's
[544.62 - 549.48] been a lot of advertising from the
[546.30 - 551.76] Sharks a lot of heavy money lenders
[549.48 - 555.06] behind it pushing
[551.76 - 557.64] other juicers people buy the juicers
[555.06 - 560.58] they don't squeeze as much juice out and
[557.64 - 562.20] then you have to buy double the produce
[560.58 - 566.04] and the juicer doesn't pay for itself
[562.20 - 569.04] this is the mm 1500 20 off it pays for
[566.04 - 571.74] itself it has the compression it
[569.04 - 574.68] actually squeezes the crap out of the
[571.74 - 577.08] juice you use less produce you save
[574.68 - 579.84] money the money goes back into your bank
[577.08 - 582.84] and then you can buy more produce
[579.84 - 584.40] it eventually pays for itself the juicer
[582.84 - 586.62] that's my experience and that's other
[584.40 - 589.44] people's experiences but there's some
[586.62 - 591.06] juicers that are tricky they'll say
[589.44 - 592.86] things like oh for large amounts of
[591.06 - 594.84] juicing that's silly it's all the same
[592.86 - 596.94] you're still juicing it all and it still
[594.84 - 599.64] ends up in the same place it's a scam
[596.94 - 601.26] the other scam is you know this juicer
[599.64 - 602.88] works this way this way but they don't
[601.26 - 605.76] get it it's a lot of metal in those
[602.88 - 608.22] juicers that's one problem the other
[605.76 - 609.90] problem is all the juice escapes nobody
[608.22 - 612.00] gets it you have to run a lot more
[609.90 - 613.56] produce in it I don't want to be the
[612.00 - 615.54] juicer guy screaming about a juicer
[613.56 - 617.28] every 10 minutes but when I go quiet and
[615.54 - 620.04] I don't talk about the juicer for a long
[617.28 - 622.20] time the Sharks come in and they take
[620.04 - 624.84] advantage of people and they rip them
[622.20 - 625.92] off and that's what's happened so what I
[624.84 - 628.38] recommend
[625.92 - 630.48] is since that's the route somebody's
[628.38 - 632.34] gonna go if you're looking to save money
[630.48 - 634.80] you're looking to buy less produce for
[632.34 - 637.98] what you need to do and your juices then
[634.80 - 641.16] look into the mm 1500 or 900 save up
[637.98 - 643.32] whatever it's 20 off wait for the sales
[641.16 - 646.26] when they come on whenever they do
[643.32 - 648.00] that's my recommendation and I haven't
[646.26 - 649.50] talked about the juicer forever and
[648.00 - 652.20] that's what happened I can't be
[649.50 - 653.76] everywhere at all times and I can
[652.20 - 654.84] literally I'm trying to get the books
[653.76 - 657.78] written trying to get this information
[654.84 - 659.82] to you in the minute I like let one
[657.78 - 661.44] thing drop for a little while people get
[659.82 - 663.84] screwed over and it's the saddest thing
[661.44 - 666.18] I've ever seen it's just as I don't even
[663.84 - 667.92] know what to say so medical medium brain
[666.18 - 671.00] shots absorb quickly into the blood
[667.92 - 674.22] vessels and they rush to the brain
[671.00 - 677.40] rush to the brain
[674.22 - 679.92] that is what they do you experience it
[677.40 - 681.96] for me for you it could be the first
[679.92 - 685.56] shot I mean the first sip of the shot
[681.96 - 688.32] for me it's the second sip every time
[685.56 - 690.36] it's always the second sip for me so
[688.32 - 691.80] when I'm doing the shot of course you
[690.36 - 695.22] could send your shot down in one shot
[691.80 - 698.52] like that boom you got it down there but
[695.22 - 701.22] what I do is I sip the shot so I'm like
[698.52 - 704.70] sip the first Sip and then I do the
[701.22 - 707.16] second Sip Sip and boom it hits that's
[704.70 - 709.20] for me is when it's starting to hit and
[707.16 - 710.66] you like you'll probably feel it too on
[709.20 - 713.10] the second shot
[710.66 - 715.32] Allah Monica says I love my Omega Juicer
[713.10 - 718.50] incredible I do too Sherry says love my
[715.32 - 719.70] mega right I do too and so anyway when
[718.50 - 721.32] it comes down to the brain shot
[719.70 - 723.78] therapies they absorb quickly in the
[721.32 - 725.46] mouth and it's incredible okay these
[723.78 - 728.46] specially formulated shots have the
[725.46 - 731.10] ability to reset and rewire the brain
[728.46 - 734.22] so what the shots do
[731.10 - 736.44] like the obsessive shifter shot betrayal
[734.22 - 738.78] and broken trust shot
[736.44 - 741.90] okay all the different shots what they
[738.78 - 744.72] do is they help to reset and rewire the
[741.90 - 747.30] brain the emotional sensors of the brain
[744.72 - 750.36] is one place they help to reset and
[747.30 - 753.24] rewire the emotional center of the brain
[750.36 - 756.56] since one place now our brain gets
[753.24 - 759.32] injured by toxins poisons junk garbage
[756.56 - 763.02] pathogens metals
[759.32 - 765.60] emotional hurt our brain can get injured
[763.02 - 768.00] physically from all that the neurons can
[765.60 - 770.10] get burned up so what the brain shot
[768.00 - 773.46] therapies do is they rewire and reset
[770.10 - 775.38] the brain they help to rewire and reset
[773.46 - 777.54] the brain which is incredible people are
[775.38 - 778.98] always asking me about it you sir right
[777.54 - 780.36] they're you know they're always asking
[778.98 - 782.22] me to they're like what kind of juicer
[780.36 - 783.78] what kind of juice or whatever and so
[782.22 - 785.88] the name of the juicer if you're if
[783.78 - 787.98] you're you know the in the description
[785.88 - 792.06] you'll see it in the bio bio you'll see
[787.98 - 794.54] that the juicer mm-1500 or mm-900 see a
[792.06 - 798.72] mega juicer mm1500
[794.54 - 801.54] mm-900 20 off right now if you want to
[798.72 - 805.14] know and here's the thing
[801.54 - 808.44] you get dry pulp you guys you guys you
[805.14 - 810.60] get dry pulp I'll show you today
[808.44 - 813.24] and people are asking the comments I saw
[810.60 - 815.22] that too you you when the dry pulp comes
[813.24 - 816.54] out you squeeze everything out of that
[815.22 - 818.40] produce
[816.54 - 822.02] and you're saving money you're cutting
[818.40 - 822.02] your costs for me it cuts it in half
[822.24 - 826.80] almost cuts it completely in half for me
[824.46 - 828.72] that's what it's done so it's like I buy
[826.80 - 830.52] less of everything that juicer pays for
[828.72 - 832.68] itself it's like incredible that's why
[830.52 - 834.90] that company is why I've endorsed that
[832.68 - 836.88] company fully endorsed them the heck
[834.90 - 839.58] yeah I will
[836.88 - 842.10] you know and so it's important to know
[839.58 - 845.10] so the mold exposure shot
[842.10 - 847.08] okay is really potent and you're gonna
[845.10 - 849.30] feel it you're gonna you're gonna feel
[847.08 - 851.22] okay here's a question Angie says do the
[849.30 - 853.08] ingredients contain binders to fully
[851.22 - 855.36] remove the mold from the cellular level
[853.08 - 857.82] my functional medicine doctor needs us
[855.36 - 861.48] on good binders too charcoal Etc
[857.82 - 863.34] charcoals charcoal doesn't remove things
[861.48 - 864.66] and that's the misinformation out there
[863.34 - 866.46] and
[864.66 - 867.84] no disrespect to the functional medicine
[866.46 - 870.30] doctor
[867.84 - 873.48] if you read the brain saver books
[870.30 - 875.52] you'll learn what charcoal does
[873.48 - 877.74] it suffocates the lining of the
[875.52 - 879.84] intestinal tract not allowing nutrients
[877.74 - 881.52] to pass if you're on charcoal long term
[879.84 - 883.68] long term
[881.52 - 885.66] you'll get so nutrient deficient your
[883.68 - 888.00] hair will fall out everything will go
[885.66 - 890.94] wrong in a year or two and it'll be a
[888.00 - 893.10] nightmare I talk about it in the books
[890.94 - 895.98] charcoal is madness the heavy metal
[893.10 - 898.50] detox smoothies in the books
[895.98 - 900.96] really cleans up the intestinal tract
[898.50 - 903.36] and crosses the blood-brain barrier
[900.96 - 904.44] getting Metals out but also cleans up
[903.36 - 907.56] things that shouldn't be in the
[904.44 - 909.96] intestinal tract and on a cellular level
[907.56 - 912.60] powerful cleanses right here in these
[909.96 - 916.80] books but the point I'm trying to say is
[912.60 - 919.02] charcoal is a mishap it started in
[916.80 - 921.12] conventional medicine
[919.02 - 923.52] and then it went to alternative medicine
[921.12 - 924.96] because alternative medicine didn't know
[923.52 - 927.00] how to break away from conventional
[924.96 - 929.94] medicine on that one
[927.00 - 931.86] so people who are all alternative
[929.94 - 934.56] they get wrapped up with old
[931.86 - 937.92] conventional medicine standards charcoal
[934.56 - 940.08] was an old conventional medicine Theory
[937.92 - 942.30] of possibly trying to remove something
[940.08 - 944.40] from the intestinal tract with no
[942.30 - 945.90] science behind it that shows it
[944.40 - 948.24] got to be careful with the charcoal
[945.90 - 949.80] thing I'm just being straight up if you
[948.24 - 951.30] take charcoal on a regular basis because
[949.80 - 953.70] you think you're cleaning something up
[951.30 - 955.62] no disrespect for any practitioners or
[953.70 - 958.44] doctors or anybody well you think you're
[955.62 - 961.14] cleaning something up with charcoal
[958.44 - 962.70] what happens is the charcoal sticks to
[961.14 - 965.76] the lining of the intestinal tract for
[962.70 - 968.82] weeks suffocating good bacteria and
[965.76 - 971.34] suffocating the cells of the intestinal
[968.82 - 974.34] lining so nutrients don't easily pass
[971.34 - 976.38] through into your hepatic portal vein up
[974.34 - 979.08] the highway to your liver and no one
[976.38 - 981.54] realizes this and it's sad
[979.08 - 982.74] I just want it you know but listen do
[981.54 - 984.30] what your doctor says if your doctor
[982.74 - 986.22] says charcoal do what your doctor says
[984.30 - 987.42] I'm not telling you to go against your
[986.22 - 988.68] doctor's wishes or your functional
[987.42 - 989.82] medicine doctor's wishes if your
[988.68 - 991.14] functional medicine doctor says do
[989.82 - 993.24] charcoal you do what your doctor says
[991.14 - 995.10] I'm just telling you from what I tell
[993.24 - 997.02] doctors out there and what I've what
[995.10 - 999.66] I've you know learned through the
[997.02 - 1002.26] information that I have
[999.66 - 1002.26] so let's
[1004.34 - 1008.48] let's I think we had plenty of talks
[1006.50 - 1010.76] about the charcoal
[1008.48 - 1013.10] I'm gonna be a podcast doctor and talk
[1010.76 - 1015.92] about charcoals supplementation of my
[1013.10 - 1017.00] podcast I'm gonna invite a guest on I'm
[1015.92 - 1018.50] gonna invite a functional medicine
[1017.00 - 1021.02] doctor out there I was gonna save
[1018.50 - 1023.60] everybody being charcoal
[1021.02 - 1025.70] I'm also gonna have a glass of wine I
[1023.60 - 1029.00] have a glass of wine right here
[1025.70 - 1031.58] this glass of wine I got from I got this
[1029.00 - 1033.44] from the valley fifty two thousand
[1031.58 - 1034.88] dollars a glass of glass perfectly right
[1033.44 - 1036.50] price
[1034.88 - 1039.44] hmm
[1036.50 - 1042.88] it's glass of Wine's delicious
[1039.44 - 1042.88] tastes like apple juice
[1044.30 - 1048.26] um
[1045.68 - 1051.70] Kirsten says I have to tell you I have
[1048.26 - 1054.50] never felt as good as I do now in years
[1051.70 - 1056.90] this has truly been life-changing for me
[1054.50 - 1060.20] incredible Kirsten that's what I want it
[1056.90 - 1062.90] to be that's what I live for that's what
[1060.20 - 1065.36] I was born for that's why I received the
[1062.90 - 1067.64] messages at age four about all this
[1065.36 - 1070.22] that's why I was given that the gift
[1067.64 - 1071.78] that actually here a voice which is
[1070.22 - 1073.28] really a gift for you guys it's not a
[1071.78 - 1074.84] gift for me it's a pain in my butt but
[1073.28 - 1077.06] it's a gift for you guys to have this
[1074.84 - 1078.08] information it's why I'm hated so much
[1077.06 - 1081.32] too
[1078.08 - 1083.72] I'm hated so much
[1081.32 - 1085.88] but yet but yet the books are the the
[1083.72 - 1088.10] most selling Health books in the world
[1085.88 - 1090.74] eight years running now but yet I'm
[1088.10 - 1092.84] hated because people just don't like
[1090.74 - 1095.06] knowing where I get the information it
[1092.84 - 1097.16] drives them insane
[1095.06 - 1099.20] I take up real estate in so many
[1097.16 - 1100.64] people's heads out there that hate me I
[1099.20 - 1102.62] just take up all the real estate in
[1100.64 - 1103.82] their minds in their heads they don't
[1102.62 - 1105.92] understand how all the new information
[1103.82 - 1107.06] can constantly keep on pouring out from
[1105.92 - 1109.70] over here
[1107.06 - 1111.02] and they poach it whenever they can and
[1109.70 - 1113.60] they try to step on my face while

[1327.08 - 1332.54] before in our history
[1330.02 - 1335.36] there are different levels from very
[1332.54 - 1337.22] mild to devastatingly severe you see it
[1335.36 - 1339.68] out there people who are twitching and
[1337.22 - 1341.72] spasming and they're just like losing it
[1339.68 - 1343.16] they're just they're they're tortured

[1346.58 - 1350.66] there's The Not So Sick group you know
[1348.68 - 1352.10] the not not so sick group is you got
[1350.66 - 1353.60] some symptoms you go to your functional
[1352.10 - 1355.34] medicine doctor he tells you you got
[1353.60 - 1357.32] sibo you got this you got that that's
[1355.34 - 1359.24] the not so sick group you get a little
[1357.32 - 1360.86] bit of a little bit of energy problems
[1359.24 - 1362.72] you're going to your naturopath and they
[1360.86 - 1364.10] say you got an adrenal issue you're
[1362.72 - 1365.42] going to your other doctor but you're
[1364.10 - 1367.46] still living your life drinking your
[1365.42 - 1369.38] coffee doing whatever you want eating
[1367.46 - 1371.60] what you want exercising That's The Not
[1369.38 - 1374.42] So Sick group
[1371.60 - 1376.10] there's The Not So Sick group those who
[1374.42 - 1377.24] are experiencing symptoms like I'm
[1376.10 - 1380.06] talking about
[1377.24 - 1381.74] and still functioning that's a not so
[1380.06 - 1383.84] sick group you guys they're working
[1381.74 - 1386.18] they're being productive they're
[1383.84 - 1387.74] exercising they're playing all day they
[1386.18 - 1389.78] have all their Privileges and they're
[1387.74 - 1393.86] getting all their self-care 24 7. That's
[1389.78 - 1397.10] The Not So Sick group right
[1393.86 - 1399.62] those who are frightfully ill those for
[1397.10 - 1402.34] whom each day is about surviving is
[1399.62 - 1402.34] another group
[1403.28 - 1408.74] which was all for medical medium
[1405.86 - 1410.90] information to heal and help all these
[1408.74 - 1415.66] decades the group that really was
[1410.90 - 1415.66] suffering that's a big deal
[1416.96 - 1421.88] this increase in sickness like never
[1418.94 - 1424.22] before is only going to keep developing
[1421.88 - 1426.52] so are we evolving in the right
[1424.22 - 1426.52] direction
[1426.80 - 1432.68] so are we moving forward or backwards
[1430.64 - 1435.74] are our physical bodies any different
[1432.68 - 1437.54] than they were in ancient Rome 2500
[1435.74 - 1439.72] years ago I'm reading brain saver you
[1437.54 - 1439.72] guys
[1439.88 - 1443.96] he came on here and we're in the medical
[1441.68 - 1446.48] medium brain shot therapy class which is
[1443.96 - 1448.58] really incredible
[1446.48 - 1450.98] and if you believe that we evolved since
[1448.58 - 1452.90] then we are evolving faster than what's
[1450.98 - 1454.46] evolving around us no we're not because
[1452.90 - 1456.14] we're sicker than ever before in our
[1454.46 - 1457.46] history and that's the whole point check
[1456.14 - 1458.54] this out talk about the immune system
[1457.46 - 1462.20] because we're talking about mold
[1458.54 - 1464.72] exposure shots today and I said mold
[1462.20 - 1466.58] can trigger things it can lower the
[1464.72 - 1470.00] immune system and saying that for 35
[1466.58 - 1473.06] plus years it lowers the immune system
[1470.00 - 1475.22] there's no way humankind could
[1473.06 - 1476.96] physically evolve faster than any of
[1475.22 - 1479.24] these forces against us that's why we're
[1476.96 - 1480.80] all getting sick so we're having the
[1479.24 - 1482.90] medals and we're having the chemical
[1480.80 - 1485.06] exposure and we got the fragrances the
[1482.90 - 1488.44] perfumes colognes air freshener scented
[1485.06 - 1491.06] candles the detergents we got all that
[1488.44 - 1493.28] nanotechnology that's in chemicals we
[1491.06 - 1495.44] got the pesticides herbicides fungicides
[1493.28 - 1497.30] we got all that junk being sprayed all
[1495.44 - 1498.92] over us on our Lawns around our
[1497.30 - 1501.32] buildings and apartment buildings and on
[1498.92 - 1503.12] our highways we got stuff flying out of
[1501.32 - 1504.56] the air we got mosquito spray being
[1503.12 - 1508.76] dumped on us did you guys know that
[1504.56 - 1512.78] every single town in the U.S is getting
[1508.76 - 1516.44] dumped on by mosquito spray lethal spray
[1512.78 - 1519.02] just coming out of helicopters and
[1516.44 - 1521.54] drones and landing on everybody is that
[1519.02 - 1524.36] nice and that's what they do but yet the
[1521.54 - 1526.46] mosquitoes are still here hmm
[1524.36 - 1528.68] it's kind of funny too because they also
[1526.46 - 1530.90] genetically modify mosquitoes and they
[1528.68 - 1533.18] let them out by the trillions so they
[1530.90 - 1534.80] have a mosquito Factory does this make a
[1533.18 - 1536.54] lot of sense they have a mosquito
[1534.80 - 1538.34] Factory and they're letting out
[1536.54 - 1541.52] trillions of mosquitoes that they breed
[1538.34 - 1544.34] and then they're using you know
[1541.52 - 1546.44] our money to make sure that they dump
[1544.34 - 1548.54] lots of mosquito spray on every single
[1546.44 - 1551.84] town and city in this country and around
[1548.54 - 1553.76] the world huh but let's keep on breeding
[1551.84 - 1556.34] and letting out trillions of mosquitoes
[1553.76 - 1559.10] and then keep on dumping spray does that
[1556.34 - 1561.32] sound like a great place
[1559.10 - 1563.54] so we're up against all this stuff our
[1561.32 - 1566.00] immune systems weren't made to put up
[1563.54 - 1567.74] with all this BS doesn't say that in the
[1566.00 - 1569.42] book put up with all this BS assist put
[1567.74 - 1571.82] up with all these chemicals
[1569.42 - 1573.92] either the number of varieties
[1571.82 - 1576.20] are the outright quantity of these
[1573.92 - 1578.50] chemicals including everything we talked
[1576.20 - 1581.48] about with like radiation and everything
[1578.50 - 1583.28] every time something foreign enters into
[1581.48 - 1585.98] our body we're reading out a brain saver
[1583.28 - 1588.20] enters into our body
[1585.98 - 1591.08] our immune system has to gobble it up
[1588.20 - 1593.12] and Gobble it up and Gobble it up
[1591.08 - 1596.48] so our immune system the white blood
[1593.12 - 1599.00] cell here has to eat it up so we're an
[1596.48 - 1601.16] expo we're exposed to some type of mold
[1599.00 - 1602.18] right because I got a moldy rag right
[1601.16 - 1605.60] here
[1602.18 - 1607.58] my robot wasn't happy about the moly rag
[1605.60 - 1611.24] did you see that the robot was not happy
[1607.58 - 1613.58] robot was very put off by The Moldy rag
[1611.24 - 1616.22] so like this mold spot here that I have
[1613.58 - 1619.22] when we get mold in us and it goes in
[1616.22 - 1620.30] our body our white blood cells have to
[1619.22 - 1622.04] eat it up
[1620.30 - 1623.96] so our white blood cells have to go and
[1622.04 - 1626.78] Gobble it all up whatever that mold went
[1623.96 - 1628.88] to whatever it is
[1626.78 - 1630.80] and it has to just eat it up and Gobble
[1628.88 - 1632.42] it all up
[1630.80 - 1633.82] Maria why did they create GMOs
[1632.42 - 1637.70] mosquitoes
[1633.82 - 1639.68] maybe to create the need for trillions
[1637.70 - 1641.60] of gallons of mosquito spray on every
[1639.68 - 1644.06] single town and city in the world
[1641.60 - 1646.94] do you see what see how it works
[1644.06 - 1648.08] who's creating those ketos uh mosquitoes
[1646.94 - 1650.78] are created and they're dumping all the
[1648.08 - 1652.88] stuff on you see how it works
[1650.78 - 1656.06] so there isn't any real mold on this
[1652.88 - 1658.88] towel I don't want anybody to be upset
[1656.06 - 1660.68] there's no mold it's a Juice Spot it's a
[1658.88 - 1663.74] green juice spot from juicing and it's
[1660.68 - 1665.12] on this toggle so the towel is clean it
[1663.74 - 1667.28] doesn't have any mold on it I know
[1665.12 - 1669.62] somebody was upset see there's there it
[1667.28 - 1672.26] is the green spot right there
[1669.62 - 1673.94] smells like green juice
[1672.26 - 1676.70] because I was making a shot this morning
[1673.94 - 1679.22] okay you guys
[1676.70 - 1681.32] so here we are your immune cells have to
[1679.22 - 1684.44] gobble up any mold and any mold exposure
[1681.32 - 1685.88] just like that so we need to know that's
[1684.44 - 1688.72] how it works
[1685.88 - 1688.72] and
[1689.66 - 1693.74] let's go into it just a little bit if
[1691.40 - 1696.26] you guys got a second I feel it I feel
[1693.74 - 1697.52] that our halftime or half time is coming
[1696.26 - 1699.44] up any second so I want to get this
[1697.52 - 1702.44] information going oh
[1699.44 - 1704.24] yeah my immune cell's falling apart
[1702.44 - 1706.82] they weren't designed to fight off
[1704.24 - 1709.16] engineered viruses either they weren't
[1706.82 - 1710.78] designed to fight off chemicals but our
[1709.16 - 1713.18] immune cells have to fight off
[1710.78 - 1715.04] everything it has no choice it wasn't
[1713.18 - 1717.62] designed to fight off radiation but it
[1715.04 - 1719.36] has no choice but to fight it off and it
[1717.62 - 1721.52] wasn't dissolved it wasn't sorry
[1719.36 - 1724.22] designed to fight off certain varieties
[1721.52 - 1726.68] of mold but yet it has to fight it off
[1724.22 - 1728.36] so our immune cells have to go up
[1726.68 - 1730.10] against so much that we're up against
[1728.36 - 1732.98] all the time
[1730.10 - 1734.78] so how long your blood cells can last
[1732.98 - 1737.14] like this one that's Fallen apart on me
[1734.78 - 1737.14] right now
[1737.18 - 1741.08] it's up against all that mold and
[1738.74 - 1742.76] everything how long a blood cell can
[1741.08 - 1744.98] last
[1742.76 - 1747.02] depends on how toxic a substance is and
[1744.98 - 1749.36] how strong your immune system is so when
[1747.02 - 1750.50] your white blood cell gobbles up a mold
[1749.36 - 1753.14] Spore
[1750.50 - 1755.84] or anything
[1753.14 - 1758.90] it eventually dies or can die on the
[1755.84 - 1760.40] spot and explode so then mold can become
[1758.90 - 1762.62] a trigger
[1760.40 - 1764.72] because as mold is knocking down our
[1762.62 - 1768.14] immune system
[1764.72 - 1770.30] something else inside of us can rise up
[1768.14 - 1771.68] any kind of pathogens any other kind of
[1770.30 - 1774.26] problems and then we kind of get
[1771.68 - 1776.12] triggered we can get sick
[1774.26 - 1777.62] depending on what kind of mold depending
[1776.12 - 1779.48] on how strong your immune system is
[1777.62 - 1781.64] depending on what else your body is
[1779.48 - 1782.96] being protected by with your immune
[1781.64 - 1785.72] system what else is happening inside
[1782.96 - 1787.58] your body all of this matters and are
[1785.72 - 1789.08] you on a lot of caffeine it could be
[1787.58 - 1791.60] somebody that's like drinking a lot of
[1789.08 - 1792.92] caffeine then that lowers the immune
[1791.60 - 1794.84] system you could be somebody that's
[1792.92 - 1796.28] eating a lot of chocolate that lowers
[1794.84 - 1798.86] the immune system
[1796.28 - 1800.96] you know what's crazy
[1798.86 - 1802.10] uh the chocolate dealers the drug
[1800.96 - 1803.90] dealers
[1802.10 - 1805.34] they'll tell you that chocolate's great
[1803.90 - 1807.32] for you they'll throw up they'll throw
[1805.34 - 1809.30] out any science they can at you to tell
[1807.32 - 1810.68] you that chocolate's great for you the
[1809.30 - 1812.78] drug dealers right
[1810.68 - 1815.90] but what you don't realize is chocolate
[1812.78 - 1818.78] knocks down the immune system it hinders
[1815.90 - 1820.76] the immune system knocks it down that's
[1818.78 - 1823.16] why if you just if you eat too much of
[1820.76 - 1827.12] it and just you're just gonna be like on
[1823.16 - 1828.86] this like crazy cacao high right your
[1827.12 - 1831.56] immune system is getting trashed when
[1828.86 - 1833.54] you go on that crazy cacao ride it
[1831.56 - 1834.98] knocks down the immunity the immune
[1833.54 - 1837.62] cells
[1834.98 - 1838.94] somebody compromised by all these
[1837.62 - 1840.80] different pathogens chemicals and
[1838.94 - 1842.90] everything else that's out there gets
[1840.80 - 1844.58] all of a sudden exposed to mold it makes
[1842.90 - 1846.74] it even harder and it makes it difficult
[1844.58 - 1848.66] but then somebody else
[1846.74 - 1850.94] that doesn't have any pathogens or other
[1848.66 - 1852.44] compromises they expose to the same mold
[1850.94 - 1854.24] they get exposed to the same variety
[1852.44 - 1856.46] mold somebody else in the same house was
[1854.24 - 1858.56] exposed to they may not get affected
[1856.46 - 1859.82] some people get affected more than
[1858.56 - 1862.58] others
[1859.82 - 1864.51] mold is a mystery like that all depends
[1862.58 - 1868.71] on what's happening in the person's body
[1864.51 - 1868.71] [Music]
[1869.30 - 1893.20] foreign
[1870.16 - 1893.20] [Music]
[1896.54 - 1901.00] let's get moving on here we go
[1904.64 - 1910.04] somebody said then why does your body
[1907.58 - 1912.02] ask for so much more chocolate or so
[1910.04 - 1913.40] much for chocolate why does our body ask
[1912.02 - 1915.50] for chocolate
[1913.40 - 1917.00] do you guys know the answer to that can
[1915.50 - 1918.14] you guys answer that question for the
[1917.00 - 1921.50] person
[1918.14 - 1924.14] why does the body crave chocolate if
[1921.50 - 1926.90] chocolate lowers the immune system you
[1924.14 - 1930.58] guys got the answer right
[1926.90 - 1930.58] you don't need me for that answer
[1930.74 - 1935.42] I mean we know that those are short
[1932.30 - 1936.98] halftime Robinson said a smiley face
[1935.42 - 1939.14] that's a short halftime that was really
[1936.98 - 1941.72] short
[1939.14 - 1943.70] because someone said I saw that it never
[1941.72 - 1945.86] asks because of the caffeine addiction
[1943.70 - 1947.24] Michelle L got it
[1945.86 - 1948.86] you guys want to do the robot with me
[1947.24 - 1950.48] let's hit the halftime
[1948.86 - 1952.10] let's do it you guys want to do a good
[1950.48 - 1953.84] one we'll do it right in your house you
[1952.10 - 1955.82] guys are doing it
[1953.84 - 1957.14] if you're if you can't stand up or
[1955.82 - 1958.52] something you got to sit down just do it
[1957.14 - 1960.32] sitting down
[1958.52 - 1963.10] yeah
[1960.32 - 1963.10] let's start
[1963.47 - 1982.07] [Music]
[1983.42 - 1998.60] awesome
[1985.69 - 2000.78] [Music]
[1998.60 - 2000.78] foreign
[2002.28 - 2005.92] did you do the robot
[2004.54 - 2007.90] okay
[2005.92 - 2010.72] so what happens is yeah
[2007.90 - 2014.20] it's about our immune system so mold
[2010.72 - 2016.00] can eat up did you guys hold your breath
[2014.20 - 2018.28] except because I hold my breath while
[2016.00 - 2020.44] you're the robot the whole time
[2018.28 - 2021.82] anyway maybe I should change that up
[2020.44 - 2024.04] start breathing
[2021.82 - 2026.20] when I'm doing the robot
[2024.04 - 2027.22] but you can't stay super still if you do
[2026.20 - 2030.28] that it's good like you're breathing
[2027.22 - 2031.96] like I'm a robot that's alive I'm
[2030.28 - 2033.22] breathing while I'm working
[2031.96 - 2035.32] okay
[2033.22 - 2037.42] Aubry says studies show when craving
[2035.32 - 2040.12] sweets it means you're lacking in
[2037.42 - 2042.22] essential nutrients really do those same
[2040.12 - 2044.74] studies know why anybody's sick
[2042.22 - 2047.68] to the same studies know why everybody's
[2044.74 - 2049.24] got lupus Hashimoto's multiple sclerosis
[2047.68 - 2051.70] or anything else
[2049.24 - 2054.88] they need to read the caffeine chapter
[2051.70 - 2056.80] in the brain saver books so you know
[2054.88 - 2058.00] so when you're craving a chocolate bar
[2056.80 - 2060.94] you're not craving something sweet
[2058.00 - 2062.26] you're craving the caffeine the high
[2060.94 - 2064.18] that's what you're craving a chocolate
[2062.26 - 2066.46] bar you're craving all that caffeine
[2064.18 - 2068.32] breaks down the immune system that's
[2066.46 - 2070.24] what I was talking about before you read
[2068.32 - 2071.26] the caffeine section in the brain saver
[2070.24 - 2074.14] books
[2071.26 - 2075.04] so the thing is with studies so studies
[2074.14 - 2076.84] show
[2075.04 - 2079.24] when creating sweets it means you're
[2076.84 - 2081.64] lacking essential nutrients right
[2079.24 - 2085.66] but studies don't know why anybody is
[2081.64 - 2088.78] sick so it's it's a tough call there
[2085.66 - 2091.30] you can be sick for 30 years and read
[2088.78 - 2095.50] that study along with thousands of other
[2091.30 - 2099.10] studies and stay sick for 30 more years
[2095.50 - 2101.32] you can be sick for 60 years 70 years
[2099.10 - 2104.92] your whole life's sick
[2101.32 - 2106.72] with 10 different diagnoses labels a
[2104.92 - 2109.48] hundred symptoms
[2106.72 - 2111.40] and then you'll get the study shows why
[2109.48 - 2113.38] you're craving sweets or the study shows
[2111.40 - 2115.60] caffeine's good for you or the study
[2113.38 - 2117.70] shows that now coffee is good for you or
[2115.60 - 2119.74] the study shows that antioxidants are
[2117.70 - 2121.30] good for you something or some whatever
[2119.74 - 2124.42] it is
[2121.30 - 2127.54] it doesn't it's not enough so you can't
[2124.42 - 2130.12] it's like how do you trust the study
[2127.54 - 2132.28] when they don't have one answer to why
[2130.12 - 2133.60] anybody's sick it's really painful when
[2132.28 - 2135.04] you think about it and then you don't
[2133.60 - 2137.80] know how the study works and I talk
[2135.04 - 2139.90] about that in medical medium books
[2137.80 - 2142.06] Melissa said thank you for the trauma
[2139.90 - 2145.48] loss brain shot just in time for my
[2142.06 - 2148.66] mother-in-law's passing oh so sorry to
[2145.48 - 2150.58] hear that it really does help I've been
[2148.66 - 2153.46] a friend of mine had something happen to
[2150.58 - 2156.10] them and I I recommended the trauma loss
[2153.46 - 2158.56] brain shot too and it gave them some
[2156.10 - 2161.02] peace as well so I'm happy to hear that
[2158.56 - 2161.86] uh what I what I recommend is you use it
[2161.02 - 2164.02] a lot
[2161.86 - 2165.94] you use it a lot so you do it more than
[2164.02 - 2168.58] once and I was telling a friend of mine
[2165.94 - 2171.58] you do the trauma shock loss uh you know
[2168.58 - 2173.86] shot you do it more than once
[2171.58 - 2175.72] Robin said did you did the dream shot
[2173.86 - 2178.24] last night
[2175.72 - 2181.18] and wow what a beautiful meaningful
[2178.24 - 2183.70] dream I had incredible
[2181.18 - 2185.02] I I have a personal connection with the
[2183.70 - 2187.60] dream shot
[2185.02 - 2189.46] I love that one I was doing that one
[2187.60 - 2190.90] when Spirit of compassion gave me this
[2189.46 - 2193.06] information and I was getting it all
[2190.90 - 2195.46] down for the books
[2193.06 - 2196.42] I was I wasn't getting a lot of sleep I
[2195.46 - 2198.28] was trying to get with the book
[2196.42 - 2199.78] deadlines done trying to get the books
[2198.28 - 2200.86] done and I only got like a half an hour
[2199.78 - 2203.74] sleep
[2200.86 - 2206.02] a one-hour sleep some days and I was
[2203.74 - 2208.12] just pushing and pushing and pushing so
[2206.02 - 2209.68] when I would get like a one or two hour
[2208.12 - 2212.08] chance to sleep
[2209.68 - 2213.34] I would take that dream shot down
[2212.08 - 2216.16] and then
[2213.34 - 2218.56] oh my God the dreams I had within that
[2216.16 - 2221.20] one hour that two hour it was like
[2218.56 - 2223.96] unbelievable what was happening it was
[2221.20 - 2226.54] incredible I mean it was revelational it
[2223.96 - 2227.50] was just on just incredible so all right
[2226.54 - 2228.94] so you're talking about the immune
[2227.50 - 2232.06] system we're talking about the mold
[2228.94 - 2234.76] exposure how our immune system has to
[2232.06 - 2237.52] gobble up the mold has to eat it up
[2234.76 - 2239.56] right and how our immune cells they
[2237.52 - 2240.88] weaken but we're up against so many
[2239.56 - 2242.32] other things as I was talking about
[2240.88 - 2243.94] earlier I know we gave you guys the
[2242.32 - 2246.28] mosquito spray talk and everything else
[2243.94 - 2249.40] and I didn't even give you the Sea Trail
[2246.28 - 2251.08] talk too all the sea Trails right the
[2249.40 - 2252.40] stuff pouring down on us all the sea
[2251.08 - 2257.44] trails
[2252.40 - 2260.14] okay the letter c the letter c not s e a
[2257.44 - 2261.40] the letter c for anyone just coming on

[2329.92 - 2335.38] heart beat felt so normal last night I
[2333.04 - 2338.38] felt so good this is what I wanted
[2335.38 - 2340.24] this is what I was promised
[2338.38 - 2343.66] when I was taking the information down
[2340.24 - 2345.76] for the brain shot therapy for the books
[2343.66 - 2348.28] from Spirit of compassion
[2345.76 - 2349.48] I was promised you guys would get some
[2348.28 - 2351.64] healing done
[2349.48 - 2354.04] from these brain shots
[2351.64 - 2355.48] that's what I was told that's what I was
[2354.04 - 2358.72] promised
[2355.48 - 2361.54] I don't like broken promises
[2358.72 - 2364.24] I don't like being told something that's
[2361.54 - 2366.22] not going to happen and and it does in
[2364.24 - 2368.02] when SOC tells me
[2366.22 - 2369.58] like The Meta like the medical medium
[2368.02 - 2371.38] heavy metal detox cleanses are going to
[2369.58 - 2374.80] get the metals out they do and they have
[2371.38 - 2376.18] I I know people I know doctors
[2374.80 - 2378.40] that are seeing results in their
[2376.18 - 2379.66] patients that's unreal by using the
[2378.40 - 2382.12] medical medium heavy metal detox
[2379.66 - 2385.06] cleanses right now out of the brain
[2382.12 - 2386.74] saver books so
[2385.06 - 2390.94] when it came down to the brain shot
[2386.74 - 2393.58] therapy like and SOC was telling me
[2390.94 - 2395.02] and I was writing it down how they give
[2393.58 - 2397.30] instant relief and I was writing that
[2395.02 - 2399.04] down and then how they absorb in the
[2397.30 - 2401.56] mouth that I was writing that down
[2399.04 - 2403.30] and then how the brain shots are
[2401.56 - 2405.10] systematically synergistically put
[2403.30 - 2407.20] together
[2405.10 - 2408.88] and because of their combination they
[2407.20 - 2410.32] can do this certain thing I was just
[2408.88 - 2413.08] like oh my God this is incredible
[2410.32 - 2415.00] instant results is what I want it to
[2413.08 - 2417.46] happen and that's what was promised of
[2415.00 - 2419.14] me promise to me many many will have
[2417.46 - 2421.12] instant results and some will be getting
[2419.14 - 2423.46] relief
[2421.12 - 2424.66] that they noticed a little bit later so
[2423.46 - 2426.94] that's another thing with the brain shot
[2424.66 - 2428.86] therapy so here's how it works
[2426.94 - 2431.20] many people are going to get instant
[2428.86 - 2435.10] results I will tell you this you will
[2431.20 - 2437.68] feel something instantly no matter what
[2435.10 - 2439.60] the results can come later through the
[2437.68 - 2441.88] progression of the cleanse 10 day 20 day
[2439.60 - 2443.68] or 30 day the results can come later to
[2441.88 - 2445.54] how many you do a day it says it in the
[2443.68 - 2447.46] book all the details are in here the
[2445.54 - 2450.16] results can come
[2447.46 - 2452.86] even later and sneak up on you but
[2450.16 - 2455.32] you'll get you'll feel something
[2452.86 - 2457.24] instantly within like for me it's second
[2455.32 - 2458.68] sift every single time for you it might
[2457.24 - 2460.78] be after you had the shot and you sat
[2458.68 - 2462.58] there for five minutes but each person
[2460.78 - 2464.56] you're gonna get so you're gonna feel
[2462.58 - 2466.96] something
[2464.56 - 2469.30] Susan said I slept so soundly last night
[2466.96 - 2470.92] and feel rested for the first time in a
[2469.30 - 2472.96] long time since starting brain shots
[2470.92 - 2476.56] last week that's exactly what I'm
[2472.96 - 2478.36] talking about you're getting results
[2476.56 - 2480.04] and it's a week later and you're getting
[2478.36 - 2483.82] results
[2480.04 - 2486.52] Esther says I hated cilantro before I
[2483.82 - 2489.22] did the heavy metal detox movie and now
[2486.52 - 2491.62] I actually like it that's incredible
[2489.22 - 2494.50] used to gag drinking it because I would
[2491.62 - 2498.94] juice it separate from the smoothie
[2494.50 - 2502.00] now I put more in to get the taste that
[2498.94 - 2505.54] means your metals are dropping
[2502.00 - 2507.94] your chemical load is dropping
[2505.54 - 2510.34] I talk about that in the books Esther
[2507.94 - 2513.04] did you see it in here I talk about it
[2510.34 - 2515.74] in the book right here it's in the brain
[2513.04 - 2517.36] saver books I go into detail about how
[2515.74 - 2519.64] it works with cilantro and how you can
[2517.36 - 2522.70] hate the taste to begin with be totally
[2519.64 - 2524.44] repulsed by it and then you start to
[2522.70 - 2525.22] heal and get the metals and chemicals
[2524.44 - 2527.56] out
[2525.22 - 2529.36] but doing the heavy metal detox smoothie
[2527.56 - 2531.22] or cleanse and then what happens is all
[2529.36 - 2532.54] of a sudden you like the cilantro and it
[2531.22 - 2536.04] gets better and it gets better and it
[2532.54 - 2536.04] gets better how incredible
[2537.34 - 2542.50] so much good information to talk about
[2539.02 - 2544.98] let's talk about this now
[2542.50 - 2544.98] let's go
[2545.14 - 2549.16] we're in the medical medium brain shot
[2546.70 - 2551.20] therapy cleanses right here
[2549.16 - 2553.78] we're an entry level
[2551.20 - 2555.40] but can I say something if you guys are
[2553.78 - 2557.68] okay with this
[2555.40 - 2560.32] Enlightenment is not about being
[2557.68 - 2563.88] all-knowing Enlightenment is the freedom
[2560.32 - 2566.68] to be at peace before you have because
[2563.88 - 2568.54] you have full control over what resides
[2566.68 - 2570.64] inside of you
[2568.54 - 2572.50] and inside your brain since we don't
[2570.64 - 2573.76] have control about whatever resides out
[2572.50 - 2577.48] there because that's what happens you
[2573.76 - 2579.16] guys I'm on page 516 for the moment
[2577.48 - 2580.78] we don't have full control of the
[2579.16 - 2583.00] outside world
[2580.78 - 2585.58] Enlightenment is having full
[2583.00 - 2587.62] cover your your body that's a big part
[2585.58 - 2590.68] of enlightenment
[2587.62 - 2593.50] so when you use your free will
[2590.68 - 2594.76] to work on your healing Enlightenment is
[2593.50 - 2597.64] there
[2594.76 - 2602.80] that's what enlightenment really is it's
[2597.64 - 2605.14] your free will saying I am going to work
[2602.80 - 2609.28] on my healing process
[2605.14 - 2611.98] I am going to do something for my health
[2609.28 - 2614.14] that can turn it around
[2611.98 - 2617.92] I'm going to work on my brain I'm going
[2614.14 - 2619.90] to use my own brain to heal my own brain
[2617.92 - 2624.04] that's Enlightenment right there I'm
[2619.90 - 2626.70] going to take my free will my intentions
[2624.04 - 2631.30] I'm going to direct it to healing myself
[2626.70 - 2635.02] with powerful information from above
[2631.30 - 2637.48] so I can heal
[2635.02 - 2639.58] that's enlightenment
[2637.48 - 2641.32] I'm going to take control over my
[2639.58 - 2643.24] healing process I'm going to take
[2641.32 - 2646.66] control over my health no one's going to
[2643.24 - 2650.20] Own Me No One's Gonna own my soul
[2646.66 - 2653.02] I am my own person my own soul that's
[2650.20 - 2655.48] empowerment that's enlightenment
[2653.02 - 2660.48] I did not do anything wrong to get sick
[2655.48 - 2660.48] it's not my fault I'm not a bad person
[2660.58 - 2666.28] that's Enlightenment when you realize
[2663.34 - 2668.98] that I am working on my healing I'm
[2666.28 - 2671.26] doing my full free will into it I'm
[2668.98 - 2674.20] using my intentions
[2671.26 - 2675.88] that's enlightenment
[2674.20 - 2678.82] what's incredible about the brain shot
[2675.88 - 2680.68] therapy is it enhances your
[2678.82 - 2682.36] clearantvoyant skills that are deep down
[2680.68 - 2684.22] your gifts that are deep down in there

[2722.44 - 2729.76] you can still bring in your brain shot
[2725.86 - 2731.62] but keep in mind there's a scale
[2729.76 - 2734.56] you might be bringing in the brain shot
[2731.62 - 2737.02] and it's helping you to battle
[2734.56 - 2739.00] your caffeine addiction
[2737.02 - 2740.86] your apple cider vinegar addiction that
[2739.00 - 2742.06] you don't know you even have
[2740.86 - 2745.00] right

[2746.92 - 2752.20] your bad supplements like charcoal and
[2749.68 - 2753.70] whatever chlorella and whatever else
[2752.20 - 2756.10] you're doing that's actually bad for you
[2753.70 - 2758.50] and then you're doing the brain shot
[2756.10 - 2760.72] therapy so now you're about your brain
[2758.50 - 2762.34] shot therapy is actually not only trying
[2760.72 - 2764.56] to give you instant relief but it's
[2762.34 - 2765.88] battling all this other stuff that's not
[2764.56 - 2767.92] good for you

[2797.50 - 2801.40] prepared they're heavy

[2801.40 - 2805.54] one book publisher could not put it out
[2803.38 - 2807.52] there it'd be a 10 pound book

[2819.04 - 2826.36] that's what all this is
[2821.92 - 2828.64] and I'm not naive like I was naive when
[2826.36 - 2830.92] I was younger about something else say
[2828.64 - 2834.54] Sophie's healing said that this shots
[2830.92 - 2834.54] are true miracles
[2834.94 - 2838.96] I was naive when I was younger I thought
[2836.80 - 2841.18] everybody once you have the answers the
[2838.96 - 2843.10] whole world will just have parades over
[2841.18 - 2845.44] it you know and celebrate but that's not
[2843.10 - 2848.20] how the world works it's an evil world
[2845.44 - 2851.26] see um Brenda says instant starting
[2848.20 - 2853.72] instantly started laughing after the
[2851.26 - 2856.90] portrayal and broken trust shot and had
[2853.72 - 2859.60] the biggest smile that I've had in years
[2856.90 - 2861.76] incredible
[2859.60 - 2864.58] that's amazing
[2861.76 - 2867.88] all after an emotional blow after work
[2864.58 - 2869.38] my God that's incredible so you had this
[2867.88 - 2872.14] laugh attack
[2869.38 - 2874.84] from that shot all after a really hard
[2872.14 - 2876.10] day at work with an emotional blow so as
[2874.84 - 2877.66] I was saying before you guys I was
[2876.10 - 2880.42] really naive when I was younger I
[2877.66 - 2882.88] thought that since I was hearing this in
[2880.42 - 2885.88] incredible voice that was giving me
[2882.88 - 2887.50] Advanced Medical information about how
[2885.88 - 2890.26] to heal and about how the world works
[2887.50 - 2893.20] and everything else I thought for sure
[2890.26 - 2896.14] that the whole world would just want
[2893.20 - 2899.08] what's here but I learned that's not how
[2896.14 - 2901.54] the world works the world is crafted to
[2899.08 - 2903.58] condition people and brainwash people
[2901.54 - 2906.34] and confuse people so they can't always
[2903.58 - 2907.66] get the answers so I realize now I'm not
[2906.34 - 2909.04] naive about it there's a lot of people
[2907.66 - 2911.32] that are never gonna
[2909.04 - 2912.58] get these books in their hands billions
[2911.32 - 2914.08] of people in the world and they're just
[2912.58 - 2916.24] not going to experience this and it's so
[2914.08 - 2921.34] sad I just I have to live with it

[2942.82 - 2945.16] friend's house and you're concerned

[2960.04 - 2964.06] days after I take them and I hear that a
[2962.26 - 2967.24] lot by people too it can happen a couple
[2964.06 - 2970.84] days you feel nothing at first then by
[2967.24 - 2973.24] day two dramatic change agitation gone
[2970.84 - 2975.16] and attention span increased that's when
[2973.24 - 2976.78] they're working on a deeper level that's
[2975.16 - 2978.58] when they're that's incredible and
[2976.78 - 2980.74] that's how it works
[2978.58 - 2982.78] Melissa said I thought the mold exposure
[2980.74 - 2985.18] shot would hurt my stomach because of
[2982.78 - 2987.88] all the Rosemary indeed there's a lot of
[2985.18 - 2990.22] Rosemary but it didn't hurt at all it
[2987.88 - 2993.34] was strong but I still liked it God
[2990.22 - 2994.96] bless you that you like the shot I'm
[2993.34 - 2998.26] probably not gonna like mine because I
[2994.96 - 3001.34] had one before and I went
[2998.26 - 3001.34] because it's strong
[3001.38 - 3006.60] mold exposure shot let's hit it
[3004.02 - 3008.04] here we are you guys so let's start
[3006.60 - 3009.48] making the mold exposure shot but I'll
[3008.04 - 3011.82] talk about it for a quick second as well
[3009.48 - 3013.68] you're visiting somebody who's living in
[3011.82 - 3016.20] a moldy house or building you're working
[3013.68 - 3018.06] in a workspace that's moldy you're
[3016.20 - 3020.46] inhaling mold off of another person's
[3018.06 - 3021.96] clothing say you had a bunch of wet Rags
[3020.46 - 3024.12] that were sitting somewhere in the
[3021.96 - 3026.04] corner of your house you didn't know
[3024.12 - 3027.54] about it and I don't know we're on the
[3026.04 - 3030.06] front porch or wherever you're living
[3027.54 - 3031.86] and you smell the mold and you can take
[3030.06 - 3034.50] the shot and do it
[3031.86 - 3037.08] hope for healing said I feel immediate
[3034.50 - 3038.88] results incredible I get hit with a
[3037.08 - 3042.80] feeling no matter what when I'm taking
[3038.88 - 3042.80] the second sip sometimes the first sip
[3046.20 - 3050.66] so let's go into it let's start working
[3048.24 - 3050.66] on it
[3051.90 - 3060.12] let's get the juicer out
[3054.78 - 3062.58] so once again the mm-1500 20 off
[3060.12 - 3063.90] find if you have a juicer already it's
[3062.58 - 3066.24] not going to squeeze out as much juice
[3063.90 - 3069.00] as this one will I've tried them all
[3066.24 - 3070.92] they don't so keep in mind when you buy
[3069.00 - 3073.02] less produce or you juice less produce
[3070.92 - 3075.96] or you buy produce and you get more
[3073.02 - 3078.18] juice you save money it's money back in
[3075.96 - 3080.34] the bank the one thing I said since the
[3078.18 - 3082.80] beginning of the mm-900 and the mm-1500
[3080.34 - 3084.60] is it pays for itself
[3082.80 - 3086.88] I haven't talked about the g-shirt in a
[3084.60 - 3088.86] long time and because of that the juicer
[3086.88 - 3091.38] sharks all came into the medical meme
[3088.86 - 3093.24] Community sold people bum juicers in my
[3091.38 - 3095.16] opinion because they're juicers that
[3093.24 - 3097.80] don't squeeze out that much juice and
[3095.16 - 3101.10] they're all gimmicky it's sad but true
[3097.80 - 3102.90] and the rising cost of food
[3101.10 - 3105.24] the whole point is the reason why I
[3102.90 - 3107.28] backed up and endorsed this user was
[3105.24 - 3109.98] because of the rising cost of food
[3107.28 - 3111.66] because they figured out a way to create
[3109.98 - 3113.88] more compression
[3111.66 - 3116.82] to make sure that we squeeze more out of
[3113.88 - 3118.56] stuff twenty percent off mm-1500 but
[3116.82 - 3121.02] it's not all omegas it's just the
[3118.56 - 3123.36] mm-1500 900 but I want people to know
[3121.02 - 3124.50] because I feel bad and then I feel
[3123.36 - 3126.90] guilty
[3124.50 - 3129.12] so I need the guilt and shame shifter
[3126.90 - 3130.74] you know basically and that's what I was
[3129.12 - 3132.18] thinking about I was like after the 10
[3130.74 - 3135.36] day
[3132.18 - 3137.34] after the 10-day um
[3135.36 - 3139.26] challenge I'm gonna do the guilt and
[3137.34 - 3141.00] shame shifter for me because I feel
[3139.26 - 3142.74] guilty I wasn't screaming from the
[3141.00 - 3145.44] rooftops about the juicer every 10
[3142.74 - 3147.54] minutes you know like it's hard it's it
[3145.44 - 3149.76] makes me feel like when people get taken
[3147.54 - 3150.90] advantage of by sharks it's it's a hard
[3149.76 - 3152.88] one for me
[3150.90 - 3156.18] okay we're on the mold exposure shot
[3152.88 - 3159.08] let's go let's fire it up
