00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,640
back before medical medium really got

562
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,720
out there i mean it's been 35 years now

563
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,039
with medical medium right but

564
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,799
right at the start though you know it

565
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,160
wasn't the millions

566
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,000
right now that are learning about

567
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,840
medical medium info right

568
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,840
um it was obviously a smaller crowd back

569
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:09,360
35 years ago right of course

570
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,720
and but what happened is that back then

571
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,799
everybody was still doing the spiritual

572
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,440
stuff that same thing but people were

573
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,720
still sick

574
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,480
and they were just like well i guess i

575
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,440
attracted i guess it was my karma or

576
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,840
something like

577
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,720
but you know it all falls apart when you

578
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,799
think about

579
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,039
did did the two-year-old manifest it

580
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:27,679
because i'm kind of curious

581
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:29,120
you know like what happened there what

582
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:32,080
about the five-year-old did the

583
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:35,200
five-year-old have some bad karma

584
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,480
no right no there's reasons why we're

585
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,400
sick

586
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,240
and and the thing is with the trendy

587
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,000
traps out there you guys and the trendy

588
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:45,039
products and the trendy traps

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,400
right okay out there the people putting

590
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:48,000
that stuff out there they don't know why

591

anybody's sick

592
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,840
they don't know why it all comes down to

593
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,640
the same old kind of like theories well

594
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:57,039

right april um

615
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,159
you're the only one who's told me why i

616
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,440
have eczema it's life-changing

617
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,840
information

618
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,880
it millions of people have excellent

619
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,320
right

620
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,080
and they don't know why and there's

621
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,799
people with eczema that don't

622
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,640
trust they don't trust that maybe

623
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,320
medical meme information is good because

624
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,159
some troll got to them right one of

625
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,799
those trolls that said i tried it it

626
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:53,840
didn't work but they never tried it

627
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:55,840
right or when some troll comes on in and

628
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,919
hammers them you know and says no

629
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,400
don't do the medical medium stuff he

630
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:02,720
talks to a ghost or something right

631
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:05,120
and you get this you get this and these

632
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,039
are these are discriminators right these

633
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,919
are spiritual racists you know and the

634
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,760
funny thing is

635
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,280
is everybody's supposed to be so

636
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,640
spiritual like so

637
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:16,559
spiritual right now everybody is just so

638
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,159
on their game with being spiritual

639
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,280
that's that's what you see out there now

640
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,640
right

641
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:24,880
but quit to discriminate

642
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,880
against something that's been working

643
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,280
for decades now getting people's life

644
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,600
back

645
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,760
lives back and healing right and then be

646
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:35,440
like no no that guy he's you know he's

647
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,799
he hears a voice no way that's that's bs

648
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,880
you know it's like oh i thought you were

649
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:41,440
spiritual i thought you can handle that

650
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,960
you know i thought you can handle that

651
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,640
you know what i mean you're at your yoga

652
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,600
class or you're doing whatever you can

653
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,960
handle that you're

654
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:50,960
you're spiritual right and but you know

655
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,799
it's amazing how that works but there's

656
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,240
a lot of discrimination and it sets

657
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,919
people back because

658
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,600
now someone's going to be afraid to heal

659
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:00,000
their ex about meanwhile there's

660
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:02,240
tens of thousands of people that got rid

661
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,039
of their excellent psoriasis

662
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,120
like how important is that to get rid of

663
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,400
your eczema your psoriasis it's one of

664
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,440
the greatest

665
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,679
greatest precious things that could ever

666
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,679
happen to someone unless you know what

667
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:18,880
it's like to have that bleeding

668
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:19,360
cracked skin man and be suffering like

669
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,720
you are

670
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:24,480
unless you know what that's like right

671
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,640
unless you've been in that person's

672
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,280
shoes you won't know

673
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,280
you won't know you know you won't know

674
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,679
and when you get there someday

675
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,960
yeah you'll learn fast that guess what

676
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,799
no one knows what causes x

677
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,559
psoriasis except medical medium

678
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,480
information and then when i

679
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:42,559
when i hear from somebody and someone

680
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,200
says hey you know aw

681
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:46,240
you know i just saw someone say how

682
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,320
copper

683
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,760
is behind eczema but they didn't cite

684
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:53,440
you

685
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:56,960
that's another problem all on its own

686
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,720
not citing medical medium information

687
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,720
so now there's a tidbit of medical beam

688
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,360
information that gets out there right

689
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,000
just like the lemon water flushing the

690
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,919
liver

691
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,840
medical medium information right but now

692
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,360
it's it's like common law out there they

693
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,400
even pretend there's science behind it

694
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,280
well that's funny because it comes from

695
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,280
medical medium

696
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,120
which comes from above which comes from

697
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:18,400
spirit of compassion right

698
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:21,280
it's like it's like okay um now it's

699
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,000
yeah this gets copper out of your out of

700
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,000
your system

701
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,280
for example copper there's no science of

702
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,880
research that says copper causes

703
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,919
exopsrisis that's medical medium

704
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,480
information

705
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,200
right and it doesn't get cited the sad

706
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,280
part about

707
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,039
it not getting cited is how's that

708
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,159
person gonna heal now

709
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,159
they're just going to take somebody's

710
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,640
gut health product or something and

711
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,000
still

712
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,279
or they're going to take somebody else's

713
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,640
whatever or they're going to take

714
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,400
something that doesn't work

715
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,159
like zeolite and they're going to just

716
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,960
you know and meanwhile they have a

717
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,279
tidbit

718
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:51,200

margaret valentine good to see you

735
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,279

736
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:30,799
you at a retreat

737
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:32,240
for being concerned about fat and i

738
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:34,159
think someone was putting

739
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,000
all this fat on top of potatoes or

740
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,720
something or they told you

741
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,600
it was okay at the retreat that's what

742
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,559
they told you

743
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,559
and then they said why did you do that

744
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:46,720
and they shamed you or they shamed you

745
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:49,279
the other way around i can't remember

746
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,559

and it just it just

748
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:53,600
the story hit me because it was like

749
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,440
yeah exactly

750
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,720

00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,520
field the way it works you guys i'm

752
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,679
putting

753
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,279
my potato on here i just i had a weak

754
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:03,360
spoon and it just actually did a little

755
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:04,960
snap

756
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,200
lorraine what do you think about that

757
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:10,159
one

758
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,640
um but i'll tell you right now i'm gonna

759
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,720
get another spoon in a second

760
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,919
it's it's really incredible how things

761
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,760
work

762
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,039
out there i've seen a lot of that in

763
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,480
retreats too i've

764
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:24,480
seen a lot of shaming go on in retreats

765
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,919
i'm not saying retreats are bad i'm not

766
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,840
saying anything like that i'm just

767
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:30,159
saying

768
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:33,039
validate someone's experience out there

769
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:34,720
validate their stories right and that

770
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:38,000
leads me to the next part

771
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:40,720
right is here you are you

772
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,760
heal you work your butt off you're doing

773
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,919
some medical medium

774
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:48,159
information okay you're working hard

775
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,520
you share your story and someone comes

776
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:54,840
on there and says

777
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:58,880
it didn't happen it didn't happen

778
00:25:54,840 --> 00:26:03,840
right or it's in a doctor

779
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:06,400
or uh it was a sugar pill

780
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,840
right it was a sugar pill so i'm

781
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,880
actually got my potatoes in here you

782
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:13,039
guys

783
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,039
i'm gonna replace my wooden spoon

784
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:22,559
um that was one of my favorites

785
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:24,799
ah here's a there's a nice big wooden

786
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:28,000
spoon here

787
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:31,279
so and that's another thing too is

788
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:36,320
you're not allowed to heal

789
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:36,320
um lorraine totally your humor

790
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:40,720
most people who say they did mm too

791
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,520
never read one of the books right

792
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,000
they'll say

793
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,919
they'll say you know they never never

794
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,640
mind all seven of the books they've only

795
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,400
read like

796
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,919
no never even read one i've seen that

797
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,240
before too and the

798
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,320
the in-depth healing information in the

799
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,279
books is a whole other thing that's a

800
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,640
whole other

801
00:26:55,279 --> 00:27:00,400
but what you'll find is people who heal

802
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,080
and they work hard and they get rid of

803
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,000
their lupus their lyme disease with

804
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,799
medical medium information they get rid

805
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,720
of their cfs right on clubhouse you guys

806
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:13,679

00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:16,559
cfs me right the brain inflammation

808
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:17,279
fibromyalgia how about that one too all

809
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,799
kinds of gum

810
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,480
and teeth problems that happen to so

811
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:22,240
many people um

812
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,399
another thing trigeminal neuralgia nerve

813
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:28,480
pain back pain neck pain

814
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:31,600
head pain right you guys um

815
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,919
and all of that and i'm cooking these up

816
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,200
nice

817
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,880
let's see if i know how to use this

818
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:39,440
today the waffle machine

819
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,520
all right so that's cooking got the

820
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:44,320
potato waffles brewing

821
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:46,000
so there's so many people out there that

822
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,399
healed with medical medium information

823
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,039
but what i'm noticing out there is that

824
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:51,919
there's a cult out there and this cult

825
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:54,320
is probably

826
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,440
one of the more evil cults and it's a

827
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,480
science and research

828
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:00,480
cult the science and research cult is

829
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,640
devised of a bunch of people who haven't

830
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,640
been sick yet

831
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,760
and they're there to tell you you didn't

832
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,159
heal

833
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,200
because science didn't approve of it

834
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,679
right

835
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,360
this is the jim jones cult of all time

836
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:15,600
is science research right

837
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,919
you know like the jim jones cult right

838
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:20,640
was was everybody

839
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:21,360
took the kool-aid took the sinai and

840
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,120
they died

841
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:28,240
right they killed themselves and

842
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,039
and it was just a horrifying horrifying

843
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,679
nightmare

844
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:33,360
okay a thousand people they all drink

845
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,200
kool-aid with cyanide and they go down

846
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,120
science research is just like that but

847
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,159
they're the longer

848
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:42,960
version they're the micro micro

849
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,320
dose they're the you're you're drinking

850
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,679
the science and research

851
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:50,159
kool-aid right right and there's a

852
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:53,120
little bit of cyanide in there

853
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:53,520
but you just don't die fast you just

854
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,399
stay

855
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,600
sick and sick while science and research

856
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:00,399
strings you out

857
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,720
and strings you out and then just just

858
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,640
they

859
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,760
chip away at your soul that's such

860
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,440
science and research this just

861
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,120
chips away at your soul with all their

862
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,520
paid for fake studies

863
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:11,279
and they chip away and then while you're

864
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:14,000
waiting on your last breath

865
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:14,320
they finally come out with a new report

866
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,640
they

867
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,600
finally come out with a new report that

868
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,919
matcha tea

869
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:22,799
has a new antioxidant in it and you just

870
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:25,360
lost 30 years of your life

871
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:26,799
hanging on by a thread hoping to god

872
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,919
science and research

873
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:32,480
would actually save you and they don't

874
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:34,720
they don't they're the ultimate cult

875
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,399
literally the ultimate cult right now

876
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,039
you can't break them they're just like

877
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:40,799
robot robots in their cult where's your

878
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:42,640
science where's your science well that's

879
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,840
funny because where's your science

880
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,039
so where's your science where's your

881
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,559
research that's funny because where's

882
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:49,600
your science in research right

883
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:52,240
where's yours because what i'm noticing

884
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,360
now is that people who are saying that

885
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,520
in the cult

886
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,960
so all the cult people in there right in

887
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,919
science research here's what they're

888
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,159
doing

889
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:01,679
they're throwing you a link to a

890
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:03,600
citation

891
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:04,799
right they're throwing you like a

892
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:08,320
citation

893
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:11,200
to a paper not even a study

894
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,840
so you got all these papers out there

895
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,720
they're just

896
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:16,480
they're just observational papers

897
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,120
there's no conclusion

898
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:21,279
there's no facts in them there's nothing

899
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:23,760
so the science research cult is so

900
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:25,039
twisted and evil they don't even give

901
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,600
you a study

902
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:29,279
you don't even get a study anymore

903
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,840
there's no studies in there it's an

904
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:33,120
article so let's just link an article

905
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,880
that was hearsay

906
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,559
and we'll link that we'll throw that in

907
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,880
somebody's face and say well here's

908
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:41,360
here's some science the science research

909
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,799
cult is actually got to such a dangerous

910
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,880
point right

911
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:46,320
where and they they don't care if

912
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,880
anybody heals

913
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:50,559
they don't want anybody to heal it has

914
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:54,000
to be under science's

915
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:56,480
jurisdiction right so you guys don't

916
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,799
deserve to heal

917
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,760
you don't you don't deserve to heal

918
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:02,880
unless science

919
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:06,000
says so unless science says

920
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,600
right and science in the end is a whole

921
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,600
bunch of paid for theories anyway when

922
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:12,640
it comes down to chronic illness

923
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:14,559
science isn't math you guys this is so

924
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:17,919
important to know

925
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:19,039
like science isn't math two plus two is

926
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:23,039
four

927
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:24,240
science research is two plus two is five

928
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:26,080
that's what it is in science and

929
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,159
research it's

930
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,279
there it's not math there so when you're

931
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:31,679
accountant or

932
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:33,279
somebody or somebody you're adding up

933
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,200

00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:59,279
compounded by money hungry beasts behind

946
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,600
there

947
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:02,640

955
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,679

1137
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:51,440

the time the water is soaking up you're

1139
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,960
out there in the ocean

1140
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,160

on planet earth

00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:57,520
someone else is going to have a

1203
00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:00,240
streptococcus because they have utis

1204
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:01,280
or they've got chronic sinusitis and

1205
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:04,240
they're going to have

1206
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,880
a antibiotic resistant streptococcus

1207
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,280
because

1208
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,960
their strep was always there was always

1209
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,319
fed their antibiotics like you're back

1210
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,640

another antibiotic and you meanwhile

1214
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,640
your streptococcus is getting stronger

1215
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:23,040
then we get into a relationship and we

1216
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,800
pass that streptococcus to someone else

1217
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:27,599
now they have this antibiotic-resistant

1218
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:29,520
streptococcus and they're getting utis

1219
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:32,480

00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,119
me oh what

1299
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,640
hmm and i just dropped a little stretch

1300
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:07,520
and i get up and i said okay

1301
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:09,280
all right you want to play that way okay

1302
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:11,520
because i'm gonna make sure

1303
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,560
i'm gonna make sure the world knows how

1304
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,800
to heal

1305
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:16,160
and we're not gonna take any crap and

1306
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,640
that's just the bottom line

1307
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:20,240
it's like you know a friend of mine says

1308
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:22,000
don't wake him up

1309
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:24,000
the guy's already worked for 35 years

1310
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,680
he's worked his butt off he's

1311
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:31,520
a large part of the alternative medicine

1312
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:34,319
foundations built off of his back

1313
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:35,200
and he did it without wanting to take

1314
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:36,960
the credit

1315
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,240
because he lives a spiritual life he

1316
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:41,599
listens to a spiritual

1317
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:44,240
source and it's like it's like

1318
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:46,160
don't wake him up though right and

1319
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:48,400
that's what they continue to do

1320
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:50,480
so they get mad because they're they get

1321
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:52,800
mad because they're selling their stuff

1322
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:55,119
and they're like well he he's he's he's

1323
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:57,839
trying to protect pregnant women

1324
00:44:55,119 --> 00:45:00,160
he's trying to protect pregnant women

1325
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:03,200
and not let them eat cacao

1326
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:05,119
right while they're pregnant but

1327
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,720
that's making us look bad because we

1328
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,920
tell pregnant women they can have all

1329
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:10,720
the chocolate they want

1330
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:12,319
and they can get their baby all high

1331
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:14,480
right

1332
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:16,560

it

1445
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:41,280
debbie loves stone why is coffee enema

1446
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:44,240
and diatomaceous earth not good how do

1447
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:46,480
these two things cause harm to the body

1448
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:48,000
okay first of all coffee enema let's

1449
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:50,800
just cover that real quick right there

1450
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,680
while we're right here anyway right your

1451
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:55,200
stomach

1452
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:57,119
is there to buffer a poison caffeine

1453
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,960
is a psychoactive drug that we're not

1454
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:02,160
supposed to consume

1455
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:03,440
it ages women quickly beats their

1456
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:05,280
adrenal glands down

1457
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:07,040
gives them difficult pregnancies and

1458
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:09,119
births for baby births

1459
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:11,599
and it causes all kinds of wrinkles in

1460
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:13,839
the skin sun spots malaysia

1461
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:15,200
all that on the skin and hair loss for

1462
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:17,200
women right because women aren't

1463
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:19,200
technically supposed to lose their hair

1464
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:21,440
they're not supposed to

1465
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:23,200
okay it's not like men right women are

1466
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:25,040
not supposed to lose their hair

1467
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,640
but they lose it because of caffeine

1468
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:28,480
that's one reason why they lose it their

1469
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:29,119
adrenals get beaten down by other things

1470
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,599
but

1471
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:33,359
caffeine is really a poison right and

1472
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:35,119
then it keeps them high and addicted and

1473
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:36,720
they spend a whole life addicted and

1474
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:38,240
that's how the caffeine industry wants

1475
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:40,400
them they want them addicted but

1476
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,599
what goes wrong with when it's a coffee

1477
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:45,520
enema

1478
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:48,559
is nothing's buffering that poison

1479
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:51,520
from getting to your liver and brain

1480
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:52,640
one when you put that coffee up the back

1481
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:55,359
end

1482
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:56,319
nothing buffers it for your brain and

1483
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:58,480
heart

1484
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:59,680
it goes into shock including your liver

1485
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:03,119
it goes into shock

1486
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:06,480
when it when you drink it the lining

1487
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:09,599
of your mouth your esophagus okay

1488
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:12,319
your stomach and your duodenum

1489
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:13,200
are pretty darn strong for a reason

1490
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:15,680
they're there

1491
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:17,040
to buffer a poison because here's the

1492
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,520
deal you guys want to hear something

1493
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:21,440
cool

1494
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:24,160
okay back thousands of years ago

1495
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:26,079
and even not even that far right we

1496
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:30,160
survived by saying

1497
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:32,720
i'm hungry i see a plant on the ground

1498
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:35,440
with a weird berry

1499
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:36,880
i'm gonna risk my life and bite that

1500
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:38,640
berry

1501
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:40,079
and everybody standing around me is

1502
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,559
gonna say you're either gonna live or

1503
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:42,960
die

1504
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:46,000
and if you live we might be able to eat

1505
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:47,599
that food did you know that

1506
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,359
human beings have thousands of years of

1507
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:51,839
that right

1508
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:52,880
trial by era making mistakes in the food

1509
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:55,440
you pick

1510
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:56,400
you eat that berry and if that berries

1511
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,079
poisonous

1512
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,599
you die right in front of your family

1513
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:03,520
and everybody else

1514
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:06,640
right or you get poisoned sick right

1515
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:10,000
that's how it works but your stomach

1516
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:14,000
is the buffer the buffer your stomach

1517
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:18,319
is engineered naturally

1518
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:21,040
not synthetically not gmo engineered

1519
00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:21,920
it's engineered in a way created in a

1520
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:24,960
way

1521
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:25,760
to buffer what poison can possibly enter

1522
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:29,680
it

1523
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:30,079
right so i'm gonna eat that root because

1524
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:33,040
i'm

1525
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:33,599
starving to death whatever climate or

1526
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:36,079
area i

1527
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:38,480
am on the planet i'm starving my butt

1528
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:40,800
off it's make or break do or die

1529
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:42,480
i better just eat those shoots i just

1530
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:44,640
found that popped up in

1531
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:46,960
in the springtime because if i don't eat

1532
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:49,280
those shoots i'm in trouble

1533
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:51,440
you pluck those shoots out and you risk

1534
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:55,520
your life on them that's how it's done

1535
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:58,640
back then right i'm gonna eat

1536
00:52:55,520 --> 00:53:00,640
that mushroom it looks good

1537
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:02,640
it's sitting there i don't know if it's

1538
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:05,520
a poisonous mushroom or not

1539
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:07,040
but i'm gonna eat it and that's how it

1540
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:09,040
was done all these years

1541
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:10,559
nobody knew different they didn't know

1542
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:11,760
if this was poisonous or not

1543
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:14,400
they didn't know you could eat this or

1544
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:16,240
not eat that they didn't know

1545
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,839
but your stomach buffered the poison it

1546
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:21,680
gave you a chance to not

1547
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:23,119
die fast right caffeine is a poison and

1548
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:25,520
the stomach is built to

1549
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:26,240
buffer it to a degree so it can't hit

1550
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:28,480
the brain

1551
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:30,240
fast enough it can't hit the brain it

1552
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:32,400
can't hit the heart fast enough

1553
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:34,480
you don't get the brain and heart rush

1554
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,079
fast because those are the two organs

1555
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:38,559
that your stomach is trying to protect

1556
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:39,680
you from i mean to protect poisons from

1557
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:43,440
getting to

1558
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:46,880
right and so what happens is

1559
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:50,000
that you put you put a poison up your

1560
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:53,119
back end you put poison

1561
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:56,880
into your rectum you get poison

1562
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:59,119
into your colon from behind

1563
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:59,920
right there's no buffer it's not built

1564
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:03,280
like that

1565
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:05,599
no buffer at all at all it goes directly

1566
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:09,280
into the bloodstream in an instant

1567
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:10,880
there's nothing to buffer that caffeine

1568
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,800
anybody who's okay and here's the other

1569
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:16,319
thing why are you doing a coffee enema

1570
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:17,920
doing a coffee enema because you're sick

1571
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:19,520
you think anybody's gonna just do a

1572
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,960
coffee animal when they're feeling fine

1573
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:22,960
and life's great they're playing playing

1574
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:24,400
tennis and drinking their margaritas

1575
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:26,800
and drinking their glasses of

1576
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,440
champagne life is good and they can do

1577
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,119
what they want

1578
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:30,559
go where they want exercise when they

1579
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:32,000
want sleep when they want

1580
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:33,200
do anything they want right you think

1581
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,480
they're gonna go rush out and get a

1582
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:37,119
coffee enema

1583
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:38,640
no we do it because we're sick and we're

1584
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:41,520
looking for answers and now we're on the

1585
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:44,319
road looking for coffee enemas now

1586
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:45,599
but what goes wrong is that when you do

1587
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:48,480
the coffee enema

1588
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:51,680
you kill your adrenals the adrenals get

1589
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:54,559
a direct attack of caffeine

1590
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:56,960
and it causes them to blow out and if

1591
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:59,119
your nervous system is weak tingles and

1592
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:00,960

what are you dealing with fatigue uh

1610
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:35,520

1611
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:37,119
uh floaters in the eyes flashing lights

1612
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:38,319
in your eyes and head

1613
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:40,240

1614
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:41,839
insomnia back pain

1615
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:43,440
feet pain plantar fasciitis what are you

1616
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:45,280
dealing with well guess what

1617
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:47,440
those are all nervous system stuff all

1618
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:49,280
nervous system you put coffee in you

1619
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:50,960
that's caffeine that jacks up your

1620
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:53,440
adrenals both caffeine and your

1621
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:55,440
adrenaline destroy your nervous system

1622
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:57,200
so let's just put coffee up the back end

1623
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,680
because nobody knows why anybody's sick

1624
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:00,880
anyway

1625
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:02,880
think about that every single clinic or

1626
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:03,920
anywhere or anybody who had the idea of

1627
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:06,079
putting coffee

1628
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:07,839
up somebody's behind didn't even know

1629
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:09,680
why you were even in there to begin with

1630
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:12,240
sick with your neurological symptoms

1631
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:13,680
how stupid can you get not the people

1632
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:16,799
getting the coffee enema

1633
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:20,240
the people out there delving it out like

1634
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:22,960
without even a fraction of understanding

1635
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:23,839
right but the answers are here they

1636
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,359
exist

1637
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:26,799
there's thousands of doctors around the

1638
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:28,319
world using medical media books and

1639
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:29,599
learning this so they don't put their

1640
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:32,559
patients through it

1641
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:34,480
right but the more and more people that

1642
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:34,799
get healed the more and more censored i

1643
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,960
get

1644
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:38,240
the more more people that heal the more

1645
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:42,960
and more the world says

1646
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:44,799
whoa that's just too many now

1647
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:46,400
how can this guy's information be

1648
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:48,319
healing that many people

1649
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:50,640
because it's uncool we have to shut this

1650
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:53,920
down we have to calm it down

1651
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:54,400
you know and i was given this gift for

1652
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:56,640
you

1653
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:58,960
i'm not a smart guy and i told you guys

1654
00:56:56,640 --> 00:57:00,799
over and over again

1655
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:02,640
monica says plantar fasciitis caused by

1656
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:03,760
coffee no not at all but it's a really

1657
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:05,200
good question that's caused by

1658
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:06,559
epstein-barr

1659
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:08,640
plantar fasciitis is caused by

1660
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:10,720
epstein-barr it's a nerve inflammation

1661
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:12,160
caused by low-grade viral infections

1662
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:14,480
coffee just

1663
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:16,240
