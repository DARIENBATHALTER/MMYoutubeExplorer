[30.80 - 34.00] little later and answer questions
[32.64 - 37.04] thoroughly
[34.00 - 39.20] um for sure
[37.04 - 41.28] don o'brien said hi how do you feel
[39.20 - 43.68] about the rife machine well
[41.28 - 45.76] the rife machine was around everybody
[43.68 - 48.72] was still sick
[45.76 - 49.12] i remember 35 years you know being in
[48.72 - 51.68] this
[49.12 - 54.08] in this all these years and it would be
[51.68 - 55.76] like okay we got another
[54.08 - 57.92] guessing game another guessing game
[55.76 - 60.40] another guessing game
[57.92 - 61.28] the rife machine was around everybody
[60.40 - 62.72] was sick
[61.28 - 64.88] everybody still had the chronic fatigue
[62.72 - 66.72] syndrome and they had the rife machine
[64.88 - 68.32] still had the chronic fatigue syndrome
[66.72 - 69.28] unless they knew how to do the right
[68.32 - 71.28] tools like
[69.28 - 73.84] really clean up their diet just right
[71.28 - 76.16] know what viruses to go after
[73.84 - 78.56] truly know what they're doing and know
[76.16 - 81.60] what supplements to take
[78.56 - 84.64] to go anti-viral to go anti-bacterial
[81.60 - 86.56] to get the metals out too and then
[84.64 - 88.56] they would make improvements rife
[86.56 - 90.80] machine or no rife machine
[88.56 - 93.36] but back in the rife machine days it was
[90.80 - 95.60] like okay rice machine what next
[93.36 - 97.28] everybody still stays sick what next you
[95.60 - 99.68] know that's what it was like
[97.28 - 101.36] and it the only difference you might get
[99.68 - 103.84] out of the rice machine now
[101.36 - 105.52] is someone's actually maybe taking on a
[103.84 - 106.80] couple of medical medium tools out there
[105.52 - 108.32] because that's what i've seen i've seen
[106.80 - 109.20] people say well the rife machine works
[108.32 - 110.48] for me
[109.20 - 112.32] and then you look at what they're doing
[110.48 - 114.40] what else are you doing and they're like
[112.32 - 117.44] oh i'm doing some celery juice or
[114.40 - 119.20] i'm doing some spirulina or
[117.44 - 120.80] i'm making sure there's no gluten and
[119.20 - 122.96] dairy in here or um
[120.80 - 124.40] and you'll find out then as you gather
[122.96 - 125.68] it up there's a lot of little medical
[124.40 - 128.96] medium tools all
[125.68 - 130.72] spur interspersed in there and
[128.96 - 132.08] and then if they're in the in the mood
[130.72 - 133.36] that they think the right machine might
[132.08 - 135.04] be open then they'll just
[133.36 - 136.40] just call it the rife machine but i mean
[135.04 - 139.04] years ago though it's like everybody
[136.40 - 141.52] with the right machine nobody got better
[139.04 - 142.24] that's how it was um good to be here
[141.52 - 145.84] right here
[142.24 - 146.72] uh jamie woodall says tick tock question

[189.28 - 192.64] you know what's funny you guys have seen
[190.64 - 194.88] comments lately where
[192.64 - 196.40] um because the new videos that i'm doing
[194.88 - 200.00] on tik tok
[196.40 - 200.64] like the cheese butter bread that video
[200.00 - 204.96] there
[200.64 - 206.56] and like the egg video on tik tok
[204.96 - 208.00] so people are i'm getting all these you
[206.56 - 209.84] know new people that
[208.00 - 211.36] that haven't paid attention to medical
[209.84 - 213.68] medium information they heard about
[211.36 - 215.52] medical medium but they really haven't
[213.68 - 216.88] paid attention to it or anything and
[215.52 - 218.64] then they're like
[216.88 - 220.32] leaving comments saying hey you should
[218.64 - 222.88] write a book medical medium
[220.32 - 224.48] you got some cool information you should
[222.88 - 226.64] actually write a book
[224.48 - 228.16] and it's funny because six new york
[226.64 - 230.24] times best-selling books
[228.16 - 231.76] later number one new york times
[230.24 - 234.24] best-selling author
[231.76 - 235.84] um millions of books around the world
[234.24 - 237.44] that have already reversed illness and
[235.84 - 240.64] disease in people
[237.44 - 242.08] um and the and the in the uh results are
[240.64 - 243.68] in it's proven
[242.08 - 245.28] and it's the funniest thing ever when
[243.68 - 247.20] you hear that when you hear that in the
[245.28 - 249.76] comments section all the time
[247.20 - 252.08] medical medium you should write a book
[249.76 - 254.72] it's really it's it's actually funny
[252.08 - 257.52] um tracy phillips says i was wondering
[254.72 - 260.56] about the ozone therapy as well
[257.52 - 263.68] um back years ago
[260.56 - 265.04] ozone therapy was still something that
[263.68 - 267.44] was going down back then
[265.04 - 268.80] but it was all experimental still is you
[267.44 - 270.56] know that's how it is it's like well
[268.80 - 271.76] what do you do with ozone therapy do you
[270.56 - 273.52] breathe it in
[271.76 - 275.52] and that's what happened in the original
[273.52 - 277.12] days back years ago
[275.52 - 278.80] people were breathing it in so they
[277.12 - 280.88] would actually do ozone therapy and
[278.80 - 282.16] breathe it in and it wasn't a good thing
[280.88 - 285.68] that way not that
[282.16 - 287.76] way so um so i'm not a big fan of ozone
[285.68 - 288.96] therapy i'm not saying it's bad right
[287.76 - 291.28] now just i wouldn't
[288.96 - 292.48] i wouldn't use it as an inhalant i
[291.28 - 294.72] wouldn't use it as a
[292.48 - 296.72] a breath tech you know a breath
[294.72 - 297.68] technique therapy where you're breathing
[296.72 - 299.84] it in
[297.68 - 301.20] on that level i wouldn't do it but i
[299.84 - 302.56] mean i just wouldn't recommend that i'm
[301.20 - 305.12] saying if your doctor wants to do that
[302.56 - 306.64] and then and that's what you want to do
[305.12 - 308.56] just do what you're going to do but i
[306.64 - 311.44] wouldn't recommend that
[308.56 - 312.48] but ozone therapy i'm not against it in
[311.44 - 313.92] some dentistry
[312.48 - 315.84] i'm not against it and some other
[313.92 - 318.16] reasons too because the reason why i'm
[315.84 - 319.92] i'm not against it so much with small
[318.16 - 323.52] applications of it but
[319.92 - 325.52] when you're sensitive it's a little edgy
[323.52 - 326.80] and all the people that i've known and
[325.52 - 327.52] all the doctors i've talked to over the
[326.80 - 330.24] years that have
[327.52 - 331.52] have wanted my help to troubleshoot
[330.24 - 333.76] there are people
[331.52 - 335.36] um a lot of sensitive people severe
[333.76 - 336.88] chronic fatigue syndrome neurological
[335.36 - 340.00] problems and ozone therapy was
[336.88 - 340.40] too harsh so you got to apply it just
[340.00 - 343.04] right
[340.40 - 344.40] has to be in small settings or small
[343.04 - 347.28] increments
[344.40 - 348.48] small amounts for certain applications i
[347.28 - 350.32] think i'll do a
[348.48 - 352.72] medical medium podcast apple podcast
[350.32 - 353.60] episode about it so you know just to air
[352.72 - 355.04] it all out
[353.60 - 357.92] because there's a lot to cover right
[355.04 - 358.64] there tiffany says what time on
[357.92 - 360.80] tick-tock
[358.64 - 362.40] well right from here i'm going to
[360.80 - 362.96] instagram live for probably like 10
[362.40 - 365.12] minutes
[362.96 - 366.40] and then from there i'm going right to
[365.12 - 367.60] tick tock live
[366.40 - 370.00] so that's something to keep your
[367.60 - 373.20] notifications on make sure they're set
[370.00 - 373.20] so that you get notified
[373.52 - 376.72] and then so you're you know so you can
[374.80 - 380.00] be there so just look out
[376.72 - 381.36] um or constantly check too
[380.00 - 383.52] because you know constantly be like is
[381.36 - 386.88] he on is he on and check it out
[383.52 - 390.00] so you can catch it um so yeah
[386.88 - 390.00] so important to know
[390.24 - 394.16] so i just saw a question about tinctures
[392.16 - 397.36] and teas
[394.16 - 397.92] would you explain the potency difference
[397.36 - 400.80] between
[397.92 - 401.28] teas and tinctures you can get a lot
[400.80 - 403.04] more
[401.28 - 404.72] extracted from a tincture you can take
[403.04 - 406.00] it in higher dosages if you need to
[404.72 - 408.56] therapeutic wise
[406.00 - 410.16] like four dropper folds of a lemon balm
[408.56 - 411.92] four times a day
[410.16 - 413.52] versus tea it's a little harder to
[411.92 - 415.52] extract it's not as strong
[413.52 - 417.36] you gotta do a lot of it there's a
[415.52 - 419.52] difference but i love the tea
[417.36 - 422.32] but you know so what i do is i like
[419.52 - 424.08] recommending the vimergy lemon balm and
[422.32 - 425.52] so if i had it on me right here i'd show
[424.08 - 428.16] you you guys probably know the vimer
[425.52 - 428.96] gv's and victor i-m-e-r-g-y that's the
[428.16 - 430.96] lemon balm
[428.96 - 432.88] so you know you use the that's what i
[430.96 - 434.48] would do it's like someone's got anxiety
[432.88 - 436.72] i would do like four
[434.48 - 437.68] five dropper fulls of that three four
[436.72 - 438.88] times a day
[437.68 - 440.88] personally that's what i would recommend
[438.88 - 443.60] a family member or a friend
[440.88 - 444.96] and you know i talk about that also when
[443.60 - 446.56] cleanse the heel if you want to take a
[444.96 - 449.60] look and cleanse the heel
[446.56 - 451.52] but but uh the t it's harder to do that
[449.60 - 452.48] i have the lemon balm tea here but still
[451.52 - 454.00] it's a great thing
[452.48 - 456.24] have you know keep it in there the whole
[454.00 - 456.24] bit
[456.56 - 461.12] michelle l the mo the most truth gets
[459.36 - 464.32] the most haters
[461.12 - 467.36] yes so true and boy
[464.32 - 470.88] does medical medium get a lot of hate
[467.36 - 474.64] and guess what still standing
[470.88 - 476.24] still standing all right discrimination
[474.64 - 478.08] lots of discrimination for hearing a
[476.24 - 479.52] voice lots of discrimination
[478.08 - 481.52] for getting people better over these
[479.52 - 482.72] years lots of discrimination for
[481.52 - 485.04] putting out six new york times
[482.72 - 487.12] best-selling books with no pr
[485.04 - 488.16] and marketing what you're gonna hear out
[487.12 - 490.00] there all the time is
[488.16 - 491.84] he's got new marketers now that's why
[490.00 - 493.68] he's doing these tick tock
[491.84 - 495.76] good marketing team good pr and
[493.68 - 498.24] marketing that's funny because
[495.76 - 499.36] i never had pr marketing it's only been
[498.24 - 503.36] done by me
[499.36 - 505.60] and me alone as far as i decide what i'm
[503.36 - 508.08] gonna do i decide how i'm gonna do it i
[505.60 - 510.88] don't have any big pr marketing or
[508.08 - 512.32] a marketing firm breathing down my neck
[510.88 - 514.72] i don't hire a company
[512.32 - 516.88] never did isn't that crazy just could
[514.72 - 518.56] you imagine if i did could you imagine
[516.88 - 520.96] if i put millions of dollars
[518.56 - 522.32] into like these people do out there into
[520.96 - 523.84] like a big big
[522.32 - 525.36] marketing firm can you imagine what
[523.84 - 526.24] medical medium information would be
[525.36 - 527.92] there
[526.24 - 529.52] it would and look what it's doing now
[527.92 - 530.16] organically millions of books around the
[529.52 - 532.40] world
[530.16 - 533.52] it's grassroots look organically healed
[532.40 - 536.00] so many people
[533.52 - 538.00] without marketing in pr and should i
[536.00 - 539.60] shortcut stuff and do the cheat game
[538.00 - 542.00] should i cheat and not have the
[539.60 - 542.64] integrity and hire the big pr marketing
[542.00 - 544.80] firms
[542.64 - 546.64] and just have them pay their way through
[544.80 - 547.60] so that something gets seen should i go
[546.64 - 551.36] the cheap way
[547.60 - 555.36] no i go to the organic grassroots way so
[551.36 - 557.76] that's just the way i do it katie alder
[555.36 - 559.20] katie adler said the haters were wild
[557.76 - 560.80] laugh out loud oh yeah
[559.20 - 562.00] it's been like that for months and
[560.80 - 563.44] months been like that for years
[562.00 - 566.96] especially the last six
[563.44 - 569.76] eight months deanna d.a

[614.00 - 618.80] marketers vicki b if you had marketing
[616.88 - 621.36] anthony you wouldn't be doing lives in
[618.80 - 621.36] your kitchen
[623.12 - 626.96] you see you know marketing firms have
[625.12 - 629.44] tried to bang down my door
[626.96 - 630.96] and said how dare you do it alone you're
[629.44 - 633.36] not allowed to do that
[630.96 - 634.64] you better hire one of us you know
[633.36 - 636.56] marketing companies
[634.64 - 638.56] they they don't like knowing i got
[636.56 - 640.24] somewhere without them
[638.56 - 642.08] and they would probably never let me do
[640.24 - 644.00] it in my own kitchen they would probably
[642.08 - 647.36] never let me sit here in my kitchen
[644.00 - 650.56] talking crap
[647.36 - 653.84] oh it's funny it's funny it's just that
[650.56 - 655.28] i mean look look i've always had people
[653.84 - 657.92] with chronic illness i've always had
[655.28 - 659.92] their back and it's about
[657.92 - 662.00] just being real you know not saying
[659.92 - 664.24] you're being real not that stuff because
[662.00 - 668.40] the marketing companies tell their
[664.24 - 671.12] their uh clients to say be real and say
[668.40 - 672.00] this and that and whatnot right and
[671.12 - 674.64] that's what they do
[672.00 - 676.00] too it's crazy it's crazy i mean people
[674.64 - 678.64] pay them like
[676.00 - 680.24] two million dollars a month i mean stuff
[678.64 - 682.16] like that out there just to get
[680.24 - 683.60] their books seen these you know fancy
[682.16 - 688.56] doctors and some not all of them but
[683.60 - 691.52] it's just crazy how it works
[688.56 - 692.80] christy may what do i do with constant
[691.52 - 695.44] cold sores
[692.80 - 697.52] terrible i don't want to go on valtrex
[695.44 - 700.40] but i have no choice
[697.52 - 702.00] i feel i do lysine eat fruit greens all
[700.40 - 706.40] day potato sweet potatoes
[702.00 - 709.36] and even lettuce spinach nothing bad
[706.40 - 710.80] question mark um so you're doing that
[709.36 - 712.88] you're not doing the nutritional yeast
[710.80 - 713.68] right that can easily stimulate a cold
[712.88 - 715.04] sore
[713.68 - 716.56] you're not doing the apple cider vinegar
[715.04 - 717.60] right just making sure you're not doing
[716.56 - 719.20] chocolate right
[717.60 - 720.88] this did you do chocolate two weeks ago
[719.20 - 721.92] did you do chocolate three weeks ago did
[720.88 - 724.16] you have cacao
[721.92 - 726.32] that that will cause simplex to just
[724.16 - 727.68] bust out that'll just cause it busting
[726.32 - 728.16] out i'm not saying you're doing any of
[727.68 - 730.08] that
[728.16 - 731.76] i'm just asking to make sure in case
[730.08 - 734.72] there's something you have done
[731.76 - 736.40] and and you haven't caught it and then
[734.72 - 737.60] have you tried the simplex protocol in
[736.40 - 739.44] here you can take to your
[737.60 - 742.00] practitioner your family doctor whatever
[739.44 - 743.12] it is and but have you seen that so and
[742.00 - 746.16] cleanse the heel
[743.12 - 748.96] um simplex protocol so
[746.16 - 750.08] check that out maybe give that a try and
[748.96 - 751.60] that's what i would recommend a family
[750.08 - 752.64] member a friend you can always talk to
[751.60 - 755.20] your doctor about it
[752.64 - 756.96] but and so so even though you're eating
[755.20 - 758.96] really clean no chocolate right because
[756.96 - 762.72] chocolate is the
[758.96 - 766.00] chocolate is the the herpes instigator
[762.72 - 768.80] simplex is epstein bars
[766.00 - 769.12] it's it's a trigger it's a trigger it is
[768.80 - 770.72] the
[769.12 - 772.48] it's a trigger i mean a little bit of
[770.72 - 774.40] chocolate once in a blue moon fine or
[772.48 - 776.48] whatever in a recipe once and
[774.40 - 778.64] a while but people do a lot of chocolate
[776.48 - 780.72] so yeah just be careful on those kinds
[778.64 - 782.96] of things
[780.72 - 782.96] um
[785.28 - 790.00] marissa anderson thanks for being here

[822.80 - 827.36] yes i'm really proud of all of you by
[824.32 - 827.36] the way for all you're doing
[827.60 - 832.48] bletchley says what causes your hair or
[830.56 - 835.52] scalp to hurt
[832.48 - 837.60] um a lot of neurotoxins cause that
[835.52 - 839.84] that's one thing that occurs so any kind
[837.60 - 841.60] of neurotoxins can cause that
[839.84 - 843.68] any kind of low-grade viral infection
[841.60 - 846.64] shingles is a big one for that for
[843.68 - 847.68] hair and scalp to hurt or not hair but
[846.64 - 850.00] scalp
[847.68 - 852.24] yeah and well yeah i mean hair too to
[850.00 - 854.32] the scalp area
[852.24 - 856.32] so that can easily do that when you have
[854.32 - 858.56] low grade viral infections so
[856.32 - 859.76] i mean what i would do if my scalp was
[858.56 - 862.88] hurting like that
[859.76 - 864.88] i would be for sure making sure there's
[862.88 - 866.48] no milk cheese butter eggs making sure
[864.88 - 867.36] there's no apple cider vinegar or
[866.48 - 870.40] vinegar
[867.36 - 872.00] making sure that's out of your
[870.40 - 873.44] out of your diet making sure there's no
[872.00 - 875.60] nutritional yeast
[873.44 - 877.20] making sure there's no corn or soy just
[875.60 - 878.72] just try to eliminate those first no
[877.20 - 881.12] pork and i know that's a lot i
[878.72 - 883.20] i know that's a lot but i would do that
[881.12 - 885.20] just to move the needle get the celery
[883.20 - 887.92] juice in see if it starts breaking down
[885.20 - 890.00] any low grade viral stuff
[887.92 - 892.40] and and talk to your doctor i mean you
[890.00 - 894.08] know and say hey look medical medium
[892.40 - 896.08] has helped a lot of doctors and he tells
[894.08 - 897.76] doctors about the fact that low-grade
[896.08 - 898.24] vital stuff hurts the scalp because
[897.76 - 899.92] those are
[898.24 - 901.44] nerves and any kind of nerves means
[899.92 - 902.56] neurotoxins you could talk to a
[901.44 - 904.08] practitioner about that
[902.56 - 905.60] they might the light bulb might hit over
[904.08 - 908.88] their head and they might then help and
[905.60 - 908.88] support you to what you're doing
[909.44 - 914.56] um tiana says anthony please talk about
[913.44 - 916.32] ears ringing
[914.56 - 917.68] i talk about that and cleanse the heel

[935.44 - 938.80] gets inflamed and it starts to swell and
[937.28 - 940.96] that tinnitus can go
[938.80 - 942.40] just crazy it could go they could you
[940.96 - 944.88] could get popping fluttering
[942.40 - 946.88] buzzing humming you could get ringing
[944.88 - 948.32] you could sound like church bells i mean
[946.88 - 951.44] you could sound like
[948.32 - 953.04] sirens like sirens all of it in
[951.44 - 954.88] in the years and it could get brutal and
[953.04 - 956.72] it gets worse at the end of the day or
[954.88 - 958.56] gets worse at night
[956.72 - 960.80] you know you should do medical meeting

[979.44 - 985.76] alicia diane says wish netflix would do
[983.36 - 987.60] a documentary following your journey
[985.76 - 988.88] they've asked me for years that's what i
[987.60 - 990.16] want to talk to you guys about too
[988.88 - 991.12] sometimes i'm glad you brought the
[990.16 - 994.16] question up
[991.12 - 996.08] i've been asked to do tv shows for years
[994.16 - 997.28] and all the networks they've always
[996.08 - 999.12] knocked on my door they want to do the
[997.28 - 1002.40] medical medium series the tv series but
[999.12 - 1004.16] i always felt that it wasn't going to be
[1002.40 - 1006.08] it wasn't going to be enough about the
[1004.16 - 1007.36] person it was going to be just me my
[1006.08 - 1009.68] story my gift
[1007.36 - 1011.60] and yeah i guess if he got a really big
[1009.68 - 1012.40] ego that's really a fun thing to do you
[1011.60 - 1014.24] know and
[1012.40 - 1015.84] i'm not saying i don't have an ego right
[1014.24 - 1017.92] everybody's got something in them
[1015.84 - 1019.60] that sparked and says hey wait a minute
[1017.92 - 1023.12] hey wait a minute but
[1019.60 - 1025.20] um but i just don't want it to be about
[1023.12 - 1027.60] me and that's what happened i remember
[1025.20 - 1029.60] over 10 years ago even a little over 10
[1027.60 - 1031.84] years ago i asked to do tv shows meaning
[1029.60 - 1033.28] my own tv series my networks and i know
[1031.84 - 1034.96] anybody else would have many other
[1033.28 - 1037.52] people would have just jumped on it
[1034.96 - 1038.24] and i get asked to this day for netflix
[1037.52 - 1041.36] and other doc
[1038.24 - 1044.48] docu-series documentaries tv shows
[1041.36 - 1046.72] all of it so constantly get asked and
[1044.48 - 1048.32] i turn it down and what do i do i mess
[1046.72 - 1050.00] around on tick-tock
[1048.32 - 1051.52] i don't want to say i turn all those
[1050.00 - 1052.64] things down and yeah those things would
[1051.52 - 1053.92] give me credibility
[1052.64 - 1056.16] they would give me credibility i
[1053.92 - 1057.92] realized that you know big production
[1056.16 - 1060.16] company behind you
[1057.92 - 1061.84] big you know hey let's protect him and
[1060.16 - 1063.68] put him on one of the channels one of
[1061.84 - 1066.24] the cable big cable networks
[1063.68 - 1067.84] his own series and it would give you
[1066.24 - 1069.12] credibility because then probably nobody
[1067.84 - 1071.04] would mess with you you probably
[1069.12 - 1073.44] wouldn't be tried to be messed with or
[1071.04 - 1075.04] tried to be canceled all the time or try
[1073.44 - 1076.96] to be discriminated against you'd have
[1075.04 - 1078.00] like you'd have a big production company
[1076.96 - 1080.40] over your
[1078.00 - 1081.68] over umbrellaing you you know and i
[1080.40 - 1083.20] guess it would give you some credibility
[1081.68 - 1085.36] but you know what i do instead
[1083.20 - 1086.48] i take my beatings take my lashings and
[1085.36 - 1089.36] i hop on tick tock
[1086.48 - 1090.48] and do videos but create the best stocky
[1089.36 - 1092.16] series style
[1090.48 - 1094.64] medical medium podcast to have on

[1247.04 - 1249.84] somewhere out there
[1250.96 - 1255.44] and i'm probably wrong about that from
[1254.00 - 1257.36] what i remember susan janet
[1255.44 - 1259.04] listen to his podcast on anxiety thank
[1257.36 - 1261.20] you it's really a powerful podcast
[1259.04 - 1263.76] episode you guys got to hear it
[1261.20 - 1265.36] evelyn dixon my daughter has lipomas how
[1263.76 - 1267.28] to correct it
[1265.36 - 1268.40] first thing about lipomas to understand
[1267.28 - 1269.76] my poems eat
[1268.40 - 1271.60] they're hungry they have these little
[1269.76 - 1272.24] tentacles coming off of them blood
[1271.60 - 1274.88] vessels
[1272.24 - 1276.24] so if you got a lipoma say you gotta you
[1274.88 - 1279.28] gotta a lipoma
[1276.24 - 1280.80] and it's there fatty tumor it's a fatty
[1279.28 - 1282.72] growth it's got these
[1280.80 - 1284.08] little blood vessels and these blood
[1282.72 - 1287.20] vessels they
[1284.08 - 1290.72] draw up food they draw food to keep the
[1287.20 - 1293.60] lipoma growing right keep it alive and
[1290.72 - 1294.88] what happens is if you're eating eggs

[1379.68 - 1383.84] people get their lives back which is the
[1381.12 - 1385.52] most important thing
[1383.84 - 1388.32] get people off of mattress island and
[1385.52 - 1390.96] couch island
[1388.32 - 1392.08] but you know because that's critical
[1390.96 - 1394.08] it's critical to do that
[1392.08 - 1395.52] critical you guys anybody who just got
[1394.08 - 1396.88] on here i'm going on tick tock i'm going
[1395.52 - 1399.04] to be making dinner i just got to go to
[1396.88 - 1399.60] ig first but then you know and then go
[1399.04 - 1401.84] to
[1399.60 - 1403.20] to tick tock to make dinner and answer
[1401.84 - 1405.80] questions thoroughly
[1403.20 - 1407.36] debra can you please say more about
[1405.80 - 1410.24] osteoporosis yeah
[1407.36 - 1411.28] osteoporosis really bad cases of it
[1410.24 - 1414.84] including you know
[1411.28 - 1418.08] stenosis that come with it including
[1414.84 - 1421.20] um including other things too
[1418.08 - 1423.52] just um ankylosing spondylitis including
[1421.20 - 1426.72] all these different things that occur
[1423.52 - 1428.16] um osteoporosis being like really
[1426.72 - 1430.80] popular that's being like
[1428.16 - 1432.56] one that so many people have a lot of
[1430.80 - 1435.04] times people lose their calcium from
[1432.56 - 1437.12] years of vinegar from years of caffeine
[1435.04 - 1438.80] from years of acidosis that's a big
[1437.12 - 1440.16] piece of it so they lose their calcium
[1438.80 - 1441.76] so when you do vinegars
[1440.16 - 1443.76] your calcium just sucks right out of
[1441.76 - 1446.56] your bones and teeth all of it
[1443.76 - 1448.24] so keep that in mind no vinegars keep
[1446.56 - 1450.72] that in mind no caffeine
[1448.24 - 1452.72] and then leafy greens leafy greens are
[1450.72 - 1454.24] critical so like spinach like medical
[1452.72 - 1456.08] medium spinach soups and
[1454.24 - 1457.76] the medical medium healing broth every
[1456.08 - 1460.32] day if you want hey trisha maurice here
[1457.76 - 1462.24] just saw that comment come up
[1460.32 - 1463.92] incredible so glad you're here oranges
[1462.24 - 1465.92] are important citrus is critical for
[1463.92 - 1468.32] osteoporosis like oranges
[1465.92 - 1470.96] grapefruits lemons those are so
[1468.32 - 1474.72] important for osteoporosis you guys
[1470.96 - 1477.12] so important it's a big deal um
[1474.72 - 1479.04] because that's where the calcium is the
[1477.12 - 1480.24] calcium is there you know broccoli is
[1479.04 - 1482.48] important too but
[1480.24 - 1484.24] but really the citrus is a big deal
[1482.48 - 1485.68] because calcium is deep in the earth and
[1484.24 - 1487.92] the citrus trees the
[1485.68 - 1489.92] roots go deep into the earth and they
[1487.92 - 1493.52] grow in places that are high in calcium
[1489.92 - 1496.32] it's really important um
[1493.52 - 1498.24] really important um yeah so going to
[1496.32 - 1499.04] tick-tock just so you guys know but i'm
[1498.24 - 1500.56] not going to

[1548.88 - 1553.12] have some potatoes today i can't wait
[1551.04 - 1555.12] uh elena says how much salt do you think
[1553.12 - 1558.16] is okay daily
[1555.12 - 1559.60] um make sure you don't do too much uh
[1558.16 - 1561.28] depending on if you're feeling sick and
[1559.60 - 1563.12] you got problems with anything like that
[1561.28 - 1564.56] i would stick to celery juice spinach
[1563.12 - 1566.48] soups keep the salt away
[1564.56 - 1567.84] use lemon on everything have some
[1566.48 - 1569.68] tomatoes in your food
[1567.84 - 1571.52] and that's the kind of salt intake
[1569.68 - 1572.40] that's natural that's really incredible
[1571.52 - 1574.56] for you
[1572.40 - 1575.92] and i would keep back on the salt but if
[1574.56 - 1578.32] you're somebody that really loves salt
[1575.92 - 1580.48] try to do a little bit then if you don't
