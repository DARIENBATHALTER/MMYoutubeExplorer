[168.24 - 172.96] eggplant bacon that's the other recipe
[170.64 - 175.12] now I made that recipe beforehand
[172.96 - 177.16] because I wanted to have it done I'm
[175.12 - 179.08] going to get to these nice crispy pieces
[177.16 - 180.80] of bacon right here maybe do a close-up

[192.16 - 196.00] all right the loaded crinkle cut fries
[193.72 - 200.64] this this is going to be the bacon on
[196.00 - 204.08] top which is so Savory and spicy and
[200.64 - 205.72] yummy it's like barbecue beef ribs the
[204.08 - 207.84] things everybody loves to eat and
[205.72 - 209.88] remembers eating sucking on those ribs
[207.84 - 211.96] in those restaurants where at a cookout
[209.88 - 213.56] right all that fat around the rib and
[211.96 - 215.88] they're just devouring it and they got
[213.56 - 218.16] all that kind of like what is that sauce
[215.88 - 220.32] on top that rib sauce all over it and
[218.16 - 222.52] their face it's all sweet and hot and
[220.32 - 224.28] syrupy and they're like tearing into
[222.52 - 226.88] those ribs and pull the meat off those
[224.28 - 229.72] pork ribs those cow ribs we're not doing
[226.88 - 232.00] that we're using eggplant which is so
[229.72 - 234.76] much better for you you don't need pork
[232.00 - 237.72] fat in your bloodstream people don't
[234.76 - 240.52] really need that but eggplant really
[237.72 - 241.84] exciting great food to work with
[240.52 - 244.52] all right so let's get into it a little
[241.84 - 247.28] bit and just so you know I hear a noise
[244.52 - 249.52] in the distance it is my steamer and my
[247.28 - 252.32] steamer is bubbling up
[249.52 - 253.68] going and what it's doing is it's got
[252.32 - 256.16] carrots in there because we're making
[253.68 - 259.44] the nacho cheese correct we're using
[256.16 - 261.60] cheese that's not the fake garbage vegan
[259.44 - 263.44] cheese that's out there in the store
[261.60 - 265.20] that's got natural flavors in it citric
[263.44 - 266.56] acid and all this junk and all this
[265.20 - 269.44] hidden stuff in there cuz they're
[266.56 - 271.40] allowed to put up up to 10% ingredients
[269.44 - 273.20] in into those vegan cheeses that are not
[271.40 - 274.96] listed on the label so you're sitting
[273.20 - 276.44] with those vegan cheeses at the store
[274.96 - 278.92] and you're like this is great a vegan
[276.44 - 280.16] cheese and it's loaded with all kinds of
[278.92 - 282.24] different garbage and junk and
[280.16 - 284.28] everything we're going to make our own
[282.24 - 287.04] nacho cheese baby we're going to make
[284.28 - 288.56] our own cheese and it's got carrots in
[287.04 - 289.96] there and so forth so I'm excited about
[288.56 - 291.96] that so don't worry about the steamer
[289.96 - 293.88] you hear in the distance cuz I hear it
[291.96 - 296.20] and I love hearing that sound when I
[293.88 - 298.44] hear that sound it's like a beautiful
[296.20 - 301.68] sound in the distance saying healthy
[298.44 - 305.72] food is in inside that steamer and it's
[301.68 - 308.84] sitting there percolating just right
[305.72 - 310.72] anyway um I think we should get down to
[308.84 - 313.80] it is what I think we should
[310.72 - 315.76] do see guys if you just rolled in we're
[313.80 - 317.96] going to talk about hot packs cold packs
[315.76 - 319.56] you name it and I'm going to make a be
[317.96 - 323.52] line really quick to the freezer and I'm
[319.56 - 326.28] going to get an icy icy cold cold pack
[323.52 - 328.64] out which is really important for this
[326.28 - 330.72] demonstration so over here in my freezer
[328.64 - 331.88] I'm opening it up right now I got two in
[330.72 - 334.04] my
[331.88 - 336.68] freezer because if you ever get an
[334.04 - 339.00] injury or you need a cold pack for
[336.68 - 341.92] somebody in the family or a friend or
[339.00 - 345.08] anything it's good to have two because
[341.92 - 346.56] one will eventually not be cold anymore
[345.08 - 348.68] so when you're using it for a knee
[346.56 - 350.00] injury or you're twist your ankle or you
[348.68 - 352.40] sprain your ankle or you're somebody
[350.00 - 355.40] with chronic illness that's just having
[352.40 - 357.84] that unknown chronic inflammation and
[355.40 - 360.08] aches and pains in the body that is
[357.84 - 362.28] mysterious where you just feel like
[360.08 - 364.68] you're 100 years old you wake up in the
[362.28 - 367.12] morning you get out of bed and you feel
[364.68 - 369.56] like you're 80 years old and you're like
[367.12 - 371.76] why do I feel this way everything hurts
[369.56 - 374.04] and aches and you're somebody like that
[371.76 - 377.16] and you rely on cold
[374.04 - 379.12] packs okay and when you rely on them you
[377.16 - 381.80] usually need two so that's one tip all
[379.12 - 383.44] on its own one doesn't really cut it
[381.80 - 386.96] especially if you want to get a good
[383.44 - 389.48] half an hour or 40 minutes into cooling
[386.96 - 391.68] something down getting inflammation down
[389.48 - 393.32] now I know some of you guys do ice baths
[391.68 - 395.04] and stuff like that it's a trendy thing
[393.32 - 397.16] but it I'm going to talk about how that
[395.04 - 399.96] doesn't cut the mustard because it's
[397.16 - 402.68] your entire body going into the cold so
[399.96 - 404.56] it can't localize the area and get the
[402.68 - 407.52] inflammation down that's important to
[404.56 - 409.28] know athletes athletes actually can do
[407.52 - 411.32] ice baths and stuff like that to cool
[409.28 - 413.92] the body temp down if they're really
[411.32 - 416.08] revved up and heated up like seriously
[413.92 - 418.04] they were on the field and they go
[416.08 - 420.44] straight from there or straight from a
[418.04 - 422.60] workout practice and they go right into
[420.44 - 424.20] a cold bath I mean that that's what
[422.60 - 426.80] people do and of course there's other
[424.20 - 428.96] therapies that require cold but when
[426.80 - 431.64] you're chronically sick or you got an
[428.96 - 434.88] injury that's in a certain area you
[431.64 - 436.64] can't do the ice bath and medical mem
[434.88 - 438.72] information I don't recommend the ice
[436.64 - 440.80] baths because what happens is it drives
[438.72 - 443.04] your adrenals into chaos so that's
[440.80 - 446.12] something to know right there now I do
[443.04 - 447.64] see un social a lot of people they're
[446.12 - 449.40] trying out like ice baths and they do
[447.64 - 451.00] the D they dip into it and they get
[449.40 - 453.24] ready they get their suit on or they go
[451.00 - 455.00] in their tub is filled with ice and what
[453.24 - 457.12] they're doing is they're trashing their
[455.00 - 458.64] adrenals and they don't know this I want
[457.12 - 461.28] to go into that a little bit before we
[458.64 - 463.40] go into localizing with cold packs and
[461.28 - 465.32] so forth Uma says I hope you have these
[463.40 - 468.48] listed on your website you can find a
[465.32 - 470.80] link in the description and profile okay
[468.48 - 472.44] at medicalmedium.com that's where you go
[470.80 - 474.52] and you'll find the link that takes you
[472.44 - 477.16] right to the directory area where you'll
[474.52 - 479.32] see things like the the heating pad the
[477.16 - 482.60] hot water bottle and the cold pack of
[479.32 - 484.76] and all that so first all I just want to
[482.60 - 487.20] just go into right away about the ice
[484.76 - 489.52] baths that people are doing okay one
[487.20 - 492.56] thing I don't like about the ice bats is
[489.52 - 495.32] the body thinks it's in danger when you
[492.56 - 497.52] submerge yourself in icy cold water so
[495.32 - 500.24] your body goes into the chaos moment
[497.52 - 501.80] fight or flight and as it goes into
[500.24 - 503.56] fight ORF flight your adrenals are
[501.80 - 505.20] totally just blowing out adrenaline
[503.56 - 508.24] epinephrine everywhere because the
[505.20 - 511.52] adrenaline is rushing through your veins
[508.24 - 514.28] to try to stop you from going into
[511.52 - 517.68] hypothermia keep that in mind so when we
[514.28 - 521.20] do ice bath dips and we do them for
[517.68 - 524.28] quite some time our body goes into
[521.20 - 527.24] urgent urgent emergency
[524.28 - 529.52] emergency something's wrong you have to
[527.24 - 533.24] protect the brain the brain has to be
[529.52 - 535.92] protected so then your adrenals flood
[533.24 - 540.40] literally a big portion of your
[535.92 - 544.00] adrenaline out at once a big portion 85
[540.40 - 546.16] to 90% of adrenaline gets released and
[544.00 - 547.76] spewed out of your adrenals that
[546.16 - 550.40] adrenaline is circulating through your
[547.76 - 553.20] body because it's there to try to keep
[550.40 - 555.84] your blood circulating to try to
[553.20 - 558.04] increase your heart rate so that your
[555.84 - 560.08] heart rate doesn't go down as you go
[558.04 - 562.72] into hypothermia so keep that in mind
[560.08 - 565.92] when we do ice baths this is not an ice
[562.72 - 567.24] bath demonstration or talk but I'm going
[565.92 - 569.80] into that because so many people are
[567.24 - 573.40] going to say whoa if cold p are really
[569.80 - 574.56] good for me if localizing cold packs are
[573.40 - 576.32] really good for me and they're good for
[574.56 - 577.68] my AES and pains let me go do what
[576.32 - 579.92] people are doing out there and let me go
[577.68 - 582.48] hop into a tub with ice and water in
[579.92 - 584.16] there but no that actually lowers the
[582.48 - 586.16] immune system with someone with chronic
[584.16 - 589.32] illness so anyone who's struggling with
[586.16 - 591.32] any kind of condition the Deep ice bath
[589.32 - 593.48] time you know that 5 minutes in the ice
[591.32 - 595.28] bath that 3 minutes that's 10 minutes
[593.48 - 597.12] that 15 minutes people do in the ice
[595.28 - 599.80] bath is actually the worst thing they
[597.12 - 601.64] can do with chronic illness because it
[599.80 - 603.48] it hinders the immune system because
[601.64 - 606.12] when all that adrenaline is released for
[603.48 - 607.64] that figh ORF flate Mo moment when all
[606.12 - 610.12] that adrenaline and epinephrine is just
[607.64 - 611.84] coursing through the veins that wears
[610.12 - 614.20] down your white blood count your killer
[611.84 - 616.60] cells it wears down your lymphocytes it
[614.20 - 618.44] breaks down your immune system and
[616.60 - 620.24] that's what occurs when you do those ice
[618.44 - 622.52] baths so I just want everybody to know
[620.24 - 624.56] that there's a white blood cell right
[622.52 - 627.96] there so when we go and do those ice
[624.56 - 630.48] baths okay it's different when you're
[627.96 - 632.96] someone and you got a raging fever
[630.48 - 636.08] you're somebody that you have a raging
[632.96 - 638.24] fever you can't get it under control
[636.08 - 641.08] you're cooking at a 1004
[638.24 - 642.48] 105 and yes you get into the tub for a
[641.08 - 645.24] little bit to try to drive that
[642.48 - 647.00] temperature down but I'm talking about
[645.24 - 648.72] therape you're talking to your doctor
[647.00 - 649.76] and the whole bit about it I'm talking
[648.72 - 652.28] about
[649.76 - 654.52] therapeutically the ice baths create a
[652.28 - 657.08] lot of Chaos in the body jack up the
[654.52 - 658.56] adrenaline lower the white blood cell
[657.08 - 660.76] count if you're somebody with chronic
[658.56 - 663.20] illness that that is not going to fix a
[660.76 - 665.60] problem it's going to set somebody back
[663.20 - 668.44] it'll if they do it regularly it's going
[665.60 - 670.04] to give them adrenal fatigue over time
[668.44 - 671.48] so you know it's interesting you'll see
[670.04 - 673.72] people out there you're like yeah my
[671.48 - 675.40] adrenals aren't good and I got to do
[673.72 - 677.72] things that protect my adrenals and
[675.40 - 680.28] they'll jump into a cold bath they'll
[677.72 - 682.32] sit there in icy water and they're going
[680.28 - 683.72] to be hindering and damaging their
[682.32 - 685.68] adrenals and they're going to set
[683.72 - 687.64] themselves up for adrenal fatigue over
[685.68 - 689.84] time so it's number one right there to
[687.64 - 692.60] talk about when you're chronic sick and
[689.84 - 695.32] chronically ill very important to know
[692.60 - 699.36] so back to now cold packs and so
[695.32 - 701.32] forth all right B vova says but how are
[699.36 - 703.56] so many folks healing themselves with
[701.32 - 705.68] the ice baths really they're healing
[703.56 - 707.48] themselves with the ice baths I mean
[705.68 - 709.20] that's not really what I've seen out
[707.48 - 711.56] there so much and I've seen the ice
[709.20 - 713.72] baths out there for many years that's
[711.56 - 716.40] been going on like cold baths and and
[713.72 - 718.24] Ice baths have been going on for decades
[716.40 - 719.84] and people with chronic illness their
[718.24 - 721.32] thyroid disorder order isn't healed so
[719.84 - 723.32] you mean they do an ice bath and their
[721.32 - 725.88] thyroid disorder goes away their
[723.32 - 727.68] hashimotos thy thyroiditis goes away
[725.88 - 729.24] their ra that they're suffering with and
[727.68 - 731.44] they're on drugs for goes away when they
[729.24 - 732.88] hop in an ice bath um their Lyme disease
[731.44 - 735.84] goes away cuz I'm trying to figure this
[732.88 - 737.92] out no disrespect seriously so when
[735.84 - 739.92] someone's got lime disease and they've
[737.92 - 741.44] they're pounding the antibiotics and
[739.92 - 743.16] they're going to their 10th lime doctor
[741.44 - 746.08] you mean an ice bath fixes it they're
[743.16 - 747.68] all done boom you know and so what
[746.08 - 749.72] you're hearing from people like that
[747.68 - 751.88] you're hearing people who aren't sick
[749.72 - 754.36] they haven't been sick sick they're
[751.88 - 755.84] called not so sick very little things
[754.36 - 757.56] going on with them maybe they got a
[755.84 - 759.64] sinus infection they get periodically
[757.56 - 762.16] maybe they don't feel good in other ways
[759.64 - 764.20] but it's the they're The Not So Sick and
[762.16 - 765.44] some of them with with a strong
[764.20 - 767.36] Constitution because they've never
[765.44 - 769.24] gotten sick yet hasn't broken down their
[767.36 - 770.92] constitution they can hop into an ice
[769.24 - 773.40] bath and they can get quick relief for
[770.92 - 774.60] the moment but they get quick relief for
[773.40 - 776.12] the moment cuz they're high on
[774.60 - 778.56] adrenaline and that's what's happening
[776.12 - 780.68] so here's what's going on when you're
[778.56 - 783.40] not that sick of a person or not sick at
[780.68 - 785.96] all and you want to do the ice bath okay
[783.40 - 787.24] you're going to be on an adrenaline High
[785.96 - 789.60] because your body is going to be
[787.24 - 791.08] coursing coursing through adrenaline
[789.60 - 795.00] when a plane
[791.08 - 797.48] crashes in the Alps all right and
[795.00 - 800.80] everybody's on that plane and the snow
[797.48 - 803.32] is just coming down and they're their
[800.80 - 805.16] way up in the mountains and the snow is
[803.32 - 808.96] blowing and the wind is blowing and
[805.16 - 811.64] they're in that plane and that plane is
[808.96 - 813.72] crashed but they're still alive and
[811.64 - 816.24] there's no heaters and they're not
[813.72 - 819.72] dressed warm enough and they can't start
[816.24 - 821.80] a fire and they start getting cold
[819.72 - 824.64] that's fight ORF flight the body goes
[821.80 - 826.60] into that crazy land of coldness right
[824.64 - 828.88] adrenaline starts coursing through them
[826.60 - 831.28] to keep them alive well when you hop
[828.88 - 833.52] into an ice tub a tub filled with ice
[831.28 - 835.68] and you hop right in your body thinks
[833.52 - 837.56] it's the same thing it thinks that
[835.68 - 841.16] something's wrong you've been left out
[837.56 - 844.20] in the cold and you're in trouble and so
[841.16 - 847.12] the body then supersedes and tries to
[844.20 - 849.60] supersede by by launching and releasing
[847.12 - 851.16] a tremendous amount of adrenaline that
[849.60 - 853.36] adrenaline is to try to keep your
[851.16 - 855.64] heartbeat going to try to keep you
[853.36 - 857.92] moving it's the fight or flight
[855.64 - 859.92] adrenaline so when you hop in the icy
[857.92 - 862.72] cold bathtub and you submerge yourself
[859.92 - 865.12] in you're like your adrenals are just
[862.72 - 867.52] like flooding when you come out of there
[865.12 - 869.60] you're high you like oh my God I can't
[867.52 - 872.24] believe woo I can't believe I came out
[869.60 - 874.48] of that oh my God that was an
[872.24 - 876.80] experience oh my God I feel it I feel
[874.48 - 879.40] really good I came out of the ice bath
[876.80 - 881.12] oh my God right that's the adrenaline
[879.40 - 882.56] surge that's what that is and when
[881.12 - 884.92] you're not so sick and you don't have
[882.56 - 886.56] chronic illness and you don't have Lyme
[884.92 - 888.00] disease and every other condition out
[886.56 - 890.16] there and you don't have Epstein bar
[888.00 - 891.80] related conditions and cause conditions
[890.16 - 893.16] you don't have all these other problems
[891.80 - 894.72] and you come out of that ice bath you
[893.16 - 896.32] like I'll do that again you know I'll
[894.72 - 898.04] get working out next week or the other
[896.32 - 899.32] day I'll do another ice bath it's
[898.04 - 902.24] feeling good
[899.32 - 904.40] The Not So Sick will swear by it you
[902.24 - 908.08] stick somebody sick in those ice baths
[904.40 - 910.08] and they're screwed they are screwed
[908.08 - 913.16] it's going to tank them over time it's
[910.08 - 914.80] going to waste what what adrenal like
[913.16 - 917.24] adrenal strength they have left it's
[914.80 - 920.52] going to waste it it's going to throw
[917.24 - 923.12] away whatever adrenaline they have left
[920.52 - 925.72] in reserves adrenal reserves right is
[923.12 - 927.88] going to throw that away and over time
[925.72 - 930.56] you're chronically sick that is going to
[927.88 - 932.56] break you down knock you down and your
[930.56 - 935.04] immune system is going to lower and
[932.56 - 937.20] weaken because of it so your white blood
[935.04 - 938.28] cells are going to start falling apart
[937.20 - 940.48] because of it that's what's going to
[938.28 - 943.88] happen they're going to explode and open
[940.48 - 943.88] up so keep that in
[944.04 - 949.28] mind Christen Burton says are cold packs
[946.80 - 951.28] bad for adrenals no they aren't and I'll
[949.28 - 953.56] talk about ways of using them they're
[951.28 - 957.48] not because they're not putting your
[953.56 - 960.12] body into hypothermic state if you're
[957.48 - 964.12] being careful you're localizing with
[960.12 - 967.28] cold packs you're not doing the ice bath
[964.12 - 969.28] dip and you got to be careful there's a
[967.28 - 971.08] huge difference between someone who is
[969.28 - 973.08] struggling and sick with chronic
[971.08 - 975.32] sickness and illness versus someone
[973.08 - 977.52] who's not so sick or not sick at all you
[975.32 - 979.76] see someone on social saying I'm doing
[977.52 - 982.16] the ice bath again wow it's making me
[979.76 - 984.56] feel good and you're somebody that's
[982.16 - 987.36] sick and you've had fibro chronic
[984.56 - 988.72] fatigue Lyme disease multiple sclerosis
[987.36 - 990.48] you don't know what you got going going
[988.72 - 992.56] on maybe you don't have any diagnosis
[990.48 - 993.96] you're just fatigued really bad you got
[992.56 - 995.84] aches and pains everywhere you don't
[993.96 - 998.04] feel good you got brain fog that's
[995.84 - 1000.52] totally messing you up and making you
[998.04 - 1002.40] take a whole bunch of Aderall like crazy
[1000.52 - 1003.80] because you got so much brain fog you're
[1002.40 - 1006.32] trying to survive you're trying to get
[1003.80 - 1007.96] back by you're on coffee you're on
[1006.32 - 1009.92] chocolate you're trying to just keep
[1007.96 - 1012.80] yourself going and push through the day
[1009.92 - 1016.04] you go into the ice baths and do them
[1012.80 - 1018.52] regularly it's a shock to the body
[1016.04 - 1021.56] systems all of them because your body
[1018.52 - 1024.44] says fight or flight Red Alert fight or
[1021.56 - 1026.76] flight something's wrong something's
[1024.44 - 1029.60] going wrong because your brain is
[1026.76 - 1032.20] starting to get cold your whole body is
[1029.60 - 1033.76] starting to get cold the adrenals are
[1032.20 - 1035.68] just like fight our flight we're in
[1033.76 - 1038.32] trouble oh my God your adrenals are just
[1035.68 - 1041.40] going nuts like that's what they're
[1038.32 - 1043.72] doing because they're saying don't go
[1041.40 - 1046.56] into hypothermia something's wrong are
[1043.72 - 1048.76] you in a plane did you crash in the Alps
[1046.56 - 1050.20] what's going on is there a wind blowing
[1048.76 - 1052.88] and you don't have a fire keeping you
[1050.20 - 1055.20] warm you're not indoors you're not by a
[1052.88 - 1057.88] fireplace you're where are you trapped
[1055.20 - 1060.04] in Z degree weather out somewhere and
[1057.88 - 1063.32] that's what your adrenals are telling
[1060.04 - 1065.80] your brain your adrenals are telling
[1063.32 - 1068.36] your brain your brain is communicating
[1065.80 - 1070.44] with your adrenals saying I don't know
[1068.36 - 1072.28] what this fool is doing your brain is
[1070.44 - 1074.24] saying I don't know what this person's
[1072.28 - 1076.08] doing I don't know what this person
[1074.24 - 1078.08] who's got misinformation wrong
[1076.08 - 1080.40] information is doing but I'm starting to
[1078.08 - 1082.84] get cold in here and I need some
[1080.40 - 1085.72] adrenaline fast and you better send that
[1082.84 - 1087.28] stuff up and pile that stuff in because
[1085.72 - 1090.04] guess what if we stay in this tub a
[1087.28 - 1092.60] little too long that person's in trouble
[1090.04 - 1094.48] you come out and you have a high now
[1092.60 - 1096.60] you're jacked up instead of on chocolate
[1094.48 - 1099.24] and coffee and caffeine and espressos
[1096.60 - 1101.00] and green tea and matcha tea and energy
[1099.24 - 1101.92] drinks instead of that you're jacked up
[1101.00 - 1104.44] on
[1101.92 - 1107.48] adrenaline that's how it
[1104.44 - 1108.88] works big difference between not so sick
[1107.48 - 1111.76] and chronically sick
[1108.88 - 1114.00] big difference don't forget that one
[1111.76 - 1115.40] very important critical I talk about it
[1114.00 - 1117.40] in the books you should have the medical
[1115.40 - 1121.08] medium books learn about the difference
[1117.40 - 1124.44] between the not so sick and the sick
[1121.08 - 1126.24] okay the rules change but what happens
[1124.44 - 1128.56] is that not so sick they don't know what
[1126.24 - 1130.32] it's like to be really sick they have no
[1128.56 - 1133.68] idea so they'll tell you to jump into an
[1130.32 - 1136.20] ice bath that's how it
[1133.68 - 1138.44] works all right let's get into cold
[1136.20 - 1141.88] packs right here woohoo these are are
[1138.44 - 1144.76] getting nice and cold right now okay
[1141.88 - 1147.60] different size cold packs I like this
[1144.76 - 1149.64] size but you may have look at it Frosty
[1147.60 - 1153.88] Frosty cold I like this size you may
[1149.64 - 1156.04] like smaller sizes okay here's how it
[1153.88 - 1160.68] works when you
[1156.04 - 1162.28] localize cold to an area in the body
[1160.68 - 1166.72] healing
[1162.28 - 1170.36] stimulates the healing process kicks in
[1166.72 - 1173.44] inflammation starts to go down if you
[1170.36 - 1176.24] have somebody and you have knee problems
[1173.44 - 1179.36] or a shoulder problem and it's
[1176.24 - 1182.16] inflamed and you do say the ice bath
[1179.36 - 1184.84] where it's whole body cold it's not
[1182.16 - 1186.76] localized anymore so your body is not
[1184.84 - 1189.52] going to look for the
[1186.76 - 1191.24] problem critical piece of information
[1189.52 - 1194.80] right there so let's go to it a little
[1191.24 - 1196.52] bit my shoulders killing me right here
[1194.80 - 1200.92] it's really hurting
[1196.52 - 1203.20] bad I got a badge shoulder you know
[1200.92 - 1206.00] something's really hurting in there been
[1203.20 - 1208.84] to a lot of doctors he's saying maybe I
[1206.00 - 1212.64] got tennis shoulder
[1208.84 - 1215.28] whatever right what do I do right here
[1212.64 - 1217.28] well let me do an ice pack and localize
[1215.28 - 1220.76] it on the shoulder or around the
[1217.28 - 1223.44] shoulder when you do that your immune
[1220.76 - 1227.32] system does something
[1223.44 - 1229.52] interesting it senses the cold in a
[1227.32 - 1232.80] certain area of the body
[1229.52 - 1237.12] it senses it it heads to that
[1232.80 - 1240.76] area interesting it seeks it out it
[1237.12 - 1244.24] seeks out the area you're identifying
[1240.76 - 1246.32] your injury or your spasm or your
[1244.24 - 1249.88] chronic mystery inflammation you're
[1246.32 - 1254.20] identifying it you're helping your body
[1249.88 - 1255.16] even locate it isn't that crazy and
[1254.20 - 1257.84] that's what's
[1255.16 - 1259.32] amazing when you do full body cold from
[1257.84 - 1261.12] head to down to your toe there ain't no
[1259.32 - 1263.32] finding nothing there ain't no
[1261.12 - 1266.44] localizing there's no looking for
[1263.32 - 1268.68] anything it's chaos adrenaline flooding
[1266.44 - 1271.00] your bloodstream trying to stop you from
[1268.68 - 1274.20] going to hypothermic your immune system
[1271.00 - 1276.96] is lowering because it's dying off from
[1274.20 - 1278.84] the adrenaline surge keep that in mind
[1276.96 - 1282.56] adrenaline is
[1278.84 - 1284.88] purging immune cells are dying that's
[1282.56 - 1289.04] how it works adrenaline is surging
[1284.88 - 1292.04] immune cells are dying when you localize
[1289.04 - 1293.48] right cold pack on the shoulder say cuz
[1292.04 - 1297.48] you got a shoulder
[1293.48 - 1301.04] injury immune system is not
[1297.48 - 1303.84] dying you have localized the area your
[1301.04 - 1305.64] body isn't under a threat it's not under
[1303.84 - 1308.40] a fight or flight
[1305.64 - 1311.24] threat this means your brain is not
[1308.40 - 1314.24] sending messages to your adrenals saying
[1311.24 - 1317.24] save me I'm getting too cold too fast
[1314.24 - 1321.04] something is wrong help help help send
[1317.24 - 1323.80] adrenaline out out that's not happening
[1321.04 - 1325.96] as you're getting your therapy your cold
[1323.80 - 1329.60] therapy on your shoulder
[1325.96 - 1331.16] area inflammation will drop
[1329.60 - 1334.36] quickly
[1331.16 - 1338.64] inflammation will reduce your body will
[1334.36 - 1341.04] respond the cold will really help with
[1338.64 - 1343.16] the area that you're localizing it to
[1341.04 - 1345.24] and your immune system will find its way
[1343.16 - 1348.92] to that area
[1345.24 - 1352.64] after you remove the cold pack as
[1348.92 - 1354.60] well keep in mind that when the cold
[1352.64 - 1357.24] pack is off of you after you used it for
[1354.60 - 1358.48] 10 minutes 15 minutes 20 minutes your
[1357.24 - 1363.00] immune
[1358.48 - 1367.44] system goes rapidly to the area that the
[1363.00 - 1370.52] cold pack was on your immune cells run
[1367.44 - 1374.60] to the area the cold pack was
[1370.52 - 1377.00] on That's The Power of healing with cold
[1374.60 - 1379.96] packs and hot packs we'll talk about
[1377.00 - 1379.96] that in a minute as well
[1380.16 - 1384.68] okay let's talk about durations you guys
[1383.56 - 1387.44] by the way if you just got here I'm
[1384.68 - 1389.12] making loaded crinkle cut fries I got
[1387.44 - 1390.40] eggplant bacon right there I got a whole
[1389.12 - 1392.04] bunch of stuff I'm just preparing you
[1390.40 - 1395.08] because we're going to make those right
[1392.04 - 1397.08] after this I got some nice carrots in
[1395.08 - 1398.64] the steamer I'm going to make some nacho
[1397.08 - 1400.56] cheese without all the garbage just
[1398.64 - 1403.44] wanted to give you guys a little just
[1400.56 - 1406.88] rundown of what's
[1403.44 - 1409.48] coming so let's head into this area now
[1406.88 - 1411.60] durations you might be a sensitive
[1409.48 - 1416.64] person one
[1411.60 - 1419.04] size fits all no one size doesn't fit
[1416.64 - 1421.80] all you're somebody that might only need
[1419.04 - 1424.36] 5 minutes on an area somebody that might
[1421.80 - 1428.48] need a smaller ice
[1424.36 - 1430.36] pack somebody can handle because the com
[1428.48 - 1432.52] how comfortable it is or not they can
[1430.36 - 1435.96] handle a really cold ice pack on an
[1432.52 - 1438.48] injury or a problem their elbow is
[1435.96 - 1441.88] swollen they have an elbow problem a and
[1438.48 - 1444.48] payes they may only need a few minutes
[1441.88 - 1448.56] of the ice pack on the
[1444.48 - 1449.36] elbow they may only need 5 minutes on
[1448.56 - 1452.76] the
[1449.36 - 1454.76] knee this is where you become the expert
[1452.76 - 1456.80] to what you're doing for
[1454.76 - 1459.96] yourself here's another thing you have
[1456.80 - 1461.92] to understand whenever using cold packs
[1459.96 - 1466.80] you want to make sure you're
[1461.92 - 1469.80] warm you don't want your teeth to be
[1466.80 - 1469.80] rattling
[1469.92 - 1472.99] [Music]
[1473.44 - 1477.88] you don't want to have that happening
[1475.88 - 1479.52] you want to keep yourself warm when you

[1483.36 - 1488.00] nice cozy warm blanket somehow on you
[1486.52 - 1489.44] while you're doing your cold pack
[1488.00 - 1492.92] something like
[1489.44 - 1496.76] this so right now I'm looking for a
[1492.92 - 1499.76] blanket I happen to have one here it
[1496.76 - 1499.76] is
[1500.44 - 1505.60] and what you do is you have a blanket on
[1502.60 - 1509.60] you right let's try to get this blanket
[1505.60 - 1511.20] on me it's a new dance it's called the
[1509.60 - 1515.20] blanket
[1511.20 - 1517.80] dance kind of like this all right you
[1515.20 - 1519.28] take the coal back and you have it
[1517.80 - 1521.20] somewhere do you have it on your lower
[1519.28 - 1524.56] back de are you dealing with some kind
[1521.20 - 1526.08] of back pain do you have it on your hip

[1526.08 - 1530.28] have it on your side do you have it on
[1527.56 - 1532.76] your rib cage are you putting a cold
[1530.28 - 1534.68] pack gently on the chest for a few
[1532.76 - 1538.32] minutes at a time I want to go into that
[1534.68 - 1540.32] too with nerve inflammation Vegas nerves
[1538.32 - 1542.96] problems when we have swelling nerves
[1540.32 - 1545.56] frenic nerves vegus nerves and so
[1542.96 - 1548.76] forth but you want to keep
[1545.56 - 1552.00] warm when you're doing your cold packs
[1548.76 - 1553.48] maybe you hurt yourself on a very hot
[1552.00 - 1556.04] day and you really don't need it
[1553.48 - 1558.00] possibly it's really warm outside and
[1556.04 - 1560.84] you're not worried and you got ni nice
[1558.00 - 1564.16] pack on your rib you got a nice pack on
[1560.84 - 1566.28] your elbow your wrist and so forth but
[1564.16 - 1569.20] if you're somebody that's using them to
[1566.28 - 1572.72] just calm nerves down you want to keep
[1569.20 - 1575.04] warm you want to make sure you have a
[1572.72 - 1578.24] blanket and if you have to use cold
[1575.04 - 1581.32] packs for even a bigger length of time
[1578.24 - 1583.64] you may even want a heating pad involved
[1581.32 - 1586.60] so right here I got a heating
[1583.64 - 1588.24] pad okay here's
[1586.60 - 1590.08] one
[1588.24 - 1592.88] so I'm going to go into some different
[1590.08 - 1595.64] tips and some different things and ways
[1592.88 - 1597.56] to use heating pads that are important
[1595.64 - 1600.88] so if you're doing cold packs on you you
[1597.56 - 1603.16] can always lay a heating pad over
[1600.88 - 1605.96] you you don't have to be laying on the
[1603.16 - 1609.52] heating pad you can even have your
[1605.96 - 1613.56] heating pad over the blanket that's over
[1609.52 - 1616.56] you just keeping warm down into you as
[1613.56 - 1619.76] you're using ice packs what this does is
[1616.56 - 1623.12] it ensures that your body is
[1619.76 - 1626.56] warm while the area that you're trying
[1623.12 - 1630.16] to ice is cool and
[1626.56 - 1631.96] cold okay and why is that important once
[1630.16 - 1634.64] again you're
[1631.96 - 1637.56] localizing if you're warm everywhere
[1634.64 - 1640.76] else in your body and the cold is in an
[1637.56 - 1642.40] area you're trying to really Precision
[1640.76 - 1646.48] wise
[1642.40 - 1648.68] get like on a Precision level then more
[1646.48 - 1650.72] healing occurs
[1648.68 - 1654.56] it's different if you're
[1650.72 - 1658.24] freezing totally freezing you got the
[1654.56 - 1661.32] shakes your jaws like quivering you're
[1658.24 - 1663.68] cold and you have the ice pack on you
[1661.32 - 1665.00] that doesn't help as much cuz now your
[1663.68 - 1667.60] body is just
[1665.00 - 1669.64] cold and now your body is going into a
[1667.60 - 1671.32] different situation you want to keep
[1669.64 - 1673.00] your body warm you want to be
[1671.32 - 1674.84] comfortable and then you want to take
[1673.00 - 1678.52] the cold pack and use it in the
[1674.84 - 1680.04] locations you need to use it in
[1678.52 - 1681.92] got a comment right here does it work
[1680.04 - 1683.84] for nerve pain let's head into there
[1681.92 - 1686.68] yeah it does work for nerve pain for a
[1683.84 - 1689.32] lot of people it can put the heating pad
[1686.68 - 1689.32] over here for a
[1689.48 - 1693.68] second well I do want before I answer
[1691.96 - 1694.76] that I do want to actually talk about
[1693.68 - 1699.12] one
[1694.76 - 1701.16] thing I never put heating pads High I
[1699.12 - 1704.44] never click the button and put them
[1701.16 - 1707.96] really really high something to know
[1704.44 - 1711.16] it's an important tip keep in mind
[1707.96 - 1712.72] I never fall asleep on heating pads you
[1711.16 - 1715.52] never want to fall asleep on a heating
[1712.72 - 1719.52] pad that's jacked up really
[1715.52 - 1721.88] high I like heating pads being down
[1719.52 - 1723.72] low I've talked to a lot of people over
[1721.88 - 1726.00] the years a lot of doctors and
[1723.72 - 1728.72] practitioners giving advice to doctors
[1726.00 - 1731.36] and practitioners and healers when it
[1728.72 - 1733.08] comes down to heating pads and one of
[1731.36 - 1735.64] the pieces of advice one of the
[1733.08 - 1738.16] important factors is you don't ever need
[1735.64 - 1741.52] to have it so high you don't want to
[1738.16 - 1743.80] cook or bake yourself you don't want it
[1741.52 - 1746.48] cranking in an area too
[1743.80 - 1750.24] long you don't want to do that you want
[1746.48 - 1751.92] to keep it low you can drape it over you
[1750.24 - 1755.48] you can drape it over you under a
[1751.92 - 1758.32] blanket on low you can drape it on top
[1755.48 - 1760.48] of the blanket un low the goal is to
[1758.32 - 1763.36] send some warmth
[1760.48 - 1766.48] in while you're actually using any kind
[1763.36 - 1768.16] of cold or ice pack unless you're in a
[1766.48 - 1771.56] situation where you feel comfortable you
[1768.16 - 1772.92] feel warm and you don't need to right
[1771.56 - 1775.00] now if you want to go a little higher on
[1772.92 - 1777.08] your heating pad you can't many people
[1775.00 - 1779.24] do that and that's what they like they
[1777.08 - 1781.16] put it up a little bit higher and they
[1779.24 - 1783.52] get a little bit of warmth and heat into
[1781.16 - 1787.40] the area like a strained muscle or some
[1783.52 - 1790.12] body aches and pains and the heat feels
[1787.40 - 1792.44] good so people may do that but I'm just
[1790.12 - 1793.76] giving some tips on heating pads now if
[1792.44 - 1795.16] you're somebody that just won't go near
[1793.76 - 1798.20] a heating pad you don't like heating
[1795.16 - 1800.68] pads you don't like the electricity
[1798.20 - 1804.28] factor I find that the electricity
[1800.68 - 1808.12] Factor does not affect people it does
[1804.28 - 1810.28] more good than bad for people when they
[1808.12 - 1812.48] need that warmth it actually does more
[1810.28 - 1814.40] good when you're chronically sick than
[1812.48 - 1816.08] bad because I know people like heating
[1814.40 - 1817.56] pads what's he talk what is he talking
[1816.08 - 1819.76] about now you can use different hot
[1817.56 - 1821.36] packs that you might like I'm not saying
[1819.76 - 1823.44] you can't look for the hot packs you
[1821.36 - 1825.80] want or anything of the sort so let's go
[1823.44 - 1828.72] into the next thing right
[1825.80 - 1832.48] here what's this
[1828.72 - 1834.84] hot water bottle right here so somebody
[1832.48 - 1838.36] who doesn't like heating pads can find
[1834.84 - 1840.32] warmth with the hot water bottle so
[1838.36 - 1841.76] that's an option all on its own now I'm
[1840.32 - 1843.44] going to fill this hot water bottle
[1841.76 - 1845.20] right here with my sink I want to give
[1843.44 - 1847.56] you some different tips on
[1845.20 - 1852.40] that one
[1847.56 - 1856.00] is I don't like filling a tea kettle
[1852.40 - 1858.08] with boiling scolding hot water and then
[1856.00 - 1862.68] filling my hot water water bottle with
[1858.08 - 1862.68] that this is something I don't like to
[1863.60 - 1871.44] do okay got your tea kettle filled it's
[1867.96 - 1873.56] scolding scolding hot water and you're
[1871.44 - 1874.84] pouring it into your hot water bottle
[1873.56 - 1876.08] reason why I don't like that is there's
[1874.84 - 1877.48] a good chance you're going to burn
[1876.08 - 1880.56] yourself and you're going to get thir
[1877.48 - 1884.20] Dee burns on your hands your thumb your
[1880.56 - 1886.84] fingers and even your arm okay so if
[1884.20 - 1889.60] you're going to heat up your water to
[1886.84 - 1892.52] put in inside the water bottle don't let
[1889.60 - 1894.84] it get to that crazy hot temperature
[1892.52 - 1897.96] where it's boiling and bubbling over and
[1894.84 - 1900.60] it's at that crazy scolding level don't
[1897.96 - 1903.24] let it get to that you can do it where
[1900.60 - 1905.84] it's just you know it's hot like hot
[1903.24 - 1908.92] where if you did it did hit you it's not
[1905.84 - 1910.84] going to be a tragic burn it might be
[1908.92 - 1913.56] you know hot too hot to touch but you
[1910.84 - 1915.76] know what I mean that is what I would
[1913.56 - 1919.48] recommend now what I like to do is take
[1915.76 - 1921.04] sink water and put sink water that's hot
[1919.48 - 1922.76] into my hot water bottle so I'm going to
[1921.04 - 1925.60] do that now some of you guys might not
[1922.76 - 1927.40] be able to see me over there on IG and
[1925.60 - 1930.00] Tick Tock so I kind of put my hand over
[1927.40 - 1933.80] here see okay so what I'm doing is I'm
[1930.00 - 1937.80] running my tap over here so you guys on

[1953.28 - 1960.04] like this I am filling it right off the
[1956.24 - 1960.04] to just want everybody to
[1960.28 - 1966.48] know and it's coming out really hot but
[1964.56 - 1968.72] it's not coming out so hot where this is
[1966.48 - 1971.28] going to really burn me or any levels
[1968.72 - 1973.04] okay there we go it's filled up could
[1971.28 - 1974.72] probably use a little bit more but I
[1973.04 - 1978.96] just want to get back to you guys I'm
[1974.72 - 1984.00] going to screw on the top
[1978.96 - 1986.72] okay feels good nice warm hot water

[1997.52 - 2002.56] take it

[2002.56 - 2007.60] water as you want in here as it will
[2004.96 - 2011.16] hold you can also put just just half the
[2007.60 - 2014.44] amount of water or a third of the
[2011.16 - 2016.24] amount and then you can actually rest on
[2014.44 - 2018.40] this on the couch you can put this
[2016.24 - 2021.16] behind you on the couch you can get heat
[2018.40 - 2024.12] to your lower back the hot water bottle
[2021.16 - 2027.72] so you can do heat and cold
[2024.12 - 2029.72] therapy by localizing areas so you got a

[2051.64 - 2055.96] your back back
[2053.08 - 2058.72] problem you can take the cold pack and
[2055.96 - 2061.32] you can put this behind you like this
[2058.72 - 2063.76] and you can lean back right on the
[2061.32 - 2066.12] couch and then you can take the hot
[2063.76 - 2067.72] water bottle over you like this and stay
[2066.12 - 2069.00] nice and warm
[2067.72 - 2072.68] especially if you're going to do a half
[2069.00 - 2074.56] an hour or more with a cold pack link is
[2072.68 - 2077.40] in the bio on some of the stuff you guys
[2074.56 - 2078.60] take a look medical medium.com the link
[2077.40 - 2081.68] is in the
[2078.60 - 2084.40] bio and in the description if you're
[2081.68 - 2086.88] interested on any of this maybe you
[2084.40 - 2090.40] already have this stuff go to Personal
[2086.88 - 2093.00] Care directory and medical me.com you
[2090.40 - 2095.32] can do that
[2093.00 - 2097.76] it all
[2095.32 - 2099.72] right let's go into nerve pain
[2097.76 - 2101.64] neurological symptoms and so forth a lot
[2099.72 - 2105.80] of people have chest
[2101.64 - 2108.52] pain a lot of people have abdomen
[2105.80 - 2111.56] pain people don't know why maybe they do
[2108.52 - 2114.40] know why but either way any kind of
[2111.56 - 2118.84] nerve related pain throughout the body a
[2114.40 - 2121.52] little bit of cold on it can do wonders
[2118.84 - 2122.96] calms things down now you might be
[2121.52 - 2124.28] really sensitive and you're sensitive
[2122.96 - 2127.04] with your nerves you got a lot of
[2124.28 - 2128.40] neurological symptoms and put in hold
[2127.04 - 2132.16] this too
[2128.40 - 2135.64] much that's why you can do
[2132.16 - 2138.40] this okay just see is a
[2135.64 - 2140.96] towel I'm going to open this hollow
[2138.40 - 2142.24] up going to do a magic trick for you
[2140.96 - 2145.24] right
[2142.24 - 2147.00] now no I'm
[2145.24 - 2150.56] not
[2147.00 - 2154.28] and I have a cold pack right here in
[2150.56 - 2157.88] this towel now what I recommend is not
[2154.28 - 2160.36] going from cold pack out of the freezer
[2157.88 - 2160.36] to
[2160.60 - 2167.16] skin I do not recommend going from cold
[2164.60 - 2170.44] pack to
[2167.16 - 2174.52] skin no no no no no
[2170.44 - 2177.20] no not a good idea way too cold it's
[2174.52 - 2179.64] going to hit the skin really
[2177.20 - 2183.20] cold you might feel even like a little
[2179.64 - 2184.96] freezer burn touch not good so when you
[2183.20 - 2188.32] pull your cold packs out of the
[2184.96 - 2190.68] freezer I like to put put them in a
[2188.32 - 2192.48] towel now you can do a thinner towel you
[2190.68 - 2195.32] can do a thicker
[2192.48 - 2197.84] towel maybe you're somebody that does
[2195.32 - 2199.80] the thinner one but I like one that's
[2197.84 - 2202.48] got a little meat to it it's a little
[2199.80 - 2205.56] thick you can even go thicker than this
[2202.48 - 2207.96] and then if you got the Vegas nerve
[2205.56 - 2209.44] issues the frenic nerve issues if you
[2207.96 - 2210.92] got all the different nerve pain
[2209.44 - 2213.04] throughout your body your neck your
[2210.92 - 2216.16] trigeminal nerve that's another thing
[2213.04 - 2219.32] right here okay a lot of people have
[2216.16 - 2223.00] that jaw pain they have that pain on the
[2219.32 - 2223.00] side of their face their teeth
[2223.44 - 2228.24] hurt what maybe it's a maybe it's a
[2226.00 - 2229.84] Dentistry issue maybe it's actually a
[2228.24 - 2232.40] problem with the tooth maybe it's an
[2229.84 - 2236.00] abscess can put a cold pack on an
[2232.40 - 2238.20] abscess not inside your mouth but you
[2236.00 - 2240.44] can take the cold pack and you can put
[2238.20 - 2244.64] it on the side of your
[2240.44 - 2246.12] jaw that's a great place for relief for
[2244.64 - 2247.56] so many people that have trigeminal
[2246.12 - 2249.08] neuralgia
[2247.56 - 2252.28] they have different pain in their neck
[2249.08 - 2253.96] and face Facial Pain facial nerves
[2252.28 - 2255.60] actually calm down when you put a little
[2253.96 - 2256.84] cold to them now here's the thing you
[2255.60 - 2258.28] want to be careful if you're somebody
[2256.84 - 2260.32] who's chronically sick and you got a lot
[2258.28 - 2264.96] of different pain throughout the body
[2260.32 - 2268.44] I'm talking about just lightly touching
[2264.96 - 2271.32] and not for a long time nice towel on it
[2268.44 - 2272.92] and it's just getting some cold in here
[2271.32 - 2275.04] you don't have to be on there for more
[2272.92 - 2277.40] than sometimes 30
[2275.04 - 2279.40] seconds 30 seconds
[2277.40 - 2281.76] seconds so you're dealing with some kind
[2279.40 - 2283.84] of trigeminal neuralgia jaw pain nerve
[2281.76 - 2285.40] pain maybe you're somebody that just
[2283.84 - 2289.48] grinds your
[2285.40 - 2291.12] teethed real like stiff jaw maybe you're
[2289.48 - 2293.04] somebody that has different pain in
[2291.12 - 2295.60] different areas of the neck I'm just
[2293.04 - 2298.24] talking about a little bit even if it's
[2295.60 - 2301.48] 30 seconds so when you're chronically
[2298.24 - 2304.84] sick and you do 30 seconds of this it
[2301.48 - 2306.72] can actually assist in healing and help
[2304.84 - 2309.16] to drive down some of that mystery
[2306.72 - 2310.96] chronic
[2309.16 - 2314.00] inflammation same thing with headaches
[2310.96 - 2316.04] and migraines just touching the forehead
[2314.00 - 2317.36] with a cold pack with the towel on it
[2316.04 - 2319.12] you don't want to sit there with a
[2317.36 - 2320.60] freezer pack right out of the freezer
[2319.12 - 2321.88] and you just shove it on your head and
[2320.60 - 2324.96] you're like okay I'm going to leave this
[2321.88 - 2326.88] on here don't don't do that but you can
[2324.96 - 2328.28] just do little bits at a time in areas
[2326.88 - 2330.12] that are hypers sensitive like the
[2328.28 - 2332.60] cranial nerve areas so I want to get my
[2330.12 - 2337.56] little thing
[2332.60 - 2340.24] here okay so cranial nerves
[2337.56 - 2342.76] do a little demo so many people have
[2340.24 - 2345.12] cranial nerve issues all the different
[2342.76 - 2348.28] nerves coming out of their brain stem
[2345.12 - 2351.28] are inflamed so they're having facial
[2348.28 - 2354.40] problems they're having teeth problems
[2351.28 - 2357.56] and jaw problems and a little bit of
[2354.40 - 2361.00] coldness to it can be wonderful just in
[2357.56 - 2362.56] those areas the back of the head cranial
[2361.00 - 2366.00] nerves in the back of the head cranial
[2362.56 - 2369.00] nerves on the face with a towel over it
[2366.00 - 2372.00] I'm just you Gentle quick ways you can
[2369.00 - 2374.72] do this someone said there gerbon said
[2372.00 - 2377.76] for me the ice baths made me sicker and
[2374.72 - 2380.56] sicker glad mm told me the truth about
[2377.76 - 2382.72] this so I finally started healing I've
[2380.56 - 2384.24] seen this before in the past when
[2382.72 - 2386.20] someone's sick and they're chronically
[2384.24 - 2390.04] sick chronically
[2386.20 - 2394.64] ill the ice baths aren't the answer and
[2390.04 - 2398.80] either is a sweat tent that's not the
[2394.64 - 2401.52] answer either either is hot yoga that's
[2398.80 - 2404.32] not the answer extreme
[2401.52 - 2407.04] temperatures that engulf the
[2404.32 - 2409.96] body is something you want to stay away
[2407.04 - 2412.28] from when you're chronically sick
[2409.96 - 2414.60] chronically ill or you're just out of
[2412.28 - 2416.20] the category of just being little bit
[2414.60 - 2419.40] sick or something like
[2416.20 - 2422.92] that the hot and cold
[2419.40 - 2425.76] packs assist healing while you work on
[2422.92 - 2427.40] the medical medium tools and you work on
[2425.76 - 2430.04] the medical medium information so you
[2427.40 - 2431.44] know what's wrong you know how to heal
[2430.04 - 2435.28] and you have all those other tools but
[2431.44 - 2437.56] this is a great way it's like a gateway
[2435.28 - 2441.04] to healing for so many people right
[2437.56 - 2443.44] there on IG how does this compare to
[2441.04 - 2444.56] infrared sauna I like infrared SAA but
[2443.44 - 2445.60] if you're chronically sick you don't
[2444.56 - 2448.80] want to sit in there with the
[2445.60 - 2452.32] temperature jacked up really
[2448.80 - 2453.76] high you don't want to do that I give
[2452.32 - 2455.00] direction about things like this in the
[2453.76 - 2457.44] medical medium
[2455.00 - 2458.44] books Medical medium new addition check
[2457.44 - 2462.44] it
[2458.44 - 2465.08] out you don't want to be in
[2462.44 - 2468.68] there and just doing that way now I like
[2465.08 - 2471.00] infrared saas but remember it doesn't
[2468.68 - 2472.44] isolate so it's not like you want to use
[2471.00 - 2474.28] it where you sit in there you bake
[2472.44 - 2475.84] yourself all the time you got it really
[2474.28 - 2478.24] high when someone's chronically sick
[2475.84 - 2478.24] that's too
[2478.76 - 2482.32] much and the same thing with a cold
[2480.92 - 2484.56] shower I want to talk about like a cold
[2482.32 - 2485.88] shower some people would say well take a
[2484.56 - 2487.56] really cold shower that's going to help
[2485.88 - 2489.56] me you can take a cold shower but
[2487.56 - 2493.16] remember it's not isolating or it's not
[2489.56 - 2496.04] localizing the area it's full body when
[2493.16 - 2497.92] you do infrared sauna it's full body I
[2496.04 - 2499.72] don't mind cool showers for some people
[2497.92 - 2502.48] that's different than an ice ice bath if
[2499.72 - 2504.36] someone wants to turn it cold and just
[2502.48 - 2507.48] get a rush of cold water right out of
[2504.36 - 2509.24] the tab and then shake it off I'm not
[2507.48 - 2511.72] against that at all that's hydrotherapy
[2509.24 - 2513.52] I'm not against
[2511.72 - 2515.48] hydrotherapy someone wants to get into
[2513.52 - 2518.24] an infrared sauna and they want to warm
[2515.48 - 2519.52] up and they have that temp on just right
[2518.24 - 2522.08] for their needs and they're not in it
[2519.52 - 2523.52] for 45 minutes an hour or 2 hours you
[2522.08 - 2524.76] can get in there for 5 minutes 10
[2523.52 - 2526.96] minutes because if you're chronically
[2524.76 - 2529.24] sick that may be all you need to do you
[2526.96 - 2531.08] don't want to push yourself you want to
[2529.24 - 2532.36] keep it very low for 20 minutes no more
[2531.08 - 2536.04] than 20
[2532.36 - 2538.28] minutes but you want to also brace
[2536.04 - 2540.60] yourself be cautious and mindful that
[2538.28 - 2543.32] you're not baking yourself like a
[2540.60 - 2545.28] cupcake in the oven for like an hour
[2543.32 - 2546.84] with a really high heat when you're
[2545.28 - 2549.64] chronically sick and so forth and
[2546.84 - 2549.64] honestly for just
[2549.96 - 2554.52] anyone so cranial nerves get inflamed
[2552.40 - 2556.44] and it gives everybody with cranial
[2554.52 - 2558.40] nerve inflammation issues lots of
[2556.44 - 2560.24] different symptoms ticks and spasms
[2558.40 - 2562.76] aches and pains all kinds of different
[2560.24 - 2565.00] problems why are the nerves inflamed
[2562.76 - 2567.00] viruses toxic heavy metals it's medical
[2565.00 - 2570.20] medum inflamation talked about that for
[2567.00 - 2572.08] years and years so all the different
[2570.20 - 2574.84] viruses and bugs along with toxic heavy
[2572.08 - 2576.16] metals inflame the brain stem people get
[2574.84 - 2577.76] all the different problems every
[2576.16 - 2579.36] everywhere they get the Vegas nerve
[2577.76 - 2580.92] problems going through their body they
[2579.36 - 2582.64] have all this different like they feel
[2580.92 - 2585.32] like they're vibrating they feel like
[2582.64 - 2586.84] their frequency is off they feel tired
[2585.32 - 2588.72] when they're not supposed to be tired
[2586.84 - 2590.56] that's the neurological fatigue and they
[2588.72 - 2592.60] have all the ticks and spasms and
[2590.56 - 2594.56] twitches and then with that they might
[2592.60 - 2596.32] even get some OCD and some other things
[2594.56 - 2598.32] involved which are all neurological they
[2596.32 - 2600.28] might get some blurry vision for no
[2598.32 - 2603.00] reason whatsoever which is the optic
[2600.28 - 2604.20] neuritis or optic nerve inflammation and
[2603.00 - 2606.40] all of this
[2604.20 - 2608.28] combined I talk about in all the books
[2606.40 - 2610.48] so people have answers I'm just bringing
[2608.28 - 2612.60] in though something that's really
[2610.48 - 2615.72] powerful which is hot cold packs
[2612.60 - 2618.12] different tips about
[2615.72 - 2621.00] it and there we are all right you guys
[2618.12 - 2621.00] I'm going to start making some
[2623.04 - 2626.40] fries all right so first of all I'm
[2625.12 - 2627.60] going to make some crinkle fries and I'm
[2626.40 - 2630.44] going get rid of this hot water bottle
[2627.60 - 2633.00] right here feels so good feels like a
[2630.44 - 2635.08] nice warm cuddly just feels
[2633.00 - 2637.28] good you
[2635.08 - 2638.32] know
[2637.28 - 2640.88] all
[2638.32 - 2642.56] right so what you want to do is I have
[2640.88 - 2645.84] steamed potatoes here now you can make
[2642.56 - 2647.36] crinkle fries with potatoes that are raw
[2645.84 - 2651.16] put them in the oven you can do it that
[2647.36 - 2654.52] way I have them steamed right here so
[2651.16 - 2656.76] I'm making my crinkle fries steamed so
[2654.52 - 2659.24] I'm going to make a whole bunch of them
[2656.76 - 2662.24] so let's see got a little window into
[2659.24 - 2664.76] what we're doing here so let's start
[2662.24 - 2668.00] here now these might crumble a little
[2664.76 - 2668.00] bit these potatoes
[2668.12 - 2672.16] you can make them as thick as you want
[2669.64 - 2674.60] you can make them as thin as you want
[2672.16 - 2676.88] it's up to
[2674.60 - 2679.76] you some potatoes
[2676.88 - 2682.04] might work a little better this one was
[2679.76 - 2685.20] really flaky and dry but we might get
[2682.04 - 2687.88] some nice fries out of that one there
[2685.20 - 2689.32] there we go you guys see that I'm going
[2687.88 - 2691.32] to move these over I'm going to make a
[2689.32 - 2695.20] whole
[2691.32 - 2696.96] bunch of fries here those are some nice
[2695.20 - 2699.20] fries here's a another thing to know
[2696.96 - 2701.92] which is really fun if your
[2699.20 - 2703.56] fries come from a large potato you get
[2701.92 - 2706.80] these large crinkle fries which are so
[2703.56 - 2710.36] great if it comes from a small potato
[2706.80 - 2712.56] like this you get small crinkle fries
[2710.36 - 2714.84] how do you like that then I'm going to
[2712.56 - 2716.56] do this maybe try to get one more out of
[2714.84 - 2719.60] this we'll
[2716.56 - 2722.04] see yep some of them are going to break
[2719.60 - 2724.60] apart some of them will be just fine but
[2722.04 - 2726.40] that's all right let's just do it here
[2724.60 - 2728.40] we go
[2726.40 - 2730.76] now I want them a little thick I want
[2728.40 - 2730.76] some
[2732.44 - 2735.72] thickness here we
[2735.76 - 2742.08] are if you make them too small too
[2738.68 - 2744.68] skinny there we go you might run into
[2742.08 - 2748.76] problems now remember these are steamed
[2744.68 - 2748.76] already these aren't the raw
[2749.00 - 2754.00] potato I chose to steam them to make it
[2751.32 - 2757.88] nice just so we can actually bake them
[2754.00 - 2757.88] and make them nice and crunchy
[2758.12 - 2762.44] I also chose to steam them so they don't
[2760.16 - 2765.08] have as much cooking time in the oven
[2762.44 - 2767.60] that's a big deal and I also like the
[2765.08 - 2770.20] inside of the potato
[2767.60 - 2773.28] soft I like the inside of the potato
[2770.20 - 2776.20] soft so here we go let's get some good
[2773.28 - 2779.68] ones here this a very large
[2776.20 - 2781.56] potato and the inside has like a little
[2779.68 - 2784.16] bit of space in there so these might
[2781.56 - 2787.80] fall apart a little
[2784.16 - 2787.80] bit there we go
[2788.16 - 2790.52] there we
[2790.68 - 2795.24] go they're coming out good I might have
[2793.04 - 2798.96] more than my pan can hold but we are
[2795.24 - 2798.96] doing it let's go there's another
[2801.96 - 2808.16] one there a lot of information when it
[2804.56 - 2808.16] comes down to hot and cold
[2810.16 - 2815.44] packs information people don't realize
[2812.64 - 2817.16] you can really get cold with a cold pack
[2815.44 - 2820.84] where your whole body just gets really
[2817.16 - 2820.84] cold and you want to keep yourself
[2822.68 - 2827.88] warm another thing too if you're
[2824.72 - 2830.32] somebody that has back problems hip
[2827.88 - 2833.48] problems and you know you pushed it too
[2830.32 - 2835.12] far you had a big day like say you
[2833.48 - 2837.36] exercised and worked out a little bit
[2835.12 - 2839.80] more than normal say you took a walk
[2837.36 - 2841.56] that's longer than normal say something
[2839.80 - 2843.28] else happened where you were you know
[2841.56 - 2845.16] doing something and loading some garbage
[2843.28 - 2847.28] out of the house say you were lifting
[2845.16 - 2849.52] things bending down more than normal and
[2847.28 - 2850.92] you're in your recovery and you know
[2849.52 - 2852.60] you're not quite there yet but you're
[2850.92 - 2855.76] getting better you might want to get
[2852.60 - 2858.44] that cold pack on
[2855.76 - 2860.88] there and you can C you can totally
[2858.44 - 2864.28] Stave off an
[2860.88 - 2867.04] issue you can actually save off an issue
[2864.28 - 2870.76] from becoming something give yourself a
[2867.04 - 2873.28] break the next day get that cold pack on
[2870.76 - 2875.36] and you can save off an actual problem
[2873.28 - 2878.32] that would have developed that's what I
[2875.36 - 2878.32] like about about cold
[2882.08 - 2886.60] packs okay this one's a little crumbly
[2884.68 - 2889.04] and a little weird might not use much
[2886.60 - 2891.36] out of that one and you could still eat
[2889.04 - 2895.88] it it's all great all right let's get a
[2891.36 - 2895.88] pan going let's see what we can
[2898.08 - 2904.64] do all right I got a parchment paper
[2902.08 - 2905.80] sheet laying it in the pan right here
[2904.64 - 2907.16] now I'm going to start taking my my
[2905.80 - 2909.68] crinkle fries and I'm going to be
[2907.16 - 2911.24] dropping them in let's go let's pack
[2909.68 - 2913.32] them in there really
[2911.24 - 2915.20] good some are a little bigger than
[2913.32 - 2917.40] others I just like that you don't want
[2915.20 - 2919.44] them all exactly the same size it's no
[2917.40 - 2921.64] fun when you start going when you start
[2919.44 - 2924.28] you know how you like choose the fry you
[2921.64 - 2926.76] want you're kind of going through your
[2924.28 - 2928.84] dish you're looking for the French fry
[2926.76 - 2931.36] it's like when someone goes to the fast
[2928.84 - 2933.68] food restaurant and they get a box of
[2931.36 - 2936.80] fries they start eating certain ones
[2933.68 - 2938.60] they'll grab the little ones right
[2936.80 - 2939.68] or they'll go for just the big ones and
[2938.60 - 2942.76] they'll wait for all those little ones
[2939.68 - 2942.76] to sit on the bottom of the
[2943.24 - 2947.76] package some of these are just going to
[2945.16 - 2951.52] be kind of crunchy pieces which I really
[2947.76 - 2954.64] like here we go coming
[2951.52 - 2958.16] together come
[2954.64 - 2958.16] together right
[2960.28 - 2963.33] [Music]
[2964.52 - 2969.32] now

[3075.04 - 3078.36] the cold packs for my
[3078.84 - 3083.12] mother-in-law incredible all right you
[3081.16 - 3084.56] guys see I want this kind of like evenly
[3083.12 - 3087.20] done but I'm going to stick a few more
[3084.56 - 3091.72] of these in some strange places like in
[3087.20 - 3094.08] the corners here you know just kind of
[3091.72 - 3095.92] off the beaten path if that's okay I
[3094.08 - 3100.68] just want to get as many of these babies
[3095.92 - 3100.68] in here as I can toast them
[3105.40 - 3108.68] up all
[3109.44 - 3113.12] right maybe a couple
[3113.44 - 3118.40] more all right let's season these these
[3115.96 - 3120.48] I'm going to push these to the side I'm
[3118.40 - 3123.48] still going to cook these later you
[3120.48 - 3125.96] better believe it those are
[3123.48 - 3128.68] definitely going be cooked
[3125.96 - 3131.32] later all
[3128.68 - 3132.72] right so what do we have let's get some
[3131.32 - 3133.88] seasoning on here let's go a little
[3132.72 - 3137.28] onion
[3133.88 - 3140.52] powder let's go going to pop some onion
[3137.28 - 3142.84] powder in here oh this is going to be so
[3140.52 - 3145.04] good you can be
[3142.84 - 3147.28] generous if you like onion powder be
[3145.04 - 3147.28] generous
[3149.24 - 3155.44] there you go you don't like it don't use
[3151.60 - 3158.60] it that's fine but it really brings that
[3155.44 - 3160.92] flavor up into these fries really good
[3158.60 - 3163.28] onion powder go up
[3160.92 - 3166.20] AA no actually no we're going to go with
[3163.28 - 3168.52] some oregano let's find that oregano
[3166.20 - 3171.08] let's do garlic powder I have to find
[3168.52 - 3175.24] the oregano
[3171.08 - 3176.72] powder my bad I think I forgot that one
[3175.24 - 3178.68] let's get some garlic powder on here you
[3176.72 - 3181.56] don't have to do so much garlic powder
[3178.68 - 3184.76] you don't want that exactly like so
[3181.56 - 3185.64] crazy all right now I'm going to season
[3184.76 - 3188.32] both
[3185.64 - 3191.52] sides I'll probably do that by just
[3188.32 - 3191.52] moving these around a little
[3191.72 - 3195.72] bit I could take it out of the oven flip
[3194.20 - 3197.48] them around then too but I'm going to
[3195.72 - 3199.40] move some of these
[3197.48 - 3204.12] around here we
[3199.40 - 3204.12] go going to flip them over
[3204.16 - 3208.28] nice
[3206.04 - 3212.96] let's get both sides of many of these as
[3208.28 - 3212.96] many as we can there we go
[3215.60 - 3219.92] nice when you steam the potatoes and you
[3218.16 - 3221.28] throw them in a bowl see I have to
[3219.92 - 3223.20] season them on the plate right here
[3221.28 - 3224.40] because they're steamed potatoes cuz
[3223.20 - 3226.20] what happens is if you just throw them
[3224.40 - 3228.16] in a big old bowl and you toss it around
[3226.20 - 3230.20] with all the with all the seasonings
[3228.16 - 3233.52] you're just going to bust them
[3230.20 - 3236.24] up but when you cook them raw you just
[3233.52 - 3237.64] don't end up into that kind of situation
[3236.24 - 3238.52] so that's why I'm just playing with it
[3237.64 - 3243.04] right here I'm going to do some more
[3238.52 - 3243.04] onion powder on the other side
[3243.52 - 3248.48] nice I think I'm going to sneeze I'm
[3246.32 - 3248.48] going to
[3249.48 - 3255.68] sneeze hold on I'm trying to hold in the
[3252.68 - 3255.68] sneeze
[3257.80 - 3264.44] on just kidding I'm kidding kidding let
[3260.48 - 3267.08] me just get some oregano um it's nice we
[3264.44 - 3267.08] have oregano
[3274.20 - 3277.92] all
[3275.64 - 3280.16] right little bit of oregano in here too
[3277.92 - 3280.16] you
[3281.00 - 3286.48] guys now I have fresh oregano in the
[3283.36 - 3288.88] garden you can go as far as
[3286.48 - 3292.04] that little bit of oregano on there it's
[3288.88 - 3297.08] hard to come out all
[3292.04 - 3297.08] right putting them in the oven
[3297.44 - 3300.24] going to pop them in here I got the oven
[3299.28 - 3302.36] at
[3300.24 - 3304.60] 400 let's get them
[3302.36 - 3307.56] in
[3304.60 - 3309.96] boom looking pretty
[3307.56 - 3311.76] good crinkle fries are in the oven so
[3309.96 - 3313.72] let's start making some of the fixings
[3311.76 - 3316.20] let's go I'm going to chop up some
[3313.72 - 3317.04] Tomatoes that's going to go into this
[3316.20 - 3321.72] all
[3317.04 - 3321.72] right clear out the deck let's go
[3322.00 - 3326.84] here now now when it comes down heat
[3325.40 - 3329.56] packs and stuff like that I want to go
[3326.84 - 3331.36] into that a little bit um and talk about
[3329.56 - 3333.56] the timing and and the order and
[3331.36 - 3335.48] everything about hot packs cold packs
[3333.56 - 3337.20] how to use them so we're going to go
[3335.48 - 3339.28] head into there as well so let's do that
[3337.20 - 3341.04] before we start chopping some stuff up
[3339.28 - 3344.16] okay so let's get the hot and cold packs
[3341.04 - 3346.12] out again you might have a different hot
[3344.16 - 3348.68] pack I'm using a hot water ptle that's
[3346.12 - 3352.60] what I'm using for this I'm also using a
[3348.68 - 3354.64] heating pad too also now you can
[3352.60 - 3355.96] localize areas with a heating pad if you
[3354.64 - 3357.68] really want want just be careful and
[3355.96 - 3359.44] don't have it on full blast like I said
[3357.68 - 3361.00] earlier you want it on a lower
[3359.44 - 3363.68] temperature so if you're going to use a
[3361.00 - 3365.80] heating pad to localize an injury
[3363.68 - 3367.72] localize just body pain and aches to
[3365.80 - 3370.92] localize nerve problems whatever you're
[3367.72 - 3373.64] dealing with just don't have it on full
[3370.92 - 3375.24] blast and don't keep it on too too long
[3373.64 - 3377.72] you don't want to cook yourself you
[3375.24 - 3379.08] don't want to cook your organs you don't
[3377.72 - 3382.00] want to cook yourself you don't want to
[3379.08 - 3383.80] go into that hypothermic place so you
[3382.00 - 3385.52] just want to be careful to I've seen
[3383.80 - 3387.76] people where boom they have heating
[3385.52 - 3389.88] blankets they got them on full blast you
[3387.76 - 3394.68] know sometimes it's just way too much
[3389.88 - 3394.68] all right so let me get a cold pack out
[3396.44 - 3402.92] here okay what I like is warmth in the
[3401.04 - 3405.16] morning if you're somebody dealing with
[3402.92 - 3407.08] chronic illness on in any way shape or
[3405.16 - 3409.84] form where you're having chronic aches
[3407.08 - 3412.20] and pains you feel like you need
[3409.84 - 3414.08] something you feel like you need warmth
[3412.20 - 3417.16] if you want to therapeutically use it
[3414.08 - 3420.32] the right way it would be heat in the
[3417.16 - 3422.32] morning warmth in the morning now that
[3420.32 - 3424.32] doesn't mean it's warmth in the morning
[3422.32 - 3426.96] and then you have to wait all day long
[3424.32 - 3430.28] to do cold at
[3426.96 - 3433.04] night it's just that first thing first
[3430.28 - 3435.32] like right away warmth in the morning
[3433.04 - 3439.36] very helpful very healing the body
[3435.32 - 3440.60] responds to it differently so that means
[3439.36 - 3442.80] if you're dealing with some aches and
[3440.60 - 3445.04] pains you got a sore back you got a sore
[3442.80 - 3446.64] shoulder you're feeling problems all
[3445.04 - 3449.12] over the place your neck and so forth
[3446.64 - 3450.20] you bring warmth to it in the morning
[3449.12 - 3454.40] that's what you
[3450.20 - 3457.24] do okay now TimeWise totally up to you 5
[3454.40 - 3459.56] minutes 10 minutes 15 minutes 20 minutes
[3457.24 - 3461.56] anything like that an hour so you can
[3459.56 - 3463.96] have a hot water bottle and leave it on
[3461.56 - 3465.64] an area in the morning where you're
[3463.96 - 3469.44] leaned up against a couch or you're in
[3465.64 - 3471.04] bed with it and it eventually gets cool
[3469.44 - 3473.20] because you've had it for an
[3471.04 - 3475.84] hour and so you've been using it for an
[3473.20 - 3479.24] hour and that's fine you can do that
[3475.84 - 3481.36] if it's the same spot you want to use
[3479.24 - 3484.48] other things therapeutically on like
[3481.36 - 3488.20] cold for instance if it's the same
[3484.48 - 3489.88] spot the cold can come after after
[3488.20 - 3493.00] you've done warmth and you done warmth
[3489.88 - 3494.84] in the area it can come directly after
[3493.00 - 3497.96] if you really wanted to or you can give
[3494.84 - 3501.00] it some time you let the warmth in that
[3497.96 - 3503.08] area kind of seep in and then over time
[3501.00 - 3505.72] whether it's an hour later half an hour
[3503.08 - 3507.52] later 20 minutes later ler 3 hours later
[3505.72 - 3509.32] you bring the cold pack into that area
[3507.52 - 3511.84] and that's fine too and you can do it
[3509.32 - 3513.16] even right after if you really wanted to
[3511.84 - 3514.68] but you want to start with warmth in the
[3513.16 - 3518.88] morning when you're dealing with hip
[3514.68 - 3520.76] pain back pain leg pain leg spasms
[3518.88 - 3524.20] cramps whatever it is that you're
[3520.76 - 3526.96] dealing with nerve pain different ticks
[3524.20 - 3530.24] and spasms and issues knee
[3526.96 - 3535.08] pain am I missing anything arm pain
[3530.24 - 3535.96] elbow pain right you do the warmth for
[3535.08 - 3539.60] in the
[3535.96 - 3543.96] morning cold can come later late morning
[3539.60 - 3545.64] is fine midday later in the afternoon at
[3543.96 - 3547.52] night and so forth now here's the thing
[3545.64 - 3550.24] it doesn't mean you can't do warmth
[3547.52 - 3552.12] again if you want to go to cold and you
[3550.24 - 3556.72] go to cold an hour later and you're
[3552.12 - 3559.20] doing a 20 minute half an hour cold
[3556.72 - 3560.80] pack right here in this towel and you're
[3559.20 - 3563.28] doing this in your back or any of that
[3560.80 - 3567.48] other place places talking about hip leg
[3563.28 - 3570.32] knee shoulder you can do that and
[3567.48 - 3572.48] then afterwards you can do warmth again
[3570.32 - 3574.40] you can switch off on and off all day
[3572.48 - 3576.84] you can go one and the other one and the
[3574.40 - 3578.12] other all day long if you'd like but you
[3576.84 - 3580.00] want to start out with the warmth in the
[3578.12 - 3583.08] morning if you
[3580.00 - 3584.76] can and then you bring in the cold layer
[3583.08 - 3587.92] now a lot of people get knee swelling
[3584.76 - 3590.80] their knees swell up they get ankle
[3587.92 - 3592.92] swelling knee swelling and that's what's
[3590.80 - 3595.60] great about the cold packs localizing on
[3592.92 - 3597.44] the areas much different than if if you
[3595.60 - 3599.20] cool down the entire body like I was
[3597.44 - 3601.44] talking about
[3599.20 - 3603.44] earlier much different when you localize
[3601.44 - 3605.44] it and you hit those areas so if you're
[3603.44 - 3607.56] dealing with some kind of knee
[3605.44 - 3610.84] pain and you
[3607.56 - 3612.52] got the cold pack right there on there
[3610.84 - 3613.84] if you're somebody that's walking around
[3612.52 - 3615.88] you start out in the morning you're not
[3613.84 - 3619.52] swollen you're not that swelled swelled
[3615.88 - 3621.20] up on the knee and Ankle wherever it is
[3619.52 - 3622.56] and you're doing you're you're doing
[3621.20 - 3624.36] your business throughout the day you're
[3622.56 - 3626.40] functioning you're being as productive
[3624.36 - 3629.68] as you can and then by the end of the
[3626.40 - 3633.12] day you're swelling knee leg something
[3629.68 - 3635.40] swelling you bring the cold pack out can
[3633.12 - 3638.24] wrap it in a towel get it icy cold out
[3635.40 - 3641.28] of the freezer put it in that area if
[3638.24 - 3643.00] your body's starting to get too cool you
[3641.28 - 3644.60] bring in your hot water bottle or
[3643.00 - 3647.04] heating pad like I was talking about
[3644.60 - 3648.92] before a lot of people can get back pain
[3647.04 - 3651.76] and pain in the lower abdomen during
[3648.92 - 3653.44] their cycle this is all great options
[3651.76 - 3655.40] for that too you can put heat on the
[3653.44 - 3657.84] abdomen ice on the the lower back so
[3655.40 - 3661.12] when menstration happens and there's a
[3657.84 - 3663.56] lot of discomfort you can be doing cool
[3661.12 - 3666.32] packs anywhere you'd like like in the
[3663.56 - 3669.00] back area you can even do cool packs in
[3666.32 - 3671.52] the abdominal area and then warmth on
[3669.00 - 3674.76] your back you can switch it and that's
[3671.52 - 3674.76] an option too for so many
[3674.96 - 3681.40] people so much to talk about so much
[3678.52 - 3683.88] information all of these tips are
[3681.40 - 3685.60] important and then you become an expert
[3683.88 - 3687.76] on how
[3685.60 - 3690.20] to help manage some of your pain and
[3687.76 - 3691.92] your aches and your swelling and while

[3732.76 - 3735.64] some fixings in just a little bit this
[3734.28 - 3738.60] is an important piece I don't want
[3735.64 - 3742.76] anybody to miss
[3738.60 - 3745.84] okay so when we're doing hot and cold
[3742.76 - 3748.84] therapies we're braak
[3745.84 - 3751.32] a cycle we might be in Han cold
[3748.84 - 3752.68] Therapies in the way I'm addressing it
[3751.32 - 3754.96] the way I'm showing you is really
[3752.68 - 3758.32] helpful for
[3754.96 - 3761.80] OCD really helpful for
[3758.32 - 3765.72] bipolar really helpful for a lot of
[3761.80 - 3768.88] different emotional and mental
[3765.72 - 3770.36] PTSD occurrences a lot of people are
[3768.88 - 3772.08] suffering from post-traumatic stress
[3770.36 - 3774.24] syndrome they're dealing with it
[3772.08 - 3777.08] post-traumatic stress issues they got
[3774.24 - 3780.76] the the PTSD they're suffering they're
[3777.08 - 3783.24] struggling and cold and hot like meaning
[3780.76 - 3784.28] a hot warm bottle a hot water bottle a
[3783.24 - 3788.44] hot
[3784.28 - 3789.88] pack a cold pad like this where you got
[3788.44 - 3794.16] that right the cold pack out of the
[3789.88 - 3797.32] freezer it can break Cycles it can even
[3794.16 - 3800.24] temporarily shift
[3797.32 - 3805.00] depression temporally shift
[3800.24 - 3809.84] sadness and temporally shift anxiety
[3805.00 - 3813.32] that's how powerful the simple little
[3809.84 - 3814.64] therapeutic option is that's so helpful
[3813.32 - 3818.00] that people who are dealing with I've
[3814.64 - 3819.60] seen people in the past totally manic
[3818.00 - 3821.80] they're they have they're actually
[3819.60 - 3825.04] engulfed in
[3821.80 - 3828.60] Mania where they're about to just hop in
[3825.04 - 3831.52] a car and just drive off a bridge
[3828.60 - 3833.84] somewhere and you put a cold pack on
[3831.52 - 3835.36] their neck and what happens is the
[3833.84 - 3838.16] neurons
[3835.36 - 3841.56] start to shift the electricity through
[3838.16 - 3844.24] the brain starts to
[3841.56 - 3846.68] shift and literally I've seen people
[3844.24 - 3849.08] come out of manic
[3846.68 - 3855.36] moments I've seen people that were just
[3849.08 - 3857.52] like so up so up where they were losing
[3855.36 - 3859.72] it I've talked to a lot of doctors and
[3857.52 - 3861.36] practitioners and heers over the years
[3859.72 - 3863.96] and I've had a lot of
[3861.36 - 3865.68] doctors ask me questions about this
[3863.96 - 3867.88] about patients that had mental health
[3865.68 - 3872.36] issues emotional
[3867.88 - 3875.28] struggles and I would say do hot and
[3872.36 - 3878.28] cold have it on hand make sure they have
[3875.28 - 3881.12] it on hand since someone's dealing with
[3878.28 - 3883.72] any kind of like struggle emotionally
[3881.12 - 3886.12] and mentally if you bring in a cold pack
[3883.72 - 3887.76] and you just rest it on the abdomen
[3886.12 - 3890.36] something starts to
[3887.76 - 3892.92] shift you rest it in the lower back
[3890.36 - 3895.28] something starts to shift you put it on
[3892.92 - 3897.36] your thighs a cold back on your thighs
[3895.28 - 3900.52] and something starts to
[3897.36 - 3904.52] shift because what happens
[3900.52 - 3906.64] is your neurons start to
[3904.52 - 3909.28] reroute electricity that's going to
[3906.64 - 3910.60] neurons to neurons start to redirect and
[3909.28 - 3913.28] it heads into different parts of the
[3910.60 - 3917.12] brain that it wasn't heading
[3913.28 - 3919.88] into and so it's shifting that pathway
[3917.12 - 3922.52] that electrical grid sending it into
[3919.88 - 3926.08] different neurons it's not normally
[3922.52 - 3926.08] headed for
[3926.16 - 3929.32] and so when we're dealing with things
[3927.72 - 3931.24] emotionally emotional struggles we're
[3929.32 - 3934.08] dealing with mental
[3931.24 - 3936.12] stress you come home from a really bad
[3934.08 - 3938.32] day or you've been home and you got some
[3936.12 - 3940.28] bad news or you've had a struggle and
[3938.32 - 3943.08] you bring out a cold
[3940.28 - 3945.04] pack it can help alleviate and even
[3943.08 - 3947.52] shift that of how you're feeling in that
[3945.04 - 3949.72] moment so things calm down or maybe
[3947.52 - 3951.88] you're like a hot head and you get some
[3949.72 - 3953.44] bad news and you just want to explode on
[3951.88 - 3955.60] someone a friend or something and you
[3953.44 - 3957.72] want to hit them with all kinds of texts
[3955.60 - 3961.00] and tell them how they did you wrong if
[3957.72 - 3962.88] you stop for a moment and you get a cold
[3961.00 - 3965.56] pack out of the
[3962.88 - 3968.52] freezer and you start putting a cold
[3965.56 - 3970.16] pack on the top of your head on the side
[3968.52 - 3972.04] of your neck for a little bit on your
[3970.16 - 3974.96] chest for a little bit watch the
[3972.04 - 3976.32] difference 10 minutes 15 minutes later
[3974.96 - 3978.44] you're going to take your phone and
[3976.32 - 3980.20] you're not going to fire out like what
[3978.44 - 3982.60] you were going to fire out to that
[3980.20 - 3984.88] friend to that loved
[3982.60 - 3987.32] one so maybe maybe a sibling did
[3984.88 - 3991.20] something to you and they took your
[3987.32 - 3992.68] car maybe you know a parent told you you
[3991.20 - 3995.24] couldn't do this or that you got really
[3992.68 - 3997.48] upset maybe a coworker this so maybe a
[3995.24 - 4000.16] spouse maybe a loved one maybe a friend
[3997.48 - 4002.80] maybe a friend totally backstabbed you
[4000.16 - 4005.24] and started dating your
[4002.80 - 4007.08] ex-girlfriend maybe something happened
[4005.24 - 4009.40] or your ex-boyfriend and you're
[4007.08 - 4011.60] literally going to go bananas you feel
[4009.40 - 4014.28] totally betrayed you feel totally
[4011.60 - 4016.12] wronged or you feel like something
[4014.28 - 4018.04] coming on you can't explain it you're
[4016.12 - 4019.76] about to have like an episode where
[4018.04 - 4021.24] you're going to have some anger develop
[4019.76 - 4023.04] like anger is starting to steam you
[4021.24 - 4024.92] don't know why you're so pissed off
[4023.04 - 4026.16] maybe you maybe it's been just stirring
[4024.92 - 4028.56] up inside of you because you've been
[4026.16 - 4030.80] chronically sick for a long time and
[4028.56 - 4032.92] struggling and maybe you're just like
[4030.80 - 4035.84] getting triggered by something on social
[4032.92 - 4039.88] media and anger's actually getting fired
[4035.84 - 4041.88] up you take a cold pack and you put that
[4039.88 - 4043.36] to a spot in your body your chest for a
[4041.88 - 4045.44] minute your abdomen the back of your
[4043.36 - 4048.12] neck and all of a sudden it starts to
[4045.44 - 4049.68] shift and that anger spell you can
[4048.12 - 4052.56] actually
[4049.68 - 4054.44] avoid and the anger is not like tearing
[4052.56 - 4056.92] into you and tearing you apart you can
[4054.44 - 4059.44] actually avoid it that cold pack can
[4056.92 - 4061.32] shift you into a different direction
[4059.44 - 4063.72] think about how powerful that
[4061.32 - 4067.24] is really

[5109.72 - 5114.64] let everybody know I I have a feeling
[5111.88 - 5118.08] some of you don't think I read your
[5114.64 - 5121.12] comments but I do I do so I want people
[5118.08 - 5122.76] to know it's important like on YouTube a
[5121.12 - 5125.36] lot of people leave comments on there
[5122.76 - 5128.28] you know I read
[5125.36 - 5130.16] them so that that I mean I want you to
[5128.28 - 5132.24] know I can't read every comment in the
[5130.16 - 5134.16] world on all the platforms I'm just
[5132.24 - 5136.84] letting you know but on YouTube for sure
[5134.16 - 5139.40] I've I read every single one of
[5136.84 - 5141.24] them so if you want to say something
[5139.40 - 5143.44] terrible to me that's a great place to
[5141.24 - 5146.76] do
[5143.44 - 5146.76] it e
[5148.44 - 5155.92] w why do you do this why do you do that
[5152.56 - 5159.04] I'll read it I'll have my cold packs
[5155.92 - 5161.72] ready all right so my crinkle fries are
[5159.04 - 5164.92] cooking once they're cooked making the
[5161.72 - 5167.92] cheese sauce putting on the fixings and
[5164.92 - 5170.16] we're going nacho crazy
[5167.92 - 5171.72] um now I want to bring out one of the
[5170.16 - 5175.32] books
[5171.72 - 5178.08] here do you have brain saver protocols
[5175.32 - 5180.76] the amount of symptoms and conditions in
[5178.08 - 5183.64] here really really incredible and
[5180.76 - 5186.32] helpful and the Protocols are in here
[5183.64 - 5189.04] too I see a lot of
[5186.32 - 5190.84] people they look at a protocol and
[5189.04 - 5192.64] they're like what do I do and there's a
[5190.84 - 5195.52] chapter in here that covers that where
[5192.64 - 5196.40] you can start out with just one thing or
[5195.52 - 5199.92] two
[5196.40 - 5202.96] things or three things and you can start
[5199.92 - 5205.80] out small and just keep it to that you
[5202.96 - 5208.08] can also go as far as you need to go and
[5205.80 - 5209.76] that's in here too sometimes some people
[5208.08 - 5212.24] be like whoa wait a minute he's got a
[5209.76 - 5214.64] protocol in there there's a lot going
[5212.24 - 5216.56] going on how do I do that what do I do
[5214.64 - 5218.64] and what people don't realize is if you
[5216.56 - 5221.20] read the instructions in the book If you
[5218.64 - 5223.28] read the chapter about supplementation
[5221.20 - 5225.76] and protocols for symptoms and
[5223.28 - 5228.60] conditions what you'll find is that you
[5225.76 - 5230.20] can start just with some of the key
[5228.60 - 5234.36] foundational
[5230.20 - 5236.68] tools key foundational supplements and
[5234.36 - 5238.52] you can start there and see how you feel
[5236.68 - 5240.64] along the way but you know you can go
[5238.52 - 5242.64] further and further the thing about
[5240.64 - 5244.80] medical medium information is you can
[5242.64 - 5247.60] take it as far as you need to go but a
[5244.80 - 5249.32] lot of people don't do that so a lot of
[5247.60 - 5251.16] people will do some celery juice for
[5249.32 - 5253.32] like two weeks and then they'll claim
[5251.16 - 5255.80] they did medical medium especially if
[5253.32 - 5258.12] they're a hater so you got to keep in
[5255.80 - 5260.92] mind is you'll see out there people
[5258.12 - 5262.44] scream I did medical medium and this
[5260.92 - 5265.12] terrible thing happened to me it's like
[5262.44 - 5268.44] you did do med you did medical medium
[5265.12 - 5270.88] really or did you do a whole bunch of
[5268.44 - 5273.60] other stuff you mean you weren't eating
[5270.88 - 5275.92] chocolate you you mean you weren't doing
[5273.60 - 5278.56] this you weren't doing that and so
[5275.92 - 5281.04] people just they will just scream at if
[5278.56 - 5283.08] they're a hater like if they if for some
[5281.04 - 5285.72] reason someone convinces them I'm a bad
[5283.08 - 5288.32] guy or something they like okay and they
[5285.72 - 5290.88] did celery juice for like a week or
[5288.32 - 5292.92] every other day for a month and they're
[5290.88 - 5294.88] doing all this other stuff right and
[5292.92 - 5297.32] they just like I did medical medium and
[5294.88 - 5299.84] it doesn't work he did this he did this
[5297.32 - 5302.84] it did this look out for that because
[5299.84 - 5304.52] it's ridiculous and people don't realize
[5302.84 - 5305.84] that there's a lot of exposures people
[5304.52 - 5308.36] are up against
[5305.84 - 5311.20] too so every day we have all these
[5308.36 - 5312.96] exposures that we're up against and
[5311.20 - 5314.36] every day we also have things inside of
[5312.96 - 5317.16] our body that have been sitting there
[5314.36 - 5319.64] for like 20 30 40 years wreaking havoc
[5317.16 - 5321.48] on our body that people haven't gotten
[5319.64 - 5323.36] out of their body because they're not
[5321.48 - 5325.52] doing the right stuff to get the junk
[5323.36 - 5327.20] and garbage out so they have a drain on
[5325.52 - 5329.76] them of what's inside their body that's
[5327.20 - 5333.68] toxic and then they're getting outside
[5329.76 - 5336.72] exposures on a regular basis
[5333.68 - 5339.68] I've seen over the years like doctors
[5336.72 - 5341.80] tell me I thought my patient was doing
[5339.68 - 5343.12] medical medium and it turns out they
[5341.80 - 5344.76] were drinking on the weekends every
[5343.12 - 5347.04] single
[5344.76 - 5349.84] weekend I
[5347.04 - 5352.68] had a feather for every time I heard
[5349.84 - 5355.72] that I'd be like flying
[5352.68 - 5359.48] away to a tropical
[5355.72 - 5361.64] island and never coming back again like
[5359.48 - 5363.00] seriously and I mean this like I can't
[5361.64 - 5365.20] tell you how many practitioners I've
[5363.00 - 5366.80] talked to where they're like I thought
[5365.20 - 5368.80] they were doing medical medium but when
[5366.80 - 5371.32] I really asked them and I really went
[5368.80 - 5373.40] into it cuz I thought they were doing
[5371.32 - 5376.32] what they were supposed to do that the
[5373.40 - 5378.76] doctor was guiding them on and they
[5376.32 - 5379.88] weren't they were doing so many other
[5378.76 - 5382.32] different
[5379.88 - 5385.64] things and it was affecting
[5382.32 - 5386.96] them so what you'll see is a bunch of
[5385.64 - 5392.36] situations that are occurring in the
[5386.96 - 5394.08] medical M community and one of them is
[5392.36 - 5397.00] like I tried medical medium and it
[5394.08 - 5399.04] didn't work but yet the person didn't
[5397.00 - 5401.00] try they didn't do the monoc cleanse for
[5399.04 - 5403.00] their digestive problems they didn't do
[5401.00 - 5405.24] the 28 day cleanse and they just stay
[5403.00 - 5407.20] off all the heavy fats they were eating
[5405.24 - 5409.40] they were on fat all the time and
[5407.20 - 5411.68] there's nothing wrong with that there's
[5409.40 - 5414.20] nothing wrong with trying something and
[5411.68 - 5416.04] not doing all of it there's nothing
[5414.20 - 5419.00] wrong with trying one or two medical
[5416.04 - 5422.52] medium tools and then keeping the others
[5419.00 - 5425.68] out what's wrong is screaming
[5422.52 - 5429.08] that I did medical medium when you
[5425.68 - 5432.00] didn't that's wrong and I see that a lot
[5429.08 - 5433.80] out there and it's sad because you might
[5432.00 - 5436.84] be this other person that's like a new
[5433.80 - 5438.40] person that just came in like I heard a
[5436.84 - 5440.76] whole bunch of people healed on medical
[5438.40 - 5442.60] medium they got the most healing stories
[5440.76 - 5444.76] in the world out of any
[5442.60 - 5447.44] single you know whatever out there in
[5444.76 - 5448.32] the health world so let me try something
[5447.44 - 5450.84] and then all of a sudden they get
[5448.32 - 5452.48] bombarded with someone that's like
[5450.84 - 5453.96] trolling
[5452.48 - 5456.20] I tried medical medium it didn't work
[5453.96 - 5458.96] for me my whatever got worse than I
[5456.20 - 5461.60] would ever I go and try this and this
[5458.96 - 5463.68] helped me over here and then they're
[5461.60 - 5465.36] screwed they're like they don't try
[5463.68 - 5467.04] medical medium they're off to doing the
[5465.36 - 5469.60] same old stuff that everybody's ever
[5467.04 - 5472.80] done and whatnot hopefully they find
[5469.60 - 5474.92] their way back but that doesn't always
[5472.80 - 5477.76] happen so there's nothing wrong with
[5474.92 - 5479.44] trying one thing and there's nothing
[5477.76 - 5480.80] wrong with also dabbling and other
[5479.44 - 5483.52] things out there but when it's not
[5480.80 - 5486.12] working for you don't blame what you're
[5483.52 - 5488.20] dabbling in on medical medium so if
[5486.12 - 5491.28] you're doing bad zeyt cuz they're all
[5488.20 - 5493.16] bad now don't blame medical medium when
[5491.28 - 5494.76] something's not working for you if
[5493.16 - 5497.16] you're doing the Pearl powder the bad
[5494.76 - 5499.72] zeits the charcoal ingesting it the
[5497.16 - 5501.92] Bentonite Clays you're doing all that
[5499.72 - 5505.04] plus 100 sodium
[5501.92 - 5507.80] bicarbonate don't blame medical medium a
[5505.04 - 5509.48] year later after you did all the stuff
[5507.80 - 5512.56] that damaged your health that medical
[5509.48 - 5514.80] medum doesn't doesn't recommend that's
[5512.56 - 5516.16] wrong and that's what people are doing
[5514.80 - 5517.48] if you're eating a chocolate bar every
[5516.16 - 5519.52] week and another chocolate bar every
[5517.48 - 5521.92] week don't say you did medical medium
[5519.52 - 5524.04] when you're sick and the chocolate bar
[5521.92 - 5526.40] got you more viral cuz it just blew up
[5524.04 - 5529.52] your immune system and nervous
[5526.40 - 5532.76] system don't then say it was medical
[5529.52 - 5534.64] medium that did it that's what's wrong
[5532.76 - 5536.36] same thing with Medical Treatments if
[5534.64 - 5538.60] you go and try a medical treatment cuz
[5536.36 - 5541.24] that's up to you I believe in doctors I
[5538.60 - 5542.32] recommend doctors all the time I love
[5541.24 - 5544.36] doctors
[5542.32 - 5546.04] everybody should have one but what
[5544.36 - 5548.60] happens is if you're doing a medical
[5546.04 - 5551.12] treatment that went wrong don't blame
[5548.60 - 5553.56] medical medium and the celery juice
[5551.12 - 5555.60] that's where that's just and
[5553.56 - 5558.48] the same thing if you got into a new
[5555.60 - 5559.92] relationship and you caught 10 new bugs
[5558.48 - 5563.00] and now you have a new bat of chronic
[5559.92 - 5565.48] fatigue syndrome and a new UTI don't
[5563.00 - 5567.76] blame medical medium that's just
[5565.48 - 5569.72]  just keep that in mind I know
[5567.76 - 5571.72] you guys don't do it I know you guys
[5569.72 - 5573.92] aren't doing that I'm just saying that
[5571.72 - 5575.92] and then it's not you guys but it's
[5573.92 - 5578.52] people out there that are that are you
[5575.92 - 5579.96] know that do that okay they'll get into
[5578.52 - 5584.04] a new relationship but they won't be
[5579.96 - 5585.80] honest about it you know and which is
[5584.04 - 5587.08] fine we we should be able to get into
[5585.80 - 5590.56] relationships if we want to get into
[5587.08 - 5592.76] relationships but if you do if you do
[5590.56 - 5594.44] get two or three more viruses and three
[5592.76 - 5596.40] varieties of strep and you all of a
[5594.44 - 5599.44] sudden got UTI and sinus infections
[5596.40 - 5599.44] again don't blame medical
[5599.60 - 5603.56] media if you're somebody that's doing
[5601.72 - 5605.48] ice baths all the time then 6 months
[5603.56 - 5607.08] later you get into adrenal fatigue
[5605.48 - 5610.32] because your adrenals just got drained
[5607.08 - 5612.64] from the ice baths don't blame medical
[5610.32 - 5614.60] medium if you're using the alkaline
[5612.64 - 5616.64] ionizer water machines the ones that
[5614.60 - 5620.44] sound like
[5616.64 - 5620.44] kangaroo the ones that sound like
[5620.60 - 5625.44] kangaroo if you do those and you're
[5623.08 - 5627.24] getting metals and metals and more
[5625.44 - 5628.64] metals and more Metals in your system
[5627.24 - 5630.40] because it's rotting off the plate
[5628.64 - 5632.68] inside the ionizer machine if you got
[5630.40 - 5634.72] suckered into buying a three $1,000
[5632.68 - 5637.44] alkaline ionizer water
[5634.72 - 5640.20] machine and you're contaminating your
[5637.44 - 5641.80] system with all that toxic water and you
[5640.20 - 5644.12] get sick in two years like everybody
[5641.80 - 5646.76] else did 20 years ago with that water

[6121.56 - 6126.08] little bit of water if we need it so I'm
[6123.96 - 6127.96] going to I'm going to be careful with
[6126.08 - 6130.40] this
[6127.96 - 6133.96] because you put too much water in there
[6130.40 - 6138.04] then you got a cheese that you may not
[6133.96 - 6138.04] want boom
[6139.76 - 6143.04] boom
[6141.44 - 6145.40] we're going to add some water in

[6146.60 - 6150.32] yeast you know many people do
[6148.44 - 6152.36] nutritional yeast and they mess up their
[6150.32 - 6155.44] health because of
[6152.36 - 6157.08] it I'm doing medical medium but they're
[6155.44 - 6158.52] taking down all that nutritional yeast
[6157.08 - 6160.28] it's on everything they're buying stuff
[6158.52 - 6162.00] with nutritional yeast in it but I'm
[6160.28 - 6165.24] doing medical medium and it hurt me but
[6162.00 - 6165.24] they're doing all this nutritional
[6167.76 - 6172.12] yeast it's okay to actually do one
[6170.80 - 6174.12] medical medium thing and only one
[6172.12 - 6176.60] medical medium thing there's nothing
[6174.12 - 6176.60] wrong with
[6178.36 - 6183.88] that you can do one or two medical
[6181.40 - 6183.88] medium
[6187.12 - 6193.28] things like I challenge people to do one
[6190.08 - 6193.28] medical medium thing it's
[6194.44 - 6199.84] fine but if something's not working for
[6197.72 - 6202.56] you look at everything else you're doing
[6199.84 - 6205.00] or you did look at everything before you
[6202.56 - 6208.92] start screaming from the roof
[6205.00 - 6211.16] rooftop about like celery juice giving
[6208.92 - 6211.16] you the
[6212.52 - 6217.12] runs anyway it's just something to think
[6215.12 - 6219.24] about I keep on for forgetting to bring
[6217.12 - 6219.24] it
[6221.76 - 6225.44] up let's take a look at this I want to
[6223.92 - 6227.36] see the
[6225.44 - 6228.88] consistency it's actually a good
[6227.36 - 6232.68] consistency right there I actually
[6228.88 - 6232.68] really like that let's give it another
[6234.00 - 6237.00] run
[6238.52 - 6243.84] okay and what I'm going to do is is sprp
[6241.64 - 6243.84] the
[6257.08 - 6262.16] sides and I might put a little bit more
[6259.72 - 6264.32] potato in this one which I like I think
[6262.16 - 6265.92] it's a good idea I put a little extra
[6264.32 - 6268.16] carrot in there versus
[6265.92 - 6271.00] potato look you can have the cheddar
[6268.16 - 6273.24] cheese look right there where it's that
[6271.00 - 6275.32] like but what I'm going to do is just
[6273.24 - 6279.04] lighten it up a little
[6275.32 - 6279.04] bit with another
[6281.76 - 6286.44] potato and I hear my crinkle fries are
[6287.72 - 6292.56] calling well there we go
[6294.64 - 6297.16] that should do
[6297.84 - 6301.24] it bigger
[6302.68 - 6306.36] batch a little bit
[6313.64 - 6320.28] water I'm so
[6316.44 - 6323.80] hungry I am excited I am like psyched
[6320.28 - 6323.80] and pumped about eating
[6333.96 - 6338.88] this let's see the consistency that I
[6336.40 - 6338.88] want for
[6340.32 - 6345.80] cheese I don't want
[6342.80 - 6345.80] it
[6345.84 - 6349.04] that's all
[6349.48 - 6352.48] right
[6354.40 - 6358.36] you want to do is put the cheese on
[6355.76 - 6360.84] First on top of the crinkle fries before
[6358.36 - 6360.84] you put your
[6363.88 - 6369.44] fixings and let's clean things up a
[6366.16 - 6369.44] little bit and make some
