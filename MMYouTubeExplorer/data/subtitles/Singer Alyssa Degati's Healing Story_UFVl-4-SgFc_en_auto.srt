struggle

88
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,680
and i mean from not being validated from

89
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,800
being

90
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,319
six as a child i mean

91
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,479
literally as a child that's how it

00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:02,080
started for you and

93
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:05,360
and then to become then

94
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:08,960

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:12,400
with the inability to even swallow or

96
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,960

97
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,120
hard to live with i can't even imagine

98
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,280
you were out of place

99
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,479
you were at a place of just absolute

100
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,600
despair

101
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:25,600

experienced being sick when you were

127
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,680
young too with the utis at like nine

128
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,720
years old

129
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,599
right and and everything at like six

130
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,080
months old

131
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:35,520
six months old i start i can't i came in

132
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:39,039
like kicking with a high strep load

133
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:41,680
um yeah i was sick as a as a baby

134
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,560
um and i had chronic stress i just had

135
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,879
like

136
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:48,800
you know pneumonia bronchitis um

137
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,800
strep throat until i had my tonsils out

138
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:54,000
and so i was really sick as a kid

139
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,720
and then i started my cycle at nine so

140
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,199
pretty young

141
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,120
and then with that came all these other

142
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:02,639
symptoms and that's when

143
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:06,319
um pretty severe acne started and

144
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,039
weight gain and um constipation all

145
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,759
these other

146
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:11,039
things that i think as society we just

147
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,639
think are

148
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,360
normal because they're common so i

149
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,240
didn't really realize that none of that

150
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,400
was

151
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,280
like i didn't really identify as being

152
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,560
sickly but

153
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:27,039
i i did struggle i struggled a lot and

154
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:28,720
i think the first big um

155
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,960
the big hit that i took was when i was

156
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,320
in high school and i had a near-death

157
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,159
experience with

158
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,839
blood clots in my lungs yeah that was

159
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,080
the big one

160
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,120
that was a big one that just kind of

161
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,159
like

162
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,120
rocked my world because you i sort of

163
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,680
felt invincible

164
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,560
in a way you know um at that age and

165
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,320
that just

166
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,160
i didn't know what to do with that

167
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,080
because i

168
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,519
didn't have answers for why that

169
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,000
happened to me it was just sort of like

170
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,480
this

171
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,160
random hey one day you wake up with

172
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,200
blood clots and almost die

173
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:03,120
and we have no answers for you so i

174
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,760
didn't really know how to process

175
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,240
any of that and um it was about two

176
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,720
years

177
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,399
after that experience that i started

178
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,279
having panic attacks and i started

179
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,760
having

180
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,720
anxiety and everything just kind of just

181
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,160
kept building

182
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:21,279
and then um when i was 23

183
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,000
i just it was like a flip switched and i

184
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,600
couldn't swallow

185
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,440
one day and um

186
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,880
yeah it just like went downhill from

187
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,120
there and i i went

188
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,320
through i mean i saw every doctor every

189
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,720
specialist

190
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,800
had every test done i had my esophagus

191
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,080
stretched um i didn't even need to

192
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:42,560
it wasn't even um

193
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,839
a physical thing i i mean it was but it

194
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,000
felt like it was more

195
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,959
up here than an issue here i'm sure i

196
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,279
felt

197
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,000
because it was it was neurological it

198
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,360
wasn't exactly

199
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,920
mechanical it was the nervous system

200
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,279
and something that just doctors don't

201
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,120
have answers for

202
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,560
and you went to exactly you did

203
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:05,760
everything you did

204
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:08,320
you seen every doctor every specialist

205
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,959
i drank the barium i had all the

206
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,200
everything

207
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,560
and it wasn't even food getting lodged

208
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,760
it was truly like

209
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,680
truly neurological and and i was told

210
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,640
it's all in your head it's just anxiety

211
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:23,839
and i remember

212
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:26,240
it's so sad i remember begging to have

213
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,519
a diagnosis of a neurological disease

214
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,560
because then i would have an answer and

215
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,079
hopefully

216
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,160
would be able to have a cure or

217
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,839
something but to hear it's just all in

218
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,920
your head it's just anxiety

219
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,839
terrified me because i thought how am i

220
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,399
ever gonna get through this

221
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,079
it just kept getting worse and worse and

222
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,959
i felt so alone

223
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,480
i felt so alone because nobody not only

224
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:49,040
to know doctor

225
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,959
or therapist or specialist i mean like

226
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,279
top psychiatrists nobody had ever seen

227
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,160
this

228
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:56,320
not even this phobia which it turned

229
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,320
into because i tried to just

230
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,000
fight through it at first and cope with

231
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,640
it and then i ended up

232
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,399
choking so bad which i felt like was

233
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,000
from my own doing because i almost had

234
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,480
like this hyper awareness of

235
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,160
not being able to swallow and um and

236
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,519
then i just started to starve to death i

237
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,440
just couldn't i couldn't even

238
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,200
drink like drinking water was even

239
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,399
harder

240
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:20,160
and i just started to like

241
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,839
kind of just waste away and then my

242
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,920
nervous system i feel like i had a

243
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,920
complete nervous breakdown

244
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,440
um that's the best way to describe it i

245
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,680
kind of felt like i had

246
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,600
no skin and all my nerves were exposed

247
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,320
and just constantly like

248
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,440
like my brain short circuiting and i

249
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,839
could not function

250
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,800
and nobody understood and i felt so

251
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,720
alone

252
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:46,079
that was probably the hardest part um

253
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:48,800
yeah so you know you're

254
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,800
you're a hero in my eyes okay because

255
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,320
you know like there was something inside

256
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,959
of you and i i know that the medical

257
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,120
medium

258
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,480
community can relate because they're all

259
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,240
fighters

260
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,920
and and that's what's incredible about

261
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,440
this community right you know the

262
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:06,880
incredible i mean right and um

263
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:10,480
and it takes something inside of us and

264
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:13,040
you have that that's just that

265
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,920
because i mean there are people out

266
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,839
there that if

267
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,760
they ever had that condition and

268
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,920
struggle i mean they didn't doesn't mean

269
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:23,279
they would have made it either

270
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:26,399
you you are that much of a fighter and

271
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:29,279
thank you and it's it's

272
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:31,120
it's so powerful and the thing is and

273
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,720
that's with you not being validated

274
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,959
there was never any validation

275
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,040
going back through your whole life of

276
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:39,519
being sick it was never like you got

277
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,480
this validation like yes alyssa you're

278
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,560
really sick

279
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,200
and we're going to figure this out or

280
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,959
yes you're really experiencing this

281
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,639
i mean you were told that it was all in

282
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:52,320
your head yep

283
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:54,240
you're told that overall well

284
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,079
before the blood clots right the blood

285
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,279
clots in your lungs and before your

286
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,760
blood clots

287
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,120
they they were like you're it was like

288
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,560
when you had pain

289
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,079
you had pain for weeks yep and

290
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,160
no there's nothing wrong with you and i

291
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,360
was told i was being a hypochondriac

292
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:13,360
from multiple people

293
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,399
and yeah that was that was hard because

294
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,440
i

295
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:19,440
i was so young but my body was sending

296
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,639
me signals and maybe my intuition

297
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,560
i don't know i feel like i was getting

298
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,240
i i just had this new awareness in my

299
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,880
body that i didn't have before and so i

300
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,200
started to

301
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,279
feel like i i it's almost like i just

302
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,880
had this intuition that i was

303
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,320
gonna die or something because i felt

304
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,639
like i was

305
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,600
and um everybody just dismissed it and

306
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,920
then

307
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,519
i never complained of pain because i was

308
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,160
you know i had been through it already

309
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:46,240
at that point by 17 and i just had a

310
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,480
high pain tolerance i really just didn't

311
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,000
complain and so i i woke up and i

312
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,839
thought i was having a heart attack

313
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,279
it was the most excruciating pain i

314
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,639
could not get relief from

315
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,920
in my back and my chest and um i took

316
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,240
like eight advil

317
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,440
and i went on my way my mom booked me a

318
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,959
doctor's appointment i went to my

319
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,160
pediatrician

320
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:08,079
and i was told it was just viral and let

321
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,480
it run its course i i did just to be

322
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,000
safe

323
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,839
i went to the hospital i got all the

324
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,040
tests everything came back

325
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,880
clear so i went a week misdiagnosed and

326
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,279
then

327
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,440
fortunately they they found out why i

328
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,880
had that pain so that was such a miracle

329
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,000
in itself but

330
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:29,040
i had no answers i had like

331
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,279
i ended up for months getting you know

332
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,959
crazy amount of blood draws and just

333
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,720
like

334
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,959
no answers i'm just told it was

335
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,800
autoimmune it was like a year straight

336
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:41,680
up blood draws

337
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,959
which which like keeps weekly multiple

338
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,600
times a week yeah

339
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:47,279
and so you were just like you're just

340
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:51,199
fighting for your life

341
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,920
yeah like at that point i felt like a 95

342
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,920
year old woman

343
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,600
like just just to sit up straight and

344
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,959
just to walk to the bathroom and brush

345
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,320
my teeth and

346
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,800
and this is my senior year of high

347
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,839
school so it was it was rough and i had

348
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,880
to give myself

349
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:09,839
shots in the stomach every day and

350
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:12,639
it was it was crazy

351
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,480
and then you know and then when you and

352
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,440
then you're you're pursuing your musical

353
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,560

about the medical medium community is

627

and pain and suffering was like

628
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,720
my lungs and my throat my voice isn't

629
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:42,080
that interesting

630
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,919
it's yeah it is it is and it's it's it's

631
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,440
like okay now my chronic illness has

632
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,039
taken away something

633
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,120
that's the most important thing in my

634
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:50,640
life it's the thing that keeps me strong

635
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,880
and stable

636
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,919
it's and i've seen that with chronic

637
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,799
illness where

638
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:58,720
you got somebody who's a runner you know

639
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:59,200
they do track or their olympic athlete

640
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,640
they want

641
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,320
either they're working to be that way

642
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,840
and then their chronic illness takes

643
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:07,279
them away from the very thing that

644
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:09,760
they want to do which is running or say

645
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:12,159
someone loves to exercise every single

646
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:14,400
day but it takes them away from that or

647
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,080
but with you it's like this is this is

648
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,080
everything to you this is

649
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,200
your singing the music that's your

650
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,679
creativity

651
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:24,080
it's your it it feels like a big part of

652
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:26,159
your existence i mean this is yeah

653
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,159
this is the you work for god and you

654
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:31,440
create beautiful music

655
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:33,760
music that is healing for people and

656
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,840
supports them so for that to be taken

657
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,360
away from you

658
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,720
which means it's taken away from

659
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,480
everybody else too because then they

660
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,919
can't hear the music they can't

661
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:46,159
they can't heal from it so it really

662
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:48,000
it's it's devastating to both you and

663
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:50,320
your life personal life

664
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,880
and it's sad because people can't heal

665
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:56,559
with your music if you're not

666
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:59,760
able to actually do it and sing it

667
00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:01,360
and but now we have you we have you in

668
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,120
our life you're in our life you're

669
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,960

678
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:22,320
out of the ashes and

679
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:24,080
