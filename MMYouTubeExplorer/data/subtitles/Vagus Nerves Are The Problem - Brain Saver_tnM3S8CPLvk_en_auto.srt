chronic mystery illness and guess what

71
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,900

73
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,019

know that

75
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:57,180
that inflammation of the cranial nerves

76
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:59,580
plays a large role in chronic mystery

77
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,900
illness you'll never hear that out of

00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,660

read a little bit to you guys if you

84
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:20,640

is everybody available here

87
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:32,040
as I always say as I always say

88
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:36,980
mystery illness misrealness which is

89
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,980
99.9 of all chronic mystery illness duh

90
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:42,480
it's a much broader category than anyone

91
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:46,620
realizes we think that if a condition

92
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,780
has a name this part here blows me away

93
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,640
you can talk to like health

94
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,200
professionals and they won't even get

95
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,299
this you can say it over and over to

96
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,760
them and they won't even understand what

97
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:58,620
you're even saying I I know I've dealt

98
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,720
with this before check this out

99
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:03,840
we think of that ready

100
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,879
we think that if a condition has a name

101
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,799
your lupus your fibromyalgia your

102
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:09,840
Hashimoto's thyroiditis list goes on on

103
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:12,360
whatever

104
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,120
such as anxiety fatigue pots vertigo

105
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:17,699
Bells Palsy neuropathy ocular migraines

106
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,579
then it must not be a mystery to the

107
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:22,860
medical research and science group

108
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:25,020
because it has a name it doesn't have

109
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,960
it's not a mystery anymore that's the

110
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:29,820
biggest confusion out there you can be a

111
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,919
doctor go to medical school come out of

112
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:34,139
medical school know that a condition has

113
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,479
a name get a blood test for somebody's

114
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:38,580
thyroid or whatever and then now you got

115
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:41,220
a name for the thyroid problem

116
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:45,000
but you don't have anything else it's

117
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:46,919
still a mystery 100 percent a mystery

118
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,720
hi vegan Allison

119
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:50,699
I see you said hi Emma I see your

still a mystery

122
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:57,500
that's the whole point

123
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:02,460
so if we think fatigue pots vertigo

124
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,320
Bell's Palsy neuropathy or ocular

125
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:06,060
migraines and it must not be a mystery

126
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:09,240
and more problem solved you guys you

127
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:12,660

solved right there's no mystery anymore

131
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:21,540
think about that that's how absurd it

132
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,820
all is when you think about it this

133
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:27,360
piece of information alone is a game

134
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:29,520
changer in medical research and science

135
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,280
right is your problem solved because

136
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:38,060

Jesse Lane awesome new live

170
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:01,819
dude thank you for being here man and

171
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,819
you're on YouTube I saw

172
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:06,780
all right

173
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,000
being handed a label for your set of

174
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:11,639
symptoms isn't the same as receiving

175
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,020
answers about why those symptoms are

176
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:15,300
interrupting your life in the first

177
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:17,780
place getting a label doesn't mean jack

178
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:22,319
you got a label you go home with a label

179
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:24,180
great

180
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,580
you got a label now

181
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:28,919
great

182
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:31,020
but it doesn't mean enough

183
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:34,319
it doesn't mean Jack

184
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:37,919
 it doesn't the whole point is

185
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:39,599
you can have a label like depression but

186
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:43,520
you ain't gonna get better unless you

187
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,520
know what's wrong with the real cause is

188
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:50,160
whether you're living with a diagnosis a

189
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:52,020
misdiagnosis or a non-diagnosis there

190
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,599
are answers to be found in getting to

191
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:58,099
know your brain stem

192
00:07:54,599 --> 00:08:01,139
your brain stem and your cranial nerves

193
00:07:58,099 --> 00:08:03,360
this is what it's about right here the

194
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:05,639
cranial nerves I mean the whole these

195
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,280
two books alone and what's in here like

196
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:10,979
I said I can't even get out of chapter

197
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,900
six like I'm stuck in chapter six

198
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:14,520
because it's that there's so much

199
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,960
information but there's so much

200
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,819
information in every line of the book

201
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,379
you can just open it up

202
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:21,780
I got a doctor friend that opened up the

203
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:24,620
book was like

204
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,620
what

205
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:30,300
it's like it literally it's every line

206
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,800
okay cranial nerve answers your cranial

207
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,620
nerves include your vagus nerves

208
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:37,320
trigeminal nerves facial nerves

209
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:41,640
among many others your cranial nerves

210
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:46,020
extend out of your brain stem so

211
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:48,800
your cranial nerves extend out of your

212
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,800
brain stem

213
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:55,019
and when they get inflamed

214
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,600
all the crap goes down

215
00:08:55,019 --> 00:09:01,200
all the crap goes down

216
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:03,000
doctor after doctor after doctor when

217
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,580
those nerves coming out of the brain

218
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,100
stem get inflamed it's doctor it's

219
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:10,740
functional doctor it's natural doctor

220
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:13,040
it's conventional doctor it's every

221
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,040
doctor

222
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:19,620
your cranial nerves extend out of your

223
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:21,180
brain stem and many symptoms of chronic

224
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:24,720
illness derived from these cranial

225
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:25,800
nerves if a cranial nerve is inflamed in

226
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,980
any way

227
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:31,380
check this out

228
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:34,380
inflamed in any way

229
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:38,279
because of viral neurotoxins doctors

230
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:40,560
don't know about I'm not trying to be

231
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:42,839
you know mean

232
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,880
it's going to say some other word I'm

233
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:49,100
glad I didn't say it right I'm not

234
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,100
trying to be a jerk

235
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:53,519
I'm just saying they don't know about

236
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:55,560
neurotoxins they don't know about what's

237
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,019
even in here this is so Advanced when

238
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:01,260
you even think about it

239
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:04,140
Erica Erica Hey on YouTube

240
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:05,880
labels are meant to shut us up like we

241
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:09,120
should be satisfied with the diagnosis

242
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:11,100
100 correct that's what I've been saying

243
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,380
right you've read the books it's

244
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:15,779
supposed to shut you up

245
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:18,300
it's like shut up here's your here's

246
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:22,019
your label and shut up get out of here

247
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:25,080
now take this drug and get out of here

248
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:27,800
call us if you have another problem what

249
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,800
it didn't go away

250
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:35,459
if a cranial nerve is inflamed in any

251
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:37,680
way because listen to this because of

252
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:39,360
viral neurotoxins which none of the

253
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,760
doctors knew about unless they got

254
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,560
medical medium books then they know

255
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,700
about viral neurotoxins because you guys

256
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,220
that didn't exist there was no such

257
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:49,560
thing as a viral neurotoxin until the

258
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:51,000
medical medium books came out so when

259
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,579
you hear a functional doctor even

260
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,220
mention it now it duh where did it come

261
00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:58,920
from published material

262
00:10:55,220 --> 00:11:01,320
plagiarizing anyone chemical poisons and

263
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:04,200
toxins such as toxic heavy metals nobody

264
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:06,600
knew toxic heavy metals and get on and

265
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:09,060
inflame a cranial nerve nobody knew that

266
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:11,940
or even physical injury then symptoms

267
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:13,860
can occur your cranial nerves are also

268
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:15,959
affected by what's going on with your

269
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,760
neurons so what's going on with your

270
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:19,800

conditions when you deal with cranial

278
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:36,899
nerve problems

279
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:39,180
this is information I'm freely just

page for when you go to brain saver I

294
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:14,160
saw you can buy brain saver brain saver

295
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:17,339
protocols and cleanse the heel for 73

296
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:19,680

than 73 dollars to even like put one of

298
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:25,200
these books out print it and get it out

299
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:26,760
I just couldn't believe it

300
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,200
there's a lot of things I can't believe

301
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,180
these days

302
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,560
can't believe a lot of things

303
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:33,660
you know

304
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,700
can't believe how messed up the world is

305
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:38,220
how people don't have answers out there

306
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,360
how I just I can't believe a lot of

307
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:42,480
things

308
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:45,300
symptoms can occur from compromised

309
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:48,240
contaminated neurons so if you've got

310
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:51,779
some contaminated neurons symptoms can

311
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:54,120
occur you ready for this because the

312
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:57,959
brain is sending skewed altered or

313
00:12:54,120 --> 00:13:00,180
Twisted messages to the brain stem

314
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:02,100
and then to the cranial nerves if you

315
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:04,380
have a nerve problem a message is coming

316
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:06,839
out of here

317
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:09,000
and then out of your think about if you

318
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:10,800
have a nerve if you have a neuron issue

319
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,260
sorry you guys if you have a neuron

320
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:16,680
issue the message is going to get

321
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:19,380
twisted distorted and skewed as it

322
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:21,360
leaves the neuron goes right into the

323
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,860
brain stem and then out your cranial

324
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,260
nerves and that's why we're like short

325
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:27,779
circuiting we're like sick go into

326
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:30,779
another doctor sick

327
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:30,779
whoa

00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:36,380
Jess selane thank you Anthony

329

seriously

332
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:45,540
from the brain saver books love them

333
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,820
notice they also help with external

334
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:49,620
relationships amazing

335
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:51,600
the thing is with these brain shot

336
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:54,660
therapies Jess is that they're

337
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:57,060
miraculous it's information from above I

338
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:58,920
got warned by SOC that they're going to

339
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:01,079
do all kinds of things for people not

340
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:04,019
just what's directed in the book they

341
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:07,579
have that kind of power

342
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:07,579
to have that kind of power

343
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,860
viral nerve and brain stem inflammation

344
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:15,779
so we're talking about

345
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:17,459
brain stem inflammation

346
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:18,600
we're talking about cranial nerve

347
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:20,339
problems

348
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:23,339
so what does this mean

349
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:24,959
let's put it in a nutshell

350
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:27,420
ready

351
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:29,220

359
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:49,860
problems my ear hurts really bad I don't

whatever's going on

365
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:03,779
we're talking about viral nerve and

366
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:06,180
brain stem inflammation that's just a

367
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:08,399
fraction of the symptoms conditions if

368
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:10,139

00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,880
like

375
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,800
for real

376
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,959
most people with chronic illness don't

377
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,180
have physical injuries directly to their

378
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:29,880
cranial nerves that's true

379
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:32,160
not everybody got into a real serious

380
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:34,139
car accident their head went through a

381
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,300
windshield not everybody had that happen

382
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:38,760
most people with chronic illness don't

383
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:40,680
have any direct injuries to the cranial

384
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:43,920
nerves

385
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:46,440
but here's what they do have here's what

386
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,480
everybody's walking around with chronic

387
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,920
viral infections such as Epstein-Barr

388
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,100
virus that's the big one right there

389
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,720
right that that mm info put out there

390
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:56,820
shingles so many people walk around with

391
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,680
shingles

392
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:00,120
and then shingles there's all kinds of

393
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,440
crazy stuff you guys know because I'm

394
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:04,620
the one who put the information out of

395
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:07,260
what shingles does herpes simplex one

396
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:09,480
Herpes Simplex 2 was cold sore viruses

397
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:12,300
hit the cranial nerves every time

398
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:15,600
causing problems those cold sore viruses

399
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:18,660
hit the cranial nerves

400
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:22,079
Jackie B the brain saver books have

401
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:24,120
reawakened me to Healing that is

402
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:26,160
incredible I didn't realize how many

403
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:28,500
problems I had until I started to feel

404
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,420
better just a few weeks ago by doing the

405
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:33,300
brain shots

406
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:35,279
spread the wisdom around tell people you

407
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:37,380
have to see these books and try these

408
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:40,800
brain shots

409
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:42,420
you can put out a miracle

410
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,820
but yet

411
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:47,040
not a lot of people know about it yet

412
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:49,800
it's crazy

413
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,959
Isabelle Brown the Sleep restore shot is

414
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,759
amazing that's incredible I mean in time

415
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:55,680
people will finally get to these books

416
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,300
but like I said I was naive when I was

417
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,160
young and I always thought that once you

418
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:01,980
have this miraculous answer like these

419
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:04,439
books do you think the whole world is

420
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:06,780
gonna just do it if I saw the other day

421
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:10,020
someone was like yeah I'm in the vegan

422
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:12,720
I'm in the vegan movement and a bunch of

423
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:14,520
My Vegan friends we don't we don't need

424
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,699
medical medium

425
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:19,740
do you know when you get sick you will

426
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:21,780
when you get sick you will

427
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:23,459
when you go to 10 doctors you will need

428
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:26,120
medical medium books

429
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,120
you will

430
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:33,380
and the answers will be here for free go

431
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,380
to the library

432
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,440
you know what's going to be on my

433
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:42,299
gravestone my headstone

434
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:46,100
everything was for free go to the

435
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:46,100
library that'll be on my gravestone

436
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,820
but really you know

437
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,320
I don't know I just hope a rocket ship

438
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,360
lands and

439
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:59,640
I just cop on the rocket ship and take

440
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,539
off and never come back I'd rather do

441
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,940
that

442
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:04,620
all right let's go stop being silly here

443
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:06,720
Carolyn

444
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:08,940
I could not find any doctor nor a

445
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,520
neurologist that really understood the

446
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:14,640
vagus nerve they don't know much about

447
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:17,940
it they don't no matter how much

448
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:20,100
symptoms you have or details you give

449
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:23,160
them they just don't know what to do

450
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:25,080
about it correct they didn't years ago

451
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,160
when I taught about all this stuff they

452
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:29,100
don't now

453
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:32,460
and they're knocking in the future

454
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:33,960
and if anybody does squeak a peep in the

455
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:36,720
future it came from the medical medium

456
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:40,080
books it just did I'm not trying to act

457
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:42,179
like a jerk it just did it's a fact am I

458
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:45,559
not allowed to state that

459
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:45,559
that's where it came from

460
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,860
as you'll read more in detail soon this

461
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:52,080
viral inflammation can occur in the

462
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:53,520
brain stem so what what I mean there's

463
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,840
so much information here I'm just

464
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,360
fooling around as far as this little

465
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:59,220
part I'm talking about viral

466
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:02,039
inflammation right

467
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:07,700
the viruses getting into the brain get

468
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:07,700
the neurotoxins affecting the brain stem

469
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:12,660
neurotoxins affecting neurons and then

470
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:14,700
short-circuit messages come out of your

471
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:16,260
cranial nerves

472
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,760
herpes simplex one the cold sore

473
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:19,320
everybody has oh it's just a cold sore

474
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,000
yeah but it can give you a lot of

475
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:24,059
trouble all through the years if you

476
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:28,460
don't know how to work on healing it

477
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:28,460
the information's here to help us heal

478
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:34,160
Uma did you like that one the rocket

479
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:34,160
ship okay

480
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,679
when someone's cranial nerves have been

481
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:42,299
temporarily injured for example when

482
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:44,520
someone sustains a head injury so if

483
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:46,200
someone actually sustains a real head

484
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,240
injury

485
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,039
of any kind those cranial nerves won't

486
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,020
heal so easily if the person has a

487
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:53,940
chronic viral infection did you know

488
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:55,620
I've seen people and I've taught doctors

489
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:59,220
this I've seen people that get a mild

490
00:19:55,620 --> 00:20:01,620
concussion they go into their car

491
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:05,520
they open their car door

492
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:08,640
they go down to grab something

493
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:10,559
and then they lift their heads up and

494
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,360
they bang the back of their head right

495
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:16,799
on the car door jamb and they're like

496
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:20,100
crap oh my God it's just been my head on

497
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:22,380
the car door jamb and they got a mild

498
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:24,960
concussion

499
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:27,000
it should heal perfectly fine

500
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,160
but if they have low grade viral

501
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,280
problems chronic low-grade viral

502
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:34,860
problems it may not heal so fine so

503
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,820
check this out and nobody knows this out

504
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:38,880
there

505
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:41,220
every two lines is packed

506
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,080
when someone's cranial nerves have been

507
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:45,660
temporarily injured for example when

508
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:47,760
someone sustains a head injury of any

509
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:49,860
kind those cranial nerves won't heal so

510
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,500
easily if the person has a chronic viral

511
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:55,640
infection at the same time every line

512
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,640
has info here

513
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:01,320
I've seen this over and over again with

514
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:04,380
people if your viral load is up there

515
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:06,620
if you've got the viral load simplex one

516
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:10,380
Simplex 2 maybe Epstein-Barr

517
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:12,120
cytomegalovirus maybe hhv6 shingles all

518
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:14,820
the different rides whatever someone has

519
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:16,500
and you bang your head your head may

520
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:18,860
take more time to heal than somebody

521
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,860
else

522
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:24,059
injury to a cranial nerve causes tiny

523
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,280
fibrous root hairs to fray on the area

524
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:27,720
of the nerve that was injured if a

525
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,640
low-grade viral infection such as

526
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,440
epstein-bar shingles or herpes simplexes

527
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:33,000
occurring the virus can attach itself to

528
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,159
the cranial nerves that are frayed the

529
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,720
hairs that are afraid now that's way

530
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:38,400
ahead of research and science right

531
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,640
there we're talking they'll never go

532
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:44,520
there I mean 100 years maybe maybe even

533
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:47,340
longer or never tiny root hairs Fray

534
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:48,900
when we have injured cranial nerves so

535
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:51,120
then if you have a low-grade viral

536
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:53,340
infection like Epstein-Barr a virus can

537
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,860
literally cling onto a root hair that is

538
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:58,200
on the cranial nerve and hence we can

539
00:21:55,860 --> 00:22:01,820
have all these symptoms

540
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,820
man they'll never get there

541
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:06,720
the virus can station itself in the

542
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:09,059
injured part of the nerve and live there

543
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,460
like lice you don't you ever see lice

544
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:12,659
right did anybody ever have lice lice on

545
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:15,419
your hair

546
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:17,220
do you ever have that before

547
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:18,900
a friend of mine got lice and he's like

548
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:21,059
what should I do shave my whole head I'm

549
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:23,039
like no don't change your whole head we

550
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:25,260
can we can figure out how to get rid of

551
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:27,600
lice that's not a problem

552
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:29,100
friend of mine started shaving half

553
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,780
their head like I think I got to shave

554
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:33,299
my head and shaving half his head I said

555
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:35,700
that was stupid why would you do that

556
00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:38,159
over lice

557
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:40,380
there's a comet healing healing apps uh

558
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:43,380
I got inflamed cranial nerves and the

559
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:45,780
protocol in the new book has helped me a

560
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:48,000
lot already incredible

561
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:50,900
isn't it isn't it wonderful to know what

562
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,900
you have wrong

563
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:58,159
like if I ever got sick I want to know

564
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:58,159
what's wrong with me

565
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:02,640
if I ever get sick I want to know what's

566
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:04,860
wrong

567
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,720
of course sfc will tell me but the point

568
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:10,740
is that's me but say it was somebody

569
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:13,380
else if I ever got sick

570
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:15,360
I would want to know what was wrong

571
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:18,179

so much to talk about here let's just

588
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,720
pop in anywhere

589
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,880
untangling the Mysteries can we talk

590
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:02,340
about that for a second you guys one

591
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:04,140
reason why cranial nerve symptoms are so

592
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:06,659
mysterious and misleading to medical

593
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:08,760
research in science is that someone can

594
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:11,820
have a little bit of everything

595
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:14,000
and don't never know

596
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:14,000
foreign

597
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:20,159
a person could have contamination or

598
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,960
inflammation in a group of neurons in

599
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,179
the brain from a source such as toxic

600
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:28,400
heavy metals viral neurotoxins which are

601
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:32,039
toxins from viruses MSG scented candles

602
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:35,340

603
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:37,140

604
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:40,860
ranking on tattoos

605
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:44,100
every time I say the word tattoo people

606
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:45,659
want to kill me that's it I've noticed

607
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:47,700
out there it's the craziest thing I've

608
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:50,640
ever seen

609
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:51,720
I'm not ranking at on tattoos I'm just

610
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,159
saying

611
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:56,400
that

612
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:57,419
the metal in tattoos and there's no such

613
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,900
thing

614
00:24:57,419 --> 00:25:04,740
as vegan ink without metal the reason

615
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:07,200
why you can see the color of the tattoo

616
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:11,539
through the skin is because light is

617
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,539
hitting the metal and reflecting

618
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:16,799
it all has metal in it that's not what

619
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,059
I'm here to talk about today though I'm

620
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:21,000
just saying

621
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:22,860
that a person could have contamination

622
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,659
or inflammation from a group in a group

623
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:26,700
of neurons from all kinds of things have

624
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:29,279
toxic heavy metals

625
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:31,200
right from you know viral neurotoxes MSG

626
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:33,120
sent to candles fragrances air freshers

627
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,380
carpet clothing chemicals tattoos a

628
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,080
source of toxic heavy metal

629
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:38,640
contamination or caffeine injuries too

630
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:40,320
caffeine injuries that's another thing

631
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,740
people want to beat me to death about is

632
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,740
caffeine

633
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:46,679
at the same time they could have

634
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:48,659
inflammation in the lower middle or

635
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:49,980
upper brain stem caused by viral

636
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:52,380
neurotoxins

637
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:54,000
for other problems toxic heavy metals

638
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:55,679
and so forth the people can have a lot

639
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,279
of things they can have brain stem

640
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:03,000
issues and sorry some dust going in

641
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:05,220
there some brain stem issues and

642
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,200
they can have also other problems too

643
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:08,520
like toxic heavy metals and all kinds of

644
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,419
different contaminants and all kinds of

645
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,419
everything else in here

646
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,539
people can have more than one thing

647
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:17,760
wrong

648
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:20,220
everybody is different and I talk about

649
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:24,480
that in brain saver books

650
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:26,940
everybody is different

651
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,140
you can have one person you can have one

652
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,340
problem and this other problem another

653
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,720
person can have this other problem this

654
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:33,600
problem that's what these books are here

655
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:36,740
for to help you find out what's what and

656
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,740
what's whatever right

657
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:43,380
got a dry throat so I gotta drink a

658
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:45,120
little water

659
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:47,039
thing is before this I've been talking

660
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,320
all morning since about six o'clock this

661
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:52,860
morning so someone just needs to tell me

662
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:54,900
to shut up and be quiet and then

663
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:57,799
because literally I don't think I've

664
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,799
stopped yet today

665
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:04,559
all right

666
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,539
let's go into another little part here a

667
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:08,880
vagus nerve can be inflamed at the

668
00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:12,240
bottom in the abdomen

669
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:14,760
so your Vegas nerve can be inflamed down

670
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:17,279
here in the abdomen

671
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:19,740
one of the vagus nerves can be inflamed

672
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:22,100
down here in the abdomen think about

673
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:22,100
this

674
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:31,020
and in the middle in the chest and yet

675
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:32,580
be inflamed higher up at the brainstep

676
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:35,279
so here's the thing you can have

677
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:38,100
somebody can have inflammation of the

678
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:40,200
vagus nerves down low they can have

679
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:41,940
inflammation of the vagus nerves up in

680
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,260
the middle somewhere in the chest they

681
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:45,240
can have inflammation of the Vegas

682
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:46,980
nerves up in the brain stem think about

683
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:49,020
that and the doctor will never know

684
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:50,940
there's no MRI there's no brain scan

685
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:53,299
there's no nothing no one will ever ever

686
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,299
know

687
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:58,679
Lorraine L I didn't realize how

688
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:01,520
difficult my thoughts were until taking

689
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:04,080
the obsessive thought shifter less

690
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,760
catastrophic thinking

691
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,039
less ruminating

692
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,779
less focus on the past calmer more

693
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:11,700
peaceful that's incredible Lorraine and

694
00:28:09,779 --> 00:28:13,320
any piece you can get makes me really

695
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:16,080
happy

696
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:18,440

brain shot therapy cleanse challenge

705
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,880
I think I said brain shots a thousand

706
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:46,980
billion times

707
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:50,279
okay to answer that question

708
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:53,279
enough with the drama over here

709
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:54,539
it's in brain saver books it's a miracle

710
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:56,700

all right

727
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:41,940
someone could have more inflammation in

728
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,860
a particular region of the brain skewing

729
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:46,340
neuron messages to the brain stem and

730
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:46,340
nerves

731
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,820
which is really interesting too for

732
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:55,679
example someone could have more

733
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:58,320
inflammation in the left hemisphere of

734
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:00,299
the brain or the right hemisphere of the

735
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:03,120
brain or in the frontal lobe or

736
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:06,360
occipital lobe or temporal lobe or

737
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:09,260
Thalamus or cerebellum if inflammation

738
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:11,520
is in an endocrine gland

739
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:14,340
hypothalamus pineal gland pituitary

740
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:17,039
gland didn't that can put pressure on a

741
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:18,960
just adjacent brain tissue squeezing the

742
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:20,940
neurons in that neighboring brain tissue

743
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:24,240
and affecting the messages the neurons

744
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:26,159
sent to the brain stem and nerves

745
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,659
this is way too advanced for the Mayo

746
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,860
Clinic this is way too advanced for the

747
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,480
Cleveland Clinic this is way too

748
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,799
advanced for all of them if you ever

749
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,140
talk to those doctors because I've

750
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:35,399
talked to a bunch of them over the years

751
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:36,779
this stuff right here is so over their

752
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:38,880
head they just don't even know there's

753
00:30:36,779 --> 00:30:40,980
like well what's your symptom

754
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,440
um let's look at our cookbook here of

755
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:44,880
crap and see if we can give you way too

756
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,220
advanced for Harvard

757
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,059
way too advanced for Harvard Medical all

758
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:51,299
of this

759
00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:53,760
like if you like way too advanced

760
00:30:51,299 --> 00:30:56,220
all of this information is over the

761
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:58,260
heads of all the doctors in Harvard all

762
00:30:56,220 --> 00:31:00,720
of this like I'm not trying to just be a

763
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:02,399
pain I'm just saying it's a fact this

764
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,559
would blow their mind they wouldn't know

765
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:08,760
what to do with it it's way too advanced

766
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:08,760
they'd be like wait a minute what

767
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:16,820
symptoms of cranial nerve inflammation

768
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:21,299
yeah

769
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:23,760
oh wait here's a good line the precise

770
00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:25,860
locations of inflammation varies from

771
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:28,440
person to person and can even vary for

772
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:30,059
one person over time the majority of the

773
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:32,760
time it's inflammation that you can't

774
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:34,980
detect in a medical test

775
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:37,080
the location where inflammation is

776
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:39,000
occurring along specific cranial nerves

777
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:41,100
determines the type of symptoms someone

778
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,960
experiences such as tingles and numbness

779
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,700
aches and pain stiffness Burning

780
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,100
Sensations where in the body those

781
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:50,039
symptoms occur such as the tongue gums

782
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:51,840

head chest or stomach and what body

785
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,380
functions they affect such as swallowing

786
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:01,039
peristaltic action or the from the

787
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:04,320
intestinal tract

788
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:06,299
mysterious cranial nerve symptoms also

789
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,980
include blurred vision trouble focusing

790
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:09,539
the eyes and usual movement of the

791
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:10,980
eyeballs including difficulty with

792
00:32:09,539 --> 00:32:13,380

body buzzing humming pulsating

797
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:25,200
Sensations in the head burning hot

798

feeling with no fever how many times

799
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,100
have I talked to people who've had that

800
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,539
balance issues dizziness feelings of

801
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,760
electrical shock in the head where it's

802
00:32:30,539 --> 00:32:34,500
like

803
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,460
loss of the ability to swallow slurred

805
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:41,940
loss of hearing drooping face we know

806
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,679
that loss of movement of the face pain

807
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:46,559
in various areas of the face feeling

808
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:48,960
like they have a crooked jaw pulling

809
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:50,820
sensation on their face nose eyes or

810
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,140
forehead twitching that's erratic and

811
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:54,600
shifts all around their head and face

812
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:57,240
nausea teeth grinding teeth grinding

813
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:59,820
I'll say it twice tooth pain gum pain

814
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:02,760
difficulty chewing loss of smell loss of

815
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:04,500
taste and mystery twitches and itches or

816

rashes that don't go away with

817
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:08,760
scratching without rashes these and

818
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:11,580
other symptoms of cranial nerve

819
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:13,799
inflammation can either be caused by

820
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:15,779
inflammation somewhere along the cranial

821
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:17,700
nerve or by inflammation in the brain

822
00:33:15,779 --> 00:33:20,100
stem or cranial nerves are attached they

823
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:22,019
won't know this anywhere this is so

824
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:24,120
Advanced this book I can't even get out

825
00:33:22,019 --> 00:33:28,799
of cranial nerve inflammation chapter

826
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:30,720
chapter six I'm on page 100. Rina

827
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:32,760
I was like oh my God after seeing

828
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,100
stomach flipping in your book

829
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:36,960
just flipping right

830
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:39,299
who knows anything about that out there

831
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:41,880
thank you for finding it in here thought

832
00:33:39,299 --> 00:33:44,220
it was something only I have and you

833
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:47,220
said it is connected with the Vegas Turf

834
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:49,860
correct I also suffered

835
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:52,919
I also suffered two quite bad vertigos

836
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:54,539
in the past vagus nerve again so it

837
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:56,700
makes so much sense it is the vagus

838
00:33:54,539 --> 00:33:59,000
nerve correct Arena it's the vagus

839
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:02,360
nerves

840
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,360
negus nerves

841
00:34:06,179 --> 00:34:09,359
all right so there's a little paragraph

842
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,619
here called vagus nerve insights let's

843
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:13,580
talk about that a little bit there's so

844
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:13,580
much information here

845
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:19,320
what you'll hear called the vagus nerve

846
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,240
is not just one thick nerve that runs

847
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:23,580
from one end to the other in a perfect

848
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:26,040
line

849
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:28,200
check this out

850
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:31,320
the vagus nerves are a larger pair of

851
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:33,119
nerves plural

852
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:35,960
not singular

853
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,960
plural

854
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:40,139
they deserves are a larger pair of

855
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:43,440
nerves that leave the head region and

856
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:45,000
travel down to the Torso the vagus nerve

857
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,040
size

858
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,919
that's a word right there very

859
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:52,080
interesting the vagus nerves

860
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:54,119
size

861
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:56,580
and reach

862
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:58,740
make them more complex than shorter

863
00:34:56,580 --> 00:35:00,180
cranial nerves which is why they deserve

864
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:01,740
special attention here which is what

865
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:03,420
we're going to give them because we got

866
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:06,140
some killer stuff in here about the

867
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:06,140
vagus nerve

868
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:10,500
Cornelius says my GP told me that it's

869
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:12,540
impossible that I have so many different

870
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:15,060
symptoms so I stopped talking about my

871
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:18,300
symptoms to her I would just mention one

872
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:22,160
or two symptoms at a time

873
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:22,160
you can have a hundred symptoms

874
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:28,440
the reason for medical medium books and

875
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:30,119
information is to give people a way out

876
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,740
it's for people who have been there done

877
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:33,720
that tried everything they're seasoned

878
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:36,180
they know what's up that's why when you

879
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:38,700
get somebody that that sees one of these

880
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:40,020
free open classes and they come in and

881
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:42,240
they're just like

882
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:45,260
um I'm just looking for some apple cider

883
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:48,060
vinegar gummies and some collagen powder

884
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:50,280
and what's he talking about and it's

885
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:52,500
like you just

886
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:54,119
you know it's like the Matrix thing all

887
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:56,760
over again

888
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:58,320
this is really Advanced information for

889
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:00,300
people who have been there done that

890
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:02,400
they came from hell and back they fought

891
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:04,500
their way out they fought their way to

892
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,940
stay alive and survive all that crap

893
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:08,520
they went through no one knows what it's

894
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:10,260
like to be in their shoes mm info is for

895
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:13,560
really for the sick people who chronic

896
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:15,780
Leo who need the information

897
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:18,180
says I can't believe I'm still alive

898
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:20,880
with all the crap I have inside me and

899
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:23,940
what I've been exposed to the body is so

900
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:26,400
amazing it is amazing ensues

901
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:27,960
when you give your body the answers and

902
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,460
the things it needs and the resources

903
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:32,040
just so many incredible things can

904
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:34,760
happen the brain shot therapy therapies

905
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,760
alone right

906
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:41,000
so here's a section of the book called

907
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,000
the vagus nerve Grapevine

908
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:45,720
we think of the vagus nerve structure as

909
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:49,220
a grapevine

910
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:49,220
like the other cranial nerves

911
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,880
sorry we can think

912
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:58,440
we can think so I crack myself up when I

913
00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:00,599
read out loud because I'll miss a word

914
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:02,640
we can think of the Vegas therm

915
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:05,640
structure as a grapevine like the other

916
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:08,700
cranial nerves the vagus nerve Grapevine

917
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:12,839
is split in two as it leaves the brain

918
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:15,920
stem there's two vagus nerves coming out

919
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:15,920
of that brain stem

920
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:22,020
with those two main Vines branching off

921
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:23,760
on their own Pathways one vagus nerve

922
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:27,320
vine branch could be inflamed while the

923
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,320
other vagus nerve is not

924
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:34,079
this is a critical part of the human

925
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,839
design

926
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:38,940
however you believe we were designed

927
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:42,119
if you believe

928
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:44,220
we were a starfish

929
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:47,400
crawled out of the ocean

930
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:51,440
came a monkey and then a human fine

931
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:51,440
that's our design if you believe

932
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:58,859
God designed us

933
00:37:55,320 --> 00:38:00,660
fine if you believe

934
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:02,940
we were designed by alien technology

935
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:04,800
five if you believe

936
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:07,800
we were designed

937
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,900
by a meteorite just hit the planet and

938
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:11,820
we just kind of all just started to

939
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:13,440
develop whatever it is that you believe

940
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:15,480
right

941
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,940
we still were designed in such a way

942
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:20,460
that's just unbelievable absolutely

943
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:22,440
incredible

944
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:24,480
one Vegas third vine branch could be

945
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:26,400
inflamed where the other one may not be

946
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,599
inflamed this is the human design and

947
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,339
this is what's incredible about the

948
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:31,920
human design I'll tell you why because

949
00:38:29,339 --> 00:38:35,099
what that means is you got a chance

950
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:37,200
you got a chance this is a critical part

951
00:38:35,099 --> 00:38:39,900
of the human design that protects us it

952
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,700
protects us it means that if one of the

953
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:43,920
vagus nerves is completely inflamed or

954
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:46,920
damaged there may still be a chance of

955
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:50,160
survival while the other vagus nerve

956
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:51,780
shares its functions that means our

957
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:54,119
vagus nerves are talking to each other

958
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:55,619
baby and what they're doing is they're

959
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:58,440
trying to help each other two Vegas

960
00:38:55,619 --> 00:39:00,599
nerves for the price of one see

961
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:02,040
everybody has two biggest nerves for the

962
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:04,440
price of one

963
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:06,240
so the point is though if you have one

964
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:09,420
injured vagus nerve

965
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:12,240
you got a chance

966
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:14,940
because the other one that may not be as

967
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:18,060
injured is doing its thing it's doing

968
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:20,460
all its messaging and hard work and even

969
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:23,040
communicating with the damaged one the

970
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:26,119
injured one or infected one

971
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,119
how incredible

972
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:34,200
who even knew that

973
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:37,020
oh they didn't it's in here

974
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:39,300
and getting out of the world now

975
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:41,220
medical research and science haven't yet

976
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:43,440
discovered all aspects of the vagus

977
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:46,740
nerves that's to say the least there are

978
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:49,560
still new discoveries to be had

979
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:52,140
one future Discovery is vagus nerve

980
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:54,420
regeneration vnr

981
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:56,280
that is certain parts of the vagus

982
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:58,020
nerves can regenerate and regrow

983
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:00,920
themselves if the conditions are right

984
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,920
did you guys hear that

985
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:09,859
what

986
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:09,859
like I can't get out of this chapter

987
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:17,940
they haven't discovered this yet

988
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,320
it's a discovery they haven't discovered

989
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:21,660
yet

990
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:23,940
it's in the brain saver book

991
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:27,540
from Spirit of compassion

992
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:29,339
the prophecies in here are insane

993
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:30,839
when you think about how incredible this

994
00:40:29,339 --> 00:40:33,060
is

995
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:35,720
I mean that's a prophecy right there all

996
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:35,720
on its own

997
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:43,680
one future Discovery let's visit medical

998
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:45,420
research and science haven't yet

999
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,380
discovered all aspects of the vagus

1000
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:48,300
nerves

1001
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:49,619
there are still new discoveries to be

1002
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:51,060
had now remember sitting there at my

1003
00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:52,680
desk

1004
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:55,380
and spirit of compassion was giving me

1005
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:57,839
this piece of information and I I was

1006
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:59,700
just like what

1007
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:01,320
one future discovery that medical

1008
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:03,599
research and science haven't discovered

1009
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:06,180
yet keep that in mind is vagus nerve

1010
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:08,280
regeneration called vnr

1011
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:11,280
Spirit of fashion is even prophesizing

1012
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:14,700
and putting the the letters is V the

1013
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,700
acumen vnr

1014
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:19,380
what

1015
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:21,480
yes

1016
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:23,700
once you read these books you can't go

1017
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:25,200
back it's like a friend of mine picked

1018
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:27,540
up an old eat better book from another

1019
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:30,680
author in health you know like

1020
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:30,680
well-known author in health

1021
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:35,160
and

1022
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:36,780
he said it was like a joke after reading

1023
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:38,280
into the brain saver books and going

1024
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:40,079
back he said he couldn't believe it he

1025
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:42,540
just threw it out

1026
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:45,359
because he couldn't believe how remedial

1027
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:47,220
was how literally how advanced these are

1028
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:49,260
and helpful and what these have compare

1029
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:52,160
that but it's like with that the medical

1030
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:52,160
mean books in general

1031
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:59,579
one future Discovery is Vegas nerve

1032
00:41:55,560 --> 00:42:02,520
regeneration vnr that is certain parts

1033
00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:04,500
of the vagus nerves can regenerate and

1034
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,000
regrow themselves if the conditions are

1035
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:08,099
right medical research and science don't

1036
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,700
know this but this is a future Discovery

1037
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:10,700
down the road

1038
00:42:10,859 --> 00:42:15,960
this is a prophecy medical research and

1039
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:18,240
science will also discover that the

1040
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:20,960
anatomy of the vagus nerves is not

1041
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,960
definitive

1042
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:26,579
oh my God

1043
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:28,619
the vagus nerves are not designed the

1044
00:42:26,579 --> 00:42:30,480
same way in every person for example the

1045
00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:34,380
Vegas their branches don't completely

1046
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:36,480
connect in the Torso for everybody

1047
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:39,240
are you kidding me

1048
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:41,940
in some people the two Vine branches

1049
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:44,880
merely cross over and touch each other

1050
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:46,440
not actually connect is it just me that

1051
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,980
thinks this information is that

1052
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,980
incredible

1053
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:00,660
the vagus nerves also vary in length in

1054
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:02,640
each person the discovery is going to be

1055
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:04,380
forced upon the medical industry check

1056
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,020
this out you guys do too and I told you

1057
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:09,540
this the other day when I read this line

1058
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:11,819
due to robotic surgeries where robots

1059
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:13,560
programmed to perform surgery end up

1060
00:43:11,819 --> 00:43:15,839
injuring patients they're going to

1061
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:17,579
discover that everybody's vagus nerves

1062
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:19,859
are different because of robotic

1063
00:43:17,579 --> 00:43:23,520
injuries in surgeries

1064
00:43:19,859 --> 00:43:27,240
because you're gonna dial in Vegas nerve

1065
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:29,520
being just one way in women

1066
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:31,440
and men and what they're gonna do is

1067
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:33,180
someone's going to get a robotic surgery

1068
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:35,339
because they're already doing that and

1069
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:38,040
the knife on the robot and I'm not doing

1070
00:43:35,339 --> 00:43:40,020
the robot dance is gonna cut the

1071
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:41,760
machines the robot those kinds they're

1072
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:44,460
gonna go and it's gonna cut somebody's

1073
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:46,920
Vegas they're right in half

1074
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:49,440
and then science of research are going

1075
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:51,900
to have to realize that all vagus nerves

1076
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:54,900
aren't the same

1077
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:54,900
first

1078
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,660
the discovery is going to be forced upon

1079
00:43:59,099 --> 00:44:03,119
the medical industry due to robotic

1080
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:05,940
surgeries where robots programmed to

1081
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:08,640
perform surgery end up injuring patients

1082
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:10,619
vagus nerves because the calculations

1083
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,760
are so unpredictable from person to

1084
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:13,680
person but they're only going to learn

1085
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:16,760
that when they do the robotic surgeries

1086
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,760
that they're building now

1087
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:22,740
medical communities are going to start

1088
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:26,160
finding out that the vagus nerves length

1089
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:28,020
growth size and directions of travel are

1090
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:30,500
not as cookie cutter as previously

1091
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:30,500
assumed

1092
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:38,520
Echoes on and on and on the book's

1093
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:42,180
packed I'm reading out a brain saver 40

1094
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:42,180
off amazon.com

1095
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:47,520
right now us but just know this and be

1096
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:51,420
prepared

1097
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:52,800
there's answers not only in these books

1098
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:55,020
but

1099
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:57,060
it's an Awakening

1100
00:44:55,020 --> 00:45:00,300
and Beyond Awakening

1101
00:44:57,060 --> 00:45:04,940
there are Therapies in these books

1102
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:09,060
medical medium shock therapies are

1103
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:11,579
just incredible in these books

1104
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:14,099
brain shot therapy is incredible that's

1105
00:45:11,579 --> 00:45:16,380
a different therapy right there

1106
00:45:14,099 --> 00:45:20,240
Dana amazing information on Blown Away

1107
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:20,240
on YouTube thank you for being here

1108
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:25,260
the vagus nerves are made up of tiny

1109
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:26,760
strands and strings of nerve cells that

1110
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:28,980
run through the length of the nerves the

1111
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:30,359
vagus nerve is not just one solid nerve

1112
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:32,760
like medical research and science

1113
00:45:30,359 --> 00:45:34,380
believe

1114
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,520
but by the way you guys look out for

1115
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:38,760
imposters

1116
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:40,380
you guys on telegram there's like a

1117
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:42,839
bunch of imposters they're saying it's

you they'll private message you whatever

1123
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:56,280

00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:57,540
they'll just want to get a combo going

1125
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:00,720
with you and they're still say it's

1126
00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:02,520
Anthony William it's not it's not me

1127
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,420
on telegram I'm seeing a bunch of it

1128
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:05,760
lately

1129
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:07,740
and they'll say hey I do consultations

1130
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:11,160
no I don't do consultations so the

1131
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:13,800
imposters did they do all that

1132
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:15,420
just look out

1133
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:17,700
I don't want anybody to get hurt by an

1134
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:19,800
imposter

1135
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:21,780
because of the vagus nerve size and

1136
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:24,480
reach when inflammation occurs in the

1137
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:26,579
brain stem that affects the vagus nerve

1138
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,260
Grapevine the vagus nerve can exhibit a

1139
00:46:26,579 --> 00:46:29,640
wide range of symptoms and this is why

1140
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:33,300
people

1141
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:34,920
can have a hundred symptoms and the

1142
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:36,420
doctors just they don't even know what

1143
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:38,040
to do about they won't even believe you

1144
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:40,140
you can't have too many symptoms it's

1145
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:41,819
like you said earlier there's no way you

1146
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:43,859
can have that many symptoms no one can

1147
00:46:41,819 --> 00:46:45,420
have 100 symptoms or 50 symptoms or 30

1148
00:46:43,859 --> 00:46:48,300
symptoms there's no way it must be all

1149
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:51,300
in your head you're a hypochondriac

1150
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:53,220
really because of the size and the

1151
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:55,020
differences and the shapes of the vagus

1152
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:56,040
nerves people could have multiple

1153
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:59,839
symptoms

1154
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:59,839
and doctors not realize this

1155
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:03,380
