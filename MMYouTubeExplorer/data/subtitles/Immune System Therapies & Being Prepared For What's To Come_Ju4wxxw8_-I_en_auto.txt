[224.56 - 228.00] bit we're going to make a healing broth
[226.48 - 230.48] hi from france good to see you it's so
[228.00 - 233.52] great kimberly the papaya
[230.48 - 235.04] mono cleanse is really helping repair
[233.52 - 238.00] the damage
[235.04 - 239.36] charcoal caused my intestinal tract
[238.00 - 242.24] kimberly miller
[239.36 - 244.00] um thanks for um telling everybody and
[242.24 - 246.40] and telling us it's important because
[244.00 - 248.32] the charcoal can really do damage and so
[246.40 - 249.12] we're taught like do the charcoal do the
[248.32 - 251.28] charcoal
[249.12 - 252.56] internally right swallow the activated
[251.28 - 254.80] charcoal
[252.56 - 257.60] but people don't realize that it
[254.80 - 259.76] suffocates the lining of your gut
[257.60 - 261.84] so you don't get absorption so you don't
[259.76 - 263.36] absorb the things you need to absorb all
[261.84 - 267.28] the nutrients
[263.36 - 270.32] it it is so it's so evasive
[267.28 - 272.64] to the intestinal lining charcoal
[270.32 - 273.92] i've never recommended anybody to
[272.64 - 277.68] swallow charcoal
[273.92 - 280.88] never never never i've been consistent
[277.68 - 282.24] not contradicting through the years
[280.88 - 284.24] and you see that out there and i know
[282.24 - 284.72] you guys right you heard me say this
[284.24 - 286.32] before
[284.72 - 287.20] but it's like all the podcast doctors
[286.32 - 287.76] you should have seen what they were
[287.20 - 289.60] doing
[287.76 - 291.52] 10 years ago seeing what they're doing
[289.60 - 293.44] eight years ago six years ago it's like
[291.52 - 295.12] a countdown let's change it up again
[293.44 - 297.04] five years ago four years ago they
[295.12 - 298.56] changed their tune no one knows how to
[297.04 - 299.12] do anything no one knows how to fix
[298.56 - 300.88] anybody
[299.12 - 302.48] oh now we're down to three now they're
[300.88 - 303.92] down to two years ago and now all of a
[302.48 - 305.60] sudden they're picking up medical medium
[303.92 - 308.48] information left and right
[305.60 - 310.24] adding it to charcoal but you don't want
[308.48 - 310.96] to do the charcoal it's really really
[310.24 - 314.00] aggressive
[310.96 - 316.40] on the system keep that in mind
[314.00 - 317.68] so here's the thing we're coming to a
[316.40 - 319.76] place where
[317.68 - 321.84] there's going to be a lot of instigators
[319.76 - 322.16] death by a thousand cuts and one of the
[321.84 - 324.96] death
[322.16 - 326.48] by a thousand cuts you guys is the flu
[324.96 - 329.52] strains
[326.48 - 331.28] right the plague strains all the
[329.52 - 334.48] different flu strains
[331.28 - 336.72] okay so we're up against that and
[334.48 - 339.28] licking your hands after touching the
[336.72 - 341.92] toilet seat is not a way to make us
[339.28 - 342.56] ourselves stronger we don't become
[341.92 - 345.76] stronger
[342.56 - 348.32] by licking toilet seats okay we don't
[345.76 - 350.32] become stronger by licking toilet seats
[348.32 - 352.00] well hey you may as well just get more
[350.32 - 354.40] exposure yeah touch the door
[352.00 - 355.84] handles don't be afraid don't don't get
[354.40 - 358.08] ocd about it
[355.84 - 360.24] you can walk into a place and walk into
[358.08 - 362.48] a gas station just grab the handle
[360.24 - 364.08] sure no problem because you know oh let
[362.48 - 364.96] me grab a package that was just

[389.92 - 392.88] our kitchen counter
[390.96 - 394.00] there's grease on the bottom of all the
[392.88 - 396.24] packages there's
[394.00 - 398.56] all kinds of pathogens on packages right
[396.24 - 401.60] and it's not about being scared
[398.56 - 405.20] it's not about being afraid

[417.60 - 422.88] okay there should not
[420.72 - 424.32] technically be the flu it should not
[422.88 - 427.12] exist
[424.32 - 427.92] it would go through everybody and then
[427.12 - 432.64] completely
[427.92 - 436.72] die out if it wasn't brought back
[432.64 - 439.68] and released again into the world
[436.72 - 440.40] just so you know okay the flu virus
[439.68 - 443.44] would not
[440.40 - 446.00] exist it would just die out
[443.44 - 448.56] we would never have the flu again no one
[446.00 - 451.12] would be passing the flu around
[448.56 - 453.28] no one would be passing around any kind
[451.12 - 456.24] of flu variety
[453.28 - 457.76] plague flu variety around no one would
[456.24 - 460.00] be passing any of those around
[457.76 - 460.96] they would run their course and die
[460.00 - 463.04] that's all
[460.96 - 464.00] that's it the bug would run its course
[463.04 - 466.96] and die but
[464.00 - 467.36] every single year well flu's back it's
[466.96 - 469.76] back
[467.36 - 470.80] it's back it's back because it's being
[469.76 - 473.44] released
[470.80 - 475.84] being released out there released it's

[520.80 - 524.64] one of the ways to make your immune
[522.56 - 527.12] system strong
[524.64 - 529.36] is getting toxins out of the body or
[527.12 - 531.36] less exposure to toxins
[529.36 - 532.40] getting rid of the fragrances you guys
[531.36 - 534.00] on clubhouse

[591.52 - 598.72] right it's not you get stronger
[595.68 - 601.20] by getting exposed you get weaker and
[598.72 - 603.60] then the fungicides knock us down
[601.20 - 606.24] the sprays next door that the neighbor
[603.60 - 609.76] is spraying knock us down
[606.24 - 611.76] okay right and

[729.36 - 734.40] unprecedented you guys
[731.36 - 735.68] women already struggling with
[734.40 - 737.92] so many different conditions and
[735.68 - 741.68] symptoms worldwide
[737.92 - 744.88] it's it's unbelievable you know
[741.68 - 747.44] but let's teach women
[744.88 - 749.04] to put air fresheners in the car let's
[747.44 - 752.08] teach them that they have to constantly
[749.04 - 754.08] be smelling some kind of chemical
[752.08 - 755.44] that's that's the way it's rigged out
[754.08 - 757.20] there
[755.44 - 758.48] meanwhile what's happening whether you
[757.20 - 760.40] believe it or not
[758.48 - 761.52] you can just be like you know what he
[760.40 - 763.20] this isn't true
[761.52 - 765.28] i could breathe in my air fresheners all
[763.20 - 766.48] i want in my car that's not going to
[765.28 - 768.00] knock my immune system
[766.48 - 769.84] down go think what you want it's
[768.00 - 772.56] knocking your immune system down
[769.84 - 773.92] okay and immune systems already function
[772.56 - 777.44] they already fluctuate
[773.92 - 779.04] for women they're already fluctuating
[777.44 - 780.48] women have a reproductive system
[779.04 - 783.20] different than men
[780.48 - 784.56] so women's immune systems drop
[783.20 - 787.76] dramatically
[784.56 - 789.36] during menstruation ovulation being
[787.76 - 790.96] pregnant too
[789.36 - 794.80] the immune system is already dropping
[790.96 - 797.20] well it doesn't happen for men like that
[794.80 - 798.80] and so women alright are already
[797.20 - 801.76] struggling
[798.80 - 803.04] with immune system conditions symptoms
[801.76 - 805.84] or immune systems are
[803.04 - 807.52] already compromised because of the
[805.84 - 809.68] reproductive system
[807.52 - 811.28] but but how is that possible think about
[809.68 - 813.12] this okay think about this
[811.28 - 814.72] well anthony that's not how it works
[813.12 - 818.24] think about it if it's
[814.72 - 821.52] if it's natural if we're here on
[818.24 - 824.56] earth why would women be given this
[821.52 - 826.56] immune system drop during their
[824.56 - 827.68] menstruation during their cycle where 80
[826.56 - 829.36] percent of their immune system goes to
[827.68 - 829.68] the reproductive system only 20 percent
[829.36 - 831.76] of
[829.68 - 832.88] their immune system is left to protect
[831.76 - 835.76] them
[832.88 - 836.56] why is it that this thing this wouldn't
[835.76 - 839.84] happen
[836.56 - 841.20] right if you don't believe that god put
[839.84 - 842.72] us here
[841.20 - 844.32] if you don't believe that god put human
[842.72 - 847.76] beings that that
[844.32 - 849.52] life is here because of god or if you
[847.76 - 851.92] if you believe life is here because of
[849.52 - 854.56] god anthony
[851.92 - 856.64] god wouldn't do that why would god put
[854.56 - 858.00] us here on this earth and put women on
[856.64 - 859.20] this earth and have them have immune
[858.00 - 861.92] system problems when they have their
[859.20 - 863.84] cycle and ovulation and everything else
[861.92 - 865.12] or say you don't believe god put human
[863.84 - 867.52] beings here
[865.12 - 868.16] you know say you believe that we we came
[867.52 - 870.72] from
[868.16 - 872.56] uh we came from a little sea creature
[870.72 - 873.76] and we crawled out of the ocean as a
[872.56 - 876.00] little sea creature
[873.76 - 877.60] and we went and then another million
[876.00 - 878.40] years went by and we started trying to
[877.60 - 880.24] breathe
[878.40 - 881.92] out of the water another million years
[880.24 - 883.20] went by and we became like a badger and
[881.92 - 884.96] now we're a different creature
[883.20 - 886.80] another million years by we became a
[884.96 - 888.32] monkey right and now we're a gorilla
[886.80 - 890.16] right and now we're a human being say
[888.32 - 893.04] you believe in evolution
[890.16 - 895.76] right say you're somebody that believes
[893.04 - 895.76] in evolution
[896.96 - 901.04] why would we evolve in a way where
[899.04 - 904.00] women's immune systems would
[901.04 - 905.36] would tank during menstruation and
[904.00 - 907.20] ovulation where 40
[905.36 - 909.36] of their immune system goes down during
[907.20 - 911.76] ovulation
[909.36 - 912.48] you know or say you believe you don't
[911.76 - 915.04] believe in having
[912.48 - 916.32] evolution and you don't believe god put
[915.04 - 918.16] us here
[916.32 - 919.60] right and you believe an alien
[918.16 - 923.60] spacecraft
[919.60 - 925.52] okay bye and just put us all down here
[923.60 - 929.04] dropped us down here gave us some food
[925.52 - 929.04] supplies and said good luck
[929.28 - 933.60] they believe in that too okay whatever
[932.40 - 936.56] you believe in right
[933.60 - 939.20] say we say we got here that way why
[936.56 - 941.36] would that alien spacecraft
[939.20 - 942.40] say hey women haha this is a cruel joke
[941.36 - 944.16] their immune system
[942.40 - 946.16] the aliens are up there saying your
[944.16 - 947.44] immune systems are gonna drop
[946.16 - 949.36] 80 percent when they have their
[947.44 - 951.04] menstruation it's like hahaha this is a
[949.36 - 951.68] fun joke played on all those women down
[951.04 - 955.52] there
[951.68 - 959.28] watch how hard they have it
[955.52 - 962.88] say you believe in that either way
[959.28 - 966.48] here's how it works what we didn't have
[962.88 - 969.20] millions of years ago were pathogens
[966.48 - 969.60] that we have now what we didn't even
[969.20 - 972.08] have
[969.60 - 973.60] 300 years ago are pathogens that we have
[972.08 - 976.40] now what we didn't even have
[973.60 - 977.04] a hundred years ago you guys 150 years
[976.40 - 980.08] ago
[977.04 - 982.32] are pathogens we have now
[980.08 - 983.84] we got the epstein bars they've evolved
[982.32 - 984.72] those epson words you know what has
[983.84 - 988.00] evolved not
[984.72 - 991.04] us not us
[988.00 - 993.84] we didn't evolve no
[991.04 - 995.12] maybe spiritually maybe you evolved
[993.84 - 996.64] spiritually
[995.12 - 998.56] maybe you took a yolk course in a
[996.64 - 1000.24] spiritual class and you know
[998.56 - 1002.56] went up on a mountaintop with a few
[1000.24 - 1004.32] friends and camped out and
[1002.56 - 1006.00] talked about the stars maybe you evolved
[1004.32 - 1007.60] spiritually
[1006.00 - 1009.52] maybe you did meditations every single
[1007.60 - 1011.84] day you evolved spiritually
[1009.52 - 1012.96] maybe you had i always say we evolve
[1011.84 - 1016.32] spiritually
[1012.96 - 1017.76] when something hits us and we're like on
[1016.32 - 1020.24] our hands and knees
[1017.76 - 1021.60] praying to god you know i've seen people
[1020.24 - 1022.88] who don't they don't even believe in god
[1021.60 - 1024.48] never believed in god and then they got
[1022.88 - 1028.08] so sick they're down on their hands and
[1024.48 - 1032.16] knees and they're like praying to god
[1028.08 - 1033.60] it's like and whatever it is like maybe
[1032.16 - 1037.60] we evolved spiritually
[1033.60 - 1040.16] but we didn't evolve physically
[1037.60 - 1042.16] we didn't let let me tell you what
[1040.16 - 1044.80] evolved you guys
[1042.16 - 1047.60] all the crap you're up against that's
[1044.80 - 1047.60] what evolved
[1048.16 - 1052.64] yeah and you know what's funny about
[1050.48 - 1054.08] this conversation i know a lot of you
[1052.64 - 1056.08] guys say
[1054.08 - 1058.16] and i saw it in the comments you said
[1056.08 - 1061.28] how does he do it how does he cook
[1058.16 - 1062.80] how do you cook read comments and talk
[1061.28 - 1065.68] about
[1062.80 - 1067.12] this kind of stuff i got help spirit of
[1065.68 - 1068.56] compassion is talking to me now and

[1073.12 - 1077.92] let's put some mushrooms in here too but
[1078.88 - 1084.96] we didn't evolve physically
[1082.88 - 1086.80] but all the pathogens the epstein bars
[1084.96 - 1090.24] the shingles the cytomegalovirus right
[1086.80 - 1091.36] the hh v6 the hhv7 the hhv 10 through 16
[1090.24 - 1093.60] that's undiscovered
[1091.36 - 1095.28] all the different undiscovered varieties
[1093.60 - 1097.04] of epstein-barr right
[1095.28 - 1098.80] all the different undiscovered varieties
[1097.04 - 1102.08] of hpv
[1098.80 - 1105.68] right all the different bugs they
[1102.08 - 1110.40] evolved around us
[1105.68 - 1113.12] we stayed the same we stayed the same
[1110.40 - 1113.12] is what we did
[1114.96 - 1117.92] we stayed the same
[1119.68 - 1127.52] we might evolve spiritually
[1123.76 - 1129.44] we stayed the same christy g says i
[1127.52 - 1131.60] followed the celery juice two years ago
[1129.44 - 1134.64] and now
[1131.60 - 1136.80] i'm off levothyroxine thank you the
[1134.64 - 1139.20] doctor was shocked

[1214.00 - 1216.64] this is so important you should take
[1215.36 - 1219.44] notes
[1216.64 - 1221.68] seriously the most important one of
[1219.44 - 1223.92] these important notes is
[1221.68 - 1225.60] we didn't evolve physically we don't
[1223.92 - 1228.56] evolve physically here
[1225.60 - 1228.56] as time goes on
[1228.80 - 1232.48] but everything around us that wants to
[1230.88 - 1234.64] take us down
[1232.48 - 1235.84] evolves the chemical companies evolve
[1234.64 - 1240.24] how about that how about them
[1235.84 - 1243.28] apples you guys how about them apples
[1240.24 - 1245.84] chemical companies they evolve they make
[1243.28 - 1249.52] a new batch of crap every single day
[1245.84 - 1251.12] they got scientists right in their labs
[1249.52 - 1252.32] playing around with chemicals we're
[1251.12 - 1253.20] going to put this in this fabric
[1252.32 - 1254.80] softener
[1253.20 - 1256.48] who cares what it does to people's
[1254.80 - 1257.68] brains who cares what does their
[1256.48 - 1259.84] children
[1257.68 - 1261.36] let's as long as they feel nice and safe
[1259.84 - 1263.28] with their fabric softener and they like
[1261.36 - 1265.04] the smell
[1263.28 - 1267.52] then who cares what happens to their
[1265.04 - 1268.08] family the chemical companies they
[1267.52 - 1272.96] evolve
[1268.08 - 1276.00] right what else evolves
[1272.96 - 1278.16] okay not just the pesticide companies
[1276.00 - 1281.44] they evolve
[1278.16 - 1284.72] they'll come out with another 100
[1281.44 - 1286.80] brews of skull and crossbones
[1284.72 - 1288.24] skull and crossbones put some celery in
[1286.80 - 1290.64] this
[1288.24 - 1293.20] just put some onion in there it's going
[1290.64 - 1294.96] skull and crossbones
[1293.20 - 1297.60] that's what's on the pesticide
[1294.96 - 1297.60] containers
[1297.76 - 1303.04] herbicides herbicides are a big one
[1301.20 - 1307.20] right there those herbicides
[1303.04 - 1310.80] they evolve what else evolves
[1307.20 - 1314.40] right nanotechnology that evolves
[1310.80 - 1318.48] how about that right how about emf
[1314.40 - 1322.00] that evolves we don't evolve physically
[1318.48 - 1324.88] emf does okay
[1322.00 - 1326.32] that's what evolves right chemical
[1324.88 - 1327.92] company stuff evolves you know what else
[1326.32 - 1332.64] evolves
[1327.92 - 1335.52] gmo evolves gmo now they've got
[1332.64 - 1337.04] a thousand varieties of gmo corn in
[1335.52 - 1340.24] hawaii
[1337.04 - 1341.68] in hawaii you know
[1340.24 - 1343.92] a lot of my friends are like you need to

[1367.44 - 1370.72] like really really why don't you guys
[1369.44 - 1373.76] protest against
[1370.72 - 1377.20] the fact that they've taken over hawaii
[1373.76 - 1380.56] with gmo crops medical corn grain
[1377.20 - 1383.36] crops big pharma owns hawaii
[1380.56 - 1384.48] hawaii was sold to big pharma it was
[1383.36 - 1386.96] sold to big pharma
[1384.48 - 1389.36] they're just growing non-stop gmo crops
[1386.96 - 1390.72] it's gmo central
[1389.36 - 1392.00] it's like there's a watch it moved to
[1390.72 - 1393.36] hawaii it's so great what are you
[1392.00 - 1395.12] talking about the edge of the water it's
[1393.36 - 1396.72] so great by the ocean
[1395.12 - 1398.56] other than that they thought it's just
[1396.72 - 1402.32] gmo
[1398.56 - 1403.28] it because that's evolved so gmo evolves
[1402.32 - 1407.04] you guys
[1403.28 - 1408.48] clubhouse evolves and all this evolves
[1407.04 - 1410.08] you know what else evolves the tech
[1408.48 - 1412.96] companies
[1410.08 - 1414.80] they evolve now you're now your tech
[1412.96 - 1416.48] devices do this now your tech devices do
[1414.80 - 1417.60] that now they radiate more radiation now
[1416.48 - 1419.28] there's more radiation
[1417.60 - 1421.60] they evolve so we get all the radiation
[1419.28 - 1422.96] from our tech right
[1421.60 - 1424.32] i'm not trying to say we got to be
[1422.96 - 1425.68] afraid of our tech freight of the
[1424.32 - 1428.00] chemical companies afraid of this
[1425.68 - 1430.24] afraid of that afraid of gmo food if we
[1428.00 - 1430.96] get exposed we get exposed but what i'm
[1430.24 - 1432.48] saying
[1430.96 - 1434.08] is we got to keep our immune system
[1432.48 - 1435.52] strong we got to build our immune system
[1434.08 - 1438.16] we got to make it happen
[1435.52 - 1439.76] we got to take care of ourselves right
[1438.16 - 1442.48] it's important
[1439.76 - 1443.36] that's what i'm saying so i'm putting in
[1442.48 - 1445.52] some carrots
[1443.36 - 1447.28] i put in some celery right there i'm
[1445.52 - 1450.00] going to chop up some parsley right now

[1487.84 - 1491.84] what we have to do you know where we
[1489.92 - 1495.52] have to evolve
[1491.84 - 1498.72] we have to evolve in the fight

[1498.72 - 1503.28] protect your immune systems get it ready
[1500.56 - 1503.28] for battle
[1503.60 - 1508.00] that's what we have to do but you know
[1506.48 - 1509.68] what
[1508.00 - 1512.72] how does this stuff break down your
[1509.68 - 1515.12] immune system did you ever wonder
[1512.72 - 1516.00] or is it interesting to know now did you
[1515.12 - 1519.04] ever wonder
[1516.00 - 1520.88] how how does a chemical how does a
[1519.04 - 1521.52] fabric softener break down your immune
[1520.88 - 1523.52] system
[1521.52 - 1525.12] how does a perfume a clone break down
[1523.52 - 1529.44] your immune system because it's
[1525.12 - 1532.60] foreign chemicals untested
[1529.44 - 1535.52] no long-term testing serious
[1532.60 - 1538.40] ramifications
[1535.52 - 1543.36] never discovered because it's not been
[1538.40 - 1544.96] tested long enough
[1543.36 - 1546.96] put some garlic in here let's chop the
[1544.96 - 1549.68] garlic up
[1546.96 - 1550.72] how does it break down the immune system
[1549.68 - 1553.84] our body
[1550.72 - 1555.20] is allergic even if you don't react to
[1553.84 - 1557.76] all of these things
[1555.20 - 1558.48] and our white count knows it so our
[1557.76 - 1561.36] white count
[1558.48 - 1563.36] gobbles it up you want to keep your you
[1561.36 - 1566.48] want to keep your immune system busy
[1563.36 - 1568.40] right oh exposure's good for you you
[1566.48 - 1570.72] should get all that exposure it's so
[1568.40 - 1574.08] healthy for you makes you stronger what
[1570.72 - 1577.28] doesn't kill you makes you stronger
[1574.08 - 1577.28] what bs that is
[1579.20 - 1585.84] you know talking to a friend of mine
[1583.12 - 1585.84] and
[1587.44 - 1592.32] their uncle was in the gulf war
[1595.52 - 1602.40] and got exposed to a lot of stuff
[1599.36 - 1604.56] got injured did it make them stronger
[1602.40 - 1604.56] no
[1606.08 - 1609.68] when somebody strokes out from a
[1607.52 - 1610.72] medication does it make them stronger
[1609.68 - 1612.72] because i'm confused
[1610.72 - 1616.48] someone someone i'm scratching my head
[1612.72 - 1616.48] here i'm scratching my head

[1622.88 - 1627.20] from the pill

[1627.20 - 1633.04] clot from the pill um
[1630.00 - 1633.36] did it make them stronger no they've

[1713.28 - 1717.20] got the white blood count here let's
[1715.20 - 1720.32] just work on that one
[1717.20 - 1721.60] let's work with some chemicals okay
[1720.32 - 1724.88] let's work with some chemicals okay you
[1721.60 - 1730.00] guys so see what else here
[1724.88 - 1733.68] um now this works this works this works
[1730.00 - 1734.24] okay got some perfume got some clone you
[1733.68 - 1736.64] guys on
[1734.24 - 1738.24] on uh clubhouse i'm holding some holding
[1736.64 - 1742.48] a white blood cell in my hand right here
[1738.24 - 1745.04] okay you breathe in that perfume
[1742.48 - 1746.32] it's a toxic chemical guess who knows
[1745.04 - 1748.96] that
[1746.32 - 1749.84] you don't know that right nobody knew
[1748.96 - 1752.56] that perfume was
[1749.84 - 1753.68] a toxic chemical right about a barrage
[1752.56 - 1755.04] of toxic chemicals
[1753.68 - 1758.56] medical medium information was the first
[1755.04 - 1761.12] to come out um exposing that right
[1758.56 - 1762.72] but guess guess who knows about that
[1761.12 - 1763.20] toxic chemical your white blood count
[1762.72 - 1766.08] right there
[1763.20 - 1767.12] put a name on your white blood cells
[1766.08 - 1768.96] what do you want to name your white
[1767.12 - 1772.32] blood cell
[1768.96 - 1774.08] yeah and yeah well whatever
[1772.32 - 1777.04] whatever you want to name your white
[1774.08 - 1780.16] blood cell right
[1777.04 - 1781.68] your white blood cell is aware has an
[1780.16 - 1784.96] intelligence
[1781.68 - 1788.88] and knows that that perfume that cologne
[1784.96 - 1792.00] is highly toxic you breathe it in
[1788.88 - 1793.44] your white cat has to eat it has to eat
[1792.00 - 1797.68] it
[1793.44 - 1801.12] see that's how it works
[1797.68 - 1804.24] gobble it up every little
[1801.12 - 1806.88] particle that goes in you your white
[1804.24 - 1809.28] count has to gobble it up
[1806.88 - 1810.40] right you get exposed to toxic heavy
[1809.28 - 1813.52] metals
[1810.40 - 1818.08] your white count has to gobble it up
[1813.52 - 1818.08] right that's how it's done right
[1818.48 - 1826.80] and then it weakens your white count
[1821.60 - 1829.28] weakens your white count until it dies
[1826.80 - 1830.40] isn't it interesting you're still alive
[1829.28 - 1832.32] looking around you're
[1830.40 - 1834.32] doing your thing and your one count is
[1832.32 - 1837.84] dying poof one died
[1834.32 - 1840.48] that's it no boom another one died
[1837.84 - 1842.48] another one died okay over time it's
[1840.48 - 1843.20] okay my bone marrow can produce a whole
[1842.48 - 1845.36] ton of it
[1843.20 - 1847.12] oh oh my bone marrow can produce tons
[1845.36 - 1847.92] and tons of it keep on sending them out
[1847.12 - 1850.16] boom die
[1847.92 - 1851.76] boom die boom that one dies that one
[1850.16 - 1854.80] dies
[1851.76 - 1856.80] your white count gobbles these things up
[1854.80 - 1858.56] it gobbles all those poisons and toxins
[1856.80 - 1859.76] and all that stuff up the pesticides the
[1858.56 - 1862.56] herbicides
[1859.76 - 1864.48] the fungicides toxic heavy metals that

[2148.96 - 2153.36] and choose differently if we aren't
[2150.80 - 2155.76] aware of what is really going on
[2153.36 - 2157.12] we need to know how people are hurting
[2155.76 - 2161.28] us so we can have
[2157.12 - 2164.32] boundaries andrea wise words
[2161.28 - 2167.68] wise words so your
[2164.32 - 2169.68] white blood cells okay
[2167.68 - 2171.36] they're there gobbling up left and right
[2169.68 - 2173.52] everything we're exposed to
[2171.36 - 2175.12] that's how it works everything we're
[2173.52 - 2177.60] exposed to
[2175.12 - 2179.36] our white blood cells are gobbling it up
[2177.60 - 2181.36] and then the pathogens
[2179.36 - 2184.00] right so we already have enough going on
[2181.36 - 2186.40] in the pathogens we get exposed to
[2184.00 - 2188.24] right we get exposed to the flu we get
[2186.40 - 2190.24] exposed to the plague we get exposed to
[2188.24 - 2193.76] those types of flus hybridized blues
[2190.24 - 2195.52] we get exposed and
[2193.76 - 2197.84] when we get exposed it knocks us down
[2195.52 - 2200.32] another level so it's all this exposure
[2197.84 - 2202.00] so our white blood cells are really busy
[2200.32 - 2203.84] they're they're eating all this they're
[2202.00 - 2207.12] they're feeding on all this
[2203.84 - 2207.36] they're there eating it up but we lose
[2207.12 - 2210.16] our
[2207.36 - 2212.88] white count and when we lose our white
[2210.16 - 2216.32] count to all these exposures
[2212.88 - 2219.68] more is produced but there's a gap
[2216.32 - 2220.24] you guys there's a gap everybody seems
[2219.68 - 2222.00] to think
[2220.24 - 2223.36] you lose your white blood cells after
[2222.00 - 2225.04] they draw blood from you or something
[2223.36 - 2226.80] like that like i talk about medical mean
[2225.04 - 2228.32] podcast at apple podcast the blood draw
[2226.80 - 2229.28] episode you've got to listen to some day
[2228.32 - 2231.44] you guys
[2229.28 - 2233.20] people think that when you remove blood
[2231.44 - 2233.68] your bone marrow will just replenish it
[2233.20 - 2235.52] all your
[2233.68 - 2237.60] immune systems will be all back there
[2235.52 - 2238.24] nice and happy everything's back and all
[2237.60 - 2240.56] good
[2238.24 - 2242.48] no there's a gap in between and when we
[2240.56 - 2243.44] get our blood drawn that gap can run
[2242.48 - 2245.28] three to six weeks
[2243.44 - 2246.96] two to four months three to six months
[2245.28 - 2250.32] for a lot of different people
[2246.96 - 2251.20] and but even if we're up against poisons
[2250.32 - 2254.00] and toxins
[2251.20 - 2255.52] chemicals fabric softeners detergents
[2254.00 - 2256.00] chemical household cleaners with
[2255.52 - 2258.72] chemicals
[2256.00 - 2260.48] in them right conventional ones even
[2258.72 - 2261.76] natural ones some of them are really got
[2260.48 - 2264.40] toxic things in it
[2261.76 - 2265.84] so whatever we're up against not as much
[2264.40 - 2267.04] toxic of course but when we're up
[2265.84 - 2270.52] against these things
[2267.04 - 2274.40] our immune system's dying when it gets
[2270.52 - 2275.20] overloaded it when it gets overloaded it
[2274.40 - 2278.24] dies
[2275.20 - 2281.36] so the white blood cell gobbles another
[2278.24 - 2283.04] toxic substance and it dies
[2281.36 - 2285.12] it gobbles another another white blood
[2283.04 - 2286.80] cell gobbles another toxic substance
[2285.12 - 2288.32] another toxic substance until it's
[2286.80 - 2289.04] overloaded and it dies and then there's
[2288.32 - 2292.16] a gap
[2289.04 - 2293.60] our bone marrow doesn't keep track at
[2292.16 - 2297.28] those numbers
[2293.60 - 2299.92] it only keeps track when you're hit hard
[2297.28 - 2300.80] like slammed like your blood is drawn
[2299.92 - 2302.08] from you
[2300.80 - 2303.44] like getting your blood test at the
[2302.08 - 2305.52] doctor's office and they take too many
[2303.44 - 2307.04] vials four vials five vials six vials
[2305.52 - 2309.92] eight vials 14 vials
[2307.04 - 2310.32] that's when our bone marrow says whoa we
[2309.92 - 2312.72] just
[2310.32 - 2314.56] was something happened right there right
[2312.72 - 2316.32] but all the little stuff the chemical
[2314.56 - 2318.08] stuff falling out of the sky the toxic
[2316.32 - 2319.44] heavy metals were exposed to
[2318.08 - 2321.36] all the different little bugs were
[2319.44 - 2322.00] exposed to everything that your white
[2321.36 - 2324.88] town is
[2322.00 - 2326.72] eating up your your your bone arrow is
[2324.88 - 2327.92] not keeping track so easily of all that
[2326.72 - 2329.60] and there's these gaps
[2327.92 - 2331.20] and then we run around with this lowered
[2329.60 - 2333.28] immune system
[2331.20 - 2334.24] we run around with this immune system
[2333.28 - 2337.04] that's lower
[2334.24 - 2338.88] and then women women have a harder time
[2337.04 - 2341.84] their immune system's already
[2338.88 - 2343.92] fluctuating so much it's fluctuating
[2341.84 - 2347.04] during the cycles it's fluctuating
[2343.92 - 2348.56] during pregnancy it's fluctuating during
[2347.04 - 2351.04] ovulation
[2348.56 - 2352.72] and that fluctuation makes it so that
[2351.04 - 2354.24] we're up women are up against
[2352.72 - 2356.08] all these other chemical toxins and
[2354.24 - 2358.16] poisons they're up against these
[2356.08 - 2361.12] pathogens floating around
[2358.16 - 2363.12] and then they're hit harder this is why
[2361.12 - 2365.68] women are suffering with chronic illness
[2363.12 - 2368.00] more than ever before more than men and
[2365.68 - 2371.28] more than ever before in our history but
[2368.00 - 2373.20] the tide's going to change the tide's
[2371.28 - 2375.36] going to change
[2373.20 - 2378.00] you're going to see more men sicker than
[2375.36 - 2381.04] ever before in our history coming up
[2378.00 - 2384.48] and the next from now today
[2381.04 - 2387.60] to the next five years and this fall
[2384.48 - 2391.20] coming up after the summer
[2387.60 - 2392.48] okay we get towards the end of this year
[2391.20 - 2395.04] right when we're towards the end this
[2392.48 - 2396.08] year there's going to be a lot of
[2395.04 - 2397.52] problems
[2396.08 - 2399.20] there's going to be a lot of different
[2397.52 - 2400.24] flu bugs going around there's going to
[2399.20 - 2402.08] be a lot of different plate
[2400.24 - 2404.40] hybridization flu plugs
[2402.08 - 2405.76] bugs going around there's going to be a
[2404.40 - 2406.96] lot of that
[2405.76 - 2408.56] and there's also going to be weaker
[2406.96 - 2409.20] immune systems than we've ever had
[2408.56 - 2411.44] before
[2409.20 - 2413.52] by the end of this year and we're going
[2411.44 - 2415.84] to all have that too
[2413.52 - 2417.52] and then media is not going to cover it
[2415.84 - 2421.52] but people are going to be in sicker
[2417.52 - 2424.00] and sicker and sicker and sicker
[2421.52 - 2424.72] but we don't have to do that we don't
[2424.00 - 2426.64] have to
[2424.72 - 2427.84] be that way we can protect ourselves if
[2426.64 - 2429.36] we can learn how to do it i'm making
[2427.84 - 2431.28] medical medium heavy metal
[2429.36 - 2433.52] detox smoothies every day for myself i'm
[2431.28 - 2435.20] making a medical medium to celery juice
[2433.52 - 2436.40] i'm drinking every day for myself right
[2435.20 - 2438.80] what are you guys doing
[2436.40 - 2439.76] i'm doing the vitamin c shock therapy
[2438.80 - 2441.52] we're talking about the
[2439.76 - 2443.12] zinc shock therapy right i'll talk about
[2441.52 - 2446.08] that a little bit too and the vitamin c
[2443.12 - 2447.52] shock therapy doing the medical medium
[2446.08 - 2450.48] healing broth right now
[2447.52 - 2451.12] the thyme tea right ginger water i'm
[2450.48 - 2454.16] doing with
[2451.12 - 2456.80] these things are giving us a chance
[2454.16 - 2458.72] right these things give us a chance to
[2456.80 - 2461.44] keep our immune system strong
[2458.72 - 2463.92] so that the white blood cells don't die
[2461.44 - 2463.92] easy
[2464.84 - 2469.52] yeah when you give your white blood
[2467.84 - 2472.72] cells things
[2469.52 - 2475.28] they don't die as easy see
[2472.72 - 2475.92] isn't that incredible white blood cells
[2475.28 - 2477.92] are hungry
[2475.92 - 2479.44] they need fuel so they need trace
[2477.92 - 2482.40] mineral salts they need
[2479.44 - 2483.36] zinc your white blood cells need zinc
[2482.40 - 2484.96] right
[2483.36 - 2487.04] and when they when your white blood
[2484.96 - 2489.68] cells need vitamin c
[2487.04 - 2490.80] who's feeding their white blood cells
[2489.68 - 2493.20] enough
[2490.80 - 2494.00] to battle what we're up against the
[2493.20 - 2495.92] white blood cells
[2494.00 - 2498.96] need the healing minerals that are in
[2495.92 - 2501.68] the medical medium healing broth
[2498.96 - 2501.68] so important
[2503.28 - 2506.96] so elite maha says i was told that
[2505.84 - 2509.44] giving blood
[2506.96 - 2511.12] is healthy for us because it takes
[2509.44 - 2513.52] toxicity out
[2511.12 - 2515.28] look no disrespect seriously and i'm
[2513.52 - 2517.12] glad you're here okay
[2515.28 - 2518.40] i'm glad you're here elite my house i'm
[2517.12 - 2520.96] really glad okay
[2518.40 - 2522.96] because um that's a really good question
[2520.96 - 2525.92] it's not how it works
[2522.96 - 2528.00] because when we remove blood we remove a
[2525.92 - 2530.08] large part of our immune system and that
[2528.00 - 2532.56] part of our immune system is keeping us
[2530.08 - 2534.32] stable and so what happens is if you're
[2532.56 - 2535.76] somebody with cfs if you're somebody
[2534.32 - 2536.00] with fibromyalgia if you're somebody
[2535.76 - 2538.08] with
[2536.00 - 2539.44] anything sibo if you're somebody with
[2538.08 - 2542.80] plantar fasciitis
[2539.44 - 2545.04] eczema psoriasis lupus r a
[2542.80 - 2547.12] brain fog whatever you got going on
[2545.04 - 2547.68] headaches migraines burning skin tingles
[2547.12 - 2550.08] numbness
[2547.68 - 2551.60] ringing the ears whatever it is the more
[2550.08 - 2554.00] blood you remove
[2551.60 - 2556.56] okay the more all these things can get
[2554.00 - 2558.72] worse and they do get worse
[2556.56 - 2560.56] that's why people with lyme disease get
[2558.72 - 2563.52] bled to death
[2560.56 - 2565.84] that's why people with cancer get bled
[2563.52 - 2568.80] to death
[2565.84 - 2570.24] people with cancer get bled to death
[2568.80 - 2571.36] their immune system is taken out their
[2570.24 - 2572.96] immune system's taken out
[2571.36 - 2574.96] constantly with the blood draw and
[2572.96 - 2576.88] that's how it works and i talked about
[2574.96 - 2578.88] that many times right
[2576.88 - 2580.08] that's how it works you're getting the
[2578.88 - 2581.68] blood taken out you're getting the blood
[2580.08 - 2583.28] taken out and too much blood
[2581.68 - 2585.20] clubhouse i'm holding an arm in my hand
[2583.28 - 2588.40] right now i got a blood vial
[2585.20 - 2590.16] right in my other hand here and
[2588.40 - 2592.08] that's what's happening they take too
[2590.16 - 2594.56] much blood you got cancer
[2592.08 - 2596.40] they want blood every three days they
[2594.56 - 2598.48] want blood once a week
[2596.40 - 2600.16] but they don't just take a little bit of
[2598.48 - 2602.00] blood because that's all they need is a
[2600.16 - 2602.72] little touch of blood they take a lot of
[2602.00 - 2606.48] blood
[2602.72 - 2608.64] is what they do they take a large amount
[2606.48 - 2609.60] so much so a large amount that they
[2608.64 - 2612.64] don't need
[2609.60 - 2615.68] and that's how it works right and
[2612.64 - 2618.80] um and then so but
[2615.68 - 2620.80] you'll get told oh don't worry we'll
[2618.80 - 2624.00] just get the old blood out
[2620.80 - 2624.56] so new blood is created so now you're
[2624.00 - 2627.68] you've got
[2624.56 - 2629.76] healthy blood it's almost like that's
[2627.68 - 2631.20] the bloodletting technique that killed a
[2629.76 - 2634.64] lot of people that's the bloodletting
[2631.20 - 2637.28] technique from the 1600 to 1700 to 1500s
[2634.64 - 2639.20] you got sick they cut your vein they cut
[2637.28 - 2640.96] your arm when you got sick they cut you
[2639.20 - 2643.84] and they bled you
[2640.96 - 2645.60] right big pan of blood and if you
[2643.84 - 2649.36] survived that
[2645.60 - 2651.04] cut while you were sick it's a miracle
[2649.36 - 2653.04] so they did they basically just ended
[2651.04 - 2653.92] your life bloodletting was a way to kill
[2653.04 - 2655.84] people
[2653.92 - 2657.12] it was just your everybody knew when
[2655.84 - 2659.76] they were getting bloodletted
[2657.12 - 2662.00] they knew they were done you know why
[2659.76 - 2664.40] anybody sick back in that day
[2662.00 - 2666.24] didn't come back from bloodletting they
[2664.40 - 2667.68] didn't bounce back they didn't all of a
[2666.24 - 2669.36] sudden he'll be a miracle if they
[2667.68 - 2671.52] actually healed
[2669.36 - 2672.72] and they survived the bloodletting
[2671.52 - 2675.44] technique
[2672.72 - 2675.84] so you're being told the same old thing
[2675.44 - 2679.04] an
[2675.84 - 2681.12] old way of doing something
[2679.04 - 2682.16] that was basically devastating to
[2681.12 - 2684.64] families
[2682.16 - 2686.00] if a child got sick back in the the
[2684.64 - 2689.28] 1700s
[2686.00 - 2692.16] in 1800s if a child got sick they would
[2689.28 - 2695.52] bloodlet the child to death
[2692.16 - 2698.56] the untold sorrow and pain
[2695.52 - 2698.88] that has occurred from bloodletting but
[2698.56 - 2702.16] no
[2698.88 - 2704.08] hey let's just follow that same old lead
[2702.16 - 2705.68] let's just know the more blood donate
[2704.08 - 2706.08] blood the more blood that comes out of
[2705.68 - 2708.80] you
[2706.08 - 2710.40] hey fresh new blood will come back it's
[2708.80 - 2714.80] a bloodletting
[2710.40 - 2717.52] but here's the thing okay
[2714.80 - 2719.36] it takes an unbelievable amount of
[2717.52 - 2722.40] resources to rebuild
[2719.36 - 2724.32] your blood so it's not just about
[2722.40 - 2726.16] getting some water down
[2724.32 - 2727.28] hey drink a lot of water make sure you
[2726.16 - 2728.88] drink a lot of water you get all that
[2727.28 - 2729.76] blood taken out of you drink a lot of
[2728.88 - 2731.68] water
[2729.76 - 2733.60] uh your blood will be back to normal by
[2731.68 - 2735.52] that night no not at all you'll be
[2733.60 - 2738.08] filled with more water
[2735.52 - 2739.92] not blood eat eat a whole bunch of food
[2738.08 - 2741.44] that'll build up your blood fast that
[2739.92 - 2742.48] doesn't build up your blood fast your
[2741.44 - 2744.16] blood is still
[2742.48 - 2746.24] people who get who don't eat blood
[2744.16 - 2747.60] they're sick for months many people
[2746.24 - 2749.28] many people who donate blood it's the
[2747.60 - 2750.88] last time they ever donate blood
[2749.28 - 2752.80] because they couldn't even walk out of
[2750.88 - 2754.48] there and they were sick for months
[2752.80 - 2756.48] i'm not saying don't donate blood it's
[2754.48 - 2758.00] just that women are trained to donate
[2756.48 - 2759.36] blood guess who donates the blood it's
[2758.00 - 2761.84] the women
[2759.36 - 2763.12] and the sick women so that's who donates
[2761.84 - 2763.92] that's that's the blood donors out here
[2763.12 - 2765.44] did you guys know that
[2763.92 - 2767.04] out there in the world so listen to the
[2765.44 - 2768.80] blood uh the blood draw
[2767.04 - 2770.64] podcast medical mean podcast at apple

[2773.68 - 2777.20] can
[2774.96 - 2778.16] but so but that's another thing women
[2777.20 - 2781.52] are trained
[2778.16 - 2784.16] to be the blood givers on this planet
[2781.52 - 2784.96] right so here's what happens you walk
[2784.16 - 2788.00] into
[2784.96 - 2791.36] you hop on to a blood donating
[2788.00 - 2794.08] bus or you stand there at that bus
[2791.36 - 2794.56] and you interview everybody coming on
[2794.08 - 2796.48] okay
[2794.56 - 2798.32] it's gonna be all women occasionally
[2796.48 - 2802.16] this one guy
[2798.32 - 2804.16] all women yep and all sick women
[2802.16 - 2805.28] they all got thyroid problems they all
[2804.16 - 2806.96] got fibro
[2805.28 - 2808.64] they all got fatigued they all got brain
[2806.96 - 2809.28] fog they all got all these different
[2808.64 - 2810.88] symptoms
[2809.28 - 2812.64] and they're filing in dumping their
[2810.88 - 2815.68] blood giving their blood away
[2812.64 - 2817.52] to the blood machine the blood monster
[2815.68 - 2819.76] and that's what they're doing okay
[2817.52 - 2823.12] that's a whole problem all on its own
[2819.76 - 2824.96] no one's no one's like being held
[2823.12 - 2825.84] accountable for the mistakes made in all
[2824.96 - 2827.52] that
[2825.84 - 2829.76] the irony is you only need a little bit
[2827.52 - 2831.20] of blood that's the irony
[2829.76 - 2833.20] i don't know if you call an irony or you
[2831.20 - 2834.32] call it just the biggest screw-up on the
[2833.20 - 2836.24] planet
[2834.32 - 2838.48] you only need a little bit of blood
[2836.24 - 2840.16] right so
[2838.48 - 2841.60] and people people don't know that that
[2840.16 - 2845.04] you only need that much blood
[2841.60 - 2846.96] right there right there
[2845.04 - 2848.40] that's it you can get probably
[2846.96 - 2849.84] practically every test you ever dreamed
[2848.40 - 2852.32] of out of that right there
[2849.84 - 2852.96] okay you can get your dna figured out in
[2852.32 - 2854.72] one shot
[2852.96 - 2856.96] boom you can get your blood type figured
[2854.72 - 2859.20] out one shot boom your a1c boom in a
[2856.96 - 2861.20] a boom metabolic panel boom thyroid
[2859.20 - 2864.88] pound boom
[2861.20 - 2867.84] cbc boom all in that nutritional profile
[2864.88 - 2868.96] boom bam done traditional profile just
[2867.84 - 2872.00] in that right there
[2868.96 - 2873.52] but they drain us to death and it is
[2872.00 - 2875.36] it's like a slow death when you got lyme
[2873.52 - 2877.12] disease it's a slow death when you got
[2875.36 - 2878.16] bad case of lupus it's a slow death when
[2877.12 - 2879.84] you got something
[2878.16 - 2881.76] because they keep on pulling that blood
[2879.84 - 2885.28] out pulling that blood out
[2881.76 - 2888.32] and yeah we lose our immune system
[2885.28 - 2889.68] right there we lose our immune cells and
[2888.32 - 2891.28] one of the reasons why i'm even talking
[2889.68 - 2892.48] about this right now isn't just because
[2891.28 - 2895.28] elite maha
[2892.48 - 2896.80] you know brought this up but it's good
[2895.28 - 2898.48] to talk about this because this is one
[2896.80 - 2900.16] of the death by a thousand cuts this is
[2898.48 - 2902.40] one of the things we get exposed to we
[2900.16 - 2907.36] have to be really cautious about
[2902.40 - 2909.60] keep that in mind right there um
[2907.36 - 2914.56] yeah so i'm making a healing bra right
[2909.60 - 2916.16] now you guys
[2914.56 - 2918.08] glad to be on we're live on youtube live
[2916.16 - 2919.28] on facebook live and clubhouse live on
[2918.08 - 2921.36] tick tock good to see you guys
[2919.28 - 2924.24] incredible all right so talk about the
[2921.36 - 2927.44] zinc shock therapy let's do that
[2924.24 - 2929.04] zinc shock therapy is is is really an
[2927.44 - 2932.08] awesome medical medium tool
[2929.04 - 2933.68] okay and um
[2932.08 - 2936.56] because what happens with your white
[2933.68 - 2938.24] count is your white counts hungry for
[2936.56 - 2939.52] zinc because we're all zinc deficient i
[2938.24 - 2940.00] talked about this the other day we're
[2939.52 - 2942.56] all
[2940.00 - 2943.52] severely zinc deficient there's no zinc
[2942.56 - 2945.20] in our food
[2943.52 - 2946.80] okay if you're eating pumpkin seeds or
[2945.20 - 2947.60] oysters you're not going to get the sink
[2946.80 - 2950.48] you need
[2947.60 - 2951.04] i mean i hate to break that to you right
[2950.48 - 2952.64] because i
[2951.04 - 2954.96] i hear that all the time just eat some
[2952.64 - 2956.64] oysters are you kidding me
[2954.96 - 2958.32] you can eat all the oysters you want the
[2956.64 - 2959.84] only thing you can eventually get again
[2958.32 - 2961.28] is hepatitis
[2959.84 - 2962.80] which is basically a liver infection
[2961.28 - 2964.88] neptune bar liver infection but the
[2962.80 - 2966.56] reason why oysters will give you that
[2964.88 - 2968.16] some bad oysters will give you that is
[2966.56 - 2969.68] because they're so toxic they dropped
[2968.16 - 2971.44] your immune system flat
[2969.68 - 2974.88] boom they killed your immune system so
[2971.44 - 2976.88] that epstein-barr can take off
[2974.88 - 2979.28] that's how it works there so your white
[2976.88 - 2982.40] your white count loves zinc
[2979.28 - 2984.16] right and zinc shock therapy um
[2982.40 - 2986.16] is a great way of getting it you know
[2984.16 - 2987.20] what i've done with with family members
[2986.16 - 2988.72] and friends and
[2987.20 - 2991.36] you do what your doctor tells you guys
[2988.72 - 2993.36] you know i'm just showing you what i do
[2991.36 - 2994.72] nancy says how do we build our blood
[2993.36 - 2997.04] back up after
[2994.72 - 2999.04] they take too much nancy check out at
[2997.04 - 2999.92] medical meeting podcast at apple podcast

[3002.64 - 3007.12] it's packed with information right there
[3004.80 - 3008.24] yeah lorraine oysters is pretty funny
[3007.12 - 3009.76] and
[3008.24 - 3011.12] yeah and then people say well pumpkin
[3009.76 - 3012.00] seeds that's a great way to get sick
[3011.12 - 3013.84] we'll do our pumpkin
[3012.00 - 3015.36] seats it's like you need barrels of
[3013.84 - 3017.28] pumpkin seeds
[3015.36 - 3019.04] in order to get the zinc you need it's
[3017.28 - 3020.72] just that and it's not that zinc is
[3019.04 - 3022.16] it's not even pumpkin seeds or high in
[3020.72 - 3025.28] zinc it's just that they're they
[3022.16 - 3026.00] register enough in pumpkin seeds for
[3025.28 - 3028.00] them to actually
[3026.00 - 3029.12] say hey they're high in z they're not
[3028.00 - 3032.56] high in zinc
[3029.12 - 3035.20] there's no food high in zinc anymore
[3032.56 - 3035.68] zinc shock therapy works every time
[3035.20 - 3039.28] since
[3035.68 - 3040.48] three years so incredible amazing on

[3130.08 - 3135.28] am as american ergy dot com but
[3133.76 - 3136.80] so what i love about the zinc shock
[3135.28 - 3140.48] therapy really it's so easy
[3136.80 - 3140.48] it's like two dropper falls
[3140.96 - 3146.96] every three hours right every waking
[3145.04 - 3149.52] three hours so you wake up in the
[3146.96 - 3152.16] morning like i don't feel good
[3149.52 - 3153.84] or i was exposed to something or i think
[3152.16 - 3155.12] i'm coming down with something
[3153.84 - 3157.68] and i was talking about the other day
[3155.12 - 3161.04] how people eat when they're
[3157.68 - 3162.96] coming down with something they eat and
[3161.04 - 3164.24] they'll just tank they'll start tanking
[3162.96 - 3166.16] some pizza they'll start taking
[3164.24 - 3168.16] something else they'll start eating
[3166.16 - 3169.44] or they'll eat heavily or even if it's
[3168.16 - 3170.64] healthier food but they're going to just
[3169.44 - 3173.20] start eating
[3170.64 - 3173.76] and when people start coming down with
[3173.20 - 3176.56] something
[3173.76 - 3178.40] if their stomach doesn't go too sick
[3176.56 - 3180.32] when they're coming down with something
[3178.40 - 3182.56] they just start eating it's like this
[3180.32 - 3183.92] natural instinct of i need something i
[3182.56 - 3186.08] don't know what it is
[3183.92 - 3187.04] i know that my body's sick something's

[3442.08 - 3447.84] in your body i need the soup to finish
[3443.84 - 3447.84] so i could read comments
[3448.48 - 3453.52] maybe if i take the lid off let me take
[3451.84 - 3455.20] the lid off and see if i can get the
[3453.52 - 3458.24] steam to go a different area
[3455.20 - 3459.76] here we go okay
[3458.24 - 3461.44] it's like a smoke screen going across
[3459.76 - 3463.12] right now
[3461.44 - 3465.28] so what they do okay here's here's the
[3463.12 - 3467.20] first thing so they drain your blood
[3465.28 - 3468.32] that's what they'll do right with that
[3467.20 - 3470.56] condition
[3468.32 - 3471.36] but they don't know why someone even has
[3470.56 - 3473.68] it and
[3471.36 - 3474.64] then i talk to doctors many times about
[3473.68 - 3476.32] this condition
[3474.64 - 3478.48] and because it's it's always a mystery
[3476.32 - 3480.64] all these conditions are mysteries right
[3478.48 - 3481.92] but but that's a viral condition
[3480.64 - 3484.88] anything going
[3481.92 - 3486.00] wrong with blood is a hundred percent
[3484.88 - 3488.48] viral
[3486.00 - 3489.36] and epsilon bars are the real those are
[3488.48 - 3492.48] the real
[3489.36 - 3495.04] viral stir the pot bugs right there
[3492.48 - 3496.16] sometimes the hhv-6 and the hhv-7 will
[3495.04 - 3499.28] stir the pot too
[3496.16 - 3501.44] see an hhv-8 stir the pot i've seen
[3499.28 - 3503.92] hhv-9s through the pot i've seen these
[3501.44 - 3506.32] viruses the cytomegalovirus stir the pot
[3503.92 - 3508.72] but i've seen bar is the big one for
[3506.32 - 3511.20] anything blood related though
[3508.72 - 3512.80] anything blood related so well how do we
[3511.20 - 3513.68] work with that so what do we do you know
[3512.80 - 3515.28] what i mean so
[3513.68 - 3517.20] i would take the new addition to your
[3515.28 - 3520.32] doctor
[3517.20 - 3521.36] talk to him about epstein-barr or find a
[3520.32 - 3523.36] doctor
[3521.36 - 3524.88] that is open to understanding
[3523.36 - 3527.36] epstein-barr
[3524.88 - 3529.04] because once you do and you start
[3527.36 - 3531.04] working
[3529.04 - 3532.88] basically working helping your body
[3531.04 - 3534.88] battle the upsteam bar
[3532.88 - 3536.24] and start cleaning it up that condition
[3534.88 - 3537.60] starts to go back to normal
[3536.24 - 3539.36] where you start going back to normal
[3537.60 - 3541.12] i've seen it on and on and off over the
[3539.36 - 3543.68] years so many times
[3541.12 - 3544.88] you know happening so when people start
[3543.68 - 3548.88] doing the right thing
[3544.88 - 3548.88] they start getting better um
[3549.84 - 3553.12] okay you guys got the healing broth
[3551.36 - 3556.56] going do the vitamin c
[3553.12 - 3558.48] shock therapy let's do that
[3556.56 - 3560.48] um i'm gonna get the tea kettle going
[3558.48 - 3562.00] too so just give me a second you guys
[3560.48 - 3565.44] let me get the tea kettle going i'm
[3562.00 - 3565.44] gonna do some water over here
[3567.52 - 3573.84] so all this information is really really
[3570.88 - 3573.84] important
[3578.72 - 3582.40] let's get the tea kettle going a little
[3580.24 - 3582.40] bit
[3584.56 - 3588.64] lorraine says ebv for blood related
[3586.24 - 3589.36] makes sense it does it really does do
[3588.64 - 3590.72] the vitamin c
[3589.36 - 3592.80] shock therapy let's go into that a
[3590.72 - 3595.84] little bit we're live on youtube
[3592.80 - 3599.52] facebook clubhouse
[3595.84 - 3600.48] so you're welcome to use any vitamin c
[3599.52 - 3603.52] you want for this
[3600.48 - 3605.68] i mean i use the vimergy one
[3603.52 - 3607.04] it's so easy on the system there's a lot
[3605.68 - 3608.32] of vitamin c's out there they're like
[3607.04 - 3610.48] battery acid
[3608.32 - 3611.60] they're just they're hard to get down
[3610.48 - 3614.24] that ascorbic
[3611.60 - 3614.96] acid is really difficult on a lot of
[3614.24 - 3616.96] people
[3614.96 - 3618.56] right chris you seem fine to me good to
[3616.96 - 3621.92] see you you know it's that
[3618.56 - 3623.84] it's that ascorbic acid nature
[3621.92 - 3625.04] that type of vitamin c is really rough
[3623.84 - 3628.16] right
[3625.04 - 3629.76] but i like um
[3628.16 - 3632.32] but i like the vitamin c shock therapy
[3629.76 - 3634.08] with the micro c the vimergy micro c i'm
[3632.32 - 3637.28] not sponsored by this guys you guys
[3634.08 - 3638.80] so you know you guys know so
[3637.28 - 3641.68] back to the immune system let's talk a
[3638.80 - 3643.44] little bit more about how to build it
[3641.68 - 3645.36] you can't rebuild your immune system if
[3643.44 - 3647.60] you don't understand it
[3645.36 - 3649.28] right even if someone tells you oh
[3647.60 - 3650.48] vitamin c is good for your immune system
[3649.28 - 3652.56] it doesn't mean you're going to do it
[3650.48 - 3654.88] right or do it for the right time
[3652.56 - 3656.40] or do it right time period or understand
[3654.88 - 3659.20] it to keep it going
[3656.40 - 3659.92] no like there's there's so much to know
[3659.20 - 3661.52] okay
[3659.92 - 3662.72] you might be somebody's oh vitamin c is
[3661.52 - 3664.24] good for your immune system and then you
[3662.72 - 3666.48] get given this vitamin
[3664.24 - 3668.08] that has a little this multivitamin it
[3666.48 - 3669.60] has a little bit of vitamin c in there
[3668.08 - 3671.36] but it's worthless
[3669.60 - 3674.24] multivitamins are one of probably one of
[3671.36 - 3674.24] the most worthless
[3674.56 - 3679.44] worthless alternative medicine tools
[3677.92 - 3680.00] that are out there and i don't even know
[3679.44 - 3681.60] if i could
[3680.00 - 3683.76] call it even a tool because it shouldn't
[3681.60 - 3686.96] even gain that much respect
[3683.76 - 3689.04] it's it really falls short it's a money
[3686.96 - 3692.72] making scheme
[3689.04 - 3694.72] for the alternative therapy industries
[3692.72 - 3696.64] so that's important that's a that's
[3694.72 - 3697.92] worth the price of admission right here
[3696.64 - 3700.00] if you wondered why you're even here
[3697.92 - 3702.16] right now during this live watching me
[3700.00 - 3704.00] make a pot of soup peeling broth
[3702.16 - 3705.20] that that right there is just worth its
[3704.00 - 3707.04] price of admission
[3705.20 - 3708.48] even though this is free even though
[3707.04 - 3711.52] this is all free
[3708.48 - 3713.28] because the because what they do
[3711.52 - 3715.44] is it's really just to rip off those
[3713.28 - 3718.64] multivitamins are all
[3715.44 - 3721.44] bulk low grade stock
[3718.64 - 3723.76] from 10 years ago just so you know now
[3721.44 - 3725.28] you're going to look at the date
[3723.76 - 3727.12] you're going to look at the date on your
[3725.28 - 3729.28] multivitamin say well
[3727.12 - 3732.16] medical medium's wrong again always
[3729.28 - 3734.24] trying to catch medical medium catch him
[3732.16 - 3735.84] catch him while you can he never
[3734.24 - 3738.84] contradicts himself it's always hard to
[3735.84 - 3741.52] kick can't catch him ever
[3738.84 - 3743.76] and he's wrong because the date on this
[3741.52 - 3745.92] multivitamin is it's not due until
[3743.76 - 3747.84] it's not expired until next year so once
[3745.92 - 3751.12] again he's wrong
[3747.84 - 3753.12] no once again medical means right
[3751.12 - 3754.24] because this because they started the
[3753.12 - 3756.68] new date
[3754.24 - 3758.88] on the multivitamin when they
[3756.68 - 3761.52] encapsulated it
[3758.88 - 3764.00] when they actually encapsulated you guys
[3761.52 - 3767.28] john on clubhouse that's what happens
[3764.00 - 3771.04] okay they they start that date
[3767.28 - 3774.24] process when they put it in the capsule
[3771.04 - 3775.76] or the tablet john that's when they
[3774.24 - 3779.20] started
[3775.76 - 3783.04] just so you guys know that stuff
[3779.20 - 3786.56] has sat around for years sometimes
[3783.04 - 3788.88] 10 to 15 years
[3786.56 - 3791.84] just so you know and then when it
[3788.88 - 3793.84] finally goes into the vitamin
[3791.84 - 3794.96] you got your multivitamin and they use a
[3793.84 - 3796.80] speck of everything
[3794.96 - 3798.16] little speck of this and then you got
[3796.80 - 3799.84] these vitamins now
[3798.16 - 3802.00] and these powders out there and have a
[3799.84 - 3804.72] speck of everything a speck of nettle
[3802.00 - 3805.68] a speck of alfalfa a speck of some kind
[3804.72 - 3808.80] of protein
[3805.68 - 3811.68] a you know speck of choline a speck of
[3808.80 - 3813.68] lysine a speck of whatever and it
[3811.68 - 3817.36] doesn't do anything
[3813.68 - 3819.68] at all because it's not enough
[3817.36 - 3821.36] a speck of lemon balm because medical
[3819.68 - 3822.64] means talks about lemon bomb now you got
[3821.36 - 3824.40] a new supplement company around the
[3822.64 - 3826.72] corner every single day
[3824.40 - 3828.16] now speck of zinc because medical medium
[3826.72 - 3830.64] brought zinc into the world
[3828.16 - 3831.60] but pretty much not not entirely
[3830.64 - 3833.92] obviously
[3831.60 - 3835.76] but in the sense where it's it's on the
[3833.92 - 3837.52] scene for viral stuff because of medical
[3835.76 - 3838.88] medium information for 35 years it's
[3837.52 - 3840.88] like okay let's put a little
[3838.88 - 3842.00] little cat's claw in here a little this
[3840.88 - 3845.04] a little that
[3842.00 - 3847.04] and it's not enough and then we buy it
[3845.04 - 3848.72] but here's how it works the company is
[3847.04 - 3849.28] making all this money these companies
[3848.72 - 3851.60] out there
[3849.28 - 3852.80] are making all this money because they
[3851.60 - 3855.28] think and they'll put
[3852.80 - 3857.20] immune something on the bottle like good
[3855.28 - 3859.36] for your immune system or whatever
[3857.20 - 3861.04] right so hey i'm going to take this
[3859.36 - 3863.68] immune system supplement
[3861.04 - 3865.36] meanwhile there's so very little in that
[3863.68 - 3867.92] bottle of each thing
[3865.36 - 3870.16] that when it all adds up it's just one
[3867.92 - 3871.68] big filler in a way your body can't do
[3870.16 - 3874.16] anything with that there's two
[3871.68 - 3875.52] little bits of it and they're usually
[3874.16 - 3877.28] old
[3875.52 - 3878.56] so it's important to know right there so
[3877.28 - 3881.68] i'm making the vitamin c
[3878.56 - 3883.36] shock therapy right now putting some
[3881.68 - 3888.40] vitamin c in here
[3883.36 - 3888.40] okay i'm gonna get a spoon to mix it up
[3889.92 - 3898.08] do that two capsules
[3893.36 - 3901.76] every two hours every two waking hours
[3898.08 - 3905.12] every two waking hours two teaspoons of
[3901.76 - 3905.12] raw honey let's get that in here
[3906.84 - 3911.20] okay
[3908.32 - 3912.00] two teaspoons of raw honey get that
[3911.20 - 3915.44] going
[3912.00 - 3915.44] let's get an orange going too
[3917.76 - 3921.12] right chop it in orange right now
[3919.60 - 3922.00] squeeze an orange in here could squeeze
[3921.12 - 3924.32] a half i'm gonna
[3922.00 - 3926.88] squeeze the rest of this orange in here
[3924.32 - 3929.36] every two waking hours
[3926.88 - 3932.16] you think something's coming on you
[3929.36 - 3936.16] think you were exposed
[3932.16 - 3938.24] you know um
[3936.16 - 3940.16] i know somebody that works in a chemical
[3938.24 - 3943.68] factory
[3940.16 - 3943.68] they're in the warehouse department
[3945.20 - 3949.52] the chemicals stink so bad in the
[3947.36 - 3952.40] warehouse area
[3949.52 - 3954.24] and this person i know a friend of a
[3952.40 - 3957.12] doctor friend
[3954.24 - 3957.52] is doing this every night does it every
[3957.12 - 3959.92] night
[3957.52 - 3961.68] gets home from work does this every
[3959.92 - 3963.68] waking hour until bed
[3961.68 - 3966.64] in the morning does it again until it
[3963.68 - 3966.64] goes to work right
[3967.36 - 3973.84] because his immune system
[3970.88 - 3975.76] is getting eaten up by chemicals
[3973.84 - 3977.20] nanotechnology it's a whole other thing
[3975.76 - 3978.80] i mean that's chemical warfare right
[3977.20 - 3980.40] there it's sprayed on everything you buy
[3978.80 - 3982.88] now everything new we buy
[3980.40 - 3984.48] has nanotechnology sprayed on it right
[3982.88 - 3985.44] so many things have nanotechnology and
[3984.48 - 3988.08] then wood
[3985.44 - 3990.32] you buy a new piece of wood it's treated
[3988.08 - 3990.96] you all that green stuff is on the wood
[3990.32 - 3993.44] that's
[3990.96 - 3994.16] treated so wood that's treated right
[3993.44 - 3996.24] then of course
[3994.16 - 3998.56] termite spray termite spray is around
[3996.24 - 4000.96] all the buildings apartment buildings
[3998.56 - 4002.80] you know these are other exposures too
[4000.96 - 4005.12] all this stuff is exposures
[4002.80 - 4007.36] we're up against every day right put the
[4005.12 - 4010.64] orange in here put the raw honey
[4007.36 - 4010.64] two capsules vitamin c
[4011.52 - 4019.60] vitamin c shock therapy right there
[4015.36 - 4022.00] um yeah so great
[4019.60 - 4024.88] so great to have so this is coming along
[4022.00 - 4024.88] this is simmering
[4026.80 - 4030.00] let me get a
[4031.68 - 4040.24] something here
[4035.52 - 4040.24] just looking for
[4041.76 - 4048.24] got this right here you guys i'm going
[4043.28 - 4051.12] to move this around
[4048.24 - 4051.12] making the broth
[4052.80 - 4061.04] now if i was coming down with something
[4057.20 - 4063.04] me personally i'd be making this broth
[4061.04 - 4065.12] and i would be cautious to not dump a
[4063.04 - 4068.08] whole bunch of fat into my system
[4065.12 - 4069.36] i wouldn't do any avocado i like avocado
[4068.08 - 4071.84] i like avocado
[4069.36 - 4073.20] i have a little here and there i like it
[4071.84 - 4076.24] it's a healthy fat
[4073.20 - 4077.04] okay but if you're exposed you're coming
[4076.24 - 4079.04] down with something
[4077.04 - 4080.24] that fat will not protect your immune
[4079.04 - 4083.36] system
[4080.24 - 4085.12] it just doesn't do that okay so
[4083.36 - 4086.72] it's something to know same thing i'm
[4085.12 - 4088.48] not gonna eat a whole bunch of tahini if
[4086.72 - 4090.40] i was exposed to something
[4088.48 - 4092.32] so i'm exposed to some chemicals if i
[4090.40 - 4094.08] was exposed to some pathogens if i was
[4092.32 - 4095.84] exposed to something else
[4094.08 - 4097.36] i wouldn't be downing a whole bunch of
[4095.84 - 4099.12] nut butters and nuts
[4097.36 - 4100.80] i wouldn't be downing and i wouldn't be
[4099.12 - 4102.80] eating a steak
[4100.80 - 4104.80] i mean i don't eat steak anyway but you
[4102.80 - 4105.28] know and i support anybody who does eat
[4104.80 - 4107.20] you know
[4105.28 - 4108.64] if they do red meat i still support you
[4107.20 - 4109.84] i still can help you heal
[4108.64 - 4112.32] with the information that spirit of
[4109.84 - 4114.80] compassion has has given us
[4112.32 - 4116.24] but if if i was coming down with
[4114.80 - 4117.84] something i wouldn't down a steak i
[4116.24 - 4118.16] wouldn't down a piece of lamb i wouldn't
[4117.84 - 4120.64] down
[4118.16 - 4121.84] bacon i went down chicken i went down
[4120.64 - 4124.72] turkey
[4121.84 - 4125.76] i went down nuts and seeds nut butters
[4124.72 - 4127.44] and oils
[4125.76 - 4129.68] i wouldn't down any of that i wouldn't
[4127.44 - 4132.72] down fish i wouldn't have a big fish
[4129.68 - 4135.04] dinner i wouldn't have a lobster dinner
[4132.72 - 4136.64] if i was coming down with something so i
[4135.04 - 4137.60] wouldn't have well you know i wouldn't
[4136.64 - 4140.16] be doing butter
[4137.60 - 4140.72] and cheese and milk if i was coming down
[4140.16 - 4143.52] something
[4140.72 - 4144.96] like one way to get sick when you're
[4143.52 - 4146.96] exposed to something
[4144.96 - 4148.24] is down a whole bunch of cheese butter
[4146.96 - 4151.60] or milk that's
[4148.24 - 4155.04] or eggs right then you know
[4151.60 - 4157.04] a whole bunch of eggs right there right
[4155.04 - 4158.72] so let me make an omelet i feel sick i
[4157.04 - 4159.60] feel like or i feel like i was exposed
[4158.72 - 4161.12] to something
[4159.60 - 4162.88] let me just crack a whole bunch of eggs
[4161.12 - 4165.36] open and make an omelette right
[4162.88 - 4166.80] that's the last thing i would do right
[4165.36 - 4169.20] guess what people do
[4166.80 - 4170.24] and then you know people down pizza they
[4169.20 - 4172.00] down eggs
[4170.24 - 4173.36] even if it's like a healthy version they
[4172.00 - 4174.08] got vegetables on their pizza and the
[4173.36 - 4175.12] whole bit
[4174.08 - 4177.20] when they're getting sick or they're
[4175.12 - 4180.48] exposed they're eating all this food
[4177.20 - 4182.32] and what happens is this all that
[4180.48 - 4184.88] digestive strength
[4182.32 - 4187.60] your digestion all the strength it takes
[4184.88 - 4190.88] to digest food
[4187.60 - 4193.76] can lower your immune system all that
[4190.88 - 4195.28] digestive strength
[4193.76 - 4196.80] one of the greatest pieces of
[4195.28 - 4198.32] information i can give you is if you
[4196.80 - 4200.56] think you were exposed eat light that
[4198.32 - 4203.92] night
[4200.56 - 4205.28] let your immune system be just focused
[4203.92 - 4207.20] on what's floating around that
[4205.28 - 4210.80] bloodstream and keep the fats
[4207.20 - 4213.28] out or keep them low keep them low
[4210.80 - 4215.60] don't like don't have a big guacamole on
[4213.28 - 4217.20] that day you think you were exposed on
[4215.60 - 4220.00] that night you think you were exposed
[4217.20 - 4221.84] you guys don't have a big old guacamole
[4220.00 - 4223.28] because all that's going to do is fill
[4221.84 - 4224.56] your bloodstream up with fat and then
[4223.28 - 4226.56] your white count is going to be trying
[4224.56 - 4227.92] to navigate through that fat to look for
[4226.56 - 4229.20] any invaders
[4227.92 - 4232.08] so if you think you're exposed by
[4229.20 - 4234.16] pandemic stuff
[4232.08 - 4235.84] right you don't want to be tanking the
[4234.16 - 4236.24] fats you don't want to fat yourself to
[4235.84 - 4237.52] death
[4236.24 - 4238.88] because that's what everybody's doing
[4237.52 - 4239.92] they're being taught to fat themselves
[4238.88 - 4242.80] to death
[4239.92 - 4244.48] if you were exposed to a flu someone's
[4242.80 - 4246.64] got a sinus infection
[4244.48 - 4247.52] which could be streptococcus someone's
[4246.64 - 4249.44] got a stye
[4247.52 - 4251.92] which could be streptococcus you don't
[4249.44 - 4254.16] want to be
[4251.92 - 4255.20] you don't want to be filling your gullet
[4254.16 - 4256.64] with fat
[4255.20 - 4258.32] you don't want to be filling your goat
[4256.64 - 4261.44] with that no no no no
[4258.32 - 4264.72] no pizza guacamole uh
[4261.44 - 4267.84] tacos uh you know nachos um
[4264.72 - 4269.28] milk cheese butter eggs nut butters
[4267.84 - 4271.04] oatmeal with peanut butter on it you
[4269.28 - 4272.56] don't you don't want a grilled cheese
[4271.04 - 4273.76] sandwich grilled cheese sandwich you
[4272.56 - 4276.16] don't want to do that if you were
[4273.76 - 4277.92] exposed
[4276.16 - 4280.48] so important enough right there that
[4277.92 - 4284.00] that information alone is so
[4280.48 - 4285.20] is so critical so let's run by this if
[4284.00 - 4287.04] you guys just came on too
