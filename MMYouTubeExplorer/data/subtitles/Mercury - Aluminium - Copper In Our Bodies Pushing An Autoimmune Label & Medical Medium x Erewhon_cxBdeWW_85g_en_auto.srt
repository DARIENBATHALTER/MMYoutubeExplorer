88
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,760

been exposed to so many poisonous

93
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:53,360
substances and that's true never before

94
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,000
in our history have we been exposed like

95
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,760
this this includes the toxic heavy

96
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,400

nickel cadan arsenic

98
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:06,640
that's right and more air pollution such

99
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,360
as Chemtrails pharmaceutical narot

100
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,239
technology chemical sprayed on almost

101
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:12,840
everything manufactured pesticides

102
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,920
herbicides fungicides blah blah blah you

103
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,440
know the drill you know how many poisons

104
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:19,639
and toxins there are you guys know it's

105
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,120
serious it's real out there people are

106
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:24,000
getting exposed every single day and

107
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,320
metals get passed down from generation

108
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,199
to generation so I'm going to talk about

109
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,400
the Mercury man and a little bit more in

110
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,840
here too these poisons saturate our

111
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,240
water or reservoirs they find their way

112
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,560
in from the coffee you get at the coffee

113
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,120
shop they find their way in they fall

114
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,600
out of the sky the majority of these

115
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,000
substances are so new that it'll take

116
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,680
decades before science recognizes how

117
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,400
dangerous they are to our health that's

118
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,960
way when you hear people go glycate gate

119
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:55,280
or they go you know and they go from

120
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:57,199
alide from Malahide or they go you know

121
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,039
something else right and they think

122
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:02,240
they're onto the like the the the scary

123
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:03,400
chemical the scariest poison and they

124
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,400
think they're on to it and then it

125
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:08,560
becomes the buzz word whatever it is

126
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:11,560
there's way more than that and the

127
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:14,039
industry knows this and knows it and

128
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,720
they're like you guys worry about yeah

129
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:20,120
you worry about those yeah you guys keep

130
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,840
your eyes on that and the decoys you

131
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,479
know they're bad the decoys don't get me

132
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,639
wrong but you guys keep a little watch

133
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,000
on the

134
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:31,360
decoys and then the real scary stuff

135
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,880
nobody knows about they keep that stuff

136
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,360
top secret

137
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:39,680
classified seriously people have no idea

138
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,440
there's chemicals that are in things

139
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,240
that just AR you don't know because it's

140
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,800
in it and no one's talking about it and

141
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,560
no one's going to like look at that

142
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,800
chemical analiz it they don't even know

143
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,360
it exists because if you don't know it

144
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,039
exists you can't test for it then you

145
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:55,919
can't find it you see how it

146
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:58,039
works that's how it works they can take

147
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,000
new chemicals a whole batch of them but

148
00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:00,240
if they don't know what that new

149
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,880
chemical is

150
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:07,560
they can't find it test for it and find

151
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,960
it how crazy is that how crazy is that

152
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,680
it's only if they know what they're

153
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,479
looking for like the chemical was

154
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,319
registered the chemical was put out

155
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:19,800
there and if it was registered put out

156
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:22,080
there and then they took samples of it

157
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,240
and they brought it to the agencies and

158
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,720
everybody knew what that thing was and

159
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,479
they knew it and they can actually tag

160
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,240
it and understand it so then they can

161
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:30,759
look for it but that's the whole thing

162
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,960
you guys don't know there's all these

163
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:35,639
chemicals that research and Science and

164
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,560
all that environmentalists don't know

165
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:39,919
about nobody knows about but instead

166
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:43,360
they focus on DET

167
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:45,720
decoy chemicals to give them a detour

168
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,919
that's how it is and even the decoy ones

169
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,120
are bad but the point is is there's so

170
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:50,479
many other ones out there so I just

171
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,240
wanted to mention that because I haven't

172
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,400
mentioned that yet I don't think in a

173
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,800
long

174
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,879
time the majority of these substances

175
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,680
are so new that it'll take decades

176
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:02,800
before science recognizes them that's

177
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:05,560
the whole point you can't recognize them

178
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,120
until someone registers it they know

179
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,319
what it is it's got its patent number

180
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,199
rigged it's ready they get a test sample

181
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:14,240
they can say well who I've never seen

182
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,479
that let's actually Mark that one and

183
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,960
now we know we can look for it in the

184
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:18,639
water system we can look for it in

185
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,560
somebody's coffee we can look for it in

186
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,560
somebody's drug we can look for it

187
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,039
somewhere but you can't look for it if

188
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,479
you don't know where it is and what it

189
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:27,840
is you don't know what it is and can't

190
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:29,759
identify and that's how many thousands

191
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,800
of these chemicals are out there that's

192
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:35,400
how much exposure people

193
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:38,080
have I took my celery force

194
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:40,360
today and those risks will only be

195
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,240
discovered if funding in common sense go

196
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,919
in the right direction we know how that

197
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:49,159
works which is unlikely most Industries

198
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:50,759
M Mo their MO is to put chemicals into

199
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:52,680
our environment and deal with the

200
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:55,080
consequences down the road you put the

201
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,960
bad stuff out 50 years down the road

202
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:00,800
something gets discovered somehow

203
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:03,759
someway or talked about and then boom

204
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,479
most of us are carrying around toxins

205
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,199
that have been with us for almost their

206
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:09,319
whole lives and have burrowed deep

207
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,319
inside of us I just saw somebody it's

208
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:13,639
this one right here just so you know

209
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:17,199
it's medical medium New Edition right in

210
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:19,080
my hands Incredible Book it's saved so

211
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,800
many lives around the world so many

212
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:24,000
people people getting out of wheelchairs

213
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,599
because they got answers to why they

214
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,800
were suffering their pain and all of the

215
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:32,320
all the hell they've been through Chris

216
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,399
over there um I'm bringing my friend

217
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,519
that's a doctor and he drinks celery

218
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,279
juice now too thank you you just

219
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:40,560
reminded me to sip some of my celery

220
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:42,320
juice Amanda Stefani says I registered

221
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:46,000
just now I'm so excited whoa I can't

222
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:49,120
wait I'll see you there whoa mhm I'm

223
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,120
excited to see you there that's

224
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:56,959
amazing toxic heavy metals for example

225
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,440
can oxidize overtime and kill cells

226
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:01,279
around them so I want to give you guys a

227
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,320
little bit of that de

228
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:06,399
demonstration let's bring this out for a

229
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:08,720
minute let's look for some markers

230
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:11,839
really quick let's

231
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:16,399
go all

232
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:20,760
right so you got your brain

233
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:24,240
right okay got your brain right

234
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:26,760
here got a little bit of the midline

235
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:30,160
canal right there see the midline

236
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:34,399
canal little bit of art happening

237
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:36,800
okay all right and then you got your

238
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:40,000
Metals you got your metal deposits that

239
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:45,399
got in here from birth from both the

240
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:48,079
parents passed on down from exposures

241
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:50,800
antibiotics loaded with toxic heavy

242
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:53,560
metals of all kinds right so we got the

243
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,040
metal deposits right here okay let's

244
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:58,240
make a nice big metal deposit right

245
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,120
there let's get it to Glow a little bit

246
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,959
maybe we could use some paint maybe you

247
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,600
can see it maybe not there we go and

248
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,880
then let's do another deposit somewhere

249
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:09,120
else cuz I want to show you guys this is

250
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,120
a

251
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,000
brain yep that's a

252
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:19,040
brain all

253
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:22,640
right okay here's what happens okay over

254
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:27,440
time in everybody's head some faster

255
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:29,839
some slower in everybody's head over

256
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,360
time oxidation happen happens to the

257
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:35,120
toxic heavy metals Mercury aluminum

258
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:38,560
copper mainly those three and oxidation

259
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:42,480
occurs and when oxidation occurs

260
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:44,639
it leeches and that leeching comes out

261
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,680
of those deposits you see this right

262
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:50,120
here and there's a lot of things that

263
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:53,399
make the metals leech fast really really

264
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:55,519
high fat diet makes the metals leech

265
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:57,639
more okay that's just an example right

266
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,120
there and I I'll cover some other things

267
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:01,720
that make it leech more as well

268
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,160
adrenaline doesn't help that's for sure

269
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,440
and a lot of people are jacked up all

270
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,959
the time they're high on their caffeine

271
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,200
and everything else I'm not blaming

272
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:12,440
anybody or judging anybody so these

273
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,600
metal deposits right here are

274
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:18,240
leeching and guess what happens when

275
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:20,000
they leech when they leech we end up

276
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:24,160
getting

277
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:28,480
dementia over time we end up losing our

278
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:30,279
memory okay our memory we end up getting

279
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,440
episodes and

280
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:35,240
spells we get a lot of symptoms even if

281
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,480
it's not diagnosed as

282
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:40,920
dementia

283
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:42,920
okay so as these leech these metal

284
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:46,480
deposits right here some Mercury

285
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:48,720
leeching there's some aluminum oxidizing

286
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,480
there's some Alloys of mercury aluminum

287
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,920
and copper there's some copper oxidizing

288
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:58,240
right here okay you see this here

289
00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:01,040
right there we

290
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,000
go so it's leeching now here's what

291
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,440
happens when it leeches it leeches into

292
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
adjacent tissue when it starts to leech

293
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,680
into adjacent T tissue we start getting

294
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,880
in big trouble because then it's

295
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,120
spreading it's spreading into neuron to

296
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:16,680
neuron to neuron and that's what toxic

297
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:19,920
heavy metals do over time as we live our

298
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:22,279
life the metals move they oxidize and

299
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:25,240
they move and they start to spread and

300
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:28,279
as they're spreading right as they're

301
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:30,839
spreading they're leech they're leeching

302
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:33,880
they're oxidizing they're out gassing

303
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:36,360
that's what's happening they're out

304
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:38,480
gassing and we end up getting in trouble

305
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:41,800
so now tissue is actually being

306
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:44,240
destroyed brain cells gal cells neurons

307
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:46,600
are being affected metals are leeching

308
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:50,760
they're oxidizing and they're branching

309
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:55,079
over into gleo cells into other brain

310
00:12:50,760 --> 00:13:00,360
tissue exactly and into neurons when

311
00:12:55,079 --> 00:13:05,480
that happens our OCD heightens even our

312
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:08,360
PTSD heightens our bipolar heightens our

313
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:11,639
depersonalization heightens our anxiety

314
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:15,240
heightens our depression heightens those

315
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:18,639
are just some okay our schizophrenia

316
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:22,040
heightens yes everything our Neurosis

317
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:25,120
our psychosis anything else starts to

318
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:27,199
advance itself right and so that's an

319
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,639
example right there also other symptoms

320
00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:30,120
too we're going to go into autoimmune a

321
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,360
little bit all kinds of other stuff

322
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,320
around that how that works

323
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,920
Christine I've been drinking you're over

324
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,399
there on Facebook I've been drinking the

325
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:42,000
heavy metal detox smoothie for 3 years

326
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:45,880
every day it has been a game Cher as my

327
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:50,920
thinking is so much more clear that is

328
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:54,440
the most powerful metal remover there is

329
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:56,839
safely and effectively gently without

330
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:59,560
the side effects that's what that is

331
00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:01,720
from Spirit of compassion

332
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,560
that heavy metal detox smoothie is

333
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:06,759
saving lives around the world it has

334
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:08,720
been for a very very long time I'm so

335
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:11,560
glad you're using it the heavy metal

336
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,600
detox is powerful and you don't have to

337
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,880
have it in a smoothie just so you know

338
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,360
you can have it in a bowl you can have

339
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:20,600
it on your salad you can have it many

340
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,360
different ways as long as you're getting

341
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,920
three out of the five ingredients that

342
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:27,120
are key but try to do five because

343
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:29,079
that's the most powerful way of doing it

344
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,759
you can separate the ingredients through

345
00:14:29,079 --> 00:14:32,519
throughout the day and you can have the

346
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:34,040
five ingredients starting from the

347
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:36,360
beginning of the day all the way to the

348
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:38,480
end of the day you can do it that way

349
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,759
but that's the heavy metal detox it's

350
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,000
powerful it's lifechanging it's saving

351
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:44,839
lives out there so let's talk about

352
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,519
Metals a little bit longer and so glad

353
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:48,560
you mention that if you guys just got

354
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:51,360
here I made an announcement at the very

355
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:58,040
beginning it's real get ready I'm going

356
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:59,560
to be live June 15th in La at irwan with

357
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,480

detox movie that's going to be there

359
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:05,480

what we know how it works Metals get

631
00:27:02,399 --> 00:27:05,200
passed down from generation to

632
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:08,799
generation they sit inside of us in

is MM info I mean just going back like

635
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:17,120
even six years

636
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:19,320
ago six years ago podcast doctors

637
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,799
weren't talking about metals they were

638
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:23,320
talking about eating better processed

639
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:28,200
foods I don't know if you guys remember

640
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:29,320
but back in 2018 17 16 15 all you would

641
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,440

644
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:37,760
nobody knew that mercury caused anxiety

645
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,679
and depression nobody knew that copper

646
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,440

647
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,440
of different issues nobody knew that

648
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,320
ecem was caused by copper in the liver

649
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,200
all medical medium information and what

650
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:49,320
happened was the books got out and this

651
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,159
book right here millions of this book

656
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,240
they healed

657
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,640
and when they healed they spread the

658
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,760
word and guess what someone else got the

659
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:07,360

00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:24,399
tissue gleo cells neurons and they

732
00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:26,000
contaminate as they move the metals move

733
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:27,960
and they cause problems that's what

734
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,600
happens to people it's really difficult

735
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,720
and then guess what your symptoms crank

736
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,679
up everything cranks up it gets very

737
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:36,440
difficult gets very hard and that's what

738
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:38,480
people go through and that is not easy

739
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:40,200
not easy at all all right let's move a

740
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:43,919
little bit through the

741
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:46,240
information all right let's go Mercury

742
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:49,039
for close to 2 200 years wait got

743
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:52,880
another comment check this out on IG

744
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:56,960
Barry gvy girl cool handle the hmds has

745
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:59,240
helped relieve me of anxiety and panic

746
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,320
attacks

747
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:03,600
now I use it to protect me against the

748
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:06,720
fragrances I'm exposed to every day

749
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,960
that's acting as pathogenic fuel well

750
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:11,159
here's what happens when you know

751
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:15,760
information by the way um that's really

752
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:18,799
powerful okay really powerful so um

753
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:20,639
Julia check this out when you're using

754
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:22,840
metals like that in those when you're

755
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:24,399
using heavy metal detox smoothie like

756
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,960
that and metals are getting into your

757
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:28,760
system

758
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:31,880
from that exposure those fragrances and

759
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:34,159
so forth those fragrances become fresh

760
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:35,720
they become fresh in the bloodstream and

761
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:37,960
the heavy metal detox smoothie is doing

762
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:41,159
two things at that point it's removing

763
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:42,480
the fresh exposure the metals that come

764
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:44,760
with the fragrance fragrances and

765
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,440
everything it's removing the fresh

766
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:49,120
Metals out of the bloodstream so they

767
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:53,399
don't enter and stay and make homes

768
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:57,000
right you guys and then the other aspect

769
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:59,320
of the heavy metal detox is removing old

770
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,320
stuff old stuff passed down from

771
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:03,279
generation to generation to generation

772
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:05,799
and it's grabbing onto that and pulling

773
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:08,120
that out but it's doing two things it's

774
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:10,320
eating up exposure so that's what

775
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:14,159
happens so here's our brain right

776
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:17,200
here and then here's brand new exposure

777
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:19,799
okay so now you're somebody you're

778
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,840
exposed you're breathing in fragrances

779
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:24,840
and that exposure and that fragrance is

780
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:26,880
is just floating around okay that's a

781
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:28,919
good color for fragrances by the way

782
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,760
it's a very good color

783
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:34,720
all

784
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:37,320
right and then we're breathing in right

785
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:40,399
here those fragrances those fragrances

786
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:43,399
are entering in the sinus cavities the

787
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:45,639
bloodstream they're entering

788
00:33:43,399 --> 00:33:47,360
in and they're getting into the brain

789
00:33:45,639 --> 00:33:51,279
and body when you're doing the heavy

790
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:54,600
metal detox every day you're

791
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:57,960
absorbing and sucking all that up out of

792
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:59,880
the bloodstream new exposure and you're

793
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,720
getting rid of the new exposure because

794
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:03,960
here's what happens to everybody the new

795
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:06,799
exposure adds to the old

796
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:10,599
exposure so let's talk about

797
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:12,760
that the new exposure adds to the old

798
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:15,599
exposure any new exposure from

799
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:18,800
pesticides herbicides fungicides from

800
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:20,320
fire okay retardant from all kinds of

801
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,159
stuff that people are up against every

802
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,800
single day from formal theid to

803
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:27,000
chemicals that are pumping out of the

804
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:29,359
walls of houses and apartments to Lawns

805
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,280
being treated and sprayed to

806
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:34,320
insecticides falling out of the sky when

807
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:36,720
they do mosquito spraying all of it is

808
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,879
entering into our bodies because that's

809
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:41,040
life here on planet Earth we can't

810
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:42,720
change that planet Earth but that's

811
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,320
what's happening and as we're breathing

812
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:46,720
all that in it's going into our

813
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:48,200
bloodstream and if we're not being

814
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,919
proactive if we're not doing the heavy

815
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:53,200
metal detox and we're not taking care of

816
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:56,720
ourselves that enters into our organs

817
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:59,920
like the brain and then it joins in with

818
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:03,520
metal pre previously there metal finds

819
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:06,920
metal metal looks for Metal By the way

820
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:10,240
metal loves metal that's what it does

821
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:14,760
Pockets get bigger and bigger and bigger

822
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:18,440
they expand more more more more exposure

823
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:22,119
Comes In Pockets get bigger more

824
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:24,680
exposure Comes In Pockets get bigger

825
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:26,440
over time you don't know where you are

826
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:28,079
you don't know who you are there's a

827
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,920
rise of all kinds of things is happening

828
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:31,320
not just brain fog but a rise of like

829
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,560
memory loss and everything else where

830
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:34,079
people are having episodes they don't

831
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:36,040
even know people are walking down the

832
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:38,240
street their underwear now they have no

833
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:40,880
idea what they're doing that's happening

834
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:43,119
because of years of this expansion of

835
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,880
pockets getting bigger metals never

836
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:47,240
coming out nobody's doing the heavy

837
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,960
metal detox in that situation and

838
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:52,520
they're not getting the stuff out

839
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:54,960

indeed I agree for for close to 2500

850
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,319
years man tried to claim that mercury

851
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:29,599
was the Fountain of Youth did you guys

852
00:36:26,319 --> 00:36:32,079
know that Mercury was the Fountain of

853
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:34,319
Youth it was called the ultimate cure

854
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:36,000

855
00:36:34,319 --> 00:36:39,440

856
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,200
Mercury it's pretty crazy okay the

857
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:44,319
secret to living forever that was the

858
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:47,520
longevity secret it was Mercury did you

859
00:36:44,319 --> 00:36:51,760
know that and the source for Eternal

860
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:54,000
wisdom was Mercury oh yeah that's right

861
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:56,960
source for the Eternal wisdom in ancient

862
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,960
Chinese medicine Mercury was so revered

863
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:01,839
that countless Emperors died for mercury

864
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:03,680
Elixir that healers vowed would end all

865
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:06,720
their problems which I guess you could

866
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:08,520
say they did if you take a morbid view

867
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,960
of

868
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:13,720
things but they've been using mercury

869
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:16,319
worldwide everywhere Mercury wasn't only

870
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:20,319
favored medicine in East Asia all

1048
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:44,960
back all right okay I want to talk a

1049
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,640
little bit about Mercury for a couple

1050
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:52,240
more minutes because I know some people

1051
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:54,160
they love Mercury info love it okay all

1052
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:56,599
right the treatment was especially

1053
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:58,960
common method to force a miscarriage

1054
00:45:56,599 --> 00:46:01,960
Mercury to force a miscarriage and to

1055
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:03,800
treat what was labeled as female

1056
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:06,680
hysteria a lot of reasons for

1057
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:09,520
miscarriages every single day is mercury

1058
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:12,800
every single day women have storage bins

1059
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:15,119
of mercury storage bins of metals from

1060
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:18,040
generation to generation to generation

1061
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:21,079
and metals move can have one baby and

1062
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:24,640
then now you have a miscarriage because

1063
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:27,599
Metals move and they gravitate they

1064
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:30,599
actually move and spread

1065
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:33,599
okay the 19th century wasn't exactly the

1066
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:35,720
Stone Age it had been established that

1067
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:38,079
mercury was a dangerous toxin that

1068
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:40,160
destroyed life they didn't know really

1069
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:43,240
what it did besides it killed you if you

1070
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:45,440
had too much of it if you played with it

1071
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:47,640
and ate a big hunk of it for centuries

1072
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:50,119
already people had born witnessed to the

1073
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:52,720
millions who died from Mercury exposure

1074
00:46:50,119 --> 00:46:55,119
so why was it still favored still

1075
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:57,920
favored one factor was the great

1076
00:46:55,119 --> 00:47:03,280
industrial demon that sat behind Mercury

1077
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:07,800
did you hear that a great demon yes a

1078
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:09,839
great big demon that sat behind the

1079
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:12,280
Mercury

1080
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:15,880
industry that alone was enough for it to

1081
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:18,839
be pushed as the top cure all

1082
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:21,760
Trend there were interest groups pushing

1083
00:47:18,839 --> 00:47:24,599
it Forward interest groups that had evil

1084
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:27,160
and darkness behind them that would push

1085
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:30,119
Mercury and the use of mercury and push

1086
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:32,760
it into guess what

1087
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:35,400
Pharmaceuticals and push it into other

1088
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:37,119
things it's

1089
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:39,960
crazy

1090
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:42,040
yep the Mercury movement finally hit a

1091
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:45,960
speed bump in the mid

1092
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:48,359
1800s doctors had become more accessible

1093
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:50,160
than ever before in history to people

1094
00:47:48,359 --> 00:47:52,680
from all walks of life which seemed like

1095
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:54,640
a good thing yet in increasing numbers

1096
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:57,800
of people went to visit these new

1097
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:59,359
medical graduates Observers caught on

1098
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:01,680
that more and more of these patients

1099
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:05,079
were coming down with uncontrollable

1100
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:08,800
shaking fevers Madness rage body ticks

1101
00:48:05,079 --> 00:48:11,000
jerking gibberish talk gibberish talk it

1102
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:13,599
became obvious that a visit to the

1103
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:17,000
doctor could result in poisoning so in

1104
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:19,680
the 1800s it was figured out yeah it was

1105
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:22,520
figured out that mercury was causing so

1106
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:24,960
many problems in the Pharmaceuticals in

1107
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:27,280
the drugs in the Mercury Elixir Mercury

1108
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:28,960
was causing so much trouble back in that

1109
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:31,599
day in the

1110
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:33,960
1800s for example a wife and mother of

1111
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:37,000
five might have sent her husband to the

1112
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:39,079
doctor to help the husband with his gout

1113
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:42,200
upon arriving home her husband would be

1114
00:48:39,079 --> 00:48:44,520
delusional yelling out children's Rhymes

1115
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:46,680
as his eyes twitched after just one

1116
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:49,319
experience like this a family would say

1117
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:51,920
we have had enough following this

1118
00:48:49,319 --> 00:48:54,400
widespread realization there was a

1119
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:57,280
25-year ghost town period for medical

1120
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:58,400
businesses did you guys know that in the

1121
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:00,920
late

1122
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:03,119
1800s there was a

1123
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:05,880
25e

1124
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:09,799
absence of no one going to the medical

1125
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:14,319
doctors anymore 25 years a medical

1126
00:49:09,799 --> 00:49:17,440
doctor barely saw a patient in their

1127
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:19,880
tenure whatever you call

1128
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:21,799
it they knew that a visit to the doctor

1129
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:23,880
would lead into mercury poisoning

1130
00:49:21,799 --> 00:49:27,280
medical universities hit their all-time

1131
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:28,280
low funding and were broken by busted by

1132
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:31,760
the late

1133
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:35,119
1800s this is this is sick

1134
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:38,960
information right Michael Charles on

1135
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:41,799
YouTube right there CJ and heavy metal

1136
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:43,000
detox smoothie got me back on my feet

1137
00:49:41,799 --> 00:49:46,240
symptom

1138
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:48,680
free you're awesome bro you're awesome

1139
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:50,960
okay this was exactly the break that

1140
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:53,040
natural practitioners and healers needed

1141
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:55,400
to gain some credibility for the first

1142
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:57,839
brief time in history practically in

1143
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:59,920
modern history or early forms of Home

1144
00:49:57,839 --> 00:50:01,680
Homeopathy chiropractic treatment and

1145
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:05,119
other varieties of alternative medicine

1146
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:07,520
exploded in popularity by 1900 finally

1147
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:09,079
traditional doctors offices caught on

1148
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:12,559
and started advertising that they were

1149
00:50:09,079 --> 00:50:14,359
no longer carrying Quicksilver

1150
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:17,079
Quicks that's what they called it

1151
00:50:14,359 --> 00:50:19,240
Quicksilver liquid mercury drinks and

1152
00:50:17,079 --> 00:50:21,640
traditional medicine gained back some

1153
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:23,880
credibility because they dropped the

1154
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:26,880
Mercury so medical schools were starting

1155
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:28,760
to get students once more again in there

1156
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:30,160
and patients were starting to go back to

1157
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:33,319
doctors

1158
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:35,040
again finally traditional doctor offices

1159
00:50:33,319 --> 00:50:37,720
caught on and started advertising that

1160
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:40,640
they no longer offered Mercury Elixir

1161
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:42,319
anymore Mercury Quicksilver Elixir and

1162
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:45,319
traditional medicine gained back that

1163
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:48,839
credibility like I said yet the demon

1164
00:50:45,319 --> 00:50:52,480
behind mercury still wanted the

1165
00:50:48,839 --> 00:50:56,720
population to get plenty of exposure the

1166
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:59,920
demon behind mercury still wanted to use

1167
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:02,000
to get Mercury so inventive ways were

1168
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:05,200
created and figured out so you got

1169
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:07,319
mercury in you not only were Industries

1170
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:09,280
dumping mercury into every river lake

1171
00:51:07,319 --> 00:51:11,839
and Waterway possible but other forms of

1172
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:13,599
mercury containing medicine were born by

1173
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:16,040
the turn of the 20th century plus

1174
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:18,760
dentists were still using mercury malum

1175
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:21,079
fillings and that's just the start baby

1176
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:24,440

amazing because it's the dirty

1217
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:25,640
secret why am I going to tell you why am

1218
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:27,839
I going on like this about Mercury

1219
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:29,480
Mercury Mercury

1220
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:31,200
because it's the dirty secret we're not

1221
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:33,160
supposed to talk about and we have

1222
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:35,160
mercury in our brains and bodies from

1223
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:37,920
generations of ancestors who are exposed

1224
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:40,119
to it you're not supposed to know about

1225
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:43,280
what mercury has done to shape history

1226
00:53:40,119 --> 00:53:44,799
and you're certainly certainly not

1227
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:47,920
supposed to know what mercury has done

1228
00:53:44,799 --> 00:53:49,839
to you on any level right up to this

1229
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:53,160
present moment Mercury can be toxic even

1230
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:55,799
in tiny dosages you can't see you can't

1231
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:58,440
see it and there's no hazard sign saying

1232
00:53:55,799 --> 00:53:58,440
beware

1233
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:04,040
Mercury if it were up to the Mercury

1234
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,920
demon he would think Mercury was

1235
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:08,480
harmless even good for us better yet

1236
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:10,920
Mercury would be entirely

1237
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:13,079
hidden and we wouldn't even know it

1238
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:16,079
existed Mercury never goes away unless

1239
00:54:13,079 --> 00:54:20,839
you take specific steps to detoxify it

1240
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:23,599
and get it out Mercury casts an evil in

1241
00:54:20,839 --> 00:54:28,359
soulless shadow that has engulfed so

1242
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:28,359
many and destroyed so many lives

1243
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:35,319
this toxic heavy metal becomes a part of

1244
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:40,040
us and that reflects itself in our

1245
00:54:35,319 --> 00:54:42,440
health greed carelessness darkness and

1246
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:45,720
ignorance are the major factors that

1247
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:49,000
have allowed Mercury to prey on the

1248
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:52,000
population a Mercury mind owner of the

1249
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:55,000
past likely didn't care if workers only

1250
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:57,599
live 6 months to 3 years after starting

1251
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:01,839
at the mine the Mercury mine because

1252
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:05,119
there was money to be made money to be

1253
00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:07,480
had what good has mercury ever done none

1254
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:09,920
it's said nothing good for us absolutely

1255
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:12,480
nothing it's an unnecessary dangerous

1256
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:14,839
neurotoxin it could have been replaced

1257
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:18,760
in its medical and Industrial uses with

1258
00:55:14,839 --> 00:55:22,200
something safer but no and I'll tell you

1259
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:25,480
why because the Mercury demon for some

1260
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:26,880
reason has a grip on the hierarchy on

1261
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:29,319
this planet

1262
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:32,520
especially the hierarchy that loves

1263
00:55:29,319 --> 00:55:35,280
pharmaceutical world and that hierarchy

1264
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:37,799
wants Mercury sprinkled about in it it

1265
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:41,359
wants mercury in a

1266
00:55:37,799 --> 00:55:43,839
desperately sick World Lisa hi Anthony I
