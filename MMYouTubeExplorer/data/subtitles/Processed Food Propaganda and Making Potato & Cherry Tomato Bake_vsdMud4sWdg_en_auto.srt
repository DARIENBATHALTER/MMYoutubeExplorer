1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,399
all right so we're talking about a

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,960
couple things today we're talking about

3
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,200
processed food propaganda processed food

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,880
you're probably thinking oh he's going

5
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:11,000
to just be all angry about processed

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,200
food and fried greasy fast food

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,879
restaurants and how bad it is in the

8
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,560
United States and everywhere else or

9
00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:20,039
anywhere else and that's the reason for

10
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,880
chronic illness and disease no we're not

11
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,640
going to talk about that because that's

12
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:27,000
[ __ ] that's [ __ ] I'm not for

13
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,599
processed foods if you read medical

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,880
medium books I don't know if you can

15
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:33,200
even see them over there I talk about it

16
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,800
not being a great idea obviously

17
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,960
processed foods are not a great idea but

18
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,079
what's happening right now it's a

19
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,920
distraction it is a distraction that's

20
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,239
happening and occurring and influencers

21
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,120
and people in the health movement are

22
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,600
falling for it they're kind of they're

23
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,360
falling for that distraction forever

24
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,600
chemicals processed foods food chemicals

25
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,480
and they're they're falling for that

26
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,800
right because that's what the evildoers

27
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,760
want them to fall for that's the whole

28
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,280
point so now it's going to be all about

29
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,800
that right that's going to be the trend

30
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,400
but people don't realize I'm going to go

31
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:06,280
into great depth into

32
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:09,439
this but people don't realize what the

33
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:11,560
distraction is for is so nobody knows

34
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,759
the real reasons no one learns the real

35
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:16,759
reasons why people have chronic illness

36
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:18,439
people are sick they are suffering the

37
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:19,799
people that came to the medical medium

38
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:21,159
information and medical medium books

39
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,280
know this they've been there they've

40
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:26,360
done that you don't eat processed foods

41
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:29,280
right but I'm going to go into it a

42
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,600

00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,720
back pocket okay how's this tutorial

92
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:32,640
going right now now right so I'm going

93
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,000
to peel these a little bit

94
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,120
better um they'll just look better

95
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,200
they're better you don't want to keep

96
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,439
the the peels in

97
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,000
this cuz you get a different look you

98
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:44,959
get a different vibe it's not the best

99
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,319
most funnest thing so while I'm doing

100
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,640
this I want to talk about processed

101
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:52,000
foods for a little bit if you guys got a

102
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:54,560
minute and so right now what's happening

103
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,360
is we're taking a thousand steps back in

104
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:01,159
the health world right so we're back to

105
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,799
process foods again that's where we are

106
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:04,400
that's where the health food is that's

107
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,640
where the health world is going with

108
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,120
their health food it's all about

109
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:13,120
processed food so we're going back in

110
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:15,640
the dark ages of the health movement I

111
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,440
mean seriously that's where it's going

112
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:22,440
and fine Let It Go that direction right

113
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:23,919
I mean hey it happens it happens but

114
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,000
that's not the reason for chronic

115
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:30,360
illness I'm sorry but processed food is

116
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,680
not the reason for chronic illness

117
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,960
sure somebody can eat a processed food

118
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,919
diet they can go to fast food

119
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:41,479
restaurants they can eat a lot of these

120
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:43,720
right here a lot of these right there

121
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:45,720
double bacon cheeseburgers you know

122
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,280
what's going to happen over time they

123
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,600
arteries will slowly fill up with a

124
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,039
whole bunch of plaque and junk and

125
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,320
garbage over time depending everybody's

126
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:54,280
a little different the livers are going

127
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,360
to get a little bit of a fatty liver and

128
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,360
clogged up over time they're going to

129
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,960
get the pre-diabetes eventually to type

130
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,440
two diabetes is what they're going to

131
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,639
get and maybe some blood sugar

132
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,560
inabilities in general outside of uh

133
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:08,759
pre-diabetes and so forth and maybe some

134
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,400
other things will happen and maybe

135
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:12,039
eventually at some point if their

136
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,560
arteries get filled enough with a bunch

137
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:16,880
of junk and plaque they'll die of a

138
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,080
heart attack that is not chronic illness

139
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,800
that is

140
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:23,840
not it's very important to

141
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,360
know so Spence over there in IG says are

142
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,880
those potatoes steamed or uncooked right

143
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,880
now they are steamed potatoes I steam

144
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,360
them

145
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:36,440
prior and they are now going in here and

146
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:39,080
I'm going to mash them I'm going to make

147
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,400
this really fun dish right here and I'm

148
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:43,960
going to try not to make a mess but I

149
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,960
always do make a mess I just

150
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,080
do okay so let's go back into processed

151
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:54,319
foods if you guys are open to

152
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:56,240
this so yeah processed foods are not a

153
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:59,960
good thing I've talked about it in the

154
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,759
medical medium books okay

155
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:05,680
there's a lot of people unprocessed

156
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:07,160
fried greasy fast foods a lot of people

157
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,080

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,639
something going on with their pancreas

168
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,039

00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,960
alternative doctors but she's sick

184
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:13,440
because she's got this internal problem

185
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,120
nobody knows about but once again we get

186
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,039
these people that have loud mouths and

187
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,080
they they end up you know going around

188
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,479
they connect with other people in the

189
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,720
industry and they're like processed

190
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,800
foods processed foods let's save our

191
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,800
children let's save the planet process

192
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,400

make sure there's no high fructose corn

196
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:34,840
syrup in there anymore that's the real

197
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,280
problem that's why the whole world's

198
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:39,400
falling apart it's because of processed

199
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:41,960
foods which is [ __ ] it's

200
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,840
[ __ ] Jack Lynn over there Jackie

201
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,800

202
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,360
vloggers yep it's all about processed

203
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:51,720
foods and that is a setup that's a setup

204
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:54,560
by a higher Archy in the industry making

205
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:57,240
sure that everybody's talking processed

206
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,599
food [ __ ] that is a cover up is

207
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,720
what's happening in the industry I'm

208
00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:02,879
just letting you guys no it is you'll

209
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,000
see It'll come out down the road just

210
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,400
like all the other medical meme

211
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,560
information comes out down the road just

212
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,840
like the you know life expectancy was

213
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,960
dropping all this time just like medical

214
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,720
medium information published a long time

215
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,240
ago now down the road they're talking

216
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,360
about it it's going to happen just like

217
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,919
this with processed foods it is a

218
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,639
coverup for a bigger picture and people

219
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,960
are falling for it

220
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:27,919
everywhere and here's the funny thing

221
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:30,319
you can take processed foods away from

222
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,440
people and they'll still find them

223
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,440
somewhere if someone wants to eat a

224
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:38,839
processed food they're going to freaking

225
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:41,640
eat the processed food it's like alcohol

226
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:45,040
prohibition taking alcohol away taking

227
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:48,680

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,360
thousands of

231
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:58,120
Moonshiners making alcohol in the woods

232
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:01,200

processed foods they'll find a way to

241
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,440
make it and they'll find a way to eat

242
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:27,560

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,240
there there's one thing on planet Earth

266
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,920
is you're always going to get assistance

267
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,839
to hurt yourself and self-sabotage

268
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:33,480
yourself please understand that there's

269
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:36,880
always going to be a lot of assistance

270
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:40,200
the waiter is going to bring the tray of

271
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:42,720
shots and alcohol there's always going

272
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:45,440
to be assistance there's always going to

273
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,519
be a fast food restaurant I don't care

274
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,560
in Europe I don't care in the US I don't

275
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,079
care there's always going to be

276
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,440
somewhere where there's going to be

277
00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:54,160
someone's going to be able to eat

278
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,680
something that they probably shouldn't

279
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,160
be eating and it's always going to be

280
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,760
here on planet Earth so we can talk the

281
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,600
stupid [ __ ] game over over and over

282
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,160
again process foods process foods we can

283
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,800
do all that but we're missing the point

284
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,200
of what really causes chronic illness

285
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:10,279
and why people are really sick and why

286
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,040
you're 25 years old and you're bedridden

287
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:14,760
is it really from processed foods I'm

288
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:17,200
curious is it is that why a 25-year old

289
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,680
can't get out of bed and they're so sick

290
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,240
they got vertigo and dizziness and they

291
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:22,440
can't even function and put two words

292
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,519
together and they got herpes breaking

293
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,680
out everywhere and they're sick as a

294
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:28,240
goat is it because of processed foods

295
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,680
cuz I'm scratching my head here and I'm

296
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,880
kind of confused a little bit there

297
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:34,600
that's how ridiculous it really is all

298
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,920
of

299
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,440
it all right I'm going to get this dish

300
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:42,040
going I'm just probably going to go with

301
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:42,040
one more potato here I'm going to peel

302
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,720
back what's the answer to remove

303
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:53,360
processed food put everybody on clean

304
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:56,360

00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:02,600
and give them a really good mash um

363
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,320
um my cutting board sticks out a little

364
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,480
F further than the the counter so I have

365
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,759
to be careful if I put all my weight and

366
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,199
all my strength down on this I might

367
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:12,040
pull my cutting board down so I'm just

368
00:14:10,199 --> 00:14:14,160
going to break it up a little

369
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:16,880
bit

370
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:19,199
so there we go and I'm going to mash it

371
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:23,079
up okay carnivore let's hit it well

372
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:26,079
carnivore originally was a mono diet of

373
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:28,399
meat I they didn't actually even eat

374
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,920
eggs to start with right off the running

375
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,000
those came late

376
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:34,440
so it's really just carnivore diet was

377
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,880
just people being like just eat meat and

378
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,399
you'll be

379
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,320
fine I called the shots many years ago

380
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,079
that any carnivore expert is eventually

381
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,680
not going to be a carnivore diet expert

382
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,480
they're going to be a carnivore diet

383
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,800
idiot and I'm not saying that in a dis

384
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,399
you know a disrespectful way just in the

385
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,720
mere fact that they're just

386
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:52,759
experimenting on people who are

387
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,839
following them just eat meat and beat

388
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:57,160
only just eat chicken or chicken only or

389
00:14:54,839 --> 00:15:00,440
just eat meat maybe bring in eggs and

390
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:05,720
that's it what happens is

391
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:09,079
women don't do good on just meat chicken

392
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:11,360
and Eggs only they don't they don't do

393
00:15:09,079 --> 00:15:13,880
good their body systems will start

394
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,120
falling apart this isn't an anti- meat

395
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:19,040
talk uh I'm not against people eating

396
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:21,079
meat this isn't a vegan Channel but I'm

397
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:24,040
going to tell you right now it was

398
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:26,839
terrifying for women so it became more

399
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:30,040
of a guys thing just eat meat and work

400
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:31,639
out what happened where what happened

401
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,759
was guys were hitting the walls I

402
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,120
predicted it and there's a whole bunch

403
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:35,440
of guys that used to be carnivore where

404
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,360
they ate meat now they're not car now

405
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,440
they're eating fruit meat and fruit and

406
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,920
then they're talking stupid about

407
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,079
vegetables how vegetables are all bad

408
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,040
for you but then now they're eating

409
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,600
vegetables so really what happened was

410
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,399
all the carnivore people I don't know if

411
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,880
you guys know unless it's a newbie

412
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:52,000
that's starting on just meet all the

413
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,440
carnivore people all left carnivore so I

414
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,720
don't know what carnivore you're talking

415
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,040
about that's another thing you asked

416
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,800
what I thought about the carnivore diet

417
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:00,000
what carnivore diet they all left

418
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,920
carnivore they all brought honey in and

419
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,199
lemons they didn't have honey and lemons

420
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,279
in it before they all brought fruit in

421
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:08,480
there they didn't have fruit in the

422
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:10,360
carnivore Diet before they all brought

423
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,680
berries in they didn't have berries they

424
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:16,000
brought green apples in so now they're

425
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:18,519
kind of on the low sugar low glycemic

426
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,600
keto diet is what they're really on

427
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:23,519
Paleo diet is what they're really on

428
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:26,480
there are no carnivore diets anymore

429
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:28,319
they shape shifted it they started out

430
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,000
you know hey this is what you do you

431
00:16:28,319 --> 00:16:31,880
just eat meat and this is what you do

432
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,800
women copycatted and just the

433
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:35,600
reproductive systems just fell apart

434
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,720
their brains fell apart they hit the

435
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:41,199
wall they were gone that was it onto

436
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:42,399
something else or half dead and then the

437
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,680
guys that were actually doing the

438
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,440
carnivore diet and they were up in the

439
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,199
front running and social media making it

440
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,880
look interesting great they were trying

441
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,480
to stick with it stick with it finally

442
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,160
they knew that they couldn't lie much

443
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,880
longer to the crowd they were bringing

444
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,199
in Honey because their brain wouldn't

445
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:57,160
think they couldn't think at all they

446
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:59,279
had no their intelligence level their IQ

447
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,839
just dropped tremendously they were just

448
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,560
literally bumping into walls cuz they

449
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:04,679
had no gluc glucose to feed their

450
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,280
neurons and feed their brain electrical

451
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:07,880
activity went down because when you go

452
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,839
carnivore where you're just mono eating

453
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,880
meat your electrical activity just drops

454
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:16,799
and goes down and falls apart and your

455
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:19,799
short circuit so what happened was um so

456
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,799
what happened was

457
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:28,319
that the carnivore

458
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:29,799
movement turned in basically to a

459
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,799
bringing one thing at a time the

460
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:34,799
carnivore movement turned in to bring in

461
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:37,559
some honey the carnivore movement went

462
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:39,400
okay bring in some fruit now bring in

463
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:40,799
some lemons now and remember there's

464
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,679
glucose and lemons so they were trying

465
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:46,520
to get sugar they were dying for sugar

466
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:49,520
you need glucose or you're just bad you

467
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:52,320
have to have glucose or you can't

468
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,919
function and so the carnivore diet is no

469
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,720
more it doesn't even exist anymore

470
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,120
unless a new person comes on social

471
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:00,360
media and says this is what I'm doing

472
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:02,120
meat only Eggs only chicken only good

473
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:05,200
let's see what you do in 2 years you'll

474
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:07,039
be eating honey berries lemons and then

475
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,520
in newbie another guy will come into the

476
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,039
mix and be like okay I'm on the cardiv

477
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:12,640
war diet again doing it again be like

478
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:15,120
dude that's been done over and over and

479
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,760
over again and soon as you get popular

480
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,760
enough getting enough people just to eat

481
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:20,360
meat by itself you're screwed and you're

482
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:22,120
going to be doing nothing but honey

483
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,880
lemon and berries and you basically

484
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,799
you're just experimenting on yourself

485
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,880
and the people around you getting them

486
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:30,760
to experiment and then that's where you

487
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,760
are so that's the card of

488
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,559
D so I'm just going to mash this up a

489
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,559
little

490
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,679
bit sure you eat a whole bunch of these

491
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,720
every single day for years and you're a

492
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:50,600
baby boomer and now you're 65 years old

493
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,799
or whatever you are and you ate a ton of

494
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:55,000
these and a ton of hot dogs and a ton of

495
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:57,159
processed meat and a ton of garbage and

496
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,480
a ton of everything else and yeah your

497
00:18:57,159 --> 00:18:59,760
your veins are going to be filled up

498
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,120
your Aries are going to filled up your

499
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,240
heart valves are going to be filled up

500
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,919
probably going to need heart surgeries

501
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,280
and all kinds of other things you're

502
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,640
going to have the diabetes you're going

503
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,960
to have the weight gain and obesity and

504
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,240
you're going to be fighting it trying to

505
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,760
exercise and that's going to be your

506
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,159
life but that is not the reason for

507
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:15,320
chronic illness and it isn't why people

508
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:17,039
are sick and it's not why college

509
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:20,360
students can't function anymore they

510
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:22,640
have to be on Aderall how come right

511
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:25,880
processed food that's the reason all

512
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:28,159
right so I'm making um the potato and

513
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:30,960
cherry tomato bake right now so I'm

514
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:30,960
mashing this this

515
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:39,559
up and giving it a good mash and it

516
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,559
doesn't have to be perfectly mashed

517
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:45,200
but forgetting that I have to make a

518
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:45,200
recipe

519
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,960
here there you

520
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:59,600
go when you go carnivore you may get

521
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:01,240
results off the bat reason why you get

522
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,320
results is cu you're mono

523
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:05,760
eating not just mono eating you're

524
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:07,280
getting rid of the gluten doesn't mean

525
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:10,440
it's a panace and it doesn't mean it's

526
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,640
an answer to heal chronic illness you

527
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,840
can take somebody they never had a

528
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,600
problem yet they're 25 years old they're

529
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:20,559
exercising and they go completely

530
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:22,880
carnivore mono eating meat only and you

531
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:24,400
give them a year you give them two years

532
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,760
and they'll be off of it the reason why

533
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,280
they be off of it is because their

534
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,039
muscles won't build properly anymore

535
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,799
they don't have any glucose to feed

536
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:35,240
their

537
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:38,440
muscles they'll start aging and look way

538
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,440
older before their

539
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:46,840
time they'll have the meat age the meat

540
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:49,200
aging where your skin just starts to

541
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,880
fall apart over time when you're young

542
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:55,120
you look like you're 40 when you're

543
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:57,039
20 carnivore diets that's what it does

544
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,559
you don't have any antioxidants in your

545
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,919
diet

546
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:02,240
another thing with people that have done

547
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:03,799
carnivores they'll take a ton of

548
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,000
supplements of all kinds they're just

549
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:07,280
looking for anything whey protein powder

550
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,280
creatine they're just looking for

551
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,840
anything they can find lcarnitine

552
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:15,320
they're taking everything under the sun

553
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:17,760
because they're so so jonesen for

554
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:19,440
anything because really they're starving

555
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,000
themselves of like real nutrients and

556
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,880
everything else I'm not saying meat's

557
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,960
bad that's you want to eat meat fine but

558
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,880
I'm just telling you what's going on

559
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,039
with carnivore so many people lie on

social media too they're telling you one

561
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:32,080
thing but it's It's Not What It Seems

562
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,919
they're telling you one thing but it's

563
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,760
not what it seems they're actually doing

564
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:39,440
something entirely different they they

565
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:41,320
don't want to lose their like mojo on

566
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,039
the set they're doing their social media

567
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,120
and their reals and everything else and

568
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,960
they're not going to tell you they

569
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:48,080
cheated on this a little to survive they

570
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,480
ate a little of this over here they were

571
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,120
over here at their family's house they

572
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,840
had a bite of this and then they're

573
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,880
going back on saying I'm carnivore I'm

574
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,880
carnivore this is how I

575
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,360
eat rise with melum over there on

576
00:21:58,279 --> 00:22:02,760
YouTube says my hairdresser is on a keto

577
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:04,679
diet and he had to fill up with honey

578
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:06,640
during our session cuz he couldn't

579
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:08,960
function anymore he told me how he feels

580
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,200
more awake

581
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,960
now so here's the thing let's go into

582
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,640
this a little

583
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:18,240
bit talking so fast I think I need to

584
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,240
slow down my

585
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,640
talk all right so I'm going to add

586
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:27,039
spices and everything I need to put in

587
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,080
here putting a tablespoon of garlic

588
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:31,559
powder in here

589
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,559
that's what I'm

590
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:38,799
doing get that in there that's the onion

591
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:41,240

592
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:43,600

593
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:45,520
powder there we go got that in there

594
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,440
okay I'm going to squeeze some lemons in

595
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,039
here as well I mean you can do a little

596
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,520
bit more lemon if you really want to

597
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:52,120
it's a half tablespoon of freshly

598
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:54,760
squeezed lemon juice I'm going to do

599
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:57,039
probably I don't know a little more

600
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:59,880
maybe I'm going to cut a couple lemons

601
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:03,559
up right here

602
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,559
let me get a strainer if you guys don't

603
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:09,000
mind I'm going to drop some lemon juice

604
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:11,640
in here now this is the potato and

605
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,520
cherry tomato bake so I'm going to drop

606
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:16,440
a little bit of lemon juice in here you

607
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:18,120
guys this is a medical mean recipe

608
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,760
that's really great it's a fun one it's

609
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,960
going to be so fun to eat so great to

610
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,960
eat okay so I'm going to drop some lemon

611
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,640
in here and then going to add some thyme

612
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:28,799
and some oregano so that's the plan

613
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,799
right here

614
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:45,240
yep so I'll give you the Europe talk too

615
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:47,080
about Europe right so everybody saying

616
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:49,520
Europe food so much cleaner so much

617
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:52,240
better but we got to keep in mind they

618
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:54,880
are so sick over there they are so sick

619
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,760
in Europe and I'm going to go into that

620
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,720
a little bit

621
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:01,120
too so what the take away from this is

622
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,360
the setup that's happening the

623
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:06,080
distraction

624
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:09,240
purposely they're actually like you know

625
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:11,919
acting like Europe is healthy because

626
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:14,360
they have better food there and they

627
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:18,080
don't do fast food like we do

628
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:20,440
here really ignorant thing to say um and

629
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:23,400
really what is it called freshman thing

630
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:24,760
to say you know definitely somebody

631
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,039
that's not seasoned in the health real

632
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:29,120
but you'll see people out there

633
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,840
talking and I guess it makes sense of

634
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,440
somebody who's not seasoned either it's

635
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:35,720
easy to fall into that all right so

636
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,720
let's pop some fresh time in

637
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:43,039
there people are sick all the same in

638
00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:46,039
Europe they're all the same in France

639
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:46,039
Italy

640
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:53,640
Netherlands they're sick everywhere

641
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,640
Germany they're

642
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:00,240
sick not even eating fast food and

643
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:02,880
they're

644
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:05,159
sick people growing their own food out

645
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,760
of their garden and they're

646
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:12,520
sick and they're growing their own food

647
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,520
out of their garden and they're sick

648
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:18,200
okay all right let me get some fresh

649
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,360
time some fresh oregano in here that's

650
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:23,480
going to get mixed up in here

651
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:25,760
too so I'm kind of taking the Twigs out

652
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:27,960
of the oregano for the most part any

653
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:31,080
real hard twig but I'm going to leave

654
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:33,919
some of of the softer Twigs in here so

655
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:37,200
I'm get some oregano going right

656
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:42,080
here but when you hear the rhetoric it's

657
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:45,279
the same old [ __ ] it's like in Europe

658
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:48,159
they're so much cleaner with their food

659
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:50,360
that you don't have to worry in the US

660
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:54,320
they're killing everybody with the fast

661
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:58,720
food it's the same talk and now they

662
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,720
just bring it back out again

663
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,760
okay got some oregano here I'm going to

664
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:08,000
chop up let me get some fresh time in

665
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:10,399
here too got some right out of the

666
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,760
garden right

667
00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:13,760
here there we

668
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:19,760
go so I don't want it too Twiggy because

669
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:22,399
this isn't a stew or a soup so what

670
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,000
happens is with thyme thyme twigs and

671
00:26:22,399 --> 00:26:26,600
everything if you put it in something

672
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,600
like this it it's going to be a little

673
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:31,279
bit more Twiggy when you're baking it

674
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:34,000
like that so let me get a little bit

675
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:36,679
more here there we go getting a lot of

676
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,880
little T little th leaves right there

677
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:41,120

00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,399
make this taste

680
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:53,600
great there we

681
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:53,600

there I got to get that out that's going

684
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,840
to end up in there someone's going to

685
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:07,480
have some be like what is this it's a

686
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:09,919
big twig aw not good so right there

687
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:12,919
rising out of the ashes over there on IG

688
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:14,720
we are so sick especially in my country

689
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:17,159
Norway

690
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,960
yeah is everybody lined up at the fast

691
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:21,200
food joint in nor Norway but I heard the

692
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,840
fast food joint in in Norway is a lot

693
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:26,039
healthier than ours but everybody's

694
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:29,320
still sick people in Germany are so sick

695
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:30,360
absolutely they always have been yes and

696
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:35,279
they still

697
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:38,440
are they're sick absolutely right but

698
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:42,799
see the setup you guys the

699
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:44,519
setup is tricking enough people to

700
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:45,960
believe they're making a difference and

701
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:47,960
they're doing something by attacking

702
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,039
processed foods like I said you take

703
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:52,159
away processed foods you take away fast

704
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:54,039
food restaurants and how they do things

705
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,600
people will find a way to still eat that

706
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:57,320
they'll still eat it if they want to eat

707
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,200
that that's just the bottom line you

708
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:01,360
can't take it away you can't take their

709
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,559
their weed away in the states that are

710
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:06,200
you know that whatever it's legal you

711
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:08,799
can't take their alcohol away you can't

712
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:10,880
take their pills away you can't take

713
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:12,679
their crap away they want to eat their

714
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,159
fast greasy food fried food with

715
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:16,559
chemicals in it you can't take it away

716
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:19,760
they'll find it and eat it

717
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:22,080
duh Emma over there in IG I'm in Europe

718
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:24,600
and there are stricter regulations than

719
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:27,720
us I know that on what is allowed to be

720
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:29,960
added yes it's true in genetically

721
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:34,679
modified IED food as well absolutely and

722
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:37,559
that's true it still doesn't change

723
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:39,840
anything it still doesn't change

724
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:41,519
anything I know people in Europe and

725
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,880
they're growing food out of their Garden

726
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:47,760
they never even eat a processed food and

727
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:51,120
they've suffered for 20 years with brain

728
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,120
inflammation that no one can

729
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:57,679
explain I get it in Europe they do have

730
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:59,080
regulations absolutely fast food

731
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:01,440
restaurants have to keep some of the

732
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:03,399
food chemicals out absolutely is that

733
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,600
the reason why everybody's sick in

734
00:29:03,399 --> 00:29:07,039
Europe is that the reason why every how

735
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,320
come everybody's still sick in Europe is

736
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:11,000
that the reason why everybody's sick in

737
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:14,080
the US it's not the reason why yes it's

738
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,279
not good it contributes to some degree

739
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:20,720
if you eat enough of this you will have

740
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:23,480
a hyper a hyper fatty liver also

741
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,039
processed foods you know like like are

742
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,760
stricter I the processed foods are

743
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:29,360
stricter there too in regulations

744
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:31,200
absolutely but people are just as sick

745
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:33,919
they're just as sick getting just as

746
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:37,120
much much cancer the heart disease the

747
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:39,399
brain diseases the Parkinson's the ALS

748
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,919
it's

749
00:29:39,399 --> 00:29:43,600
rampant so true just spoke to a woman

750
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:47,440
over here on IG so so true just spoke to

751
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:50,080
a woman who came back from Europe and

752
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:52,640
said she started feeling neurological

753
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:56,080
symptoms again and needed to get on the

754
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:58,440
medical medum 369 cleans Europe is not

755
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,720
the answer to heal as far as the s is

756
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,640
meaning meaning like you can heal

757
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:04,360
anywhere us Europe you can heal anywhere

758
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:07,399
that's not what I mean Europe's not the

759
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:09,120
answer just because the pizza in Italy

760
00:30:07,399 --> 00:30:11,919
is missing some of the chemicals that

761
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:14,559
are in the dough here it's it's not the

762
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:17,519
answer to stop chronic illness it just

763
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:20,159
isn't you go to Italy you go to Sardinia

764
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:22,720
you go to somewhere and you actually eat

765
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:25,519

beautiful extra virgin olive oil there

was Millstone the olive oil is Millstone

774
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:47,519
it's not the answer still someone will

00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:33,440
end up clearing up symptoms a little bit

people that are sick in Europe that come

849
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:55,360
to the US to experience a vacation here

850
00:33:52,639 --> 00:33:56,639
for a month how their symptoms start to

851
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,480
dive down a little bit meaning they

852
00:33:56,639 --> 00:34:00,080
start to calm down and skin even starts

853
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,639
to calm down because they're on their

854
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,360
vacation then they go back to Europe and

855
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:05,760
it flares up again and they're all sick

856
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:07,960

I don't think I've ever said that point

869
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:43,280
before I don't think I've ever said it

870
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:46,000
in any live in any podcast and I don't

871
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:48,839

Facebook Selen on Facebook but overall

876
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,760
the quality of Foods is much better in

877
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:03,640
Europe they have better standards

878
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:06,359
absolutely will not argue that one bit

879
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:08,160
but I can tell you right now you can

880
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:11,160
even live above those standards in

881
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:14,520
Europe and grow your own food only

882
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:15,680
literally grow your own grapes only and

883
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:19,119

906
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:20,200
so many people in the city the line went

907
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:22,280
four miles and and it was just it was

908
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:27,119
unbelievable

909
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:27,119
unbelievable from all over the world

910
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:33,119
and I'll never forget it it was the most

911
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:35,560
beautiful thing all right this is all

912
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:37,319
good so I just wanted to mix this up

913
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:39,599
just just a little bit better and then

914
00:36:37,319 --> 00:36:41,119

916
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:46,079
the thyme I got the oregano in here so

917
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:48,680
what I'm going to do is pop this in this

918
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,680
little dish

919
00:36:50,839 --> 00:36:55,800
here but even the recent expert

920
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:58,480
carnivore guys are all eating fruit now

921
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:00,520
and honey they're guzzling honey

922
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:03,160
guzzling it it was off limits the

923
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:04,640
original carnivore diet was off limits

924
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:06,720
they were bumping into the walls I

925
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:09,119
predicted it I predicted it 5 years ago

926
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:11,040
I predicted it years before that and the

927
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:12,680
guys I even predicted would be bumping

928
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:16,000
against the walls and actually eating

929
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:18,680
honey and fruit are eating honey and

930
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,800

1087
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:10,160
liver fatty liver

1088
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:12,760
right all the same like I was saying

1089
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:14,880
before so keep in mind that the keto

1090
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:17,480
diet can still do the same thing over

1091
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:19,040
time as a processed food diet the

1092
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:21,000
difference with the processed food diet

1093
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:23,240
you'll probably have some more chemicals

1094
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,000
in there obviously you'll have maybe

1095
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:27,400
you'll have uh you know a little bit of

1096
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,480
a fried grease every now and then you'll

1097
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:31,240
have some other things too maybe you'll

1098
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:33,280
be on more bacon than you were supposed

1099
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:34,800
to be on with nitrates and stuff so

1100
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:37,079
maybe you'll have nitrates and some

1101
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,720
extra chemicals and maybe overall if

1102
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:41,040
you're eating processed food too much

1103
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:42,559
fried food and fast food restaurant food

1104
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:44,440
you'll probably just get there a little

1105
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:46,240
quicker you'll get there a little

1106
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:47,760
quicker you'll still get the stuff in

1107
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,960
the arteries in the heart you'll still

1108
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,960
get everything else you'll just get

1109
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,400
there a little quicker maybe a little

1110
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,640
bit more than a little quicker but you

1111
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,960
still get there but keep in mind that an

1112
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:58,720
actual keto diet that's free from proc

1113
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:01,040
processed foods will still get you to

1114
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:03,359
pre-diabetic type 2 diabetes will still

1115
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:05,720
get you to brain function problems still

1116
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:08,800
get give you a fatty liver a sluggish

1117
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:11,079
liver still give you arteries that have

1118
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:13,559
plaque in them and all kinds of junk and

1119
00:46:11,079 --> 00:46:15,839
fat in them and still get you to get a

1120
00:46:13,559 --> 00:46:18,599
heart valve replacement or a heart

1121
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:22,400
attack by the time whatever 60 70 and so

1122
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:24,240
forth on a keto diet that's not

1123
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:25,480
processed so all they're doing is

1124
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:27,760
they're basically saying what they're

1125
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:29,520
fighting for is they're fighting for not

1126
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:31,559
getting you there as

1127
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:34,119
quick that's what they're basically

1128
00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:36,640
doing but that has nothing to do with

1129
00:46:34,119 --> 00:46:39,680
real chronic illness and why that

1130
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:41,920
8-year-old died that 9-year-old died of

1131
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:44,800
some kind of terrible disease where they

1132
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:46,800
just said you know the child's you know

1133
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:49,400
life just didn't want to live

1134
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:50,800
anymore they have actually terms for it

1135
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:55,520
but that's what it

1136
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:57,480
means you know like a thriving problem

1137
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:59,200
the child can't thrive so all these

1138
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:00,800
children are dying every day at 99 years

1139
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,920
old 10 years old 11 years old of

1140
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:06,880
physical body pain and fatigue and

1141
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:09,119
they're calling it like the child can't

1142
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:10,520
Thrive that's what they're calling it

1143
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:12,480
I'm not talking about cancers I'm

1144
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:14,720
talking about like they're calling it

1145
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:18,480
like the child can't

1146
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:20,880
Thrive and they got 10 terms for it got

1147
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:23,040
look it up Susan says why are people

1148
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,800
saying they're healing chronic illnesses

1149
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:27,079
and cancer on

1150
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,960
Carnivore okay so here's how it works

1151
00:47:27,079 --> 00:47:31,240
okay you take somebody that's been on a

1152
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:33,240
processed food diet right and they're

1153
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:35,640
really overweight you put them on a mono

1154
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:38,720
diet and you starve them of

1155
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:41,079
calories you starve them of calories and

1156
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:44,280
you put them on a mono diet like just

1157
00:47:41,079 --> 00:47:47,040
meat only okay what's going to happen is

1158
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:49,760
at first they're going to get some

1159
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:53,280
results just like if somebody goes on a

1160
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:55,480
sardine diet where it's sardines only or

1161
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:57,920
they go on a tuna diet where it's just

1162
00:47:55,480 --> 00:48:00,119
tuna only or they go on a salmon diet

1163
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:03,400
where it's just salmon only the same

1164
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:04,880
thing happens their obesity comes down

1165
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:07,599
they start losing their weight they

1166
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:09,280
start shedding some pounds their liver

1167
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:10,480
gets a little bit better things get a

1168
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,960
little bit better they're not eating

1169
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,599
chocolate cake all the time they're not

1170
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:16,040
eating all the different Donuts cakes

1171
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:18,520
and cookies filled with all that extra

1172
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:19,800
fat and they're not eating all of that

1173
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:21,839
and what's happening is their body

1174
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:24,920
saying you're giving me a breather but

1175
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:27,160
here's the problem okay here's the

1176
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:29,359
problem you're eventually going to have

1177
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:31,839
to leave that diet you can only do it

1178
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:34,680
for a short time short time only your

1179
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:36,640
brain stops working your body starts for

1180
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:40,119
starts to starve with you know glucose

1181
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:43,359
deficiency and you start binging over

1182
00:48:40,119 --> 00:48:45,960
time eventually you get so severely

1183
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:47,400
nutrient deficient that you get problems

1184
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:50,160
that you never even thought you would

1185
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:52,400
get later on on the ladder and which

1186
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:55,040
just so you know those people are doing

1187
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:57,880
cancer therapies people just don't go on

1188
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:59,680
Carnivore and don't do cancer therapies

1189
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:01,200
So when you say how come people are just

1190
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:03,000
throwing that blatant statement out

1191
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,960
there like that scratch the surface

1192
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,520
they're doing cancer therapies they're

1193
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:07,880
getting surgeries and then they're going

1194
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:10,040
on Carnivore they're getting

1195
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:11,720
chemotherapy they're getting radiation

1196
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:14,160
they're getting all kinds of alternative

1197
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:16,720
therapies and conventional therapies

1198
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:19,040
both fused together like in bed together

1199
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:20,880
they're in clinics they're getting stem

1200
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:22,280
cell therapy they're getting all this

1201
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,720
crazy stuff right they're getting all

1202
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:25,079
this stuff and then they're eating

1203
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:27,160
carnivore and then they're telling you

1204
00:49:25,079 --> 00:49:29,119
the carnivore got their cancer better or

1205
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:30,160
they cancer into remission or they

1206
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:32,400
cancer

1207
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:34,000
reduced you scratch the surface you got

1208
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:38,280
to understand what the details are the

1209
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:41,240
details are there they're there

1210
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:43,599
okay nobody gets this big old diagnosis

1211
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:45,280
of cancer and then now they're saying

1212
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:47,720
well I'll just go carnivore and just

1213
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:50,720
ignore everything the 20 oncologists are

1214
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:53,160
telling me every single day they don't

1215
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:54,559
do that they listen to their oncologist

1216
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:56,280
and they work with all their doctors on

1217
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:58,200
their cancer therapies on all their

1218
00:49:56,280 --> 00:50:00,280
cancer therapies and meanwhile their

1219
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:01,960
doctors are helping them heal their

1220
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:03,880
cancer or putting it into remission

1221
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:05,520
whatever a blood cancer or some kind of

1222
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:07,839
lymphatic cancer that they did surgery

1223
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:09,079
on they're putting them into remission

1224
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:12,240
and then the person's saying it was

1225
00:50:09,079 --> 00:50:12,240
carnivore that cured my

1226
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:17,400
cancer the people who were carnivore

1227
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:21,000
eventually at honey and fruit and fruit

1228
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:23,359
juice interesting

1229
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,480
interesting so I don't know who's going

1230
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:27,160
on straight carnivore any any anymore

1231
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:29,960
there is no carnivore anymore

1232
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:32,640
the carnivore experts are drinking fruit

1233
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:35,240
juice they're not carnivore anymore

1234
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:37,520
carnivore is just a slab of meat in

1235
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:38,680
front of you and that's what it was and

1236
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:41,160
that's what it

1237
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:43,280
is I don't know why they're calling now

1238
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:45,559
a keto diet

1239
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:47,040
carnivore because now they're doing a a

1240
00:50:45,559 --> 00:50:49,440
low glycemic keto diet and they're

1241
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:52,880
calling it carnivore with a ton of Honey

1242
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:54,839
added to it and they might do a slab a

1243
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,319
bee for a little while for a long time

1244
00:50:54,839 --> 00:50:58,160
like for a short time for a little while

1245
00:50:56,319 --> 00:51:00,880
and they do that but if you do it long

1246
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:04,040
term or a long time you hit the wall and

1247
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:07,520
your brain bends and you fall the heck

1248
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:10,119
apart you actually fall apart just fact

1249
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:12,400
that's just a fact you fall apart you

1250
00:51:10,119 --> 00:51:14,240
hit the wall you hit the pavement and

1251
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:16,319
you're done that's what happens when you

1252
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:18,000
just do carnivore like it was meant to

1253
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:19,559
be at the beginning when people first

1254
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,520
started doing it where there where it

1255
00:51:19,559 --> 00:51:26,280
was dudes not women dudes you put women

1256
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:29,359
just on meat and meat alone their bodies

1257
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:30,640
will fall so apart so fast sure they

1258
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:31,960
might get a month where they're dropping

1259
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:33,319
weight cuz they're starving themselves

1260
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:34,559
with calories they're dropping weight

1261
00:51:33,319 --> 00:51:36,079
dropping weight starving themselves with

1262
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:37,920
calories they're dropping weight oh my

1263
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:40,839
God this is like the answer and then

1264
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:43,040
everything goes to [ __ ] 6 months later a

1265
00:51:40,839 --> 00:51:44,480
year later their health is disastrous

1266
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:46,920
from going carnivore where they're just

1267
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:49,160
eating a piece of meat they're done

1268
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:51,280
they're done they got nut their nails

00:51:55,480 --> 00:52:01,799
antioxidants they get no vitamin C in

00:51:57,559 --> 00:52:04,160
them and they start falling apart that's

1274
00:52:01,799 --> 00:52:06,640
carnivore and their breath smells like

00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:08,559
rotten meat and their bowels are filled

1276
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:10,680

getting their gallbladders out left and

1367
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:56,359
right I get it if you're a 24y old dude

1368
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:58,200
keto guy and you're working out in the

1369
00:55:56,359 --> 00:56:01,240
gym and everything looks great and you

1370
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:02,599
look buff and you're 23 24 years old and

1371
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:05,079
you got nothing better to do than just

1372
00:56:02,599 --> 00:56:07,280
to work out 4 hours a day and you want

1373
00:56:05,079 --> 00:56:10,480
to be on your you know high fat diet and

1374
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:13,160
your high protein diet sure absolutely

1375
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:15,880
looks great you'll eventually hit the

1376
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:18,119
wall and be doing green juices down the

1377
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:20,480
road and you'll be backing down on your

1378
00:56:18,119 --> 00:56:22,240
meat backing down on your eggs probably

1379
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:24,480
quitting your eggs eating more

1380
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:25,920
vegetables eating more fruit is what's

1381
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:27,079
going to happen to you because some

1382
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:31,240
things going to happen to where you're

1383
00:56:27,079 --> 00:56:34,440
just going to get sick and you end up

1384
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:37,839
sicker as the years go

1385
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:40,039
by D over there on IG my mother did

1386
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:41,839
carnivore this year and her kidneys

1387
00:56:40,039 --> 00:56:45,160
almost failed so I want to go into that

1388
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:48,520
so kidneys cannot handle

1389
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:51,240
carnivore it is a guaranteed kidney

1390
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:53,599
death for people with weak kidneys worst

1391
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:57,079
thing ever for a kidney patient to be

1392
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:58,839
told is to eat a lot of meat worst thing

1393
00:56:57,079 --> 00:57:03,359
ever for a kidney patient to be told is

1394
00:56:58,839 --> 00:57:05,039
to eat any meat worst thing ever kidney

1395
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:06,720
patients should never be told to eat

1396
00:57:05,039 --> 00:57:09,200
meat they will destroy and kill their

1397
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:11,119
kidneys without even realizing it and

1398
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:14,039
they'll just be like off the pasture

1399
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:18,039
boom gone kidneys can't handle high

1400
00:57:14,039 --> 00:57:20,880
protein they can't can't handle high fat

1401
00:57:18,039 --> 00:57:22,839
either that is a case where I

1402
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:25,440
listen I have to tell you something a

1403
00:57:22,839 --> 00:57:28,000
couple different things right so in a

1404
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:30,640
lot of cases out out there all right a

1405
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,400
lot of cases out there okay when someone

1406
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:34,160
has a kidney disease or kidney problem

1407
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:36,119
or something going on with their kidneys

1408
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:38,079
they're told to eat protein and they're

1409
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:39,640
told to stay away from all kinds of bad

1410
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:41,760
stuff right don't don't eat the

1411
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:43,880
processed food you got to but they don't

1412
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:46,559
realize too that eating nothing but

1413
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:49,240
chicken and meat and eggs with a kidney

1414
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:54,359
problem and oh my God it is a life

1415
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:54,359
shortener a life shortener really really

1416
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:58,440
sad it's going to the key diet for a

1417
00:57:56,680 --> 00:58:01,520
little bit first of all there is no keto

1418
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:04,079
diet either anymore it's gone you cannot

1419
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:06,760
go into ketosis ever if you even ate a

1420
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:09,880
half of avocado and avocado has sugar in

1421
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:11,680
it naturally you cannot go into ketosis

1422
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:14,000
if you're doing avocado it's not going

1423
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:15,880
to happen if you do a nut or a seed if

1424
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:19,039
you do peanut butter if you do peanut

1425
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:20,920
Butter's sweet there's sugar in nuts you

1426
00:58:19,039 --> 00:58:22,280
can't go into ketosis if you're eating

1427
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:24,520
peanut butters and nut Butters and

1428
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:27,160
almond butter Butters and almond milk

1429
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:29,760
and everything you can't actually go

1430
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:32,880
into ketosis right so there is no

1431
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:34,880
ketosis anymore the ketogenic diet has a

1432
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:39,920
false name it's

1433
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:42,920
fraud the ketogenic diet is fraud it's

1434
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:42,920
instantaneously

1435
00:58:43,039 --> 00:58:48,559
fraudulent that's what it is anytime you

1436
00:58:45,799 --> 00:58:52,200
see keto diet it's

1437
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:54,039
fraud it should be # fraud keto diet the

1438
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:56,359
reason why is you can't go into ketosis

1439
00:58:54,039 --> 00:58:58,599
it's impossible because no one the only

1440
00:58:56,359 --> 00:59:01,359
way to go in ketosis if you only eat

1441
00:58:58,599 --> 00:59:03,920
meat and chicken itself and only do that

1442
00:59:01,359 --> 00:59:06,319
when you do carnivore the way carnivore

1443
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:08,160
was meant to be which is terrifying

1444
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:10,319
where it was just chicken and meat and

1445
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:12,599
meat only or turkey and meat only or

1446
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:16,240
just meat only you end up going into

1447
00:59:12,599 --> 00:59:19,640
ketosis in that form or shape that's the

1448
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:22,599
original ketogenic diet it's carnivore

1449
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:24,760
but then keto took on this whole

1450
00:59:22,599 --> 00:59:27,079
different life and it took on eating

1451
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:30,640
some green apples and low glycemic

1452
00:59:27,079 --> 00:59:33,280
fruits and berries um avocados you

1453
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:35,039
cannot go into ketosis if you eat even a

1454
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:36,880
tablespoon of avocado because it has

1455
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:40,240
sugar in it which will then stop your

1456
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:41,880
ketosis it'll stop it so then if you

1457
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:43,920
even have a nut you have a walnut you

1458
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:46,559
just shut down ketosis if you had some

1459
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:48,160
tahini you shut down ketosis you have to

1460
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:50,359
understand something this is really

1461
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:52,440
important to know there is no ketogenic

1462
00:59:50,359 --> 00:59:55,240
diet anymore it's a false name it's a

1463
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:56,559
fraud name is what it is now because you

1464
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:59,039
can't go into

1465
00:59:56,559 --> 01:00:02,079
you can't go into ketosis unless you

1466
00:59:59,039 --> 01:00:04,039
avoid all sugars except for the very

1467
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:06,160
minute amount of sugar that's in beef

1468
01:00:04,039 --> 01:00:08,799
which is the blood from the animal and

1469
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:13,319
that's your best bet that's the only

1470
01:00:08,799 --> 01:00:15,760
way J Marsh over there kidneys kidneys

1471
01:00:13,319 --> 01:00:20,160
handle carnivore just fine protein

1472
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:20,160
doesn't hurt kidneys

1473
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:26,920
lying yeah that's really kind of you to

1474
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:29,440
make sure you told some kidney patient

1475
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:31,960
out there that they can eat lots of

1476
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:35,160
protein and carnivore for their

1477
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:38,720
kidneys how about that you think I'm

1478
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:41,520
lying well those words are killing how

1479
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:43,680
about that those words are

1480
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:47,240
killing because that's how it works out

1481
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:50,079
there because you can kill your kidneys

1482
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:51,640
with high protein diets if you have a

1483
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:53,119
kidney problem and over time you can

1484
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:55,079
weaken your adrenals with high protein

1485
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:57,640
high fat diets anyway you can weaken

1486
01:00:55,079 --> 01:01:01,359
your adrenals anyway over time

1487
01:00:57,640 --> 01:01:03,119
regardless but keep in mind absolutely

1488
01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:04,760
without a doubt you got to be very

1489
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:06,680
cautious with how much protein you eat

1490
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:09,920
how much fat you eat when you got kidney

1491
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:11,680
problems really important CU kidneys die

1492
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:14,039
easy with kidney problems when you

1493
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:17,400
proteine them to

1494
01:01:14,039 --> 01:01:18,760
death anyway thank you for the comment

1495
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:20,119
though because we just helped more

1496
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:23,920
people with kidney problems along the

1497
01:01:20,119 --> 01:01:26,400
way that might see this so they

1498
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:27,480
learn all right so back to to a couple

1499
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:29,119
different things we talked about

1500
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:31,079
carnivore a little bit about how it

1501
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:33,119
works we covered that a lot of details

1502
01:01:31,079 --> 01:01:36,119
and ins and outs about it how you you

1503
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:37,799
hit the wall you you actually can't

1504
01:01:36,119 --> 01:01:39,680
function anymore your brain doesn't work

1505
01:01:37,799 --> 01:01:41,640
you don't have enough glucose to your

1506
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:43,280
brain and your nutrient deficiency is

1507
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:45,400
actually get out of control and

1508
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:47,240
Skyrocket with carnivore here's the

1509
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:49,000
other thing too you can get tested with

1510
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:50,319
your blood for nutrient deficiencies

1511
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:52,000
while you're on Carnivore and it might

1512
01:01:50,319 --> 01:01:54,079
look pretty good because your body is

1513
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,559
scrambling to get nutrients out of every

1514
01:01:54,079 --> 01:01:57,839
single organ you have in your body

1515
01:01:55,559 --> 01:01:59,799
listen listen to this detail this is

1516
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:02,480
coming straight from s so right now in

1517
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:03,880
this very second you go on Carnivore

1518
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:06,079
like carnivore the way they meant it to

1519
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:08,599
be originally before now they're just

1520
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:10,359
now they're just eating a keto diet now

1521
01:02:08,599 --> 01:02:12,240
they're just eating you know a keto diet

1522
01:02:10,359 --> 01:02:13,279
that isn't even a keto diet either now

1523
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,760
that they're just bringing all these

1524
01:02:13,279 --> 01:02:16,640
fruits and berries and all this honey

1525
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:18,079
and everything else but if you eat

1526
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:19,680
carnivore the way they meant it to be

1527
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:21,839
where you're only eating meat and meat

1528
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:24,440
alone

1529
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:26,640
only your blood work might show

1530
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:29,160
nutrients because nutrients are pouring

1531
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:31,079
out of your organs to sustain you you're

1532
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:33,160
going to plead it but you don't know it

1533
01:02:31,079 --> 01:02:35,480
so so is telling me what's happening is

1534
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:37,760
now your body's like drawing from

1535
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:40,000
nutrients anywhere and anyhow they're

1536
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:41,920
pouring out of Bones they're pouring out

1537
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,160
of organs you're mineral you're getting

1538
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:45,920
mineral deficient you can't go carnivore

1539
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:47,359
without getting mineral deficient you're

1540
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:49,880
totally screwed with minerals trace

1541
01:02:47,359 --> 01:02:51,559
minerals and macro minerals totally

1542
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:54,119
screwed if you're carnivore so what's

1543
01:02:51,559 --> 01:02:56,279
happening is nutrients are pouring into

1544
01:02:54,119 --> 01:02:58,119
your bloodstream from all all kinds of

1545
01:02:56,279 --> 01:03:00,920
different organs and tissue but that's

1546
01:02:58,119 --> 01:03:03,279
how your deficiencies go worse and worse

1547
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:04,640
and worse and worse and so when you get

1548
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:06,520
your blood examined while you're on

1549
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:08,000
Carnivore for a month or two you got

1550
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:09,480
some nutrients in there because those

1551
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:12,000
nutrients are coming out of every

1552
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:14,000
orifice of your body to keep you going

1553
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,880
because you're in a desperate mode but

1554
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,640
then eventually once you run out of

1555
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:19,920
every nutrient every Trace mineral and

1556
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:21,279
every mineral and every antioxidant now

1557
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:23,160
you're totally screwed you get your

1558
01:03:21,279 --> 01:03:24,880
blood tested two years from then oh

1559
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:26,440
you're deficient like hell and then if

1560
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:28,119
you switch your diet you're on a diet

1561
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:30,119
that's actually helping you they'll see

1562
01:03:28,119 --> 01:03:31,799
your old deficiencies and be like you're

1563
01:03:30,119 --> 01:03:33,440
so deficient and be like what the heck

1564
01:03:31,799 --> 01:03:36,480
now I'm deficient that's how much

1565
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:38,279
confusion it is out there it's one big

1566
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:39,799
experiment on everybody it's like I'll

1567
01:03:38,279 --> 01:03:41,279
be an influencer be like well I'm

1568
01:03:39,799 --> 01:03:42,760
experimenting on myself but I'm not

1569
01:03:41,279 --> 01:03:44,000
really telling you I'm experimenting on

1570
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:45,839
myself but this is what I'm doing for

1571
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:48,119

this and this and this and this 6 months

1576
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:57,240
later a whole bunch of people are

1577
01:03:55,359 --> 01:03:58,480
experimen ING with you they're getting

1578
01:03:57,240 --> 01:04:00,400
sick they're having problems they're

1579
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:01,720
getting deficient and then 6 months

1580
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:04,119
later you're like oh I'm doing it

1581
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:07,319

there that won't touch honey ever

1586
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:15,599
they're afraid of sugar and and those

1587

people are like gone you don't even see

1588
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:20,039
them anymore the point is it's like an

1589
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:22,880
experiment where you're actually taking

1590
01:04:20,039 --> 01:04:24,839
people for a ride and now it's like oh

1591
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:27,279
I'm doing food combining now you guys

1592
01:04:24,839 --> 01:04:29,799
sorry I'm a food combiner now yeah I got

1593
01:04:27,279 --> 01:04:31,480
into food combining okay A year later oh

1594
01:04:29,799 --> 01:04:33,960
what was I doing a year ago oh don't

1595
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:36,000
know cuz nobody cares nobody knows now

1596
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:38,079
I'm food combining oh wait a minute now

1597

1598
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:42,559
macrobiotic oh wait nobody likes okay

1599
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:44,799
now I'm on this it's crazy so people

1600
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:47,039
just experiment along the way now I'm

1601
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:48,520
doing alkaline ionizer water which is

1602
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:50,440
dangerous because of all the metal

1603
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:53,400
plates they you know what they do they

1604
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:55,839

hey guys now I'm doing colostrum now now

1606

don't ever do those that's really scary

1608
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:03,400
but the point is is like unless your

1609
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,440
doctor tells you to and that's up to you

1610
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:06,559
and your doctor but the point is is now

01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:09,520
that's what happens people are

1612
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:12,359
experimenting along the way so just one

1613
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:14,640
big just screw ball that's it you're

1614
01:05:12,359 --> 01:05:16,480

doing something different o I just

1617
01:05:18,039 --> 01:05:22,880
screwed myself for the last year

1618
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:26,880
following that guy that's how it

1619
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:26,880
works um

1620
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:35,240
yeah okay another thing too so let's get

1621
01:05:34,279 --> 01:05:37,920
into

1622
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:39,200
it see over there on YouTube just trying

1623
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:42,440
to read some of the comments you guys so

1624
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:44,279
bear with me Annie over there on YouTube

1625
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:47,240
two years ago I did the keto diet and

1626
01:05:44,279 --> 01:05:49,039
ended up in the hospital and almost died

1627
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:51,480
when I got out of the hospital I heard

1628
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:56,319
of medical medium you saved my

1629
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:56,319
life going to get me choked up

1630
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:02,640
bless you bless you I mean exactly and

1631
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:04,279
that matters so you were on a keto diet

1632
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:06,880
it almost killed you yeah I mean years

1633
01:06:04,279 --> 01:06:09,319
ago I watched the keto diet almost kill

1634
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:11,599
a lot of people out there I watched it

1635
01:06:09,319 --> 01:06:14,119
happen it was terrible and then keto

1636
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:16,520
diet changed into the paleo diet the

1637
01:06:14,119 --> 01:06:18,960
paleo diet was this other kind of stupid

1638
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:21,480
version of the keto diet it's just it's

1639
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:23,440
just here we go around and around and

1640
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:25,920
around Marcel over there on YouTube my

1641
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:28,599
parents were instructed by my

1642
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:30,920
pediatrician to feed me a lot of protein

1643
01:06:28,599 --> 01:06:32,920
and calcium rich foods while I had

1644
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:35,559
kidney failure my health did not improve

1645
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:38,079
for years kept the kidneys sick most

1646
01:06:35,559 --> 01:06:40,119
likely because that's what it does but

1647
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:42,240
see it's not anybody's fault in the end

1648
01:06:40,119 --> 01:06:44,480
but I can tell you right now what is

1649
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:47,200
kind of somebody's fault right now is

1650
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:50,680
the stupidity around processed foods and

1651
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:53,480
and the campaigns raged and waged on

1652
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:55,079
processed foods and the amount of

1653
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:58,880
information that's going around about

1654
01:06:55,079 --> 01:07:02,520
processed Foods what what a decoy man

1655
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:04,839
the darkness loves a decoy like that

1656
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:06,880
loves it cuz that's not why people are

1657
01:07:04,839 --> 01:07:08,920
sick I'm sorry it's not good for you

1658
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:11,160
you'll get a heart attack in 50 years on

1659
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:14,000
processed food yes but I'm going to tell

1660
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:16,880
you right now it's not why people are

1661
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:19,359
sick it's not why people who go to you

1662
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:21,960
know University students are sick and

1663
01:07:19,359 --> 01:07:24,960
can't function and need to be on adderal

1664
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:27,640
it need to be on amphetamines 24/7 it

1665
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:29,319
need to be on on you know um you know

1666
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:31,240
all the different stimulants and every

1667
01:07:29,319 --> 01:07:33,079
stimulants and everything it's not

1668
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:35,480
that's not why it's not because of a

1669
01:07:33,079 --> 01:07:38,440
burger down the street I'm sorry but

1670
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:40,559
it's not because guess what in the past

1671
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:42,839
it wasn't like that and the burgers were

1672
01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:44,839
down the street all the same kids are

1673
01:07:42,839 --> 01:07:46,160
getting sick everybody's getting sicker

1674
01:07:44,839 --> 01:07:48,119
and it's not just because people are

1675
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:50,400
eating a freaking bacon double

1676
01:07:48,119 --> 01:07:51,760
cheeseburger once in a while yeah you'll

1677
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:54,440
get a heart attack it'll clog up your

1678
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:58,319
liver down the road and you'll get

1679
01:07:54,440 --> 01:08:02,520
obese not one carnivore and keto

1680
01:07:58,319 --> 01:08:06,440
person out there isn't on a ton of

1681
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:10,400
caffeine not one carnivore or keto

1682
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:12,400
person out there caffeine free I could

1683
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:15,720
say that a h hundred times in a row

1684
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:16,759
there's that one carnivore person that's

1685
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:19,480
caffeine

1686
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:22,159
free they can't function without it they

1687
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:23,880
need their caffeine fix carnivore people

1688
01:08:22,159 --> 01:08:25,040
that are actually doing carnivore really

1689
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:26,480
carnivore where they're eating some meat

1690
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:28,799
for a little while are addicted to

1691
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:30,120
caffeine they're literally circulating

1692
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:33,120
caffeine all through the bloodstream

1693
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:35,159
24/7 they are people out there you will

1694
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:36,960
see claiming to have found the Panacea

1695
01:08:35,159 --> 01:08:39,759
because they get some quick results on

1696
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:42,159
carnivore or keto or really just they

1697
01:08:39,759 --> 01:08:45,159
really just want fame and money don't be

1698
01:08:42,159 --> 01:08:46,440
fooled they're on caffeine and you don't

1699
01:08:45,159 --> 01:08:47,920
even know what they're really eating

1700
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:50,199
when they go when they do their cheat

1701
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:53,960
day that they're not putting on YouTube

1702
01:08:50,199 --> 01:08:53,960
or on IG

1703
01:08:55,719 --> 01:09:00,279
Neil said my emotions went crazy on keto

1704
01:08:58,799 --> 01:09:01,679
because you lost your glucose and you

1705
01:09:00,279 --> 01:09:03,560
didn't have it going to the brain so

1706
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:05,759
let's talk about that a little bit keto

1707
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:08,560
in the carnivore diet starves your brain

1708
01:09:05,759 --> 01:09:11,640
of glucose stares it starves it of

1709
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:13,759
glucose right there can't function

1710
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:16,440
without glucose it keeps your brain

1711
01:09:13,759 --> 01:09:18,560
alive it does and so what carnivore

1712
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:21,159
people do now is they're bringing lemon

1713
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:22,480
and honey in oh lemon was off limits

1714
01:09:21,159 --> 01:09:24,359
before but they're bringing lots of

1715
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:26,319
lemon now because you need that lemon

1716
01:09:24,359 --> 01:09:28,120
juice for your brain so it can start to

1717
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:30,279
function again they're bringing in honey

1718
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:32,239
too limit in honey oh because they need

1719
01:09:30,279 --> 01:09:33,759
that honey for their brain to keep it

1720
01:09:32,239 --> 01:09:36,159
functioning that's what they're doing

1721
01:09:33,759 --> 01:09:38,040
now they've changed the game I've

1722
01:09:36,159 --> 01:09:41,120
watched it I've seen it out there I

1723
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:45,120
predicted it that's just the way it

1724
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:49,239
is let me check on that real

1725
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:52,520
quick all right turn this light

1726
01:09:49,239 --> 01:09:54,800
on it's cooking up

1727
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:57,480
nice got something cook in the oven I

1728
01:09:54,800 --> 01:10:00,320
can't wait to dig into it cannot

1729
01:09:57,480 --> 01:10:01,800
wait so what happens when you go keto is

1730
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:03,560
the electricity in your brain starts to

1731
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:05,320
diminish and you start to slowly die

1732
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:08,520
without realizing it and you're just

1733
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:10,960
walking around W on the decline and

1734
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:14,239
don't realize that so that's how it

1735
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:15,800
works okay you're on the decline and so

1736
01:10:14,239 --> 01:10:17,719
what happened was intermittent fasting

1737
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:19,640
kind of took over the carnivore and keto

1738
01:10:17,719 --> 01:10:21,159
thing like the old carnivore thing just

1739
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:22,760
recently where someone was eating just

1740
01:10:21,159 --> 01:10:24,920
meat or the keto thing where they were

1741
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:27,679
trying to eat mostly meat so what

1742
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:29,440
happened was it moved on to intermittent

1743
01:10:27,679 --> 01:10:31,679
fasting right that was the next place it

1744
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:33,040
moved into intermittent fasting was

1745
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:35,000
don't eat in the morning but make sure

1746
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:36,480
you're jacked up on caffeine all day and

1747
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,960
then eat what you want at the end of the

1748
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:40,960
day and it could be

1749
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:42,920
anything eat a salad with avocado in it

1750
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:44,920
if you want eat a burger if you want

1751
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:46,960
have some cheese if you want do whatever

1752
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:48,920
you want the intermittent fasting diet

1753
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:50,679
okay so it's eat until later later at

1754
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:52,040
the end of the day and people were like

1755
01:10:50,679 --> 01:10:53,520
I feel better because they weren't

1756
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:56,040
having ham and eggs first thing in the

1757
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:57,640
morning burdening burdening their liver

1758
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:59,800
and their digestive system improved on

1759
01:10:57,640 --> 01:11:01,960
the intermittent fasting diet because

1760
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:03,560
their liver improved their digestion got

1761
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:05,120
a little stronger they W weren't

1762
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:06,920
bombarding their liver and their

1763
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:10,239
gallbladder with all that fat in the

1764
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:11,760
morning eggs and cheese and oils and

1765
01:11:10,239 --> 01:11:13,360
whatever else and peanut butter

1766
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:14,800
smoothies they weren't doing doing their

1767
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:17,800
peanut butter smoothies anymore and

1768
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:19,679
their almond their almond butter

1769
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:21,679
smoothies they weren't doing that

1770
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:24,159
anymore and so they were on intermittent

1771
01:11:21,679 --> 01:11:26,760
fasting where they were just on caffeine

1772
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:28,920
all day long and then in then later on

1773
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:30,199
4:00 5:00 6 o'clock they started to eat

1774
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:31,920
something and maybe it was a little

1775
01:11:30,199 --> 01:11:33,960
healthier than normal maybe it was just

1776
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:35,760
a sloppy cheat meal but that's what

1777
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:38,800
intermittent fasting

1778
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:40,880
was that was the level people went to

1779
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:42,320
when they tried to do keto properly

1780
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:44,880
which was starve yourself of all

1781
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:47,639
carbohydrates and they couldn't survive

1782
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:49,080
they couldn't make it and it wouldn't

1783
01:11:47,639 --> 01:11:52,360
work so they had to go intermittent

1784
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:55,440
fasting it's all just round and around

1785
01:11:52,360 --> 01:12:00,679
and here we go again that's all it is is

1786
01:11:55,440 --> 01:12:03,159
is round and round and round that's it

1787
01:12:00,679 --> 01:12:04,159
that's how it works and it's sad as hell

1788
01:12:03,159 --> 01:12:06,360
it's

1789
01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:08,040
sad because what happens is when you're

1790
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:09,800
chronically sick and you got real health

1791
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:12,080
problems it's not just try to lose some

1792
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:14,159
weight and get your blood sugar your A1C

1793
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:16,159
better if you're somebody that it's not

1794
01:12:14,159 --> 01:12:17,679

little

1924
01:17:29,199 --> 01:17:34,199
bit just so you know people living to

1925
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:36,679
100 has reduced in every single country

1926
01:17:34,199 --> 01:17:39,040
around the world and when they go to a

1927
01:17:36,679 --> 01:17:41,280
village where the young people moved out

1928
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:42,760
they ratio it the wrong way by the way

1929
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:44,920
and I hate to say this you guys want to

1930
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:46,280
know a little you want to you want to

1931
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:47,639
know a little diddy you want to know a

1932
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:51,159
little

1933
01:17:47,639 --> 01:17:53,280
tidbit you want one right now it's

1934
01:17:51,159 --> 01:17:55,040
painful okay because I know a lot of

1935
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:56,360
people in Europe I know a lot of lot of

1936
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:58,120
people in Italy I know a lot of people

1937
01:17:56,360 --> 01:18:01,040
in France I know a lot of people all

1938
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:03,360
through Europe Germany and so forth and

1939
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:05,040
I'm going to tell you right here okay

1940
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:06,840
they take little Villages where all the

1941
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:09,159
young people moved out and then they

1942
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:11,199
ratio the numbers and they say this

1943
01:18:09,159 --> 01:18:12,960
Village is a higher amount of older

1944
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:14,760
people so something must be different

1945
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:17,600
here in this Village than somewhere else

1946
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:21,400
it's one of the biggest

1947
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:23,320
Roes yeah you know where I'm going right

1948
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:26,560
but what happened is there was no way to

1949
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:28,600
make money in the village anymore so all

1950
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:32,159
the young people almost all of them

1951
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:35,920
moved out so they couldn't do the ratio

1952
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:38,239
game to Young and older people to ratio

1953
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:40,440
if people are actually really older

1954
01:18:38,239 --> 01:18:44,040
there for a reason and they keep that

1955
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:46,840
detail out what what a Roose that is

1956
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:49,440
they keep the detail

1957
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:52,679
out they keep the most important detail

1958
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:54,880
out possible they find a remote remote

1959
01:18:52,679 --> 01:18:56,320
village where there hardly is a young

1960
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:57,480
person working there anymore living

1961
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:59,040
there because they can't sustain

1962
01:18:57,480 --> 01:19:00,719
themselves they have to make a life they

1963
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:02,800
move their family out they start their

1964
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:04,760
families out after college and so forth

1965
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:06,880
they don't go home The Village just has

1966
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:08,360
mostly old people and then they say whoa

1967
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:10,639
there's a lot of older people in this

1968
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:13,120
Village Let's test the water let's see

01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:20,080
they're eating there but no one wants to

1973
01:19:18,239 --> 01:19:22,000
admit or tell you they don't want to

1974
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:24,840
tell you the secret they're doing the

1975
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:26,639
numbers and the ratio game and they're

1976
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:29,159
not telling you it's because all the

1977
01:19:26,639 --> 01:19:30,600
young people moved out of the village

1978
01:19:29,159 --> 01:19:32,679
there aren't young people in that

1979
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:34,520
Village there's very few you want to be

1980
01:19:32,679 --> 01:19:36,400
a person that's 22 years old and go to

1981
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:37,800
that Village and find a mate and party

1982
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:39,760
and everything else you're going to be

1983
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:42,239
sitting there on the curb alone there's

1984
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:42,239
nobody

1985
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:50,480
there what I'm saying is we have 100y

1986
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:52,960
olds all over the land around the world

1987
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:55,199
but we have a decrease of it people are

1988
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:57,560
dying faster and more and not living to

1989
01:19:55,199 --> 01:19:59,760
be older as much and we're on the last

1990
01:19:57,560 --> 01:20:01,440
round of the dinosaurs you guys right

1991
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:03,719
now we're on the last round of the

1992
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:05,280
Dinosaurs the older people that are old

1993
01:20:03,719 --> 01:20:07,960
now there isn't going to be a big

1994
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:10,360
succession a big succession of older

1995
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:12,960
people coming their way I hate to say it

1996
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:16,000
but there's not and processed food is

1997
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:18,679
not the answer either

1998
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:21,400
way I predicted life expectancy was

1999
01:20:18,679 --> 01:20:22,960
dropping dramatically and it did and

2000
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:25,159
science proved it and proved medical

2001
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:27,040
medium right

2002
01:20:25,159 --> 01:20:28,840
the one thing you can actually have

2003
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:30,440
confidence in is the medical medium

2004
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:32,120
books because guess what it's proved

2005
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:33,639
right constantly and never proved wrong

2006
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:35,000
sorry but none of the medical medium

2007
01:20:33,639 --> 01:20:37,040
books or information have been proved

2008
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:38,880
wrong yet science hasn't proved a single

2009
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:42,320
thing wrong instead they keep on proving

2010
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:42,320
everything right out of the books and

2011
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:49,080

move this right here

2064
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:11,960
so

2065
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:15,159
um so here's what happens when you eat a

2066
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:19,040
lot of processed food okay not all

2067
01:23:15,159 --> 01:23:22,040
processed food just some processed

2068
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:25,400
food there's some processed food that

2069
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:28,719
doesn't hurt someone but there's some

2070
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:32,159
that causes something to happen

2071
01:23:28,719 --> 01:23:34,400
right over the years you get a

2072
01:23:32,159 --> 01:23:37,480
buildup I even know if you can even see

2073
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:37,480
that you get some

2074
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:41,840
plaque and then your

2075
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:48,040
liver right and then your

2076
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:55,280
liver over the years you get a fatty

2077
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:57,480
liver dysfunctional liver

2078
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:58,880
you can get that on the keto diet you

2079
01:23:57,480 --> 01:24:02,000
can get that on the carnivore diet you

2080
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:03,719
can get that on a a high fat vegan diet

2081
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:06,560
you can get that on a high fat vegan

2082
01:24:03,719 --> 01:24:11,480
diet your liver turn into a fatty liver

2083
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:11,480

adrenaline every day the adrenaline's

2113
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:40,320
getting stopped up by your

2114
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:42,920
liver it's not about processed foods

2115
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:45,800
it's not it's other

2116
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:48,280
things the same people right now telling

2117
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:50,639
people don't you processed foods or

2118
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:52,639
gobbling down the caffeine every single

2119
01:25:50,639 --> 01:25:54,520
day they're acting like they're Health

2120
01:25:52,639 --> 01:25:57,080
experts they're out there talking on the

2121
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:58,400
lecture scene they're going on TV and

2122
01:25:57,080 --> 01:26:00,639
they're sitting there process foods

2123
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:02,920
process foods meanwhile their caffeine

2124
01:26:00,639 --> 01:26:04,840
habit is off the charts they're teaching

2125
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:06,360
people still drink your caffeine make

2126
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:07,760
sure you still do that oh and don't

2127
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:09,679
worry about alcohol either it's

2128
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:11,600
processed foods the problem and what's

2129
01:26:09,679 --> 01:26:14,320
happening is their adrenals are blowing

2130
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:16,520
out all this adrenaline it's saturating

2131
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:19,480
their liver and that adrenaline makes

2132
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:22,960
the liver tired and the liver goes fatty

2133
01:26:19,480 --> 01:26:24,760
even on a plant-based diet a vegan diet

2134
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:28,639
a clean keto diet

2135
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:30,840
a clean carnivore diet whatever it is

2136
01:26:28,639 --> 01:26:33,440
your liver can still get Mucky still

2137
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:36,040
problematic your gallbladder can still

2138
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:38,119
turn to crap filled with all kinds of

2139
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:39,560
junk and debris and that's what could

2140
01:26:38,119 --> 01:26:42,440
happen right

2141
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:45,159
there and so the processed food people

2142
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:48,000
they're just they're just decoys trying

2143
01:26:45,159 --> 01:26:49,840
to become famous at this point oo I got

2144
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:52,000
a buzz a lot of people are interested in

2145
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:53,960

in life life to stop the processed food

01:26:56,040 --> 01:27:00,280
because it's killing the

2149
01:26:58,040 --> 01:27:04,679
planet meanwhile there's so many there's

2150
01:27:00,280 --> 01:27:07,679

thing so here's the thing what people

2248
01:31:14,639 --> 01:31:17,520
don't understand when you're doing

2249
01:31:15,639 --> 01:31:19,040
medical Medium you're customizing the

2250
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:20,360
protocols you're looking at your

2251
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:22,800
problems you're finding out what's wrong

2252
01:31:20,360 --> 01:31:24,560
with you there there are hundreds and

2253
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:26,560
hundreds of different protocol calls

2254
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:28,560
because you're looking for what's going

2255
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:30,119
on with you and you can make it right

2256
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:32,239
for yourself you can still do medical

2257
01:31:30,119 --> 01:31:34,800
medium and eat meat you can still do

2258
01:31:32,239 --> 01:31:36,159
medical medium and eat chicken if you

2259
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:37,800
really wanted to you can still do

2260
01:31:36,159 --> 01:31:39,480
medical medium and be plant-based you

2261
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:41,440
can be raw plant-based if you want and

2262
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:43,560
still do medical medium but that's the

2263
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:45,840
incredible part it's geared for women

2264
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:48,000
and Women's Health and men too and it's

2265
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:50,480
geared for customizing to what's going

2266
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:52,199
on with each individual and that's what

2267
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:53,960
the medical medium books have done and

2268
01:31:52,199 --> 01:31:54,920
you see there's a little emblem on that

2269
01:31:53,960 --> 01:31:57,440
book right

2270
01:31:54,920 --> 01:32:00,080
there see that little emblem right there

2271
01:31:57,440 --> 01:32:03,080
millions of copies sold in the medical

2272
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:05,400
medium series millions of people around

2273
01:32:03,080 --> 01:32:07,239
the world had their lives changed they

2274
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:09,679
live by these they're their Bibles they

2275
01:32:07,239 --> 01:32:11,360
sit in their kitchens with them these

2276
01:32:09,679 --> 01:32:14,480
books are packed with

2277
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:16,600
information keep that in mind and then

2278
01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:18,159
stuff gets poached out of here yep it

2279
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:20,119
has it's been poached out of all the

2280
01:32:18,159 --> 01:32:21,880
medical medium books all right so I

2281
01:32:20,119 --> 01:32:25,440
think my dish is just about ready I'm

2282
01:32:21,880 --> 01:32:25,440
going to pull it out

2283
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:40,320
see here all right there we

2284
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:44,239
are I am going to be careful because

2285
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:47,440
this is hot and I'm using a hand towel

2286
01:32:44,239 --> 01:32:50,000
instead of an oven mitt

2287
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:52,600
because some of the this is because it's

2288
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:54,280
a bad idea but I did it anyway I did not

2289
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:57,280
get burned

2290
01:32:54,280 --> 01:33:00,199
no I didn't so here we

2291
01:32:57,280 --> 01:33:02,679
go this thing is blazing hot and I don't

2292
01:33:00,199 --> 01:33:05,679
want to get my finger caught in there

2293
01:33:02,679 --> 01:33:09,000
whoa here it is you guys there it is

2294
01:33:05,679 --> 01:33:09,000
potato and cherry tomato

2295
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:13,040
bake just showing

2296
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:19,600
you woo and it's a hot one too let it

2297
01:33:18,040 --> 01:33:21,520
cool down a little

2298
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:23,440
bit we'll give it a minute and then

2299
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:25,400
we'll cut right into it see what's going

2300
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:28,000
on

2301
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:29,880
I love these cherry

2302
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:31,280
tomatoes people are eating cherry

2303
01:33:29,880 --> 01:33:33,520
tomatoes again they're eating tomatoes

2304
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:36,760
Again Medical medium books talked about

2305
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:36,760
how The Nightshade thing was a

2306
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:43,000
theory and not accurate people are

2307
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:43,000
eating tomatoes

2308
01:33:43,719 --> 01:33:46,920
again all

2309
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:56,719
right so back to

2310
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:59,840
processed food

2311
01:33:56,719 --> 01:33:59,840
propaganda all

2312
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:05,639
right there's a reason why it's becoming

2313
01:34:04,760 --> 01:34:08,080
like it

2314
01:34:05,639 --> 01:34:10,600
is Talk of the Town it's becoming

2315
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:14,320
popular it's becoming the trend to hate

2316
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:16,760
on processed foods there's a reason it's

2317
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:18,600
to make people believe that their

2318
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:20,360
chronic illness and their symptoms and

2319
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:21,679
their conditions comes from those

2320
01:34:20,360 --> 01:34:25,320
processed

2321
01:34:21,679 --> 01:34:28,119
foods there's a reason why

2322
01:34:25,320 --> 01:34:31,400
that correlation is being forced upon

2323
01:34:28,119 --> 01:34:35,000
everybody and that influencers are being

2324
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:37,840
stupid enough to actually run with it

2325
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:40,400
and act like they're you know an expert

2326
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:43,280
at this you know processed food whole

2327
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:44,600
thing and that people should look out

2328
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:46,440
and they should know that the rules need

2329
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:48,639
to change out there and food needs to be

2330
01:34:46,440 --> 01:34:51,440
cleaner I get that

2331
01:34:48,639 --> 01:34:53,760
part but it's not responsible for your

2332
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:56,960
chronic illness

2333
01:34:53,760 --> 01:35:01,280
you can be on a keto diet and feed your

2334
01:34:56,960 --> 01:35:04,920
viruses you can be on a keto diet and

2335
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:08,400
feed your bacteria you can be

2336
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:11,119
on an animal protein diet that's you

2337
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:13,840
know the the animals are killed in your

2338
01:35:11,119 --> 01:35:16,000
backyard the Butter's made you churned

2339
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:18,280
it yourself with your own cows and

2340
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:20,119
you're churning your butter you're

2341
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:22,639
milking your own cows and you're

2342
01:35:20,119 --> 01:35:24,960
drinking raw milk from your own cow and

2343
01:35:22,639 --> 01:35:27,280
you will feed your viruses and you will

2344
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:29,840
be bedridden

2345
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:32,280
sure if you weren't sick yet and you're

2346
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:34,800
doing that everything looks great but if

2347
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:36,719
you ever get sick one day or if a bug

2348
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:38,960
finally gets a little strength and it

2349
01:35:36,719 --> 01:35:40,480
rises up it's going to feed on the foods

2350
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:42,480
that you're eating even though you're

2351
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:45,800
not doing processed food life you're

2352
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:50,040
doing everything made at

2353
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:52,440
home you're growing your all your own

2354
01:35:50,040 --> 01:35:54,560
food you can still get sick you're

2355
01:35:52,440 --> 01:35:56,159
raising your chickens you're you're

2356
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:58,239
collecting your chicken eggs every

2357
01:35:56,159 --> 01:36:00,040
single day and you're eating them and

2358
01:35:58,239 --> 01:36:01,600
you're feeding them to your family and

2359
01:36:00,040 --> 01:36:03,400
then all of a sudden one of your

2360
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:06,040
children out of your five healthy

2361
01:36:03,400 --> 01:36:07,400
children starts getting sick you don't

2362
01:36:06,040 --> 01:36:10,080
know

2363
01:36:07,400 --> 01:36:12,880
why because there's a virus that the

2364
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:16,280
child has that's starting to take off

2365
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:18,520
and grow and so now you got teenagers

2366
01:36:16,280 --> 01:36:20,280
and your teenagers are now some of them

2367
01:36:18,520 --> 01:36:22,239
are getting acne and they're getting

2368
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:24,679
different problems and getting sick or

2369
01:36:22,239 --> 01:36:26,280
getting tired or getting some OCD and

2370
01:36:24,679 --> 01:36:27,840
you're like I don't get it because I've

2371
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:29,520
been churning my own milk I've been

2372
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:32,840
churning my own butter I've been raising

2373
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:35,080
my own cows I got my like I'm raising my

2374
01:36:32,840 --> 01:36:37,800
own chickens they get the best organic

2375
01:36:35,080 --> 01:36:40,360
eggs possible I'm raising them myself

2376
01:36:37,800 --> 01:36:45,199
why does my daughter have OCD why does

2377
01:36:40,360 --> 01:36:47,080
my son have ADD what's going on and what

2378
01:36:45,199 --> 01:36:49,239
happened what's going on and what

2379
01:36:47,080 --> 01:36:51,480
happened and then you just start then

2380
01:36:49,239 --> 01:36:52,920
you're like what have I done wrong is it

2381
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:56,040
what I'm doing what's going on it's

2382
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:58,800
because there's pathogens and metals and

2383
01:36:56,040 --> 01:37:01,760
these Metals get into everybody they're

2384
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:04,280
everywhere and we get exposure and

2385
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:06,480
that's just how it works down

2386
01:37:04,280 --> 01:37:08,639
here there are people out there that

2387
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:11,080
live by the L land right they're back to

2388
01:37:08,639 --> 01:37:13,679
the Landers they live off the land they

2389
01:37:11,080 --> 01:37:16,040
grow everything then they got sick

2390
01:37:13,679 --> 01:37:18,239
children like they got sick children

2391
01:37:16,040 --> 01:37:21,080
that got sick later after they've been

2392
01:37:18,239 --> 01:37:22,960
living off the land it's not because

2393
01:37:21,080 --> 01:37:24,239
they were living off the land that got

2394
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:25,960
them sick

2395
01:37:24,239 --> 01:37:27,960
it's way better than processed food

2396
01:37:25,960 --> 01:37:29,679
diets way better than rolling up to

2397
01:37:27,960 --> 01:37:32,320
McDonald's every single day with your

2398
01:37:29,679 --> 01:37:34,480
kids definitely doesn't mean your

2399
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:36,760
children are free from getting sick or

2400
01:37:34,480 --> 01:37:38,679
OCD when they're in college or be on

2401
01:37:36,760 --> 01:37:40,639
Aderall when they're you know 21 years

2402
01:37:38,679 --> 01:37:42,080
old or whatever it is it doesn't mean

2403
01:37:40,639 --> 01:37:45,440
they're not going to get exposed and

2404
01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:47,320
pick up bugs and pick up a new strap

2405
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:48,880
from somebody else or something else and

2406
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:50,960
pick up a new virus and have three

2407
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:53,599
varieties of epsteam bar virus herpes

2408
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:56,760
simplex one going to their brain stem

2409
01:37:53,599 --> 01:37:58,480
and then the 22-year-old 23-year-old is

2410
01:37:56,760 --> 01:38:00,679
now looking around for answers and is

2411
01:37:58,480 --> 01:38:03,520
mad at Mom and Dad now saying You Raised

2412
01:38:00,679 --> 01:38:05,280

2413
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:06,960

2414
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:08,760
something's wrong cuz I'm sick I can't

2415
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:11,000
function I'm on

2416
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:12,520
Aderall I've seen it because I've I've

2417
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:14,040
known a lot of back to Landers over the

2418
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:16,520
years and they're like how did this

2419
01:38:14,040 --> 01:38:18,960
happen and why is this

2420
01:38:16,520 --> 01:38:20,920
happening it's because it's not just

2421
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:22,440
about staying away from processed foods

2422
01:38:20,920 --> 01:38:24,480
you should stay away but it's not just

2423
01:38:22,440 --> 01:38:26,000
about that there's so so much more there

2424
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:27,920
the details are in the medical medium

2425
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:29,360
books and yes in the medical medium

2426
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:31,159
books it says stay away from processed

2427
01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:35,920
foods of course it

2428
01:38:31,159 --> 01:38:38,520
does stay away from fried greasy fast

2429
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:40,599
food everywhere in

2430
01:38:38,520 --> 01:38:44,400
Europe here in the

2431
01:38:40,599 --> 01:38:46,920
states everywhere stay away from it but

2432
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:48,920
if you're eating it it's not the sole

2433
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:52,239
reason why you're sick sure your weight

2434
01:38:48,920 --> 01:38:53,920
will go up you'll feel sick your

2435
01:38:52,239 --> 01:38:56,360
lymphatic system will feel up with

2436
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:58,679
poison and toxins

2437
01:38:56,360 --> 01:39:00,480
yes but there's people out there that

2438
01:38:58,679 --> 01:39:02,280
aren't doing anything like they're not

2439
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:04,480
doing anything like that they're eating

2440
01:39:02,280 --> 01:39:06,280

yep Chelle says over there on YouTube

2540
01:43:59,960 --> 01:44:05,239
can you talk about opening up detox

2541
01:44:02,719 --> 01:44:09,119
Pathways here's how it

2542
01:44:05,239 --> 01:44:10,880
works when you're doing medical medium

2543
01:44:09,119 --> 01:44:13,520
information if you're doing the heavy

2544
01:44:10,880 --> 01:44:15,239
metal detox cleanse 369 cleanse you're

2545
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:17,599
already opening them

2546
01:44:15,239 --> 01:44:20,480
up that's the whole

2547
01:44:17,599 --> 01:44:22,719
point you're cleansing that's what

2548
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:24,800
you're doing but you can't open up

2549
01:44:22,719 --> 01:44:26,159
detail detox Pathways I'm going to tell

2550
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:27,599
you something about detox Pathways first

2551
01:44:26,159 --> 01:44:29,280
of all nobody knows what the detox

2552
01:44:27,599 --> 01:44:30,599
pathways are out there there's no

2553
01:44:29,280 --> 01:44:32,960
science that actually shows something

2554
01:44:30,599 --> 01:44:35,320
detoxing down a pathway and so forth

2555
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:37,520
right it was a term that was made up for

2556
01:44:35,320 --> 01:44:37,520
your

2557
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:40,760
detoxing

2558
01:44:40,920 --> 01:44:47,159
but I mean the crap that's out there so

2559
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:50,440
detox Pathways works like this

2560
01:44:47,159 --> 01:44:53,639
okay everybody's detox pathway is

2561
01:44:50,440 --> 01:44:56,159
different everybody's detox pathway is

2562
01:44:53,639 --> 01:44:58,679
different not all the

2563
01:44:56,159 --> 01:45:02,560
same because everybody is clogged up in

2564
01:44:58,679 --> 01:45:05,199
a different place

2565
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:08,000
everybody is in a different situation

2566
01:45:05,199 --> 01:45:11,159
it's not one size fits all the whole

2567
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:14,000
detox pathway talk falls into one siiz

2568
01:45:11,159 --> 01:45:15,960
fits all again medical medium

2569
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:21,679
information isn't one siiz fits-all so

2570
01:45:15,960 --> 01:45:25,119
it doesn't adhere to the dogma of detox

2571
01:45:21,679 --> 01:45:28,679
Pathways because everybody's different

2572
01:45:25,119 --> 01:45:29,840
you may have a clogged up liver in a

2573
01:45:28,679 --> 01:45:31,119
different part of the liver the bottom

2574
01:45:29,840 --> 01:45:33,920
of the liver the center of the liver the

2575
01:45:31,119 --> 01:45:36,960
top of the liver you may have extremely

2576
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:38,599
dehydrated dirty blood syndrome you may

2577
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:40,199
have different adrenal problems than

2578
01:45:38,599 --> 01:45:42,760
somebody else it's releasing adrenaline

2579
01:45:40,199 --> 01:45:46,280
getting in the way of

2580
01:45:42,760 --> 01:45:49,239
detoxification everybody's detox pathway

2581
01:45:46,280 --> 01:45:53,679
do you want to call it that is

2582
01:45:49,239 --> 01:45:55,719
different one size fits all

2583
01:45:53,679 --> 01:45:57,480
is not a great thing when it comes down

2584
01:45:55,719 --> 01:45:59,040
to Healing that's why medical medium

2585
01:45:57,480 --> 01:46:01,119
information has the most people healed

2586
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:02,840
worldwide than anything else there ever

2587
01:46:01,119 --> 01:46:05,440
was or ever will

2588
01:46:02,840 --> 01:46:07,880
be there's nothing out there there's no

2589
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:10,719
influencer that got more people better

2590
01:46:07,880 --> 01:46:12,719
there's no you know there's no system

2591
01:46:10,719 --> 01:46:14,360
out there health system with some kind

2592
01:46:12,719 --> 01:46:16,800
of Dogma in the alternative medicine

2593
01:46:14,360 --> 01:46:20,400
world that got more people

2594
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:22,320
better there's no place on this planet

2595
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:23,800
that got more people healed and better

2596
01:46:22,320 --> 01:46:27,719
and recovered than medical medium

2597
01:46:23,800 --> 01:46:30,520
information in books ever it does not

2598
01:46:27,719 --> 01:46:33,239
exist so keep that in mind detox

2599
01:46:30,520 --> 01:46:35,560
Pathways is a one- siiz

2600
01:46:33,239 --> 01:46:37,880
fits-all bringing you to a place that

2601
01:46:35,560 --> 01:46:39,920
that's how it's going to work for you

2602
01:46:37,880 --> 01:46:42,639
it's like strong arming you to that's

2603
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:44,560
how it's going to work for you but you

2604
01:46:42,639 --> 01:46:46,400
are different than this person this

2605
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:49,199
person's different than this person

2606
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:51,880
remember it's all about customizing

2607
01:46:49,199 --> 01:46:53,400
somebody May detox quicker because they

2608
01:46:51,880 --> 01:46:56,119
have a different pathway way than

2609
01:46:53,400 --> 01:46:58,920
somebody else not all or everybody's

2610
01:46:56,119 --> 01:47:01,599
organs sit in the same position not

2611
01:46:58,920 --> 01:47:04,159
every single organ is the same size not

2612
01:47:01,599 --> 01:47:07,080
everybody's bloodstream flows the same

2613
01:47:04,159 --> 01:47:10,599
way detox Pathways is kind of just a

2614
01:47:07,080 --> 01:47:13,920
[ __ ] term for just you know come to

2615
01:47:10,599 --> 01:47:13,920
me and I'll teach you how to

2616
01:47:14,040 --> 01:47:17,320
detox when you're doing when you're

2617
01:47:15,920 --> 01:47:19,199
getting the metals out you're cleaning

2618
01:47:17,320 --> 01:47:21,000
up the liver you are detoxing but you're

2619
01:47:19,199 --> 01:47:23,920
detoxing on the rate that your body

2620
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:25,760
wants to detox on you're customizing it

2621
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:27,199
to what your body needs and wants to do

2622
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:29,480
you're different than somebody else keep

2623
01:47:27,199 --> 01:47:29,480
that in

2624
01:47:30,760 --> 01:47:38,440
mind yeah jeno over there on YouTube

2625
01:47:35,440 --> 01:47:38,440
word

2626
01:47:40,599 --> 01:47:45,320
word so keep in mind you guys that

2627
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:47,080
that's how it works your lymphatic

2628
01:47:45,320 --> 01:47:49,320
system is a different size than somebody

2629
01:47:47,080 --> 01:47:51,440
else's lymphatic system and your kidneys

2630
01:47:49,320 --> 01:47:53,199
function and squeeze poisons out

2631
01:47:51,440 --> 01:47:55,880
different than somebody else's kidneys

2632
01:47:53,199 --> 01:47:57,480
do and your heart is smaller than

2633
01:47:55,880 --> 01:47:59,360
somebody else's heart and your heart is

2634
01:47:57,480 --> 01:48:00,840
bigger than somebody else's heart and

2635
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:02,599
keep in mind with this you have

2636
01:48:00,840 --> 01:48:05,000
different toxins and poisons hanging up

2637
01:48:02,599 --> 01:48:07,320
organs your detoxification process isn't

2638
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:08,920
the traditional madeup term of detox

2639
01:48:07,320 --> 01:48:10,599
pathway yours is going to be different

2640
01:48:08,920 --> 01:48:13,159
than somebody else but what so so has

2641
01:48:10,599 --> 01:48:15,199
done Spirit of compassion has offered is

2642
01:48:13,159 --> 01:48:17,480
it's not one siiz fits all offered

2643
01:48:15,199 --> 01:48:20,040
customizing and allowing the body to

2644
01:48:17,480 --> 01:48:22,880
choose its pathway the way it needs to

2645
01:48:20,040 --> 01:48:24,840
go for you and not just for one size

2646
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:26,719
fits all and that's the difference so

2647
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:29,560
when you do like the 28 day cleanse or

2648
01:48:26,719 --> 01:48:32,480
the 369 your body will decide how it's

2649
01:48:29,560 --> 01:48:34,760
going to cleanse properly the way you

2650
01:48:32,480 --> 01:48:36,239
need it done for customizing the way

2651
01:48:34,760 --> 01:48:39,639
your body works and what happened to

2652
01:48:36,239 --> 01:48:39,639
your body you're not somebody

2653
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:45,800
else by the

2654
01:48:46,639 --> 01:48:51,840
way that's just a tip of the iceberg I

2655
01:48:49,400 --> 01:48:54,119
can cut into the detox bathway thing all

2656
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:57,440
day

2657
01:48:54,119 --> 01:48:57,440
yeah with you know all of

2658
01:48:58,119 --> 01:49:01,840
it when you're healing symptoms

2659
01:49:00,159 --> 01:49:03,080
neurologically that you've had for 20

2660
01:49:01,840 --> 01:49:04,400
years and you're healing them on medical

2661
01:49:03,080 --> 01:49:07,040
mum

2662
01:49:04,400 --> 01:49:09,199
information that supersedes any any

2663
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:11,679
stupid detox pathway

2664
01:49:09,199 --> 01:49:13,480
talk you're mending nerves and healing

2665
01:49:11,679 --> 01:49:15,320
them you're recovering yourself you're

2666
01:49:13,480 --> 01:49:16,960
fixing your brain you're losing you're

2667
01:49:15,320 --> 01:49:18,719
getting rid of the atrophy of the brain

2668
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:20,960
you're getting brain tissue back how

2669
01:49:18,719 --> 01:49:22,360
about that you think I'm worried about

2670
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:24,040
detox pathway when I'm worried about

2671
01:49:22,360 --> 01:49:26,360
getting people's brains to plump up

2672
01:49:24,040 --> 01:49:30,679
meaning like get brain material grain

2673
01:49:26,360 --> 01:49:32,880
matter to develop getting gleo cells to

2674
01:49:30,679 --> 01:49:36,000
reproduce getting liver cells to

2675
01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:37,760
reproduce and heal getting rid of you

2676
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:39,880
know hunks of fat out of the liver and

2677
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:41,480
getting livers to come back that's what

2678
01:49:39,880 --> 01:49:43,880
I'm worried about getting nervous

2679
01:49:41,480 --> 01:49:45,639
systems to recover getting milin nerve

2680
01:49:43,880 --> 01:49:47,199
sheets to repair you think I'm worried

2681
01:49:45,639 --> 01:49:49,520
about detox Pathways when I'm worried

2682
01:49:47,199 --> 01:49:52,159
about getting somebody's brain stem

2683
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:53,520
fixed and their cranial nerves got holes

2684
01:49:52,159 --> 01:49:55,000
in them

2685
01:49:53,520 --> 01:49:56,400
and their cranial nerves aren't

2686
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:58,679
functioning right think I'm worried

2687
01:49:56,400 --> 01:50:00,719
about detox pathway [ __ ] when people

2688
01:49:58,679 --> 01:50:02,440
got literally cranial nerve problems

2689
01:50:00,719 --> 01:50:04,920
where their nerves are falling apart and

2690
01:50:02,440 --> 01:50:07,880
they're so sick I'm worried about fixing

2691
01:50:04,920 --> 01:50:11,080
the real problem the Nerf the detoxing

2692
01:50:07,880 --> 01:50:12,679
happens naturally for each individual

2693
01:50:11,080 --> 01:50:15,239
just like it's supposed to when you're

2694
01:50:12,679 --> 01:50:17,679
healing and doing the right things and

2695
01:50:15,239 --> 01:50:20,760
there's nothing more cleansing and detox

2696
01:50:17,679 --> 01:50:22,960
detoxifying the medical medium

2697
01:50:20,760 --> 01:50:24,880
information nothing more cleansing and

2698
01:50:22,960 --> 01:50:26,960
detoxifying I'm sorry but there is it

2699
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:28,760
and well what happens is I'm worried

2700
01:50:26,960 --> 01:50:31,000
about getting people to heal their

2701
01:50:28,760 --> 01:50:33,119
nerves their organs their nervous system

2702
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:34,800
their cranial nerves that's what I'm

2703
01:50:33,119 --> 01:50:36,400
talking about that's what I care about

2704
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:37,520
and guess what the detox pathway people

2705
01:50:36,400 --> 01:50:38,960
they didn't even know about that they

2706
01:50:37,520 --> 01:50:40,599
didn't even know people had neurological

2707
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:42,679
