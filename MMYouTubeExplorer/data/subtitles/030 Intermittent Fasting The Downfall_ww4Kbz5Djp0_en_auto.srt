caffeine right that's what we really

84
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:03,280
appreciate is the caffeine

85
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,280
because without

86
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:08,760
it the crazy thing with the caffeine

87
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,920
part with

88
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,560
it same thing but it's just another day

89
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,280
what happens is we get that high we get

90
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,600
that high and by the end of the day

91
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,359
we're coming down we're coming down and

92
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,240
then we got to Gorge we got to eat what

93
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:24,639
do you like to eat oh you're a healthy

94
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,520
one right you're a healthy person you're

95
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,479
doing like the salad and the protein and

96
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,080
lean protein and the vegetable and you

97
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:33,919
got it all together at night when you're

98
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:36,000
doing it friend of mine it's like all

99
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,919
Pizza Man the end of the day he's like I

100
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,479
waited for this I earned the right for

101
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,560
this pizza man then he just gobbles the

102
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,759
whole thing down but everybody's got a

103
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,280
Different Twist you know some people

104
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:48,960
like to eat differently at the end of

105
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:52,560
the day some people do like more like

106
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:55,639
4:00 then they'll do it again at like 7

107
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,840
but they went till 4:00 without eating

108
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:00,160
and that's a feat waiting to 4:00 when

109
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,240
you think about it one of of the things

110
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,720
that's a head scratcher for me this is a

111
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:08,199
big one right here it was a guy thing to

112
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,240
start is kind of funny right

113
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:12,759
intermittent fasting wasn't a girl's

114
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,840
thing it was a dude's thing you know

115
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:17,800
dudes that never had a health problem

116
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:19,039
dudes that never been sick dudes that

117
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,680
don't know what it's like to have

118
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:24,080
chronic illness you know like aches and

119
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,360
pains and fatigue and blurriness and

120
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,800
dizziness and all kinds of different

121
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:32,039
problems just wanted to get like more in

122
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,520
shape in the fact of like losing their

123
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:35,759
belly a little bit the intermittent

124
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,960
fasting thing didn't start with women

125
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:42,319
who are chronically sick because let's

126
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:45,360
face it if a woman's really sick and

127
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:47,080
they don't eat until 6: at night not

128
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,319
only are their adrenals going to go down

129
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,039
for the count their blood sugar is going

130
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:52,479
to drop they're not going to be able to

131
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,039
function they're not going to be able to

132
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,039
walk they won't be able to drive they

133
00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:59,479
won't get glucose to the brain blood

134
00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:02,120
sugar to the brain they'll just be shot

135
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:04,759
so it started out like with a dude that

136
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,880
wasn't sick so it's like a dude thing

137
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:08,240
and the crazy thing is when these things

138
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,280
keep on getting out of hand in the

139
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:14,919
trendy world all of a sudden everybody's

140
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:17,440
doing it and then no one's keeping track

141
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:20,520
of the downfall The Fallout the

142
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:23,759
casualties no one's watching any of that

143
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:27,639
no one's seeing someone who shouldn't be

144
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:30,280
doing that does it and they get hurt

145
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:32,000
right and that's just the obvious direct

146
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,360
hurt that comes across right at the

147
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,400
beginning of somebody doing it when

148
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,639
they're not well I'm not talking about

149
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:40,680
someone who's healthy enough strong

150
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:43,440
enough can work out they do it for one

151
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,800
year two year three year four year and

152
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,520
then all of a sudden their hair's all

153
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,840
falling out and all of a sudden they got

154
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,280
fatigue that's

155
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:53,639
unexplainable and all of a sudden

156
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,280
they're getting waking when they're

157
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:57,919
sitting there eating hardly anything

158
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,720
everything just starts falling apart

159
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,879
that's Fallout that comes years l later

160
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,360
for a healthy woman right that

161
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,960
intermittent fast you don't think it's

162
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,560
happening

163
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:10,720
oh I see it all the time out there and

164
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,160
so do a lot of doctors I talk to so do a

165
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,840
lot of people I talk to it's out there

166
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,919
it's happening but remember it started

167
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,599
out with like healthy dudes like strong

168
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:22,479
dudes that decided to stop eating bacon

169
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:24,280
and eggs and sausage in the morning

170
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,879
they're like you know what I'm kind of

171
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:29,680
done with the six eggs in the morning

172
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:31,680
and the sausage and the bacon and and

173
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,120
you know I tried not to do the toast

174
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,919
anymore I got rid of that and I just

175
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,800
started doing my protein breakfast which

176
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:41,360
was the egg two slices of ham around it

177
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:43,319
or sausage and egg Patty with no bread

178
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,400
but eventually it was a dude thing where

179
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:47,919
was like no I'm just not going to eat

180
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:51,000
this heavy meal in the morning and I'm

181
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:54,159
just going to fast and it kind of got my

182
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,520
tummy down so it was a guy thing all

183
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:59,560
along and now you got women who haven't

184
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:01,599
been sick yet writing books doing things

185
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:06,000
doing podcasts teaching other women to

186
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:07,280
do it but no one's saying you can do it

187
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,720
for a little while because you'll

188
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,520
probably get away with it if you do it

189
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,240
you're going to be sick down the road

190
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,759
and if you do it you're going down for

191
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:19,319
the count that month no one's monitoring

192
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:21,240
any of that no one's looking at any of

193
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:24,919
that because remember it's one siiz fits

194
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:27,520
all out there every time it's one siiz

195
00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:29,639
fits all intermittent fasting one siiz

196
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,759
fits all no one's looking at all the

197
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:33,719
subtleties and how everybody's different

198
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,159
it's always one siiz fits-all in all the

199
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:38,599
Alternative Health world it's painful

200
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:41,240

201
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:43,120

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,279
what she has to do for herself okay or

264
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:38,000
how about if you're taking your child to

the doctor so you're taking your child

266
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,639
to the doctor and the doctor

267
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:46,880
says uh Mrs Cooper we're going to do

268
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,720
interment fasting for your daughter

269
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,959
she's getting some weight so she's

270
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:55,880
gaining weight and we want her to start

271
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:58,240
eating at 6 every day so we like this

272
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:00,120
organic coffee let's make sure that your

273
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,320
daughter's using this organic coffee all

274
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,079
day long and she doesn't eat because

275
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:08,480
we're going to do the intermittent

276
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:10,959
fasting the expert way and she can eat

277
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,320
anything she ever wanted at night I

278
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:17,519
don't care what it is ice cream Mrs

279
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:21,000
Cooper um macaroni and cheese pizza do

280
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:24,199
you like pizza Daphne do you like pizza

281
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,880
she okay great pizza's perfect uh dapan

282
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:29,279
you like pizza perfect pizza party every

283
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:32,680
night Mrs Cooper at your house but she's

284
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:35,760
not allowed to eat the entire day but

285
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:37,480
she has to drink some coffee and you can

286
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,079
teach her how to drink coffee you and

287
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,880
your husband drink coffee every single

288
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:43,639
day so this is the new program we're

289
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,760
kind of doing here so I think it would

290
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:47,560
be a great idea we get her on CU she's

291
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,920
she's she's gaining a little weight we

292
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:52,959
want to lose that weight you know what's

293
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:56,639
weird I'm

294
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:59,120
detecting eating disorder oh my God like

295
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:02,079
when I think about it I'm like starting

296
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:05,120
to have visions of Eating Disorders all

297
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:08,040
through my head is it just me am I just

298
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:11,320
being crazy or something but I'm like

299
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:14,440
I'm smelling an eating disorder like I'm

300
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:19,120
seeing an eating disorder more than

301
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:20,360
that this is like eating disorder land

302
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,680
when you think about it right now I'm

303
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,959
just thinking about it now just by doing

304
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:27,839
this and talking to you

305
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:30,680
guys I feel like I've developed an

306
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:33,680
eating disorder just from this alone all

307
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:35,079
right let's be honest we're talking like

308
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,040
that can create a serious eating

309
00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:39,800
disorder right all right you don't

310
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:42,480
believe me okay do you know how many

311
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,279
people were taken away locked up taken

312
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,600
away in a Patty wagon because they

313
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:50,480
didn't want to eat do you know how many

314
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:53,120
teenage girls were locked up taken away

315
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,120
given ECT because of it do you know how

316
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,199
many people were hurt throughout the

317
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:01,440
years and years and years unfairly

318
00:13:58,199 --> 00:14:05,480
terribly unfairly in an evil way

319
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:09,160
actually but not eating all day long

320
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:11,959
would warrant an instant label of an

321
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:15,519
eating disorder a mental condition for a

322
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:19,040
young person the parents be freaking out

323
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:22,279
the mom would be just in total disarray

324
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:25,040
it would uproot an entire family

325
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:27,800
Calamity would ensue they would take

326
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:30,480
kids away they'd be seeing counselors

327
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:33,000
after counselors after counselors if

328
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,959
your teenager daughter teenager son

329
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,880
wouldn't eat and wanted to do this kind

330
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:42,880
of thing but because now it's fake

331
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:44,800
science approved and it's the trend and

332
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,600
people are doing it it's all of a sudden

333
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:50,000
accept it oh my god when I think about

334
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:53,320
it how many kids were taken away from

335
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,759
their families families destroyed

336
00:14:53,320 --> 00:15:00,160
children's lives ruined when I think

337
00:14:55,759 --> 00:15:03,320
about that custody losses of children

338
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:06,160
all of that because you know they

339
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:09,079
weren't eating which is terrible because

340
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:12,000
they shouldn't have been taken away so

341
00:15:09,079 --> 00:15:14,040
many of these families destroyed so many

342
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,519
problems it's not easy in the eating

343
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:20,120
disorder World a lot of tragedies happen

344
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:22,839
in different ways but how much how many

345
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:26,160
drugs and medications that children were

346
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:27,319
put on teenagers were put on like

347
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,600
dangerous

348
00:15:27,319 --> 00:15:32,680
drugs because they had an eing disorder

349
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:36,199
and then when I think about like

350
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:39,040
intermittent fasting is everywhere it's

351
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:41,000

00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,759
they're seeing it on TV they're seeing

364
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:10,199
it in movies it's just all over the

365
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:12,759
place it's perfectly fine it's just

366
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:14,800
intermittent fasting oh it must be solid

367
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:17,639
with science everything must be perfect

368
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:21,360
with it yeah no just don't eat as long

369
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:23,240
as you don't eat and don't eat just

370
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,800
don't eat that's the message see what I

371
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:29,440
mean it's you can't go it's not like eat

372
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:32,959
it's don't eat don't eat don't eat and

373
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:36,000
whoa no you're a loser you broke your

374
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:39,480
intermittent fast at 1:00 you better try

375
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,639
harder you get kind of mental about it

376
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,360
what about the OCD based around it I

377
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:45,639
mean think about that you start getting

378
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,839
into this whole pattern of you start

379
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:50,800
hating on yourself how do I know I've

380
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:53,079
seen it out there young people hating

381
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,639
their own guts hating themselves

382
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:58,480
thinking they're crap because they broke

383
00:16:55,639 --> 00:17:02,160
their intermittent fasting day at 1:00

384
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:04,079
or at 2:00 in the afternoon or at 12:00

385
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,199
and they gobbled something down because

386
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,839
no one's really teaching them it's not

387
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:09,720
the best thing to do there's other ways

388
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:12,199
to do it and they end up gobbling

389
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,880
something down at 2:00 and they feel

390
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:17,120
like failures and then they go into a

391
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,839
depression but no one's talking about

392
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,039
this it's like we're always worried

393
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:22,880
about our children not eating we're

394
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,520
always worried about eating disorders

395
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,959
there's a history of that out there so

396
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:30,039
let's just create a billion more Eating

397
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:33,280
Disorders but make it seem like it's an

398
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:35,799
okay thing it's perfectly fine to do

399
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,840
everybody's doing it it's science

400
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:40,960
suggested or there's experts everywhere

401
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:43,360
there's dudes there's women they're

402
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:46,039
experts now at it they're teaching about

403
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:49,039
it health coaches nutritionists oh why

404
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:51,000
don't you try intermittent fasting maybe

405
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:53,559
your son can try intermittent fasting

406
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,240
too maybe both of you guys can do it oh

407
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:58,039
what's the best way to do it make sure

408
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,080
you're doing caffeine all day and don't

409
00:17:58,039 --> 00:18:04,559
eat

410
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:07,520
anything it sounds insane because it is

411
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:10,720
and we get numb that's how it works here

412
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:13,799
you get numb to punishment you get numb

413
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:16,480
to stupid things that are happening you

414
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:19,080
get numb you just get used to it like

415
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:22,200
you don't know it's happening anymore

416
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:25,600
you just become with it part of it you

417
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:29,080
just let it happen you it just you coast

418
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:32,200
along with it no one sees it no one sees

419
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:35,799
anything wrong in it no one thinks of it

420
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,679
as anything it just naturally evolves

421
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:38,400
into

422
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:41,760
something

423
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,640
spooky and evil but it doesn't matter

424
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,720
because you can't see it cuz you're

425
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:48,159
blind you got eyes but you can't see and

426
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,840
it's just you just go along with it and

427
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:50,720
then everybody goes along with it and it

428
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,679
never

429
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:56,480
stops and then just stick a name like

430
00:18:53,679 --> 00:19:00,520
science on it somehow like license it

431
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:02,640
license it by giving it the science okay

432
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:05,320
because there was some kind of BS study

433
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:09,520
that wasn't a study that monitored five

434
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:12,679
people for a certain amount of time but

435
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:14,600
then never monitored them at all in the

436
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:16,520
future to what happened to them to what

437
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,960
they're doing now to maybe how things

438
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:21,159
have gone wrong and everything else and

439
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,919
I notice they're always monitoring

440
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:26,280
somebody who has no illness or no

441
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:29,000
serious illness like neurological

442
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:32,640
illness like Tremors and Shakes

443
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,880
severe fatigue brain fog blurry vision

444
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,760
like all of it combined tingles numbness

445
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,679
on the body weakness of the limbs all

446
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:43,280
kinds of different body pain everywhere

447
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:45,440
jaw pain neck pain all of this severe

448
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,640
insomnia they don't use any of those

449
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,480
people because if you starve those

450
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:52,960
people they're going down their body

451
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,039
won't be able to handle it you know

452
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,360
we're talking about people that are

453
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:58,480
bedridden too let's add that in say

454
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:00,880
somebody's bedridden or spends a lot of

455
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:03,240
time on mattress Island you take

456
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,000
somebody on mattress Island who's

457
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:07,880
struggling even a young person on

458
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
mattress Island who struggling and they

459
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,720
only have a few good hours a day where

460
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,280
they can kind of function enough the

461
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:16,159
rest is they have to just rest and you

462
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:18,360
take all their food away till 6:00 or 7

463
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:21,520
at night and they give them a big old

464
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:23,640
sloppy greasy fat meal afterwards

465
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,400
they're going to get really sick

466
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,640
adrenals are going to be gone nervous

467
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:30,400
system is going to be gone they're just

468
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:33,320
gonna have it much harder but they're

469
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,039
not using those people if it was so

470
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:37,799
great if intermittent fasting was so

471
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:41,080
great you guys wouldn't it get the real

472
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:45,039
sick better it doesn't get the real sick

473
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:48,880
better but it's for the not sick or

474
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:51,600
someone who's got like A1C is up there

475
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,799
or they got like maybe type 2 diabetes

476
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,760
pre-diabetes right they're not really

477
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:58,320
sick they just need to back off those

478
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:00,440
big fatty meals in the morning which

479
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:03,360
we're going to go into detail but in the

480
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:06,200
end it doesn't make them better better

481
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:08,880
down the road or maybe they're not sick

482
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,679
but they got some weight on them or they

483
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,679
not only have some weight on them the

484
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:15,039
cholesterols up a little bit but they

485
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,960
can go and go and go they're not

486
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:18,640
bedridden they're not on mattress island

487
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,880
with mysterious chronic illness

488
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,440
neurological conditions they're not

489
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,880
suffering or struggling they're not

490
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:27,279
dealing with severe fatigue they're

491
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:29,039
living their life they're healthy except

492
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:31,360
they got some stuff going on but they're

493
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:33,400
basically healthy they just been living

494
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,240
off the lamb you know eating too much in

495
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:37,559
the morning all these years sausage

496
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:40,200
bacon eggs you know fast food

497
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:43,159
restaurants greasy fried food in the

498
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:45,640
morning you know egg sandwiches every

499
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:47,200
single morning or just something heavy

500
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:49,720
in the morning like lots of fat in the

501
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,360
morning butter like butter heart attack

502
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:54,400
butter and they're bloated they've been

503
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:58,360
eating a big breakfast every day for

504
00:21:54,400 --> 00:22:00,080
many years or eating a big greasy lunch

505
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:02,520
all these years they have a doughnut in

506
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,600
the morning a cookie in the morning a

507
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:06,880
coffee and then at lunchtime they have

508
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:09,279
some greasy thing or some fast food or a

509
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,400
meat sandwich or a deli sandwich it just

510
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:14,159
catches up to you after a while and I

511
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:16,760
noticed that these intermittent fasters

512
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:19,919
they always start a vigorous exercise

513
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:22,200
program at the same time as they cut out

514
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,880
all that heavy grease in the morning but

515
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,600
take somebody who's chronically ill

516
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:29,600
who's on mattress Island even a young

517
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:32,520
person they can't exercise hardly anyway

518
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:34,720
they're really sick you take their food

519
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:37,520
away they're going to

520
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,159
suffer they're going to suffer greatly

521
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:42,159
and sure someone who's on mattress

522
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:44,480
Island shouldn't be on eggs and bacon in

523
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:46,919
the morning and grease and have greasy

524
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,960
fatty meals during the day and pizza for

525
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:52,120
lunch of course not but the point is his

526
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:55,480
intermittent fasting World believes any

527
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:58,360
food in the morning any kind healthy or

528
00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:00,919
not including fruit makes it so you're

529
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:03,279
not intermittent fasting so the messages

530
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:05,520
don't even do a healthy meal in the

531
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:06,880
morning so that person who's on mattress

532
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,880
Island and that young person who's

533
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:12,880
really sick gets the message whoa I'm

534
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:14,760
not supposed to eat anything I just

535
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,520
can't eat anything and everybody seems

536
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:18,960
to be getting so much better on the

537
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:23,000
intermittent fasting so I better try

538
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:25,440
this because that 42-year-old dude that

539
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,120
never had a problem who can exercise in

540
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,919
the gym all day and drink all the coffee

541
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:32,960
wants he's doing it and he seems to be

542
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:36,080
an expert cuz look at his little

543
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:38,400
magazine article or his interview on a

544
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,480
podcast and no one's accounting for

545
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:43,600
really what's going on because remember

546
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:46,840
it's one size fits all inter fasting is

547
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:49,279
a hack that's why it's for a dude that

548
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:52,640
never was really that sick who finally

549
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:56,360
cleans up his diet and decides exercise

550
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:58,640
or a woman who cleans up her diet never

551
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:01,720
had any real health problems

552
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:04,679
you know can handle like 90° heat no

553
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:06,840
problem can go part of the day without

554
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:09,279
eating no problem at all drinks whatever

555
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:11,799
they want drinks alcohol at night

556
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:13,880
exercises when they want and decides to

557
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:15,679
clean up their act like I want to live a

558
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:18,640
healthier life I'm gaining a couple of

559
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:21,440
pounds and I'm getting a little bloated

560
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:23,919
you go on the hack the intermittent

561
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,640
fasting hack where you starve yourself

562
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:28,520
drink coffee have a meal at night whoa

563
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,159
floating going down a little a bit hey I

564
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:32,520
could still exercise for an hour in the

565
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:34,360
gym this is working out okay it's the

566
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:38,080
ultimate hack for the nons so sick

567
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:40,320
person or the not sick person meanwhile

568
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:43,080
when you're really chronically sick it

569
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:46,000
makes you sicker and sicker and sicker

570
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:47,840
so someone would say wait a minute okay

571
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,480
someone who's chronically sick gets

572
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:55,640
sicker from this then why am I getting

573
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:58,520
better from this Oh no you're improving

574
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:02,640
from the hack at first you'll pay the

575
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:04,679
price later it's already happened you'll

576
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,840
see and I'm going to cover that now

577
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:09,039
there's an Empire or Empires built on

578
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:12,320
intermittent fasting when Empires get

579
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:14,120
built and Believe Me Empires when

580
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:17,120
they're getting built and built and

581
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:19,600
built they throw every single term they

582
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:23,039
could and every single scientific term

583
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:26,559
and everything catchphrase you name it

584
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:28,679
into it it becomes a monster out there

585
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:32,320
and then it's built

586
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:34,520
on the backs of the chronically ill

587
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,320
because the chronically ill doesn't heal

588
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:39,640
from it doesn't help them it's not

589
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:41,520
serving them it's not serving the people

590
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:44,799
who are really down and out struggling

591
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:47,520
trying to survive all it's doing is

592
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:50,080
getting some people who overindulged

593
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:53,919
their whole life many of them just had

594
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:56,159
it made gained a few pounds wanted to

595
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:59,080
exercise wanted to drop some of their

596
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:01,760
bad habits and pushed them forward a

597
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:03,679
little bit that's great and all but what

598
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,440
about the chronically sick what about

599
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,880
the chronically ill what about the

600
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,039
people who are really suffering what

601
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:12,640
about the wave of chronic illness that's

602
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:14,440
developing right now in this world what

603
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,559
about the chronic Le watching all the

604
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:19,760
propaganda out there on intermittent

605
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:22,520
fasting watching all the not so sick

606
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,960
people who throw out those glowing

607
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:28,240
reviews on how their weight went down

608
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:31,320
and they're feeling more energetic and

609
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:33,640
their Skin's a little better meanwhile

610
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:36,159
they were just people that weren't that

611
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:38,720
sick but the chronically ill they get

612
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:41,600
sucked into this because they're

613
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:44,799
thinking they're just as sick as they

614
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:46,679
are but it's not true when people have

615
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:50,320
tingles and numbness and aches and pains

616
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:52,360
and burning skin on fire severe insomnia

617
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:55,279
feet are feeling like they're lad you

618
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:58,200
can't walk dizziness blurriness blurry

619
00:26:55,279 --> 00:27:00,520
eyes severe brain fog panic attacks

620
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:04,279
every single other day I'm just naming a

621
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:07,080
few symptoms Tremors tick spasms severe

622
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:09,559
OCD and they just get tricked into it so

623
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:11,679
the empires are being built sucking in

624
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:13,640
all the chronically ill that think

625
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:16,640
everybody's sick the same way they're

626
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:18,640
sick it's a trick they're not remember

627
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:21,360
intermittent fasting is all about that

628
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:24,320
dude that was never sick decided to try

629
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:27,640
to get looking a little better so he can

630
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:29,240
meet his new girlfriend got into the gym

631
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:32,080
knocked out the steak and eggs in the

632
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:34,919
morning notice it was working and it

633
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:36,559
took off from there so the chronic leel

634
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:38,240
they're all buying into it though

635
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:39,960
they're thinking this must be the way

636
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,279
this must be where I'm supposed to go so

637
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:44,399
they're buying into all the programs and

638
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:46,120
all the different clicks meaning they're

639
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:48,440
clicking all the websites and

640
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:50,200
subscribing and paying subscription fees

641
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,960
for websites because they're seeing all

642
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:54,000
these people intermittent fast and their

643
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:56,440
doctors are like have you tried

644
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,480
intermittent fasting that might be

645
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,960
something good for you well let's see I

646
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:03,720
could barely take a shower my legs feel

647
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:06,440
like lead my Skin's on fire I've been to

648
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:08,679
10 neurologists let me try the cint

649
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:11,760
fasting I saw this guy out there he ran

650
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:14,720
10 miles and then hopped on a bicycle

651
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:16,480
and then he looked all triming good and

652
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,519
yeah his hair might be dyed and he's got

653
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:22,080
implants and veneers in but the guy

654
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:23,840
looks like he's he's doing great and I

655
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,519
think I could try to get like that

656
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:29,000
people don't realize it's more than this

657
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:31,640
now I'm not denying someone doesn't get

658
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,039
an improvement with intermittent fasting

659
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:36,880
to start with if they're a person that's

660
00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:38,960
got a constitution they're strong to

661
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,399
start with no real health problems at

662
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:44,600
all and they start intermittent fasting

663
00:28:41,399 --> 00:28:46,880
they hack it they do it and they see

664
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:49,200
some improvements I'm not denying that

665
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,440
so anybody out there listening that's

666
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:55,159
saying oh he's so wrong I know this one

667
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:57,799
guy my coach my trainer does this my guy

668
00:28:55,159 --> 00:28:59,799
does this I'm not doubting any of that

669
00:28:57,799 --> 00:29:02,480
because when that coach trainer or

670
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:04,559
friend or person did the hack

671
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:07,279
intermittent fasting hack and got

672
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:09,480
improvements it was helping them because

673
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:12,320
For the First Time in their life they

674
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:15,200
stopped that big old bacon egg sandwich

675
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,919
in the morning they stopped all that fat

676
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,679
in the morning maybe they stopped cakes

677
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:22,000
cookies and donuts in the morning or

678
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:23,919
Bagels in the morning maybe they didn't

679
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,000
eat that in the morning ever they just

680
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:31,360
drank coffee but their lunch was pizza

681
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:34,200
from fried food Burgers hot dogs chicken

682
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:37,279
sandwiches fast food maybe even

683
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:40,200
home-cooked foods frozen foods but they

684
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:43,080
were all drenched in fat they were fatty

685
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:45,640
foods and maybe they stopped eating

686
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:48,840
those lunches and so they went their

687
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:51,600
morning they went their afternoon and

688
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:54,200
they waited to nighttime and they got

689
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:58,600
into some healthier options like leaner

690
00:29:54,200 --> 00:30:01,159
protein say not as much bad carb not as

691
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:04,039
much oil on things they were just eating

692
00:30:01,159 --> 00:30:06,519
like some chicken breast they shed a few

693
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:09,279
pounds got a little energy back started

694
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:11,200
working out more and it worked for them

695
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:13,360
they got by they had a constitution they

696
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,440
were strong then you got the person

697
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,519
who's been into health for a while they

698
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,120
didn't have all greasy Foods in the

699
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:21,399
morning that wasn't their thing they

700
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:23,840
left the standard American diet along

701
00:30:21,399 --> 00:30:27,440
time ago they've been bouncing back from

702
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:30,559
vegan to animal protein to veganism

703
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:32,440
again plant-based then animal protein

704
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:35,799
they've been doing it for years they got

705
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:37,919
a few symptoms they're not so so sick

706
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:40,960
yet but they've been told they've had a

707
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:43,480
thyroid imbalance adrenal issues

708
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,640
hormones are imbalanced they're not

709
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:47,440
really really sick but they've had

710
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:49,960
enough doctor visits throughout the

711
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,559
years they got nutritionists they care

712
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:53,640
about their health they care about their

713
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:55,440
well-being they look at everything out

714
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:58,000
there that's healthy they're always

715
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:59,960
reading things they get books all of

716
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,440
this but they don't have a neurological

717
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,919
disease they're not suffering from

718
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,760
something neurological where they're

719
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:07,519
bedridden or a mattress Island they're

720
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,480
living their life they're running around

721
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:11,720
they're hitting juice bars they're

722
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:14,360
hitting vegan restaurants they're eating

723
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:16,760
some animal products once in a while

724
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:18,440
they do back and forth they're always

725
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:21,679
trying to look for the new trend and the

726
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:23,720
new thing but it's still not working for

727
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,919
them they have a problem they know

728
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:28,320
they're not healing they know they're

729
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:31,120
not improving they're saying to

730
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:32,720
themselves is this as good as it gets

731
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,360
these are the people that do peanut

that too beans they'll play around with

741
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000

have some type of soy product or another

746
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:13,200
smoothie with protein powder in it and

747
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:15,880
some Nut Butter they pride in eating

748
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,679
healthier options they got experience in

749
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:19,240
the health realm they've been around

750
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:21,039
they tried a lot of different things

751
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:23,240
some things worked in the moment some

752
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:25,039
things didn't then they got advice from

753
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:26,880
somebody else and tried it it almost

754
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:29,559
worked tried something else but they're

755
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,600
heal just isn't where it should be and

756
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:35,080
then they hear about intermittent

757
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:37,399
fasting and they're like what don't eat

758
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:39,399
so stop my smoothies in the morning stop

759
00:32:37,399 --> 00:32:42,559
my vegetable burritos in the afternoon

760
00:32:39,399 --> 00:32:44,240
all right I'll just give it a try doing

761
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:46,600
it doing it I'm starting to feel a

762
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:49,200
little better my bloating is going down

763
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:52,440
I think I have a little bit more energy

764
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,000
something's working okay I think this is

765
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:57,159
really great I think I found the Holy

766
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Grail this is incredible so the thing

767
00:32:57,159 --> 00:33:01,519
that these two groups of people have in

768
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,600
common is they have a nervous system

769
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:06,720
strong enough to actually handle the

770
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:09,120
caffeine high the caffeine syndrome they

771
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,559
can drink matcha tea green tea they can

772
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:13,919
drink Kombucha Tea which is caffeine

773
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:16,760
they can drink coffee espresso all day

774
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:19,279
long they just don't do water all day

775
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:21,880
long because if they were somebody that

776
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:23,559
was sicker and couldn't handle that much

777
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:25,600
caffeine all day long because they were

778
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:27,600
too sick they had chronic illness

779
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:30,320
neurological problems

780
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:32,799
and they just did water only they would

781
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:35,039
never survive it you wouldn't function

782
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:37,080
from water from the time you wake up

783
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:39,240
till the time you almost go to bed

784
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:42,440
basically and then you eat then it

785
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:45,760
wouldn't be enough calories enough blood

786
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:47,799
sugar glucose to keep you going but

787
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,559
these two groups of people have a strong

788
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:52,039
enough nervous system they didn't get

789
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:54,679
sick enough yet so they're able to

790
00:33:52,039 --> 00:33:57,519
partake in the hack thinking it's the

791
00:33:54,679 --> 00:34:00,279
Holy Grail it's moving them forward and

792
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:01,760
then it all crashes down the road later

793
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:03,679
now there are a bunch of people out

794
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,760
there that can't go that long they can't

795
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:08,359
go to the end of the day till almost

796
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:10,800
night time before they go to bed they

797
00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:14,560
have to start eating at 2 they have to

798
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:17,440
start eating at 4: or 3: or six the

799
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:20,399
latest because they don't have a

800
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:23,760
constitution like some other people do

801
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:26,599
that's why the oniz fits-all gang

802
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,520
doesn't realize everybody has a

803
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:31,159
different problem a different Health

804
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:34,960
State a different mental state no one's

805
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:37,200
all the same but they create a trend to

806
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:39,480
try to package it up as everybody's the

807
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:41,919
same everybody can do this you can do

808
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:43,919
this tomorrow but it's not really true

809
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:46,960
or accurate there's people that have

810
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:48,440
panic attacks by 1:00 in the afternoon 2

811
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,599
o'clock in the afternoon and they have

812
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:53,200
to back out of intermittent fasting they

813
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:55,159
have to quit because it's cranking up

814
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:57,599
their anxiety and their nervous system

815
00:34:55,159 --> 00:35:00,240
and their constitution isn't is the same

816
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:03,640
as somebody else the reason why a lot of

817
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:06,280
people say try it it works for me see if

818
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:09,720
it works for you cuz it doesn't always

819
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:11,680
work for you that's why it's a crapshoot

820
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:14,720
it's a guessing game because you don't

821
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:17,520
know what state that person really is in

822
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:19,480
there's people they fall apart by 11:00

823
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:22,160
in the morning if they don't get some

824
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:23,720
type of fuel in them and then there's

825
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:27,480
people that are under a lot of mental

826
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:31,440
stress they're under enormous pressure

827
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:32,839
they have needs their system needs more

828
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,000
and then there's people that have like

829
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:38,079
two or three jobs at once really

830
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,520
demanding work they work really hard

831
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:42,839
morning till night they need a lot of

832
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:45,560
fuel for their brain they need a lot of

833
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:48,280
blood glucose they can't just stop

834
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:50,480
eating and only be on coffee that might

835
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:53,200
last for a little while but after a week

836
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:55,760
or two they'll bottom out they'll crash

837
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,960
they'll hit the wall and then maybe

838
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,880
there's somebody that doesn't have have

839
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,599
a lot of Demands doesn't have a lot of

840
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:03,240
work they're into self-care only because

841
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:04,920
they have all the time in the world they

842
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:07,000
wake up in the morning and it's all

843
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:09,319
about their personal self-care they

844
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,640
don't have to go out do a real demanding

845
00:36:09,319 --> 00:36:14,880
job maybe they have a lot of resources a

846
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:17,240
lot of money and what tires them out is

847
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,599
they take vacations all the time that

848
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:21,920
person might be able to sit around all

849
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:24,839
day keep themselves busy go do

850
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,880
appointments but on caffeine only like

851
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:28,720
that's all they need is caffeine at

852
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,480
least till 3:00 in the afternoon 4: in

853
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:33,920
the afternoon and then they can eat

854
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:36,839
something their demands on their brain

855
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:39,079
and what people are asking of them you

856
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:40,920
know like a school teacher with all the

857
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:43,319
students and the students needing help

858
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:44,880
all the time and the faculty and all all

859
00:36:43,319 --> 00:36:46,800
the different things you have to do and

860
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:49,359
the schedule you're on it eventually

861
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:51,440
gets tiring and then that's different

862
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:54,079
it's like you need fuel it's why School

863
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:56,280
teachers are known to actually be like

864
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:58,520
whoa is there donuts ready over there

865
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:00,280
because we need one is there a bagel

866
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:02,880
already we need it you can't just be

867
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:05,400
empty stomach the whole entire day while

868
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,760
you need to have your faculties working

869
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,640
and maybe you're somebody that thinks

870
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:10,920
I'm wrong and that you have a really

871
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,400
busy schedule you know because you're

872
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:14,480
running around you're doing a lot of

873
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,560
things well often what people don't

874
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,560
realize if someone's not working a

875
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,119
really really demanding job but yet

876
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:23,119
they're really busy they're driving

877
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:25,160
around and doing appointments usually

878
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:27,680
it's about self-care so you're being

879
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:29,560
serviced all day long got the massages

880
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:32,040
while someone's working on you you're

881
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:34,160
not working on them so if you're a

882
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:36,160
massage therapist you're going to need

883
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:38,240
some fuel for your brain you can't just

884
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:41,040
be working on four patients in the

885
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:43,560
morning four clients massaging them

886
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:45,040
really hard hearing all their questions

887
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,520
giving them all these beautiful things

888
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:49,400
you're saying and affirmations you're

889
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:52,200
telling them giving them light and love

890
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:54,000
working on them that's demanding you

891
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,960
need fuel for the brain so if you're

892
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,960
intermittent fasting as a massage

893
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:59,760
therapist you might eventually bottom

894
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:02,160
out and hit the wall but the person

895
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:05,680
who's getting serviced that person

896
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:08,040
getting self-care they're receiving all

897
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:10,040
that they can be on caffeine all day

898
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:12,040
many of them if they have a constitution

899
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:13,319
and they weren't that ill they can do

900
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:15,640
their appointments they can get their

901
00:38:13,319 --> 00:38:17,880
nails done and they could be serviced

902
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:20,720
all day it's like your nails done your

903
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:22,359
massages your facials then your doctor

904
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,680
appointments your doctor's working for

905
00:38:22,359 --> 00:38:26,040
you they're saying hey you know this is

906
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:28,319
what you need and you just sit there

907
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:30,240
okay I stand and you leave or your hair

908
00:38:28,319 --> 00:38:32,520
appointments they're working on your

909
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:35,319
hair now you're not the hair dresser

910
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:37,800
who's standing up for 12 hours a day

911
00:38:35,319 --> 00:38:39,960
trying to work on people if they're on

912
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:42,079
caffeine only every single day until

913
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:44,000
6:00 at night they're eventually going

914
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:45,440
to burn out cuz they need glucose for

915
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,960
the brain and they're going to hit the

916
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,280
wall but if you're sitting there getting

917
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:51,599
your hair done you're being serviced and

918
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:54,359
a lot of people who have a lot of money

919
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:56,760
and they have the resources and they can

920
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:59,040
travel and they can do all these things

921
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:00,960
they're constantly being serviced so

922
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:03,440
they can just focus on their self-care

923
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:05,920
maybe try intermittent fasting hold back

924
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:09,119
meals because they can focus on that

925
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:13,000
it's a big difference once again the one

926
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:14,800
siiz fits all method fails it's failure

927
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,200
failure failure the industry and the

928
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:19,680
trends they're all one size fits-all I

929
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:22,480
can say it it's the truth I know it

930
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:25,640
pisses somebody off but it's the truth

931
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:28,760
it always has been the industry is a

932
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:31,280
onside fits all model like take a

933
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:33,440
hairdresser get a hairdresser she's

934
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:35,560
standing on her feet or he's standing on

935
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:38,920
his feet for 12 straight hours

936
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:41,920
counseling the clients therapy

937
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:45,160
hairdressers do therapy on their clients

938
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:48,480
it's not just cutting hair they actually

939
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:52,280
counsel them many hairdressers should be

940
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:55,000
paid like psychiatrist fees and think

941
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:57,640
about all that and then it's all the

942
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,319
chemicals they're under too hairdressers

943
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:02,599
have to inhale all the chemicals and

944
00:40:00,319 --> 00:40:05,680
that gets in their bloodstream they need

945
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:08,079
blood sugar to defend themselves not to

946
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,640
mention it's a physically demanding job

947
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:11,680
their needs are going to be different

948
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:14,680
than someone else especially if the

949
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:17,599
hairdresser isn't well or has already

950
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:20,480
Health compromises the game changes

951
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:24,319
again same thing for a school teacher

952
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:26,839
massage therapist bus driver or a doctor

953
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:29,640
that's actually working a doctor that

954
00:40:26,839 --> 00:40:31,960
actually has a practice a busy practice

955
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:34,960
demanding practice they're there at the

956
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:36,920
office they walk in they see the patient

957
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,599
they walk out they walk in they see the

958
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:40,760
next patient and the next patient

959
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:42,960
they're working doctors why am I saying

960
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:44,680
that because there's doctors that are

961
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,880
claiming the intermittent fasting

962
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:49,319
program worked great for them but

963
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:51,079
they're not practicing doctors there's

964
00:40:49,319 --> 00:40:52,920
thousands of them out there now they're

965
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:55,640
on the internet they're YouTube doctors

966
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:57,359
they're podcast doctors they don't work

967
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:59,880
they have a team team of people working

968
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:02,160
for them for their social media they

969
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:04,079
have money they're using money for ads

970
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:07,880
and advertisements they're running an

971
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:10,160
entire Empire they don't work on people

972
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:12,280
they don't have to counsel people

973
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:14,560
therapy with people they don't have to

974
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:16,400
give people bad news about their health

975
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:18,160
they don't have to do anything they're

976
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,680
not working with people anymore the

977
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:23,800
demand changes so the doctor who's on

978
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:25,599
his feet all day who has a busy practice

979
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:27,960
may not be good with the intermittent

980
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:30,200
fasting program on caffeine the entire

981
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:33,800
day they might have to have lunch but

982
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:36,000
the podcast doctor or say doctor that

983
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:37,720
wants become famous and wants to be a

984
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,359
social media doctor but not work a

985
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:42,160
practice anymore that doctor is working

986
00:41:40,359 --> 00:41:44,640
on their self-care they're doing their

987
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:46,240
little ice baths and their cold baths

988
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,359
and their cold showers and they're

989
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:50,480
breathing and their meditation and

990
00:41:48,359 --> 00:41:52,160
they're doing their exercise program

991
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,680
they're eating the way they want they're

992
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,480
focused on their foods and they can do

993
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:57,160
their intermittent fasting too because

994
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:59,520
they're not working

995
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:02,240
now to understand intermittent fasting

996
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:06,040
and how it's flawed you have to start

997
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:07,720
with the name intermittent fasting now

998
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:10,480
if everybody is supposed to be such

999
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:12,240
experts like you're counting on Experts

1000
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,640
like you are like you're thinking well

1001
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:16,800
I'm putting my health in your hands so

1002
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:20,480
you're obviously an expert intermittent

1003
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:23,720
fasting Empires so you obviously must

1004
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:26,520
know science uh many of you have degrees

1005
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:29,920
so I'm putting my health in your hand my

1006
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:31,760
life in your hand well to start with

1007
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:35,359
here's how it's flawed it says

1008
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:37,800
intermittent fasting well the body's not

1009
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:40,280
fasting just because you skip breakfast

1010
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:43,960
you're not fasting just because you skip

1011
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:47,240
lunch you're still not fasting just

1012
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:49,599
because you skip dinner it doesn't mean

1013
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:52,240
you're fasting either you're just

1014
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:55,480
intermittent eating you're not

1015
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:59,359
intermittent fasting you're intermittent

1016
00:42:55,480 --> 00:43:04,319
eating the body is not fasting unless

1017
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:07,520
you've gone 24 hours without any kind of

1018
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:12,880
carbohydrate any kind of fuel source and

1019
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:16,800
even 24 hours is a little edgy 24 hours

1020
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:20,720
and 1 second is even better the 1 second

1021
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:24,520
after the 24 hours you see our body

1022
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:27,359
isn't in fast mode until the sun

1023
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:31,800
rises and then the Sun sun rises

1024
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:34,800
again the sun rises you're not eating

1025
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:38,160
you go all the way till the sun rises

1026
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:41,599
again and you haven't eaten yet that's

1027
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:46,760
when the body starts its fasting mode

1028
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:50,599
when the Sun rises our brain expects to

1029
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:53,240
receive food at some point and if you

1030
00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:56,640
don't eat in the morning right when the

1031
00:43:53,240 --> 00:44:00,680
Sun rises and you eat later

1032
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:04,839
our brain is still expecting to receive

1033
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:06,800
Food it's the daytime our brain is

1034
00:44:04,839 --> 00:44:10,839
active we're

1035
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:14,880
alive we're not sleeping brain is in in

1036
00:44:10,839 --> 00:44:15,680
shutdown mode requiring less glucose

1037
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,920
it's

1038
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:21,680
awake as it's waiting for food and it

1039
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:22,400
doesn't receive it it sends a message to

1040
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:25,040
your

1041
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:27,599
adrenals and your adrenals start

1042
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:29,800
releasing ad adrenaline cuz there isn't

1043
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:31,800
any glucose for your brain because

1044
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:34,880
you're not eating first thing in the

1045
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:38,119
morning you're waiting so adrenaline

1046
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:40,880
Rises it takes the place of glucose it's

1047
00:44:38,119 --> 00:44:43,079
not a great thing but it's doing it

1048
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:46,079
because your brain is waiting and the

1049
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:49,040
glucose is what your brain really needs

1050
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:50,480
so the brain uses the adrenaline as a

1051
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:53,200
glucose

1052
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:55,760
substitute as the day goes on you start

1053
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:59,000
heading to noon Sun's at its highest

1054
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:02,559
point Point your brain is still not

1055
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:06,599
receiving glucose so more adrenaline's

1056
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:09,240
produced as a substitute for the glucose

1057
00:45:06,599 --> 00:45:11,839
your brain is hungry though it's

1058
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:14,920
starving for glucose it's looking for

1059
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:18,359
glucose but as the day goes on there's

1060
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:22,000
no glucose yet there's no food your

1061
00:45:18,359 --> 00:45:24,520
adrenaline's pumping adrenaline's Rising

1062
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,400
adrenaline's getting to the brain to get

1063
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:29,040
the brain by

1064
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:31,640
as night time comes the brain is

1065
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:35,280
thinking it's going to be fed again

1066
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:38,200
because the Sun is setting the brain is

1067
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:42,119
thinking surely I'm going to get my

1068
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:46,000
glucose but if you don't eat for dinner

1069
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:49,160
and you go to bed your brain shuts down

1070
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,359
when morning comes again and the Sun

1071
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:54,119
starts

1072
00:45:50,359 --> 00:45:58,119
Rising your brain doesn't activate your

1073
00:45:54,119 --> 00:46:02,839
adrenals anymore right at the 24-hour

1074
00:45:58,119 --> 00:46:05,880
Mark the brain shuts down the adrenaline

1075
00:46:02,839 --> 00:46:08,640
needs it stops the adrenals from running

1076
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:11,920
and shooting adrenaline out the brain

1077
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:14,359
has decided it's not going to be fed so

1078
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:17,400
it goes into almost like a sleep mode

1079
00:46:14,359 --> 00:46:21,440
even though you're awake it's a fasting

1080
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:25,040
mode it's the 24-hour Mark it's from

1081
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:27,119
sunrise to Sunrise you're not running on

1082
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:29,680
straight adrenaline anymore you're in

1083
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:32,760
fasting mode that means time to lay

1084
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:35,079
around if you want to fast if the person

1085
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:38,680
is trying to fast it's time to lay

1086
00:46:35,079 --> 00:46:41,520
around not work hard not drive around

1087
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:43,640
not do anything not think too hard your

1088
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:46,200
brain doesn't have the fuel it needs

1089
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:48,880
you're actually in fasting mode now

1090
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:51,440
that's why intermittent fasting is not

1091
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:53,800
intermittent fasting you never fast

1092
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:57,400
you're not fasting you're intermittent

1093
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:59,000
eating the real name is more like that

1094
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:01,640
maybe the better name would be

1095
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:04,760
recklessly eating because that's really

1096
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:06,839
what it is why is it Reckless because

1097
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:09,119
you're killing your adrenals and you're

1098
00:47:06,839 --> 00:47:11,040
starving your brain at the wrong time

1099
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:14,240
see when the brain is really in fast

1100
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:17,559
mode when you've gone 24 hours on water

1101
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:20,920
only no calories of any kind not even

1102
00:47:17,559 --> 00:47:24,119
lemon not even lemon or lemon water that

1103
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:26,680
would stop the body from fasting it has

1104
00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:30,040
to be 24 hours

1105
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:33,079
only water for the brain to realize

1106
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:37,280
we're in fasting mode it has to be

1107
00:47:33,079 --> 00:47:38,240
sunrise to Sunrise and 1 second after

1108
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:42,200
the

1109
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:45,079
sunrise this way the adrenals shut down

1110
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:47,680
and the Brain protects you this internal

1111
00:47:45,079 --> 00:47:51,359
mechanism inside the body when we truly

1112
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:52,280
are fasting intermittent fasting Trend

1113
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:55,559
it's the

1114
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:58,359
opposite people who actually are experts

1115
00:47:55,559 --> 00:48:00,920
in in intermittent fasting the science

1116
00:47:58,359 --> 00:48:02,960
Buffs or the expert Buffs or the people

1117
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:05,760
that are out there promoting it and

1118
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:07,800
doing it and think they're actually

1119
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:10,720
doing a service for so many people out

1120
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:12,760
there don't realize this they don't know

1121
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:15,000
about this internal mechanism they don't

1122
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:17,240
know how the brain works they don't know

1123
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:20,280
what's happening to the adrenals so when

1124
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:22,839
you intermit and fast the trendy way

1125
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:25,240
you're not really fasting instead you're

1126
00:48:22,839 --> 00:48:29,160
running on adrenaline you're robbing

1127
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:31,920
Peter to pay Paul over and over and over

1128
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:34,040
again until it all start to crumble how

1129
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:36,160
did say crumble well there's not going

1130
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:37,760
to be a study on how it crumbles no

1131
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,160
one's going to really know no one's

1132
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:41,640
going to know anything but I'll give you

1133
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:44,400
a couple little pieces of information

1134
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:46,359
say you're a woman you're young you want

1135
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,680
to get pregnant someday you're planning

1136
00:48:46,359 --> 00:48:50,960
on having a baby when you're 30 that's

1137
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:54,119
the time frame you're kind of like

1138
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:55,359
projecting and then or manifesting maybe

1139
00:48:54,119 --> 00:48:57,119
you're manifesting I'm going to have

1140
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:59,680
children children when I'm 30 that's the

1141
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:02,000
right time for me and then you're

1142
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:04,960
intermittent fasting for a few years

1143
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:07,160
before that happens and you're burning

1144
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:09,240
out your adrenals you can't quite tell

1145
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:11,760
because you're so caffeinated you're

1146
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:14,240
caffeinated continuously you got the

1147
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:15,920
stimulants going maybe you're not doing

1148
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:18,359
intermittent fasting every single day

1149
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:21,640
perfectly maybe it's a few times a week

1150
00:49:18,359 --> 00:49:23,960
it still chips away what happens is the

1151
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:27,920
adrenals start to break down they start

1152
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:32,559
to lose the precious reserves they need

1153
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:36,000
and women need adrenaline to give birth

1154
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:38,920
a baby just doesn't pop out it's

1155
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:42,520
adrenaline that allows that to happen

1156
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:45,079
adrenaline saturates a mom's entire

1157
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:47,240
nervous system central nervous system

1158
00:49:45,079 --> 00:49:51,400
and every single nerve in the body so

1159
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:54,799
that the baby gets projected out so the

1160
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:57,680
strength is there the core the chi if

1161
00:49:54,799 --> 00:50:00,000
you want to use that word that inner

1162
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:02,559
strength it's there because of

1163
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,160
adrenaline and you need those strong

1164
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:07,359
adrenals what happens with a lot of moms

1165
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:08,440
their adrenals are already toasted

1166
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:10,520
sometimes they're toasted by their

1167
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:12,559
second baby or their third baby they

1168
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:16,040
have to have C-sections or they have

1169
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:18,559
really difficult births because their

1170
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:20,559
adrenals were not where they needed to

1171
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:22,720
be and then they were fatigued

1172
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:24,880
afterwards and their adrenals were

1173
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:27,119
missing hormones and then the hair fell

1174
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:29,119
out a couple years later and they had

1175
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:31,680
other problems your health starts to

1176
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:34,440
deteriorate as you go on down the road

1177
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:37,040
intermittent fasting I'm not saying

1178
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:40,440
makes all that happen but it's a big

1179
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:42,000
contributor to that adrenal weakness and

1180
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:45,160
then you got the liver problem that

1181
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:47,880
occurs the liver has to absorb and

1182
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:50,200
sponge up all that adrenaline that free

1183
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:53,319
radical adrenaline that's floating

1184
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:56,680
around the bloodstream constantly see

1185
00:50:53,319 --> 00:50:59,640
adrenaline is a threat to the brain long

1186
00:50:56,680 --> 00:51:01,920
term the brain is just sending a signal

1187
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:04,520
like I want to be fed there's no blood

1188
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:07,079
sugar to be found there's no glucose not

1189
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:09,760
enough glucose to be found so I have to

1190
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:12,200
send a signal to the adrenals and get

1191
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:14,559
some adrenaline out to feed me for the

1192
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:18,040
moment but it's only temporary for a

1193
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:21,000
couple of hours then I need to be fed

1194
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:22,960
but couple hours goes by and nothing's

1195
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,559
happening there's no glucose someone's

1196
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:26,400
not eating because they're sitting there

1197
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:28,440
with their conscious ious their

1198
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:30,559
Consciousness is being trained by the

1199
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:33,920
intermittent fasting people to withhold

1200
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:36,280
the food so that Consciousness is saying

1201
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:38,960
no hold back from food meanwhile the

1202
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:41,240
brain is like don't do that to me I need

1203
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:44,359
the food what are you doing I need that

1204
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:46,920
glucose and fuel so the brain says sends

1205
00:51:44,359 --> 00:51:50,160
a signal and the adrenals are releasing

1206
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:52,200
that adrenaline but time is passing too

1207
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:54,040
much time is passing it's becoming a

1208
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:57,079
threat to the brain now because that

1209
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:59,640
adrenaline is getting getting old it's

1210
00:51:57,079 --> 00:52:01,960
being released it becomes toxic after a

1211
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:04,799
while the brain is like whoo we need

1212
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:06,680
glucose fast we need fuel fast it's not

1213
00:52:04,799 --> 00:52:09,640
coming and then the liver becomes a

1214
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:12,280
sponge it soaks up all that adrenaline

1215
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:14,640
from the morning from not eating all

1216
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:17,200
that adrenaline from early afternoon

1217
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:19,720
from not eating and then more adrenaline

1218
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:22,000
is released all over again it's this

1219
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:25,040
vicious cycle the brain becomes

1220
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:27,599
desperate by 2:00 in the afternoon 3:00

1221
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:30,359
in the afternoon and it's triggering the

1222
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:33,319
adrenals sending a signal to release

1223
00:52:30,359 --> 00:52:35,680
more adrenaline the liver's already been

1224
00:52:33,319 --> 00:52:38,400
overburdened it's already sponging and

1225
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:40,960
sucking up all that other adrenaline all

1226
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:43,640
day long now more adrenaline is being

1227
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:45,280
released and the brain is becoming more

1228
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:47,440
desperate by the minute and more

1229
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:49,839
desperate by the minute and then people

1230
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:51,720
who are intermittent fasting are

1231
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:54,040
actually prompting their adrenals more

1232
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:56,559
and more beyond all this because they're

1233
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:58,960
bringing in caffeine remember black

1234
00:52:56,559 --> 00:53:01,079
coffee no calories in there you're not

1235
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:02,440
allowed to have sugar in your coffee

1236
00:53:01,079 --> 00:53:04,160
when you're intermittent fasting well

1237
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:06,359
that's the rules anyway I'm sure people

1238
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:09,119
break the rules into do different things

1239
00:53:06,359 --> 00:53:10,839
but the rules are you can't have a sugar

1240
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:13,400
in there you can't have cream in there

1241
00:53:10,839 --> 00:53:16,480
either you have to have black coffee or

1242
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:17,599
espressos Black Coffee iced coffee but

1243
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:21,000
it's got to be something like that

1244
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:23,920
you're allowed that maybe tea matcha tea

1245
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:26,359
but no cream and sugar no calories for

1246
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:29,640
the brain on any level no glucose for

1247
00:53:26,359 --> 00:53:32,240
the brain now hm you get energy from

1248
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:34,280
that caffeine from that black coffee

1249
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:36,280
how's that possible caffeine doesn't

1250
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:40,319
give us energy because it's not an

1251
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:43,640
energy source caffeine is not a glucose

1252
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:47,440
it's not a calor but yet it goes to the

1253
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:49,559
brain and doesn't give us energy even

1254
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:52,000
though it does what does that mean how

1255
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:56,160
does it work I'll tell you how it's a

1256
00:53:52,000 --> 00:54:00,599
stimulant it makes the brain scream

1257
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:03,960
help me to your adrenals caffeine is a

1258
00:54:00,599 --> 00:54:05,480
drug it prompts the adrenals flooding

1259
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:08,119
your body with

1260
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:11,680
adrenaline that's what it does you get

1261
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:14,559
energy from caffeine what no not from

1262
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:17,160
caffeine you get energy from what the

1263
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:21,359
caffeine's doing to your brain and

1264
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:23,240
adrenals and that energy is fake energy

1265
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:27,319
because it's coming from instead of a

1266
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:31,160
fuel or food source it's coming from the

1267
00:54:27,319 --> 00:54:34,760
depths of your body and its reserves

1268
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:36,760
your body's precious energy source it's

1269
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:38,839
not energy that you should have messed

1270
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:40,920
with it's not energy that should have

1271
00:54:38,839 --> 00:54:45,359
been played with it shouldn't have been

1272
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:48,079
played it's your deep deep resource it's

1273
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:50,079
what keeps us going it's the resource we

1274
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:53,119
have inside our organs in our body it

1275
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:55,240
needs to be preserved for the rainy days

1276
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:57,799
for the hardships and things that come

1277
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:59,680
away for the stress the confrontations

1278
00:54:57,799 --> 00:55:02,359
it's there for other reasons for

1279
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:04,280
childbirth it's there for stressful

1280
00:55:02,359 --> 00:55:05,799
situations it's there for a car accident

1281
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:07,920
it's there for a fender bender it's

1282
00:55:05,799 --> 00:55:09,760
there for something that you're up

1283
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:11,480
against it's there for that relationship

1284
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:13,400
breakup it's there for when the

1285
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:14,599
boyfriend breaks up with the girlfriend

1286
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:17,160
the girlfriend breaks up with the

1287
00:55:14,599 --> 00:55:19,400
boyfriend and they're just in agony it's

1288
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:21,920

people are up against it's there for all

1291
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:28,559
the different things that people in this

1292
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:31,079
world struggle with it's there for when

1293
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:33,119
you're told that you're a bad person

1294
00:55:31,079 --> 00:55:34,960
when you're not a bad person it's there

1295
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:37,520
for all these different upsets

1296
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:39,880
emotionally and physically that's your

1297
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:42,760
precious reserves it's there to protect

1298
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:45,440
you and guess what we're throwing it all

1299
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:47,640
away because of a bad idea now your

1300
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:50,440
adrenals produce a lot of your hormones

1301
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:52,720
reproductive hormones too women's

1302
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:54,640
reproductive hormones and in the

1303
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:56,559
Alternative Health industry it's all

1304
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:58,400
about hormones lately everybody's

1305
00:55:56,559 --> 00:56:00,280
worried about their hormones everybody's

1306
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:02,640
going to their doctors they're getting

1307
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:04,640
all their hormone profiles they're

1308
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:07,039
looking into everything they're worried

1309
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:08,960
about the hormones reproductive hormones

1310
00:56:07,039 --> 00:56:11,640
all kinds of hormones thyroid hormones

1311
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:15,319
everything and then we're intermittent

1312
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:17,839
fasting and we're damaging and injuring

1313
00:56:15,319 --> 00:56:20,319
one of our most profound hormone

1314
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:22,839
producers which is the adrenals and then

1315
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:25,200
wait all that intermittent fasting isn't

1316
00:56:22,839 --> 00:56:27,200
good for the liver it's not great

1317
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:29,520
because the liver has to absorb all that

1318
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:32,359
adrenaline all day long and that

1319
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:35,559
caffeine too and it starts to slowly

1320
00:56:32,359 --> 00:56:38,440
hinder the liver the liver is a hormone

1321
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:40,400
producer as well but wait a minute I get

1322
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:44,160
it you're somebody that's like you're

1323
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:45,799
wrong totally wrong ew I know somebody

1324
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:47,640
their blood work looks better from their

1325
00:56:45,799 --> 00:56:49,280
intermittent fasting they got a good

1326
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:52,520
doctor they're looking at all their

1327
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:54,200
stats and levels and I I went and did it

1328
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:55,400
too and my blood work looks a little

1329
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:57,160
better too

1330
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:58,240
I'm feeling a little better as well I

1331
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:01,039
just don't think you know what you're

1332
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:04,559
talking about but see those results are

1333
00:57:01,039 --> 00:57:07,280
a snapshot in time that's what it is

1334
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:09,799
temporary results for cleaning up

1335
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:12,079
cleaning up what once was not great

1336
00:57:09,799 --> 00:57:14,760
lifestyle right all the different heavy

1337
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:18,079
fatty foods in the morning or fatty

1338
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:19,920
foods at lunchtime maybe processed foods

1339
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:22,559
a lot of people they do intermittent

1340
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:25,160
fasting they come off the ride they come

1341
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:27,160
off of the fast foods they come off the

1342
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:29,559
pizzas they come off of the burgers the

1343
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:31,280
lunches people know what it's like to

1344
00:57:29,559 --> 00:57:33,920
eat a pizza for lunch you know what it's

1345
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:35,839
like right remember those days remember

1346
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:37,880
have a pizza for lunch you have more

1347
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:40,240
than a few slices and now you're just

1348
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:41,920
like half asleep and maybe you eat

1349
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:44,599
better than that and it's not about

1350
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:46,680
pizzas but the reason why people get

1351
00:57:44,599 --> 00:57:50,240
results with the intermittent fasting

1352
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:53,720
the real reason is because they stopped

1353
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:56,240
the fats and that's why they get results

1354
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:59,960
like blood sugar sugar gets better as

1355
00:57:56,240 --> 00:58:02,559
far as the A1C pre-diabetes can start to

1356
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:05,160
calm down maybe they feel a little bit

1357
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:07,760
more energy for the moment but either

1358
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:09,680
way they're getting some results and

1359
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:12,880
they're getting results in their blood

1360
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:15,079
test because they lowered the fats but

1361
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:18,240
not just lowered the fats they stopped

1362
00:58:15,079 --> 00:58:22,720
them but here's the tricky part that's

1363
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:25,240
quick results those are quick it's hack

1364
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:27,760
results we get in trouble later

1365
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:31,079
because it's not sustainable bigger

1366
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:33,480
problems happen later brain problems

1367
00:58:31,079 --> 00:58:36,559
neurotransmitter chemical problems

1368
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:39,000
neuron problems gal cell problems

1369
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:42,599
adrenal problems central nervous system

1370
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:45,799
problems liver problems all these things

1371
00:58:42,599 --> 00:58:48,280
develop later it's sometimes Fast 6

1372
00:58:45,799 --> 00:58:50,400
months blood test looks good doctor's

1373
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:52,400
kind of happy everything's hey you're

1374
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:56,000
intermittent fasting you're doing better

1375
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:57,839
you're exercising oh wait a minute why

1376
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:00,000
are these liver enzymes up all of a

1377
00:58:57,839 --> 00:59:02,079
sudden this is strange eight months

1378
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,720
later oh it can't be the intermittent

1379
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:07,000
fasting because it was giving you

1380
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:09,280
results see the psych out the psych out

1381
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:11,480
is you get these quick results for a lot

1382
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:15,400
of people but all these other problems

1383
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:18,440
happen later but because we got some

1384
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:22,079
results from the start it's referenced

1385
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:24,760
so the doctor has it on his sheet and he

1386
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:26,720
references it can't be the intermittent

1387
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:30,079
fasting that's making your health go

1388
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:32,960
downhill now sir or ma'am because we

1389
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:34,880
have on record that you were improving

1390
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:38,039
from the intermittent fasting from the

1391
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:42,520
start so a year later we're seeing these

1392
00:59:38,039 --> 00:59:44,079
other problems happening like brain fog

1393
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:46,880
confusion

1394
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:50,599
anxiety Panic

1395
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:53,240
depression other issues too and then

1396
00:59:50,599 --> 00:59:55,559
we're seeing things change but it can't

1397
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:58,720
be the intermittent fasting because it

1398
00:59:55,559 --> 01:00:02,319
showed on record it was concrete there

1399
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:04,319
were benefits you actually were healing

1400
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:06,280
something was changing we were seeing

1401
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:08,720
results and that's where the psych out

1402
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:11,400
is the psych out is is you get these

1403
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:14,720
quick hack results but nobody realizes

1404
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:17,200
the consequences that happen later the

1405
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:19,160
ramifications that occur later and

1406
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:21,799
nobody knows and the later doesn't have

1407
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:24,319
to be 10 years like oh 10 years down the

1408
01:00:21,799 --> 01:00:26,000
road that's when something will happen

1409
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:28,160
well I'll rather just do this for the

1410
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,200
next 10 years and worry about it then no

1411
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:32,599
it can happen six months two months

1412
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:35,520
later a year later three three years

1413
01:00:32,599 --> 01:00:38,079
later 10 years later for sure but it

1414
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:41,280
happens I know what you're thinking

1415
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:43,599
there's real science behind this like

1416
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:46,079
there's science there's professionals

1417
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:49,400
well there's Empires built on it lots of

1418
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:51,720
professionals involved in it now and I'm

1419
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:54,160
really Off the Mark let's talk about the

1420
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:56,839
benefits now that so-called science

1421
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:59,680
stands stands by and how intermittent

1422
01:00:56,839 --> 01:01:01,480
fasting is so beneficial so let's go

1423
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:03,799
through some of the claims that are out

1424
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:05,680
there like the claims that seem to be

1425
01:01:03,799 --> 01:01:09,359
hardcore where they hang their hat on

1426
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:13,359
them okay here's one reduce insulin

1427
01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:15,440
resistance well scratching my head here

1428
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:18,640
if you don't eat in the

1429
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:21,839
morning you're not going to have high

1430
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:25,000
insulin resistance because there was no

1431
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:28,440
food eaten in the morning so therefore

1432
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:32,680
the pancreas didn't release

1433
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:35,559
insulin therefore there wasn't insulin

1434
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:39,280
resistance and then I wonder since I've

1435
01:01:35,559 --> 01:01:42,920
been talking about that for 35 years and

1436
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:45,760
published it almost 10 years ago that if

1437
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:47,559
you keep the fats out in the morning you

1438
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:50,280
don't have the insulin resistance and

1439
01:01:47,559 --> 01:01:52,960
I'm wondering did they get it from there

1440
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:55,160
or if they did discover it themselves

1441
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:57,480
recently fine

1442
01:01:55,160 --> 01:02:00,039
but at the same time it's not rocket

1443
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:02,440
science it's not hard to figure this one

1444
01:02:00,039 --> 01:02:04,240
out if you don't eat in the morning your

1445
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:06,039
pancreas isn't going to produce all that

1446
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:08,440
insulin you're going to have lower

1447
01:02:06,039 --> 01:02:11,279
insulin production less insulin

1448
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:12,720
resistance and yes they're correct

1449
01:02:11,279 --> 01:02:15,720
there's going to be less insulin

1450
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:18,160
resistance so that claim is correct even

1451
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:19,680
though there's details they're missing

1452
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:21,960
and we'll explore that a little later

1453
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:25,839
let's go to the next benefit that they

1454
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:28,480
claim human growth hormone increases

1455
01:02:25,839 --> 01:02:30,720
that's the claim so they say that human

1456
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:31,599
growth hormone increases and this is a

1457
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:34,240
great

1458
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:37,520
thing yes it does

1459
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:41,000
increase on the blood test but it

1460
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:43,799
doesn't increase at all so let's go into

1461
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:46,200
how and why what they don't realize is

1462
01:02:43,799 --> 01:02:48,760
the same amount of human growth hormone

1463
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:51,480
is being produced but they see more of

1464
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:53,880
it in the blood test and the reason why

1465
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:56,079
they see more human growth hormone is

1466
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:58,400
because the the fats in the bloodstream

1467
01:02:56,079 --> 01:03:00,920
aren't there anymore because the person

1468
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:03,400
stopped eating they're producing the

1469
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:05,680
same amount of human growth hormone as

1470
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:08,880
they always do the difference is there's

1471
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:11,559
no fat to absorb it the fats you eat in

1472
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:14,200
the morning in your breakfast enter the

1473
01:03:11,559 --> 01:03:16,760
bloodstream and choke out the human

1474
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:19,839
growth hormone and they can't see as

1475
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:22,480
much of it on the blood test also the

1476
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:25,079
fat in the blood on the blood test is

1477
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:27,520
harboring it absorbs some of that growth

1478
01:03:25,079 --> 01:03:29,599
hormone and they can't see it either

1479
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:32,319
through that Avenue because it's in the

1480
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:35,160
fat itself they're not testing it in a

1481
01:03:32,319 --> 01:03:38,039
serum in order to determine if that fat

1482
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:39,760
actually Harbors growth hormone but yet

1483
01:03:38,039 --> 01:03:42,319
the same amount of growth hormone is

1484
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:45,119
being produced every day it hasn't been

1485
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:47,319
increased it's the same amount now

1486
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:49,559
science doesn't know the fat is

1487
01:03:47,319 --> 01:03:52,079
harboring growth hormone to even test

1488
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:54,440
for it in the blood because they don't

1489
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:57,079
know it's about removing fat and that's

1490
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:59,799
why people get benefits or improvements

1491
01:03:57,079 --> 01:04:02,359
they think it's just removing food so

1492
01:03:59,799 --> 01:04:04,079
they're not looking at the fat and they

1493
01:04:02,359 --> 01:04:06,400
won't look at the fat as being the

1494
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:09,160
problem because everybody's promoting a

1495
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:11,520
high-fat diet now here's the other piece

1496
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:13,559
they're missing when you take the food

1497
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:16,319
out of the diet in the morning you

1498
01:04:13,559 --> 01:04:19,480
remove the breakfast and you don't eat

1499
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:23,000
the reason why human growth hormone also

1500
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:26,240
elevates is because of a detoxification

1501
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:27,960
process happening when you remove food

1502
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:29,839
specifically the fat which they don't

1503
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:32,720
know but when you remove food in the

1504
01:04:29,839 --> 01:04:36,400
morning you can cleanse that means

1505
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:38,599
you're releasing old outdated hormones

1506
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:40,400
that are deactivated they don't work

1507
01:04:38,599 --> 01:04:42,599
anymore because that's what the human

1508
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:44,960
body does it takes estrogen and

1509
01:04:42,599 --> 01:04:48,359
progesterone and testosterone and it

1510
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:50,359
eliminates it and same with human growth

1511
01:04:48,359 --> 01:04:53,720
hormone it's

1512
01:04:50,359 --> 01:04:56,440
detoxifying out of the liver out of

1513
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:58,720
organs it's hitting the bloodstream and

1514
01:04:56,440 --> 01:05:01,400
you're peeing it out you're eliminating

1515
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:03,599
it out but if you take a blood test

1516
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:06,440
you'll see more of it when you're not

1517
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:08,440
eating more of it will be in the blood

1518
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:11,599
test but they don't know these

1519
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:13,319
differences they just say oh wait look

1520
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:16,240
okay write this down and then they make

1521
01:05:13,319 --> 01:05:19,200
this big claim it increases your human

1522
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:21,520
growth hormone but it's so generalized

1523
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:24,640
the details aren't there it's flawed

1524
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:26,400
science once again one size fits all

1525
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:29,480
the tools they're using like in this

1526
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:32,279
case doing the blood test is still

1527
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:34,319
measuring only one aspect of it but not

1528
01:05:32,279 --> 01:05:36,279
measuring all these other aspects of it

1529
01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:38,960
so the tools they're using are one size

1530
01:05:36,279 --> 01:05:42,440
fits-all tools so let's go to another

1531
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:44,920
intermittent fasting claim cellular

1532
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:46,720
waste removal now this is interesting

1533
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:48,760
because I'm scratching my head right now

1534
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:50,799
the intermittent fasting people the

1535
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:53,720
Empire's built don't believe in

1536
01:05:50,799 --> 01:05:56,319
cleansing they say the body does it

1537
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:59,440
itself and never needs a detox or

1538
01:05:56,319 --> 01:06:01,599
cleanse mm info all these years is all

1539
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:05,599
about cleansing and detoxification of

1540
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:08,559
cells and organs so we can heal and then

1541
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:09,960
presenting tools to help us do that now

1542
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:13,680
they're saying when you intermittent

1543
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:15,520
fast cellular waste removal occurs so

1544
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:17,799
I'm just scratching my head here and I'm

1545
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:22,200
trying to see what this really is and

1546
01:06:17,799 --> 01:06:26,000
it's waste removal um so waste coming

1547
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:29,480
out of a cell what waste that's

1548
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:32,279
detoxification that's cleansing so what

1549
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:34,559
they're saying is your cleansing okay

1550
01:06:32,279 --> 01:06:36,000
now that makes sense in a way because

1551
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:39,559
when you stop

1552
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:41,799
eating you start to cleanse now get this

1553
01:06:39,559 --> 01:06:46,079
though they just think when you stop

1554
01:06:41,799 --> 01:06:48,839
eating food that's not correct really

1555
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:53,240
when you stop eating fats you start to

1556
01:06:48,839 --> 01:06:55,920
cleanse so you can eat fat free food or

1557
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:58,559
food with no over at fats in the morning

1558
01:06:55,920 --> 01:07:00,599
and still cleanse but they don't know

1559
01:06:58,559 --> 01:07:03,720
that which means you can still get

1560
01:07:00,599 --> 01:07:05,520
cellular waste removal the term they use

1561
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:09,039
now because they didn't want to use the

1562
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:11,799
detox term or the cleanse term because

1563
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:14,319
hey they wanted their own term so they

1564
01:07:11,799 --> 01:07:16,200
said let's do waste removal but yet the

1565
01:07:14,319 --> 01:07:18,000
body doesn't need a cleanse and the body

1566
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:20,400
doesn't need a detox we'll still stand

1567
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,680
by that and what they don't realize it's

1568
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:26,000
removing the fat that allows for their

1569
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:29,440
claim cellular waste removal to even

1570
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:31,839
occur not removing food itself if you

1571
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:35,079
eat an orange in the morning you still

1572
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:37,119
will have cleansing power and ability

1573
01:07:35,079 --> 01:07:39,720
you still will have cellular waste

1574
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:42,480
removal if you eat an avocado in the

1575
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:45,039
morning you won't get cellular waste

1576
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:47,240
removal anymore and that's how that

1577
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:50,279
works all right let's go to the next

1578
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:52,240
claim they got cell

1579
01:07:50,279 --> 01:07:55,079
renewal oh

1580
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:56,640
boy all right this is interesting so

1581
01:07:55,079 --> 01:07:59,799
they say sell renewal when you

1582
01:07:56,640 --> 01:08:02,440
intermittent fast okay well if you're

1583
01:07:59,799 --> 01:08:04,839
jacked up on caffeine all day long not

1584
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:07,720
getting any nutrients in you and then

1585
01:08:04,839 --> 01:08:11,000
you top it off with a big sloppy greasy

1586
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:12,480
crappy meal at the end of the day uh I

1587
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,240
don't know how much sell renewal you're

1588
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:17,080
really going to have and here's the

1589
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:19,120
other thing here's the real detail

1590
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:21,400
that's important there's no way to

1591
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:23,400
determine if it's cell renewal they

1592
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:25,960
don't have the tools yet in science

1593
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:28,640
because you will never know the

1594
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:31,199
difference between how much cell die off

1595
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:33,960
you're having and how much cell renewal

1596
01:08:31,199 --> 01:08:36,120
you're having it's impossible to

1597
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:38,640
determine science might be able to

1598
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:41,359
determine it 500 years from now but all

1599
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:44,440
we have is a theory right now because

1600
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:47,600
they can't measure there's no measuring

1601
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:51,480
tool in existence right now that can

1602
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:54,960
measure how many cells are renewing or

1603
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:58,560
being created versus how many cells are

1604
01:08:54,960 --> 01:09:01,600
dying or weakening we don't have that

1605
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:04,120
scientific tool yet it doesn't exist so

1606
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:07,120
what they're doing is theorizing because

1607
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:10,440
it sounds exciting it's like whoa this

1608
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:12,279
creates cell renewal this is amazing and

1609
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:14,960
it's a claim they can make that gets

1610
01:09:12,279 --> 01:09:17,000
everybody excited and no one's going to

1611
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:19,080
really doubt it and anybody in health is

1612
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:21,319
going to be like sell renewal that's

1613
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:24,319
awesome because it hits the whole

1614
01:09:21,319 --> 01:09:25,679
anti-aging live forever Market

1615
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:28,799
can cells

1616
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:30,839
renew yeah but you need something to

1617
01:09:28,799 --> 01:09:33,480
make that happen you need something more

1618
01:09:30,839 --> 01:09:35,640
than caffeine all day and a sloppy meal

1619
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:38,319
at the end of the day you need

1620
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:41,880
antioxidants mineral salts trace

1621
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:45,319
minerals phyto chemical compounds

1622
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:48,159
anthocyanins glucose macrominerals you

1623
01:09:45,319 --> 01:09:51,120
need all of these plus more and you need

1624
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:53,880
them entering the body more than once a

1625
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:56,600
day but most intermittent fasters are

1626
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:58,760
not into the cell renewal game they're

1627
01:09:56,600 --> 01:10:00,880
in the cell destruction game they got

1628
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:03,800
the caffeine cranking all day long they

1629
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:06,600
got the adrenaline pumping all the way

1630
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:09,400
adrenaline is corrosive it's cell

1631
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:12,640
damaging that's what adrenaline does

1632
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:14,800
caffeine cell damaging and the other

1633
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:16,400
problem is they're not eating a pound of

1634
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:17,880
spinach at the end of the day and a

1635
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:19,920
whole bunch of fruit where you're

1636
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:21,960
getting those antioxidants the glucose

1637
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:23,960
and the phytochemical compounds they're

1638
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:26,159
eating a burger they're eating some

1639
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:28,560
chicken they're eating other Foods I'm

1640
01:10:26,159 --> 01:10:30,239
not saying chicken's bad or Burger's bad

1641
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:32,840
or what's good or bad I'm just saying

1642
01:10:30,239 --> 01:10:34,960
there's no Healing Foods there's no

1643
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:37,640
powerful tools there they're not

1644
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:39,440
drinking 32 ounces of celery juice at

1645
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:41,400
the end of the day a pound of spinach

1646
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:43,280
and a whole bunch of asparagus that's

1647
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:45,880
the last thing they're eating now let's

1648
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:50,040
head to their next hypothesis their next

1649
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:53,719
claim beneficial gene expression so gene

1650
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:54,480
expression gets better okay so you get

1651
01:10:53,719 --> 01:10:56,960
better

1652
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:58,640
genes um so what they're saying the

1653
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:03,040
hypothesis is because they haven't seen

1654
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:06,120
it but they think changes to molecules

1655
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:08,719
involved with genes could help with

1656
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:11,600
longevity so it could be related to

1657
01:11:08,719 --> 01:11:13,800
longevity that's the hypothesis now when

1658
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:15,560
you really break it down there's nothing

1659
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:17,920
there at all they don't see anything

1660
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:19,600
they have no scientific proof nothing's

1661
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:22,679
there but it's a great one to kind of

1662
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:25,000
throw into the mix gets people excited

1663
01:11:22,679 --> 01:11:27,400
really nothing to say about it because

1664
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:30,760
it doesn't really exist so there is

1665
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:32,239
nothing to say about it sure if you're

1666
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:34,199
doing something better for your health

1667
01:11:32,239 --> 01:11:36,560
you hope your genes are getting better

1668
01:11:34,199 --> 01:11:38,360
in this case they haven't seen it they

1669
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:41,360
don't know but they're just going to

1670
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:45,040
assume it's even possible okay so here's

1671
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:49,600
our next claim weight loss well all

1672
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:52,360
right um You Take Away food for as many

1673
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:55,000
hours as you can for as much of the day

1674
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:57,719
as you can you eat

1675
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,880
less uh yeah there's going to be a bunch

1676
01:11:57,719 --> 01:12:01,159
of dudes out there that are going to

1677
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:03,199
lose weight and you'll notice out there

1678
01:12:01,159 --> 01:12:05,440
if you talk to enough people they start

1679
01:12:03,199 --> 01:12:09,199
their intermittent fasting program at

1680
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:12,480
the very same moment in time they start

1681
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:14,600
exercising or cranking up their exercise

1682
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:16,719
they're not eating and they're like

1683
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:19,199
starving so then they're like I better

1684
01:12:16,719 --> 01:12:21,040
start exercising keep my anxiety down or

1685
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:22,880
whatever but either way there's

1686
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:25,080
different people doing different things

1687
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:27,040
but most of the time they start both at

1688
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:29,800
the same time of course if you're not

1689
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:31,480
eating anymore and you're exercising

1690
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:33,440
more you're going to start losing some

1691
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:35,679
weight I know there's people who've

1692
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:37,679
already been exercising and they're just

1693
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:39,920
eating whatever their high fat meals and

1694
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:42,120
their normal programs whatever and then

1695
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:43,800
they start to intermittent fast while

1696
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:45,199
they're exercising the same way and

1697
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:47,159
they're losing weight too cuz they

1698
01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:49,159
stopped eating I know there's some

1699
01:12:47,159 --> 01:12:51,520
people out there that are going to say

1700
01:12:49,159 --> 01:12:53,199
no I eat the same amount of calories as

1701
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:56,360
I always have I just eat it at the end

1702
01:12:53,199 --> 01:12:57,960
of the the day and not really cuz you

1703
01:12:56,360 --> 01:12:59,719
don't really remember what you used to

1704
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:01,639
do the binges and the different times

1705
01:12:59,719 --> 01:13:03,400
you used to eat and the different foods

1706
01:13:01,639 --> 01:13:06,000
you didn't have it all down you weren't

1707
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:08,239
measuring every calorie ever now you're

1708
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:11,000
kind of more mindful but no you're

1709
01:13:08,239 --> 01:13:13,080
eating less calories and so many are

1710
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:15,080
trying to control their Cravings so they

1711
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:16,400
like their intermittent fasting program

1712
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:19,120
because they're controlling their

1713
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:20,920
Cravings they're like craving all day

1714
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:22,719
but they're trying to say oh no wait I'm

1715
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:24,719
just going to keep the coffee going in

1716
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:27,400
and I'm going to just keep that under

1717
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:29,040
control and I'm going to reward myself

1718
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:30,600
at the end of the day and I'll eat

1719
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:32,520
whatever I want at the end of the day

1720
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:34,360
but I'll hold back all my Cravings all

1721
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:36,040
day long but here's the other thing

1722
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:40,000
people don't realize their stomach

1723
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:42,280
starts to shrink starts to get smaller

1724
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,400
because they're not eating all day and

1725
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:46,400
they're just doing some different

1726
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:48,199
liquids like say coffee for one right so

1727
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:51,159
by the time of the night time comes or

1728
01:13:48,199 --> 01:13:54,679
the end of the day their big meal isn't

1729
01:13:51,159 --> 01:13:57,360
as big as their meals used to be because

1730
01:13:54,679 --> 01:13:59,480
their stomach is not stretched as much

1731
01:13:57,360 --> 01:14:02,000
so their stomach is shrinking so the

1732
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:03,440
meals aren't as big at the end of the

1733
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,679
day it's another reason why they're

1734
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:09,600
losing weight so yes the claim of losing

1735
01:14:06,679 --> 01:14:12,679
weight is actually real but here's how

1736
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:16,560
it works it's real because you stopped

1737
01:14:12,679 --> 01:14:20,040
eating fat because eating fat makes you

1738
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:23,400
fat fat makes you fat that's how it

1739
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:25,880
works this is why people who do high fat

1740
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:28,920
diets and work out and lost some weight

1741
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:31,320
years ago end up having to go and do

1742
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:32,920
intermittent fasting years later because

1743
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:35,360
they can't keep their weight under

1744
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:37,280
control anymore they're working out they

1745
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:40,080
seem to be doing all the right things

1746
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:42,080
they're eating healthy meals but they're

1747
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:45,040
keeping the fats in they're doing the

1748
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:46,520
nut Butters the lean proteins and

1749
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:47,920
they're having their MCT oil and

1750
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:50,480
everything else but they don't realize

1751
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:52,199
it it's all fat and then they need some

1752
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:54,480
carbs once in a while so they throw

1753
01:14:52,199 --> 01:14:57,360
those in too but they're trying to do it

1754
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:59,320
in a balanced way and it worked for them

1755
01:14:57,360 --> 01:15:01,239
for a while because it got them off the

1756
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:03,520
standard American diet many years ago

1757
01:15:01,239 --> 01:15:05,960
and they became Health experts in a way

1758
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:08,159
they started training they started

1759
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:11,120
exercising and they started doing all

1760
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:13,280
that and then the weight wasn't

1761
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:14,960
controllable anymore and they're like

1762
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:17,239
What's the next phase and they hear

1763
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:19,639
about intermittent fasting so then they

1764
01:15:17,239 --> 01:15:23,440
stop eating all together for most of the

1765
01:15:19,639 --> 01:15:26,600
day because really reality the constant

1766
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:28,760
high fat diet is not sustainable the

1767
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:31,760
constant healthy high fat diet that

1768
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:34,960
everybody's on that gravitates to after

1769
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:37,639
you've been on standard American is not

1770
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:39,600
sustainable so when you grow up you go

1771
01:15:37,639 --> 01:15:41,280
to college or you grow up and you do

1772
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:42,920
whatever and you're getting older and

1773
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:44,480
you're eating standard American you eat

1774
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:46,639
what you want you have your pizza here

1775
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:48,679
you do what you want here and the weight

1776
01:15:46,639 --> 01:15:51,679
is gaining you want to exercise and get

1777
01:15:48,679 --> 01:15:55,000
the weight off and then you go high fat

1778
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:57,320
keto or high fat whatever or some type

1779
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:59,560
of other healthy high-fat diet and you

1780
01:15:57,320 --> 01:16:02,360
say whoa found the Holy Grail I know my

1781
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:05,760
deal I count my macros I'm eating my

1782
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:08,320
proteins I'm eating my fats and then you

1783
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:10,679
start getting sicker or something goes

1784
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:13,000
wrong or weight starts gaining and

1785
01:16:10,679 --> 01:16:15,239
you're like what is going on and you run

1786
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:16,760
into some trainer or some guy at the gym

1787
01:16:15,239 --> 01:16:19,320
who's like you should intermittent fast

1788
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:21,679
man everybody's doing this so now you

1789
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:23,880
leave your high-fat diet which was not

1790
01:16:21,679 --> 01:16:26,080
sustainable and now you head to not

1791
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:27,960
eating at all until the end of the day

1792
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:30,880
and you think you found the Holy Grail

1793
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:33,199
again but you didn't because you hit the

1794
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:35,199
wall when you intermittent fast as well

1795
01:16:33,199 --> 01:16:37,280
it takes time happens at a different

1796
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:39,000
moment for everybody but you end up

1797
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:41,480
hitting the wall you're back to square

1798
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:42,960
one you're eating fats all over again

1799
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:44,480
it's not sustainable then you're

1800
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:46,719
intermittent fasting then you're

1801
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:49,000
vacillating back and forth constantly

1802
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:50,840
intermittent fasting for some weeks then

1803
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:52,679
going back to eating high fat diet

1804
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:54,400
healthy high fat diet for some weeks

1805
01:16:52,679 --> 01:16:56,480
then intermittent fasting and then

1806
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:59,000
you're just rebounding you're going back

1807
01:16:56,480 --> 01:17:01,199
and forth back and forth cravings and

1808
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:03,159
all not getting the things you need and

1809
01:17:01,199 --> 01:17:05,280
you're just running around in circles

1810
01:17:03,159 --> 01:17:07,719
and you're chasing your tail because

1811
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:10,440
both intermittent fasting and a healthy

1812
01:17:07,719 --> 01:17:13,440
high-fat diet are not sustainable long

1813
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:17,320
term so let's cover a couple more claims

1814
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:21,719
this is fun heart health improves heart

1815
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:25,360
health okay well if you stop pancakes

1816
01:17:21,719 --> 01:17:29,239
with butter all over it sausage bacon

1817
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:31,239
eggs ham cheese cream in the morning and

1818
01:17:29,239 --> 01:17:35,560
you don't do that anymore and you don't

1819
01:17:31,239 --> 01:17:37,560
do it for lunch either hm I think you

1820
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:39,960
might be getting better heart results

1821
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:42,280
somewhere along the way for sure

1822
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:44,360
cardiovascular you're not butter heart

1823
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:46,560
attacking yourself to death you're not

1824
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:48,840
tanking the butter and hopefully no

1825
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:51,719
one's putting butter in their coffee cuz

1826
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:53,159
that's a heart attack in a cup but and

1827
01:17:51,719 --> 01:17:55,520
that's also intermittent fasting has

1828
01:17:53,159 --> 01:17:57,880
gone wrong if someone is doing that and

1829
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:59,440
the funny thing is yeah there's a lot of

1830
01:17:57,880 --> 01:18:01,280
intermittent fers that are doing all

1831
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:03,320
kinds of weird things and that's one of

1832
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:05,600
them so yeah of course heart health

1833
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:07,400
improves you're not killing yourself

1834
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:10,120
eating all those high fatty foods for

1835
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:12,400
most of the day it gives you a chance

1836
01:18:10,120 --> 01:18:14,120
gives the heart a chance like is it

1837
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:15,480
really rocket science I mean they didn't

1838
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:18,400
know that but they have to figure that

1839
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:20,239
out now like you don't need a couple

1840
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:23,000
hundred million dollars in a study to

1841
01:18:20,239 --> 01:18:25,440
try to figure that one out but wait I'm

1842
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:27,080
M Aken they didn't figure it out now

1843
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:28,760
because they didn't know it's removing

1844
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:30,960
the fats that are giving them heart

1845
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:33,560
relief they just think it's removing the

1846
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:37,120
food so I guess they need another 20

1847
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:40,000
years or 50 years and $500 million to

1848
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:43,040
someday realize it was the fat that was

1849
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:45,600
causing the problem not the food it's

1850
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:51,280
like you go to the scientist and say are

1851
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:54,360
you guys uh food uh or fat you get you

1852
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:59,440
get the correlation so the next claim is

1853
01:18:54,360 --> 01:19:00,600
May prevent Alzheimer's okay uh May

1854
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:02,840
prevent

1855
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:06,760
Alzheimer's I don't know where they got

1856
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:10,040
that from there is not one single case

1857
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:13,840
in the world of someone who was dying of

1858
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:17,560
Alzheimer's intermittent fast and then

1859
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:20,920
recovered it doesn't exist but they're

1860
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:23,880
claiming May prevent Alzheimer's they

1861
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:27,239
got no proof it never happened happened

1862
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:30,040
they don't even have one healing story

1863
01:19:27,239 --> 01:19:33,360
of a grandma that doesn't know where she

1864
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:35,800
is doesn't know what street she lives on

1865
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:37,560
she has Alzheimer's it's really bad the

1866
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:40,199
whole family's worried they're losing

1867
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:44,000
her they don't have one healing story

1868
01:19:40,199 --> 01:19:46,600
like oh my God my grandma she was losing

1869
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:48,480
it she was dying from Alzheimer's in

1870
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:50,960
fact they were like well she only has

1871
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:53,320
like a year left and she did

1872
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:55,480
intermittent fasting you guys she

1873
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:58,040
withheld from food all day long we had

1874
01:19:55,480 --> 01:20:00,120
her jacked up on coffee she ate a big

1875
01:19:58,040 --> 01:20:03,560
old sloppy meal at the end of the day

1876
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:06,280
and she healed we don't have one healing

1877
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:08,520
story so I love when they say may

1878
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:11,520
prevent Alzheimer's and then we're

1879
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:15,239
supposed to chomp at the bit

1880
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:17,880
like oh my God like that's incredible I

1881
01:20:15,239 --> 01:20:19,920
better start now the other thing is how

1882
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:22,600
many grandmas can starve themselves the

1883
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:25,280
entire day like 16 hours without food

1884
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:27,360
like does your grandma do that how many

1885
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:29,960
grandpas can do that does your grandpa

1886
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:32,199
do that or is he in the cookie jar or is

1887
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:34,159
he in the cakes and goodie jar or the

1888
01:20:32,199 --> 01:20:36,560
cupboard getting a snack out like are

1889
01:20:34,159 --> 01:20:39,280
you kidding like how many Alzheimer's

1890
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:41,760
patients that are Grandpa or Grandma

1891
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:44,560
that you know can sit there and not eat

1892
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:47,120
all the way until 8:00 at night or 6:00

1893
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:49,159
at night huh they usually eat chocolate

1894
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:50,920
cake and everything else Under the Sun

1895
01:20:49,159 --> 01:20:53,080
and on top of that if they have

1896
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:55,080
Alzheimer's you got to be the one to

1897
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:57,000
feed them right if they're really bad

1898
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:59,360
off you got to be the one to get them

1899
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:01,480
the meals so are you going to be like

1900
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:04,840
well I'm doing experiment on my grandpa

1901
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:07,400
right now we haven't fed him yet he's uh

1902
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:09,639
he's might be hungry uh his blood sugar

1903
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:11,840
might be really low doesn't have any

1904
01:21:09,639 --> 01:21:15,000
energy he doesn't seem he wants to go

1905
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:16,960
outside and do anything so we're holding

1906
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:19,600
food from him let's see it's 2 o' I'm

1907
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:21,639
looking at my clock now no grandpa not

1908
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:23,760

1909
01:21:21,639 --> 01:21:26,800

Not Gonna feed you yet 7 o'clock at

1912
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:32,480
night no grandpa we're going to try to

1913
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:35,000
do the intermittent fasting program that

1914
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:36,960
this Guru does you know this Guru

1915
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:39,760
trainer guy or whoever we're going to

1916
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:42,679
feed you at 9:00 tonight and then you

1917
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:44,239
can eat okay I'm GL grandpa I know you

1918
01:21:42,679 --> 01:21:46,320
waited the whole day but we're going to

1919
01:21:44,239 --> 01:21:48,600
do this every single day to determine if

1920
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:50,080
it helps prevent Alzheimer's you know

1921
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:52,360
when you really think about intermittent

1922
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:54,360
fasting and you really break it down

1923
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:56,960
like starve your kids starve your

1924
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:58,080
teenagers starve your young adults

1925
01:21:56,960 --> 01:22:00,920
starve your

1926
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:03,320
grandparents to try to get a result

1927
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:06,000
because you don't know what else to do

1928
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:07,000
it's insane all right so let's do one of

1929
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:10,040
our last

1930
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:13,199
claims uh reduce

1931
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:15,199
inflammation okay reduce inflammation in

1932
01:22:13,199 --> 01:22:18,080
the body so if you're intermittent

1933
01:22:15,199 --> 01:22:22,199
fasting the claim is you can reduce

1934
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:24,800
inflammation in the body well yeah you

1935
01:22:22,199 --> 01:22:27,360
kind of can there's a good chance you

1936
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:29,199
will the reason why is because you're

1937
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:31,239
not having gluten in the morning they

1938
01:22:29,199 --> 01:22:33,639
don't know that but you're not having

1939
01:22:31,239 --> 01:22:35,760
gluten in the morning you're not having

1940
01:22:33,639 --> 01:22:38,840
dairy in the morning they don't know

1941
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:40,880
that either and then you're not having

1942
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:43,040
eggs in the morning they don't know that

1943
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:46,520
because they believe eggs is a great

1944
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:49,080
protein and you're not eating corn in

1945
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:51,480
the morning you're not doing soy in the

1946
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:53,480
morning but they don't know that see

1947
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:55,560
they just think food in general you're

1948
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:57,440
not eating food and because you're not

1949
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:59,440
eating food you're reducing your

1950
01:22:57,440 --> 01:23:01,800
inflammation but they don't know what

1951
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:04,600
causes inflammation unless they know the

1952
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:07,280
mm info all these years which is

1953
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:09,360
pathogens cause inflammation but they

1954
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:12,400
don't know that they don't know that

1955
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:15,560
Epstein bar or shingles or set a

1956
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:19,120
megavirus or or Herby simplex one or

1957
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:21,880
hhv6 causes inflammation in the body

1958
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:23,800
they never knew that that's original

1959
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:26,400
Medical meeme information all these

1960
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:28,560
years published information that science

1961
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:31,520
actually uses and takes medical meum

1962
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:33,840
information for themselves IL legally

1963
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:37,199
and so but they don't know this they

1964
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:39,120
just think food food stops you don't eat

1965
01:23:37,199 --> 01:23:42,239
food anymore in the morning so

1966
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:44,400
inflammation goes down they're like yay

1967
01:23:42,239 --> 01:23:47,719
we found something but they don't know

1968
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:49,679
why because you're taking away specific

1969
01:23:47,719 --> 01:23:53,560
things that could be in the mix of that

1970
01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:59,560
food like gluten which feeds virus uses

1971
01:23:53,560 --> 01:24:02,840
eggs which feeds viruses corn soy Dairy

1972
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:05,560
which feeds viruses pathogens and

1973
01:24:02,840 --> 01:24:09,360
bacteria those things eat those very

1974
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:11,639
specific things and then those pathogens

1975
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:14,600
create the inflammation but they're not

1976
01:24:11,639 --> 01:24:16,120
there yet they're not that far advanced

1977
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:18,159
yet they're just at the point where

1978
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:20,800
they're scratching their head going okay

1979
01:24:18,159 --> 01:24:23,800
food's removed that person's aches and

1980
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:26,760
pains are less oh here's a great claim

1981
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:28,639
May reduce inflammation so let's talk

1982
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:32,280
about a little bit of a different topic

1983
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:35,400
here swelling edema a lot of people are

1984
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:38,480
swelling they feel swollen and when they

1985
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:41,960
intermittent fast the swelling goes down

1986
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:44,119
but like I said remember this it's not

1987
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:47,119
sustainable because people who are

1988
01:24:44,119 --> 01:24:49,600
swelling wafer back and forth they

1989
01:24:47,119 --> 01:24:52,840
vacillate back and forth they stop

1990
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:55,639
eating their swelling goes down and then

1991
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:58,679
they got to eat again and they're eating

1992
01:24:55,639 --> 01:25:01,639
eating and then they get swollen again

1993
01:24:58,679 --> 01:25:04,480
and now they have to stop eating again

1994
01:25:01,639 --> 01:25:06,960
and then they desell they desell they

1995
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:09,040
swell they Dell they swell swell more

1996
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:10,639
swell more and then boom have to go all

1997
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:12,760
the way back intermittent fast

1998
01:25:10,639 --> 01:25:15,800
intermittent fast so they're fasc

1999
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:19,000
relating back and forth swelling

2000
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:21,520
dwelling now how do they dwell from

2001
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:24,880
intermittent fasting they're stopping

2002
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:28,159
the food that are contributing to their

2003
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:31,199
swelling because inside the food is the

2004
01:25:28,159 --> 01:25:34,000
problem what food what is it is it

2005
01:25:31,199 --> 01:25:36,320
gluten is it dairy products is it eggs

2006
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:39,440
you might be like I don't do gluten but

2007
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:42,840
you do eggs I don't do eggs but you do

2008
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:45,320
cheese what is it and so these different

2009
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:47,159
foods feed pathogens but that's just one

2010
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:48,840
Avenue right there I'll give you another

2011
01:25:47,159 --> 01:25:50,880
option what if you're somebody that's

2012
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:53,960
like I don't do dairy I'm vegan I'm

2013
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:57,600
plant-based I still swell I eat very

2014
01:25:53,960 --> 01:25:59,760
healthy aw I have oatmeal I put peanut

2015
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:01,639
butter in my oatmeal I have avocado

2016
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:03,199
toast I do different things I have

2017
01:26:01,639 --> 01:26:06,159
smoothies with protein powders

2018
01:26:03,199 --> 01:26:09,560
plant-based protein powders and I find

2019
01:26:06,159 --> 01:26:12,480
aw that if I stop eating alog together

2020
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:15,679
my swelling goes down yeah well in your

2021
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:18,520
situation it's liver it's an inflamed

2022
01:26:15,679 --> 01:26:21,520
liver pathogens inside the liver itself

2023
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:23,440
a liver that's overburdened stagnant and

2024
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:25,880
sluggish maybe you got too many heavy

2025
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:29,239
metals combined with it all but your

2026
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:31,840
liver is struggling so you have to stop

2027
01:26:29,239 --> 01:26:34,040
your plant-based Foods in the morning

2028
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:36,560
even if those plant-based Foods AR

2029
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:38,920
necessarily feeding pathogens that you

2030
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:41,080
have it's still burdening the liver

2031
01:26:38,920 --> 01:26:42,800
you're at the point in your life in your

2032
01:26:41,080 --> 01:26:44,760
health where you actually have to

2033
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:47,600
withhold from food to get a result to

2034
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:50,239
get the swelling down because the fat in

2035
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:53,000
your Foods the peanut butter the almond

2036
01:26:50,239 --> 01:26:55,520
butter the coconut oil the avocado

2037
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:57,719
whatever it is those fats are burdening

2038
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:59,360
the liver so much that you're in a

2039
01:26:57,719 --> 01:27:01,280
different position in your life you have

2040
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:03,719
to stop those fats even if you're

2041
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:06,360
plant-based in the morning or you have

2042
01:27:03,719 --> 01:27:09,280
to stop your plant-based fats during the

2043
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:11,520
day the daytime as well so you're that

2044
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:15,159
person that's like well okay in the

2045
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:16,800
morning I'm not eating those anyway and

2046
01:27:15,159 --> 01:27:18,880
well if you're eating them during the

2047
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:20,239
day it gets in the way as well and then

2048
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:21,920
you might be that plant-based person

2049
01:27:20,239 --> 01:27:24,840
that's like well I intermittent fast and

2050
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:27,679
I found being a vegan I don't eat

2051
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:30,360
breakfast I don't eat lunch yes I drink

2052
01:27:27,679 --> 01:27:34,199
coffee yes I have caffeine I try to push

2053
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:36,480
all the way to 4 5:00 6:00 before I eat

2054
01:27:34,199 --> 01:27:39,840
yeah you're withholding all those fats

2055
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:42,239
again and then your swelling goes down

2056
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:45,360
the fats are contributing to the

2057
01:27:42,239 --> 01:27:48,760
swelling and fats also stop the body

2058
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:50,760
from cleansing or healing so that you

2059
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:53,679
can't get rid of pathogens if you're

2060
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:56,320
always cranking the fats in the diet and

2061
01:27:53,679 --> 01:27:58,920
the Bummer is it's so sad because Health

2062
01:27:56,320 --> 01:28:01,080
influencers have no idea why anyone is

2063
01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:03,480
really sick to begin with but they're

2064
01:28:01,080 --> 01:28:07,639
pushing everybody into intermittent

2065
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:10,719
fasting as if it's a cure then when they

2066
01:28:07,639 --> 01:28:12,639
do eat they eat the wrong Foods so

2067
01:28:10,719 --> 01:28:15,520
people aren't being taught to go the

2068
01:28:12,639 --> 01:28:17,199
right direction to heal or what to eat

2069
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:19,159
they're not eating healing foods for

2070
01:28:17,199 --> 01:28:22,360
their actual symptoms and conditions the

2071
01:28:19,159 --> 01:28:24,719
very reason why they're getting sick now

2072
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:26,719
a lot of people are intermittent fasting

2073
01:28:24,719 --> 01:28:29,400
because of swelling because they're

2074
01:28:26,719 --> 01:28:32,000
getting so inflamed and swollen and

2075
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:36,280
their body doesn't feel good it's not

2076
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:38,440
just fat or weight of fat it's water

2077
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:41,280
retension and for years I've talked

2078
01:28:38,440 --> 01:28:44,800
about this where if someone's overweight

2079
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:48,760
they may only be 10 lb overweight with

2080
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:52,320
10 lbs of water retention and edema they

2081
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:55,639
may not be 20 lbs of fat on their body

2082
01:28:52,320 --> 01:29:00,080
they may have 10 lb of fat or 15 lbs of

2083
01:28:55,639 --> 01:29:02,199
fat and 10 lb of water swelling fluid

2084
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:04,480
they're retaining fluid and I've talked

2085
01:29:02,199 --> 01:29:08,199
about this for over 35 years when

2086
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:11,440
someone says well that person's 250 lbs

2087
01:29:08,199 --> 01:29:14,199
when they're supposed to be only 180 lbs

2088
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:16,159
they got you know that much more fat on

2089
01:29:14,199 --> 01:29:20,760
them it's like well wait a minute there

2090
01:29:16,159 --> 01:29:24,239
could be 30 lbs of retaining fluid edema

2091
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:26,840
happening and then the rest is fat so

2092
01:29:24,239 --> 01:29:29,480
when that swelling goes down in a day

2093
01:29:26,840 --> 01:29:33,239
they look like they lost 10 pounds like

2094
01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:35,199
10 pounds fast 10 pounds a week

2095
01:29:33,239 --> 01:29:37,480
especially if they just stop eating all

2096
01:29:35,199 --> 01:29:40,600
of a sudden they lose this initial

2097
01:29:37,480 --> 01:29:43,719
swelling they don't lose fat they just

2098
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:45,520
lose all this water retention the fluid

2099
01:29:43,719 --> 01:29:48,199
the swelling of the

2100
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:50,880
fluid but different people swell for

2101
01:29:48,199 --> 01:29:52,280
different reasons cuz I know the

2102
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:53,800
alternative movement want once again's

2103
01:29:52,280 --> 01:29:55,600
one size fits-all they just think

2104
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:58,320
everybody's got the same swelling

2105
01:29:55,600 --> 01:30:01,800
problem but they don't some people are

2106
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:04,159
really viral low grade viral infections

2107
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:07,639
and these viral infections inhabit their

2108
01:30:04,159 --> 01:30:10,800
liver making their liver so sluggish and

2109
01:30:07,639 --> 01:30:13,880
toxic that their lymphatic system starts

2110
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:16,239
to gain fluid because their liver is so

2111
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:18,560
clogged up and then you might have

2112
01:30:16,239 --> 01:30:20,119
somebody else it's a little different

2113
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:22,760
it's not just a low grade viral

2114
01:30:20,119 --> 01:30:25,360
infection and somebody else might have a

2115
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:28,040
stagnant sluggish liver without the

2116
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:31,239
pathogen problem the low-grade viral

2117
01:30:28,040 --> 01:30:33,360
infection instead a really fatty liver

2118
01:30:31,239 --> 01:30:34,800
with lots of different toxins in them

2119
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:37,280
and then you got people with salt

2120
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:39,639
addictions they're salted out they got

2121
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:41,880
salt deposits inside of them everywhere

2122
01:30:39,639 --> 01:30:44,840
their liver has salt deposits in it

2123
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:46,880
their bloodstream is high in sodium they

2124
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:49,560
got salt everywhere and then they're

2125
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:53,080
addicted to the flavor they need that

2126
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:55,639
salt flavor and there's people that say

2127
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:58,560
Hey I I don't add salt I never add salt

2128
01:30:55,639 --> 01:31:00,320
to anything no way I'm not really big on

2129
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:02,000
salt meanwhile they're eating so much

2130
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:03,679
salt they don't even realize that they

2131
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:06,480
go buy a sandwich somewhere and the

2132
01:31:03,679 --> 01:31:09,040
thing is salted out 10 Ways to Sunday

2133
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:11,239
because they don't know and then they go

2134
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:14,480
eat over somebody's house or family

2135
01:31:11,239 --> 01:31:16,360
makes them something to eat or salt and

2136
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:18,440
coffee that's another thing people don't

2137
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:21,119
realize it they make coffee more

2138
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:24,119
addictive because the coffee shops put

2139
01:31:21,119 --> 01:31:27,880
salt in the water sodium is in the water

2140
01:31:24,119 --> 01:31:29,960
at the coffee shops it's salty coffee

2141
01:31:27,880 --> 01:31:32,440
and everybody's drinking it down and

2142
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:34,800
they don't realize it and then sauce is

2143
01:31:32,440 --> 01:31:37,520
everywhere different condiments and

2144
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:41,159
sauces tomato sauce salts everywhere and

2145
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:44,280
then restaurants eating out takeout food

2146
01:31:41,159 --> 01:31:47,199
even if it's healthy vegan takeout food

2147
01:31:44,280 --> 01:31:50,600
or vegetarian takeout food it's extra

2148
01:31:47,199 --> 01:31:52,840
salty everybody salt it out and then

2149
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:55,560
they'll have some chips healthy chips

2150
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:57,560
they're salty too salt gets so out of

2151
01:31:55,560 --> 01:32:00,080
control they're swelling they're

2152
01:31:57,560 --> 01:32:02,040
swelling everywhere they stop eating

2153
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:04,920
they intermittent fast they don't

2154
01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:07,320
realize it but they just back down the

2155
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:09,800
salt that brings down the swelling that

2156
01:32:07,320 --> 01:32:11,719
alone now you'll often hear from people

2157
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:15,280
who intermittent fast that they can

2158
01:32:11,719 --> 01:32:17,600
think more clear they got Clarity like

2159
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:19,639
they're not as fogged and one of the

2160
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:21,880
reasons is they're avoiding a lot of

2161
01:32:19,639 --> 01:32:24,400
foods in the morning or during the day

2162
01:32:21,880 --> 01:32:27,280
that would bog them down slow them down

2163
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:29,800
and starve their brain of glucose for

2164
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:31,719
example they're eating high fatty foods

2165
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:34,719
during the morning or during the

2166
01:32:31,719 --> 01:32:37,440
afternoon you get high blood fat high

2167
01:32:34,719 --> 01:32:40,040
blood fat creates insulin resistance it

2168
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:42,600
stops critically needed glucose and

2169
01:32:40,040 --> 01:32:44,679
sugar from getting to your brain and

2170
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:46,840
when that glucose gets to the brain you

2171
01:32:44,679 --> 01:32:49,880
think more clear now what they're doing

2172
01:32:46,840 --> 01:32:51,840
is they're avoiding all food altoe so

2173
01:32:49,880 --> 01:32:54,080
they're avoiding the fats they're not

2174
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:56,520
having the fats anymore but they're

2175
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:59,280
having the caffeine so now they're

2176
01:32:56,520 --> 01:33:01,560
running on adrenaline and they think

2177
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:04,119
more clear in the moment but this is

2178
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:06,119
robbing Peter to pay Paul again because

2179
01:33:04,119 --> 01:33:09,600
in the end you get burnout

2180
01:33:06,119 --> 01:33:12,320
neurotransmitter burnout neuron burnout

2181
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:14,360
brain deficiencies you lose even

2182
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:16,719
precious resources like melatonin in

2183
01:33:14,360 --> 01:33:19,520
your brain and you just slowly burn out

2184
01:33:16,719 --> 01:33:22,239
over time anxiety creeps up depression

2185
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:24,280
creeps up and then you break and you end

2186
01:33:22,239 --> 01:33:27,119
up quitting your intermittent fasting

2187
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:29,440
program how do we nourish ourselves how

2188
01:33:27,119 --> 01:33:32,679
do we give our body what it needs all

2189
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:35,040
the nutrients all the glucose all the

2190
01:33:32,679 --> 01:33:37,199
trace mineral salts how do we fuel

2191
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:40,239
ourselves so we can function without

2192
01:33:37,199 --> 01:33:42,560
being jacked up on a drug like caffeine

2193
01:33:40,239 --> 01:33:45,280
how can we give ourselves the nutrients

2194
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:48,800
we need to power us through the day but

2195
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:51,040
yet not get sick instead reverse our

2196
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:53,280
conditions and our symptoms and live our

2197
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:56,000
life to the the best of its ability and

2198
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:58,960
not have to be on a stimulant how can we

2199
01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:01,800
do it in a kind way a kind way to our

2200
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:05,639
body kind way for our children our

2201
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:08,520
parents our friends our loved ones we

2202
01:34:05,639 --> 01:34:11,800
don't naturally come into this world and

2203
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:14,159
someday say I don't want to be a fireman

2204
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:16,280
I want to be an intermittent faster I

2205
01:34:14,159 --> 01:34:18,960
don't want to be a school teacher I want

2206
01:34:16,280 --> 01:34:21,560
to be an intermittent fasting person no

2207
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:23,560
I want to intermittent fast hey I'm in

2208
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:25,520
fifth grade right now hey do you guys

2209
01:34:23,560 --> 01:34:27,480
want an intermittent fast someday where

2210
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:29,199
you don't eat all your fun foods and

2211
01:34:27,480 --> 01:34:31,719
don't eat pizza and anything else and

2212
01:34:29,199 --> 01:34:35,199
breakfast is what do you mean no more

2213
01:34:31,719 --> 01:34:38,440
waffles in the morning Lego myo no more

2214
01:34:35,199 --> 01:34:40,960
that uh no more cereal yeah no we're

2215
01:34:38,440 --> 01:34:43,639
just going to starve ourselves all day

2216
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:46,239
long until the end of the day at night

2217
01:34:43,639 --> 01:34:48,040
really does that sound like a good idea

2218
01:34:46,239 --> 01:34:49,960
yeah that's what we're going to do I'm

2219
01:34:48,040 --> 01:34:52,199
going to go to college and someday be an

2220
01:34:49,960 --> 01:34:53,760
intermittent fasting person and when I

2221
01:34:52,199 --> 01:34:55,679
go out to lunch with my friend in

2222
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:58,480
college I'm going to say well I'm not

2223
01:34:55,679 --> 01:35:01,800
eating until 9:00 tonight that's what I

2224
01:34:58,480 --> 01:35:05,080
aspire to be and do it's not a natural

2225
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:08,159
process to just withhold food every day

2226
01:35:05,080 --> 01:35:10,520
so how do we do this right to start

2227
01:35:08,159 --> 01:35:12,520
there's not one way to do it everybody's

2228
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:14,119
different everybody has different

2229
01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:16,360
problems some people have a really

2230
01:35:14,119 --> 01:35:18,760
strong Constitution they haven't been

2231
01:35:16,360 --> 01:35:20,719
taken down by pathogens they don't have

2232
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:23,679
a lot of heavy metals they don't have a

2233
01:35:20,719 --> 01:35:25,320
lot of toxins and poisons that person

2234
01:35:23,679 --> 01:35:27,639
might just need some celery juice in the

2235
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:28,639
morning and not have to eat till noon at

2236
01:35:27,639 --> 01:35:30,040
least they're getting their Trace

2237
01:35:28,639 --> 01:35:32,560
mineral salts and a little bit of

2238
01:35:30,040 --> 01:35:34,080
glucose and hydration and then it all

2239
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:36,000
depends on what time you wake up in the

2240
01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:38,199
morning you might be somebody that wakes

2241
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:40,320
up really early or somebody that wakes

2242
01:35:38,199 --> 01:35:43,080
up at 10:00 in the morning 11:00 in the

2243
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:45,040
morning that changes the game too if you

2244
01:35:43,080 --> 01:35:47,199
wake up really early you start your day

2245
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:49,600
early and you go to work you're going to

2246
01:35:47,199 --> 01:35:52,719
need some glucose eventually so you

2247
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:55,320
might need some fruit or smoothie so not

2248
01:35:52,719 --> 01:35:57,679
just celery juice or cucumber juice or

2249
01:35:55,320 --> 01:36:00,360
just lemon water you might need all of

2250
01:35:57,679 --> 01:36:03,239
it and then some apples along the way to

2251
01:36:00,360 --> 01:36:07,040
take you to noon what you want to do is

2252
01:36:03,239 --> 01:36:10,639
leave out the fats no nuts no seeds no

2253
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:15,000
nut Butters no oils no coconut oil no

2254
01:36:10,639 --> 01:36:18,280
MCT oil no eggs dairy products Meats

2255
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:20,880
chickens keep the fats completely out at

2256
01:36:18,280 --> 01:36:23,760
least before noon you're not bombarding

2257
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:26,320
your blood BL stream with all that fat

2258
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:29,760
fat blocks the sugar from getting into

2259
01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:32,560
your cells fat blocks the glucose from

2260
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:35,320
getting to your brain fat creates the

2261
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:37,040
insulin resistance not the sugar and

2262
01:36:35,320 --> 01:36:40,360
that's a mistake made with intermittent

2263
01:36:37,040 --> 01:36:43,280
FS they don't know this so they withhold

2264
01:36:40,360 --> 01:36:46,000
all food starving their brain starving

2265
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:48,800
their body starving their liver their

2266
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:50,679
bloodstream loses the glucose what

2267
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:53,280
people don't think about is their heart

2268
01:36:50,679 --> 01:36:56,239
is a muscle muscle their muscles need

2269
01:36:53,280 --> 01:36:58,119
glucose it's critical but if there's no

2270
01:36:56,239 --> 01:37:00,119
glucose because you're holding back all

2271
01:36:58,119 --> 01:37:02,840
the food you're starving yourself from

2272
01:37:00,119 --> 01:37:04,679
the sugars you need then your heart is

2273
01:37:02,840 --> 01:37:07,320
not getting the glucose the sugar it

2274
01:37:04,679 --> 01:37:10,040
needs to feed itself your heart gets

2275
01:37:07,320 --> 01:37:11,880
stressed your brain gets stressed your

2276
01:37:10,040 --> 01:37:13,239
liver gets stressed your body gets

2277
01:37:11,880 --> 01:37:14,840
stressed and this is something

2278
01:37:13,239 --> 01:37:17,000
intermittent faster don't realize

2279
01:37:14,840 --> 01:37:18,760
they're doing but at the same time

2280
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:20,920
they're feeling a little better because

2281
01:37:18,760 --> 01:37:23,480
they're not eating so much garbage and

2282
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:27,840
so much fat throughout the day so the

2283
01:37:23,480 --> 01:37:31,320
goal is to cleanse detox restore renew

2284
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:34,320
cells for real get nutrients to them get

2285
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:36,119
sugar to the brain sugar to the heart

2286
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:38,639
get mineral salts to the brain and

2287
01:37:36,119 --> 01:37:41,000
nervous system all of this while being

2288
01:37:38,639 --> 01:37:43,400
productive living your life not

2289
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:45,480
overburdening your liver not tanking out

2290
01:37:43,400 --> 01:37:47,040
on fat all day meaning you're eating

2291
01:37:45,480 --> 01:37:49,400
fatty foods throughout the day not

2292
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:51,639
realizing it and getting insulin

2293
01:37:49,400 --> 01:37:53,760
resistance instead you're you're getting

2294
01:37:51,639 --> 01:37:55,719
better workouts fueling your heart

2295
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:59,040
fueling your muscles fueling your brain

2296
01:37:55,719 --> 01:38:00,800
and nervous system and being productive

2297
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:03,400
now listen there's a lot of ways to do

2298
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:05,119
this good ways to do it right so many

2299
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:06,400
different options you might be that

2300
01:38:05,119 --> 01:38:09,239
person that doesn't want to eat till

2301
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:10,880
four or six but yet you need some kind

2302
01:38:09,239 --> 01:38:13,080
of fuel but yet you don't want to

2303
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:15,199
actually eat food well then that's when

2304
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:17,360
the juices come in that's when coconut

2305
01:38:15,199 --> 01:38:19,360
water comes in that's when lemon water

2306
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:21,599
comes in you could always do the lemon

2307
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:24,960
water and then into celery juice or

2308
01:38:21,599 --> 01:38:28,239
cucumber juice then into coconut water

2309
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:29,800
and then do that until 4 or 6 but that's

2310
01:38:28,239 --> 01:38:31,960
only if you're somebody with a strong

2311
01:38:29,800 --> 01:38:34,320
Constitution you're kind of used to not

2312
01:38:31,960 --> 01:38:35,960
eating that much food or fuel but what

2313
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:38,000
if you're somebody that's sick and you

2314
01:38:35,960 --> 01:38:40,080
got a lot of neurological symptoms and

2315
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:41,880
you need more fuel or you're up against

2316
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:45,000
a lot of stress now here's a little

2317
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:46,920
disclaimer there's lots of options

2318
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:49,679
because that's the whole point it's not

2319
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:51,440
one size fits all each person is at a

2320
01:38:49,679 --> 01:38:53,280
different place in their life there are

2321
01:38:51,440 --> 01:38:55,119
people that they got to eat something

2322
01:38:53,280 --> 01:38:58,280
every hour because of their adrenal

2323
01:38:55,119 --> 01:39:00,280
glands their adrenals are shot they have

2324
01:38:58,280 --> 01:39:02,719
to make sure they fuel themselves every

2325
01:39:00,280 --> 01:39:05,000
hour hour and a half and then there's

2326
01:39:02,719 --> 01:39:06,480
people who do want to eat fat at some

2327
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:08,560
point during the day they don't know it

2328
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:11,239
but they feel like satiated on some type

2329
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:12,760
of chicken or meat and it's the fat

2330
01:39:11,239 --> 01:39:15,520
that's kind of giving them that

2331
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:17,119
satiation at night well save those fats

2332
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:19,760
to the end of the day that could be a

2333
01:39:17,119 --> 01:39:21,639
whole another person where all day long

2334
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:23,719
you're doing lemon water water your

2335
01:39:21,639 --> 01:39:26,119
celery juice then your coconut water

2336
01:39:23,719 --> 01:39:28,480
then a fruit smoothie then a salad baby

2337
01:39:26,119 --> 01:39:30,159
with steamed potato and then at the very

2338
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:33,280
end of the night you have your animal

2339
01:39:30,159 --> 01:39:36,599
protein or your plant fats or something

2340
01:39:33,280 --> 01:39:38,119
like avocado salad again or you have

2341
01:39:36,599 --> 01:39:40,320
something else like a nut butter if

2342
01:39:38,119 --> 01:39:42,159
that's what you live on that you love

2343
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:44,199
everybody's different there's so many

2344
01:39:42,159 --> 01:39:46,400
different options say you're somebody

2345
01:39:44,199 --> 01:39:48,840
that gets up and coconut water works

2346
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:51,320
good for you so you can do a lot of that

2347
01:39:48,840 --> 01:39:53,639
and then you're not big on fruit so do

2348
01:39:51,320 --> 01:39:55,639
some oatmeal can do some maple syrup or

2349
01:39:53,639 --> 01:39:58,239
honey in your oatmeal but don't do the

2350
01:39:55,639 --> 01:40:00,360
nut milks the nut Butters don't put the

2351
01:39:58,239 --> 01:40:02,560
fat on top of the oatmeal cuz that's

2352
01:40:00,360 --> 01:40:04,159
when you get in trouble and then if you

2353
01:40:02,560 --> 01:40:06,280
do like a little bit of fruit you can

2354
01:40:04,159 --> 01:40:08,960
always put some berries and other pieces

2355
01:40:06,280 --> 01:40:10,320
of fruit on your oatmeal if you'd like

2356
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:12,520
that might be able to carry you to

2357
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:15,239
lunchtime or after if you're somebody

2358
01:40:12,520 --> 01:40:17,520
that's trying not to eat as much at

2359
01:40:15,239 --> 01:40:19,480
least you got some kind of fuel to fuel

2360
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:21,599
your brain and fuel your bloodstream

2361
01:40:19,480 --> 01:40:23,080
with all the glucose you need and then

2362
01:40:21,599 --> 01:40:25,159
you might be able to do some steamed

2363
01:40:23,080 --> 01:40:28,239
vegetables that day and some steamed

2364
01:40:25,159 --> 01:40:30,280
vegetables on top of a salad of greens

2365
01:40:28,239 --> 01:40:33,040
leafy greens so you're getting all your

2366
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:35,760
mineral salts but on that salad don't

2367
01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:38,480
put oils don't put avocado don't put

2368
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:40,280
chicken don't put fish don't put Bean on

2369
01:40:38,480 --> 01:40:42,760
there don't put eggs on there you don't

2370
01:40:40,280 --> 01:40:45,480
want a fat on there remember you're

2371
01:40:42,760 --> 01:40:48,159
keeping the fats out if you don't want

2372
01:40:45,480 --> 01:40:50,920
to be fat free for the day the fats come

2373
01:40:48,159 --> 01:40:53,080
later at the end of the day if you're if

2374
01:40:50,920 --> 01:40:55,280
you're an animal protein person that's

2375
01:40:53,080 --> 01:40:58,960
when you apply the animal proteins

2376
01:40:55,280 --> 01:41:01,080
because animal proteins equal animal fat

2377
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:03,360
so at the end of the day your animal fat

2378
01:41:01,080 --> 01:41:06,560
comes in then if you're a plant-based

2379
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:08,400
person plant fats comes at the end of

2380
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:11,560
the day that means if you're somebody

2381
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:14,360
that always eats nut butter or avocado

2382
01:41:11,560 --> 01:41:16,639
you're bringing those in later on your

2383
01:41:14,360 --> 01:41:18,639
last meal of the day really preferably

2384
01:41:16,639 --> 01:41:21,440
so you're doing your intermittent

2385
01:41:18,639 --> 01:41:23,280
fasting in a way you're doing the thing

2386
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:25,440
that you avoid it all day which is the

2387
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:27,280
fats but you do it at night at the end

2388
01:41:25,440 --> 01:41:29,760
of the day but this is the healthier

2389
01:41:27,280 --> 01:41:32,360
version because all day long you're

2390
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:34,800
getting fuel and the things you need a

2391
01:41:32,360 --> 01:41:36,360
lot of influencers are adopting medical

2392
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:39,080
medium tools with their intermittent

2393
01:41:36,360 --> 01:41:40,840
fasting programs they all drink celery

2394
01:41:39,080 --> 01:41:42,760
juice in the morning and then they drink

2395
01:41:40,840 --> 01:41:45,000
their coffee all day long and have their

2396
01:41:42,760 --> 01:41:47,520
meals at the end of the day the celery

2397
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:49,480
juice is carrying them helping them

2398
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:51,080
bringing things back to them that's why

2399
01:41:49,480 --> 01:41:53,080
they're doing it the sodium sodium

2400
01:41:51,080 --> 01:41:54,800
cluster salts and celery juice are

2401
01:41:53,080 --> 01:41:57,280
feeding their brain their

2402
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:59,480
neurotransmitters their neurons it's

2403
01:41:57,280 --> 01:42:01,159
making them stronger while they're doing

2404
01:41:59,480 --> 01:42:03,239
something that's not good for them like

2405
01:42:01,159 --> 01:42:05,040
caffeine all day the celery juice is

2406
01:42:03,239 --> 01:42:07,960
allowing them to do more of the things

2407
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:09,480
that aren't helpful at the same time the

2408
01:42:07,960 --> 01:42:12,119
celery juice is restoring their

2409
01:42:09,480 --> 01:42:15,000
hydrochloric acid reserves because their

2410
01:42:12,119 --> 01:42:16,639
stomach glands are depleted of HCL it's

2411
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:19,840
part of what contributes to their

2412
01:42:16,639 --> 01:42:21,880
bloating and then a lot of them have

2413
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:24,960
bacteria problems in their gut bad

2414
01:42:21,880 --> 01:42:26,960
bacteria strepto coctus that contributes

2415
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:30,239
to the bloating as well and the celery

2416
01:42:26,960 --> 01:42:32,599
juice is killing off the bad bacteria

2417
01:42:30,239 --> 01:42:34,960
lowering the amounts of bad bacteria

2418
01:42:32,599 --> 01:42:37,199
they have in their gut and then the

2419
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:39,560
celery juice is also knocking other

2420
01:42:37,199 --> 01:42:41,840
pathogens down a lot of people have the

2421
01:42:39,560 --> 01:42:44,000
epine bar and the lowgrade viral

2422
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:46,360
infections so they got a little bit of

2423
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:48,040
that mild fatigue and they got a little

2424
01:42:46,360 --> 01:42:50,199
bit of aches and pains and they don't

2425
01:42:48,040 --> 01:42:52,880
feel good so the celery juice is

2426
01:42:50,199 --> 01:42:56,400
knocking down down the viral load and

2427
01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:59,360
the bacterial load and restoring the HCL

2428
01:42:56,400 --> 01:43:02,000
and at the same time the celery juice is

2429
01:42:59,360 --> 01:43:04,840
bringing bile reserves back restoring

2430
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:07,199
the liver and helping them cleanse all

2431
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:09,199
that's happening from their daily celery

2432
01:43:07,199 --> 01:43:10,639
juice every single day but then they

2433
01:43:09,199 --> 01:43:13,040
still tell everybody they're

2434
01:43:10,639 --> 01:43:15,239
intermittent fasting and the credit goes

2435
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:17,000
to the intermittent fasting but they

2436
01:43:15,239 --> 01:43:19,320
don't tell someone they're doing the

2437
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:20,520
celery juice so the next person says

2438
01:43:19,320 --> 01:43:22,599
well I'm going to do the intermittent

2439
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:24,920

before we get to the ending of the show

2488
01:45:26,679 --> 01:45:31,560
just want to leave you with one last

2489
01:45:28,679 --> 01:45:34,119
thought when we're intermittent fasting

2490
01:45:31,560 --> 01:45:36,960
we're doing it on planet Earth we're

2491
01:45:34,119 --> 01:45:41,000
doing it here in this solar system this

2492
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:43,679
planet is the size it is takes 24 hours

2493
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:46,239
for it to revolve and turn for the sun

2494
01:45:43,679 --> 01:45:48,719
to rise and the sun to

2495
01:45:46,239 --> 01:45:52,440
rise think about being in a different

2496
01:45:48,719 --> 01:45:55,280
solar system on another planet and what

2497
01:45:52,440 --> 01:45:57,080
would intermittent fasting be like there

2498
01:45:55,280 --> 01:46:00,440
what if it was a planet that was larger

2499
01:45:57,080 --> 01:46:04,159
than the earth very well could be and it

2500
01:46:00,440 --> 01:46:08,520
took 48 hours for that sunrise for that

2501
01:46:04,159 --> 01:46:10,560
sun to rise or took longer and what

2502
01:46:08,520 --> 01:46:13,199
would it be like during the day as

2503
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:16,320
you're intermittent fasting instead of

2504
01:46:13,199 --> 01:46:18,960
fasting for 12 hours and not eating food

2505
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:23,920
before you eat your dinner you might be

2506
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:26,360
waiting 20 hours or maybe even 30 hours

2507
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:30,280
just wanted to leave you with that last

2508
01:46:26,360 --> 01:46:33,679
note it's easy to be confused about food

2509
01:46:30,280 --> 01:46:37,040
feel stuck about what we are eating feel

2510
01:46:33,679 --> 01:46:40,679
lost about what we are choosing what

2511
01:46:37,040 --> 01:46:44,000
we're trying to avoid the road map to

2512
01:46:40,679 --> 01:46:47,880
Healing is hard when we don't have a

2513
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:50,960
clue it's not our fault everyone going

2514
01:46:47,880 --> 01:46:54,040
through a struggle ends up scrambling

2515
01:46:50,960 --> 01:46:56,080
it's true when you're young and strong

2516
01:46:54,040 --> 01:46:58,639
and haven't been in the shoes of someone

2517
01:46:56,080 --> 01:47:02,239
who has been there who's been deeply

2518
01:46:58,639 --> 01:47:05,280
wronged and is really sick and what you

2519
01:47:02,239 --> 01:47:07,760
reference in your life isn't what they

2520
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:11,320
the really sick have referenced in their

2521
01:47:07,760 --> 01:47:14,520
life it's like the wild west out there

2522
01:47:11,320 --> 01:47:18,480
in the world of Health everyone who's

2523
01:47:14,520 --> 01:47:21,239
Alpha and their ego won't back down and

2524
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:24,360
they are not yet affected by sick

2525
01:47:21,239 --> 01:47:27,000
and try to make a name for themselves

2526
01:47:24,360 --> 01:47:29,960
not all are like this though there are

2527
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:32,400
Angels Among the masses and there are

2528
01:47:29,960 --> 01:47:35,760
beacons of light who have been through

2529
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:39,560
hell and back and have every right to

2530
01:47:35,760 --> 01:47:41,920
preach and teach classes wise ones that

2531
01:47:39,560 --> 01:47:45,199
fought their way out of the woods broke

2532
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:47,639
out of unwellness left the darkness and

2533
01:47:45,199 --> 01:47:50,480
then became reborn with purpose and

2534
01:47:47,639 --> 01:47:53,199
knowledge and of great compassion for

2535
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:56,320
the ones that have been misled All Along

2536
01:47:53,199 --> 01:47:59,719
The Path they know what it was to feel

2537
01:47:56,320 --> 01:48:02,480
barely alive and just about half dead

2538
01:47:59,719 --> 01:48:05,000
but have more words of wisdom now than

2539
01:48:02,480 --> 01:48:08,520
anything said in the trendy Health realm

2540
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:11,480
of games that mess with people's heads

2541
01:48:08,520 --> 01:48:14,360
remember these words for they are tall

2542
01:48:11,480 --> 01:48:18,080
and the truth derails the darkness so it

2543
01:48:14,360 --> 01:48:21,520
doesn't stay above all the confusion and

2544
01:48:18,080 --> 01:48:23,639
delusion the medicine delusion

2545
01:48:21,520 --> 01:48:27,679
creates its own

2546
01:48:23,639 --> 01:48:31,000
downfall and all that's good and healing

2547
01:48:27,679 --> 01:48:33,660
sits in your hands and allows what you

2548
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:36,739
wanted all

2549
01:48:33,660 --> 01:48:36,739
