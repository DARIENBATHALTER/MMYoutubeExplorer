376
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,600
important all of these um

377
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,880
so mara ella she was saying something i

378
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,279
have terrible brain fog

379
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,720
oh my god that's awful it's such a

380
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,920
struggle through

381
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:40,079
uni i have hypothyroidism and i think

382
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,200
it's getting worse i would do anything

383
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,680
to get help

384
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,800
as the gluten-free diet didn't help i've

385
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,480
talked about that

386
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,920
i actually talked about it in the brain

387
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,519
fog episode too

388
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,760
about how there's all these guessing

389
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,600
games going on you're on a plant-based

390
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,600
diet for 12 years i still believe

391
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,720
it's my thyroid first of all i support

392
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,040
plant-based diets

393
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,880
i support also animal-based diets but i

394
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,399
support plant-based diets but what i've

395
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,320
always told everybody is

396
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,320
in order to heal because people on

397
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,680
plant-based diets and animal-based diets

398
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,920
both get sick

399
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,440
and in order to heal we need to know

400
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,320
what's causing it

401
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,079
what's causing the brain fog what is it

402
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,639
and in the episode you'll hear me go

403
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,560
oh look over there look over there

404
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,320
there's a new guessing game over there

405
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,079
there's a new guessing game over there

406
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,120
you'll hear it in the episode and what i

407
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,800
was saying was

408
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,240
there's a lot of guessing games but

409
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,040
unless you know what's causing your

410
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,880
brain fog

411
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,639
we're just guessing and that's what

412
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,160
we're doing in fact i said something

413
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,600
else more than that

414
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,160

and i'm in and my job is to actually

426
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,839
know what's going on with people and

427
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,279
their symptoms i was known since i was

428
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,440
age four years old

429
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,560
as the person that people with bizarre

430
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,519
symptoms came to

431
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,800
because i understood them because of the

432
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,839
because of the gift with spirit of

433
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,120
compassion so

434
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,320
that's what i've always been known my

435
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,959

436
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,959

that's why

441
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000

442
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,560

449

my energy and drive is totally drained

451
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,839

452
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,240

working so hard on your healing process

482
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,920
so with brain fog

483
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:49,839
what happens is you can be like fogged

484
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,959
out all morning you can be fogged out in

485
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,279
and out of the day

486
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,959
you can be fogged out at night or what

487
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:58,079
usually happens with brain fog

488
00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:01,199
you're fogged all day long all

489
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:02,000
day long and then at the end of the day

490
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,920
at night

491
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,360
you're like coming back to life and

492
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,800
you're just springing back to life for a

493
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,320
little bit and you get clarity and you

494
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,480
get clarity and then you're up

495
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,880
later at night with that clarity and

496
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,639
then you go to bed and you wake up the

497
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,320
next morning and you're fogged out again

498
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,760
that's one version right there

499
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,240
another version is like when you're

500
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,680
talking to other people you kind of like

501
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,959
with the words that are coming

502
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,959
the words that are in your head don't

503
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:26,000
come out the right way they come out

504
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:29,199
kind of wrong

505
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,199
or they come out disjointed disc but

506
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:33,360
combolated they just come out all kind

507
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,880
of strange and it happens to so many

508
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,079
people and i've seen people struggle

509
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,920
like that or

510
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:39,120
it's hard to listen to what the person's

511
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,079
telling you because you're thinking

512
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,839
about what you're thinking

513
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,000
and then you're kind of not listening to

514
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,399
what they're saying but you miss it and

515
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,240
that happens to so many people the brain

516
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,480
fog is even hard on people they get

517
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,680
drained by being around other people so

518
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,360
if you're around maybe

519
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,800
people that you're not really that

520
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,279
comfortable with or people that you're

521
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,800
just

522
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,320
you're not in the mood to be around with

523
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,839
family and friends or something and all

524
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,279
of a sudden the brain fog worsens and

525
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,399
you feel drained

526
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,399
you know there's so many different

527
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,440
versions of brain fog and it makes it so

528
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,079
difficult

529
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,360

all dealing with brain fog

667
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,280
um ayanna is social anxiety linked to

668

00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,159
it happens is the anxiety and brain fog

671
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,760
that come together and then social

672
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,000
anxiety and brain fog

673
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,440
that's a whole thing too absolutely i'm

674
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,080
answering questions you guys up here if

675
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,679
you want to

676
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:49,039
ask some questions and

677
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:51,440
really the brain fog episode opens the

678
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:53,360
door to understand it like no other so

679
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,320
you know what's going on with everything

680
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,240
and all of it

681
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,840
loon says brain fog to me feels like i

682
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,720
am being dumbed down

683
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,799
as if i was under heavy drug abuse not

684
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,320
fun and also it's hard to do anything i

685
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:06,400
get very clumsy and confused

686
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,760
so loon you dealt with the brain fog you

687
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,720
struggled with it

688
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,760
and and that's just it's really hard

689
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,760
hard hard you know

690
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,799
and that's the thing if someone hasn't

691
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,400
had brain fog

692
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:18,159
and they never struggled with it on any

693
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,840
level and a lot of you guys might not

694
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,000

and it's i really am i really am

758
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,400
and so you guys you know one thing about

759
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,720
brain fog is interesting

760
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,799
is that it's not even considered

761
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,480
anything like

762
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,919
medical research and science the

763
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,480
industries don't even think it's

764
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,559
anything

765
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,760
and even alternative medicine has a hard

766
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:32,240
time with it because when you

767
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,799
you when they when altered medicine they

768
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,400
kind of see it as brain fog are you just

769
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:38,000
are you really dealing with brain fog or

770
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,000
is it something else it's

771
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,760
we're always underestimated we're always

772
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,360
misunderstood with brain fog

773
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,520
and then we don't even know to call it

774
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,240
brain fog we're just like i don't feel

775
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,559
well or

776
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,600
maybe this is who i am where i'm bumping

777
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,200
into walls and

778
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,760
