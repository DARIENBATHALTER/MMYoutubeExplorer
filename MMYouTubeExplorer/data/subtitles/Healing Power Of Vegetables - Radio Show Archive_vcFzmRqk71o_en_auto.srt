78
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,440
doing the light blast ever since I was a

79
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,720
child Spirit offered that opportunity

80
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,760
for me to give to people because I saw

81
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,760
so much suffering all the time non-stop

82
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,680
no matter where I went no matter what I

83
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,760
did and um the gift that I received at

84
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:30,560
age 4 to diagnose my grandmother came

85
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:32,040
with uh a lot of hardship and I know

86
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,239
some of you guys know that about me if

87
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,920
you just logged on and this is brand new

88
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:38,519
the medical Medium show is brand new to

89
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,760
you and this is your first show this

90
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:41,640
this will kind of fill you in a little

91
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,599
bit about it I diagnosed my grandmother

92
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:47,280
at age 4 uh by hearing a voice perfectly

93
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:49,239
clear as if someone was talking to me in

94
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,079
my ear so it's on the

95
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:54,159
outside of the body I'm not channeling

96
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:56,200
and it's not intuition although I have

97
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,360
tremendous respect for intuitives

98
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:01,040
because they have to work so darn hard

99
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,439
on mastering their intuition I know that

100
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,079
that the audience that that's listening

101
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:05,519
to right now all you guys are intuitive

102
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:07,239
too and everything else but it wasn't

103
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,439
intuition it was actually hearing a

104
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:10,720
voice perfectly clear in real time just

105
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:14,400
like you're hearing me right now with

106
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:17,040
your own ear and it came with a lot of

107
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,600
pain a lot of suffering in its own right

108
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,600
and um and a lot of Agony and I was able

109
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,040
to get through my teenage years without

110
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,440
basically ending my life because of the

111
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,160
severity of how difficult it was to live

112
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,160
in the world today and hearing a voice

113
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,479
24 seven telling me what's going on with

114
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:36,360
every aspect of someone's health and um

115
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,400
and so but with that I saw a lot of

116
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,680
suffering non-stop like I always have

117
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,080
and um and and I do you know the

118
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,880
readings come through no matter what at

119
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,680
all times it makes me go partially blind

120
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,440
I know that many of you who have read

121
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,160
the book you've you've you've heard seen

122
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,800
that it's like a snow blindness I call

123
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:54,440
it and um and so what happened though is

124
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,400
I asked Spirit at the young age I said

125
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:58,039
what else can I do for people first of

126
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,160
all there weren't a lot of resources

127
00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:02,520
back then I'm not trying to date myself

128
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,960
and and and everything but but if we go

129
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:08,000
all the way back down to that that place

130
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,479
in time uh you couldn't get anything I

131
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,080
mean you basically there are a few

132
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:12,680
fruits and vegetables at best in the

133
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,840
grocery store depending on where you

134
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:17,280
lived in the country not everybody lived

135
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:19,400
in California in the in in in Los

136
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,560
Angeles where there was the first health

137
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,520
food store in the United States you know

138
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:27,840
we you know not everybody had that

139
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:30,160
opportunity okay so you know and and

140
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,880
because of that resources were low there

141
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,919
weren't a lot of uh supplements that

142
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:38,039
were discovered or or uh or or what is

143
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:41,759
it created by Geniuses that we have

144
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:43,560
today in alternative medicine and um and

145
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,080
there there wasn't a lot of that going

146
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,280
in fact there was virtually none of that

147
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:49,680
going on and so I would ask Spirit what

148
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,120
else can I do to ignite the healing

149
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,759
process and spirit said we're going to

150
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,479
do the light blast on each person if you

151
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,199
want and at that time you know I asked

152
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,520
for that help and spirit sent the light

153
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:02,080
down on the person that I would ask for

154
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,000
the light to hit and run right through

155
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,120
the body unlock

156
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,319
blockages completely change their

157
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,440
chemistry on all levels and give them

158
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,759
that ignition we do that at the events

159
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:15,160
it drains the heck out of me but that's

160
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:16,680
okay doesn't matter if my my um my

161
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,319
assistants have to actually scrape me

162
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,960
off the floor after we're done it

163
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,560
doesn't matter because guess what it's

164
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:25,240
so miraculous and what has happened from

165
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,440
these light blasts has just been so

166
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:31,639
great um just in the last event alone

167
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:33,120
over 600 people reported experiencing a

168
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:36,280
benefit to their health in one way or

169
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,639
another so um anyway the bottom line is

170
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,319
that's how it all happened that's what's

171
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:41,479

comes down to Healing there's different

178
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,919

196
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:41,639
them back because it could be a little

197
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,440
scary in the life-changing Foods I talk

208
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:10,800
puzzle that we need to heal and then

209

to what can help you get over these

224
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:51,519
things through these fruits and

225
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:55,160
vegetables it was a daunting

226
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:58,480
grueling task with Spirit but it had to

227
00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:00,800
get done and so so we're going over

228
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,160
vegetables today today now you know the

229
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,800
when it comes down to vegetables and

230
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,680
stuff so you've heard it since you were

231
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:08,360
young right eat your vegetables and hey

232
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,560
not everybody heard that when they were

233
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,200
young and you know it's not anybody's

234
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,480
fault there's some mommy and daddies

235
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:17,200
that they get so busy and they have so

236
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,839
much on their plate and so much dress

237
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,800
that they can barely just get a happy

238
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,880
meal for McDonald's and their children

239
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:27,120
and some chicken fingers out of the

240
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:29,279
freezer to survive and I have complete

241
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,279
and total respect for that you have to

242
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:34,000
understand that like um you know that's

243
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,720
a that's a that's a big deal just you

244
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,200
know making sure there's food on on the

245
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:41,000
table for your family as it is and

246
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:43,399
everything around it and children have

247
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,399
minds of their owns my minds of their

248
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:48,320
own okay they're the little people so

249
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,200
they have their own palet they have

250
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:54,160
their own tastes they have their own

251
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:57,640
likings and you know and a lot of times

252
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,480
um children don't like vegetables and

253
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:02,600
don't want to eat a vegetable and a lot

254
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:06,519
of times parents are so busy that you

255
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:08,079
know working working with coaching um

256
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:09,720
our children's really difficult

257
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,000
sometimes when we're trying to survive

258
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,839
we're trying to work we're trying to

259
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,279
make sure there's everything else in

260
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:17,320
place so we can protect our children so

261
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,279
we kind of you know the the food thing

262
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,279
gets put on the back burner a lot with

263
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:24,079
families and as long as there's food on

264
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:26,279
the table though that's all that matters

265
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:28,279
you know when I was growing up and that

266
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:30,600
was the the only thing that counted was

267
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:33,079
was there something to eat you know for

268
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:35,760
us kids was there something to eat on

269
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:38,160
that table regardless of what it was it

270
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,800
just we had to be eating something and

271
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,519
you know and and it makes a lot of sense

272
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,360
but you know but there's a lot of people

273
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:46,880
that talked to that I've talked to and

274
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,279
they're like yeah when I was younger I

275
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,360
was always told to eat my vegetables I

276
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:53,800
was always told you know you got to eat

277
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,200
them you know you're not and then i'

278
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:58,160
I've had people tell me you can't leave

279
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,120
the table until you eat your vegetables

280
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,480
you know when they were a child child

281
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,160
and their parents would say you know

282
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,120
you're not leaving the table there'd be

283
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,839
punishment you know you wouldn't be able

284
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,839
to leave the table you'd have to be sent

285
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:11,000
to your room like all kinds of things

286
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:12,959
I've heard from people because you know

287
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,360
vegetables are

288
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:18,279
important and so um you know our parents

289
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,680
have tried to get some of some

290
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:23,440
vegetables innocent in many of us in our

291
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:25,480
lives and and like I said before others

292
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:29,040
other other times it's just survival and

293
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:32,720
whatever we can get to eat but so but

294
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:35,920
vegetables have always been a role in

295
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:39,560
humanity and the future of humankind in

296
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:43,440
our survival in what we need to survive

297
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:47,000
here because they hold keys they hold

298
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:50,880
keys to the door the door of Health the

299
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:53,240
door of well-being the door of

300
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,440
lifegiving the door of

301
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:57,279
fertility and um by the way there's a

302
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,959
fertility chapter in life-changing Foods

303
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:01,519
that's going to knock your socks off

304
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:04,800
um

305
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:07,600
and information about fertility and

306
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,399
infertility you can't find anywhere and

307
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,399
I'm not just trying to say that in a

308
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:13,680
boasting way I'm just meaning it knocked

309
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:18,000
my socks off when I got the information

310
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:20,480
from Spirit I was blown away um but you

311
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,519
know all this vegetables play a role in

312
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:29,360
all of this you guys folks it plays a

313
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:32,199
big role in opening up the door to to

314
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:35,519
lifegiving to our future to where we're

315
00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:37,959
going to what we're doing everything our

316
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:40,199
Consciousness everything about it it's

317
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:44,040
involved with a vegetable it's a big

318
00:12:40,199 --> 00:12:48,040
piece of that and so it's one of these

319
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:50,600
holy four I call them holy four it's one

320
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:53,240
of these that's crucial and critical to

321
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,959
our well-being to our life to where

322
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:57,639
we're going to what we're doing just

323
00:12:54,959 --> 00:13:01,360
like I said before and it it matter

324
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:03,720
matters that much to get them into us

325
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,079
and what's really important in the

326
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,279
vegetable department is leafy greens

327
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:10,320
which I'm going to cover a little bit

328
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:13,440
about what leafy greens do but leafy

329
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,959
greens are they're practically almost a

330
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,720
category of the Holy four on their own

331
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:20,800
even though they're in the vegetables

332
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:24,240
but they hold a lot of power and we tend

333
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:26,399
to forget about leafy greens a lot even

334
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,240
if we're um eating a really healthy

335
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,000
paleo diet we tend to forget about

336
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,519
eating a lot lot of leafy greens if

337
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,880
we're eating um you know a vegetarian

338
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,160
diet we forget about eating a lot of

339
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,079
leafy greens if we're eating a

340
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,800
plant-based or vegan diet which is

341
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,800
pretty much the same if we're if we're

342
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:46,320
you know we we forget about eating a lot

343
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:49,839
of leafy greens it's easy to forget or

344
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:52,480
to not get enough leafy greens in our

345
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:55,800
system no matter what diet you subscribe

346
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,880
to and you know I I don't care what diet

347
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,240
it is really I mean in a sense that

348
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:02,160
you're that you're into too if you're

349
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,959
really into a paleo diet um which is

350
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,279
basically now almost a vegan diet with

351
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:08,399
just a little bit of lean meat because

352
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:10,240
you know that's T we're learning to get

353
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,839
people better it's more vegetables

354
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,680
that's where we're going everybody's

355
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,600
going that direction it's more

356
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,360
vegetables and more fruit to get people

357
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,800
better by the way so but whatever it is

358
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,279
if you're on a you know paleo diet if

359
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,560
you're on a ketogenic diet if you're on

360
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:25,800
an Ain diet if you're on some branding

361
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,720
diet like that if you're on you know a

362
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:32,240
diet that has a branding name whatever

363
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:33,839
it is you know um you have to bring in

364
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,800
more leafy greens if you're on a

365
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:39,279
Mediterranean diet you're just eating

366
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:41,199
all this fish and if you're on a wild

367
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:43,600
game diet you're just eating all this

368
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,399
Wild game um someone was talking to me

369
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,079
the other day and said you know I I I

370
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:51,480
hunt my own game you know I I I hunt and

371
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:55,680
kill my own rabbits I um you know hunt

372
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:57,320
deer and stuff and and you know and uh

373
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,720
first of all yeah it's the healthiest

374
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,399
food you could possibly eat in theend

375
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,199
Animal Kingdom as far as in the animal

376
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,160
world if you're if you're into meat or

377
00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:07,600
you're into you know you're into the

378
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:09,600
paleo diet then Wild game is by far you

379
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,279
know the healthiest for you but I said

380
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:15,720
to the person are you eating enough

381
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:18,120
greens and maybe even Wild Greens and

382
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,839
maybe even greens that are cousins to

383
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,639
Wild Greens that you could buy in the

384
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,800
store and they were like well no I

385
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:24,279
wasn't thinking about that I was

386
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,759
thinking about just protein protein

387
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:28,959
protein and I was thinking about just

388
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:31,680
getting the leanest leanest good fresh

389
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:33,800
you know leanest freshest meat I can get

390
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,360
and so I was just you know doing the

391
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:38,319
hunting the game thing and everything I

392
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,480
said you know what first of all you know

393
00:15:38,319 --> 00:15:42,800
that sure that's one aspect like people

394
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:46,920
do grass-fed meat because it's

395
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:48,600
closer to that area grass-fed it's out

396
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:51,199
you know it's the free range it's you

397
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,920
know pasture raised you know the cows

398
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:55,040
are out there eating grass so if you're

399
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:57,720
into meat that's the kind of get there's

400
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:00,079
no doubt you don't want Factory you

401
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,959
don't want that g garbage Factory meat

402
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:04,440
that's just filled with you know GMO

403
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:06,560
corn and GMO soy and the conditions are

404
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,519
unbearable you want the grass-fed beef

405
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:11,240
you know we know that if you're into

406
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:13,040
meat same thing with chickens same thing

407
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,199
with turkeys you want it all free range

408
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:18,279
you want it cage free you want all of

409
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:20,880
that and hopefully even grass you know

410
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:22,759
free pasture raised and so uh the

411
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,560
chickens and the turkeys can eat little

412
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:26,720
bits of seeds and stuff that are

413
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,279
naturally in the wild and grass seeds

414
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,759
and everything else that they pluck out

415
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:35,759
of the ground and bugs and insects

416
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:38,920
because you want that wild attachment to

417
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:42,000
it but what about the greens the greens

418
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:43,639
have to be there no matter what you like

419
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,680
talking to other person are like I only

420
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:47,199
like fish it's say everything from the

421
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,720
ocean is what I like well I said you

422
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:52,720
better not be doing the tuna you better

423
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,600
not be doing the tuna no tuna for you

424
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,920
they're like well I love tuna I do you

425
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,480
know I go out and get sushi and I do the

426
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:01,040
tuna that's what the person will say to

427
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,639
you know said to me and I said well okay

428
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,640
you're okay sure you know you like you

429
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:08,760
like the tuna okay fine well you better

430
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:12,000
then be eating a lot of greens and

431
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:15,360
preferably herbal greens like

432
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:18,240
cantro and parsley to bind on to all

433
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:20,199
that excess Mercury you're leaving in

434
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,079
your intestinal tract colon in liver

435
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:24,319
from that tuna and like I never never

436
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:27,319
thought about that I don't really eat

437
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,720
many greens I'm worried about my protein

438
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:30,360
you know so it's everybody's worried

439
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,080
about protein protein protein and

440
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:34,160
they're not eating any greens do you

441
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:37,320
guys get what I'm going there do you see

442
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:40,120
what I'm saying do you see what I'm

443
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:44,160
saying you know what I mean because

444
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:48,799
where's the most powerful protein there

445
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:51,799
is on the planet that actually does do a

446
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:56,440
lot for the human body where does that

447
00:17:51,799 --> 00:18:00,240
lie it lies in Greens it's in spinach

448
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:03,360
it's in kale it's in parsley you know

449
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:05,679
it's in it's in barley

450
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:08,520
grass I like the barley grass cheese pow

451
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:10,280
it's in that it's in all of that that's

452
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:12,960
where those those

453
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:14,919
microproteins they're simulatable they

454
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,320
absorb they break down they do things

455
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:18,760
they got amino acids attached to them

456
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:21,880
actively

457
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:23,240
bioactiv so you want those proteins I

458
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:25,000
tell people look okay sure you're

459
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,720
getting a lot of protein from fish I I I

460
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,080
okay I'm with you I'm not I'm not you

461
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,480
know fighting you on that but where's

462
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,360
your where's your bioidentical protein

463
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,039
you know and they're like what are you

464
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:38,559
talking about I go you know from the

465
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:39,960
greens from the greens and so you know

466
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,679
so so if you want to do fish make sure

467
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,559
you do a salad with that fish you want

468
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,360
to do tuna you better have that Tuna on

469
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:48,240
top of a big salad so if you guys like

470
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:50,840
tuna regardless of the Mercury I I'll

471
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,240
stand behind you but put it in a big

472
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:55,080
salad you know if you guys like

473
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:57,280
grass-fed beef because you guys are into

474
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:59,520
that kind of diet I stand behind you

475
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:02,640
let's get a with let's make sure we have

476
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:05,159
a nice salad of leafy greens going on

477
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,799
there you guys are into Wild game like I

478
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:08,520
run into you know a few people here and

479
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,640
there it's just everything is wild wild

480
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:12,720
turkey whatever they can find then you

481
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,960
know wild pheasants they order them they

482
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,200
ship them you ship them they ship Frozen

483
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,320
or something now you can get wild

484
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:21,880
pheasants then then yeah then where's

485
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:23,880
your greens though where's your

486
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:25,480
greens because that's what the pheasants

487
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:29,320
were eating Where's your green you've

488
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:31,600
got you know that has to be in the mix

489
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,600
the

490
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:36,559
bioidentical proteins that will actually

491
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:39,600
help the animal proteins work better for

492
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:41,640
you so the protein in the fish is going

493
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:45,200
to work better for you when you actually

494
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:46,600
have your greens the protein in the wild

495
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,120
turkey it's going to work for you when

496
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,960
you have your greens the protein in the

497
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,880
wild game or whatever the grassed beef

498
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:54,880
you name it it's going to work better

499
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:57,120
for you and then if you're a vegan or a

500
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,480
vegetarian I tell vegans and vegetarians

501
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:03,039
all the time you better eating a lot of

502
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:05,799
greens they better be there you can't

503
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:07,840
you can't not have them in there you

504
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:09,440
know I mean fruits are critical in our

505
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,600
life I don't care who's eating what diet

506
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,880
you got to get some fruit in there if

507
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,320
you want longevity because of

508
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,400
antioxidants you want your you don't

509
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,440
want your brain to rot and oxidize you

510
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:20,080
better be eating fruit it's not about a

511
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,080
belief system it's not about sugar no

512
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,799
sugar fruit's bad fruit's not bad no

513
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,799
it's about longevity it's about making

514
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:28,320
sure your butt makes it all the way to

515
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:31,440
the end and that's going to happen

516
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:35,080
antioxidants and fruits but

517
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:39,520
greens have mineral salts in them

518
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:40,760
mineral salts in them critical ones and

519
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,200
critical

520
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:46,000
proteins they do critical proteins and

521
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,320
mineral salts so I tell vegans and

522
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,159
vegetarians you better be eating your

523
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:51,960
leafy greens I want a spinach salad

524
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:55,120
going on I want a spinach smoothie throw

525

two bunches of

527
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:01,520
spinach okay or a container of spinach

the that's what you need right there

542
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,320
that has to be in between everything

543
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:37,640
else you're

544
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:39,400
eating and if you're into animal

545
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:41,960
products then get that spinach salad

546
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:45,159
going now don't don't grill that spinach

547
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:47,919
don't Grill it don't throw it in a pot

548
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:50,080
and steam it up no no but have a spinach

549
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,720
salad if you want some grassed beef make

550
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,240
sure you're you you're doing enough

551
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,320
spinach

552
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:59,120
salad get the

553
00:21:55,320 --> 00:22:00,760
greens so it's about making sure you're

554
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,880
getting something no matter what that

555
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:05,600
you're supposed to get that's helping

556
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,279
you no matter what diet you choose for

557
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,799
your health or what diet you've been

558
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:12,200
pushed into you know from you know uh

559
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:13,679
something out there some kind of pseudo

560
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,679
science telling you why you need to eat

561
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:18,840
a certain way or some kind of you know

562
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:21,720
prehistoric science that really is just

563
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:23,440
isn't just accurate so whatever it is

564
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,919
that's going on just make sure the

565
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:28,279
greens are in there bottom line you know

566
00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:29,919
whether you're vegan whe whether you're

567
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:31,520
a Paleo whether you're whatever whether

568
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,679
you're what whatever brand you're doing

569
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,440
Mediterranean whether you're doing

570
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:38,360
Atkins whatever you're doing so the deal

571
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,400
is is make sure the greens are in there

572
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:42,520
so okay I'm glad we covered that we're

573
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,919
going to cover a lot of things now

574
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:48,120
there's something there's a big

575
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:50,760
confusion a big confusion out there

576
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:53,520
about the brain and we're going to do a

577
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:55,760
brain show that that is coming up but

578
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,760
there's a big confusion about the brain

579
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:01,000
and I I want to make sure we clear it up

580
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:04,279
here here we clear it up now because

581
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,880
it's important now if I say what's your

582
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:08,880
brain made out of what are you guys

583
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,039
going to say what are you guys going to

584
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,919
think all right so what's your brain

585
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:15,880
made out of what are you thinking you

586
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,559
thinking are you thinking what it's made

587
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:20,840
out

588
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:23,120
of my first my first thing to say would

589
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,640
be it's made out of brain but I'm just

590
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,200
being silly that's just to me always

591
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,520
being silly but what do you guys think

592
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:30,960
it's made out of well there's a lot of

593
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:33,440
transends and fads right now that have

594
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,080
pretty much telling us oh your brain is

595
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:41,640
made out of

596
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:45,520
fat not n not okay the brain's not made

597
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:47,480
out of fat it's not the brain's made out

598
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:52,039
of glycogen

599
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:55,200
storage glycogen storage okay that's

600
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:56,880
what it's made out of it's made out of

601
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,640
stored

602
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,600
carbohydrates

603
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:05,640
that's what it's made out

604
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:06,840
of it melts in your mouth if someone

605
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:09,320
eats

606
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:14,000
it it's

607
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:16,159
sweet and it's like basically a brown

608
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,919
rice pasta if you guys ever eaten a

609
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,600
brown rice pasta now I haven't eaten

610
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:22,919
brain but I'm telling you right now a

611
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:25,600
lot of people eat brains out there they

612
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:27,279
eat sheep's brains and lamb brains and

613
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,200
and all kinds of different animal brains

614
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:31,760
out there cow brains there's cowb brains

615
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,559
and supplements don't take those don't

616
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,200
take those supplements by the way don't

617
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:37,679
take any supplements with any animal

618
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,120
parts in them because it's always

619
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:41,320
questionable about where those animal

620
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:45,520
parts came from cuz supplement companies

621
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:47,760
have to Chin every penny and every dime

622
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:51,360
in order to survive and I just never

623
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:54,640
trust where sources lie um but the point

624
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:56,919
is is that people eat brain out there

625
00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:00,240
they do all across the world in

626
00:24:56,919 --> 00:25:03,159
different places I've heard from many

627
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,960
accounts many accounts even had a friend

628
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:07,760
that tried brain when they were

629
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:11,200
traveling and it was

630
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:16,080
sweet sweet is what it

631
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:17,840
was okay it was like not candy sweet

632
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:21,360
carbohydrate

633
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:23,559
sweet and science already knew this is

634
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:26,039
what I love about science science can be

635
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:28,279
twisted in every way in every angle in

636
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:30,520
any direction for any reason for

637
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:33,480
anybody's purpose at any time and that's

638
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:35,360
why spirit and I kind of back away from

639
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,640
science and spir I always say Spirit

640
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,600
trumps

641
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,360
science and because it's about results

642
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,799
and about truth and it's about truth and

643
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,120
it's not about propaganda and it's not

644
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:49,399
about interest groups spirit is above

645
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:52,279
that but the point is is that the brain

646
00:25:49,399 --> 00:25:55,000
once was that was discovered it's

647
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:57,880
glycogen that was a correct Discovery

648
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,360
and then it flipped later on like like

649
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:02,919
just recently with fads and Trends where

650
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:04,520
we're now convinced that it's made out

651
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:06,880
of fat now it's not made out of fat

652
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:10,720
there are traces of Omega-3s plus traces

653
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:16,279
of other rare oils in the

654
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:19,640
brain rare rare oils and fats traces

655
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:25,320
only and those traces come from hemp

656
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:29,240
seeds walnuts they come from butterleaf

657
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:33,440
lettuce they come from Black

658
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:37,000
berries they come from wild blueberries

659
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:39,159
traces of Mega 3s in them and other rare

660
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,760
omegas I'm I'm not just even talking

661
00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:44,799
about three sixes and nines I'm talking

662
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:47,520
about rare not even identified yet

663
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:49,200
groups of omegas not

664
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,880
nonidentified that's what's cool about

665
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:54,720
the life-changing Foods book is I just

666
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:58,799
love going into the stuff by the way um

667
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:01,840
so so basically that's in the brain but

668
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:06,120
it only accounts for a tiny percentage

669
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:07,640
of the brain the rest of it is

670
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:13,080
salt

671
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:14,559
salt okay salt and sugar sugar the

672
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,320
brain's made out of sugar but it's made

673
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:18,360
out of a carbohydrate polysaccharide is

674
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:22,080
made out of glycogen

675
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:24,279
glycogen a polysaccharide a a starch a

676
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,840
carbohydrate a

677
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:29,000
starch I'm just trying to get this point

678
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:31,080
across

679
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,320
because we need to know what the brain's

680
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:36,039
made out of because when you're dealing

681
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:37,360
with vegetables one of the Holy four

682
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:38,600
when you're dealing with vegetables you

683
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,120
got to know what you're dealing with and

684
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,279
you're dealing with precious vital

685
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:45,840
mineral

686
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:47,760
salts mineral salts for neurotransmitter

687
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,640
chemicals actually to create

688
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:53,000
neurotransmitter chemicals to be a

689
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:55,880
neurotransmitter chemicals and amino

690
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,799
acids precious life-giving amino acids

691
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:01,519
are in vegetables the ones that go to

692
00:27:57,799 --> 00:28:03,880
the brain and charge up the electro the

693
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:08,360
the um charge up electrolytes charge up

694
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:10,480
electrical impulses fire up GLE cells so

695
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:12,360
this is serious stuff this is vegetables

696
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,919
so you know I was telling you like well

697
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:15,399
you got to eat your vegetables when

698
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:19,039
you're told as a child it's important to

699
00:28:15,399 --> 00:28:21,720
eat your vegetables but why this is why

700
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:23,840
this is why because if you don't eat

701
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:27,799
your vegetables you won't have the

702
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:30,159
conductor the conductor for the brain

703
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:32,960
which is part of the electricity which

704
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:37,799
is all the precious vital mineral salts

705
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:40,039
and if you don't eat fruits or starchy

706
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:42,799
vegetables or vegetables that have

707
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:46,279
carbohydrates in them if you don't eat

708
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:49,240
those you won't have a glycogen storage

709
00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:51,279
a glucose storage in the brain a sugar

710
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:54,720
storage in the

711
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:57,240
brain that gives you a brain because

712
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,679
your brain's made out of that I don't

713
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:00,480
care care what book comes around the

714
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:04,000
corner tomorrow I don't care what

715
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:06,080
concept I don't care what person expert

716
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,720
says oh no no the brain's made out of

717
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,840
fat you got to keep away from your sugar

718
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:12,000
you know what's going to happen your

719
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:15,399
brain is going to shrink your brain

720
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:19,000
shrinks and shrivels up without glycogen

721
00:29:15,399 --> 00:29:22,159
which is carbohydrates which is out

722
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,919
glucose and then without the conductor

723
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:27,600
the mineral

724
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:29,440
salts that's a fact Jack that's a fact

vegetables let's talk about it

743
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:13,120
vegetables provide these mineral salts

744
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:15,799
they provide these critical things that

745
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:19,200
actually give us life it gives us a

746
00:30:15,799 --> 00:30:22,000
brain a brain is made out of literally

747
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:25,120
these mineral salts and then

748
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:28,440
carbohydrate that's what our brain is

749
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:29,720
made out of how do you like that how do

750
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:32,399

00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:34,000
apples so let's go into some of these

752
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:36,720
because it's really important to go into

753
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,919
some of these um talk about the leafy

754
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:42,000
greens what can leafy greens do for us

755
00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:44,200
what can they help they can totally help

756
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,039
acidosis right when our body systems

757
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:48,559
become so acidic that disease State

758
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:50,559
happens and occurs that means that any

759
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:52,200
viruses bacteria pathogens in you they

760
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:54,000

761
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:56,320
opportunity to take over if you're if

762
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,000
you're really acidic if you're eating

763
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:01,840
you know just no vegetables and no fruit

764
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,240
you get really acidic so any kind of

765
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,720
heartburn it prevents heartburn it may

766
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,960
not fix it on the spot right when you

767
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:09,799
eat your first Leaf of lettuce but it's

768
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:12,880
going to help it in a long time not

769
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:14,919
occur okay iron deficiencies especially

770
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,639
do do by viruses like Epstein bar

771
00:31:14,919 --> 00:31:20,039

you like I'm not a big Iceberg fan I'm

783
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:48,440
not a big iceberg lettuce fan okay I

784
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:51,799
remember being a kid when Spirit was

785
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:53,399
telling me in a grocery store you know I

786
00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:54,880
I don't know you you guys might know the

787
00:31:53,399 --> 00:31:57,320
story but you know I used to work in a

788
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:00,159
grocery store when I was 14 years old

789
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:01,760
and I was stocking shelves and um I just

790
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:03,880
needed something to do to take my mind

791
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:06,120
off of spirit and but of course Spirit

792
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,880
would actually you know tell every every

793
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:10,639
single Shopper that was there in the

794
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:11,880
store pushing their cart by Spirit would

795
00:32:10,639 --> 00:32:13,720
tell me what was going on with their

796
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:15,039
health what they needed for food and

797
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,480
that's where I built up my first

798
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:20,519
clientele at age

799
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:22,960
14 and and and so um so I go around the

800
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:24,760
store even the owner of the store was a

801
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:28,799
client of mine the owner of the store it

802
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:30,519
was a big grocery store and um so and he

803
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:32,679
he became the client of mine because it

804
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:34,919
was inconceivable of how I would know he

805
00:32:32,679 --> 00:32:34,919
had

806
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:40,679
gout you well because of spirit of

807
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:43,240
course anyway the the whole thing is the

808
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:45,039
whole thing is is that iceberg lettuce

809
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:48,279
was like the only thing on the Shelf

810
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:50,000
back then practically I'm serious it was

811
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:51,440
I mean depending where you were like I

812
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,120
said if you were in California that

813
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,880
would be an exception everywhere where

814
00:32:53,120 --> 00:33:00,000
else in the United States it was iceberg

815
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:01,360
lettuce and and I hated it I hated it

816
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,960
cuz it was iceberg lettuce because

817
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:05,399
Spirit would say well there's not a lot

818
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,559
in here and it was conventional iceberg

819
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:08,960
lettuce and spirit would tell me there's

820
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:11,080
not a lot in here but spirit said to me

821
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,080
you wait you wait and see what happens

822
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:15,559

863
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:51,520
power of leafy greens leafy greens hold

864
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:55,040
great

865
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:57,040
power and it it's actually an incredible

866
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:00,400
incredible experience to bring these

867
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:01,720
into your life so there's something

868
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,520
there's something that I really love

869
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:07,920
another thing another vegetable

870
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:09,640
radishes radishes who's eating radishes

871
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,680
are you guys eating any radishes did you

872
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:15,960
know when you have your salad and you

873
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:18,320
have a SL slice of radish on top that

874
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:21,079
that radish is probably one of the most

875
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,599
powerful things on top of that salad I

876
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:24,800
mean even with all those leafy greens

877
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:26,280
around the radish is a medicine it's a

878
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,320
different kind of medicine it's like

879
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:31,119
having a pill that you think is you know

880
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:33,119
really valuable in the pharmaceutical

881
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:35,720
world that's a medicine it's like having

882
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:39,800
that pill sitting on top of your salad

883
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:42,520
you know um so anyway uh the radish is

884
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:46,280
even more powerful than that of course

885
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:48,640
so radishes are like a little miracle

886
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:51,319
the greens on top are practically a wild

887
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,960

928
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:29,839
doctors still don't understand but he

929
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:31,720
was given the diagnosis of ALS and he

930
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:34,319
really had a severe neurological

931
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:36,839
condition and that's unknown to medical

932
00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:40,240
research and medical science but Spirit

933
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:44,160
knew um he had to eat eight radishes

934
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:45,760
every single day eight radishes daily

935
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:48,720
and he improved

936
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:52,359
50% when the only other way he was going

937
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:55,520
was opposite and fast and he improved

938
00:37:52,359 --> 00:37:57,319

950
00:38:18,319 --> 00:38:23,680
be an anti-inflammatory like a medicine

951
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:26,880

actually stop Hashimoto so don't fall

1010
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:43,480
into that whole mistake that that trend

1011
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:45,359
of goitrogenic being a problem if you're

1012
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:47,800
new to my information and you just

1013
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:49,920
logged on to this first time learn about

1014
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:53,200
it read about it or listen to what I've

1015
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:55,040
talked about before and um because don't

1016
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,800
fall into that goitrogenic mistake

1017
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:59,440
that's out there terrible because it's

1018
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:02,480
not true um there's phytochemicals

1019
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:05,079
undiscovered in these vegetables that

1020
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:07,480
stop those cogenic properties from being

1021
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:09,440
a problem and stop thyroid issues

1022
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:11,280
because first of all you need to know

1023
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:13,319
what's wrong with the thyroid to even

1024
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,800
know how to treat it or how to to

1025
00:41:13,319 --> 00:41:16,079
address it and apparently medical

1026
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,960
research and medical science both

1027
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:19,839
alternatively and conventionally doesn't

1028
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:22,200
know yet up until I brought it to the

1029
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:24,280
table that Epstein bar causes Hashimoto

1030
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:26,440
and to kill off Epstein bar you need

1031
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:28,119
certain things cruciferous vegetables

1032
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:29,839
one of them so you keep the kale in

1033
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:33,400
there keep the collards in there you

1034
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:36,839
keep all of that going on um I like the

1035
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:38,839
emotional support of these vegetables

1036
00:41:36,839 --> 00:41:41,680
that's what I like they're really

1037
00:41:38,839 --> 00:41:43,119
amazing like like for instance okay if

1038
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:45,440
you know if you know anybody that's

1039
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:48,160
baffled all the time or bewildered or

1040
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,880
befuddled or just you know confused if

1041
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:52,119
you know somebody that's struggling with

1042
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:53,520
that and you know you want them to get

1043
00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:55,640
the support they need just get them

1044
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:58,800
eating more broccoli getting them eating

1045
00:41:55,640 --> 00:42:01,640
more cul flour because the mineral salts

1046
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:04,119
in here not only support the brain but

1047
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:06,240
they help an emotional part of the brain

1048
00:42:04,119 --> 00:42:09,280
so this is an emotional support

1049
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:11,000
vegetable group that helps helps people

1050
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,280
get out of that always seem like they're

1051
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,599
confused always seem like they're

1052
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,599
baffled always seem like they're

1053
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:18,040
bewildered even if they're brilliant

1054
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:21,119
people of course and they have this

1055
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:23,040
going on you want these vegetables keep

that right there so we want to bring in

1233
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:50,839
those cucumbers so think about that and

1234
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:55,280
on an emotional level do you know

1235
00:49:50,839 --> 00:49:57,119
anybody that has a lot of anger do you

1236
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,680

00:50:16,799 --> 00:50:21,960
emotional lesson that Spirit has taught

1247
