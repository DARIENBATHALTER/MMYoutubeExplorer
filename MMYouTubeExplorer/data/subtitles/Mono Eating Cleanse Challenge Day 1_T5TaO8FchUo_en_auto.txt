[386.08 - 390.32] like high school i've heard that so many
[388.64 - 394.00] times from the moderating cleanse
[390.32 - 395.04] not constantly eating all day either and
[394.00 - 396.96] you're allowed to
[395.04 - 398.16] by the way you guys you're allowed to
[396.96 - 400.56] eat more and that's a
[398.16 - 402.32] hot topic i'm covering because here's
[400.56 - 403.60] what's going to happen
[402.32 - 405.36] someone's going to be like all right i'm
[403.60 - 406.80] doing the mono eating cleanse and
[405.36 - 407.68] they're going to grab a banana be like i
[406.80 - 409.36] ate a banana
[407.68 - 410.88] and that's it right and that's it they
[409.36 - 412.56] ate one banana and they're just going to
[410.88 - 413.76] be all of a sudden starving and they're
[412.56 - 416.00] going to hit the wall and they don't
[413.76 - 418.00] realize they could eat a lot of bananas
[416.00 - 419.60] you can eat bananas all day long if you
[418.00 - 420.88] want to you know because i know some
[419.60 - 422.08] people like alright i'm ready for the
[420.88 - 425.28] mono eating cleanse
[422.08 - 427.36] for three days and i'm like dude that's
[425.28 - 428.56] one two three four five six seven eight
[427.36 - 430.72] bananas
[428.56 - 433.12] so that's not gonna be enough if you're
[430.72 - 435.60] gonna do the banana one for three days
[433.12 - 437.28] eight bananas that's not enough you're
[435.60 - 439.60] getting any bunches of bananas so you
[437.28 - 441.04] guys guys got to be prepared
[439.60 - 442.16] so i just want to i'm going to make sure
[441.04 - 443.84] i'm telling you this so no one's
[442.16 - 445.76] confused because it's easy
[443.84 - 447.20] to get confused about this so let's go
[445.76 - 449.28] into it a little bit we got the lemon
[447.20 - 451.28] water right here 16 to 32 ounces of
[449.28 - 452.96] lemon water first thing in the morning
[451.28 - 454.80] that's what i'm doing now i didn't
[452.96 - 456.56] mention this yesterday but you can do
[454.80 - 459.28] lemon water again
[456.56 - 460.40] if you want you can do a couple of them
[459.28 - 463.04] three of them
[460.40 - 464.40] you can do them all right so it's okay
[463.04 - 465.76] it doesn't have to be your only lemon
[464.40 - 467.60] water if you don't want
[465.76 - 468.80] you can be putting lemon in water all
[467.60 - 471.84] day long
[468.80 - 473.20] perfectly fine karen churchill can we
[471.84 - 476.48] include lemon water or
[473.20 - 477.84] lemon balm tea at night if you want to
[476.48 - 479.92] include lemon balm tea
[477.84 - 481.20] at night you can but you can include
[479.92 - 483.84] lemon
[481.20 - 484.72] water on and off all day just letting
[483.84 - 486.96] you know okay
[484.72 - 487.84] so there's the lemon water 16 to 32
[486.96 - 492.48] ounces
[487.84 - 494.08] right we got that
[492.48 - 495.52] david lopez i'm gonna answer as many
[494.08 - 496.64] questions as i can because that's what
[495.52 - 500.16] we're about
[496.64 - 502.64] can we mono eat coconut water well
[500.16 - 504.32] that's a cleanse right that's a cleanse
[502.64 - 507.60] too but what that is
[504.32 - 509.60] is that's a juice fast
[507.60 - 511.84] so if you just mono eat coconut water
[509.60 - 514.08] you're now on a juice fast
[511.84 - 514.88] coconut juice fast right that's what
[514.08 - 516.96] you're doing
[514.88 - 519.04] now that's an entirely different story
[516.96 - 520.72] okay the problem is with those
[519.04 - 522.08] kinds of things when you're just doing
[520.72 - 524.08] coconut water and you're just doing a
[522.08 - 526.72] coconut juice fast
[524.08 - 528.08] you're going to be running on adrenaline
[526.72 - 530.88] it's not going to be enough
[528.08 - 532.24] calories to allow you to function so
[530.88 - 532.88] then your adrenals are going to be
[532.24 - 534.56] flooding
[532.88 - 536.40] is what's going to happen all right so
[534.56 - 538.32] let's take the adrenals out for a second
[536.40 - 541.68] and take a look at those babies
[538.32 - 544.40] right now which i'm doing
[541.68 - 545.84] right here now you might be somebody
[544.40 - 549.76] that's like
[545.84 - 553.60] you know what i'm going to outsmart aw
[549.76 - 554.80] i'm an outsmart aw i'm going to do
[553.60 - 556.80] and i'm not saying that's what you're
[554.80 - 557.76] doing you know you're trying to outsmart
[556.80 - 558.72] me but there's a lot of people they're
[557.76 - 559.04] going to be like i'm going to outsmart
[558.72 - 560.96] him
[559.04 - 563.36] i'm just going to do a cleanse i looked
[560.96 - 564.56] up some juice fast somewhere
[563.36 - 566.24] i know that's not what you're doing but
[564.56 - 567.28] you know someone else might right and
[566.24 - 568.64] then we'd be like
[567.28 - 570.00] you know this mono-eating cleanse is
[568.64 - 571.44] cool but i'm going to go and do i'm
[570.00 - 572.56] going to really try to detox and what
[571.44 - 575.12] you're going to do
[572.56 - 576.08] is you're going to try to detox but
[575.12 - 577.68] you're going to make yourself
[576.08 - 579.60] toxic you're going to fill yourself up
[577.68 - 581.04] adrenaline so what happens is the minute
[579.60 - 584.40] you start going into this
[581.04 - 587.76] long-term juice fast or long-term
[584.40 - 588.72] water fast or long-term coconut water
[587.76 - 590.64] fast
[588.72 - 591.92] you're going to end up hitting the wall
[590.64 - 593.36] you're not going to have enough glucose
[591.92 - 595.20] for your brain and your brain is going
[593.36 - 597.04] to be like i'm starving with glucose i'm
[595.20 - 599.20] starving the glucose and your adrenals
[597.04 - 600.80] are going to release adrenaline
[599.20 - 602.96] and you're going to just saturate your
[600.80 - 605.52] liver with adrenaline
[602.96 - 606.32] that's not going to be productive at all
[605.52 - 609.04] it's not
[606.32 - 611.20] the mono eating cleanse you actually eat
[609.04 - 612.88] and you cleanse but you eat and you
[611.20 - 615.52] protect yourself
[612.88 - 616.96] you protect your adrenals you see guys
[615.52 - 619.44] how important that is
[616.96 - 621.12] you protect your adrenals the minute
[619.44 - 623.04] someone wants to be like ah
[621.12 - 624.96] i'll just i'll just do this instead or
[623.04 - 626.56] i'll go do this instead okay fine you're
[624.96 - 627.68] just gonna burn your adrenals out you're
[626.56 - 628.48] gonna fill your liver filled with
[627.68 - 629.60] adrenaline
[628.48 - 632.08] you're gonna starve your brain of
[629.60 - 634.96] glucose coconut water doesn't
[632.08 - 635.60] have enough glucose in it there's not
[634.96 - 638.64] enough
[635.60 - 639.84] sugar in it to feed your brain while

[639.84 - 643.76] but yeah it's great but you know it's
[642.64 - 645.12] not enough
[643.76 - 647.52] that's why we're doing the moderating
[645.12 - 650.32] cleanse this is really important to know
[647.52 - 650.96] all this information digital lemon water
[650.32 - 654.08] so
[650.96 - 658.72] celery juice that's next
[654.08 - 661.84] right you can do a little celery juice
[658.72 - 661.84] and um
[661.92 - 665.52] look you guys you don't have to do this
[664.00 - 666.96] celery juice at
[665.52 - 668.48] in the morning if you really didn't want
[666.96 - 670.40] to let's cover that a little bit i know
[668.48 - 672.40] someone had a question that said
[670.40 - 674.16] when can i do the celery juice what if i
[672.40 - 675.76] want to have it later
[674.16 - 678.24] and you can have it later and that's
[675.76 - 679.36] fine okay you can have it later and
[678.24 - 682.16] that's all right
[679.36 - 682.72] but i like having it in the morning it's
[682.16 - 685.12] best
[682.72 - 686.72] then so i'm giving you different options
[685.12 - 688.24] and stuff but i like it in the morning
[686.72 - 689.20] that's when it's best i'm just letting
[688.24 - 690.48] you know
[689.20 - 691.60] so i'm going to make some really quick
[690.48 - 693.12] some celery juice and then we're going

[696.00 - 703.12] right
[698.16 - 704.80] so uh just get this over here
[703.12 - 706.24] the reason why celery juice is so
[704.80 - 707.68] important on the model eating cleanse
[706.24 - 708.48] because you have to have the mineral
[707.68 - 711.68] salts

[956.40 - 960.32] though because it's you know it's really
[958.00 - 962.16] powerful
[960.32 - 964.80] got a question on tick tock can we eat
[962.16 - 966.48] spinach's lettuce
[964.80 - 968.08] all depends on how sensitive you are
[966.48 - 971.92] right you're somebody with
[968.08 - 975.60] really bad crohn's colitis
[971.92 - 977.84] right real bad intestinal problems
[975.60 - 978.72] you've had surgeries already things like
[977.84 - 980.80] that
[978.72 - 982.24] then you just you you don't want to eat
[980.80 - 983.36] a lot of the spinach of something you're
[982.24 - 985.36] not used to
[983.36 - 987.28] something that you're not used to doing
[985.36 - 988.80] okay
[987.28 - 990.56] but if you're somebody that doesn't have
[988.80 - 992.16] anything you know serious going around
[990.56 - 993.44] like you haven't been struggling really
[992.16 - 994.48] bad with your food you're not
[993.44 - 996.24] hypersensitive
[994.48 - 998.80] all those kinds of things sure you can
[996.24 - 1002.00] use some spinach if you really have to
[998.80 - 1003.68] teresa lettuce what does lettuce do for
[1002.00 - 1006.80] us
[1003.68 - 1007.44] it's got a chemical compound that
[1006.80 - 1011.84] creates
[1007.44 - 1015.52] this kind of milk right lettuce milk
[1011.84 - 1018.96] just so you know not bovine milk
[1015.52 - 1022.64] lettuce milk right
[1018.96 - 1025.36] that lettuce milk
[1022.64 - 1026.64] is really soothing and gentle on the
[1025.36 - 1030.16] intestinal tract
[1026.64 - 1032.56] lining okay that's what's amazing about
[1030.16 - 1037.84] using the lettuce for this
[1032.56 - 1040.72] right lettuce is antiviral anti-pathogen
[1037.84 - 1041.92] lettuce is anti-fungus the bad fungus
[1040.72 - 1045.04] anti-mold
[1041.92 - 1046.16] anti-yeast okay so that's what lettuce
[1045.04 - 1049.12] is
[1046.16 - 1051.44] a couple of things plus it's got the
[1049.12 - 1054.64] mineral salts as well different kinds
[1051.44 - 1057.12] kimberly heiner what if you're allergic
[1054.64 - 1058.80] to celery
[1057.12 - 1060.56] look if you're somebody that you eat a
[1058.80 - 1061.76] celery stick your throat closes up and
[1060.56 - 1067.12] you're up at the er
[1061.76 - 1071.44] then don't touch celery don't touch it
[1067.12 - 1073.20] right um but do you mean can i can i
[1071.44 - 1074.56] just have you be your own detective
[1073.20 - 1076.72] if that's okay can you be your own
[1074.56 - 1080.32] detective for a second
[1076.72 - 1082.80] right do you mean you're allergic
[1080.32 - 1085.84] because someone said you are
[1082.80 - 1088.08] but when you eat celery you're fine
[1085.84 - 1090.16] so you've had celery before you've had
[1088.08 - 1090.88] it chopped up in a tuna salad you've had
[1090.16 - 1092.96] it
[1090.88 - 1094.48] chopped up in tuna fish sandwich you had
[1092.96 - 1095.68] a crudite one time in your life but you
[1094.48 - 1098.48] had no problems
[1095.68 - 1100.72] or is it something where you're allergic
[1098.48 - 1101.12] to celery because you had that all cat
[1100.72 - 1102.80] test
[1101.12 - 1104.56] you had a food sensitivity test and
[1102.80 - 1105.76] there were 20 foods in there and they're
[1104.56 - 1110.88] like celery
[1105.76 - 1112.80] uh ragweed uh uh peppercorns uh
[1110.88 - 1114.08] you know strawberry and you had this
[1112.80 - 1115.60] thing where it was like
[1114.08 - 1117.28] all these things they're telling you
[1115.60 - 1118.08] allergic to but yeah you didn't have a
[1117.28 - 1120.72] problem
[1118.08 - 1122.24] first of all i don't trust a single one
[1120.72 - 1123.76] of those tests if a family member went
[1122.24 - 1124.64] and got any of those food sensitivities
[1123.76 - 1126.32] tests i would
[1124.64 - 1128.00] just i would be like i don't trust any
[1126.32 - 1130.24] any one of those at all because
[1128.00 - 1131.04] it's a scam all of that but if you're
[1130.24 - 1133.60] somebody that
[1131.04 - 1134.88] your mouth swells up because you eat a
[1133.60 - 1137.28] celery stick
[1134.88 - 1138.40] or you're now something happens you
[1137.28 - 1139.84] can't breathe or you
[1138.40 - 1142.08] because you're like getting a severe
[1139.84 - 1147.60] allergic reaction don't touch it
[1142.08 - 1147.60] no way don't touch it don't touch it
[1148.40 - 1154.56] so okay so we got a little bit of taking
[1151.44 - 1156.40] the juicer down for a second you guys
[1154.56 - 1159.36] all right we got some celery juice right
[1156.40 - 1162.24] here 16 to 32 ounces of celery juice
[1159.36 - 1162.24] really important
[1162.64 - 1165.76] like i said if you don't have celery and
[1164.64 - 1167.60] you don't have some meaning you don't
[1165.76 - 1168.16] have the celery juice or anything like
[1167.60 - 1170.24] that
[1168.16 - 1171.60] you know we can always try to work
[1170.24 - 1174.24] around it but you're going to have to
[1171.60 - 1176.80] eat a lot more lettuce

[2035.28 - 2040.32] eyes okay good point
[2037.28 - 2040.32] let's get a potato now
[2040.88 - 2045.28] this potato you'll see has a little
[2043.52 - 2046.56] cutout right here
[2045.28 - 2048.96] you guys this is really important
[2046.56 - 2049.68] information dr sherry green good to see
[2048.96 - 2052.64] you
[2049.68 - 2053.60] incredible doctor see the little cut out
[2052.64 - 2054.80] here
[2053.60 - 2058.16] see where i flip this there's a little
[2054.80 - 2060.72] cut out here the potato is just starting
[2058.16 - 2062.24] to send out a little sprout
[2060.72 - 2064.24] you could see it was a white little
[2062.24 - 2066.80] sprout poking out of it
[2064.24 - 2068.80] you cut those little white sprouts off
[2066.80 - 2073.04] if your potatoes now
[2068.80 - 2076.28] blooming yeah those are too far gone
[2073.04 - 2080.24] too far gone so if your potatoes are
[2076.28 - 2082.96] sprouting like blooming
[2080.24 - 2084.40] like flowers it looks like almost you're
[2082.96 - 2086.64] too far gone
[2084.40 - 2088.08] potatoes too far gone okay this was just
[2086.64 - 2090.00] where you saw them they were sprouting
[2088.08 - 2091.84] out a little bit little white sprout
[2090.00 - 2093.84] and i just kind of like took the knife
[2091.84 - 2094.72] and i just took took the little pieces
[2093.84 - 2096.32] off
[2094.72 - 2098.16] the best potatoes are the ones that
[2096.32 - 2100.00] aren't sprouting but i'm just saying you
[2098.16 - 2101.76] can if they're just starting to send out
[2100.00 - 2103.52] sprouts yeah you can literally take the
[2101.76 - 2105.68] little pieces off that's what i did
[2103.52 - 2107.28] but if it's actually shooting out like
[2105.68 - 2108.72] starting to grow and starting to look
[2107.28 - 2111.12] like it's it's out of control no you
[2108.72 - 2114.64] don't want to do that it's not good
[2111.12 - 2116.00] so let's i'll show you how to put the
[2114.64 - 2117.60] fruit in the lettuce so you can
[2116.00 - 2119.92] take a piece of lettuce that's what you
[2117.60 - 2121.44] can do right
[2119.92 - 2123.20] and i showed you earlier but i'm going
[2121.44 - 2124.08] to show you again i'm putting banana and
[2123.20 - 2126.56] papaya in
[2124.08 - 2127.76] the lettuce boat right that's what i'm
[2126.56 - 2130.00] doing
[2127.76 - 2131.76] banana papaya and the lesbo can you can
[2130.00 - 2133.28] you refrigerate the potatoes yes you can
[2131.76 - 2133.76] leave them in there that's what i do all
[2133.28 - 2135.20] the time
[2133.76 - 2136.64] in fact i use a lot of refrigerated
[2135.20 - 2138.48] potatoes when i'm out here doing my
[2136.64 - 2140.56] demonstrations with you guys
[2138.48 - 2141.60] can we add garlic to the potato cleanse
[2140.56 - 2143.36] no
[2141.60 - 2145.04] keep the garlic out yeah garlic's
[2143.36 - 2146.80] amazing for you i talk about that all
[2145.04 - 2147.68] the time it's incredible food incredible
[2146.80 - 2148.96] herb
[2147.68 - 2150.80] but no you don't want that in the
[2148.96 - 2152.00] monopoles there's a reason why it's the
[2150.80 - 2155.08] mono cleanse
[2152.00 - 2158.64] when you simplify you guys
[2155.08 - 2159.52] simplify you heal faster in different
[2158.64 - 2161.68] ways
[2159.52 - 2163.76] in different ways it's not like the
[2161.68 - 2165.44] heavy metal detox movie pulls the metals
[2163.76 - 2168.00] out so you can heal that way
[2165.44 - 2168.96] but this does something else medical
[2168.00 - 2170.96] medium tools
[2168.96 - 2172.40] all the different medical medium tools
[2170.96 - 2174.00] do different things
[2172.40 - 2176.64] i'm just going to repeat this is so
[2174.00 - 2177.04] important spirit of compassion is making
[2176.64 - 2180.96] sure
[2177.04 - 2184.24] i run this by you right now okay
[2180.96 - 2186.16] making sure that you simplify is a way
[2184.24 - 2187.76] to heal certain aspects of the body
[2186.16 - 2190.48] especially digestion
[2187.76 - 2191.76] it's a great way to heal right but
[2190.48 - 2194.40] medical medium tools
[2191.76 - 2195.12] do different things that's important to
[2194.40 - 2196.72] know they do
[2195.12 - 2198.64] different things the mono cleanse does
[2196.72 - 2199.36] different things and when we incorporate
[2198.64 - 2202.00] when we do
[2199.36 - 2203.68] different strategies to healing we can
[2202.00 - 2205.36] knock out all kinds of stuff
[2203.68 - 2208.16] a lot of people that heal with medical
[2205.36 - 2209.92] medium they'll get rid of 30 symptoms
[2208.16 - 2211.84] but yet they're stuck with a few
[2209.92 - 2213.28] symptoms left but they didn't try other
[2211.84 - 2214.72] medical medium tools
[2213.28 - 2216.96] they didn't all of a sudden go and then
[2214.72 - 2218.64] do the mono eating to get rid of those
[2216.96 - 2220.80] other three symptoms because
[2218.64 - 2222.80] different tools in the medical medium
[2220.80 - 2225.52] warehouse
[2222.80 - 2227.28] tool warehouse do different things so
[2225.52 - 2229.52] somebody can make successful
[2227.28 - 2230.88] accomplishment of healing all the way
[2229.52 - 2232.32] and getting what they need to do get
[2230.88 - 2234.56] done
[2232.32 - 2236.24] all right so i got some in a lettuce
[2234.56 - 2238.16] boat right here a little papaya a little
[2236.24 - 2238.40] banana right there it's one way of doing
[2238.16 - 2239.84] it
[2238.40 - 2242.08] here's another way to do it let's get
[2239.84 - 2243.68] going here now i got a food processor
[2242.08 - 2245.52] right here what i'm going to do is scoop
[2243.68 - 2247.20] out papaya brightness food processor and
[2245.52 - 2248.64] i'm going to show you something cool
[2247.20 - 2250.32] this is a great way we're still going to
[2248.64 - 2252.08] do steamed peas i hope you guys stick
[2250.32 - 2252.72] around don't go anywhere because this is
[2252.08 - 2254.48] going to be fun
[2252.72 - 2256.00] seriously i'm going to scoop out the
[2254.48 - 2257.28] inside of this papaya right now
[2256.00 - 2259.28] that's what i'm doing i'm just getting
[2257.28 - 2261.52] rid of the seeds now yes you could eat
[2259.28 - 2263.44] the seeds but i wouldn't during the mono
[2261.52 - 2266.48] cleanse eat the seeds
[2263.44 - 2268.64] i wouldn't okay so i'm gonna drop this
[2266.48 - 2271.84] in here now i'm scooping out this papaya
[2268.64 - 2271.84] right in this food processor
[2273.28 - 2278.72] savannah says i already messed up and
[2275.92 - 2281.84] had coffee with sugar
[2278.72 - 2283.36] and almond milk how do i how do i kick
[2281.84 - 2285.04] this horrible habit
[2283.36 - 2287.28] i'm so addicted listen to the medical
[2285.04 - 2287.68] mean podcast at apple podcast listen to
[2287.28 - 2290.40] the
[2287.68 - 2291.28] coffee matcha tea chocolate episode
[2290.40 - 2293.44] because
[2291.28 - 2295.04] you know it's no it's sad i don't mean
[2293.44 - 2296.32] to change a topic but i want to respect
[2295.04 - 2297.36] what you're talking about you know
[2296.32 - 2300.72] what's sad
[2297.36 - 2303.76] is the caffeine industry has every
[2300.72 - 2305.36] like almost every woman on this planet
[2303.76 - 2306.88] addicted to their drug to the
[2305.36 - 2309.52] psychoactive drug it's an
[2306.88 - 2310.88] evil prank played on women and almost
[2309.52 - 2313.52] every man
[2310.88 - 2314.80] and i talk about this it's horrible the
[2313.52 - 2317.60] caffeine industry just
[2314.80 - 2319.04] robs and steals people's chances to heal
[2317.60 - 2321.84] it just robs their adrenals
[2319.04 - 2324.84] ages them fast and no one's held
[2321.84 - 2327.44] accountable for it this caffeine is so
[2324.84 - 2328.16] bad one reason why the mono cleanse is
[2327.44 - 2330.40] so healing
[2328.16 - 2332.56] it gets us off of these things i love
[2330.40 - 2334.64] the chemtrail podcast i see on tick tock
[2332.56 - 2336.88] so you love the chemtrail podcast
[2334.64 - 2339.12] oh god i love that episode i listen to
[2336.88 - 2341.36] it every so often
[2339.12 - 2342.40] medical mean podcast up about kathy
[2341.36 - 2344.40] joyce says
[2342.40 - 2346.56] what about the recommended supplements
[2344.40 - 2351.36] during mono cleanse
[2346.56 - 2352.40] right well here's the whole thing right
[2351.36 - 2354.00] if you want to keep some of the
[2352.40 - 2356.72] supplements you can just maybe lower
[2354.00 - 2358.48] them down a little bit maybe do half
[2356.72 - 2359.92] but it depends someone might be on the
[2358.48 - 2361.52] worst supplements out there
[2359.92 - 2363.12] you want to read the chapter in the
[2361.52 - 2364.96] supplements chapter of cleanse to feel
[2363.12 - 2367.28] you want to read that for sure
[2364.96 - 2368.88] so i just put papaya in there and i'm
[2367.28 - 2370.32] putting a little bit more that came off
[2368.88 - 2372.00] of this one here too
[2370.32 - 2373.84] okay because you can just take the
[2372.00 - 2374.56] papaya right down to the skin if you
[2373.84 - 2376.88] want if
[2374.56 - 2379.04] your papaya is ripe enough and i'm doing
[2376.88 - 2380.32] that i'm taking it down to the skin
[2379.04 - 2382.64] i don't know if you guys can see this
[2380.32 - 2387.04] but i'm scooping it out
[2382.64 - 2388.56] this is really a great time today

[2401.04 - 2404.16] additives they'll have msg you won't

[2408.24 - 2411.28] lot now
[2409.68 - 2412.72] and they're putting medical medium
[2411.28 - 2414.72] recommended stuff

[2416.16 - 2418.40] medium talking about all these years
[2417.20 - 2419.60] doing all the stuff but yet it's all

[2544.48 - 2548.16] one medical medium tool like your heavy
[2546.56 - 2549.76] metal detox smoothie and you still want
[2548.16 - 2551.52] to mono eat a little bit we'll just join
[2549.76 - 2553.44] them together than if you need to and
[2551.52 - 2554.96] curtail it customize it the way you want
[2553.44 - 2557.92] and that's okay too
[2554.96 - 2559.28] keep that in mind right that it's okay
[2557.92 - 2560.96] if you want to customize the medical
[2559.28 - 2562.24] medium tools and kind of mix them a
[2560.96 - 2564.24] little bit if you really
[2562.24 - 2566.08] you really want your metal heavy metal
[2564.24 - 2568.00] detox smoothie for the next three days
[2566.08 - 2569.36] but you want to do mono eating then do
[2568.00 - 2571.12] you do your smoothie and you do your
[2569.36 - 2572.32] model eating later on and you kind of do
[2571.12 - 2573.84] try to balance it out
[2572.32 - 2575.76] and that's okay if that's what you want
[2573.84 - 2577.68] to do but it's geared for you know
[2575.76 - 2578.88] also doing a certain type of cleansing
[2577.68 - 2580.16] and it's different too on tick-tock
[2578.88 - 2584.16] jimmy's got a question
[2580.16 - 2584.16] i'm not sure what is it uh
[2587.28 - 2591.60] let's see i'm truly grateful for all
[2589.44 - 2595.12] this information
[2591.60 - 2597.92] i was skeptical at first and feel great
[2595.12 - 2599.28] only two weeks wow jimmy i get it if
[2597.92 - 2601.60] you're skeptical at first
[2599.28 - 2604.00] i get it totally get it i think what
[2601.60 - 2605.92] happens is that
[2604.00 - 2608.24] i'm really glad you got past the whole
[2605.92 - 2610.32] thing out there where people do the
[2608.24 - 2611.92] spiritual discrimination against me you
[2610.32 - 2612.64] know because the information work comes
[2611.92 - 2614.96] from but
[2612.64 - 2615.68] the irony is medical medium information
[2614.96 - 2617.36] is like
[2615.68 - 2618.88] science research is stealing it left and
[2617.36 - 2620.24] right right now podcast doctors are
[2618.88 - 2621.52] stealing it left and right trying to
[2620.24 - 2624.24] call it their own
[2621.52 - 2624.88] and science is actually trying to even
[2624.24 - 2626.64] prove
[2624.88 - 2628.00] using medical media information certain
[2626.64 - 2630.00] things about diseases medical medium
[2628.00 - 2631.04] information is the most forefront most
[2630.00 - 2633.60] advanced
[2631.04 - 2635.28] in in anything with chronic illness we
[2633.60 - 2635.68] have to date in the world right now so
[2635.28 - 2637.52] you're
[2635.68 - 2640.80] you you know you might see me joke

[2645.12 - 2648.40] phone
[2646.00 - 2649.28] but these are medical textbooks that are
[2648.40 - 2650.96] around the world
[2649.28 - 2652.40] millions of people are reading them
[2650.96 - 2653.76] countless doctors are reading them
[2652.40 - 2655.28] science research is
[2653.76 - 2657.68] taking information and stealing
[2655.28 - 2659.52] information thefting it from these books
[2657.68 - 2661.20] it's the most advanced medical
[2659.52 - 2662.08] information in the world right now to
[2661.20 - 2664.56] date
[2662.08 - 2665.20] hands down and that's a fact it's a fact

[3182.40 - 3185.36] of some green beans or brussels sprouts
[3184.08 - 3188.16] or asparagus with that
[3185.36 - 3190.00] if you want to choose more of a couple
[3188.16 - 3191.60] of different things if you really want
[3190.00 - 3193.68] variety you can have that for the mono
[3191.60 - 3195.60] eating cleanse
[3193.68 - 3197.28] but you can do banana less papaya and
[3195.60 - 3199.20] lettuce you could do banana papaya and
[3197.28 - 3203.44] lettuce whatever a little bit
[3199.20 - 3204.96] i got some other stuff here okay
[3203.44 - 3206.56] you got the option of drinking cucumber
[3204.96 - 3207.68] juice in the afternoon like i mentioned
[3206.56 - 3210.08] earlier
[3207.68 - 3210.72] keep the salt out keep the seasonings
[3210.08 - 3213.60] out
[3210.72 - 3215.28] keep the salt keep the seasonings out
[3213.60 - 3219.28] very important to know
[3215.28 - 3221.52] all right we've got some peas in the pan
[3219.28 - 3223.20] drink approximately one liter of water
[3221.52 - 3225.12] throughout the entire day
[3223.20 - 3227.84] you can also have some coconut water as
[3225.12 - 3227.84] an option too
[3229.12 - 3233.36] don't do the pink coconut water you just
[3231.68 - 3235.92] got scammed
[3233.36 - 3237.52] pink and red coconut water stay away
[3235.92 - 3239.44] from it it's rancid
[3237.52 - 3241.20] and the trick of the trade was to tell
[3239.44 - 3243.60] you it was better for you and that
[3241.20 - 3245.36] you're lucky if you got a pink coconut
[3243.60 - 3247.04] water no you just got screwed if you got
[3245.36 - 3249.60] a pin coconut water
[3247.04 - 3252.00] essie says i am 100 agree with anthony
[3249.60 - 3254.56] because majority of the doctors are in
[3252.00 - 3255.36] into celery juice now the same doctors
[3254.56 - 3258.96] were the ones
[3255.36 - 3262.64] demonizing him one once upon a time
[3258.96 - 3264.88] the story goes like this medical medium
[3262.64 - 3266.72] comes out with advanced information
[3264.88 - 3268.16] for 35 years in the health field and
[3266.72 - 3270.88] then medical medium
[3268.16 - 3271.84] just gets spit on and totally you know
[3270.88 - 3276.08] messed with
[3271.84 - 3278.40] and you know poo-pooed and demoralized
[3276.08 - 3280.00] demonized right when it's all
[3278.40 - 3281.44] life-saving information
[3280.00 - 3282.96] medical medium information has saved
[3281.44 - 3284.80] more lives around the world of chronic
[3282.96 - 3287.44] illness than anybody
[3284.80 - 3288.96] in history any doctor any diet belief
[3287.44 - 3291.28] system whatever
[3288.96 - 3292.96] and now yeah they're forced to use
[3291.28 - 3294.56] celery juice because they know they've
[3292.96 - 3296.32] got to get results and you know what the
[3294.56 - 3298.08] sad part is
[3296.32 - 3300.16] can we use iceberg lettuce yes you can
[3298.08 - 3301.68] if that's all you got absolutely you can
[3300.16 - 3303.36] you know what the sad part is that was
[3301.68 - 3306.00] on tick tock that question
[3303.36 - 3308.48] is here's what's going to happen they
[3306.00 - 3310.16] bro they let celery juice in the gate
[3308.48 - 3311.92] right but they still don't like medical
[3310.16 - 3313.52] mediums some of these doctors right
[3311.92 - 3315.60] a lot of them do like medical mediums
[3313.52 - 3316.48] some don't right they let celery juice
[3315.60 - 3318.08] in the gate
[3316.48 - 3320.08] check this out you guys and then they
[3318.08 - 3322.96] give those patients all their crappy
[3320.08 - 3324.00] garbage and the patients are actually
[3322.96 - 3325.76] hanging in there
[3324.00 - 3327.20] or getting a little bit of a benefit
[3325.76 - 3328.96] because celery juice is
[3327.20 - 3330.88] cleaning up the mess that the doctor's
[3328.96 - 3332.64] giving them all the other crap and
[3330.88 - 3335.44] garbage that doesn't get them better
[3332.64 - 3336.00] the celery juice is keeping them afloat
[3335.44 - 3339.20] i almost
[3336.00 - 3340.56] just want to be like you know do it
[3339.20 - 3341.04] right if you're going to do it at all
[3340.56 - 3344.16] but
[3341.04 - 3345.60] at least it's helping to some degree
[3344.16 - 3348.96] all right we're doing peas right here
[3345.60 - 3351.52] we're just cooking them up
[3348.96 - 3352.64] see those are those are in the pan let
[3351.52 - 3356.32] me pop
[3352.64 - 3359.92] this on right here okay
[3356.32 - 3361.04] question on tick tock tips on sugar
[3359.92 - 3362.56] cravings

[3362.56 - 3365.44] craving and you're doing the model

[3367.36 - 3370.72] getting enough of the foods that are on
[3369.28 - 3373.76] the motto eating cleanse
[3370.72 - 3375.84] are you doing one tiny potato
[3373.76 - 3377.44] are you doing just one potato and that's
[3375.84 - 3378.00] all you're doing so you're going to be
[3377.44 - 3380.32] on that
[3378.00 - 3381.04] 50 calories for the whole day and that's
[3380.32 - 3382.40] what you're on
[3381.04 - 3384.08] then again you're going to have a sugar
[3382.40 - 3385.36] craving you're going to have all kinds
[3384.08 - 3388.56] of crazy cravings

[3430.40 - 3433.44] killed your craving

[3433.44 - 3436.24] the cravings it can
[3434.64 - 3438.72] mineral salts and i'll tell you why
[3436.24 - 3441.92] there's two things that kill cravings
[3438.72 - 3443.60] okay trace mineral salts which
[3441.92 - 3445.52] is the most abundant source on the plant
[3443.60 - 3447.28] into celery juice
[3445.52 - 3448.56] they go to the brain these trace mineral
[3447.28 - 3450.00] assaults keep that in mind

[3452.72 - 3457.52] okay i got the brain out of my dummy
[3455.68 - 3459.52] right
[3457.52 - 3460.80] two things the brain runs on keep this
[3459.52 - 3463.52] in mind and
[3460.80 - 3465.44] one of them is not protein two things
[3463.52 - 3468.56] the brain runs on
[3465.44 - 3471.12] trace mineral salts
[3468.56 - 3472.40] and what's the other you guys i forgot i
[3471.12 - 3473.12] don't even remember what's the other

[3477.28 - 3481.52] sugar your brain runs on sugar or trace
[3480.32 - 3484.96] mineral salts
[3481.52 - 3486.56] both it runs on both right it doesn't
[3484.96 - 3489.12] run on protein
[3486.56 - 3489.76] but look out for the protein zombies
[3489.12 - 3492.96] right

[3492.96 - 3496.32] protein where's my protein where's my
[3494.48 - 3497.92] protein protein protein protein
[3496.32 - 3499.60] protein can't live without protein

[3528.88 - 3531.84] out of healing if you don't
[3532.56 - 3538.24] mr robot on tick-tock
[3539.44 - 3544.96] thank you very much mr roboto thank you
[3541.20 - 3550.48] very much chris
[3544.96 - 3550.48] all right get these peas done
[3553.28 - 3559.76] anthony can you talk about salts
[3557.68 - 3562.32] so can you talk about salt and celery
[3559.76 - 3564.56] juice i've been doing it for a while
[3562.32 - 3565.92] but my husband i guess we do some
[3564.56 - 3569.68] research and told
[3565.92 - 3573.12] me yesterday that salts can be an issue
[3569.68 - 3576.56] but i trust you road salt's the issue
[3573.12 - 3578.88] so road salt right
[3576.56 - 3580.88] added salt is the issue you want to add
[3578.88 - 3583.20] salt that's the issue
[3580.88 - 3584.72] sodium cluster salts in celery juice are
[3583.20 - 3586.96] a complete electrolyte
[3584.72 - 3589.20] it's not salt and that's where science
[3586.96 - 3590.96] is just totally messed up
[3589.20 - 3592.56] if you believe in science says
[3590.96 - 3594.80] everything science says everything
[3592.56 - 3596.72] science is 100 right about anything then
[3594.80 - 3598.00] then if someone believes that way and i
[3596.72 - 3598.96] know you guys don't but if someone
[3598.00 - 3601.60] believes that way
[3598.96 - 3603.28] they get they get in trouble because
[3601.60 - 3604.96] once you get sick and you're sick
[3603.28 - 3606.96] science is just not there anymore they
[3604.96 - 3608.40] don't catch you you fall backwards you
[3606.96 - 3610.72] think science is gonna catch you
[3608.40 - 3612.00] you fall backwards i'm gonna okay
[3610.72 - 3614.00] science
[3612.00 - 3615.44] science you'll catch me don't worry
[3614.00 - 3616.00] science and research you'll catch me
[3615.44 - 3617.76] right
[3616.00 - 3620.40] because i got neurological lyme right
[3617.76 - 3621.12] now and i i got sick for the first time
[3620.40 - 3623.20] in my life
[3621.12 - 3625.12] science will you catch me i'm gonna fall
[3623.20 - 3625.60] now i know you're gonna catch me right
[3625.12 - 3630.16] ah
[3625.60 - 3632.64] boom that's what science does everybody
[3630.16 - 3633.92] totally just that's what it does to
[3632.64 - 3636.40] everybody just so you know
[3633.92 - 3637.36] you get sick with chronic illness that's
[3636.40 - 3640.72] it

[3924.16 - 3927.60] a little bit more you can blend them
[3925.84 - 3930.00] less
[3927.60 - 3931.52] right i don't want to over blend them
[3930.00 - 3932.56] because you don't have to over blend
[3931.52 - 3934.88] them
[3932.56 - 3934.88] right
[3935.76 - 3939.44] this is becoming a show
[3942.08 - 3944.96] like seriously
[3949.44 - 3956.48] yeah this is out of control you guys
[3953.20 - 3959.68] this is that this train this train has
[3956.48 - 3964.16] left it not only left the station man
[3959.68 - 3968.24] this train has lost its brakes
[3964.16 - 3968.24] going down a mountain right now
[3968.32 - 3971.60] medical medium mountain
[3973.20 - 3979.84] let's get this p hummus out of this food
[3976.84 - 3979.84] processor
[3982.16 - 3986.88] let's get that going right let's move
[3984.80 - 3988.48] this food processor so i can show you
[3986.88 - 3993.84] guys what's up
[3988.48 - 3993.84] what is going on
[3994.56 - 3998.32] now i got this beautiful pea hummus
[3996.80 - 4000.32] right here
[3998.32 - 4004.40] i eat too much sugar anthony from your
[4000.32 - 4007.12] cleanse and my candida is out of control
[4004.40 - 4008.40] emma well you know what happens is that
[4007.12 - 4010.08] it's it's like this okay
[4008.40 - 4014.00] no one taught you about the candida
[4010.08 - 4016.16] thing anyway so that's one thing
[4014.00 - 4017.20] so you mean you ate bananas because
[4016.16 - 4019.60] bananas kill
[4017.20 - 4021.44] anything that's bad in our systems you
[4019.60 - 4024.56] mean you ate papaya
[4021.44 - 4028.08] is that what you mean because what
[4024.56 - 4029.92] feeds candida meaning bad stuff because
[4028.08 - 4031.52] candida is not even the bad thing
[4029.92 - 4034.40] so just a couple of things i got to run
[4031.52 - 4037.44] by anybody who who doesn't understand
[4034.40 - 4039.28] candida anybody that says any kind of
[4037.44 - 4040.72] practitioner doctor says you got candida
[4039.28 - 4043.60] doesn't know anything about
[4040.72 - 4045.76] anything in my opinion because first of
[4043.60 - 4048.24] all candida is the beneficial fungus
[4045.76 - 4051.36] that you're not supposed to kill
[4048.24 - 4053.28] so if you kill candida then the bad
[4051.36 - 4056.32] fungus takes over
[4053.28 - 4059.00] so you we only thrive
[4056.32 - 4060.24] because of candida candida is how
[4059.00 - 4063.28] transference
[4060.24 - 4064.88] of some nutrients get into your body
[4063.28 - 4066.40] because there's the candida is the
[4064.88 - 4069.68] beneficial fungus
[4066.40 - 4072.40] that actually converts and transfers
[4069.68 - 4073.92] nutrients when you kill all your candida
[4072.40 - 4077.12] off
[4073.92 - 4078.48] you can get so sick you can die so when
[4077.12 - 4080.24] all these fancy doctors and
[4078.48 - 4081.92] practitioners and people are like trying
[4080.24 - 4083.28] to kill off your candida what real
[4081.92 - 4084.16] people don't realize is they're trying
[4083.28 - 4086.88] to kill you
[4084.16 - 4088.56] without them knowing because you don't
[4086.88 - 4090.64] want to get rid of your candida you get
[4088.56 - 4092.32] rid of your candida you're on a fast
[4090.64 - 4093.84] track the worst deficiencies on the
[4092.32 - 4095.52] planet and the worst efficiencies
[4093.84 - 4096.72] anybody's ever seen and i've seen that
[4095.52 - 4097.76] i've seen people go through all these
[4096.72 - 4099.52] candida cleanses
[4097.76 - 4101.44] all these candida protocols and
[4099.52 - 4103.20] literally have nothing left
[4101.44 - 4105.20] that gets so many deficiencies
[4103.20 - 4106.00] everything just falls apart now listen
[4105.20 - 4107.68] to your doctor
[4106.00 - 4109.28] if your doctor says you have candida
[4107.68 - 4110.56] listen to your doctor do it your doctor
[4109.28 - 4112.00] tells you if your doctor doesn't want
[4110.56 - 4115.60] you to do
[4112.00 - 4117.92] you know a banana then don't do it right
[4115.60 - 4119.12] and the other you know so that's
[4117.92 - 4121.76] important to know
[4119.12 - 4123.12] the other thing is or you know make sure
[4121.76 - 4124.56] you're not on your coffee make sure
[4123.12 - 4126.24] you're not on your caffeine make sure
[4124.56 - 4126.80] you're not doing almond milk during this
[4126.24 - 4128.40] okay
[4126.80 - 4130.56] make sure you're not doing nutritional
[4128.40 - 4133.52] yeast make sure you're not doing acv
[4130.56 - 4135.68] you know like so did you even do the
[4133.52 - 4136.40] mono-eating cleanse did you put avocado
[4135.68 - 4138.80] in there oil
[4136.40 - 4140.24] avocados what did you put in there did
[4138.80 - 4141.44] you are you eating animal protein at the
[4140.24 - 4142.96] end of the day
[4141.44 - 4144.72] so what happens is what people don't
[4142.96 - 4146.00] realize is they'll be like okay i'm
[4144.72 - 4148.48] going to do the mono-eating cleanse
[4146.00 - 4149.44] and i'm going to have a banana now it's
[4148.48 - 4151.76] like whoa
[4149.44 - 4152.96] you still want all this other stuff i
[4151.76 - 4153.84] want you to be your own detective i'm
[4152.96 - 4156.16] not saying you
[4153.84 - 4157.84] are but i'm saying that's possible what
[4156.16 - 4159.84] supplements are you on are you taking a
[4157.84 - 4161.52] bunch of gut cleansers did you actually
[4159.84 - 4163.60] read the book so you're not doing all
[4161.52 - 4165.76] these kind of crazy supplements that
[4163.60 - 4167.20] everybody's got you on and then you're
[4165.76 - 4168.72] still trying to do the mono eating
[4167.20 - 4170.32] cleanse while you're doing all this
[4168.72 - 4172.00] other garbage and junk
[4170.32 - 4174.16] keep that in mind it's critical right
[4172.00 - 4175.52] there okay all these things matter
[4174.16 - 4177.84] that's the details
[4175.52 - 4179.60] did you get a new medical treatment too
[4177.84 - 4181.68] keep in mind was there a new medical
[4179.60 - 4184.80] treatment and now the medical medium
[4181.68 - 4186.72] banana you ate is causing all your
[4184.80 - 4188.24] problems when really that banana is not
[4186.72 - 4189.76] causing all the problems it's a new
[4188.24 - 4190.16] medical treatment that you got a month
[4189.76 - 4192.24] ago
[4190.16 - 4194.00] like keeping i'm just i want people to
[4192.24 - 4195.84] be their own detectives right here
[4194.00 - 4198.24] i'm glad these questions come up it's
[4195.84 - 4201.28] all important cold white spring
[4198.24 - 4204.32] the sheep is leaving the show
[4201.28 - 4207.04] and so you know the thing is is that
[4204.32 - 4207.68] this is all important right another
[4207.04 - 4209.60] thing is
[4207.68 - 4211.28] if you've never got rid of the garbage
[4209.60 - 4214.48] or the junk and you really
[4211.28 - 4215.36] go fat free and you start doing the mono
[4214.48 - 4217.28] cleanse
[4215.36 - 4219.28] and you're getting rid of those fats and
[4217.28 - 4221.04] you stopped your coffee and you stopped
[4219.28 - 4224.08] your chocolate and you stopped your
[4221.04 - 4225.52] your the junk you're on right then
[4224.08 - 4227.20] you're gonna just start getting rid of
[4225.52 - 4229.68] stuff and you stopped your vinegar
[4227.20 - 4232.16] you're gonna start getting rid of stuff
[4229.68 - 4232.80] right and then another thing too is like
[4232.16 - 4236.08] i said
[4232.80 - 4238.16] i watched women die over the years
[4236.08 - 4240.08] because they were candida cleansed to
[4238.16 - 4242.24] death because what happened was
[4240.08 - 4244.00] they went all through the 80s and 1990s
[4242.24 - 4246.16] when the candida scare happened
[4244.00 - 4248.24] and they were literally killed off these
[4246.16 - 4250.72] women were killed off
[4248.24 - 4252.64] because they ran cleansers through their
[4250.72 - 4254.72] intestinal tract to kill off candida and
[4252.64 - 4256.40] they removed all their beneficial fungus
[4254.72 - 4258.80] and then these women died
[4256.40 - 4260.88] thousands of women died in the 1980s and
[4258.80 - 4262.32] 1990s and early 2000s from candida
[4260.88 - 4264.08] cleansing
[4262.32 - 4265.84] thousands of women died they lost their
[4264.08 - 4268.88] lives their bodies fell apart
[4265.84 - 4270.08] everything just fell apart because of a
[4268.88 - 4271.76] thrush you know because
[4270.08 - 4273.52] they were told they had candida thrush
[4271.76 - 4275.12] and they were put on protocols
[4273.52 - 4276.72] they were put on all kinds of thrush
[4275.12 - 4277.76] protocols and these protocols and that
[4276.72 - 4280.24] protocols and
[4277.76 - 4281.68] it was to try to clear out the candida
[4280.24 - 4283.44] and what happened was
[4281.68 - 4285.36] they lost all their candida all right
[4283.44 - 4287.76] and they died and they died
[4285.36 - 4288.72] the ones that lived the the cleanses
[4287.76 - 4290.24] didn't do
[4288.72 - 4291.84] didn't clear out and kill all of their
[4290.24 - 4292.88] candida thank god because that's how
[4291.84 - 4296.72] they lived through
[4292.88 - 4298.16] it okay so yeah there you go
[4296.72 - 4300.40] uh someone's dealing with rush or
[4298.16 - 4302.08] anything like that so it's important to
[4300.40 - 4304.08] know when people have thrush they got h
[4302.08 - 4305.36] pylori they got streptococcus they got e
[4304.08 - 4307.44] coli in their gut
[4305.36 - 4309.12] they got they got those kinds of things
[4307.44 - 4311.04] happening in their gut right
[4309.12 - 4312.96] they have all of that they got herpes
[4311.04 - 4314.16] simplex one you know cold sore virus
[4312.96 - 4316.56] they got all these different
[4314.16 - 4318.24] bugs in them that are thriving when they
[4316.56 - 4319.84] shouldn't be thriving and it takes time
[4318.24 - 4321.20] to clear all that stuff out and learn
[4319.84 - 4325.04] how to heal
[4321.20 - 4327.20] um but anyway
[4325.04 - 4328.96] you guys let me let me just show you

[4363.92 - 4366.64] and didn't know it even exist whatever
[4365.52 - 4370.00] it was
[4366.64 - 4372.72] the naturopath had me on a no sugar
[4370.00 - 4373.92] diet to remove candida and it got worse
[4372.72 - 4376.40] course it did
[4373.92 - 4378.00] i'm telling you right now you know uh
[4376.40 - 4380.56] jimmy i'm telling you right now
[4378.00 - 4381.60] i've seen women die from that candida
[4381.60 - 4384.80] about you know trying to knock the
[4383.12 - 4386.72] candida out and i've seen
[4384.80 - 4388.32] thousands of women that died in the 80s
[4386.72 - 4390.40] and 90s and early 2000s from that
[4388.32 - 4392.16] candida crap
[4390.40 - 4393.84] it's so sad i don't even know what to
[4392.16 - 4397.28] say let's see
[4393.84 - 4400.80] emma i tried i tried 369 which helped
[4397.28 - 4404.16] but still suffering still stuff
[4400.80 - 4406.16] still suffering from thrush what happens
[4404.16 - 4408.56] is this okay
[4406.16 - 4409.68] if someone's got thrush take the book to
[4408.56 - 4411.12] your doctor
[4409.68 - 4413.76] find the doctor take the book to your
[4411.12 - 4415.04] doctor right take a look at the sibo
[4413.76 - 4417.04] protocol okay
[4415.04 - 4418.72] that's what i would do take a look at
[4417.04 - 4421.04] the sibo protocol
[4418.72 - 4422.72] so if i was somebody and i had thrush
[4421.04 - 4425.60] which is streptococcus
[4422.72 - 4427.36] right with streptococcus and you know
[4425.60 - 4429.28] what happens is the 369
[4427.36 - 4431.52] is getting you better but how many times
[4429.28 - 4432.40] did you do the 369 you could do 369
[4431.52 - 4434.40] advanced
[4432.40 - 4436.40] like if it was me i would do 369
[4434.40 - 4438.48] advanced over and over again
[4436.40 - 4440.24] that's one thing i would do i would also
[4438.48 - 4442.00] take a look at the strep protocol
[4440.24 - 4443.36] ask your doctor what's right for you and
[4442.00 - 4444.96] what your doctor says
[4443.36 - 4446.40] that's who you listen to do not listen
[4444.96 - 4448.32] to me i'm just telling you that
[4446.40 - 4450.16] what i would do for myself or my loved
[4448.32 - 4451.76] ones and my family okay
[4450.16 - 4453.44] that's what i would do i'd make sure all
[4451.76 - 4454.00] my supplements didn't have the alcohol
[4453.44 - 4455.28] in them didn't
[4454.00 - 4456.56] have all the garbage in them i'd make
[4455.28 - 4457.92] sure they were recommended medical
[4456.56 - 4460.96] medium supplements
[4457.92 - 4462.96] i would also i would also make sure that
[4460.96 - 4464.96] um i was doing the strep protocol or
[4462.96 - 4467.12] flip it to the sibo protocol
[4464.96 - 4469.04] i'd be doing the advanced cleanse 369
[4467.12 - 4470.64] i'd be doing the mono eating cleanse
[4469.04 - 4472.72] probably the potato monowing cleanses
[4470.64 - 4474.24] what i would be doing this is what i
[4472.72 - 4476.08] you know i would do ask your doctor

[4476.08 - 4478.96] ask your doctor i'm just telling you
[4477.36 - 4480.40] what i would do for myself and you can
[4478.96 - 4482.08] go as far as you need to go
[4480.40 - 4484.08] i would go as far as i need to go until
[4482.08 - 4487.04] i was better and got past that
[4484.08 - 4488.16] a lot of people get past that anyway i
