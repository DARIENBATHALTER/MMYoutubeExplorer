00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:55,560
tell you how many people have uh come to

100
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,879
me over the years and especially when I

101
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,959
had the office in the old days how many

102
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:03,920
people came to my office with this situ

103
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:07,640
situation and um you think it's not a

104
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,120
big deal you know as if a man hears

105
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,200
about it it's not a big deal it's like

106
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,879
okay what is that well meanwhile it

107
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,479
could be a big deal it could get pretty

108
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:18,160
serious I've had a lot of women that

109
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:23,120
that have come to my office that I mean

110
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:25,560
they've had size of of of um I mean just

111
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:29,680
size of eggs fibroids the size of eggs

112
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:32,160
bigger than eggs I mean so big like even

113
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,080
grapefruit size they can get really big

114
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,680
really disruptive really problematic

115
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,440
really difficult to deal with um

116
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:42,960
bleeding can occur just lots and lots of

117
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:47,199
bleeding lots of difficulties and it's

118
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:50,000
not an easy thing at all to deal with um

119
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,400
and and sometimes surgery is you know

120
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,800
optional sometimes it's not even

121
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,160
optional with this it's unbelievable

122
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,360
with women have gone through I've seen

123
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:01,199
it all and it's uterine fibroids both on

124
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:03,560
top of the uterus ins inside the uterus

125
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,680
and um it's it's been it's given women a

126
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:08,639
lot of difficult decisions to make um

127
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,320
and it's been just cumbersome and in the

128
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,039
way in so many in so many ways so I I

129
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,880
just think this is an

130
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:18,440
important aspect of chronic

131
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:20,800
illness that you know that needs

132
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,400
attention on the medical Medium show

133
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,039
bottom line it needs attention and

134
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,960
attention that hasn't been contaminated

135
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,080
with you know private panel of

136
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,680
influencers that just want you to think

137
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,080
fibroid is a certain thing or a certain

138
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:35,160
way or whatever because that's where the

139
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,720
money went and um because the agenda

140
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,039
goes you know with money and that's how

141
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,000
it works both now in uh alternative

142
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,000
medicine so misinformation is out there

143
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,840
everywhere on the internet everywhere

144
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,280
everywhere you look about fibroids and

145
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,960
if you even look into it you someone was

146
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,039
telling me also recently and they said

147
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,919
you know it's so strange you know how

148
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:57,479
fibroids work I go yeah no I do they say

149
00:05:53,919 --> 00:06:00,440
well how come how come if you go looking

150
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:02,880
into it what's the cause of Fire

151
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:05,280
fibroids the answer isn't there there is

152
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,360
no answer there is no answer a little

153
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,599
bit of theory maybe some

154
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,240
speculation I I I said well what do you

155
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:14,160
mean it's like that with all chronic

156
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,360
illness it's like yeah you're right yeah

157
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,919
no of course I'm right it's like that

158
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,360
with all chronic illness what what you

159
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:22,039
kidding and even if there is a known

160
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,720
cause to a chronic illness chances are

161
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:28,639
it's totally wrong or planted that way

162
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:32,080
Plant it wrong it's planted that way

163
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:34,520
chronic illness is a weird weird thing

164
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:37,160
for the industry they hate it it's like

165
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:41,840
dirty laundry for the industries it's

166
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:43,080
dirty laundry because it it truly shows

167
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,720
it

168
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,720
truly

169
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,080
uncovers that the that the medical

170
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,720
industry absolutely doesn't have their

171
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,280
finger on the pulse of the people

172
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,639
doesn't have their finger on the pulse

173
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:58,120
of chronic illness on any level it just

174
00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:00,240
exposes tremendous amounts of medical

175
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,400
denial and because of this it all gets

176
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,840
funneled into the gene thing even the

177
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,319
fibroid and the reason why I'm saying is

178
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:09,039
is even the fibroid the whole thing with

179
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,960
fibroids is oh it's hereditary oh it's

180
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,360
it's genes no it's

181
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:17,280
not it's not

182
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:21,120
hereditary it's not Gene related once

183
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:23,000
again insult insult insult women insult

184
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,360
people insult people's intelligence

185
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,919
insult people's beings and who they are

186
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:31,639
just insult away just insult every

187
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:34,080
second is what the industry does by

188
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:37,080
doing that that's what they do when they

189
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,919
do that it's horrendous no there's a

190
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,240
real cause and you can have it your

191
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:41,319
daughter can have it her daughter can

192
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,759
have it their daughter can have it

193
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:44,080
somebody else's daughter can have it

194
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:45,919
somebody else's daughter can have it

195
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,319
somebody else's mom can have it somebody

196
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,680
it just goes right down the line because

197
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:53,599
there's a real

198
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:55,159
reason why everybody's got it going on

199
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,759

have towards doctors serious

285
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:17,240
stuff but it's the industry the industry

286
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,519
doesn't help the doctors the industry is

287
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,279
not helping the doctors with Lyme

288
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:23,200
disease at all they give them some bogus

289
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,480
information from new fangled Labs that

290
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,839
just got it all down think they got it

291
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,440
all down doctor has no idea what's going

292
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,160
on at the lab ever just gets the

293
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,800
information says borderline you got

294
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:36,079
borderline lime borderline wait a minute

295
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:41,160
how can it be borderline it's either no

296
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:42,839
or yay yay or nay when it comes down to

297
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,880
if it's nay you still can have a

298
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:47,440
pathogen if they can't find a pathogen

299
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,120
you can still have one yes if they find

300
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,480
a pathogen they found a pathogen you

301
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,920
have a pathogen you could have a lot of

302
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,480
different pathogens the point is you

303
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,360
can't have

304
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:58,200
borderline what a stupid mistake those

305
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,320
labs made by doing that cuz you're not

306
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,079
going to see that anymore any more

307
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:04,160
that's a mistake by the way that's a

308
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,079
mistake and you're not going to see that

309
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,320
anymore because they don't want the gig

310
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:10,399
to be up at the lime Labs you need to

311
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,680
know that when it's the borderline thing

312
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,519
that was a bad decision on their part

313
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,720
you're going to see that disappear soon

314
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:17,160
and it's never going to be borderline

315
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,920
it's just going to be more and more yays

316
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,320
yays yay yay more and more you have lime

317
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,920
more and more you have lime out there

318
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,399
and less borderline because the

319
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,800
borderline shows something's wrong

320
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,720
something's mischievously St stupidly

321
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,880
wrong over there because

322
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,360
you can't have borderline pathogen you

323
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:36,120
either detect it you can't detect a

324
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,800
little bit of the pathogen it means it's

325
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:41,160
a yes if any bit of a pathogen's

326
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,199
detected you can't have borderline and

327
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,519
this is where it's said this what I'm

328
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:47,040
saying the industry is screwing with the

329
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:49,160
doctors in every way in every shape form

330
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,600
and possible so doctors have don't have

331
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:54,680
the right information don't know what's

332
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:57,399
going on this is how it's done this is

333
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:59,160
how it's done and the amount and and

334
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:01,160
it's unbelievable when money's starts to

335
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:03,440
file into this whole thing in all the

336
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:05,199
different aspects of chronic illness it

337
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,839
it becomes negligent and it leaves the

338
00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:09,839
person in the dark and it gets all

339
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:11,480
thrown into jeans in the end yeah

340
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,240
insulting people cuz people do have the

341
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,959
same hair color as their mother they do

342
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,880
have the same hair their noses are the

343
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,680
same they do have the same lips they do

344
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,199
have some same features around the chin

345
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:23,040
bone structures so it's such an easy

346
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:26,519
cell it's

347
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,800
sick it really is so let's get down to

348
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:29,639
Let's Get Down to the truth about

349
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:32,720
fibroids I have to talk about this a

350
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:35,480
little bit because if I don't then then

351
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:38,000
you'll never know because if you never

352
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,600
know then you might you might just go

353
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,880
somewhere and say oh I'll listen to this

354
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:45,079
other medical show from this other

355
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:48,320
practitioner and then you know and and

356
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:50,040
just not realize what's even going on

357
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,639
you got to know that's the whole point

358
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,839
of the show spirit said look we got to

359
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:55,680

365
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:11,440
do to get people the

366
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:14,880
truth okay all right what's the cause of

367
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:18,000
fibroids what is the cause what well the

368
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,560
industry says oh done clear maybe it's

369
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,720
estrogen

370
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:24,839
maybe maybe maybe it's

371
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,680
progesterone

372
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:31,680
maybe maybe it's too much red

373
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:34,759
meat that's also a concept in the

374
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,120
industry too much red meat maybe it's

375
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:38,399
too much

376
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,240
alcohol you know

377
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:44,240
maybe

378
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:47,079
maybe red meats a trigger for something

379
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,920
else because yeah a lot of red meat will

380
00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:52,279
probably guarantee some

381
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:54,519
fibroids a lot of eggs will guaranteed

382
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:57,279
fibroids for

383
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:58,880
sure but why and the industry doesn't

384
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,399
know that though they here's what it's

385
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,920
really funny they'll put believe it or

386
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:06,920
not the industry will

387
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,839
actually give an uppercut or a low jab

388
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:11,800
to red meat I mean they'll just punch

389
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:13,800
the Sucker Punch red meat right in the

390
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,320
stomach and they'll just say you know

391
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:18,199
let's throw this one in and let's throw

392
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:20,079
alcohol in you know we notice that women

393
00:15:18,199 --> 00:15:21,519
that eat a lot of red meat they tend to

394
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,360
have a little bit more fibroids which

395
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,399
we're kind of noticing let's really

396
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:29,480
let's Sucker Punch that one but they

397
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:32,040
will never sucker punch

398
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:35,680
eggs they'll never sucker punch those

399
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:37,240
darn eggs really interesting how it

400
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:42,120
works

401
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:44,800
eggs are the ultimate ultimate

402
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:46,959
proliferating food for fibrates you want

403
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,800
fibroids you eat eggs you don't want

404
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:53,639
fibroids to go away you eat you eat

405
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:55,000
eggs the ultimate ultimate fibid Creator

406
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:57,279
it's the ultimate

407
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,319
trigger the ultimate trigger could

408
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:01,240
estrogen too much estrogen progesterone

409
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:03,040
possibly create a

410
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:06,480
fibroid

411
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:08,000
yeah it could possibly feed a fibroid

412
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,240
but why what's the cause it's not

413
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,079
estrogen there's people out there that

414
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,000
have so much estrogen they have tons of

415
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:18,800
estrogen they eat a lot of red meat they

416
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:21,079
drink a lot of alcohol they do things

417
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,920
that would prompt fibroids but they

418
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:24,600
never get the fibroids because you have

419
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:27,360
to have something else in the body to

420
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:31,120
feed to throw it estrogen to throw it

421
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,360
progesterone to throw it red meat to

422
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,800
throw

423
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:38,800
it stuff right you have to have

424
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,519
something these are just triggers why do

425
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:44,319
you think you know it's the same thing

426
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:47,639
with like the old guy that smoked for 60

427
00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:50,959
years he smoked for 60 years

428
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:53,440
cigars you know stoies

429
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:56,880
whatever those cancerous stoies you

430
00:16:53,440 --> 00:17:00,480
smoked him for 60 years he's 84 years

431
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:02,560
old he eats a donut in the morning I I

something in the morning I don't even

439
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:23,559
know how you say croissant if someone

440
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:27,400
said in a real French way recently I'm

441
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:29,799
like wow that's pretty cool I'm not

442
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,679
French and you know and the thing is is

443
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:33,640
that and I like the way it sounded it

444
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,360
made me want to go and get one made me

445
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:37,679
want to go and get one and then I've

446
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,679
heard somebody say cant they said

447
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,000

you eat today and they said I had a

449
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,400
croissant I said what I said you know a

450
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,000
croissant and it took me a while to

451
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,320
figure it

452
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,320
out people say it all kinds of different

453
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:56,159
ways I love it I love it and you know um

454
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,520
I've seen guys they eat that they'll eat

455
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:59,159
that they'll eat anything they have that

456
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,360
for breakfast they have a box of donuts

457
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:04,840
for breakfast they're smoking like

458
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:07,240
chimney you know the scotch we'll have a

459
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:10,400
scotch whiskey later on that

460
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:13,360
night and uh you know their lungs are

461
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:16,159
filled with 60 years of smoke 70 years

462
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,559
of smoke 70 years and they don't have

463
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:19,120
lung cancer it's like why the hell do

464
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:21,679
they don't have lung cancer I don't get

465
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,480
because they needed something to feed to

466
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:27,080
create the lung cancer they needed

467
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:29,080
something inside of them to feed the

468
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,360
lung cancer

469
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:34,280
I and I've seen that with some women

470
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:38,080
it's really rare and it's rare getting

471
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:40,640
rare every day it's not like oh my God

472
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:44,039
you know I found when I found Elder

473
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:46,120
people in the old days I say you know

474
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:48,840
when I'd go to like a a nursing home or

475
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:50,200
something like that or or if I'd go

476
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:53,240
somewhere you know there was just less

477
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,960
older people in nursing homes things

478
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:57,000
like that you know when I was younger I

479
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,919
used to visit all those all the time you

480
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,960
know I had clients and people be like

481
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:03,600
look you have to come to the nursing

482
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,280
home you have to see you know because

483
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,799
nursing homes they won't they won't do

484
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:10,880
anything for the people there meaning

485
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,400
they won't take like natural B12 and

486
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,679
give it to them they they they never do

487
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,360
it the the the the the siblings have to

488
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,760
really be involved like you have to be

489
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,760
really be involved I remember so many

490
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:22,080
times so many cases where they'd be like

491
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,880
Anthony you got to come out here and you

492
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,360
got to take a look at my my

493
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,880
great-grandfather you have to my

494
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,880
grandmother my great-grandfather you

495
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,360
have to take a look I'd go out to a

496
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,559
nursing home and I was like how come

497
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:34,360
there's not that many old people here

498
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,640
and the old people here that are here

499
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:39,200
they're really really old and

500
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:41,960
then that one decade goes by and they

501
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:44,600
like whoa why are there a lot more

502
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:46,679
younger people in here whoa another

503
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:50,200
decade goes by oh my God that person's

504
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:53,400
45 years old and dying in the corner oh

505
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:56,360
dear lord what that person's

506
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:59,240
38 and you go in there now into these

507
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:01,640
places and it's unbelievable

508
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:04,159
I mean you find them in their 20s

509
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:06,679
wasting away with mystery disease and

510
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:10,240
dying either in one of those places or

511
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:13,600
at home or or whatever it's unbelievable

512
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:15,360
and then and then it's crazy there's

513
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,080
less old people there's less older

514
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,080
people there's less older generation in

515
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:21,760
these

516
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:23,200
places they're all younger now you're

517
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,919
going to tell me that's genes too that

518
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,480
all happened in the last 30 years genes

519
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:28,960
completely changed in the last 30 years

520
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,960
and and all these young people are sick

521
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,840
so so genes that have been going on for

522
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,720
thousands of years since humankind going

523
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:37,200
on for thousands of years since

524
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,400
humankind thousands of years all of a

525
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,799
sudden in the last 20 30 years genes

526
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:45,280
changed completely just completely

527
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:49,640
changed and then chronic illness

528
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:51,600
exploded like no other no other yeah you

529
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:53,720
watch TV everybody looks healthy on the

530
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,720
TV besides there's a zillion cancer

531
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:59,039
commercials now but if you you know but

532
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,559
you look at TV you see all the actors

533
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,640
they look healthy of course Spirit tells

534
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:05,159
me they're not and many then I still see

535
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,480
things in and out of it all if I watch

536
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:09,480
TV but if you look at you look if you

537
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,919
look on television because if I go over

538
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,799
a family member's house and they got the

539
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:15,200
television on and I I have to stand

540
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:17,159
there I have to watch it and I'm like

541
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,559
God it it everybody paints a picture

like the whole world is healthy you

543
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:22,559
wouldn't believe chronic illness has

544
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,240
exploded hundreds of millions of people

545
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:27,039
just in the us alone 200 million plus

546
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,400
Americans got

547
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:31,400
problems but it's not genes it couldn't

548
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:34,480
happen in it couldn't happened in 20

549
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:38,039
years that's the insult

550
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,799
insulting so things have changed and

551
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:42,400
everything and fibbr are now they're on

552
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:45,640
the rise like never before and remember

553
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:49,400
earlier on it wasn't like that but

554
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:53,520
they're on the rise the whole fibroid

555
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:56,000
thing so there's triggers for fibroids

556
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,520
and that's what the industry kind of

557
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,080
doesn't want to really say they just

558
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,360
don't even know the C they try to make

559
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,919
it cause the trigger as cause that's a

560
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,039
mistake you know in the Hashimoto

561
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:07,360
thyroid

562
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:09,120
book I don't do trigger as cause I know

563
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,720
the cause I put the cause in the thyroid

564
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:14,039
healing book I do the triggers

565
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:17,520
separately you go into somebody else's

566
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:19,360
thyroid stuff and you check into it they

567
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,640
have the trigger as

568
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:25,039
cause completely backwards like

569
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,640
Antiquity it's unbelievable here we are

570
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:29,799
what year is it and they still don't

571
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:32,440
know come on come on it's

572
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:34,640
unbelievable so that red meat the

573
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:36,919
alcohol gets thrown in gets thrown in as

574
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,799
hey this is this is what's creating the

575
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:40,279
fibroids throw estrogen in it too that's

576
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:44,480
what's creating the

577
00:22:40,279 --> 00:22:47,240
fibroids it's not fibroids are a virus

578
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:50,520
it's a small virus virus I talk about

579
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:54,000
day in day out fibroid virus is Epstein

580
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:55,600
bar it's in everybody and if you feed it

581
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,159
just right it's going to come out and

582
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,960
it's going to create some stuff and and

583
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:03,360
it creates a fbid a growth a

584
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,520
growth can create a lot of growths and

585
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,760
it could create some and just you know

586
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:11,440
and and what does it love to feed on it

587
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:13,440
loves to feed on certain things lots of

588
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,799
things dairy products why isn't dairy

589
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,400

up bar the variety that causes fibroids

609
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:04,440
the variety that goes to the

610
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:07,279
reproductive system that causes

611
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:09,919
fibroids and yogurt feeds

it you know but it feeds but here's what

617
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:25,840
the industry does it

618
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,880
protects certain items and it makes sure

619
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,760
that women eat more of those items oh

620
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:31,760

624
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:40,120
industry tricks you and it's like no no

pieces it's protein it's perfect for a

631
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:58,240
woman on the go it's absurd and they do

632
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:59,960
this purposely so that you never learn

633
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,440
so you get a fibroid and they do it so

634
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,880
that your daughter gets a fibroid they

635
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,120
do it so that your daughter's daughter

636
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:08,039
gets a fibroid also keeps the industry

637
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:11,159
happy keeps the industry fat and happy

638
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:13,760
boy that's why that's there that's why

639
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:16,200
that's there they protect those cheese

640
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:18,960
squares they they Sucker Punch red meat

641
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:20,919
cuz red meat doesn't really cause

642
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,120
fibroids to to to a degree it's just

643
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:24,559
that red meat red meat eaters usually

644
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,919
also like cheese and crackers they also

645
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:27,399
a lot of like cheese they like a lot of

646
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,360
eggs they you know that kind of stuff

647
00:25:27,399 --> 00:25:32,960
they won't pick on those for a

648
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:35,720
reason remember agenda I said it in the

649
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,360
beginning you know also somebody of the

650
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,679
other day said you know you got this new

651
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,120
beginning I don't like it in your show I

652
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,600
hate it there's a new beginning in your

653
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,880
show and I've known you for a while

654
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,240
Anthony and there's this new beginning

655
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,360
you talk about all these groups blah

656
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,520
blah blah and the

657
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:50,240
information I go too bad if you don't

658
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:53,080
like it it has to be there I have no

659
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:56,480
choice because spirit I had a talk with

660
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:58,159
spirit and spirit tells me that people

661
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,720
just think you can get this information

662
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,880
anywhere else all the people the new

663
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:03,440
people that come to the show and and and

664
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:05,000
they don't know the other information

665
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,480
how it's contaminated and spirit doesn't

666
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,840
like being affiliate affiliated with

667
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,679
contaminated information that's on the

668
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,679
internet and both Natural Health and

669
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:15,320
conventional health and I I have to I

670
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:17,480
have to honor that so it is what it is

671
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:19,880
but those agenda groups they protect

672
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:23,080
those little cheese squares they're

673
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:26,600
protected so you get fibroids

674
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:28,480
more so you get more fibroids and you're

675
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,080
thinking well who's protecting it my

676
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,360
doctor isn't no your doctor isn't your

677
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:36,760
doctor's good it's all good but there's

678
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:38,440
private panel of influencers private

679
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:41,200
panel of think

680
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:43,679
tankers that you couldn't believe

681
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:46,120

and uh there's some great people out

726
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:42,399
there both women and men in the world

727
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:44,919
and salt of the earth and you can't you

728
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:48,840
can't touch that the salt of the earth

729
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:50,600
so here's the deal here's the deal we

730
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:53,000
got to watch out with the foods because

731
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:55,080
the foods play a massive

732
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,919
role because they're the trigger to an

733
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:58,320
Epstein bar virus that kind of goes into

734
00:28:56,919 --> 00:29:00,159
the reprodu productive system that kind

735
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,720
of gets into that reproductive system

736
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:05,519
and causes some

737
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,840
trouble and we have to be really mindful

738
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:09,720
about that we have to be on that it's

739
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,159
important first of all we got to do

740
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,600
things and knock down the Epstein bar

741
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:14,960
virus that got into the reproductive

742
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:17,039
system and that EP bar virus causes

743
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,559
pregnancy complications all the time for

744
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:21,120
women all the time this isn't just

745
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:23,840
pelvic inflammatory disease which is

746
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:25,799
strepa cacus Strep cacus which is you

747
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,480
know antibiotic resistant strep cacus

748
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:28,559
that gets into the reproductive system

749
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,960
and causes a lot of different

750
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,600
inflammation in different areas and

751
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:33,600
that's

752
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:36,240
PID yeah because there's so many

753
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:38,320
different varieties of strep and you can

754
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:41,799
pick up strep anyhow it's just it's easy

755
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:43,679
to pick up but but the deal is and

756
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:46,679
people have it they have strep in them

757
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:49,440
but the Epstein bar is the that's makes

758
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:51,159
that that growth which kind of like a

759
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:55,159
smooth piece of

760
00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:57,000
muscle Mak can get big real big so what

761
00:29:55,159 --> 00:29:57,960
we got to do is we got to knock those

762
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,840
down

763
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,480
we got to you know there's there was I

764
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:05,480
remember this one case I think it was in

765
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:07,919
2000 so it was uh what 17 years ago and

766
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:10,720
um she wanted to do things natural she

767
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:14,159
was suffering a lot of bleeding um the

768
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:17,200
doctors said that that it was it was

769
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:19,919
bigger than a small great fruit the

770
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:22,279
fibroid the uterine fibroid and it was

771
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,720
causing tremendous amount of pain and

772
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:25,960
they just said look hysterctomy

773
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:29,039
hysterectomy and I understand I

774
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:30,399
understand you know I understand when um

775
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:32,000
when doctors they feel they have no

776
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:33,880
choice and you know and there's certain

777
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,720
situations and circumstances where you

778
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:37,880
have to do hysterctomy I I you know what

779
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:39,279
women have had gone through and there's

780
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,679
reasons for that and there's a lot of

781
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:43,600
things that happen and

782
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:46,200
occur and you know we we try to avoid if

783
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,360
we can naturally in any way possible or

784
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:51,000
even conventionally in any way possible

785
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:52,880
absolutely but in in some cases you you

786
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:57,399
just can't avoid it and it's it it can

787
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:59,000
happen totally totally and and uh so so

788
00:30:57,399 --> 00:31:01,320
this this woman she had a serious she

789
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,360
had a serious fibroid it was just it was

790
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:05,200
agonizing and she said well what can we

791
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,760
do about it I'm desperate I'm desperate

792
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,399
I said well we can do something about it

793
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:11,120
let's change your diet let's overhaul it

794
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:12,399
let's overhaul it to such a degree we're

795

00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:29,240
varieties I go and some are more docile

907
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,480
some just are just fibroid causers some

908
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,960
don't really do much they give you a

909
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,760
little mono sometimes you get a mono you

910
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:35,400
don't even know you had Mono and then

911
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,760
later on you get fibroids down the road

912
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,240
and so forth and if you're eating and

913
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:40,720
drinking or doing things that are bad

914
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:42,839
like you're triggering it or you're

915
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:44,280
under severe emotional stress and she

916
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:45,320
was under a tremendous amount of

917
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:47,760
emotional

918
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:49,800
stress and now I think about it's 9 17

919
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,240
years ago I think this is 19 years ago

920
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:54,440
19 years

921
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:55,800
ago that's what this is it's about 19

922
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:59,040
years

923
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:00,880
ago the time's flying so fast I'm just

924
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:05,480
I'm baffled by the way time flies

925
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:06,920
actually so it's close to 19 years I

926
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:09,800
think it was

927
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:13,319
98 99 I think it's

928
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:15,319
98 and you know they were so confused so

929
00:36:13,319 --> 00:36:16,839
confused and I was explaining the whole

930
00:36:15,319 --> 00:36:19,119
thing about Epstein bar how it works

931
00:36:16,839 --> 00:36:21,440
what it's doing how it feeds how it eats

932
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:23,200
How It Grow the muscle the smooth muscle

933
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,720
the growth how it works underneath where

934
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:29,000
the virus is located all of

935
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:30,880
this and now you better not eat eggs and

936
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,839
she was being she was eating a lot of

937
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,160
eggs she was eating two eggs a day to

938
00:36:32,839 --> 00:36:36,119
get her protein she was putting them

939
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,480
hardboiled on her salad and then she was

940
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:38,760
just having them in the morning too

941
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,440
sometimes she' do three eggs sometimes

942
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:42,480
she three four eggs a day recommended by

943
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:44,680
the doctors they said eggs she needs her

944
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,319
Protein that's the whole point I said oh

945
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:49,040
dear lord we're back to that again and

946
00:36:46,319 --> 00:36:51,599
here we are 19 years later you still

947
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:53,880
hear the same mumble jumble they protein

948
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:55,400
protein oh my God eggs are the best food

949
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:58,480
it's like nothing changed it's why

950
00:36:55,400 --> 00:37:00,319
Spirit also changed my My Life by saying

951
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,520
okay you're leaving the office for now

952
00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:03,880
you buy office spirit said we can't I

953
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,440
said no I don't want to leave the office

954
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:07,000
said spirit said no you got to put this

955
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,319
out on books you got to put this out on

956
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,200
the radio you got to do what you got to

957
00:37:08,319 --> 00:37:13,560
do this is just it's not getting

958
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:16,160
better so the idea is we got to knock

959
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:19,119
down the upsteam bar but what we can do

960
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:23,160
is not just do that we we take away the

961
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:25,920
triggers it's great it's great remove

962
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:27,480
triggers no eggs ever no dairy products

963
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,160
ever

964
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:31,520
lower the amount of red meat cuz red

965
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:33,720
meat's so filled with adrenaline that

966
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:37,000
that could trigger it a little

967
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:39,560
bit and if you're under a lot of stress

968
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:43,280
the the the uh adrenals pump out so much

969
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:44,599
different so much in complex hormones

970
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,880
when you're under fear or stress or

971
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:47,359
anxiety or anything else like that in

972
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:49,000
your life or any kind of problems that

973
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:51,240
could feed the virus and create a

974
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,160
fibroid so we have to try to de-stress a

975
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:54,440
little bit we have to DEC

976
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,880
compartmentalize if we even have to we

977
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:58,079
have to you go to the beach we have to

978
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:59,839
say waves they're crashing on the beach

979
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:02,280
that's what I'm seeing I'm not I'm not

980
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:03,599
seeing I'm not seeing the divorce I went

981
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,599
through I'm not seeing you know the

982
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:08,040
problems I got at work I'm not seeing

983
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:10,560
this and that I'm not just I see waves I

984
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:12,119
see I see clouds you got to you got to

985
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,760
you got to get the stress levels down so

986
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:17,359
there's adrenals calm down a little bit

987
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:18,839
it's all part of stopping fibroids and

988
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:20,640
younger women they get the fibroids

989
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:22,400
absolutely because they got the Epstein

990
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,520
bar early of course you get the Epstein

991
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,000
bar really early you're 14 years old

992
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:28,079
once those hormones start kicking in

993
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,319
they can feed the Epstein bar once

994
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:32,440
anything kicks in stress responsibility

995
00:38:30,319 --> 00:38:34,280
you know there's there's there's I mean

996
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:36,200
young women that that they have to all

997
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:37,880
of a sudden go middle middle school to

998
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:39,520
high school and that that alone is just

999
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:42,920
a tremendous amount of stress they get

1000
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:45,240
mono you name it high school um High

1001
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:47,319
School you're 18 19 years old you got to

1002
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:49,440
go to college and that alone is really

1003
00:38:47,319 --> 00:38:51,000
stressful you get mono in college mono

1004
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,480
becomes a problem you get a fibroid by

1005
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,480
the time you're 29 years old you get a

1006
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,720
little bit of you get a little bit of um

1007
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,240
PCOS possibly developing your doctor is

1008
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:00,359
like okay you got to go on the pill the

1009
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:03,760
pill itself is problematic too a lot

1010
00:39:00,359 --> 00:39:05,680
because the pill can stimulate a fibroid

1011
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,760
because the pill can aggravate Epstein

1012
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:10,920
bar feed Epstein bar so that's something

1013
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:13,040
too that's that's a concern but we do

1014
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:15,040
the best we can so what I'd say as you

1015
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:17,440
work with diet you knock things down

1016
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:20,839
lots of fruit fruit is incredible for

1017
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:24,119
the uterus the uterus and fruit go hand

1018
00:39:20,839 --> 00:39:27,520
in hand the uterus creates a fruit it

1019
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:29,960
creates a fruit it create it it that's

1020
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:34,440
the whole point it grows a

1021
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:36,920
child it's like a pod that grows a

1022
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:39,400
child it grows a

1023
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:41,640
baby that's the

1024
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:45,760
fruit that is the

1025
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:47,240
fruit I mean that's fruit is so critical

1026
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,720
so

1027
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:53,160
important it goes hand in hand with the

1028
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:54,119
woman's reproductive system so to take

1029
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:57,000
out

1030
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:59,920
fruit for some you know

1031
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,359
terrible lame reason in the

1032
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,599
industries is it's just something you

1033
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:06,000
don't want to

1034
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:08,560
do but oh yeah that's right they put a

1035
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,720
little bit of fruit and yogurt they do

1036
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:14,359
there's the sarcasm again I can't help

1037
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:16,079
it I can't help it so one thing and I

1038
00:40:14,359 --> 00:40:18,000
told you I I told you there is the

1039
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:20,400
sarcasm in there because of the passion

1040
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,680
because I I feel bad too and but the

1041
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,599
sarcasm I can't help it a little bit of

1042
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:26,440
that comes out I said to spe a long time

1043
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:27,920
ago I said look you can't change me

1044
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:30,960
though I remember I was a kid and I was

1045
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:32,319
sarc I was a sarcastic little kid and

1046
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,599
spirit said look I don't expect to

1047
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:36,880
change you I just need you to stay

1048
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:39,359
alive that's what spirit said I need you

1049
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:42,520
to stay alive just stay alive and just

1050
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:44,520
and just and work for me for the people

1051
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:46,160
I said I guess I can do that but you're

1052
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:47,599
not going to change who I am I said to

1053
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,920
Spirit you're not going to make me more

1054
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:51,480
spiritual I'm not going to put a gown on

1055
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,400
and and walk around in a gown I'm not

1056
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:55,839
going to be all more spiritual I'm not

1057
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,480
going to have flowers in my hair I mean

1058
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:58,800
I love that I think it's really cool I

1059
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:00,319
got a friend that looks like that all

1060
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,920
the time and I think it's really cool

but I can't do that I can't have my

1062
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:07,119

1065
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,319
spiritual but I like it my friends do it

1066
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:15,119
because you know they I don't know they

where I look more spiritual I'm going to

1082
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:50,839
be sarcastic and spirit said it's okay

1083
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:52,480
doesn't matter doesn't matter we love

1084
00:41:50,839 --> 00:41:54,400
you who you are we just need you to stay

1085
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,200
alive and get the information out little

1086
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,520
bit by little come on I said all right

1087
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:59,280
all right all right I'll do it I had a

1088
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:01,520
struggle with with that actually the

1089
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,440
time I got into the early teens and mid

1090
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:05,560
teens I was like I can't take this

1091
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,920
anymore everybody else is having fun and

1092
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:11,240
doing what they want to do and I got to

1093
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:13,560
hear Spirit 24/7 247 about fibroids but

1094
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:15,200
then I realize it's the most important

1095
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:16,720
thing in the world is making sure we get

1096
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:20,200
fibroids better than women that's the

1097
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:22,119
whole point that's the I mean women in

1098
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:25,160
reproductive systems to keep the human

1099
00:42:22,119 --> 00:42:26,760
race going keep us strong keep women

1100
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:30,240
strong

1101
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:34,079
because they mean so much in our

1102
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:35,559
lives my God going back in history all

1103
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:38,280
the way to the

1104
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:42,240
beginning and it's the most important

1105
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:44,400
thing in the world and so um it matters

1106
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:46,160
it matters herbs raspberry leaf

1107
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,160
incredible for knocking down fibroids

1108
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:50,440
because it does level out the hormones a

1109
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:54,440
little bit hormones that feed EP steam

1110
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:56,559
bar estrogens a woman's estrogen is not

1111
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:58,680
necessarily the estrogen that feeds the

1112
00:42:56,559 --> 00:43:00,119
the Epstein bar virus creating a fibroid

1113
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:03,839
so

1114
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:06,520
much it's it what it is it's estrogens

1115
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:09,079
that are in Foods estrogens in eggs

1116
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:11,520
estrogens in Dairy estrogens in yeah red

1117
00:43:09,079 --> 00:43:14,000
meat little bit in there estrogens in

1118
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:16,440
all kinds of different things though

1119
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,400
estrogens and Plastics estrogens and

1120
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:21,319
solvents medications you name it it's

1121
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:23,079
unbelievable and and those are the

1122
00:43:21,319 --> 00:43:24,559
estrogens that that that need to get

1123
00:43:23,079 --> 00:43:25,800
eliminated and pushed out of the body

1124
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:27,800
and they collect they build up in the

1125
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:30,559
liver the liver has the liver and the

1126
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:33,640
uterus are like they're married together

1127
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:36,040
they're married together the

1128
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:39,960
liver it's like the

1129
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:41,640
husband the uterus is like the wife

1130
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:44,960
seriously

1131
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:48,280
seriously the liver gets all toxic it's

1132
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:51,119
all toxic and all filled with

1133
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:52,960
crap no I see where this is going I

1134
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:55,520
don't think this is going in a good

1135
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,880
place the liver gets all toxic and it

1136
00:43:55,520 --> 00:44:01,440
gets all fil filled with crab and

1137
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:04,599
everything right and then and then you

1138
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:06,319
know and that's a problem because you

1139
00:44:04,599 --> 00:44:07,920
know the epscene bar sits in the liver

1140
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:09,880
and it's you know doing its thing it's

1141
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,880
not just that all the poisons all the

1142
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:15,119
estrogens are trapped in the liver the

1143
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:18,040
liver traps all the estrogens the liver

1144
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:19,559
is cleaning up all this stuff and and

1145
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:22,040
and has all this

1146
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:24,400
stuff and you know and that's not good a

1147
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:27,839
clean liver helps out a clean liver

1148
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:32,680
helps a uterus get better

1149
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:35,440
a clean husband helps a wife get

1150
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:37,480
better you know and so it they're like

1151
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:40,559
hand in hand the estrogens get all

1152
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:42,160
trapped in the liver the liver holds a

1153
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:43,960
lot of different bad estrogens cuz

1154
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:46,160
trying to protect you but they they the

1155
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:47,800
liver gets so clogged up because of say

1156
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:49,240
red meat too much red meat or too much

1157
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:52,680
eggs or whatever it is too they get

1158
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:54,359
clogged up fried greasy food whatever

1159
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:55,960
and it's not good the estrogens they get

1160
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:57,119
they have to get released they get

1161
00:44:55,960 --> 00:45:00,559
release but they don't get out of the

1162
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:03,160
body in time reproductive system takes

1163
00:45:00,559 --> 00:45:05,839
takes it I mean it gets saturated a

1164
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:08,440
little bit feeds the Epstein bar

careful with that lower the animal

1213
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:06,680
proteins lower them get the liver a

1214
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:09,119
little bit better the fibroids will go

1215
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:13,160
way faster you won't

1216
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:16,079
feed the Epstein bar fibroid variety you

1217
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:18,400
won't feed it and you can be in a better

1218
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:21,359
place a much better place you can reduce

1219
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:25,280

great great relief you know with

1346
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:30,040
fibroids with women over the years

1347
00:52:26,599 --> 00:52:31,680
spirit Spirit would say juice asparagus

1348
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:34,720
juice

1349
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:36,240
asparagus and you know in the days when

1350
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:38,520
people didn't even know you could juice

1351
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:40,640
asparagus be like juice asparagus they

1352
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:42,760
would juice it every single day raw

1353
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:43,559
asparagus juice it and the fibroids

1354
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:45,520
would

1355
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:48,400
reduce they would

1356
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:51,240
reduce we can take

1357
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:52,160
control we can take control and do what

1358
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:54,359
we need to

1359
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:56,119
do so see these are some of the things

1360
00:52:54,359 --> 00:52:57,520
to consider

1361
00:52:56,119 --> 00:52:58,960
and once you know what creates your

1362
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:00,760
fibroids you only get stronger I'm going

1363
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:03,200
to tell you that right now once you know

1364
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:05,160
what creates your fibroids you only get

1365
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:08,200
stronger Epstein bar weakens when you

1366
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:09,440
know the truth which makes me upset

1367
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:11,880
about the

1368
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:13,559
industries they either don't know about

1369
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:15,480
Epstein bar with all the different

1370
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:18,400
things that spirit and I know or if they

1371
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:21,319
do know God help

1372
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:23,040
them meaning God help them because

1373
00:53:21,319 --> 00:53:24,760
they're messing up bad by not letting

1374
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:27,079
anybody know what what's the real cause

1375
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:32,119
of anything thing if they do

1376
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:33,880
know and you know seriously it's sad and

1377
00:53:32,119 --> 00:53:36,280
because when you do know what causes

1378
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:38,280
something you get stronger your immune

1379
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:39,680
system goes after the very thing that

1380
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:41,440
causes a fibroid when you know what's

1381
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:43,000
going on when you know what's wrong it's

1382
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:44,960
half the battle I say it every time I

1383
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,760
got to say that one more time half the

1384
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:48,440
battle of healing is knowing what's

1385
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:53,480
wrong what's the other half what's the

1386
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:56,400
other half knowing what to do knowing

1387
00:53:53,480 --> 00:54:00,119
