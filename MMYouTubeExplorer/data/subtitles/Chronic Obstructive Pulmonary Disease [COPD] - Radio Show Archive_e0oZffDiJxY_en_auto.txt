[9.04 - 15.72] find out what's making you sick and how
[10.92 - 18.56] to heal Anthony William is the medical
[15.72 - 19.96] medium hello I'm Anthony William and
[18.56 - 21.92] you're listening to the medical medium
[19.96 - 24.28] radio show where each week I talk about
[21.92 - 25.88] the most advanced healing information
[24.28 - 28.68] and secrets about health much of which
[25.88 - 31.12] is not found anywhere else and is
[28.68 - 32.96] decades ahead of what's out there now as
[31.12 - 35.28] I've always said who has 10 20 30 years
[32.96 - 38.60] to wait for answers because when you're
[35.28 - 40.52] sick and you don't feel good regardless
[38.60 - 42.52] of whatever whatever the diagnosis is or
[40.52 - 44.60] non-diagnosis or wrong diagnosis or
[42.52 - 46.80] misdiagnosis whatever it is if you're
[44.60 - 48.68] sick and you're not feeling good whether
[46.80 - 50.88] you got an answer that could almost be
[48.68 - 52.92] right maybe it's not right maybe it is
[50.88 - 56.12] doesn't matter you don't feel good and
[52.92 - 58.96] when you don't feel good that's not good
[56.12 - 61.84] me what I mean by that is for people who

[199.48 - 203.28] that hey look we're going to do
[201.48 - 206.16] something about this hey there's not a
[203.28 - 208.48] lot of that kindness for how many people

[217.80 - 221.84] of the country it's most of the country
[219.52 - 223.92] at this point guess what it's going to
[221.84 - 226.68] get a lot worse a lot worse we're
[223.92 - 228.36] talking about COPD today so just hang in
[226.68 - 230.12] there we're we're getting there just
[228.36 - 231.32] we're we're we're there's a reason why
[230.12 - 235.12] I'm talking about this because we're
[231.32 - 237.12] heading into COPD hang in there this is
[235.12 - 238.52] the only show just so you know where the
[237.12 - 240.56] information here doesn't come from
[238.52 - 242.76] medical interest group groups it's not
[240.56 - 245.32] repackaged reg garbled it's not
[242.76 - 247.76] repackaged recycled Theory constantly in
[245.32 - 250.00] every single book out there right now in
[247.76 - 251.72] the medical realm alternatively and
[250.00 - 253.84] conventionally it's not recycled it's
[251.72 - 256.56] not repackaged and just Rewritten and
[253.84 - 258.00] thrown back out there with bogus studies
[256.56 - 261.80] and everything else and citations of
[258.00 - 264.96] bogus studies this information is free
[261.80 - 266.28] from all of that thank God because
[264.96 - 269.72] that's why I've been able to get people
[266.28 - 272.12] better over the last 35 years and even
[269.72 - 273.84] more since I was four years old so it's
[272.12 - 276.08] not backed by you know medical funding
[273.84 - 278.00] with strings attached it's not it's not
[276.08 - 280.08] attached to this information it's clean
[278.00 - 283.04] there's no botched research interest
[280.08 - 285.16] groups and investors investing in
[283.04 - 288.28] something so the outcome comes a certain
[285.16 - 290.52] way news flash it's like that in all
[288.28 - 294.08] fields of chronic illness and medicine
[290.52 - 295.60] at this point Sorry but it is and so it
[294.08 - 297.96] doesn't have that contamination that
[295.60 - 299.20] botch research it doesn't have the whole
[297.96 - 300.92] thing with the medical lobbyist behind
[299.20 - 302.20] it internal Kickbacks yeah internal
[300.92 - 304.04] Kickbacks you wouldn't believe the money
[302.20 - 307.12] that's constantly changing hands all
[304.04 - 309.76] through alternative medicine alternative
[307.12 - 312.32] medicine and conventional medicine
[309.76 - 315.52] persuaded belief systems which poisons
[312.32 - 317.64] everything persuaded belief systems is
[315.52 - 319.04] like this whole thing where it becomes
[317.64 - 320.84] you don't want to know the truth because
[319.04 - 322.08] you're saturated in a belief system
[320.84 - 323.68] someone doesn't want to know the truth
[322.08 - 325.20] someone doesn't want to be open to the
[323.68 - 326.80] truth cuz they're saturated in a belief
[325.20 - 328.72] system I can't tell you what that does
[326.80 - 330.80] and gets in the way and this is why
[328.72 - 333.44] people are still sick and not getting
[330.80 - 334.92] better and it's why people are getting
[333.44 - 336.80] sicker and sicker and sicker private
[334.92 - 338.88] panels of influencers yeah they're there
[336.80 - 341.72] health field payoffs and trendy traps
[338.88 - 345.24] those trendy traps oh my god look out
[341.72 - 347.20] for them there's a new one each year and
[345.24 - 349.08] you'll get sucked into it you'll get
[347.20 - 350.72] funneled into it you'll get pulled into
[349.08 - 352.92] it you'll get tricked by it that's right
[350.72 - 356.88] you better believe it whether anybody
[352.92 - 357.92] likes it or not it's just a fact Jack um
[356.88 - 359.68] this is the only show where the
[357.92 - 361.80] information here is pure untampered with
[359.68 - 363.16] Advanced Clean source so I work for you
[361.80 - 364.76] I work for you I'm not sitting here

[377.32 - 382.08] would I would if I was just out there
[380.08 - 384.12] and and I wasn't Anthony William and I
[382.08 - 385.48] wasn't given this gift at age 4 and
[384.12 - 386.92] spent my whole life getting people
[385.48 - 388.68] better including the thousands and
[386.92 - 390.76] thousands and hundreds and hundreds of
[388.68 - 392.68] thousands of people now we're at the
[390.76 - 395.20] point right now where in the millions of
[392.68 - 398.20] people that have the books and have the
[395.20 - 400.44] information in the millions globally and
[398.20 - 402.32] they're healing hundreds of thousands of
[400.44 - 404.24] people are their lives are being turned
[402.32 - 406.12] around in they're healing unlike
[404.24 - 408.04] anything seen in alternative medicine
[406.12 - 410.32] ever before in history is what's going
[408.04 - 412.44] on just so you know that's happening
[410.32 - 414.24] right now thanks to Spirit and thanks to
[412.44 - 416.88] you thanks to everybody involved here
[414.24 - 418.24] it's incredible so so here's the whole
[416.88 - 421.20] point wouldn't want wouldn't you want
[418.24 - 424.12] that pure un tampered source of
[421.20 - 426.32] information that's not dirtied up by all
[424.12 - 429.20] that other garbage I just mentioned yes
[426.32 - 432.04] so we're I would want it I'm sorry but I
[429.20 - 434.76] would want that so we're talking about
[432.04 - 437.48] COPD now what I was saying earlier is
[434.76 - 438.76] that everybody's getting sick yes
[437.48 - 440.96] everybody's getting sick they're getting
[438.76 - 442.12] a diagnosis you go into I'm not just
[440.96 - 444.12] talking about people that are in their
[442.12 - 445.52] 40s and 50s and they got some
[444.12 - 447.96] hypertension and they got some heart
[445.52 - 450.40] disease you know cooking or they had a
[447.96 - 453.68] stroke which is still most Strokes are
[450.40 - 455.48] actually mystery to all doctors all of
[453.68 - 457.72] this would it I'm not just talking about
[455.48 - 459.72] that I'm talking about people in their
[457.72 - 462.16] 20s I'm talking about people in their
[459.72 - 465.04] 30s I'm talking about people in their
[462.16 - 467.44] teens teenagers talking about little
[465.04 - 470.96] kids and little ones getting sick like
[467.44 - 473.76] never before in human history just so
[470.96 - 475.16] you know never before in human history
[473.76 - 476.84] I'm letting you know I'm letting you
[475.16 - 479.60] know the truth I'm letting you know I'm
[476.84 - 481.72] just I'm I'm giving it to you there I
[479.60 - 485.40] said this in one of the other shows that
[481.72 - 487.08] years ago I knew that life expectancy
[485.40 - 490.24] was declining I knew that it was all it
[487.08 - 492.80] was all you know it was all declining I
[490.24 - 494.92] knew how long you live was declining but
[492.80 - 498.20] it was ignored no one was doing any
[494.92 - 499.64] studies no one was doing I knew I knew
[498.20 - 501.52] of course and doesn't mean the studies
[499.64 - 503.72] would even come out right because if
[501.52 - 505.96] they want to hide that that everybody's
[503.72 - 508.36] getting sicker and not healthier if they
[505.96 - 509.84] want to hide that they can easily all
[508.36 - 511.40] you have to do is have somebody invest
[509.84 - 513.08] into the study and boom it goes the
[511.40 - 514.80] direction they need to go or an investor
[513.08 - 516.24] will never invest in it again and a
[514.80 - 518.40] study will never happen for that person
[516.24 - 520.88] who wanted to do the study career over
[518.40 - 522.60] done so what happens is they all come in
[520.88 - 524.12] you know so they've been saying oh we
[522.60 - 526.08] live longer we're living longer I've
[524.12 - 527.88] been watching it decline since the 80s
[526.08 - 530.12] been watching it decline since the 90s
[527.88 - 532.32] been watching the health decline in in
[530.12 - 535.48] in the US since the 2000s and now just
[532.32 - 539.20] recently recently it got out because it
[535.48 - 541.24] was it was impossible to hide it or
[539.20 - 544.52] starting to drop they're starting to say
[541.24 - 547.72] well no life doesn't go as long as we
[544.52 - 550.36] thought it is now it's starting to drop
[547.72 - 552.80] the numbers are dropping you you don't
[550.36 - 556.88] live you know life average isn't this
[552.80 - 560.04] number anymore it's coming down because
[556.88 - 562.40] you can't hide it you can't hide
[560.04 - 566.20] it there's millions and millions of
[562.40 - 569.24] doctors offices globally being filled up
[566.20 - 571.20] and filled up and filled up and it's
[569.24 - 574.36] like it's never before in history have
[571.20 - 576.24] been like this and the young people the
[574.36 - 577.80] young people I've said this before I've
[576.24 - 580.72] written it in the book One medical
[577.80 - 585.24] medium okay
[580.72 - 588.20] 17 roughly around this number 17 out of
[585.24 - 590.00] a hundred college students go home and
[588.20 - 592.00] don't come back not because they're
[590.00 - 594.28] disinterested in their work not because
[592.00 - 595.64] they don't want to be interested in
[594.28 - 598.96] their studies not because they don't
[595.64 - 601.24] want to be in school not because they
[598.96 - 602.68] want want to change course or Direction
[601.24 - 606.60] in their
[602.68 - 609.88] life roughly around 17 out of a 100
[606.60 - 613.64] college students go home because they're
[609.88 - 616.28] done they're done they're in bed can't
[613.64 - 618.48] function barely Confunction and talk
[616.28 - 620.04] getting diagnoses left and right of Ms
[618.48 - 622.00] and Lyme disease and everything else and
[620.04 - 624.04] nobody knows what's going on being told
[622.00 - 626.00] they're just being lazy being told that
[624.04 - 628.52] they're brain foged maybe they just need
[626.00 - 629.88] a drug going to different doctors and
[628.52 - 632.16] they're done
[629.88 - 635.24] that's it not going back to school and
[632.16 - 637.32] most of them women most of them women
[635.24 - 639.20] young women that don't end up going back
[637.32 - 641.28] to college and then all the other
[639.20 - 643.28] reindeer just moving forward they watch
[641.28 - 644.68] all the reindeer moving forward they
[643.28 - 646.84] have to sit back watching their old
[644.68 - 648.32] friends move on with their careers and
[646.84 - 650.56] it's not that they're not getting sick
[648.32 - 651.96] either most people are in this day and
[650.56 - 654.56] age getting things wrong with them
[651.96 - 657.12] constantly non-stop no one wants to
[654.56 - 659.64] check into that on how kids have to go
[657.12 - 660.68] home because they're getting vertigo
[659.64 - 662.48] chronic
[660.68 - 665.28] vertigo and they're they're getting
[662.48 - 667.32] dizzy balance problems severe severe
[665.28 - 669.00] severe debilitating brain fog fatigue
[667.32 - 673.20] neurological fatigue that I talk about
[669.00 - 676.20] all the time and that's it gone home no
[673.20 - 679.32] finishing school no one cares no one
[676.20 - 681.88] cares in the industries no one cares the
[679.32 - 684.68] parents care the parents care no one
[681.88 - 686.12] cares no one else the parents and the
[684.68 - 687.56] families of these children most of them
[686.12 - 689.64] care of course and whatnot but I'm just
[687.56 - 693.28] saying the industry does
[689.64 - 695.36] care whatever whatever and so that's how
[693.28 - 698.52] it works so is is things getting better
[695.36 - 699.92] no I've been watching it it's not I used
[698.52 - 701.92] to be in the I used to sit in the
[699.92 - 704.16] nursing homes to visit clients all
[701.92 - 705.64] through the years and I I see younger
[704.16 - 707.44] people filing into those nursing homes
[705.64 - 709.16] like never before younger younger
[707.44 - 711.76] younger people younger people younger
[709.16 - 713.76] people it is
[711.76 - 715.00] unbelievable and that's what we live
[713.76 - 717.80] with now and that's what we're living
[715.00 - 720.36] with now but hey whatever and I say
[717.80 - 722.12] whatever because you know what
[720.36 - 723.20] the industry the industry just doesn't
[722.12 - 724.80] care they'll just pass it off to
[723.20 - 726.76] genetics pretty soon completely every
[724.80 - 729.08] single disease is genetic if it's not
[726.76 - 730.72] your body attacking itself which is bull
[729.08 - 733.12] it's going to be the genetic theory
[730.72 - 734.64] another theory this is how it's done out
[733.12 - 735.96] there they're not going to go into
[734.64 - 737.12] viruses really deep because you know
[735.96 - 738.96] what's going to happen if they go into
[737.12 - 741.00] viruses really deep if they understand
[738.96 - 742.60] the 60 varieties the over 60 varieties
[741.00 - 745.40] now of Epstein bar that I talk about in
[742.60 - 747.24] thyroid healing and book one medical
[745.40 - 749.04] medium if they start actually trying to
[747.24 - 750.84] figure out any of the information that
[749.04 - 752.04] been been providing all these years if
[750.84 - 754.28] they even go into it there's going to be
[752.04 - 758.96] hell to pay and I'll tell you why
[754.28 - 762.04] because every mom out there every mother
[758.96 - 764.00] and every grandmother is going to want
[762.04 - 766.92] something done about it because they
[764.00 - 770.24] know they would know what's going down
[766.92 - 772.04] because these viruses are out here and
[770.24 - 775.32] being ignored and there's going to be
[772.04 - 776.88] hell to pay Mama Bear Mama Bear with her
[775.32 - 779.36] children knowing that her children have
[776.88 - 782.00] been affected by a virus like Epstein
[779.36 - 783.76] bar and no one cares and they're not
[782.00 - 785.16] doing anything about it and they want to
[783.76 - 786.64] pass it off as all this other junk
[785.16 - 788.72] medicine and junk studies and everything
[786.64 - 791.16] else you wouldn't believe the hell to
[788.72 - 793.20] pay if the information really got out
[791.16 - 795.12] there and really got out there somebody
[793.20 - 796.56] would have to be held accountable and
[795.12 - 798.44] that's this is the prime example so
[796.56 - 800.72] anyway we're talking about we're talking
[798.44 - 803.60] about COPD and and you're probably
[800.72 - 806.56] wondering well he's not getting the COPD
[803.60 - 809.76] yet I'm talking about this because copt
[806.56 - 811.04] COPD has doubled since the 8
[809.76 - 814.00] as far as
[811.04 - 815.28] cases now they say out there it's
[814.00 - 818.80] doubled since the
[815.28 - 821.44] 80s it's more than doubled okay so my
[818.80 - 824.92] source says it's way more than doubled
[821.44 - 829.60] it's not doubled it's tripled since the
[824.92 - 831.80] 80s tripled since the 80s COPD so
[829.60 - 833.76] because there's a lot of levels of COPD
[831.80 - 836.28] that are not diagnosed properly of CD
[833.76 - 837.72] and it's also the they don't when they
[836.28 - 839.76] when they look into those things they're
[837.72 - 842.72] just averaged out they're not even done
[839.76 - 844.20] right but there's so many cases of
[842.72 - 847.88] beginner
[844.20 - 849.28] COPD and they're not even added into it
[847.88 - 851.40] and also you know they also do this
[849.28 - 855.28] weird thing where they just don't throw
[851.40 - 858.68] every COPD case into the
[855.28 - 861.40] numbers they throw the smokers in and
[858.68 - 863.88] they leave others out that's what they
[861.40 - 867.16] do so they say well it's doubled since
[863.88 - 870.96] the80s actually you know it's tripled
[867.16 - 872.64] and even going past that so how is that
[870.96 - 875.24] possible how's that possible I thought
[872.64 - 877.48] we're getting better in medicine I
[875.24 - 879.24] thought we're getting better I mean we
[877.48 - 881.00] are we got laser surgery we got
[879.24 - 883.28] different you great techniques we got
[881.00 - 886.24] Great Brain surgeons even though hey
[883.28 - 888.48] we're still we're still like you know
[886.24 - 890.72] like a grain of rice compared to a silo
[888.48 - 892.12] of rice is in knowledge and brain
[890.72 - 894.20] knowledge but we still got some great
[892.12 - 896.76] brain surgeons we can transplant a few
[894.20 - 899.84] different organs I mean you
[896.76 - 903.56] know we got a lot going on
[899.84 - 906.12] on and we got a lot of good going on but
[903.56 - 909.68] why are we here with everything getting
[906.12 - 911.88] worse to the degree it's getting worse
[909.68 - 914.80] what's my predictions what's my
[911.88 - 916.72] predictions which always come out true
[914.80 - 919.04] what are they it's going to get a lot
[916.72 - 921.36] worse than this it's going to get a lot
[919.04 - 923.96] and a lot worse because when you look at
[921.36 - 925.52] where the experts are going including
[923.96 - 927.16] the Alternative Health experts with
[925.52 - 928.72] their books and everything else and you
[927.16 - 929.60] look at what they're doing and what
[928.72 - 931.88] they're putting out there and what
[929.60 - 933.44] they're writing we're not we're we're
[931.88 - 935.88] not getting anything done we're not
[933.44 - 937.72] going anywhere we're not going anywhere
[935.88 - 938.88] and then you look you look at you know
[937.72 - 940.40] the information that's out there in the
[938.88 - 943.20] internet and like okay we're not going
[940.40 - 945.08] anywhere there you you look at I mean
[943.20 - 947.56] it's not in conventional medicine we're
[945.08 - 949.28] not going anywhere there we're not
[947.56 - 951.52] cleaning up the mess we're not cleaning
[949.28 - 953.48] up the viral mess that's taken over the
[951.52 - 955.60] world and the country here this country
[953.48 - 957.36] here we're not looking we're not
[955.60 - 961.08] figuring out what the real cause of
[957.36 - 964.20] Lupus is we don't no one cares no one
[961.08 - 967.12] cares what the real cause of Lupus is we
[964.20 - 969.48] do no one else does in the industries
[967.12 - 971.32] meaning nobody doctors care but nobody a
[969.48 - 973.68] lot of doctors care but nobody above
[971.32 - 975.84] that the people that pull the strings
[973.68 - 979.40] and pull the pull the strings and make
[975.84 - 981.36] the moves up there so you have to
[979.40 - 984.52] understand you have to understand that
[981.36 - 987.08] this is this is a serious thing going on
[984.52 - 988.88] where I predict sickness to come even
[987.08 - 991.00] more and more and more and when I see
[988.88 - 993.00] the genetic stuff coming out where it's
[991.00 - 994.96] all oh it's your genes let's do you know
[993.00 - 996.20] let's theorize about it's your genes
[994.96 - 997.60] that's why you're sick that means we're
[996.20 - 1000.00] getting nowhere because nothing's going
[997.60 - 1003.32] to be fixed nothing nothing's going to
[1000.00 - 1005.04] be fixed sure you know we could do the
[1003.32 - 1007.36] high fat trendy diets take away
[1005.04 - 1008.64] processed food and people can get better
[1007.36 - 1011.40] with some of their symptoms and call it
[1008.64 - 1013.08] an autoimmune diet when they don't even
[1011.40 - 1014.40] know what autoimmune is that's what I
[1013.08 - 1016.52] love here's here's here's something
[1014.40 - 1019.28] that's really really disturbing and I
[1016.52 - 1021.64] love to talk about it because I I try to
[1019.28 - 1024.80] I try to get people to know and
[1021.64 - 1026.44] learn and you got the whole autoimmune
[1024.80 - 1027.68] thing going on out there so you get all
[1026.44 - 1030.84] this information you get all these books
[1027.68 - 1032.84] autoimmune this autoimmune that and they
[1030.84 - 1034.92] don't know how autoimmune works or what
[1032.84 - 1037.64] causes it or what causes any autoimmune
[1034.92 - 1039.24] diseases that's what I'm saying so do
[1037.64 - 1041.72] you think we're going to get healthier
[1039.24 - 1043.04] no get outside of pulling out processed
[1041.72 - 1044.24] food and cleaning up your diet and
[1043.04 - 1046.72] people improving their lives a little
[1044.24 - 1049.20] bit doing more exercise and you know
[1046.72 - 1053.08] those kinds of things can help but we're
[1049.20 - 1055.96] still getting sicker faster younger ages
[1053.08 - 1058.80] rampant Pace going forward like never
[1055.96 - 1060.12] before in that and what you're seeing in
[1058.80 - 1062.96] the literature out there now and
[1060.12 - 1065.60] everything is not even close and here we
[1062.96 - 1068.28] are in this year it another decade going
[1065.60 - 1070.76] to go by another decade's going to go by
[1068.28 - 1073.24] and no one still knows what even
[1070.76 - 1075.12] autoimmune means except for spirit and
[1073.24 - 1078.52] ie it's
[1075.12 - 1080.72] disturbing it's disturbing so what's my
[1078.52 - 1083.44] prediction lots and lots of sickness
[1080.72 - 1085.04] like never before with bogus theories
[1083.44 - 1086.88] such as the autoimmune Theory which is
[1085.04 - 1089.04] completely wrong such as the genetic
[1086.88 - 1090.76] theor which is completely wrong I'm not
[1089.04 - 1092.76] not denying we don't have genes and how
[1090.76 - 1096.48] important they are and the Mysteries
[1092.76 - 1097.76] involved in it but it it has nothing to
[1096.48 - 1099.48] do with the chronic illness that we're
[1097.76 - 1101.60] seeing with people suffering today and
[1099.48 - 1103.80] it has nothing to do with
[1101.60 - 1107.32] COPD because they're passing off
[1103.80 - 1109.80] nonsmokers with COPD into the genetic
[1107.32 - 1112.40] category that's what they're
[1109.80 - 1114.24] doing you you see how it's going you see
[1112.40 - 1116.00] what I mean how it's going in what
[1114.24 - 1118.00] direction it is they're passing that off
[1116.00 - 1120.88] to the genetic theory because if it's
[1118.00 - 1123.08] not somebody who obviously smoked and
[1120.88 - 1125.40] puffed all those all those heavy duty
[1123.08 - 1128.56] cigarettes their whole life if it's not
[1125.40 - 1130.68] that person and you didn't do that H you
[1128.56 - 1132.72] know you go to the doctor I how can I
[1130.68 - 1135.16] have COPD there lug problems I thought
[1132.72 - 1136.36] it was just asthma and how am I having
[1135.16 - 1139.28] this
[1136.36 - 1140.92] COPD I never smoke
[1139.28 - 1144.32] and they're just no well science and
[1140.92 - 1146.96] research and studies say w it's it's
[1144.32 - 1150.40] genetic now you got to it's your
[1146.96 - 1152.36] genes oh my God dear Lord we're so going
[1150.40 - 1153.08] nowhere to decades to come and decades
[1152.36 - 1158.12] to
[1153.08 - 1160.76] come it's really sad it's really sad not
[1158.12 - 1162.88] not well you know this is what's going
[1160.76 - 1164.56] on with your lung sex this is the virus
[1162.88 - 1167.32] behind your lung sex this is the
[1164.56 - 1169.76] bacteria behind your lung sax this is
[1167.32 - 1171.24] this is your lymphatic system condition
[1169.76 - 1173.36] this is what's going on inside your
[1171.24 - 1175.04] liver this is what's really happening
[1173.36 - 1176.96] here none of that no you won't hear any
[1175.04 - 1179.88] of that you won't hear any of
[1176.96 - 1183.56] that there there nothing like that it
[1179.88 - 1185.60] won't even exist it won't even exist
[1183.56 - 1187.48] instead it to be like no it's it's look
[1185.60 - 1190.04] we just got to get you on all the
[1187.48 - 1191.72] medications and look some medications
[1190.04 - 1192.96] sustain people's lives when they and
[1191.72 - 1194.44] that's the that's the good part of
[1192.96 - 1196.52] conventional medicine Sometimes some
[1194.44 - 1198.72] medications do help and sustain people's
[1196.52 - 1200.24] lives with COPD oxygen 10 TKS you name
[1198.72 - 1201.88] it but it's like it's like okay it's
[1200.24 - 1204.72] just no it's genetic if you didn't
[1201.88 - 1207.56] actually damage your lungs with some
[1204.72 - 1210.92] kind of chemicals or
[1207.56 - 1213.96] whatever so and that's where we are
[1210.92 - 1217.80] we're nowhere it's called nowhere
[1213.96 - 1220.08] absolutely nowhere is what it's called
[1217.80 - 1223.56] and what year is it you think we're in
[1220.08 - 1225.28] modern times you think that we're you
[1223.56 - 1227.04] know where it's going on the BET look it
[1225.28 - 1229.32] is amazing what computer technology can
[1227.04 - 1231.48] do and Tech and the Tech world can do
[1229.32 - 1234.20] it's absolutely astounding and
[1231.48 - 1236.40] amazing absolutely but that goes ahead
[1234.20 - 1237.88] that's moving ahead of what we do for
[1236.40 - 1240.36] sickness and chronic illness that's just
[1237.88 - 1243.40] moving way ahead in a different
[1240.36 - 1244.92] field versus understanding what's wrong
[1243.40 - 1247.12] with people in their sickness and their
[1244.92 - 1249.24] diseases and illnesses and all their
[1247.12 - 1251.72] symptoms that that that's enti that's
[1249.24 - 1254.28] not even you don't you don't get fooled
[1251.72 - 1255.80] by that when you think look look where
[1254.28 - 1257.36] the tech world is going when you're
[1255.80 - 1259.88] young and you feel indestructible and
[1257.36 - 1261.96] you don't have symptoms a lot of
[1259.88 - 1262.96] symptoms that are you know in the way of
[1261.96 - 1265.72] your
[1262.96 - 1267.36] life and and you're you know using the
[1265.72 - 1269.24] tech world you're like oh yeah we have
[1267.36 - 1271.20] science down pat right now we got
[1269.24 - 1273.08] genetic technology down we got
[1271.20 - 1274.68] everything down pat we just just listen
[1273.08 - 1276.48] to your doctors listen to science when
[1274.68 - 1278.92] any peer reviews out there let's listen
[1276.48 - 1281.36] to it you think you think it's all there
[1278.92 - 1283.28] you start getting sick you learn fast
[1281.36 - 1286.20] you learn fast after you've been to your
[1283.28 - 1288.40] fifth doctor you start learning quick
[1286.20 - 1290.48] when you start giving that oh your G ADC
[1288.40 - 1292.08] or well we don't know what it is oh no
[1290.48 - 1294.36] you you got lime even though you were
[1292.08 - 1297.08] never exposed to a tick oh you got this
[1294.36 - 1299.32] oh you got that it it you start learning
[1297.08 - 1301.16] quick oh wait what's my treatment it's
[1299.32 - 1302.96] just antibiotics wait a minute what's my
[1301.16 - 1304.84] treatment it's just it's just
[1302.96 - 1306.48] immunosuppressive and antibiotics so
[1304.84 - 1308.00] what's wrong I've been sick for 2 years
[1306.48 - 1309.40] what do you mean I was doing great I was
[1308.00 - 1311.96] on top of the world a little while I'm
[1309.40 - 1313.44] 28 years old what what's my treatment
[1311.96 - 1314.88] isn't there better knowledge out there
[1313.44 - 1316.88] than this I've been to five doctors
[1314.88 - 1319.72] eight doctors 10 neurologists what do
[1316.88 - 1321.44] you mean my my my my my phone my
[1319.72 - 1323.44] computer phone does everything it's got
[1321.44 - 1325.48] every Emoji there is in the world and
[1323.44 - 1327.64] it's got every ability to Tech this and
[1325.48 - 1330.56] do this and talk to this person and live
[1327.64 - 1332.00] chat this and do all this and look you
[1330.56 - 1333.52] know what I mean I work at this you I
[1332.00 - 1335.04] work at this company and they got the
[1333.52 - 1337.20] best everything and you wouldn't believe
[1335.04 - 1338.72] it you just they they scan your retina
[1337.20 - 1340.84] and you walk through the door you don't
[1338.72 - 1342.52] even need a card hanging off your neck
[1340.84 - 1343.92] and you can't you and I'm chronically
[1342.52 - 1345.44] ill and I got fatigue and I can't
[1343.92 - 1347.56] function anymore what's wrong with me I
[1345.44 - 1349.84] got sio what I got bacteria in my
[1347.56 - 1351.84] intestinal track what's going on I got
[1349.84 - 1353.92] what what's wrong and I can't function I
[1351.84 - 1355.64] can't think and I got brain fog why
[1353.92 - 1357.20] aren't we fixing all this how is this
[1355.64 - 1359.28] possible and that's what happens to
[1357.20 - 1362.56] every single
[1359.28 - 1365.56] person who believes we have it all sewed
[1362.56 - 1367.24] up when they're feeling pretty good and
[1365.56 - 1368.80] they're young and they believe and they
[1367.24 - 1371.84] don't have a lot of life experience and
[1368.80 - 1373.80] they believe we have it all sewed
[1371.84 - 1376.00] up and then
[1373.80 - 1378.04] bam and it's happening more and more
[1376.00 - 1380.60] years ago was just you know was just so
[1378.04 - 1381.56] many people in the in their 20s and
[1380.60 - 1385.04] their late
[1381.56 - 1386.72] teens now it's truck loads and bus loads
[1385.04 - 1389.00] and train
[1386.72 - 1394.44] loads and they're
[1389.00 - 1397.28] learning a hard hard way Hard Knocks and
[1394.44 - 1398.16] they're learning wait a minute there's
[1397.28 - 1400.44] no
[1398.16 - 1404.08] answers and and I've been to the best
[1400.44 - 1406.88] functional medicine doctor I've spent 50
[1404.08 - 1409.80] 80,000 50 60 70
[1406.88 - 1412.28] $80,000 and I don't have
[1409.80 - 1413.84] answers you know it's it's it's it's
[1412.28 - 1417.12] unbelievable the amount of information
[1413.84 - 1418.24] Spirit and I gave people that came to me
[1417.12 - 1422.00] over the
[1418.24 - 1424.12] years was more information than they can
[1422.00 - 1426.20] get anywhere else even today right now
[1424.12 - 1429.32] anywhere and they had not only the
[1426.20 - 1433.00] answers but they recovered if they
[1429.32 - 1434.88] applied themselves to What Spirit wanted
[1433.00 - 1436.24] they recovered and thousands have and
[1434.88 - 1439.00] thousands are now just with the books
[1436.24 - 1440.44] alone and everything else
[1439.00 - 1442.76] and I've had to dedicate my life to
[1440.44 - 1445.36] these books and now I can't I can't work
[1442.76 - 1447.84] with with anybody anymore and it breaks
[1445.36 - 1450.24] my heart that it can't but I put it all
[1447.84 - 1452.28] in the books and if you read them
[1450.24 - 1454.20] carefully and you bring them to your
[1452.28 - 1455.84] practitioners or you bring them to
[1454.20 - 1459.88] people that can read it for you if you
[1455.84 - 1463.76] can't read it you will find your way and
[1459.88 - 1465.72] heal you will find your way and heal and
[1463.76 - 1467.20] and if you have to bring it to
[1465.72 - 1469.88] practitioner to interpret it you bring
[1467.20 - 1471.60] it to a practitioner to interpret it and
[1469.88 - 1474.12] whatever you need to
[1471.60 - 1475.88] do but things are getting bad out there
[1474.12 - 1478.24] and the answers have to come and people
[1475.88 - 1481.24] have to get the answers and Tech and
[1478.24 - 1483.32] Tech and computers and everything we got
[1481.24 - 1484.96] going out right now and genes and the
[1483.32 - 1486.88] theories in the medical world and the
[1484.96 - 1489.72] technology we have and the best cars we
[1486.88 - 1491.92] have isn't providing the answers in the
[1489.72 - 1493.44] health realm for people it is the wild
[1491.92 - 1495.56] west out there in the internet and is
[1493.44 - 1498.24] the Wild West in the books out there and
[1495.56 - 1499.80] it's and they're still avoiding trying
[1498.24 - 1502.24] to even look into what's going on and
[1499.80 - 1504.76] when they do try to grab a little tidbit
[1502.24 - 1506.36] because it gets popular because because
[1504.76 - 1509.76] a popular
[1506.36 - 1511.08] popularized can't say that word some of
[1509.76 - 1513.44] the things like epine bar and other
[1511.08 - 1515.24] things they take a little piece of it
[1513.44 - 1516.96] and they don't want more than that so
[1515.24 - 1518.56] people still get confused and go down
[1516.96 - 1520.04] the wrong road and down a trap it's
[1518.56 - 1523.72] unbelievable
[1520.04 - 1524.72] COPD reminds me of this because when you
[1523.72 - 1527.44] have
[1524.72 - 1529.24] COPD and you're told it's genetic and
[1527.44 - 1531.00] you didn't smoke and if you had it when
[1529.24 - 1532.12] you smoke too I mean that's there's
[1531.00 - 1533.28] people out there that smoke their whole
[1532.12 - 1535.96] lives and don't get
[1533.28 - 1539.44] COPD and then there's people who
[1535.96 - 1541.76] smoke and get it quick with with a
[1539.44 - 1543.28] fraction of their life smoking and
[1541.76 - 1545.28] there's a reason for this everybody's
[1543.28 - 1547.76] different everybody's different to what
[1545.28 - 1551.00] degree or what can trigger it what how
[1547.76 - 1554.60] it can get to the point it gets to what
[1551.00 - 1557.72] happens and it it's unbelievable how it
[1554.60 - 1558.48] works the uh you know so the whole point
[1557.72 - 1562.88] with
[1558.48 - 1565.24] COPD is that people they struggle they
[1562.88 - 1566.72] get beaten down by it there's no answers
[1565.24 - 1568.48] out there and we're going to cover that
[1566.72 - 1571.12] right now that's what we're going to do
[1568.48 - 1572.44] so let's talk about bacteria and viruses
[1571.12 - 1576.32] because that's that's where I'm heading
[1572.44 - 1579.40] now COPD is not only tripling but in in
[1576.32 - 1583.20] about I'd say about another decade 10
[1579.40 - 1585.16] years maybe 15 coming on 15 it's going
[1583.20 - 1587.68] to quadruple but it's going to hit the
[1585.16 - 1589.20] youth it's going to hit the youth it's
[1587.68 - 1591.20] going to hit the young people and it's
[1589.20 - 1594.16] going to hit the people in their 20s and
[1591.20 - 1596.84] 30s and it's going to be the first time
[1594.16 - 1599.00] the first time in history I mean there
[1596.84 - 1600.40] there is some random rare cases of
[1599.00 - 1602.48] already that happening but it's going to
[1600.40 - 1605.28] be a wave of hitting people in their 20s
[1602.48 - 1607.32] and 30s COPD something that we think
[1605.28 - 1610.92] about for 80y olds who smoked their
[1607.32 - 1613.76] whole life that those days are gone
[1610.92 - 1615.44] those days are gone the 80-year-olds
[1613.76 - 1618.36] that smoked their whole life meaning
[1615.44 - 1621.20] those days about COPD are gone it's not
[1618.36 - 1623.64] also the 58-year-old either you know the
[1621.20 - 1625.72] young 58-year old or the young
[1623.64 - 1628.28] 50-year-old which is you know happening
[1625.72 - 1630.08] all the time with COPD it's moving it's
[1628.28 - 1631.16] going to move into the 30s and 20s
[1630.08 - 1632.84] that's why I'm doing the show I'm doing
[1631.16 - 1634.48] the show for all reasons you know for
[1632.84 - 1636.20] people that are older people that are
[1634.48 - 1638.20] but the people that are younger to come
[1636.20 - 1641.08] so what's going to happen it's always
[1638.20 - 1642.88] going to be blamed on the genetic Factor
[1641.08 - 1644.84] because people are smoking less and less
[1642.88 - 1648.20] and less so we're we're phasing out the
[1644.84 - 1650.44] smoking crowd we're phasing out
[1648.20 - 1651.88] that crowd there's always going to be a
[1650.44 - 1654.00] crowd that also you know they they
[1651.88 - 1656.00] breathe in a lot of smoke they they have
[1654.00 - 1658.12] fireplaces running all time they live in
[1656.00 - 1660.08] certain areas of the world they have you
[1658.12 - 1661.84] know their wood burning stoves but W
[1660.08 - 1663.68] wood burning stoves you know also
[1661.84 - 1665.16] release still a lot of smoke when you
[1663.68 - 1666.68] have to open it throw more wood in it
[1665.16 - 1669.92] and close it there's always the smoke
[1666.68 - 1671.84] Factor going on um if you live near an
[1669.92 - 1673.16] industrial area or an industrial city or
[1671.84 - 1674.88] something like that and you're and
[1673.16 - 1677.88] you're living in that you might be on
[1674.88 - 1680.64] the downdraft some serious you know some
[1677.88 - 1682.04] serious um gases and smoke and toxic
[1680.64 - 1685.08] fumes and stuff like that that can
[1682.04 - 1688.28] happen a lot of that that can be a big
[1685.08 - 1689.76] part of CPD for a lot of people so that
[1688.28 - 1691.16] you got all that going on too you got
[1689.76 - 1693.32] the whole environmental thing and then
[1691.16 - 1696.28] like I talked about in the environmental
[1693.32 - 1698.96] show where in the Agland conventional
[1696.28 - 1701.20] Agland all across the country all over
[1698.96 - 1703.56] the country conventional Agland pick a
[1701.20 - 1705.52] state pick a state and it's it's
[1703.56 - 1707.68] happening there they there's there's
[1705.52 - 1710.68] something called row covers if you've
[1707.68 - 1712.64] gardened and you buy a row cover if you
[1710.68 - 1715.96] ever garden and buy a row cover row
[1712.64 - 1719.48] cover goes you know on your garden bed
[1715.96 - 1721.84] and your plants can grow up through it
[1719.48 - 1723.16] so you know you get a hole in there and
[1721.84 - 1726.68] the area and the plant grows through it
[1723.16 - 1729.72] keeps the weeds down well row covers are
[1726.68 - 1732.72] used in conventional Agriculture and and
[1729.72 - 1734.88] and and not when you see conventional
[1732.72 - 1736.84] agricultural um photos and everything
[1734.88 - 1738.96] like that you won't see the row covers
[1736.84 - 1741.48] but they're there in conventional
[1738.96 - 1743.68] growing they're there I noticed that
[1741.48 - 1745.76] they you usually see the field when it's
[1743.68 - 1747.32] all green and you know all the different
[1745.76 - 1749.36] cabbage heads are sticking out you know
[1747.32 - 1751.52] as far as like Green Revolution stuff
[1749.36 - 1753.72] and conventional farming and you know
[1751.52 - 1757.20] you see broccoli going miles and miles
[1753.72 - 1758.52] and miles and you you just you you know
[1757.20 - 1760.88] you see it but you don't see any row
[1758.52 - 1763.80] covers you don't see any row covers but
[1760.88 - 1767.56] but they were there they were there and
[1763.80 - 1770.24] most likely removed or um some don't use
[1767.56 - 1773.08] them but for the majority they are used
[1770.24 - 1775.36] these row covers and what happens is
[1773.08 - 1778.08] here's what goes on the fields all get
[1775.36 - 1780.36] sprayed with pesticides Mercury Laden
[1778.08 - 1783.96] pesticides copper Coop dangerous copper
[1780.36 - 1785.92] Laden pesticides neuro antagonists All
[1783.96 - 1787.68] chemical neuro antagonist chemicals all
[1785.92 - 1789.12] in the pesticides Dangerous Ones or
[1787.68 - 1791.36] skull and crossbones on all the
[1789.12 - 1794.12] pesticide herbicide rodenticide
[1791.36 - 1796.24] fungicide larvicide um containers so you
[1794.12 - 1798.08] got the skull and crossbones you got the
[1796.24 - 1799.40] it's literally that mean means death if
[1798.08 - 1802.20] you go near that thing and you don't
[1799.40 - 1806.16] have a hazmat suit on and you're loaded
[1802.20 - 1808.04] and you're opening that can you can die
[1806.16 - 1811.36] that's why that's on there like that if
[1808.04 - 1813.40] the can rolled over and dumped the big
[1811.36 - 1815.56] can rolled over and dumped and it hit
[1813.40 - 1817.44] your legs you're dead that's why there's
[1815.56 - 1819.04] a skull and crossbone on there so they
[1817.44 - 1820.52] have to take that dilute it with water
[1819.04 - 1823.60] fill it into all the tractors and the
[1820.52 - 1825.08] big and the big you know um containers
[1823.60 - 1826.44] on the tractors and they got all the
[1825.08 - 1827.88] sprayers in the op you know all the
[1826.44 - 1829.36] hydraulic sprayers and everything and
[1827.88 - 1831.32] they're spraying the fields if they
[1829.36 - 1833.04] don't do it by planes they don't do it
[1831.32 - 1834.68] by planes as much and and they do it
[1833.04 - 1837.28] mostly by
[1834.68 - 1839.20] tractors and all that pesticide is going
[1837.28 - 1840.96] on the row covers it's all going on the
[1839.20 - 1843.08] row saturating the row covers saturating
[1840.96 - 1844.56] the row covers all year long or all
[1843.08 - 1845.76] during that growing period whether it's
[1844.56 - 1846.72] three months or two months or five
[1845.76 - 1847.92] months depending what they're growing
[1846.72 - 1850.56] and what they're
[1847.92 - 1852.20] doing and then they get when they when
[1850.56 - 1854.12] they harvest after they harvest they
[1852.20 - 1856.92] gather all the row covers it's all
[1854.12 - 1861.04] plastic and they pile it up in gigantic
[1856.92 - 1864.40] m s in every state in every part of the
[1861.04 - 1868.64] country and they burn it they throw fuel
[1864.40 - 1872.88] on it and they burn it and this is one
[1868.64 - 1875.60] reason why COPD is worsening at this
[1872.88 - 1878.60] point it's worsening at this point
[1875.60 - 1881.64] because of this reason right here and
[1878.60 - 1883.68] this is like a like an
[1881.64 - 1886.96] unbelievable
[1883.68 - 1890.72] illegal way of doing things but they all
[1886.96 - 1892.92] do do it and it's usually protected by
[1890.72 - 1896.88] hands you know people passing money
[1892.92 - 1900.04] along under the table but it's it's far
[1896.88 - 1902.20] worse than any car pollution it's far
[1900.04 - 1904.24] worse than some of the factories that
[1902.20 - 1905.80] are spewing out crap out of the top of
[1904.24 - 1909.24] those factories and Industrial sections
[1905.80 - 1912.24] of the world it is actually worse it's
[1909.24 - 1913.68] it's these massive plumes of smoke and
[1912.24 - 1916.08] why wouldn't anybody see this because
[1913.68 - 1917.92] it's called the white smoke so it's it's
[1916.08 - 1921.68] just the burning plastic
[1917.92 - 1924.04] and the Plastics are mostly white mostly
[1921.68 - 1926.56] white so it's a white smoke that goes up
[1924.04 - 1929.32] in the air and it just burn and they
[1926.56 - 1931.44] burn it everywhere all over the country
[1929.32 - 1934.20] and what are they doing they're making
[1931.44 - 1935.88] us sick and no one's allowed to go near
[1934.20 - 1937.36] it no meaning no one's allowed to learn
[1935.88 - 1939.60] about it no one's allowed to understand
[1937.36 - 1942.64] it no one's allowed to do anything it's
[1939.60 - 1945.68] a it's it's a practice that it it makes
[1942.64 - 1948.96] the GMO thing look
[1945.68 - 1950.16] ridiculous look ridiculous you couldn't
[1948.96 - 1952.72] even
[1950.16 - 1955.32] imagine and you know and and when they
[1952.72 - 1956.68] it's unbelievable it's unbelievable and
[1955.32 - 1958.48] that's what's happening in the country
[1956.68 - 1959.88] that's actually part of why COPD is on
[1958.48 - 1962.40] the rise so we have to protect ourself
[1959.88 - 1964.60] so we can get around that it's it's why
[1962.40 - 1966.44] asthma's on the rise like never before
[1964.60 - 1968.24] it's part of why asthma is on the rise
[1966.44 - 1970.40] like never before and other lung
[1968.24 - 1973.08] problems are on the rise like never
[1970.40 - 1977.44] before like never
[1973.08 - 1978.88] before so what happens here is that that
[1977.44 - 1981.20] we have these lung problems and
[1978.88 - 1982.64] different reasons why and varieties of
[1981.20 - 1984.24] why if you have a bacterial infection
[1982.64 - 1986.40] that's chronically in the lung which is
[1984.24 - 1988.84] Strep strep can get in the lung all
[1986.40 - 1990.20] these different varieties of strep all
[1988.84 - 1992.16] these different varieties so many
[1990.20 - 1994.08] mutations at this point and we take
[1992.16 - 1995.64] antibiotics and it mutates it more and
[1994.08 - 1997.00] take the antibiotics it mutates it more
[1995.64 - 1998.80] makes the strep stronger stronger
[1997.00 - 2001.32] stronger stronger that could lead to a
[1998.80 - 2003.00] COPD case we can have underlying thing
[2001.32 - 2004.52] is Strep they'll never know they'll
[2003.00 - 2005.72] never they can't tell they can cut a
[2004.52 - 2007.88] piece of your lung out they're still not
[2005.72 - 2009.72] going to find it
[2007.88 - 2012.00] because no one cares so the study and
[2009.72 - 2014.72] the the money is not going there the
[2012.00 - 2016.96] money is going into genes medicine is is
[2014.72 - 2019.52] at a drought point right now it's at a
[2016.96 - 2021.84] drought point that means that anything
[2019.52 - 2024.48] productive in medicine to move people
[2021.84 - 2026.72] forward in chronic illness is dried up
[2024.48 - 2028.92] the Ws are dried up and money can't be
[2026.72 - 2030.40] dumped into anything anymore unless it's
[2028.92 - 2033.12] bogus
[2030.40 - 2037.04] alternative interest groups wanting to
[2033.12 - 2039.16] fund a trendy concept to confuse people
[2037.04 - 2040.64] more and then you know and that that's
[2039.16 - 2042.24] that's that's a different situation
[2040.64 - 2044.92] those aren't drying up they come out all
[2042.24 - 2046.68] the time but in conventional medicine
[2044.92 - 2049.72] the well has dried up it all has to
[2046.68 - 2051.60] funnel to genes so any money involved
[2049.72 - 2053.76] has to go into genetic
[2051.60 - 2055.60] technology cloning and everything else
[2053.76 - 2057.40] and just but you know whatever it has to
[2055.60 - 2060.28] just all be genetic no matter what the
[2057.40 - 2061.72] case or what the direction is and so you
[2060.28 - 2063.08] know there's no money in cutting out a
[2061.72 - 2065.88] piece of lung and figuring out what
[2063.08 - 2069.00] bacteria teria is what's causing the
[2065.88 - 2070.52] problem or in a case of viruses there a
[2069.00 - 2072.64] lot of different herpetic viruses they
[2070.52 - 2074.08] get also into the lung area through the
[2072.64 - 2076.20] lymphatic system so there's a lot of
[2074.08 - 2077.84] Epstein bars different varieties of
[2076.20 - 2079.08] Epstein bar not everybody with Epstein
[2077.84 - 2080.44] bar is going to have one thing or
[2079.08 - 2081.52] another just so you know a lot of people
[2080.44 - 2083.00] with Epstein bar they'll have chronic
[2081.52 - 2085.00] fatigue a lot of they'll have Hashimoto
[2083.00 - 2086.68] thyroiditis they'll have ra there's
[2085.00 - 2088.28] different varieties of Epstein bar
[2086.68 - 2090.32] something that medical science research
[2088.28 - 2091.48] has no idea about whatsoever until I
[2090.32 - 2094.56] came out with the information there's
[2091.48 - 2097.44] over 60 varieties of Epstein bar and
[2094.56 - 2099.44] so and there will be more varieties as
[2097.44 - 2101.72] they mutate and they grow so move
[2099.44 - 2103.72] forward so anyway the bottom line is I
[2101.72 - 2106.92] say so a lot sorry about that the bottom
[2103.72 - 2109.00] line is that we get we can get a viral
[2106.92 - 2110.64] infection inside the lymphatic system it
[2109.00 - 2112.04] comes out of the liver the viruses sit
[2110.64 - 2114.12] inside the liver so your Epstein bar
[2112.04 - 2115.96] will sit inside your liver hhv6 will sit
[2114.12 - 2120.44] inside the liver
[2115.96 - 2124.12] hhv7 hhv7 um undiscovered hhv1
[2120.44 - 2128.80] undiscovered hhv1 undiscovered hhv 12 13
[2124.12 - 2128.80] 14 undiscovered hhv 15 undiscovered
[2130.00 - 2134.76] hh16 and and their subgroups meaning
[2133.52 - 2136.76] their
[2134.76 - 2139.44] mutations so what happens is these
[2136.76 - 2141.68] viruses sit inside people's livers they
[2139.44 - 2143.28] move into the lymphatic system over time
[2141.68 - 2144.60] over the years it's different kindes of
[2143.28 - 2147.88] types of herpetic
[2144.60 - 2149.20] viruses they create mucus in the
[2147.88 - 2151.96] lymphatic
[2149.20 - 2154.32] system and when they create mucus and a
[2151.96 - 2157.68] backlog of mucus
[2154.32 - 2159.84] continuously it causes oxygen problems
[2157.68 - 2161.52] meaning the whole thing with oxygen
[2159.84 - 2163.20] switching off with carbon dioxide just
[2161.52 - 2165.64] to get the oxygen and carbon dioxide
[2163.20 - 2167.08] Exchange in the lung in the lung tissue
[2165.64 - 2170.48] in the lung sack so you got the oxygen
[2167.08 - 2172.84] carbon dioxide exchange it it it creates
[2170.48 - 2175.00] mucus mucus gets in the way of that
[2172.84 - 2176.60] exchange so then you get this these
[2175.00 - 2179.32] viral these
[2176.60 - 2182.68] viruses that produce a lot of Gunk and
[2179.32 - 2184.28] junk and byproduct not necessarily
[2182.68 - 2186.48] neurotoxins because there's different
[2184.28 - 2188.16] varieties of viruses you got the hh10
[2186.48 - 2189.72] like said you got different ones and you
[2188.16 - 2193.12] got H6
[2189.72 - 2195.12] and and so what happens is and some of
[2193.12 - 2197.00] these people with COPD now they do have
[2195.12 - 2198.40] neurotoxic symptoms too that I always
[2197.00 - 2199.28] talk about from Epstein bars and
[2198.40 - 2200.76] everything else so they're getting
[2199.28 - 2202.84] multiple symptoms they got the
[2200.76 - 2204.28] neuropathy they got the neuralgia
[2202.84 - 2206.92] neuropathy they got different things
[2204.28 - 2209.60] going on they got fibromyalgia and they
[2206.92 - 2212.00] got COPD they got aches and pain so it
[2209.60 - 2215.00] it all does come out in the
[2212.00 - 2216.28] end but the whole point is you got this
[2215.00 - 2217.48] viral stuff that's never going to get
[2216.28 - 2219.48] researched
[2217.48 - 2221.64] ever and then you got the bacterial
[2219.48 - 2225.40] stuff like the strep strep aacle and
[2221.64 - 2226.64] strep cacus and you got that going on so
[2225.40 - 2229.16] the streps and the different kinds of
[2226.64 - 2230.84] streps sit in the lungs itself and sit
[2229.16 - 2233.40] in the lung sacks when they sit in the
[2230.84 - 2236.56] lung sacks they're they're they're
[2233.40 - 2239.76] actually creating the lung
[2236.56 - 2242.60] damage and then and then also Epstein
[2239.76 - 2244.16] bars tend to also get into lungs too
[2242.60 - 2246.28] they leave the lymphatic vessels and
[2244.16 - 2247.84] they they get up into the lungs they
[2246.28 - 2249.96] create lung
[2247.84 - 2251.44] scarring you know the scars and lungs
[2249.96 - 2253.72] and create little cysts and little
[2251.44 - 2255.32] pockets and little scars and they do
[2253.72 - 2256.48] lung scarring it's all a mystery to
[2255.32 - 2257.96] research and science they don't know how
[2256.48 - 2260.00] all that scarring happens they don't
[2257.96 - 2261.56] know how all the lung cysts happen
[2260.00 - 2262.56] happen you know the non-cancerous ones
[2261.56 - 2263.92] and everything else they don't even know
[2262.56 - 2268.08] how the cancerous ones happen but it's
[2263.92 - 2269.68] like and and what happens is that you
[2268.08 - 2272.92] know all this is from viral and
[2269.68 - 2276.32] bacterial stuff so when you're when
[2272.92 - 2278.68] you're breathing in these white plumes
[2276.32 - 2280.64] of smoke environmentally that are in
[2278.68 - 2282.24] just are they're everywhere and no one
[2280.64 - 2284.08] knows about it no one knows about it
[2282.24 - 2286.68] it's just blowing
[2284.08 - 2288.92] around that can trick because there's
[2286.68 - 2291.12] pesticides in that white plume of smoke
[2288.92 - 2293.60] coming off those rad covers all those
[2291.12 - 2295.32] skull and bone pesticides I was talking
[2293.60 - 2297.04] about that are saturated on the rad
[2295.32 - 2299.28] cover so when they burn them they're
[2297.04 - 2303.08] they're creating new
[2299.28 - 2305.28] chemicals new chemicals through burning
[2303.08 - 2307.52] those pesticides on the
[2305.28 - 2308.72] Plastics and when you breathe that in
[2307.52 - 2311.12] and you got the
[2308.72 - 2312.56] viruses and you got the lymphatic mucus
[2311.12 - 2314.44] and everything else it just it just
[2312.56 - 2316.84] feeds it those chemicals feed it because
[2314.44 - 2318.56] you breathe it in and it's going into
[2316.84 - 2320.12] the lung just like somebody smoking a
[2318.56 - 2323.80] cigarette going into the lung and then
[2320.12 - 2326.52] feeding any kind of bacteria virus or
[2323.80 - 2328.84] pathogen and then more more Scar Tissue
[2326.52 - 2331.60] occurs more lung sack
[2328.84 - 2334.28] damage and then not only that mucus lots
[2331.60 - 2335.00] of mucus forming everywhere then take
[2334.28 - 2337.56] the
[2335.00 - 2341.48] foods people want eat dairy they want to
[2337.56 - 2345.40] eat cheese the new longevity food
[2341.48 - 2348.24] cheese it's a new longevity food sure
[2345.40 - 2350.32] yeah I'll buy into that one cheese feeds
[2348.24 - 2353.12] every virus and pathogen in the
[2350.32 - 2355.88] book and this is the bottom line I don't
[2353.12 - 2357.48] care how you know how it was raised how
[2355.88 - 2360.12] the animal was raised or anything like
[2357.48 - 2363.24] that or harvest it the che I mean the I
[2360.12 - 2365.76] don't I don't care how everything was
[2363.24 - 2367.48] done but the bottom line is so you got
[2365.76 - 2369.64] the cheese you got the milk you got the
[2367.48 - 2372.24] dairy you got all that you can't do that
[2369.64 - 2374.16] with COPD so one thing you have to do I
[2372.24 - 2375.76] would even go plant-based with COPD I
[2374.16 - 2377.12] wouldn't even do an animal protein
[2375.76 - 2379.36] because when it comes down to your lungs
[2377.12 - 2381.12] you don't want to mess around you just
[2379.36 - 2382.96] don't want to mess around it's a lot of
[2381.12 - 2384.36] people that will they'll give up a
[2382.96 - 2387.04] certain thing they'll give up they'll
[2384.36 - 2390.28] give up something they'll give up
[2387.04 - 2392.64] something but there are people now with
[2390.28 - 2394.96] COPD because it's a new generation of
[2392.64 - 2396.68] COPD it's a new generation it's a
[2394.96 - 2398.96] younger generation and they tend to give
[2396.68 - 2402.00] up more in the older days remember in
[2398.96 - 2404.48] the 80s and the 90s early 2000s in the
[2402.00 - 2407.44] older days people with COPD they they
[2404.48 - 2411.04] you know the chain smokers and really
[2407.44 - 2414.20] old and all that was going on and they
[2411.04 - 2416.72] would smoke to the end it would smoke to
[2414.20 - 2419.48] the end even with COPD it doesn't matter
[2416.72 - 2422.24] you have an oxygen tank at the same time
[2419.48 - 2424.12] you're smoking while on oxygen that was
[2422.24 - 2425.96] that that's that's how it was done
[2424.12 - 2427.88] that's how it was done now we got a lot
[2425.96 - 2429.24] of younger people now and the world's
[2427.88 - 2431.68] Chang a little bit better for the all
[2429.24 - 2432.68] kinds of reasons and you know and and
[2431.68 - 2434.00] younger people are like well I'm going
[2432.68 - 2436.16] to quit smoking so they do throw their
[2434.00 - 2438.40] cigarettes away and then you got the
[2436.16 - 2441.00] young people that are told it's
[2438.40 - 2442.56] jeans because they don't know anything I
[2441.00 - 2444.04] just described to you just earlier about
[2442.56 - 2446.96] COPD so they don't know anything about
[2444.04 - 2450.40] it so they so they just throw the Jean
[2446.96 - 2452.40] thing at you and those people they tend
[2450.40 - 2453.68] to they tend to you know they they will
[2452.40 - 2456.92] change something if you tell them to
[2453.68 - 2458.88] change something they will eat better
[2456.92 - 2463.00] I with COPD I wouldn't even mess around
[2458.88 - 2465.28] I would go 100% plant-based 100%
[2463.00 - 2469.68] plantbased is what I would
[2465.28 - 2471.68] do even if it means you're high fat
[2469.68 - 2473.64] plant-based even if it means you're
[2471.68 - 2477.88] eating too many avocados too many nuts
[2473.64 - 2479.96] and seeds too many oils you're eating
[2477.88 - 2482.88] you're eating you know even if it
[2479.96 - 2484.88] means you're eating something you know
[2482.88 - 2487.08] you're eating quinoa even if it means
[2484.88 - 2488.68] you're eating quinoa even if it means
[2487.08 - 2491.08] you know which is actually isn't the
[2488.68 - 2492.16] worst grain at all and somebody out
[2491.08 - 2494.52] there is going to say oh it's not a
[2492.16 - 2498.20] grain it's a seed everything's a
[2494.52 - 2500.48] seed so here's the thing so here's the
[2498.20 - 2503.68] here's the deal here's the
[2500.48 - 2506.20] deal um everything's a seed even if it
[2503.68 - 2508.04] won't grow even if a seed won't grow
[2506.20 - 2509.52] it's a seed even if it won't grow just
[2508.04 - 2511.72] so you know don't get that confused that
[2509.52 - 2514.92] was something that's been going
[2511.72 - 2516.60] around but um quinoa like even if it's
[2514.92 - 2517.88] quinoa even if it's millet even if
[2516.60 - 2520.28] you're eating Millet every day and
[2517.88 - 2521.80] oatmeal every day you're better off
[2520.28 - 2524.00] doing that than eating an animal product
[2521.80 - 2525.88] with COPD I'm not trying to rip down the
[2524.00 - 2527.84] Animal product world or ripped down I
[2525.88 - 2529.08] know many of you you're doing animal
[2527.84 - 2530.00] proteins that's not what it's about if
[2529.08 - 2532.04] you have
[2530.00 - 2534.56] COPD you just want to get rid of the
[2532.04 - 2537.68] animal proteins way too heavy on the
[2534.56 - 2540.28] liver way too heavy on the
[2537.68 - 2541.84] liver because the more bog down the
[2540.28 - 2543.40] liver is the more lymphatic system is
[2541.84 - 2545.00] going to get bogged down the more mucus
[2543.40 - 2546.68] is going to be caused the more mucus is
[2545.00 - 2548.16] going to form and go up through the lmag
[2546.68 - 2550.64] system push up into the lungs and it's
[2548.16 - 2552.60] just not going to help that's one reason
[2550.64 - 2554.64] the other reason is the more animal
[2552.60 - 2555.88] products you eat I'm just saying like
[2554.64 - 2560.08] meat
[2555.88 - 2562.92] chicken even fish turkey whatever the
[2560.08 - 2564.28] more you eat of that or pork the less
[2562.92 - 2565.60] room you have for the foods that we're
[2564.28 - 2568.16] going to talk about next that restore
[2565.60 - 2571.92] lung sacks here's here's how it works
[2568.16 - 2574.36] here's how it works um you know I'm not
[2571.92 - 2575.68] on anybody's side with the food diets
[2574.36 - 2579.88] but I'm going to tell you what happens
[2575.68 - 2582.84] here with animal protein it doesn't fix
[2579.88 - 2585.76] things it doesn't hurt things in many
[2582.84 - 2588.76] ways and some ways it does but it
[2585.76 - 2590.88] doesn't fix things just so you know
[2588.76 - 2593.28] what's fixing anything is everything
[2590.88 - 2595.08] else you're eating so when you got all
[2593.28 - 2596.28] these different autoimmune diets and
[2595.08 - 2599.32] they're all filled with animal protein
[2596.28 - 2601.56] and everything else what's helping the
[2599.32 - 2603.88] person what's helping them at all is
[2601.56 - 2606.60] they got rid of all the garbage number
[2603.88 - 2609.76] one number two if they're making room
[2606.60 - 2611.08] for a green juice they're making room if
[2609.76 - 2613.08] you know they got rid of so much garbage
[2611.08 - 2614.36] that they have room for a smoothie even
[2613.08 - 2616.04] if it's not the right kind of smoothie
[2614.36 - 2618.60] they got room for a green juice they got
[2616.04 - 2620.88] room for more cucumbers they got room
[2618.60 - 2623.48] for salads green salads they got room
[2620.88 - 2626.36] for these things those are the things
[2623.48 - 2627.52] that heal damaged lungs I'm not saying I
[2626.36 - 2629.08] have something against the animal
[2627.52 - 2631.16] protein for you if you're really sold on
[2629.08 - 2634.68] it I'm just saying I would get rid of it
[2631.16 - 2637.00] 100% one if that if if it was me I would
[2634.68 - 2639.84] get rid of it 100%
[2637.00 - 2641.36] gone gone if I had if I was somebody
[2639.84 - 2643.76] eating animal protein with
[2641.36 - 2644.96] COPD because you know what it is when
[2643.76 - 2647.88] you're take you got to take your lung
[2644.96 - 2651.04] serious you need every antioxidant every
[2647.88 - 2652.96] antioxidant you can possibly get in any
[2651.04 - 2656.24] way shape or
[2652.96 - 2658.60] form anthocyanins undiscovered
[2656.24 - 2662.60] antioxidants there's hundreds and
[2658.60 - 2664.92] hundreds of undiscovered antioxidants in
[2662.60 - 2667.96] foods that aren't animal products that
[2664.92 - 2671.08] you need to restore your lungs you need
[2667.96 - 2673.76] melons to restore your lungs you need
[2671.08 - 2676.48] melons you need papaya to store your L
[2673.76 - 2678.04] restore your lungs foods are critical
[2676.48 - 2679.72] you need berries you need wild
[2678.04 - 2682.48] blueberries to restore your lungs if
[2679.72 - 2684.24] you're busy eating an egg breakfast or
[2682.48 - 2686.60] you're busy having a turkey sausage
[2684.24 - 2688.68] breakfast healthy turkey
[2686.60 - 2690.76] sausage and you don't have your wild
[2688.68 - 2693.52] blueberries you just lost an opportunity
[2690.76 - 2695.68] to restore your lungs just lost an
[2693.52 - 2698.00] opportunity to restore your lungs plus
[2695.68 - 2700.68] it's just too it's too much high fat on
[2698.00 - 2701.92] top of it way too much high fat and that
[2700.68 - 2704.32] doesn't help your lungs either because
[2701.92 - 2706.00] it burdens down your liver here's the
[2704.32 - 2707.64] thing the higher fat that's in your
[2706.00 - 2709.96] bloodstream so if you're going to do all
[2707.64 - 2712.72] animal products when you have
[2709.96 - 2714.48] COPD when you do high fat which is
[2712.72 - 2716.76] animal products if you do really high
[2714.48 - 2718.04] fat and if you're vegan or vegetarian
[2716.76 - 2720.32] you can do high fat too if you're
[2718.04 - 2721.96] vegetarian you could have tons of oils
[2720.32 - 2723.56] you I've known vegetarians they dumping
[2721.96 - 2724.92] all the sesame oil they're just C
[2723.56 - 2727.20] they're cooking their vegetarian dish
[2724.92 - 2730.96] and they dump a whole you you know like
[2727.20 - 2732.84] ounces of sesame oil in there and it's
[2730.96 - 2734.92] filled with sesame oil and they got they
[2732.84 - 2736.72] got lots of tofu in there which is which
[2734.92 - 2738.96] has a lot of fat in tofu there's a lot
[2736.72 - 2740.72] there's a high volume of fat soy oil in
[2738.96 - 2743.88] there soybean oil in there so they got
[2740.72 - 2746.40] that and then you know with with all
[2743.88 - 2748.16] that with all that they even have you
[2746.40 - 2750.12] know they even have dairy they even have
[2748.16 - 2753.08] they throw goats milk in there and they
[2750.12 - 2755.68] throw whatever and so just a large
[2753.08 - 2756.92] amount of fat and that's not good so
[2755.68 - 2758.92] when you're talking about animal protein
[2756.92 - 2760.56] eaters too meaning just we're all big in
[2758.92 - 2761.92] animal protein so much fat what happens
[2760.56 - 2763.52] is it gets rid of your oxygen in your
[2761.92 - 2766.64] blood what I'm saying is it minimizes
[2763.52 - 2768.92] your blood oxygen the whole
[2766.64 - 2770.52] point is keeping that oxygen getting
[2768.92 - 2771.76] into your blood and having that carbon
[2770.52 - 2774.72] dioxide
[2771.76 - 2776.48] transfer that's the whole point so when
[2774.72 - 2779.68] your diet is high in fat you can't do
[2776.48 - 2782.28] that anymore you're losing oxygen so you
[2779.68 - 2784.28] go plant-based 100% even if it's higher
[2782.28 - 2786.00] fat plant-based it's still it'll still
[2784.28 - 2789.08] give you more oxygen in the bloodstream
[2786.00 - 2793.36] plant-based 100% And you need room for
[2789.08 - 2797.08] the right Foods you need room for
[2793.36 - 2798.60] peppermint tea ginger tea garlic onions
[2797.08 - 2800.44] you need room to be hydrated with a
[2798.60 - 2802.24] little coconut water you need room to be
[2800.44 - 2805.20] hydrated with lemon water you need the
[2802.24 - 2807.48] melons the berries you need lots of
[2805.20 - 2809.20] apples you need the papaya you need the
[2807.48 - 2811.56] mangoes to help with the the the
[2809.20 - 2814.16] keratinoid to help restore the lung
[2811.56 - 2816.20] tissue the antioxidants the amount of
[2814.16 - 2818.96] beta carotene carotenoids and anti an
[2816.20 - 2821.44] oxidants all of that and the pigments in
[2818.96 - 2822.84] there that are loaded with antioxidants
[2821.44 - 2824.28] that they don't even study yet because
[2822.84 - 2825.24] you can't break them down they're not
[2824.28 - 2826.80] they're it's not something you can
[2825.24 - 2828.44] separate and break down easy you need a
[2826.80 - 2831.16] lot of money and a lot of science and
[2828.44 - 2834.04] research and a lot of real honest
[2831.16 - 2835.72] hardworking people trying to figure out
[2834.04 - 2837.84] what's inside these things it's really
[2835.72 - 2839.24] difficult you need the celery juice cuz
[2837.84 - 2840.92] the mineral salts are critical to
[2839.24 - 2842.48] restoring the lungs and knock down
[2840.92 - 2844.80] viruses and bacteria you need the
[2842.48 - 2846.60] cucumbers lots of cucumber juice when
[2844.80 - 2847.96] somebody with COPD they on cucumber
[2846.60 - 2849.80] juice if you're sitting there eating an
[2847.96 - 2851.24] egg and sausage breakfast you're not
[2849.80 - 2852.72] going to get the cucumber juice in you
[2851.24 - 2854.20] there's no way and if you do do a
[2852.72 - 2855.64] cucumber juice after having an egg and
[2854.20 - 2858.04] sausage breakfast what's going to happen
[2855.64 - 2860.64] is it's not going to help as
[2858.04 - 2862.64] much so you want to go 100% plant-based
[2860.64 - 2863.80] if it's too hard for you with COPD I
[2862.64 - 2866.32] understand completely then keep your
[2863.80 - 2867.96] animal products to one a day and start
[2866.32 - 2870.04] bringing in some avocado to try to
[2867.96 - 2872.12] offset it try to do some different
[2870.04 - 2873.72] things I'd rather have you on quinoa I'd
[2872.12 - 2876.84] rather have you on Millet I'd rather
[2873.72 - 2879.28] have you on oatmeal I'd rather have you
[2876.84 - 2882.40] on things if it means it gets you kind
[2879.28 - 2884.92] of off more of the animal products with
[2882.40 - 2886.32] COPD it's just one of those it's one of
[2884.92 - 2888.16] those illnesses it's one of those
[2886.32 - 2890.36] diseases illnesses dysfunctions
[2888.16 - 2892.04] disorders it's one of those where you
[2890.36 - 2894.84] have to have your blood fat a little bit
[2892.04 - 2896.48] lower or a lot lower so oxygen really
[2894.84 - 2898.80] gets into the bloodstream helps you heal
[2896.48 - 2901.04] on all kinds of levels it's a big deal
[2898.80 - 2904.12] I've been able to reverse COPD in so
[2901.04 - 2906.12] many people and very easily and there's
[2904.12 - 2907.60] different stages of COPD depends on what
[2906.12 - 2908.88] stage somebody's in too you want to
[2907.60 - 2910.48] catch it earlier you don't want to be in
[2908.88 - 2913.40] stage four but you can still keep
[2910.48 - 2915.24] somebody in stage four alive and going
[2913.40 - 2917.72] if you do the right things so you can
[2915.24 - 2920.64] keep somebody in stage four here on the
[2917.72 - 2922.84] planet alive and that's what you want to
[2920.64 - 2925.04] do here's here's here's something that's
[2922.84 - 2927.00] really good spirits always us used for
[2925.04 - 2929.64] people with COPD to help them is chop up
[2927.00 - 2931.20] fresh Rosemary you chop up fresh
[2929.64 - 2934.68] Rosemary throw it in your salads you

[2940.08 - 2944.32] throw it in the salad time tea you start
[2942.76 - 2945.88] drinking the time tea that I have on the
[2944.32 - 2948.84] blog and in the books that's really good
[2945.88 - 2950.64] for COPD time tea kills the strep that's
[2948.84 - 2953.20] in a lot of people's lungs that cause
[2950.64 - 2954.76] COPD the younger people all have strep
[2953.20 - 2956.48] in their lungs the people that are
[2954.76 - 2958.56] getting COPD and Asthma and they don't
[2956.48 - 2960.80] get diagnosed with COPD yet because
[2958.56 - 2963.76] they're just they're just told they have
[2960.80 - 2965.84] asthma at the beginning those people in
[2963.76 - 2968.44] their 20s that's that's strep in inside
[2965.84 - 2970.08] the lungs do the time tea vitamin C lots
[2968.44 - 2972.40] of vitamin C I would be doing a whole
[2970.08 - 2974.64] bunch of vitamin C every single day 3
[2972.40 - 2977.24] 4,000 milligrams every single day 5,000
[2974.64 - 2979.40] milligrams if you can coenzyme Q10
[2977.24 - 2981.28] really good for restoring the lungs ala
[2979.40 - 2983.56] that's alphal opic acid good to restore
[2981.28 - 2985.12] the lungs netal cysteine that's good to
[2983.56 - 2986.52] restore the lungs talk to your doctor if
[2985.12 - 2987.96] you're on any medication if you're going
[2986.52 - 2989.00] to do any of this stuff and interact
[2987.96 - 2990.32] with them make sure you talk to your
[2989.00 - 2994.32] doctor

[2999.96 - 3004.16] directory and get the right kinds of
[3001.40 - 3006.88] things don't get the wrong things people

[3006.88 - 3010.76] heal and they don't know why you got to
[3008.48 - 3014.44] get the right thing go to the directory
[3010.76 - 3016.56] the um Mullen Leaf that's a great one
[3014.44 - 3018.28] you get a Mullen Leaf tincture I got one
[3016.56 - 3020.16] on the directory you just use it you

[3032.88 - 3036.96] in liquid form but nettle leaf tea very
[3035.24 - 3038.60] important peppermint tea every single
[3036.96 - 3040.28] day you got to do if you're somebody
[3038.60 - 3041.52] sensitive to garlic and onions then just
[3040.28 - 3043.32] you know don't use them but if you're
[3041.52 - 3045.84] not sensitive you do garlic and onions
[3043.32 - 3047.92] it helps move the mucus around so that
[3045.84 - 3050.48] the exchange of carbon dioxide and
[3047.92 - 3051.88] oxygen occur hydration is important like
[3050.48 - 3053.72] I said before you got the coconut water
[3051.88 - 3055.16] you got the lemon water you got you know
[3053.72 - 3056.88] and and that's why I like melons it's
[3055.16 - 3059.84] really good that's a good one for people
[3056.88 - 3061.56] celery juice incredible for C COPD what
[3059.84 - 3063.20] kind of foods can you like you can eat

[3067.00 - 3070.88] swash all the different squashes you can
[3068.96 - 3073.40] get all that is if you're living off of
[3070.88 - 3075.92] butternut squash every single day your
[3073.40 - 3077.52] your COPD will improve believe it or not
[3075.92 - 3079.72] if you got your celery juices and you're
[3077.52 - 3082.28] living off of butternut squash and sweet
[3079.72 - 3083.68] potatoes your COPD will improve you take
[3082.28 - 3085.84] the Animal product products down because
[3083.68 - 3088.16] you want the fat down low even if you
[3085.84 - 3088.88] did avocados in between at all your COPD
[3088.16 - 3090.92] will
[3088.88 - 3092.84] improve so you want to have the right
[3090.92 - 3094.40] Foods if you have to move to grains you
[3092.84 - 3096.52] do the like I said the quinoa and the
[3094.40 - 3098.40] Millet and the oatmeal if it's too hard
[3096.52 - 3099.88] to do all this you go into hummus just
[3098.40 - 3101.08] do a little hummus if you feel like you
[3099.88 - 3103.76] can hack a little bit of hummus
[3101.08 - 3105.76] chickpeas garbanzo bean hummus you know
[3103.76 - 3107.84] there's even low there's no fat garbanzo
[3105.76 - 3109.80] bean hummuses out there and there's
[3107.84 - 3111.24] lowfat you know hummuses out there you
[3109.80 - 3112.48] can use those you can make your own
[3111.24 - 3114.08] where you only put a little bit of
[3112.48 - 3115.96] tahini in there or something like that
[3114.08 - 3119.00] or a little bit of olive oil oil in
[3115.96 - 3121.28] inside there or you can make a hemp seed
[3119.00 - 3122.88] chickpea hemp seed garbanza meat bean
[3121.28 - 3124.52] hummus where you take garbanza beans you
[3122.88 - 3127.24] throw it in the blender and you throw
[3124.52 - 3129.00] some hem seeds in there now I know you
[3127.24 - 3130.24] know I know you don't have to look if
[3129.00 - 3131.56] you're somebody who wants to go plant
[3130.24 - 3133.40] Bas you do want to do that you don't
[3131.56 - 3135.64] have to have hummus you could just go
[3133.40 - 3137.56] you can go potatoes potatoes are even
[3135.64 - 3139.20] amazing for somebody with COPD you do
[3137.56 - 3140.76] the celery juices in the morning you do
[3139.20 - 3142.52] the fruit smoothies maybe even the heavy
[3140.76 - 3145.36] metal detox then you move on to lunch
[3142.52 - 3147.36] you have potatoes for lunch with a salad
[3145.36 - 3149.36] you have some Yukon Golds you have some
[3147.36 - 3152.00] red potatoes you have some rusted you
[3149.36 - 3154.28] have some um you know uh some purple
[3152.00 - 3155.96] potatoes steam them up throw them on top
[3154.28 - 3158.60] of your salad for lunch in the afternoon
[3155.96 - 3160.20] you eat some apples after that you you
[3158.60 - 3161.96] know you have another celery juice or a
[3160.20 - 3163.96] cucumber juice it would even be good
[3161.96 - 3165.72] cucumber juice maybe some coconut water
[3163.96 - 3168.00] the end of the night have another salad
[3165.72 - 3169.96] maybe throw in two one two avocados on
[3168.00 - 3171.44] top of your salad maybe have some
[3169.96 - 3173.64] butternut squash on there maybe have
[3171.44 - 3176.32] something like that you can do that you
[3173.64 - 3178.60] can do that and be 100% %
[3176.32 - 3180.84] plant-based and while you're plant-based
[3178.60 - 3182.36] like that you'll get higher oxygen
[3180.84 - 3183.48] levels in your blood because your fats
[3182.36 - 3186.40] will be
[3183.48 - 3189.16] lower and then you'll be able to start
[3186.40 - 3190.44] getting your life back eventually even
[3189.16 - 3191.72] doctors end up taking you off of
[3190.44 - 3193.24] medications when you start getting
[3191.72 - 3196.04] better if you're stage one stage two
[3193.24 - 3197.48] stage three uh COPD if you're stage four
[3196.04 - 3199.44] depending on what's going on and all
[3197.48 - 3201.76] that you're up against and and
[3199.44 - 3203.84] everything else it could at least keep
[3201.76 - 3205.32] you there and maybe even reverse it a
[3203.84 - 3206.88] little bit I have reversed stage four
[3205.32 - 3208.36] COPD and a lot of people where they've
[3206.88 - 3210.28] moved them to Stage you know I moved
[3208.36 - 3212.48] them to stage three moved them to stage
[3210.28 - 3213.96] two so you know yeah and you go to your
[3212.48 - 3216.48] practitioner you say I want to do all
