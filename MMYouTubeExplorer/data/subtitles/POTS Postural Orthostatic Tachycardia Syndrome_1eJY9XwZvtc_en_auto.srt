1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:05,580
I'm reading out a brain saver about pots

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,680
a lot of people live with pots now the

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,960
detailed information is so comprehensive

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,099
inside brain saver it's mind-blowing so

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,799
I'm going to read a little bit to you

6
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:16,560
right now people living with pots really

7
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:18,960
struggle the unpredictability of pots

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,539
symptoms can be maddening for many in

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,060
most cases of pots it takes months to

10
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:26,160
years of Doctor shopping to get

11
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,539
validation for their symptoms and that's

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,699
what I see out there all the time with

13
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:32,579
pots all these years it takes doctor

14
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:34,980
after doctor after doctor to finally get

15
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:37,620
some doctor some professionals say I

16
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:41,219
think you have pots ma'am

17
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:43,379
because of these symptoms is byproducts

18
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:45,239
and toxins built up in a stagnant

19
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:46,739
sluggish liver being released and

20
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:49,559
collecting around heart valves so check

21
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:52,980
this out so in a stagnant sluggish liver

22
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:55,140
right here all these toxins build up and

23
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:57,539
then they finally get released out of

24
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:00,260
the liver and then they collect around

25
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,260
the heart

26
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,739
pot symptoms go Way Beyond problems with

27
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:06,240
getting up or leaning forward so it's

28
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:09,600
not just about oh let me get up here

29
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,939
whoa whoa let me lean forward it's more

30
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,400
than that or leaning down because pots

31
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:16,200
is a viral

32
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:18,720
neurotoxin Disorder so I'm talking about

33
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,420
viral neurotoxins creamy pots in the

34
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,759
brain saver books right now right one

35
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,040
reason pots is so difficult is that it's

36
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,200
a chronic viral infection in pots the

37
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:31,020
Epstein-Barr virus has been in the liver

38
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:34,140
for a long time so anybody with pots

39
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:36,479
anybody with pot symptoms they have the

40
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:39,299
Epstein-Barr virus sitting inside their

41
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,460
liver not for a short amount of time in

42
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:45,000
their life not for a month but more than

43
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:46,860
a year in fact years years in pots the

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,200
Epstein-Barr virus sits in the liver for

45
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:51,600
years and collects neurotoxins that

46
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,880
cause pot symptoms ranging from the

47
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,340
dizziness people go through right and

48
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,899
then the difficulty with exercising and

49
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,939
that's one of the reasons why they get

50
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:02,700
the diagnosis of pots because they say

51
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:05,040
the doctor oh I can't exercise because I

52
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,560
get dizzy I get lightheadedness I faint

53
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,899
I get fatigue I get the brain fog nausea

54
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,360
chest pain the blurred vision the racing

55
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:14,480
heart unstable blood pressure when the

56
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,220
liver is stagnant and sluggish

57
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,400
overburdened and filled with years worth

58
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:22,260
of viral toxins various areas of the

59
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,900
liver become blocked that's a whole

60
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:28,500
nother problem with pots

61
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:30,480
areas of the VIS the liver actually get

62
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,340
blocked so you might get a blocked

63
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,440
section of the liver that means the

64
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:38,040
blood vessels inside the liver tissue

65
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:40,020
get clogged up with byproduct from the

66
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,540
Epstein-Barr virus

67
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:45,000
this makes it harder for blood to get

68
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:47,160
drawn through the liver to get to the

69
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,260
heart putting the heart under a

70
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,660
continual strain so here it goes your

71
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:54,720
heart is trying to pump all the blood

72
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:57,000
from your liver up into it but when the

73
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,560
liver is stagnant sluggish and blocked

74
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,200
in certain areas and that's the whole

75
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,780
thing with pots and people have pots the

76
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,879
liver is blocked in certain areas so

77
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:09,239
then when the heart is sitting here

78
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:12,840
trying to pump and pump and pump it

79
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:15,480
can't do its job it's struggling and

80
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,640
this brings us into pot symptoms right

81
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,800
pot symptoms so here you got your liver

82
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,659
it's blocked in certain areas

83
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,060
and here's your heart and it's pumping

84
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:26,819
it's pumping away like this right

85
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:29,400
but it's pumping harder people with pots

86
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:31,860
can feel their heart beat sometimes

87
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,599
pulsing through their like neck through

88
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:36,480
their ear through the side of their face

89
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,580
their forehead in their throat somewhere

90
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,560
or in their chest more or when they're

91
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:42,360
laying down in bed people that are on

92
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,920
mattress Island they've been laying

93
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,780
there for a long time for a lot of hours

94
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,940
during the day or on the couch Island

95
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,440
because they're not well you can feel

96
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:51,720
the heart and then you're telling your

97
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,640
doctor well I feel like my heart doing

98
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,680
something or I feel heart pressure and

99
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:59,700
what happens is that's the heart working

100
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:02,459
hard trying to get blood up through a

101
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:04,860
stagnant liver when certain areas of the

102
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:07,799
stagnant liver are blocked blood vessels

103
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:10,980
are blocked to a degree with neurotoxins

104
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:13,140
and toxins from the Epstein for our

105
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:14,879
virus so we're reading the pots we're

106
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:17,280
right here in brain saver books you guys

107
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,139
order them when you get a chance you

108
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,019
will be surprised when you start reading

109
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:23,840
these really eye-opening

110
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:26,400
so we'll go into this a little bit more

111
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,500
viral neurotoxins are also floating

112
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,000
around so here's another thing so many

113
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,759
people who are pots they have these

114
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,100
viral neurotoxins floating around

115
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:38,100
saturating and inflaming the vagus

116
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:40,320
nerves whole other problem so then you

117
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:42,419
have all of these neurotoxins that are

118
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,320
floating around and when they float

119
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:47,639
around they land on sensitive nerves

120
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,620
vagus nerves so the vagus nerves coming

121
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:51,660
out of the brain stem right here coming

122
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:53,639
out going through the body and what

123
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:56,580
happens is these neurotoxins land on the

124
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:58,979
vagus nerves and start to swell the

125
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:00,900
nerves and now the person with pots has

126
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:02,160
the dizziness they have a little bit of

127
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,020
the vertigo they have all these other

128
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,419
issues going on because their vagus

129
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:08,580
nerves are inflamed

130
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:11,340
so let's keep on going there's so much

131
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:14,160
detail comprehensive information about

132
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:16,020
illnesses in brain saver it'll blow your

133
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,240
mind but that's the whole point you

134
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:19,919
become an expert when you have this much

135
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,039
detailed information that no one else

136
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:25,139
has you become the expert you control

137
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,300
your health when you become the expert

138
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:30,600
which is really powerful

139
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:32,820
if the vagus nerves are inflamed higher

140
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,340
up let's go into that right here so if

141
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:38,759
your vagus nerves are inflamed higher up

142
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:42,780
heading to the brain stem down in here

143
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:44,940
right if that happens let's go let's go

144
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:46,800
find that spot then we get different

145
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,479
symptoms that's a whole other problem

146
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,360
that occurs so if the vagus nerves are

147
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:53,220
inflamed higher up closer to the brain

148
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:55,280
that inflammation on the vagus nerves

149
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:57,840
from the neurotoxins can create symptoms

150
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,100
when someone is just getting out of bed

151
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,620
so let's go into that for a minute

152
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:05,400
you're laying in bed it's time to get up

153
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:07,380
you get up and boom you're hit you feel

154
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,360
kind of weak you're not feeling that

155
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,740
strong your legs kind of feel like

156
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,539
they're being weighed down you're

157
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,220
getting kind of heart symptoms you feel

158
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:17,039
like you're getting a little tachycardia

159
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:19,320
that can happen too that that's what

160
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,720
happens when the vagus nerves higher up

161
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:24,180
are getting inflamed

162
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,860
and there's so much information I can go

163
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,360
on and on in here that's incredible so

164
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,460
let's go into this part

165
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,440
okay that inflammation from those

166
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:32,759
neurotoxins can create symptoms when

167
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,639
someone is just getting out of bed

168
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:37,800
picking themselves up off the ground do

169
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:39,900
you have pots has that ever happened to

170
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,180
you where you actually pick yourself off

171
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:44,880
the ground and you get hit you're like

172
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:47,639
boom standing up quickly you bend down

173
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,680
and you stand up quickly bending down

174
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:51,120
right you try to climb up a hill or if

175
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,919
you're trying to actually climb up a

176
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,139
hill that's another thing exerting

177
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:57,900
yourself in any way for some people it

178
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:59,400
feels like having sandbags on their legs

179
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:02,460
where they're walking and you feel like

180
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:05,400
you have sandbags on your legs full body

181
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:07,080
weakness your arms feel really weak or

182
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,419
even feeling like you're about to

183
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:12,300
collapse that's what so many people go

184
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:14,720
through everybody's pot symptoms vary

185
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:17,660
because everybody's immune system varies

186
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:21,660
everybody's viral load

187
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:24,539
varies everybody's viral mutations of

188
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:29,479
the Epstein-Barr vary and everyone's

189
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:32,460
liver capacity for the toxins varies

190
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:34,740
that varies your symptom and you know

191
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:36,780
what's interesting all these years you

192
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:39,180
don't see any of that information out

193
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:40,919
there you don't get the details you

194
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:44,520
can't become an expert when you don't

195
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:47,340
know why you're sick it's in here and it

196
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:49,139
is packed really packed

197
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:51,180
so let's go a little bit further because

198
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:53,940
we can keep on going

199
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:55,979
often these days people don't get a pots

200
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:58,620
diagnosis by itself isn't that weird

201
00:07:55,979 --> 00:08:00,240
isn't that funny so if you had a pots

202
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:02,699
diagnosis you got pots and something

203
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,340
else you've got pots this this this and

204
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:07,139
this someone with pots has often seen

205
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:09,479
multiple doctors and received other

206
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:12,000
diagnoses have you gotten like another

207
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:13,500
diagnosis so you were actually pots and

208
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,099
then you got another diagnosis for like

209
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:21,240
another different condition often pots

210
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:22,979
gets wrapped up into Lyme disease some

211
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,199
of you guys probably had that like with

212
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:27,479
it fibromyalgia where you've got

213
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,300
fibromyalgia diagnosis and a pots

214
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:31,860
diagnosis lupus a lupus diagnosis in a

215
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:35,399
pot's diagnosis

216
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:37,919
vertigo diagnosis mecfs or chronic

217
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:39,599
fatigue because someone is experienced

218
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,219
various symptoms when you when you're

219
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,380
dealing with pots you could also be

220
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:46,440
dealing with all these other symptoms so

221
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:48,420
when you go Doctor shopping you get a

222
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,880
bunch of different labels to take home

223
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:52,920
you know instead of your bag of goodies

224
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,899
or your haul for different shoes and

225
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:57,000
clothes and other things are food at the

226
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:59,700
grocery store you come back from your

227
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,680
doctor shopping with a haul of diagnoses

228
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:04,560
and labels okay

229
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,720
the distinction is that in pots the

230
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,519
liver is more stagnant and sluggish more

231
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,820
overloaded with neurotoxins then here's

232
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:13,920
the thing that's the whole point how do

233
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:15,959
you even know the difference of what

234
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,060
this symptom is that condition the

235
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:21,180
details in here matter that's how

236
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:24,360
incredible it is it's telling you right

237
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:26,880

238
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:29,940
that in pots the liver is more stagnant

239
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:32,700
and sluggish it's not getting sluggish

240
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:34,680
more overloaded with neurotoxins which

241
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,899
means that certain areas of the vagus

242
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:39,480
nerves and up more are puffed out and

243
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:41,580
inflamed the more you have toxins and

244
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,860
poisons and neurotoxins inside the liver

245
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:47,660
the more the vagus nerves are going to

246
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:50,399
Puff out causing more inflammation
