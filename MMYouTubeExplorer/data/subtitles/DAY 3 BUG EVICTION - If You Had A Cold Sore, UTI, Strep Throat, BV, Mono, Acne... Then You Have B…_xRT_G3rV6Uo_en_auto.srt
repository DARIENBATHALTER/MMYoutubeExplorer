they're priceless because that's the

42
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,280
whole point all those years of people

43
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,640
going to doctors but not getting an

44
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,759
answer

45
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,079
we need doctors we need doctors and they

46
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,479
do a lot of great things but we also

47
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,280
have this chronic mystery illness out

48
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,759
there

49
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,520
and it encompasses like autoimmune in

50
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,880
every aspect of that hundreds of

51
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:54,079
diagnoses and symptoms to that

52
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,360
autoimmune that diagnosis right so

53
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,079
whether it's a thyroid problem or

54
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,560
anything else so we need to also have

55
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,320

56
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,640
we could see doctors for 10 years we

57
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,880
could see doctors for 15 years we could

58
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,280
see we can we can just be on that

59
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,200
treadmill of doctors and that's fine

60
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,480
that's fine of course we've got to see

61
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,520
doctors right

62
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,480

150
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,080
little fun

151
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,759
right

152
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,520
let's do that i got my spicy hot apple

153
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,479
juice or spiced

154
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,880
hot apple juice right it's really really

155
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,880
good and

156
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,800
i've been getting into it

157
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,479
i'm excited about that so i got about

158
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,080
roughly about two pounds or more

159
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,400
potatoes right here so these are steamed

160
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,160
potatoes i cut them in half

161
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,160
but they're steamed potatoes so i'm

162
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,840
going to be stuffing the peppers i want

163
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,759
to get them in the oven so we can get

164
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,319
down to business

165
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,039
that's what i want to do

166
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,199
so

167
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,680
i'm removing some of the skins not

168
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,600
because you're supposed to

169
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,319
you can keep them on

170
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,400
they're good for you more than good for

171
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,880
you i'm just pulling some of the skins

172
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,880
off because

173
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,800
of the look right

174
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,479
it's the look i'm going for in this

175
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,080
recipe of course you can keep them on

176
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,800
and i'll keep a lot of the skins on

177
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,560
right

178
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,039
i'll do that but i'm just taking some of

179
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,240
the skins back so i'm looking for a

180
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:30,000
special kind of like stuffing look in

181
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,840
the middle of the pepper so i'm just

182
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,720
taking some of the skins back a little

183
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,560
bit i'm not taking them all off right

184
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,199

right

204
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,280
uh being reactivated epstein-barr i was

205
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,560
the first to put that information out

206
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,319
there okay

207
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,919
i was the first to put the information

208
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,919
out there that you're not creating your

209
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:26,319
illness with your thoughts meaning that

210
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,479
that's not why you're sick like you're

211
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:31,199
not just somebody who somehow is

212
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:33,039
imagining your condition and your

213
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,240
symptoms because medical medical

214
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,520
research and science and both

215
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,039
alternative medicine conventional

216
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,400
medicine doesn't know why anybody's sick

217
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,520
so they came up with a lot of theories

218
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,199
and one theory was you're creating it

219
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,879
with your mind

220
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,639
so you just need to rewire

221
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,400
so you're sick with your hashimoto's and

222
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,240
your lupus and your multiple sclerosis

223
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,240
because you're creating it

224
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,840
it's all in your head right the you know

225
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,919
alternative medicine

226
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,360
all the spiritual medicine right so i

227
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,520
was the first to break the news that

228
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,560
that's not correct

229
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,080
right

230
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,919
first to break the news about all the

231
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,360
air fresheners

232
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,319
all the air fresheners poisoning

233
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,039
everybody

234
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,800
first to break the news about

235
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,879
staying the hell away from dental

236
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,120
amalgams that have mercury in them

237
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,199
i remember in the in the early 1980s i

238
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,800
was shouting it out in the mid-1980s i

239
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,960
was shouting at it everywhere and people

240
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,800
were just livid

241
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,560
angry as

242
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,560
bees like you just hit a beehive so when

243
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,080
i started out getting out there and

244
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,479
lecturing and going on the circuit

245
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,640
saying no you can't put the amalgams the

246
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,200
mercury amalgams in you can't do that

247
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:40,399
anymore people thought i was like an

248
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:43,440
alien from another planet with 10 heads

249
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:45,040
and i took a lot of for that man

250
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,640
that was a tough one

251
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,399
so i don't know why i have to be the one

252
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,399
to do all this

253
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:55,360
but i guess that's just my

254
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:57,200
curse or burden i could keep it going

255
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,560
all day on that why do i have to be the

256
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,640
one to let everybody know that

257
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,279
chickenpox is not the shingles they're

258
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,839
two separate viruses

259
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:09,279
you still see tv commercials if you had

260
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:12,320
the chickenpox you also have the

261
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:14,000
shingles they're the same virus

262
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,480
make sure you get the shingles

263
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,600
medication from our pharmaceutical

264
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,160
company

265
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,080
if you had the chickenpox you are going

266
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,519
to have the shingles first of all

267
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,880
they're two separate viruses and people

268
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,399
have both of them

269
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,720
they're two separate viruses but why do

270
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,320
i have to be the one to to break that to

271
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,839
the whole world

272
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,440
the best medical clinics the best

273
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,360
doctors don't know it

274
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,040
i have to be the one to break that out

275
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,959
because i'm confused about that when i'm

276
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,160
scratching my head about that one

277
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,200
all right so i'm just peeling some of

278
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,080
these skins back because i'm going to

279
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,959
mash these potatoes

280
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,720
i could make it a whole episode on how

281
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,080
i'm the first to put this out

282
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,360
i could make it a whole episode but i

283
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,480
don't want to

284
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:57,120
the point is is the essential oil thing

285
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,959
has gotten a little out of control so

286
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,880

441
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,839

from all that kind of stuff all that

443
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,160
kind of misinformation there's tons of

444
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,440
it

445
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,880
out there

446
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:49,279
that's why people don't heal all the way

447
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,120
right they don't heal over wet

448
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,800
and the people that usually shout out

449
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,199
hey you should do this you should do

450
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,279
that they never got sick yet when they

451
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,800

452
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,480
whatever i've been telling everybody

453
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,399

454
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,839
finally got sick in my life and now i'm

455
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:07,199

do and i'm getting sicker

457
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:14,320
so i just put some chives in here

458
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,160
so i'm mixing up the mixture

459
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,199
and now i'm gonna

460
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,199
cut up the peppers

461
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,920
there we go

462
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:26,320
so this is a mashed potato mixture with

463
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,440
paprika if you just got on here

464
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,360
garlic

465
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,360
onion powder right

466
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,360
that's what this is and i'm just getting

467
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,800
ready to stuff the pepper so that's the

468
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,040
mixture

469
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,720
boom we got it those are steamed

470
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,759
potatoes by the way

471
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,759
steamed potatoes

472
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,000
so what pepper do i want to pick in this

473
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,920
batch

474
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,959
i know a lot of you guys

475
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,959
are afraid of peppers right

476
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:56,720
that's an interesting pepper right there

477
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:58,480
a lot of you guys are afraid of peppers

478
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,079
okay

479
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,079
so i'm taking out the center of the

480
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,079
pepper

481
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,000
and then i'm cutting the pepper in half

482
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,959
all right and i'm going to stuff them

483
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,480
this way

484
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,720
that's how i'm going to stuff them like

485
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:20,559
that

486
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:22,720
but you can do another option too

487
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,319
you can just take the whole pepper and

488
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,240
you can stuff it

489
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,640
in the center if you wanted to that's an

490
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,640
option right there

491
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,640
okay

492
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,360
so

493
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,799
you can also do it this way too on this

494
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,960
recipe you can cut it in half

495
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:46,480
like that

496
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,480
right

497
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,880
you can scoop out

498
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,880
center

499
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:56,320
and now you got a nice boat

500
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,080

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,000
cleanse if you're doing level three you

562
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:14,240
do level three every level

563
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,640
is great

564
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,840
every level is great now you're on day

565
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:22,559
three so you gotta remember bugs are

566
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:25,280
dying bugs are starting to fall apart

567
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:27,760
bugs are exploding bugs are imploding

568
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:30,080
from the inside out because they were so

569
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:32,080
used to eating whatever it was you were

570
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:35,080
feeding them

571
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,080
okay

572
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,840
they're so used to it

573
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:42,880
so i'm topping these off

574
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:46,440
because i i got some extra

575
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,440
so this is great

576
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,520
a friend of mine was making these and

577
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,520
said reminds me of stuffed clams

578
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:01,760
i was like really

579
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,840
yeah when i go to a fancy restaurant and

580
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,120
i order stuffed clams i'm like i don't

581
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,400

582
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,400
clams in any restaurant

583
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,799
i don't know if that's a good thing to

584
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,159

587
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,280
yeah it's all fine and dandy until you

588
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,360

589
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:26,480

618
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:41,840
take notes if you want four categories

619
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,600
one category is bug fuel you're removing

620
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,000
bug fuel

621
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:48,480
you're removing the food that feeds the

622
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,520
bugs you're removing the fuel for the

623
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,880
bugs

ever had that you're like people got

653
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,480
bugs in them they're loaded with bugs so

654
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:57,360
what you're doing is you're removing bug

655
00:23:54,480 --> 00:24:00,320
fuel fuel that feeds the bugs you're

656
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:03,840
removing it so the bugs love to eat and

657
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:05,279
you're actually removing that food right

658
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,960
so

659
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,880
what you're doing

660
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,799
is if you're doing this you're removing

661
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,320
that food so there you go

00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:15,840
you're moving those fried eggs how come

663
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,840
those eggs don't slide off the pan

664
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:21,440
you're removing those eggs that's a fuel

665
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:24,000

so we're doing this this is the first

668
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,320
this is like the first category there's

669
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:34,320
four categories you're removing fuel

670
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:36,240
from the bugs how awesome is that okay

671
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,200

672
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,440

00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:42,559
second category

674
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,880
you're removing blood thickeners

675
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:47,360

676
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:51,840

we're removing blood thickeners that's a

686
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,880

dehydrators no

699
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,400
no keep your food dehydrators if that's

700
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,520
what you got or want

701
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,000
right

702
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:48,240
no i'm talking about dehydrators to the

703
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,600
body we're getting rid of one of the

704
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:53,600
categories dehydrators to the body the

705
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,880
caffeine we're getting rid of that we're

706
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,880
getting rid of caffeine we're getting

707
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,679
rid of vinegars we're getting rid of

708
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:02,240
excess salt we're getting rid of the

709
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:04,400
body dehydrators the high fats which

710
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,200
dehydrate the blood right we're getting

711
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:09,840
rid of the dehydrators

712
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,520
that's important what the dehydrators do

713
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,919
is they stop you from getting nutrients

714
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:16,240
to your brain glucose to your brain

715
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,400
neurotransmitter chemicals you need to

716
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,840
your brain complete electrolytes full

717
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,840
electrolytes

718
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,799
then we're getting rid of the category

719
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:27,360
toxin contributors because now your diet

720
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:30,000
is not a toxin contributor think about

721
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:32,960
that your diet's not a contributor to

722
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,760
bringing toxins into your body

723
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,279
right

724
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,880
you're keeping the caffeine out which is

725
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,799
still a toxin too you're keeping that

726
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,039
one out you're keeping other things out

727
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:42,960
too so it's really important you're

728
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:45,279
keeping your chocolate out as well when

729
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,840
you're doing this thing you're taking a

730
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:49,279
a chocolate break right

731
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,679
a chocolate break

732
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:53,520
that's important like kathy

733
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,279
you guys know

734
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,200
there's a limitation

735
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:58,880
right there's a message that hits you

736
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,840
when you're on your third chocolate bar

737
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,960

00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,360
if you're on your third chocolate bar

740
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:07,520

i love it

906
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:09,600
especially with food prices rising this

907
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:10,559
is the greatest thing i never thought

908
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,720
like

909
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:14,480
because this this cuts um

910
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,919
celery costs in half and anything else

911
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,919
you put it in here cuts it in half

912
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:20,159
because it squeezes over the last drop i

913
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:22,240
never thought i mean

914
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:23,440
with the food cost rising how great it

915
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,840
would be

916
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:28,399
it's just so great

917
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:31,679

only anti-bug but this actually helps

936
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,200
and destroys destroy bugs in in and out

937
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,879
of the body right

938
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:23,599
all through the body very important to

939
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:28,079
know so it destroys pathogens viruses

940
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:30,639
bacteria so viruses

941
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:33,359
and bacteria

942
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:35,839
have a membrane okay

943
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:38,079
peppers are coming out good

944
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:39,520
they have a membrane around them

945
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:42,399
that membrane

946
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:46,000
around bacteria and viruses is what

947
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:48,560
protects the virus and the bacteria

948
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,440
right makes it hard

949
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:54,079
for your immune system to kill

950
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,679
it makes it hard to die

951
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:57,839
so one of the things you're doing with

952
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:01,280
the anti-bug cleanse is you're starving

953
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:03,680
the bacteria you're starving the virus

954
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,440
right so your herpes simplex cold sore

955
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:08,240
fever blister virus that stays in you

956
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:10,000
forever you're starving it now

957
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:12,000
all the different bugs we have that

958
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,040
cause autoimmune we're starving them

959
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,079
right

960
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,680
then

961
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:17,119
what's cool about the anti-bug cleanse

962
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,720
and you guys are doing this anyway a lot

963
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:20,640
of celery juice

964
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,560
when you're bringing in the celery juice

965
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:24,640
which i'm gonna strain when you're

966
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,599
bringing in the celery juice

967
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:28,240
you're

968
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:31,040
breaking down the membrane

969
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:33,839
of the bacteria the streptococcus you're

970
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:35,760
breaking down the membrane

971
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:38,079
of the virus

972
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:40,079
so now you're breaking you're stripping

973
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:42,400
the membrane down

974
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:45,920
so the virus is weakened

975
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:48,480
so your immune system can kill it easier

976
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:52,480
see how it works so celery juice is

977
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:55,520
antiviral antibacterial

978
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,880
so you're using it as a weapon

979
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:01,280
debbie says since i've been on the

980
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:04,160
celery juice i no longer need my daily

981
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:06,160
metamucil whoa whoa

982
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:08,880
that's incredible okay

983
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,800
that i'm happy about

984
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,119
because

985
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,800
it's no fun if you gotta be it it's no

986
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:16,560
fun if you've got to be on your daily

987
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,640
metamucil

988
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:21,200
i don't know that's not a fun thing it's

989
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:23,040
not like i'm having fun on my metamucil

990
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:27,839
this is the funnest thing ever

991
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:27,839
no it's it's far from fun right

992
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:33,599
okay so

993
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:36,400
you want to strain your celery juice

994
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:36,400
keep that in mind

995
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:44,079
it's a mistake often made simple mistake

996
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:45,280
people make it they don't strain it

997
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:47,680
that's all

998
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:50,720
simple mistake

999
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,920
got your celery juice right there

1000
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,200
there we go

1001
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,520
incredible

1002
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:57,520
so what the celery juice does

1003
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,760
is it starts to break down the membrane

1004
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:02,240
membrane of the bugs so this is the

1005
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,440
anti-bug cleanse that's an anti-bug

1006
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:07,119
drink

1007
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:09,280
so what's incredible about the mm-900

1008
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:10,800
it's dry in here

1009
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,960
it's like dust

1010
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,800
it's dry and this is dry

1011
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:17,599
so that's why the food costs go down

1012
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,280
with that juicer it's the mm-900 hgs i'm

1013
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:21,359
mentioning it because i hear people are

1014
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,680
freaking out about food costs

1015
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:25,920
and they've been asking lately

1016
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:29,119
so it's it's really nice but just wait

1017
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:32,960
for it to be on sale so let's go

1018
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:32,960
let's move along let's take a look

1019
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:38,960

so i have them here

1079
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,200
if you guys can see that and i'm gonna

1080
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,040
drop a little bit of parsley on there

1081
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:48,480
just like this i'm gonna put a little

1082
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,480
bit of chive on there too

1083
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,960
just cut up a little bit of chive

1084
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:00,319
there you go

1085
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:05,560
i wanted to show you and then i'm gonna

1086
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:05,560
plate it okay

1087
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,720
so

1088
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:18,480
i'm putting these two here i'm going to

1089
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,680
plate the rest right now if you guys are

1090
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,240
okay with this

1091
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:23,280
this is like one of my favorite dishes

1092
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,720
okay

1093
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,640
now i know a lot of people have

1094
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:28,160
nightshade fear but

1095
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,760
there's no

1096
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:31,280
oil

1097
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,520
in here

1098
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:36,480
there's no dairy

1099
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:38,079
that's what causes a nightshade problem

1100
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,160
it's not the nightshade causing the

1101
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:42,800
problem it's the dairy the cream the

1102
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:46,839
milk the butter that's what causes that

1103
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,839
so it's very important to know

1104
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:55,119
pathogens cause your symptoms

1105
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,760
okay

1106
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:58,760
peppers are antiviral

1107
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:03,760
antibacterial

1108
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:06,400
viruses and pathogens and

1109
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:08,400
bacteria cause your symptoms so you're

1110
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,839
somebody that's sick and you go and you

1111
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,400
talk to somebody like maybe you should

1112
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:13,760
stay away from nightshades you just got

1113
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:18,560
handed

1114
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:18,560
a one-way ticket down south to sick land

1115
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:24,319
okay

1116
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:25,200
this is a one-way ticket

1117
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:28,000
up

1118
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,520
to healing land okay when someone says

1119
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,280
stay away from those night shades don't

1120
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:33,839
eat the potato

1121
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:35,760
they they're just not educated as a

1122
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:39,520
health professional to know

1123
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:40,960
the potatoes bad from being fried in oil

1124
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,960
grease

1125
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:45,920
like people eat them and doused in

1126
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:47,760
butter cream milk

1127
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,040
and that's why the potatoes bad oh i

1128
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,319
forgot

1129
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:52,960
cheese

1130
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:54,319
lots of cheese on potatoes now

1131
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,319
what the health professional doesn't

1132
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:58,160
know

1133
00:42:56,319 --> 00:43:00,480
is that it's the cheese the milk the

1134
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,440
butter so you're really kind of screwed

1135
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,640
think about it you're out of health

1136
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:05,599
professionals

1137
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:07,359
in office you're trying to get help

1138
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:10,079
and so you're relying on them to be

1139
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:12,240
smart and like stay away from potato

1140
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:14,000
stay away from the red bell pepper like

1141
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:16,800
okay all right

1142
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,520
because they're bad they're a nightshade

1143
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:22,160
no

1144
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:22,160
it's the milk cheese butter oil

1145
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:26,480
it's that the cream

1146
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:29,200
it's that

1147
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:31,359
that's giving them their problems

1148
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,960
i've done your 369 cleanse and read your

1149
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:35,599
cleanse the heel book

1150
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:38,000
it helped me tremendously eliminated my

1151
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:40,160
anxiety and eczema and i loved many

1152
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:44,079
recipes in the book asparagus soup is

1153
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:46,640
delicious asparagus soup is amazing

1154
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:48,400
i'm gonna pop on a few more chives

1155
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,839
because i only i really just put on

1156
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,760
parsley so let me just put a few more

1157
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:55,720
chives on top

1158
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,720
because that's the way i like them

1159
00:43:56,319 --> 00:44:01,440
so the nightshade problem out there was

1160
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:03,359
a guess it was just another guessing

1161
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,680
game because nobody knows why anybody's

1162
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:07,760
sick it's just another guessing game

1163
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:10,480
maybe it's the nightshade sounds so

1164
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:12,480
spooky nightshades ooh

1165
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,720
maybe that's why you're sick you can put

1166
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:16,240
a little lemon on here if you want too

1167
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:18,160
i'm gonna add a little bit lemon a

1168
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:21,800
little bit of lemon right on the top

1169
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,800
that's what i'm gonna do

1170
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:26,960
fresh lemon to give it that nice flavor

1171
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:33,200
that's what i'm gonna do there

1172
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,640
okay and then i might even try to take a

1173
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,800
bite of one of these but this thing is

1174
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:39,520
gonna be hot let me get rid of the

1175
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,520
pathogens

1176
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:44,079
okay

1177
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:45,839
now you can you can cut these in half

1178
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:47,520
again like cut them in half and have

1179
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:50,960
smaller wedges

1180
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:52,880
you can take a bite right

1181
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,839

yeah how about pancreatitis you know how

1273
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,079
many people got pancreatitis from doing

that cleanse

1275
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:30,720
yeah i watched people come through my

1276
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:32,640
office said the worst case of

1277
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:34,240
pancreatitis they could they were sick

1278
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:36,400
for months they almost lost their

1279
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:38,720
pancreas

1280
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,720
nope

1281
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,480
that's not a cleanse all that does is

1282
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,760
put your system in shock

1283
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:46,319
and you can't cleanse with all that

1284
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,319
olive oil

1285
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:50,319
man

1286
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:53,200
i wouldn't do that cleanse

1287
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:53,200
be smart about it

1288
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:05,280
debbie says

1289
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:07,680
i feel like this only resonates with

1290
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:10,800
people who have been really sick for

1291
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,800
quite a while seasoned

1292
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:14,880
that's why medical medium is hated by a

1293
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:16,079
lot of not so sick people out there

1294
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,920
they're doing all kinds of different

1295
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:19,280
fancy belief systems out there and they

1296
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:21,280
just hate the medical medium because

1297
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:23,359
they've never been sick

1298
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:25,040
someday if they get sick they they'll

1299
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:26,720
get a chance to heal

1300
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:28,160
if they can somehow

1301
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:30,640
you know

1302
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:33,839
get past all the the misinformation out

1303
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:36,880
there to swamp out their misinformation

1304
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:38,480
you guys this is incredible
