[0.40 - 3.76] we're live right now and we're talking
[2.72 - 6.16] about the top four
[3.76 - 8.40] supplements a baseline what does that

[8.40 - 12.00] means
[9.28 - 13.52] the top four with all the different

[128.08 - 131.84] liz good to see you

[132.32 - 135.92] when melon season's happening i crack
[134.48 - 138.40] the melon open

[138.40 - 141.92] try to show you guys how
[139.68 - 142.96] i do spirulina and borrow the grass
[141.92 - 145.68] juice powder
[142.96 - 148.64] using melon so that's gonna be fun
[145.68 - 150.48] michelle l good to see you
[148.64 - 152.08] so glad you guys are coming on now so
[150.48 - 156.64] let's go into it a little bit
[152.08 - 158.72] all right top four right here zinc is
[156.64 - 160.08] one of them one of the top four really
[158.72 - 163.36] important right there
[160.08 - 164.48] so what now here's the thing not every
[163.36 - 165.92] zinc works
[164.48 - 167.84] and that's what people don't understand
[165.92 - 171.44] so i wasn't clear
[167.84 - 174.24] perfectly clear as to why i'm so
[171.44 - 174.88] about vimergy so it wasn't perfectly
[174.24 - 177.76] clear
[174.88 - 179.20] like how come i'm so about them like
[177.76 - 182.80] what makes them
[179.20 - 185.12] so different like something mind-blowing
[182.80 - 186.48] i'll give you this example right here
[185.12 - 189.68] okay
[186.48 - 192.44] they're the only company that's
[189.68 - 194.56] has a stabilizer for zinc and
[192.44 - 195.12] stabilizers is the only way to keep your
[194.56 - 197.92] zinc
[195.12 - 199.76] working active and functional so if
[197.92 - 202.24] vimergy's inc disappeared
[199.76 - 203.76] and was gone we would have all the other
[202.24 - 207.04] zincs on the market
[203.76 - 210.08] they would not be stabilized very
[207.04 - 213.28] important to know that means their
[210.08 - 215.84] their their ability to work
[213.28 - 216.64] and do what needs to be done for zinc
[215.84 - 218.88] lessens
[216.64 - 219.76] and it could lessen greatly that
[218.88 - 223.68] includes
[219.76 - 226.16] it surviving or even staying stable
[223.68 - 227.44] and that's how zinc works zinc has to be
[226.16 - 230.00] stabilized
[227.44 - 231.12] and so when people say oh no i can order
[230.00 - 232.96] some other zinc
[231.12 - 234.96] let me look here oh here's a company
[232.96 - 237.52] that that's that's got all about
[234.96 - 239.12] quality and let me check them out and i
[237.52 - 240.96] can order that zinc
[239.12 - 242.40] and what people don't realize those
[240.96 - 244.72] aren't stabilized
[242.40 - 245.76] and that's a critical part right there
[244.72 - 248.88] so
[245.76 - 250.72] if if vimergy zinc disappeared
[248.88 - 252.40] i would be like well i don't know what i
[250.72 - 254.36] would do to be honest i know that all
[252.40 - 257.04] the other zincs would be
[254.36 - 257.84] destabilized and that's a difference
[257.04 - 259.92] right there
[257.84 - 261.92] that means that it may not last more
[259.92 - 263.20] than a month on the shelf it may not
[261.92 - 265.76] last more than a week after
[263.20 - 268.00] manufacturing like no one knows
[265.76 - 269.92] because when it's not stabilized
[268.00 - 272.24] anything goes wrong and so this is just
[269.92 - 273.44] one reason right there that's so
[272.24 - 275.20] important you guys
[273.44 - 276.48] we're live on tick tock facebook youtube
[275.20 - 278.16] clubhouse good to see you guys talk
[276.48 - 279.84] about the top four
[278.16 - 281.76] supplements now if you guys don't know
[279.84 - 286.00] about vimergy it's v and victor i
[281.76 - 287.76] am as mary e rgy.com go to vimergy.com
[286.00 - 290.88] that's the best place to go
[287.76 - 293.04] and i'm not sponsored by these guys okay
[290.88 - 294.80] this is just the best stuff out there
[293.04 - 298.24] it's what i give family friends
[294.80 - 299.92] it's what i take myself so you you might
[298.24 - 301.60] be somebody that's like wow i know this
[299.92 - 303.44] company that's really good
[301.60 - 305.60] they put out a zinc they put out a
[303.44 - 308.96] liquid sink sulfate
[305.60 - 312.00] just like vimergy but they did not
[308.96 - 314.40] learn about stabilizing it
[312.00 - 316.24] and vimergy did and vimergi's only
[314.40 - 318.32] company learned about stabilizing
[316.24 - 319.60] so there's there's that alone is just
[318.32 - 321.52] unbelievable
[319.60 - 323.28] lisa says i finally decided to throw out
[321.52 - 325.12] all the crap in my cupboard
[323.28 - 326.80] and only go with what you currently
[325.12 - 328.16] recommend such a difference such a
[326.80 - 328.64] difference at least it's an unbelievable
[328.16 - 330.00] difference
[328.64 - 332.48] and that brings me back to the whole
[330.00 - 333.84] like the whole game that's happening in
[332.48 - 337.04] marketing right now
[333.84 - 338.00] fulvic acid didn't work you guys don't
[337.04 - 339.60] know the history
[338.00 - 340.96] and i'll go into that and i'll go into
[339.60 - 341.52] the rest of the stuff for a second but i
[340.96 - 344.56] wanna
[341.52 - 347.04] i wanna cut the head off the snake okay
[344.56 - 347.60] i wanna cut the head off the snake right
[347.04 - 349.92] now
[347.60 - 351.76] the reason why medical medium doesn't
[349.92 - 354.80] recommend fulvic acid
[351.76 - 356.16] or humic acid is because they already
[354.80 - 359.04] tried it on everybody
[356.16 - 360.40] and it died they tried it on everybody
[359.04 - 362.64] and it died out
[360.40 - 364.16] they sold all their expensive marketing
[362.64 - 367.44] a fulvic and humic acid
[364.16 - 370.00] 20 years ago and then it died out
[367.44 - 371.84] because it did nothing for anybody
[370.00 - 373.52] makers of fulvic acid don't know why
[371.84 - 375.76] anybody is even sick
[373.52 - 377.60] but the mar here's what they do a new
[375.76 - 381.44] generation of suckers comes along
[377.60 - 381.84] over and over again and they re ignited
[381.44 - 384.08] it
[381.84 - 385.68] with marketing and money and that's why
[384.08 - 387.28] you see everybody talking about fulvic
[385.68 - 390.08] acid fulvic acid
[387.28 - 391.84] it's really an epic example of how
[390.08 - 394.24] nobody knows history
[391.84 - 395.76] you guys don't know the history it never
[394.24 - 397.28] worked for anyone
[395.76 - 399.36] it doesn't get somebody out of lupus
[397.28 - 400.72] fibromyalgia mass aches and pains
[399.36 - 402.88] chronic fatigue
[400.72 - 404.48] all these things that medical medium
[402.88 - 406.08] gets people out of that medical medium
[404.48 - 408.16] information is known to get
[406.08 - 409.84] people out of the first time in our
[408.16 - 412.16] history to get us out of these
[409.84 - 414.48] conditions to get rid of ra
[412.16 - 416.32] to get rid of kidney conditions to get
[414.48 - 417.92] rid of utis forever to get rid of
[416.32 - 419.76] excellent psoriasis to do all these
[417.92 - 421.76] things that's medical medium
[419.76 - 423.44] that's what that is only medical medium
[421.76 - 424.64] has done that i hate to break it to
[423.44 - 427.52] anybody who's a
[424.64 - 429.20] either a doubter or a naysayer or a
[427.52 - 431.28] critic i hate to break it to you
[429.20 - 432.40] but everybody stayed sick in the last 20
[431.28 - 434.96] 30 years
[432.40 - 435.52] unless they learn the tools to heal and
[434.96 - 438.48] then
[435.52 - 440.24] all the different scams were tried they
[438.48 - 443.12] tried the fulvic acid scam
[440.24 - 444.96] 20 years ago 18 years ago and it burned
[443.12 - 445.76] out because it didn't work and then they
[444.96 - 448.64] wait
[445.76 - 451.44] they wait to reignite something when
[448.64 - 453.20] when everybody forgets
[451.44 - 454.48] i just i can't even i can go on and on
[453.20 - 455.36] and i don't want to waste your time on
[454.48 - 458.48] that stuff
[455.36 - 460.32] so let's let's uh let's
[458.48 - 462.56] i mean honestly and they know that we
[460.32 - 464.72] can become robots and just be like
[462.56 - 465.84] and not know history because we get
[464.72 - 467.44] reprogrammed too
[465.84 - 469.76] you know we get reprogrammed and we just
[467.44 - 471.92] forget history and then we're just like
[469.76 - 473.28] folding asset oh my gossip give me the
[471.92 - 475.20] full vacuumic acid
[473.28 - 476.48] yeah i give me that okay i'll take this
[475.20 - 477.84] i'll take that
[476.48 - 479.60] i you don't think i could put out a
[477.84 - 481.68] fulvic acid tomorrow
[479.60 - 483.60] i could put out a medical medium fulvic
[481.68 - 486.24] acid you don't think
[483.60 - 487.60] uh you don't think like i think about it
[486.24 - 489.04] everybody's like fulvic asphalt they
[487.60 - 490.72] have fluffic acid
[489.04 - 492.40] so i could put one out tomorrow medical
[490.72 - 495.68] medium fulvic acid tomorrow
[492.40 - 497.84] if it was good for somebody you know i
[495.68 - 500.80] don't own any supplement companies
[497.84 - 501.60] i don't own any but if i could literally
[500.80 - 503.76] just start
[501.60 - 504.80] a supplement company tomorrow call it
[503.76 - 507.04] medical medium
[504.80 - 508.48] start with fulvic acid and everybody
[507.04 - 511.28] would buy it
[508.48 - 513.84] but then everybody would get ripped off
[511.28 - 516.40] everybody would get screwed over
[513.84 - 517.52] because nobody knows it doesn't do
[516.40 - 519.12] anything
[517.52 - 520.48] anyway let's keep on moving along i
[519.12 - 522.32] don't want to waste your time but it's
[520.48 - 524.08] important these are important questions
[522.32 - 525.36] that keep on coming up too because
[524.08 - 526.88] people are like why isn't he talking
[525.36 - 527.84] about it what do you mean why am i not
[526.88 - 531.44] talking about
[527.84 - 533.28] because they didn't been there done that
[531.44 - 535.52] fulvic acid makers don't know why people
[533.28 - 538.72] are sick that's the whole point
[535.52 - 540.16] but that's how it works anyway
[538.72 - 541.60] good to see you guys coming on let's go
[540.16 - 542.48] into so i was talking about the zinc
[541.60 - 544.40] like
[542.48 - 546.16] so what okay what he has a favorite
[544.40 - 547.52] company he has a couple of favorite
[546.16 - 550.00] companies
[547.52 - 552.16] uh you know a few favorite companies why
[550.00 - 555.28] is vimrgy such a favorite company
[552.16 - 559.44] it's the only stabilized zinc and that
[555.28 - 563.92] makes a difference it really does
[559.44 - 566.00] so luis vic uh victoria says
[563.92 - 568.00] um you're wrong fulvic acid takes my
[566.00 - 569.84] pain away stop all your medical medium
[568.00 - 572.56] tools
[569.84 - 573.76] uh louise uh victoria stop all your
[572.56 - 575.52] medical need tools

[589.60 - 594.32] heavy metal detox stuff everything
[591.36 - 595.60] stop everything right and then see what
[594.32 - 596.72] fulvic acid does for you
[595.60 - 599.12] because i'll tell you what happened
[596.72 - 600.72] before medical medium everybody took it
[599.12 - 602.84] by the truckloads and stayed sick and
[600.72 - 605.44] got sicker and then his medical medium
[602.84 - 608.24] tools siphoned in
[605.44 - 609.04] and started saving lives it changed
[608.24 - 610.96] everything
[609.04 - 612.72] it changed everything so that means that

[651.60 - 655.04] get rid of the cilantro because nobody
[653.44 - 657.28] ate cilantro they chopped up a little
[655.04 - 658.96] tiny piece and threw it on guacamole
[657.28 - 660.64] so let's get rid of all the different
[658.96 - 662.32] leafy greens because nobody ate leafy
[660.64 - 663.68] greens that's medical medium information
[662.32 - 666.00] let's get rid of that
[663.68 - 667.28] let's get rid of all of it and then what
[666.00 - 670.56] we're gonna have
[667.28 - 672.56] is a keto diet an old keto diet
[670.56 - 674.64] not even a new keto diet that has mm
[672.56 - 676.72] info in it you'll have an old keto diet
[674.64 - 678.08] and you'll have folic acid you'll have
[676.72 - 680.24] your zeolite
[678.08 - 682.32] you'll have your bentonite clay you'll
[680.24 - 685.28] have your apple cider vinegar
[682.32 - 686.08] you'll have your you'll have your olive
[685.28 - 688.48] oil
[686.08 - 690.24] you'll have all these things right and
[688.48 - 691.92] then and then see where we are we will
[690.24 - 695.28] be back to where we were
[691.92 - 697.60] 20 years ago oh my god
[695.28 - 698.48] marianne said i did fulvic in humic acid
[697.60 - 701.12] it didn't work
[698.48 - 703.04] it doesn't work what people do is
[701.12 - 704.40] they're on so many medical medium tools
[703.04 - 705.52] now even if they don't know it
[704.40 - 708.56] indirectly
[705.52 - 708.96] that it's keeping them afloat so they
[708.56 - 710.88] can
[708.96 - 712.56] they can mess they we can afford to mess
[710.88 - 715.04] up now did you guys know that
[712.56 - 716.08] like that wasn't like that years ago
[715.04 - 718.40] michelle l says
[716.08 - 720.08] did it all she said did it all you can
[718.40 - 721.68] afford to mess up now
[720.08 - 723.36] because your wild blueberries are saving
[721.68 - 724.96] you your celery juice is saving you
[723.36 - 726.72] you know your low fat is saving you all
[724.96 - 728.00] these things are saving you
[726.72 - 729.52] and and that's how it works so let's
[728.00 - 731.28] move on a little bit don't want to waste
[729.52 - 733.60] your time on this but it's it's in you
[731.28 - 735.04] know it comes up
[733.60 - 736.72] so let's talk about the zinc a little
[735.04 - 740.48] bit more so
[736.72 - 742.64] the reason why this zinc helps
[740.48 - 744.40] and it works for the zinc shock therapy
[742.64 - 746.64] and it makes a difference and i'm not
[744.40 - 748.24] sponsored by this company
[746.64 - 749.76] but they're the only ones that figured
[748.24 - 752.00] out how to stabilize zinc
[749.76 - 753.20] and those other companies says i notice
[752.00 - 756.16] that the bots come
[753.20 - 757.52] in right the minute medical medium tries
[756.16 - 760.48] to get people better
[757.52 - 762.00] with information the bots come in they
[760.48 - 762.48] come in and they start pushing their
[762.00 - 765.44] zinc
[762.48 - 766.08] liquid sulfate they start pushing their
[765.44 - 768.56] stuff
[766.08 - 769.60] but it's destabilized it's not
[768.56 - 772.00] stabilized
[769.60 - 772.64] but nobody knows this and here's the
[772.00 - 775.20] other thing
[772.64 - 777.04] here's the clincher of why here's
[775.20 - 778.00] another clincher of why vimergy is the
[777.04 - 780.40] best
[778.00 - 781.84] here's another clincher you ready for
[780.40 - 784.56] this
[781.84 - 786.24] vimergy knows about something in the
[784.56 - 788.32] supplement company
[786.24 - 789.36] supplement company world that'll blow
[788.32 - 792.56] your mind
[789.36 - 794.64] get ready for this okay all the
[792.56 - 796.32] supplement companies
[794.64 - 799.76] are allowed to put stuff in their
[796.32 - 803.76] products and not listed on the label
[799.76 - 807.44] if it's a small amount
[803.76 - 811.84] a small amount the reason why
[807.44 - 815.68] i am deadly cautious now
[811.84 - 818.24] about so many companies is because
[815.68 - 819.84] there's four percent something in there
[818.24 - 821.68] that's not listed on the ingredient list
[819.84 - 824.56] that nobody knows about
[821.68 - 826.08] there's six percent something listed if
[824.56 - 827.44] that's in there that's not listed on the
[826.08 - 830.56] ingredient list
[827.44 - 833.84] demergie knows this and they know
[830.56 - 835.12] to stay away from that game that game is
[833.84 - 838.08] real
[835.12 - 839.52] all the supplement companies have things
[838.08 - 841.52] in there
[839.52 - 843.20] you'll never know they're not listed on
[841.52 - 845.20] the ingredients
[843.20 - 846.24] so when you say your favorite stuff i
[845.20 - 849.44] love this
[846.24 - 851.68] i love that that's going on out there
[849.44 - 853.12] there is portions of things that they
[851.68 - 854.72] don't have to list in the ingredient
[853.12 - 857.44] list
[854.72 - 859.04] and that right there is a mind blower so
[857.44 - 860.72] when people say oh he's just
[859.04 - 862.40] he just likes to take what he takes so
[860.72 - 863.84] he's gonna of course back it up and
[862.40 - 866.24] stand behind it no
[863.84 - 867.84] it's more than that and i don't go into
[866.24 - 869.60] this nitty-gritty
[867.84 - 872.08] i don't but it's time to go into this
[869.60 - 873.28] neighborhood helpful is it's awful
[872.08 - 875.52] you couldn't believe you couldn't
[873.28 - 877.92] believe they don't have to list it
[875.52 - 880.16] there's a there's a law in
[877.92 - 882.88] supplementation land when everybody
[880.16 - 884.88] gets their supplements made out there
[882.88 - 887.28] there's a law
[884.88 - 888.80] the supplement company the blenders that
[887.28 - 890.40] make it all for all these people like
[888.80 - 892.00] hey i woke up this morning i want to get
[890.40 - 892.72] an investor i'm going to start my own
[892.00 - 894.24] supplement
[892.72 - 896.32] it's going to be high quality let me go
[894.24 - 899.36] do it they go do it
[896.32 - 902.08] there's there's a portion of
[899.36 - 903.12] something in there no one lists on the
[902.08 - 905.20] ingredient list
[903.12 - 907.52] that's not good for you and it's in all
[905.20 - 911.68] the supplement companies out there
[907.52 - 913.36] and nobody knows it's actually evil
[911.68 - 914.96] okay i'm going into the nitty-gritty
[913.36 - 915.76] today because you know what happened the
[914.96 - 918.08] bots came
[915.76 - 918.96] out i'm trying to like help people you
[918.08 - 921.60] know compassion
[918.96 - 922.72] caring you try to help people i want
[921.60 - 924.64] people to heal
[922.72 - 926.00] right and then the bots come out that
[924.64 - 927.68] are paid and all the admin come
[926.00 - 929.76] out and the mlm people come back try
[927.68 - 931.52] this v12 try this b12 oh
[929.76 - 933.04] try this thing try this thing oh no
[931.52 - 935.20] better do fulvic acid don't listen to
[933.04 - 935.68] him fulvic acid let me do this let me do
[935.20 - 937.36] this
[935.68 - 940.16] and no one realizes you know what so i'm
[937.36 - 941.68] like okay all right
[940.16 - 943.68] okay then let's get into the
[941.68 - 946.48] nitty-gritty let's expose
[943.68 - 947.28] the crap out there and that's one reason
[946.48 - 950.56] why i back
[947.28 - 951.44] them orgy because they're like they tell
[950.56 - 954.56] they're the worst
[951.44 - 955.60] nightmare for suppliers they're like you
[954.56 - 957.28] ain't sticking
[955.60 - 959.92] you ain't sticking small amounts of
[957.28 - 961.92] something in our product
[959.92 - 963.92] you can do that to every other company
[961.92 - 965.04] like you do you're not doing it here so
[963.92 - 968.08] that's one thing right there
[965.04 - 969.44] really important okay so let's
[968.08 - 970.72] you know it's just like fragrances they
[969.44 - 971.52] don't list the ingredients of a
[970.72 - 973.04] fragrance
[971.52 - 974.72] well supplement companies do something
[973.04 - 977.36] similar to this all of them do
[974.72 - 978.40] the manufacturers all do this so that's
[977.36 - 981.68] one thing right there so
[978.40 - 984.16] anything you guys take that for
[981.68 - 986.88] like some info that's really important
[984.16 - 990.24] just go to another thing that's critical
[986.88 - 992.00] all right vimergy knows medical medium
[990.24 - 994.24] standards
[992.00 - 995.04] so when you go to another liquid zinc
[994.24 - 997.44] sulfate
[995.04 - 999.04] when you go to another b12 they don't
[997.44 - 1002.24] care about
[999.04 - 1004.56] mm standards the owners of
[1002.24 - 1006.08] those companies don't care about medical
[1004.56 - 1007.44] medium standards
[1006.08 - 1008.88] you guys care about medical medium
[1007.44 - 1010.00] standards because you know it's the best
[1008.88 - 1012.08] it's what got people better
[1010.00 - 1013.36] all these years right you guys care
[1012.08 - 1016.72] about medical medium
[1013.36 - 1017.68] standards they don't let me go oh whoa
[1016.72 - 1020.88] the bots are out
[1017.68 - 1022.40] tried sb12 try this b12 that b12 company
[1020.88 - 1024.16] doesn't care about medical medium
[1022.40 - 1025.60] standards but you think they
[1024.16 - 1027.84] they're all you think they're all
[1025.60 - 1031.12] plugged into medical medium standards
[1027.84 - 1034.72] like some weird some angel fairy
[1031.12 - 1036.24] some magical spell was cast upon all the
[1034.72 - 1039.28] other supplements
[1036.24 - 1042.72] for them to care about medical medium
[1039.28 - 1046.00] standards no
[1042.72 - 1048.32] no it's just they don't care
[1046.00 - 1049.44] they don't care and these are
[1048.32 - 1051.84] differences
[1049.44 - 1053.36] for someone who's really sick and they
[1051.84 - 1055.36] don't care
[1053.36 - 1057.44] you can sell not you can sell
[1055.36 - 1059.76] supplements to people all day long to
[1057.44 - 1061.68] not so sick people
[1059.76 - 1064.24] but when people are really sick it's
[1061.68 - 1065.60] make or break a stabilized zinc is make
[1064.24 - 1067.76] or break
[1065.60 - 1068.64] right the right kind of b12 is make or
[1067.76 - 1071.12] break
[1068.64 - 1072.24] right these things are make or break
[1071.12 - 1074.80] okay
[1072.24 - 1075.92] a spirulina that's not from the pacific
[1074.80 - 1078.96] ocean
[1075.92 - 1081.28] is make or break right
[1078.96 - 1083.76] a spirulina that doesn't have a random
[1081.28 - 1087.20] piece of mysterious plastic in it
[1083.76 - 1090.16] from the pacific spirulinas companies
[1087.20 - 1091.76] is make or break all these things matter
[1090.16 - 1093.04] when you're really sick
[1091.76 - 1096.00] and these are just something so let's
[1093.04 - 1098.00] move along there's more stuff too
[1096.00 - 1099.60] um you guys if you just got here top
[1098.00 - 1100.40] four supplements we'll even go to top
[1099.60 - 1101.76] eight okay
[1100.40 - 1104.48] and you know especially if you're like
[1101.76 - 1106.16] you got a budget if you got a budget
[1104.48 - 1108.08] if you're somebody that's like hey you
[1106.16 - 1108.80] know i can't afford much right now or i
[1108.08 - 1111.28] can't afford
[1108.80 - 1112.88] something what do i do well i look at
[1111.28 - 1115.04] the top four so if i was in that
[1112.88 - 1116.00] situation right and i couldn't afford a
[1115.04 - 1118.00] supplement
[1116.00 - 1120.32] i would be like well you know i would go
[1118.00 - 1121.68] with one of the top four
[1120.32 - 1123.52] that's what i would do and here it takes
[1121.68 - 1126.40] me to the next place too
[1123.52 - 1126.80] what happens is they also get you out
[1126.40 - 1129.36] there
[1126.80 - 1129.92] where it's like let me go and buy this
[1129.36 - 1135.04] really
[1129.92 - 1138.56] really cheap junkie product out there
[1135.04 - 1142.00] or two products out there that won't
[1138.56 - 1143.36] help me heal when i can actually get a
[1142.00 - 1145.28] high quality product can make a
[1143.36 - 1146.48] difference so that thing happens all the
[1145.28 - 1149.60] time
[1146.48 - 1151.04] you know and and that's something to
[1149.60 - 1152.40] think about
[1151.04 - 1154.96] so then we'll talk about like other
[1152.40 - 1159.12] stuff so what i love about
[1154.96 - 1162.88] you know what i love about vimergy too
[1159.12 - 1166.16] is they don't use
[1162.88 - 1168.16] palm glycerin key let's go there
[1166.16 - 1170.40] okay so i got a lemon balm right here
[1168.16 - 1174.64] right here's a cat's claw right here
[1170.40 - 1177.44] okay glycerin glycerin in here right
[1174.64 - 1178.08] they don't use the palm glycerin now i'm
[1177.44 - 1181.60] in the top
[1178.08 - 1184.40] four okay you guys i'm in the top four
[1181.60 - 1185.76] right palm glycerin isn't the worst
[1184.40 - 1188.80] thing in the world
[1185.76 - 1191.68] it's not i'm not sitting here
[1188.80 - 1192.88] hating on it like it's the worst thing
[1191.68 - 1195.36] okay
[1192.88 - 1197.04] because because there are there are some
[1195.36 - 1198.72] products out there that are decent that
[1197.04 - 1200.40] have palm glycerin in it
[1198.72 - 1202.24] and sometimes you got to take the good
[1200.40 - 1203.28] you take the bad that's what you do
[1202.24 - 1206.88] right
[1203.28 - 1210.56] but then she went to a different level
[1206.88 - 1213.44] and they don't use the palm glycerin
[1210.56 - 1215.20] and they use organic when they can on
[1213.44 - 1216.64] top of it with their glycerin they use a
[1215.20 - 1220.00] flax glycerin
[1216.64 - 1222.48] they took it to a level no one has so
[1220.00 - 1225.60] they took it to the flax glycerin right
[1222.48 - 1226.56] and that alone is mind-blowing because
[1225.60 - 1228.80] they insist
[1226.56 - 1230.64] on making sure they're not going to do
[1228.80 - 1233.68] the status quo
[1230.64 - 1236.16] just regular crap that's out there
[1233.68 - 1237.68] and so that alone is mind-blowing
[1236.16 - 1239.20] somebody's like well i like this other
[1237.68 - 1240.88] company i'll go get there's
[1239.20 - 1242.24] i'll get use their lemon bomb or
[1240.88 - 1244.48] whatever it's like oh you just got palm
[1242.24 - 1247.12] glycerin
[1244.48 - 1249.60] and vimergy doesn't use palm glycerin
[1247.12 - 1251.84] and i didn't go into this nitty gritty
[1249.60 - 1253.28] the last time i did a live you guys and
[1251.84 - 1253.84] i didn't go into this nitty gritty of
[1253.28 - 1255.92] all this
[1253.84 - 1256.96] incredible information about the energy
[1255.92 - 1259.44] or whatever and
[1256.96 - 1261.36] because there's so much to talk about
[1259.44 - 1264.00] but these things matter
[1261.36 - 1264.64] here's the next one from vimergy right
[1264.00 - 1266.48] that blows
[1264.64 - 1268.40] blows my mind it might blow your mind
[1266.48 - 1270.16] they independently test everything for
[1268.40 - 1272.72] bacteria
[1270.16 - 1273.76] and the other companies don't think
[1272.72 - 1277.12] about that
[1273.76 - 1281.20] that right there independently
[1277.12 - 1284.80] test for bacteria they independently
[1281.20 - 1286.68] test for bacteria
[1284.80 - 1288.48] when the other companies with their
[1286.68 - 1292.08] spirulinas
[1288.48 - 1294.48] and their supplement products are not
[1292.08 - 1295.92] independently testing for bacteria never
[1294.48 - 1299.44] mind testing for bacteria
[1295.92 - 1302.80] most of them think about that one
[1299.44 - 1304.00] okay so lisa angle said their lemon balm
[1302.80 - 1306.48] really helped me

[1308.16 - 1310.88] it
[1309.12 - 1312.48] and lorraine elle says thanks for going
[1310.88 - 1314.08] through the nitty gritty
[1312.48 - 1315.60] i know it doesn't make everybody happy
[1314.08 - 1317.60] but thanks lorraine
[1315.60 - 1319.20] robinson the details do matter they do
[1317.60 - 1321.36] and i'm giving you guys the details
[1319.20 - 1325.28] right here
[1321.36 - 1327.20] um so yeah
[1325.28 - 1328.72] so what one supplement would i suggest
[1327.20 - 1330.72] on tick tock i just saw that right there
[1328.72 - 1331.28] so what one supplement would i suggest
[1330.72 - 1332.96] right
[1331.28 - 1334.64] so if someone's not going to someone's
[1332.96 - 1336.24] not going to get any supplements
[1334.64 - 1337.92] fine right they're not going to be able
[1336.24 - 1339.44] to get any or they're not interested or
[1337.92 - 1340.88] however it is but they're interested in
[1339.44 - 1343.04] one supplement right
[1340.88 - 1344.56] i'd go i would go with one from the top
[1343.04 - 1346.32] four
[1344.56 - 1347.84] and then i would think about what's
[1346.32 - 1351.20] going on in your life
[1347.84 - 1354.32] do you think you're really viral do you
[1351.20 - 1356.16] think you're really viral okay
[1354.32 - 1357.76] so did you look up your symptom did you
[1356.16 - 1360.96] look up your condition did you
[1357.76 - 1362.80] see what's wrong with you because makers
[1360.96 - 1364.64] of the other supplements out there in
[1362.80 - 1365.12] the world like makers of the trendy
[1364.64 - 1367.92] stuff
[1365.12 - 1370.00] of colostrum and collagen and fulvic
[1367.92 - 1372.16] acid or whatever that's out there right
[1370.00 - 1374.08] makers they don't know why you're sick
[1372.16 - 1377.44] but you can find out why you're sick so
[1374.08 - 1377.92] what's wrong with you that matters right
[1377.44 - 1382.00] there
[1377.92 - 1384.16] okay so are you viral
[1382.00 - 1385.92] do you think you got neurological
[1384.16 - 1388.00] fatigue did you did you suffer from
[1385.92 - 1389.20] neurological lyme did you suffer from
[1388.00 - 1390.24] any kind of do you have aches and pains
[1389.20 - 1391.84] you have tingles and numbness that's
[1390.24 - 1393.92] mysterious vertigo anything
[1391.84 - 1395.68] tinnitus ringing in the ears dizziness
[1393.92 - 1398.00] right whatever it is
[1395.68 - 1398.72] because a great one to start with is
[1398.00 - 1401.52] zinc
[1398.72 - 1403.36] that's a great one do you have
[1401.52 - 1404.88] tendonitis do you have restless leg
[1403.36 - 1406.48] syndrome do you have all that kind of
[1404.88 - 1408.00] stuff then you're going into nerves
[1406.48 - 1411.04] neurological so
[1408.00 - 1414.56] you're using zinc to actually help
[1411.04 - 1416.64] with what's causing the nerve problems
[1414.56 - 1418.00] and then if you venture on to a second
[1416.64 - 1420.48] supplement
[1418.00 - 1421.12] it would be like the b12 so the b12
[1420.48 - 1422.88] would be
[1421.12 - 1425.28] the next one because now you're on the
[1422.88 - 1426.88] b12 the b12 is to bring back
[1425.28 - 1428.80] nerves that have been damaged hindered
[1426.88 - 1430.40] by low-grade viruses or anything else
[1428.80 - 1433.12] going on or toxins
[1430.40 - 1434.00] so b12 is another important one you
[1433.12 - 1436.72] could either pick
[1434.00 - 1438.80] either or if like if that was me i'd be
[1436.72 - 1440.80] like okay maybe i'll go with b12 when
[1438.80 - 1441.52] that's over with i'll move to the zinc
[1440.80 - 1444.32] meaning you
[1441.52 - 1445.84] you empty the bottle you used it now hey
[1444.32 - 1448.72] i'll go with the zinc
[1445.84 - 1449.52] and that's an option too by the way it's
[1448.72 - 1452.32] 51
[1449.52 - 1453.60] off amazon.com us it's a medical
[1452.32 - 1459.28] textbook it's packed
[1453.60 - 1461.60] take advantage of it so
[1459.28 - 1464.40] so we're going into the top four i got
[1461.60 - 1467.28] them right here just letting you know
[1464.40 - 1468.08] i got the micro c i got the lemon balm i
[1467.28 - 1471.36] got the zinc
[1468.08 - 1473.68] i got the b12 so we're covering
[1471.36 - 1475.44] this information so one of the very
[1473.68 - 1477.28] important tidbits or pieces of
[1475.44 - 1480.48] information that's critical
[1477.28 - 1483.52] okay is that
[1480.48 - 1486.00] vimergy independently tests for bacteria
[1483.52 - 1488.24] that right there wins me over because
[1486.00 - 1490.16] chlorella
[1488.24 - 1492.32] which doesn't remove toxic heavy metals
[1490.16 - 1494.64] but yet the chlorella machines going out
[1492.32 - 1495.76] there right the marketing the mlm
[1494.64 - 1497.84] and everything else they do for
[1495.76 - 1498.88] chlorella so everybody's on chlorella
[1497.84 - 1500.96] right
[1498.88 - 1502.56] that not only doesn't get metals out to
[1500.96 - 1504.08] take somebody to the finish line
[1502.56 - 1505.92] because that's been out there it never
[1504.08 - 1507.44] got anybody better see they repeat
[1505.92 - 1508.80] history over and over again for the new
[1507.44 - 1512.00] set of suckers
[1508.80 - 1514.08] well chlorella has had bacteria in it
[1512.00 - 1515.60] dangerous bacteria that's really mauled
[1514.08 - 1517.28] a lot of people over the years
[1515.60 - 1519.68] one of the reasons why i never
[1517.28 - 1522.88] recommended it and i stayed
[1519.68 - 1525.12] crazy far away from chlorella
[1522.88 - 1526.00] is i've watched it rip people's guts
[1525.12 - 1528.24] apart
[1526.00 - 1529.84] and set them back for years and
[1528.24 - 1531.60] sometimes never recover
[1529.84 - 1533.44] they've never recovered from the damage
[1531.60 - 1536.32] chlorella did
[1533.44 - 1538.64] and that stuff isn't independently
[1536.32 - 1542.88] tested for bacteria
[1538.64 - 1545.28] so not only is chlorella not the option
[1542.88 - 1547.28] but spirulina is better but then there's
[1545.28 - 1550.40] a question of what spirulina is best
[1547.28 - 1551.36] out there and then it falls onto vimergy
[1550.40 - 1553.44] for the reasons of
[1551.36 - 1554.40] of what they do and the quality of the
[1553.44 - 1557.76] product
[1554.40 - 1559.44] oh my god i'm throwing my chlorella out
[1557.76 - 1561.28] anybody that's a friend or a family
[1559.44 - 1562.88] member or something like a cousin that
[1561.28 - 1565.04] reaches out to me that's like hey can
[1562.88 - 1566.64] you kind of go over my subs with me
[1565.04 - 1568.56] i'm like all right all right let's take
[1566.64 - 1571.36] a look like i'm on chlorella
[1568.56 - 1573.04] are you kidding me my god throw it out
[1571.36 - 1576.32] it scares me actually
[1573.04 - 1579.36] it scares me so um
[1576.32 - 1581.12] let's uh move a little bit more
[1579.36 - 1582.96] let's go back and let's back into the
[1581.12 - 1584.64] top four we're in the top four right now
[1582.96 - 1585.92] why is the top four important let's head
[1584.64 - 1588.64] there now so if you're somebody that can
[1585.92 - 1592.88] get the top four
[1588.64 - 1594.80] you got the vitamin c the micro c
[1592.88 - 1596.72] you got the lemon balm you got the zinc
[1594.80 - 1598.24] you got the b12 so let's cover why why
[1596.72 - 1600.08] would this be in the top four
[1598.24 - 1603.60] it's important enough so if you look
[1600.08 - 1605.28] here in medical medium climbs to heal
[1603.60 - 1607.84] right you'll see what you need to know
[1605.28 - 1611.04] about supplements in here
[1607.84 - 1614.40] and it's a top four for a reason okay
[1611.04 - 1617.68] and because most
[1614.40 - 1622.56] everybody's suffering with symptoms
[1617.68 - 1626.16] that are viral viral related
[1622.56 - 1629.76] toxin related from viruses
[1626.16 - 1632.48] okay so and their nerves
[1629.76 - 1633.28] are giving them symptoms let's go back
[1632.48 - 1635.52] over that
[1633.28 - 1637.36] why is this the best top four most
[1635.52 - 1640.64] people are suffering from
[1637.36 - 1644.40] nerve problems usually caused
[1640.64 - 1647.12] by viral issues aches pains tingles and
[1644.40 - 1650.48] numbness ringing the ears tick spasms
[1647.12 - 1653.76] floaters in the eyes uh dizziness
[1650.48 - 1656.48] vertigo restless leg syndrome
[1653.76 - 1657.28] back pain body pain neck pain and i'm
[1656.48 - 1659.92] gonna explain
[1657.28 - 1661.36] why each one is important and cranial
[1659.92 - 1665.04] nerve problems
[1661.36 - 1668.56] cranial nerve problems right there
[1665.04 - 1671.68] okay there's a method
[1668.56 - 1673.92] to this a method that's
[1671.68 - 1675.04] extremely beneficial and helpful for
[1673.92 - 1677.20] people
[1675.04 - 1679.84] because most people with their migraines
[1677.20 - 1682.32] their aches and pains their dizziness
[1679.84 - 1682.88] they're ringing the ears that's right
[1682.32 - 1685.92] okay
[1682.88 - 1687.52] the floaters in the eyes are dealing
[1685.92 - 1690.40] with problems
[1687.52 - 1692.00] they're dealing with optic nerve issues
[1690.40 - 1692.88] optic neuritis even though it's not
[1692.00 - 1694.80] diagnosed
[1692.88 - 1697.44] people have all these symptoms they're
[1694.80 - 1699.92] dealing with cochlear nerve problems
[1697.44 - 1702.24] their ears they're dealing with all
[1699.92 - 1703.76] migraines trigeminal nerve problems
[1702.24 - 1705.12] pain all on the side of their head the
[1703.76 - 1706.64] side of their face their temple the back
[1705.12 - 1709.84] of their neck the forehead
[1706.64 - 1713.28] all that right they're dealing with
[1709.84 - 1715.20] vagus nerve problems you guys nausea
[1713.28 - 1717.12] tingles and numbness on their arms their
[1715.20 - 1720.56] torso okay
[1717.12 - 1723.12] um tightness of chest high anxiety
[1720.56 - 1725.12] panic right they're dealing with all
[1723.12 - 1727.68] that cranial nervous issue
[1725.12 - 1729.12] issues you guys and by the way makers of
[1727.68 - 1730.88] all the trendy stuff out there don't
[1729.12 - 1731.84] even know about any of this stuff unless
[1730.88 - 1734.80] they pull little
[1731.84 - 1735.44] tidbits from medical medium this is all
[1734.80 - 1737.12] original
[1735.44 - 1739.12] unique information that saved lives
[1737.12 - 1740.56] around the world about cranial nerves
[1739.12 - 1743.92] about the trigeminal nerve and all these
[1740.56 - 1747.36] other issues and viruses causing it
[1743.92 - 1750.56] and metals it's where it originates
[1747.36 - 1753.84] and so what people are dealing with
[1750.56 - 1755.36] so if i walk down the street and spirit
[1753.84 - 1758.08] of compassion is with me
[1755.36 - 1758.56] like always and people are around and be
[1758.08 - 1760.40] like
[1758.56 - 1762.16] trigeminal neuralgia right here they got
[1760.40 - 1763.84] the shingles virus this person has a
[1762.16 - 1765.60] simplex one virus right here
[1763.84 - 1766.96] causing problems with them this person's
[1765.60 - 1769.20] got two epstein bars
[1766.96 - 1770.80] this person's got an hhv6 they're all
[1769.20 - 1772.48] releasing neurotoxins
[1770.80 - 1773.92] this person's got restless legs because
[1772.48 - 1775.76] of it this person's got
[1773.92 - 1777.20] jaw pain because of it teeth pain in the
[1775.76 - 1778.24] back here this person has pain in the
[1777.20 - 1781.52] back of the neck
[1778.24 - 1782.08] because of it and it's all cranial nerve
[1781.52 - 1785.20] stuff
[1782.08 - 1786.72] so the top four there's a reason for the
[1785.20 - 1789.84] top four
[1786.72 - 1790.48] and how important it is baseline i call
[1789.84 - 1794.40] it
[1790.48 - 1797.12] baseline okay the baseline is here
[1794.40 - 1798.80] because of that reason and when you
[1797.12 - 1800.96] learn what's wrong with you it even
[1798.80 - 1804.96] comes more clear right
[1800.96 - 1806.96] so okay let's go a little bit
[1804.96 - 1810.24] let's go a little bit more so let's go
[1806.96 - 1813.76] into why with these let's hit b12
[1810.24 - 1815.36] cranial nerves they get injured they get
[1813.76 - 1818.72] frayed
[1815.36 - 1821.68] they fray like a piece of yarn
[1818.72 - 1823.44] just so you know the migraines the
[1821.68 - 1825.52] trigeminal nerve issues
[1823.44 - 1826.72] all the problems with the nerves okay
[1825.52 - 1828.24] the back pain
[1826.72 - 1830.56] that's that's meaning like the back of
[1828.24 - 1832.32] the neck pain right
[1830.56 - 1833.84] the all the other issues tingles and
[1832.32 - 1835.76] numbness from vegas nerves tightness of
[1833.84 - 1836.64] the chest the panic tightness of the
[1835.76 - 1840.56] throat
[1836.64 - 1842.40] heart palpitations heart palpitations
[1840.56 - 1844.24] all these things from the cranial nerves
[1842.40 - 1848.24] your vagus nerve
[1844.24 - 1851.12] trigeminal nerve right your facial nerve
[1848.24 - 1852.64] facial sensitivities your hair hurts so
[1851.12 - 1856.48] when you pull your hair
[1852.64 - 1859.60] it hurts your scalp right all that
[1856.48 - 1863.32] is those cranial nerves okay
[1859.60 - 1864.48] fatigue neurological fatigue where it's
[1863.32 - 1866.96] unexplainable
[1864.48 - 1868.88] i'm tired every day i can't really push
[1866.96 - 1872.32] through my energy is not there
[1868.88 - 1874.32] cranial nerves that's why the b12 is so
[1872.32 - 1876.32] important it's in the top four
[1874.32 - 1877.92] that's november gb12 if you guys just
[1876.32 - 1878.72] got on here watch this live from the
[1877.92 - 1881.12] beginning again
[1878.72 - 1882.56] on youtube if you want okay and tick
[1881.12 - 1884.08] tock if you guys just got on there watch
[1882.56 - 1886.64] it live on youtube if you want
[1884.08 - 1887.52] and that's why the b12 is important why
[1886.64 - 1890.56] this b12
[1887.52 - 1892.00] and not another b12 okay
[1890.56 - 1893.44] i'm gonna give you the rundown about
[1892.00 - 1895.52] that too it's a combination of
[1893.44 - 1898.32] methylcobalamin and adenosine cobalamin
[1895.52 - 1901.60] the combination that makes a difference
[1898.32 - 1904.64] it doesn't have hydroxycobalamin in it
[1901.60 - 1906.64] because that one messes up the other
[1904.64 - 1908.72] two and people don't realize it doesn't
[1906.64 - 1909.36] have a cya cobalamin in it because that
[1908.72 - 1912.56] one
[1909.36 - 1915.04] doesn't absorb so
[1912.56 - 1916.48] when it comes down to the right b12 it
[1915.04 - 1918.64] matters to healing nerves now what does
[1916.48 - 1922.16] b12 do for the nerves
[1918.64 - 1925.84] it helps repair them nerve cells
[1922.16 - 1928.48] need b12 or they can't repair
[1925.84 - 1930.24] they can't repair they can't repair you
[1928.48 - 1934.08] can't repair those cranial nerves
[1930.24 - 1935.20] without b12 being able to be there to
[1934.08 - 1937.60] repair
[1935.20 - 1939.28] okay let's move on a little bit let's
[1937.60 - 1943.68] hit zinc
[1939.28 - 1946.08] zinc stops the cytokine storms from the
[1943.68 - 1951.36] flu
[1946.08 - 1954.32] stops the storms from the plague
[1951.36 - 1955.44] zinc stops the cytokine storms but it
[1954.32 - 1957.16] also
[1955.44 - 1958.64] stops your immune system from getting
[1957.16 - 1961.28] overreactive
[1958.64 - 1962.00] and under reactive and everybody's
[1961.28 - 1963.84] immune system
[1962.00 - 1966.00] is either overreactive or underreactive
[1963.84 - 1967.12] overreactive or unreactive overreactive
[1966.00 - 1968.88] or underactive then that's what
[1967.12 - 1971.92] everybody's immune system is
[1968.88 - 1973.76] and that's why the zinc matters
[1971.92 - 1975.92] we're all deficient in zinc one way or
[1973.76 - 1977.44] another we're all deficient because the
[1975.92 - 1978.96] crops don't have it
[1977.44 - 1980.64] and if you think pumpkin seeds is going
[1978.96 - 1982.88] to give you enough zinc and an oyster is
[1980.64 - 1984.40] going to give you a zinc you're mistaken
[1982.88 - 1986.80] there's very little zinc in that to
[1984.40 - 1988.16] begin with which leads me to the other
[1986.80 - 1989.68] trend that's happening now is like
[1988.16 - 1992.24] oyster related
[1989.68 - 1996.24] products now it's real smart let's take
[1992.24 - 1999.12] the most polluted thing out of the ocean
[1996.24 - 2002.08] fill the dioxins and toxic heavy metals
[1999.12 - 2004.52] and let's make it into a supplement
[2002.08 - 2005.84] that's what i mean though there's no
[2004.52 - 2008.24] sensibility
[2005.84 - 2009.76] it's almost like it's anybody and
[2008.24 - 2011.92] everybody has lost their mind when it
[2009.76 - 2014.72] comes down to stuff out there
[2011.92 - 2016.32] and it's sad you know you were chugging
[2014.72 - 2018.08] oysters laugh out loud chris were you
[2016.32 - 2019.76] chugging oysters because of just you
[2018.08 - 2023.36] liked oysters at the time
[2019.76 - 2023.36] or was it because you wanted the zinc
[2023.44 - 2027.12] okay anyway this is the most gentle
[2026.56 - 2031.44] thing
[2027.12 - 2034.08] the liquid sulfate but stabilized
[2031.44 - 2034.64] and that's the difference right there so
[2034.08 - 2037.28] that
[2034.64 - 2039.60] so why is the zinc important and why do
[2037.28 - 2044.56] you want to keep your immune system
[2039.60 - 2044.56] level because it's up against pathogens
[2044.80 - 2049.12] in our immune systems is up against
[2047.28 - 2051.44] pathogens that's why
[2049.12 - 2053.04] we're up against the epstein bars the
[2051.44 - 2055.76] simplex one
[2053.04 - 2057.60] right people have to understand some
[2055.76 - 2060.16] you've ever had fever blister
[2057.60 - 2060.88] and it went away the virus didn't go
[2060.16 - 2064.48] away
[2060.88 - 2064.48] the virus sits in the cranial nerves
[2064.56 - 2068.80] virus sits in the liver that's where the
[2067.60 - 2071.44] virus sits
[2068.80 - 2072.80] and it creates other symptoms along the
[2071.44 - 2074.00] way and then you're starting to get all
[2072.80 - 2076.24] these other symptoms and you're like
[2074.00 - 2078.00] well wait a minute what is going on here
[2076.24 - 2080.80] and zinc's critical
[2078.00 - 2083.12] for stopping that from happening so the
[2080.80 - 2083.60] little bugs that create the simplex one
[2083.12 - 2087.52] and
[2083.60 - 2088.64] all the different bugs it actually helps
[2087.52 - 2090.08] you know there's people out there that
[2088.64 - 2091.36] get the worst debilitating set of
[2090.08 - 2094.08] shingles
[2091.36 - 2096.48] they could ever even imagine making them
[2094.08 - 2100.48] almost want to commit suicide
[2096.48 - 2102.80] shingles being so so harsh so bad
[2100.48 - 2104.16] right a version of it so bad like
[2102.80 - 2105.04] ripping through their neck their mouth
[2104.16 - 2107.28] their face
[2105.04 - 2108.96] some really bad shingles out there and
[2107.28 - 2110.56] if they only had enough zinc in them or
[2108.96 - 2111.84] the right kind of zinc along the way if
[2110.56 - 2113.52] they only knew how to take care of
[2111.84 - 2116.48] themselves what foods not to eat having
[2113.52 - 2118.64] the right sink
[2116.48 - 2121.12] it's so sad i've seen a lot of sad sad
[2118.64 - 2122.72] sad situations
[2121.12 - 2125.36] all right let's move on to lemon balm
[2122.72 - 2126.64] why would lemon balm be in the top four
[2125.36 - 2129.72] guys if she just came on i'm talking
[2126.64 - 2130.88] about vemma g2 them rgbs and victor
[2129.72 - 2132.32] imergy.com
[2130.88 - 2134.56] if you watch the beginning of this video
[2132.32 - 2135.76] you'll see the reasons why vimergy is
[2134.56 - 2137.68] far surpassed
[2135.76 - 2139.36] supreme over anything else out there and
[2137.68 - 2140.48] i'm not sponsored by vimergy
[2139.36 - 2143.36] very important no and i'm not a
[2140.48 - 2146.00] shareholder of energy
[2143.36 - 2146.40] it's critical to know this stuff so why
[2146.00 - 2150.24] would
[2146.40 - 2153.92] lemon balm be in the top for everybody
[2150.24 - 2157.92] because of stress
[2153.92 - 2158.48] because everybody's nerves are frazzled
[2157.92 - 2161.68] because
[2158.48 - 2165.04] everybody's nerves are inflamed
[2161.68 - 2167.12] that's why they're sick
[2165.04 - 2168.88] their nerves are inflamed all your
[2167.12 - 2170.88] mystery symptoms that you get
[2168.88 - 2172.08] throughout the body many of them are
[2170.88 - 2176.32] because your nerves are
[2172.08 - 2178.88] inflamed the cranial nerves are inflamed
[2176.32 - 2178.88] that's why
[2179.76 - 2186.56] pertinent information beyond and
[2183.04 - 2188.08] lemon bomb right
[2186.56 - 2189.60] it does two things one thing is
[2188.08 - 2193.20] antiviral
[2189.60 - 2193.92] it's an antiviral very important when
[2193.20 - 2195.92] used as an
[2193.92 - 2198.40] antiviral the other thing is because of
[2195.92 - 2200.00] the nerves it's an antibacterial too
[2198.40 - 2201.84] what i love about is a lot of people
[2200.00 - 2204.08] though have the strep bacteria causing
[2201.84 - 2204.72] utis causing conjunctivitis causing
[2204.08 - 2207.28] styes
[2204.72 - 2209.20] causing chronic sinusitis causing
[2207.28 - 2210.40] chronic ear infections causing lung
[2209.20 - 2213.60] infections they'll have
[2210.40 - 2214.32] strep bacterial vaginosis bv they'll
[2213.60 - 2217.36] have
[2214.32 - 2217.84] shrek what i like about it being in the
[2217.36 - 2221.68] top
[2217.84 - 2223.28] four what i love about that
[2221.68 - 2225.68] is people are walking around with strep
[2223.28 - 2228.00] bacteria all through them
[2225.68 - 2229.36] and limb bombs a great antibacterial for
[2228.00 - 2234.48] the strap
[2229.36 - 2237.60] but it's also an incredible nervine
[2234.48 - 2239.76] it's an incredible nerve calmer
[2237.60 - 2241.12] it's what i love about it soothes the
[2239.76 - 2244.56] vagus nerve
[2241.12 - 2246.64] the vagus nerve think behind so many
[2244.56 - 2248.40] people's suffering
[2246.64 - 2251.84] that's why it's in the top four that's
[2248.40 - 2254.56] why it's part of the baseline
[2251.84 - 2254.88] and let's move on to and here's the
[2254.56 - 2257.36] thing
[2254.88 - 2258.72] okay here's the thing people would be
[2257.36 - 2259.12] like oh i'll go look for a lemon bomb
[2258.72 - 2260.48] then
[2259.12 - 2261.92] i don't want to get the vimerage you
[2260.48 - 2263.52] want because all because all the
[2261.92 - 2265.28] marketers are coming out now use our
[2263.52 - 2267.20] lemon balm use our lemon balm because
[2265.28 - 2268.80] aw is talking about lemon balm we know
[2267.20 - 2270.56] that we can do a with the sharks can
[2268.80 - 2272.88] come in and do a feeding frenzy
[2270.56 - 2274.00] just go on to his his platform and just
[2272.88 - 2276.16] be like pushing there's
[2274.00 - 2277.12] another b12 push another liquid zinc on
[2276.16 - 2279.20] somebody
[2277.12 - 2280.88] and get people enticed the bots will
[2279.20 - 2282.40] come out the paid bots will come out
[2280.88 - 2285.92] left and right
[2282.40 - 2287.92] right and but they don't realize yeah
[2285.92 - 2288.96] guess what and you get that other lemon
[2287.92 - 2291.28] balm
[2288.96 - 2293.84] and they'll be a small percentage of an
[2291.28 - 2295.84] ingredient that you don't know about
[2293.84 - 2297.52] that's not good for you that's inside
[2295.84 - 2300.08] that lemon balm
[2297.52 - 2300.72] because the supplement companies all
[2300.08 - 2304.24] have to
[2300.72 - 2307.28] abide by some evil rule
[2304.24 - 2309.36] that you can that that the suppliers
[2307.28 - 2312.24] that the manufacturers
[2309.36 - 2313.20] put things in there nobody knows about
[2312.24 - 2316.40] and members just say
[2313.20 - 2317.60] uh-uh not gonna happen not gonna happen
[2316.40 - 2319.76] with vimergy
[2317.60 - 2322.32] there's no way we're letting anything in
[2319.76 - 2324.88] here that can hide
[2322.32 - 2326.48] and not have to be recognized and that's
[2324.88 - 2328.40] why and that's one reason plus the lemon
[2326.48 - 2332.08] balm they source is
[2328.40 - 2334.24] the best through the roof move on
[2332.08 - 2337.20] deanna says i watch so many of these
[2334.24 - 2339.84] lives and they are invaluable with info
[2337.20 - 2341.60] but this is what so many need so they
[2339.84 - 2343.76] can just start i know
[2341.60 - 2345.20] i don't know i'm honored to hear deanna
[2343.76 - 2348.96] seriously
[2345.20 - 2351.44] so vitamin c all right here we are
[2348.96 - 2354.08] vitamin c is in the top four because
[2351.44 - 2356.48] it's still that important
[2354.08 - 2358.32] it's still that important without
[2356.48 - 2361.76] vitamin c
[2358.32 - 2364.56] we die but that brings me back to
[2361.76 - 2367.28] without b12 we died
[2364.56 - 2368.88] without b12 or vitamin c we die did you
[2367.28 - 2372.80] know that
[2368.88 - 2376.96] scurvy was a real thing okay
[2372.80 - 2380.40] without any fruit or a squeeze of lemon
[2376.96 - 2382.56] or squeeze of lime or an orange too many
[2380.40 - 2384.64] years going by
[2382.56 - 2385.84] without any kind of fruit without a
[2384.64 - 2388.00] berry without an
[2385.84 - 2389.84] apple too many years too many months
[2388.00 - 2392.56] going by
[2389.84 - 2394.48] without fresh vegetables that also have
[2392.56 - 2396.80] some vitamin c in there right
[2394.48 - 2398.64] vitamin c if you take out any vegetable
[2396.80 - 2400.24] whatsoever and you take out ever if you
[2398.64 - 2404.08] just lived off of only
[2400.24 - 2405.60] canned meat and only canned meat and
[2404.08 - 2406.88] this isn't an anti-meat campaign because
[2405.60 - 2408.24] i'm pro-animal protein and i'm
[2406.88 - 2409.68] pro-plant-based if you're plant-based
[2408.24 - 2410.96] steak plant-based
[2409.68 - 2413.28] if your animal protein that's what you
[2410.96 - 2416.56] like to stay for animal protein
[2413.28 - 2418.32] but just learn the tools so you can heal
[2416.56 - 2419.84] because i'm not on one side of the aisle
[2418.32 - 2421.44] or another because it ain't about that
[2419.84 - 2422.96] you can be sick when you're vegan
[2421.44 - 2424.24] you can be sick as a dog when you're
[2422.96 - 2426.48] plant-based and you could be sick as a
[2424.24 - 2428.40] dog as a keto dude
[2426.48 - 2429.92] maybe sick as a dog as an animal protein
[2428.40 - 2431.44] person
[2429.92 - 2432.80] that's why animal protein diets have
[2431.44 - 2434.56] incorporated so much medical medium
[2432.80 - 2435.92] information by now it's unbelievable and
[2434.56 - 2437.28] it's sickening too watch because they
[2435.92 - 2438.32] won't say anything back to medical
[2437.28 - 2440.56] medium we'll just
[2438.32 - 2441.84] oh oh we better bring in that now
[2440.56 - 2443.20] because medical medium has a record of
[2441.84 - 2444.80] getting more people better than we've
[2443.20 - 2446.48] ever seen we better bring this into our
[2444.80 - 2449.12] new diet
[2446.48 - 2451.28] the vitamin c is critical right without
[2449.12 - 2454.56] it if you lived off of canned meat
[2451.28 - 2456.32] and only canned meat it would be
[2454.56 - 2457.60] devastating
[2456.32 - 2458.88] if you lived okay let's just say
[2457.60 - 2461.12] something else let's say something else
[2458.88 - 2464.80] that has no vitamin c in it
[2461.12 - 2464.80] what if you lived off of canned
[2464.88 - 2471.44] mushrooms or can you lived off of
[2468.88 - 2472.96] canned uh something that doesn't know
[2471.44 - 2474.48] vitamin c just canned beans
[2472.96 - 2475.76] it's okay say you're not an animal
[2474.48 - 2476.88] protein person and you're not gonna do
[2475.76 - 2478.48] canned meat
[2476.88 - 2480.56] a little of canned beans just canned
[2478.48 - 2484.24] beans only but only
[2480.56 - 2486.24] be devastating because you
[2484.24 - 2487.68] you would lose all your vitamin c to the
[2486.24 - 2489.12] point where you would just go down with
[2487.68 - 2491.36] the ship just like they did in the old
[2489.12 - 2491.36] days
[2493.36 - 2498.24] so question mark emma says why can't we
[2496.48 - 2499.76] use supplements on the mono cleanse
[2498.24 - 2502.00] you can you can use supplements on the
[2499.76 - 2504.80] mono cleanse you can
[2502.00 - 2507.28] um emma do you have the book read the
[2504.80 - 2509.68] mono cleanse section

[2509.68 - 2513.36] to jump like

[2536.88 - 2544.64] am as mary e rgy.com so vimergy.com
[2541.76 - 2546.56] that's where you get these all right so
[2544.64 - 2548.96] vitamin c is that important so
[2546.56 - 2550.00] what makes this vitamin c better than
[2548.96 - 2551.68] you why do i hold
[2550.00 - 2553.36] this vitamin c because i can hold
[2551.68 - 2555.04] anybody's vitamin c
[2553.36 - 2556.80] if there's an incredible vitamin c out

[2556.80 - 2561.12] guys
[2558.08 - 2564.32] but there isn't one that matches this
[2561.12 - 2567.44] the others are like battery acid
[2564.32 - 2569.28] that's the problem that's the problem
[2567.44 - 2571.68] like battery acid you got sensitive
[2569.28 - 2573.04] tummy that stuff will just burn your
[2571.68 - 2575.84] stomach
[2573.04 - 2577.44] it's hard on the system vitamin c's the
[2575.84 - 2578.00] heart on the system and i know a lot of
[2577.44 - 2579.44] you guys know
[2578.00 - 2582.88] this i bet you a lot of you guys have
[2579.44 - 2585.52] tried vitamin c's and they're hard
[2582.88 - 2586.80] they're hard and this is the one that's
[2585.52 - 2589.20] gentle the microc
[2586.80 - 2590.88] is a whole different combination
[2589.20 - 2594.16] different make and model
[2590.88 - 2596.00] one that's it it it the others are
[2594.16 - 2596.64] antiquated compared to so that's why i
[2596.00 - 2598.48] love that
[2596.64 - 2600.40] i could take more of it so when i take
[2598.48 - 2601.68] vitamin c you know i take six capsules
[2600.40 - 2602.24] three times a day right that's what i'll
[2601.68 - 2603.76] do
[2602.24 - 2605.36] six capsules three times and i saw
[2603.76 - 2608.48] somebody in the comment section

[2743.76 - 2746.96] if you're if you're on a tight budget
[2746.16 - 2751.28] it's worth
[2746.96 - 2753.92] thinking about the top four
[2751.28 - 2755.60] okay if you're on a tight budget you're
[2753.92 - 2758.80] gonna buy just one supplements worth
[2755.60 - 2760.64] picking one out of the top four
[2758.80 - 2763.52] so why is vitamin c important let's go
[2760.64 - 2765.36] into it because it is a great antiviral
[2763.52 - 2766.80] viruses hate vitamin c and if you have
[2765.36 - 2767.76] enough vitamin c floating through your
[2766.80 - 2769.20] bloodstream
[2767.76 - 2772.00] floating through your bloodstream but
[2769.20 - 2774.88] not vitamin c floating through there
[2772.00 - 2776.48] then you're gonna protect yourself it's
[2774.88 - 2780.64] great protection
[2776.48 - 2781.92] also cells need vitamin c to thrive
[2780.64 - 2784.24] so all the different cells throughout
[2781.92 - 2788.64] our body brain cells everything
[2784.24 - 2792.48] need vitamin c to thrive
[2788.64 - 2794.40] important now selena we so are my life

[2832.48 - 2836.32] i want you to read what you need to know
[2834.80 - 2837.60] about supplements if you don't have the
[2836.32 - 2840.32] medical medium book
[2837.60 - 2841.68] cleanse the heal please consider getting
[2840.32 - 2842.80] it try to get it free at the library if
[2841.68 - 2845.52] you can't buy it
[2842.80 - 2848.16] but it's 51 off at amazon.com it's a
[2845.52 - 2849.92] price that can't be beat right now
[2848.16 - 2852.24] it's insane really that price it costs
[2849.92 - 2854.08] more to print out the book
[2852.24 - 2855.60] details matter and they're in there so
[2854.08 - 2856.56] let's go a little bit we'll go a little
[2855.60 - 2859.44] bit further so
[2856.56 - 2860.56] there's a question out there one
[2859.44 - 2863.36] question is
[2860.56 - 2865.76] how come psychobala mean you're not
[2863.36 - 2867.44] talking about that type of coenzyme that
[2865.76 - 2869.52] b12 how come you're not talking about
[2867.44 - 2870.72] that b12 one is it doesn't absorb that's
[2869.52 - 2874.16] the bad b12
[2870.72 - 2877.28] that's the b12 that's in b12 shots
[2874.16 - 2880.32] that doesn't work that's the b12
[2877.28 - 2882.24] that's in crappy b12 supplements
[2880.32 - 2883.60] and just because you might find the
[2882.24 - 2884.72] adenosine kabbalah man and the
[2883.60 - 2886.56] methicobalamin
[2884.72 - 2887.92] the good b12 and another supplement
[2886.56 - 2889.84] doesn't mean there's not that hidden
[2887.92 - 2891.36] junk i told you about plus fillers plus
[2889.84 - 2894.56] alcohol and everything else
[2891.36 - 2896.64] and natural flavors and msg
[2894.56 - 2897.92] so and this one doesn't have that and
[2896.64 - 2900.00] that's the bemrg one
[2897.92 - 2901.44] okay that's the vimergy b12 that i was
[2900.00 - 2903.60] just talking about right
[2901.44 - 2903.60] but
[2905.04 - 2908.40] bad supplements give supplements a bad
[2907.20 - 2912.56] name
[2908.40 - 2915.12] that's how it works bad cleanses
[2912.56 - 2915.76] give cleanse cleanses a bad name all
[2915.12 - 2918.40] right
[2915.76 - 2920.40] couple questions so why don't you talk
[2918.40 - 2921.52] about cyocobalamin first of all that
[2920.40 - 2924.88] stuff was
[2921.52 - 2926.64] the conventional b12 the really bad
[2924.88 - 2930.24] stuff that was in the b12
[2926.64 - 2932.24] patches 20 years ago so if you wanted to
[2930.24 - 2934.80] go to a store and you wanted to buy a
[2932.24 - 2936.40] b12 supplement they had b12 patches so
[2934.80 - 2937.84] you would buy the b12 patches they had
[2936.40 - 2941.04] silocobalamin in it
[2937.84 - 2943.84] and it didn't work it doesn't work and
[2941.04 - 2945.52] it's toxic
[2943.84 - 2947.20] so if anybody is like no sila
[2945.52 - 2948.32] cobalamin's the best because i saw that
[2947.20 - 2949.68] in the comments too
[2948.32 - 2951.44] so i think that the youtube comment is
[2949.68 - 2953.60] like solid kabbalah is there like oh my
[2951.44 - 2956.00] god what planet are we on
[2953.60 - 2957.92] like who's telling people this stuff
[2956.00 - 2959.68] that it's the best
[2957.92 - 2962.64] this stuff was not only toxic that was
[2959.68 - 2964.24] conventional medicine's bad b12 that was
[2962.64 - 2965.28] the one that doesn't even absorb that's
[2964.24 - 2968.00] the one in the b12
[2965.28 - 2971.84] shot that poisons people that's
[2968.00 - 2971.84] sayakabalamin is the bad one
[2972.16 - 2975.28] and once again it's people who don't
[2973.52 - 2976.88] know why anybody's sick that talks about
[2975.28 - 2978.80] it and once again it's like these
[2976.88 - 2980.48] this history comes back to haunt us
[2978.80 - 2982.32] because we don't know about the history
[2980.48 - 2983.84] so it comes back and we get involved in
[2982.32 - 2985.60] it and then we become that person that's
[2983.84 - 2986.96] like whoa cytobalam and that's the one
[2985.60 - 2988.64] to use and you're like whoa you just did
[2986.96 - 2989.60] everybody a disservice even mentioning
[2988.64 - 2990.96] that
[2989.60 - 2993.24] okay so let's get into the next thing
[2990.96 - 2995.44] here's the question right here
[2993.24 - 2997.44] methylfolate so vimergy's got a
[2995.44 - 2999.36] methylfolate right
[2997.44 - 3001.44] they got a methylfolate and people are
[2999.36 - 3004.40] like well don't you take folate with
[3001.44 - 3006.00] b12 don't you take folate with
[3004.40 - 3008.72] methylcobalamin
[3006.00 - 3010.84] yeah it's great to take together it's
[3008.72 - 3012.00] great to not you don't have to take them
[3010.84 - 3014.08] together
[3012.00 - 3016.40] it's great to take them together
[3014.08 - 3019.04] methylfolate is important
[3016.40 - 3021.52] it is but you can also get benefits from
[3019.04 - 3024.56] b12 without methyl folate
[3021.52 - 3025.20] they don't have to be together dr fahn
[3024.56 - 3028.48] yeah
[3025.20 - 3029.92] psychobalan is the bad stuff
[3028.48 - 3031.92] so that's the answer that question
[3029.92 - 3033.28] that's out there right

[3222.40 - 3228.64] that's why it's part of the topic people
[3225.52 - 3231.76] can get better they can
[3228.64 - 3233.76] they can and they don't have to try to
[3231.76 - 3234.96] experiment with a zeolite or a fulvic
[3233.76 - 3237.92] acid or a
[3234.96 - 3240.64] collagen to do so or a bentonite clay or
[3237.92 - 3244.24] a charcoal powder or a fish oil oh my
[3240.64 - 3244.24] god or a probiotic oh my god
[3248.84 - 3254.00] okay
[3250.80 - 3257.84] you know people get flu
[3254.00 - 3259.84] people get flus all year long
[3257.84 - 3262.40] they get flus all year long and they're
[3259.84 - 3263.84] they're they're beaten down by viruses
[3262.40 - 3265.92] well people are sick with chronic
[3263.84 - 3268.44] illness speak like autoimmune because of
[3265.92 - 3273.36] all these other viruses herpetic viruses
[3268.44 - 3276.72] cytomegalovirus the h86hv7 hhv9
[3273.36 - 3278.40] 10 through 16 undiscovered over 60
[3276.72 - 3280.72] varieties of epstein bar over 30
[3278.40 - 3282.56] varieties of shingles mm information but
[3280.72 - 3283.92] all these different viruses and that's
[3282.56 - 3285.28] why people are sick just like when
[3283.92 - 3286.56] people get the flu virus they're sick
[3285.28 - 3289.44] from the flu virus when they're sick
[3286.56 - 3289.44] from the flu virus
[3291.20 - 3295.36] so lysine's a good part of that one so
[3292.96 - 3298.16] let's go into the next one
[3295.36 - 3299.12] curcumin right first of all dimmer zeke
[3298.16 - 3301.04] curcumin
[3299.12 - 3302.64] far surpasses the others i won't bore us
[3301.04 - 3303.28] with like details about that already
[3302.64 - 3304.80] given
[3303.28 - 3306.32] so many reasons why the quality is off
[3304.80 - 3308.96] the chart right
[3306.32 - 3311.52] but what i love about curcumin because
[3308.96 - 3313.20] it acts like a natural aspirin
[3311.52 - 3315.44] people are inflamed and it's like a
[3313.20 - 3317.20] natural aspirin
[3315.44 - 3319.52] jennifer smith says i can't get my son
[3317.20 - 3320.00] to do heavy metal detox so i was hoping
[3319.52 - 3322.72] zeolite
[3320.00 - 3324.00] might be a doable compromise jennifer if
[3322.72 - 3326.08] that was my son i wouldn't be playing
[3324.00 - 3328.32] with zeolite
[3326.08 - 3329.68] i wouldn't the zeolite train came into
[3328.32 - 3331.44] town
[3329.68 - 3333.12] many years ago and died out and
[3331.44 - 3335.20] disappeared for a reason
[3333.12 - 3338.00] and now it's back in town to hitch a
[3335.20 - 3340.40] ride onto the heavy metal detox movie
[3338.00 - 3341.92] and and you can do what you want do what
[3340.40 - 3344.24] your doctor tells you right
[3341.92 - 3345.44] for your son if it was my son i wouldn't
[3344.24 - 3346.48] be doing zeolite and i'll tell you one
[3345.44 - 3348.64] of the reasons is because there's a
[3346.48 - 3351.76] whole bunch of zeolites
[3348.64 - 3352.64] that are not edible and they get mixed
[3351.76 - 3354.24] and dusted
[3352.64 - 3355.60] do you guys know about this i want you i
[3354.24 - 3357.28] want to ask you guys a question this
[3355.60 - 3358.96] will tell me how much you guys also know
[3357.28 - 3362.24] what seasoned or not right
[3358.96 - 3366.16] do you guys know this ready
[3362.24 - 3369.84] if you're eating a gluten-free product
[3366.16 - 3371.92] right that's made in a factory
[3369.84 - 3374.40] that they also make products that have
[3371.92 - 3376.40] gluten they have to forewarn you right
[3374.40 - 3377.76] because the gluten-free product gets
[3376.40 - 3380.96] dusted
[3377.76 - 3383.44] by the not by the by the gluten product
[3380.96 - 3385.60] you guys know that right so glute like
[3383.44 - 3388.80] gluten-free breads
[3385.60 - 3392.32] are made right or they're made in
[3388.80 - 3393.84] factories a lot of times with gluten
[3392.32 - 3395.76] breads
[3393.84 - 3397.12] so even though the gluten-free breads is
[3395.76 - 3400.00] gluten-free it's
[3397.12 - 3401.52] also it's the same thing with like nuts
[3400.00 - 3402.32] if people have nut allergies they have
[3401.52 - 3404.24] to list
[3402.32 - 3406.48] nut allergies because it's processed in
[3404.24 - 3407.28] a plant where they're also doing nuts
[3406.48 - 3410.08] right
[3407.28 - 3411.12] and then the nut dust is going on top of
[3410.08 - 3412.88] the other product
[3411.12 - 3414.72] that you think there's no nuts in you
[3412.88 - 3417.68] guys know this right
[3414.72 - 3418.32] anybody know this it's important you got
[3417.68 - 3421.44] it
[3418.32 - 3423.36] zabo you got it cross contamination
[3421.44 - 3424.80] well that's the zeolite world and
[3423.36 - 3426.88] there's a bunch of zeolites that are
[3424.80 - 3429.04] like asbestos you cannot actually
[3426.88 - 3431.52] swallow it or eat it it's not diges
[3429.04 - 3435.12] it's not it's it's actually a hindrance
[3431.52 - 3437.92] to the colon intestinal tract
[3435.12 - 3439.84] so there's zeolites you cannot ingest on
[3437.92 - 3442.64] any level but they're also
[3439.84 - 3444.08] dusted on top of zeolites you can ingest
[3442.64 - 3446.08] and nobody knows the difference because
[3444.08 - 3448.56] it's not monitored
[3446.08 - 3449.84] it's why one of the reasons why i'm done
[3448.56 - 3454.00] with zoi
[3449.84 - 3456.40] done done done but guess what
[3454.00 - 3458.24] the admin paid by the zeolite company
[3456.40 - 3458.96] zeolites back in town zeolite trains
[3458.24 - 3460.56] back town
[3458.96 - 3462.88] and they see that the heavy metal detox
[3460.56 - 3464.80] movie has saved a lot of lives the mlm
[3462.88 - 3466.32] world has come back into town with their
[3464.80 - 3467.12] zeolites and they see that the medical
[3466.32 - 3469.28] medium
[3467.12 - 3470.96] heavy metal detox smoothie is famous now
[3469.28 - 3471.44] it's in all the juice bars around the
[3470.96 - 3473.76] world
[3471.44 - 3474.72] everybody talks about it it's worldwide
[3473.76 - 3476.96] famous
[3474.72 - 3479.20] and it gets metals out and then the
[3476.96 - 3481.12] zeolite world said hey you got to take
[3479.20 - 3482.00] the zeolite with the heavy metal detox
[3481.12 - 3483.92] smoothie
[3482.00 - 3487.60] but your benefits are coming from our
[3483.92 - 3489.12] zeolite that's where it's coming from
[3487.60 - 3492.48] do you know do you do you know anything
[3489.12 - 3495.84] any more disgusting than that
[3492.48 - 3499.04] no and that's how it works
[3495.84 - 3502.24] there's no regulatory regulations
[3499.04 - 3504.56] on mixing the zeolite clays
[3502.24 - 3506.32] there's zeolites in the earth that are
[3504.56 - 3507.04] mined out of the earth that are used for
[3506.32 - 3508.80] industries
[3507.04 - 3510.40] and they're getting cross-contaminated
[3508.80 - 3513.04] with zeolite that's ingestible
[3510.40 - 3514.48] and nobody knows it so when we take your
[3513.04 - 3517.84] zeolite products
[3514.48 - 3521.12] it's dusted from bad stuff
[3517.84 - 3523.44] is dr nesbit coming on aw

[3542.56 - 3548.56] almost 10 of that bottle has something
[3545.28 - 3551.84] you don't even know that's in there
[3548.56 - 3553.60] and that's how it goes boom
[3551.84 - 3556.16] this is what it is all right talked
[3553.60 - 3558.16] about what i love about the curcumin
[3556.16 - 3559.20] it acts as a natural aspirin so many
[3558.16 - 3562.32] people are hurting
[3559.20 - 3565.52] they're hurting okay and curcumin
[3562.32 - 3568.08] cumin is anti-bug too
[3565.52 - 3568.56] it's anti-bug for like basic bugs and
[3568.08 - 3570.48] stuff
[3568.56 - 3572.48] right basic one staff and things like
[3570.48 - 3574.64] that and all that curcumin's actually
[3572.48 - 3575.52] it's great but it but i like it because
[3574.64 - 3578.00] it has
[3575.52 - 3580.08] a calming effect it is phytochemical
[3578.00 - 3583.76] compounds that soothe
[3580.08 - 3585.36] nerves and muscles and i like that this
[3583.76 - 3586.72] one doesn't have additives fillers
[3585.36 - 3588.00] doesn't have alcohol doesn't have all
[3586.72 - 3589.68] that other junk in it
[3588.00 - 3590.96] everything else citric acid that's in
[3589.68 - 3591.52] all the other supplements so let's go
[3590.96 - 3593.60] into
[3591.52 - 3598.16] this is incredible quality it's not just
[3593.60 - 3598.16] any curcumin let's go into one more

[3618.24 - 3622.96] metals
[3619.52 - 3625.28] but it's so nutrient dense

[3640.56 - 3643.28] crack open a melon i'm going to talk
[3641.84 - 3644.72] about spirulina
[3643.28 - 3646.08] maybe in the barley grasses but let's
[3644.72 - 3646.72] before we go right to there because i
[3646.08 - 3648.88] know we're
[3646.72 - 3652.40] we've got still a couple minutes i
[3648.88 - 3655.44] talked about celery force the other day
[3652.40 - 3659.36] and someone left a comment and said
[3655.44 - 3661.60] he's got to be kidding i wasn't kidding
[3659.36 - 3663.44] when i first took the product it happens
[3661.60 - 3666.80] every day when i take the product
[3663.44 - 3668.16] in like eight minutes i was cleaning out
[3666.80 - 3668.96] my freezer i wanted to clean up my
[3668.16 - 3671.28] freezer
[3668.96 - 3672.56] and clarity came like i've never it was
[3671.28 - 3675.68] like almost
[3672.56 - 3678.08] it was bizarre this clarity that came
[3675.68 - 3680.48] and because it's got the inositol the
[3678.08 - 3683.60] right kind of blend of inositol in there
[3680.48 - 3685.04] and it woke me up i had something like a
[3683.60 - 3686.24] couple hours of sleep that night i was
[3685.04 - 3688.08] working all night and everything and
[3686.24 - 3690.96] then i was up in the morning
[3688.08 - 3692.24] and i was cranky right and i took the
[3690.96 - 3694.72] celery force
[3692.24 - 3697.20] and it was like someone played a joke on
[3694.72 - 3699.04] me it was almost like not only was i
[3697.20 - 3701.76] alive and awake but i had
[3699.04 - 3703.44] clarity in the in the most strangest
[3701.76 - 3705.36] sense ever and
[3703.44 - 3707.04] and it was like also i had to clean the
[3705.36 - 3707.84] freezer cleaned out i had you know in a
[3707.04 - 3710.32] whole bit
[3707.84 - 3711.68] and that's something that's just
[3710.32 - 3712.80] mind-blowing i don't know if anybody
[3711.68 - 3714.64] else is hooked on
[3712.80 - 3716.00] celery force but i've been hooked on it
[3714.64 - 3718.64] ever since from
[3716.00 - 3720.08] from it's incredible for the adhd all
[3718.64 - 3721.04] that stuff that people have
[3720.08 - 3722.72] i'm hearing about it all the time
[3721.04 - 3724.00] anybody that has adhd when they're on
[3722.72 - 3726.40] celery for like
[3724.00 - 3728.80] why is it clearing up adhd there's no
[3726.40 - 3730.48] celery in it by the way
[3728.80 - 3732.96] katie says between my celery juice and
[3730.48 - 3734.80] the morning and celery force i can think
[3732.96 - 3737.84] and focus again in work that's
[3734.80 - 3739.84] priceless it's precious yeah
[3737.84 - 3741.44] lori says absolutely not kidding celery
[3739.84 - 3744.16] force is the bomb is it not
[3741.44 - 3746.88] it's it's it's unbelievable what it does
[3744.16 - 3748.96] amy tang says i have felt that celery
[3746.88 - 3750.48] i sorry i have felt that clarity with
[3748.96 - 3751.76] celery force also isn't that
[3750.48 - 3753.28] unbelievable
[3751.76 - 3754.88] sometimes it hits me in 12 minutes
[3753.28 - 3755.84] sometimes it's 15 minutes but sometimes
[3754.88 - 3757.20] it's eight minutes
[3755.84 - 3758.88] he showed us the celery forest has
[3757.20 - 3761.60] helped me so much with my brain
[3758.88 - 3762.40] fog i love it for brain fog for people i
[3761.60 - 3765.52] love that
[3762.40 - 3766.00] i know it's it's just it's crazy so
[3765.52 - 3768.64] anyway
[3766.00 - 3769.36] um quick run down in spirulina why is it
[3768.64 - 3773.60] in the top eight
[3769.36 - 3773.60] let's hit that right now you guys okay
[3774.32 - 3777.36] because getting out of toxic heavy
[3775.76 - 3779.12] metals getting the toxic heavy metals
[3777.36 - 3781.12] out of her body is critical
[3779.12 - 3782.40] critical get the mercury out critical to
[3781.12 - 3783.92] get the aluminum out
[3782.40 - 3785.92] critical to get all those poisons and
[3783.92 - 3789.12] toxins out i don't
[3785.92 - 3792.32] like the pacific spirulinas anymore
[3789.12 - 3793.04] the ocean got too dirty okay karen says
[3792.32 - 3795.36] how much
[3793.04 - 3796.32] curcumin to take daily have lots of
[3795.36 - 3798.16] inflammation
[3796.32 - 3799.44] you should read the book and take a look
[3798.16 - 3801.04] at the supplement section and the
[3799.44 - 3801.76] illnesses and conditions look for your
[3801.04 - 3803.28] condition
[3801.76 - 3806.80] bring it to your doctor ask your doctor
[3803.28 - 3806.80] what he thinks she thinks
[3807.44 - 3811.52] so this is the purest form of spirulina
[3809.84 - 3813.04] out there breaks my heart when i see all
[3811.52 - 3814.16] the other bad spirulinas out there
[3813.04 - 3814.96] because i know people aren't getting
[3814.16 - 3816.80] what they need
[3814.96 - 3818.08] not to mention they're not independently
[3816.80 - 3821.76] bacterial
[3818.08 - 3825.84] tested independent bacteria
[3821.76 - 3828.32] tested from bemidji that difference
[3825.84 - 3829.12] changes everything it breaks all the
[3828.32 - 3831.76] rules
[3829.12 - 3833.60] and it changes everything people think
[3831.76 - 3835.20] this stuff's a joke like you know like
[3833.60 - 3837.28] the supplement quality difference are
[3835.20 - 3839.44] you kidding there's a huge
[3837.28 - 3841.04] difference huge difference you guys
[3839.44 - 3842.00] we're live on tick tock live on youtube
[3841.04 - 3846.08] live on facebook
[3842.00 - 3847.60] live on clubhouse and so anyway
[3846.08 - 3849.52] we're on that right there let's let's
[3847.60 - 3850.80] crack open a melon so here's something i
[3849.52 - 3852.56] do and i just want to give you guys a
[3850.80 - 3856.24] quick rundown on this
[3852.56 - 3858.00] is so i love these honeydew melons
[3856.24 - 3859.12] when i can get them a lot of times you
[3858.00 - 3860.80] can't get them a lot of times you have
[3859.12 - 3861.84] to wait until they ripen that's another
[3860.80 - 3864.48] thing too
[3861.84 - 3866.80] so you got to learn how to ripen them
[3864.48 - 3868.64] robinson says don't they test for heavy
[3866.80 - 3869.60] metals too though yes of course they do
[3868.64 - 3871.84] i'm saying of course they do
[3869.60 - 3873.52] independently they independently test
[3871.84 - 3874.56] for toxic heavy metals
[3873.52 - 3876.40] there's a difference when you
[3874.56 - 3877.92] independently test the test for toxic
[3876.40 - 3879.84] heavy metals huge difference
[3877.92 - 3882.00] it's everything it means everything and
[3879.84 - 3884.08] that and that's what's incredible
[3882.00 - 3885.84] absolutely all right let me get a spoon

[3915.92 - 3919.92] my desk
[3917.44 - 3921.52] and this is a canary i think oh this is
[3919.92 - 3924.32] like a crenshaw
[3921.52 - 3925.60] uh and then there's different kind this
[3924.32 - 3929.04] is a cantaloupe right here i got a
[3925.60 - 3931.60] couple different melons right here right

[3934.00 - 3938.40] it really makes a difference and and all
[3936.64 - 3938.88] these things make a difference about it
[3938.40 - 3941.20] let me
[3938.88 - 3943.52] let me get this guy over here for a
[3941.20 - 3943.52] second
[3946.32 - 3948.64] all right
[3949.36 - 3955.60] so i like to do with my spirulina
[3952.80 - 3956.24] is i like to put it on my honeydew melon
[3955.60 - 3958.08] so
[3956.24 - 3960.56] this is a favorite thing of mine for a
[3958.08 - 3964.24] long long time so i take
[3960.56 - 3968.80] some spirulina and i sprinkle it on
[3964.24 - 3970.96] i sprinkle it in the hole right
[3968.80 - 3972.40] right in there sprinkle it in there is
[3970.96 - 3976.72] what i do
[3972.40 - 3978.32] okay so i got my spirulina in the melon
[3976.72 - 3980.08] and then i take barley grass juice
[3978.32 - 3982.16] powder
[3980.08 - 3985.36] i'm gonna grab some of that i'll
[3982.16 - 3985.36] sprinkle that in there too
[3990.84 - 3997.52] so
[3993.52 - 3999.76] that's how that's how i consume it a lot
[3997.52 - 4001.92] it's not barley grass this is barley
[3999.76 - 4002.56] grass juice powder that detail matters
[4001.92 - 4005.04] right there
[4002.56 - 4006.00] people that know that for so long they
[4005.04 - 4009.04] just saw i'll go get
[4006.00 - 4011.68] barley grass well then that did nothing
[4009.04 - 4013.52] barley grass doesn't do anything it has
[4011.68 - 4016.64] speaker barley grass juice powder
[4013.52 - 4018.40] okay and there's no gluten in it very
[4016.64 - 4020.32] important to know
[4018.40 - 4022.24] and if you get a crappy barley grass
[4020.32 - 4024.96] cheese powder it's so sad because
[4022.24 - 4026.96] you know you try to you try to make sure
[4024.96 - 4028.40] in any way in your capacity people have
[4026.96 - 4029.20] information so they can heal and then
[4028.40 - 4031.04] someone will be like
[4029.20 - 4032.56] i use this barley grass juice powder i'm
[4031.04 - 4034.80] like okay good luck
[4032.56 - 4036.08] because under 10 of that is going to be
[4034.80 - 4036.88] products people don't even know that's
[4036.08 - 4038.24] in there it could be
[4036.88 - 4040.48] msg it could be anything in there and
[4038.24 - 4042.40] they don't have to put it on the label
[4040.48 - 4044.96] and you know why is it that good because
[4042.40 - 4047.04] a company said so or is there actual
[4044.96 - 4050.00] data and facts of why they actually you
[4047.04 - 4051.92] know have it that good
[4050.00 - 4053.28] it's just it's actually crazy really so
[4051.92 - 4055.12] this is what i do and what i do is i
[4053.28 - 4056.40] scoop out the melon like that so that's
[4055.12 - 4058.72] one way i have it
[4056.40 - 4059.76] you can cube up the melon you can put it
[4058.72 - 4061.76] in a bowl
[4059.76 - 4063.52] and i'll take this to my desk and i'll
[4061.76 - 4064.80] just eat it like that while you know a
[4063.52 - 4066.08] ripe melon and i'll actually put the
[4064.80 - 4068.00] spoon in and i'll have a little bit of
[4066.08 - 4070.32] that like that i've done that so many
[4068.00 - 4070.32] times
[4070.72 - 4074.32] elizabeth edwards i saw barley grass
[4072.72 - 4075.84] juice powder on amazon

[4075.84 - 4080.00] detox that they
[4077.36 - 4082.56] clearly say they grow with aluminum in
[4080.00 - 4082.56] the soil
