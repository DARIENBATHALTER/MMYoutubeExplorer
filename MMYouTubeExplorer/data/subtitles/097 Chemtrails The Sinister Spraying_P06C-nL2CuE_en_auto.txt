[1.28 - 7.76] How many people do you know who struggle
[4.32 - 10.24] with their health? Chances are, whether
[7.76 - 14.56] they show it or not, most of the people
[10.24 - 17.64] in your life do. And chances are, you're
[14.56 - 20.80] one of them. Whether you're dealing with
[17.64 - 25.04] anxiety, depression, endometriosis,
[20.80 - 28.00] acne, eczema, autoimmune, thyroid, lime,
[25.04 - 31.32] brain fog, fatigue, or any other symptom
[28.00 - 34.48] or condition, you're far from
[31.32 - 37.76] alone. Living with symptoms has become
[34.48 - 41.44] the new normal. So, no more guessing
[37.76 - 43.84] games. It's time to get answers. Welcome
[41.44 - 45.84] to the Medical Medium Podcast. I'm
[43.84 - 47.72] Anthony Williams.
[45.84 - 50.92] We're talking about poisoning the
[47.72 - 54.24] people. That's right. Poisoning the
[50.92 - 57.68] people. Toxic air pockets floating in
[54.24 - 60.84] the sky. Poisons coming out of planes.
[57.68 - 63.12] We're talking about chemtrails and
[60.84 - 65.76] geoengineering. This is episode three
[63.12 - 69.04] about geoengineering and chemtrails.
[65.76 - 74.32] Poor air quality from factories, from
[69.04 - 76.24] smog is one thing. Then add thousands
[74.32 - 79.12] and even hundreds of thousands and
[76.24 - 81.64] millions of planes up in the sky all
[79.12 - 84.64] around the globe releasing toxic
[81.64 - 87.84] chemicals. How this combined with the
[84.64 - 90.72] pollution on the planet takes things to
[87.84 - 94.00] an unnecessary level. There's a strategy
[90.72 - 95.36] to when the planes dump the toxins.
[94.00 - 97.44] There's a strategy to when the
[95.36 - 99.28] chemtrails happen. They're always
[97.44 - 101.48] happening. They're always up there in
[99.28 - 103.96] the sky and they're always dumping
[101.48 - 107.76] chemtrails. They're always dumping toxic
[103.96 - 109.56] chemicals. But when holidays happen or
[107.76 - 113.32] the weather shifts and people are
[109.56 - 116.84] outside, Fourth of July, Easter,
[113.32 - 120.08] springtime, Sundays, weekends,
[116.84 - 123.12] Thanksgiving, they pour it on. They pour
[120.08 - 125.60] it right on. More planes in the sky.
[123.12 - 128.72] More white streaks everywhere. The
[125.60 - 130.88] strategy is to poison the people. Hang
[128.72 - 133.60] on with this episode. Strap yourself in.
[130.88 - 137.96] Fasten your seat belts because we're
[133.60 - 137.96] taking another plane flight.
[138.82 - 155.27] [Music]
[157.84 - 162.84] So, what is coming out of these jet
[159.44 - 166.16] planes up there in the sky? Vitamins,
[162.84 - 169.60] nutrients, mineral water, sparkling
[166.16 - 172.32] water, fruit juice, essential oils. Are
[169.60 - 174.08] they dumping nice things on everyone?
[172.32 - 176.08] Are they dumping wonderful things on
[174.08 - 178.12] everyone? Are all these planes that are
[176.08 - 181.36] leaving these streaks all across the
[178.12 - 182.88] planet, is there friendly ingredients in
[181.36 - 185.52] those streaks that are leaving the
[182.88 - 188.32] planes, are they dumping nice things on
[185.52 - 189.84] us, on our families, on our children, on
[188.32 - 192.16] our friends, on the people we care
[189.84 - 193.68] about? When we look up in the sky and we
[192.16 - 196.40] see all those white streaks coming out
[193.68 - 198.72] of all those jet planes, should we say
[196.40 - 201.84] it's organic, right? What they're
[198.72 - 205.20] dumping on us must be organic because
[201.84 - 208.28] why on God's earth would there be evil
[205.20 - 212.24] people controlling an entire network of
[208.28 - 215.68] planes? A system built to release all of
[212.24 - 219.12] this stuff, all of these chemicals, all
[215.68 - 220.96] of those agents on top of everyone while
[219.12 - 223.20] kids are in the schoolyards, while
[220.96 - 224.80] people are in a picnic in a park. Why
[223.20 - 227.44] people are living their lives out every
[224.80 - 229.04] day, jogging, running in it. Why
[227.44 - 232.72] everybody's looking up at the sky,
[229.04 - 235.36] watching a sunset. Why on God's green
[232.72 - 237.04] earth would they ever do this? So the
[235.36 - 240.52] powers that run this planet must be
[237.04 - 243.92] looking out for us. Surely they must
[240.52 - 246.72] care. Whoever's behind all this must be
[243.92 - 249.12] doing it just to help us. It must be to
[246.72 - 251.44] protect our planet, of course. But
[249.12 - 253.52] that's not the truth. And wouldn't it be
[251.44 - 255.92] wonderful if that was the truth? The
[253.52 - 258.84] geoengineering operation and the
[255.92 - 262.00] chemtrail operation are secret
[258.84 - 264.96] operations no one has their fingers on.
[262.00 - 267.52] Nobody in the public arena understands
[264.96 - 270.56] it. Nobody in the public arena really
[267.52 - 273.60] knows what's going on. It's all a
[270.56 - 276.88] classified mystery. Geoengineering is a
[273.60 - 280.88] secretive endeavor that encompasses a
[276.88 - 283.44] large umbrella and doesn't even admit to
[280.88 - 285.52] the releasing of agents out of planes up
[283.44 - 288.36] in the sky because there's nobody
[285.52 - 291.04] accountable. There's nobody to admit
[288.36 - 294.32] anything. There's no service. There's no
[291.04 - 297.84] phone number. There's no agency that's
[294.32 - 299.92] known. It's a complete mystery. A total
[297.84 - 301.92] complete mystery. Sure, you might be
[299.92 - 303.52] able to dig, dig, dig and find
[301.92 - 305.52] something, but in the end, after you
[303.52 - 306.96] scratch the surface, you're nowhere.
[305.52 - 309.04] You're not going to find information on
[306.96 - 311.36] the scheduling, what they're dumping,
[309.04 - 313.60] are they dumping, are they spraying,
[311.36 - 316.32] what's coming out of the planes, is it
[313.60 - 317.92] for weather modification, or is it not?
[316.32 - 320.24] Are they really trying to shield the
[317.92 - 322.32] sun? Are they doing it for climate
[320.24 - 324.20] change? Are they doing it for climate
[322.32 - 326.40] engineering? What is climate
[324.20 - 328.32] engineering? Who are they? What
[326.40 - 330.52] scientists are they? Where are the
[328.32 - 334.00] scientists meeting? Is there a public
[330.52 - 336.44] forum? It's all a secret. And right now,
[334.00 - 338.88] states that are interested in stopping
[336.44 - 340.88] geoengineering or any kind of aerosol
[338.88 - 343.44] being sprayed out of a plane over the
[340.88 - 345.84] state or any other chemical agents
[343.44 - 348.24] sprayed out of planes over a state.
[345.84 - 350.40] Right now, it's still a mystery. A
[348.24 - 352.72] public authority can't just call a
[350.40 - 355.04] hotline and then somebody answer on the
[352.72 - 357.68] other end. No one's allowed to talk to a
[355.04 - 359.88] scientist working for geoengineering. A
[357.68 - 363.04] scientist that's formulating the
[359.88 - 365.68] chemicals, the toxic metals, all the
[363.04 - 367.20] different toxic agents, the scientists
[365.68 - 369.68] that are actually saying, "Well, this
[367.20 - 372.56] will help shield the sun. This will help
[369.68 - 374.56] stop climate change." No one's allowed
[372.56 - 377.36] to talk to those people. No one's
[374.56 - 380.80] allowed to talk to anyone. It is just a
[377.36 - 384.64] campaign that's completely off limits to
[380.80 - 387.40] anyone and everybody. A state can ban
[384.64 - 390.80] any kind of geoengineering, spraying of
[387.40 - 392.72] chemtrails. They could ban them, but who
[390.80 - 395.36] are they banning? Who are they
[392.72 - 398.56] punishing? Who are they finding? No one
[395.36 - 401.76] even knows where the planes land.
[398.56 - 404.72] Commercial airports aren't governing any
[401.76 - 406.16] of these planes. Air traffic control has
[404.72 - 409.52] nothing to do with any of the
[406.16 - 412.48] geoengineering or chemtrail campaigns.
[409.52 - 414.08] At least not our air traffic control.
[412.48 - 417.04] What does that mean? The air traffic
[414.08 - 420.16] control that handles commercial flights,
[417.04 - 424.40] those air traffic controllers all around
[420.16 - 427.36] the globe at commercial airports do not
[424.40 - 430.16] have any affiliation to the
[427.36 - 432.72] geoengineering and chemtrail programs.
[430.16 - 435.28] There are hundreds of airports around
[432.72 - 438.60] the world that work with geoengineering
[435.28 - 441.68] and the chemtrail programs. privately
[438.60 - 444.00] classified secretive airports and air
[441.68 - 446.00] traffic controllers. So if you're a
[444.00 - 449.60] public authority, who do you ban? Who do
[446.00 - 452.72] you find? What judges reside over this?
[449.60 - 454.72] The districts, who's in charge? All we
[452.72 - 456.72] could really do is look up in the sky
[454.72 - 459.52] and if you see a white streak, we can't
[456.72 - 462.32] prove it. We can't prove that white
[459.52 - 464.96] streak is still a geoengineering trail
[462.32 - 468.08] or a chemtrail. We can't prove it's an
[464.96 - 470.96] aerosol coming out of a jet because that
[468.08 - 473.52] jet can't land in an airport we can
[470.96 - 475.92] find. It doesn't land in a commercial
[473.52 - 478.04] airport or commercial airport in that
[475.92 - 481.12] state that bans geoengineering or
[478.04 - 484.32] chemtrails. So if a law is passed, which
[481.12 - 487.76] is amazing because it's helpful, it does
[484.32 - 490.00] get the word out. It does open it up.
[487.76 - 492.88] But if a law has passed where
[490.00 - 495.92] geoengineering can't occur in the skies
[492.88 - 499.92] above a state, how do you get that jet
[495.92 - 502.16] plane finded? How do you actually find
[499.92 - 504.64] that jet plane? How do you know who it
[502.16 - 507.84] is? You can't just call an air traffic
[504.64 - 510.16] control. You can't call the FAA and say,
[507.84 - 513.00] "Uh, excuse me. There was a plane at
[510.16 - 516.32] this certain time flying above our great
[513.00 - 518.64] state and um we saw a white streak
[516.32 - 521.28] coming from that plane. Do you happen to
[518.64 - 523.88] know what plane that is or who that is?
[521.28 - 527.36] It is very hard to find out almost
[523.88 - 529.20] impossible and clearly may be impossible
[527.36 - 531.44] because there's chemtrails being dropped
[529.20 - 533.44] out of planes. People are being poisoned
[531.44 - 534.84] every day. It could be under the guise
[533.44 - 537.36] of the campaign of
[534.84 - 539.68] geoengineering, weather modification,
[537.36 - 542.16] and it can also be chemol programs in
[539.68 - 544.40] general. And there's not just one
[542.16 - 547.20] program up there in the sky. And there's
[544.40 - 549.52] not just one organization in the sky.
[547.20 - 552.24] And the organizations communicate with
[549.52 - 554.64] each other. This is far different than a
[552.24 - 556.72] small plane releasing something out of
[554.64 - 559.28] it or dumping something out of it and
[556.72 - 560.72] then landing in a local airport where
[559.28 - 563.48] the authorities could be sitting there
[560.72 - 566.64] waiting for them. There are secret
[563.48 - 569.28] bases, secret airports all around the
[566.64 - 572.08] country and all around every country and
[569.28 - 574.88] the globe. These secret airports have
[572.08 - 577.60] the chemtrail planes landing in them and
[574.88 - 580.48] the geoengineering planes landing in
[577.60 - 583.92] them. And if you don't know where one
[580.48 - 585.92] secret airport is, one out of hundreds
[583.92 - 588.56] and hundreds, if you don't know where
[585.92 - 591.36] these airports are, and you don't know
[588.56 - 594.16] who the air traffic controllers are, and
[591.36 - 597.32] you have no way of getting the FAA to
[594.16 - 600.56] help you and find them, then who do you
[597.32 - 602.96] punish? Who do you ban? It's that
[600.56 - 605.20] difficult. But yet, it's good that
[602.96 - 606.88] states are aware of this. It's good that
[605.20 - 608.76] states are aware of geoengineering,
[606.88 - 610.84] weather modification, weather
[608.76 - 614.08] manipulation, trails coming out of
[610.84 - 616.72] planes, agents being dropped on people.
[614.08 - 619.12] That's very important and critical. And
[616.72 - 621.60] we need states to actually see that. And
[619.12 - 624.24] we need laws to be passed. But it's the
[621.60 - 626.40] beginning, the very beginning. And
[624.24 - 629.56] that's a great place to start. The only
[626.40 - 632.24] time a chemtrail plane or a
[629.56 - 634.96] geoengineering chemtrail plane, weather
[632.24 - 637.28] modification plane will ever land in a
[634.96 - 639.60] commercial airport, is if there's a
[637.28 - 642.00] malfunction with that plane and the
[639.60 - 644.56] pilot has no choice but to land that
[642.00 - 646.88] plane in a commercial airport, to land
[644.56 - 649.84] that chemtrail plane, which never lands
[646.88 - 651.92] in a commercial airport ever. The only
[649.84 - 654.96] way it's going to happen is if there's
[651.92 - 657.28] an emergency, a malfunction, a problem
[654.96 - 659.76] with the plane, or the plane happens to
[657.28 - 662.24] be out of fuel for some reason. Then
[659.76 - 664.48] they can land in a commercial airport.
[662.24 - 667.12] They can switch the radio and
[664.48 - 669.20] communicate to an air traffic controller
[667.12 - 672.08] at a commercial airport and do an
[669.20 - 673.92] emergency landing and be protected too
[672.08 - 676.56] while they do it. Where an air traffic
[673.92 - 679.04] controller can't question them, can't
[676.56 - 681.20] question their airplane. Does it have
[679.04 - 683.52] passengers or not? What is it? What is
[681.20 - 685.36] it doing? What secret mission is it on?
[683.52 - 687.60] They won't even question it. They're
[685.36 - 689.36] protected. There's a reason for this.
[687.60 - 692.32] Air traffic controllers in commercial
[689.36 - 695.52] airports know of such planes. They're
[692.32 - 698.16] not blind to it. They're aware of secret
[695.52 - 700.96] missions, classified planes in the
[698.16 - 703.52] skies. They see it all the time. They're
[700.96 - 704.88] everywhere. So much so, more so than
[703.52 - 707.52] commercial flights and commercial
[704.88 - 709.60] airliners. So when a chemtrail
[707.52 - 712.40] classified chemtrail plane or
[709.60 - 714.32] geoengineering plane is in trouble,
[712.40 - 716.80] they're allowed to land in a commercial
[714.32 - 719.52] airport. It's rare, only if there's an
[716.80 - 721.84] emergency, but it happens. An air
[719.52 - 724.32] traffic control at a commercial airliner
[721.84 - 727.36] at a commercial airport will actually
[724.32 - 729.84] let them land and not question them. And
[727.36 - 732.24] their plane won't even be inspected.
[729.84 - 735.12] Because if they did an inspection, they
[732.24 - 738.40] would see a hollowedout plane filled
[735.12 - 741.68] with tanks, plastic tanks. Those plastic
[738.40 - 744.64] tanks filled with chemicals. Chemicals
[741.68 - 747.28] that get admitted or sprayed or released
[744.64 - 749.84] out of little pipes, little tubes that
[747.28 - 752.24] are attached to the plane with a motor
[749.84 - 754.56] pulling the chemical out of the tanks
[752.24 - 756.56] and into the pipes and out of the plane,
[754.56 - 759.04] all through a switch that's in the
[756.56 - 761.40] cockpit. And these planes aren't allowed
[759.04 - 764.40] to be inspected. Instead, they're
[761.40 - 767.00] protected, secretly protected, and they
[764.40 - 770.08] are above the law. All laws on this
[767.00 - 772.16] planet. Geoengineering planes, chemtrail
[770.08 - 774.56] planes, any kind of planes that are up
[772.16 - 778.00] there in the sky, up there flying around
[774.56 - 780.32] releasing toxins, chemicals, streaming
[778.00 - 783.12] out all kinds of white streaks, are
[780.32 - 784.96] above the law. And the truth is, the
[783.12 - 787.52] people that run all of that, that run
[784.96 - 790.60] the campaigns, that are in charge of the
[787.52 - 794.32] chemtrail programs, that are responsible
[790.60 - 796.88] for 60, 70 years of contamination being
[794.32 - 799.88] dropped on everyone, are the hidden
[796.88 - 803.20] powers behind the scenes. These are the
[799.88 - 805.64] evildoers, the people that pull strings,
[803.20 - 808.08] that make things happen, that are
[805.64 - 810.24] unbelievable as far as the drive they
[808.08 - 812.24] have to wreak havoc and cause problems
[810.24 - 815.40] and contaminate the earth and hurt
[812.24 - 818.08] people, poisoning the people, poisoning
[815.40 - 820.96] nature. Think about it. Classified
[818.08 - 824.16] airports all around the globe, hidden
[820.96 - 828.00] away and tucked away, many in the woods.
[824.16 - 829.92] Planes coming and going. Planes landing,
[828.00 - 832.96] filling the tanks back up with toxic
[829.92 - 835.12] chemicals and toxic metals. A new pilot
[832.96 - 837.52] going into the plane. And then the plane
[835.12 - 839.68] goes back up. And then the pilots are
[837.52 - 842.04] given direction coordinates to where
[839.68 - 844.24] they're going to be releasing the toxic
[842.04 - 846.80] chemicals. And that's the white streaks
[844.24 - 849.36] you see in the sky. If you listen to the
[846.80 - 853.32] last episode about contrails, they are
[849.36 - 857.92] not contrails. They are chemicals,
[853.32 - 861.12] solvents, metals, agents, toxic waste,
[857.92 - 863.20] fungus, pathogens, petrochemicals, and a
[861.12 - 865.68] lot more. And remember, there's more
[863.20 - 867.40] than one campaign going on up there.
[865.68 - 869.84] There's geoengineering for weather
[867.40 - 872.16] modification, which could easily be just
[869.84 - 874.48] barerium or a mix of two or three
[872.16 - 877.20] different metals in high concentrations.
[874.48 - 880.00] And then there's the chemtrail campaign,
[877.20 - 882.00] which is anything goes. Anything toxic
[880.00 - 884.96] comes out of those planes. Any kind of
[882.00 - 888.00] mix, any kind of brew. Some of the brews
[884.96 - 890.88] are old. Back to World War I, World War
[888.00 - 893.68] II. Back stoages of lots of toxic
[890.88 - 895.88] chemicals produced in the industries.
[893.68 - 898.48] Now, keep in mind, before the
[895.88 - 900.00] 1960s, all the chemical factories and
[898.48 - 902.24] chemical industries all around the
[900.00 - 905.60] planet were dumping all of the runoff,
[902.24 - 909.04] all the byproduct into rivers, lakes,
[905.60 - 914.64] and the ocean and into landfills. By the
[909.04 - 917.92] 1960s, late 1960s, early 1970s, and 80s,
[914.64 - 920.32] it started changing. Chemical factories,
[917.92 - 922.64] chemical industries weren't dumping as
[920.32 - 925.28] much toxic chemical into the rivers,
[922.64 - 928.00] lakes, landfills, and ocean because it
[925.28 - 930.48] was polluting them too severely. Rivers
[928.00 - 932.52] were dying, lakes were dying, landfills
[930.48 - 934.96] were getting worse and overfilled,
[932.52 - 937.60] oversaturated, and the chemicals had no
[934.96 - 939.76] place to go because of this. And by the
[937.60 - 941.60] 1980s, more chemicals were being
[939.76 - 944.00] produced than ever before because of the
[941.60 - 945.44] industries and for the need of a lot of
[944.00 - 947.84] different products because the
[945.44 - 950.00] population was growing. But yet, even
[947.84 - 952.16] though there was all this backup storage
[950.00 - 954.40] of byproduct from all these different
[952.16 - 956.20] chemical industries, it wasn't being put
[954.40 - 959.72] in the oceans, the rivers, and the lakes
[956.20 - 963.84] anymore. just to actively produce one
[959.72 - 967.60] chemical, one foundational chemical for
[963.84 - 969.92] products in the industry, it can produce
[967.60 - 972.80] millions of gallons of runoff and
[969.92 - 975.60] byproduct. So, think about all of the
[972.80 - 978.64] hundreds and thousands of chemicals that
[975.60 - 981.84] are produced in the chemical industries
[978.64 - 983.84] and the byproduct produced, the billions
[981.84 - 985.92] and even trillions of gallons of
[983.84 - 988.08] byproduct that aren't being stored
[985.92 - 990.56] somewhere in a tank at the chemical
[988.08 - 993.20] industry facility or anywhere that
[990.56 - 996.56] anyone can inspect it. There isn't room
[993.20 - 999.04] to house that many gallons, billions and
[996.56 - 1000.80] even trillions of gallons of byproduct.
[999.04 - 1002.88] There's no land that can house it.
[1000.80 - 1005.56] There's no room that can house it. It
[1002.88 - 1008.40] has to go somewhere. And so since the
[1005.56 - 1011.68] 1960s, private deals, classified deals
[1008.40 - 1014.64] are brokered. And the industries found a
[1011.68 - 1017.92] way to get the chemicals out the door
[1014.64 - 1021.28] and in the skies. Backlogs of old DDT,
[1017.92 - 1024.08] backlogs of old agent orange, backlogs
[1021.28 - 1026.80] of experimental chemicals gone wrong
[1024.08 - 1030.00] because of the experimental process of
[1026.80 - 1032.72] creating them. Someone figured out that
[1030.00 - 1035.36] if they got it in the sky and thinned it
[1032.72 - 1039.04] out enough and dropped it on everybody
[1035.36 - 1041.92] that it wouldn't create a direct effect.
[1039.04 - 1045.60] It wouldn't be like a direct runoff into
[1041.92 - 1048.16] a stream or a direct runoff into a lake
[1045.60 - 1050.64] where just in 10 years time, 15 years
[1048.16 - 1054.00] time, the whole lake dies. The direct
[1050.64 - 1056.56] effect is unseen, but yet seen every
[1054.00 - 1058.88] single day by everybody's eyes as we
[1056.56 - 1061.68] look into the sky. It's the ultimate
[1058.88 - 1063.52] evildoing done in front of everyone, but
[1061.68 - 1066.00] yet the destruction and the evil
[1063.52 - 1068.80] despicable nature of it is underneath
[1066.00 - 1071.44] everyone's noses. But yet, fakeipedia,
[1068.80 - 1073.68] Wikipedia would say it's not true and
[1071.44 - 1076.40] it's a conspiracy theory. And what
[1073.68 - 1077.76] everybody's looking at are contrails,
[1076.40 - 1079.04] which couldn't be further from the
[1077.76 - 1081.28] truth. Now, let's talk about
[1079.04 - 1084.24] geoengineering for a little bit. The
[1081.28 - 1086.76] history of geoengineering is vague. And
[1084.24 - 1089.44] if there is a plane involved in
[1086.76 - 1092.08] geoengineering flying above you and it's
[1089.44 - 1094.76] releasing a white trail and that white
[1092.08 - 1097.28] trail is cadmium, that white trail is
[1094.76 - 1100.56] barerium or that white trail is some
[1097.28 - 1103.28] other toxin or metal, you're not going
[1100.56 - 1106.16] to know if that's geoengineering. You're
[1103.28 - 1108.40] not allowed to know. It's not like it's
[1106.16 - 1111.88] out there where you know the plane above
[1108.40 - 1115.84] you is just involved in a geoengineering
[1111.88 - 1117.84] campaign, an experiment or science and
[1115.84 - 1120.32] they're helping us out. No one would
[1117.84 - 1121.92] ever know. No one's allowed to test it.
[1120.32 - 1124.08] No one's allowed to feel it in their
[1121.92 - 1126.80] fingers. No one's allowed to knock on
[1124.08 - 1128.32] somebody's door, some bureaucrat, and be
[1126.80 - 1130.00] like, "Hey, I would love to talk to the
[1128.32 - 1132.00] geoengineering people, the people
[1130.00 - 1133.48] responsible for the planes in the sky,
[1132.00 - 1135.12] and is that plane above me
[1133.48 - 1136.72] geoengineering? And what are they
[1135.12 - 1138.80] dropping out of that plane? Can you give
[1136.72 - 1140.96] me a container of it?" It's never going
[1138.80 - 1143.20] to happen. It's impossible. Doesn't work
[1140.96 - 1144.32] that way because in the end, they would
[1143.20 - 1146.48] just say, "What you're seeing is a
[1144.32 - 1148.96] contrail anyway." There are two kinds of
[1146.48 - 1151.60] planes up in the sky that are dropping
[1148.96 - 1154.56] all of the chemicals on us. If it's a
[1151.60 - 1157.20] geoengineering plane, it's most likely a
[1154.56 - 1159.36] military cargo plane, but yet it still
[1157.20 - 1161.36] can be an old commercial airliner that's
[1159.36 - 1164.16] hollowed out and not in use anymore for
[1161.36 - 1166.40] commercial flights. But there's another
[1164.16 - 1168.76] type of plane up in the sky, which
[1166.40 - 1171.36] really is no matter what, a commercial
[1168.76 - 1173.36] airliner, but an old commercial
[1171.36 - 1177.52] airliner, one that's not in business
[1173.36 - 1179.84] anymore, or leftover, beat up, worn out
[1177.52 - 1182.64] planes that are not in use. But yet the
[1179.84 - 1184.96] airliner company, the airplane company
[1182.64 - 1187.16] is still putting out planes, still
[1184.96 - 1189.52] flying people commercially, still in
[1187.16 - 1192.24] service, but they're old planes. They
[1189.52 - 1195.92] don't use anymore from the 80s in the
[1192.24 - 1198.24] 70s and the '9s, the early 2000s.
[1195.92 - 1201.12] They're retired planes, and they're not
[1198.24 - 1204.16] just sitting somewhere in a parking lot
[1201.12 - 1206.40] or on some air strip getting dust and
[1204.16 - 1209.60] dirt all over them. They're given or
[1206.40 - 1212.24] sold to the chemtrail campaigns, the
[1209.60 - 1214.72] chemtrail people. And then there's still
[1212.24 - 1217.12] manufacturing of planes. There's still
[1214.72 - 1219.08] the buying of planes for the purposes.
[1217.12 - 1222.64] There's still military planes, cargo
[1219.08 - 1225.12] planes being bought and sold and created
[1222.64 - 1226.96] for the purpose of geoengineering, for
[1225.12 - 1229.44] the purpose of dropping out all of those
[1226.96 - 1231.84] chemicals, all those metals out in the
[1229.44 - 1234.88] sky and all over us. And if you really
[1231.84 - 1237.28] think about it, what is it really for?
[1234.88 - 1240.48] Well, it's twofold. You get rid of a lot
[1237.28 - 1242.88] of toxic waste that needs a place to go
[1240.48 - 1246.08] because it has no more places to go. And
[1242.88 - 1248.72] at the same time, you can hurt people.
[1246.08 - 1251.36] You can make people sicker. You can make
[1248.72 - 1253.68] people get cancer faster. You can make
[1251.36 - 1255.84] people get ill quicker. You can make
[1253.68 - 1258.60] people lose the quality of their lives.
[1255.84 - 1261.24] And you can slowly alter life
[1258.60 - 1264.08] expectancy. It's ingenious. The
[1261.24 - 1266.64] evildoers got a great plan. They got a
[1264.08 - 1270.00] great scam going for a very long time
[1266.64 - 1272.64] since the 1960s. It hasn't stopped. It's
[1270.00 - 1276.16] only gotten stronger. There are days out
[1272.64 - 1279.44] there people report seeing people claim
[1276.16 - 1283.52] to see hundreds of strips and streaks in
[1279.44 - 1287.28] the sky. 10, 20, 30 planes flying by
[1283.52 - 1289.04] within a half an hour and white streaks
[1287.28 - 1291.28] coming from the back of the planes and
[1289.04 - 1292.96] the sides of the planes. And let's be
[1291.28 - 1296.72] clear about something. something that's
[1292.96 - 1299.20] really important. It's not the jet fuel
[1296.72 - 1301.76] that has all of this toxic waste, all
[1299.20 - 1304.04] these toxic chemicals, all of the
[1301.76 - 1305.80] different metals like in
[1304.04 - 1307.80] geoengineering, all the different
[1305.80 - 1310.80] poisons like in
[1307.80 - 1313.76] chemtrailing. It's not in the fuel
[1310.80 - 1316.24] that's being filled up into the plane so
[1313.76 - 1319.36] the plane can fly, so the jet engines
[1316.24 - 1321.76] can run. It's not to say that the fuel
[1319.36 - 1324.32] isn't toxic and there aren't dangerous
[1321.76 - 1327.44] chemicals being put into the fuel, the
[1324.32 - 1329.84] jet fuel, the plane fuel. It's not that.
[1327.44 - 1332.48] There always can be that. There's always
[1329.84 - 1335.40] chemicals in fuels and it could even be
[1332.48 - 1337.12] some additional ones. But that's not
[1335.40 - 1340.04] chemtrailing. That's not what's
[1337.12 - 1342.96] happening. These are planes hollowed
[1340.04 - 1345.60] out. Plastic tanks are placed into these
[1342.96 - 1348.08] planes, large tanks. They're being
[1345.60 - 1352.00] filled with toxic chemicals. There are
[1348.08 - 1355.92] small motors that pull the contents out
[1352.00 - 1358.92] of the plastic tank, out a pipe, and out
[1355.92 - 1362.48] the sides of the plane. The pilot has a
[1358.92 - 1365.04] switch and the pilot clicks that switch
[1362.48 - 1367.64] or flicks that switch or presses that
[1365.04 - 1371.12] button and then the contents are
[1367.64 - 1374.48] released. And this is the poisoning of
[1371.12 - 1375.84] the people. people being poisoned. And
[1374.48 - 1378.12] even though there's a lot of new
[1375.84 - 1380.08] awareness when it comes down to
[1378.12 - 1382.04] chemtrails, even though there's a lot of
[1380.08 - 1384.08] new awareness when it comes down to
[1382.04 - 1386.80] geoengineering, it's still going to be a
[1384.08 - 1388.56] process. It's still going to take time
[1386.80 - 1391.44] and it's going to be a long time before
[1388.56 - 1393.84] those planes are not in the sky anymore.
[1391.44 - 1396.16] Stay tuned for other episodes in the
[1393.84 - 1398.00] geoengineering and chemtrail series.

[1402.40 - 1408.16] blessings and God bless
[1405.32 - 1410.88] you. It's unreal when you think about
[1408.16 - 1414.08] it. There's these planes filled with
[1410.88 - 1418.00] chem and they're up there in the sky day
[1414.08 - 1421.36] in day out. They spray. They do it to
[1418.00 - 1424.08] create a toxic chemical fallout. Who
[1421.36 - 1426.96] said they're allowed to do this? They
[1424.08 - 1430.24] should be called out. Someone should be
[1426.96 - 1433.28] held accountable. No doubt. This is
[1430.24 - 1436.16] flight 114 to the base. I just let out
[1433.28 - 1439.36] 20,000 gallons out the gate. Pretty sure
[1436.16 - 1442.00] I'm out. There's no more. Over. This is
[1439.36 - 1444.08] the base. Flight 114. Land out the
[1442.00 - 1446.56] Arizona air strip. Get a good night's
[1444.08 - 1450.08] sleep. Fill back up. Get back in the
[1446.56 - 1451.92] air. Roger that. This is flight 132 to
[1450.08 - 1453.92] the base. I noticed when they were
[1451.92 - 1455.92] filling my plane, it was a different
[1453.92 - 1459.12] color this time and it was reddish
[1455.92 - 1461.92] orange. Over. This is the base, flight
[1459.12 - 1463.60] 132. It's no concern to you. Your job
[1461.92 - 1466.16] isn't to understand the contents that
[1463.60 - 1468.96] you carry. Just kick back, enjoy the
[1466.16 - 1472.24] ride, and be merry. This is flight 222
[1468.96 - 1474.96] to 132. I overheard and when I filled up
[1472.24 - 1477.52] last night, the tank was green and the
[1474.96 - 1480.96] tech was wearing a hazmat suit. I asked
[1477.52 - 1484.16] him why. He just gave me a salute. Over.
[1480.96 - 1487.44] This is flight 132 to 222. My guy was
[1484.16 - 1491.36] wearing a hazmat suit, too. Over. This
[1487.44 - 1495.20] is the base. Flight 132. Flight 222.
[1491.36 - 1497.44] Having fun. Just do your job, sons. This
[1495.20 - 1500.64] is flight 666. Caught the last part of
[1497.44 - 1502.88] that. 132 and 222. Last time I had my
[1500.64 - 1505.20] tank filled. Took a whiff and it was
[1502.88 - 1506.72] bad. Got quite sick. That's why I hope
[1505.20 - 1509.04] everybody down there isn't being
[1506.72 - 1511.28] affected. Well, we're dumping on them,
[1509.04 - 1514.40] including our families. This is the base
[1511.28 - 1517.28] Flight 666. They're safe. They're fine.
[1514.40 - 1519.68] Stop with the gossip. This is flight 666
[1517.28 - 1522.08] to the base. And why is there skulling
[1519.68 - 1525.68] crossbones on the tanks? This is the
[1522.08 - 1530.08] base flight 666. Do as you're told and
[1525.68 - 1530.08] the sky is the limit. Roger
[1541.16 - 1544.16] that.

[1606.08 - 1610.88] research, lobbyists, internal kickbacks,
[1608.80 - 1612.96] persuaded belief systems, private panels
[1610.88 - 1614.64] of influencers, health field payoffs,
[1612.96 - 1616.48] trendy traps, or gathered bits and
[1614.64 - 1618.40] pieces of gimmicky confusion. Because
[1616.48 - 1620.32] chronic illness is exploding like never
[1618.40 - 1622.16] before in our modern-day history, it
[1620.32 - 1624.00] takes a greater force than us down here.
[1622.16 - 1625.76] It takes a helping hand from above.
[1624.00 - 1627.44] Medical medium information has street
[1625.76 - 1628.64] cred. It's an organic movement of
[1627.44 - 1630.40] countless people around the world
[1628.64 - 1632.24] healing more healing stories of real
[1630.40 - 1634.40] people not being paid to tell their
[1632.24 - 1636.00] life-changing experiences of rising out
[1634.40 - 1638.08] of the ashes of sickness and entering
[1636.00 - 1639.76] into the light of full recovery, getting
[1638.08 - 1641.36] their lives back and finally healing
[1639.76 - 1642.72] when nothing else in the world of health
[1641.36 - 1644.80] could move the needle and get them
[1642.72 - 1647.20] better. The information on this podcast
[1644.80 - 1648.96] is not man-made. It comes from above,
[1647.20 - 1650.96] from a higher source. Whatever you
[1648.96 - 1652.80] believe in, whether God, the universe,
[1650.96 - 1654.16] the light, or the creator, or if you
[1652.80 - 1655.44] believe in nothing at all, that we're
[1654.16 - 1657.20] just floating through space together on
[1655.44 - 1658.96] this rock, know that the information you
[1657.20 - 1660.72] hear on this podcast is separate from
[1658.96 - 1662.40] all the other noise out there. It comes
[1660.72 - 1664.96] from a different place. A pure
[1662.40 - 1667.92] untampered with advanced clean
[1664.96 - 1672.24] uncorrupted original primary source. A
[1667.92 - 1672.24] higher source, spirit of compassion.
