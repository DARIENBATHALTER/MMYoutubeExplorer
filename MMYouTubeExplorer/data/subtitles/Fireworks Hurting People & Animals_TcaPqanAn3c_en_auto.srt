00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,840
and in their yards all across the

192
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:01,039
country so it's neighborhoods it's

193
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,080
in the driveway a driveway next to a

194
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:06,000
house with pets

195
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:08,000
right there or elderly people that

196
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,840
you know that what about without people

197
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,199
that are like having difficult

198
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,360
problems they're breathing they're on

199
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,000
oxygen tanks what about people that

200
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,199
that are um you know elderly people that

201
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,759
had strokes

202
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,919
and they're you know they're home thank

203
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,759
god and they're at least alive and then

204
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,560
they're just blowing these bombs off

205
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,280
i've seen it

206
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,240
all for years but here's the thing it

207
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,599
got

208
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:34,319
really really bad last

209
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,680
year the last couple of years it got

210
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:39,039
really really bad

211
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,720
and it's gonna be the worst probably

212
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,160
this year because the whole thing with

213
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,800
covet and everything

214
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,479
right it's made this whole thing even a

215
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,560
little bit more complex

216
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,160
people just they kind of went insane

217
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,120
from being locked in their homes and all

218
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,720
their stuff just people

219
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,960
bought a lot of fireworks it's probably

220
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:58,000
way worse this year right

221
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:01,199
and it's really really it's

222
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,800
sad it's that and you know and no one

223
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:07,440
no one gets it a man in my neighbor lost

224
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,319
her dog he jumped the fence and was hit

225
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,000
by a car

226
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,000
because of the fireworks right scared

227
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,720
the dog over the fence

228
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,400
and they blow them they blow them off

229
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,319
they blow them off

230
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,240
all through the night everywhere and

231
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:23,599
it's not like anybody's

232
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,960
like stopping it or you know anything's

233
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,680
happening like that

234
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,400
it doesn't it doesn't work like that

235
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,520
it's just

236
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,840
it's just it's just terrible and i think

237
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,279
that

238
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,919
i think it's it's important to say

239
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,680
something about it this fourth of july

240
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,519
it's gotten so bad last few years i've

241
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,760
always seen it bad

242
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,480
yeah late night too they'll do it late

243
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,920
night as well so you know i mean

244
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,080
i've always been asked what do you do

245
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,640
what do you do and i say look i i know

246
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,920
that

247
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:54,560
lemon balm tea can't fix it right can't

248
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,279
fix people blowing these bombs off

249
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,839
non-stop

250
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,720
everywhere and it happens all night long

251
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,600
right

252
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,600

these fireworks are really out of hand i

270
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,839
cannot take it they release toxins in

271
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,600
the air and i want to talk about that

272
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,320
that's one thing i want to talk about

273
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,720
we get anxious causes anxiety my cats

274
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,839

275
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,519
understand

276
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,279
you guys on tick tock how you guys doing

277
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,080
thanks for coming on we're talking about

278
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,160
the firework

279
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,480
problem lorena good see everybody's

280
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:56,000
coming on and

281
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,760
and i think that you know uh the toxic

282
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,640
part okay so let's go into that part

283
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,920
right

284
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:04,399
fireworks are manufactured right

285
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,240
without eyeballs on them i want you to

286
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,600
know so there's no eyeballs on the

287
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,839
manufacturing of

288
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,120
of fireworks right and even if i

289
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,440
eyeballs were on them

290
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,880
in the industry they'd still be toxic

291
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,920
but they're

292
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,640
severely toxic fireworks aren't gun

293
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:23,200
powder

294
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:24,800
alone they're a brew of chemical toxins

295
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,560
and they just and and so when

296
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,640
everybody's blowing them off the stuff's

297
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,959
drifting and floating through the air

298
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,160
really bad for people with asthma bad

299
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,440
for people with all kinds of

300
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,839
sensitivities

301
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,720
and chemical sensitivities right all

302
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,920
that kind of stuff

303
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,920
and so this stuff just drifts and drips

304
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,279
and it's a chemical soup it's not

305
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,760
gun powder gun powder is just one aspect

306
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,320
of it

307
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,320
it's a chemical soup like literally a

308
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,440
chemical soup is what it is

309
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:56,399
and and so no one's even like

310
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,040
no one even is monitoring that no one

311
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,880
cares

312
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:03,120
about that no one cares whatsoever

313
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,040
i got nervous about people hurting

314
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,000
themselves too i mean that's just

315
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,839
one aspect exactly michelle that's one

316
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,040
aspect of it right there's always a

317
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,240
child that gets their

318
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,440
like hand blown off her fingers blown

319
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,720
off every single year

320
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,640
not one there's always like a good 100

321
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,640
children that get injured from it being

322
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,440
shot one way or shot the other and then

323
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,760
and then

324
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,560
you know causing a severe injury to kids

325
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,160
right

326
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,240
so there's that too and then that's

327
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:34,240
scary that's terrifying really

328
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:36,800
but it's it's terrifying

329
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,000
that it's all encompassed children's

330
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,079
injuries

331
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,120
babies getting like a form of shell

332
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,120
shock

333
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,880
in their life so here's how it works so

334
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,959
when the bombs are blowing up and you

335
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,959
got your little baby

336
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,240
and your little baby's hearing these

337
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:55,040
explosions

338
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,760
what happens is you don't know it but it

339
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,240
affects situations years later down the

340
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,480
road

341
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,079
in the child's life so it affects it and

342
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,320
even into adult

343
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,519
adulthood so people don't realize that

344
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,519
the shapes

345
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,120
it causes problems like it causes

346
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,880
problems

347
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,440
down the road and that's another thing

348
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,839
too i'm just sad about it all

349
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,560
conrad i once witnessed how a drunken

350
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,360
young man

351
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,200
blew off half of his thumb by holding on

352
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,639
to a big firecracker

353
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:26,880
in his hand without throwing it away

354
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,800
absolutely i mean there's hands blown

355
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:32,000
off there's

356
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,920
feet burned and toes blowing off there's

357
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,839
there's all that stuff for sure and

358
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,680
there's head injuries and deaths

359
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,079
there's deaths there's lots of those

360
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:43,279
every single year catherine elizabeth

361
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,240
espanol years ago we know a child that

362
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,959
died

363
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,800
from a mortar blowing up in his face

364
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:51,519

365
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,959

366
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,880
died

367
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:57,360
from it going to the face and just

368
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:01,360
blowing the child's face

369
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:05,279
off i mean literally

370
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,720
i know one tastes horrifying i don't

371
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,920
know anything worse than that actually

372
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,040
there's nothing worse than that on the

373
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,320
planet right

374
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:14,160
and so um

375
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,760

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,000
the lemon balm and stuff for people see

377
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,079

there's lots of them and they live

395
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,560

and family

404
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,560
um i think that i think one of the

405
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,000
things to consider really with it all is

406
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,880
that

407
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,079
is that it's a compilation of all of it

408
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,279
right you've got the elderly

409
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:21,519
people okay lots of them out there

410
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:24,079
right and lots of them are sick now so

411
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,360
we've got elderly people that are sick

412
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,720
and then we got young people that are

413
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,399
sick now two struggling with their

414
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,160
central nervous system struggling with

415
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,000
severe fatigue struggling with all kinds

416
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,560
of problems they got ocd

417
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,360
they got bipolar they got ptsd from

418
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,440
being sick

419
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,360
they got migraines they got all these

420
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,000
different issues right

421
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,440
and you guys know that and these bombs

422
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,320
blowing up it's just

423
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,360
downright torture just downright torture

424
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,839
it's heartbreaking

425
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,519
and and then you've got the wildfires

426
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,480
that happen from it like nobody cares

427
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:56,079
about that

428
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,440
does anybody realize after every fourth

429
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:00,720
of july

430
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,839
there's a serious fire in california

431
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,760
that starts

432
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:09,040
up like a new one and a really bad one

433
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:12,079
so let's just make the connection there

434
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:15,199
okay because every fourth of july

435
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:17,920
in california we have the fires

436
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,480
and they start up and then before they

437
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,360
become

438
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,320
raging which is like a week later two

439
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,519
weeks later

440
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:28,240
but they start it during the fourth and

441
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,920
it and they caught on and no one really

442
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,360
found out about it until late or a

443
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,040
little bit like a week later as it's

444
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,639
already blue

445
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:38,160
but you know everyone should be aware

446
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,759
they should bring awareness about this

447
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,880
stuff people should start voicing about

448
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,800
it

449
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,320
you know everybody's about them here's

450
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,399
the thing here's the thing that bothers

451
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,320
me the most right

452
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,079
is not bothers me the most but just one

453
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,920
of these things that bothers me right

454
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:54,079

00:15:54,079 --> 00:16:00,720
and yeah now so here's here's something

457
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:02,720
to consider okay it's like isn't

458
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,040

their

463
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:15,440
thoughts uh about like certain groups of

464
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,120
people are more apt to blow off

465
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,160

00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,600
the fourth of july

565
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,880
i'm not saying that all fireworks have

566
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,880
to be completely banned

567
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,000
it's not what it is it's like what has

568
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,280
to be done is

569
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,760
i don't think we should be allowed to

570
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,840
go and buy because quarter stick of

571
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,200
dynamite half stick of dynamite

572
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,840
these blockbusters right they're all

573
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:15,280
blockbusters they're m80s

574
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,720
m60s blockbusters their quarter stick of

575
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,840
dynamites have sticker dynamites they

576
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,360
get propelled in the air

577
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:23,120
through a rocket right and um i just

578
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,640
i just don't think that the cool that

579
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,760
those big bomb

580
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,600
blasts should be a part of it i think

581
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:33,200
that those big bomb blasts i think

582
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:35,440
curfews on on on fireworks too

583
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,039
i just don't think your neighbor should

584
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,480
be allowed to go get a half a stick of

585
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:43,200
dynamite and propel it in their driveway

586
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,400
while you got a one month baby one month

587
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,400
old baby

588
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,799
two dogs that might be seizuring cat

589
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:52,080
that might be seizuring

590
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:53,120
a war vet home whether a female or a

591
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,480
male warbuck

592
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:58,000
man or woman and uh at home

593
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,679
and i i just think i just think that

594
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,520
that shouldn't be

595
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,960
part of everything you know i think we

596
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,400
just should be mindful

597
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,159
and then the chronic illness and then

598
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,159
the elderly and then and then

599
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,600
i i know situations where you know you

600
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:13,440
got

601
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:15,360
an elderly person who's hypersensitive

602
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,039
been through enough in their life

603
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,760
they're older

604
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,080
sick and then they also have a pet and

605
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,240
they

606
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,400
can't even get the pet in the closet to

607
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,400
try to stop the seizures you know

608
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,840
because they're just too sick they're

609
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,559
going around in a walker

610
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,039
and they're trying to get their pets you

611
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:34,960
know

612
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:35,760
and war vets they had to serve the

613
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,480
country

614
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:40,159
they lived through the wars they they've

615
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,720
been through all that they've had

616
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,000
explosives blow up and around them and

617
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,440
close by they're damaged

618
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:50,799
emotionally uh spiritually

619
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,159
ptsd right you know

620
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:53,520
and when you think about that i just

621
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,360
don't think we should be blowing off

622
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,320
these bombs right next to the war vets

623
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,039
that could be you know

624
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:02,240
nearby got to have some respect i mean

625
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:04,720
they went to war to hear those bombs

626
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,799
right they didn't want to hear it in

627
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,159
their backyard while sitting in a chair

628
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,640
in the backyard or they don't want to

629
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,320
hear it

630
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,640
when they're trying to go to sleep at 10
