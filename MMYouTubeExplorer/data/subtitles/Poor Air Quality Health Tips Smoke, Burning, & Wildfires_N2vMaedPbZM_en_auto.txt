[0.36 - 4.02] many of you are aware of the massive
[2.40 - 5.58] fires that are happening right now out
[4.02 - 7.50] there and so many people are breathing
[5.58 - 9.24] in a lot of smoke I have family that's
[7.50 - 11.52] calling me and they're saying what do I
[9.24 - 12.78] do how do I deal with this so I got a
[11.52 - 14.64] couple of tips one I'm going to show you
[12.78 - 15.54] in a little bit with is water and a
[14.64 - 18.54] cloth
[15.54 - 20.22] the other is immune system and
[18.54 - 23.34] antioxidant support and I'll tell you
[20.22 - 24.96] why because what's in the air is a
[23.34 - 27.72] massive trigger for a lot of people with
[24.96 - 29.28] chronic illness that's my main concern
[27.72 - 32.04] people who are struggling with different
[29.28 - 33.78] health conditions autoimmune other types
[32.04 - 36.20] of health conditions they can be
[33.78 - 38.52] triggered easier than other people
[36.20 - 40.56] overall everybody should be concerned
[38.52 - 43.02] about breathing in too much smoke but
[40.56 - 46.44] it's not just the smoke itself like if
[43.02 - 48.84] you had a fire pit going or if you were
[46.44 - 51.36] breathing in some wood that was burning
[48.84 - 53.64] the smoke has chemicals in it because
[51.36 - 56.58] they're using fire retardants to
[53.64 - 58.80] actually Calm the Fire down or try to
[56.58 - 61.56] Die the fire out so they're dumping a
[58.80 - 64.08] lot of chemicals on the fire it becomes
[61.56 - 66.12] dust those particles float around and
[64.08 - 68.34] travel hundreds and hundreds thousands
[66.12 - 70.38] of vials so I just want to cover a few
[68.34 - 72.12] critical tips to start with right here
[70.38 - 73.98] glutathione
[72.12 - 75.60] that's one right there I endorse of
[73.98 - 77.34] energy that's the products I use it's
[75.60 - 79.76] the products I recommend my friends and
[77.34 - 81.96] family glutathione right there
[79.76 - 83.76] detoxification you gotta remember that
[81.96 - 85.98] whenever you see glutathione it's
[83.76 - 87.38] detoxification so it helps the body
[85.98 - 90.36] naturally
[87.38 - 93.20] detoxify and what happens is when you're
[90.36 - 96.42] breathing in smoke filled with chemicals
[93.20 - 98.58] and you're getting that inside your
[96.42 - 100.92] lungs inside your body it has to go
[98.58 - 103.20] somewhere it can't just sit inside the
[100.92 - 105.60] body we want to get it out eventually so
[103.20 - 107.70] that's glutathione right there it also
[105.60 - 109.74] supports your immune system glutathione
[107.70 - 112.32] as well so that's the best one I've ever
[109.74 - 113.82] seen right there because of energy and
[112.32 - 116.94] the four things they do with their
[113.82 - 118.02] purity which is incredible anyway micro
[116.94 - 120.12] C
[118.02 - 123.06] so vitamin C that's another one right
[120.12 - 125.34] there the energy micro C is an
[123.06 - 127.50] incredible antioxidant too so these are
[125.34 - 130.56] the ones I'm taking right now and I'm
[127.50 - 132.60] telling family and friends so let's move
[130.56 - 134.46] on to another one there's the propolis
[132.60 - 137.28] which is immune system now if you're
[134.46 - 139.46] wondering why immune system like why is
[137.28 - 143.04] he talking about immune system because
[139.46 - 146.88] chemicals and smoke in the air lowers
[143.04 - 148.80] our immune system it's a trigger and
[146.88 - 151.52] when it triggers us and triggers our
[148.80 - 154.68] immune system then we're open to other
[151.52 - 156.36] problems and so many people have healed
[154.68 - 157.92] so many problems out there and so many
[156.36 - 160.32] people have they're struggling with
[157.92 - 162.06] their health and so when we're dealing
[160.32 - 164.88] with triggers we're dealing with
[162.06 - 167.04] possible Avalanches with our health so
[164.88 - 168.18] these are things that are critical and
[167.04 - 169.26] this is what I'm telling friends and
[168.18 - 170.94] family
[169.26 - 173.88] propolis is another one that's the
[170.94 - 177.72] immune system right there zinc that's
[173.88 - 179.88] the immune system as well B12 that's for
[177.72 - 182.70] your cells overall and that's what your
[179.88 - 184.68] cells the thing is what happens with B12
[182.70 - 187.08] it supports a lot of different parts of
[184.68 - 188.52] the body like every part of the body so
[187.08 - 192.30] when you're dealing with smoke
[188.52 - 193.80] inhalation toxins in the air it's also a
[192.30 - 196.14] critical thing too so let's go into this
[193.80 - 197.70] part here what you see is a bowl of
[196.14 - 199.98] water
[197.70 - 202.86] now if you're going from your house to
[199.98 - 205.14] your car a lot of people are traveling a
[202.86 - 206.88] lot of people are on the road they may
[205.14 - 210.24] not be able to get some things they need
[206.88 - 213.00] because the time of year so what you're
[210.24 - 215.16] seeing right here is a quick easy tip
[213.00 - 217.92] which I really love so what I'm doing
[215.16 - 220.44] here so I just have a simple bowl of
[217.92 - 223.14] water I have a cloth right here now this
[220.44 - 225.84] is a dish cloth a dish towel I'm
[223.14 - 228.60] squeezing out excess water but I'm
[225.84 - 231.84] leaving the towel damp now if you have
[228.60 - 234.06] to be outside for some reason in this
[231.84 - 235.74] smoke you have to leave the house you
[234.06 - 239.16] have to go from your house to your car
[235.74 - 241.38] what you want to do is take a a damp
[239.16 - 243.72] cloth like this that you just squeeze
[241.38 - 245.52] the water out and you want to make like
[243.72 - 248.94] a cup
[245.52 - 251.76] and you take your hands like this see
[248.94 - 253.80] and you give yourself enough space you
[251.76 - 256.80] don't want it like this where your hands
[253.80 - 258.72] are just really close like that you want
[256.80 - 260.16] to give yourself enough space so there's
[258.72 - 264.00] air
[260.16 - 265.92] inside of here so you have a gap and
[264.00 - 268.62] then you take that and you put this over
[265.92 - 272.04] your mouth like this over your face like
[268.62 - 275.70] this and you breathe and what you're
[272.04 - 278.10] doing is it's not about whoa that's not
[275.70 - 279.96] as good as a mask or is that is a mask
[278.10 - 283.38] better is it not that's not what this is
[279.96 - 284.76] about because you can't soak a mask so
[283.38 - 286.50] that's one thing right there they just
[284.76 - 290.46] it doesn't really work you have to take
[286.50 - 292.62] a cloth like this get it wet you know do
[290.46 - 293.94] this like I said before get it in there
[292.62 - 296.34] nice and
[293.94 - 297.96] you don't want it dry in one part and
[296.34 - 301.14] that's a mistake that can happen where
[297.96 - 304.20] you only have it moist in one area
[301.14 - 306.00] dry in another you you don't want to do
[304.20 - 308.10] it that way you want to have the entire
[306.00 - 310.74] cloth wet
[308.10 - 312.66] not sopping wet where it's dripping all
[310.74 - 313.98] over you but you want it wet so I'm just
[312.66 - 315.36] going to squeeze it out a little bit
[313.98 - 319.14] more
[315.36 - 322.02] there we go you're trapping some of the
[319.14 - 326.28] smoke within it but the key is you're
[322.02 - 330.24] trapping chemicals dust particles dust
[326.28 - 332.22] that's being dropped onto the fire so
[330.24 - 334.32] the helicopters and the planes are
[332.22 - 337.74] dropping all that fire retardant onto
[334.32 - 339.84] the flames and so that dust those
[337.74 - 341.64] particles are what's in the air it makes
[339.84 - 344.64] it more difficult for people to breathe
[341.64 - 347.40] it gives people more complications it's
[344.64 - 349.02] a bigger trigger so if you're outside if
[347.40 - 351.66] you have to travel if you have to go to
[349.02 - 354.96] your car this is a simple easy way to do
[351.66 - 356.88] it now don't get too wrapped up with
[354.96 - 359.46] what kind of cloth if you have a dish
[356.88 - 361.50] towel a washcloth if you have anything
[359.46 - 363.06] like that and you take it you put it
[361.50 - 364.26] right up to your face and you make a
[363.06 - 367.14] really nice
[364.26 - 369.12] Wide Cup and you can breathe through
[367.14 - 372.42] that towel right there and you're
[369.12 - 375.00] breathing air and that air has all the
[372.42 - 377.46] dust particles chemical particles and it
[375.00 - 381.12] gets trapped easily within the moisture
[377.46 - 384.80] of the cloth now that's really effective
[381.12 - 388.20] I'm not saying that is like
[384.80 - 390.06] the end-all to what you're doing like
[388.20 - 391.38] that's going to fix it all you're still
[390.06 - 392.76] going to get some smoke in there you're
[391.38 - 395.28] still going to get some particles in
[392.76 - 398.16] there it's not something you want to use
[395.28 - 401.24] and go up to a fire with nothing like
[398.16 - 403.80] that this is just a quick tip from
[401.24 - 405.96] dealing with running from your house to
[403.80 - 408.42] your car dealing with being out there
[405.96 - 411.24] trapped in it maybe you're at a family
[408.42 - 413.34] event and you're Outdoors anything like
[411.24 - 415.32] that and you can just you know get a
[413.34 - 419.04] dish towel or a washcloth and do that
[415.32 - 422.28] it's helpful it helps to to minimize
[419.04 - 423.90] that smoke and those chemicals and the
[422.28 - 426.78] particles and the Dust
[423.90 - 429.48] and then once again important critical
[426.78 - 430.80] supplement like the glutathione which is
[429.48 - 434.10] a big one so right now I'm telling
[430.80 - 437.40] family and friends glutathione that's a
[434.10 - 439.92] big one right there and the micro C the
[437.40 - 441.72] antioxidants immune system immune system
[439.92 - 444.36] the immune system all the cells in your
[441.72 - 446.52] body so and if you can only get a few of
[444.36 - 449.16] these if you only have an opportunity to
[446.52 - 451.98] get three of them I would get the micro
[449.16 - 454.80] C the glutathione I would probably get
[451.98 - 457.80] those two and maybe the propolis but all
[454.80 - 460.08] of them are important and it's the
[457.80 - 463.98] quality of these you guys know I endorse
[460.08 - 465.30] these guys for a reason because it's the
[463.98 - 468.96] best stuff out there I've talked about
[465.30 - 470.76] the four reasons why there's nothing in
[468.96 - 472.20] these supplements that shouldn't be in
[470.76 - 473.82] there and other supplements and
[472.20 - 475.74] supplement companies they deal with
[473.82 - 477.00] there's a there's always things in
[475.74 - 478.86] people's supplements that they don't
[477.00 - 481.62] know about because legally you're
[478.86 - 483.54] allowed to have a certain percentage of
[481.62 - 486.54] ingredients that you don't disclose to
[483.54 - 489.00] the the actual consumer dimmers you
[486.54 - 491.76] won't do that it's actually the purest I
[489.00 - 494.16] can find out there but anyway you guys
