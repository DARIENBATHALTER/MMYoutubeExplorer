[0.00 - 5.70] Sure Shot how powerful and amazing and
[3.72 - 7.98] empowering that is right there I'm
[5.70 - 10.08] excited there it is let's see what it
[7.98 - 13.08] looks like whoa that's really that's
[10.08 - 18.18] awesome that's what we're doing right
[13.08 - 22.02] there today I am pumped up big time
[18.18 - 23.88] but more so than that I am excited to be
[22.02 - 26.82] talking about the pesticide herbicide
[23.88 - 28.74] fungicide exposure it's one of my
[26.82 - 32.66] favorite topics to be honest
[28.74 - 34.20] It's a combination of being sad
[32.66 - 35.78] huh
[34.20 - 39.72] and happy
[35.78 - 41.22] yeah it's a combination of both because
[39.72 - 43.02] when you think about pesticides
[41.22 - 44.70] herbicides and fungicides and how they
[43.02 - 48.60] actually really do affect our lives and
[44.70 - 51.48] how we do get exposed to them and then
[48.60 - 53.16] that's the sad part like what I'm
[51.48 - 55.02] exposed to this this is what we're going
[53.16 - 57.90] to talk about which is kind of shocking
[55.02 - 60.84] look out your mind might go boom right
[57.90 - 63.42] and then the happy part can we do
[60.84 - 66.84] anything about it is there anything to
[63.42 - 69.12] do about it what can we do and that's
[66.84 - 71.16] the other part I'm Anthony William the
[69.12 - 73.56] medical medium this is the brain saver
[71.16 - 75.48] book I'm reading this is the brain saver
[73.56 - 77.22] medical medium range shot therapy
[75.48 - 80.16] cleanse challenge I'm excited you guys
[77.22 - 83.82] so let's get down to it why not
[80.16 - 86.16] why not because this is look I got a
[83.82 - 89.28] thing for pesticides and herbicides and
[86.16 - 92.82] fungicides I really do because it's one
[89.28 - 95.28] of those antagonists that neuro
[92.82 - 97.80] antagonists that are in everybody's face
[95.28 - 99.12] but people don't know it and they don't
[97.80 - 104.28] realize it
[99.12 - 106.98] and so I like this topic because when
[104.28 - 110.76] people don't know what's going on
[106.98 - 113.28] and you can actually educate you can
[110.76 - 115.14] provide information that's incredible so
[113.28 - 118.08] they can then protect themselves it
[115.14 - 120.06] feels good like this is a feel-good
[118.08 - 122.76] topic for me
[120.06 - 125.76] because it's about awareness and when
[122.76 - 129.24] people become aware it changes the world
[125.76 - 133.68] and that's amazing so let's go into it a
[129.24 - 135.84] little bit so I'm on page 224 by the way
[133.68 - 138.24] it's day 18. I'm actually blown away
[135.84 - 140.76] like how are we getting through this
[138.24 - 141.72] we're going 20 days are we really gonna
[140.76 - 148.20] do this
[141.72 - 151.46] I'm on page 224 brain saver right there
[148.20 - 151.46] let's cut into it
[151.88 - 158.34] Rogue spraying practices whoa that's
[155.40 - 159.36] interesting on a Zone let's just I'm
[158.34 - 161.64] going through this now this is
[159.36 - 163.74] incredible common chemical neuro
[161.64 - 165.72] antagonists just going to give you a
[163.74 - 167.76] little bit of a rundown
[165.72 - 169.86] chemical fertilizers
[167.76 - 170.94] okay but you're not exposed to any of
[169.86 - 172.80] those
[170.94 - 177.06] yes you are
[172.80 - 179.16] lawn treatments lawn treatments huh but
[177.06 - 181.58] you're not exposed to any of those
[179.16 - 184.74] yes you are
[181.58 - 186.54] insecticides including ant killer
[184.74 - 188.18] Roach Killer
[186.54 - 193.08] spider killer
[188.18 - 195.36] wasp killer silverfish killer
[193.08 - 198.60] tick killer
[195.36 - 202.16] flea killer might kill her you're not
[198.60 - 205.20] exposed to any of this uh yes you are
[202.16 - 207.54] mosquito killer you're definitely
[205.20 - 209.94] exposed to Mosquito Killers sorry to say
[207.54 - 211.98] that this is this is an interesting
[209.94 - 214.32] episode today
[211.98 - 218.94] we're live right now by the way termite
[214.32 - 222.36] killer uh-huh termite killer yeah and
[218.94 - 226.02] gypsy moth killer oh I'm not exposed to
[222.36 - 228.30] gypsy moth killer yes you are
[226.02 - 230.60] all right
[228.30 - 234.42] here's a bullet point right here
[230.60 - 237.54] nighttime aerial insecticide spray
[234.42 - 240.96] uh-huh planet Earth
[237.54 - 242.58] has something very evil
[240.96 - 246.42] within it
[242.58 - 248.10] and they do the nighttime aerial spray
[246.42 - 249.84] on every village
[248.10 - 251.58] on every town
[249.84 - 253.32] in every County
[251.58 - 256.92] in every state
[253.32 - 258.90] in every country across the world
[256.92 - 262.38] that's what they do
[258.90 - 265.20] it's so certain helicopters with vials
[262.38 - 267.42] on them releasing a mist
[265.20 - 271.82] and it's aerosol
[267.42 - 271.82] aerial insecticide spray
[271.98 - 276.84] all right see why this is like one of my
[273.90 - 279.24] favorite favorite subjects
[276.84 - 282.96] so we're on page 24
[279.24 - 284.22] not page 24 sorry chapter 24 page 223 a
[282.96 - 286.88] brain saver
[284.22 - 289.26] and we're reading about chemical neuro
[286.88 - 290.82] antagonists and we don't think we're
[289.26 - 292.80] exposed to
[290.82 - 295.32] now I personally would rather know what
[292.80 - 298.26] I'm exposed to so that I can do things
[295.32 - 300.78] to look out I can be careful I could
[298.26 - 302.88] make sure I don't walk into a lawn
[300.78 - 305.28] treatment that's being sprayed I make
[302.88 - 307.44] sure that a family member or family
[305.28 - 309.36] members aren't walking into a lawn
[307.44 - 312.24] treatment that's being sprayed or
[309.36 - 314.70] whatever so it's like I like this
[312.24 - 317.96] information because you can do something
[314.70 - 317.96] it's empowering
[318.50 - 324.12] larvicides yeah heck yeah rodenticides a
[322.74 - 326.04] hot rat killer
[324.12 - 327.60] there's rat killer everywhere on crops
[326.04 - 328.98] conventional crops there's rat killer
[327.60 - 330.90] and buildings there's rat killer and
[328.98 - 335.36] condos there's Rock rat killer
[330.90 - 335.36] everywhere around buildings
[335.94 - 340.74] other pesticides of course
[339.24 - 341.76] sea trails
[340.74 - 346.44] yep
[341.76 - 348.32] chemical neuro antagonists sea trails
[346.44 - 351.00] that's right
[348.32 - 352.10] herbicides you know sea trails
[351.00 - 355.86] right
[352.10 - 357.96] herbicides DDT and fungicides but ddt's
[355.86 - 361.08] not around here anymore all right we
[357.96 - 364.32] don't have to worry about DDT anymore
[361.08 - 367.20] no we don't have to right it's only
[364.32 - 370.56] dropped out of planes
[367.20 - 374.88] up in the sky that leave the streak in
[370.56 - 377.58] the sky with old abandoned
[374.88 - 381.78] excess DDT
[377.58 - 384.00] that has been filled into it right DDT
[381.78 - 386.88] is everywhere too by the way it floats
[384.00 - 388.68] around continents it floats around the
[386.88 - 390.90] earth we still breathe it in and
[388.68 - 392.94] everybody still has a portion of DDT
[390.90 - 394.14] inside their livers and bodies that's
[392.94 - 397.08] passed down from generation to
[394.14 - 398.88] generation to generation PBT didn't go
[397.08 - 401.46] away
[398.88 - 404.18] like I said sea Trails right
[401.46 - 407.52] the old plane
[404.18 - 409.02] and fungicides that's another one
[407.52 - 412.32] fungicides I don't get exposed to
[409.02 - 414.42] fungicides are you kidding oh yeah you
[412.32 - 417.30] do you do get exposed to fungicides
[414.42 - 420.06] every single new article of clothing you
[417.30 - 422.64] buy including organic clothing can be
[420.06 - 423.66] laced with the fungicide you can smell
[422.64 - 427.50] it
[423.66 - 430.44] if you learn the smell of fungicide
[427.50 - 432.90] smoke exposure of any kind
[430.44 - 435.84] including cigarettes
[432.90 - 439.62] yum yum marijuana
[435.84 - 442.14] yum yum vaping yum yum
[439.62 - 445.08] yummy smoke smells
[442.14 - 446.88] smells good anyway people get exposed to
[445.08 - 448.92] that too and how about this one
[446.88 - 452.34] fluoride
[448.92 - 454.98] fluoride interesting right yeah fluoride
[452.34 - 457.80] treatments fluoride in general and
[454.98 - 460.26] chlorine how many people are exposed to
[457.80 - 462.50] chlorine so I love that chemical neuro
[460.26 - 465.60] antagonist section
[462.50 - 466.80] inside brain saver I'm going to read a
[465.60 - 470.24] little bit about it let's do the fun
[466.80 - 470.24] part that wasn't even the fun part
[470.94 - 475.20] okay
[472.02 - 478.44] chemical neuro antagonists sounds like
[475.20 - 480.42] such a serious category that it must be
[478.44 - 482.10] difficult to come in contact with any of
[480.42 - 484.20] these chemical agents right
[482.10 - 486.66] I'm not exposed to any chemical neuro
[484.20 - 489.30] antagonists what kind of world are you
[486.66 - 490.92] living in that's not me I'm not exposed
[489.30 - 492.96] to that
[490.92 - 495.54] quite the contrary
[492.96 - 498.30] we're up against these brain betrayers
[495.54 - 501.12] more than we know
[498.30 - 502.92] walk through a park
[501.12 - 505.44] if you walk through a park
[502.92 - 508.02] they hose those Parks down they've been
[505.44 - 510.72] doing it for a hundred years
[508.02 - 512.58] parks are hosed down
[510.72 - 516.54] with all kinds of chemical neuro
[512.58 - 518.40] antagonists hosed down
[516.54 - 520.38] I know
[518.40 - 522.30] it's just a fact
[520.38 - 524.66] s are hosed down with chemical
[522.30 - 527.94] antagonists
[524.66 - 530.16] golf anybody want to play some golf
[527.94 - 534.20] right
[530.16 - 537.42] well golf it's the same way golf courses
[534.20 - 540.38] really hose down chemical fertilizers
[537.42 - 542.52] that's a huge one chemical fertilizers
[540.38 - 546.36] pesticides herbicides especially
[542.52 - 551.06] herbicides all sprayed on golf courses
[546.36 - 551.06] they're at least sometimes twice a week
[551.58 - 557.76] what else campus green
[555.60 - 561.72] campus greens
[557.76 - 565.82] what is that college universities campus
[561.72 - 569.78] greens laced with fungicides herbicides
[565.82 - 569.78] pesticides rodenticides
[570.12 - 575.22] so we got that one there that's a fun
[572.10 - 578.28] one or Town Commons you're sitting in
[575.22 - 580.92] the town common the Town Square the town
[578.28 - 583.62] green definitely
[580.92 - 587.58] laced
[583.62 - 591.18] eating conventional grown produce duh
[587.58 - 594.12] we get a little bit of that in us anyway
[591.18 - 597.48] food made from a conventional grown crop
[594.12 - 598.86] or even organic food grown on former
[597.48 - 601.80] conventional fields and that's another
[598.86 - 604.62] thing we can't ex we can't escape the
[601.80 - 605.76] neuro antagonists we can avoid a lot of
[604.62 - 610.20] them
[605.76 - 613.86] but organic food is grown out of land
[610.20 - 616.02] that's been saturated from DDT saturated
[613.86 - 619.50] from conventional sprays
[616.02 - 621.66] saturated from pesticide herbicides
[619.50 - 624.00] they wait like seven years and then an
[621.66 - 626.16] organic farm moves in and organic crops
[624.00 - 628.86] are grown right seven years doesn't rip
[626.16 - 631.20] DDT out of soil I'm sorry but it doesn't
[628.86 - 634.02] and it doesn't rip DDT out of soil from
[631.20 - 636.12] 50 years ago it doesn't read pesticides
[634.02 - 638.64] out of soil
[636.12 - 641.10] organic crops have pesticides we can't
[638.64 - 643.20] get away from it
[641.10 - 645.30] organic food grown on former
[643.20 - 648.90] conventional fields which is virtually
[645.30 - 651.42] almost every single organic feel this is
[648.90 - 654.18] critical to know they're not chopping
[651.42 - 657.86] down forest here in the United States to
[654.18 - 660.90] grow a organic field
[657.86 - 662.88] organic fields are organic fields that
[660.90 - 665.40] have taken over conventional fields we
[662.88 - 667.80] need to understand this it's yes eat
[665.40 - 669.48] organic food absolutely
[667.80 - 671.64] but understand
[669.48 - 673.74] that that organic food is growing
[671.64 - 676.14] unconventional fields
[673.74 - 677.40] because they were all conventional
[676.14 - 680.58] fields
[677.40 - 683.64] all of them were conventional fields to
[680.58 - 686.22] start with going back decades ago they
[683.64 - 687.48] were all conventional produce Fields you
[686.22 - 691.14] guys
[687.48 - 692.16] and slowly organic moved in on these
[691.14 - 694.98] fields
[692.16 - 696.84] they bought the conventional farms and
[694.98 - 698.76] they grew organic produce that's how
[696.84 - 702.44] it's done
[698.76 - 702.44] incredible information right
[702.54 - 707.58] okay eat
[704.54 - 709.74] conventionally raised chicken or pork or
[707.58 - 711.60] beef or fish people do that all the time
[709.74 - 714.36] yes they get exposure
[711.60 - 715.80] handle conventionally grown
[714.36 - 719.82] flowers
[715.80 - 721.62] someone sent me flowers the other day
[719.82 - 723.60] they're released
[721.62 - 727.44] it was a really good
[723.60 - 729.60] nice gift it was incredible gesture
[727.44 - 732.00] it was pleasing
[729.60 - 734.40] there's beautiful flowers
[732.00 - 738.18] but they're laced
[734.40 - 740.84] conventional grown flowers
[738.18 - 740.84] and then
[741.36 - 747.48] there's neighbors chemically treated
[745.14 - 749.10] yards
[747.48 - 751.08] so that's a big one there so neighbors
[749.10 - 753.84] if you have a neighbor they chemically
[751.08 - 755.70] treat the yards does everybody know but
[753.84 - 757.92] most everybody does if the neighbor
[755.70 - 759.78] doesn't the other neighbor does
[757.92 - 760.98] if the other neighbor doesn't this
[759.78 - 763.20] neighbor does
[760.98 - 764.88] so there's a treatment coming somewhere
[763.20 - 766.02] someone's getting a spray around their
[764.88 - 767.76] house someone's getting into remote
[766.02 - 769.92] spray someone's getting some kind of
[767.76 - 772.32] mosquito spray or tick spray someone's
[769.92 - 773.88] getting a ant spray
[772.32 - 775.50] it's just over and over again someone's
[773.88 - 777.12] getting fertilizer on their little lawn
[775.50 - 778.80] patch someone's getting some fungicide
[777.12 - 780.48] sprayed on their weeds someone's getting
[778.80 - 782.82] some weed killer sprayed on their weeds
[780.48 - 784.38] it's just you can't get away from it if
[782.82 - 786.12] it isn't this neighbor then it's this
[784.38 - 787.92] neighbor here and then the wind blows
[786.12 - 789.36] that to you then it's if it's not that
[787.92 - 790.98] neighbor it's this neighbor here and the
[789.36 - 793.80] wind blows that to you if you're in an
[790.98 - 795.78] apartment building same thing
[793.80 - 798.30] same thing people bomb their Apartments
[795.78 - 800.34] Apartment next door to you inside an
[798.30 - 803.22] apartment building they're bombing it
[800.34 - 804.96] that bombing is a pesticide herbicide
[803.22 - 806.76] fungicide bomb
[804.96 - 809.22] it happens all the time people get
[806.76 - 811.86] people get pesticide bombs inside their
[809.22 - 814.98] Apartments to get rid of bed bugs to get
[811.86 - 816.66] rid of silverfish to get rid of fleas
[814.98 - 818.82] so in apartment buildings it's all the
[816.66 - 821.04] same everybody's bombing for fleas in
[818.82 - 823.86] one apartment at Roaches for another one
[821.04 - 825.00] silverfish in another one bed bugs in
[823.86 - 827.18] another one
[825.00 - 827.18] foreign
[828.96 - 833.90] can't you see why this is one of my
[831.00 - 833.90] favorite topics
[835.56 - 839.88] in chemical lawn fertilizers and
[838.02 - 842.52] treatments people often spray the
[839.88 - 843.72] interiors and exteriors of schools oh
[842.52 - 846.72] that's a big one right there the
[843.72 - 849.48] institutions the institutions
[846.72 - 852.42] have to purchase spray
[849.48 - 853.68] they have to have contracts with
[852.42 - 856.46] chemical
[853.68 - 858.84] spray companies
[856.46 - 863.16] so schools
[858.84 - 866.94] have to have contracts with all of the
[863.16 - 869.36] extermination services and everything
[866.94 - 869.36] else
[869.46 - 874.08] they spray the interiors and exteriors
[871.62 - 877.38] of schools offices apartment complexes
[874.08 - 880.44] dorm rooms dorm rooms are big
[877.38 - 883.20] the bed bug spray they use in those
[880.44 - 885.84] unbelievable dorm rooms hotels houses
[883.20 - 889.14] warehouses storage facilities and other
[885.84 - 891.12] buildings with roach killer ant killer
[889.14 - 893.22] termite killer wasp killer mosquito
[891.12 - 895.68] killer tick killer and more
[893.22 - 898.04] so it's all too easy to breathe in or
[895.68 - 901.74] even touch chemical neuro antagonist
[898.04 - 903.84] contamination you guys
[901.74 - 906.60] it's how easy it is
[903.84 - 908.70] fear-mongering anyone no
[906.60 - 911.40] it's important to know what's around you
[908.70 - 915.18] because it stops a person from walking
[911.40 - 917.34] into it I've watched it for years I see
[915.18 - 919.26] it outside if I'm in a car somewhere
[917.34 - 922.50] driving or being driven around or
[919.26 - 924.72] something I see like literally people
[922.50 - 927.06] with those canisters and people walking
[924.72 - 929.34] by just not even realizing and breathing
[927.06 - 931.74] it in it happens everywhere on the side
[929.34 - 934.20] of Highways every place
[931.74 - 936.48] it's really incredible

[944.10 - 949.86] waking up with massive headaches and my
[947.04 - 951.90] apartment was filled with the smell

[987.66 - 991.86] Tate says
[989.40 - 994.32] I've healed and got rid of over a dozen
[991.86 - 996.24] symptoms using conventional produce with
[994.32 - 997.80] the medical media books and info and t I
[996.24 - 999.96] talk about that that people can use
[997.80 - 1002.60] conventional produce and heal absolutely
[999.96 - 1004.94] I talk about how conventional celery you
[1002.60 - 1008.24] can't get organic conventional produce
[1004.94 - 1012.14] if you can't get organic
[1008.24 - 1013.70] foreign practices
[1012.14 - 1017.78] Rogue
[1013.70 - 1020.00] keep in mind on that word rogue
[1017.78 - 1022.82] organic crops
[1020.00 - 1025.76] whoa
[1022.82 - 1028.58] organic crops
[1025.76 - 1031.22] while organic crops aren't sprayed with
[1028.58 - 1033.20] conventional pesticides
[1031.22 - 1035.84] and herbicides
[1033.20 - 1037.54] still come with exposures
[1035.84 - 1041.12] for one
[1037.54 - 1043.64] organic farming relies upon
[1041.12 - 1045.32] the same solvents
[1043.64 - 1048.50] degreasers
[1045.32 - 1051.26] and cleaning agents for their equipment
[1048.50 - 1054.64] tractors and trucks
[1051.26 - 1054.64] as conventional farming
[1054.80 - 1060.16] if you know anything like that
[1056.78 - 1060.16] I've driven a tractor
[1060.20 - 1063.94] I've greased a tractor
[1064.28 - 1068.66] I've maintenance
[1066.50 - 1072.16] equipment
[1068.66 - 1072.16] I know what this means
[1072.56 - 1077.48] it's not like Organic Farms
[1074.96 - 1079.76] are free from solvents chemicals
[1077.48 - 1081.68] degreasers
[1079.76 - 1084.14] all kinds of different
[1081.68 - 1086.42] agents
[1084.14 - 1089.48] exhaust coming out of tractors gets
[1086.42 - 1093.74] blown on all the crops your Organic Crop
[1089.48 - 1095.66] is still going to get diesel fumes
[1093.74 - 1098.12] blown
[1095.66 - 1100.94] on all the crops
[1098.12 - 1103.24] every single day as the tractors go up
[1100.94 - 1103.24] and down
[1103.46 - 1107.36] foreign
[1105.14 - 1109.34] it's just interesting right I mean isn't
[1107.36 - 1110.72] that interesting it's just it's
[1109.34 - 1112.96] incredible to have this window of
[1110.72 - 1112.96] information
[1113.60 - 1121.16] this exposure Finds Its way into produce
[1117.68 - 1123.02] plus dangerous mosquito sprays and other
[1121.16 - 1125.06] insecticides are dumped out of
[1123.02 - 1127.04] helicopters and planes all around the
[1125.06 - 1128.72] U.S and other places around the world I
[1127.04 - 1130.64] talked about that
[1128.72 - 1132.50] these high concentrations of mosquito
[1130.64 - 1134.72] spray
[1132.50 - 1136.40] from low-flying planes and low-flying
[1134.72 - 1138.44] helicopters Dallas organic crops
[1136.40 - 1139.70] including Fields where grass-fed cattle
[1138.44 - 1145.12] are grazing
[1139.70 - 1145.12] just as they do any other Farm or yard
[1145.64 - 1151.04] why do they spray mosquito spray in
[1148.52 - 1153.74] every single part of the world
[1151.04 - 1156.62] because they grow the mosquitoes
[1153.74 - 1159.32] genetically mutate and alter them
[1156.62 - 1161.78] GMO the mosquitoes and let trillions and
[1159.32 - 1163.70] trillions of mosquitoes out daily
[1161.78 - 1165.68] so that the mosquito come spray
[1163.70 - 1167.96] companies
[1165.68 - 1169.46] convince everybody that you got to pay
[1167.96 - 1170.90] the bill
[1169.46 - 1172.58] they convinced all the governments you
[1170.90 - 1175.52] have to pay the bill all around the
[1172.58 - 1177.44] world and so there's mosquito spray two
[1175.52 - 1179.78] stop mosquitoes that they're growing and
[1177.44 - 1181.16] releasing right you see this sick sick
[1179.78 - 1183.62] world we live in
[1181.16 - 1185.74] Stevens Ranch says you give us hope and
[1183.62 - 1189.64] strength to heal
[1185.74 - 1189.64] amazing incredible yeah
[1191.24 - 1193.96] yeah so
[1194.48 - 1199.64] the chemical companies providing the
[1197.18 - 1203.44] spray and flight patterns do not
[1199.64 - 1203.44] purposely avoid Organic Farms
[1206.54 - 1212.42] yeah yeah Mac yep
[1210.50 - 1215.48] yeah yeah there's a whole bunch of
[1212.42 - 1216.68] organic farms ahead of you change your
[1215.48 - 1220.52] trajectory
[1216.68 - 1222.92] yep just keep on no no don't don't spray
[1220.52 - 1223.94] that mosquito spray there's a whole
[1222.92 - 1225.98] bunch of
[1223.94 - 1229.58] vegans
[1225.98 - 1231.92] and animal protein vegetable fruit Eater
[1229.58 - 1233.36] people they love their organic produce
[1231.92 - 1236.84] Don't Spray that mosquito spray over
[1233.36 - 1239.66] there okay right on all right Roger out
[1236.84 - 1242.48] no it doesn't work that way every single
[1239.66 - 1244.76] organic farm is sprayed
[1242.48 - 1247.40] through helicopters in the air dropping
[1244.76 - 1250.58] mosquito spray it is not immune to it
[1247.40 - 1253.60] they don't just stop they go over every
[1250.58 - 1253.60] place everywhere
[1254.18 - 1256.42] foreign
[1256.78 - 1261.68] cities and towns are sprayed by
[1259.04 - 1263.66] helicopter for bugs like mosquitoes and
[1261.68 - 1265.88] gypsy moth caterpillars
[1263.66 - 1268.70] so see if you can find out the local
[1265.88 - 1270.50] schedule and stay indoors with windows
[1268.70 - 1272.24] closed at those times but chances are
[1270.50 - 1274.64] they won't tell you any local schedules
[1272.24 - 1276.38] because they won't there's very few
[1274.64 - 1278.48] places in the world
[1276.38 - 1281.12] that tell you there's going to be
[1278.48 - 1282.80] helicopter spray for mosquitoes some
[1281.12 - 1284.90] counties do in some areas of this
[1282.80 - 1285.98] country and around the world but it's
[1284.90 - 1288.68] rare
[1285.98 - 1290.54] and it's not always accurate keep in
[1288.68 - 1292.88] mind that scheduling is never a
[1290.54 - 1293.84] definitive operation I have it right
[1292.88 - 1296.30] here
[1293.84 - 1298.82] even if you have the local schedule in
[1296.30 - 1301.52] hand it is not guaranteed to be correct
[1298.82 - 1304.40] timing is never exact
[1301.52 - 1306.86] ly never is very interesting
[1304.40 - 1310.34] it's always extremely loosey-goosey
[1306.86 - 1313.34] that's a word lucy-goosey and spraying
[1310.34 - 1315.14] is often done without forewarning trust
[1313.34 - 1316.82] your instincts if you see here or smell
[1315.14 - 1320.08] something suspicious
[1316.82 - 1320.08] use your Snoop
[1320.12 - 1324.50] on IG
[1321.86 - 1326.54] nit uh says why do you keep writing so
[1324.50 - 1329.00] many books why not write everything in
[1326.54 - 1330.74] one book well
[1329.00 - 1332.60] that's what I tried to do where's my
[1330.74 - 1335.98] other book here oh let me just get it
[1332.60 - 1335.98] over here excuse me
[1336.56 - 1340.64] this is one book
[1338.24 - 1344.84] right there it is
[1340.64 - 1346.52] it's the old one book too big too much
[1344.84 - 1348.74] information
[1346.52 - 1351.62] bookstores don't want a book this big
[1348.74 - 1353.60] publisher can't print out books this big
[1351.62 - 1356.18] shipping books this big is really hard
[1353.60 - 1358.52] and this book's 12 pounds I think I mean
[1356.18 - 1360.14] don't quote me on that I don't know but
[1358.52 - 1361.52] it feels like it's 10 pounds or
[1360.14 - 1364.84] something
[1361.52 - 1364.84] and I have to say uncle
[1367.64 - 1370.70] because
[1368.84 - 1373.10] I have to say uncle to Spirit of
[1370.70 - 1375.26] compassion because
[1373.10 - 1378.02] these books
[1375.26 - 1380.72] take a lot out of me
[1378.02 - 1382.28] and there's eight big ones
[1380.72 - 1384.56] there's eight books packed with
[1382.28 - 1386.24] information too much information to fit
[1384.56 - 1388.40] into them
[1386.24 - 1389.96] and I just pray to God every day to give
[1388.40 - 1393.52] me the strength to listen to Spirit of
[1389.96 - 1393.52] compassion and write another book
[1394.40 - 1397.84] thank you for asking
[1400.04 - 1404.24] if you like going to a public park find
[1402.56 - 1407.24] out his particular treatment schedule
[1404.24 - 1409.10] too and see if you can wait for a good
[1407.24 - 1411.50] Reign between when it's sprayed or
[1409.10 - 1413.00] fertilized and when you can visit if
[1411.50 - 1415.04] you're sensitive keep in mind for people
[1413.00 - 1416.54] who have chronic illness this is this
[1415.04 - 1419.30] tips to scale
[1416.54 - 1423.76] you sit in a park on the ground
[1419.30 - 1423.76] that was just doused with herbicide
[1423.80 - 1427.28] and it's woofing everywhere and you
[1425.60 - 1429.38] smell it everywhere let's make her break
[1427.28 - 1431.00] when you got chronic sickness that's
[1429.38 - 1433.16] make or break
[1431.00 - 1435.94] when you got chronic sickness set you
[1433.16 - 1435.94] back for weeks
[1436.40 - 1441.26] when you do go take along a blanket so
[1438.68 - 1443.24] you don't end up sitting untreated grass
[1441.26 - 1445.70] treated ground
[1443.24 - 1448.46] pregnant women should take special care
[1445.70 - 1450.32] with all of this direct pesticide
[1448.46 - 1452.74] herbicide or fungicide exposure can be
[1450.32 - 1455.66] enough to cause pregnancy complications
[1452.74 - 1456.92] that kind of intense skull and crossbone
[1455.66 - 1459.56] exposure
[1456.92 - 1461.72] which is sprayed directly out of trucks
[1459.56 - 1465.38] and canisters
[1461.72 - 1467.30] on the ground direct exposure to that
[1465.38 - 1468.92] spray like if they're spraying and a
[1467.30 - 1470.90] pregnant woman is breathing it in it's
[1468.92 - 1471.68] getting in her in her face and on her
[1470.90 - 1475.66] skin
[1471.68 - 1475.66] can be a dangerous thing
[1475.94 - 1481.04] June says in IG the area here sprays at
[1478.88 - 1482.78] night and if I have windows open I
[1481.04 - 1485.24] quickly try to close the windows it's
[1482.78 - 1488.90] awful smelling too
[1485.24 - 1491.96] I believe you because I've seen it for
[1488.90 - 1494.32] years anywhere I've lived in the United
[1491.96 - 1494.32] States
[1494.90 - 1499.46] here's an interesting part right here
[1497.18 - 1501.02] DDT isn't gone
[1499.46 - 1504.50] DDT
[1501.02 - 1507.26] is in a pesticide class all on its own
[1504.50 - 1509.36] this toxin it seems like a problem of
[1507.26 - 1512.24] the past because it's in the past it's
[1509.36 - 1515.06] still very much with us today it's in
[1512.24 - 1516.32] our oceans it's in our Lakes it's in our
[1515.06 - 1518.54] streams
[1516.32 - 1521.54] it's in our reservoirs
[1518.54 - 1523.36] and other water reservoirs agricultural
[1521.54 - 1526.88] fields and more
[1523.36 - 1528.56] DDT is in all those places plus it's
[1526.88 - 1530.78] still in use in some parts of the world
[1528.56 - 1533.90] it's still in use
[1530.78 - 1535.22] it's in use in a lot of places in in the
[1533.90 - 1538.24] world
[1535.22 - 1538.24] it's incredible really
[1538.64 - 1542.90] plus it's still in use in some parts of
[1540.50 - 1545.54] the world and what and wins you know the
[1542.90 - 1547.88] wind air
[1545.54 - 1551.84] can even carry it from continent to
[1547.88 - 1553.82] continent what's more DDT passes along
[1551.84 - 1555.80] through Bloodlines from generation to
[1553.82 - 1558.74] generation so
[1555.80 - 1561.92] if one of your forebears was exposed in
[1558.74 - 1564.32] ddt's Heyday that same DVT from back
[1561.92 - 1566.36] then could now be in your body and brain
[1564.32 - 1569.74] my father
[1566.36 - 1569.74] the medical medium's father
[1570.32 - 1574.64] he just told me recently and he's told
[1572.24 - 1576.02] me before but he reminded me that when
[1574.64 - 1577.76] he was a kid
[1576.02 - 1581.06] he used to play
[1577.76 - 1583.58] right behind the DVT trucks they used to
[1581.06 - 1585.98] drive by through the parks and him and
[1583.58 - 1588.32] his friends would run up behind the
[1585.98 - 1590.06] truck and they would spray
[1588.32 - 1595.22] all the kids down
[1590.06 - 1598.10] my dad said he was sprayed a lot
[1595.22 - 1600.14] he had Direct DBT application all on his
[1598.10 - 1601.82] body was just set it up all in his hair
[1600.14 - 1603.32] and all over his body
[1601.82 - 1605.00] and
[1603.32 - 1607.88] that means
[1605.00 - 1609.44] he passed it on down to me
[1607.88 - 1611.42] so
[1609.44 - 1613.94] just being born
[1611.42 - 1615.32] I had DDT contamination the medical
[1613.94 - 1618.10] media
[1615.32 - 1618.10] it's incredible
[1619.52 - 1624.92] in farming a lot of fields are recycled
[1623.36 - 1627.38] oh wait there's still a little bit more
[1624.92 - 1629.48] DDT passes along through Bloodlines from
[1627.38 - 1631.76] generation to generation so if one of
[1629.48 - 1634.64] your forebears was exposed in ddt's
[1631.76 - 1638.66] Heyday that same DDT from back then
[1634.64 - 1640.06] could now be in your body and brain
[1638.66 - 1643.58] correct
[1640.06 - 1646.66] in farming a lot of fields are recycled
[1643.58 - 1650.00] almost all the Farmland is in use today
[1646.66 - 1651.98] is Farmland from the 1930s 40s and 50s
[1650.00 - 1656.42] so this is interesting
[1651.98 - 1659.96] almost all of the Farmland we use today
[1656.42 - 1662.18] is recycled it's from the 30s the 40s
[1659.96 - 1663.86] the 50s and the 60s on IG saved by
[1662.18 - 1666.08] plants my father played behind those
[1663.86 - 1667.70] trucks too
[1666.08 - 1670.00] it's incredible
[1667.70 - 1672.86] it's incredible
[1670.00 - 1675.08] in 1960s that was heavily sprayed with
[1672.86 - 1676.58] DDT so all the Recycled Farms that were
[1675.08 - 1678.56] actually eating our food out were spread
[1676.58 - 1682.42] with DDT but not just sprayed with DDT
[1678.56 - 1682.42] like sprayed with DVT
[1682.64 - 1688.28] so DDT is still in the dirt
[1685.94 - 1690.68] that's true whether the Farmland is used
[1688.28 - 1692.86] for conventional or organic farming
[1690.68 - 1695.12] today
[1692.86 - 1699.20] organic farming
[1695.12 - 1701.48] unless that organic farm
[1699.20 - 1703.64] was in a forest
[1701.48 - 1706.28] not in a forest it was a forest first
[1703.64 - 1708.50] the forest was cut down
[1706.28 - 1711.20] and then the organic farm was created
[1708.50 - 1713.30] out of that Forest
[1711.20 - 1715.16] that's the only time it's possible
[1713.30 - 1718.16] there's no DDT
[1715.16 - 1720.62] in heavy amounts in the ground but there
[1718.16 - 1723.62] still will be DDT in the ground
[1720.62 - 1726.62] that's how much DDT was sprayed around
[1723.62 - 1729.76] this planet still around this planet and
[1726.62 - 1729.76] used to be sprayed here
[1730.28 - 1734.42] that's true whether the Farmland is used
[1732.56 - 1737.42] for conventional or organic farming
[1734.42 - 1740.42] today most organic farm land was
[1737.42 - 1744.86] converted to organic from conventional
[1740.42 - 1748.48] farming almost all organic Farmland was
[1744.86 - 1748.48] conventional Farms
[1751.16 - 1754.34] this in an interesting way I just got to
[1753.02 - 1756.08] be honest with you guys it's kind of
[1754.34 - 1757.04] funny where and I was like all right I
[1756.08 - 1759.38] can't wait to tell everybody about
[1757.04 - 1762.68] pesticides herbicides and and neuro
[1759.38 - 1764.48] antagonists and right and and I was
[1762.68 - 1765.92] telling SOC this morning like a five in
[1764.48 - 1768.26] the morning when I woke up I was telling
[1765.92 - 1771.68] SSC like I can't wait to tell everybody
[1768.26 - 1774.74] about this stuff but it's so boring it's
[1771.68 - 1776.66] so boring chemicals and pesticides and
[1774.74 - 1778.70] herbicides this is boring crap it's like
[1776.66 - 1780.86] and I said to associ this morning said
[1778.70 - 1783.26] how do I make it interesting and and
[1780.86 - 1784.88] what do I do like do I do a dance when
[1783.26 - 1786.92] I'm actually saying this dude this stuff
[1784.88 - 1788.90] is boring right it's like chemical spray
[1786.92 - 1789.68] mosquito spray
[1788.90 - 1794.20] foreign
[1789.68 - 1794.20] but still it's like my favorite topic
[1794.24 - 1797.36] um
[1794.96 - 1798.98] by lupier says Balu Piper says been
[1797.36 - 1802.04] following medical meeting protocol four
[1798.98 - 1804.68] years Advanced heavy metal detox
[1802.04 - 1805.64] smoothie
[1804.68 - 1809.06] um
[1805.64 - 1811.52] the 20-day challenge has
[1809.06 - 1814.58] rocketed my healing thank you medical
[1811.52 - 1818.32] medium these daily teachings gives us as
[1814.58 - 1818.32] much as the books incredible
[1820.40 - 1826.10] The Organic certification
[1823.10 - 1826.10] rules
[1827.02 - 1831.44] usually state that in the range of five
[1829.82 - 1833.48] to seven to ten years without
[1831.44 - 1836.98] conventional spray land can be deemed
[1833.48 - 1836.98] suitable for organic farming
[1837.86 - 1842.00] but those herbicides last a lot longer
[1840.26 - 1845.50] than that they're in the dirt
[1842.00 - 1849.56] DDT lives many years past this in soil
[1845.50 - 1851.42] DDT has a half-life of a good 100 to 200
[1849.56 - 1854.30] years
[1851.42 - 1857.06] 100 to 200 years
[1854.30 - 1858.62] all right well
[1857.06 - 1860.30] son
[1858.62 - 1862.58] daughter
[1860.30 - 1865.64] you'll be able to farm that land over
[1862.58 - 1867.76] there ddt-free
[1865.64 - 1869.78] but you're gonna have to tell your
[1867.76 - 1871.34] grandchildren that they're going to be
[1869.78 - 1874.10] able to farm it too
[1871.34 - 1876.62] and their children and then maybe it
[1874.10 - 1879.44] will be DDT reduced
[1876.62 - 1883.42] Gotta Wait 200 years Linda Larkin said
[1879.44 - 1883.42] this is disappointing not really alive
[1884.36 - 1889.34] really this is alive
[1887.48 - 1891.14] I'm live right now
[1889.34 - 1894.80] I'm talking about all the different
[1891.14 - 1896.96] chemical fertilizers and sprays and DBT
[1894.80 - 1900.16] and I just read your comment right now
[1896.96 - 1900.16] that we're live
[1901.10 - 1904.10] sorry
[1904.94 - 1909.92] I know it's no fun but exposure to this
[1907.88 - 1912.92] stuff is important to know because you
[1909.92 - 1914.18] can avoid it you really can avoid a lot
[1912.92 - 1916.04] of it
[1914.18 - 1919.22] it's pretty incredible how much you can
[1916.04 - 1922.94] avoid when you have this knowledge
[1919.22 - 1924.80] and that's just crops animals whether
[1922.94 - 1926.96] raised conventionally or organically
[1924.80 - 1929.60] grazing fields that were once Fields
[1926.96 - 1931.58] conventionally sprayed with DDT DDT
[1929.60 - 1933.02] still in our bodies we still eat
[1931.58 - 1935.84] conventional
[1933.02 - 1938.66] conventional animals we still eat
[1935.84 - 1939.68] organically grown animals pasture free
[1938.66 - 1943.54] range
[1939.68 - 1946.04] that people are eating still DVT in them
[1943.54 - 1947.78] unregulated fungicide exposure let's hit
[1946.04 - 1951.04] this this is actually pretty interesting
[1947.78 - 1955.04] right here right here this is pretty
[1951.04 - 1955.04] interesting okay
[1955.30 - 1958.66] this one is
[1959.18 - 1964.04] that's not mine right
[1960.92 - 1966.80] did not have my celery juice
[1964.04 - 1969.64] I was really busy this morning
[1966.80 - 1969.64] just need to sit
[1972.80 - 1978.62] fungicides are recent sorry fungicides
[1976.22 - 1982.10] are secretly everywhere too
[1978.62 - 1984.38] fungicides I hate fungicides coating
[1982.10 - 1986.78] more and more items you buy encounter in
[1984.38 - 1989.30] daily life if you buy something out
[1986.78 - 1991.82] there in the world and and it comes in
[1989.30 - 1993.80] the mail or you go to a store sometimes
[1991.82 - 1995.72] you'll smell a fungicide you won't be
[1993.80 - 1998.06] familiar with it if you're sprayed with
[1995.72 - 2000.40] cologne and perfume and you have
[1998.06 - 2002.68] plug-ins in the walls of air fresheners
[2000.40 - 2004.00] and you use spray air fresheners on your
[2002.68 - 2006.04] furniture you probably won't even smell
[2004.00 - 2008.20] the fungicide because because your house
[2006.04 - 2011.62] is one big smell right
[2008.20 - 2014.08] but it's on stuff that we get and you
[2011.62 - 2015.52] can smell it many times it's on a lot of
[2014.08 - 2019.02] things
[2015.52 - 2019.02] there's no warning
[2019.18 - 2023.38] it's on items you buy and encounter in
[2021.22 - 2025.18] daily life no one's told
[2023.38 - 2028.24] this
[2025.18 - 2031.60] was sprayed with fungicide no not my
[2028.24 - 2032.80] book but this no one was told
[2031.60 - 2033.88] by the way I'm reading out of brain
[2032.80 - 2036.58] saver that's why I'm showing you the
[2033.88 - 2038.92] book right now I'm on page
[2036.58 - 2041.08] 225
[2038.92 - 2044.02] foreign
[2041.08 - 2045.52] but you can stop using a lot of
[2044.02 - 2047.80] fungicide
[2045.52 - 2050.02] use out there you can like halt a lot of
[2047.80 - 2051.46] it when you let companies know when you
[2050.02 - 2053.74] order clothes and you say what's sprayed
[2051.46 - 2058.06] on here why does it smell
[2053.74 - 2060.34] you know and you can actually train
[2058.06 - 2062.20] production of you know clothing the
[2060.34 - 2063.16] companies and stuff like that to be more
[2062.20 - 2066.22] careful
[2063.16 - 2067.96] to be aware of it
[2066.22 - 2069.88] no one's told this was sprayed with a
[2067.96 - 2072.16] fungicide there's no warning on the
[2069.88 - 2074.26] package no tag on clothing no
[2072.16 - 2076.90] forewarning clothing
[2074.26 - 2080.80] is one of the most fungicide sprayed
[2076.90 - 2082.12] items we have in our lives
[2080.80 - 2084.58] they don't
[2082.12 - 2086.08] put a tag on all the new clothing you
[2084.58 - 2088.06] purchase from whatever company or
[2086.08 - 2091.06] fashion company or just regular company
[2088.06 - 2093.82] whatever it is
[2091.06 - 2095.92] there should be a tag saying was sprayed
[2093.82 - 2099.16] with fungicide
[2095.92 - 2102.76] stick in the laundry right away do not
[2099.16 - 2107.62] try on unless it's washed
[2102.76 - 2110.32] if you tried on these jeans
[2107.62 - 2112.96] before they were washed you have to go
[2110.32 - 2114.70] shower like they don't put any of that
[2112.96 - 2116.08] on there there should be a tag saying
[2114.70 - 2118.72] all this
[2116.08 - 2120.28] Health queen says I was so allergic to a
[2118.72 - 2122.08] new couch but thought it was my
[2120.28 - 2124.00] imagination fungicides are really
[2122.08 - 2125.86] sprayed on new couches new chairs all
[2124.00 - 2127.96] the time
[2125.86 - 2130.66] there's no warning on a package no tag
[2127.96 - 2133.36] on clothing no forewarning it is a
[2130.66 - 2135.72] secret campaign what
[2133.36 - 2135.72] what
[2139.18 - 2144.28] it's a secret campaign that no one
[2142.18 - 2146.32] speaks about
[2144.28 - 2149.50] hmm
[2146.32 - 2151.42] no one knows about other than big
[2149.50 - 2153.58] fungicide companies in manufacturing
[2151.42 - 2155.74] it's a campaign
[2153.58 - 2158.08] from the fungicide companies in
[2155.74 - 2161.32] manufacturing companies
[2158.08 - 2164.62] it's actually a secret
[2161.32 - 2167.98] it is sprayed on everything they sell
[2164.62 - 2171.64] the fungicide to clothing manufacturers
[2167.98 - 2174.94] it's sprayed on everything there isn't a
[2171.64 - 2178.56] tag or a forewarning which should be on
[2174.94 - 2178.56] every single thing you buy
[2181.36 - 2186.22] and there is some clothing that doesn't
[2183.22 - 2188.56] have it and it's a miracle but it's
[2186.22 - 2191.02] getting less and less like that
[2188.56 - 2194.50] there is some clothing that doesn't
[2191.02 - 2197.74] that's not sprayed with fungicide
[2194.50 - 2200.14] it actually exists out there still I try
[2197.74 - 2201.82] to choose those Brands where I'm
[2200.14 - 2203.50] familiar with them so I choose the
[2201.82 - 2206.02] brands that are not sprayed with
[2203.50 - 2207.34] fungicide when I get used to them and
[2206.02 - 2209.14] I'm like you know what this didn't come
[2207.34 - 2210.52] with a fungicide smell it's not making
[2209.14 - 2212.62] you sick when I breathe it in because
[2210.52 - 2214.84] it's really intense
[2212.62 - 2216.40] some stuff can come and it's like whoa
[2214.84 - 2219.04] It's got to go in the laundry right away
[2216.40 - 2221.38] right the point is is that when I find
[2219.04 - 2223.06] clothing that I don't smell any
[2221.38 - 2226.00] fungicide on
[2223.06 - 2227.56] then that's the stuff I stick with
[2226.00 - 2229.42] those are the brands I stick with that's
[2227.56 - 2231.84] usually what happens like in my personal
[2229.42 - 2231.84] life
[2237.22 - 2241.06] yeah but usually I still have to wash
[2239.86 - 2244.00] everything
[2241.06 - 2247.38] when it comes because stuff will have
[2244.00 - 2247.38] all kinds of stuff on it right
[2247.54 - 2252.00] okay so let's go into this a little bit
[2249.76 - 2252.00] more
[2254.50 - 2259.06] what happens is this any corporation
[2257.02 - 2262.12] that manufactures a product is sought
[2259.06 - 2264.46] out by suppliers
[2262.12 - 2266.38] chemical companies will send sales reps
[2264.46 - 2268.42] to meet with manufacturing companies and
[2266.38 - 2270.10] sell them on the fungicide chemicals
[2268.42 - 2272.62] that they want the corporation to spray
[2270.10 - 2276.22] on everything they manufacture
[2272.62 - 2278.44] Boom the manufacturers then take the
[2276.22 - 2279.88] fungicides put them in spray Jets and
[2278.44 - 2281.74] spray them
[2279.88 - 2283.90] spray these dangerous fungicide
[2281.74 - 2285.46] chemicals on every single item and
[2283.90 - 2289.84] package
[2285.46 - 2291.58] no one's monitoring this
[2289.84 - 2296.40] there's no federal law
[2291.58 - 2296.40] this is total Rogue contamination
[2296.92 - 2301.48] this information is just insane
[2299.56 - 2303.70] thrift store clothes are saturated with
[2301.48 - 2304.90] perfumes colognes and air fresheners big
[2303.70 - 2307.90] time because I know people say well go
[2304.90 - 2311.28] to a thrift store man sometimes this
[2307.90 - 2314.52] stuff is just saturated mold
[2311.28 - 2317.80] fungicide air fresheners
[2314.52 - 2319.06] perfumes colognes right gotta look out
[2317.80 - 2320.44] that way too
[2319.06 - 2322.06] but if you don't mind any of that
[2320.44 - 2323.98] whatever then
[2322.06 - 2326.16] that's okay if you don't mind any of
[2323.98 - 2326.16] that
[2326.74 - 2330.58] no one's monitoring this there's no
[2328.54 - 2332.68] federal law this is total Road
[2330.58 - 2334.84] contamination when you handle items
[2332.68 - 2338.26] sprayed with fungicides
[2334.84 - 2341.08] nowhere does it say patent number one
[2338.26 - 2344.02] seven three two two eight four dot dot
[2341.08 - 2346.36] dot applied
[2344.02 - 2350.32] nowhere does it show a skull and
[2346.36 - 2353.56] crossbones nowhere does it warn immune
[2350.32 - 2353.56] system diminisher
[2355.78 - 2362.10] with a list of side effects nope and yet
[2359.20 - 2364.18] fungicides are in every country
[2362.10 - 2367.36] manufacturing plants throughout the
[2364.18 - 2369.28] world are sold this fungicide you're not
[2367.36 - 2371.44] allowed to be informed of any of this
[2369.28 - 2374.20] I'm informing you of something you're
[2371.44 - 2376.96] not allowed to be informed with
[2374.20 - 2378.82] Sarah Nichols when I worked in fashion
[2376.96 - 2380.98] development I got so sick and would open
[2378.82 - 2383.50] boxes and boxes of our samples from
[2380.98 - 2386.86] other countries I would get so sick and
[2383.50 - 2389.02] my throat always hurt Sarah
[2386.86 - 2390.64] you're validated
[2389.02 - 2392.32] totally
[2390.64 - 2394.54] I always worry about people in the
[2392.32 - 2396.22] fashion industry I worry about people
[2394.54 - 2397.84] that handle all the clothes in the
[2396.22 - 2400.54] fashion industry
[2397.84 - 2402.22] it's like a life shortener I'd be real
[2400.54 - 2405.04] Brave to work in the fashion industry
[2402.22 - 2407.56] real Brave
[2405.04 - 2410.08] okay fungicides are sprayed on new
[2407.56 - 2411.70] clothing and Manufacturing Goods that's
[2410.08 - 2415.24] what we're just talking about they're
[2411.70 - 2417.94] also applied on crops hospitals are
[2415.24 - 2421.68] really doused in the campaign the
[2417.94 - 2421.68] private campaign of fungicides
[2421.72 - 2427.30] on new used cars and in airplanes and
[2425.20 - 2430.36] even applied on garbage cans garbage
[2427.30 - 2432.46] bags and the exteriors of some water
[2430.36 - 2435.64] bottles
[2432.46 - 2437.38] cardboard boxes packaged Foods including
[2435.64 - 2439.66] organic packaged foods and beverages are
[2437.38 - 2442.26] sprayed with fungicides
[2439.66 - 2445.12] how screwed up is that
[2442.26 - 2447.28] fungicides are on or in couches
[2445.12 - 2450.34] appliances Tech products Lawn Furniture
[2447.28 - 2452.56] beds blankets sheets dog shampoos cat

[2498.94 - 2503.86] basically it's a trillion dollar
[2501.70 - 2506.26] business for chemical companies to
[2503.86 - 2511.18] produce this much fungicide to sell to
[2506.26 - 2514.14] every manufacturer and nobody knows
[2511.18 - 2514.14] about it
[2515.44 - 2520.54] so wacko
[2517.78 - 2523.24] it's unbelievable
[2520.54 - 2525.22] they made it a standard of Industries to
[2523.24 - 2526.90] grandfather and fungicides against any
[2525.22 - 2529.00] ramifications from these dangerous
[2526.90 - 2530.32] chemicals let's make the shot I could
[2529.00 - 2532.48] just read on I mean there's so much
[2530.32 - 2534.52] information in there
[2532.48 - 2536.86] so let's actually
[2534.52 - 2538.78] there's just so much info in there it's
[2536.86 - 2540.64] just packed

[2561.54 - 2566.56] crocheting and my fingers and hands
[2564.22 - 2568.54] started to get eczema and after some
[2566.56 - 2570.94] research I found that the yarn had
[2568.54 - 2572.80] formaldehydes in it so there's there's
[2570.94 - 2577.24] one right there
[2572.80 - 2580.62] that lumus free with celery 333
[2577.24 - 2580.62] pretty amazing

[2590.50 - 2594.76] tightly packed fresh
[2592.48 - 2596.56] parsley
[2594.76 - 2597.76] so quarter cup is not going to be too
[2596.56 - 2601.02] too much
[2597.76 - 2601.02] so let's just get in here
[2602.56 - 2605.10] nice

[2659.92 - 2665.10] I got much larger right there but
[2662.26 - 2665.10] there's one right there
[2671.14 - 2676.48] you'll notice that's coming out dry
[2674.32 - 2678.04] drier than any other machine that I've
[2676.48 - 2681.58] used
[2678.04 - 2684.76] but I've tried them all it's incredible
[2681.58 - 2686.56] this is the mm-1500 it's on sale
[2684.76 - 2689.32] 20 off

[2689.32 - 2695.34] that's a large one right there it's
[2691.48 - 2695.34] gonna produce more juice than
[2696.46 - 2701.68] someone was just asking about the juicer
[2698.56 - 2703.72] there's an mm-900 and mm-1500 you got
[2701.68 - 2705.94] the choice the 1500's got a Nutritional
[2703.72 - 2708.22] Center
[2705.94 - 2710.74] but seriously
[2708.22 - 2712.48] food prices are going up up they're
[2710.74 - 2714.52] skyrocketing which is like unbelievable
[2712.48 - 2717.04] I'm talking about all food animal
[2714.52 - 2718.78] products you know beef whatever chicken
[2717.04 - 2721.06] everything's going up dairy products
[2718.78 - 2723.16] fruits vegetables everything is going up
[2721.06 - 2725.20] I endorse these guys you got because
[2723.16 - 2726.94] this saves people money so that's the
[2725.20 - 2728.56] kill right there
[2726.94 - 2730.12] because it's squeezing out a lot of
[2728.56 - 2732.16] juice out of here and the pulp's coming
[2730.12 - 2733.84] out that kind of dry right there and
[2732.16 - 2735.64] it's cold pressed masticating where the
[2733.84 - 2737.44] nutrients are preserved
[2735.64 - 2739.72] I endorse these guys because this
[2737.44 - 2741.58] machine's like incredible
[2739.72 - 2743.26] saving people money and that makes me
[2741.58 - 2745.66] really happy if you can save people
[2743.26 - 2746.80] money when there's like food problems
[2745.66 - 2749.26] out there in the world and everything
[2746.80 - 2751.48] else it's amazing
[2749.26 - 2753.96] it's like
[2751.48 - 2753.96] all right
[2754.06 - 2757.56] two radishes
[2758.68 - 2762.54] our next there's one right here
[2763.74 - 2769.26] rad radish went in there all crunched up
[2766.12 - 2769.26] two radishes
[2769.42 - 2775.32] next one is quarter cup of fresh or
[2772.12 - 2775.32] thawed blackberries
[2778.48 - 2783.10] I got some frozen blackberries right
[2781.12 - 2785.56] here and you want to defrost them and
[2783.10 - 2787.54] I'm telling you guys that because I know
[2785.56 - 2790.00] that some people will they won't they'll
[2787.54 - 2791.80] get frozen but they won't defrost it so
[2790.00 - 2793.36] what happens is it doesn't juice
[2791.80 - 2795.88] anything out of it because it's making
[2793.36 - 2797.14] you're making frozen sorbet so you're
[2795.88 - 2800.28] what you're really doing is making a
[2797.14 - 2800.28] frozen sorbet somehow
[2800.32 - 2805.72] and in this situation
[2803.02 - 2807.46] you want to make sure you defrost those
[2805.72 - 2809.26] frozen fruits when you're using them in
[2807.46 - 2812.02] these brain shot Therapies
[2809.26 - 2815.64] one to two
[2812.02 - 2815.64] stalks of celery
[2825.64 - 2829.24] right there
[2828.04 - 2832.48] yep
[2829.24 - 2835.62] yep yep yep yep
[2832.48 - 2835.62] I'm gonna put one here too
[2835.66 - 2839.08] I just had to get a celery stick out of
[2837.52 - 2842.58] the fridge you guys
[2839.08 - 2842.58] have to one orange peel
[2843.94 - 2849.66] okay I'm gonna peel it real quick
[2847.00 - 2849.66] there we go
[2850.66 - 2856.54] now what's your notice about this juicer
[2854.14 - 2858.52] is it's quiet and Juice in the morning
[2856.54 - 2860.80] you won't wake up your family if you're
[2858.52 - 2864.24] somebody that's worried about that
[2860.80 - 2864.24] it's a quiet juicer
[2864.52 - 2868.78] the spinning basket juicers and all the
[2866.56 - 2870.22] other juicers all they do is throw away
[2868.78 - 2872.56] a lot of produce
[2870.22 - 2874.06] you've got to have a pretty deep wallet
[2872.56 - 2876.34] to keep up with juicing with those
[2874.06 - 2878.08] machines
[2876.34 - 2880.26] this one right here is about saving
[2878.08 - 2880.26] money
[2883.00 - 2887.80] crispy perspective says love the juicer
[2885.52 - 2890.38] explanation points figuring it all out
[2887.80 - 2892.54] yesterday fumbling time was minimal
[2890.38 - 2895.66] totally worth the upgrade from spinning
[2892.54 - 2899.94] basket crispy perspective
[2895.66 - 2899.94] totally worth it because
[2900.64 - 2904.96] the amount of produce you have to run
[2902.56 - 2908.26] through those other machines is insane
[2904.96 - 2911.56] like you need access to like co-ops and
[2908.26 - 2913.90] like food co-ops and and produce back
[2911.56 - 2915.58] alleys where the produce managers were
[2913.90 - 2916.60] giving you lots of produce for free or
[2915.58 - 2918.88] something you know what I mean that's
[2916.60 - 2920.44] spoiled or something you need access to
[2918.88 - 2922.36] a lot of produce with those machines if
[2920.44 - 2925.84] you're going to juice all the time
[2922.36 - 2927.46] and this right here is squeezing out so
[2925.84 - 2930.70] much juice
[2927.46 - 2932.20] 20 off and it's not like it's more
[2930.70 - 2934.12] expensive than anything it's not that's
[2932.20 - 2935.56] what's incredible two you know people
[2934.12 - 2938.20] are like oh well then what does it cost
[2935.56 - 2940.36] well that's the amazing part it's
[2938.20 - 2942.82] affordable for a lot of people but I see
[2940.36 - 2945.30] people say it's too expensive
[2942.82 - 2945.30] right
[2945.70 - 2950.08] and
[2947.86 - 2951.16] they're but they want a juicer and
[2950.08 - 2952.90] they're worrying about worrying about
[2951.16 - 2953.92] food and they're worrying about a juicer
[2952.90 - 2955.66] that's too expensive they don't
[2953.92 - 2957.64] understand that first of all it's 20 off
[2955.66 - 2961.80] it's on sale right now second of all
[2957.64 - 2961.80] it's saving people so much money
[2962.08 - 2966.16] they think it's too A lot of people
[2964.12 - 2967.78] think it's too expensive to make juice
[2966.16 - 2970.12] they're worried about it being too
[2967.78 - 2972.34] expensive to actually make it and what
[2970.12 - 2974.62] they don't realize is that with this
[2972.34 - 2976.00] juicer you're saving money and that's
[2974.62 - 2979.02] the incredible part right there you're
[2976.00 - 2979.02] actually saving money
[2982.36 - 2985.36] and you can give it a little time and
[2983.86 - 2986.62] let it go down
[2985.36 - 2988.84] so
[2986.62 - 2990.04] I'm going to kind of just massage this a
[2988.84 - 2991.96] little bit and get
[2990.04 - 2993.46] this comes with a nice screen on top
[2991.96 - 2995.38] which I love and you can just actually
[2993.46 - 2997.60] push all the juice through it's
[2995.38 - 2999.52] incredible when you really get down to
[2997.60 - 3001.62] it the amount of juice you can juice
[2999.52 - 3004.38] with very little
[3001.62 - 3007.20] it's it's really insane
[3004.38 - 3009.48] berries are a different consistency
[3007.20 - 3010.92] oranges are a different consistency but
[3009.48 - 3012.48] if you give it a little time it all ends
[3010.92 - 3013.98] up going down there and it's it's
[3012.48 - 3016.14] squeezing here's what people don't
[3013.98 - 3018.48] realize
[3016.14 - 3020.16] it's not about like people are like oh
[3018.48 - 3022.20] just make a juice really quick and then
[3020.16 - 3024.42] they run all this produce to make this
[3022.20 - 3026.04] much juice all this produce through this
[3024.42 - 3028.16] thing is squeezing it's got high
[3026.04 - 3031.02] compression it's squeezing out the juice
[3028.16 - 3032.46] and that is where the money's at because
[3031.02 - 3034.44] when you go to the store you have to buy
[3032.46 - 3036.06] this much more this much more of
[3034.44 - 3038.40] everything in this situation you're
[3036.06 - 3040.44] buying less and it's a cold pressed slow
[3038.40 - 3043.26] masticating juicer which is incredible
[3040.44 - 3045.90] it's still squeezing out juice
[3043.26 - 3048.18] Gary Pearson says the mm Omega juicers
[3045.90 - 3050.28] paid for themselves and that's what they
[3048.18 - 3051.66] do so anybody if you guys are watching
[3050.28 - 3052.62] this and you're like well what you sure
[3051.66 - 3054.24] because everybody's going to be like if
[3052.62 - 3058.08] I'm going to do the brain shot I need a
[3054.24 - 3059.94] juicer so um so I'm just showing you how
[3058.08 - 3063.66] this works
[3059.94 - 3069.06] and the warranty is 15 years plus
[3063.66 - 3070.74] powertrain 15 years and parts 15 years
[3069.06 - 3072.78] that's unbelievable and there's an mm
[3070.74 - 3076.14] you know call hotline number and all
[3072.78 - 3077.52] that you know and a mega juicers right
[3076.14 - 3079.74] put that there because I'm gonna eat
[3077.52 - 3082.56] that later
[3079.74 - 3085.62] Lila Collins says Omega has superb
[3082.56 - 3088.26] customer service I hear that a lot
[3085.62 - 3090.60] that's incredible
[3088.26 - 3091.62] and then what you have here is the dry
[3090.60 - 3095.46] stuff
[3091.62 - 3098.94] right you don't have a pile of wet
[3095.46 - 3101.04] sloppy pulp from trying to make a big
[3098.94 - 3103.38] basket of juice wet you know the whole
[3101.04 - 3105.54] thing it's it's insane this is like the
[3103.38 - 3108.36] difference right there
[3105.54 - 3110.64] 47 Anderson Jay says this juicer makes
[3108.36 - 3112.92] the best orange juice and makes so much
[3110.64 - 3115.02] out of just a few oranges I know the
[3112.92 - 3117.42] reason why I say no because I love to
[3115.02 - 3120.30] use oranges I juice like everything in
[3117.42 - 3122.12] here I'll juice limes Judith Galley says
[3120.30 - 3125.34] what's the juicer brand it's a mega
[3122.12 - 3128.30] o-m-e-g-a it's a mega now here's the
[3125.34 - 3128.30] thing here right
[3128.34 - 3135.30] so in this juice this is the fungicide
[3131.30 - 3138.60] herbicide pesticide exposure shot
[3135.30 - 3140.28] it calls for a little bit of spirulina
[3138.60 - 3143.16] another incredible product I'm just
[3140.28 - 3147.54] going to say this okay
[3143.16 - 3150.12] this stuff is so incredible but why put
[3147.54 - 3152.36] your words where your mouth is man you
[3150.12 - 3155.94] know what I mean they don't use the
[3152.36 - 3158.16] anti-caking or bonding agents
[3155.94 - 3160.80] it's the only company
[3158.16 - 3163.44] from what I know out there
[3160.80 - 3165.06] right that with the Rishi powder their
[3163.44 - 3166.98] chaga powder the barley grass juice
[3165.06 - 3168.72] powder the spirulina they don't use the
[3166.98 - 3170.52] ant this is crazy you have to know what
[3168.72 - 3174.30] this is
[3170.52 - 3176.76] like just know what this is
[3174.30 - 3178.44] companies have to put an anti-caking
[3176.76 - 3180.36] agent that's what they all put in they
[3178.44 - 3182.22] just choose to do it and they don't
[3180.36 - 3184.08] disclose what it is
[3182.22 - 3185.28] people got their green powders and they
[3184.08 - 3187.26] don't realize it
[3185.28 - 3189.54] their powder has an anti-caking agent
[3187.26 - 3191.34] that's not on the list on on the bottle
[3189.54 - 3192.90] people have their green powders they got
[3191.34 - 3195.00] their mushroom powders they got all
[3192.90 - 3197.34] their different powders out there
[3195.00 - 3199.68] and they don't realize it there's
[3197.34 - 3201.24] anti-caking and anti-bonding agents in
