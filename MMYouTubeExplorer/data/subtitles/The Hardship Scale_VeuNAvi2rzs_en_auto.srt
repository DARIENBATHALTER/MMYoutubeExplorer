1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,020
this is important please if you guys

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,899
have a second to listen to this we Soul

3
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:09,720
search because of life's hardships the

4
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:12,000
hardship scale I've seen people go

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:14,580
through atrocities and I had

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,619
unbelievable hardships where if they

7
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,199
tell someone you don't have words you

8
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:21,020
can't fathom what that's like and those

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,340
hardships take them to a place of

10
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:27,480
soul-searching and then you have people

11
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:29,160
where they had hardships too but the

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,260
scale is so different for everyone

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,360
there's different levels of hardships

14
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:36,420
but it depends on which world you live

15
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:39,480
in you can be someone who's silver spoon

16
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,520
fed great support system not a care in

17
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,940
the world no financial problems

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,399
whatsoever a family giving you support

19
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:48,180
you go off to private schools

20
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,399
everybody's worried about you everybody

21
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,899
is taking care of you you don't have to

22
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,640
worry about anything and you can still

23
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:57,059
have a hardship still have a hardship

24
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,039
and still get affected like the scale is

25
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:01,920
different for everyone and then you can

26
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,680
be someone that comes from nothing and

27
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:08,460
got hit by a train or a bus but you are

28
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,260
not weak you are not weak regardless and

29
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,180
you're not weak just because you're

30
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,580
chronically sick you're still not weak

31
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:17,400
strongest people I've ever seen and let

32
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:19,500
me go into this part you know how strong

33
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,479
people who have chronic illness really

34
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:25,560
are people who have been sick for years

35
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:27,360
they're strong I can guarantee you that

36
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,000
if you take someone who's an athlete

37
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,759
maybe a professional athlete in football

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,740
or basketball or professional swimmer or

39
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,439
something and they get chronic illness

40
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:39,420
screaming like a baby screaming and

41
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,040
screaming like a baby can't handle it

42
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,540

43
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,220
for more than two months there's people

44
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,259
out there who are chronically sick for

45
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,759
five six years bent every doctor been to

46
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:50,220
everything they've been through hell and

47
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,259
back but they're strong really strong

48
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:54,420
they may not seem strong they can't run

49
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:56,399
a marathon but then you take somebody

50
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,380
who's been stronger their whole life

51
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,520
they run marathons and everything and

52
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:04,200
they finally get sick they are screaming

53
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,299
bloody murder because they can't take it

54
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,160
for a minute because it's it's stopping

00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:10,380
them from doing what they want to do and

56
