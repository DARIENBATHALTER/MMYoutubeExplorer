my hand right now it's called soothe

41
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:47,280

00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:51,600
that there's raw organic honey in this

43
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:54,200

things that are in the other ones like

46
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:02,119
because companies won't do this they

47
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:05,000
won't do with them did right here and

48
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:06,719

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,519
right there over anything so when it

62
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:45,400

00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:56,120

this nothing out there

71
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:06,000
touches this right there I'm sure you

72
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:08,040
know competitors are going to be all

73
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,760
jealous and freaking out because of this

74
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,120
product and they're going to try to

75
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,920
create something and say oh yeah ours is

76
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,280
good too you know that's going to happen

77
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:19,319
but it's never going to touch this and

78
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,440
what what happens with vimer G's they're

79
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:28,040
so revolutionary with what they do it's

80
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:30,439
insane I mean seriously but this is an

81
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,599
entirely different

82
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:35,280
Elderberry than what's out there in the

83
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:38,640
world right now and that's what we need

84
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,400
it's things like this that change the

85
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:44,599
world of Health it's stuff like this

86
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:47,200
that changes the world of Health okay is

87
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:49,439
when it comes down to immune system you

88
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,200
need every Fighting Chance if somebody

89
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:54,200
has a symptom out there okay somebody

90
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,200
has a symptom anybody that you know

91
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,640
comes to me old friend or something

92
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:01,200
they're like I got the symptom and I'm

93
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:03,599
like ooh so sorry about your immune

94
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,400
system like what are you talking about

95
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,439
the the the doctor said nothing about my

96
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,480
immune system nobody said anything about

97
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:13,560
my immune system if you have a SI

98
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:17,600
symptom if you have a condition it's an

99
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:19,639
immune system problem already just right

100
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,079
from the start and that's what people

101
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:24,479
don't understand his immune system has

102
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,280
everything to do with your symptoms and

103
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,440
your conditions and what you're

104
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:31,080
struggling with on that level physically

105
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,440
if you break your leg and it doesn't

106
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:36,520
heal as fast as the other guy there's a

107
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,400
good chance there's a reason if you

108
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,560
break your arm it doesn't heal as fast

109
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,320
as the other guy there's a reason even

110
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,919
breaks even bone breaks and things like

111
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:49,080
that immune system assists with that

112
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:52,120
immune system comes to the rescue it's a

113
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:55,600
big part of how we stay healthy and heal

114
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:57,240
faster immune cells so if you're immune

115
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,440
deficient if your immune cells are

116
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:03,080
actually on the lower scale if your bone

117
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:05,440
marrow is not producing like it needs to

118
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:08,560
produce or your immune cells are being

119
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:11,919
eaten up and eaten up because of all the

120
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,560
Predators that enter into our body

121
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:16,440
that's something to know because that's

122
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:19,520
what the bug world is really so the bug

123
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:22,600
world they're Predators that's what the

124
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,840
bug world is they get into the lymphatic

125
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,080
system they get into all kinds of

126
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,960
different areas of the body they enter

127
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,639
in through the mouth they enter in

128
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,160
through the eyes in the ears in the nose

129
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:37,240
they enter in that way through the lungs

130
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,479
we breathe those predators in right they

131
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,759
enter through bodily fluids like sharing

132
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:43,840
bodily fluids or running into a bodily

133
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:47,280
fluid thing with somebody else whatever

134
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:49,240
it is we get these bugs they go in us

135
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,479
some are stealth some are more just

136
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:54,160
flash in the pan aggressive with a big

137
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:56,319
bang that's what bugs are like right but

138
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,160
they Predators is what they are and

139
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:01,400
they're there to actually beat somebody

140
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:04,280
down they want to invade and if they're

141
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,440
stealth viruses stealth bugs and

142
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:09,199
different stealth kind of like pathogens

143
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:12,199
they like to nest and they nest and they

144
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,960
live and they stay in organs because our

145
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:16,199
immune system is

146
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,800
struggling that's how it works because

147
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:19,599
our immune system is struggling people

148
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,199
get the cold sores they get the herpes

149
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:23,759
simplex one they get the herpes simplex

150
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:25,639
right and they get the breakouts

151
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,440
periodically and stuff immune systems

152
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:29,199
always challenged they come out shingles

153
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,599
whether it's non- rashing or some other

154
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,720
form and they're actually struggling or

155
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:34,199
they're dealing with some kind of

156
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,639
fatigue but don't know why and they got

157
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:38,680
the cyto megal virus they got the

158
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:40,919
upsteam bar they got the hhv6 H h37 they

159
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:43,080
have no idea all the different bugs that

160
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:46,160
are out there right some are stealth

161
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,800
some are flash in the pan Big Bang bugs

162
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,400
that's what they are right like bugs

163
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,000
that are going around and everything

164
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,759
like that like the flues and so forth

165
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,080
and all that but we need to feed our

166
00:06:53,759 --> 00:07:00,680
immune cells right they're hungry like

167
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,720
we're hungry so keep that in mind so

168
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,919
here's the thing I want to talk about

169
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:07,160
Hunger for a minute right when we're

170
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:11,680
hungry why are we really hungry what is

171
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:14,639
calling for a hunger okay well our body

172
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:17,240
systems become hungry right our brain

173
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:20,479
becomes hungry our neurons become hungry

174
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:22,840
right our body system becomes hungry

175
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:25,360
it's not just like us it's not just us

176
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:27,840
emotionally or consciously or

177
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,680
subconsciously we're hungry or the fact

178
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,440
that we need fuel right we need fuel for

179
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,120
everyday maintenance and everything

180
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:37,120
there's more than that there's deep

181
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:40,120
seated hunger that rages inside of a lot

182
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,599
of people because that appetite isn't

183
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:45,159
just for our stomach it isn't just for

everything up and just hit a tropical

213
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,040
island for a few years and I could sit

there with with exactly cracking open

215
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,360
coconuts that would be great and maybe I

incredible this product is and what's

245
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:08,079
going on here and what's in my hands

246
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:11,480
right here and the difference there's a

247
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:13,959
difference this is incredible no fillers

248
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:16,120
no garbage no beet sugar you guys you

249
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:18,360
see you see sugar in those Elderberry

250
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:22,160
syrups out there and stuff you see cane

251
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:24,440
sugar yeah how was that cane raised what

252
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,760
what what kind of contaminants that are

253
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,959
in that cane it's not even just that

254
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:31,120
they mix cane with other things sugars

255
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:33,200
aren't just pure sugar anymore so when

256
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,240
they put cane in there's a small tiny

257
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,800
percentage of another type of sugar put

258
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,800
in there and people don't even realize

259
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,760
it so they could put cane sugar on a

260
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:45,839
product but it but cane with something

261
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:48,800
else right VY won't do that it won't go

262
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:52,279
near that this is raw organic honey in

263
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:54,880
this Elderberry Elixir seven times more

264
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:58,200
potent than anything else out there that

265
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:00,279
is insane right there okay so I want

266
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:03,360
everybody to know what's happening okay

267
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:05,880
so when we have problems we have immune

268
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,959
system problems that's what happening

269
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:10,399
and right now there's a massive meltdown

270
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:13,360
on this planet Earth it's immune

271
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:15,279
functions lowering you know they say

272
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,800
things like this now right medical

273
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:21,240
medium information called the shot first

274
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:24,040
that life expectancy is dropping I said

275
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:27,680
this for years I published this before

276
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:29,839
science published their thing okay so

277
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,399
science finally came out with it and

278
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,000
said life expectancy is dropping it's

279
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,399
dropping why is it dropping it's not

280
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,399
supposed to be dropping it's supposed to

281
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:41,040
be advancing it's supposed to be getting

282
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,440
better and better and longer that's how

283
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,440
it's supposed to go but it's dropping

284
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,279
more people eating organic food more

285
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,240
people you know doing what intermittent

286
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,440
fasting more people you know eating

287
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,880
better somewhere I'm not saying

288
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,720
intermittent fasting is a good thing you

289
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:55,320
know about medical me information I'm

290
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,200
just saying more people are trying to

291
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,040
take care of themselves and they're

292
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,399
eating more fruits and vegetables and

293
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,959
all all this other stuff they're staying

294
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,680
away from processed food but this is

295
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:06,320
what's happening though life expectancy

296
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:09,720
is dropping dropping dropping because

297
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:13,600
there's an immune deficiency an immune

298
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:15,240
system problem on planet Earth right now

299
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,480
and that's what's happening and there's

300
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,480
stuff being dumped out of the sky every

301
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,279
single day you guys know about that

302
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,720
right dump stuff being dumped out of the

303
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:26,000
sky everybody's breathing it in it's

304
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:28,120
going on the skin lowers the immune

305
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,360
system that's just one thing all on its

306
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:33,120
own and they're releasing pathogens

307
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,839
right now and they're releasing

308
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,720
pathogens all the time periodically but

309
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:41,639
the pathogen spill is happening and when

310
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,480
they spill pathogens out there they want

311
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:45,639
people to get them and get sick but

312
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:49,240
people don't know how to protect

313
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:52,440
themselves immune system wise that's why

314
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:55,160
I love this being like soothe wise okay

315
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,800
it's smart this is powerful for the

316
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:59,320
immune system and

317
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,199
respiratory respiratory

318
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,920
right there and that's the thing it's

319
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:05,040
okay it's like yeah yeah I picked up an

320
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,680
Elderberry you know syrupy thing I

321
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,320
picked up Elderberry well it's supposed

322
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:11,040
to be good for the immune system

323
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:14,199
supposed to be good for Respiratory um

324
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:17,279
but is it but is it really but when you

325
00:13:14,199 --> 00:13:20,199
go seven times more potent with the

326
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:22,360
highest quality Elderberry unlike other

327
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:23,560
places they can get bottomed here okay

328
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,639
here's what it is you want to start a

329
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,959
supplement company go ahead start a

330
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:28,320
supplement company and what you're going

331
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,519
to do is you're going to buy the lower

332
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,480
tiers they're going to going to say it's

333
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,040
quality but you're going to buy the

334
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,399
lower tier the reason why you're going

335
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:36,800
to buy the lower tier is because of cost

336
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,680
and so forth right that's one thing they

337
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,360
tell you to buy the lower tier and then

338
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,959
you buy the lower tier and you package

339
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,519
it up and you go here's my Elderberry

340
00:13:41,959 --> 00:13:47,160
product and you put it out there right

341
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:50,000
they don't do that they buy the top tier

342
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:52,279
Elderberry the one that people don't buy

343
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,240
so the industries don't buy you know

344
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:56,720
supplement companies don't buy they

345
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,360
actually use that one the one where it's

346
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,399
like no no that's the Premier High

347
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,639
quality and it's just too much it's too

348
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:04,920
much for cost it's you know whatever and

349
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:07,399
then the supplement companies they

350
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:11,040
ignore that one and they buy that bulk

351
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:13,040
bulk crap Elderberry and they put that

352
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,160
into their their syrups right that's how

353
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,320
it works vimergy doesn't do that they

354
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:19,560
get the top tier and that's why I

355
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:21,199
endorse these guys like I do that's why

356
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:24,399
I work with these guys because I don't

357
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:26,600
see that anywhere you guys I've tried

358
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,279
I've tried to make friends with so many

359
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,279
supplement companies throughout the

360
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:32,839
years tried to make friends and then I

361
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:34,880
talk to their CEOs I talk to the owners

362
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:36,720
of their companies right out there and I

363
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,519

Elderberry right their respiratory

416

immune system because immune cells need

to be fed and when you're using an

418

feeding immune cells you got to think

421
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,160
about it that way because that's what's

422
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:57,920
going on you're feeding those immune

423
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:59,800
cells and that's critical and people

424
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,319

425
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:04,039

spleen anymore it blew up it blew up

500
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:09,080
either from something like you know a

501
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:11,799
reaction because it got injured or it

502
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:13,760
blew up because just spontaneously on

503
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:15,360
its own because of a viral infection

504
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,080
they didn't know about because they just

505
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:20,320
don't know nobody knows that that's what

506
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:22,679
swells up those spleens like Epstein bar

507
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:25,039
and all that people walk around with

508
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:27,280
spleen issues immune system problems

509
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:29,159
because of their spleen being really

510
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,039
problematic really inflam

511
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:32,640
that's something all on its own and the

512
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,600
stuff they dump out there and put out

513
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,840
there for people to breathe in and take

514
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,480
in and ingest and everything knocks

515
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,200
things down in the in the body I want to

516
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,960
go into that as well so let me just show

517
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:45,320
you a couple more things and anybody who

518
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:49,000
just got on here I don't own vimergy I

519
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:52,200
want to make that clear okay I just I I

520
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,440
support them I endorse them I work with

521
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,799
them on that because of the products but

522
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:58,679
I don't have any stocks or shares don't

523
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,919
own the company don't have a percentage

524
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:02,440
of it I want to make that clear it's

525
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,919
important to me because I I don't want

526
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:07,760
people to think otherwise it's just a

527
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:10,240
fact I personally trust these guys

528
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,240
because these guys do it right I've

529
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,720
become close friends with these guys

530
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,360
over the years because they don't care

531
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,360
about the out there and they

532
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:20,400
just want to do it right they don't want

533
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:23,440
to play the games that other supplement

534
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,159
companies play I can't tell you the the

535
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,919
doors that I've knocked on the people

536
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:28,640
I've talked to in other supplement

537
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:31,000
Brands supplement Brands you may even

538
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,440
use every day and I talk to the heads of

539
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,400
those companies the owners or the CEOs

540
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,240
and it's the same old crap every time

541
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:40,679
they won't change their standard of crap

542
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:43,159
they won't Elevate they won't take it to

543
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:45,480
the next level and vimergy does that is

544
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:48,120
everything to me right there lupus

545
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:50,679
freeze celery 333 which one supplement

546
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:53,279
should we pack when traveling and what

547
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:55,440
about the radiation does it affect our

548
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:57,960
supplements in the

549
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,240
airplane so another let me talk about

550
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:02,559
airplane radiation for for one which is

551
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:05,279
really important okay unless your

552
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:07,919
supplements are actually opened on the

553
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:09,520
airplane and Spilled Out everywhere if

554
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,240
you took your supplements on the

555
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,480
airplanes this is important and you

556
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:15,520
dumped it all in a glass that was

557
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:18,039
exposed in the open you're going to have

558
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,760
particles radiation particles enter into

559
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:21,600
that supplement of course if that's how

560
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,559
you're doing it where if you take all

561
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,080
your bottles and you expose it all is

562
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:29,279
what I'm saying then you got the

563
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:33,640
particles radiation in the sky most L is

564
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:36,039
Fallout from World War II mostly not

565
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:39,080
it's it's also other things too like

566
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:41,679
what chobble or you know or

567
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:43,279
Fukushima right so Fukushima is a big

568
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:46,559
one right there so a lot of what

569
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:48,400
happened with Fukushima was that when

570
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:53,520
that all blew up when that reactor

571
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:56,159
melted down okay it released so much

572
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:58,960
radiation particles okay into the

573
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:01,279
atmosphere when that thing blew up

574
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,799
that those radiation particles they're

575
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:05,000
floating around everywhere they're in

576
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:08,520
the atmosphere floating around World War

577
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,960
II right heroshima right the big bomb

578
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:12,640
that is still up in our our skies

579
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,279
floating around the atmosphere the upper

580
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:18,320
atmosphere too really like concentrated

581
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:21,559
up there it comes down all the time we

582
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:23,600
get radiation exposure every single day

583
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:25,880
you don't get radiation exposure because

584
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:28,159
the sun technically is giving you

585
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,960
radiation exposure because you'll hear

586
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,240
that that right there is just something

587
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,559
that's really interesting too that I

588
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,799
hear all the time it's like oh the sun's

589
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:37,240
giving you radiation exposure it's like

590
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:40,679
really what it is is when you're laying

591
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:42,159
out in the sun and your clothes are off

592
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:44,080
because you're wearing you know your

593
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,760
swim trunks or your your bikini or

594
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:49,120
something your swimsuit when you're

595
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:51,520
doing that it's exposure from particles

596
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:54,760
it's particles landing on us every

597
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:57,960
single day radiation exposure we get

598
00:23:54,760 --> 00:24:00,919
every single day that's how it works

599
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:03,159
because of of Chernobyl and Fukushima

600
00:24:00,919 --> 00:24:06,600
and the big bomb and then nuclear

601
00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:09,320
experiments nuclear nuclear testing in

602
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:12,480
the middle of the country on fed lands

603
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:14,520
right because did you know that there's

604
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,240
this many people in the just in the us

605
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:20,559
alone right compared to the vast amount

606
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:23,400
of land in the US that's uninhabited is

607
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:25,919
that insane they're like oh no there's

608
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,720
too much too many people population is

609
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:30,159
out of control there's way too many

610
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:32,399
people on the plane really yeah yeah 8

611
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:34,279
billion is way too many pushing on 9

612
00:24:32,399 --> 00:24:36,039
billion going to be way too many we

613
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:38,880
population's out of control it's taking

614
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:41,640
up too much space really because this

615
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:44,440
much of the US is just taken up that

616
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:46,840
much small tiny little pockets right the

617
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:48,799
rest of it is tons and tons and tons and

618
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:50,840
tons and thousands and thousands and

619
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:53,039
thousands hundred thousands of Acres

620
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:54,880
that are not being used that are owned

621
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:58,120
right by the gov or owned by like the

622
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,880
feds or they're like they're owned by by

623
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,679
right

624
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,600
the Industries or they're owned by

625
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:05,399
something and they're all just out there

626
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:08,520
not nothing happening and that's where

627
00:25:05,399 --> 00:25:10,520
you got all the area 51 crap going on

628
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:13,240
that's where all the chemtrail planes

629
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:15,799
are landing they're landing on strips no

630
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:18,480
one sees right you don't see the

631
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:22,120
chemtrail planes landing at the

632
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:25,120
airport at JFK You Don't See You Don't

633
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:27,760
See LAX you don't see airplanes coming

634
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:29,520
in all day long in LAX and they're all

635
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:32,080
the you know chemtrail planes you don't

636
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,880
see that and Only One Pilot gets out no

637
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,080
passengers get out you don't see that

638
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:38,440
where do they go they land in the middle

639
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,120
of the US they land in places nobody

640
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:42,120
sees that all that land that's

641
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:45,039
uninhabited all that that's how it's

642
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:48,240
done that's how it works very few people

643
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:50,080
are really in this country compared to

644
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,039
how much space and land there is which

645
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,440
is a whole another talk a whole another

646
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:55,679
whole another thing that I want to get

647
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:59,120
into sometime because it's interesting

648
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:00,640
as heck how it works and and so let's go

649
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,600
back to radiation a little bit so

650
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,960
radiation exposure in the planes is

651
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:09,000
mostly not all of it but mostly from

652
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:11,480
particle exposure and that particle

653
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,799
exposure is because of the the radiation

654
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:15,080
the atmosphere that's floating around

655
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:18,480
from Fukushima so forth from the bomb

656
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:20,600
World War II from from right Chernobyl

657
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,679
from experiments that are happening in

658
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:26,880
the in in places people are not living

659
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:28,520
and so forth out there right on on land

660
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,080
out there that's being tested sitting

661
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:34,080
there testing all kinds of different

662
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:36,480
things so that's where that exposure

663
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,880
comes from okay so you don't have to

664
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,799
worry about supplementation on that

665
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,080
level or anything like that and when it

666
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:44,760
comes down to like things you know um

667
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:46,600
let's see J over there on YouTube what

668
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:50,039
about airport scanners good question

669
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:51,520
there like first of all like I I get the

670
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:53,720
pat Downs just letting you know that's

671
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,440
one thing right I'll get a pat down so

672
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:57,279
when I go through the airport that's

673
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:00,600
what I do all right remember this one

674
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:03,399
time I was waiting for a pat down for 45

675
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:06,240
minutes okay so was standing there in my

676
00:27:03,399 --> 00:27:08,480
socks and in those 45 minutes every now

677
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,000
and then someone be like Aw what are you

678
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,640
doing there they'd be going through the

679
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,720
scanner they'd be getting into the

680
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:16,720
scanner and be

681
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:19,120
like they come out of it right and in

682
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,799
those 45 minutes this one time there's

683
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,760
like a family I was like oh my God it's

684
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:24,799
medical medium right and I was standing

685
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:26,559
there in my socks right the whole bit

686
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:28,240
and they're like oh my God oh my God and

687
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:29,799
the other people it happened like over

688
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,840
and over on and off but the point is

689
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:35,200
that I was like and I'd be like hey hey

690
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:37,720
why are you going in the scanner why are

691
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,480
you going into the scanner you know like

692
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,679
are you going in the scanner like yeah

693
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,000
of course we're going in the scanner

694
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:44,799
boop boop boop they go in the scanner

695
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,640
it's like I'm getting a pat down for a

696
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:50,080
reason so I don't go into that scanner

697
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:52,320
but it's just you know I've talked about

698
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,840
that over the years for sure but the

699
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,279
bottom line is what about the scanner

700
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,720
you mean the scanner where you put the

701
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:59,760
luggage in and you got your your 2 oz

702
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,640
supplement and stuff like that and you

703
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:06,279
they go through the luggage that the SC

704
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:09,000
it's worth still taking even with that

705
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:12,720
even with that exposure it's worth

706
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,799
taking so I'll put the 2 O bottles you

707
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,880
know or I'll put my supplements in 2 OZ

708
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:19,360
containers I'll put those in the bag

709
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:22,360
McCaron I'll have it go through that

710
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:24,080
that you know radiation detector scanner

711
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,919
right where they where they take that

712
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,840
the images of your your luggage that I

713
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:30,519
talk about in the books and and I'll do

714
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:32,559
that and I'll be like okay there's

715
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:34,159
definitely going to be a small amount

716
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:36,600
but it's not going to touch what this is

717
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:39,559
going to do for me on my you know on my

718
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:41,640
travels on my trip it's not going to

719
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:43,080
touch what it can do for me it's not

720
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,200
going to touch what the zinc can do for

721
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,600
me it's not going to touch what the

722
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:48,279
golden seal can do for me it's not going

723
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,399
to touch that I'm just letting you know

724

so don't panic there okay so very

725
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:55,960
important to know right there so yeah

726
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:59,039
all right so when traveling these are

727
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:02,279
some of the top supplements I would take

728
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:05,840
with me I'm going to take with me matter

729
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:09,720
of fact okay so one is propolis right

730
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:12,679
there it's a must for me I love it I

731
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:15,519
know what it has the power to do I know

732
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:19,360
how good it is I know the quality of

733
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:23,000
this any propolis that I take that isn't

734
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:26,240
this one I just scream poison that's

735
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,640
what I scream it's like poison you taste

736
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,679
the alcohol I don't care if it says

737
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:34,080
alcohol you taste the alcohol you taste

738
00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:35,880
that garbage you know it's burnt yep

739
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:40,120
burnt you guys know how I showed you

740
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:42,880
that before this propolis is not burnt

741
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:45,840
it is there's nothing like that out

742
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:49,039
there is the propolis pure the coratin

743
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:52,799
in it alone is a reason to actually take

744
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:55,559
it okay the coratin in this alone is

745
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:57,200
good reason to take it I'm just saying

746
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:58,360
I'm not saying go out and take hortin

747
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:03,000
because that's not going to it's not

748
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:06,279
going to help dead coratin in a bottle

749
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,440
in capsules does not help that's I'm

750
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:11,720
going to tell you right now coratin

751
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:15,440
that's alive active coratin that's in

752
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:17,840
the propolis pure makes the difference

753
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:21,760
that is another story right there the

754
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:25,200
active living corsin polyol in the

755
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:28,559
propis pure is another level Next Level

756
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:31,200
so that's right there um

757
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:35,640
I take these daily for my immune system

758
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:38,200
but I take them for also for protection

759
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:41,399
of bugs going around so it's about

760
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:44,679
protection I like that I like feeling

761
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:47,559
that I'm being very smart about stuff

762
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:48,919
which is important so on on the

763
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:52,240
Elderberry I just want to talk about

764
00:30:48,919 --> 00:30:55,240
this one last one last moment

765
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:59,080
here there's nothing out there that's

766
00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:03,279
seven times more potent like this this

767
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:05,720
is game Cher bottom line experience it

768
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:09,919
if you if you can get a chance and get a

769
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:12,559
bottle in your hand it is unbelievable

770
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:13,720
when you taste this and you use it

771
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,360
you're going to be like you could and

772
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:17,320
then if you ever did a taste test thing

773
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,240
like that's what I did I did earlier

774
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:22,200
it's like I got some some of the top

775
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:25,320
leading brands of elderbury top leading

776
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:27,639
Brands okay and I put it side by side

777
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:30,000
and tasted it and it was like oh

778
00:31:27,639 --> 00:31:32,440
couldn't never ever take anything like

779
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,720
that that's the difference right there

780
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:38,240
respiratory important for the

781
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:39,679
respiratory system right there the lungs

782
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,960
very important so I want to talk about

783
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:42,880
the immune system with the lungs and

784
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,080
everything else Mar over there at

785
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,360
YouTube I always travel with propolis

786
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:48,960
and I am happy I drank it directly from

787
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:52,960
the bottle I drink it directly from the

788
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:55,960
bottle I do when I came to LA in June

789
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:58,799
this propus helped me so good I did not

790
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:02,559
pick anything up from the airport and I

791
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:05,440
usually do okay okay so that's what I do

792
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:07,559
too I don't use the dropper I take the

793
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,960
dropper off put a little of whatever the

794
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:12,320
dropper in my mouth like that and I

795
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:14,760
actually just do that I take a a little

796
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:17,200
Swig off the propolis bottle that's how

797
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:20,360
I take it doesn't mean you you should do

798
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:23,399
that but that's what I do

799
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:26,519
um say suus aw can you please show us

800
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:28,360
the continuity test again I love the

801
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:29,960
continuity test I love it

802
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:32,519
love it so okay there's a couple of

803
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:35,279
different continuity tests that so has

804
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:38,080
taught me throughout the years okay so I

805
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:42,720
have what I do is is I hold it in my

806
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:47,440
hand okay and and

807
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:49,200
then okay I touch my head and you that's

808
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:52,039
just one right but this is one I've been

809
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,039
doing a lot and I might have shown you

810
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:56,440
this one before right you guys but you

811
00:32:54,039 --> 00:33:00,200
hold it in your hand and you touch your

812
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:02,159
head okay that's what you do and when

813
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:04,360
you get a chance to do that that's

814
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:07,000
that's that's a continuity test that I

815
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:08,600
do and you can feel the difference if

816
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,679
you take another

817
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:12,600
Elderberry right product that's out

818
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:15,120
there and you do that you'll see the

819
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:19,880
difference okay from something that's

820
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:24,000
pure and not congested with bad alcohols

821
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:27,240
bad cane sugars okay bad water because

822
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,399
that's what they do they mix bad water

823
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:31,760
with into the Elderberry syrups that's

824
00:33:29,399 --> 00:33:34,799
what they do they mix bad water in this

825
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:36,919
Elderberry product there's no water

826
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:39,120
they're not adding water and that's

827
00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:41,440
important to know it's a continuity test

828
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,399
you can put your hand right on your head

829
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,760
and you can feel it what you're feeling

830
00:33:43,399 --> 00:33:47,159
is right you're feeling the energy

831
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,760
you'll feel the difference when you

832
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:51,440
actually hold on to anything that's

833
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:54,679
vimergy so when you do that and you do

834
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:58,559
this you'll feel it it's it's it's a

835
00:33:54,679 --> 00:34:02,200
clear feeling it's not painful it's not

836
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:03,799
congestive it's not like impeded and you

837
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,279
can feel that with other products when

838
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:08,359
you put your hand on top of your head

839
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:11,280
like this okay and you hold the product

840
00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:13,159
you can feel the imped in the product

841
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,399
it's really it's incredible that's just

842
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:18,560
a that was in a nutshell real

843
00:34:15,399 --> 00:34:22,480
quick if we drink our supplements from

844
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:25,159
the bottle does it leave bacteria stepen

845
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:27,000
I never worry about that I don't you can

846
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:29,240
if you're concerned about that do the

847
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,520
dropper that's why the dropper there for

848
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:34,720
all kinds of reasons right but I'm not

849
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:36,760
worried um when I drink it from the

850
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:38,960
bottle I'm not worried about bacteria

851
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:43,079
first of all I'm not worried about

852
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:47,399
bacteria trying to survive in that right

853
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:48,839

854
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:50,839

871
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:36,839
explanate so seeing the comments fly up

872
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:41,240
right now so I'm trying to catch a

873
00:35:36,839 --> 00:35:44,119
couple while I'm talking right here

874
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:46,040
um so listen so there's a couple things

875
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:48,800
you can do with the continuity test okay

876
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:51,880
so I want to I want to run by a couple

877
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:56,160
more you know aspects of it right

878
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:58,599
so Puris pure is active right like like

879
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,319
it's got the six Active polyphenols like

880
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:03,200
the cortin right there's nothing like it

881
00:36:00,319 --> 00:36:07,800
in the propolis world nothing like it

882
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:11,560
okay and that's an energy from like a

883
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:16,240
living be product like this there's an

884
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:19,520
energy in there right continuity test is

885
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:21,720
something that the bottle I just threw

886
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:24,800
that bottle and caught it okay

887
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:28,400
continuity test okay is when you put

888
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:32,640
your hand on your head okay and that

889
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:36,000
continuity the connection from your head

890
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:38,680
to your hand where the bottle is all

891
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,200
right and what you're doing instead of

892
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:42,880
your arm being out instead of your arm

893
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:46,000
and hand being out here okay you're

894
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:48,000
connecting it back right here to the

895
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
neurons to your Consciousness

896
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,839
subconscious to your soul you're

897
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:55,280
connecting it right there you're holding

00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:58,040
the product in your hand like this and

899
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:00,640
that energy is running up your arm it's

900
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:03,000
running up your arm like that and what

901
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:05,960
you're doing is you're making the

902
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:08,079
continuity happen between your head and

903
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:10,000
the product in your hand is what you're

904
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:12,040
doing versus holding the product in your

905
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,640
hand like this okay now you're going to

906
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:16,119
make that continuity happen and you're

907
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:19,079
going to actually off boom and there it

908
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:21,760
is okay and you'll feel it and you'll

909
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:23,960
know you'll know right there when you're

910
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,480
actually holding these what's going on

911
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:27,800
there I'm going to do more in depth on

912
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:30,599
that too we'll do one where it's just on

913
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:35,079
that because there's a lot going on

914
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:37,240
there why do I always get sick when I'm

915
00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:40,440
traveling are you putting stuff in your

916
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:43,319
mouth are you are you doing um are you

917
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:45,079
doing like an alcohol wipe on your hands

918
00:37:43,319 --> 00:37:47,040
when you're traveling are you grabbing

919
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:48,520
all the door knobs are you grabbing you

920
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,880
know all are you hitting all the plane

921
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:54,200
button seats and then you're not you're

922
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,839
not like you can touch anything you want

923
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:58,440
but you just you don't all of a sudden

924
00:37:55,839 --> 00:38:00,599
start eating eating

925
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:02,119
with your hands if you you could touch

926
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:03,920
anything you want you want to touch this

927
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:05,599
door handle you want to touch this you

928
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,880
want to pull this tray down in front of

929
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:10,359
you on the plane if there's a tray does

930
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:12,040
it matter if somebody puked on that tray

931
00:38:10,359 --> 00:38:14,400
you know like a month ago and there's

932
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:16,319
still little remes all over it your

933
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,599
residue you you're using your hands

934
00:38:16,319 --> 00:38:21,240
everywhere right you're touching

935
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:22,960
everything great nothing wrong with that

936
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:24,480
but then all of a sudden your finger's

937
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,160
in your

938
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:29,040
eye you're not thinking maybe you're

939
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:31,119
watching a movie on the

940
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,880
plane yeah you're watching a movie on

941
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:35,079
the plane and your finger's now in your

942
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:38,880
eye your finger's in your ear your

943
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:41,960
finger's in your mouth that's why that

944
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:44,079
is why the big reason probably the

945
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:45,599
number one reason why people actually

946
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:46,800
get things traveling because it's

947
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,079
different when you're in a house and

948
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,400
you're touching everything in your house

949
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:50,760
or your apartment or something it's

950
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,839
different but when you're out there and

951
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:55,480
you're grabbing everything and you're

952
00:38:52,839 --> 00:38:56,680
touching everything it's another story

953
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:58,040
cuz you're putting it in your mouth

954
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:00,480
you're putting it in your your eyes

955
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:03,839
everybody rubs their eyes they rub their

956
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:05,800
eyes um thought garden over there and IG

957
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:08,280

958
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:10,800
traveling this is the big one right here

959
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:13,599

you're in the you're in the airport

993
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:35,720
bathroom right and I talk about this

994
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:37,160
flush the toilet before you do your

995
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:39,920
thing if you're going to do an

996
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:42,880
elimination in that toilet flush the

997
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:44,680

998
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,319

999
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:48,599
do an elimination right here in this

1000
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:51,319
toilet ball right here I'm going to make

1001
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:54,680
sure I get a clean flush going on so I

1002
00:40:51,319 --> 00:40:57,839
might even lift up my leg and and hit

1003
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:59,640
the handle if I don't have a handy on me

1004
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:01,480
right there if I don't have any kind of

1005
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:03,119
Handy wipes on me or anything like that

1006
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,680
or I don't have a paper towel on me or

1007
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:07,280
something like I carry like a paper

1008
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:09,160
towel or something in my shirt pocket so

1009
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,040
I can take the paper towel out and if I

1010
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:13,119
got a flush toil at the airport I'll use

1011
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:15,480
the paper towel like that right I'm not

1012
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:16,960
going to touch the handle on the toilet

1013
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,640
I know there's a lot of toilets now that

1014
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,960
they're just it's automatic it just

1015
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,400
happens right but I'm just saying it's

1016
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,000
okay let's talk about the sink same

1017
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,160
thing with the sink and other things too

1018
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,560
there's a lot of them that aren't

1019
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:29,359
automatic but the point is I'm not going

1020
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:31,520
to just touch the toilet bowl handle and

1021
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:33,640
be like okay all right yeah what's going

1022
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:36,280
on here H let me think here got my

1023
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:37,839
finger in my mouth H thinking hard who I

1024
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:39,680
just give myself like five different

1025
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:41,440
bugs so you got to just be really

1026
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:43,839
careful like rubbing the eyes the whole

1027
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,560
bit you get tired I mean I've traveled

1028
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:47,520
with people and they've touched

1029
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:49,119
everything everything under the sun

1030
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,079
practically that they shouldn't be

1031
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:53,240
touching out there while traveling and

1032
00:41:51,079 --> 00:41:54,839
then I'm watching they're like they're

1033
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:56,640
falling asleep or something you know

1034
00:41:54,839 --> 00:41:58,200
they're whatever like we're we're in a

1035
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,319
waiting room somewhere we're in some

1036
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:02,359
chairs at the airport in the lounge and

1037
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:04,720
they're falling asleep and they're

1038
00:42:02,359 --> 00:42:07,160
rubbing their eyes really hard you know

1039
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:08,800
after they just touched everything I see

1040
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:12,200
this all the time out there it just

1041
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:15,480
happens all right so there are things

1042
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:17,000
you can do to prevent getting sick and

1043
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:19,440
protecting your immune system that's one

1044
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,680
of them and now there's a whole look

1045
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:24,440
there's a whole thought out there that

1046
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:26,800
the more you get exposure to the

1047
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:30,200
stronger you get that's not necessarily

1048
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:32,920
true no it's not it's not how it works

1049
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:35,160
right you you want to if you get exposed

1050
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:36,559
you get exposed if you catch a flu you

1051
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:38,000
catch a flu if you get sick with

1052
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:40,319
something you get sick with something

1053
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,240
yeah and you address it you take care of

1054
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:44,440
it you do the right things for yourself

1055
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:46,800
you keep your immune system strong you

1056
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:48,760
do like you know the shock therapies

1057
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:51,559
whatever it is that you got to do but

1058
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:54,319
keep in mind though like keeping from

1059
00:42:51,559 --> 00:42:56,720
Catching things by having these you know

1060
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:59,079

bottles all in their own there's the 8 O

1080
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:50,040
refill but there's the 4 o bottles so

1081
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:51,920
it's not 1 o bottles so that's another

1082
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:54,480
thing somebody will be like cost-wise

1083
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:58,880
it's like oh yeah I just I just paid

1084
00:43:54,480 --> 00:44:02,240
$112 for a 1 o bottle or $20 for a 1o

1085
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:04,160
bottle and meanwhile 4 o bottles it's

1086
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,280
different it's a whole different story

1087
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:07,800
you know that's what's incredible and

1088
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:10,079
then you got your 8 O bottles that's

1089
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:13,319
your 8 O bottle refill bottles and you

1090
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:15,359
save money with the refill bottles keep

1091
00:44:13,319 --> 00:44:18,880
that in mind you do save money in fact

1092
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:21,200
the B12 refill makes it less expensive

1093
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:24,200
than competitors out there people don't

1094
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:25,480
realize that in the 8 O refill bottle so

1095
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:27,240
I just wanted to show you that right

1096
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:28,760
there all right let's talk about the

1097
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:30,280
immune system a little and I'm going to

1098
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:33,520
cover a few more things right here I'm

1099
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:36,119
also going to make let me make

1100
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:37,599
a right there that's the propolis right

1101
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:40,440
there so I got some propolis in there

1102
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:43,599
let make a little bit of a swig that's

1103
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:45,040
what I call it little bit of a swig here

1104
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:47,280
so I'm going to actually add some

1105
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,559
propolis in there this is what I did

1106
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:52,800
right here I'm going to show you right

1107
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:52,800
now okay there's a golden seal right

1108
00:44:53,240 --> 00:45:01,319
there never ever ever never

1109
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:04,040
underestimate golden seal uh-uh never

1110
00:45:01,319 --> 00:45:06,640
underestimate golden seal there's some

1111
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:10,599
golden seal right there it's not burnt

1112
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:13,400
okay potent but not burnt there's a big

1113
00:45:10,599 --> 00:45:14,680
difference right there just so you know

1114
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:17,760
and what you see out there with all the

1115
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:21,079
tinctures is they're burnt you'll see

1116
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:22,839
the color but yet the potency is here

1117
00:45:21,079 --> 00:45:28,480
which is incredible but they're not

1118
00:45:22,839 --> 00:45:30,559
burnt all right so um I got a 8 O refill

1119
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:34,800
right there of the B12 liquid B12 which

1120
00:45:30,559 --> 00:45:36,920
is incredible so per milliliter it's

1121
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,599
actually less expensive you got the 8 O

1122
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:40,160
than so many of the brands out there

1123
00:45:38,599 --> 00:45:42,119
it's incredible it's a massive bottle

1124
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:44,599
I'm holding in my hand this is an 8 O

1125
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:46,200
bottle I'm holding right here the refill

1126
00:45:44,599 --> 00:45:48,960
bottle which is incredible and saves you

1127
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:52,760
money too so all right that's total

1128
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:55,280
immune this is what I do propolis goes

1129
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:59,359
in there total immune goes in there

1130
00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:02,440
golden seal goes in there okay boom just

1131
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:05,920
pop that in there

1132
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:08,119
okay Dr fun other brands of golden seal

1133
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:11,319
really taste crappy because they're

1134
00:46:08,119 --> 00:46:14,880
burnt and there's additives that are not

1135
00:46:11,319 --> 00:46:18,240
listed in the ingredient list that's why

1136
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:20,880
big difference I'm going to pop little

1137
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:22,319
bit of zinc in here extra zinc it's a

1138
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,520
little touch of zinc in the total immune

1139
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:27,839
but I'm going to put a little bit of

1140
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:30,240
extra zinc over there too so yeah yeah

1141
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:32,400
Victoria rising from the ashes the vimer

1142
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:34,880
golden seal tastes so much better and is

1143
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:37,040
so much lighter colored than the

1144
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:38,960
previous medical medium preferred Brands

1145
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:40,599
before vimergy started making gold seal

1146
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:45,000
I just want to explain that there's a

1147
00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:47,040
reason why the brands that are previous

1148
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:51,280
Brands and the brands out there they

1149
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:53,359
burn it it makes it darker but doesn't

1150
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:56,400
mean it's stronger do you understand

1151
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:58,440
that it okay and it doesn't mean also

1152
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:01,000
that other Brands out there that barely

1153
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:03,640
put any in and it's really light doesn't

1154
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:05,920
mean that's stronger either okay but

1155
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:08,280
there's not and the quality is not there

1156
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:10,880
like the golden seal from vimer it's a

1157
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:14,319
whole another story quality is not there

1158
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:16,119
like that and yeah it does tastes good

1159
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:20,240
and it tastes like golden seal though

1160
00:47:16,119 --> 00:47:22,680
don't let me don't let me um dress that

1161
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:25,760
up too great golden seals tastes God

1162
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:27,359
awful tried them all out there this one

1163
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,040
tastes like golden seal

1164
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:30,559
but it tastes better which is incredible

1165
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,640
so you got the total immune got the

1166
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:35,800
golden seal got the

1167
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:38,240
propolis I got the Elderberry I can put

1168
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:42,720
that in there

1169
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:44,559
too crazy that kind of concentration

1170
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:47,880
seven times more potent on the

1171
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:50,160
Elderberry that is incredible I'm going

1172
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:51,800
to add a little water if you don't mind

1173
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:53,720
little bit of water I got a glass of

1174
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:55,480
water here I'm going to just kind of add

1175
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:58,119
that there

1176
00:47:55,480 --> 00:48:00,839
amazing okay wondering wishing says

1177
00:47:58,119 --> 00:48:04,079
vimergy golden seal shock therapy takes

1178
00:48:00,839 --> 00:48:06,680

there I'm going to take this

1187
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:28,839
down Victoria rising from the ashes the

1188
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:31,119
vmer brand is definitely stronger

1189
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:33,400
definitely I can tell the quality

1190
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:36,520
difference with vimergy it has really

1191
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:38,359
moved the needle with my health it makes

1192
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:42,520
every difference it makes all the

1193
00:48:38,359 --> 00:48:44,720
difference it does you know if there was

1194
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:47,520
a product company out there that would

1195
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:49,760
touch what these guys do I would be

1196
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:51,640
supporting it and endorsing it full

1197
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,760
throttle and I would be sitting here

will be holding it in front of you guys

1203

if I can see how they do it and what

1204
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:12,280
they do and know for a fact that it is

1205
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:15,119

compared to propolis pure that is an

1322
00:54:26,839 --> 00:54:31,640
absolute joke compared to propolis pure

1323
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:35,839
same thing like oil pulling oral health

1324
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:38,359
oil pulling propolis for oral health

1325
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:40,599
that's another level there's another

1326
00:54:38,359 --> 00:54:42,440
level right like the fast food

1327
00:54:40,599 --> 00:54:46,280
restaurants I've said this over and over

1328
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:49,760
again okay all right it's like years ago

1329
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:52,160
I said this right you got McDonald's

1330

flame broils right they took things like

1333
00:54:56,839 --> 00:55:01,880
to another level they flame broiled and

1334
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:05,599
then you got like Arby's they offer more

1335
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:08,160
lettuce on their burgers then you got

1336
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:11,520
then you it keeps on going up right then

1337
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:13,079
you got what you got Taco Bell they're

1338
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:15,000

1339
00:55:13,079 --> 00:55:16,799
now in their rollups then you got and it

1340
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:19,319

whatever it is keeps on going up right

1343
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:25,520
and it goes up it goes up then it goes

1344
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:27,520
up from there then it goes up from there

1345
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:29,319
then it goes up to no processed foods

1346
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:31,839
then it goes up to this level then that

1347
00:55:29,319 --> 00:55:34,200
level next you know no Troublemaker

1348
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:36,599
foods you can keep like the medical me

1349
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:40,520
information and you can go up higher and

1350
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:44,119
higher and higher and higher and you can

1351
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:46,799
get up here is what you can do you can

1352
00:55:44,119 --> 00:55:48,240
start from down here and you can get to

1353
00:55:46,799 --> 00:55:51,480
up

1354
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:54,839
here and that's what's happening when

1355
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:58,680
you actually use the right stuff you're

1356
00:55:54,839 --> 00:56:01,240
going from there to up

1357
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:03,599
here so immune system we'll get into it

1358
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:05,480
a little bit immune cells are

1359
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:09,880
hungry

1360
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:12,039
desperate immune cells can be desperate

1361
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:13,319
okay sometimes there's people they're so

1362
00:56:12,039 --> 00:56:15,400
beaten down they don't feel good they

1363
00:56:13,319 --> 00:56:18,000
have so many symptoms they have that

1364
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:21,839
despera livity they have that like that

1365
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:24,680
feeling in that that that look they have

1366
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:26,720
been through hell right they've been

1367
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:29,119
beaten down and their immune system

1368
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:31,079
shows through like their immune system

1369
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:33,200
is showing through it's showing through

1370
00:56:31,079 --> 00:56:35,319
their skin it's showing through their

1371
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:37,760
eyes it's showing through their tongue

1372
00:56:35,319 --> 00:56:42,000
it's showing right and and their immune

1373
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:43,839
cells are desperate for fuel so they can

1374
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,559
strike a

1375
00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:48,880
balance so they can strike a balance so

1376
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:50,280
what happens with our immune system is

1377
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:53,039
our immune system is trying to

1378
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:55,480
constantly balance out the bad the

1379
00:56:53,039 --> 00:56:57,480
immune system is gobbling down garbage

1380
00:56:55,480 --> 00:57:00,400
and junk

1381
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:03,240
immune cells are gobbling up radiation

1382
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:05,480
particles immune cells eat radiation

1383
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:08,680
particles that's how it works so keep

1384
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:12,000
that in mind if you got a particle of

1385
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:14,559
radiation and it somehow gets into you

1386
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,680
someway somehow your immune cells come

1387
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:19,119
by and they gobble it up that's the

1388
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:21,440
whole point if something goes into your

1389
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:23,680
lung that's toxic and not good like

1390
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:24,920
chemrail stuff is dropping out and

1391
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:26,839
you're and it's in your lung you're

1392
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:29,000
breathing it in you're immune cells in

1393
00:57:26,839 --> 00:57:31,079
your lung are actually trying to gobble

1394
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:33,640
that up before it even gets deep into

1395
00:57:31,079 --> 00:57:35,319
your bloodstream into your brain so you

1396
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:37,839
got immune cells that are like going

1397
00:57:35,319 --> 00:57:40,640
into your lungs at the base of the lungs

1398
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:43,160
right there little

1399
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:44,960
pockets and they're actually all around

1400
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:47,079
there around the lymphatic system and so

1401
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:49,480
forth all around the lungs and they're

1402
00:57:47,079 --> 00:57:51,960
there to gobble up any kind of radiation

1403
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:53,760
particles and so forth chemtrail

1404
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:56,559
particles coming down your immune cells

1405
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:59,920
are trying to gobble up all of that that

1406
00:57:56,559 --> 00:58:02,039
gets into your lungs right there okay

1407
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:05,079
the flu goes down into your lungs you

1408
00:58:02,039 --> 00:58:07,160
breathe it in boom that's right your

1409
00:58:05,079 --> 00:58:11,119
immune cells are trying to get every

1410
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:13,720
single little flu viral particle right

1411
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:15,640
cell flu viral cell your immune system

1412
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:18,079
is working hard but then your immune

1413
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:20,319
cells get hungry how weak are they do

1414
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:24,119
they have zinc in them are your immune

1415
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:26,720
cells low on zinc is that happening or

1416
00:58:24,119 --> 00:58:29,400
your immune cells low on something thing

1417
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:30,920
what is not feeding your immune cells

1418
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:34,119
now we got to get what we can through

1419
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:36,839
foods but this world has changed man I

1420
00:58:34,119 --> 00:58:40,520
run to people and I I respect that

1421
00:58:36,839 --> 00:58:42,760
because I believe you can heal so much

1422
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:46,240
with Foods right but there's that one

1423
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:48,960
person that that they need support

1424
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:52,720
Beyond food because they're not doing

1425
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:55,200
the foods right or enough of the foods

1426
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:57,480
think about it it's hard right hard to

1427
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:59,760
eat the way you need to eat it's hard to

1428
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:02,160
take care of yourself a lot of different

1429
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:04,359
ways a lot of people they struggle with

1430
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:06,079
that and the stress and then they'll

1431
00:59:04,359 --> 00:59:07,920
emotionally eat then they'll eat

1432
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:09,680
whatever some comfort Foods where

1433
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:11,440
emotionally they can push to their Max

1434
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:12,920
and their brain is about to explode so

1435
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:15,319
they end up eating something that's like

1436
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:16,559
a vice or something that's H right

1437
00:59:15,319 --> 00:59:17,520
something that's in front of them they

1438
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:19,880
gobble

1439
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:22,440
down it's hard to do everything through

1440
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:24,200
food when you can't keep the foods

1441
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:25,559
really good that's a whole problem all

1442
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:27,319
on its own that's what I mean I believe

1443
00:59:25,559 --> 00:59:29,440
you can deal so much with foods but

1444
00:59:27,319 --> 00:59:30,720
people they have a hard time you guys

1445
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:32,720
know you see it out there a hard time

1446
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:34,520
with doing the foods so we need some

1447
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:36,799
other things too and some people need

1448
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:39,480
food and they need the

1449
00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:45,760
supplementation see Andre over there on

1450
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:46,960
IG says and what about zinc oh yeah well

1451
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:48,920
all right so here's what I love right

1452
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:50,920
there's zinc in the total immune right

1453
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:53,720
there so there is zinc in the total

1454
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:56,599
immune there's

1455
00:59:53,720 --> 01:00:00,559
thyme Mullen

1456
00:59:56,599 --> 01:00:02,400
and zinc in the total immune okay not as

1457
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:04,000
much as you're taking extra zinc like

1458
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:05,880
what I'll do is I'll take extra zinc

1459
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:09,520
I'll take

1460
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:13,680
okay so what I'll do is take some zinc

1461
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:16,680
right there you go put some zinc there

1462
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:16,680
and I'll take a total

1463
01:00:17,039 --> 01:00:22,280
immune as

1464
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:24,920
well do a total immune in there and I'll

1465
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:27,599
take a golden seal and a propolis so I

1466
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:30,920
just threw extra zinc in in

1467
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:32,720
there right I'm going to do some golden

1468
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:36,240
seal

1469
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:39,880
right all right

1470
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:42,119
so I added zinc to it because you zinc

1471
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:45,079
deficiencies are rampant out there okay

1472
01:00:42,119 --> 01:00:48,960
so science is saying that men need to

1473
01:00:45,079 --> 01:00:50,880
have sex 21 times a month in order to

1474
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:53,920
keep their prostate healthy so they

1475
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:56,599
don't get prostate cancer so science

1476
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:59,160
just came out with a study there really

1477
01:00:56,599 --> 01:01:02,160
was no study there when you look at

1478
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:03,760
it scientist came out some that said men

1479
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:08,720
have to have

1480
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:10,359
sex 21 times a month every single month

1481
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:11,920
or they're they're going to be risking

1482
01:01:10,359 --> 01:01:16,000
prostate

1483
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:19,039
cancer okay well if a guy is having sex

1484
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:21,880
21 times a month a guy most likely is

1485
01:01:19,039 --> 01:01:24,680
not being too

1486
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:27,160
productive otherwise in their life or

1487
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:30,880
work that's where for

1488
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:34,240
sure pretty much that's a great way to

1489
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:38,079
probably destroy a guy's adrenals over

1490
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:43,240
time if it's 21 times a month without

1491
01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:47,319
fail not five times a month or 10 but 21

1492
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:51,240
science says okay now if a man is having

1493
01:01:47,319 --> 01:01:56,240
sex 21 times a month they have no

1494
01:01:51,240 --> 01:02:02,200
zinc no zinc it is gone

1495
01:01:56,240 --> 01:02:05,920
gone gone like gone bye see you

1496
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:07,400
later okay so if a man is having sex

1497
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:09,960
five times a

1498
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:13,680
month their zinc is

1499
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:16,799
gone yep gone unless they're bringing

1500
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:20,000
zinc in so what happens is science is

1501
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:22,520
saying to protect the man from prostate

1502
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:25,480
cancer they need to be having sex 21

1503
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:27,440
times a month but when you think about

1504
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:31,559
that that means they have no zinc

1505
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:35,039
anymore guess what protects you right

1506
01:02:31,559 --> 01:02:37,799
your immune system protects you from all

1507
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:40,440
kinds of problems like that but then you

1508
01:02:37,799 --> 01:02:43,000
you lose your immune system if a man's

1509
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:46,279
doing that 21 times a

1510
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:48,599
month because they're releasing all

1511
01:02:46,279 --> 01:02:51,680
their zinc they're releasing all of

1512
01:02:48,599 --> 01:02:54,920
their reserves because they're trying to

1513
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:56,480
spread seed right that's what they're

1514
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:59,000
doing they're trying to spread seed on

1515
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:01,079
the planet so they're throwing all of

1516
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:04,119
their phytochemical compounds immune

1517
01:03:01,079 --> 01:03:05,799
supporting nutrients and zinc and b12

1518
01:03:04,119 --> 01:03:07,680
and everything else goes out the door

1519
01:03:05,799 --> 01:03:09,119
it's gone but science says that's just

1520
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:10,520
great because it'll stop you from

1521
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:13,039
getting prostate cancer but this is the

1522
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:15,160
kind of ridiculous crap you see every

1523
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:18,119
day out there all the

1524
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:20,359
time just like science now says even

1525
01:03:18,119 --> 01:03:23,760
though they have no study for it that if

1526
01:03:20,359 --> 01:03:27,559
you pair a tomato

1527
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:29,200
with if you pair a tomato with

1528
01:03:27,559 --> 01:03:31,279
avocado you're going to get the

1529
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:33,400
lycopenes much better and you're going

1530
01:03:31,279 --> 01:03:34,920
to Stave off cancer you're going to

1531
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:38,000
saave something off because you're

1532
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:40,319
eating your tomato with your avocado so

1533
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:42,400
science now says whoa just don't have

1534
01:03:40,319 --> 01:03:44,240
like tomato have your tomato with

1535
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:47,160
avocado first of all science was saying

1536
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:49,039
back I don't know 20 years ago 15 years

1537
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:50,760
ago that no one's allowed to eat a

1538
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:52,640
tomato because it was going to kill you

1539
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:54,240
because it was the nightshade family and

1540
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:57,200
no one was even allowed to so science

1541
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:59,119
was saying stay away from tomato

1542
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:01,000
because they're going to hurt you and

1543
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:03,359
give you arthritis because they're a

1544
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:05,920
Nightshade you know member of the family

1545
01:04:03,359 --> 01:04:08,359
now science is saying if you pair a

1546
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:10,279
tomato with avocado you can save off

1547
01:04:08,359 --> 01:04:12,839
cancer or anything else because it makes

1548
01:04:10,279 --> 01:04:17,200
the lopine so much stronger which is not

1549
01:04:12,839 --> 01:04:20,000
true when you put a lopine or a nutrient

1550
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:23,400
with fat and you have it enter your

1551
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:25,039
bloodstream it won't enter cells the

1552
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:27,000
fats enter your bloodstream and they

1553
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:29,160
inhibit new nutrients like lopine from

1554
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,880
ever entering cells so easily so you

1555
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:33,119
only get a fraction of that tomatoes

1556
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:35,279
lopine because you actually have so much

1557
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:37,359
fat in your system so science is wrong

1558
01:04:35,279 --> 01:04:39,680
again science is wrong wrong wrong wrong

1559
01:04:37,359 --> 01:04:41,400
wrong that's how it works there so

1560
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:44,039
they're telling people you you get more

1561
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:45,920
lopine that to actually save off cancer

1562
01:04:44,039 --> 01:04:47,839
protect you from cancer when you have it

1563
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:50,039
with avocado but when you have it with

1564
01:04:47,839 --> 01:04:52,079
fat you don't get the lopine another

1565
01:04:50,039 --> 01:04:54,279
place science is wrong once again too

1566
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:56,279
they're saying don't have berries and

1567
01:04:54,279 --> 01:04:58,119
antioxidants with your banan cuz your

1568
01:04:56,279 --> 01:04:59,920
bananas inhibited that's not true cuz

1569
01:04:58,119 --> 01:05:02,359
they don't have a study to show that's

1570
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:04,279
actually accurate or anything exists but

1571
01:05:02,359 --> 01:05:06,599
there's always been an attack on bananas

1572
01:05:04,279 --> 01:05:09,440
because bananas actually help people

1573
01:05:06,599 --> 01:05:11,000
from guess what diabetes and

1574
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:12,240
pre-diabetes and everything else and

1575
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,319
they've been trying to keep people off

1576
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:16,839
of bananas to make sure people go on

1577
01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:19,240
lots of medications like metformin and

1578
01:05:16,839 --> 01:05:23,119
so forth it's just crazy how it

1579
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:25,920
works I talk about infertility of not

1580
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:28,599
just women but infertility also of about

1581
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:31,119
men too and how that works and I've

1582
01:05:28,599 --> 01:05:32,960
talked about that for years you know so

1583
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:34,599
in life-changing Foods book you'll see

1584
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:36,559
that I talk about infertility with men

1585
01:05:34,599 --> 01:05:39,359
and everything else in there CU I saw

1586
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:39,359
somebody ask about

1587
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:44,760
that

1588
01:05:41,319 --> 01:05:46,599
yeah so the bottom line is you'll see a

1589
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:49,279
lot of silly things out there over and

1590
01:05:46,599 --> 01:05:51,160
over again another another really

1591
01:05:49,279 --> 01:05:53,440
ridiculous thing that's out there now if

1592
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:55,640
you drink your tea too hot you're going

1593
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:57,079
to get cancer that's the dumbest thing

1594
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:59,359
thing they've ever said because they

1595
01:05:57,079 --> 01:06:02,279
said if you're scolding your esophagus

1596
01:05:59,359 --> 01:06:05,440
first of all in order to scold your

1597
01:06:02,279 --> 01:06:08,039
esophagus to that level you need to be

1598
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:09,480
putting it down burning hot and you're

1599
01:06:08,039 --> 01:06:11,240
still not going to get cancer just

1600
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:13,680
because you scold your you know you're

1601
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:15,640
you're scolding your scalding your

1602
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:18,039
esophagus whatever so it's crazy how it

1603
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:19,920
works so I see this all the time the

1604
01:06:18,039 --> 01:06:23,599
different the different stuff they're

1605
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:26,240
putting out there is nuts so back to

1606
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:28,359
zinc zinc is critical because yeah

1607
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:31,520
because science is actually trying to

1608
01:06:28,359 --> 01:06:34,039
push people to lose their zinc reserves

1609
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:36,440
men and women in all all kinds of

1610
01:06:34,039 --> 01:06:38,640
different ways out there so zinc

1611
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:41,160
deficiencies are really rampant because

1612
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:43,319
we can't get enough zinc as it is so

1613
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:45,599
another thing is people are saying don't

1614
01:06:43,319 --> 01:06:48,960
take zinc because zinc you know

1615
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:51,160
minimizes your copper well we crushed

1616
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:55,799
that in the past because that's not how

1617
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:58,119
it works because copper is so so easy to

1618
01:06:55,799 --> 01:07:00,240
have in your system everybody is

1619
01:06:58,119 --> 01:07:02,640
overloaded with copper we have too much

1620
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:06,000
copper so when you take copper

1621
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:09,640
supplements you're pushing yourself into

1622
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:12,079
copper poisoning when you take copper

1623
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:13,160
based supplements so you'll see out

1624
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:15,799
there people are like oh you're going to

1625
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:18,640
get a copper deficiency if you take zinc

1626
01:07:15,799 --> 01:07:21,720
But the irony is no one's copper

1627
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:24,720
deficient you can't be copper it's

1628
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:26,400
impossible to be copper deficient we

1629
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:29,119
have so much copper Copper at our

1630
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:31,200
fingertips every minute avocados are

1631
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:33,279
high in Copper everything is high in

1632
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:37,079
copper copper is actually saturated in

1633
01:07:33,279 --> 01:07:39,640
the soils all organic farm soil has

1634
01:07:37,079 --> 01:07:42,920
copper in it all fruits and vegetables

1635
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:45,720
herbs nuts seeds people eat all copper

1636
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:47,559
in it right so copper is really high and

1637
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:49,680
then people get sick from an in

1638
01:07:47,559 --> 01:07:51,839
inundation of copper both toxic coppers

1639
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:54,079
and coppers that come from food so what

1640
01:07:51,839 --> 01:07:56,079
happens is they have this copper level

1641
01:07:54,079 --> 01:07:57,799
up to here it gets to the brain their

1642
01:07:56,079 --> 01:08:01,039
brain gets filled with copper and then

1643
01:07:57,799 --> 01:08:02,839
they can't talk right eventually they

1644
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:04,359
start having problems with their memory

1645
01:08:02,839 --> 01:08:08,920
they start having all kinds of different

1646
01:08:04,359 --> 01:08:12,400
issues copper is one of the culprits to

1647
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:14,440
why people are sick but yet zinc

1648
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:17,319
deficiencies are one of the other

1649
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:20,080
culprits to why people are sick zinc

1650
01:08:17,319 --> 01:08:22,640
deficiencies and then copper being

1651
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:24,799
overloaded so when anybody's like oh I

1652
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:26,279
want to take a little zinc cuz they

1653
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:27,600
desperately need their immune system

1654
01:08:26,279 --> 01:08:29,359
desperately needs it they need it to

1655
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:30,600
heal they want to take a little zinc and

1656
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:32,120
then someone comes along and says oh

1657
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:34,400
don't take zinc it's going to get give

1658
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:36,120
you a copper problem it's like that's

1659
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:37,640

excited about that you guys back to the

1712
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:41,280
immune system protecting our immune

1713
01:10:39,719 --> 01:10:43,760
system is critical just want to let

1714
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:46,679
everybody know our immune system is is

1715
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:49,520
inside of our liver it's there every day

1716
01:10:46,679 --> 01:10:51,880
preventing people from getting hepatitis

1717
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:55,000
C which is the low grade viral

1718
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:57,040
infections you know hepatitis in general

1719
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,880
in your immune systems in your liver

1720
01:10:57,040 --> 01:11:00,440
your immune systems in your pancreas

1721
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:03,640
trying to prevent you from getting

1722
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:05,199
pancreatic tumors pancreatic cysts so

1723
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:07,640
your immune system is all around your

1724
01:11:05,199 --> 01:11:10,000
pancreas and in your pancreas your

1725
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:11,679
immune system obviously your spleen

1726
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:14,040
right you know that your immune system

1727
01:11:11,679 --> 01:11:16,560
is in your gut but not even a fraction

1728
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:18,159
of what it is in your lymphatic system

1729
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:20,640
throughout your body and in your

1730
01:11:18,159 --> 01:11:22,760
bloodstream so your immune system mostly

1731
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:24,080
is in the bloodstream though to protect

1732
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:26,400
you that's the whole point if your

1733
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:28,520
immune system isn't in your bloodstream

1734
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:30,640
then we would be in big trouble so our

1735
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:32,320
bone marrows producing overdrive

1736
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:33,920
everybody's immune cells to try to

1737
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:36,199
battle everything out of the Sun from

1738
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:38,040
stealth bugs to bugs that they're just

1739
01:11:36,199 --> 01:11:40,080
spilling at every day and Manufacturing

1740
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:42,280
and putting out on us whatever it is

1741
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:44,320
that we're up against okay your bone

1742
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:47,400

1746
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,960
what you have to look out for that but

1747
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:55,560
either way your immune system is

1748
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:57,840
floating around your bloodstream to

1749
01:11:55,560 --> 01:12:00,320
