1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,160
that in mind

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,540
that it's possible their ego could rise

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,639
up there's a lot of people out there to

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,940
be like I don't have an ego

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,920
no way I I'm totally not eager I don't

6
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,199
have the ego and then

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,080
there but then

8
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:22,140
you can see it it'll rise up it'll rise

9
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:26,340
up this is another thing the ego that's

10
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:30,359
it that's in everyone can be dormant

11
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:32,099
someone can have a dormant ego

12
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,200
isn't that interesting I swear to

13
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:37,860
compassion told me that that

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,719
ego can be in its dormancy

15
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,399
in someone

16
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:44,700
how incredible that piece of information

17
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:46,680
is alone that's for the compassion uh

18
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,899
has taught me it's like what do you mean

19
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,899
in its dormancy what do you mean by that

20
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:54,180
like how is an ego in its dormancy some

21
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:55,920
someone please tell me right like what

22
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:59,160
and

23
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,440
Spirit of compassion was like

24
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,379
dormancy meaning

25
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:08,580
it's in its infancy in some people too

26
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:11,760
that's incredible so an ego can develop

27
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,900
you mean it can actually be in it in its

28
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,280
infancy

29
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,520
and then

30
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:20,520
develop as time goes on

31
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:24,299
so it's one way somebody's ego can grow

32
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:27,479
another way is they can have

33
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:30,540
strong ego deep down inside

34
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:33,720
but it doesn't get Unleashed

35
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:36,740
until a trigger moment so that's another

36
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,780
thing too someone can have this

37
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:44,040
big

38
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:46,259
dark ego deep down inside

39
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,200
and it's there

40
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:53,100
and it doesn't peek its head out and

41
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,540
then it experience or a huge trigger can

42
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,820
occur

43
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,220
and then it just gets Unleashed and just

44
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:01,619
explodes

45
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:03,360
interesting right

46
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:07,079
someone said

47
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:09,599

00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:10,800

576. you guys 576 of brain saver here I

69
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:55,940
am

70
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,940
when everything changes

71
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:02,340
the not so sick

72
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,840
fall every day and become the sick

73
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,180
do you know anybody who's the not so

74
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,060
sick I just wanted to ask you guys The

75
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,860
Not So Sick is someone who they're not

76
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,360
chronically ill

77
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,519
but they might have a chronic symptom

78
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,920
maybe they get a headache once in a

79
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:18,599
while maybe they feel kind of low once

80
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,700
in a while maybe they have a mild mild

81
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:23,099
depression maybe they have a little bit

82
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:26,040
of acne maybe their stomach bloats up

83
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:27,599
and they get a they get a stomach bloat

84
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,040
here and there

85
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,659
and then they go to their functional

86
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,840
medicine doctor and they go to another

87
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:36,360
guy and another guy and they get a

88
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,640
little tune up they get told stay off of

89
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,319
processed foods then they're back in

90
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,180
Action right then they're trying this

91
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,860
and trying that they're doing cod liver

92
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,420
oil they're doing whatever fish oil

93
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:49,140
they're doing microbiome stuff whatever

94
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:50,700
it is and that's the not so sick you

95
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:52,019
know there's different degrees of not so

96
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,940
sick keep that in mind there's different

97
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:55,920
degrees of not so sick

98
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:57,900
and then there's the sick right

99
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,299
chronically ill that's when we're sick

100
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:04,500
there's that's a whole entire level of

101
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:06,480
degree that's when we're like sick right

102
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,340
so when everything changes so I'll just

103
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,379
read a little bit of this The Not So

104
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,420
Sick fall every day

105
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:14,220
and become the sick and that's the thing

106
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,780
that you got to think about you'll see

107
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,880
people they're not so sick they're not

108
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:20,459
so sick and they weigh back and forth

109
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,800
and then their scale tips

110
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:25,740
and when they're scale tips

111
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,259
they get sicker they get sick so they go

112
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,479
from not so sick to sick right they

113
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:32,759
start out with some acne and they get a

114
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:35,040
couple of bad colds once in a while and

115
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:37,280
they feel a little bit of fatigue and

116
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,840
then comes the day when they're like

117
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,580
neurological problems aches and pains

118
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,800
tingles and numbness barely function

119
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:46,620
brain fog in the worst way and now

120
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:49,820
they've gone from the sick the not so

121
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,820
sick too sick

122
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,560
that's commonly when the realizations

123
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,360
come

124
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,520
interesting I've seen people that were

125
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,580
just not so sick

126
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:05,940
and then they get sick and then the

127
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:08,759
realizations come

128
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:11,280
the fall they take brings them to a new

129
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:12,180
Awakening about how they perceive the

130
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,220
world

131
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:16,680

00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:44,100
sick in absolutely different degrees

170
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:47,220
different degrees of not so sick this is

171
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:49,259
an incredible topic really Hannity oh

172
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:50,940
man I remember the day my scale tipped

173
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:53,280
exactly

174
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:55,680
the scale tips Everything Changes it

175
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,660
changes how we perceive the world this

176
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,940
is a big deal educating myself says it's

177
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:04,560
a real humble sandwich

178
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:07,319
so true so true Hannity says I was I was

179
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,919
not so sick for years the fall was

180
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:14,639
absolutely my Awakening this is so true

181
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:17,220
it is isn't it the words in here they

182
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,919
match what you guys experience and and

183
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:22,740
and have felt so one thing about Spirit

184
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,780
of compassion knowing where people are

185
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,880
and what happens with when we get

186
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:30,780
chronically sick

187
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:33,900
the fall The Not So Sick take

188
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:36,120
when they become sick brings them to a

189
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:38,160
new Awakening about how they perceive

190
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,800
the world and then

191
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:44,520

192
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,919

202
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:09,539
they get

203
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:11,400

really mild

212
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,580
and it waves from going back and forth

213
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:32,820
waivers from going back and forth from

214
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:35,719
worse to to not so bad whatever The Not

I'm in the page number 576 on medical

217
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:44,399
meaning brain saver that's where I am

218
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,980
and I'm in

219
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:49,680
until then The Not So Sick may feel safe

220
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:52,500
and secure in how they've gotten

221
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:55,080
they're minor or temporary symptoms

222
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:57,420
under control are solved

223
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,320
I solve that symptom my brain fog's

224
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:01,260
better

225
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,779
it wasn't that bad to begin with but my

226
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:07,440
brain fog is better I solved that

227
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:10,080
symptom I'm feeling stronger my adrenals

228
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,360
feel stronger I went to a doctor a

229
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,300
practitioner they gave me some vitamins

230
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:18,480
told me to eat better and get some rest

231
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:22,399
I got my you know aches and pains better

232
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,399

235
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,080
their minor or temporary symptoms under

236
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,600
control or solved they feel confident

237
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:35,580
because they tend to find some help in

238
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:39,060
the form of a functional medicine doctor

239
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:41,580
or practitioner or chiropractor who

240
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:43,620
purports to specialize in more advanced

241
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:46,140

242
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:49,440

244
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,040

went to them and they're better

252
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,779
I'm better

253
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,740
when they find these Health Care

254
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:18,540
Providers the not so sick people are at

255
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:20,459

259
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,459
completely understand

260
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:35,040
when The Not So Sick find these health

00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:44,640
beginning of the learning curve

265
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:47,640
you're getting symptoms for the first

266
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:50,100
time you're not so sick you find a

267
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:52,500
health care provider seems to know his

268
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:54,959

find out these may not be the answers

286
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:41,339
because their scale hasn't tipped

287
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,860
just slain

288
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:47,880
I just got some x-rays last week of my

289
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:50,100
spine as I was years ago I would need to

290
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:53,220
see a chiropractor perpetually

291
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:55,079
now he told me I am 90 better all since

292
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:58,440
having changed to Medical medium diet

293
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:59,940

294
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,339
you're here and happy you're you're

295
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:04,760
doing better truly because that's what

296
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:04,760
it's all about

297
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,560
the not so sick

298
00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:21,360
ngoc says I was a not so sick suddenly

299
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,380
celery juice and lemon water is not

300
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,019
enough

301
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:28,620
totally I get it when that happens now I

302
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:31,620
am taking around 15 Bemidji vitamins it

303
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:32,519
made such a difference with the brain

304
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:35,399
shots

305
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:37,800
I'm not addicted to coffee anymore and

306
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:39,140
people ask me what do I do like what do

307
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:42,839
I do

308
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:43,920
I don't want to become a not so sick

309
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:47,100
person

310
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:50,880
I don't want to become a sick person

311
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:54,180
can I become a sick person

312
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:57,060
I burn myself to the ground

313
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:59,940
so anything's possible

314
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:02,279
because the amount of stress I'm under

315
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:04,740
the amount of fires I have to die out

316
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:06,420
I'm up against so much that people don't

317
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,560
even know the communities don't even

318
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:09,420
know the medical medium communities

319
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,920
don't even know

320
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:13,980
and

321
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:16,740
so I take care of myself right I have to

322
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:18,959
I have to use medical medium tools

323
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:22,320
that's what I have to do

324
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:25,380
like when I when I put together the

325
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,600
brain saver books I was doing 20 22 hour

326
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:30,420

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,680

328
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,839
everything else everybody else is

329
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,360
exposed to breathing in Kate chemicals

330
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:40,620
from Neighbors blowing out of their

331
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:43,500

332
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:46,380

00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:25,199
compassion every minute

374
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:27,060
the stress of that

375
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:29,579
I'm thinking

376
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:32,040
because I'm My Own being it's not only

377
00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:33,839
do I hear Spirit of compassion

378
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:37,199
and the wisdom and the words and spirit

379
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:39,959
of compassion I'm my own self I I have

380
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:42,540
to hear my own brain like everybody has

381
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:45,060
to hear their own brain

382
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:46,980
I'm not just going

383
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:50,600
to self-care appointments all day long

384
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:50,600
I'm not getting massages

385
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,500
I'm not getting facials I'm not relaxing

386
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:58,380
in a spa ah I would love that nice

387
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:00,000
facial I would love that nice massage

388
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:03,480
I'm not on the beach

389
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,600
you know getting some Sun every day

390
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:08,459
the point I'm trying to say is that

391
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,680
I don't want to be a not so sick person

392
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:12,720
and I don't want to be a sick person I

393
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:15,240
want to be strong I want to make sure

394
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:18,720
that I keep myself

395
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:21,180
above board up to par so I can deliver

396
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,220
and be the messenger that I have to be

397
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:25,019
and so I know when I read your comment

398
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:26,639
you said you celery juice wasn't enough

399
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:28,680
you were not so sick and then celery

400
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,360
juice wasn't enough anymore you had to

401
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,800
venture on and I'm I'm really proud of

402
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,800
you by the way you had to venture on

403
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:37,259
into customizing and doing medical

404
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,759
medium protocols and moving forward and

405
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:41,579
you said you had to do 50 you were doing

406
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:43,680
15 Bemidji supplements I'm doing that

407
00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:45,600
too because of all the reasons I was

408
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,519
just explaining I don't want to be I

409
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,139
have to be Pro proactive I don't want to

410
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,540
be a sick person and I don't want to be

411
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:53,399
a not so sick person either so I don't

412
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:54,959
want to be that either so that's why you

413
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:56,639
know these are here

414
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:58,620
that's why they're here and that's why

415
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,079
I'm taking them I take them in the

416
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:03,800
morning and everything and

417
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:03,800
at night

418
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:11,400
when The Not So Sick find these Health

419
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:14,459
Care Providers out there when they're

420
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:16,980
not so sick okay they can get some tips

421
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:17,939
and tricks stay off of this stay off of

422
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:20,579
that

423
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:23,059
get some more rest here's here's some

424
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:23,059
vitamins

425
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:28,500
not so sick people are at the beginning

426
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:31,200
of their learning curve that's the whole

427
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:34,080
thing they're at the beginning of their

428
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,059
learning curve

429
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,940
and what they learned from their doctor

430
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:41,280
or practitioner is new to them and like

431
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:43,080
I was saying before also krill oil is

432
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,640
better than fish oil cod liver oil okay

433
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,559
I'll take krill oil I just learned that

434
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,440
oh vitamin D I can take a whole bunch of

435
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:52,260
vitamin D okay good I'll take that right

436
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,840
and they learn their their newbies right

437
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:56,039
and they learn these Basics which is

438
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,600
really interesting how it works they

439
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:59,400
learn these basics

440
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,960
and it's like okay and they start

441
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,400
feeling a little better because they're

442
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,320
starting to take care of themselves a

443
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,480
little bit right oh stay away from fried

444
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:09,299
greasy Foods all right that sounds good

445
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,980
I won't eat as much pizza I won't eat as

446
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:12,720
much whatever I'll stay away from

447
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:15,179
processed foods so they're not so sick

448
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,520
it's a learning curve they go from that

449
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:19,740
conventional mindset and now they're

450
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:22,020
like they're starting to do that they're

451
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:23,820
not sick enough yet to find out these

452
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:25,320
may not be the answers because the

453
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,880
problems they're dealing with are

454
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,039
manageable did you hear that you guys

455
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,960
manageable the problems that they're

456
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:33,179
dealing with are manageable

457
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:36,960
think about that

458
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:39,360
so they're manageable problems

459
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:42,900
when you get too sick in the scale tips

460
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:45,240
the problems aren't manageable so much

461
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:46,919
anymore that's something people don't

462
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,320
realize

463
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:51,780
because the problems The Not So Sick are

464
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:53,460
dealing with are manageable isn't it

465
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:55,580
interesting well Macaulay neurological

466
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:57,720
symptoms are so humbling oh my God

467
00:18:55,580 --> 00:19:00,840
neurological symptoms

468
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:02,539
are so humbling

469
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:06,179
they

470
00:19:02,539 --> 00:19:09,360
beat the pants off of people

471
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:12,179
they are so humbling Corinne Angelina

472
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:14,820
says I'm the Newbie laugh out loud

473
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:18,059
Corinne thank you for being here

474
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:20,340
I welcome newbies hang in there

475
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:22,620
I won't bring Dr Nesbitt out

476
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:24,780
Kareem Angelina says I'm slowly starting

477
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:26,520
to feel a lot better thank God Karina I

478
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:29,160
won't bring Dr Nesbitt out because Dr

479
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:32,700
Nesbitt will make you probably say I'm

480
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:34,500
not following medical medium anymore

481
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:36,780
all right

482
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:39,960
so someone said what's propolis good for

483
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:41,580
I mean I can only tell you this

484
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,960
about I don't want to I don't want to

485
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,520
make this about propolis today or

486
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,320
anything like that I mean I know it's

487
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,539
critical to talk about propolis it's

488
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,160
critical to talk about zinc

489
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:51,960
it's critical it's critical to talk

490
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,059
about that people are sick and getting

491
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:56,100
sicker and we can talk about it later

492
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:57,660
today or on a telegram or something go

493
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:59,880
to my telegram I could leave a message

494
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:02,059
there for everybody exclusive message or

495
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,059
something

496
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,700
The Not So Sick are not sick enough to

497
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:11,340
find out that there really aren't good

498
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:13,919
enough answers yet because the problems

499
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:16,380
The Not So Sick are deal faced with are

500
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:19,020
manageable I know I said that but I have

501
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:21,419
to say it again because it's so true

502
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:24,120
Michelle says mattress Island here

503
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:26,160
mattress Island

504
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:28,440
they're manageable enough that they seem

505
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:31,980
to be partially or even temporarily

506
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:34,860
solved by what seems to be smart Cutting

507
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:37,320
Edge thinking and Alternative Health

508
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:39,960
it's so smart Alternative Health it's

509
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:42,480
Cutting Edge the problems that they had

510
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:46,500
were not that problematic so they were

511
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:48,780
manageable and even temporarily fixed so

512
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:51,840
now alternative medicine is literally

513
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:53,640
like the gold star it's like it knows

514
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,980
everything it feels when you're not so

515
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:59,160
sick think about that

516
00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:02,520
Jennifer Cockrell says my daughter has

517
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:04,860
migraines almost daily I'm so sorry and

518
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:07,320
she just refuses to do anything about it

519
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:11,059
it's just become normal to her like it

520
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:11,059

proteins

00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:50,520
stay in a keto direction or well we'll

532
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:53,100

look at your nutritional profile

537
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,679
see where your deficiencies are

538
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:12,840
the not so secure that all the time

539
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:14,760
okay and if they're not so sick they've

540
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,620
got a manageable little problem well

541
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:20,460
that's all great Cutting Edge science

542
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:23,039
everybody believes but man

543
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:24,900
it's not reality to what really happens

544
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:27,179
when you're really sick

545
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,620
because that isn't the Band-Aid that

546
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:31,200
fixes things when you're really sick

547
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:32,580
when you go from not so sick to woo to

548
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,840
sick

549
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:35,840
all the above it yourself

550
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,500
when you're hearing any of this for the

551
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,260
first time

552
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:44,480
you can feel satisfaction in the advice

553
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:48,299
you're getting

554
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:51,240
wow I got a smart practitioner

555
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:53,100
they know so much

556

Cindy lamence says my natural path had

619
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:20,400
me eating three eggs a day and on the

620
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:21,600
keto diet then I got really sick and

621
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,980
thankfully found medical medium

622
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,059
information that's what I'm trying to

623
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:26,340
say here

624
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:28,440
all this seems like a great thing for

625
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:30,659
the not so sick and a lot of them bounce

626
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:32,760
back but when you get too sick this is

627
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:35,220
not a great thing

628
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:38,700
Sandra Sheehan says medical meaning

629
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:41,340
protocols have decreased my 25 years of

630
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:44,100
migraine significantly that's incredible

631
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:46,740
by the way it has taken a few years but

632
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:47,820
so worth it hang in there that's what

633
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:50,220
Sandra said

634
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:54,240
people are asking about migraines

635
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:56,760
right and I talk about migraines and my

636
00:25:54,240 --> 00:26:00,299
migraine protocols in the protocols

637
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,299
groups oh

638
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:06,960
but you need both books it's critical

639
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:09,559
because they talk about it in both books

640
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,559
all right

641
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:14,640

do caffeine every single day you can

647
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,620
still exercise

648
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:35,279
every single day you're not a canary you

649
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:37,080

00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:41,960

653
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:49,200
you're at this place in your life where

654
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:51,419
I'm young I'm in my 20s

655
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,279
I went to this naturopath I went to

656
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:56,340

respect for uh chiropractors I have

660
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:05,520

verbalists you have to understand that

664
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:14,760
total respect for all doctors looking

665
00:27:12,779 --> 00:27:16,140
out for their patients they care about

666
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:18,000
their patients they have compassion for

667
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:20,220
their patients

668
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,960
so I need that up front and we have a

669
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:24,080
lot of practitioners in Med in medical

670
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:28,460
meeting communities we have a lot of

671
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,460
practitioners and doctors and so forth

672
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:38,400
lupus free with celery33 I was just sent

673
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:41,400
an article that vegans have a higher

674
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:43,919
rate of Strokes I laughed and said not

675
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:46,020
all vegans only those that eat all fat

676
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,539
or high fat diets they never know the

677
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:49,919
cause yet caution you lupus free seller

678
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:53,640
you're spot on

679
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:55,140
it's not just Strokes vegans

680
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:58,500
get sick

681
00:27:55,140 --> 00:28:00,419
and the fats are just one problem

682
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,860
and like you said the other problem is

683
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:03,840
they don't know why they're even sick to

684
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:05,400
begin with that's another problem and

685
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,260
they have so many more problems right

686
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,820
and medical medium information talks

687
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:10,980
about

688
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:13,799
and I'm pro-vegan

689
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:15,480

times 10.

691
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,500
and I'm also supportive for anybody that

692
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:21,720
wants to eat animal protein too

693
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:23,159
because they do it wrong too it's not

694
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:26,480
just the vegans that do it wrong the

695
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:26,480
animal protein people do it wrong

696
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:32,820
and I wouldn't know what anybody did

697
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,919
wrong I would be

698
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:37,919
in the mix of all the health world

699
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:40,200
that's where I chose my path to be

700
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:42,059
and I would never know what anybody was

701
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,559
doing wrong I'd be like everybody else

702
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:45,539
just pissing in the wind and throwing

703
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:48,360
darts at the side of a barn

704
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:51,179
but it's because of soc do I know and

705
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:54,380
it's because these incredible books

706
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:54,380
do I know right

707
00:28:54,600 --> 00:29:00,620
other than that I wouldn't know what

708
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,620
direction to piss in

709
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:04,520

00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:27,120
and get it for free I don't care I just

742
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,279
want you to have it

743
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:31,679
I never thought they would be this low I

744
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:34,440
never ever ever thought they would be

745
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:36,360
this low in price they're both over 600

746
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:38,820
pages each they're heavy they're two big

747
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:41,299
Bibles it's one big book

748
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:41,299
okay

749
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,980
forgive me I am going back to the

750
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,980
reading

751
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:51,120
when you're hearing any of this for the

752
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:52,799
first time and you're not so sick you

753
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,720
can feel that satisfaction I talked

754
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:57,360
about you're strong

755
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,700
and now you become a health expert how

756
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,899
many times have I seen it and it's not

757
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,880
just young people but you'll see people

758
00:31:00,899 --> 00:31:05,399
they're like 25 years old or 20 years

759
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,200
old or whatever right they have a not so

760
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:09,240
sick problem they have some acting

761
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:12,179
that's really Mild they get a little bit

762
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:14,159
of brain fog they go to a naturopath or

763
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:16,440
a functional medicine doctor they get

764
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:18,360
taught a few tricks they get off of

765
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:20,100
processed foods now they're on their

766
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:21,659
page and they're teaching about it right

767
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:23,940
and they're talking about it now they're

768
00:31:21,659 --> 00:31:26,100
a health influencer but they don't know

769
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:27,840
the difference they don't know that

770
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:29,580
somebody might not be a not so sick

771
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,679
person somebody might be a very very

772
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:33,539
sick person and they're listening to the

773
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,460
not so sick person and the sick person

774
00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:37,679
doesn't really know that the not so sick

775
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:40,140
person never really got sick

776
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:42,120
so they don't know so like oh krill oil

777
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:45,360
that's great oh sodium bicarbonate oh

778
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:46,919
that's great oh whatever vitamin D and a

779
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,659
really high dosage oh that's great and

780
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:50,880
they just don't know

781
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:52,500
and so the confusion happens right there

782
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,299
right it's almost like and I'm just

783
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:56,039
naming a few things just off the top of

784
00:31:54,299 --> 00:31:57,960
my head

785
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:59,820
but the point is is the not so sick

786
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:01,919
person is now an expert

787
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:03,960
because they got rid of their mild not

788
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,399
so sick symptom and they're really

789
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:08,100
strong and their scale hasn't been

790
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:10,260
tipped yet and they're young but now

791
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:13,980
they're an expert so now they're not

792
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:16,559
only doing say fashion or sports or

793
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:18,120
something on their IG page or IG account

794
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,679
now they're doing health and they're

795
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:21,120
doing like what I eat in a day and

796
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:23,460
everything else

797
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:25,620
because they become they think they

798
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:27,120
become an expert they were not so sick

799
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:29,760
to begin with and they think they become

800
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:32,039
an expert so now they're teaching

801
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,240
as if they're experts and there's a

802
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:34,500
million of them out there right there's

803
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,659
a billion of them out there that's how

804
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:38,480
it's done now

805
00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:40,799

812
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:59,779
their health

813
00:32:57,299 --> 00:33:03,860
if a not so sick person

814
00:32:59,779 --> 00:33:03,860
experienced a symptom or two

815
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:09,960
they believe they're experts now

816
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:13,080
they had an acute problem or condition

817
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:15,480
or intermittent symptom that was

818
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:17,940
perplexing them they got some help

819
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:20,880

00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:24,120
Cutting Edge information

821

00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:35,159
they're giving advice on their platforms

825
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:38,460
giving guidance to other people who are

826
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:41,519
far more sick

827
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:43,919
far more sick

828
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:46,740
when you're not so sick you can play in

829
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:48,480

830
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:51,919
trying new supplements in alternative

00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,919
medicine like Pearl powder

832
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:56,640
or whatever go back to chlorella which

833
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:58,740
is really toxic

834
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:01,019

849
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:37,379
alternative medicine or read about old

00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:40,520
techniques that have been around for the

851
00:34:37,379 --> 00:34:40,520

lose your mind

858
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:57,900

00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:10,920
taking a soft topic I can't help we're

928
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:13,200
talking about the not so sick and what

929
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:15,480
they go through and the sick and what

930
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:17,280
they go through soon Melanie says I got

931
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:18,599
rid of my canker sores with them as you

932
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:22,140
propolis

933
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:24,420
and so has so many people

934
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:25,859
so has so many people

935
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:27,900
from what I'm hearing from Doctor

936
00:38:25,859 --> 00:38:30,599
friends from what I'm hearing from

937
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:32,280
people and family and and other people

938
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:34,800
out there families friends and stuff

939
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:37,619
like that yeah

940
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,540
but it's not just propolis the thing is

941
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:41,220
is people can't get this confused though

942
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:43,380
if you don't know what we're even

943
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:45,119
talking about if this is kind of like I

944
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:46,440
feel like this is an inside thing right

945
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:47,700
if you don't know what we're talking

946
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,900
about and you just got here and you

947
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:51,240
don't even know what we're saying this

948
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:53,760
is the beverage propolis cure so no

949
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:56,940
one's confused because propolis won't do

950
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:58,500
that they're not the same

951
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:01,800
um but that's the propolis pure from

952
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:04,260
emoji so anyway the V is in Victor i m e

953
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:06,420
r g y you guys know I endorse these guys

954
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:09,020

yeah

956
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:13,800
make a wholeheartedly

957
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:16,079
deservingly so

958
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:18,619
deserving Lisa

959
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:18,619
all right

960
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:25,140
little does someone who's a not so sick

961
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:27,020
person

962
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:29,040
who thinks they're a health expert

963
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:30,839
realized that the theories and

964
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:33,660
supplements and old techniques are the

965
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:36,720
ones the sick have already tried

966
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:39,000
trendy products trendy machines the sick

967
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:42,240
have tried them all and they've only

968
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,099
gone downhill they have experience of

969
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,720
charcoal bringing them down and not

970
00:39:44,099 --> 00:39:47,640
realizing they have the experience of

971
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,839
things bringing them down and not

972
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:51,240
realizing they've tried everything

973
00:39:48,839 --> 00:39:53,940
meanwhile The Not So Sick can play in

974
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:56,579
these trendy places they can play in

975
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:59,640
this they can play Reindeer Games The

976
00:39:56,579 --> 00:40:04,440
Not So Sick they're not sick enough yet

977
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:07,440
there's their scale hasn't tipped

978
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:09,839
and even they can even revive old

979
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:12,000
techniques and theories for other not so

980
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:13,800
sick people to play in they can do that

981
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,540
too and they're not so sick actually

982
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:17,060
revive

983
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:20,520
old

984
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:21,900
tools products and theories that were

985
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:24,180
bad

986
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:25,980
but the not so sick can revive those

987
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:29,900
because they're not sick enough yet to

988
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:29,900
realize those are really bad

989
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:34,740
and they do it for the other not so sick

990
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:37,320
people to play in oh I tried this I

991
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:41,780
tried that I tried bentonite clay

992
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:41,780
um I tried this right in the whole bit

993
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:45,720
they end up making them popular again so

994
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:48,119
it's like

995
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:50,940
hell comes back to haunt

996
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:53,240
people Michelle L says I needed this

997
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:53,240
today

998
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:02,820
so meanwhile the not so sick influencers

999
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:06,300
or the not so sick people out there that

1000
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:08,339
think they're Health experts revive

1001
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:10,079
things that should have been put to

1002
00:41:08,339 --> 00:41:11,880
sleep a long time ago

1003
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:14,820
and they revive them through social

1004
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:17,099
media and other media sources for the

1005
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:19,020
other not so sick people to play with

1006
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:21,960
but what happens is the really sick

1007
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:25,880
people who haven't tried that yet end up

1008
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:25,880
trying it and go down even further

1009
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:32,339
The Not So Sick don't realize that as

1010
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:34,320
they get sicker down the road because

1011
00:41:32,339 --> 00:41:36,119
their health scale has finally ticked

1012
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:38,099
and that's what happens there's a whole

1013
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:40,380
bunch of not so sick people out there

1014
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:42,420
right now

1015
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:43,740
and down the road their scale is going

1016
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:46,500
to tip

1017
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:49,560
there's millions of not so sick people

1018
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:52,820
right now millions and their scale is

1019
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:52,820
going to eventually tip

1020
00:41:52,859 --> 00:41:57,240
the approaches they were trying for

1021
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:59,339
their health will show themselves not to

1022
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:02,099
be useful

1023
00:41:59,339 --> 00:42:04,680
the recommended diets from their health

1024
00:42:02,099 --> 00:42:06,119
care providers direct amended tools and

1025
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:07,980
techniques and supplements from their

1026
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:10,680
health care providers all of it will

1027
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:12,300
prove not as helpful as they as the

1028
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:14,460
scale tips and they get sicker and

1029
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:16,380
sicker and sicker

1030
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:17,880
I mean I believe in doctors of course I

1031
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:20,460
support doctors do what's right for you

1032
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:22,680
and go to your doctor and and do what

1033
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:24,960
your doctor tells you what they were

1034
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:26,880
invested in or guiding others should do

1035
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,380
was not ultimately helpful do you see

1036
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,820
that now you know I've seen this with

1037
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:33,480
YouTube I've had people tell me about

1038
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:36,119
people's YouTubes right out there

1039
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:38,160
where two years ago they're like

1040
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:40,200
promoting all this stuff right they're

1041
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:42,119
not so sick they're like oh here I'm a

1042
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:44,579
health expert on YouTube and they're

1043
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:46,020
promoting stuff and then they're not

1044
00:42:44,579 --> 00:42:49,200
promoting it anymore and they're not

1045
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:50,880
eating that way anymore what happened it

1046
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,440
wasn't working for them so now they're

1047
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,520
trying something else they're not so

1048
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,440
sick and they're trying something else

1049
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:57,599
like it's this crazy thing

1050
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,579
nothing's consistent

1051
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:02,099
over here in Rumble since I've been

1052
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:04,020
listening and reading books I began to

1053
00:43:02,099 --> 00:43:06,780
understand my body's soul and spirit

1054
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:09,359
thank you for reading the magazine books

1055
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:13,260
incredible

1056
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:15,540
here's one on Rumble back in 1999 just

1057
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:16,800
you you hate when comments go up and up

1058
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:20,060
and up and then you can't catch them

1059
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,060
let's see if I can catch a new one

1060
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,780
they go up

1061
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:28,920
see if I can catch this one oh my gosh

1062
00:43:26,099 --> 00:43:31,500
that's the truth explanation points when

1063
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:33,359
I couldn't exercise that was when it was

1064
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:35,760
a steady down

1065
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:37,800
The Not So Sick and exercise The Not So

1066
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,720
Sick can go into the gym and they could

1067
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:41,220
Groove and move not so sick because

1068
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:43,319
they're not sick really

1069
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:45,000
they can exercise their scale hasn't

1070
00:43:43,319 --> 00:43:46,140
tipped they don't know what it's like to

1071
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,940
be on mattress Island they don't know

1072
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:49,940
what it's like to be whoa cut short

1073
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:55,079
if you're on YouTube right now or Rumble

1074
00:43:52,859 --> 00:43:57,480
can you give this video a thumbs up or

1075
00:43:55,079 --> 00:44:01,099
whatever like a thumbs up or rumble or

1076
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:01,099
whatever that would be amazing

1077
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:09,720
before that day comes when their health

1078
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:11,220
worsens the not so sick person when the

1079
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:13,560
scale is tipped

1080
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:15,780
before that day comes it doesn't take

1081
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:18,599
much for a not so sick person to feel a

1082
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:21,839
benefit from a health technique

1083
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:23,099
when someone's not so sick they can feel

1084
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:25,319
a benefit

1085
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:27,859
from practically any toxic Health

1086
00:44:25,319 --> 00:44:27,859
technique

1087
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:30,780
is that crazy

1088
00:44:29,339 --> 00:44:32,819
when they're not so sick because their

1089
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:34,140
body is overcompensating it constantly

1090
00:44:32,819 --> 00:44:36,599
because they're really not that sick

1091
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:38,160
their bodies over compensating it so

1092
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:40,200
they overcompensate that Health

1093
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:43,280
technique even if it's toxic even if

1094
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:43,280
it's problematic

1095
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:47,099
Michelle says or they lie about using

1096
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:50,760
medical meaning while misleading others

1097
00:44:47,099 --> 00:44:53,940
actually that we have tremendous amount

1098
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:56,880
of proof that that happens Non-Stop

1099
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:58,619
that people are using mm

1100
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,000
all the supermodels are doing celery

1101
00:44:58,619 --> 00:45:01,980
juice

1102
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,140
they're not talking about it look

1103
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:06,000
everybody's like the amount of medical

1104
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:08,720
meaning being used where do you think

1105
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,099
the zinc thing blew up how zinc blew up

1106
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:13,020
both in the conventional world now of

1107
00:45:11,099 --> 00:45:15,680
Health like it's like it's it's

1108
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:15,680
unbelievable

1109
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:21,540
Karen Karen Hartman said oh my God it's

1110
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:24,420
like you're talking about me I did the

1111
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:25,980
charcoal bentonite clay humic and now

1112
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:27,900
feeling like I am at a Tipping Point

1113
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:33,500
thank you for your information and what

1114
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:33,500
you do Karen completely understand I do

1115
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:38,460
before that day comes for the not so

1116
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:40,020
sick person when their health worsens it

1117
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:43,920
doesn't take much for a not so sick

1118
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:45,780
person to feel a benefit from a health

1119
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,660
technique that's toxic

1120
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:50,000
many of these people are only

1121
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:52,859
intermittently sick they're only

1122
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:55,859
intermittently sick with a mild symptom

1123
00:45:52,859 --> 00:45:58,500
that comes and goes on its own

1124
00:45:55,859 --> 00:46:00,060
no one realizes they are just an

1125
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:03,440
experiment for the Alternative Health

1126
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:03,440
world too at the same time

1127
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:07,859
so dealing with a mild symptom that

1128
00:46:05,819 --> 00:46:10,740
comes and goes on its own seeming to get

1129
00:46:07,859 --> 00:46:12,359
better with a little bit of sleep

1130
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:13,800
you know

1131
00:46:12,359 --> 00:46:16,920
you know what

1132
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:19,140
a sick person knows do you know what a

1133
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:20,640
sick person knows that's been there and

1134
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:23,520
tried everything

1135
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:25,579
they know

1136
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:27,420
that if they get a little bit of sleep

1137
00:46:25,579 --> 00:46:29,099
it doesn't mean they're going to be

1138
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:31,140
fixed the next day

1139
00:46:29,099 --> 00:46:33,560
well you know nons not so sick people

1140
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:35,940
all not so sick people have to do

1141
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:38,099
depending on what degree of not so sick

1142
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:40,200
they just need to get sleep for a couple

1143
00:46:38,099 --> 00:46:41,520
days

1144
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:43,440
that's all

1145
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:46,940
but the scale tips eventually and then

1146
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,940
they're not they're not in that position

1147
00:46:47,819 --> 00:46:52,680
The Not So Sick seemingly get better

1148
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:54,800

foreign

1168
00:47:44,119 --> 00:47:48,359
people are only intermittently sick with

1169
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:50,579
a mild symptom that comes and goes on

1170
00:47:48,359 --> 00:47:52,200

breathing class or workout class

1176
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:07,260
they think they have the Panacea they're

1177
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:08,880
not so sick

1178
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:10,680
that's all they needed to kind of like

1179
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,780
ebb and flow with their symptoms they're

1180
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:15,359
not so sick

1181
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:18,180
the land of Alternative Health games is

1182
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:20,940
filled with many trendy options

1183
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:24,920
The Not So Sick have the freedom to play

1184
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:28,920
in this fairy tale land waffle about

1185
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:31,920
latch onto something of interest to tell

1186
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:33,900
others about and remain disconnected

1187
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:36,560
from the difference between being a not

1188
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:36,560
so sick person

1189
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:40,579
and being so sick

1190
00:48:41,579 --> 00:48:47,880
that last part is really incredible

1191
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:52,160
and remain disconnected from the

1192
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:52,160
difference between sick and not so sick

1193
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:55,920
since the not so sick who's waffling

1194
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:58,020
about in a little bit of Breath class

1195
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:01,079
and a little bit of workout class and a

1196
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:02,819
little bit of yoga class and try in a

1197
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:04,079
little bit of intermittent fasting and a

1198
00:49:02,819 --> 00:49:06,000
little bit of this and a little bit of

1199
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:08,040
that that person

1200
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:11,280
that not so sick person is completely

1201
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:12,720
disconnected between the difference of

1202
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:14,640
being a not so sick person like

1203
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:16,260
themselves or someone who's been through

1204
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:17,880
it all and they're really sick and

1205
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:20,579
they're chronically ill now the medical

1206
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:22,260
me in community is for The Chronic Leo

1207
00:49:20,579 --> 00:49:24,420
and yes it's for a not so sick person

1208
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:27,060
and yes it's for anybody who's feeling

1209
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:29,220
good and wants to come and partake in it

1210
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:31,140
but it's for the people who've been

1211
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:33,480
through hell and back it's real answers

1212
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:36,380
for the people to to have a chance to

1213
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:36,380
rise out of it

1214
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:43,380
being sick

1215
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:47,220
sick

1216
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:50,119
is an entirely different space

1217
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:52,440
the sick have left the realm of play

1218
00:49:50,119 --> 00:49:56,400
correct me if I'm wrong if I'm wrong

1219
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:58,579
tell me if I'm wrong then then my bad my

1220
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,579
bad

1221
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:04,980
the sick have left the realm of play

1222
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:06,900
you get too sick

1223
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:09,480
you leave the realm of play

1224
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:11,339
the sick are seasoned

1225
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:14,060
the sick have already done the

1226
00:50:11,339 --> 00:50:14,060
probiotics

chlorophyll the alkaline ionizer water

machines and dozens more the sick have

1241
00:50:56,099 --> 00:51:00,980
become seasoned too from visiting dozens

1242
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:05,180
of doctors and trying everything

1243
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:05,180
including fecal transplants

1244
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:11,400
I'm not telling you that you shouldn't

1245
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:12,720
do what your doctor wants you to do if

1246
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:14,220
your doctor wants you to do a fecal

1247
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:15,660
implant and that's what you're doing I'm

1248
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:20,119
not telling you different but I would

1249
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:20,119
never do it in a million freaking years

1250
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:26,339
I would never do it you think they can

1251
00:51:24,359 --> 00:51:27,720
actually figure out what viruses are in

1252
00:51:26,339 --> 00:51:29,160
somebody else's fecal they're not even

1253
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:30,660
looking for those viruses they don't

1254
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:32,040
even know what they look like

1255
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:34,020
and they're going to implant it in

1256
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:37,619
somebody else

1257
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:40,740
it's absurd it's insane

1258
00:51:37,619 --> 00:51:43,319
Saint Sue says so wait I'm confused

1259
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:45,599
again how does this ego shot relate to

1260
00:51:43,319 --> 00:51:47,280
the info with the not so six sorry my

1261
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:49,380
brain and neurons are not firing your

1262
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:51,599
brain and neurons firing because it's

1263
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:53,880
about also dealing with it all it's easy

1264
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:56,720
to get pushed off your healing path with

1265
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:56,720
all the misinformation

1266
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:02,760
and you can get thrown off track by

1267
00:52:00,359 --> 00:52:05,760
other people's egos because the not so

1268
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:07,619
sick tend to have some raging egos out

1269
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:09,420
there they think they found it all they

1270
00:52:07,619 --> 00:52:11,579
think they know it all they think that

1271
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:14,460
their little keto diet and their breath

1272
00:52:11,579 --> 00:52:16,200
class is why they're not sick they're

1273
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:18,540
not sick from other reasons they're just

1274
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:20,520
not sick yet their skill hasn't tipped

1275
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:22,680
it's to keep you unpa it's to keep you

1276
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:24,240
on path of the information because

1277
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:26,160
because if there's so much

1278
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:29,180
misinformation out there propelled by

1279
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:31,740
the ego based communities in health

1280
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:35,099
Alternative Health is one big huge ego

1281
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:37,200
out there it's a massive ego proportion

1282
00:52:35,099 --> 00:52:38,940
people don't even realize this is to

1283
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:42,540
help you stay true to yourself and keep

1284
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:45,660
you on track you can also

1285
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:47,339
um you can also give the the ego shot to

1286
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:51,319
your friends and so forth

1287
00:52:47,339 --> 00:52:51,319
but it's really fun anyway

1288
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:55,280
if that made sense at the end all right

1289
00:52:56,040 --> 00:53:00,599
the sick have become season two from

1290
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:05,359
visiting dozens of doctors and trying

1291
00:53:00,599 --> 00:53:05,359
everything including fecal transplants

1292
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:11,819
what a stupid experiment that is but if

1293
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,319
your doctor tells you do what your

1294
00:53:11,819 --> 00:53:15,059
doctor tells you I'm just saying but I

1295
00:53:13,319 --> 00:53:17,339
would never do it

1296
00:53:15,059 --> 00:53:21,540
bee sting therapy

1297
00:53:17,339 --> 00:53:24,359

1300
00:53:25,859 --> 00:53:28,920
in this moment

1301
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:31,440
but yeah

1302
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:33,420
all the all the the bee sting therapy is

1303
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,800
is used is self-medicating with your own

1304
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:36,599
adrenaline because your body's in a

1305
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:39,780
cytokine storm because you've got a bee

1306
00:53:36,599 --> 00:53:44,339
sting it's really a bad therapy

1307
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:49,339

00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:08,400
page 578 brain saver

1357
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:11,960
Sonia says um what page are you reading

1358
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,960
from oh my God information

1359
00:56:12,059 --> 00:56:16,260
Terry Appleman says I have no idea

1360
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:18,540
people didn't really know anything about

1361
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:22,280
why I was sick until everything let me

1362
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:22,280
down and I ended up sicker than ever

1363
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:26,059
bless your heart

1364
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:32,099
so it feels like you just it feels like

1365
00:56:30,359 --> 00:56:35,700
you just

1366
00:56:32,099 --> 00:56:37,380
landed in a tropical Paradise when you

1367
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:39,839
first when you first get a sim number

1368
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:42,059
two and you see there's a Panacea of

1369
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:43,740
alternative therapies everywhere and

1370
00:56:42,059 --> 00:56:45,660
they all seem to make so much sense

1371
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:48,300
because the people talking about the

1372
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:50,220
alternative therapies are so smart and

1373
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:52,500
it seems so smart

1374
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:54,480
even though it doesn't if you really

1375
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:55,920
crack it a coffee enema is the worst

1376
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:57,839
thing that you can do to your adrenals

1377
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:00,920
in your liver but nobody does it's like

1378
00:56:57,839 --> 00:57:00,920
it's crazy right

1379
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:04,859
did not so sick people when they get

1380
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:06,660
their first symptoms May believe the

1381
00:57:04,859 --> 00:57:08,880
health world is their oyster as they

1382
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:10,800
stumble across remedy after remedy with

1383
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:12,599
confident practitioners who haven't gone

1384
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:14,880
through a major Health crisis themselves

1385
00:57:12,599 --> 00:57:16,740
and that's another problem

1386
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:21,140
if I ever get sick

1387
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:21,140
if I ever get sick

1388
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:28,520
and I need the help of a health care

1389
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,520
provider

1390
00:57:29,339 --> 00:57:32,280
I want to make sure that healthcare

1391
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:34,980
provider

1392
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:36,839
was really sick

1393
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:38,460
really sick

1394
00:57:36,839 --> 00:57:40,500
hands and knees

1395
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:42,900
praying to God

1396
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:45,180
not knowing what the hell's up or down

1397
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:47,880
been through hell and back

1398
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:49,140
burned to the ground rose out of the

1399
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:51,480
ashes

1400
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:53,700
and was back practicing

1401
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:56,400
that's the healthcare provider that I

1402
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:59,160
would want me personally

1403
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:00,660
I mean but I'm not saying keep your

1404
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:02,339
health care providers don't look for

1405
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:04,940
that if you got a good one I'm just

1406
00:58:02,339 --> 00:58:08,040
saying that's what I would want

1407
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:10,440
the search for a way to heal starts at

1408
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:12,540
the most basic tier the sicker you get

1409
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:14,460
the more you've sifted through what's

1410
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:17,520
offered out there

1411
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:20,700
there's tears the sicker you get the

1412
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:22,740
more the right the more you sift it

1413
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:25,140
through the sicker you get the more you

1414
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:26,579
sift it through the not so sick many

1415
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:29,160
times the not so sick we're talking

1416
00:58:26,579 --> 00:58:32,420
about now think it's impossible for them

1417
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:34,800
to ever get sick with a chronic illness

1418
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:38,480
I can't tell you how many times I've

1419
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:38,480
seen that the not so sick

1420
00:58:38,819 --> 00:58:43,920
thinking it's impossible for them to get

1421
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:46,079
any sicker to get sick with a chronic

1422
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:47,760
illness they will never believe they can

1423
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:49,740
get sick with a chronic illness and not

1424
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:52,020
so sick

1425
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:54,240
they don't want to think they could ever

1426
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:56,059
get there because that's frightening and

1427
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:58,260
their health approach must be the answer

1428
00:58:56,059 --> 00:59:00,540
the health world is so full of

1429
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:02,940
misinformation I like this shot to keep

1430
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:04,859
us on the humble path keeping true to

1431
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:07,619
ourselves and able to access our soul

1432
00:59:04,859 --> 00:59:09,240
and not the brainwashing we've received

1433
00:59:07,619 --> 00:59:12,000
down here our subconscious and

1434
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:14,040
Consciousness can be brainwashed we want

1435
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,960
to access our soul knowledge the ego

1436
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:17,880
shift is really helpful in general for

1437
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:20,420
all this stuff not just this with this

1438
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:20,420
but just everything

1439
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:29,520
the not so sick people don't want to

1440
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:30,900
think that they could ever get sick

1441
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:32,760
because it's frightening and their

1442
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:34,619
health approach must be the answer of

1443
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:36,420
course they're still doing their

1444
00:59:34,619 --> 00:59:39,119
workouts so it should be fine they're

1445
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:40,740
still able to work out

1446
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:43,680
they're still having their cheat days

1447
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:46,400
right the not so sick still want to have

1448
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:46,400
their cheat days

1449
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:51,599
and they want to be quick to call

1450
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:53,460
somebody orthorexic oh you're taking

1451
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:55,440
care of yourself too much oh you're

1452
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:58,920
orthorexic I noticed that the not so

1453
00:59:55,440 --> 01:00:01,880
sick people that's a Telltale sign

1454
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:01,880
right there

1455
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:07,559
that if a not so sick person's claiming

1456
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:10,140
they're really sick

1457
01:00:07,559 --> 01:00:11,640
or they've been really sick and now

1458
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:14,940
they're a coach a health coach or a

1459
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:17,160
practitioner or whatever if a if a this

1460
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:18,540
is proof If a person claims they were

1461
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:20,579
really sick with some kind of

1462
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:22,799
life-threatening disease they were

1463
01:00:20,579 --> 01:00:26,220
really down in in the in the depths of

1464
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:28,440
hell and they crawl out of it they claim

1465
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:30,540
and then they say

1466
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:33,480
that if you're eating that way or this

1467
01:00:30,540 --> 01:00:35,940
way you're orthorexic or that

1468
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:37,440
and men can make you orthorexic or that

1469
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:39,119
whatever then they were never really

1470
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:42,319
that sick it's it's

1471
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:42,319
shines a light

1472
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:45,740
because you know

1473
01:00:46,859 --> 01:00:51,740
it shines the light because when you're

1474
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:51,740
really really sick

1475
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:56,220
you would never

1476
01:00:54,059 --> 01:00:59,240
call anybody orthorexic when they're

1477
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:59,240
taking care of themselves

1478
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:06,180
and they notice throughout the years I

1479
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:07,920
see this all the time

1480
01:01:06,180 --> 01:01:09,420
it's so strange

1481
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:11,400
see the minute you start taking care of

1482
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:13,500
yourself and eating better and all this

1483
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:15,839
stuff then someone pops up and says oh

1484
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:17,819
you have orthorexia or your orthorexic

1485
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:19,680
it's like are you kidding just because I

1486
01:01:17,819 --> 01:01:22,640
want to live and I want to heal and I

1487
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:22,640
want to do the right things

1488
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:29,460
they have their cheat days they feel

1489
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:31,500
like they're keeping balanced practicing

1490
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:33,960
moderation intuitively living their

1491
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:36,359
lives they believe that person who's

1492
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:38,339
really sick that's not me that's not

1493
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:42,240
going to be me I'm never going to get

1494
01:01:38,339 --> 01:01:44,400
sick I'm just gonna be where I am

1495
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:46,440
then when you come across then when you

1496
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:48,299
cross the threshold to being very sick

1497
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:50,880
Everything Changes

1498
01:01:48,299 --> 01:01:53,160
it's a different world

1499
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:55,500
one of survival

1500
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:58,859
your goals are different from the goals

1501
01:01:55,500 --> 01:02:00,059
of the Not So Sick Things change in your

1502
01:01:58,859 --> 01:02:02,760
life

1503
01:02:00,059 --> 01:02:04,440
even relationships can change it's a

1504
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:07,020
whole other world of understanding

1505
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:09,359
Health what I'm trying to say is

1506
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:10,500
if you pass the point of just being not

1507
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:12,720
so sick

1508
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:16,500
into the land of sick at some point in

1509
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:18,900
your life then you know things change

1510
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:22,680
your perspective the world changes

1511
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:26,400
you're humbled your ego gets kicked down

1512
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:28,920
that's why I'm talking about this too

1513
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:30,660
your ego gets kicked down someone asks

1514
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:33,599
what about chlorella make sure you grab

1515
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:35,700
the macrobium brain saber books and read

1516
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:39,619
about chlorella in the books to know

1517
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:39,619
what to be worried about with it

1518
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:46,380
all right guys

1519
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:46,380
I'm gonna pop along to

1520
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:57,839
I'm gonna pop along to this we're doing

1521
01:02:55,799 --> 01:03:00,799
the ego shifter I want to read a little

1522
01:02:57,839 --> 01:03:00,799
bit about that okay

1523
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:08,460
here we are

1524
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:09,599
it's a big book you can flip around in

1525
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:11,400
it forever

1526
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:13,579
anyway that's the ego shifter right

1527
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:13,579
there

1528
01:03:13,619 --> 01:03:18,540
this shot is ideal and those moments

1529
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:20,460
when you feel like your ego has taken

1530
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:24,480
over your senses

1531
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:27,180
or your Common Sense and Sensibility

1532
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:28,980
there's a moment in all of our Lives

1533
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:31,440
when we

1534
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:33,780
can feel it's not just confidence we're

1535
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:35,640
working with but our ego is kind of

1536
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:38,819
taking over

1537
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:40,619
there's a sense that it's there in the

1538
01:03:38,819 --> 01:03:42,660
background

1539
01:03:40,619 --> 01:03:45,260
so there's ego and then there's

1540
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:45,260
confidence

1541
01:03:45,299 --> 01:03:50,339
they're two different things

1542
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:52,619
and they can get mixed up

1543
01:03:50,339 --> 01:03:55,380
someone can be really confident

1544
01:03:52,619 --> 01:03:58,380
but their ego is

1545
01:03:55,380 --> 01:04:00,240
kind of behind it all

1546
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:02,339
and that's a great time to take the ego

1547
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:06,240
shifter you want the confidence you want

1548
01:04:02,339 --> 01:04:07,799
the ego to kind of chill and drop

1549
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:09,480
so you can take the shot when you feel

1550
01:04:07,799 --> 01:04:11,220
like your ego has taken over your senses

1551
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:13,559
or your Common Sense and Sensibility

1552
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:15,660
take this shot if you feel like you're

1553
01:04:13,559 --> 01:04:17,700
losing your true self

1554
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:19,319
losing sight of what's truly important

1555
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:21,780
so even if you don't think it's ego

1556
01:04:19,319 --> 01:04:23,819
related on any level

1557
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:26,819
that's what's incredible about this ego

1558
01:04:23,819 --> 01:04:28,440
shifter forget ego just move that aside

1559
01:04:26,819 --> 01:04:30,059
for a second right

1560
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:32,220
taking this shot when you feel like

1561
01:04:30,059 --> 01:04:34,920
you're losing your true self

1562
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:37,200
that's interesting because ego can play

1563
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:39,839
a role in pushing out your true self

1564
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:42,839
right the ego can actually

1565
01:04:39,839 --> 01:04:44,700
push and Propel your true self out so

1566
01:04:42,839 --> 01:04:46,619
that's a great time to do it

1567
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:50,900
take this shot if you feel like you may

1568
01:04:46,619 --> 01:04:50,900
have been a little too self-absorbed

1569
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:56,400
you know when I think about

1570
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:58,500
self-absorbed

1571
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:59,940
oh like I don't see

1572
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:01,980
a huge part of the medical meme

1573
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:03,299
Community being self-absorbed not at all

1574
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:05,720
you guys are working on your healing

1575
01:05:03,299 --> 01:05:09,059
process you're working hard

1576
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:11,099
self-absorbed is kind of another thing

1577
01:05:09,059 --> 01:05:12,780
that a lot that people do out there they

1578
01:05:11,099 --> 01:05:14,220
get really self-absorbed that's

1579
01:05:12,780 --> 01:05:16,200
something that's a time to do the ego

1580
01:05:14,220 --> 01:05:17,940
shifter

1581
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:19,980
you that's when you're kind of losing

1582
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:23,520
sight you're so self-absorbed you're

1583
01:05:19,980 --> 01:05:25,559
losing sight of other people's pain and

1584
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:29,640
suffering you're losing sight of what's

1585
01:05:25,559 --> 01:05:32,099
around you you know you lose that vision

1586
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:34,400
try this shot

1587
01:05:32,099 --> 01:05:38,900
if you realize you've been completely

1588
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:38,900
self-consumed without caring for others

1589
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:42,299
even if you don't have the ability to

1590
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:43,799
care for others because you don't have

1591
01:05:42,299 --> 01:05:45,720
that ability

1592
01:05:43,799 --> 01:05:48,299
or strength

1593
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:50,220
if you just don't care at all that's a

1594
01:05:48,299 --> 01:05:51,960
good time to take the ego shifter

1595
01:05:50,220 --> 01:05:53,940
use this shot if you feel as if

1596
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:55,619
something inside of you is controlling

1597
01:05:53,940 --> 01:06:00,200
your life

1598
01:05:55,619 --> 01:06:02,819
and decisions while you watch from above

1599
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:05,040
whoa you know when Spirit of compassion

1600

put that in here

1601
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:07,819

01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:13,799
I mean seriously I was blown off my seat

1603
01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:17,359

1604
01:06:13,799 --> 01:06:17,359
is controlling your life

1605
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:21,180
and decisions

1606
01:06:19,619 --> 01:06:23,160
something inside of you is controlling

1607
01:06:21,180 --> 01:06:26,520
your decisions while you watch from

kind of watched it from above like why

1612
01:06:32,579 --> 01:06:35,240
would I do that

1613
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:40,799
try this shot if you have a friend or

1614
01:06:37,799 --> 01:06:43,020
loved one who has a very large ego do

1615
01:06:40,799 --> 01:06:45,480
you guys know anybody who has a big ego

1616
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:48,059
besides

1617
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:49,920
besides aw just kidding

1618
01:06:48,059 --> 01:06:52,799
do you do you have do you know anybody

1619
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:54,960
who has a very large ego

1620
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:56,880
and doesn't believe

1621
01:06:54,960 --> 01:07:00,200
they do

1622
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:00,200
they don't believe they do

1623
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:05,299
everybody has an ego

1624
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:13,020
how about this one take this shot if you

1625
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:15,240
feel you need to take control of your

1626
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:17,460
life and override

1627
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:19,380
the drive to harm yourself

1628
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:22,260
so there's there's a lot of people out

1629
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:24,740
there that they have this drive to harm

1630
01:07:22,260 --> 01:07:24,740
themselves

1631
01:07:26,220 --> 01:07:30,539
toxic heavy metals play a role the ego

1632
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:33,079
shifter has something in it to shift and

1633
01:07:30,539 --> 01:07:33,079
rewire

1634
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:37,859
try this ego shifter if you need to Free

1635
01:07:36,359 --> 01:07:42,359
Yourself

1636
01:07:37,859 --> 01:07:47,119
so your authentic Soul shines through

1637
01:07:42,359 --> 01:07:47,119
and benefits you and the ones around you

1638
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:52,200
we also get brain let me just say this

1639
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:54,480
we also get brainwashed in harming

1640
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:56,039
ourselves too without even realizing it

1641
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:57,599
like that's another thing too

1642
01:07:56,039 --> 01:08:00,180
conditioning

1643
01:07:57,599 --> 01:08:03,859
so planet Earth

1644
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:07,559
has a way of conditioning people's minds

1645
01:08:03,859 --> 01:08:09,420
brainwashing their minds

1646
01:08:07,559 --> 01:08:13,020
so they harm themselves without even

1647
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:16,280
realizing it and they don't even realize

1648
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:16,280
that's what's happening

1649
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:25,580
anyway let's make the ego shifter

1650
01:08:33,020 --> 01:08:36,380
Let's Roll

1651
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:45,900
got the Medicine maker here

1652
01:08:43,859 --> 01:08:47,640
and let's crank it up but it got some

1653
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:49,580
comments I'd like to read real quick if

01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:08,219
mind from an sad lifestyle

1660
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:10,259
lost spouse to chemo 13 years ago and

1668
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:29,160
I know we have some silent Watchers out

1669
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:32,239
there and

1670
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:32,239
I'm honored

1671
01:09:32,699 --> 01:09:37,679
Elvis lives thank goodness Anthony

1672
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:40,560
invented the term mattress Island just

1673
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:43,020
having that term at our disposal makes

1674
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:44,940
us feel we are not so nuts and also

1675
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:47,819
helps convey to others what we're going

1676
01:09:44,940 --> 01:09:50,580
through and Elvis lives make no mistake

1677
01:09:47,819 --> 01:09:51,719
mattress Island will be stolen and

1678
01:09:50,580 --> 01:09:54,179
talked about in the other health

1679
01:09:51,719 --> 01:09:57,140
communities while they never cite or

1680
01:09:54,179 --> 01:10:00,060
mention mm

1681
01:09:57,140 --> 01:10:02,460
so no one will be able to get all the

1682
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:03,840
information to get them off of mattress

1683
01:10:02,460 --> 01:10:05,520
Island

1684
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:08,160
they'll know the term mattress Island

1685
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:10,380
but they won't have what it takes the

1686
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:12,000
information to get them off of mattress

1687
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:13,980
Island

1688
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:16,739
which is a very good point half time

1689
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:19,280

1690
01:10:16,739 --> 01:10:19,280

01:11:45,420 --> 01:11:50,520
Beatrice

interesting

1716
01:11:52,739 --> 01:11:57,060
um I don't think Dr Nesbitt Beatrice is

1717
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:58,380
going to like that because they don't

1718
01:11:57,060 --> 01:12:00,960
think they're funny

1719
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:04,199
they were really looking for guidance

1720
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:06,239
and counseling so now that we're all

1721
01:12:04,199 --> 01:12:07,260
laughing at Beatrice and Dr Harris but I

1722
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:11,040

everything
