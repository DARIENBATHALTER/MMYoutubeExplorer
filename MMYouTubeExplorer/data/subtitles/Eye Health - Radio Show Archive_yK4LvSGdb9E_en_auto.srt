11
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,679

12
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:30,679

14
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:35,399
said to me well you know I was told it

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,000
was my body attacking itself so I was

16
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:40,600
convinced my body was working against me

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,559
all those years and it was something I

18
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,480
never forgot every morning I woke up

19
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:47,719

00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:56,600
go to attack itself like is there more

23
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,440
damage being done um is something being

24
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,800
done about it and it was just nothing

25
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:05,080
but but fear and worry for 20 years and

26
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:07,240
I felt terrible I felt terrible that

27
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,759

32
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,159
real cause of Hashimoto thyroiditis

33
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,479

that the body doesn't attack itself so

45
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,119
so when I mean 10 20 30 years ahead of

46
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:53,680
what's B basically what's out there and

47
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,399
do you have 10 20 30 years to wait to

48
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,880
have answers I'm serious Spirit serious

49
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,520
about this now it's no joke when someone

50
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,759
actually has to go through through that

51
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:05,159
have you gone through that at all

52
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:06,719
because a lot of people are so this

53
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,599
person was like you know I'm relieved to

54
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,720
know that my body is actually defending

55
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,239
itself it's defending itself against a

56
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,640
pathogen called Epstein bar that's what

57
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:17,239
enters into the thyroid causing

58
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,239
Hashimoto's thyroiditis and this

59
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:21,000
person's like thank God I know now and

60
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:22,760
now I can do something about it I could

61
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,879
take care of myself I could knock out

62
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,560
the Epstein bar I could work on healing

63
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,800
I can move forward I can get past this I

64
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,120
can get off a thyroid medication I could

65
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,640
move past all of this and and and most

66
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:37,160
importantly I know that my body is not

67
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,040
attacking itself that was just told to

68
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,800
me because no one had answers so the

69
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,159
blame had to go on the person's body

70
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,120

talking about Eye Health today so you

159
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:07,560
know when it comes down to eyes it

160
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,919
really comes down to antioxidants that's

161
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,520
where that word matters antioxidants

162
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:14,840
what's an antioxidant really it's a

163
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:17,720
phytochemical a group of phytochemicals

164
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:19,680
that actually stop you from dying that's

165
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,720
what they do they stop you from dying

166
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:26,160
they stop you from

167
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:28,319
aging they stop you from from

168
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,440
deteriorating that's what antioxidants

169
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:34,960
do think about that you know because

170
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:37,280
what do we do we oxidize we oxidize like

171
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:40,360
things do like things

172
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:44,680
oxidize like metal

173
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:46,520
oxidizes like a car gets Rusty well

174
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,000
right now cars are made out of plastic I

175
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:50,160
don't know what else they're made out of

176
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,880
now I think they're made out of plastic

177
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,319
and they're made out of what

178
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:56,800
fiberglass um you know paper mâché I

179
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:59,680
don't know what they're made out of Now

180
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,120
cars but it used to be made out out of

181
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,440
actual metal and you get a ding and then

182
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,000
it would start rusting uh I don't know

183
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,000
if you guys remember that does that date

184
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,199
me or

185
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:14,319
something bring me back too far but um

186
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,759
so so that oxidizing so right when water

187
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:19,000
would touch that open exposed metal or

188
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:22,160
that carbon steel or whatever it is you

189
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:26,280
know bam you know oxidizing would happen

190
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:30,400
rust well we rust we actually rust we

191
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:32,919
oxidize we fall apart we dissolve and

192
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,199
that's what happens here when we're

193
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:38,199
exposed to free radicals millions of

194
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:40,080
free radicals pesticides pollutants

195
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:42,080
chemicals there's crap falling out of

196
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,840
the sky right now I mean and I'm not

197
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,800
trying to put us into fear it's it's

198
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,639
it's why I wrote the life-changing Foods

199
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,440
book of that book The the subtitle to

200
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,319
that book is save yourself and the ones

201
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:54,319
you love with the hidden healing powers

202
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,639
of fruits vegetables orb spices and wild

203
00:07:54,319 --> 00:08:00,400
Foods there's a reason for that because

204
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:02,840
we can use our food to stop stop us from

205
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,360
from oxidizing regardless of what kind

206
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,879
of crap is floating out of the sky

207
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,400
regardless of radiation that's still

208
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:12,039
floating out of the sky from World War

209
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:14,599
II you know from Hiroshima literally not

210
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:16,080
even a fraction of radiation has fallen

211
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:18,159
out of the sky from hoshima it's still

212
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,199
floating up there we haven't even it the

213
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:22,680
Fallout hasn't even happened never mind

214
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:25,520
Fukushima hasn't even happened yet it's

215
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,680
just starting to rain on it so so what

216
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,720
can we do we can totally battle that we

217
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,319
can totally adapt to that we can totally

218
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,440
rise above that and that's what I

219
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:35,360
explain in life-changing Foods never

220
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,680
been done before the information I put

221
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,080
in there from Spirit to actually protect

222
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:43,360
us and our families and our children

223
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,880
with Foods information about Foods never

224
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,959
talked about ever before I made sure are

225
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,839
in that book I didn't care what it took

226
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:51,320
to write that book I didn't care what it

227
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,480
took how many hours I had to stay up

228
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,920
late how much sleep I lost I didn't care

229
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:58,279
how crappy I felt I didn't care that

230
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:01,680
book had to get done because I need

231
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:03,600
everybody to have that and so when we

232
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,200
talk about antioxidants that's a big

233
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,560
part of what's in the book too when we

234
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,480
talk about antibi

235
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:12,680
antioxidants okay I was going to say

236
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:15,640
something antibiotics actually really

237
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:17,040
oxidize us they really oxidize us I was

238
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,040
jumping ahead I was going to talk about

239
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,560
that a little later so we take

240
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:24,399
antibiotics for different things that

241
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:27,040
quickens the oxidizing phase our organs

242
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:29,640
start to oxidize our liver oxidizes so

243
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:34,720
if we had antibiotics in us going all

244
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:37,839
the way back we need a lot of

245
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,560
antioxidants a lot of antioxidants more

246
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:44,079
antibiotics you've used the more

247
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:47,279
antioxidants you need on every way shape

248
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:50,000
and form and and so that that's that's

249
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:52,360
what matters and I talk about in

250
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,040
previous shows about the 80,000 meals if

251
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:58,480
you've had 40,000 crappy meals or 40,000

252
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,959
not healthy meals or 40,000 uh you

253
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,079
nonuse full

254
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:05,200
meals um if you've had that you know

255
00:10:03,079 --> 00:10:07,399
then we need to make up we need make up

256
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,360
time because or if you've had 20,000

257
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:12,920
meals in your lifetime depending on how

258
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:15,000
old you are now we need to make up all

259
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,800
that and take this serious and get some

260
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,079
good meals in us and we can do it we're

261
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,279
going to talk about different foods

262
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:24,279
today um as well so when it comes down

263
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:26,760
to Eye Health eyes are affected by

264
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:29,560
oxidizing by things oxidizing in our

265
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:31,880
body heavy metals oxidizing in our body

266
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,760
pesticides oxidizing our body stuff

267
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:37,200
falling out of the sky you name it

268
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:40,000
coming out of there and um and just just

269
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,560
sprinkles on down literally just every

270
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,880
day and that's okay we can adapt above

271
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:49,480
it we can totally live in it without it

272
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:52,160
affecting us if we protect ourselves Eye

273
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:55,399
Health matters a lot because if we have

274
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:57,200
any kind of eye issues um it's related

275
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:59,279
to deficiencies it's related to

276
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,839
antioxidants it's related to weight too

277
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,360
many free radicals basically just

278
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:06,079
poisons floating around in the body

279
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:07,959
having their day and so we're going to

280
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:11,760
cover different aspects of our health so

281
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:13,839
that we can protect our eyes so it's a

282
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:17,680
big deal when it comes down fruits

283
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:21,240
vegetables herbs you know spices wild

284
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:24,000
Foods this is what we need for our eyes

285
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:27,480
that's what matters you know we always

286
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,480
talk about the color of our eyes right

287
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,440
isn't that what it's all about what's on

288
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,240
your driver's license is say eye color

289
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,920
on there you got brown color eyes you

290
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:39,079
got blue you got green um so yeah it

291
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,800
it's all about eye color and then you

292
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:42,519
meet somebody and you're like oh my God

293
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,360
look at your eyes look how look how

294
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:47,279
amazing the color of your eyes are and

295
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:51,120
it's all about eye color and when it

296
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:54,000
comes down to um when it comes down to

297
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,040
that very like term you know what's the

298
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,560
color of your eyes we need to flip it to

299
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,720
what's the color of your food what's the

300
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,079
color of of your food that's what we

301
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,880
need to do what's what kind of what food

302
00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:07,320
are you eating that has color in it of

303
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,839
any kind and this is one of the most

304
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,680
important aspects of Eye Health is

305
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,199
what's what kind of colors are you

306
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,800
actually eating and we know that we know

307
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:17,760
colors that's already been going out

308
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:22,040
that that round that information is is

309
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:24,800
not specifically new um so but but

310
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:27,480
colors matter so it's those pigments

311
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:30,800
it's it's that it's that color in the

312
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,440
food that lines up to the eyes in a lot

313
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:36,320
of ways because what's in that color

314
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:37,079
lots of antioxidants so the blue skin of

315
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,360
a

316
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:41,480
blueberry that blue skin in that

317
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,880
blueberry that's packed with

318
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:46,880
antioxidants and that is incredible for

319
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,320
the eyes right there that's a big deal

320
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:53,160
so that's the antioxidants we need now

321
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:57,480
if it's a wild blueberry it's blue all

322
00:12:53,160 --> 00:13:01,800
the way through blue all the way through

323
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:05,760
if it's a weak cultivated blueberry it's

324
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:09,120
white and clear in the center with a

325
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:11,040
blue skin so now that's fine if you it's

326
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,880
all you got so if that's all you got is

327
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,000
that clamshell that little pint-sized

328
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,120
clamshell that you find at the uh the

329
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,680
health food store or the protu section

330
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,199
and it's the cultivated blueberry It's a

331
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,800
larger blueberry and it's kind of white

332
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:23,199
and clear inside and that's all you got

333
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,360
it's still good for you it's still going

334
00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:26,839
to help it's still going to help in some

335
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,360
ways with your eyes but you want to look

336
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:30,720
for that wild blueberry

337
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,480
you know people say to me you just love

338
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,160
the wild blueberry I go how can I not

339
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,839
love the most powerful food on the

340
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,399
planet that literally can stop any

341
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:40,480
disease and symptom that's going on in

342
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:43,600
our lives how can I am I supposed to

343
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:46,360
stop talking about the wild

344
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,120
blueberry am am I I'm supposed to be

345
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,600
done okay I talked about it one time

346
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:54,199
that's it no it's that

347
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:56,639
important and it's blue all the way

348
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:59,720
through all the way through purple and

349
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:02,320
blue all the way through and so that's

350
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:04,040
what I'm talking about when it comes

351
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,480
down to Eye Health right there that

352
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:09,720
example Alone um in life-changing Foods

353
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:11,839
I really Lay It lay it out about what

354
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,560
the wild blueberry does for our bodies

355
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:17,279
and what it does for our soul and

356
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:19,320
everything and the power of it and um

357
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,560
because it's it's a lot to talk about in

358
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,959
in just one show it literally could take

359
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,720
over one show the wild blueberry so it

360
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:27,320
comes down to Colors just like we're

361
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,839
always focused on the color of our eyes

362
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,560
hey you got green eyes wao they're so

363
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:34,720
pretty or you got you know blue eyes

364
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:38,120
look at that or whatever it is it's it

365
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:40,880
should be like hey wow that food has

366
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:44,320
that color who look at the color of that

367
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:46,920
food and and that matters because that's

368
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,759
antioxidants and it matters now okay

369
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:51,120
fine now there's there's something else

370
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:53,240
you have to understand the inside of

371
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,480
food that doesn't have a lot of color we

372
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:59,360
don't want to negate that on any level

373
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,040
so the inside of a radish is white

374
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,040
but that doesn't mean something else

375
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,920
special isn't in there okay so that

376
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,199
doesn't mean that something else isn't

377
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,440
really special in there so always

378
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:11,639
remember that so foods that have white

379
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,320
to them or clear to them still have

380
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:16,000
something in them they have minerals

381
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,240
they have minerals that's the other

382
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,600
aspect of your eyes color Okay color

383
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:23,079
matters with the food that's one thing

384
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:27,279
that we got to connect to the eyes

385
00:15:23,079 --> 00:15:30,040
that's critical and the other one is you

386
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:32,199
know is that the mineral composition so

387
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:34,519
it's antioxidants with color and then

388
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:35,959
it's the mineral composition these are

389
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:39,240
the two things that we have to use for

390
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:41,120
our eyes and this is critical we're

391
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,560
going to talk about different facets of

392
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,759
what's going on people's eyes we're

393
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,880
going to get into that we're going to

394
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:49,399
get into the nitty-gritty there um so

395
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,600
because what happens is when you get

396
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:53,839
inside of food when you get inside of

397
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,560
food you got chromium in there you got

398
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:58,160
selenium in there you got manganese in

399
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:00,519
there you got M mbum you got in there

400
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,600
you got uh you got you know a little bit

401
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:04,639
of zinc zinc is a hard one it's hard to

402
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,880
get zinc and food no matter where we

403
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:10,600
really search but there's still traces

404
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:12,480
left in some foods so either way it's

405
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,959
the mineral composition too in these

406
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,519
foods that are so important so

407
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:21,839
understand that remember that

408
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:24,160
um so let's talk about like some eye

409
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:26,639
symptoms and eye conditions you guys

410
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,240
ready for that I figure someone out

411
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,360
there has an eye problem in some way

412
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,920
some shape or some

413
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:36,199
form let's talk about

414
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:38,199
blurriness blurriness of the eyes now

415
00:16:36,199 --> 00:16:40,639
here's here's the deal with blurriness

416
00:16:38,199 --> 00:16:43,040
it's complicated it's complicated

417
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:45,720
because everybody's blurriness is

418
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,800
different it's different someone else's

419
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:50,000
blurry eyes isn't someone else's blurry

420
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:52,319
eyes that it's entirely a different

421
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,600
thing going on there's other there a

422
00:16:52,319 --> 00:16:57,639
whole bunch of reasons why we have

423
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:59,480
blurry eyes and let's explore some of it

424
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:02,480
uh eyes are so complicated we're just

425
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:05,079
going to get what we can get done so for

426
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:08,199
example one person could have blurry

427
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:10,039
eyes caused by macular

428
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:12,120
degeneration okay so macular

429
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:14,919
degeneration you guys know that one did

430
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:16,919
you go to the eye doctor and like hey I

431
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:19,839
the eye doctors like I see some

432
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:22,240
degeneration in here we get we got some

433
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,760
problems um so maybe you're one that's

434
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,400
been going through that or you you've

435
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:30,640
been through that see now macular

436
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:33,640
degeneration is first of all is an

437
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,559
antioxidant deficiency and a mineral

438
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:38,080
deficiency it's an antioxidant

439
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:39,280
deficiency and a mineral deficiency you

440
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,200
have to know that about Immaculate

441
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,799
degeneration it's it's it's not

442
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,919
technically like uh it's not like other

443
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:48,880
things that go wrong with eyes it's

444
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:52,000
really just for the first 10 years of

445
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,960
your life you had just food that had

446
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,440
really nothing in it first 20 years of

447
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,720
your life you might have food that's had

448
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,240
nothing in it first 30 years of your

449
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:03,440
life um I always kid around and say you

450
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:05,880
know people eat fruit when it's on their

451
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,080
Strawberry Shortcake so they have

452
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:10,080
strawberries when it's on Strawberry

453
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:13,120
Shortcake they eat blueberries when it's

454
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:16,640
in a pancake they eat blueberries when

455
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:18,559
it's in a muffin you know I remember um

456
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,880
years ago a friend of mine was like look

457
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,840
I eat a lot of blueberries I was like

458
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,200
well where are you getting them and my

459
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,440
friend says well I have a blueberry

460
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,080
muffin every morning I I I couldn't

461
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,880
believe it yeah first of all I laughed

462
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,720
you know I had a good laugh which is

463
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,240
probably maybe that's not the the best

464
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:36,200
thing that that I could have done for

465
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:38,559
support but it was the first thing I did

466
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:41,480
anyway I couldn't help it I I do tend to

467
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:44,799
laugh a lot but the point is is that you

468
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:46,280
know he really thought that all the all

469
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,720
the blueberries and a blueberry muffin

470
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,000

blueberries there's actually fake

480
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:07,640
blueberries they're actually fake

481
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,840
they're made out of some kind of like uh

482
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:13,679
jelly and some kind of um um some kind

483
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:16,320
of gelatinous stuff that's dyed blue and

484
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:19,039
flavored blue so anyway so he was

hunk of our life without getting enough

507
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:14,200
antioxidants we can go through a hunk of

508
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:17,360
our life without getting what we need

everything everybody I'm proud of

532
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,760
everybody because you know we all got

533
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,360
different circumstances and we got to

534
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,799
just do the best we can and eat when we

535
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:08,960
can and eat what we can get what we can

536
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:11,000
I I I understand the whole situation um

537
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,080
so blurriness of the eyes so say we got

538
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,799
Mac degeneration that's like a

539
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:20,520
historic piece of your life that's

540
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:23,440
that's missing something or or basically

541
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:25,799
it's history in your life with all these

542
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,720
missing pieces and these Miss missing

543
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:29,320
pieces are antioxidants at all these

544
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:32,360
different times in your lives and

545
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:33,640
minerals minerals from foods that you

546
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:37,159
know they're mineral

547
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:39,320
rich and that comes from fruits

548
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:42,240
vegetables herb

549
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:46,799
spices uh and wild Foods that's where it

550
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:49,159
comes from it comes from there so we're

551
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:51,240
going to you know and and that's the

552
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:53,840
whole thing that's that's where it comes

553
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:55,600
from and um and like I talk about

554
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,360
life-changing Foods I talk about every

555
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:02,480
disease and illness literally a fruit or

556
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:05,480
a vegetable herb spice can help

557
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,520
reverse um all right so immaculate

558
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,520
degeneration it's about antioxidants

559
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,960
what do we need to do we're going to

560
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,279
talk about foods to help that a little

561
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,039
later on we're going to talk about

562
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:15,080
supplements to help that a little later

563
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:17,279
on but that's one form of blurriness you

564
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:20,960
guys that's one form of

565
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:25,080
blurriness and then what about another

566
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:27,600
form of blurry vision that's different

567
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:29,840
that that isn't the same thing and you

568
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,960
know the doctor's look you go to the

569
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,600
doctor the eye doctor you say hey look

570
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:35,159
you know I got these blurry eyes I don't

571
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,960
know what's going on here is it my

572
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:39,440
prescription do I need

573
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,880
glasses and the eye doctor looks and the

574
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,559
eye doctor says say you have

575
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,360
prescriptions anyway the eye doctor says

576
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:47,120
well your prescriptions are fine they ly

577
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:48,960
up um you have no macular degeneration

578
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,840
you got no glaucoma you got nothing else

579
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:54,279
going on I don't know why you have

580
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:57,039
blurry eyes the mystery blurry eyes okay

581
00:22:54,279 --> 00:22:59,039
that's neurological that's neurological

582
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:00,559
that's central nervous system so mystery

583
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,880
blur eyes is a central nervous system

584
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:03,360
and if anybody dealing with it's going

585
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,279
to they're going to know that it gets a

586
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,880
little better in the morning okay so

587
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:08,640
when they wake up the morning they might

588
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,320
be a little blurry at first for a few

589
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,600
minutes but when they Shake It Off and

590
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,840
and get out of their tiredness and

591
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,120
everything else their eyes are more

592
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,640
clear and then towards the end of the

593
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,919
day they just get more blurry by night

594
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:20,279
time they get blurry blurry and they're

595
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:22,279
just totally blurry and that's ner

596
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:23,559
that's the central nervous system that's

597
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:25,279
the kind of blurriness that gets in the

598
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:28,120
way of people driving you have a

599
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:31,400
sensitive central nervous system that's

600
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:33,679
that blurriness is usually from um other

601
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:37,320
things happening like a blood toxicity a

602
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:40,080
liver condition um heavy metals in the

603
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:42,000
liver uh viral issues like an Epstein

604
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,840
bar in the liver so maybe you guys have

605
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,480
noticed that with some of your Epstein

606
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,279
bar issues that you're learning now here

607
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,880
at the show and you're learning with

608
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,840
with the different you know Facebook

609
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,080
groups and everything that we're

610
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:54,600
teaching the information about epsteen

611
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,919
bar that your blurry eyes really really

612
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:59,360
can be that low-grade uh viral thing

613
00:23:56,919 --> 00:24:01,520
because the FD bar releases poisons and

614
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,360
toxins and the liver gets filled with

615
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,919
toxins the blood gets toxic and you get

616
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,880
the blurry eyes it affects the central

617
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:08,840
nervous system it then that's what

618
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,640
happens it's one form of blurry eyes

619
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:14,159
right there and

620
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,799
then there's another type of blurry eyes

621
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,440
cuz blurry eyes are the most popular

622
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:19,000
issue actually one of the most popular

623
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,120
issues so I'm really hitting that hard

624
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:25,679
now there's another type of blurry eyes

625
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:28,120
and this blury eye is about blood sugar

626
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:30,159
it's about blood sugar so blood sugar

627
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:34,039
issues hypoglycemia

628
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:36,840
hypoglycemia mostly hypo um and uh

629
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:38,200
inconsistent blood blood sugar issues uh

630
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:41,080
glucose

631
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:43,200
deficiencies um you know that all that

632
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:47,240
sporadic blood sugar you know high high

633
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:49,200
A1C whatever and that you know those

634
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,799
blood sugar disorders whatever someone

635
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,440
has even on a mild level will give you

636
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:56,440
blurry eyes that could easily give you

637
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:59,399
blurry eyes and a lot of the different

638
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:05,600
type 2 diabetes pre- diabetes high

639
00:24:59,399 --> 00:25:08,240
A1C um um uh hypoglycemia all that is is

640
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,760
is adrenals and liver adrenals and liver

641
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,559
adrenals and liver so once again we're

642
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:14,240
back to the liver we're back to

643
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:16,200
adrenals and um that's a big part of

644
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:19,840
that all on its own so that's another

645
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:21,480
form of blurry vision so that means that

646
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,399
look protect your adrenals if you're in

647
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,840
that form of blurry vision it's time to

648
00:25:23,399 --> 00:25:26,000
protect your adrenals it's time to eat

649
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:28,600
every hour and a half can't let your

650
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,840
blood sugar drop uh lower the animal

651
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:32,919
protein um you know the more animal

652
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:34,679
protein you eat with hypoglycemia you'll

653
00:25:32,919 --> 00:25:36,399
feel like it balances out but the worse

654
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:37,679
it'll get and turn into pre-diabetes so

655
00:25:36,399 --> 00:25:39,559
it means you have to lower the animal

656
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,640
protein I'm not against animal protein

657
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:42,440
I'm just saying if you're dealing with

658
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,880
hypoglycemia you're dealing with blurry

659
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,799
eyes because of blood sugar issu you got

660
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:47,720
to lower the animal protein could maybe

661
00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:49,520
eat it once a day and the rest has to be

662
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:51,520
more fruits and vegetables and salads

663
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:54,120
and and um different things like that

664
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:56,000
that we always talk about and you'll see

665
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:57,360
you can get a little bit better but you

666
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,440
have to eat every hour hour and a half

667
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,240
if you're dealing with that kind of

668
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,480
blurry eye and that's a big deal so you

669
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,000
want to support your adrenals and

670
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,559
strengthen your adrenals clean up your

671
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,880
liver and um and then maybe down the

672
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:09,240
road you can bring in more animal

673
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,679
protein if you want you know once you

674
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,320
get it under control and get it in a

675
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:14,159
better place and and don't set yourself

676
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:17,320
in the in in the stage for pre-diabetes

677
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:18,840
and diabetes um and so that's that and

678
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:20,720
as long you just have to have a healthy

679
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:23,840
diet too around it all but that's one

680
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:28,440
type of blurry eyes that we're talking

681
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:30,360
about and so um and then there's other

682
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,960
things too let's let's leave blurry eyes

683
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:35,000
for a little bit let's go into other

684
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:36,600
areas too people talk about glasses they

685
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,159
say well if you need glasses you got

686
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:41,600
some you know you got a health problem

687
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:44,919
or you got eye problems not necessarily

688
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:47,679
with glasses that's not how it works um

689
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:50,279
if a child needs glasses early this is

690
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:53,559
this is mercury inherited from the

691
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:57,960
family this is mercury passed down from

692
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:59,360
the family line Mercury causes people to

693
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:02,640
need

694
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:06,200
glasses not entirely every reason why

695
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:09,000
people need to to have glasses but it is

696
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:14,279
responsible for people needing glasses

697
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:17,600
Mercury is is um disorient disorientates

698
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:20,520
the eye it basically it basically throws

699
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:23,279
off the eyes the eye muscles it throws

700
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:24,880
off the eyes responses it throws off the

701
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:27,720
um even some of the nerves behind the

702
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,360
eye Mercury does a whole bunch of things

703
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:31,159
and if it's systemic if Mercury is

704
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,600
systemic and it comes from a family line

705
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:36,640
or you picked up new Mercury you know

706
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:38,720
you know children will have will need

707
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,519
glasses and they will need them soon

708
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,200
literally it can happen overnight and

709
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:45,919
that's what happens with Mercury and the

710
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,200
Mercury's effect on as far as everything

711
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,799
to do with Eye Health so it's a big part

712
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:52,440
of it right there so um some people

713
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,919
collect little bit a little bit of

714
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,039
mounts of mercury throughout their whole

715
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:58,080
life they have a little bit of inherited

716
00:27:56,039 --> 00:28:00,120
and then they um collect it over you

717
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,279
know all through their life and all

718
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:04,279
through their life and then their eyes

719
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:08,320
start going at they start kneading

720
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:10,679
glasses at age 40 age 42 age 44 this is

721
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,919
just your normal average buildup of

722
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:15,440
heavy metal toxicity forcing you know

723
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:18,240
glasses to be needed um this is a big

724
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:21,039
part of it and so when it comes down to

725
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:25,159
glasses it's really just you know higher

726
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:27,000
levels of mercury in the body um and but

727
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:28,120
we're not allowed to talk about Mercury

728
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,760
ever

729
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:31,919
instead we have to completely avoid it

730
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:34,240
like it doesn't exist um in

731
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:37,480
life-changing Foods I really Let it

732
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:39,399
Loose about the things that are taking

733
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:41,360
us down as a culture as a society and

734
00:28:39,399 --> 00:28:44,880
really harming us and one of those is

735
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:46,840
Mercury and um but hey everybody wants

736
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,720
to blame it on our jeans because no one

737
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:50,720
wants to go there no one wants to go

738
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,120
there no one wants to know what's really

739
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,559
causing our problems and how you know we

740
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,240
have this Mercury that's being passed

741
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:58,000
from generation to generation it's

742
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,120
ruining our eyes it's causing all kinds

743
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,640
of trouble but hey no blame it on our

744
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,600
jeans it's always the easy way out it's

745
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,640
the best way out because it's your fault

746
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,120
that means it's your fault I love that I

747
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,200
love how it's always blamed on us

748
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:11,760
autoimmune it's your fault genetics it's

749
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,760
your fault um you know you're just a

750
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,039
pain in the ass it's your fault how

751
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:18,440
about that so that's just not how it

752
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:20,240
works it's how it should work and and we

753
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,880
need to change that tide and it's

754
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,880
important and that's what that's that's

755
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,360
the whole point so we have to be honest

756
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:28,080
about the Mercury that we have that

757
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:30,080
we're inherited and we get uh you know

758
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,960
affected by now and collect throughout a

759
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,320
lifetime and it has to come out that's

760
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:35,440
why the heavy metal detoxes are

761
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:36,880
important so what I'm saying is if

762
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,480
you're somebody dealing with eyeglasses

763
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,519
needing eyeg glasses it's heavy metal

764
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:43,679
detox is what you have to do is what you

765
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:45,960
need to do someone said to me recently

766
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:48,880
you know you you wear glasses Anthony

767
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:51,799
and I said do you know my

768
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,840
story do you know my story because if

you don't know my story let me give you

770
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:58,200
a little uh a little basis a little

771
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:02,200
Foundation of my story

772
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:04,640
you know I live my life 34 blind because

773
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:07,600
I see nothing but white from spirit's

774
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:11,200
light because I do readings non-stop my

775
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:12,799
entire life so everybody you know people

776
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,360
if you're not blind for other reasons or

777
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:17,440
handicapped or blind for other reasons

778
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,600
um and um and you're not blind and you

779
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,279
have you have you know your regular

780
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:24,200
eyesight you get to see you know your

781
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:26,640
whole life your whole there's no three

782
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:29,720
quarters missing I have three quarters

783
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:31,720
missing my life because it goes white

784
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,559
and I talk about that and I I've talked

785
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:35,480
about this before in different places

786
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:37,039
it's a it's a light blindness that comes

787
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,440
when Spirit does readings or I look

788
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:42,720
inside the body of

789
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:44,480
somebody and the um and and the light

790
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,039
that happens you know that's why I have

791
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,480
to need an assistant when I go on an

792
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:49,919
airplane because I just lose my eyesight

793
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,880
in the airport instantly because I'm

794
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:53,880
doing all the readings Spirit sending

795
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:56,240
light down I'm looking at everybody I'm

796
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:58,080
doing reads it's it's Unstoppable I

797
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:02,279
can't stop it's been happening since Age

798
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:05,080
4 and so what I did was um and I went to

799
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:05,880
the eye doctor uh and in myself and I

800
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,919
said you know what I'm going go to an

801
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:09,480
eye doctor I'm going to have my I'm

802
00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:12,039
going to talk about my gift and how it

803
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:15,120
blinds out my light and take wipes it

804
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:16,200
all out and you know and I can't see so

805
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,559
the eye doctor looked at my eyes and

806
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,840
said well you got the perfect 2020

807
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:20,919
Vision so you don't have an eye problem

808
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:22,519
so you don't need glasses and I told him

809
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:24,080
about what was going on he said you know

810
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:26,000
what though we could probably throw on

811
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,720
some glasses so that when you go in

812
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,279
front of crowds and you do things that

813
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:31,960
you can see farther away with all the

814
00:31:30,279 --> 00:31:34,960
haze of light that you got to live with

815
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:36,880
maybe it'll improve You by by um 1% or

816
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,039
something and it has it actually it

817
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:41,240
actually helps so when I'm doing events

818
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:43,399
or anything else it helps get through

819
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:45,320
the smoke and fog of that bright light

820
00:31:43,399 --> 00:31:48,440
that Spirit sends down so that's why I

821
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:50,320
wear glasses but um but you know when I

822
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:52,440
do wear them and then but the point is

823
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:55,519
is that when we have to wear glasses

824
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:56,880
though in life and everything we we have

825
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:58,399
we're dealing with a Mercury issue we're

826
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,880
dealing with the heavy metal that we

827
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:02,799
have to deal with and that has to be

828
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,279
that has to be cleaned up and your eyes

829
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:06,760
will get better your eyes will get

830
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:08,120
better I lots of people I know that have

831
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:12,519
done the heavy metal

832
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:14,440
detox have um have they've gotten rid of

833
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:17,440
their glasses and they've been able to

834
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:20,320
toss them and throw them out um you know

835
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:22,559
don't do that yet make sure that you're

836
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:24,720
taking care making sure that you're

837
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:26,519
taking care of yourself um you know

838
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,200
meaning use your glasses for a while

839
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:29,559
until you start adjusting and then you

840
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,639
start adjusting and then you start

841
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:33,840
adjusting get the heavy metals out build

842
00:32:31,639 --> 00:32:36,120
yourself up get the antioxidants in get

843
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,480
the minerals in with all the foods that

844
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,159
we're going to talk about a little later

845
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,919
and you can be one of those people that

846
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:43,679
actually doesn't need their glasses as

847
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:45,279
much anymore or in different or they you

848
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,679
your in eyesight improves enough where

849
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:49,720
you only need them partially or whatever

850
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:53,039
it is so um but as far as children

851
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:55,720
needing glasses at age six or age4 age8

852
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:57,799
that's from large deposits of mercury

853
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:00,159
that are that are that are p on Down the

854
00:32:57,799 --> 00:33:04,399
Line plus new collections of it so let's

855
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:06,679
keep that in mind and um so let's talk

856
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:09,960
about some different things as well

857
00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:11,919
glaucoma glaucoma that's an interesting

858
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,559
one eye pressure inflammation blood

859
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:15,279
vessels eye pressure the whole bit

860
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:16,919
that's from Epstein bar that's the

861
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:18,760
culprit for glaucoma there's an Epstein

862
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:21,840
bar virus of variety that causes

863
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:23,960
glaucoma and I've seen this variety not

864
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,919
do much of anything besides give

865
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,639
somebody a little fatigue until they

866
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,559
become 80 years old and they get the

867
00:33:27,639 --> 00:33:32,679
glaucoma or they get a little fatigue at

868
00:33:29,559 --> 00:33:34,480
age 60 70 doesn't really do much but the

869
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:36,240
variety of Epstein bar I'm talking about

870
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,279
ends up causing glaucoma so that's

871
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:41,240
that's actually one of the variety of of

872
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:42,519
varieties of Epstein bar and so you when

873
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:45,200
if you're dealing with glaucoma you got

874
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:47,679
to deal with antivirals antivirals

875
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:50,760
antivirals antivirals which leads me to

876
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:53,559
something to tell you that most I

877
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:54,919
conditions are viral and that's that's a

878
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:57,000
whole different that's a whole another

879
00:33:54,919 --> 00:33:59,120
thing so let's talk about some different

880
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,559
eye conditions here we got glaucoma

881
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,760
which is viral that's Epstein bar

882
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:04,679
related so you want to do an anti-

883
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:06,240
Epstein bar protocols including diets

884
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:08,240
and all the different things to knock

885
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,720
that out and and and improve that so

886
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,679
your eye pressure comes down and I've

887
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:12,800
seen people's eye pressures drop from

888
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:14,679
getting the right things in them

889
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,879
including getting zinc in them and

890
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:19,599
getting the right Foods you know getting

891
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:21,639
rid of the eggs the dairy products um

892
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:23,760
doing some antivirals olive leaf you

893
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:26,599
know I've seen people's people get

894
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,800
better with that now lots of vitamin C

895
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:31,240
also helps get rid of glaucoma too over

896
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:34,119
time and drops the pressure down

897
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:37,480
now there's other things associated with

898
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:39,240
viral issues like burning eye burning

899
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:42,079
you know I've had people come to me o

900
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:44,919
over the years the worst eye burning and

901
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:46,879
it's hell and it and it completely

902
00:34:44,919 --> 00:34:48,359
disables them and they can't function

903
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,919
they can't work they can't do anything

904
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:51,320
they got burning around their eyes they

905
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:53,399
got burning under their eyes they got

906
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:55,079
burning above their eyes they're running

907
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:57,000
around they think it's mold and it's not

908
00:34:55,079 --> 00:34:58,480
mold and they go to you know 100

909
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,000
different doctors the neurologist you

910
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:03,599
name it and they get MRIs CAT scans at

911
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,400
the brain and the eye burning is

912
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:08,280
Relentless and that's really you know

913
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:11,200
that that kills me when I see somebody

914
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:14,440
going through that because um because

915
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,720
it's just it's it's horrible and so what

916
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,920
happens with that that's usually the

917
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:20,400
shingles that does the eye burning um

918
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,680
I've seen Epstein bar Edge onto it

919
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,160
sometimes or hedg it but the shingles

920
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,839
tend to do a lot of eye burning you

921
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:26,320
don't need a rash to have the eye

922
00:35:24,839 --> 00:35:28,200
burning although some people they break

923
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,920
out shingles on the shoulder they break

924
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:34,880
out shingles on the shoulder um the

925
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:37,320
shoulder blade back uh you know uh neck

926
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:39,200
torso what they break out with a

927
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:40,640
shingles and then it goes away 5 years

928
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,320
later they have burning eyes that's

929
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,880
that's later stage shingles without the

930
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,400
rash so um and you don't even have to

931
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,320
have the rash in order to have that so

932
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:51,000
the burning eyes is is a lot of shingle

933
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:53,640
stuff so what you do is um you know we

934
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:56,319
work on the shingles protocols uh very

935
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:57,400
important uh so that's that's critical

936
00:35:56,319 --> 00:36:00,000
but it's good good to know what's

937
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:02,440
causing it tickling tingling Sensations

938
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
on the side of the face causing eye

939
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:07,000
issues you know temple on the temple

940
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,480
causing eyes to squint causing eyes to

941
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,880
feel weak causing eyes to burn a little

942
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:16,000
bit that's all shingles it's all viral

943
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:17,640
too floaters floaters white spots black

944
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,839
spots unexplained you're at the eye

945
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,839
doctor don't know what the hell it is

946
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:22,920
that's that's Epstein bar that's Epstein

947
00:36:20,839 --> 00:36:25,359
BR that's 100% viral it's a lot of

948
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:27,160
neurotoxin floating around in the body

949
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:28,839
um and short circuits the it actually

950
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:30,640
short circuits currents and electrical

951
00:36:28,839 --> 00:36:32,200
currents that go to the eye and causes

952
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,480
floaters it causes all kinds of

953
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,119
different things now I'm not talking

954
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:36,359
about detach retina and you see

955
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:37,839
something because you got to detach

956
00:36:36,359 --> 00:36:39,680
retina and you're seeing you know a dark

957
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:41,079
spot or you're seeing something else I'm

958
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:44,480
talking about floaters that are

959
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:46,280
unexplained that's all Epstein bar 100%

960
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,040
um and it gets us every time the

961
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:49,160
floaters are really annoying that's

962
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,440
that's that's something that's really

963
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:52,160
annoying that's why I'm doing the life

964
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:54,040
changing Foods book I put it out there

965
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,880
because I have that symptom showing what

966
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:58,000
foods to deal with that symptom you

967
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,760
focus on that symptom take the foods out

968
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,359
of the book focus on just those foods

969
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,839
and you get better you start moving

970
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:06,200
forward and you start going past things

971
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:08,240
um so floaters is a big one there uh

972
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,960
trigeminal neuralgia trigeminal

973
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,480
neuralgia is caused by shingles that's

974
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,440
something that goes up the neck it goes

975
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:15,480
in the jaw it goes in you know you get

976
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,319
told you have TMJ sometimes you don't

977
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:19,800
get told you have TMJ but you just have

978
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:23,119
that pain that tends to run to the eye

979
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:25,480
causing eye pain so eye pain unexplained

980
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:27,760
eye pain is the nerves caused by

981
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:29,760
trigeminal neuralgia caused by shingles

982
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,599
that's a whole another one too so let me

983
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,400
just simplify you got eye pain it's

984
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:35,960
unexplainable it's the shingles

985
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:38,079
simplified okay if we want to complicate

986
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:39,680
it yes it's trigeminal neuralgia it's

987
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:42,240
from the neurotoxin from shingles

988
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:44,200
inflaming the nerve the trigeminal nerve

989
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:46,040
when that nerve gets inflamed it'll give

990
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:49,520
you eye pain that's a little bit more

991
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:51,000
the complicated version so um and it

992
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,280
gets you know and and there's just more

993
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:57,760
to it than that too so that that's

994
00:37:53,280 --> 00:38:01,079
another example migrains I Rel Rel ated

995
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:03,640
migraines okay yep I related

996
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:06,520
migraines um ocular migraines different

997
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:09,319
kinds of migraines um all then affect

998
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:11,480
eyes going to the eyes once again viral

999
00:38:09,319 --> 00:38:13,160
and heavy metals too though so that's a

1000
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:15,359
whole combination of viral and heavy

1001
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,800
metals shingles virus is one of them

1002
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:18,960
I've even seen you know I mean the

1003
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:21,680
Epstein bar too I've even seen other

1004
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:24,280
things like hhv6 throw that into the the

1005
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:27,359
mix um you know some people have really

1006
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:28,960
high versions of you know CMV uh ceglar

1007
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:31,319
virus and I've seen that kind of amp up

1008
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:34,200
the anti a little bit as far as creating

1009
00:38:31,319 --> 00:38:37,720
poisons but understand this migraines

1010
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:39,319
yes viral eye problems from migraines so

1011
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,599
that's a whole another angle a lot of

1012
00:38:39,319 --> 00:38:42,720
people with migraines go to the eye

1013
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:44,400
doctor all the time eye issues all the

1014
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,440
time they're wondering what's going on

1015
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,800
getting checked all the time so that's

1016
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,280
another example let's talk about

1017
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:51,200
something else I just I know I always

1018
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,160
run us out a time but we got time we

1019
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:55,240
still got time hang in there is the seat

1020
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:57,319
belt still on are you guys hanging in

1021
00:38:55,240 --> 00:39:02,400
there cuz I'm hoping

1022
00:38:57,319 --> 00:39:05,280
so um um sty who gets a sty out there

1023
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,400
who gets chronic sty they're awful

1024
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,119
that's strepa cacus that's strep in the

1025
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:11,119
system that's strep in the sinuses that

1026
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:15,440
sit there dormant comes out it causes a

1027
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:17,119
sty your immune system breaks down um so

1028
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,640
that's that you can even you can even

1029
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:21,359
put you know e sty are are also from

1030
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:23,040
fresh strep so strep that you've you

1031
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:24,960
know you grabbed a door knob in a really

1032
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,680
kind a greasy door knob in kind of a

1033
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,520
really dirty place and then you just had

1034
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:30,240
your finger in your eye for like 10

1035
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:33,280
minutes because you decided to rub your

1036
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:35,640
eye um then you know that that's an easy

1037
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:40,040
sty coming also I've seen people get the

1038
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:43,000
flu virus and or colder flu and it it

1039
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:45,359
directly it dropped the immune system um

1040
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,280
the congestion actually feeds any kind

1041
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:50,319
of ongoing strepa cacus issue that's

1042
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:52,280
happening and that sty can break out

1043
00:39:50,319 --> 00:39:53,760
just from the strep so we have a lot of

1044
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:55,599
strep in our system I'm doing a whole

1045
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,359
show on strep so you know all the

1046
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:59,119
different ins and outs of it as much as

1047
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:00,880
I can give you on on you know in a show

1048
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:04,200
and I'm doing that coming up pretty soon

1049
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:06,040
so hang in there for that but sty are

1050
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:08,800
are mostly strep

1051
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:12,000
related and um and so that's something

1052
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:14,440
that we got to keep our immune system um

1053
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,359
up zinc got to have your vitamin C you

1054
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:18,480
know all that has to be there for your

1055
00:40:16,359 --> 00:40:23,119
immune system let's talk about some

1056
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:26,640
other things too optic nerve issues 100%

1057
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:28,760
viral 100% viral optic nerve issues

1058
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:30,079
optic neuritis optic neuritis there's

1059
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,599
all kinds of different nerve issues with

1060
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:33,119
the optic nerve so when you go to the

1061
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:34,800
eye doctor and they look and they look

1062
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:37,400
deep into the nerve they do a test they

1063
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:39,920
say hey your optic nerves look healthy

1064
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:42,400
and um if they don't look healthy that's

1065
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,800
a viral infection uh right there Epstein

1066
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,880
bar it's one of the varieties of Epstein

1067
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:47,880
bar that causes op optic neuritis and

1068
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:50,160
also different kinds of op optic nerve

1069
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:52,040
issues um you know you start you know

1070
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:54,680
start getting problematic issues with an

1071
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:57,640
eye or one eye or two eyes uh usually

1072
00:40:54,680 --> 00:41:00,680
just one eye with optic nerve issue

1073
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:02,359
that's viral so we got to go antiviral

1074
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:04,560
um another reason why the fruits the

1075
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:09,280
vegetables herb spices the wild foods

1076
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:11,240
are antiviral it matters so much I'm

1077
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,839
going to blame viral because it's the

1078
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:14,359
truth of what things are instead of

1079
00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:16,040

1117
00:42:44,359 --> 00:42:49,640
it's about taking out it's about taking

1118
00:42:47,079 --> 00:42:52,040

00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:12,359
as easy to fix but we can still support

1126
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,440
the eye we have left or both eyes if

1127
00:43:12,359 --> 00:43:19,079

um adrenals have a big role it's not the

1133
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:37,760
entire reason some people get dry eyes

1134
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:40,280
because they get blockages in the Ducks

1135
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:42,480
um you know these these blockages are

1136
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:45,640
from low-grade bacterial infections such

1137
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:47,240
as strep and even staff staff's actually

1138
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:49,680
another one that gets in the eye that

1139
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:52,160
can cause a sty too it's not just 100%

1140
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:54,200
strep but it's close but sty actually

1141
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:57,359
you know can be can be staffed too I

1142
00:43:54,200 --> 00:44:00,319
