you're listening to the medical medium

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,320
radio show where each week I talk about

7
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,920
the most advanced healing information

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,320
and secrets about health much of which

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,239
is not found anywhere else and is

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,399
decades ahead of what's out there now as

11
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:37,559
I've always said who has 10 or 20 30

12
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,800
years to wait for answers to their

13
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:42,000
illnesses we don't have that time to

14
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,920
wait we need these answers because as

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,760
the time goes on as each year goes on

16
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,800
and we're not well and we're not feeling

17
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:51,920
good and we're struggling and battling

18
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:54,600
different symptoms we need the answers

19
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,039
we need to know we need to know now it's

20
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,480
going on and we can't wait for

21
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:03,800
literature that's 10 20 years behind 10

22
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:07,200
20 years behind to keep on circulating

23
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:09,159
over and over again even if it's got new

24
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,000
Frills and chills going on it's got a

25
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:13,720
little bit of flash going on so it looks

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,360
like it's changed up it's still the same

27
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:19,040
theories behind it and that's what's

28
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,920
amazing about the medical Medium show

29
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,759
because spirit's going to bring you

30
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,360
what's real what's now what you need to

31
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,720
heal how you can heal what we can do to

32
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:31,079
move forward together how we can not

33
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,399
just backtrack over and over again how

34
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:35,079
we can move forward instead and that's

35
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:37,000
what this show is about it's really

36
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:38,680
important to know that anybody knew that

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,680
just you know got on to the show just

38
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,960
now and listening and you know you

39
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,280
clicked on your device and you're

40
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,399
listening that's what this show is about

41
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,320
it's about getting you information

42
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:48,920
that's Advanced because if you're still

43
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,479
talking about leaky gut you don't even

44
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,960
know what leaky gut is because that's

45
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,600
the whole thing there's new new

46
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,759
literature coming out new books new

47
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:59,399
information new stuff on the internet um

48
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:01,240
coming out about leaky gut and it's

49
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,240
actually not accurate it's

50
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:07,200
misinformation it's old information

51
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:10,399
keeps on coming back at us but it gets

52
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,360
repackaged over and over again and even

53
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,720
when an idea is slightly new in the

54
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,200
health field it has an old baggage

55
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,239
attached to it like all the baggage like

56
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,720
your body's still attacking itself kind

57
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:22,920
of baggage where it's all your genes and

58
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,560
that's your problem and that's why

59
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,400
you're sick so you can't doing anything

60
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,239
about it it's that kind of stuff it's

61
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,400
just the old stuff or it's all in your

62
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:31,840
head still

63
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,440
and that you're you're you're fine and

64
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,360
it's all in your head and you look good

65
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,959
and you you look fine so what's wrong

66
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,920
with you because you look fine from the

67
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:43,159
outside so what can be wrong with you on

68
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:46,080
the inside and so all this old baggage

69
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:49,640
is attached to even new stuff coming out

70
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:53,120
every day and I'm waiting I'm waiting

71
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:54,560
for that to change and you it didn't so

72
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,680

73
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,760

79
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,200
because technically what we're doing or

80
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,040

from Spirit and I'm giving it to you I'm

87
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:28,599

been there the whole time and then

92
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:38,120
you're taking this

93
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:40,480
information that's Advanced ahead of

94
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,280
time of research and science ahead of

95
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,640
time of what's out there now and In

96
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,720
Articles and books and internet and

feeds and everything else you're getting

98
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:52,360
information you're plugging it into your

99
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,400
intuitive nature and that's

100
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:58,000
strengthening it it's taking it there

101
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,840
and then you're assisting other people

102
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,799
without even realizing it sometimes

103
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,599
you're in the health food store and

104
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,159

00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:02,599
you know with me it started age four and

184
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,919
I woke up one morning heard Spirit

185
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:08,840
speaking to me perfectly clear and this

186
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:10,360
is from an outside source so I hear it

187
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:13,919
just like you're talking to me right now

188
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:15,919
fluently nonstop it doesn't stop and

189
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,680
this is why the information's accurate

190
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:19,639
all the time when I'm working with

191
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,319
people and how I've helped them all

192
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:23,520
these decades and all these years since

193
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:26,160
I was a child because I'm not in the way

194
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,199
of it and and this way this gift has

195
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,280
been given to me to help people in a way

196
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:31,759
so I could never get get in the way so

197
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,319
it doesn't matter if I get tired doesn't

198
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:37,039
matter if I'm exhausted doesn't matter

199
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:39,400
if I'm just totally totally frustrated

200
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:42,120
about something you know or going

201
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,800
through a hard time or you know totally

202
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,080
just tired where you know you just you

203
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,520
you've worked all day and all of a

204
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:49,599
sudden spirit's still going to come into

205
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:54,039
the information's going to come Non-Stop

206
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:55,800
and it can't shut off um you know it's

207
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:57,680
it's basically been like this my whole

208
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,479
life so anybody first tuning in and they

209
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,599
haven't you looked into me or you

210
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:03,199
haven't seen anything about me yet

211
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:05,319
understand that I hear a voice it tells

212
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,479
me what's wrong with someone at all

213
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:09,120
times no matter what I'm doing whatever

214
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:11,159
what mood I'm in or whatever I've been

215
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,240
through whatever I'm going through and

216
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:15,000
it's it's endless and it's non-stop

217
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,960
that's what I've had to deal with I

218
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,120
almost didn't make it here literally

219
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:22,560
here at all there were times in my life

220
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,440
when I was 10 11 12 years old where I

221
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,800
said you know what this is not I'm not

222
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:30,199
going to make it because you can't

223
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:33,479
function as a normal human being knowing

224
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:35,800
everything about someone all the time in

225
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:38,599
every crowd you're in in every place you

226
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:41,039
are and I fought for it I fought for it

227
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:43,159
to be here I fought for it to help you I

228
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:45,240
fought for it to make sure that you guys

229
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:48,160
take this information and help others

230
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:50,440
and I stand behind you 100% And I back

231
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,480
you up and I'm with you and we're going

232
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:55,160
to do this have you checked out the

233
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:59,040
life-changing Foods book it's coming out

234
00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:01,839
soon check it out go go to the bookstore

235
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,399
after ask about it go to Amazon go go to

236
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,959
Barnes & Nobles whatever check it out

237
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,519
and it's coming out and you're not going

238
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:11,920
to be disappointed I promise if you're

239
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,279
disappointed then I'm really in trouble

240
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,519
because I gave it

241
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:19,120
everything and you're going to be really

242
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:20,600
excited because in there are over 50

243
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,000
fruits and vegetables and what they do

244
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:26,320
for us what diseases they heal what

245
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,120
conditions what symptoms they heal in

246
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,920
and here's the thing I'm talking about

247
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,640
this right now because we're going into

248
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,079
allergies and we're going we're going to

249
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:36,360
be talking about food and we're going to

250
00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:39,480
be cutting into this a little bit and

251
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:43,600
just so you know there are foods that we

252
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:45,880
we were told we have a sensitivity to

253
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,480
that are actually lifechanging and we

254
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,760
and really healing us and we're doing

255
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,120
other things we're having a little bit

256
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:56,279
of a detox or we're having a healing

257
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,760
effect and we're told that that isn't

258
00:09:56,279 --> 00:10:02,079
what it is we're told we're allergic to

259
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:05,680
self cery we're told we're allergic to

260
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:09,279
an Apple we're told we're allergic to an

261
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:13,200
orange we're told we're allergic to a

262
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:16,760
lettuce we're told we're allergic to

263
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:19,079
asparagus and we're confused about foods

264
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:21,640
and life-changing Foods I spell it out

265
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:24,240
Advanced information from Spirit that's

266
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:26,320
decades and decades ahead of its time in

267
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,480
there about what phytochemicals are

268
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,040
really doing what for us what's changing

269
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:34,160
our lives when we eat and how to protect

270
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,920
ourselves and it we need this resource

271
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,360
today and how to protect our children

272
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:41,279
how to protect our family you know all

273
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:43,920
of it is in there what we're what we

274
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:46,399
need to avoid and what we need to

275
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:49,560
actually be afraid of out there so we

276
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,959
can rise above it and push it away

277
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:54,440
that's right it's about what we need to

278
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:56,800
really know about and look out for to

279
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:59,200
protect our family and our friends and

280
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,880
our loved ones so you know look into to

281
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:05,920
that when you can as soon as you can

282
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:07,920
check it out so hey look look you know I

283
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,839
I'm sure you've heard it before you know

284
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,839
you're allergic to something or maybe

285
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:15,000
maybe you know you think you you're

286
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,519
allergic to something but I want to

287
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,800
start out talking to you about a couple

288
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:23,000
of things with this to begin with

289
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:25,200
science and research doesn't know what

290
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,399
happens to food when it enters the

291
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,959
stomach you heard me say that before

292
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:32,880
you've heard it from me to cor okay and

293
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,560
I have to say it again because it

294
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:38,959
applies it applies once

295
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:42,000
again so here we go Medical Science

296
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:44,040
medical research and Science in general

297
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,920
doesn't know what happens to food when

298
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:49,720
it enters the stomach okay we are in the

299
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:51,920
baby stages when I mean baby stages I

300
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:54,600
mean we're in the actually we're in the

301
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:58,320
dinosaur prehistoric stage of

302
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:59,720
understanding that yeah the assimilation

303
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,480
enzymes

304
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:04,440
digestion

305
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:07,360
absorption but what does all that mean

306
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:09,600
enzymes breaking down food okay the

307
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,600
pancreas does a little bit of this and

308
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,680
the hydrochloric acid does a little bit

309
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,240
of that but did you know that science

310
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,680
and research doesn't know that there's a

311
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,959
blend of seven different acids in

312
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:23,680
hydrochloric acid that's in the stomach

313
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:27,120
and they've only singled out one of them

314
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,600
why maybe funding maybe nobody cares

315
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,800
maybe they just haven't stepped on it

316
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:34,240
yet maybe they haven't just come across

317
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,720
it yet but that's just one example of

318
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,839
how we don't know what's going on in the

319
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:43,040
gut okay so the latest information about

320
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:44,560
leaky gut sure but that's out there but

321
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,279
the information about the fact that your

322
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:51,600
hydrochloric acid is a blend of seven

323
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:54,240
different acids seven okay and those

324
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,680
seven acids actually do a whole bunch of

325
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,519
things that nobody knows and there's

326
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:02,680
foods like celery

327
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:05,839
that build up the seven different

328
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:08,360
acids because celery has mineral salts

329
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,880
undiscovered by medical research and

330
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,560
medical science this is a big one today

331
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,440
this is about medical research medical

332
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:15,560
science blah blah blah blah blah but

333
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,639
that's a big this is a big one today

334
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:20,160
about that because it's really another

335
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:23,760
place where we're

336
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:25,720
lost and so so think about that there's

337
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,240
these mineral salts and celery that have

338
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,959
not been identified measured or weighed

339
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,880
we know there're sodium in celery but

340
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:33,959
that's it and we think all sodium's the

341
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:36,800
same just like we think all Sugar's the

342
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:38,639
same okay just like we think now the

343
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,680
sugar and an apple is the same as as

344
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:44,120
corn syrup I mean come on come

345
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:47,959
on just all right and that's what's

346
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:50,440
going on out there okay and so you have

347
00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:52,839
to understand that celery is comprised

348
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:55,720
of these different mineral salts that

349
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:57,399
are not that are not discovered and they

350
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,120
change the chemistry inside the

351
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:02,240
intestinal tract and inside the gut and

352
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:05,320
the dadum and in the stomach itself so

353
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:08,040
that we Thrive so that our liver heals

354
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:10,959
so that our liver doesn't overproduce

355
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:13,880
bile and burn out and burn itself out so

356
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:16,600
we get fatty liver pre fatty liver the

357
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:20,120
whole bit and so that we can kill off

358
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:23,000
hpylori so celery juice actually has

359
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:26,639
phytochemicals in it to kill off H

360
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:29,199
pylori to kill it to burn it right out

361
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,800
of there literally

362
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:33,240
okay but science and research doesn't

363
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,959
know that either you see where we are we

364
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:37,519
we're really in a place that we're just

365
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:39,480
walking around bumping heads until we

366
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,000
see something on TV on one of the shows

367
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,839
on one of the health shows they're

368
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,399
saying oh you can do this and do that

369
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:47,199
and all that information is outdated

370
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:48,800
I've I've tuned in once in a while I I

371
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,519
can't help myself and tune in once in a

372
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,639
while and look at those and say oh my

373
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:55,959
God that stuff is that stuff's back

374
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:58,320
again from 30 years ago that steps back

375
00:14:55,959 --> 00:15:00,639
again and you know and everybody's just

376
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,279
like doesn't know and so you need to

377
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,839
know cuz we're going to arm you we're

378
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,959
going to arm you with health we're going

379
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:08,800
to arm you with with health and

380
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:12,160
spiritual information we're going to arm

381
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:14,360
you with truth okay and we're going to

382
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,000
arm you with truth about all of this see

383
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,959
science doesn't know what happens to

384
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,560
food when it enters the stomach and

385
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:22,040
that's a huge foundation and it's going

386
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:26,279
to take a long time before they get

387
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:29,600
there okay so how does science know what

388
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:31,639
we're allergic to or not how does that

389
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,079
happen okay first of all science of

390
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:36,920
research doesn't know what healing

391
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:39,480
powers are in food yet thousands of

392
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:41,680
phytochemicals I talked about raw honey

393
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:47,560
right I talked about that the other day

394
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:50,360
over 200,000 working alive

395
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:52,279
phytochemicals that have every function

396
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:54,560
ability meaning that are involved with

397
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:56,880
every part of your hormones to every

398
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,079
part of the organs to your immune system

399
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,959
to every aspect of your immune system

400
00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:02,720
your rbc's your white counts your

401
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,600
lymphocytes your basophils your

402
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:08,480
monocytes your neutrophils it goes on

403
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:11,680
and on and on and that's in Honey and

404
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:13,040
nobody knows and these phytochemicals

405
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,800
that are all in these fruits and

406
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,319
vegetables and honey also like I was

407
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,800
saying destroy bacteria mold viruses

408
00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:22,000
they stop and prevent diseases they

409
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:25,199
reverse and prevent

410
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,519
cancer and how these Foods care for us

411
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:30,079
is another thing that is completely

412
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,800
unknown and I talk about a lot of this

413
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,560
in the in the life-changing Foods book

414
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,600
that's why I brought it up earlier

415
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,040
because it's in there and we're going to

416
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,360
you know we're going to always talk

417
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,920
about it but it's in there and we don't

418
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,720
know about what these foods do to care

419
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:45,160
for us we don't know science and

420
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,880
research doesn't know how they fuel us

421
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,440
what organs and glands they care for and

422
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:54,839
nurture and

423
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:59,240
fuel okay and none of this is known by

424
00:16:54,839 --> 00:17:02,680
science just like mystery illnesses is

425
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:06,160
hundreds of mystery illnesses that have

426
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:08,959
labels and names of symptoms that

427
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:12,720
science doesn't know the cause of do you

428
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:16,240
see where we are right now at

429
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:18,240
2016 I mean come on you see we where we

430
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,360
are right now this is

431
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,280
unbelievable so autoimmune like I talked

432
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,280
about before is not the body attacking

433
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:28,679
itself okay we we talked about that and

434
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:31,600
that's not how it works you know I won't

435
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:34,200
you down that Lane right now but that's

436
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,440
you know the body does not attack itself

437
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,480
okay in fact it's the opposite there's

438
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:41,039
something attacking us and our body is

439
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,360
involved in trying to heal that so

440
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,120
that's how autoimmune works and then it

441
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,240
goes on down the line to other great

442
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:51,760
mistakes so if we don't know what's

443
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:55,440
causing lupus and ra and you know

444
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:57,640
Hashimoto and we know we know here at

445
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,080
the show you know cuz you're learning

446
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:01,600
every day from What Spirit has to say

447
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:05,640
because that's where the information's

448
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:08,679
coming from you know the truth and and

449
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:11,320
I'm delivering that to you guys you know

450
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:14,039
and and I'm learning from Spirit just

451
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:16,919
like you are I'm learning from Spirit

452
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:18,480
okay so you know the truth so we're

453
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:20,039
becoming those experts we're becoming

454
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,440
those Health experts right you're with

455
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:23,600
me on that

456
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,280
100% and that's what Spirit tells me

457
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,840
that we're we're becoming those experts

458
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,679
with all the information spirit's giving

459
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,480
us we know what what's causing the ra we

460
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,440
know what's causing the hashimotos we

461
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:36,000
know what's causing fibromyalgia tentis

462
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,799
vertigo brain fog like really what's

463
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,520
causing brain fog not not not

464
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:43,120
misinformation about brain fog that's

465
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:45,559
riddled all over there out there I mean

466
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,840
we know the real things behind all of

467
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:52,240
this now and we're still

468
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:55,039
learning look look you can actually

469
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:57,320
research and look up the tallest

470
00:18:55,039 --> 00:19:00,440
mountain and you're going to get an

471
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:02,240
answer because they've been able to

472
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:04,840
research and science has been able to

473
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:08,440
measure the tallest mountain okay cuz

474
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:11,840
you can weigh it and you can measure

475
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:16,120
it you can systematically on a physics

476
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:19,360
level weigh it and measure it okay you

477
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:21,840
can look for the deepest ocean the

478
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:24,320
deepest ocean and look to see how deep

479
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:27,120
the deepest ocean is and you're going to

480
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:29,840
get a pretty darn good answer because

481
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:32,520
they're able to weigh it and measure it

482
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:35,080
that's science that's

483
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:38,120
science but you can't weigh and measure

484
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:40,840
lupus you can't it's a name for a

485
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:43,360
confusion of elevated inflammation

486
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:45,799
there's no weighing there's no measuring

487
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,919
nobody knows what causes the symptoms we

488
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:50,400
do here you can't weigh and measure

489
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:52,280
mystery illness that everybody's

490
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,720
suffering from decade after decade and

491
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,600
then their children get that mystery

492
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,799
illness over and then their children get

493
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:00,720
it you can't weigh and measure it yet

494
00:19:57,799 --> 00:20:02,799
science is just not there so we have to

495
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:06,760
do we what we have to do listen I

496
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:11,440
recently was talking to a mother whose

497
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:15,679
son is in college okay and his Professor

498
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:17,559
went on a tangent to the whole classroom

499
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:21,039
to the whole you know to everybody there

500
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:24,000
went on a tangent about how fruit is bad

501
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:26,799
for us fruit is bad for us and is filled

502
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,280
with sugar okay a professor college

503
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:31,840
professor is sitting there

504
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:35,840
okay talking about how fruit is bad for

505
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:39,080
us telling kids okay young

506
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:42,720
adults that fruit is bad for us and how

507
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:44,960
how this is a type of fruit fear that

508
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,360
I've seen many times lately over the

509
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:50,960
last couple of years develop and a fruit

510
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:54,400
fear and a food fear I should say a food

511
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:56,760
fear has seeped into our own

512
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,000
universities and I've heard this before

513
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:01,480
some of our professors have adopted a

514
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,559
belief system from misinformation

515
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:06,600
they've adopted a belief system so they

516
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:08,120
went to like a belief system that

517
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:11,159
doesn't have any real medical research

518
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:13,000
or science so we're in the University

519
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:15,039
okay all right professors are supposed

520
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,840
to be doing stuff that's only measured

521
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:20,679
and made only measured and weighed so

522
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:24,120
professors are only supposed to be doing

523
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:26,960
something that's only measured or

524
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:28,640
weighed because it's about it's about

525
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,200
University it's about science it's about

526
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,880
research this was a science class that's

527
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:37,240
why I'm saying this this was a science

528
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:41,039
class but then adopts a belief system

529
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:43,720
from some other place that says that

530
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:46,000
sugar is all the same now and it's bad

531
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:49,480
and that's not correct science at all on

532
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:53,760
any level tells an entire group of

533
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:55,400
students a large Class A large Gathering

534
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,720
to not eat fruit at

535
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:59,159
all I mean and this isn't the first time

536
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,240
I heard heard this I've heard this a lot

537
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:02,480
I mean I've heard this multiple times in

538
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:08,159
the last couple of

539
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:11,080
years and so her son challenges the

540
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:14,600
professor and says since since when has

541
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,600
an apple been bad for

542
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:25,400
anyone especially since college students

543
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:29,679
don't eat fruit anyway they eat caffeine

544
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:31,760
coffee bad sugar Donuts

545
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:35,039
Bagels

546
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:38,559
Pizza um I don't know the list goes on

547
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:42,400
and on and on and on alcohol the list

548
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:44,640
goes on and on and on okay so and but

549
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,559
everybody's being told not to eat an

550
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:50,640
apple or a piece of fruit so the so this

551
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:52,480
this um this student challenged the

552
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,240
professor and the professor was actually

553
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:58,279
upset and the student you know is paying

554
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:01,159
the price so this is this is an example

555
00:22:58,279 --> 00:23:03,000
of what we're up to so you pay all this

556
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:04,559
money send your children to school

557
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,279
you're entrusting that they're at least

558
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:09,880
going to get research in

559
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:11,720
science and you know we're we're feeling

560
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:14,200
that we're being taught the truth the

561
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:16,120
what science is best to offer I'm not

562
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,600
saying this is how it is in school all

563
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:20,640
around at all I'm just saying this is

564
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,559
where the health movement is getting

565
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:25,000
twisted up into everything it's where

566
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:29,279
it's being pulled into everything at

567
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:33,120
every angle and getting us in trouble

568
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:36,799
because that Apple can help save lives

569
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:38,440
keep you here longer and help you heal

570
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:39,880
so why am I talking about all this why

571
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,480
am I getting into research and science

572
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,880
to such a degree because I I know we're

573
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,840
talking about allergies and everything

574
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:48,520
because in order to understand the

575
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:51,600
allergy the world you have to know the

576
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:54,279
flaws you have to know where everything

577
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:57,080
is unstable because if you don't you're

578
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:59,279
going to buy into the system that has

579
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:01,360
been created for allergies and you're

580
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:04,279
going to mess yourself up and mess your

581
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:06,679
head up and you're not going to be able

582
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:08,600
to feed yourself the right Foods because

583
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:11,200
you're going to let science and research

584
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:13,840
that isn't correct dictate what you're

585
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:16,159
supposed to eat you guys so that you

586
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:19,240
don't help your own family so that

587
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:21,919
you're afraid to give your child an

588
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:23,880
orange because you think that something

589
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:26,559
came up on some test that you might have

590
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:28,840
been allergic to it or your son or

591
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:31,480
daughter or your

592
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:33,880
husband and and then that's just going

593
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:35,360
to cheat you it's going to cheat you out

594
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:37,919
of something that's going to keep you

595
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:41,159
here healthier keep you here

596
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:44,080
longer and it matters it matters when

597
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:46,840
you get to the age of 60 which is

598
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:51,320
Young and you want to go the Long Haul

599
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:52,600
to 100 it matters when you're 70 and

600
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:56,799
it's those

601
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:59,360
oranges that you had 10 years ago that

602
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:03,799
are keeping you here longer because of

603
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:06,840
the phytochemicals in it it matters that

604
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:11,080
that cilantro you had in your

605
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:13,440
guacamole 5 years ago believe it or not

606
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:14,480
has power in it that's keeping you here

607
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,799
till you're

608
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:20,240
75 without realizing it cuz we don't

609
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:22,760
know because science and research hasn't

610
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:25,279
measured and weighed any of this

611
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:27,919
whatsoever and so when we get told in

612
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:29,520
the allergy testing world that you're

613
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:31,679
allergic to this you're allergic to that

614
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,600
it's in your way get rid of this and

615
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,720
it's all the foods that are good for you

616
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:38,360
that are actually lifechanging that can

617
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:40,760
save your life give you a longer life

618
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:43,919
bring you on down to that that final

619
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:47,240
place of succeeding in a length of life

620
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:50,360
that we want to and need to succeed in

621
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:53,640
it matters big time you see why I'm like

622
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:57,480
extra what is it extra sarcastic extra

623
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:59,880
annoying today extra extra passionate

624
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:02,320
okay okay extra passionate about this

625
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:05,200
you guys see okay so let's go into this

626
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:07,559
a little bit let's let's let's have some

627
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,640
fun okay so you got your seat bels on

628
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:12,039
let's do it all right now I'm not

629
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:13,360
talking about anaphylactic shock I'm not

630
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:14,600
talking about that we're going to do a

631
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,880
whole show on that down the road

632
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:18,440
anaphylactic shock that's a whole

633
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,760
different occurrence and a whole

634
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:23,240
different thing when someone is

635
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:25,919
dangerously allergic to

636
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:27,840
something and that means it's not just

637
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:30,000
peanut butter somebody can have

638
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,279
anaphylactic shock to

639
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,480
latex somebody can have anal

640
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:39,320
anaphylactic shock to

641
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:42,520
paint someone can have it to

642
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:44,760
gasoline you know Gasol gasoline hits

643
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:47,279
somebody's hand when they're at the pump

644
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:49,600
pumping their own gasoline and they need

645
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:53,279
an EpiPen because they're going into

646
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:55,320
anaphylactic shock to a

647
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:57,679
beasting this is different than what

648
00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:00,399
we're talking about today this is a

649
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:02,440
different reaction whole different thing

650
00:27:00,399 --> 00:27:05,399
so we're going to separate that but

651
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:07,679
today talking about allergies seasonal

652
00:27:05,399 --> 00:27:09,760
allergies talking about food

653
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:11,520
allergies on a different level we're

654
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,080
talking about those you guys hear about

655
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,440
this before have you been through it all

656
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:18,559
have you been through the whole thing

657
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,039
okay well we're going to talk about IG

658
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:22,440
IGG

659
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:25,960
testing that's what we're going to talk

660
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:27,799
about immunoglobulin testing okay

661
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:30,520
antibodies in the blood so we're going

662
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:34,240
into that a little bit right now what's

663
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:37,679
happening is we have this testing that's

664
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:39,919
happening right now that can showcase if

665
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,799
you are allergic to certain foods or

666
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:44,000
some

667
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:47,000
foods but it's not

668
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,640
accurate it's not correct is what it's

669
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,679
not and I'm going to talk about why for

670
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:53,000
example since we don't know what food

671
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,559
does we don't understand what's

672
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,320
happening inside the

673
00:27:54,559 --> 00:28:00,519
body so when IG tests come back

674
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,880
and they say Hey you are allergic to

675
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:06,320
celery and I hear that once in a while

676
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:08,919
you're allergic to celery what's really

677
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,159
happening is that the celery is killing

678
00:28:08,919 --> 00:28:12,279
off a

679
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:16,000
pathogen the

680
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:19,880
pathogen is releasing a

681
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:22,720
toxin that toxin creates a

682
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:24,320
histamine and this is for some people

683
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,960
that you know it shows up on the test

684
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,200
hey you're allergic to celery they're

685
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:30,480
saying that because you're celery juice

686
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:33,640
and your celer is destroying hpylori

687
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:38,120
it's killing off strepa cacus that

688
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:41,399
causes sibo it's lowering and reducing

689
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:43,679
sibo it's it's knocking out it's

690
00:28:41,399 --> 00:28:45,640
literally knocking mold and disarming it

691
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,159
completely so if anybody who's worried

692
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:49,720
about getting mold in their system or

693
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:53,440
has mold in their system and that's what

694
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:55,000
it's doing so when we do the IGG test we

695
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,880
come home and we're like okay I got this

696
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,679
big list we did not you know 90 Foods

697
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,760
plus plus plus Foods okay I'm allergic

698
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:03,519
to Cinnamon I'm allergic to celery I'm

699
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:06,120
allergic to Orange I'm allergic to um

700
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:09,080
Blackberry I'm allergic to hazelnuts I'm

701
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:12,159
allergic to uh cucumber allergic to

702
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:14,799
Tomato um we're doing the you know the

703
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:17,159
what is it the uh process of elimination

704
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:21,279
diet now through all this process it's

705
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:22,720
totally chaotic and not correct and look

706
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:24,279
I could be hurting somebody's feelings

707
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,200
right now I mean I got a lot of good

708
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:27,760
practitioners that that take the

709
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,120
information that I have and they do

710
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,600
different testings and stuff so I'm

711
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:33,159
saying that if you are a practitioner

712
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,960
and you do the IGG be open-minded in

713
00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:37,399
different ways you can still do this

714
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,399
test and still be open-minded to what's

715
00:29:37,399 --> 00:29:41,919
going on meaning I know you're

716
00:29:39,399 --> 00:29:44,120
open-minded but you can still pick up

717
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:46,679
more data from what we're talking about

718
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:49,399
today and incorporate it into there so

719
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:51,799
you can still be aware of why it's

720
00:29:49,399 --> 00:29:53,440
showcasing that test not you as a

721
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:55,720
practitioner or a doctor or as a

722
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,919
physician that's um not the one that's

723
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:01,440
not understanding it's the test itself

724
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:03,360
on what it's built upon it's the tool so

725
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,799
this is going to broaden that tool and

726
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:08,200
that spectrum and the information

727
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:11,960
involved around there so let's go into

728
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:14,640
it here um what happens is when someone

729
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:15,720
has a dairy allergy that they feel

730
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,080
lactose

731
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:20,960
intolerant that they feel that they they

732
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:23,880
have something go wrong the minute they

733
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:27,600
eat dairy products that's

734
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:30,399
because the dairy itself is feeding

735
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:32,840
something rampantly it's feeding

736
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:36,159
something so there's something inside

737
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:40,320
someone's gut or intestinal tract that's

738
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:43,399
feeding off of the dairy itself and then

739
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:46,159
eliminating eliminating a poison a much

740
00:30:43,399 --> 00:30:48,880
more poisonous substance than the dairy

741
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:52,159
itself this is what lactose intolerance

742
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:55,159
is lactose intolerance isn't because

743
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:57,639
someone is intolerant to

744
00:30:55,159 --> 00:30:58,799
lactose see how behind we are with

745
00:30:57,639 --> 00:31:00,960
science and

746
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:04,600
research you got to have yeah get your

747
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:07,000
notepad out get a cup of tea too get

748
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:09,200
listen to this show over again in the

749
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,600
archives as well and you get a cup of

750
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:14,000
tea and you get your notepad and just go

751
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:16,480
over it again and again and so when you

752
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,679
eat the dairy and it's someone like

753
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,039
yourself okay and you've been told your

754
00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:22,159
lactose intolerance because you have to

755
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:25,519
run to the bathroom you're running to

756
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:27,600
the bathroom because that dairy product

757
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:30,159
is hyper feeding it's called hyper

758
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:33,320
feeding that's it Spirit tells me Hyper

759
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:36,159
feeding it's feeding a set of bugs in

760
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:38,399
the colon and intestinal track that's

761
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:40,320
having a Feeding Frenzy just like a

762
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:42,919
whole bunch of piranha a whole bunch of

763
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:45,120
piranha in a fish tank and you throw

764
00:31:42,919 --> 00:31:46,559
some food in there like little fish and

765
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,440
they just have a Feeding Frenzy and they

766
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:50,240
just bite all these fish fish in half

767
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:53,440
they just they just eat all these fish

768
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:56,200
gobble them up and it's like crazy and

769
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:59,200
that's what happens and when this occurs

770
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:02,320
the body reacts acts it reacts because

771
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:05,000
when bugs feed rapidly they go to

772
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:07,000
bathroom the bugs go to bathroom they

773
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,760
have to eliminate and when they

774
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,240
eliminate they eliminate the dairy

775
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,559
product the

776
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:15,480
lactose and other things in the dairy

777
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:17,840
product not even the lactose that's

778
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:19,480
another thing too it's not about lactose

779
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,480
intolerance it's about more than lactose

780
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:24,639
intolerance it's all kinds of aspects of

781
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:27,760
dairy that feed problems and then the

782
00:32:24,639 --> 00:32:30,279
bugs eliminate a poison that's much more

783
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:33,880
toxic it's like a methyl poison a methyl

784
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:34,919
poison meaning it is synergistically

785
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:37,399
designed

786
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:39,399
differently it can travel it can do

787
00:32:37,399 --> 00:32:42,000
things it's much more

788
00:32:39,399 --> 00:32:44,200
poisonous and then the body reacts and

789
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,360
you have diarrhea you have cramps you

790
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:49,399
have stomach cramps you have bloating

791
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:52,360
all of this okay that's how it works

792
00:32:49,399 --> 00:32:56,399
that's how it works now you can

793
00:32:52,360 --> 00:33:00,399
still be allergic to dairy products but

794
00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:03,720
it not show up on the IGG test not show

795
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:05,919
up on the IGG test that's how confusing

796
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:09,000
the testing is or any kind of allergy

797
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:12,559
testing you can be allergic to Dairy and

798
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:18,279
other foods will show up I'll tell you

799
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:21,039
why other Foods okay are killing off

800
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:23,600
pathogens they're killing off pathogens

801
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:25,679
and it triggers off the allergy testing

802
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:29,200
so here's how it works here's how it

803
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:33,200
works if you eat a fig and it's killing

804
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:35,279
off eoli in your intestinal tract ecoli

805
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:38,279
which causes diverticulitis

806
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:40,360
diverticulosis or strep which causes

807
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:43,519
diverticulosis diverticulitis whatever

808
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:45,960
when you kill that off it

809
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:50,919
explodes so when you eat a

810
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:54,559
food like garlic that kills off H pylori

811
00:33:50,919 --> 00:33:58,679
CI staff strepa cacus

812
00:33:54,559 --> 00:34:02,399
eoli mold is mold mold actually mold can

813
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:04,159
be alive so when you kill off

814
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:06,919
anything it

815
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:08,879
explodes and it's poisonous when it

816
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:11,440
explodes when it

817
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:13,320
explodes and it's Affiliated to the food

818
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,399
that killed it off it's going to show up

819
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:17,679
on the IGG test that you're actually

820
00:34:15,399 --> 00:34:21,520
that you're actually allergic to figs

821
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:22,800
that you're actually allergic to a food

822
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,560
that you're actually allergic to

823
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:28,159
something that was doing this you're

824
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:30,639
allergic to banana because banana kills

825
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:33,440
viruses in the intestinal tract it kills

826
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:35,119
shingles which cause causes colitis so

827
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:38,760
it kills off shingles which causes

828
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:43,240
colitis that's what bananas does bananas

829
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:44,839
do and and so bananas do more than that

830
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:46,480
they kill off lots of things in the

831
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:48,280
intestinal tract that shouldn't be there

832
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,480
but they leave good bacteria they feed

833
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:53,320
good

834
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:57,119
bacteria but when a banana kills off

835
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:59,400
HIV you said it I said it you hear it hi

836
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:01,560
IV when it kills off

837
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:03,560
retroviruses when it kills off stealth

838
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:06,160
viruses when it kills off you know

839
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:08,480
colitis viruses such as such as

840
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:11,359
shingles when it kills off epine bar

841
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:14,520
cyto megler virus when it kills off

842
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:17,280
bacteria that bacteria that virus

843
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:18,640
explodes it explodes it dies because

844
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:23,240
there's a phytochemical in this food

845
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:27,280
that kills off that pathogen okay so

846
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:29,160
then it's a crap storm on the IGG test

847
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,480
or that thing's flying everything you're

848
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,720
allergic to this you're allergic to

849
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,880
Santo you're allergic to Strawberry

850
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,560
you're allergic to Banana you're

851
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,960
allergic to Apple now you're allergic to

852
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,800
artichokes out of nowhere you're

853
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:39,359
allergic to asparagus you're allergic to

854
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:43,160
zucchini you're allergic to Winter

855
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:44,560
squash butternut squash and it's insane

856
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:48,880
it's lunacy I'm just going to be

857
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:49,839
straight up it's lunacy so you have to

858
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,800
understand how it works and the

859
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:54,160
difference is alternative medicine

860
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,960
doesn't know and I don't care if it's

861
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,640
the best book The Best Literature I

862
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:59,200
don't care if the best article I don't

863
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:01,359
care if it's the best thing on the

864
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:03,920
internet the most advanced guy girl you

865
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:06,760
got out there doing what they're

866
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:10,440
doing if they don't know that we're

867
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:12,760
allergic to wheat because wheat feeds a

868
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:14,920
pathogen and then that pathogen's

869
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:17,160
eliminating causing the allergy or

870
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:19,680
causing the body to have a reaction

871
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:22,119
causing a body to have Celiac if they

872
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,599
don't know that yet which they don't

873
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:26,520
then we're way

874
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:28,160
behind so we're hoping that gets fixed

875
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,359
and you you guys are actually part of

876
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,560
that you're part of the knowing the

877
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:32,520
information cuz you know the right

878
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,280
information and it changes everything

879
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:36,160
and it breaks all the rules and it moves

880
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:38,040
forward it moves people forward so we

881
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:40,400
stopped you know we're stopped you know

882
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:41,280
being in the in the old ages or the back

883
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,119
you

884
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:47,079
know back in the that day we're back out

885
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:49,119
of that day here's the deal so when

886
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:51,480
you're eating wheat when you're eating

887
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:53,520
wheat and that wheat is feeding

888
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:55,920
something in the intestinal tract you're

889
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:59,760
going to get Celiac it's not your body

890
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:01,359
attacking itself self it's not the fact

891
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,480
that your body is trying to destroy

892
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:06,400
itself it's not the fact that these

893
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:08,040
antibodies are out to destroy you so

894
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,079
when IGG testing does all these

895
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:12,640
different foods and they say well

896
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:14,520
there's you know there's there's there's

897
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:17,920
proof here in the testing that says

898
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:19,880
there's antibodies that tell us that you

899
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:22,359
know your body is attacking it's

900
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:25,359
allergic to an Apple it's allergic to

901
00:37:22,359 --> 00:37:28,560
asparagus it's allergic to Basil it's

902
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:31,359
allergic to parsley it's allergic to

903
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:33,839
nettle and when we get told that it's

904
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:36,119
not accurate it's not how it works

905
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:38,079
partially nettle and asparagus and

906
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:39,680
artichoke they get rid of pathogens

907
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:41,800
they're phytochemicals are clean and

908
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:44,640
detox and when you clean and detox it

909
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:48,319
ruins the IGG test it completely ruins

910
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:49,960
all of the allergy testing in general

911
00:37:48,319 --> 00:37:53,920
that

912
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:55,960
occurs and when somebody's eating wheat

913
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,160
and they're having a reaction that can

914
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:59,839
last days or weeks later or they're not

915
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:03,480
even sure it's the wheat doing it it's

916
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:06,119
just the wheat feeding bugs and bugs are

917
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:08,960
feasting releasing

918
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:11,640
toxins that's what's really

919
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:14,280
happening same thing with eggs eggs can

920
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:17,760
feed bugs it can grow cysts and

921
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:20,119
tumors even if I I've seen people I've

922
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:22,119
seen people they got tumors they got

923
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:24,200
cysts they got breast cancer they get

924
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:26,640
the IGG test they get the the allerg

925
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:28,760
allergy testing and the allergy tests

926
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,440
come back they're allergic to a food

927
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:32,079
that's going to help stop their cancer

928
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:34,000
like wild blueberries they're allergic

929
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:35,839
to blueberries is what I'm saying or

930
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,440
they're allergic to raspberries even

931
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:39,440
though they're not having a r reaction

932
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,079
when they eat the raspberry blueberry

933
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:43,560
but then the test says they're not

934
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:45,440
allergic to eggs they're not allergic to

935
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:47,400
eggs the very thing that grows Cy in

936
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,119
tumors and feeds viruses to grow cyant

937
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,520
tumors and creates breast cancer and

938
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:53,400
thyroid cancer and all these other

939
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:55,640
Cancers and liver cancer eggs and the

940
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,880
tests come back where you can eat eggs

941
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:58,760
so you walk out of the office office

942
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:02,319
whoa I can't eat blueberries raspberries

943
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:05,400
and blackberries I can't eat melon I

944
00:39:02,319 --> 00:39:08,160
can't eat watermelon I can't eat this

945
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:09,720
but I can eat eggs do do you see what

946
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,920
I'm saying or you see where I'm going

947
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:15,400
here so that's what I'm talking about

948
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:16,880
right there so here's how it works

949
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:21,319
there's Foods we

950
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:23,800
eat that kill off bugs like apples

951
00:39:21,319 --> 00:39:25,599
there's Foods we eat like raspberries

952
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,640
that kill off bugs inside our body

953
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:29,880
pathogens that responsible for most of

954
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:32,680
all disease there's Foods we eat that

955
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:35,280
are eliminating toxic heavy metals you

956
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:37,839
guys pulling them out of our body

957
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:40,640
eliminating F Malahide that's in her

958
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:44,280
body eliminating ammonia

959
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:47,520
eliminating um uh

960
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:50,599
byproduct eliminating jelly that's

961
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:53,560
produced by viruses and

962
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:55,400
bacteria eliminating all kinds of these

963
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:58,319
poisons and toxins and toxic heavy

964
00:39:55,400 --> 00:40:00,160
metals and chem chemicals and pesticides

965
00:39:58,319 --> 00:40:01,040
and DDT that's been in her system from

966
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,520
our

967
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:05,280
forefathers everything these foods are

968
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:09,920
eliminating and when they eliminate

969
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:12,599
these toxins they trigger off a reaction

970
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:14,680
sometimes histamine reactions sometimes

971
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:16,040
other reactions because they're detoxing

972
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:18,480
they're pulling this stuff out of the

973
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:20,079
body so when you get your allergy tests

974
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,880
they're chaotic they're all over the

975
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:24,400
place they're not even in control

976
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,480
they're picking up the fact that you're

977
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,599
detoxing that you're killing off bugs

978
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:31,760
you're eliminating toxic heavy metals

979
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:34,440
and it's it's picking up all of

980
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:36,079
that and then in the end you get a list

981
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,800
of data that tells you not to eat

982
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:41,359
certain

983
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:45,480
foods and that's where it's all

984
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:50,079
wrong and if you are having reactions to

985
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:53,400
pollen to Ragweed hay fever get rid of

986
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:56,520
wheat get rid of dairy get rid of eggs

987
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:59,880
get rid of canola oil get rid of soy get

988
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:01,280
rid of corn get rid of MSG I talk about

989
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,839
it all the time look for it it's in

990
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:06,000
everything in natural

991
00:41:02,839 --> 00:41:08,400
flavors get rid of all of that and if

992
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:11,440
you want to go further get rid of

993
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:14,079
Rye okay and you know get rid of some

994
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:17,240
other grains if you really want to and

995
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:21,680
move those out bring in more fruits and

996
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:24,359
vegetables you'll be less apt to getting

997
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:27,800
anything from hay fever your hay fever

998
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:30,319
symptoms will drop your Ragweed

999
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:33,720
symptomss will drop your you know your

1000
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:35,440
symptoms from pollen will drop and you

1001
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:36,960
won't be so light sensitive and you

1002
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,520
won't have so many problems because

1003
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,640
those foods are feeding strap in the

1004
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:43,760
sinuses strap in the system strep in the

1005
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:45,760
lungs strep of cockus all over the body

1006
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,400
all kinds of bacteria all kinds of bugs

1007
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,440
different viruses and because all these

1008
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,720
foods that I mentioned are feeding all

1009
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:54,240
of that all the

1010
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:57,119
time what including pork well that feeds

1011
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:58,720
all these bugs and when that happens

1012
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:00,520
you're going to be more sensitive to the

1013
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:02,560
overload so when you start getting in

1014
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:04,720
front of mold you're going to react more

1015
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:06,440
when you start getting in front of

1016
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:08,599
pollen you're going to react more when

1017
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,800
you start getting in front of you know

1018
00:42:08,599 --> 00:42:11,119
hay you know when you start getting in

1019
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:14,800
front of hay when you start getting in

1020
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:17,720
front of ragweed you're going to react

1021
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:19,440
more so remember that keep these Foods

1022
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:21,040
out if you want and listen if it's too

1023
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:24,280
much or it's too scary start with one

1024
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:26,720
food just get weed out one food that's

1025
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:28,079
it you know I remember 30 years ago I

1026
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:30,160
told somebody to get off wheat spirit

1027
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:32,400
said get off wheat it was like an alien

1028
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,599
landed from another planet or something

1029
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,839
it was like spaceship just you know

1030
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:37,920
everybody was looking up in the sky as

1031
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:39,400
if there was like spaceships coming down

1032
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,040
be they could because no one could

1033
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:43,079
figure that could fathom what do you

1034
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:45,480
mean wheat what's wheat oh is that the

1035
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:47,559
bread I'm eating it's 30 30 years ago

1036
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:50,720
like what do you mean wheat you mean the

1037
00:42:47,559 --> 00:42:52,599
bread that gives us life is it I need to

1038
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:55,480
get rid of that that's what it was like

1039
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:58,240
30 years ago okay I'm just telling you

1040
00:42:55,480 --> 00:43:00,760
I'm sure many of you you know that and

1041
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:02,319
um so the bottom line is if you need to

1042
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:03,839
but if you need to wait on that you need

1043
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:05,359
to just get rid of one thing get rid of

1044
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:07,280
one thing get rid of two things whatever

1045
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:10,680
you think you can do and bring in more

1046
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:13,480
more things okay why would somebody

1047
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:15,119
react with burning sensation around

1048
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:17,000
their mouth if they had an apple there

1049
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:19,599
are a few people out there they have an

1050
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:22,680
apple and they react they get they get

1051
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:24,720
um they get a f funny feeling in their

1052
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:27,480
around their lips because that means

1053
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:30,440
that one time they had an apple when

1054
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:33,720
they were younger that was loaded with

1055
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:36,599
pesticides or DDT with a different name

1056
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:39,480
on it DDT switch names over and over

1057
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:42,240
again it's always been around so DDT or

1058
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:44,440
other pesticides with an with you know

1059
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:47,160
on top of that Apple waxed into that

1060
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:49,119
apple and so when they bit into that

1061
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:51,440
apple and it had a line of pesticides

1062
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:53,200
from a conventional apple and it got on

1063
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:55,680
their lips and in their mouth their body

1064
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:59,160
reacted from that chemical agent so then

1065
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:02,400
when they eat any Apple after that any

1066
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:06,040
Apple their body actually is going to

1067
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:08,559
react that can go away by eliminating

1068
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:11,319
all of the foods I talked about

1069
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:12,800
and um bringing in more fresh fruits of

1070
00:44:11,319 --> 00:44:15,440
other fresh fruits and other vegetables

1071
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:18,640
and things like that over time that will

1072
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:21,559
go away and someone be less reactive

1073
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:23,200
when they have something like that and

1074
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:24,880
then there's other reactions when

1075
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:27,400
someone feels funny in different ways

1076
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:31,680
those are detox reactions from the foods

1077
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:33,200
healing the person in different ways now

1078
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:35,359
a lot of things happen when you eat

1079
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:37,720
wheat or you eat dairy or you eat eggs

1080
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:39,359
you won't know what it's doing to you

1081
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:41,400
keeping you back holding you back with

1082
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:43,000
your chronic illness for weeks or even

1083
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,440
forever because you just you'll stay

1084
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,160
chronically ill eating these things and

1085
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:49,520
not know what's doing it and then when

1086
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:51,640
you eat something like a celery stick or

1087
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:53,440
a cucumber slice you feel funny or a

1088
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:56,599
tomato because those things are pulling

1089
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:57,520
out toxins pulling out Lots and lots of

1090
00:44:56,599 --> 00:45:00,640
toxic

1091
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:02,640
debris and all kinds of bugs and then

1092
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:04,280
you start reacting so you don't know so

1093
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,839
you go back to just eating you know

1094
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:08,800
bread and cheese grilled cheese

1095
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:10,520
sandwiches with butter I get it but you

1096
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:15,359
know you take one day at a time you work

1097
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:17,760
with it the point of this is not to be

1098
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:19,920
afraid of that list you're getting

1099
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:21,240
handed to you at the allergy's office

1100
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,920
meaning I'm not talking about

1101
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:25,480
anaphylactic shock list that's a

1102
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:27,920
different story you know be afraid of

1103
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:29,200
that that list that's different there's

1104
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,640
a whole different reason we're going to

1105
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,559
cover that in the next show and not in

1106
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:34,440
the next show coming up but coming up

1107
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:37,319
we're going to do that in the future but

1108
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:39,240
don't be afraid of the other list but be

1109
00:45:37,319 --> 00:45:42,280
afraid meaning be be

1110
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:44,960
concerned about the wheat the dairy the

1111
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:46,839
eggs okay the milk cheese the butter the

1112
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:49,000
ghee be afraid of all that stuff be

1113
00:45:46,839 --> 00:45:50,760
concerned of all that stuff too that

1114
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,440
stuff will keep your hay fever keep your

1115
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:53,960
Ragweed problems keep you on allergy

1116
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:56,079
medicine keep on all those different

1117
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:58,359
allergy medicines the nasal sprays all

1118
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:00,520
that that stuff will keep feeding MGS

1119
00:45:58,359 --> 00:46:02,160
keeping you on all of that like I said

1120
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:04,680
take one day at a time just incorporate

1121
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:06,800
celery juice into your life maybe some

1122
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:08,440
some wild blueberries just incorporate

1123
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,920
something like that into your life you

1124
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:12,880
take one day at a time is what you know

1125
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:14,640
is all you have to

1126
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:17,800
do

1127
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:19,960
so the bottom line is because medical

1128
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:22,880
research and medical science isn't there

1129
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:25,880
yet with what foods do for us and what

1130
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:28,480
foods don't do for us it's going to

1131
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:30,480
going to be you know it's basically

1132
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:32,280
going to be just a guessing game or a

1133
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:36,359
guessing match out

1134
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:39,319
there okay a guessing match I'll say

1135
00:46:36,359 --> 00:46:42,800
that instead of the other thing so so

1136
00:46:39,319 --> 00:46:45,880
just realize that we can't be guessing

1137
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:47,599
with your life with your health with

1138
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:49,520
your children's health with your

1139
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:52,480
grandchildren's health we can't be

1140
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:54,160
guessing anymore aren't you tired of it

1141
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:57,240
I just I I want to know are you guys

1142
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:59,319
tired of it okay cuz may maybe hey maybe

1143
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:01,359
I'm pushing it too far because I'm tired

1144
00:46:59,319 --> 00:47:02,760
of it and I know other people tired of

1145
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:05,960
it I'm just wondering if you guys are

1146
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:07,480
tired of it because it's real out there

1147
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:10,440
that's just a guessing game and we got

1148
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:12,240
to blow by that we need more that's what

1149
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:14,880
it's about today that's what it's about

1150
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:20,040
with allergies so what I suggest in the

1151
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:22,680
allergy world is don't fall victim to

1152
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:26,200
the misinformation from the IGG test or

1153
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:27,599
other allergy tests you keep the doctor

1154
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:29,800
because the doctor cares and the

1155
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:32,480
doctor's an amazing doctor in probably

1156
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:34,880
every every way it's just that the tool

1157
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:37,880
is what I'm saying don't fall victim for

1158
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:39,359
the testing tool you know talk to your

1159
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:41,240
doctor and practitioner if you really

1160
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:42,680
like your doctor and your practitioner

1161
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:43,839
and and they're telling you to stay away

1162
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:46,040
from all these foods that you're not

1163
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:47,720
sure if you even react or not to fruits

1164
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,960
and vegetables meaning stay away from

1165
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:50,359
all these fruits and vegetables that you

1166
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:53,319
don't even know if you're really

1167
00:47:50,359 --> 00:47:55,319
allergic or not to or you're reacting to

1168
00:47:53,319 --> 00:47:57,800
you know talk to your practitioner talk

1169
00:47:55,319 --> 00:47:59,520
to your doctor and say can I have these

1170
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:01,960

1171
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:04,880
bug me that much I I had them in my diet

1172
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:06,680

1175
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,760
something else for my health that could

1176
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:15,200
