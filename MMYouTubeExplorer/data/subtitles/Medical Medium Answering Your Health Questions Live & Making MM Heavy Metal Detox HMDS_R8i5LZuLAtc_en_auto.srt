turning into to be something into a

9
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:30,720
bigger thing and a more crazier thing so

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,239
now it's not just a meat and greet like

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,160

26
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,880

reason why you got to break it up a

227

little bit is because there's no

don't realize it's these right here from

316
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:44,959
s so clearly nature says where do you

317
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:46,800
start with MCAS and you're reacting to

318
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:49,800
almost all

319
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:52,399
foods including most of the healing

320
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:56,120
foods I was doing great with medical

321
00:12:52,399 --> 00:13:00,480
medium and then um C rocked my world

322
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:01,720
with chronic shingles and MC s you know

323
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,800
with

324
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:08,040
okay you know what happens is that if C

325
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:10,040
rocked your world if you guys know what

326
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:12,320
I mean by C because even though

327
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:14,839
everybody's saying the word they're all

328
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,959
saying the word you know vovid vovid

329
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:18,920
vovid you know the word vovid vovid

330
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:21,519
they're always saying vovid vovid vovid

331
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:24,240
everybody's on the internet saying v v v

332
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:26,120
they're all saying that word right okay

333
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,199
do you see I'm not really saying that

334
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,680
word because they have nothing to worry

335
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:31,680
about but I do

336
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,240
I do have something to worry about even

337
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,240
though it's everywhere it's on all the

338
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:39,440
platforms and everybody V it V it it's

339
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:43,440
old news old news I still have to like

340
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:45,399
be careful and not see that word it's

341
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,880
crazy so back to the

342
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:51,360
Sea what happens with the sea is when

343
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:54,480
that sea finally dies off it can linger

344
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:57,279
in people too by the way and when it

345
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,399
finally dies off it produces a

346
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:01,199
tremendous amount of toxin if you're

347
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:03,639
somebody that's already chemical

348
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,759
sensitive and you're food sensitive and

349
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:07,079
this is important you guys if you're

350
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:09,440
food sensitive chemical sensitive

351
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:11,320
supplement sensitive you know with

352
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,560
anything you're just sensitive with

353
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,440
anything and everything and you don't

354
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,639
even know what why you're reacting or

355
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:19,079
where you're reacting and how it

356
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:22,720
works if you're somebody doing that and

357
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:26,440
you get C

358
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:28,880
bid and you get C what happens is though

359
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:30,839
c not only lowers the immune system cuz

360
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,440
it it it's in the body the immune

361
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:34,240
system's trying to get rid of it it's

362
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,399
trying to destroy it and the SE is

363
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,720
creating all this trouble right just

364
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:42,079
like the flu the flu does the same thing

365
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:44,759
it really creates a lot of problems it

366
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:50,360
breaks down the immune system but what

367
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:52,079
the flu and vit do and rs you know V and

368
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:55,880
all this what it

369
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:57,560
does is it produces poison and if you're

370
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,680
already chemical sensitive and you're

371
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,079
you've been recovering so you're

372
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:02,000
chemical sensitive person and you've

373
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:04,040
been recovering and you're doing good

374
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,800
and you're moving up the ladder and then

375
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:08,560
boom vit kicks you back knocks you back

376
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,199
a little bit Boom the flu knocks you

377
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,720
back a little bit boom RSV knocks you

378
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:16,519
back a little bit and lowers your your

379
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:20,160
immune system it's also going to produce

380
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:22,240
all this toxin tons of toxin it's going

381
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,720
to produce produce produce while it's

382
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,440
being killed too so as your immune

383
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,959
system's killing it it's going to

384
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:32,399
produce poison and toxin and when it

385
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:34,360
does that you're going to be more

386
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:37,040
chemical sensitive more supplement

387
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,839
sensitive more food sensitive more

388
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,959
sensitive more you know chemical

389
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:42,079
sensitive in the air sensitive for all

390
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:46,040
these other

391
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:48,360
reasons then because the sea the volid

392
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:50,600
knocked your immune system down because

393
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:53,800
RSV flu whatever knocked your immune

394
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:56,120
system down then the shingles Rises up

395
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:58,360
and now the shingles is moving up now

396
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:00,519
the herpes simplex one the cold sores

397
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:03,160
are popping out everywhere and then you

398
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:05,560
know herp Simplex two genital sores

399
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:07,519
popping out everywhere down here then

400
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,079
you know it's not just that and you know

401
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,319
next thing you know an epscene bar

402
00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:13,399
starts to come up creeping up giving you

403
00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:15,959
the chronic fatigue again next thing you

404
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:18,399
know the shingles you get a swash of

405
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:21,160
shingles here a swash of shingles here a

406
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:24,480
swash of shingles here or you get

407
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:26,839
shingles pain and nerve pain without

408
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:30,480
having the actual rash right all this

409
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:33,920
comes up because the flu and RSV and the

410
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:36,279
vulet all knocked down all knocked down

411
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,600
the immune system but produced a lot of

412
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:40,639
poison too and when it produced a lot of

413
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,600
poison you're now chemical sensitive

414
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,160
again you're now you're now supplement

415
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,120
sensitive you're now food sensitive you

416
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,319
don't know what to eat to do or what and

417
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,839
then on top of it if shingles started

418
00:16:48,319 --> 00:16:53,360
rising up and shingles started coming up

419
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:55,000
and you know um cyto virus started

420
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,279
coming up your herpes simplex one

421
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
started coming up started rising up cuz

422
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:01,360
your immune system was down kicked down

423
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,279
by vet kick down by flu whatever you

424
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,640
kick down by the sea what happens is

425
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:07,360
that you're as things are go getting

426
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,880
stronger like the the shingles and

427
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,160
everything and Epstein bars and all

428
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,240
that's getting

429
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:15,120
stronger then that's producing more

430
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,760
neurotoxin and more neurotoxin and more

431
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,640
neurotoxin now once again now you're

432
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,400
like crap not only am I chemical

433
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,400
sensitive supplement sensitive food

434
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,079
sensitive but now I'm really feeling

435
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,400
like wow out of whack and I don't know

436
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:28,199
what's going on I feel like I'm out of

437
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,400
whack so what happens is when that

438
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:32,480
shingles and those herpe viruses those

439
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,400
the herpetic family starts to rise up

440
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,240
and you got low grade infections and

441
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,679
they're rising up now they're producing

442
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,919
all this neurotoxin and now you're back

443
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,240
in the saddle again with this whole

444
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:42,039
thing and you're just like oh my God

445
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,520
what is this I'm back to being sensitive

446
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:46,440
again that's how it works but but but

447
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:52,600
but but have no

448
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:55,679
fear with time and caring learning

449
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:58,840
protocols right learning

450
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:01,080
protocols so many of them suppl

451
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:04,000
mentation protocols and so forth and all

452
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:06,159
of that you start fixing things as I

453
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,960
throw these books all around everywhere

454
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:10,320
when you're learning what to do you're

455
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:12,520
learning how to rebuild the immune

456
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:16,440
system that's total immune right there

457
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:18,360
every day every day it's like who's

458
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,000

488
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:26,799

neurotoxic rate there's ways of

494
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,799
recovering the SI the body system

495
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,280

less chemical sensitive less food

500
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:55,440
sensitive less supplement sensitive out

501
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:57,640
there in a whole bit a lot of people are

502
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,679
supplement sensitive because they did

503
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:03,919
the swallowing all the charcoal years

504
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:06,679
ago they did crazy liver flushes with

505
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:08,720
all the olive oil can't even tell you

506
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:11,840
how stupid that is it's unbelievable

507
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:14,480
what people have done out there okay

508
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,919
okay and that's the thing with a lot of

509
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,720
people they've tried they've done all

510
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:20,919
the fish oil gobbling down the fish oil

511
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,799
every day for so long they've done

512
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:24,679
garbage bulk

513
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,640
multivitamins with all kinds of

514
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:28,760
magnesium sterate and everything else

515
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:32,240
Under the Sun in it they've done a lot

516
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:34,320
of stuff that hindered their system

517
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,720
weakened their system made them

518
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,080
sensitive and that's a whole thing that

519
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,200
people don't realize when it comes down

520
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,679
to supplement

521
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:44,799

kinds of things they get sensitive later

they can get more chemical sensitive

555
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:06,760

00:22:54,559 --> 00:23:00,039
in your sinus cavity or something else

575
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:02,480

578
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:10,799
with sinuses why are you having a

579
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:14,000
post-nasal drip why are you having

580
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:17,279
sinusitis right so learning key pieces

581
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,640
to all of that and you know when I tell

582
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:21,520
doctor friends that come to me and

583
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,120
doctors that try to reach out to me I

584
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,400
talked to one recently by the way just

585
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,240
recing about all kinds of different

586
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:30,000
things I didn't talk about sinusitis but

587
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:33,279
we talked about UTI and stuff and it's

588
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,799
important to know what sinusitis is that

589
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:38,720
right there when the doctor doesn't know

590
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:41,039
what it is when the doctor doesn't know

591
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,919
why you have sinus sinusitis right they

592
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:47,000
just don't know a lot of people will

593
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:49,840
have bacteria that is Strep so the whole

594
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,080
strep family right strep bacteria

595
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:56,559
creates a sinusitis it creates UTI

596
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:59,000
conjunctive vitis it creates acne it

597
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:02,679
creates sore throats it creates ear

598
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,880
infections it creates otitis media it

599
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:07,240
creates all kinds of different stuff

600
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:10,400
conjunctivitis sty I know I said that

601
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:13,840
sty it creates all these things right

602
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:16,880
strep is behind so it's getting to the

603
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:19,840
underlying part of why you have the

604
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:22,559
sinusitis it's getting to the underlying

605
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:25,200
aspect and that's the key right there

606
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:27,240
and then what happens is the strep sits

607
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,360
inside the sinuses has a field day

608
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:31,039
because the immune systems low and when

609
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,520
your immune system is low the strep is

610
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:35,919
doing a dance inside the person's sinus

611
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,559
cavities and lymphatic system what I've

612
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,080
seen over the years is a lot of people

613
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:41,640
and not everybody not everybody but a

614
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:44,720
lot of people will have the acne along

615
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:48,919
with some sinusitis along with

616
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:50,640
mucus mucus forming spittle you know

617
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:52,960
just a mucus

618
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,000
congestion you know they'll have that

619
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,720
they'll have some acne they'll get some

620
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:01,080
ear stuff they'll get some eye stuff

621
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:04,840
they'll get all kinds of dry eyes their

622
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:07,799
eyes are so dry because their ducks are

623
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:10,679
clogged with strap and they don't know

624
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:12,840
it they got strep on their anus they got

625
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:14,600
strep in their mouth they don't know it

626
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:17,600
they got strep in their Ducks of their

627
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:20,360
eyes they got SHP in their ears they get

628
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,880
the sostis they their immune system's

629
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:25,399
low it may be battling one or two or

630
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:28,919
three different varieties of SHP and

631
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:30,120
people don't realize this so you know so

632
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:32,559
what do we do what do we do medical

633
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:34,799
medium books what do we have in here

634
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:39,360
we've got strep information in these

635
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:42,000
books strep protocols in these books

636
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:44,600
critical and in those protocols you'll

637
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,880
see something like zinc like use the

638
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:48,279
viery zinc just letting you know but you

639
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,399
know there's like you see things like

640
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:54,799
zinc in there and you see other things

641
00:25:50,399 --> 00:25:57,640
too you see other stuff golden seal but

642
00:25:54,799 --> 00:26:02,840
you see there's protocols right and then

643
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:04,720
Foods to avoid foods to avoid now listen

644
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:07,600
out of all this all the different

645
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:10,640
so-called modalities out there medical

646
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:13,480
medium information is probably one of

647
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:17,360
the more lenient when it comes down to

648
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:20,600
food okay probably one of the more

649
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:22,720
lenient but people heal because it's not

650
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,960
about taking away everybody's food quite

651
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,360
the contrary with medical Med

652
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:29,559
information there's people that quote

653
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:31,520
can only eat four blueberries before

654
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:33,880
they found medical medium

655
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,720
information they can only eat four

656
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:37,360
blueberries a day before they found

657
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,840
medical medium information they realize

658
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,919
they can eat way more blueberries and do

659
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,559
their healing and heal there's people

660
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,520
out there that couldn't touch a piece of

661
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:47,440
fruit were told stay away from banana

662
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:50,840
stay away from anything stay away from

663
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:53,039
oranges stay away from leafy greens

664
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:56,200
people being told that vegetables are

665
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:57,720
toxic and I still see that out there

666
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,760
there's ads running out there all the

667
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:02,159
time like your vegetables are toxic

668
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,799
don't eat any vegetables that's the

669
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,760
problem right there so how do people

670
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:08,399
heal but staying away from certain foods

671
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,720
can help with the sinusitis it can help

672
00:27:08,399 --> 00:27:11,760
with the strap and that's really

673
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:15,159
important right there Sapphire Rose on

674
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:18,200
YouTube can toxic heavy metals block you

675
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:21,360
spiritually and only allow you to

676
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:24,559
progress to a certain level of

677
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:27,520
Consciousness and manifestations okay so

678
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:30,039
okay toxic heavy metals can definitely

679
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:32,360
rain on somebody's parade on a lot of

680
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:36,480
levels it doesn't mean you never

681
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:39,120
spiritually grow but toxic heavy metals

682
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,600
can talk for you they can speak for you

683
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,880
that's why we're sitting here making

684
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:45,000
little detox

685
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:46,799
movie because I never want I would like

686
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,640
I would like this right now because I

687
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:51,919
never want metals to speak for me ever I

688
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:54,279
don't because if they were speaking for

689
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:58,880
me they'd probably be doing this yeah

690
00:27:54,279 --> 00:28:00,600
fish oil is great okay you know 20 15

691
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,880
fish oil is amazing take lots of fish

692
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:06,840

693
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:10,080
of olive oil 2017 make sure you do lots

694
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:12,240
of ionized alkaline water 2018 make sure

695
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:15,880
you cold plunge cold plunge that's the

696
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:18,519
answer 2019 make sure you do you do like

697
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:21,200
grounding Barefoot always be barefoot

698
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:23,039
2020 meanwhile you stay sick you stay

699
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:26,000
sick you stay sick I don't let metal

700
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:27,720
speak for me if they spoke for me people

701
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,960
would not be getting better out there I

702
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:31,960
can promise promise you that because I'd

703
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:35,159
probably hear so

704
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:39,279
wrong and I'd probably be listening to S

705
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:41,320
so and be like what did you say um what

706
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:42,600
um swimming's healthy for you is that

707
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,080
what you said or did you just say cold

708
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:47,039
plunging is healthy for you freeze your

709
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,559
butt off the point is is that yeah I

710
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:50,440
don't want Metals ever speaking for me

711
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:52,519
down the road as I get older and older

712
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:54,080
and older I don't want Metals talking

713
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:56,360
for me and that's what happens so with a

714
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,799
lot of people metals are talking for

715
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:01,360
them keep that in mind

716
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:03,840
they are and they get and what happens

717
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:06,559
is metals are speaking for them they can

718
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:09,200

metal detox smoothie since seven years

00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:13,360
thanks to you and I have begun studying

820
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:16,960
again at 61 years

821
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:22,440
old yeah the heavy metal

822
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:26,919
detox it clears someone it clears

823
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:28,679
them it's like a clearing over time is

824
00:33:26,919 --> 00:33:31,880
what it is

825
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:33,919
and yes toxic heavy metals speak for

826
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:36,000
people they make people break up in

827
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:37,360
relationships they make people say

828
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,679
things they shouldn't have said in a

829
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:42,000
relationship and regret it later they

830
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:44,600
make people like get really really

831
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,240
emotional and triggered so easy because

832
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,639
they got Metals getting in the way of

833
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,720
their neurons so they're receiving

834
00:33:47,639 --> 00:33:51,600
messages messages are leaving them in

835
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:54,480
ways that aren't as healthy as it could

836
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:57,360
be the heavy the heavy metals can

837
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:59,360
saturate into people's brains and

838
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:02,840
confuse use neurons and neurotransmitter

839
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:05,960
chemicals and and um and all of it

840
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:08,560
electrical impulses allowing somebody to

841
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:11,040
shift gears in a way that may not be

842
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:13,520
fruitful and helpful and then the metals

843
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:16,480
speak for people and it's really

844
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:18,520
difficult and that's okay that's okay

845
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:21,159
because we work on cleaning them up and

846
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:23,839
getting them out and getting them to go

847
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:26,320
away that's important right there so

848
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:28,040
keep that in mind anyway making a little

849
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:31,240
bit of a smoothie right here heav metal

850
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:34,079

851
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:36,800

September 7th for a meet and greet and

853
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:42,240
then it kind of turned into

854
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:44,919
something more in like Pure medical me

855
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:47,480
fashion we have to do something about it

856
00:34:44,919 --> 00:34:49,200
and that means there's an Afterparty and

857
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:51,520
I'm going to be most likely doing a

858
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:55,599
light blast on that day September

859
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:59,040
7th and in order to even go to the

00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:52,800
just smoothie it could be a smoothie

908
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:54,119
Bowl it can be a meal throughout the day

909
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,119
as long as you have the five key

910
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:58,040
ingredients to do the job that needs to

911
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:01,240
be done

912
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:02,720
the five key ingredients the spirulina

913
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,960
you got to have that the barley grass

914
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,880
juice powder you got to have that the

915
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:09,359
right the wild blueberries you got to

916
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:11,720
have that and the dols that's the liquid

917
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:14,640
dols right there um all right let me

918
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:17,440
just get some blueberries in here ooh

919
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:19,240
don't call them blueberries do not call

920
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,880
them blueberries these are wild

921
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:25,000
blueberries huge difference I just

922
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:27,640
insulted these wild blueberries by

923
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,480
calling them a blueberry

924
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:32,119
because there's a vast difference from

925
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:33,680
cultivated clamshell meaning like you

926
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:36,119
get the little pint-sized clam shell the

927
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:38,000
plastic clam shells at the store and

928
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:39,920
it's a cultivated blueberry it's not a

929
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:44,160
wild blueberry people use them all the

930
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:46,079
time they don't do a scratch compared to

931
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:48,800
the wild blueberry very important when

932
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:50,960
it comes down to doing the job Kelly

933
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:53,400
over there on YouTube that makes me tear

934
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,520
up your info has saved my life after

935
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:58,200
cancer thank you for being here Kelly

936
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:01,160
amazing and thank you for um just being

937
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:05,040
in the community oh my God over there on

938
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:07,960
YouTube Om I have so many doctors in my

939
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:11,040
family and they all have friends Etc but

940
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:14,119
none could help your truth Shines My

941
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:16,839
question is how effective is the vimergy

942
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:19,920
wbb powder wild blueberry powder versus

943
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:24,079
the frozen fruit love from Ireland so

944
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:26,079
here's what I do okay now all right so

945
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:27,560
keep this in mind right you got the

946
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:30,560
blueberries you got the wild blueberries

947
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:32,680
like the Wyman's company that I endorse

948
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:36,200
they're the ones that I use right for

949
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:39,119
the Frozen wild blueberry okay all right

950
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:42,000
and this is another wild blueberry that

951
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:44,400
comes from a different area on the

952
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,200
planet okay very important to know here

953
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:50,040
right I like

954
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:52,640
using like different wild blueberri so I

955
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:54,400
got this one here from viy which I'm

956
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,240
excited about and I showed you the no

957
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,040
anti-caking agents right how incredible

958
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:00,160
that is

959
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:01,800
and I like the Wyman's too and I'm going

960
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,760
to put a little bit of the Wyman's while

961
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:08,520
blueberry juice in there too

962
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:12,400
because every strain of wild

963
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:15,119
blueberry right is a little different

964
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:17,599
still holds power but it's a little

965
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:21,480
different that's how incredible it is

966
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:23,920
right the low Bush so this is the low

967
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:26,079
Bush wild blueberry it's really

968
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:28,800
incredible that we even have access to

969
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:31,079
this and I dream about that when I was

970
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:33,160
young I remember I was laying in a wild

971
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:34,920
Blueberry field low Bush wild Blueberry

972
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:37,240
field and I was doing that thing where

973
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:39,800
you ever you know where you go into the

974
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:41,800
snow and you do the angel thing in the

975
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:44,400
snow where you wave your arms and your

976
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:45,960
legs go out like this and your Fanning

977
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,640
right in the snow and you're laying on

978
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,920
your back and you're just doing right

979
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:51,920
you're just doing this while you're

980
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:53,520
laying on your back right you know and

981
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,640
you try to make your wings as big as you

982
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,839
want whatever and you're doing that

983
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:59,960
there okay well I

984
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:02,680
as a child would love laying in a wild

985
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:04,640
Blueberry field and S so would tell me

986
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:06,240
the power of the wild blueberry how

987
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,839
incredible it was and what it does for

988
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:11,720
the body and the antioxidant power it

989
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:13,520
has for the brain and nervous system and

990
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:15,079
for the everything for the immune system

991
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,960
right and then I would lay in the wild

992
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:19,240
blueberry fields and I would do the

993
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,040
whole Angel Fanning thing where I'd kind

994
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:22,599
of have my legs spreading and my arms

995
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,000
spreading and I would do like like that

996
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:26,200
in the field and then when I would get

997
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,240
up there'd be like an imprint of an

998
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:31,040
angel in the wild Blueberry Patch right

999
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:33,640
just like if you were doing that in the

1000
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:36,880
snow it's just incredible God I just

1001
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:38,680
love thinking about that all right so

1002
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,440
let's get some cilantro in here if you

1003
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:42,599
guys are okay with that so I'm going to

1004
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:45,040
pop a cup in here maybe a little bit

1005
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:48,319
more surprise surprise a little bit

1006
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:53,079
more but do you realize what I just did

1007
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:55,359
you guys know this right right um are

1008
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:58,280
you making dinner tonight would you like

1009
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:59,920
some cilantro on your f

1010
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:01,760
would you like some cilantro on your

1011
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,560
chicken if you're a chicken eater right

1012
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,000
would you like some cilantro on your

1013
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:07,839
avocado if you're an avocado eater right

1014
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,720
I'm having some cilantro for dinner

1015
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:12,319
tonight I eat cilantro I can have just a

1016
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:15,040
little bit of that right on my avocado

1017
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:17,760
little bit of that on my right my fish I

1018
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:20,599
could just do that okay but that's

1019
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:23,760
nothing compared to when you eat

1020
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:24,920
cilantro and you use it and the hmds is

1021
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,920
incredible because of the amount of

1022
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:30,040
cilantro that goes in there you're using

1023
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:32,920
this herb as a leafy green and man when

1024
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:35,560
you supersede greens by using a leafy

1025
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:39,240
green herb to this capacity that's

1026
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:43,720
another thing all on its own never mind

1027
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:46,720
the metal enhancement stuff that that

1028
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:49,319
cilantro does with removing Metals

1029
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:51,040
incredible so here we go all right so

1030
00:41:49,319 --> 00:41:53,640
let's move on a little bit I'm going to

1031
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:56,920
add just a little bit more I'm going to

1032
00:41:53,640 --> 00:42:00,000
do the wild blueberry powder I love this

1033
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:01,760
I love love seeing clumps love seeing

1034
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,720
big clumps in

1035
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:09,400
here if I don't see big clumps in here I

1036
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:13,440
will not be happy I want big fat clumps

1037
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:15,640
in this there's a reason for that okay

1038
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,520
no anti-caking agents you guys have to

1039
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,119
understand there people out there

1040
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:19,559
they're chemical sensitive and they're

1041
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:21,599
everything sensitive and they could be

1042
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:23,839
doing caking they could doing

1043
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:25,319
anti-caking agents and they don't even

1044
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:27,839
know it they're in every patter out

1045
00:42:25,319 --> 00:42:30,559
there no company does this

1046
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:32,640
this is different entirely different

1047
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:34,680
companies may say that they they don't

1048
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:37,280
do it they don't do it because it takes

1049
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:39,400
too much energy too much time too much

1050
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:42,319
money no one would do it anyway it's the

1051
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:44,400
five main ingredients that makes the

1052
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:46,400
difference that's what it is now if you

1053
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:50,079
got three out of five you got three out

1054
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:53,319
of five and I'll talk about that okay we

1055
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:55,359
got Boom the wild blueberry we knocked

1056
00:42:53,319 --> 00:42:58,079

00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:02,400
not everything is physical not

1144
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:04,240
everything is physical but I've seen

1145
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,119
people have those experiences where they

1146
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:08,400
feel that way and once they rid metals

1147
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:12,520
and other poisons and toxins they're

1148
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:15,920
feeling different feeling different you

1149
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:19,240
know and also I mean if someone had a

1150
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:20,960
childhood injury okay some bullying that

1151
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:23,119
happened in their life growing up or

1152
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,680
their family was abusive or they were

1153
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:27,240
they suffered mental abuse when they

1154
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:30,079
were a child or a teenager

1155
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:33,319
We're Young Adult and they suffered this

1156
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:35,680
okay it can hang on it can be wired into

1157
00:47:33,319 --> 00:47:37,480
those neurons and it it needs some

1158
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:41,200
healing and when it's wired into those

1159
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:43,359
neurons we have allergies like allergies

1160
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:45,599
to different people and different

1161
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:47,559
experiences and different words and all

1162
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:50,200
kinds of

1163
00:47:47,559 --> 00:47:52,119
stuff somebody can have emotional

1164
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:55,000
injuries to the brain that caused a

1165
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:57,359
little bit of scar tissue in the brain

1166
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:59,880
creating something like the feeling of

1167
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:02,680

information on heavy

1246
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:36,559
metals and the heavy metal

1247
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:40,480
detox was the

1248
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:42,960
Forefront still is but when it hit it

1249
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:44,240
was groundbreaking nobody even knew

1250
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,559
about any of the stuff like this or

1251
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:49,000
Metals what they do or anything like

1252
00:51:45,559 --> 00:51:51,000
that but what happened was my

1253
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,920
competitors my

1254
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:57,480

00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:10,960
medals and I want a piece of that my

1261
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:13,680

1262
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:15,880
medical medium information by saying out

detox doesn't have a

1332
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:56,040
binder okay and that's where the binder

1333
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:57,599
thing came out that's where it all kind

1334
00:54:56,040 --> 00:55:01,559
of like developed just in the health

1335
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:05,839
scene right now but guess what guess

1336
00:55:01,559 --> 00:55:08,200
what it is all binder baby it is all

1337
00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:10,200
binder that's how stupid the whole thing

1338
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:12,040
was but they made some Headway a little

1339
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:13,640
bit because they convinced enough people

1340
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:15,520
that they were doing something wrong

1341
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:17,280
because they needed a binder yeah they

1342
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:19,119
hurt those people because they use

1343
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,920
zeolites that actually weren't edible

1344
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:22,119
varieties of zeolite they were doing

1345
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:23,400
that they were doing charcoal and

1346
00:55:22,119 --> 00:55:25,000
damaging their Linings of their

1347
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:26,319
intestinal tract they were doing all

1348
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,440
kinds of things and they're con

1349
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:28,960
convincing people they needed these

1350
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:31,599
binders when they didn't because guess

1351
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:35,000
what the binder is built into the heavy

1352
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:36,640
metal detox that's right the binder is

1353
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:40,079
built in

1354
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:42,920
here the ultimate binders are in here

1355
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:45,920
that is the whole point it's there to

1356
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:48,520
grab on to junk and garbage and metals

1357
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:51,440
and stuff and poisons and pesticides and

1358
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:53,640
anything else it's there to bind onto it

1359
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:55,359
and take it out and if you read the

1360
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:56,839
medical medium books you'll see the

1361
00:55:55,359 --> 00:56:00,119
process in how it

1362
00:55:56,839 --> 00:56:02,559
works and it has Street Credibility man

1363
00:56:00,119 --> 00:56:05,000
it has street cred of saving people's

1364
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:06,559
lives of removing crap out of them so

1365
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,440
they could think clear and get their

1366
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:10,839
life back and rid their depression and

1367
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:13,119
everything else it is a

1368
00:56:10,839 --> 00:56:15,920
binder it is a

1369
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:18,680
binder but my

1370
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:20,880
competitors wanted to bank and they

1371
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:23,160
wanted to try to take me down so they

1372
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:25,200
pulled the binder game and they

1373
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:27,400
convinced a few people to be concerned

1374
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:30,559
about binders but those people were

1375
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:32,880
screwed over by them and that's what

1376
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:34,799
happened just line you're actually going

1557
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:51,160
something very

1558
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:51,160
important if you wear

1559
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:58,279
pants tells you a lot it's an old saying

1560
01:04:55,880 --> 01:05:00,359
that's been around for many many years

1561
01:04:58,279 --> 01:05:02,400
that person puts their pants on the same

1562
01:05:00,359 --> 01:05:06,119
way you do every single

1563
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:08,400
morning but it really tells you

1564
01:05:06,119 --> 01:05:10,119
something really important so no matter

1565
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:13,680
who you are on this planet or what

1566
01:05:10,119 --> 01:05:13,680
you're doing or anything else in

1567
01:05:14,359 --> 01:05:19,839
that anything else no matter what you do

1568
01:05:17,799 --> 01:05:21,460
looking up to somebody on this planet or

1569
01:05:19,839 --> 01:05:23,440
looking down to somebody else on this

1570
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:25,400
[Music]

1571
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:28,920
