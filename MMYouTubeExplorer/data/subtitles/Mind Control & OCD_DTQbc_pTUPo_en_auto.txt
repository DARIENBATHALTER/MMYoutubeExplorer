[10.08 - 14.72] you're getting those metals out

[14.72 - 18.64] metals live
[15.52 - 19.92] in you rent free i said something
[18.64 - 22.96] yesterday that
[19.92 - 26.72] i haven't talked in depth about before
[22.96 - 28.80] and it's the mind control that metals do
[26.72 - 30.72] when they're in the brain when someone's
[28.80 - 34.24] severely depressed
[30.72 - 36.56] it changes and shapes their life
[34.24 - 38.72] when they're severely depressed because
[36.56 - 41.20] from an unknown origin of depression not
[38.72 - 42.96] just because they had a great loss or
[41.20 - 44.56] something tragic happened and they're
[42.96 - 46.08] depressed because of that or they're
[44.56 - 49.52] suffering from depression
[46.08 - 51.28] from you know maybe maybe a relationship
[49.52 - 52.88] breakup or anything like that that's
[51.28 - 54.08] different those things happen in life we
[52.88 - 56.56] know that right
[54.08 - 57.76] and then we know why that depression is
[56.56 - 60.72] connected right
[57.76 - 62.64] but what about the millions and millions
[60.72 - 63.36] hundreds of millions of people on planet
[62.64 - 65.04] earth
[63.36 - 67.20] that are suffering from sadness that's
[65.04 - 68.96] unexplained depression that's
[67.20 - 71.12] unexplained
[68.96 - 72.80] mega depression the kind where they
[71.12 - 73.84] can't function can't do anything can't
[72.80 - 76.40] get out of bed
[73.84 - 78.40] can't make decisions can't can't get
[76.40 - 79.52] empowered can't just move forward in
[78.40 - 81.20] their life right
[79.52 - 84.00] and that depression is because of those
[81.20 - 87.04] toxic heavy metals inside the brain
[84.00 - 90.00] and what that means right there those
[87.04 - 91.84] metals do a lot when they give us our
[90.00 - 93.76] symptoms and our conditions when they
[91.84 - 95.76] give us that social anxiety when they
[93.76 - 98.08] give us that nervousness
[95.76 - 99.68] when we're sweating for no reason but we
[98.08 - 100.80] just think it's because we're a nervous
[99.68 - 103.68] type
[100.80 - 104.88] you know you're a nervous type you know
[103.68 - 106.64] that's why you're sweating
[104.88 - 109.12] that's why your palms are soaking wet
[106.64 - 110.88] and your your pits are drenched and
[109.12 - 112.48] just going up to talk to somebody and
[110.88 - 113.60] you're sweating and you're nervous about
[112.48 - 115.20] anything
[113.60 - 117.04] and you're getting you're even tremoring
[115.20 - 118.16] with it that nervousness that's from
[117.04 - 119.84] metals
[118.16 - 121.92] that's what that is it's not that you're
[119.84 - 125.04] someone that's a super nervous type
[121.92 - 127.84] no the metals actually shape who we
[125.04 - 130.32] are in so many ways and that's what
[127.84 - 133.52] metals do metals cause adhd
[130.32 - 136.72] they cause brain fog they cause autism
[133.52 - 138.80] they shape who we are in many ways
[136.72 - 140.48] and no one wants to talk about it no one
[138.80 - 142.00] ever wants to know about it that's just
[140.48 - 143.44] the way it works conventional medicine
[142.00 - 144.88] forget it they don't want to go near
[143.44 - 146.32] metals net metals or in all the

[323.68 - 329.28] and this is a special time so
[326.88 - 330.88] let me cover a couple of topics that are
[329.28 - 333.52] really important okay
[330.88 - 335.04] so what metals do is create a mind
[333.52 - 338.40] control situation
[335.04 - 341.04] and the powers that be in the industries
[338.40 - 342.16] partly know this you know i talk about
[341.04 - 343.92] the mercury man
[342.16 - 345.52] the mercury man i've talked about that
[343.92 - 346.32] in the past books the medical medium
[345.52 - 350.16] books
[346.32 - 353.60] the mercury man is an is an ancient
[350.16 - 355.36] industrial figure that has been making
[353.60 - 359.04] sure that mercury
[355.36 - 362.00] is in our lives in a negative way
[359.04 - 364.48] it always has been it goes long before
[362.00 - 366.48] your time long before your parents time
[364.48 - 368.64] long before their parents time
[366.48 - 370.08] generation after generation it goes back
[368.64 - 372.64] a long way
[370.08 - 373.20] and the mercury man is the mercury
[372.64 - 374.72] industry
[373.20 - 376.56] in the mercury industry is one of the
[374.72 - 377.60] most powerful industries probably in the
[376.56 - 380.48] world that makes
[377.60 - 382.32] the caffeine industry look like a joke
[380.48 - 383.68] really and the caffeine industry is a
[382.32 - 385.20] powerhouse because
[383.68 - 387.52] they're also in the mind control
[385.20 - 389.12] business too caffeine industry
[387.52 - 390.72] the job of the caffeine industry is to
[389.12 - 392.40] make sure that mommy's in every
[390.72 - 394.24] and every baby on the planet gets
[392.40 - 395.36] addicted to caffeine that's the caffeine
[394.24 - 397.36] industry's role
[395.36 - 399.12] and caffeine industries role is to make
[397.36 - 400.72] sure that big pharma uses caffeine in
[399.12 - 402.16] every drug and they do by the way
[400.72 - 403.68] they just don't list it in ninety
[402.16 - 405.36] percent of the drugs but caffeine's in
[403.68 - 405.92] every single drug that big pharma does
[405.36 - 407.44] right
[405.92 - 408.96] so the mind controls the caffeine
[407.44 - 412.16] industry but the mercury
[408.96 - 412.80] industry is the quiet evil large
[412.16 - 414.72] industry
[412.80 - 417.52] powerful industry that if you got to
[414.72 - 418.16] think about a a silo a rice to a grain
[417.52 - 421.12] of rice
[418.16 - 422.48] right the caffeine industry and big
[421.12 - 425.68] pharma
[422.48 - 428.80] is like this this tiny little grain
[425.68 - 429.92] of rice the mercury man in the mercury
[428.80 - 433.44] industry
[429.92 - 435.04] is this silo of rice that's the size
[433.44 - 436.72] it's like it's like the richest people
[435.04 - 437.52] in the world you you'll see the richest
[436.72 - 439.92] people in the world
[437.52 - 441.60] publicly right you'll think oh whoa hey
[439.92 - 442.24] wait a minute let me just look this up
[441.60 - 444.16] forbes or
[442.24 - 445.44] let me just look up the richest person
[444.16 - 447.92] in the world is this no
[445.44 - 449.36] it's not the richest people in the world
[447.92 - 452.88] aren't listed
[449.36 - 454.32] they're trillionaires not billionaires
[452.88 - 457.20] the richest people in the world that
[454.32 - 458.88] control the world are trillionaires
[457.20 - 461.44] so it's important to know the difference
[458.88 - 464.64] right and that's the illumination
[461.44 - 467.84] they're the trillionaires and then euro
[464.64 - 470.00] and then when you're a billionaire right
[467.84 - 471.84] you're the top billionaire you're just
[470.00 - 474.48] kind of like a public
[471.84 - 476.40] you know you're just like that public uh
[474.48 - 478.72] facade for others like oh that's the
[476.40 - 480.72] richest person in the world no it's not
[478.72 - 482.64] it's no it's not there's richer people
[480.72 - 484.80] in the world that controlled world war
[482.64 - 485.92] ii they're trillionaires now they
[484.80 - 487.92] controlled world war
[485.92 - 489.28] one and they're they were grandfathered
[487.92 - 491.12] in they controlled world war
[489.28 - 492.56] ii they controlled the wars they control
[491.12 - 494.16] everything they're the they're the
[492.56 - 495.44] richest people in the world they're
[494.16 - 496.72] trillionaires right
[495.44 - 498.56] you don't hear about them because you
[496.72 - 500.40] won't and they're the ones that pull
[498.56 - 501.04] strings you know and the mercury man is
[500.40 - 504.08] in that
[501.04 - 505.52] category it's not in the caffeine
[504.08 - 508.72] caffeines
[505.52 - 512.24] a mind control big industry right but
[508.72 - 514.88] the mercury industry is oh my god
[512.24 - 516.64] you couldn't even imagine what that is
[514.88 - 518.40] that's a difference so
[516.64 - 520.16] and that mercury industry is in
[518.40 - 522.56] everybody's head
[520.16 - 523.28] it's in our head it's in our brains so
[522.56 - 525.60] it's the
[523.28 - 528.16] tourette's it's the spasms it's the
[525.60 - 530.88] ticks that's mercury in the brain
[528.16 - 531.92] so my hey my son has tourette's my son
[530.88 - 534.32] has mercury
[531.92 - 536.24] in his brain my daughter has tourettes
[534.32 - 537.76] my daughter has mercury in her brain
[536.24 - 539.68] my son has severe depression and he
[537.76 - 540.32] almost committed suicide some mercury in
[539.68 - 541.76] his brain
[540.32 - 543.60] my daughter has severe depression she
[541.76 - 544.64] almost committed suicide it's mercury in
[543.60 - 546.56] her brain
[544.64 - 548.72] this is serious depersonalization
[546.56 - 550.64] parkinson's disease alzheimer's dementia
[548.72 - 552.80] mercury mercury mercury and these are
[550.64 - 555.36] just some of the things that ocd
[552.80 - 557.76] ocd's crypto link i remember i did an
[555.36 - 561.20] ocb thing a while back
[557.76 - 564.16] and i think i did the ocd post right
[561.20 - 566.24] and and all of a sudden i got attacked
[564.16 - 568.24] right by all these ocd trolls right
[566.24 - 570.32] and it was just coming left and right by
[568.24 - 570.72] the thousands it was unbelievable
[570.32 - 573.44] there's
[570.72 - 574.00] thousands and thousands of ocd trolls
[573.44 - 576.24] saying
[574.00 - 578.08] how dare i say that ocd is caused by
[576.24 - 580.00] toxic heavy metals how dare i and
[578.08 - 581.04] they're just coming by the thousands you
[580.00 - 584.24] guys
[581.04 - 587.28] thousands literally in three days time
[584.24 - 588.80] eight or ten thousand uh ocd trolls you
[587.28 - 591.68] don't know ocd
[588.80 - 592.40] uh i'm dr so-and-so i'm nutritionist
[591.68 - 594.40] so-and-so
[592.40 - 595.60] i've got ocd and you don't even know
[594.40 - 598.24] it's not metals
[595.60 - 599.28] and it's like oh my god ocd's caused by
[598.24 - 602.16] metals
[599.28 - 602.88] that's what it's caused by it is always
[602.16 - 606.08] will be
[602.88 - 609.12] it was it is now it's always going to be
[606.08 - 610.88] and so it's these metals
[609.12 - 613.52] i remember talking to somebody many
[610.88 - 615.20] years ago right who had ocd really bad
[613.52 - 618.56] really bad there's different kinds of
[615.20 - 621.76] ocd and there's different levels of ocd
[618.56 - 624.24] right so and one person that
[621.76 - 626.32] their ocd was was was their head even
[624.24 - 628.24] connected to their body
[626.32 - 629.76] so she believed her head wasn't
[628.24 - 630.32] connected to her body she would have to
[629.76 - 631.68] be
[630.32 - 633.92] she'd have to be in front of a mirror
[631.68 - 635.76] all the time and then that ocd would
[633.92 - 637.68] calm down when she'd see her head on top
[635.76 - 639.44] of her body in the mirror
[637.68 - 640.72] and then she would be away from there
[639.44 - 642.56] for a little while trying to function
[640.72 - 643.52] and then the ocd would kick up ocd would
[642.56 - 644.96] kick up and all of a sudden
[643.52 - 647.20] because you'd have to go and find the
[644.96 - 648.64] mirror again to make sure her head was
[647.20 - 650.88] attached to her body
[648.64 - 652.72] that was that kind of ocd there's people
[650.88 - 654.64] that i've known somebody that was
[652.72 - 656.72] that would drive to work and they would
[654.64 - 658.08] just hit a pothole in the in the road
[656.72 - 659.76] and then they're worried they ran over
[658.08 - 660.00] somebody or something so they'd have to
[659.76 - 661.36] go
[660.00 - 662.88] all the way around and they would be
[661.36 - 664.08] late for work because they'd have to go
[662.88 - 665.20] all the way around and drive down the
[664.08 - 666.64] road to make sure they didn't hit
[665.20 - 668.16] something and that something isn't still
[666.64 - 669.44] on the road and they'd go back around
[668.16 - 670.88] and back around and back around
[669.44 - 672.64] and they'd be an hour late for work
[670.88 - 675.84] every morning and then get fired
[672.64 - 678.48] excessive compulsive disorder is real
[675.84 - 679.68] and i mean i've seen it all in the 35
[678.48 - 681.52] years and then the thoughts
[679.68 - 683.12] thoughts are another thing too
[681.52 - 684.96] repetitive thoughts and the thoughts and
[683.12 - 686.96] thoughts and nothing can soothe it and
[684.96 - 687.76] not just the thoughts but the taking
[686.96 - 690.00] action
[687.76 - 691.76] that's when ocd gets really really bad
[690.00 - 692.88] not just the thoughts but the action
[691.76 - 694.40] taking right
[692.88 - 695.84] like did i close your refrigerator did i
[694.40 - 696.96] close it it closed well i can't sleep

[701.20 - 704.64] 10 at 10 p.m at night
[703.04 - 706.08] and the thoughts of going to die like
[704.64 - 707.92] you know am i gonna die or if i say
[706.08 - 709.44] something wrong someone's gonna die
[707.92 - 711.04] and it's something bad gonna happen and
[709.44 - 712.80] it and goes on and on that's mercury
[711.04 - 713.60] that's the mercury man the mercury man
[712.80 - 717.76] has
[713.60 - 720.48] tremendous power over mind control
[717.76 - 722.16] over mind control over the human race
[720.48 - 726.24] that's the mercury man
[722.16 - 727.68] okay and you know
[726.24 - 730.16] let's go into this a little bit deeper
[727.68 - 732.40] in a whole bit

[742.24 - 746.40] so i'm going to talk in a little bit
[744.24 - 748.40] about how ocd works how
[746.40 - 750.00] electrical impulses hit heavy metals in
[748.40 - 751.04] the brain but i want to get started at
[750.00 - 753.44] least on lemon water

[832.96 - 837.20] 16 to 32 ounces of lemon water hydrate
[835.44 - 838.72] in the morning what happens is hydration
[837.20 - 841.20] is important because how do you get
[838.72 - 842.88] anything out of the body that's toxic
[841.20 - 844.88] how do you get anything out of the body
[842.88 - 848.00] that's toxic
[844.88 - 851.52] when you're not hydrated
[848.00 - 855.52] 16 to 32 ounces of lemon water not hot
[851.52 - 857.12] not hot water right
[855.52 - 858.72] medical medium information started the
[857.12 - 860.88] whole flushing the liver with
[858.72 - 863.28] lemon water that's original information
[860.88 - 864.88] from medical medium right
[863.28 - 867.20] and then all of a sudden years later
[864.88 - 868.80] years later i do the lemon in hot water
[867.20 - 871.36] because someone
[868.80 - 872.32] you know you know someone shifted gears
[871.36 - 874.24] out there and
[872.32 - 875.76] the trending world and we're like oh
[874.24 - 877.68] okay let's let's
[875.76 - 879.44] ruin something that originally that
[877.68 - 881.12] originally comes from medical medium
[879.44 - 882.72] spirit of compassion let's destroy it
[881.12 - 884.80] and let's make sure now it's hot water
[882.72 - 887.84] so no one benefits from it
[884.80 - 889.44] the details matter it matters okay
[887.84 - 891.28] and it's not eight to twelve ounces of
[889.44 - 892.96] lemon water some people do a cup of
[891.28 - 894.64] lemon water and make sure it's hot and
[892.96 - 896.16] they got their lemon in there ah they
[894.64 - 899.04] did it okay this is great
[896.16 - 901.12] no in order to flush the liver in order
[899.04 - 903.28] to flush the liver and body of toxins
[901.12 - 904.72] has to be lemon water that hasn't been
[903.28 - 908.56] killed off
[904.72 - 912.32] it has to be raw not cooked lemon
[908.56 - 915.68] raw lemon details matter
[912.32 - 916.72] and it's that raw lemon and the 16 to 32
[915.68 - 919.60] ounces of water
[916.72 - 922.32] that makes the wheels go around okay
[919.60 - 924.32] really important
[922.32 - 926.64] we're going to cover that i'm going to
[924.32 - 927.92] cover lots of stuff so we got the 16 32
[926.64 - 930.00] ounces of lemon water
[927.92 - 931.76] that's the first thing an empty stomach
[930.00 - 933.36] so let's head into
[931.76 - 935.12] running some celery through if you guys
[933.36 - 936.64] just came on here we're talking about
[935.12 - 937.68] mind control we're talking about the
[936.64 - 939.76] mercury man
[937.68 - 941.20] we're talking about things like ocd talk
[939.76 - 942.40] about tourette's too we'll talk about
[941.20 - 943.76] all the different stuff depression
[942.40 - 945.52] anxiety we're going to talk about how
[943.76 - 948.80] metals work in the brain
[945.52 - 950.64] how how metal interacts with electricity
[948.80 - 951.44] so that's important to know all on its
[950.64 - 952.96] own
[951.44 - 954.56] we're going to talk about how the five
[952.96 - 956.56] ingredients work in the heavy metal
[954.56 - 957.44] detox smoothie and the heavy metal detox
[956.56 - 959.92] cleanse that
[957.44 - 961.52] that makes it all happen we're gonna
[959.92 - 964.40] talk about that how cool
[961.52 - 965.36] how cool i'm excited i'm gonna do a
[964.40 - 969.28] little quick
[965.36 - 970.96] uh celery run you guys don't mind
[969.28 - 972.96] because this is the second part of the
[970.96 - 973.76] cleanse get some celery juice going
[972.96 - 978.16] right
[973.76 - 978.16] looking around okay
[978.80 - 985.76] here we are
[983.76 - 988.48] get a little celery juice now celery
[985.76 - 991.92] juice is critical because
[988.48 - 994.56] this is a complete electrolyte
[991.92 - 996.00] what that means a complete electrolyte
[994.56 - 1000.00] just so you guys know
[996.00 - 1000.00] is it means it goes to the brain
[1002.72 - 1011.84] every single part of the brain
[1006.52 - 1011.84] neurotransmitter clio cells neurons
[1011.92 - 1015.92] left hemisphere right hemisphere
[1016.16 - 1025.60] complete electrolyte doesn't get stopped
[1021.76 - 1028.72] we eat food and we drink drink
[1025.60 - 1031.76] to get an electrolyte somewhere
[1028.72 - 1033.44] in our body functioning working getting
[1031.76 - 1035.52] it to our nervous system and brain
[1033.44 - 1036.72] that's why we eat it's part of why we
[1035.52 - 1040.00] eat we're
[1036.72 - 1042.24] gathering electrolytes celery juice is a
[1040.00 - 1045.60] complete electrolyte
[1042.24 - 1047.20] it helps dislodge metals it's not a
[1045.60 - 1049.76] metal remover
[1047.20 - 1050.80] but it will flush metals out that have
[1049.76 - 1052.48] been removed
[1050.80 - 1054.56] by like say the heavy metal detox
[1052.48 - 1058.48] smoothie
[1054.56 - 1058.48] but what the celery does
[1058.96 - 1065.52] is it helps to loosen metals
[1062.08 - 1069.20] so they pop out easier
[1065.52 - 1072.57] mercury lead aluminum cadmium
[1069.20 - 1074.08] nickel arsenic calcium
[1072.57 - 1077.60] [Music]
[1074.08 - 1081.04] toxic calcium which is a
[1077.60 - 1085.12] toxic heavy metal
[1081.04 - 1087.68] interesting right that's interesting
[1085.12 - 1089.36] medical medium information classified
[1087.68 - 1092.72] aluminum as being a heavy metal
[1089.36 - 1092.72] you guys just so you know
[1093.12 - 1096.88] science doesn't believe aluminum is a
[1095.28 - 1097.76] heavy metal they'll say it's a light
[1096.88 - 1099.68] metal so
[1097.76 - 1103.16] medical medium you're so wrong you you
[1099.68 - 1107.20] included aluminum in there
[1103.16 - 1110.40] classification of a toxic heavy metal
[1107.20 - 1114.00] is the damage it does neurotoxically
[1110.40 - 1117.44] to the brain or the damage it does
[1114.00 - 1120.72] to the body that constitutes a toxic
[1117.44 - 1123.84] heavy metal a reclassified aluminum
[1120.72 - 1126.40] purposely i did it years ago
[1123.84 - 1128.56] because does this make sense to you well
[1126.40 - 1130.00] aluminum is not a toxic heavy metal it's
[1128.56 - 1131.68] not a heavy metal it's a light metal so
[1130.00 - 1133.36] we shouldn't worry about it
[1131.68 - 1134.88] let's make sure we get lots of aluminum
[1133.36 - 1136.16] in our brains and body let's make sure
[1134.88 - 1138.80] aluminum
[1136.16 - 1140.64] does that make aluminum safe to you no
[1138.80 - 1141.68] we have to classify it as a heavy metal
[1140.64 - 1143.12] we have no choice
[1141.68 - 1144.64] or no one's going to take aluminum
[1143.12 - 1146.80] series when it's actually a dangerous
[1144.64 - 1151.20] metal
[1146.80 - 1154.56] i just bought your book from amazon
[1151.20 - 1155.92] and i don't read books can i just say
[1154.56 - 1160.64] i'm honored
[1155.92 - 1164.08] for real can i say i'm honored

[1170.64 - 1174.48] what it's about
[1171.66 - 1176.08] [Music]

[1176.08 - 1181.04] every opportunity to better your life
[1178.48 - 1182.96] don't add anything to your celery juice
[1181.04 - 1183.28] i know i sound like a broken record but
[1182.96 - 1186.48] no
[1183.28 - 1189.68] ice no ice cubes no water no
[1186.48 - 1190.72] lemon juice my god talking about
[1189.68 - 1192.40] annoying
[1190.72 - 1194.00] you want to know what annoying is you're
[1192.40 - 1195.36] sitting there spending years trying to
[1194.00 - 1196.96] get the celery juice out there in the
[1195.36 - 1197.68] world so people can get their life back
[1196.96 - 1199.28] and then
[1197.68 - 1201.92] somebody in the health industry is just
[1199.28 - 1203.44] like oh add lemon to your celery juice
[1201.92 - 1204.56] and everybody's adding lemon to it and
[1203.44 - 1206.00] i'm like okay you're not getting
[1204.56 - 1207.52] benefits you're not getting benefits
[1206.00 - 1208.57] you're not getting benefits huh what a
[1207.52 - 1209.12] waste
[1208.57 - 1210.64] [Applause]
[1209.12 - 1214.32] [Music]
[1210.64 - 1216.08] i mean you if you sometimes you can't
[1214.32 - 1218.96] help people if you want to help them i
[1216.08 - 1222.24] mean you can do it i mean
[1218.96 - 1225.76] there's just so much in the way right
[1222.24 - 1228.96] so much in the way renata says
[1225.76 - 1232.16] renatabanada says aw is it okay to chop
[1228.96 - 1232.96] and trim my celery stalks before i put
[1232.16 - 1236.48] them
[1232.96 - 1240.16] in a bowl of with warm water
[1236.48 - 1241.52] and do so i i would probably i wouldn't
[1240.16 - 1242.16] chop them if you're gonna do i would
[1241.52 - 1244.32] probably give them
[1242.16 - 1245.20] you know what i would wash them whole
[1244.32 - 1246.88] first
[1245.20 - 1248.80] and get some of the dirt out heavier
[1246.88 - 1250.40] stuff out or anything any kind of dirt
[1248.80 - 1251.60] around and dirt in the inside stocks
[1250.40 - 1253.92] right i'd probably
[1251.60 - 1254.80] wash that out a little bit first before
[1253.92 - 1256.56] i chopped
[1254.80 - 1258.48] and and did you know i'd do the little
[1256.56 - 1260.08] dish soap in that point right
[1258.48 - 1262.32] natural dips dish up a little bit in the
[1260.08 - 1263.84] bowl in the whole form at least for a
[1262.32 - 1265.12] little bit and then chop it after and
[1263.84 - 1266.40] give it another rinse if you wanted to
[1265.12 - 1268.56] the reason why i don't like to chop it
[1266.40 - 1270.48] up in pieces and small pieces
[1268.56 - 1272.72] you chop it up in small pieces and put
[1270.48 - 1274.24] in a bowl you're losing celery juice in
[1272.72 - 1275.60] between all those chops
[1274.24 - 1277.52] and it's in there and you're kind of
[1275.60 - 1277.92] like it's kind of like bleeding out you
[1277.52 - 1280.96] know
[1277.92 - 1283.84] it's kind of like bleeding out
[1280.96 - 1285.12] all right can we do a i see another
[1283.84 - 1286.64] question i want to answer questions to
[1285.12 - 1287.92] you guys i don't want to just talk over
[1286.64 - 1291.28] you guys
[1287.92 - 1293.04] susan says can we do this on a budget
[1291.28 - 1294.56] watching the amount of celery you are
[1293.04 - 1297.12] using and adding
[1294.56 - 1299.44] up the money does it have to be organic
[1297.12 - 1300.72] well first of all the juicer i used cuts
[1299.44 - 1303.76] the celery bill in half
[1300.72 - 1305.76] so that's the mm-900 hds it's an
[1303.76 - 1307.28] investment right it's a it's a couple
[1305.76 - 1308.96] hundred dollars or if it's on sale it's
[1307.28 - 1312.48] 200 and something dollars
[1308.96 - 1314.24] but um but susan so the juicer i had
[1312.48 - 1316.56] actually squeezes more juice out of the
[1314.24 - 1317.52] celery so the pulp is really dry you get
[1316.56 - 1320.80] more juice so
[1317.52 - 1323.44] that alone can can cut the celery juice
[1320.80 - 1325.20] bill down a lot so then eventually you
[1323.44 - 1326.64] pay for the juicer by doing that and
[1325.20 - 1327.52] then whatever in the whole bit it's
[1326.64 - 1331.04] awesome
[1327.52 - 1333.20] okay that's one two is um
[1331.04 - 1334.88] yeah you can use conventional celery now
[1333.20 - 1337.04] i get punished for that
[1334.88 - 1338.88] i can't tell you how many lashings i get
[1337.04 - 1340.64] right that's one of one of the areas i
[1338.88 - 1342.72] get lashed really bad
[1340.64 - 1345.04] is the whole conventional celery thing
[1342.72 - 1346.00] so people do posts about me out there
[1345.04 - 1348.16] they do posts
[1346.00 - 1349.76] they do articles they try to rip me down
[1348.16 - 1351.76] all the time it's just it's i guess it's
[1349.76 - 1352.80] just 24 7 thing out there so one of the
[1351.76 - 1356.08] ways they do it is
[1352.80 - 1357.04] he likes conventional celery celery is
[1356.08 - 1359.68] on the top
[1357.04 - 1360.16] you know the top the top 12 or top 10
[1359.68 - 1362.80] you know
[1360.16 - 1365.28] most pesticide radiant crops they say
[1362.80 - 1368.16] out there but what they don't realize
[1365.28 - 1369.44] is that it's there isn't a top ten
[1368.16 - 1372.88] pesticide
[1369.44 - 1374.72] ridden crop there isn't top ten anything
[1372.88 - 1376.48] conventional is practically spray the
[1374.72 - 1377.36] amount it's a schedule of three times a
[1376.48 - 1378.88] week
[1377.36 - 1380.64] one of the most difficult things i run
[1378.88 - 1382.00] into is how nobody knows anything about
[1380.64 - 1383.52] farming that writes these things and
[1382.00 - 1384.96] tries to attack people so
[1383.52 - 1386.48] here you are you're trying to attack not
[1384.96 - 1388.00] you but the people will try to attack me
[1386.48 - 1392.00] and say he supports conventional
[1388.00 - 1392.40] celery and and it's the the top spray
[1392.00 - 1395.76] crop
[1392.40 - 1398.64] no it's not there's only
[1395.76 - 1400.24] all conventional crops of all foods
[1398.64 - 1402.80] conventional foods
[1400.24 - 1404.64] outside maybe a couple are sprayed on a
[1402.80 - 1406.08] schedule of three times a week
[1404.64 - 1407.84] that means broccoli that means
[1406.08 - 1409.60] everything conventional everything
[1407.84 - 1411.68] conventionally zucchini conventional
[1409.60 - 1414.00] cucumber conventional tomato
[1411.68 - 1417.60] they're sprayed three times a week it's
[1414.00 - 1420.08] the schedule for all conventional crops
[1417.60 - 1421.84] so they'll say they'll say hey you know
[1420.08 - 1423.04] he supports conventional celery it's on
[1421.84 - 1425.76] the top ten
[1423.04 - 1426.96] there's no top ten they're all sprayed
[1425.76 - 1428.96] three times a week
[1426.96 - 1430.16] just like organic produce is sprayed
[1428.96 - 1432.32] three times a week
[1430.16 - 1434.48] an organic produce is sprayed with the
[1432.32 - 1436.16] msg nicotine spray
[1434.48 - 1438.72] right that's what they do so they use
[1436.16 - 1439.92] the msg caffeine nicotine spray
[1438.72 - 1441.52] and that's what's sprayed because those
[1439.92 - 1443.68] are neuroantagonists so that's what's
[1441.52 - 1444.08] sprayed on all the organic crops you got
[1443.68 - 1447.84] to wash
[1444.08 - 1451.20] both both for one both foods right
[1447.84 - 1452.40] but the the whole thing is that celery
[1451.20 - 1456.00] conventional celery
[1452.40 - 1458.72] you got to wash it and yeah it outweighs
[1456.00 - 1460.64] what residue is inside that celery when
[1458.72 - 1461.76] it's conventional so definitely i
[1460.64 - 1463.76] support you
[1461.76 - 1465.60] if you do conventional celery a hundred
[1463.76 - 1467.44] percent because that celery juice
[1465.60 - 1469.28] is gonna be fixing things in you and
[1467.44 - 1471.04] cleaning out things in you more so than
[1469.28 - 1473.04] what's on that celery
[1471.04 - 1474.56] it's going to be cleaning out and fixing
[1473.04 - 1476.56] you and getting you better
[1474.56 - 1478.08] that conventional celery i mean this is
[1476.56 - 1480.96] just common sense stuff
[1478.08 - 1482.24] really this information but it shows you
[1480.96 - 1483.76] the alternative movement
[1482.24 - 1486.48] nobody really knows anything about
[1483.76 - 1488.40] anything and it's really sad
[1486.48 - 1490.56] anyway we just did some celery juice you
[1488.40 - 1492.00] guys if you just got on here this is an
[1490.56 - 1493.36] interesting one you don't want to miss
[1492.00 - 1494.56] we're talking about mind control and
[1493.36 - 1496.40] we're talking about some other things
[1494.56 - 1498.88] too electricity in the brain
[1496.40 - 1499.44] all of it and we're juicing celery too
[1498.88 - 1500.48] but
[1499.44 - 1502.80] and we're gonna make some stuff
[1500.48 - 1504.48] hopefully if we got a chance so this is
[1502.80 - 1505.92] day two the medical medium heavy metal
[1504.48 - 1507.68] detox cleanse challenge
[1505.92 - 1509.12] just gotta remind you once again you
[1507.68 - 1510.00] guys you've got to have the cleanse to
[1509.12 - 1513.12] heal book
[1510.00 - 1516.88] it's on sale in amazon.com us uh
[1513.12 - 1517.76] 51 off this book specifically is so low
[1516.88 - 1519.68] there
[1517.76 - 1521.36] i i don't know if somebody at amazon
[1519.68 - 1523.12] just you know just doesn't want me to
[1521.36 - 1524.80] keep the lights on or whatever it is but
[1523.12 - 1526.24] they got this thing priced so low and i
[1524.80 - 1528.32] love it because i know that even though
[1526.24 - 1529.84] it costs more to print it i just know
[1528.32 - 1531.20] that people are getting an opportunity
[1529.84 - 1532.88] to heal and i love that
[1531.20 - 1535.76] love that so take advantage of that
[1532.88 - 1538.40] price why they keep it there right now
[1535.76 - 1539.52] so let me strain this you have to strain
[1538.40 - 1541.68] your celery juice
[1539.52 - 1543.76] and that's really important to know got
[1541.68 - 1546.56] to strain it
[1543.76 - 1546.56] let's do that
[1548.32 - 1555.28] it's critical to keep any pull out
[1552.24 - 1558.16] any leftover little fibers or
[1555.28 - 1560.96] pulp you want out okay so that's
[1558.16 - 1560.96] important to know
[1566.40 - 1570.08] so that's your celery juice right there
[1568.96 - 1573.52] your lemon water
[1570.08 - 1576.24] hydrates you it helps flush
[1573.52 - 1577.36] the toxins out in the morning flush the
[1576.24 - 1581.92] liver and the body
[1577.36 - 1585.60] the celery juice flushes the liver too
[1581.92 - 1588.64] cleanses the body of toxins too
[1585.60 - 1591.36] but also loosens up metals
[1588.64 - 1593.24] it's a complete electrolyte that goes to
[1591.36 - 1596.96] the brain
[1593.24 - 1600.64] electrolytes get magnetically pulled
[1596.96 - 1603.84] into your brain and brain stem
[1600.64 - 1605.68] important though okay so if you're an
[1603.84 - 1606.80] electrolyte and you're swimming around
[1605.68 - 1607.84] and you're swimming around
[1606.80 - 1610.24] and you're swimming around in the
[1607.84 - 1612.64] bloodstream swimming around in the body
[1610.24 - 1613.52] right swimming around in the blood-brain
[1612.64 - 1614.96] barrier right
[1613.52 - 1617.28] across the blood-brain barrier into the
[1614.96 - 1619.68] spinal fluid if you're in electrolyte
[1617.28 - 1620.96] and you're swimming around you
[1619.68 - 1624.08] magnetically get
[1620.96 - 1627.20] pulled up to the brain and get stuck
[1624.08 - 1630.40] there electrolytes get sucked
[1627.20 - 1634.16] into the brain they get sucked
[1630.40 - 1636.80] into the brain so when a complete
[1634.16 - 1638.48] electrolyte in celery juice gets into
[1636.80 - 1640.40] the brain
[1638.48 - 1642.32] it's an entirely different experience
[1640.40 - 1643.52] than partial electrolytes that get
[1642.32 - 1645.68] sucked into the brain
[1643.52 - 1646.72] partial electrolytes complete
[1645.68 - 1649.84] electrolyte
[1646.72 - 1652.40] partial electrolytes okay just take
[1649.84 - 1654.00] any herb or vegetable here's cilantro
[1652.40 - 1657.28] which we're going to talk about that's a
[1654.00 - 1659.60] partial electrolyte partial right
[1657.28 - 1661.76] you take broccoli a partial whatever
[1659.60 - 1665.60] vegetable you want is a partial
[1661.76 - 1668.80] asparagus partial celery complete
[1665.60 - 1670.80] complete complete
[1668.80 - 1672.80] that's why it has the power to help
[1670.80 - 1674.40] dislodge metals it's a complete
[1672.80 - 1677.44] electrolyte
[1674.40 - 1679.36] okay if you just got
[1677.44 - 1681.52] on here okay just got on here with you
[1679.36 - 1683.52] in the cleanse the cleanse the heel

[1712.96 - 1718.16] it's fun it's fun all right
[1716.48 - 1720.16] we did before we make the heavy metal
[1718.16 - 1723.12] detox smoothie
[1720.16 - 1724.80] let's talk about our topics a little bit
[1723.12 - 1726.40] and let's cover the last couple
[1724.80 - 1728.08] remaining things on celery juice don't
[1726.40 - 1730.08] mix anything in it
[1728.08 - 1731.52] don't don't add the water don't add the
[1730.08 - 1732.80] lemon like i said earlier don't add
[1731.52 - 1736.16] apple
[1732.80 - 1737.12] you blow it you blow its power you blow
[1736.16 - 1740.88] its power
[1737.12 - 1742.88] it's why celery has to be in its herbal
[1740.88 - 1745.12] form that's herbal medicine i used a
[1742.88 - 1747.04] medical device which is a juicer
[1745.12 - 1749.60] and i juiced it and that's herbal
[1747.04 - 1752.40] medicine sitting right there you guys
[1749.60 - 1752.80] if you chop up a celery stick and throw
[1752.40 - 1756.00] it in
[1752.80 - 1757.92] a tuna in a tuna sandwich or something
[1756.00 - 1759.60] right or you're mixing tuna fish and
[1757.92 - 1760.88] mayo and you throw some tiny little
[1759.60 - 1763.44] celery bits
[1760.88 - 1763.92] it's not going to work if you do crudis
[1763.44 - 1765.68] hay
[1763.92 - 1767.12] and you got a little dip of french onion
[1765.68 - 1767.60] dip and you got a little this and some
[1767.12 - 1768.64] ranch
[1767.60 - 1770.72] whatever you're doing you got your
[1768.64 - 1772.32] celery stick it's not gonna work if you
[1770.72 - 1773.92] chop up celery and throw it in a salad
[1772.32 - 1776.24] it's not gonna work
[1773.92 - 1778.08] it's an it's an herbal extraction you're
[1776.24 - 1779.92] creating from an actual herb and you're
[1778.08 - 1780.40] trying to get a larger amount of its
[1779.92 - 1783.76] juice
[1780.40 - 1786.80] by itself extract it from
[1783.76 - 1789.92] the pulp from its skeleton
[1786.80 - 1792.16] okay it's important to know fiber in an
[1789.92 - 1793.12] herb or vegetable is only to hold it up
[1792.16 - 1796.48] so it can find
[1793.12 - 1798.96] sun it's not packed with nutrients
[1796.48 - 1800.16] sorry to say it's not packed with
[1798.96 - 1803.36] nutrients
[1800.16 - 1805.92] so the fiber the fiber in the stem
[1803.36 - 1807.28] of cilantro just say for example because
[1805.92 - 1810.48] i got cilantro here
[1807.28 - 1812.24] the fiber and the stem of cilantro was
[1810.48 - 1815.20] just to hold it up
[1812.24 - 1816.16] to get it to the sun be like hey sun sun
[1815.20 - 1818.40] hey
[1816.16 - 1819.60] get in that shiny bright sun it's a
[1818.40 - 1822.40] skeleton
[1819.60 - 1823.52] we don't digest it it doesn't provide
[1822.40 - 1826.16] nutrients
[1823.52 - 1827.44] so when you juice something with a
[1826.16 - 1829.44] really good juicer
[1827.44 - 1832.08] you're extracting the nutrients and
[1829.44 - 1834.32] leaving its skeleton behind
[1832.08 - 1836.32] okay that's all and what you're doing
[1834.32 - 1837.12] with an herbal extraction like celery
[1836.32 - 1839.44] juice
[1837.12 - 1841.52] you're doing just that you don't want
[1839.44 - 1843.12] anything but the juice the herbal
[1841.52 - 1845.36] extraction just like you're doing an
[1843.12 - 1847.44] herbal tea of some kind and you're
[1845.36 - 1850.16] trying to do that extraction
[1847.44 - 1852.16] today's in for lots of information today
[1850.16 - 1854.96] when you guys have you just came on here
[1852.16 - 1856.48] get your notepads out get your pens lots
[1854.96 - 1858.48] of info a lot of different stuff
[1856.48 - 1859.60] it's day two the heavy metal detox
[1858.48 - 1862.48] clench challenge
[1859.60 - 1863.84] if someone's sensitive sensitive and
[1862.48 - 1865.28] they're sensitive to celery juice a
[1863.84 - 1867.04] little bit they're sensitive to whatever
[1865.28 - 1869.20] this is really toxic
[1867.04 - 1870.48] they're really toxic do smaller amounts
[1869.20 - 1871.60] of everything smaller amounts of
[1870.48 - 1872.48] everything it means they're really
[1871.60 - 1874.00] really toxic
[1872.48 - 1875.92] i could do four ounces of celery juice
[1874.00 - 1877.36] six ounces eight ounces
[1875.92 - 1878.96] four ounces of heavy metal detox
[1877.36 - 1881.04] smoothie eight ounces
[1878.96 - 1883.20] you'll work your way up a little bit of
[1881.04 - 1884.72] spirulina maybe in some coconut water a
[1883.20 - 1886.48] little bit of this maybe a little bit of
[1884.72 - 1889.20] that i'll show you i'll show you
[1886.48 - 1892.48] right love the info nancy nancy newman
[1889.20 - 1895.44] cool i'm honored you're here thank you
[1892.48 - 1896.96] it's fun info all right i'm trying to
[1895.44 - 1899.68] read comments at the same time
[1896.96 - 1900.72] juggling i'm juggling i'm juggling all
[1899.68 - 1903.84] right
[1900.72 - 1905.68] let me throw a cap on this baby
[1903.84 - 1907.68] because i might just knock it over and i
[1905.68 - 1910.56] don't want to do that
[1907.68 - 1912.52] all right before we make the heavy metal
[1910.56 - 1914.96] detox smoothie let's talk about the
[1912.52 - 1918.00] information
[1914.96 - 1920.56] that information is critical linda says
[1918.00 - 1922.96] what about the fiber and fruit
[1920.56 - 1924.40] well the fiber's good was fiber's fine
[1922.96 - 1927.68] that's the whole point
[1924.40 - 1929.36] five are the pulp in fruit it's the pulp
[1927.68 - 1932.72] in fruit
[1929.36 - 1935.76] okay so fruits pulp more so than
[1932.72 - 1938.16] fiber vegetables fiber
[1935.76 - 1939.04] so that's the other thing too pulp and
[1938.16 - 1942.40] fruit
[1939.04 - 1945.44] pectin pulp fruit right
[1942.40 - 1946.88] wild blueberry right here pectin and
[1945.44 - 1950.16] pulp
[1946.88 - 1954.64] we ms shrew is fiber
[1950.16 - 1959.04] pectin pulp right it's fibrous
[1954.64 - 1962.56] but not fiber right pectin pulp
[1959.04 - 1965.84] fiber fiber
[1962.56 - 1970.72] stems of the vegetable
[1965.84 - 1972.88] anyway and fiber in the pectin pulp
[1970.72 - 1974.00] which is fibrous and fruit holds the
[1972.88 - 1976.64] fruit together
[1974.00 - 1977.28] so you have a piece of fruit when you
[1976.64 - 1980.32] when you
[1977.28 - 1980.64] chomp on that fruit your body disregards
[1980.32 - 1984.64] it
[1980.64 - 1987.68] it disregards all the or or discards
[1984.64 - 1988.48] all that pulp in any kind of fibrous
[1987.68 - 1991.28] pulp
[1988.48 - 1992.56] right it discards that you poop that out
[1991.28 - 1994.88] in your toilet
[1992.56 - 1995.84] but you it's your body extracted all the
[1994.88 - 1998.16] nutrients
[1995.84 - 2001.68] from all the juice and the cell and what
[1998.16 - 2003.12] was in the cell structures
[2001.68 - 2004.88] and then the fiber helps us go to
[2003.12 - 2006.40] bathroom
[2004.88 - 2007.68] when we have problems inside our guts
[2006.40 - 2010.16] and we can't go to bathroom like
[2007.68 - 2013.04] constipation issues inflammation right
[2010.16 - 2014.88] tiffany says are we not supposed to are
[2013.04 - 2016.48] we not supposed to cut out the stems of
[2014.88 - 2018.56] the cilantro into the heavy butt no
[2016.48 - 2019.44] stems go in there yeah stems go in there
[2018.56 - 2021.36] it's fine
[2019.44 - 2024.24] absolutely i throw the stems in i'm
[2021.36 - 2024.24] gonna do that in a little bit
[2024.80 - 2031.12] yeah all right let's move forward a
[2028.88 - 2033.60] little bit
[2031.12 - 2035.20] there's a lot of juice in the stems a
[2033.60 - 2038.24] lot of juice in the stems
[2035.20 - 2039.52] keep that in mind lots of juice in the
[2038.24 - 2042.16] stems
[2039.52 - 2043.52] all right when your brain gets filled
[2042.16 - 2046.08] with microscopic
[2043.52 - 2047.44] nano bits of metal from all the
[2046.08 - 2049.28] different places we get it air
[2047.44 - 2050.24] fresheners colognes perfumes clones of
[2049.28 - 2052.00] perfumes
[2050.24 - 2053.28] there's pesticides in clones perfumes
[2052.00 - 2055.52] you got do you guys love you love to
[2053.28 - 2057.36] smell pesticides
[2055.52 - 2058.80] you love it when someone sprays a
[2057.36 - 2060.56] perfume on them
[2058.80 - 2062.16] you love it when someone sprays what's
[2060.56 - 2064.48] so called a clean perfume
[2062.16 - 2065.68] perfume on them you like pesticide smell
[2064.48 - 2068.32] isn't it nice
[2065.68 - 2068.96] doesn't that pesticide smell so good did
[2068.32 - 2070.80] you know that
[2068.96 - 2072.96] that every single perfume and cologne
[2070.80 - 2074.08] company has pesticides in the in the
[2072.96 - 2076.56] clone of perfume
[2074.08 - 2078.64] i'm not talking about traces i'm talking
[2076.56 - 2082.56] about pesticides
[2078.64 - 2084.40] not traces pesticide
[2082.56 - 2085.92] do you like the smell of pesticide
[2084.40 - 2087.28] because that's what perfume is that's
[2085.92 - 2089.28] the smell of perfume
[2087.28 - 2092.72] did you guys know that did you guys ever
[2089.28 - 2095.36] smell pesticides from a farm spraying
[2092.72 - 2097.12] it's perfume did you know that it's
[2095.36 - 2099.20] cologne did you know there's rat killer
[2097.12 - 2100.32] rodenticides that all the farms use for
[2099.20 - 2104.40] their crops
[2100.32 - 2107.44] did you know it smells just like cologne
[2104.40 - 2110.16] identical you can't miss a bee
[2107.44 - 2111.76] did you know that all the different
[2110.16 - 2112.48] sprays for all the other different crops
[2111.76 - 2113.92] did you know
[2112.48 - 2115.28] did you know insecticides around your
[2113.92 - 2116.96] building in your apartment building has
[2115.28 - 2119.68] perfume in it
[2116.96 - 2120.40] because it is did you know they're both
[2119.68 - 2122.48] the same
[2120.40 - 2124.56] in many ways did you know all perfumes
[2122.48 - 2126.40] have a small amount
[2124.56 - 2128.00] and sometimes large amount of pesticide
[2126.40 - 2129.44] in them
[2128.00 - 2131.04] you like that so let me just smell
[2129.44 - 2132.16] somebody's perfume that's great oh i got
[2131.04 - 2133.04] to go somewhere i'm going to be out in a
[2132.16 - 2135.20] store and restaurant oh
[2133.04 - 2136.16] that's great that's some perfume someone
[2135.20 - 2138.64] has on there
[2136.16 - 2139.52] yeah i get it uh whoa you want to smell
[2138.64 - 2141.92] nice okay
[2139.52 - 2146.64] thank you for the pesticide exposure
[2141.92 - 2146.64] thank you kindly thank you kindly
[2147.36 - 2152.48] this information you will not hear
[2149.92 - 2154.64] anywhere else
[2152.48 - 2156.08] until someone takes it and doesn't cite
[2154.64 - 2158.40] it back to here which
[2156.08 - 2159.76] i saw today earlier which was really
[2158.40 - 2160.24] frustrating when i saw what happened
[2159.76 - 2163.68] today
[2160.24 - 2164.00] someone some influencer literally was
[2163.68 - 2166.24] like
[2164.00 - 2168.24] reading verbatim out of liver rescue and
[2166.24 - 2170.00] didn't cite medical medium
[2168.24 - 2171.52] nobody knew the liver did all these
[2170.00 - 2176.64] things blah blah blah but
[2171.52 - 2176.64] yet you know all right
[2178.96 - 2182.96] sluggish stagnant liver because fats
[2181.52 - 2184.40] burden the liver
[2182.96 - 2186.16] and pesticides and all these other
[2184.40 - 2187.92] chemicals and toxic stuff that gets
[2186.16 - 2189.76] inside the livers medical medium info
[2187.92 - 2191.60] viruses that get inside the liver making
[2189.76 - 2192.40] it sluggish and stagnant byproduct in
[2191.60 - 2193.76] the liver
[2192.40 - 2195.84] causing all these problems medical
[2193.76 - 2198.64] medium information it's amazing
[2195.84 - 2201.12] people can just take it and not say
[2198.64 - 2205.28] where it comes from
[2201.12 - 2207.76] mv doom i got so annoyed when i see
[2205.28 - 2208.40] people rip off mm info you then you must
[2207.76 - 2210.80] be like
[2208.40 - 2212.32] really awake and seeing it out there
[2210.80 - 2214.32] like you're meaning like your eyes are
[2212.32 - 2215.92] on it out there totally totally i got
[2214.32 - 2217.60] friends all the time to contact me and
[2215.92 - 2219.28] just like oh my god it just makes
[2217.60 - 2221.68] everybody sick actually makes my friends
[2219.28 - 2224.80] sick makes my family sick just makes
[2221.68 - 2226.48] that people who you know care about like
[2224.80 - 2228.32] preserving information so people get the
[2226.48 - 2229.68] rest of it so they can heal it's like it
[2228.32 - 2230.72] makes it makes a lot of people it's
[2229.68 - 2232.32] disgusting really
[2230.72 - 2234.88] hurts people because they can't get back
[2232.32 - 2238.00] to where the infamous information is
[2234.88 - 2239.84] so metal and metal exposure
[2238.00 - 2241.44] is rampant right now so when you're
[2239.84 - 2242.88] doing the perfumes clones of scented
[2241.44 - 2244.64] candles and air fresheners
[2242.88 - 2247.20] that's metal that goes directly to the
[2244.64 - 2248.88] brain through the sinus passage
[2247.20 - 2250.24] i'm not talking about just in the lungs
[2248.88 - 2252.24] and it finds its way to the brain that
[2250.24 - 2255.76] way which it does too
[2252.24 - 2256.00] mouth too the mouth you smell perfume
[2255.76 - 2258.00] you're
[2256.00 - 2259.92] eating it it's landing on your mouth
[2258.00 - 2261.68] while you're talking to someone
[2259.92 - 2263.76] it's landing in your mouth it's coating
[2261.68 - 2265.36] your whole throat right down
[2263.76 - 2267.28] and you're swallowing that perfume
[2265.36 - 2269.76] you're eating that chemical company that
[2267.28 - 2271.92] chemical giant's perfume
[2269.76 - 2274.64] chemical companies create the
[2271.92 - 2277.04] ingredients for perfume to come together
[2274.64 - 2279.76] just think about that a little bit right
[2277.04 - 2281.92] this isn't a 10 an attack on perfume
[2279.76 - 2284.08] it's just a reality check of how much of
[2281.92 - 2286.24] it we got in us because i smell perfume
[2284.08 - 2288.80] you just walk outside you smell it's
[2286.24 - 2290.48] blowing off people on the street
[2288.80 - 2292.24] then you can just choke it down be like
[2290.48 - 2293.44] thanks for that pesticide spray i really
[2292.24 - 2296.16] needed that right now
[2293.44 - 2296.72] thanks for that thanks well that's great
[2296.16 - 2298.24] god
[2296.72 - 2300.56] i'm sure you're poisoning your children
[2298.24 - 2303.76] too at the same time not that they
[2300.56 - 2306.32] it's their fault it's not their fault
[2303.76 - 2307.36] because the industries they betray us
[2306.32 - 2310.16] because they're
[2307.36 - 2312.24] they don't let anybody know you know and
[2310.16 - 2314.64] that goes back to the heavy metal world
[2312.24 - 2315.92] the heavy metal world toxic heavy metal
[2314.64 - 2318.96] world is a really
[2315.92 - 2321.12] really silent industry
[2318.96 - 2322.80] it's in everything it's in nano sprays
[2321.12 - 2324.56] on everything it's in fungicide on
[2322.80 - 2326.56] clothing it's
[2324.56 - 2328.40] it's it's all over the place you guys
[2326.56 - 2330.16] it's not just aluminum foil that i
[2328.40 - 2332.72] showed you and open up every day
[2330.16 - 2335.20] it's everywhere okay and then it's in
[2332.72 - 2337.60] pharmaceuticals all the pharmaceuticals
[2335.20 - 2341.04] metal deposits interrupt electricity
[2337.60 - 2344.56] swimming around in your brain
[2341.04 - 2346.72] metals can make decisions for you
[2344.56 - 2350.08] and they can push you to make some
[2346.72 - 2350.08] pretty shitty decisions
[2350.16 - 2355.28] and and make you feel like a bad person
[2352.08 - 2358.48] in this at the same time
[2355.28 - 2360.00] confidence issues come from toxic heavy
[2358.48 - 2362.96] metals many times
[2360.00 - 2364.72] not all the time but a lot of the time
[2362.96 - 2366.84] confidence issues you guys
[2364.72 - 2368.48] comes from toxic heavy metals inside the
[2366.84 - 2372.00] brain
[2368.48 - 2374.96] confidence issues yeah
[2372.00 - 2376.96] metals really do shape the fabric of our
[2374.96 - 2380.48] lives
[2376.96 - 2381.68] i know and they control too they control
[2380.48 - 2383.28] us
[2381.68 - 2384.96] what happens is electricity swims
[2383.28 - 2387.92] through the brain and hits the deposits
[2384.96 - 2391.28] of toxic heavy metals and ricochets off
[2387.92 - 2393.12] that's how ocd occurs ocd occurs because
[2391.28 - 2395.20] there's a deposit of toxic heavy metal
[2393.12 - 2396.88] such as mercury sitting on a neuron
[2395.20 - 2398.88] an electrical impulse keeps on hitting
[2396.88 - 2401.12] it over and over again
[2398.88 - 2402.24] and bouncing back up and when it bounces
[2401.12 - 2405.12] back up
[2402.24 - 2406.48] another one's coming down another one's
[2405.12 - 2411.84] coming down
[2406.48 - 2411.84] so let's just pretend let's just pretend
[2412.00 - 2417.52] this pencil is a neuron
[2415.60 - 2418.96] okay just pretend this pencil is a
[2417.52 - 2421.12] neuron right
[2418.96 - 2422.32] and you got toxic heavy metals right in
[2421.12 - 2424.08] the middle
[2422.32 - 2425.84] let's just pretend it's in the middle
[2424.08 - 2427.20] okay so you got toxic but a little bit
[2425.84 - 2428.24] of mercury aluminum right in the middle
[2427.20 - 2430.16] of that pencil
[2428.24 - 2432.72] an electrical impulse is coming down
[2430.16 - 2434.48] that neuron with information
[2432.72 - 2436.08] and as it's coming down real fast i'm
[2434.48 - 2438.08] going real slow as it's coming down it
[2436.08 - 2441.52] hits the deposit
[2438.08 - 2444.24] and if the deposit's big enough it
[2441.52 - 2444.96] explodes and bounces back up as it's
[2444.24 - 2447.36] going back
[2444.96 - 2448.72] up another electrical impulse is coming
[2447.36 - 2452.00] up behind it
[2448.72 - 2454.80] and crashing into it that's where
[2452.00 - 2457.20] i better check is these lights go on
[2454.80 - 2459.92] these lights are on but i better
[2457.20 - 2461.92] nope nope i shut them off i know i shut
[2459.92 - 2465.60] those lights off
[2461.92 - 2467.20] um i better check i better check to make
[2465.60 - 2468.24] sure this lights are off yep they're off
[2467.20 - 2470.88] right
[2468.24 - 2471.52] yep they're on nope they're definitely
[2470.88 - 2474.88] off
[2471.52 - 2476.80] i'll check again let me see
[2474.88 - 2478.56] okay my anxiety's starting to rise now
[2476.80 - 2480.40] i'm trying to have an anxiety attack
[2478.56 - 2482.16] because i don't i know i shut those
[2480.40 - 2482.56] lights off i know i shut those lights
[2482.16 - 2486.72] off
[2482.56 - 2490.72] i gotta look again god damn it oh
[2486.72 - 2493.12] yep all right oh
[2490.72 - 2494.72] my god now i'm having a panic attack
[2493.12 - 2497.12] because i did it four times
[2494.72 - 2498.88] already and i'm going to do it one more
[2497.12 - 2502.32] time
[2498.88 - 2505.52] yep i sit down i shut it off
[2502.32 - 2508.24] i've heard that a thousand times when i
[2505.52 - 2511.52] was practicing for 35 years
[2508.24 - 2514.88] that's just that variety of ocd
[2511.52 - 2517.04] that's a positive heavy metal
[2514.88 - 2519.20] sitting on a neuron an electrical
[2517.04 - 2520.96] impulse keeps on hitting it
[2519.20 - 2522.40] each electrical impulse keeps on hitting
[2520.96 - 2524.00] it and
[2522.40 - 2525.52] part of that electrical impulse gets
[2524.00 - 2528.56] ricocheted back
[2525.52 - 2530.72] that's what that is that's what that is
[2528.56 - 2532.32] that's you in the car ingrid see that's
[2530.72 - 2536.56] me in the car
[2532.32 - 2538.08] oh you poor thing oh god oh
[2536.56 - 2540.56] and here's the other thing that
[2538.08 - 2543.60] electrical impulse you guys
[2540.56 - 2545.28] is carrying information information is
[2543.60 - 2546.80] in that electrical impulse going down
[2545.28 - 2548.84] that neuron
[2546.80 - 2551.84] so cutting across that neuron is
[2548.84 - 2555.04] information
[2551.84 - 2558.32] and that information
[2555.04 - 2561.60] okay can blow up
[2558.32 - 2563.52] blow up right when that information in
[2561.60 - 2565.36] the electrical impulse hits that
[2563.52 - 2566.64] deposit of toxic heavy metal sitting
[2565.36 - 2570.96] inside the neuron
[2566.64 - 2573.68] it could blow up and mess your head up
[2570.96 - 2574.56] and now your foot you're frustrated
[2573.68 - 2576.84] you're you're
[2574.56 - 2578.48] flustered that's it you're confused
[2576.84 - 2582.24] you're
[2578.48 - 2584.88] you're off your game you're stressed out
[2582.24 - 2587.36] when you shouldn't be
[2584.88 - 2589.28] saskia why are there many different ocd
[2587.36 - 2590.48] mine is different i'll tell you why
[2589.28 - 2592.24] because there's many different toxic
[2590.48 - 2593.36] heavy metals and amounts in different
[2592.24 - 2595.04] places of the brain
[2593.36 - 2597.36] someone might have toxic heavy metals in
[2595.04 - 2599.76] the emotional center of the brain
[2597.36 - 2602.16] someone may have it in the frontal lobe
[2599.76 - 2604.16] someone may have it everywhere
[2602.16 - 2606.64] someone may have it sprinkled about the
[2604.16 - 2607.60] left hemisphere and then on the right
[2606.64 - 2610.88] hemisphere have
[2607.60 - 2612.64] larger deposits and someone may have
[2610.88 - 2614.40] more mercury and someone may have more
[2612.64 - 2615.92] lead and someone may have mercury and
[2614.40 - 2616.48] aluminum when someone has aluminum and
[2615.92 - 2617.92] copper
[2616.48 - 2620.40] someone may have a little bit of all of
[2617.92 - 2623.20] it someone may just have one r2
[2620.40 - 2623.84] mainly and lightly on the others it
[2623.20 - 2627.28] changes

[2656.88 - 2664.32] let's go
[2662.24 - 2665.68] how do the five ingredients work why is
[2664.32 - 2667.04] there five things in the heavy metal
[2665.68 - 2670.32] detox movie
[2667.04 - 2672.32] why is there because there's one more
[2670.32 - 2674.56] than one toxic heavy metal that's one
[2672.32 - 2678.16] thing right there all on its own
[2674.56 - 2678.80] right there's different depths of your
[2678.16 - 2681.44] toxic
[2678.80 - 2682.16] heavy metal you may have a toxic heavy
[2681.44 - 2685.12] metal
[2682.16 - 2686.24] deep in the core of your liver not just
[2685.12 - 2688.72] on the outside
[2686.24 - 2691.04] or adjacent lobe you may actually have
[2688.72 - 2693.20] toxic heavy metal very deep
[2691.04 - 2695.04] in the core of the liver you may have
[2693.20 - 2696.80] the metals in the lining of the
[2695.04 - 2698.32] intestinal tract i'm not talking about
[2696.80 - 2699.84] inside the intestinal tract i'm talking
[2698.32 - 2702.24] about in the lining itself
[2699.84 - 2703.20] smack dab in the middle of the lining
[2702.24 - 2707.12] you might have
[2703.20 - 2710.72] toxic heavy metals in the brain
[2707.12 - 2711.44] but in the brain stem a whole nother
[2710.72 - 2713.28] game
[2711.44 - 2715.12] when those metals in the brain stem and
[2713.28 - 2717.20] it brings them in flames
[2715.12 - 2718.24] whole another game right there on its
[2717.20 - 2721.36] own right
[2718.24 - 2724.80] susan i've been trying to figure out why
[2721.36 - 2726.96] i stress out when nothing is going on
[2724.80 - 2728.32] it just added more stress to my life
[2726.96 - 2730.08] trying to to find
[2728.32 - 2731.76] what was wrong with me absolutely and
[2730.08 - 2733.76] you know what
[2731.76 - 2734.56] it's it's it's a tricky situation too
[2733.76 - 2735.92] because then we're seeing the
[2734.56 - 2737.52] neurologists and then we're seeing our
[2735.92 - 2738.56] fifth doctor and our temp doctor and now
[2737.52 - 2740.96] we're seeing you know
[2738.56 - 2742.48] another nutritionist who's got the keto
[2740.96 - 2744.00] diet down they think and then you get
[2742.48 - 2745.60] and then now you're seeing an rd
[2744.00 - 2747.12] and now you're seeing a chiropractor
[2745.60 - 2749.12] right now you're seeing
[2747.12 - 2750.88] now you're back to a do and a naturopath
[2749.12 - 2752.88] and back to a specialist and a gp and
[2750.88 - 2754.24] now you're back to
[2752.88 - 2757.04] another neurologist and now you're at
[2754.24 - 2760.48] the pulmonologist's office too to boot
[2757.04 - 2764.40] absolutely and guess what
[2760.48 - 2767.12] the mercury man is laughing his ass off
[2764.40 - 2768.16] the mercury man laughing laughing
[2767.12 - 2770.32] laughing
[2768.16 - 2772.80] because the mercury man is grandfathered
[2770.32 - 2774.72] in with documents inside of a vault
[2772.80 - 2778.64] that originally stemmed from the mercury
[2774.72 - 2782.56] industry back over a thousand years ago
[2778.64 - 2784.88] and you can't touch those documents
[2782.56 - 2786.72] they're trusted in forever those
[2784.88 - 2788.96] documents will say
[2786.72 - 2790.48] mercury will never leave us our lives or
[2788.96 - 2792.88] the industries
[2790.48 - 2795.20] it will be there forever doesn't matter
[2792.88 - 2797.76] if the dentist stop putting in her teeth
[2795.20 - 2799.12] it's everywhere it's in medications it's
[2797.76 - 2802.72] all over the place
[2799.12 - 2805.12] that's the mercury man all right
[2802.72 - 2807.76] which reminds me here's one way the
[2805.12 - 2809.76] mercury man gets in us right there
[2807.76 - 2811.44] the mercury man gets in is through fish
[2809.76 - 2814.96] oil supplements
[2811.44 - 2818.08] methyl mercury methyl mercury
[2814.96 - 2819.28] traces the essence of mercury so it goes
[2818.08 - 2822.88] straight to our brain
[2819.28 - 2825.84] never do fish oil supplements eat fish
[2822.88 - 2826.32] you're better off i'm not i don't eat
[2825.84 - 2827.84] fish
[2826.32 - 2830.96] i don't eat fish they're filled with
[2827.84 - 2834.08] dioxins and metals right
[2830.96 - 2835.68] but the point is is you can eat fish
[2834.08 - 2837.36] and still do the heavy metal detox
[2835.68 - 2840.80] smoothie and cleanse and still
[2837.36 - 2842.08] heal you can still eat fish if you're a
[2840.80 - 2845.12] fish eater
[2842.08 - 2848.40] fish oil entirely different
[2845.12 - 2850.48] entirely different the mercury in a
[2848.40 - 2852.96] piece of fish is way different
[2850.48 - 2854.64] than when it's in this form right here
[2852.96 - 2855.20] that's the form it becomes methyl
[2854.64 - 2859.52] mercury
[2855.20 - 2862.56] that's the form that gets to your brain
[2859.52 - 2864.00] all right are we having any fun yet are
[2862.56 - 2868.08] you guys
[2864.00 - 2868.96] bummed out so no mercury in vimergy
[2868.08 - 2870.80] right
[2868.96 - 2874.00] vimergy does not add mercury to their
[2870.80 - 2874.00] supplements no
[2874.08 - 2880.16] all right let's move forward you guys
[2877.60 - 2880.96] um heavy metal detox ingredients let's
[2880.16 - 2886.72] go into that
[2880.96 - 2889.60] why is that important okay
[2886.72 - 2892.00] fish oil is different than dha keep that
[2889.60 - 2892.00] in mind
[2892.56 - 2895.84] say like a plant-based dha supplement or
[2894.72 - 2899.76] so forth
[2895.84 - 2903.36] entirely different fish oil is
[2899.76 - 2906.48] a billion heads and tails and fins
[2903.36 - 2908.32] of of millions and millions and millions
[2906.48 - 2910.48] of fish
[2908.32 - 2911.76] thrown into machines and pressed and
[2910.48 - 2914.16] squeezed down
[2911.76 - 2914.96] to create the fish oil for the fish oil
[2914.16 - 2918.24] industry
[2914.96 - 2920.88] right all right
[2918.24 - 2921.76] cilantro wild blueberries barley grass
[2920.88 - 2925.20] juice powder
[2921.76 - 2928.08] atlantic dolls right
[2925.20 - 2929.92] okay and spirulina you're looking at
[2928.08 - 2932.96] five things right here
[2929.92 - 2934.96] five things one two three four five if
[2932.96 - 2937.20] my ocd kicks in i'm gonna count it over
[2934.96 - 2940.24] and over again one two three four five
[2937.20 - 2942.24] one two three four five right so
[2940.24 - 2944.16] the whole point is is you're looking at
[2942.24 - 2947.60] five different things
[2944.16 - 2947.60] guess what you're not looking at
[2947.68 - 2952.24] guess what you're not looking at where
[2950.16 - 2954.56] is the bentonite clay
[2952.24 - 2955.52] bending my clay where are you been like
[2954.56 - 2959.36] clay
[2955.52 - 2961.44] where are you where's the charcoal
[2959.36 - 2962.72] charcoal that was in somebody else's
[2961.44 - 2965.36] brain scheme
[2962.72 - 2966.56] someone's big old brain scheme uh-huh
[2965.36 - 2970.64] where's the charcoal
[2966.56 - 2973.84] where are you zeolite
[2970.64 - 2977.36] zeolite why is zeolite not in here
[2973.84 - 2979.68] see why it's not in here uh-huh nope
[2977.36 - 2980.72] nope nope and we'll talk about that why
[2979.68 - 2985.04] these aren't in there
[2980.72 - 2987.76] see light's not in here garlic
[2985.04 - 2988.16] where's the garlic why is the garlic in
[2987.76 - 2990.16] here
[2988.16 - 2991.68] i mean i like garlic garlic's in recipes
[2990.16 - 2993.44] garlics and medical mean recipes but why
[2991.68 - 2996.96] is it in the heavy metal detox smoothie
[2993.44 - 2998.40] where is it okay
[2996.96 - 3000.24] and what else what else do people like
[2998.40 - 3002.48] to say remove metals what else do people
[3000.24 - 3004.48] come up with like takomini stuff
[3002.48 - 3006.56] that removes metals so let's go into it
[3004.48 - 3010.32] a little bit why aren't those things
[3006.56 - 3012.08] in here one is bentonite clay
[3010.32 - 3013.68] is really aggressive on the intestinal
[3012.08 - 3015.12] tract it doesn't remove toxic heavy
[3013.68 - 3018.08] metals instead it'll make crohn's
[3015.12 - 3020.56] colitis celiac ibs a hell of a lot worse
[3018.08 - 3022.00] it'll make uh intestinal problems a lot
[3020.56 - 3024.16] worse
[3022.00 - 3025.52] and it's damaging to the lining of the
[3024.16 - 3027.12] intestinal tract
[3025.52 - 3028.80] so bentonite clay is the last thing you
[3027.12 - 3030.72] want to ever take or consume no matter
[3028.80 - 3031.84] what never mind in a heavy metal detox
[3030.72 - 3033.92] whatever the heck
[3031.84 - 3035.12] that's one thing right there said to the
[3033.92 - 3037.68] next one charcoal
[3035.12 - 3038.48] charcoal suffocates your intestinal
[3037.68 - 3040.56] lining
[3038.48 - 3042.24] it stops nutrients from getting to your
[3040.56 - 3043.60] liver to get into your bloodstream to
[3042.24 - 3046.96] get into anywhere
[3043.60 - 3049.52] charcoal suffocates good bacteria
[3046.96 - 3050.96] good bacteria but yet helps bad bacteria
[3049.52 - 3054.24] thrive do you know why
[3050.96 - 3057.44] charcoal removes oxygen from your
[3054.24 - 3059.52] good bacteria bad bacteria
[3057.44 - 3061.20] thrives with no oxygen do you see how it
[3059.52 - 3063.20] works charcoal
[3061.20 - 3065.20] in your gut proliferates the bad
[3063.20 - 3068.48] bacteria making you sicker
[3065.20 - 3069.84] making bugs grow while killing your good
[3068.48 - 3073.12] bacteria because you build
[3069.84 - 3076.48] good bacteria thrives on oxygen
[3073.12 - 3080.00] bad bugs don't like oxygen
[3076.48 - 3083.12] because oxygen kills them charcoal
[3080.00 - 3084.40] makes you sicker that's why it's not in
[3083.12 - 3086.88] here
[3084.40 - 3090.08] that's just one reason you don't swallow
[3086.88 - 3093.84] charcoal you don't swallow it
[3090.08 - 3095.92] okay oh wait where's the chlorella
[3093.84 - 3097.44] chlorella where are you where are you
[3095.92 - 3099.12] chlorella where are you
[3097.44 - 3101.36] you're not in here either you're not
[3099.12 - 3103.20] part of the five
[3101.36 - 3104.64] chlorella doesn't remove toxic heavy
[3103.20 - 3108.08] metals and
[3104.64 - 3110.88] if it ever did it drops it along the way
[3108.08 - 3112.56] which makes you sicker chlorella is also
[3110.88 - 3113.92] filled with bacteria and has put a lot
[3112.56 - 3115.52] of people in the hospital
[3113.92 - 3116.96] it's not monitored it's not checked
[3115.52 - 3119.52] properly and chlorella
[3116.96 - 3120.00] tends to harbor bacteria because guess
[3119.52 - 3123.20] what
[3120.00 - 3127.44] bad bacteria thrives in chlorella why
[3123.20 - 3129.04] hmm why does bad bacteria thrive in
[3127.44 - 3132.16] chlorella
[3129.04 - 3136.24] spirulina's antibacterial
[3132.16 - 3136.24] bacteria doesn't thrive in spirulina
[3136.80 - 3141.04] i mean vimorgy independently tests their
[3138.96 - 3143.12] stuff for bacteria anyway
[3141.04 - 3145.68] but it doesn't thrive in in spirulina
[3143.12 - 3148.72] why does bad bacteria
[3145.68 - 3150.56] thrive in chlorella that means there's
[3148.72 - 3152.88] something in chlorella that feeds bad
[3150.56 - 3154.96] bacteria hmm
[3152.88 - 3156.40] so let's be another hack in the industry
[3154.96 - 3157.52] of alternative medicine you should be on
[3156.40 - 3160.08] chlorella
[3157.52 - 3161.84] i'm dr hack make sure you're on
[3160.08 - 3163.84] chlorella here's a chlorella supplement
[3161.84 - 3165.04] on dr hack oh heavy metals we only
[3163.84 - 3166.56] learned about that because of medical
[3165.04 - 3168.08] medium for 35 years
[3166.56 - 3169.52] so let's come up with our own little
[3168.08 - 3172.48] thoughts of what can take metals out
[3169.52 - 3172.48] here's some chlorella
[3173.20 - 3177.52] and then there's zeolite medical medium
[3176.48 - 3180.56] book one
[3177.52 - 3183.52] there's like a line in the book
[3180.56 - 3184.56] can you zeolite at the time there was
[3183.52 - 3187.12] one zeolite
[3184.56 - 3188.40] at the time i trusted enough that you
[3187.12 - 3191.04] can use for gut
[3188.40 - 3193.52] for the gut situation because there
[3191.04 - 3195.68] wasn't atlantic dulce available and i
[3193.52 - 3198.48] use atlantic dolls to remove toxic heavy
[3195.68 - 3198.48] metals from the gut
[3199.12 - 3205.68] so i mentioned that you could use
[3202.56 - 3208.88] a zeolite at the time but that
[3205.68 - 3211.12] ship has sailed not be not just because
[3208.88 - 3214.56] you can get atlantic dolls
[3211.12 - 3216.88] okay i never said zeolite can remove
[3214.56 - 3218.64] anything out of the body it was
[3216.88 - 3222.08] intestinal track if it was
[3218.64 - 3222.96] surface intestinal tract if it was
[3222.08 - 3226.32] surface
[3222.96 - 3228.80] in the gut health section of the book
[3226.32 - 3230.16] this is an example where people take
[3228.80 - 3233.36] advantage
[3230.16 - 3236.64] of people they'll say medical medium
[3233.36 - 3238.96] said zeolite's fine
[3236.64 - 3240.56] it removes from the brain it doesn't
[3238.96 - 3243.52] remove metals from the brain
[3240.56 - 3244.72] it never does it never can it can't
[3243.52 - 3246.56] leave
[3244.72 - 3248.32] to move metals to the brain it can't get
[3246.56 - 3250.40] to the brain to remove
[3248.32 - 3253.60] metals it can't do it doesn't have metal
[3250.40 - 3256.48] removing ability like that right
[3253.60 - 3257.20] so one reason why i don't talk about
[3256.48 - 3260.00] zeolite
[3257.20 - 3262.72] is because the unedible zeolites entered
[3260.00 - 3264.88] the industry
[3262.72 - 3265.92] and they manufacture the unedible
[3264.88 - 3269.04] zeolites
[3265.92 - 3272.24] with the edible zeolites
[3269.04 - 3278.00] you guys get where i'm going
[3272.24 - 3281.84] okay unedible zeolites are like asbestos
[3278.00 - 3284.96] they're dangerous to swallow
[3281.84 - 3288.24] unedible zealites are dangerous
[3284.96 - 3292.16] to swallow they're
[3288.24 - 3294.24] dusted on edible zeolites the industry
[3292.16 - 3296.72] has totally effed up and they've
[3294.24 - 3298.64] actually ruined it
[3296.72 - 3300.08] not that it was even that good anyway
[3298.64 - 3302.32] because it wasn't
[3300.08 - 3303.68] but everything's been dusted the
[3302.32 - 3305.76] manufacturing process
[3303.68 - 3306.72] is not trustworthy and the details
[3305.76 - 3309.60] matter
[3306.72 - 3310.16] i will never recommend zeolite again i
[3309.60 - 3313.28] did it
[3310.16 - 3314.56] years ago i've recommended it eight nine
[3313.28 - 3317.76] years ago
[3314.56 - 3320.56] for the gut only when there was a
[3317.76 - 3322.96] zeolite i trusted
[3320.56 - 3325.36] because there wasn't atlantic dulce
[3322.96 - 3327.60] around
[3325.36 - 3328.64] so that's the understanding about that
[3327.60 - 3332.00] so people know
[3328.64 - 3333.12] how things roll okay if i don't
[3332.00 - 3336.40] recommend it
[3333.12 - 3338.32] there's a reason that's all
[3336.40 - 3340.32] if i don't recommend something there's a
[3338.32 - 3341.92] reason if i don't recommend chlorella
[3340.32 - 3342.56] there's a serious reason if i don't
[3341.92 - 3344.16] recommend
[3342.56 - 3345.60] zeolite there's a serious reason if i
[3344.16 - 3347.44] don't recommend charcoal
[3345.60 - 3348.80] to swallow it's a serious reason if i
[3347.44 - 3351.44] don't recommend fish oil
[3348.80 - 3353.04] there's a serious reason and supplement
[3351.44 - 3355.92] companies have their own free will
[3353.04 - 3358.16] and you can't control them you can't
[3355.92 - 3362.88] control a supplement company they got
[3358.16 - 3364.56] their own free will
[3362.88 - 3368.48] so let's talk about the five ingredients
[3364.56 - 3371.52] that do work let's go into that
[3368.48 - 3373.84] and trust me the uneditable zeolites
[3371.52 - 3377.92] which get dusted on the edible zeolites
[3373.84 - 3380.24] are dangerous it turns into like an
[3377.92 - 3382.08] asbestos powder inside the intestinal
[3380.24 - 3383.28] tract and i will never take the zeolite
[3382.08 - 3384.24] because i could never trust if that
[3383.28 - 3385.92] stuff was dusted
[3384.24 - 3387.84] because it's like you're gluten-free and
[3385.92 - 3388.96] non-gluten-free if something was
[3387.84 - 3391.04] manufactured
[3388.96 - 3392.40] and they have to put if they manufacture
[3391.04 - 3394.08] something at a factory that's also
[3392.40 - 3396.00] manufacturing nuts and seeds and you're
[3394.08 - 3398.64] allergic to peanuts and nuts
[3396.00 - 3401.28] and it says on the package this may
[3398.64 - 3402.64] contain nuts
[3401.28 - 3404.08] even though there's no nuts in the
[3402.64 - 3404.80] ingredient list you hear what i'm saying
[3404.08 - 3406.72] you guys
[3404.80 - 3408.32] this may contain nuts on the package do
[3406.72 - 3409.36] you ever see that you grab a package and
[3408.32 - 3411.76] you're like hey
[3409.36 - 3413.84] you know there's no nuts in here let me
[3411.76 - 3417.52] see this package here there's no nuts in
[3413.84 - 3419.68] here but it says may contain nuts
[3417.52 - 3421.44] what you're not seeing on your zeolite
[3419.68 - 3424.88] your zeolite product
[3421.44 - 3428.16] is may contain a zeolite that's unedible
[3424.88 - 3431.52] that's basically like asbestos
[3428.16 - 3436.16] because they use that in industries
[3431.52 - 3436.16] and may contain that
[3438.00 - 3442.08] i could do what i can to protect
[3439.36 - 3445.04] everybody the best i can but
[3442.08 - 3445.60] i can't beat out a thousand admin being
[3445.04 - 3448.40] paid
[3445.60 - 3450.16] on social media with the mlm companies
[3448.40 - 3452.00] trying to get everybody to do stuff
[3450.16 - 3453.44] because people just i just can't stop
[3452.00 - 3457.12] whatever
[3453.44 - 3460.72] janet says is dolls okay for hypothyroid
[3457.12 - 3462.48] yes it is the reason why there's
[3460.72 - 3462.88] confusion with hypo and hyperthyroid is
[3462.48 - 3464.32] the
[3462.88 - 3465.92] they don't know science research doesn't
[3464.32 - 3467.52] know what causes it unless they got mm
[3465.92 - 3470.08] info because it's epstein-barr
[3467.52 - 3474.40] and guess what dulce is good because dos
[3470.08 - 3479.60] helps to defend you against epstein-barr
[3474.40 - 3483.04] yeah all right five ingredients
[3479.60 - 3483.84] okay right here five ingredients why do
[3483.04 - 3486.64] they work
[3483.84 - 3486.64] how do they work
[3487.20 - 3489.84] cilantro
[3490.56 - 3497.92] cilantro has a trace mineral salt
[3495.12 - 3499.52] attached to a phytochemical compound
[3497.92 - 3501.20] that trace mineral salt attached to a
[3499.52 - 3504.48] phytochemical compound
[3501.20 - 3506.08] enters the brain not only
[3504.48 - 3508.88] fuels the brain with the trace mineral
[3506.08 - 3512.00] salt electrolyte
[3508.88 - 3515.44] but cilantro's gift
[3512.00 - 3517.68] to us unlike other things is
[3515.44 - 3518.96] phytochemical compounds that remove
[3517.68 - 3521.44] toxic heavy metals
[3518.96 - 3523.84] from the brain are attached to the
[3521.44 - 3527.52] electrolyte
[3523.84 - 3529.52] that's cilantro special gift
[3527.52 - 3531.28] let's move on to another one and we're
[3529.52 - 3535.20] going to go into a couple things
[3531.28 - 3538.08] the wild blueberry the wild blueberry
[3535.20 - 3538.72] right wild blueberry juice frozen wild
[3538.08 - 3541.60] blueberries
[3538.72 - 3543.20] a lot of blueberry powder if you can't
[3541.60 - 3544.16] get a hold of by the way those wild
[3543.20 - 3546.24] blueberries
[3544.16 - 3547.52] those frozen wild blueberries try to get
[3546.24 - 3549.12] a hold of a juice
[3547.52 - 3550.64] like the wyman's one is the one i trust
[3549.12 - 3551.60] and i'm working with these guys and i'm
[3550.64 - 3553.36] proud of it
[3551.60 - 3554.80] because the fact that they can get this
[3553.36 - 3555.92] stuff out of a field which you couldn't
[3554.80 - 3558.88] believe the process
[3555.92 - 3559.84] stick it through it the juicer and and
[3558.88 - 3561.84] get it to us
[3559.84 - 3563.92] is a miracle i never thought that drink
[3561.84 - 3565.36] that dream i thought would never exist
[3563.92 - 3566.88] when i was a child and i wanted people
[3565.36 - 3570.72] to have this kind of medicine it's like
[3566.88 - 3574.72] that that was unimaginable
[3570.72 - 3576.80] and then the vimrjiwa blueberry powder
[3574.72 - 3577.92] right that's an option too if you can't
[3576.80 - 3579.60] get a hold of you know which is
[3577.92 - 3582.32] incorrect this stuff is like
[3579.60 - 3584.88] incredible it's gold right the wild
[3582.32 - 3584.88] blueberry
[3585.52 - 3589.76] emily says i can only find dulce flakes
[3588.24 - 3593.84] harvested on the shores
[3589.76 - 3596.72] of maine ah maine anyone know
[3593.84 - 3598.84] if this is okay to use i do it's
[3596.72 - 3603.12] fantastic to use
[3598.84 - 3606.64] fantastic so the wild blueberry
[3603.12 - 3607.12] it's the gatherer of metals both in the
[3606.64 - 3610.16] brain
[3607.12 - 3612.40] and the liver other organs too there's
[3610.16 - 3615.12] antioxidants in the wild blueberry
[3612.40 - 3616.56] that that aren't even documented nowhere
[3615.12 - 3619.76] near documented
[3616.56 - 3621.20] food science is at its infancy there's a
[3619.76 - 3623.60] reason for that
[3621.20 - 3624.32] because if food science is truly allowed
[3623.60 - 3626.08] to press
[3624.32 - 3628.24] forward and not just look at a few
[3626.08 - 3628.72] nutrients like they do it's allowed to
[3628.24 - 3632.00] press
[3628.72 - 3635.84] forward big pharma would have to then
[3632.00 - 3637.28] put a mandatory lock down on your wild
[3635.84 - 3639.28] blueberries and they would then
[3637.28 - 3640.48] encapsulate it and they would take it
[3639.28 - 3642.40] away from you right
[3640.48 - 3643.68] if food science was allowed to push
[3642.40 - 3646.96] forward
[3643.68 - 3648.40] and they knew that there are up to 30
[3646.96 - 3650.24] antioxidants plus
[3648.40 - 3652.56] even more undiscovered in the wild
[3650.24 - 3653.84] blueberry undiscovered if they knew that
[3652.56 - 3655.28] and they knew what the wild blueberry
[3653.84 - 3656.24] did and how it removes toxic heavy
[3655.28 - 3658.48] metals
[3656.24 - 3660.32] they would stop they would say nope wild
[3658.48 - 3660.64] blueberries dope no one's allowed to eat
[3660.32 - 3661.84] them
[3660.64 - 3664.32] you're gonna have to get a prescription
[3661.84 - 3667.12] by our doctor
[3664.32 - 3667.76] frozen wild blueberries have been sold
[3667.12 - 3670.56] out
[3667.76 - 3671.12] of the grocery store it's only temporary
[3670.56 - 3672.88] because
[3671.12 - 3674.96] here we're in the we're in the harvest
[3672.88 - 3676.08] season right now so light heart light
[3674.96 - 3677.44] heart it's good they're going to get the
[3676.08 - 3678.16] frozen they're going to get them out
[3677.44 - 3680.00] there
[3678.16 - 3681.60] wyman's will get them out there they're
[3680.00 - 3683.12] in the harvest season right now this the
[3681.60 - 3685.36] harvesting time right
[3683.12 - 3686.88] this is right now the harvesting time
[3685.36 - 3689.12] that's why
[3686.88 - 3690.64] i use this right now too like if you're
[3689.12 - 3691.92] out of the wild blueberry i happen to
[3690.64 - 3693.52] have some backups
[3691.92 - 3695.44] but if you're out of it that's why i use
[3693.52 - 3696.88] the uh wild blueberry juice i put that
[3695.44 - 3698.32] in the smoothie i put two to four ounces
[3696.88 - 3700.56] in the smoothie boom
[3698.32 - 3702.40] right or i take shot glass of it every
[3700.56 - 3704.72] day whatever but that's why i use that
[3702.40 - 3706.64] and then you got the vimergy well
[3704.72 - 3708.72] blueberry powder
[3706.64 - 3710.32] you have that one you got that option
[3708.72 - 3713.68] just of energy v is invictor
[3710.32 - 3715.20] i m imergy.com i'm not sponsored by
[3713.68 - 3717.52] these guys
[3715.20 - 3719.36] but yeah tastes so good tastes so good
[3717.52 - 3722.72] by the way this tastes so good it's it's
[3719.36 - 3724.32] it's it's crazy when you taste it
[3722.72 - 3728.56] i i don't even know what to say all
[3724.32 - 3728.56] right let's go into the next stuff
[3728.96 - 3732.72] dried cilantro anthony not a great
[3730.88 - 3735.84] option frozen cilantro
[3732.72 - 3737.44] is not the worst that could work
[3735.84 - 3738.72] but you got to put it in the smoothie
[3737.44 - 3741.52] right when it comes out of the freezer
[3738.72 - 3743.68] you can't turn it to yuck and muck
[3741.52 - 3745.60] cilantro works best with living water in
[3743.68 - 3748.32] it froze you don't want you
[3745.60 - 3749.52] frozen is still sketchy but you can
[3748.32 - 3751.28] still use it
[3749.52 - 3754.32] but you can't use the dried really it's
[3751.28 - 3755.92] just it's not going to cut it but i mean
[3754.32 - 3756.48] you could pop a little dried in there
[3755.92 - 3758.80] and you got
[3756.48 - 3760.32] you know you got like i mean at least
[3758.80 - 3761.84] the connections there even if
[3760.32 - 3765.68] something's missing
[3761.84 - 3767.76] you know so let's move on
[3765.68 - 3769.68] the wild blueberry chemical compounds
[3767.76 - 3771.04] that dislodge toxic heavy metals but
[3769.68 - 3775.28] hold on to them
[3771.04 - 3778.24] the wild blueberry holds on to metal
[3775.28 - 3778.24] holds onto metal
[3778.32 - 3782.72] that's what i love about it barley grass
[3780.48 - 3785.60] cheese powder
[3782.72 - 3786.32] another binder of toxic heavy metals not
[3785.60 - 3789.84] barley grass
[3786.32 - 3791.12] broadly grass cheese powder a binder
[3789.84 - 3793.28] i know we've been here for a while you
[3791.12 - 3795.20] guys so let's keep on moving through
[3793.28 - 3796.80] i don't want to keep you all day because
[3795.20 - 3801.68] we still got more time
[3796.80 - 3806.16] more fun more play coming up spirulina
[3801.68 - 3809.36] that is the toxic heavy metal remover
[3806.16 - 3811.80] it even removes radiation radiation
[3809.36 - 3813.04] that's what i love about spirulina
[3811.80 - 3817.52] radiation
[3813.04 - 3820.56] what removes radiation right
[3817.52 - 3820.56] chlorella doesn't
[3820.96 - 3825.60] but spirulina does okay spirulina is
[3824.48 - 3828.24] also
[3825.60 - 3830.08] um an incredible weapon against toxic
[3828.24 - 3831.28] heavy metals binds on to it grabs onto
[3830.08 - 3832.72] metals helps to bring them out now why
[3831.28 - 3834.72] are all these five together and then
[3832.72 - 3836.56] left atlantic dulce which is the best
[3834.72 - 3838.80] one for the intestinal tract now
[3836.56 - 3839.92] have no fear if you don't have atlantic
[3838.80 - 3841.84] dolls
[3839.92 - 3843.20] you can keep it out and still do the
[3841.84 - 3845.36] cleanse and still do the heavy metal
[3843.20 - 3847.68] detox smoothie
[3845.36 - 3852.00] it's atlantic dolls not pacific you
[3847.68 - 3854.48] don't want pacific dolls atlantic dolls
[3852.00 - 3856.56] you don't want pacific sparrow lena you
[3854.48 - 3857.68] don't want pacific spirulina i talk
[3856.56 - 3860.88] about that all the time
[3857.68 - 3863.68] why you don't oceans are too polluted
[3860.88 - 3867.20] and the garbage patch has shifted
[3863.68 - 3870.48] more than a couple of hundred miles
[3867.20 - 3874.16] the garbage patch is actually
[3870.48 - 3877.28] embroaching the pacific
[3874.16 - 3880.16] coast it's really sad
[3877.28 - 3880.64] so yeah i don't like pacific spirulina
[3880.16 - 3882.56] so
[3880.64 - 3884.80] this one's the best anyway it's better
[3882.56 - 3886.00] even if i like pacific if pacific the
[3884.80 - 3888.80] ocean was still
[3886.00 - 3890.64] like good or good enough or even better
[3888.80 - 3892.64] this is the best one out there by far
[3890.64 - 3895.52] the cleanest and the most potent
[3892.64 - 3898.00] that's the bemidji all of these work
[3895.52 - 3898.00] together
[3898.24 - 3904.64] so that the metal doesn't drop
[3901.28 - 3909.20] so that the metal doesn't drop right
[3904.64 - 3913.68] all this works together
[3909.20 - 3913.68] so that the metal doesn't drop
[3914.16 - 3919.60] so if i'm a wild blueberry
[3917.36 - 3921.36] moving through the body i'm a wild
[3919.60 - 3923.04] blueberry
[3921.36 - 3924.96] i gotta get those medals out of the
[3923.04 - 3925.76] person i gotta get the medals out of the
[3924.96 - 3927.84] person
[3925.76 - 3929.84] i gotta get it well there's the metal
[3927.84 - 3932.24] i'm gonna grab the metal let me grab it
[3929.84 - 3933.36] i got it i got it okay i got the metal
[3932.24 - 3935.20] i'm gonna take it down
[3933.36 - 3936.56] we're gonna take it down kick away now
[3935.20 - 3939.68] if i was chlorella
[3936.56 - 3940.40] i'm corolla i'm chlorella corella i'm
[3939.68 - 3942.80] chlorella
[3940.40 - 3944.64] i'm chlorella chlorella clara there's
[3942.80 - 3945.28] metal oh good there's metal oops i'm
[3944.64 - 3947.84] dropping it
[3945.28 - 3951.84] hey there's the metal dropping oh my god
[3947.84 - 3951.84] dropping everything
[3954.72 - 3960.00] see let's make smoothie
[3960.40 - 3965.84] let's go let's get two cups wow
[3963.28 - 3965.84] blueberries
[3968.48 - 3973.28] if you don't like the taste of cilantro
[3970.24 - 3978.88] it's because you're highly toxic
[3973.28 - 3982.48] you got the toxic heavy metals
[3978.88 - 3982.48] you got the toxic heavy metals
[3982.80 - 3987.68] you don't like the taste you're loaded
[3985.36 - 3990.08] with metals
[3987.68 - 3991.12] you don't like the taste get the wild
[3990.08 - 3995.52] blueberries in there
[3991.12 - 3995.52] let's keep on going where's my bananas
[3997.84 - 4001.76] two cups of wild blueberries let's pop
[3999.44 - 4004.24] into bananas
[4001.76 - 4004.24] let's go
[4004.80 - 4007.84] got it moving
[4011.52 - 4017.52] michelle l hazard control laugh out loud
[4014.56 - 4019.60] if you're sensitive to anything you can
[4017.52 - 4022.48] always use smaller dosages
[4019.60 - 4024.24] that's all or sip some and sip it later
[4022.48 - 4028.40] i'm going to put a little dose in there

[4119.92 - 4123.12] while blueberry powder
[4126.08 - 4129.60] is it better to stick to the celery
[4128.32 - 4133.12] juice
[4129.60 - 4135.92] or do the metal detox
[4133.12 - 4138.32] huh we're in the heavy metal detox
[4135.92 - 4140.72] cleanse
[4138.32 - 4142.00] you do the lemon water wait 15 to 32
[4140.72 - 4144.00] minutes you know upon waking you do
[4142.00 - 4145.68] lemon water wait 15 to 30 minutes right
[4144.00 - 4147.84] 16 13 ounces of lemon water
[4145.68 - 4150.08] and then you move into the celery juice
[4147.84 - 4150.08] right
[4152.08 - 4157.52] can you go to the library when you get a
[4154.08 - 4159.36] chance and pick up cleanse the heal

[4186.32 - 4190.24] and has made that book so inexpensive it
[4189.04 - 4194.08] costs more to print it
[4190.24 - 4194.08] it's it's actually a miracle so
[4194.40 - 4202.16] it's definitely an angelic price because
