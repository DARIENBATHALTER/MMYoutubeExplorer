i'm gonna do is i'm gonna cut it this

284
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,760
way let me get the back of the carrot

285
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,760
off

286
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,880
i don't like the carrot top right the

287
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:29,680
carrot top cause a lot of times you'll

288
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,680
see the carrot top gets green

289
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,000
around the edges because when they grow

290
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,839
carrots the carrot sticks up

291
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,839
out of the ground a little bit and it

292
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,519
gets that green color and i don't like

293
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,839
that that part you shouldn't eat with

294
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:44,000
carrots

295
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:45,600
right so i like just cutting the top off

296
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,760
a touch if you guys are all right with

297
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,279
that all right i like splitting the

298
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,320
carrot

299
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,320

305
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,240
is i'll take all the carrots together

306
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,440

what do we do

487
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,960
we call the doctor

488
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:13,760
then we have to drive to the doctor or

489
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,760
travel to the doctor

490
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,400
right

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:26,640
gotta wait in the waiting room with all

494
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:29,200
the other sick people who have the flu

495
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:33,280
or the plague

496
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,280
now we have to risk that

497
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:41,600
we don't feel good

498
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:44,400

overactive bladder utis bladder

766
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:13,440
infections chronic sinusitis acne

767
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:14,799
i repeat acne is streptococcus in your

768
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,440
lymphatic

769
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,440
system

770
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:22,960
acne is streptococcus

771
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:25,440
in your lymphatic system

772
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:27,520
if you have acne

773
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,840
you have streptococcus in your liver and

774
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,840
lymphatic system and the real place it's

775
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:34,320
in is in your liver and then it ends up

776
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:36,640
feeding up into the lymphatic system

777
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:38,720
that's the streptococcus and then when

778
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,399
your cycle comes out medical medium

779
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,159
information when your cycle comes out

780
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:44,000
when your cycle's happening menstruation

781
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:46,000
is occurring for women your immune

782
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,679
system drops

783
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,200
eighty percent of your immune system

784
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:52,559
goes to your reproductive system and

785
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,559
then the acne breaks out

786
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:57,760
because you can't contain your immune

787
00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:02,000
system can't contain the streptococcus

788
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:05,000
so now your your acne is breaking out

789
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
right

790
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:10,000
okay what i love about the anti-bug

791
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,240
cleanse

792
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,440
it's not hormones what a crock of crap

793
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,960
that is

794
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,720
unbelievable

795
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,360
the one thing about conventional

796
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:21,600
medicine is it brainwashes alternative

797
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,039
medicine you think alternative medicine

798
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,640
is different than conventional medicine

799
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:26,880
when it really isn't

800
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,399
the difference is you know yeah they use

801
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,840
different treatments that's the

802
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:32,559
difference right

803
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:35,519
but rea and it's one of the differences

804
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:37,519
but the problem is the whole

805
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:39,440
trickery pattern that happened from

806
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:40,720
conventional medicine was to blame women

807
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,760
for their hormones for everything

808
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,039
anything that happened was their

809
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,720
hormones you got anxiety at your

810
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:47,120
hormones

811
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,360
if you got depression at your hormones

812
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:51,440
if you got fatigue get your hormones

813
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:53,360
if you got acne it's your hormones

814
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,360
everything was blamed on hormones this

815
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:58,080
was a pattern this was a pattern

816
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:00,240
conventional medicine did to women was

817
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:02,559
blame everything on their hormones and

818
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,399
what it did in the 1950s is it turned

819
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:05,840
this thing into it where then all of a

820
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:08,159
sudden

821
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:11,120
all the men in the 1950s were like it's

822
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:13,120
your hormones it's your hormones honey

823
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:16,080

stop it stop acting crazy honey stop

825
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,200
acting nuts

826
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,720
your anxiety is your hormones the doctor

827
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,519
said it's your hormones honey your

828
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,519
depression is your hormones

829
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:28,320
that's what happened that was the 1950s

830
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:30,080
right alternative medicine

831
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:32,559
i'll turn the medicine

832
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:34,880
it's like it's like it it is it's just

833
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:37,440
basically an echo of conventional

834
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:39,279
medicine in so many ways right here's

835
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,200
one example you talk to an alternative

836
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:43,200
functional medicine doctor and you say

837
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,519
well wait a minute

838
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,279
a doctor it what's what's the is

839
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:48,480
the shingles chicken pox and the

840
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:51,279
alternative doctor will be like

841
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:53,600
functional doctor bill uh yes um the

842
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:56,720
chickenpox virus is the shingles no it's

843
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:58,960
not it's two different viruses they echo

844
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,799
everything from conventional medicine

845
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,640
everything's echoed from it you think

846
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:04,240
alternative medicine is just something

847
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,279
completely different

848
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,399
sure

849
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:08,799
and then when you go to alternative

850
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:10,880
doctors in the clinics in the medical

851
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:12,640
prestigious medical clinics that you

852
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:15,200
know the ones that are conventional the

853
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,559
ones right you go to alternative doctors

854
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,919
and i'll say you go to alternative

855
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,360
doctors at the mayo clinic you go to

856
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:21,120
alter alternative doctors at the

857
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,799
cleveland clinic you could alter an

858
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,559
alternative doc doctors see your side

those all turn doctors they're playing

861
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:28,640
by rules

862
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:32,240
um

863
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:35,120
we can't do that for you sir or ma'am

864
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:37,360
nope we're under yep we're under the

865
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:39,760
rules here

866
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:43,120
yeah we're alternative physicians

867
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:45,120
but we're under the rules

868
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:47,360
you think you got an alternative they're

869
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,799
the alternative sections there i know

870
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,760
because i know doctors in all those

871
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:51,279
clinics

872
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,960
and i know alternative doctors in all

873
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:56,080
those clinics

874
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:57,519
and so they're under rules

875
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,880
rules

876
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:01,120
you know what i mean

877
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,720
and that and that's another thing too so

878
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,240
what happens is people think altered

879
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,559
medicine's alternative it's like yeah a

880
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,320
little bit it is a little bit but it

881
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:11,520
became one

882
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,520
it's become one

883
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,879
sean

884
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:19,359
shimon says that one never made sense to

885
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:22,639
me how can one virus turn into another

886
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:24,960
virus how can all those smart doctors be

887
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:27,919
buying that i'll tell you why it doesn't

888
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,919
mean they're smart

889
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,040
doesn't mean they're smart

890
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,119
the one thing i've learned throughout

891
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:38,399
all these years and that's coming from

892
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:40,240
an uneducated person right here okay

893
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:42,240
the only reason why these books are

894
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:44,159
written is because spirit of compassion

895
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:46,079
gives me every word if spirit of

896
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,159
compassion didn't give me every word you

897
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:52,240
wouldn't see a medical medium book i'm

898
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:52,240
not a highly educated person

899
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,480
but i'm street smart

900
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:58,720
i'm street smart

901
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,200
you can be the smartest

902
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,400
person

903
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:04,880
academic-wise go through medical school

904
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:08,000
and be the most dumbest ass the dumbest

905
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:10,400
ass you ever met out there

906
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,960
and that's one of the reasons

907
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:15,359
so when you go you lose your common

908
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,520
sense there's no common sense left so

909
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:18,880
you can be this brilliant physician and

910
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,760
still think

911
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:25,520
shingles is the chickenpox virus when

912
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,520
they're two separate viruses

913
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:31,520
the only reason why medical medium

914
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,040
information has saved the lives more

915
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:35,839
lives with chronic illness around the

916
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:38,240
world than any other any other

917
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:39,520
any other modality any other belief

918
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,680
system out there because the medical

919
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:46,240
medium is in a belief system

920
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:48,000
it doesn't it doesn't segregate

921
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,680
like it doesn't segregate and say oh you

922
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,400
can't do medical medium eating animal

923
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:54,320
protein no this is just veganism or

924
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,960
we're we're animal protein you can't be

925
00:35:54,320 --> 00:36:00,640
a vegan medical medium information is

926
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:02,800
not occult but the colts out there

927
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:05,680
they're they're they're locked in

928
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:08,000
they're locked in those colts you gotta

929
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:10,480
buy into those colts and you get locked

930
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,800
into those colts right those are the

931
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:16,480
colts that's why you don't heal you

932
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:18,880
don't heal in colts you can't heal in

933
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,640
any of those colds because when you even

934
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,320
if you are healing a little you get

935
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:25,440
screwed up and go backwards and go down

936
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:28,000
the drain you can't heal in a cult

937
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,599

and the cause of chronic illness that

944
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,240
that medical media put out there such as

945
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:50,240
epstein-barr and the reactivated

946
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,920
epstein-barr all that information that

947
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,520
got out there and how shingles works and

948
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,280
the cause of it how there's over 30

949
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:58,000
varieties of shingles and all these

950
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:01,040
things all this information these broken

951
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:05,040
barriers turn people's lives around you

952
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:05,040
guys we're doing the anti-bug cleanse

953
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,599
it's over 60 varieties of that steam bar

954
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,359
and growing

955
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,880
and growing

956
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:15,520
you're somebody here's how it works

957
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,640
somebody with an epstein-barr

958
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:20,480
right

959
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:23,520
and then you pick up another epstein bar

960
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:26,640
two epstein bars inside the body

961
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:28,800
can create a new epstein bar that new

962
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,760
epstein bar then you pass to someone

963
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,680
else

964
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,520
that new epstein bar is different than

965
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:36,720
the other epstein bars

966
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:39,200
that's how it can happen too

967
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:41,119
so i just made some celery juice

968
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:43,280
one of the greatest tools

969
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:46,000
of all time happening right there big

970
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:49,359
part of people healing i'm cooking

974
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:57,040
you had mono and it disappeared forever

975
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:59,280
that's it they didn't know epstein barr

976
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,640
caused the neurological symptom

977
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,160
they didn't know epstein-barr caused

978
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,400
hashimoto's thyroiditis multiple

979
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,000
sclerosis lupus fibromyalgia

980
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,680
chronic fatigue syndrome me chronic

981
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,440
fatigue syndrome they didn't know they

982
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,040
didn't know it caused tinnitus ringing

983
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,040
in the air vertigo they didn't know yeah

984
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,640
this is an interesting one and i thought

985
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,400
look i saw someone make a comment of

986
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,720
this about this and it's so true right

987
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,640
in the medical medium feed

988
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:23,200
is

989
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:25,599
now i have an answer

990
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:28,320
for why i have vertigo

991
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:30,800
they told me it was crystals

992
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:34,320
in the ear

993
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:37,839
crystals in the air right in the ear

994
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:41,760
crystals in your ears right

995
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:45,760
but the person was 20 years old

996
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:48,640
you can't get crystals in the ear at 20.

997
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:52,800
you get them when you're in your 50s

998
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:55,599
60s up and 70s

999
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:58,720
and that doesn't cause

1000
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:00,560
vertigo crystals in the ear do not cause

1001
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:03,839
vertigo vertigo is caused by

1002
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:05,839
epstein-barr inflaming the vagus nerve

1003
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:07,680
and here you've got a 20 year old that's

1004
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:10,000
waking up to it through medical medium

1005
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:12,839
information and waking up to it saying

1006
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:16,400
wait a minute i'm 20 years old

1007
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:19,200
i crystals in the air don't even exist

1008
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,880
in a 20 year old

1009
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,480

1010
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,480

this doesn't mean go buy a chicken it

1156
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:55,599
doesn't mean go buy a whole bunch of

1157
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:58,400
chickens and start a chicken coop that's

1158
00:44:55,599 --> 00:45:01,280
not what it means this is your chance to

1159
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:04,240

1161
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:09,520
chance you can actually break away

because there's going to be an egg

1163
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:13,119

like sushi is healthy but all i see with

1178
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:51,760

1180
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:55,440
that's all i see with sushi

1181
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,319
okay

1182
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:01,119

00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:07,599
mercury and vinegar

1186
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,599
so healthy

1187
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,680
anybody coming on here vinegar is not

1188
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,839
healthy at all it's something you don't

1189
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:16,880
want to

1190
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:19,040
do so stew is definitely a stew

1191
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,640
there's no question so what i'm doing is

1192
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:23,839
turning down the heat

1193
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:23,839
that baby looks good

1194
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:28,880
okay

1195
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:30,640
pork is a blood thickener so here's the

1196
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:33,440
rules

1197
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:35,920
the anti-bug cleanse is really awesome

1198
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:39,200
you get away from bug fuel

1199
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:40,400
you get away from blood thickeners

1200
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,960
right

1201
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:44,800
you get away from

1202
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:49,040
dehydrators of the body and you get away

1203
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:49,040
from toxin contributors

1204
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:54,079

pick right

1206
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:58,400
and what i love about taking out pork is

1207
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:00,560
you you open up the doors for more

1208
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:04,560
oxygen inside your blood because pork

1209
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:07,440
swallows up the oxygen and takes it away

1210
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,440
level three

1211
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:11,920

1235
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:05,200
that like

1236
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:08,400
sunflower oil sunflower seeds is like

1237
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:09,680
the reason why the whole world's sick

1238
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:12,240
the whole world's sick because of

1239
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:13,119
sunflower oil and sunflower seeds

1240
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,800
really

1241
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:16,480
i'm scratching my head on that one

1242
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:19,280
because i got friends that never ate a

1243
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:22,480
sunflower seed in their life

1244
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,480
and they're so sick

1245
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:27,040
a lot of the vegan doctors come out with

1246
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:29,280
a new thing every other minute

1247
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:30,240
food science dictates that it's not a

1248
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,640
mega

1249
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:35,760
it's not omega-6s that are good for you

1250
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:37,280
now it's omega-3s it's a we're all sick

1251
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:41,599
the whole world is sick because of

1252
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:43,440
omega-6 it's because of sunflower seeds

1253
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:45,280
so you're sick in bed right now on

1254
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:48,240
mattress island with your lupus because

1255
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:50,800
of sunflower seeds do you understand how

1256
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:52,880
ironically stupid the whole thing is how

1257
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:54,559
every time the vegan doctors even speak

1258
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:55,839
it's almost embarrassing like i can't

1259
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:58,000
handle it

1260
00:48:55,839 --> 00:49:00,720
every time the vegan doctors speak out

1261
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,800
there it's like holy are you sitti

1262
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,680
oh my god here we go again what is he

1263
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:08,160
saying

1264
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:08,160
what is he saying what is dr saying

1265
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:12,400
michelle l haha every other minute

1266
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:14,240
something else exactly

1267
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:16,319
the reason why the whole world is sick

1268
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:19,119
is because of potatoes

1269
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:22,480
because i'm scratching my head on that

1270
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:25,200
francisca my doctors says my anemia is

1271
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:28,200
due to veganism frustrating

1272
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:28,200
unbelievable

1273
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,559
so now the vegan doctors believe the

1274
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:37,359
whole world is sick

1275
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:39,599
because of sunflower seeds

1276
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:42,480
how many sunflower seeds have you eaten

1277
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:45,760
in your lifetime

1278
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:48,800
so your your multiple sclerosis ms right

ms your lupus your fibromyalgia your rna

1280
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:53,839

psoriasis from sunflower seeds says the

1282
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:58,079
the vegan doctors

1283
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:00,720
my god but no they'll just come out with

1284
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:02,720
another stupid book

1285
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:04,480
and another

1286
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:06,400
and they'll put a million dollars behind

1287
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:08,240
it with the pr company

1288
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,760
and they'll sell crap

1289
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:12,160
and they'll send everybody down the

1290
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:14,480
wrong direction and no one stops it

1291
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:17,280
because you can't it's a train that

1292
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,280
takes you to hell

1293
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:23,839
and i love this a doctor is going to

1294
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:27,599
tell you so your doctor says my anemia

1295
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:29,040
is due to veganism when literally

1296
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:31,599
there are

1297
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:34,480
millions tens of millions of people that

1298
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:36,480
eat animal protein that are anemic

1299
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:38,720
so i'm scratching my head on that

1300
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:41,040
there's tens of millions of people women

1301
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:42,640
that are anemic that eat animal protein

1302
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:44,640
but for some reason you're you're you're

1303
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:46,160
anemias because of

1304
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:47,760

crap

1349
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:21,520
by the way nutritional yeast has msg in

1350
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:24,240
it

1351
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:26,079

1352
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:28,079
okay that they add to it

1353
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:30,160
you know you know why they add stuff to

1354
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:32,640
nutritional yeast did you guys know why

1355
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:36,079
it's the same way they add

1356
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:37,839
uh they fortify white bread

1357
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:39,440
they enrich

1358
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:41,200
white bread

1359
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:42,559
and white rice

1360
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:44,319
right

1361
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:46,720
they enrich

1362
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:48,240
white rice flour and white bread

1363
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:49,280
right wheat flour that's been stripped

1364
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:51,839
of everything

1365
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:53,839

consumption

1368
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:59,440
so they fortify it

1369
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:01,359
and then they get you addicted to that

1370
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:03,520
glutamic acid

1371
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:05,359
