[0.44 - 3.76] weaker than people's livers already are
[2.32 - 6.80] out there so we're making two kinds of
[3.76 - 8.92] guacamole two kinds of guacamole
[6.80 - 10.56] interesting not so bad on the liver
[8.92 - 12.84] compared to what people are Downing
[10.56 - 14.92] right now at this time of year and we're
[12.84 - 17.44] making hummuses we might make three
[14.92 - 17.44] kinds of
[19.04 - 24.84] hummus
[21.60 - 27.04] crazy making ice cream mango ice cream
[24.84 - 28.96] is the one I'm choosing to do I'm pumped
[27.04 - 31.44] about that okay what else am I making
[28.96 - 33.76] what else got a cre T I got the
[31.44 - 36.48] guacamole I got that I got oh Walnut
[33.76 - 38.08] butter don't miss out on that and I'm
[36.48 - 40.16] going to hide the label right here just
[38.08 - 43.32] like I do and that is a very popular
[40.16 - 45.80] brand what you see here is an inch of
[43.32 - 47.20] oil on top of a very popular Nut Butter
[45.80 - 49.32] that's out there that people eat every
[47.20 - 52.48] single day and people don't leave me
[49.32 - 55.44] some of them but just so you know oil is
[52.48 - 56.96] added to the nut Butters the really good
[55.44 - 59.56] nut Butters the seed Butters all of it
[56.96 - 61.60] out there oil hidden oil is at it that's
[59.56 - 63.68] what they do people don't realize that
[61.60 - 65.64] and we're going to make a walnut butter
[63.68 - 68.28] without that and this is what it's going
[65.64 - 71.00] to end up kind of looking like you ready
[68.28 - 72.88] I made this Nut Butter months ago I'm
[71.00 - 75.20] pretty sure it was months ago and do you
[72.88 - 77.96] see the oil spilling out no you see
[75.20 - 79.40] actually nut butter in here but not oil
[77.96 - 81.72] spilling out how do you like that
[79.40 - 83.20] there's another one too check this out I
[81.72 - 86.44] made this one
[83.20 - 89.48] too right take a look take a look take a
[86.44 - 91.92] look take a look look look look and what
[89.48 - 94.16] you see is how come where's all the oil
[91.92 - 95.84] where's the oil no oil and I make nut
[94.16 - 97.88] Butters almond almond butter peanut
[95.84 - 100.88] butter you name it and that's the key
[97.88 - 102.68] because everybody buys oil added in
[100.88 - 104.32] their nut Butters and they don't realize
[102.68 - 106.48] it and it's really sad so we're going to
[104.32 - 108.20] talk about that all that oil on top of
[106.48 - 110.00] that nut butter right there and when you
[108.20 - 112.48] get nut butter and it doesn't look it
[110.00 - 114.12] was freshly made pretty recently by a
[112.48 - 115.92] company and then they put it out there
[114.12 - 118.12] and then over time though as the thing
[115.92 - 120.64] settle a few months later the cupboard
[118.12 - 122.12] all that oil Rises right there that's
[120.64 - 124.48] the that's the whole thing I want to
[122.12 - 126.08] talk about too but anyway it's not about
[124.48 - 129.04] that entirely because we're making all
[126.08 - 133.80] that with the mm 1500 right there best
[129.04 - 136.24] sale ever in the mm500 $140 off
[133.80 - 137.96] $140 off get it for somebody for
[136.24 - 141.28] Christmas if you waited all year and you
[137.96 - 144.64] don't have the MN 1500 hands down the MN
[141.28 - 146.00] 1500 saves people money I'm watching out
[144.64 - 148.20] there all the time I'm just going to say
[146.00 - 150.16] this I'm just going to say this but the
[148.20 - 151.56] users that are getting popular because
[150.16 - 153.52] they got money behind them and
[151.56 - 155.92] advertising and influencers behind them
[153.52 - 157.92] those juicers spinning baskets and
[155.92 - 160.04] everything else they don't squeeze
[157.92 - 162.08] enough juice out of the produce and so
[160.04 - 163.68] essentially you're throwing away money
[162.08 - 165.72] and people who are chronically sick are
[163.68 - 168.24] trying to juice every day people in the
[165.72 - 170.56] medical mem Community who juice a ton of
[168.24 - 173.44] stuff they can't just be buying cases
[170.56 - 175.40] and cases of produce juicing it and
[173.44 - 177.08] having not the results because you're
[175.40 - 179.08] not getting enough nutrients extracted
[177.08 - 181.28] from the juice it's not actually doing
[179.08 - 183.60] its job get the juice out and they're
[181.28 - 185.96] throwing away produce all that leftover
[183.60 - 187.48] pulp is getting thrown away so if you're
[185.96 - 189.56] somebody that's really wealthy and you
[187.48 - 191.20] don't care and you just you you want to
[189.56 - 193.76] use the juicers that actually only
[191.20 - 196.20] extract some juice but not a lot you're
[193.76 - 197.52] running lots and lots of prod then fine
[196.20 - 199.48] that's fine but a lot of people want to
[197.52 - 201.64] save money and a lot of people want to
[199.48 - 204.04] be able to actually juice like celery
[201.64 - 206.92] and everything else without actually
[204.04 - 209.32] spending a ton of money saving thousands
[206.92 - 211.96] over the time so that's what I love
[209.32 - 213.64] about the M 1500 the 900 this is the mm
[211.96 - 215.48] 1500 right here you guys know I work
[213.64 - 217.84] with the mega link is in the description
[215.48 - 221.84] link is in the profile but we're talking
[217.84 - 224.64] today about eating to protect your liver
[221.84 - 226.36] so eating foods to protect your liver
[224.64 - 230.68] because what people don't realize they
[226.36 - 233.56] have overburdened stagnant sluggish hot
[230.68 - 235.08] livers that are filled with fat the
[233.56 - 237.32] liers get dysfunctional and then your
[235.08 - 239.28] cholesterol gets out of whack everything
[237.32 - 240.92] else gets out of whack deficiencies
[239.28 - 242.92] start to happen because your liver is
[240.92 - 244.20] the great converter let's talk about
[242.92 - 246.40] that for a minute if you just got on
[244.20 - 248.48] here I'm going to be making a ton of
[246.40 - 250.00] food you see everything here if you're
[248.48 - 252.20] getting kicked off IG I see a whole
[250.00 - 253.60] bunch of people getting kicked off of IG
[252.20 - 254.92] so it looks like IG is definitely going
[253.60 - 257.72] to be doing some serious censoring on
[254.92 - 260.64] this one so what you do is go to medical
[257.72 - 262.68] medium.com and go there I'm streaming

[283.16 - 288.20] this right now and also streaming live
[285.16 - 290.20] on medicalmedium.com right now so you
[288.20 - 291.32] guys we're going to make some food we're
[290.20 - 293.00] going to talk about the liver a little
[291.32 - 296.28] bit too so what happens with people's
[293.00 - 297.92] livers is that they actually burden them
[296.28 - 300.84] and they don't realize they burden them
[297.92 - 302.52] so they overburden livers every single
[300.84 - 304.08] day and that's what we're kind of taught
[302.52 - 306.52] we're not taught how to protect our
[304.08 - 308.12] liver how to look after our liver how to
[306.52 - 309.88] get our liver in a better place and then
[308.12 - 312.00] over time our liver stops working the
[309.88 - 314.04] way it should work it doesn't produce
[312.00 - 317.32] enough bile and when that bile isn't
[314.04 - 318.96] produced we get in trouble and all that
[317.32 - 320.12] fat sits around it doesn't break down
[318.96 - 321.80] good enough it sits around in our
[320.12 - 323.56] bloodstream then it eventually collects
[321.80 - 326.12] in Our arteries then it collects in our
[323.56 - 329.00] veins and over time we get problems
[326.12 - 330.84] where we have all this plaque jacked up
[329.00 - 333.16] all around around our blood vessels
[330.84 - 334.80] veins arteries our liver gets sluggish
[333.16 - 337.00] another thing too you go to the doctor
[334.80 - 338.64] doctor takes blood work the blood work
[337.00 - 339.72] comes back you're deficient in this
[338.64 - 341.40] you're deficient in that you're
[339.72 - 344.76] deficient in this and all these
[341.40 - 346.44] deficiencies over time partly happen
[344.76 - 348.96] because your liver is the great
[346.44 - 350.60] converter what it does is it actually
[348.96 - 354.00] converts the
[350.60 - 355.96] nutrients and we don't have good livers
[354.00 - 357.84] these days so we don't get good
[355.96 - 360.76] conversion because you want good
[357.84 - 363.84] conversion every single nutrient you eat
[360.76 - 365.52] almost every single nutrient you eat
[363.84 - 367.00] nutrients that come from your leafy
[365.52 - 369.48] greens nutrients that come from your
[367.00 - 371.52] onions your broccoli your radishes your
[369.48 - 373.60] carrots everything your lemons your
[371.52 - 376.20] limes your Tomatoes your avocados all
[373.60 - 377.92] those nutrients have to be converted
[376.20 - 380.76] they go into the liver boom they go up
[377.92 - 383.56] the hepatic portal highway right into
[380.76 - 385.52] the liver here and when that happens
[383.56 - 388.08] your liver says whoa It's conversion
[385.52 - 390.80] time so your liver has to anoint and
[388.08 - 392.80] bless the nutrients is what it has to do
[390.80 - 394.32] and people don't realize this they think
[392.80 - 395.92] that if you take a whole bunch of
[394.32 - 397.80] supplements the supplements are going to
[395.92 - 398.92] work for you you take a whole bunch of
[397.80 - 400.76] different things are going to work for
[398.92 - 403.52] you and partially that partially that's
[400.76 - 406.76] true but your liver still has to
[403.52 - 410.20] methylate it still has to convert it
[406.76 - 412.48] still has to anoint and turn and change
[410.20 - 414.76] the nutrients around around a little bit
[412.48 - 417.56] it has to bless them enzymes from the
[414.76 - 420.84] liver attach to the nutrients carry the
[417.56 - 422.32] nutrients along change the nutrients too
[420.84 - 424.20] and then the liver has to store the
[422.32 - 426.88] nutrients at the same time but if we
[424.20 - 428.84] overburden we beat down our livers we
[426.88 - 431.36] drink alcohol we do all kinds of stuff
[428.84 - 434.84] we eat really greasy food fried foods we
[431.36 - 437.60] eat too much oil in everything we get in
[434.84 - 440.56] trouble the liver ends up weakening and
[437.60 - 444.04] when it weakens it can't convert it will
[440.56 - 445.92] not do that conversion that we need so
[444.04 - 448.16] we walk around our liver is getting
[445.92 - 450.92] tired it's getting stagnant it's getting
[448.16 - 453.16] sluggish and then it's not doing its job
[450.92 - 456.16] every day and then we go to bed at night
[453.16 - 459.12] and our liver is tired it's too tired to
[456.16 - 461.56] work hard for us all night long so what
[459.12 - 464.64] happens when you go to bed at night your
[461.56 - 468.12] liver starts to work that's when it
[464.64 - 470.68] clocks in mainly clocks in in the middle
[468.12 - 473.40] of the night that's where it starts to
[470.68 - 475.64] bag up all the garbage all the junk all
[473.40 - 478.40] the toxins all the poisons they get
[475.64 - 480.20] bagged up in the middle of the night and
[478.40 - 482.32] you got to keep that in mind right so
[480.20 - 484.76] when we sleep our liver working while
[482.32 - 487.40] we're resting that's how it works our
[484.76 - 489.00] liver working while we're resting think
[487.40 - 490.56] about a whole bunch of elves inside your
[489.00 - 492.48] liver and they're making all kinds of
[490.56 - 495.00] toys and they're doing all kinds of
[492.48 - 497.44] stuff and they're using Hammers and saws
[495.00 - 501.08] they're working all night long while
[497.44 - 503.84] you're sleeping and resting but when our
[501.08 - 505.72] livers get tired and they get beat up
[503.84 - 508.52] and they get overburdened and they get
[505.72 - 510.84] fatty and they start to get sluggish and
[508.52 - 513.32] stagnant when they work in the middle of
[510.84 - 516.96] the night they're not as efficient our
[513.32 - 518.80] livers are not as working as they should
[516.96 - 520.52] or efficient as they should so in the
[518.80 - 522.24] middle of the night we sit there and
[520.52 - 524.68] sometimes people toss in turns some
[522.24 - 526.76] sometimes people have more gas sometimes
[524.68 - 528.32] people have they're waking up in the
[526.76 - 529.60] middle of the night sometimes people
[528.32 - 531.20] don't feel good when they're trying to
[529.60 - 533.48] sleep they're tossing and turning and a
[531.20 - 536.68] lot of that is liver spasming out the
[533.48 - 539.68] liver the liver being stressed out
[536.68 - 541.76] overburdened stagnant and struggling so
[539.68 - 545.32] people get liver spasms they don't even
[541.76 - 547.32] know it a lot of people live with liver
[545.32 - 549.92] spasms have no idea that's what's
[547.32 - 552.96] happening and inside their body they got
[549.92 - 555.36] an unhappy liver every single day that
[552.96 - 558.04] wants to perform that wants to move
[555.36 - 561.48] forward that wants to heal that wants to
[558.04 - 563.32] get better but it just can't do what it
[561.48 - 566.28] needs to do and every single day it's
[563.32 - 569.36] repeat right we then overburden it again
[566.28 - 572.00] we do alcohol we overburden it with two
[569.36 - 574.56] much fat we end up eating too many
[572.00 - 576.60] treats and when we do that our liver is
[574.56 - 579.24] like oh here it goes again so let's talk
[576.60 - 583.32] about bio reserves most people walking
[579.24 - 585.68] around have low bile reserves what that
[583.32 - 588.40] means is their liver is not producing
[585.68 - 590.88] enough bile to break down the fats now
[588.40 - 592.44] bile does more than break down fats bile
[590.88 - 595.32] breaks down a lot of different aspects
[592.44 - 598.28] of the food but fat is one of the number
[595.32 - 601.56] one things that the bile actually does
[598.28 - 604.08] but our bile is low for most people
[601.56 - 606.80] walking around we have low bile and what
[604.08 - 610.36] happens is food rots in the gut when you
[606.80 - 612.88] have reduced bile levels inside your
[610.36 - 615.24] liver bile that's not potent it's not
[612.88 - 617.64] strong one problem that happens when
[615.24 - 620.36] your bile is not potent and strong is
[617.64 - 623.56] that it's not doing its job when it goes
[620.36 - 625.68] up the bile duck when it gets into the
[623.56 - 627.72] gallbladder our gallbladder start
[625.68 - 629.88] getting wasted they start becoming a
[627.72 - 632.32] trash compound they start start becoming
[629.88 - 635.44] a trash dump and when our gallbladder
[632.32 - 638.00] becomes a trash dump okay and it can't
[635.44 - 639.88] be cleaned out we get in trouble then we
[638.00 - 641.40] get the gall stones then we get the sand
[639.88 - 643.28] in the gallbladder then we get all the
[641.40 - 644.84] different gallbladder spasms and
[643.28 - 648.24] problems a lot of people have to have
[644.84 - 653.08] their gallbladders removed but when your
[648.24 - 655.64] B is strong and potent and really
[653.08 - 658.36] aggressive you can't collect a lot of
[655.64 - 661.00] sediment inside the gallbladder you
[658.36 - 662.72] can't collect a lot of Sandy sediment
[661.00 - 664.64] stones and so forth inside the
[662.72 - 667.16] gallbladder when the bile is really
[664.64 - 670.60] vibrant it has vitality and it's strong
[667.16 - 672.56] and it actually is Gusto what happens is
[670.60 - 674.48] if it's not doesn't have that Gusto if
[672.56 - 676.64] it's not that strong if your bile is
[674.48 - 679.92] weak and you're producing less bile like
[676.64 - 682.16] most people are the sludge builds up
[679.92 - 684.12] inside the gallbladder the gallbladder
[682.16 - 687.60] needs to be awaken it needs to be
[684.12 - 690.32] shocked it needs to be pushed hard and
[687.60 - 693.20] if our bile reserves are our gallbladder
[690.32 - 694.68] is going to get stagnant too so boom we
[693.20 - 697.60] got the liver that's stagnant and
[694.68 - 699.64] sluggish and then boom we got the
[697.60 - 702.04] gallbladder that's stagnant and sluggish
[699.64 - 703.28] you see how it works that's what happens
[702.04 - 704.84] there's people out there that're like I
[703.28 - 706.56] want to do gallbladder flush I want to
[704.84 - 708.40] take care of my gallbladder I got gall
[706.56 - 710.08] stones I'm worried about gallbladder
[708.40 - 712.76] problems and then what they don't
[710.08 - 716.56] realize is they got liver problems they
[712.76 - 719.16] had liver problems first not Gall
[716.56 - 721.76] gallbladder problems first had liver
[719.16 - 724.68] problems first so what happens is when
[721.76 - 727.76] your bile is your bile reserves are low
[724.68 - 731.04] stagnant sluggish and dirty and fill the
[727.76 - 733.60] trash and garbage and then weak it goes
[731.04 - 736.24] into the gallbladder and doesn't come
[733.60 - 739.20] out easy and then the gallbladder gets
[736.24 - 741.68] fatter and fatter and fatter and fatter
[739.20 - 744.80] the gallbladder gets heavier and heavier
[741.68 - 748.92] and becomes a sack of mud a sack of
[744.80 - 751.24] stones a sack of sand so a lot of people
[748.92 - 753.56] walk around and they got basically a
[751.24 - 756.32] sack of stones and sand inside their
[753.56 - 758.84] gallbladder it's just this little sack
[756.32 - 762.96] that's filled up and how did it get like
[758.84 - 766.76] that because bile was weak for a long
[762.96 - 769.80] time bile reserves were low for a long
[766.76 - 771.84] time and because of that all that trash
[769.80 - 773.68] and garbage and poisons and toxins that
[771.84 - 775.80] came out of the liver as the liver got
[773.68 - 777.80] stagnant and sluggish they all landed
[775.80 - 780.52] inside the gallbladder and there wasn't
[777.80 - 784.00] enough body bile to go in there and
[780.52 - 786.80] flush and push and flush and the potency
[784.00 - 791.76] of the bile wasn't strong enough to
[786.80 - 795.08] dissolve dissolve bile is extremely
[791.76 - 798.48] powerful it's a dissolvent it's supposed
[795.08 - 801.08] to break down fats and dissolve them
[798.48 - 804.40] that's what bile does but when it
[801.08 - 807.00] weakens it can't go and do that as much
[804.40 - 809.28] so it enters into the gallbladder and it
[807.00 - 812.16] can't do its job it's weak
[809.28 - 815.08] it's lost its viscosity it's lost its
[812.16 - 818.44] power it's not as powerful as it needs
[815.08 - 821.24] to be it's not as stringent and that AR
[818.44 - 822.76] stringency is gone away from the bile
[821.24 - 825.52] and when it's gone and away from the
[822.76 - 828.04] bile we get in trouble the gallbladder
[825.52 - 830.76] starts to get Gnarly nasty filled with
[828.04 - 832.92] junk garbage and sand and becomes a sack
[830.76 - 834.44] of mud and that's what happens and
[832.92 - 835.72] people walk around it could take years
[834.44 - 838.88] you could be walking around through your
[835.72 - 840.44] life and it could take years and your go
[838.88 - 842.64] bladder just builds up and builds up
[840.44 - 845.16] more slug you know more sludge in there
[842.64 - 847.44] more problems inside there and then boom
[845.16 - 849.40] it hits us we have the spasms we have a
[847.44 - 852.20] problem we're having a we're putting
[849.40 - 854.56] castor oil packs on our gallbladder we
[852.20 - 857.04] live like that and that's a it's not a
[854.56 - 858.52] fun place to be it's taking casserole
[857.04 - 860.36] packs and you're looking up things and
[858.52 - 862.04] you're using all kinds of stuff you're
[860.36 - 863.24] on the internet what can I do for
[862.04 - 865.48] gallbladder what can I do for
[863.24 - 867.12] gallbladder then we're in that hell
[865.48 - 869.28] which is oh my God I don't want to get
[867.12 - 871.32] this gallbladder out the doctor says
[869.28 - 873.76] it's going to turn Gang Green they did
[871.32 - 875.80] an M they did a CAT scan they think my
[873.76 - 878.44] gall bladder's got a problem what am I
[875.80 - 880.20] going to do what's going to happen and
[878.44 - 881.72] then you're back into the emergency room
[880.20 - 883.60] then you're back in the doctor's office
[881.72 - 885.32] and your gallbladder is becoming a
[883.60 - 887.68] problem it's getting heavier it's
[885.32 - 891.20] getting the sand it's getting the slug
[887.68 - 893.84] the sludge in there and meanwhile how
[891.20 - 896.56] did that even happen it happened because
[893.84 - 899.48] the liver wasn't taken care of the liver
[896.56 - 901.84] wasn't nurtured there wasn't enough Good
[899.48 - 904.16] Foods going into the liver there wasn't
[901.84 - 906.04] enough nutrients going into the liver to
[904.16 - 909.44] shake it up to wake it up to keep it
[906.04 - 911.88] going it wasn't there we starved our
[909.44 - 914.00] liver of nutrients we starved our liver
[911.88 - 915.76] of the things it needs like the glucose
[914.00 - 917.40] and the nutrients and the trace mineral
[915.76 - 921.08] salts and everything that the liver
[917.40 - 922.80] needs we starved it we didn't do it on
[921.08 - 925.28] purpose it's not your fault it's
[922.80 - 927.32] nobody's fault it happened it just
[925.28 - 929.36] happened and that's how it works we're
[927.32 - 931.60] not taught we don't know what to do a
[929.36 - 934.04] lot of us don't have the access to do so
[931.60 - 935.92] or the resources and we just go through
[934.04 - 939.16] life and our liver gets stagnant and
[935.92 - 941.16] sluggish and eventually the gallbladder
[939.16 - 942.88] pays the price and so many people get
[941.16 - 944.44] their gallbladder out later you know if
[942.88 - 947.20] you can do like a
[944.44 - 950.00] futuristic futuristic history with
[947.20 - 952.08] people okay you look at a person you see
[950.00 - 953.20] them now like they are hey they're doing
[952.08 - 955.20] good they're out in the street they're
[953.20 - 957.04] doing stuff they're playing pickle ball
[955.20 - 958.76] they're having fun or they're out there
[957.04 - 960.32] playing tennis and they're having fun or
[958.76 - 962.32] they're swimming or on their be on the
[960.32 - 963.64] beach they're paddle boarding they're
[962.32 - 965.36] doing what they want they're biking
[963.64 - 967.20] they're having a good time you're like
[965.36 - 968.36] okay that's great right they look like
[967.20 - 969.96] they're in good shape they look like
[968.36 - 972.48] they're taking care of themselves or
[969.96 - 975.68] they're just living their life and then
[972.48 - 978.04] go go 40 years ahead of time and you see
[975.68 - 981.36] and it's like a war zone right people's
[978.04 - 984.32] lives change things happen I had a penic
[981.36 - 986.56] out I had you know pentis I had a
[984.32 - 988.12] gallbladder out I had that I had this
[986.56 - 989.92] other problem here I got this other
[988.12 - 992.32] problem here here you know I got four
[989.92 - 995.08] nodules on my thyroid I had a thyroid
[992.32 - 997.56] surgery I had this times change and life
[995.08 - 1000.04] changes as the years go on but how do we
[997.56 - 1003.88] get to that point when it comes down to
[1000.04 - 1006.12] gallbladders okay that is Cash Cow for
[1003.88 - 1008.32] the hospitals Cash Cow for big Pharma
[1006.12 - 1010.12] Cash Cow for the industry the medical
[1008.32 - 1012.24] industry it's the gallbladder business
[1010.12 - 1016.60] and a big part of that is because the
[1012.24 - 1019.08] liver has lost its Gusto it's been
[1016.60 - 1021.84] nutrient deficient over time it's not
[1019.08 - 1024.68] converting the bow weakened it's not
[1021.84 - 1026.72] strong it's not potent it's not going
[1024.68 - 1028.88] right up into the gallbladder it's not
[1026.72 - 1030.68] driving deep into the gallbladder and
[1028.88 - 1033.08] pushing out the sludge and pushing out
[1030.68 - 1036.04] the garbage instead we get in trouble
[1033.08 - 1038.16] right Ron says cast oil packs can help
[1036.04 - 1040.52] break up gall stones and kidney stones
[1038.16 - 1043.80] as well I've never seen them break them
[1040.52 - 1046.48] up I like CER oil packs I like them for
[1043.80 - 1048.48] pain relief for people I do kind of acts
[1046.48 - 1051.00] like an outside it's kind of acts like
[1048.48 - 1052.56] an anti-inflammatory like a quick relief
[1051.00 - 1054.40] anti-inflammatory so I'm not against
[1052.56 - 1056.80] castor oil packs I think they're great
[1054.40 - 1059.40] but I don't see them actually break up
[1056.80 - 1061.64] kidney stones in people it's you know
[1059.40 - 1063.00] but I see them give people relief though
[1061.64 - 1064.88] when they got the kidney stones and the
[1063.00 - 1067.84] gallbladder stones it gives them that
[1064.88 - 1069.92] relief that I've seen for sure all the
[1067.84 - 1072.00] 35 years I've been doing this I see it
[1069.92 - 1073.24] give people relief but they still end up
[1072.00 - 1075.84] if they're you know if they if their
[1073.24 - 1077.68] gallbladder gets all filled up with that
[1075.84 - 1080.92] sand and that garbage and they don't
[1077.68 - 1082.60] have enough of that liver power to do
[1080.92 - 1085.04] what it needs to do to help get that
[1082.60 - 1088.76] bile up there to break it up that's how
[1085.04 - 1090.80] we get in trouble so our bile duck boom
[1088.76 - 1093.64] as the bile is going up there it's weak
[1090.80 - 1096.16] it's not as strong and it doesn't have
[1093.64 - 1097.92] that strength in the stringency and if
[1096.16 - 1100.88] it doesn't have that astringency it's
[1097.92 - 1103.28] not going to actually dissolve what it
[1100.88 - 1107.08] needs to dissolve and then sediment
[1103.28 - 1109.64] turns into mud that mud forms into
[1107.08 - 1112.24] Stones periodically depending on what's
[1109.64 - 1113.56] really in there and then boom you know
[1112.24 - 1115.32] that's where we get in trouble and
[1113.56 - 1117.72] that's what happens very important
[1115.32 - 1119.88] information if you're into gallbladders
[1117.72 - 1121.56] if you're into livers we're talking
[1119.88 - 1122.80] today about how to eat a little better
[1121.56 - 1124.92] especially during the holidays when
[1122.80 - 1126.48] we're dealing with anything in our life
[1124.92 - 1128.04] chronic illness any kind of issues and
[1126.48 - 1129.96] if we don't have chronic illness how do
[1128.04 - 1131.92] we stay healthier during the holidays
[1129.96 - 1133.52] talking about that too and one way is to
[1131.92 - 1136.40] treat your liver right take care of your
[1133.52 - 1138.76] liver make sure your liver is in good
[1136.40 - 1140.32] shape you can do that while while going
[1138.76 - 1142.60] through Christmas while going through
[1140.32 - 1144.88] the holidays while going through New
[1142.60 - 1147.24] Year you can take care of your liver
[1144.88 - 1148.76] there's ways of doing it and that's what
[1147.24 - 1150.52] we're going into now so let's go into
[1148.76 - 1152.48] liver a little bit more which is really
[1150.52 - 1154.00] important so our liver is the sponge
[1152.48 - 1156.20] it's the filter I've been saying this
[1154.00 - 1159.00] for years it's the very thing that's
[1156.20 - 1160.56] holding all the toxins all the poisons
[1159.00 - 1162.88] right all the different things that
[1160.56 - 1165.60] we're up against viruses pathogens
[1162.88 - 1168.84] bacteria all inside the liver the liver
[1165.60 - 1171.16] becomes that sack right there that sack
[1168.84 - 1172.52] that filter do you ever see a fish tank
[1171.16 - 1174.00] you ever see that little carbon filter
[1172.52 - 1176.48] in the fish tank it's sitting in there
[1174.00 - 1178.36] in the fish tank that carbon filter it's
[1176.48 - 1180.20] bubbling out right and the filter is
[1178.36 - 1185.20] supposed to be actually keeping the tank
[1180.20 - 1186.68] water cleaner for the fish and all that
[1185.20 - 1188.32] all the different toxins that are in
[1186.68 - 1190.72] that water it's supposed to go into the
[1188.32 - 1192.84] carbon filter that's what your liver is
[1190.72 - 1196.40] it's like you're the fish tank you're
[1192.84 - 1198.60] the water tank right here and your liver
[1196.40 - 1201.16] is the filter in that fish tank right
[1198.60 - 1202.44] there so that is your filter now what
[1201.16 - 1205.88] you don't want is you don't want your
[1202.44 - 1208.60] filter getting old and nasty and gnarly
[1205.88 - 1212.40] and fill the junk in garbage you don't
[1208.60 - 1214.96] want that River being filled up with all
[1212.40 - 1216.84] of that okay when it's getting nasty and
[1214.96 - 1219.00] early and getting filled up with garbage
[1216.84 - 1220.48] we get in trouble because the garbage
[1219.00 - 1222.76] has to go somewhere else so where does
[1220.48 - 1225.40] it go your lymphatic system so the more
[1222.76 - 1227.48] your liver is stagnant and sluggish the
[1225.40 - 1230.92] more your lymphatic system gets stagnant
[1227.48 - 1232.96] and sluggish lymphatic system is the
[1230.92 - 1234.32] Overflow so let's go into lymphatic
[1232.96 - 1237.04] system a little bit I know a lot of you
[1234.32 - 1238.68] guys love lymphatic system I hear a lot
[1237.04 - 1240.04] of people talking about the lymphatic
[1238.68 - 1242.56] system everybody's going for the
[1240.04 - 1244.16] drainage right you lay on the table and
[1242.56 - 1245.48] they're like okay here you go and
[1244.16 - 1247.44] they're rubbing everything and they're
[1245.48 - 1248.96] working on your your lymph right they're
[1247.44 - 1250.80] doing the whole thing you're like whoa I
[1248.96 - 1252.48] feel better now then they're working on
[1250.80 - 1254.68] your abdomen they're pushing down in
[1252.48 - 1256.36] your abdomen and you're like okay I'm
[1254.68 - 1258.92] less bloated they're squeezing
[1256.36 - 1261.84] everything out but what people have to
[1258.92 - 1264.68] realize is it fills back up fills right
[1261.84 - 1266.24] back up the next day fills right back up
[1264.68 - 1268.88] the next week fills right back up it's
[1266.24 - 1271.72] your overflow if your liver is nasty and
[1268.88 - 1273.80] gnarly it dumps everything boom over
[1271.72 - 1275.84] into your lymphatic system that's how it
[1273.80 - 1278.16] works right I see people out there they
[1275.84 - 1281.56] want to do lymphatic cleanup but they're
[1278.16 - 1284.20] not doing liver cleanup they're doing
[1281.56 - 1286.56] lymphatic cleanup but they're not doing
[1284.20 - 1288.16] liver cleanup and that's where people
[1286.56 - 1290.08] get in trouble it's like they're focused
[1288.16 - 1292.40] seeing on their eyes on the wrong ball
[1290.08 - 1294.80] they're lymphatic lymphatic lymphatic
[1292.40 - 1296.60] lymphatic meanwhile it's the liver it's
[1294.80 - 1298.92] the liver it's the liver that you have
[1296.60 - 1300.96] to work on so your lymphatic system
[1298.92 - 1303.40] doesn't become the garbage dump and the
[1300.96 - 1305.40] garbage pit for when your liver is
[1303.40 - 1307.72] completely stagnant sluggish and
[1305.40 - 1309.36] overloaded very important to know right
[1307.72 - 1310.76] there so if you guys are into lymphatic
[1309.36 - 1313.08] systems and you want to take care of
[1310.76 - 1315.12] your lymphatic system you want it
[1313.08 - 1318.12] healthy you want your lymphatic system
[1315.12 - 1321.32] clean you want the color of the fluid
[1318.12 - 1322.76] and your lymphatic system clear because
[1321.32 - 1324.88] right there people don't know it but
[1322.76 - 1327.32] they got the pus they got the yellow pus
[1324.88 - 1329.80] inside their lymphatic system and that
[1327.32 - 1332.32] yellow pus is because of the Overflow
[1329.80 - 1334.76] from the liver pouring into the
[1332.32 - 1336.88] lymphatic system that's what it is Li
[1334.76 - 1338.56] liver gets overloaded your liver gets
[1336.88 - 1341.28] burdened over burdened and stagnant and
[1338.56 - 1343.96] sluggish all that overflow gets pushed
[1341.28 - 1346.40] Boop into your lymphatic system and here
[1343.96 - 1348.60] we are we're in lymphatic hell we're
[1346.40 - 1351.04] getting the lymphatic drainage we don't
[1348.60 - 1353.12] feel good our lym we're swelling we're
[1351.04 - 1355.08] get the lymphodema we're not doing so
[1353.12 - 1357.12] good we're always a little extra swollen
[1355.08 - 1360.12] than we should and people get worried
[1357.12 - 1362.20] about that and what's happening is our
[1360.12 - 1364.04] livers are overburdened and let's go
[1362.20 - 1367.36] into night time a little bit when we go
[1364.04 - 1369.20] and sleep at night going ready for bed
[1367.36 - 1371.84] and that's it it's time to go to bed we
[1369.20 - 1373.52] click off the light and as the we hours
[1371.84 - 1376.08] of the morning start kicking in your
[1373.52 - 1377.32] liver is working it's working overtime
[1376.08 - 1379.60] and that's what it's doing it's trying
[1377.32 - 1381.68] to take the junk up and clean it up and
[1379.60 - 1383.60] bag it up and get ready so it wants to
[1381.68 - 1385.96] be flushed out in the morning we wake up
[1383.60 - 1387.44] in the morning and we don't flush it out
[1385.96 - 1389.24] that's what happens we wake up in the
[1387.44 - 1391.12] morning and we're not doing our celery
[1389.24 - 1393.08] juice we're not doing our lemon water we
[1391.12 - 1396.00] end up doing something else wake up in
[1393.08 - 1399.48] the morning and we end up putting fat in
[1396.00 - 1402.32] our diet right fat in our breakfast and
[1399.48 - 1404.60] when we do that we overload the liver
[1402.32 - 1407.08] again we don't give our liver a chance
[1404.60 - 1409.16] to recoup flush out the poisons and
[1407.08 - 1410.96] toxins the liver stays stagnant and
[1409.16 - 1414.92] sluggish and
[1410.96 - 1419.92] then the liver can't push all that
[1414.92 - 1422.76] garbage in the right spots the B's weak
[1419.92 - 1424.88] the bile is actually lost its strength
[1422.76 - 1427.52] the bile pushes up into the
[1424.88 - 1429.84] gallbladder it takes some junk up with
[1427.52 - 1432.28] it it doesn't get dispersed it's not
[1429.84 - 1434.24] astringent enough our gallbladder starts
[1432.28 - 1436.16] getting sicker our lymphatic system
[1434.24 - 1439.56] starts getting mucker and yellow and
[1436.16 - 1442.96] mucus and pus and every day we walk
[1439.56 - 1444.60] around swollen we walk around with all
[1442.96 - 1446.36] this junk in our liver and a stagnant
[1444.60 - 1449.04] sluggish liver and then the holidays
[1446.36 - 1452.04] come so that's the next thing too and
[1449.04 - 1453.52] all of a sudden the holidays come along
[1452.04 - 1455.16] and we're just like eating whatever
[1453.52 - 1457.20] we're eating we're over this person's
[1455.16 - 1458.44] house family's house friends's house
[1457.20 - 1460.76] we're at the
[1458.44 - 1462.52] office we're seeing everybody eat what
[1460.76 - 1464.12] they want there's cakes there's cookies
[1462.52 - 1466.68] there's treats there's Donuts there's
[1464.12 - 1468.28] Bagels there's everything under the sun
[1466.68 - 1470.20] there's the cookies with Christ tree
[1468.28 - 1473.64] designs on it there's cookies with like
[1470.20 - 1475.48] Rudolph on there and we're eating it all
[1473.64 - 1477.16] and we're thinking too much sugar too
[1475.48 - 1479.28] much sugar when really there's a lot of
[1477.16 - 1481.28] fat in there and that fat starts to
[1479.28 - 1484.28] burden in the liver starts to drag it
[1481.28 - 1486.96] down and in the holidays we're like no
[1484.28 - 1490.04] no it's New Year's Eve is coming I'm
[1486.96 - 1492.32] gonna make a pledge I'm gonna commit I'm
[1490.04 - 1494.24] gonna start January 1 I'm going to get
[1492.32 - 1497.16] this weight off of me I'm going to do
[1494.24 - 1498.36] everything I can and we're back to that
[1497.16 - 1500.32] again
[1498.36 - 1503.00] so let's talk about like another thing
[1500.32 - 1506.16] that takes a hit at this time of year so
[1503.00 - 1508.72] what am I even talking about your liver
[1506.16 - 1511.88] takes a hit at this time of year big
[1508.72 - 1515.56] time your gallbladder takes a hit big
[1511.88 - 1520.72] time this time of year your pancreas
[1515.56 - 1522.08] takes a hit big time this year any year
[1520.72 - 1525.32] this time of
[1522.08 - 1528.56] year so what happens is that this time
[1525.32 - 1531.68] of year those three things take a huge
[1528.56 - 1533.72] hit right there and guess what our
[1531.68 - 1535.64] stomach takes a hit too unfortunately
[1533.72 - 1538.20] when all that's taking a hit let's go
[1535.64 - 1541.44] into that a little bit so a lot of
[1538.20 - 1545.48] people have gut rot in their intestinal
[1541.44 - 1547.56] tract in their colon gut rot why do they
[1545.48 - 1549.48] have the gut rot because their food's
[1547.56 - 1550.92] not breaking down one of the reasons
[1549.48 - 1555.00] their food's not breaking down is their
[1550.92 - 1557.12] HCL is low their HCL is low their little
[1555.00 - 1559.44] gastric glands these tiny little glands
[1557.12 - 1560.68] inside their stomach get weak and beat
[1559.44 - 1563.00] up over
[1560.68 - 1566.28] time and we end up
[1563.00 - 1568.80] killing those little gastric glands they
[1566.28 - 1571.76] don't work as good we don't produce the
[1568.80 - 1574.68] HCL we need that hydrochloric acid isn't
[1571.76 - 1577.36] breaking down the protein we're dumping
[1574.68 - 1579.96] protein in we're dumping all kinds of
[1577.36 - 1582.40] stuff in and our HCL is not breaking it
[1579.96 - 1584.72] down and that protein goes down into the
[1582.40 - 1588.80] gut and it starts to
[1584.72 - 1591.16] rot and then your liver is like I don't
[1588.80 - 1593.24] have enough bio I can't break down the
[1591.16 - 1595.36] fat I can't break down some of the other
[1593.24 - 1599.40] nutrients I can't break down some of the
[1595.36 - 1602.12] other particles and boom now we have
[1599.40 - 1604.68] that problem too you got rotting fat
[1602.12 - 1607.80] going rancid you got rotting protein
[1604.68 - 1609.72] going bad everything's going sour it's
[1607.80 - 1612.36] fermenting did you ever run into that
[1609.72 - 1614.84] with people at all where you smell it on
[1612.36 - 1619.00] their breath do you get a breath test
[1614.84 - 1621.68] from them get the breath test right
[1619.00 - 1623.60] you smell it on the breath right did you
[1621.68 - 1626.76] ever get that with someone where it's
[1623.60 - 1629.84] like you just smell it it's fermented
[1626.76 - 1631.44] it's sour it smells like sourdough it's
[1629.84 - 1632.64] like hey man did you just have sour
[1631.44 - 1635.48] dough
[1632.64 - 1637.28] bread dude did did you just have sour
[1635.48 - 1640.28] dough bread or
[1637.28 - 1643.04] what is that what you had because guess
[1640.28 - 1646.16] what that stuff stinks it's fermenting
[1643.04 - 1647.92] you got a soup in here stuff is rotting
[1646.16 - 1650.84] you got all kinds of different protein
[1647.92 - 1653.80] and fat down in the bowels and they're
[1650.84 - 1655.64] rotting yeah all that ammonia is being
[1653.80 - 1656.96] produced the ammonia is actually going
[1655.64 - 1659.12] through your body it's coming out of
[1656.96 - 1661.92] your skin it's coming out of your
[1659.12 - 1663.92] armpits it's coming out of everywhere
[1661.92 - 1666.52] it's coming out of your ass it's coming
[1663.92 - 1670.12] out of your mouth it just stinks the
[1666.52 - 1673.08] ammonia and then all that broken down
[1670.12 - 1675.80] ammonia that's just rising and floating
[1673.08 - 1677.52] everywhere is lifting off taking off
[1675.80 - 1679.76] getting stronger and stronger and your
[1677.52 - 1682.12] your proteins are not breaking down and
[1679.76 - 1684.04] more fermentation is happening and more
[1682.12 - 1686.04] rotting is happening it's called gut rot
[1684.04 - 1687.52] so people walk around with gut rot
[1686.04 - 1692.60] that's what they
[1687.52 - 1695.92] do heavy fatty meals hit the pancreas
[1692.60 - 1698.72] hard and the pancreas has to pump out
[1695.92 - 1700.96] insulin that hormone has to be pumping
[1698.72 - 1702.16] out and when it's pumping out that's
[1700.96 - 1703.32] another thing let's go into that a
[1702.16 - 1705.40] little bit so we talked about the
[1703.32 - 1708.04] stomach people's stomach gastric glands
[1705.40 - 1709.92] don't produce HCL
[1708.04 - 1712.12] they can't break down the proteins their
[1709.92 - 1714.68] liver can't break down the fats as good
[1712.12 - 1716.88] so the liver right the bile weakens
[1714.68 - 1721.20] we're in that your gallbladder gets
[1716.88 - 1722.72] sluggish fill the junk sediment sand all
[1721.20 - 1725.60] kinds of different rocks start to
[1722.72 - 1728.56] actually get produced in there and then
[1725.60 - 1731.88] your pancreas has to produce lots of
[1728.56 - 1734.24] insulin because we're eating so many
[1731.88 - 1737.20] Abominations we're eating so much stuff
[1734.24 - 1739.72] that's fun we're having too much sugar
[1737.20 - 1741.24] and fat combined we're having it
[1739.72 - 1743.48] combined and when we do that we're
[1741.24 - 1745.00] getting insulin resistance so
[1743.48 - 1747.68] everybody's walking around at this time
[1745.00 - 1750.12] of year like on the edge your A1C is
[1747.68 - 1751.76] about to go up they're they're about to
[1750.12 - 1754.24] get a piece of plaque broken in an
[1751.76 - 1756.12] artery going up to their brain or lung
[1754.24 - 1757.76] they're about to get something else
[1756.12 - 1759.52] happened have a heart attack people
[1757.76 - 1761.52] stroke out this time of year A lot of
[1759.52 - 1763.68] times because they're dehydrated their
[1761.52 - 1766.32] body's filled sluggish filled with all
[1763.68 - 1768.76] that dirty blood syndrome their pancreas
[1766.32 - 1771.12] too much insulin so much insulin
[1768.76 - 1773.44] resistance it's out of control and then
[1771.12 - 1775.00] their liver is so sluggish and stagnant
[1773.44 - 1777.04] the food's not breaking down and
[1775.00 - 1778.68] digesting good doesn't it sound like a
[1777.04 - 1781.40] nightmare yeah it doesn't seem like a
[1778.68 - 1783.12] nightmare but it is for so many people
[1781.40 - 1785.12] the thing is with sugar just so we don't
[1783.12 - 1787.32] confuse things you need sugar to survive
[1785.12 - 1791.00] but when we eat a lot of sugar and then
[1787.32 - 1792.92] fat combined together the pancreas has
[1791.00 - 1795.28] to work even harder and produce more
[1792.92 - 1796.92] insulin and then boom we're blocking the
[1795.28 - 1798.76] sugar from getting into the cells
[1796.92 - 1800.32] because of all that fat that's there and
[1798.76 - 1802.00] then we get nutrient deficient from that
[1800.32 - 1804.00] all on itself it's a whole another story
[1802.00 - 1805.44] in insulin resistance and diabetes and
[1804.00 - 1808.32] everything but we don't need to go there
[1805.44 - 1810.16] right now let's start making some food
[1808.32 - 1812.56] I'm excited you guys thanks for actually

[2970.00 - 2978.40] there all right that is the same system
[2975.84 - 2978.40] as the other
[2980.64 - 2986.84] one all right I'm going to make some
[2983.04 - 2986.84] hummus let's go let's get going on
[2991.36 - 2997.32] this let's make some garbanzo bean
[2994.52 - 2999.32] hummus
[2997.32 - 3002.04] is what we're going to
[2999.32 - 3004.04] do all right and let's get a bowl out
[3002.04 - 3006.44] for
[3004.04 - 3008.00] that could be a little bit of avocado
[3006.44 - 3009.96] left over in this hummus but I don't
[3008.00 - 3011.92] care you can rinse it out you can clean
[3009.96 - 3014.12] it out really quick I got the sink right
[3011.92 - 3015.32] here I can take this rinse it right out
[3014.12 - 3017.24] but I'm going to leave it in because
[3015.32 - 3019.00] there's no really worry about it there's
[3017.24 - 3021.72] no need if a little bit of guacamole
[3019.00 - 3023.08] ends up in my hummus that's fine but if
[3021.72 - 3026.00] you're somebody that wants to just give
[3023.08 - 3028.12] it a quick rinse easy to do you can put
[3026.00 - 3029.52] it back on you can make other stuff so
[3028.12 - 3031.92] what I have right here is a bowl of
[3029.52 - 3034.92] chickpeas garbanza
[3031.92 - 3040.68] beans you guys can
[3034.92 - 3040.68] see and I'm going to make hummus get
[3040.72 - 3045.76] this I'm GNA make it without using
[3043.00 - 3047.96] Sesame tahini I'm not going to use a
[3045.76 - 3049.76] whole bunch of tahini in here I'm not
[3047.96 - 3052.60] not going to dump a whole bunch of olive
[3049.76 - 3055.20] oil in here either this is easier food
[3052.60 - 3055.96] on the liver that's what this is keep in
[3055.20 - 3057.48] mind
[3055.96 - 3060.28] it's easier food on the liver so what
[3057.48 - 3065.24] you see is sesame seeds take a look you
[3060.28 - 3068.84] can get the flavor of Sesame in your
[3065.24 - 3070.40] hummus without burdening the liver with
[3068.84 - 3073.52] too much
[3070.40 - 3076.40] oil too much tahini you don't need to do
[3073.52 - 3079.56] that you can make a hummus and just use
[3076.40 - 3081.40] some sesame seeds in here get it ground
[3079.56 - 3083.92] up all the same in there that's that's
[3081.40 - 3086.44] the difference so let's
[3083.92 - 3088.16] go let's drop some of these garbanzo
[3086.44 - 3091.08] beans in here right
[3088.16 - 3095.08] here you can make hummus without olive
[3091.08 - 3098.48] oil without tahini check this out right
[3095.08 - 3101.96] I got some I got some garbanzos coming
[3098.48 - 3102.72] through you guys look this is easier on
[3101.96 - 3106.56] the
[3102.72 - 3110.36] liver you realize like how very little
[3106.56 - 3112.96] this is a handful of sesame seeds much
[3110.36 - 3115.40] different than a tablespoon of tahini in
[3112.96 - 3118.04] somebody's Hest right look at this see
[3115.40 - 3121.12] have the seeds going there so very
[3118.04 - 3125.76] little but yet the flavor is knock your
[3121.12 - 3128.64] socks off flavor is insane like it's so
[3125.76 - 3131.40] good look dropping that in here this is
[3128.64 - 3134.24] a basic hummus you don't have to go too
[3131.40 - 3136.56] crazy Mary says best thing is that
[3134.24 - 3138.28] juicer takes less than five minutes to
[3136.56 - 3139.76] clean it's so quick I could have
[3138.28 - 3141.56] actually cleaned this whole part right
[3139.76 - 3144.28] here had you guys wait probably would
[3141.56 - 3146.44] have done it in a minute and a half
[3144.28 - 3148.28] right
[3146.44 - 3152.28] all right so what you're seeing right
[3148.28 - 3155.60] here is hummus being made do you like
[3152.28 - 3158.24] it's spicy do you like your hummus hot
[3155.60 - 3161.60] how do you like it well I'm going to
[3158.24 - 3163.40] stick another hot pepper in mine okay
[3161.60 - 3166.32] I'm going to put half of a hot pepper in
[3163.40 - 3168.20] mine right there there we go and I'm
[3166.32 - 3171.36] going to keep keep it coming I'm going
[3168.20 - 3174.88] to get lemon in
[3171.36 - 3178.12] here I got a lemon squeezing the lemon
[3174.88 - 3179.08] right in here there we go knocked out
[3178.12 - 3182.56] that
[3179.08 - 3185.48] seed nice lemon
[3182.56 - 3189.52] juice just like that
[3185.48 - 3191.96] ready some more sesame seeds dropping in
[3189.52 - 3194.64] here you guys got to realize the reason
[3191.96 - 3197.40] why this is liver friendly that amount
[3194.64 - 3200.64] of sesame seed is nothing compared to a
[3197.40 - 3203.56] tablespoon of Sesame butter it's nothing
[3200.64 - 3206.84] compared to that like seriously you can
[3203.56 - 3210.20] drop some garlic powder in here why not
[3206.84 - 3212.76] you can just go straight in
[3210.20 - 3215.28] here got the garlic
[3212.76 - 3218.64] powder we got the lemon in
[3215.28 - 3218.64] there there we
[3219.60 - 3226.12] go all
[3222.16 - 3227.96] right this is just this is
[3226.12 - 3230.00] incredible we're going to put a little
[3227.96 - 3232.28] touch of salt people that come over
[3230.00 - 3233.88] they're like where's the salt you know
[3232.28 - 3237.16] where's the salt there we go little
[3233.88 - 3237.16] touch of salt in there
[3238.40 - 3243.08] and what you're watching it's a
[3241.04 - 3246.92] phenomenon what you're
[3243.08 - 3249.80] watching is some serious hummus being
[3246.92 - 3252.36] made this is garbanzo bean

[3271.96 - 3275.48] right I'm going to mix that up these are

[3305.80 - 3311.44] oil there's not a tablespoon of olive
[3308.40 - 3314.72] oil there isn't a tablespoon of tahini
[3311.44 - 3316.92] in here it's easy on the liver easy on
[3314.72 - 3316.92] the
[3317.04 - 3321.36] bile bile production in the liver
[3319.44 - 3323.08] people's livers can't break down enough
[3321.36 - 3325.44] fat then it sits in their colon their
[3323.08 - 3328.16] small intestinal tract it goes r it and
[3325.44 - 3330.88] it feeds everything that shouldn't
[3328.16 - 3333.48] feed so I'm just mixing this

[4068.64 - 4073.12] even if you used a lot of sesame seeds
[4071.60 - 4075.40] it's not going to equate to even a

[4297.28 - 4303.80] the P hummus next so I'm going to do it
[4299.60 - 4303.80] with the other machine
[4306.40 - 4312.56] here and I am even going
[4310.44 - 4315.56] to okay you
[4312.56 - 4315.56] guys
[4316.00 - 4320.52] so what's really cool
[4318.08 - 4323.28] here is I
[4320.52 - 4326.36] got the pan
[4323.28 - 4328.04] on and I'm going to show you guys some
[4326.36 - 4330.68] PE hummus in a second but we're going to
[4328.04 - 4332.16] talk about the liver for a moment now if
[4330.68 - 4334.16] you got just got on here just so you
[4332.16 - 4335.52] know like what am I doing like what is
[4334.16 - 4337.76] going on we're talking about easy
[4335.52 - 4339.84] recipes on the liver we're talking about
[4337.76 - 4342.48] stagnant sluggish liver how people walk
[4339.84 - 4344.76] around with that they have a fatty liver
[4342.48 - 4346.28] bioproduction is minimal and so many
[4344.76 - 4347.52] people they can't break down their fats
[4346.28 - 4351.48] their fats go
[4347.52 - 4353.96] rancid food rots in their gut intestinal
[4351.48 - 4355.44] track and ferments and feeds everything
[4353.96 - 4358.88] in there that shouldn't be in there
[4355.44 - 4361.04] pathogens bacteria viruses and so
[4358.88 - 4362.36] forth and we're talking about how
[4361.04 - 4364.08] there's so much sludge in people's
[4362.36 - 4366.92] gallbladders that sits there because the
[4364.08 - 4369.96] bile reserves are so low the bile can't
[4366.92 - 4371.56] get to this the gallbladder it's not
[4369.96 - 4373.08] astringent enough it gets into the
[4371.56 - 4374.72] gallbladder but it's fill the sludge
[4373.08 - 4376.16] it's weak weak it's not potent and then
[4374.72 - 4378.32] all that junk builds up in your
[4376.16 - 4380.76] gallbladder like I was talking about
[4378.32 - 4383.44] earlier and then people's stomach glands
[4380.76 - 4386.00] are weak they can't actually break down
[4383.44 - 4388.08] their proteins properly their HCL is low
[4386.00 - 4390.56] then all you got all this putrifying
[4388.08 - 4391.92] protein with gut rot right we talked
[4390.56 - 4393.80] about that I'm giving everybody a little
[4391.92 - 4396.60] quick
[4393.80 - 4398.92] rundown but even with all of that I'm
[4396.60 - 4401.40] talking about how we can do things for
[4398.92 - 4403.88] ourselves that are easy on the system I
[4401.40 - 4406.88] just made some killer recipes
[4403.88 - 4409.08] that are easier on the system than
[4406.88 - 4410.88] anybody's like stuff that they're eating
[4409.08 - 4413.60] these days with all the different fats
[4410.88 - 4416.20] in there all the different combinations
[4413.60 - 4418.08] people are eating way way too much fat
[4416.20 - 4420.68] in their diet at this time of year they
[4418.08 - 4423.40] mix fat and sugar together they get
[4420.68 - 4426.08] insulin resistance their blood sugar is
[4423.40 - 4427.72] totally out of whack right their livers
[4426.08 - 4429.84] are burning down more than ever they
[4427.72 - 4432.04] start gaining a little bit of weight I
[4429.84 - 4435.20] made some incredible guacamole just like
[4432.04 - 4437.44] that that quick we made hummuses we made
[4435.20 - 4440.40] guacamole we're not even
[4437.44 - 4442.92] done and we got some other stuff I got
[4440.40 - 4445.36] this pan on so here's what I'm going to
[4442.92 - 4451.44] do this next thing I'm
[4445.36 - 4453.80] making you guys is a pea
[4451.44 - 4456.12] hummus so let's go into that a little
[4453.80 - 4459.76] bit I got some peas right
[4456.12 - 4462.40] here think look frozen
[4459.76 - 4465.60] peas pan getting hot yep it's getting
[4462.40 - 4467.28] hot frozen peas are and then you put you
[4465.60 - 4469.92] don't put water in your pan you don't
[4467.28 - 4471.84] add water you just keep it just frozen
[4469.92 - 4474.32] peas if you have fresh peas that's a
[4471.84 - 4475.56] miracle if you actually have fresh peas
[4474.32 - 4478.36] that's actually
[4475.56 - 4481.44] incredible but I'm using frozen
[4478.36 - 4483.32] peas get them right out of your freezer
[4481.44 - 4485.04] dropping them right down in here just
[4483.32 - 4489.16] like
[4485.04 - 4489.16] this right in the pan can you see
[4489.64 - 4496.40] that all
[4492.28 - 4498.40] right okay now that pan is getting hot
[4496.40 - 4501.68] so the goal is you make them
[4498.40 - 4504.32] toasty you actually don't add water you
[4501.68 - 4507.92] don't add oil so you don't want to add
[4504.32 - 4510.88] any kind of oil to that pea hummus you
[4507.92 - 4513.28] can add sesame seeds to your P hummus
[4510.88 - 4516.16] later which we're going to do but you
[4513.28 - 4517.88] don't have to add oil so this is so cool
[4516.16 - 4520.84] so on the pan right
[4517.88 - 4523.64] there they're going to get hot now I put
[4520.84 - 4527.00] the I put the heat up high but you got
[4523.64 - 4529.12] to watch them so once they start popping
[4527.00 - 4530.28] they kind of like popcorn you need to
[4529.12 - 4532.80] keep an eye on them you don't want to
[4530.28 - 4535.04] burn your pan you don't want to burn
[4532.80 - 4537.12] them or overcook them but you want to
[4535.04 - 4539.84] get them toasty enough that's what makes
[4537.12 - 4542.28] this hummus so incredible if you can't
[4539.84 - 4544.24] do beans or lentils this is another
[4542.28 - 4545.88] option how many people they just won't
[4544.24 - 4548.16] do beans completely understand there's a
[4545.88 - 4549.64] lot of people that don't do them not
[4548.16 - 4551.28] judging you at all I think that's great
[4549.64 - 4553.20] if you don't do them it's great for what
[4551.28 - 4555.52] you're doing and then but the peun
[4553.20 - 4556.88] hummus is that other option for so many
[4555.52 - 4558.60] people that don't have hummus but one
[4556.88 - 4561.48] and Colleen says I avoided peas for
[4558.60 - 4564.52] years thinking they were carbs so they
[4561.48 - 4567.64] were bad for me same with potatoes I'm
[4564.52 - 4569.72] so thrilled to have them both back in my
[4567.64 - 4571.80] life thank you for doing that for
[4569.72 - 4573.04] yourself Colleen that is really special
[4571.80 - 4575.96] and really

[4632.56 - 4635.56] look
[4635.60 - 4642.64] okay do you see any oil come
[4639.16 - 4646.24] out you didn't see oil come out right
[4642.64 - 4649.52] it's not pouring out this has been
[4646.24 - 4652.84] sitting for quite a while I don't know
[4649.52 - 4655.32] two three months maybe it's four months
[4652.84 - 4657.36] now I mean don't quote me on the exact
[4655.32 - 4661.08] time but it's been a while at least it
[4657.36 - 4662.56] feels like a long time right take a look
[4661.08 - 4664.40] this is what I'm talking about about
[4662.56 - 4667.20] being easier on the liver do you guys
[4664.40 - 4668.84] catch my drift right now it's another
[4667.20 - 4675.00] one right there it's N A different kind
[4668.84 - 4676.72] of nut butter one was hazelnut butter
[4675.00 - 4680.28] the other one was
[4676.72 - 4682.48] cashew okay now it's actually there's no
[4680.28 - 4684.92] oil in
[4682.48 - 4686.48] here right there's just pieces of nut
[4684.92 - 4690.00] butter right
[4686.48 - 4694.88] there okay about two months ago or so
[4690.00 - 4696.96] Fabian spot on bro spot on two months
[4694.88 - 4702.48] right so I just want to show you
[4696.96 - 4705.96] guys okay now why do we even care about
[4702.48 - 4710.34] these jars of nut butter that I made two
[4705.96 - 4713.72] months ago why so I want to show you
[4710.34 - 4713.72] [Music]
[4714.40 - 4719.52] something show you something little
[4717.20 - 4719.52] magic
[4720.24 - 4725.28] [Music]
[4721.48 - 4730.96] trick I got a popular Nut Butter
[4725.28 - 4730.96] brand that just says it only has
[4731.92 - 4734.92] nuts
[4743.64 - 4748.72] take a
[4745.24 - 4748.72] look did you see
[4750.56 - 4755.28] that
[4752.68 - 4759.48] okay that is not a
[4755.28 - 4764.88] trick that is not a
[4759.48 - 4768.36] prank you're looking at a of oil they
[4764.88 - 4771.92] came off the top of that jar of nut
[4768.36 - 4776.52] butter that is not a
[4771.92 - 4779.20] hoax no it's not see
[4776.52 - 4783.12] because most of all the nut Butters out
[4779.20 - 4787.36] there oil is added and mixed into it it
[4783.12 - 4789.36] reduces the cost to use cheaper bulk oil
[4787.36 - 4791.28] even if it's the same oil as the peanut
[4789.36 - 4795.08] meaning the same type right peanut then
[4791.28 - 4798.36] peanut oil almond an almond oil Sesame
[4795.08 - 4801.20] Sesame oil right but they add more a lot
[4798.36 - 4804.60] of times it's not even the same oil but
[4801.20 - 4806.52] they add more and then the oil comes
[4804.60 - 4808.32] from a different part of the world it's
[4806.52 - 4810.64] comes in bulk it arrives at the nut
[4808.32 - 4812.32] putter companies and then they have all
[4810.64 - 4816.48] that oil that's bulk and then they have
[4812.32 - 4820.32] all the nuts and they do a mix they do a
[4816.48 - 4820.32] mix there's a reason for
[4821.76 - 4827.84] that and so I wanted to show you why is
[4825.00 - 4831.32] it important because it's hard on the
[4827.84 - 4832.60] liver so we're making recipes that are
[4831.32 - 4834.64] easy on the
[4832.60 - 4837.28] liver is what we're
[4834.64 - 4839.16] doing so we're making a nut butter but
[4837.28 - 4841.44] first of all I have peas cooking right
[4839.16 - 4843.40] here I'm going to move this oil over
[4841.44 - 4844.64] here for a little bit bring these over
[4843.40 - 4847.24] here
[4844.64 - 4849.04] too all right I just wanted to show you
[4847.24 - 4852.24] that that's really important and that's
[4849.04 - 4854.36] just one right here I mean I got a whole
[4852.24 - 4856.60] bunch of jars in the back of different
[4854.36 - 4858.92] brands that I purchased a couple of
[4856.60 - 4861.24] months ago like two three months ago and
[4858.92 - 4862.88] they sat and then they all have that
[4861.24 - 4868.44] much oil at the
[4862.88 - 4868.44] top but mine can sit and not have
[4869.04 - 4873.52] that the ones that I'm talking about in
[4871.12 - 4875.76] mine are made out of the mm 1500 so
[4873.52 - 4879.96] we're going to do that all right these
[4875.76 - 4879.96] are cooking going to make a p
[4881.20 - 4884.64] humus here we go

[5552.92 - 5561.72] lightly toast them I don't want to burn
[5557.60 - 5564.00] them I don't want to toast them too
[5561.72 - 5565.72] much you want to toast them lightly if
[5564.00 - 5568.20] you're into toasted nut Butters if you
[5565.72 - 5570.64] don't want roasted toasted nut Butters
[5568.20 - 5572.68] then just do them raw do the walnuts
[5570.64 - 5576.52] Raw
[5572.68 - 5579.64] I'm a sucker for Walnut butter during
[5576.52 - 5582.72] the holidays I'm going to be
[5579.64 - 5584.80] honest there's nothing more tastier it
