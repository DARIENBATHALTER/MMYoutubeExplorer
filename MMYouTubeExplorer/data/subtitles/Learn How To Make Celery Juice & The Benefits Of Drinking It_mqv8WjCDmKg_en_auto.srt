00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,440
here

100
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,239
you know nothing in our history of

101
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,519
trends

102
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:24,720
or history of popular health

103
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,840
things that we've done it just years and

104
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,040
decades

105
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:32,239
nothing has moved the needle like

106
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,239
celery juice has and you got to think

107
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,360
about that for a little bit like what is

108
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,239
up with that

109
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,799
it's not just water because it's not

110
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,000
water

111
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,080
you know what you know what i hear all

112
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
the time this is really funny

113
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,480
i hear this all the time okay it's like

114
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,599
when i just did that tick tock video

115
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,640
and of of juicing celery and all that i

116
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,360
hear this all the time

117
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,480
it's just water you can get better just

118
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,040
on water

119
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,280
the the celery juices that's all it is

120
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,319
that's funny because if you fill a fish

121
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,000
tank with celery juice all the fish are

122
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,080
gonna die

123
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,519
you know why do you know why all the

124
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,360
fish are gonna die in a fish tank when

125
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,879
you just make it all celery juice and

126
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,319
you have all your fish swimming in there

127
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,879
and they're swimming in just celery

128
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,519
juice

129
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,639
do you know why because it's not water

130
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,759
that's why

131
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:24,000
celery juice is not water

132
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:28,240
that's why okay and it's something more

133
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,639
special something more powerful for that

134
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,120
than that nancy says i feel much better

135
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,360
when i drink celery juice incredible

136
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,479
sharon says celery juice for sure moved

137
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,400
my needle

138
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:43,600

140
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:49,759
thousands of testimonials

141
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:52,560
and you got to think about that like

142
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,600
you know i mean nothing has done that

143
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,199

212
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,080
crock

celery juice is just where's the where's

214
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,039
the data

215
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:17,360
it's you know that that's it's placebo

216
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:19,440
first of all i got to tell you something

217
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,160
if placebo worked

218
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,840
then no one would be sick not one of you

219
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,120
no one no one you know would ever be

220
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,919
sick in a million years all they would

221
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,520
have to do

222
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,120
is go see their doctor and their doctor

223
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,280
give them a sugar pill

224
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,680
and say this will fix you here's a sugar

225
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,880
pill and all the problems will go away

226
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:39,280
their ms their ra their autoimmune their

227
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,919
hashimoto's direct some other psoriasis

228
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,000
their vital

229
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,560
vitiligo would all go away all you have

230
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,919
to do is just give somebody a sugar pill

231
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,879
and tell them it's gonna fix their

232
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:51,840
vitiligo and it should all disappear

233
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,520
so when you hear that that really silly

234
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,440
placebo talk

235
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,960
you gotta kind of like you gotta think

236
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,160
about that one for a little bit

237
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:03,280
okay placebo doesn't work it never did

238
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:06,240
what works are things that work

239
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,919
so the only thing that works are things

240
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,199
that can actually work

241
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,720

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,320
because placebo doesn't fix anybody it

291
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,040
it when you have

292
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,200

could have a couple of groups of people

297
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,320
you can have one group of

298
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,120
one person that doesn't do anything for

299
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,320

juice

302
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,120
and it helps move the needle and you can

303
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,079
have somebody who does everything for

304
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,720

all kinds of stuff for their health and

308
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,760
not moving the needle and they bring in

309
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,120

keep on

386
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,440
fixing all the time and i'm dumping

387
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,040
money

388
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,720
in all the time now i got to get a new

389
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,000
set of tires

390
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,959
now i got to get now i got to get a new

391
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,920
set of brakes

392
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:35,440
right off the running and all of a

393
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:37,760
sudden you're spending all this money

394
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,639
with this juicer it's like you're buying

395
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,279
celery

396
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,160
okay and celery gets pricey at certain

397
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,680
times of the year

398
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,440
it can get a little pricey right it

399
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,120
could cost a little bit more

400
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,480
and people say well it's expensive to

401
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,199
juice that much celery

402
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,000
it's actually not um because of what it

403
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,600
does for you

404
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,279
it's incredible on that level but here's

405
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,160
the thing if you're one of those

406
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,120
if you're concerned about it costing

407
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,360
like more

408
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,440
like you're saying well that's a head of

409
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,959
celery is 99 cents or a head of celery

410
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,880
is 1.99 or

411
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,880
whatever it is in whatever grocery store

412
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,800
or wherever you are in the world

413
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,880
the point is is that when you're

414
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,399
squeezing the juice out of it you're

415
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,360
saving money

416
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,639
and that's the key like for me i've used

417
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,680
celery for

418
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:24,079
30 plus years right and

419
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,360
what i noticed when i use this juicer so

420
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,399
far because i'm doing a little

421
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,360
experiment

422
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,880
with that like how much money can i save

423
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,480
and

424
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,480
when i'm juicing celery with this

425
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,760
machine every day because i juice a lot

426
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,639
so i do 32 ounces minimum every single

427
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,480
day

428
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,839
i got a pile of celery right here you

429
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:46,639
guys see that right there

430
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:49,519
um but i do 32 ounces minimum each day

431
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,000
that's what i do right so i want to know

432
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,040
am i

433
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,440
saving money and it turns out i am

434
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,560
that's what's incredible i'm squeezing

435
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,560
more juice

436
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,920
out of the celery that goes through this

437
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,160
machine

438
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,680
that i've done in any machine i got a

439
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,320
garage

440
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,279
filled with machines like every company

441
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,800
out there

442
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:13,120
and this is the one i use

443
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,399
so this is the one i back this is the

444
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,839
one i back

445
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:20,079
but the point is is when you're

446
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,519
buying half the celery that you would

447
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,680
normally buy

448
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,560
or a fraction of what you would normally

449
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,279
buy

450
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,320
for your juice that alone pays for the

451
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,160
juicer

452
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,160
so by the end of the year you're like

453
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,040
well i just saved all that money

454
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,759
that could buy a whole bunch of juicers

455
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,279
you know

456
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,519
and it's kind of like that it's really

457
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,519
cool

458
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:44,480
can use this juicer for other veggies

459
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,720
that question i answered earlier

460
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,920
yeah you can and that's what's that's

461
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,199
what's amazing

462
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,959
um so let's talk about something really

463
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,720
cool here if you see it

464
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:58,079
this is what i wanted to show you guys

465
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:02,480
about this juicer i really love

466
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:02,480
okay i almost have a full container here

467
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:11,360
and the amount of pulp is a lot less

468
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:14,880
it's like dry too it's like

469
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,240
it's it's it's compressed and it's dry

470
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:22,320
so that's what's really cool and i'll

471
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:24,560
show you how that works

472
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,639
and look if you guys got a juicer at

473
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,000
home i know people that got a blender

474
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,480
they blend it and they strain it through

475
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,120
a cheesecloth i'm all for that

476
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,320
totally do that you don't have to get to

477
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:39,199
get the shoe stretch not

478
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,199
it use the juicer that you have totally

479
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,000
you can totally do that so i'm going to

480
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,279
give you a couple of tips that are

481
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,720
really good i'm going to shut this off

482
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:49,680
for a second

483
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,680
and i'm going to grab

484
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:57,199
a myself right here so when i look at

485
00:16:53,440 --> 00:17:00,320
how much pulp is in here okay

486
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:03,680
this is this is unbelievable that's

487
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:08,079
it a little string okay

488
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:10,720
and i wanted to show you this it's dry

489
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,120
i mean it's dry you can't find celery

490
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,160
juice

491
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:16,160
the bottom of this you can't look

492
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,760
look how dry it's so dry it's like a

493
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,959
little piece of rope

494
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:23,360
and it's not like all this pulp

495
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,880
and all this all this you know pulp and

496
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,760
fiber and leftover

497
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,960
it's a little stringy rope that's dry to

498
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,160
the bone

499
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:35,520
and where did all the juice go

500
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:39,200
right i hardly used any celery

501
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:41,760
and the money saved in my opinion

502
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,960
it's insane so that's what i really love

503
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,720
about this model

504
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,000
but it's this model though you know it's

505
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,679
not like another model

506
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,880
though you know it's this model and

507
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:54,080
omega says the mm-900 hds

508
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:58,320
and but i want to show you guys because

509
00:17:54,080 --> 00:18:00,960
i feel kind of like guilty knowing

510
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,679
knowing that i'm getting so much celery

511
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,679
juice

512
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,120
and a lot of you guys are and i feel bad

513
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,200
so i have to at least let you know in

514
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:10,000
case you ever do down the road

515
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,880
maybe next year two years from now six

516
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,760
months from now

517
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,480
you actually you know get the juicer or

518
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,400
something

519
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,160
but you can use the juicer you have you

520
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,880
can use it forever it's fine the juicer

521
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,080
you have

522
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,679
but i feel like if i don't tell you that

523
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,000
you can have this experience where i

524
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:28,480
just have this this is so dry

525
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,360
it's it's unbelievable and this

526
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,240
experience of

527
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:34,880
only having this much in your container

528
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:38,400
that's dry to the bone

529
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:40,000
and then have all this juice it's like

530
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,360
it's just something to think about you

531
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,200
know what i mean it's like that kind of

532
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,039
thing don't add water so let's talk

533
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,320
about this a little bit

534
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:51,200
if you juice your celery juice celery

535
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,360
look i have this big container and that

536
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,679
is all i have for pulp left over and

537
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,760
it's

538
00:18:53,679 --> 00:19:00,080
dry to the bone it's in my fingertips

539
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,360
it's like what the heck when you think

540
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,039
about that

541
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,640
you know and at the same time you can

542
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,240
juice any vegetable and anything you

543
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,720
want in this juicer that's just really

544
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,360
cool

545
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,000
so don't add water to your celery juice

546
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,160
if you blend

547
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,840
it in a blender if you if this is how

548
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,600
you do it right if you juice your celery

549
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,640
juice in a blender

550
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:21,440
um don't add water okay

551
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,360
just blend it and let it mush up there

552
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,960
and blend and let it get shredded up in

553
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,120
there and then until you're ready

554
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,480
and then dump that into a cheesecloth

555
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,039
and squeeze it out

556
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,720
and do it that way but don't add water

557
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:35,200
if you add water

558
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,320
it doesn't work celery juice won't work

559
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,039
you can't use it

560
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,799
therapeutically it'll still give you

561
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,400
some nutrition for sure

562
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,480
like you'll see your celery juice if you

563
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,000
add water to it or ice cubes or

564
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,320
lemon to it will still give you

565
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,480
nutrition but it won't

566
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:54,400
do the magic that's changing the lives

567
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,600
of millions around the world right now i

568
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,799
mean i would

569
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:00,240
i would estimate over 300 million people

570
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:03,360
in the world right now and more

571
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:05,360
are drinking it therapeutically but and

572
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,760
i know a lot they kind of miss the boat

573
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:10,080
on it they'll throw lemon in there

574
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,360
they'll put water in there they'll put

575
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,120
ice cubes in there

576
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,960
they'll juice other things in there but

577
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,640
they'll still call it their celery juice

578
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,559
but it's not gonna work like

579
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,400
really therapeutically like move the

580
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:24,080
needle like it needs to move

581
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,280
debra cole um is it on sale for black

582
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,559
friday yes

583
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:30,799
totally on or i think i originally used

584
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:32,480
a different juicer for about four months

585
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:35,840
but then bought this one

586
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,640
when my old one broke in the end i saved

587
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,520
money because

588
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:41,679
one bag or 2.5 pounds of celery makes

589
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,880
around 32 ounces but would have to use

590
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,120
1.5 bags

591
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,960
which might with my old juicer to make

592
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:50,480
32

593
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,880
32 ounces so so you're saying you're

594
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,120
doing less you're using less

595
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,080
so that's amazing okay and that's

596
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,840
incredible i mean

597
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:04,799
i can tell you with the mm-900 it's less

598
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:08,240
so i'm just making sure i got that right

599
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:11,200
so you save money incredible

600
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,200
with the new juicer

601
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,880
amazing amazing that's the way and you

602
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,799
know what

603
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,640
it's happening for me it's just

604
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,720
happening for me too

605
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,919
but i like i said i feel like if i don't

606
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,120
tell you guys

607
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:26,880
especially when there's a sale it's like

608
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,720
you know i want you to be able to take

609
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,280
advantage of this down the road and

610
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:34,159
and be able to or anytime be able to get

611
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:37,679
that experience like this is dry

612
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:39,520
so dry it's ridiculous like and that's

613
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,720
that's what's incredible so i have all

614
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:44,799

615
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:47,440
right here so i'm gonna

616
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,440
pour it in

617
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:59,840
i still got leftover this is a

618
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:07,039
i'm gonna put this over here still got

619
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,799
left over in the container but

620
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:11,120
i didn't have my celery juice yet today

621
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:13,200
so i'm really excited about this

622
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,320
but this is a cold pressed juicer too a

623
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,080
lot of people be like

624
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,919
okay there's a question nina what about

625
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,720
celery powder um no

626
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:22,080
terrible terrible that's that celery

627
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,600
powder is a scam

628
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:28,159
for sure and it just can't do anything

629
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:30,080
and i talk about it in the celery juice

630
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,919
book

631
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,600
so the medical medium celery juice book

632
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,960
i talk about it in here

633
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,720
so just letting you know that's a

634
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,760
medical medium celery juice book and the

635
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,640
subtitle

636
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:42,559
is incredible because it says the most

637
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:46,400
powerful medicine of our time healing

638
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:50,320
millions worldwide and guess what

639
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:52,640
fact fact already happened

640
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,159
all these years so it's a great thing to

641
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,480
see when people are getting their lives

642
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,000
back

643
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:01,919
it's a beautiful thing um

644
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,960
and celery powder it doesn't do anything

645
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:06,480
so you're putting just

646
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:08,960
dead powder you know right in

647
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,679
some water which you're not supposed to

648
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,320
do

649
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,440
so you're not supposed to add water to

650
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:17,039
celery

651
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:20,240
juice well if you're going to rehydrate

652
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,960
celery juice from a powder and you add

653
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,400
water

654
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,640
it's not going to be the same thing and

655
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:27,919
i'll tell you why this is in its

656
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:30,240
living fresh form and

657
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:32,000
the water is connected to the sodium

658
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,960
cluster salts

659
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,120
right now in it alive and it's in here

660
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:40,080
doing its thing it's all connected

661
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:42,159
it's all attached to itself the sodium

662
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:45,440
cluster salts are suspended

663
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:46,480
in the living water but you can't kill

664
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,080
it

665
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,600
you can't just kill it like that and

666
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,159
turn it into powder

667
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,720
and then expect to add water to it and

668
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,520
think

669
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,000
the same thing is going to happen that's

670
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,799
like

671
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,240
throwing something in the blender that's

672
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,200
like throwing something in a food

673
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,840
processor

674
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:06,320
and expecting to put it back together

675
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:09,440
after it's been chopped up and diced up

676
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:12,240
it's just it doesn't work um

677
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,240
so i'm glad you guys are here yeah

678
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:17,039
strain it so robert

679
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,799
definitely strain it that's what i do

680
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,840
you you want to strain it you want to

681
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,840
take a strainer

682
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,520
even though you're juicing it here it's

683
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,200
already being juiced you still want to

684
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,840
strain it so when i was pouring it in

685
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,440
here

686
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:30,000
i was straining it that's what i was

687
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,159
doing right here

688
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,880
of course i just spilled a little but

689
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,880
yeah there you go

690
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,919
um

691
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:48,640
molina vimergi's celery force

692
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:52,000
has no celery in it no that's actually

693
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,679
that's actually for an incredible

694
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,200
that's an incredible supplement for all

695
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,960
kinds of stuff that's not

696
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,480
it's called celery forest but there's no

697
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,320
celery in there you can look you can

698
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,559
actually look into it

699
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,559
at vimrgy.com it's a wonderful

700
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:06,880
supplement that's not celery powder

701
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:09,840
that's not what that is

702
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:12,240
anyway you guys so i'll talk a little

703
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,799
bit more about this

704
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,679
and let's talk about benefits celery

705
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:18,880
juice benefits

706
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:22,320
what happens when you're

707
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:25,039
drinking this why does it even work

708
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,880
why is it helping people what's going on

709
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:27,200
with that that's that's the question

710
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,480
there

711
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,840
so here's what happens with celery juice

712
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,200
there's something in here called

713
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:38,240
sodium cluster salts that's not salt

714
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:41,039
it's not the same thing salt can't do

715
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,080
what this does this is a subgroup of

716
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:45,039
sodium

717
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:47,039
and it's suspended in living water but

718
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:50,320
it's a subgroup of sodium

719
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:53,440
that actually interferes

720
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:57,120
with pathogens so if you have

721
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:59,919
epstein-barr if you have

722
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,279
streptococcus in your system if you have

723
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:04,559
if you have anything if you have

724
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:07,760
hashimoto's ms lupus

725
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:09,120
ra chronic fatigue syndrome tingles

727
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,880

735
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,840

736
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,400
viral symptoms

737
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,600
and toxic heavy metal symptoms the

738
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,080
reason why

739
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,279
people start to get their lives back

740
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,840
when they're bringing this

741
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,320
in as one of the tools as one of them

742
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,600
and i

743
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:47,840
never said this is the only thing to do

744
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,919
this is just one of the powerful medical

745
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:53,039
medium tools right

746
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:55,760
but when this enters your body

747
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:57,200
something magical happens to begin with

748
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,440
inside of us

749
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,039
we have a big mess going on inside of us

750
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,600
okay we got

751
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:04,080
rancid fats clinging to our intestinal

752
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,559
tract

753
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:09,039
we got putrified proteins clinging to

754
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:11,360
the walls of our intestinal tract lining

755
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:13,279
it's harboring all kinds of bacteria

756
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,600
it's harboring all kinds of toxins

757
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:16,799
and when the celery juice enters and

758
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,240
goes in

759
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:23,200
it goes into that first it

760
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,799
starts to knock out bugs bugs that get

761
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,279
behind sibo

762
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:28,559
small intestinal bacterial overgrowth

763
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:32,559
bugs that get behind

764
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:35,919
acid reflux bugs that cause all kinds of

765
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:37,360
stomach bloating stomach pain

766
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,000
if you're somebody that's worried about

767
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:42,480
worms of any kind in your gut

768
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,799
it even goes after those and that's the

769
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:48,000
thing when it's going down in

770
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:51,360
it's starting to dismantle the bad

771
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,559
things and it's starting to clean things

772
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,320
up if you were told

773
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:56,240
you got parasites in your gut and that's

774
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:59,600
why you're sick whether it's right

775
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:01,840
or wrong or whatever the celery juice

776
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,600
starts to work on it if you were told

777
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,360
you got bacteria in your gut and your

778
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:08,399
microbiomes off

779
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:10,960
and your guts all in balance

780
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:12,000
and you got bad bacteria and mold and

781
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,520
yeast

782
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:19,200
and fungus in your gut the celery juice

783
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:21,600
starts to work on that and

784
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,880
one ounce of celery juice isn't going to

785
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:26,240
do that much

786
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,760
it's still good it's still good but it's

787
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,760
not going to do as much

788
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,480
like melody says what can i do for sibo

789
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:35,440
i'm talking about sibo right here and

790
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:37,200
the celery juice goes down in there and

791
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:42,000
it starts to shock

792
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:45,039
those bugs starts to basically electrify

793
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:48,080
those bugs starts to move them

794
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:48,960
out starts to weaken them starts to

795
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,760
break

796
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,720
down their membrane that keeps them

797
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,600
strong

798
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,960
and then the celery juice goes down in

799
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,120
and it finds its way

800
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,080
into the liver it goes into the hepatic

801
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,080
portal vein

802
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,840
it finds its way into the liver up into

803
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,080
the liver and then

804
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,000
it starts to go after little buggies in

805
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:11,520
there and starts to

806
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:15,039
dismantle toxins neutralize them

807
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,919
so one of my favorite benefits of celery

808
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:18,640
juice

809
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:20,240
one of my favorite benefits is it

810
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:23,600
neutralizes

811
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:26,399
poisons that have energy to them

812
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:28,080
meaning they're on a charge because

813
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:30,240
poisons and toxins

814
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:32,480
from toxic heavy metals and pesticides

815
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:35,320
and herbicides and plastics

816
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:38,080
and petroleum chemicals and

817
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:41,679
nanotechnology that we breathe in

818
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:44,960
everything that we get exposed to

819
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:47,840
has a charge to it and the celery juice

820
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,200
starts to neutralize that charge turn it

821
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,960
around

822
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,559
and that's what's amazing about it right

823
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,360
there it's one of the things

824
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:57,840
it it basically diffuses poisons and

825
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:00,240
toxins and at the same time

826
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,360
starts to break down the bugs the bugs

827
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,200
that are behind acne

828
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,480
so when you start drinking celery juice

829
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,279
and your acne

830
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,440
is starting to get better that's because

831
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:11,919
the streptococcus the bacteria behind

832
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:14,480
all the cystic acne that everybody has

833
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:16,000
is getting cleaned up from the celery

834
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,039
juice

835
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,200
and so when celery juice

836
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:22,640
gives somebody the runs or gives

837
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,919
somebody a little bit of

838
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,360
of diarrhea or give somebody

839
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:30,399
something like that where it's loose

840
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:33,679
stools when celery juice does that

841
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:34,799
it's killing bacteria is what it's doing

842
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,200
so i always recommend

843
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:40,159
you can reduce the dosage you can do

844
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:42,559
eight ounces you can do six ounces

845
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,919
you can do a little less but eventually

846
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:46,960
it goes away

847
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:49,279
that the runs or diarrhea or anything

848
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:52,480
like that goes away eventually

849
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:56,000
and that's what happens because

850
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:59,039
the celery juice ends up killing and

851
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,960
cleaning up the very bacteria and any

852
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:02,320
kind of yeast any kind of mold any kind

853
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,320
of fungus that's in the way

854
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,159
cleans it up shocks it out gets it out

855
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,840
of the system so you can do a lower

856
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:10,960
amount of celery juice if you guys just

857
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:13,600

866
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:32,960

that makes it so the juice gets really

908
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:57,840
squeezed out for celery and other things

909
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,840

from my back

916
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,039
i tried everything to heal it and

917
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:19,440

918
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,399
celery juice healed it quickly i mean

919
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,799

testimonials for celery juice changing

924
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:34,240
things

925
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:36,320
um sandra says how much time in between

926
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,919
what as i talk about in cleanse to heal

927
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,799
and i talk about in the celery juice

928
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:41,919
book

929
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:42,480
the distance i like is 20 minutes to 30

930
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,440
minutes

931
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,000
15 minutes the minimum would be the

932
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,840
minimum
