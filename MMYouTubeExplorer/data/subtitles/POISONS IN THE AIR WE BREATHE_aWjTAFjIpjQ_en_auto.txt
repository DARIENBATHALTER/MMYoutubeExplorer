[107.04 - 111.44] youtube amazing nicholas on youtube you
[109.12 - 112.96] guys on tick tock just so you know we're
[111.44 - 114.48] talking about
[112.96 - 115.60] what people are up against in the air
[114.48 - 117.20] what they're dealing with different
[115.60 - 118.56] smells
[117.20 - 121.28] so it's not like you can you know if
[118.56 - 122.88] people are near a beach and they go walk
[121.28 - 124.96] on the beach
[122.88 - 127.52] it's like you don't even smell the salt
[124.96 - 129.60] air anymore people go into a park
[127.52 - 131.36] and they're taking a walk in the park
[129.60 - 133.76] they don't smell the fresh air anymore
[131.36 - 136.08] so much people are completely
[133.76 - 138.88] blitzed out their
[136.08 - 141.44] senses are blitzed out
[138.88 - 143.12] their cranial nerves are blitzed out
[141.44 - 144.56] they can't smell
[143.12 - 146.24] anymore
[144.56 - 147.92] because they can't they don't know what
[146.24 - 150.64] they're smelling because they're so
[147.92 - 152.48] drenched in all kinds of toxic things
[150.64 - 153.84] right
[152.48 - 156.00] cold right spring says i can't believe
[153.84 - 156.80] you you would be back laugh out loud i'm
[156.00 - 158.16] back
[156.80 - 159.68] i'm back
[158.16 - 162.88] so
[159.68 - 165.76] so what happens is that we get so much
[162.88 - 168.84] scent like fragrances in our system
[165.76 - 171.60] we're smelling it all the time they're
[168.84 - 175.28] making sense last longer so there's
[171.60 - 177.12] detergents that are like extra scented
[175.28 - 178.96] like extra activated so what they're
[177.12 - 181.60] doing is they're making
[178.96 - 184.48] chemical fragrances
[181.60 - 187.04] where they become activated when you go
[184.48 - 188.88] near them practically i mean this is
[187.04 - 191.04] like diabolical
[188.88 - 193.44] chemical concoctions
[191.04 - 195.60] where if you touch
[193.44 - 197.36] whatever was on there like if you touch
[195.60 - 199.12] that fragrance
[197.36 - 201.84] if it was an air freshener and sprayed
[199.12 - 203.28] on a couch and you touch that couch it
[201.84 - 205.92] blows it up
[203.28 - 208.16] it blows it up that's how highly toxic
[205.92 - 210.08] toxic it is so chemical companies the
[208.16 - 212.56] chemical industry they sit there and
[210.08 - 214.32] they design all these dangerous
[212.56 - 216.48] chemicals
[214.32 - 218.32] and these things are just unchecked and
[216.48 - 220.64] then they just dump them in products and
[218.32 - 223.36] dump them in products right
[220.64 - 225.68] and that's how it works so perfumes and
[223.36 - 227.68] clones aren't what they used to be from
[225.68 - 228.43] yesteryear and this is important to know
[227.68 - 229.76] too right
[228.43 - 231.60] [Music]
[229.76 - 234.40] if you're somebody with chronic illness
[231.60 - 236.08] okay you don't want you don't want to be
[234.40 - 238.32] using perfumes and clones let's just
[236.08 - 240.56] break that one so we just it's just a
[238.32 - 241.68] continuation of the amazon live i just
[240.56 - 243.20] did
[241.68 - 245.60] yeah um
[243.20 - 247.68] yeah so tori said bioplane
[245.60 - 249.84] you check out that amazon live exactly i
[247.68 - 251.12] talked about all kinds of stuff right
[249.84 - 252.56] so
[251.12 - 254.64] what happens is people don't realize
[252.56 - 257.20] that perfumes and colognes aren't like
[254.64 - 259.28] they were a hundred years ago 80 years
[257.20 - 261.28] ago 60 years ago
[259.28 - 263.52] they're a lot worse now they're really
[261.28 - 264.72] dangerous chemical concoctions is what
[263.52 - 266.24] they are
[264.72 - 268.40] and people don't realize this and if
[266.24 - 270.00] anybody's got chronic illness and
[268.40 - 271.84] they're breathing this in every day
[270.00 - 273.68] there's people on
[271.84 - 276.00] instagram
[273.68 - 278.64] there's people right on facebook
[276.00 - 281.68] instagram on all the other platforms
[278.64 - 284.08] that have chronic illness they got all
[281.68 - 286.08] kinds of problems they got all kinds of
[284.08 - 287.76] nervous system problems migraines all
[286.08 - 289.84] these issues and then they're like okay
[287.76 - 292.88] i'm heading out to go see my friends
[289.84 - 294.96] right here i'm gonna head out and go see
[292.88 - 299.36] them i just got that all over me just
[294.96 - 299.36] now that's fantastic this is great
[299.84 - 303.12] so
[301.28 - 305.68] yeah
[303.12 - 305.68] so um
[307.36 - 311.28] oh my god
[309.20 - 312.48] that perfume bottle just exploded
[311.28 - 314.80] practically
[312.48 - 316.64] so people don't realize
[314.80 - 318.24] that when they get
[316.64 - 320.00] when they get this perfume oh let me
[318.24 - 322.88] just put some perfume on me here let me
[320.00 - 325.20] just spray some perfume on me right now
[322.88 - 326.56] and what they don't realize is is that's
[325.20 - 329.28] lowering their immune system and
[326.56 - 331.36] intoxicating them in a really
[329.28 - 333.36] effective way where it affects their
[331.36 - 335.68] lives so they can get the migraines
[333.36 - 338.56] worse worse headaches it can bring on
[335.68 - 342.24] neurological symptoms if someone has
[338.56 - 345.04] depression perfume and cologne won't
[342.24 - 346.48] help that depression it worsens the
[345.04 - 348.16] depression can help worsen the
[346.48 - 350.16] depression right
[348.16 - 351.52] these are things that we have in control
[350.16 - 353.28] we could be like okay i can stop my
[351.52 - 355.68] perfumes and clones
[353.28 - 359.12] i can stop my aftershaves right i can
[355.68 - 361.28] stop my really bad hair care products
[359.12 - 363.52] i can pull my air fresheners out of the
[361.28 - 366.40] wall we have control over those
[363.52 - 369.92] dangerous chemicals going into us every
[366.40 - 372.40] day knocking down our immune system
[369.92 - 373.12] knocking down our immune system

[402.80 - 406.72] tick-tock right now we're talking about
[405.36 - 408.16] we're talking about fragrances we're
[406.72 - 410.16] talking about chemicals we're talking
[408.16 - 412.00] about how much chemical scent and smell
[410.16 - 414.32] that we're breathing in and i talk about
[412.00 - 415.76] that and cleanse the heel too
[414.32 - 417.44] right i talk about chemical
[415.76 - 419.92] sensitivities in cleansing heals there's
[417.44 - 421.28] a chemical sensitivity section here
[419.92 - 423.36] check it out when you get a chance
[421.28 - 425.20] that's in cleanse the heel
[423.36 - 426.64] i talk about that i talk about like
[425.20 - 428.40] fragrances
[426.64 - 430.72] send the candles and all that stuff so
[428.40 - 431.60] send a candle santa candles is another
[430.72 - 434.48] one
[431.60 - 436.08] to be really concerned about
[434.48 - 437.84] is the scented candles they come in all
[436.08 - 439.20] shapes and sizes
[437.84 - 440.64] and
[439.20 - 442.00] that's something that's really
[440.64 - 443.52] interesting too so people think they're
[442.00 - 445.76] health experts of course and they're
[443.52 - 448.08] like well and you may be a health expert
[445.76 - 449.52] absolutely but what happens is there's a
[448.08 - 451.44] lot of people though they're like you
[449.52 - 454.24] know lighting their scented candles but
[451.44 - 456.16] they're also into natural health
[454.24 - 457.92] and they're literally intoxicating the
[456.16 - 459.12] people around them they're poisoning
[457.92 - 461.12] their family they're poisoning
[459.12 - 462.64] themselves with the said the candles
[461.12 - 464.48] because we're talking about a
[462.64 - 467.52] compilation of a
[464.48 - 470.32] thousand chemicals and more
[467.52 - 472.96] yeah incense is bad too totally crucial
[470.32 - 474.64] on youtube incense is really bad as well
[472.96 - 476.96] we're talking about a lot
[474.64 - 478.48] of chemical concoctions
[476.96 - 480.48] that are
[478.48 - 482.64] irritating and damaging to the central
[480.48 - 484.24] nervous system chemicals are a big one
[482.64 - 486.16] right now so we're heading to a place
[484.24 - 488.00] where no one
[486.16 - 490.08] 10 years from now
[488.00 - 492.80] is going to be able to really smell what
[490.08 - 493.76] nature smells like anymore those days
[492.80 - 495.76] are over
[493.76 - 496.80] because people are going to be coated in
[495.76 - 499.12] all this stuff they're going to be
[496.80 - 502.24] coated in fabric softeners detergents
[499.12 - 503.84] that have scents and fragrances right
[502.24 - 504.64] they're going to be coated in all of
[503.84 - 506.80] this
[504.64 - 508.80] okay so michael h says poisons are
[506.80 - 510.72] everywhere and we must live in constant
[508.80 - 512.96] fear aw
[510.72 - 514.56] we don't we we don't that's not it at
[512.96 - 516.56] all what it is it's about chronic
[514.56 - 518.48] illness so if you're somebody with no
[516.56 - 520.48] chronic illness
[518.48 - 522.56] okay and you're not struggling with any
[520.48 - 524.24] kind of symptoms and conditions
[522.56 - 527.76] and you want to douse yourself in
[524.24 - 529.44] chemicals until someday those chemicals
[527.76 - 531.36] take you out
[529.44 - 533.36] be that person
[531.36 - 535.20] so if you're not sick with anything and
[533.36 - 536.72] you want to use all the fabric softeners
[535.20 - 538.72] and you want to use the detergents with
[536.72 - 540.40] the fragrances you want to dump perfumes
[538.72 - 542.88] and clones on you and you want to burn
[540.40 - 545.60] scented candles and you want to stick
[542.88 - 548.56] plug-ins in the wall and you want to
[545.60 - 550.32] cook yourself with all this stuff right
[548.56 - 552.56] if you want to do that and live your
[550.32 - 553.92] life fine eventually it'll get you in
[552.56 - 555.84] the end and you'll be like walking
[553.92 - 558.56] around dementia and be like this later
[555.84 - 558.56] on you'll be like
[558.72 - 563.04] you'll just be that person that walked
[560.32 - 565.44] out of their house
[563.04 - 568.88] in their underwear
[565.44 - 570.56] and you're walking down the street
[568.88 - 572.24] and all of a sudden a family member has
[570.56 - 574.24] to call the police
[572.24 - 576.00] and they have to say my aunt just walked
[574.24 - 578.96] out of the house she's got dementia we
[576.00 - 578.96] don't know where she went
[579.12 - 583.52] and that's what happens you know so that
[581.36 - 585.04] will happen later on fine you might be
[583.52 - 586.24] that person you get nothing going on but
[585.04 - 587.76] when it comes down to chronic illness
[586.24 - 590.32] when it comes down to neurological
[587.76 - 593.12] symptoms when it comes down to aches and
[590.32 - 594.48] pains ticks and spasms chronic fatigue
[593.12 - 597.04] burning skin
[594.48 - 599.28] jaw pain neck pain back pain eczema
[597.04 - 600.72] psoriasis you want to know
[599.28 - 602.64] about these chemicals and these
[600.72 - 603.44] fragrances you want to know about them
[602.64 - 605.28] all
[603.44 - 608.64] that's really important because it's
[605.28 - 610.96] it's not about being in fear
[608.64 - 613.28] it's about protecting yourself so does
[610.96 - 614.56] it make sense to you where
[613.28 - 617.52] okay because
[614.56 - 618.48] i know somebody right
[617.52 - 620.00] that
[618.48 - 622.00] they use cologne
[620.00 - 623.92] lots of it right
[622.00 - 626.80] lots of it okay
[623.92 - 626.80] their child
[627.28 - 630.32] and their pets
[628.64 - 633.04] have all these problems
[630.32 - 634.80] and the clone is just like saturating
[633.04 - 636.88] the house because every time you use it
[634.80 - 638.48] every day it gets on everything it rubs
[636.88 - 640.16] on the walls it gets on the furniture it
[638.48 - 641.36] gets in everything right
[640.16 - 642.48] right
[641.36 - 645.44] and so
[642.48 - 647.36] the the children were getting sick baby
[645.44 - 649.68] was getting sick
[647.36 - 650.72] pets were getting sick
[649.68 - 651.84] right
[650.72 - 654.64] and
[651.84 - 656.88] this person got rid of the clone
[654.64 - 660.56] and everybody started getting better
[656.88 - 662.16] it's that toxic that toxic and it all
[660.56 - 664.16] depends on what's happening in your life
[662.16 - 667.60] you can be that person it doesn't affect
[664.16 - 669.44] but eventually it will right so
[667.60 - 671.76] when it comes down to all of these
[669.44 - 674.24] chemicals it's not like it used to be
[671.76 - 676.80] these chemicals are a lot more dangerous
[674.24 - 678.72] because they go deep into your cells
[676.80 - 680.72] they go deep into your organs and
[678.72 - 684.48] there's a difference here
[680.72 - 688.04] it's not like it was years ago okay
[684.48 - 688.04] we're in a time
[688.64 - 693.44] cornelius says i lost smell since
[690.48 - 695.36] december don't don't smell a thing but
[693.44 - 696.48] get headaches around cleaning products
[695.36 - 699.04] or perfumes
[696.48 - 701.60] or perfumes because the reason why is
[699.04 - 704.08] even though you can't smell the perfume
[701.60 - 704.88] right perfume perfumes you can't smell
[704.08 - 706.24] them
[704.88 - 707.92] they're causing
[706.24 - 709.60] a problem with your central nervous
[707.92 - 712.24] system so they cause a problem with your
[709.60 - 714.08] health it's a prime example but when you
[712.24 - 715.52] can smell them too you'll even correlate
[714.08 - 717.84] it that way too
[715.52 - 717.84] okay
[718.00 - 720.00] yeah
[719.04 - 722.08] so
[720.00 - 723.76] christy i was struggling with chemical
[722.08 - 726.56] sensitivities before knowing from
[723.76 - 728.16] anthony its origins thank god i know now
[726.56 - 729.84] how to protect myself with this
[728.16 - 732.32] information kristy why don't you just
[729.84 - 734.08] plug in air fresheners
[732.32 - 736.88] light some scented candles start get
[734.08 - 739.36] some new perfumes right no you no way
[736.88 - 741.12] cause exactly you're so smart
[739.36 - 742.80] because it's important once you know you
[741.12 - 745.04] can protect yourself and not have all
[742.80 - 747.12] that exactly so here's what happens with
[745.04 - 748.88] the chemicals today and i want to just
[747.12 - 750.96] i just want to run this by you guys this
[748.88 - 754.00] is serious stuff
[750.96 - 756.72] what's in scented candles and
[754.00 - 758.64] ever since the whole plague started
[756.72 - 762.88] the scent scenic candle world has
[758.64 - 764.80] exploded every single person practically
[762.88 - 766.96] in the united states
[764.80 - 769.84] and other places around the world almost
[766.96 - 772.40] every single person decided to buy a
[769.84 - 774.56] candle or start burning the candles they
[772.40 - 777.52] had and buy more candles
[774.56 - 779.44] and so every home and apartment around
[777.52 - 781.52] the world basically especially in the
[779.44 - 783.28] u.s they're scented candles now burning
[781.52 - 784.56] so ever since everybody was kind of like
[783.28 - 786.80] locked down
[784.56 - 788.64] in that plague situation
[786.80 - 790.32] they were just burning scented candles
[788.64 - 791.60] it was like rituals everybody had them
[790.32 - 793.44] on their coffee tables they had them in
[791.60 - 794.40] their bedrooms it just it's the candles
[793.44 - 796.80] right
[794.40 - 798.80] they got highly highly intoxicated we've
[796.80 - 800.96] come to a point where
[798.80 - 802.56] it's really out of control so what what
[800.96 - 804.48] is in here what's a chemical what's a
[802.56 - 807.68] dangerous chemical it's a synthesized
[804.48 - 810.08] it's synthesized material that was
[807.68 - 811.60] synthesized off of another material off
[810.08 - 813.04] of another material off another material
[811.60 - 814.24] chemicals aren't just they create a
[813.04 - 817.12] chemical and that's the chemical they
[814.24 - 818.72] use and that's it they create a chemical
[817.12 - 819.84] then they mix it with another chemical
[818.72 - 821.36] create a new chemical mix it with
[819.84 - 823.60] another chemical create a pneumochemical
[821.36 - 825.76] and what they do is they create
[823.60 - 827.20] like a bloodline
[825.76 - 829.28] of chemicals
[827.20 - 830.88] that are destructive in nature more
[829.28 - 832.24] stronger than the last chemical and
[830.88 - 833.92] stronger than the last chemical and then
[832.24 - 835.36] stronger than the last chemical and
[833.92 - 837.04] that's one of the reasons why it's so
[835.36 - 838.64] devastating on the system and everything
[837.04 - 840.24] we're live right now on rumble youtube
[838.64 - 841.20] facebook getter
[840.24 - 843.84] twitch
[841.20 - 845.68] tick tock telegram we're even live on
[843.84 - 847.68] twitch like twitch
[845.68 - 849.68] we're live on twitch we're live on
[847.68 - 851.20] twitch you guys
[849.68 - 852.72] that's a really cool twitch so i'm
[851.20 - 854.84] excited about that i'm excited with all
[852.72 - 857.44] this all
[854.84 - 859.52] right yep our local hairdresser sprayed
[857.44 - 861.52] many chemicals on my hair so next time
[859.52 - 863.12] no what you do is when you get your hair
[861.52 - 864.72] done
[863.12 - 866.88] get your hair done you don't have to get
[864.72 - 867.84] the chemical say look can i not get all
[866.88 - 870.00] the
[867.84 - 872.48] all the chemicals can you not spray all
[870.00 - 874.40] those chemicals on me afterwards like
[872.48 - 876.64] that's a nice hairstyle we just gave you
[874.40 - 879.12] let me just
[876.64 - 881.20] spray all this chemical on you right
[879.12 - 882.80] it's like when it comes out as chemicals
[881.20 - 885.76] they're not much different than this
[882.80 - 887.68] right here it's like basically
[885.76 - 890.08] look i'm just gonna spray this insects
[887.68 - 891.44] killer on your on your head okay so let
[890.08 - 893.44] me just spray this on your head
[891.44 - 895.60] afterwards
[893.44 - 896.56] there isn't much different a difference
[895.60 - 898.56] at all
[896.56 - 900.56] from pesticides herbicides fungicides
[898.56 - 903.44] because pesticides are in hair care
[900.56 - 906.16] products they're in perfumes i'm not
[903.44 - 907.60] talking about a trace of pesticide i'm
[906.16 - 909.52] talking about
[907.60 - 911.68] pesticide
[909.52 - 913.60] like a certain level of it a certain
[911.68 - 915.04] amount of it used as an ingredient
[913.60 - 916.88] purposely that's the difference like
[915.04 - 918.56] they're like okay we're going to make
[916.88 - 919.92] this perfume
[918.56 - 921.36] and we're going to add the ingredients
[919.92 - 922.96] into this perfume since nobody knows
[921.36 - 924.72] what they are and we're going to add
[922.96 - 926.16] actual pesticide and they actually put
[924.72 - 927.76] real pesticides and that's the whole
[926.16 - 930.64] point that's why pesticides smell like
[927.76 - 935.20] perfume people don't realize it
[930.64 - 936.96] pesticides insecticides lawn chemicals
[935.20 - 938.80] okay if you've ever
[936.96 - 940.32] if you ever live near a conventional
[938.80 - 942.16] farm
[940.32 - 943.68] where they're spraying everything
[942.16 - 945.52] they're spraying tomatoes they're
[943.68 - 947.36] spraying you know whatever it is
[945.52 - 948.96] zucchini they're spraying whatever it is
[947.36 - 951.12] if you ever been next to a conventional
[948.96 - 953.28] farmer they're spraying cabbage
[951.12 - 956.56] it's perfume
[953.28 - 960.72] the insecticides are using on all of the
[956.56 - 962.48] crops are straight perfume you literally
[960.72 - 964.64] you litter there's no difference between
[962.48 - 966.64] the person walking by in the street with
[964.64 - 969.44] the perfume the wind blowing the perfume
[966.64 - 971.04] off of them and what's in the field
[969.44 - 973.52] they're one and the same people don't
[971.04 - 975.60] realize that that's how crazy it is yes
[973.52 - 977.36] there's differences but they're actually
[975.60 - 979.12] still connected
[977.36 - 982.00] check out chuckie elle says i was hoping
[979.12 - 984.24] he'd be here on twitch
[982.00 - 987.12] incredible

[1003.04 - 1005.36] all right
[1007.84 - 1011.20] every time i say twitch it's like i want
[1009.68 - 1013.76] to start twitching
[1011.20 - 1015.28] all right okay all right
[1013.76 - 1017.76] you guys this is incredible so we're
[1015.28 - 1019.36] here we're talking about the damaging
[1017.76 - 1022.72] effects of these chemicals so we're
[1019.36 - 1024.32] breathing in more toxins than we know
[1022.72 - 1026.08] and they're around us every day so the
[1024.32 - 1028.00] regular ones are like your fabrics
[1026.08 - 1030.48] offenders your detergents right your
[1028.00 - 1032.24] household cleaners right your insect
[1030.48 - 1033.84] killers right that's the whole thing
[1032.24 - 1036.00] your insect killers
[1033.84 - 1037.04] right you want to like kill your insects
[1036.00 - 1039.04] right
[1037.04 - 1040.40] and everything's got a roach right here
[1039.04 - 1042.40] everybody's trying to kill everything
[1040.40 - 1044.40] that crawls into their house
[1042.40 - 1045.76] and they're breathing all that up
[1044.40 - 1048.08] breathing it in it's getting in their
[1045.76 - 1050.16] organs so where does all the stuff go
[1048.08 - 1052.72] it goes inside the liver
[1050.16 - 1054.64] that's one place it goes it goes inside
[1052.72 - 1056.48] every single organ it goes inside the
[1054.64 - 1058.56] lungs it stays in the lungs forever it
[1056.48 - 1061.92] goes inside the heart stays in the heart
[1058.56 - 1061.92] stays in the nervous system
[1062.32 - 1068.24] i mean it's just it it travels all
[1065.04 - 1070.32] through the body
[1068.24 - 1071.84] and it stays in the body stays in the
[1070.32 - 1073.60] brain that's the other place it goes
[1071.84 - 1075.28] that's a big deal right there so any
[1073.60 - 1078.56] chemicals we're breathing in
[1075.28 - 1080.64] stays in the brain forever
[1078.56 - 1082.80] it just does
[1080.64 - 1084.64] stays in the brain forever unless we get
[1082.80 - 1087.60] it out and it's hard to get it out
[1084.64 - 1090.80] unless you do the right things
[1087.60 - 1092.88] so soph 743 says hey anthony

[1244.32 - 1249.28] when you can on telegram doing exclusive
[1246.64 - 1250.40] audio messages and in amazon live today
[1249.28 - 1252.40] i talked about air cleaners we're
[1250.40 - 1254.16] talking about air quality right now
[1252.40 - 1255.52] so make sure you check out the amazon
[1254.16 - 1256.96] live i just did because i was showing
[1255.52 - 1258.80] everybody air cleaners it was really
[1256.96 - 1259.92] cool link is in the description just so
[1258.80 - 1262.00] you know
[1259.92 - 1263.44] it's a b12 right here when it comes down
[1262.00 - 1265.52] to the central nervous system it's
[1263.44 - 1267.52] critical
[1265.52 - 1269.28] critical to have the b12 you need now
[1267.52 - 1271.92] b12 testing
[1269.28 - 1275.20] doesn't cut the mustard it doesn't
[1271.92 - 1277.52] because they can't tell in a b12 test if
[1275.20 - 1279.44] the b12 is entered the nervous system so
[1277.52 - 1281.20] i always keep people that i've ever
[1279.44 - 1283.68] known like friends and family i keep
[1281.20 - 1286.24] them on a lot of b12
[1283.68 - 1288.48] and i keep staying like i personally
[1286.24 - 1290.32] take a lot of b12 every single day
[1288.48 - 1292.00] that's what i do this is the vimergy b12
[1290.32 - 1292.80] it's v is in victor
[1292.00 - 1296.20] i
[1292.80 - 1297.76] am is in mary ergy dot com so
[1296.20 - 1299.36] vimergy.com
[1297.76 - 1301.52] i'm not sponsored this is the
[1299.36 - 1303.20] methylcobalamin in adenosil cobalamin
[1301.52 - 1306.08] b12
[1303.20 - 1307.04] this is the b12 to use
[1306.08 - 1309.44] okay
[1307.04 - 1311.92] i don't own the b12 company and i'm not
[1309.44 - 1314.16] sponsored but this is the one that i use
[1311.92 - 1317.60] and i give friends and family right
[1314.16 - 1318.64] so it's one of the defenses
[1317.60 - 1321.44] use
[1318.64 - 1322.96] against like the chemical world because
[1321.44 - 1324.80] if you're gonna be
[1322.96 - 1326.32] if your central nervous system is gonna
[1324.80 - 1327.60] be under
[1326.32 - 1329.28] fire
[1327.60 - 1331.68] from all the chemicals from the
[1329.28 - 1332.96] fragrances from the scented candles from
[1331.68 - 1334.32] the plug-in
[1332.96 - 1337.04] fresheners
[1334.32 - 1338.72] right from the perfumes colognes from
[1337.04 - 1339.76] the mosquito spray falling out of the

[1432.88 - 1435.20] right
[1435.76 - 1439.76] i do it twice a day
[1437.76 - 1441.20] if i'm under a lot of stress if i'm not

[1441.20 - 1444.88] hours if i'm doing 18 hour days 20 hour
[1443.36 - 1447.04] days
[1444.88 - 1449.60] what i'll do is i'll take a lot more so
[1447.04 - 1452.40] when i'm doing 20 hour days
[1449.60 - 1454.72] i do four dropper holes twice a day
[1452.40 - 1457.76] i'll do six dropper fulls twice a day if
[1454.72 - 1459.52] i'm really up against a lot of stress
[1457.76 - 1461.20] lots going on in my life
[1459.52 - 1463.68] personal life
[1461.20 - 1466.48] and professional life right
[1463.68 - 1468.72] where i'm working 20 hours a day at the
[1466.48 - 1470.40] same time getting kicked in the stomach
[1468.72 - 1473.20] i walk around with a kick me sign on my
[1470.40 - 1474.80] back just so you know i do
[1473.20 - 1476.40] it comes with the territory of hearing a
[1474.80 - 1477.60] voice that's age four so walk around
[1476.40 - 1479.28] with the kick me sign in the back it's
[1477.60 - 1481.44] just what happens you know so when
[1479.28 - 1483.44] things are happening in life
[1481.44 - 1485.12] b12 is critical for protecting yourself
[1483.44 - 1486.56] critical for protecting your nervous
[1485.12 - 1487.68] system because it's about the nervous
[1486.56 - 1489.92] system
[1487.68 - 1491.52] that's a big deal and so whenever so
[1489.92 - 1495.12] we're talking about like chemical
[1491.52 - 1496.88] fragrances perfumes perfumes fragrance
[1495.12 - 1499.04] means
[1496.88 - 1501.84] you're not allowed to know what's in
[1499.04 - 1503.92] there the reason why
[1501.84 - 1506.40] you're not allowed to know what's in
[1503.92 - 1508.16] that fragrance
[1506.40 - 1509.68] whether it's an air freshener a plug-in
[1508.16 - 1511.20] one whether it's a spray one whether
[1509.68 - 1512.64] it's a spray bottle one whether it's out
[1511.20 - 1515.28] of a can the reason why you're not so
[1512.64 - 1517.44] allowed to know what's in in that
[1515.28 - 1520.96] fragrance
[1517.44 - 1522.32] is because it's highly toxic
[1520.96 - 1525.44] if
[1522.32 - 1526.84] someone was to fill
[1525.44 - 1530.56] a giant
[1526.84 - 1532.56] container of that fragrance in there
[1530.56 - 1534.64] and you were to dive in there
[1532.56 - 1536.80] and take a bath in it
[1534.64 - 1539.28] you would die
[1536.80 - 1540.84] but when it's in small amounts
[1539.28 - 1544.32] you don't die
[1540.84 - 1545.84] fast spray it on you
[1544.32 - 1548.48] breathe it in
[1545.84 - 1549.60] you don't die quick right you breathe it
[1548.48 - 1551.84] in
[1549.60 - 1554.40] get the laundry going oh i got the
[1551.84 - 1556.32] laundry with the extra fragrance scent
[1554.40 - 1557.20] in there let me get my laundry out of
[1556.32 - 1559.92] there
[1557.20 - 1560.88] you know fabric softeners you don't die
[1559.92 - 1564.24] quick
[1560.88 - 1565.76] right it's a slow death really slow
[1564.24 - 1568.00] death right
[1565.76 - 1569.60] now if they took all those chemicals
[1568.00 - 1571.04] from your fabric softener from your
[1569.60 - 1573.36] detergents
[1571.04 - 1575.92] from your perfumes from all this stuff
[1573.36 - 1579.12] and they put they put it into a big
[1575.92 - 1581.04] swimming pool and they pushed you in it
[1579.12 - 1583.68] and you decided to take a bath for an
[1581.04 - 1585.04] hour in it you would die
[1583.68 - 1586.56] you would die
[1585.04 - 1588.88] that would be it you would die in the
[1586.56 - 1591.12] hole you would die in that in that in
[1588.88 - 1593.28] that chemical bath
[1591.12 - 1594.88] so but what they do is just put a little
[1593.28 - 1597.44] in all these things
[1594.88 - 1599.04] and they they kill you that way
[1597.44 - 1600.48] right
[1599.04 - 1603.04] death by a thousand cuts that's right
[1600.48 - 1604.80] jeanette exactly spot on
[1603.04 - 1606.40] so and you brought up the beach somebody
[1604.80 - 1607.60] brought up the b12 earlier so it's
[1606.40 - 1609.52] talking about how that protects the
[1607.60 - 1610.72] nervous system and it's one of those
[1609.52 - 1612.72] great things
[1610.72 - 1615.04] that i use for friends and family it's

[1646.32 - 1650.64] b12 are you taking your b12
[1648.80 - 1652.56] anyway that's the vimergy just letting
[1650.64 - 1654.80] you guys know
[1652.56 - 1657.76] just so you know it's a v v is victor i
[1654.80 - 1659.68] m e r g dot com it's vmrg.com i'm not
[1657.76 - 1662.40] sponsored
[1659.68 - 1664.24] not the owner of the company
[1662.40 - 1666.00] um okay
[1664.24 - 1667.52] so we're we're talking about chemical
[1666.00 - 1669.36] chemical products chemical sense and
[1667.52 - 1672.72] then there's stuff that is it's out of
[1669.36 - 1673.84] our control they drop it out of the sky
[1672.72 - 1675.20] so there's all the chemicals are
[1673.84 - 1678.24] dropping out of the sky in us all the
[1675.20 - 1680.16] time mosquito spray right so that's just
[1678.24 - 1682.40] happening all the time they're just
[1680.16 - 1684.48] dropping mosquito spray out there they
[1682.40 - 1687.20] put billions and trillions and trillions
[1684.48 - 1688.72] of genetically modified mosquitoes out
[1687.20 - 1690.40] there
[1688.72 - 1692.16] and then they drop mosquito spray which
[1690.40 - 1694.24] doesn't kill them
[1692.16 - 1696.08] because they're still there
[1694.24 - 1698.24] they can helicopter all that mosquito
[1696.08 - 1700.24] spray over us all the time in every
[1698.24 - 1703.36] state in the united states all around
[1700.24 - 1704.56] the globe they drop it on everybody
[1703.36 - 1705.76] every year
[1704.56 - 1707.92] every month
[1705.76 - 1708.88] every other week in your town in your
[1707.92 - 1710.40] village
[1708.88 - 1711.52] whether anybody likes it or not they
[1710.40 - 1712.72] drop it
[1711.52 - 1713.84] so they're doing is they're like just
[1712.72 - 1715.76] doing that
[1713.84 - 1717.60] because they're trying to exterminate
[1715.76 - 1720.16] mosquitoes
[1717.60 - 1722.48] but they never get rid of them
[1720.16 - 1724.88] exactly and then we're breathing that in
[1722.48 - 1727.60] all the time okay
[1724.88 - 1729.60] so yeah when it comes down to b12 levels
[1727.60 - 1732.40] it works like this even if your b12
[1729.60 - 1735.28] levels show up good
[1732.40 - 1738.32] it doesn't mean they're testing your b12
[1735.28 - 1739.76] levels in your central nervous system
[1738.32 - 1742.56] they can't
[1739.76 - 1743.44] check how much b12 is in your vagus
[1742.56 - 1744.80] nerves
[1743.44 - 1745.92] so let's talk about that for a little
[1744.80 - 1748.24] bit
[1745.92 - 1748.24] okay
[1748.64 - 1753.84] so your brain stem back here okay
[1751.84 - 1756.16] this is important to know your brain
[1753.84 - 1758.48] stem
[1756.16 - 1758.48] all right
[1758.88 - 1763.92] okay your brain stem that comes down
[1761.20 - 1765.36] right comes down through here
[1763.92 - 1768.24] your vagus nerves that come off your
[1765.36 - 1770.56] brain stem they can't do a b12 test on
[1768.24 - 1772.72] your vagus nerves they can't check your
[1770.56 - 1775.68] brain stem to see how much b12 is in
[1772.72 - 1776.64] your brain stem they can't check
[1775.68 - 1778.08] your
[1776.64 - 1780.88] brain
[1778.08 - 1782.96] to see how much b12 is in your brain
[1780.88 - 1784.24] right but if you're still chronically
[1782.96 - 1786.08] sick
[1784.24 - 1791.04] and you've got anxiety
[1786.08 - 1793.76] depression bipolar ocd depersonalization
[1791.04 - 1795.20] right schizophrenia
[1793.76 - 1796.72] body pain
[1795.20 - 1799.84] burning skin
[1796.72 - 1801.76] tingles numbness twitches
[1799.84 - 1803.28] by the way we're on twitch you guys now
[1801.76 - 1804.88] spasms
[1803.28 - 1805.84] okay
[1804.88 - 1806.88] right
[1805.84 - 1808.80] and
[1806.88 - 1810.00] ticks
[1808.80 - 1811.44] right
[1810.00 - 1813.20] dizziness
[1811.44 - 1816.40] vertigo
[1813.20 - 1819.20] ringing in the ears tinnitus if you got
[1816.40 - 1822.08] all of that or any of it
[1819.20 - 1825.28] your central nervous system
[1822.08 - 1826.80] needs that b12 so they'll say your b12
[1825.28 - 1828.88] levels are fine
[1826.80 - 1830.56] but if you got all these conditions or
[1828.88 - 1833.04] symptoms
[1830.56 - 1834.16] your b12 levels aren't fine it's
[1833.04 - 1836.56] critical
[1834.16 - 1839.84] to actually
[1836.56 - 1841.76] to actually fix things it really is
[1839.84 - 1843.20] all right so
[1841.76 - 1844.88] you guys we're just covering some
[1843.20 - 1846.96] different stuff on chemicals chemical
