1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,679
How many people you know like pizza? Do

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:05,759
you like pizza? This is a collaboration

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:08,240
between Medical Medium Cafe Gratitude.

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,160
Medical Medium pizzas on the menu. The

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,320
first of its kind. They've never done a

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,320
collaboration with somebody with pizzas.

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,679
They're known for their pizzas around

8
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,279
the world. Their pizzas are

9
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,119
unbelievable. They're delicious. You

10
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,199
should come and try them. But also, when

11
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,920
you do, try the Medical Medium pizzas on

12
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,560
the menu because those are on another

13
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,880
level because of Chef Drew and me.

14
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:32,079
Medical Medium, we work together on the

15
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:35,360
crust. It's a chickpea crust with potato

16
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:38,320
and sweet potato. It is so delicious and

17
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:41,520
so pure and so clean. All of our years

18
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:44,320
of experience went into these crusts.

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,879
That alone is a whole another level. I

20
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,879
love pizzas. I'm all about pizzas. But

21
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,480
the problem is you can't get pizzas out

22
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,399
there in the world too easy that are

23
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,000
really good. There's a lot of oil.

24
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,520
There's a lot of salt. A lot of people

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,680
get salted out when they're eating

26
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,480
pizza. These are low sodium,

27
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,440
gluten-free, soyf free, nutree. You

28
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,360
could eat these pizzas every single day

29
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,760
and get that sensation and that

30
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:12,640
delicious pizza flavor with that

31
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:14,080
incredible crust and feel good.

32
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,840
What are you most excited about with

33
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,960
this collaboration between Cafe

34
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,119
Gratitude and Medical Medium? The pizza.

35
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,119
Yeah, it's really exciting. Like medical

36
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,799
medium pizza. Hello. I mean, I

37
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,400
personally haven't had pizza in I don't

38
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,799
know how many years. I've been like

39
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,560
dying for some pizza recently. Yes. She

40
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,000
knows. Yeah. Yeah. Are you excited to

41
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,280
try the pizza? Yes. Being on this

42
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,840
lifestyle, a lot of restaurants, like

43
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,880
the most mm friendly thing you can get

44
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:44,240
is a salad. And I'm like, how many times

45
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,399
can I eat a salad at a restaurant? You

46
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,159
kind of get tired of it. But now the

47
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:52,159
pizzas, we're going to have it here. And

48
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:55,119
so I'm so excited to try it out.

49
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:57,439
Oh my god, this pizza is like beyond.

50
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:00,000
The pizza was just delicious. The crust

51
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:02,399
was phenomenal. This pizza had more

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,479
flavor and more complex flavor. Like at

53
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,240
home, I can never make it that tasty or

54
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,920
that crunchy. This is really, really

55
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,879
nice. Restaurant quality. Yeah. You

56
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:14,160
know, the flavors all work together. It

57
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:15,760
tastes like a pizza.

58
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,200
I think the pizza is a nice treat cuz

59
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,680
it's something we don't get very often

60
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,080
and it's not anything that I can make

61
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,640
myself without a lot of effort. I love

62
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,200
them. I love them. So tasty and so

63
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,480
healthy. It's just with every bite I

64
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,480
feel like, oh, give me more. It's so

65
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,879
delicious. Prior to this, it's not like

66
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,640
I was ever able to order takeout or

67
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,879
anything. Um, so this is a really great

68
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,440
option to have for me to feel like I'm

69
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,200
like partaking in normal life. The pizza

70
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,480
was incredible. I haven't had pizza in

71
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,640
so long and sorry I ate both pieces, but

72
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,080
it was so good. This is the first time

73
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,920
in 9 years where I've gotten to go out

74
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,800
to eat with Lauren and she hasn't had to

75
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,800
bring her own food. That means the world

76
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,319
to see my sister sit down and eat a full

77
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,720
meal and be taken care of and not be

78
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,560
judged. So to me, the food's excellent,

79
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,640
but it's also someone created this

80
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,120
environment where you can feel included

81
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,200
and

82
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,959
seen. It makes me emotional, but it's

83
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,040
beautiful. She deserves that all the

84
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:16,040
time. But to get it like this is so

85
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,040
special.

86
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,560
How many people love pizza for their

87
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,480
comfort food, but they don't eat it

88
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,720
every single day? Because in the end,

89
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,720
it's not really comforting. But if you

90
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,599
can have pizza every night as a comfort

91
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,599
food and still stay in shape, do your

92
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,120
healing, get nutrients you need, if

93
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:36,640
that's something you want, you should

94
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,799
try it. And these pizzas taste decadent.

95
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,200
They're gourmet pizzas. here at Cafe

96
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,200
Gratitude. Come on down anytime you get

97
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,920
a chance. This is an amazing special

98
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,000
moment in my life to know that they

99
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:51,760
collaborated with me, Medical Medium,

100
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,319
two incredible legendary iconic pizzas

101
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,799
now because it's here at this legendary

102
00:03:54,319 --> 00:04:00,190
iconic restaurant. I can't wait for you

103
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:06,180
guys to try them.
