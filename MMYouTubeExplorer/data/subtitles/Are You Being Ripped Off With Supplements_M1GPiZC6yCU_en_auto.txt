[0.00 - 3.90] in their body they're worried about what
[2.16 - 6.36] they're eating they're worried about
[3.90 - 8.34] different exposures they're worried
[6.36 - 11.52] about the quality of what they're
[8.34 - 14.46] ingesting or putting on their body it's
[11.52 - 16.74] all about oh this has got coconut oil in
[14.46 - 19.26] it this has got and everybody is always
[16.74 - 22.56] concerned about like what bad things
[19.26 - 24.24] could be in things meanwhile I see it
[22.56 - 26.34] out there every single day they're
[24.24 - 28.98] taking supplements
[26.34 - 30.66] and they're taking supplements that are
[28.98 - 32.52] filled with crap
[30.66 - 34.86] and they're getting ripped off
[32.52 - 37.80] bottom line that's what's happening out
[34.86 - 40.08] there all day long it's going on out
[37.80 - 41.34] there and people don't realize it
[40.08 - 43.26] and there's a whole bunch of people out
[41.34 - 46.32] there with sensitivities
[43.26 - 47.88] but they don't realize they're taking
[46.32 - 50.10] supplements with all kinds of different
[47.88 - 52.50] additives in there and different
[50.10 - 54.72] impurities in there and different toxins
[52.50 - 57.30] in there and they don't realize that's
[54.72 - 59.10] contributing to their sensitivities
[57.30 - 60.42] so so many people out there don't know
[59.10 - 62.76] what's in their supplements they're
[60.42 - 65.70] blindly taking things that seem like
[62.76 - 69.06] they're trendy or hot companies in the
[65.70 - 70.98] moment or fast talkers or people who own
[69.06 - 73.32] supplement companies that are talking a
[70.98 - 75.60] good you know Vibe they're talking good
[73.32 - 77.82] whatever our stuff is the best stuff and
[75.60 - 79.98] the best quality meanwhile there's crap
[77.82 - 81.60] and garbage all through it and this is
[79.98 - 83.16] going to blow your mind when I discuss a
[81.60 - 85.50] little bit about this you don't want to
[83.16 - 87.12] miss this episode because if you care
[85.50 - 89.10] about yourself if you care about your
[87.12 - 90.84] health you care about your body you're
[89.10 - 92.40] going to want to know whether you like
[90.84 - 93.18] me or not whether you're somebody that's
[92.40 - 94.80] like

[94.80 - 98.70] medium guy well I don't like the medical

[100.86 - 106.20] should know so you can treat your body
[103.62 - 108.30] good you still should have the respect

[298.56 - 302.28] bit so why care about lemon bomb why
[300.84 - 306.18] care about propolis to begin with
[302.28 - 308.58] because you're looking at nervous system
[306.18 - 312.14] think about that nervous system and
[308.58 - 315.24] you're looking at immune system two
[312.14 - 318.30] critical aspects of regaining Health
[315.24 - 320.64] right there this isn't just because oh
[318.30 - 322.62] lemon bombs interesting lemon bombs fun
[320.64 - 325.28] propolis is interesting propolis is fun
[322.62 - 327.36] no it's not that at all this is critical
[325.28 - 330.06] nervous system
[327.36 - 334.50] central nervous system right
[330.06 - 337.32] and immune system two critical aspects
[334.50 - 339.18] of moving someone forward
[337.32 - 340.98] so important right there so many people
[339.18 - 344.04] are sick so many people are struggling
[340.98 - 349.02] emotionally mentally physically all of
[344.04 - 351.84] it and two things immune system it's so
[349.02 - 353.34] important and nervous system
[351.84 - 355.74] we're going to go deeper on to the
[353.34 - 357.78] nervous system deeper on to the into the
[355.74 - 360.42] immune system as well so let's get down
[357.78 - 364.74] to the nitty-gritty let's get down to
[360.42 - 366.30] the bad news the bad news
[364.74 - 367.86] when you go into the store and you're
[366.30 - 370.08] buying your lemon balm and you go in the
[367.86 - 372.12] store and you're buying your propolis or
[370.08 - 375.54] whatever it is you're buying
[372.12 - 377.34] you have no idea what's in there and
[375.54 - 379.44] what's going on and what's going wrong
[377.34 - 381.84] basically
[379.44 - 383.58] you're just being ripped off or fooled
[381.84 - 385.68] or taken advantage of and that's what
[383.58 - 388.20] it's like in the supplement world
[385.68 - 389.94] that's how it works so let's cut into it
[388.20 - 393.54] a little bit
[389.94 - 398.16] I am going to take a look here okay for
[393.54 - 399.72] a second now this is a propolis right
[398.16 - 402.72] here
[399.72 - 405.92] see I got the brand marked off this is a
[402.72 - 405.92] propolis right here
[407.10 - 412.56] now
[408.72 - 414.90] this propolis does not say it has
[412.56 - 417.36] alcohol in it
[414.90 - 419.40] it does not say it has alcohol in it
[417.36 - 421.08] keep that in mind so if you're somebody
[419.40 - 422.34] that's into propolis this looks like a
[421.08 - 425.04] great company it looked like a great
[422.34 - 430.04] brand it's in the store it's out there
[425.04 - 434.22] you purchase it you don't know
[430.04 - 436.80] but it has alcohol in it when it says it
[434.22 - 440.66] doesn't when there isn't alcohol on the
[436.80 - 440.66] label now I opened this up
[442.32 - 446.82] and it smells like
[444.66 - 448.44] I'm at a bar
[446.82 - 449.94] that's how much alcohol is in this
[448.44 - 453.00] propolis
[449.94 - 455.82] it smells like this is a shot of whiskey
[453.00 - 457.56] that's what it smells like I opened it
[455.82 - 460.50] up
[457.56 - 462.60] and it smells like straight grain
[460.50 - 465.18] alcohol
[462.60 - 467.40] but you would never know that
[465.18 - 470.70] there are propolises that say alcohol
[467.40 - 472.80] free but still have alcohol in it
[470.70 - 474.12] and that's something to know all on its
[472.80 - 476.58] own
[474.12 - 478.68] so there's propolises out there that say
[476.58 - 481.14] alcohol free but still have alcohol in
[478.68 - 484.68] it this is a propolis that no one would
[481.14 - 486.78] ever know has alcohol in it
[484.68 - 488.58] they would never know because they'd be
[486.78 - 490.56] like wait this doesn't have all the
[488.58 - 493.86] ingredient says
[490.56 - 495.66] is glycerin and water
[493.86 - 499.40] it's all it says
[495.66 - 499.40] there's so much alcohol in here
[499.50 - 504.54] you can get like
[501.42 - 506.58] Tipsy just breathing that in and that's
[504.54 - 507.91] how propolises are out there
[506.58 - 509.04] that's an example
[507.91 - 511.86] [Music]
[509.04 - 514.56] here's a propolis right here from a very
[511.86 - 516.48] well-known company a company that's in
[514.56 - 518.04] every store a company that's out there
[516.48 - 521.22] everywhere
[518.04 - 522.84] okay this is in a tincture bottle if you
[521.22 - 524.34] go into the health food store if you go
[522.84 - 526.44] anywhere you go into Whole Foods there's
[524.34 - 529.86] a whole section and this is a tincture
[526.44 - 533.64] within that section not saying the brand
[529.86 - 536.04] and this one says it has alcohol in it
[533.64 - 538.08] it's a propolis that actually says it
[536.04 - 541.26] has alcohol so at least you know it has
[538.08 - 543.42] alcohol in it but here is the amazing
[541.26 - 546.72] part of this one you'll see this
[543.42 - 549.56] propolis ready so this says it has
[546.72 - 549.56] alcohol in it
[554.34 - 557.82] which you don't want so if you guys are
[556.08 - 560.34] confused at what I'm saying
[557.82 - 563.34] the vemergy propolis pure does not have
[560.34 - 564.42] alcohol in it hidden in it doesn't have
[563.34 - 568.80] it hidden
[564.42 - 571.14] right but this is a propolis right here
[568.80 - 572.64] from a company from a brand that's in
[571.14 - 576.00] Whole Foods or any other food health
[572.64 - 578.58] food store everywhere across the land
[576.00 - 580.38] it has alcohol in this propolis
[578.58 - 583.26] a lot of it
[580.38 - 585.84] it's cane sugar alcohol though but it's
[583.26 - 587.46] cane sugar alcohol and then you'll
[585.84 - 590.48] notice something about this propolisa
[587.46 - 590.48] this is important to see
[591.84 - 595.04] see how dark it is
[595.80 - 600.78] take a look how dark it is
[598.74 - 604.28] propolis
[600.78 - 604.28] should never be dark
[604.32 - 608.22] now you might think well maybe that's a
[606.36 - 610.02] good thing you're getting a lot of it or
[608.22 - 612.60] something or you're getting you know
[610.02 - 615.24] there's a lot of propolis there's resin
[612.60 - 618.60] what you're seeing right here
[615.24 - 622.08] is burnt propolis
[618.60 - 624.30] that's what you're saying burnt resin
[622.08 - 626.22] it's useless
[624.30 - 628.44] so if you went into the health food
[626.22 - 631.02] store and you wanted to buy propolis and
[628.44 - 634.16] you just bought a bottle of propolis and
[631.02 - 634.16] it was dark like this
[634.20 - 637.28] that's burnt
[637.86 - 642.00] it's destroyed
[640.68 - 644.94] that's what you're looking at right
[642.00 - 646.68] there see this
[644.94 - 648.78] this is going to be highly educational
[646.68 - 650.34] episode right here I think it's
[648.78 - 652.08] important that people know the truth of
[650.34 - 654.84] what's going on because I think I had it
[652.08 - 657.54] up to here actually with all the BS out
[654.84 - 658.68] there to the degree that it is and
[657.54 - 661.20] people who don't know what they're
[658.68 - 663.42] talking about but what that is
[661.20 - 664.56] is burnt propolis now here's another
[663.42 - 667.02] thing you're looking at with this
[664.56 - 670.02] propolis now this is a very well-known
[667.02 - 672.48] brand that people have high respect for
[670.02 - 674.52] out there get ready for this
[672.48 - 676.86] guess what else you're seeing you're
[674.52 - 680.46] seeing impurities
[676.86 - 684.24] you're seeing impurities from a single
[680.46 - 684.24] pass extraction
[685.02 - 689.10] this is going to be mind-blowing
[687.66 - 691.32] you might want to watch this episode
[689.10 - 695.10] over again to be honest
[691.32 - 697.86] this is single pass extraction what that
[695.10 - 702.60] mean it means is heavy metals
[697.86 - 704.76] impurities garbage and junk
[702.60 - 706.08] is all still in there
[704.76 - 707.34] so you go out there and you buy a
[706.08 - 709.20] propolis and it looks like a dark
[707.34 - 710.70] propolis and you're like oh my God that
[709.20 - 713.64] looks pretty good first of all there's
[710.70 - 716.58] alcohol even when they say there isn't
[713.64 - 719.40] alcohol even when this one says there's
[716.58 - 723.30] no alcohol and you actually open this up
[719.40 - 725.34] and it is literally an alcohol
[723.30 - 727.98] like
[725.34 - 730.62] an alcoholic drink
[727.98 - 732.78] like if you drink that
[730.62 - 735.28] you'd be like boom
[732.78 - 737.64] it hit you like a shot of whiskey
[735.28 - 740.10] [Music]
[737.64 - 744.36] so what you're seeing here
[740.10 - 749.28] is dark propolis dark propolis is burnt
[744.36 - 752.78] dark propolis is harboring impurities
[749.28 - 756.78] lots of them metals
[752.78 - 758.40] beeswax not the healthy stuff all
[756.78 - 762.24] impurities
[758.40 - 764.22] is going on in there so it is
[762.24 - 766.44] filled with a whole bunch of different
[764.22 - 769.92] stuff and junk that it shouldn't have
[766.44 - 773.34] it's called single pass extraction
[769.92 - 774.90] now when you're dealing with vermergy
[773.34 - 778.26] propolis pure
[774.90 - 780.42] you're looking at multi extraction
[778.26 - 782.46] technology
[780.42 - 783.96] that's the difference right there guess
[782.46 - 785.40] what I don't care who puts out of
[783.96 - 787.62] propolis out there I don't care who's
[785.40 - 789.24] doing what with the propolis
[787.62 - 791.40] I highly doubt it's going to be
[789.24 - 794.70] multi-extraction technology
[791.40 - 797.46] highly highly doubted and that's the
[794.70 - 801.98] difference right there so that's the
[797.46 - 801.98] Imaging now propolis here we are okay
[804.30 - 811.26] all right and you'll take a look at this
[806.16 - 813.60] golden golden color right here
[811.26 - 816.30] see if you can see this I know I might
[813.60 - 818.28] not be as close but
[816.30 - 821.52] take a look right here
[818.28 - 825.48] okay it's the golden color you see that
[821.52 - 829.44] that's from multi extraction technology
[825.48 - 832.50] it's leaving the bioactives leaving all
[829.44 - 835.32] the bioactives but separating the
[832.50 - 836.70] impurities separating the junk and the
[835.32 - 839.10] garbage that I was talking about that's
[836.70 - 841.10] in the other propolises this is so
[839.10 - 845.34] important to know
[841.10 - 847.46] propolis shouldn't be dark it shouldn't
[845.34 - 852.00] be dark brown it shouldn't be black
[847.46 - 856.08] that's single pass extraction that means
[852.00 - 858.42] it's missing the extraction process is
[856.08 - 861.56] missing it's letting all the impurities
[858.42 - 865.14] go by it's letting all the toxins go by
[861.56 - 867.54] and this right here and the reason why
[865.14 - 869.16] people say this propolis is like a
[867.54 - 871.44] miracle for their health a miracle for
[869.16 - 873.18] them and works like nothing else for so
[871.44 - 877.32] many things and reasons in their health
[873.18 - 879.96] this is like a god-given miracle to have
[877.32 - 881.70] this right now on the planet to have
[879.96 - 884.16] this type of propolis because it doesn't
[881.70 - 886.32] exist with the other companies it just
[884.16 - 887.58] doesn't exist Juliet over there on
[886.32 - 890.64] YouTube says
[887.58 - 892.92] the vimorgy propolis cleared 16 ulcers
[890.64 - 895.86] from my mouth it was the only thing that
[892.92 - 898.98] worked you're not the only one I I heard
[895.86 - 900.24] or hear out there say what it does for
[898.98 - 903.36] ulcers in the mouth
[900.24 - 905.46] it's unbelievable what it does
[903.36 - 907.98] and so I'm showing you right here a
[905.46 - 910.68] god-given miracle in the supplement
[907.98 - 912.78] realm right here which is the propolis
[910.68 - 915.60] now if you just got on here you just got
[912.78 - 918.30] to know that beverage is giving a free
[915.60 - 921.06] bottle of propolis away and a free
[918.30 - 923.58] bottle of lemon balm away with 200 order
[921.06 - 926.94] of emergy.com
[923.58 - 930.36] so Julie over there in IG says provolas
[926.94 - 933.36] healed a cold sore in two days
[930.36 - 933.36] OMG
[933.48 - 937.20] it's that incredible now take a look at
[935.58 - 939.84] the difference ready I'm going to keep
[937.20 - 942.96] on putting more in here so this is the
[939.84 - 946.92] golden extract right there it's called
[942.96 - 949.26] multi extraction technology
[946.92 - 951.36] peace and veggies says propolis pure by
[949.26 - 955.32] vimorigi has healed my mouth thank you
[951.36 - 958.08] vimergy and guess what
[955.32 - 960.96] just think about that think about like
[958.08 - 962.52] what that is what that even is how
[960.96 - 964.76] incredible that is
[962.52 - 967.14] so
[964.76 - 970.32] all right so I wanted to show you that
[967.14 - 973.32] there's so much to talk about you guys
[970.32 - 974.94] so let's get into it a little bit deeper
[973.32 - 977.46] let's talk about this a little bit more
[974.94 - 979.38] I'm very excited right now
[977.46 - 982.20] for a lot of reasons
[979.38 - 984.66] Renata 144 says over there on YouTube aw
[982.20 - 986.40] there are people who buy alcohol-based
[984.66 - 989.40] subs and believe they can burn the
[986.40 - 991.74] alcohol off of it by cooking it not sure
[989.40 - 993.78] can you please speak to that to clarify
[991.74 - 996.18] for the community I talk about that in
[993.78 - 998.10] medical medium books by the way and yes
[996.18 - 1001.10] you can't get rid of the alcohol by
[998.10 - 1003.20] heating it up doesn't work the residue
[1001.10 - 1005.96] of the alcohol is still there the herbs
[1003.20 - 1008.78] are still damaged alcohol damages the
[1005.96 - 1011.98] herbs so it destroys them very important
[1008.78 - 1014.90] to know alcohol and tinctures
[1011.98 - 1017.12] annihilates the phytochemical compounds
[1014.90 - 1020.06] the things that we need the bioactives
[1017.12 - 1021.62] it injures them so even if you're
[1020.06 - 1023.36] somebody like well I'll burn off some of
[1021.62 - 1026.18] the alcohol somehow by heating it up
[1023.36 - 1028.28] basically what that means is you have to
[1026.18 - 1030.62] get such a heat to burn off the alcohol
[1028.28 - 1033.74] where you have to light it basically on
[1030.62 - 1036.14] fire so you have to go super hot
[1033.74 - 1037.94] super hot to try to burn the alcohol out
[1036.14 - 1039.86] of those alcoholic tinctures if you're
[1037.94 - 1041.92] going that hot you've just destroyed
[1039.86 - 1044.50] your herbal tincture you just destroyed
[1041.92 - 1046.94] the constituents the phytochemical
[1044.50 - 1049.76] compounds the bioactives you just
[1046.94 - 1053.42] completely annihilated that by being
[1049.76 - 1055.40] fooled and tricked by being told you can
[1053.42 - 1057.44] burn it off and then you'll be fine
[1055.40 - 1059.60] these are the mistakes made out there
[1057.44 - 1062.06] but that's the problem and that's why
[1059.60 - 1064.52] people don't heal because all of these
[1062.06 - 1066.32] checks and balances aren't there people
[1064.52 - 1069.14] are in the dark they don't know what's
[1066.32 - 1071.36] going on with their products and healing
[1069.14 - 1073.70] and things they need or detoxing or
[1071.36 - 1076.64] what's not detoxing and what is they
[1073.70 - 1078.86] have no idea and all of this including
[1076.64 - 1081.56] things like yeah using supplements out
[1078.86 - 1084.92] with alcohol can slow down healing and
[1081.56 - 1087.68] it even reverse healing so alcohol in
[1084.92 - 1088.94] products even can reverse healing so
[1087.68 - 1090.68] you're somebody that's trying to heal
[1088.94 - 1092.84] you you think you're doing something
[1090.68 - 1093.74] good for yourself and you're taking all
[1092.84 - 1096.26] these supplements without alcohol
[1093.74 - 1099.02] calling them and you're going backwards
[1096.26 - 1100.58] because of it that's that's how it works
[1099.02 - 1102.56] so
[1100.58 - 1103.76] mind-blowing information let's go a
[1102.56 - 1106.22] little deeper
[1103.76 - 1108.56] so I just showed you a propolis
[1106.22 - 1111.08] that's dark
[1108.56 - 1113.78] and I showed you why because the
[1111.08 - 1116.84] propolis is burnt
[1113.78 - 1118.34] that's why not just burnt
[1116.84 - 1120.38] but also
[1118.34 - 1121.76] it's got all the impurities in there too
[1120.38 - 1123.74] now you're looking at the difference
[1121.76 - 1125.96] right there
[1123.74 - 1127.52] you're seeing right here the propolis
[1125.96 - 1129.56] pure
[1127.52 - 1132.44] with the multi-extraction technology
[1129.56 - 1134.30] what that means is it takes out
[1132.44 - 1136.88] impurities
[1134.30 - 1139.88] but leaves the bioactives
[1136.88 - 1142.34] the other propolis is out there single
[1139.88 - 1143.66] pass extraction they let all the garbage
[1142.34 - 1146.24] pass through
[1143.66 - 1148.34] it hinders the bioactives
[1146.24 - 1151.40] so we got that right there critical to
[1148.34 - 1154.16] know if you guys just got on there on
[1151.40 - 1156.50] here if you buy a hundred dollars
[1154.16 - 1158.12] of supplements from vimergy.com and the
[1156.50 - 1161.24] link is in description you get a free
[1158.12 - 1163.40] almost four ounce bottle of the lemon
[1161.24 - 1164.90] balm which is incredible for the nervous
[1163.40 - 1167.72] system
[1164.90 - 1169.82] if you buy two hundred dollars of
[1167.72 - 1172.76] supplements of energy.com
[1169.82 - 1174.22] you get a free almost four ounce bottle
[1172.76 - 1178.46] of propolis pure
[1174.22 - 1180.92] and a free bottle of lemon balm so you
[1178.46 - 1183.40] get that immune system Helper and you
[1180.92 - 1188.30] get that nervous system helper
[1183.40 - 1190.58] 71 dollars free product I don't see
[1188.30 - 1192.92] other companies doing this out there I
[1190.58 - 1195.62] just don't see it especially the quality
[1192.92 - 1197.30] here we're talking about Dr Fawn said he
[1195.62 - 1200.66] is absolutely plugging the product
[1197.30 - 1204.02] because it works my patient used it
[1200.66 - 1206.00] topically to heal his rashes when the
[1204.02 - 1209.06] prescriptions from the dermatologist
[1206.00 - 1211.78] never work thank you Dr fun
[1209.06 - 1214.16] so it's important to know something okay
[1211.78 - 1215.96] there are ways to do plugs for
[1214.16 - 1218.54] supplements and things like that there
[1215.96 - 1221.54] are ways to do different stuff but in
[1218.54 - 1224.42] this situation here I'm showing you how
[1221.54 - 1226.34] incredible and how different the
[1224.42 - 1227.42] vermergy products are compared to what's
[1226.34 - 1229.76] out there
[1227.42 - 1232.40] because I see it all day long I see
[1229.76 - 1234.26] people getting propolis out there that's
[1232.40 - 1236.96] filled with alcohol
[1234.26 - 1238.82] or it's burnt or it's got all the
[1236.96 - 1240.98] impurities and it's got all three it's
[1238.82 - 1244.46] burnt impurities and has alcohol in it
[1240.98 - 1247.34] and it's a shame it's truly a sin it's
[1244.46 - 1248.60] really a shame and nobody knows it and
[1247.34 - 1250.46] they're just walking around blind
[1248.60 - 1251.90] they're ripped off no one's telling them
[1250.46 - 1253.46] anything and they're not moving
[1251.90 - 1257.06] themselves forward the healing process
[1253.46 - 1259.46] now that's just the Stark truth and it's
[1257.06 - 1261.44] critical for people to know and yeah I
[1259.46 - 1263.12] support vimergy and for these reasons
[1261.44 - 1265.52] because that doesn't exist with other
[1263.12 - 1267.08] companies so yes I'm gonna plug them and
[1265.52 - 1268.40] I'm going to talk about them and I'm
[1267.08 - 1270.74] going to share this information it's
[1268.40 - 1271.82] critical Dr Sherry green over there on
[1270.74 - 1275.30] IG
[1271.82 - 1278.48] propolis pure is phenomenal for so many
[1275.30 - 1282.02] conditions love it for my patients
[1278.48 - 1283.52] so I'm on the propolis pure talk I want
[1282.02 - 1286.64] to get into that a little bit it's a
[1283.52 - 1289.10] multi- extraction technology to separate
[1286.64 - 1290.54] the undesirable compounds critical to
[1289.10 - 1293.66] know
[1290.54 - 1296.48] that's a big deal all on its own
[1293.66 - 1298.64] so it removes it's a removal system of
[1296.48 - 1299.72] unwanted purities like toxic heavy
[1298.64 - 1302.66] metals and all these other different
[1299.72 - 1303.74] things that's what's so great about that
[1302.66 - 1306.26] process
[1303.74 - 1309.52] these propolises and there's plenty of
[1306.26 - 1312.20] them out there I've literally probably
[1309.52 - 1314.96] purchased almost every single propolis
[1312.20 - 1317.18] that is out there at least every one
[1314.96 - 1318.14] that's popular everyone that's on the
[1317.18 - 1320.42] Shelf
[1318.14 - 1322.34] and I've gone through them all
[1320.42 - 1323.54] and they're loaded with junk and garbage
[1322.34 - 1324.74] they're either burnt they got the
[1323.54 - 1326.54] impurities
[1324.74 - 1328.58] or they're just loaded with alcohol and
[1326.54 - 1329.84] the thing is is there's alcohol in all
[1328.58 - 1331.34] the propolises out there and maybe
[1329.84 - 1333.14] there's one that might not have it but
[1331.34 - 1335.24] here's the trick the ones that say they
[1333.14 - 1337.88] don't have it still have the alcohol in
[1335.24 - 1339.98] it hidden ingredients
[1337.88 - 1341.66] and alcohol is one of the hidden
[1339.98 - 1345.74] ingredients they also hide natural
[1341.66 - 1347.36] flavors now they hide preservatives they
[1345.74 - 1350.66] hide all that stuff so let's go into
[1347.36 - 1354.02] lemon balm a little bit
[1350.66 - 1356.30] move these aside right
[1354.02 - 1360.64] the not good propolis so moving that
[1356.30 - 1360.64] over all right let's hit the lemon balm
[1361.04 - 1366.40] so let's go into this a little bit so I
[1363.80 - 1368.84] have a lemon balm that's very popular
[1366.40 - 1370.64] here it is in my hand
[1368.84 - 1372.50] I bet you a bunch of people even
[1370.64 - 1374.84] watching this or that are going to watch
[1372.50 - 1377.12] this have this lemon balm they don't
[1374.84 - 1379.64] know the brand but I'm sure they have it
[1377.12 - 1381.26] it's a very popular brand and most
[1379.64 - 1383.36] people buy this they just go into the
[1381.26 - 1385.52] store and they buy this brand so this is
[1383.36 - 1386.66] a lemon balm right here
[1385.52 - 1391.52] okay
[1386.66 - 1393.86] so this lemon balm is a three to one
[1391.52 - 1395.42] a three to one
[1393.86 - 1398.54] keep that in mind
[1395.42 - 1401.78] that that's its strength it's three to
[1398.54 - 1404.36] one okay you'll see this one's dark
[1401.78 - 1406.22] but lemon balm
[1404.36 - 1409.52] should be dark
[1406.22 - 1411.56] it should be keep that in mind but this
[1409.52 - 1415.10] is going to blow your mind
[1411.56 - 1418.46] lemon balm should be dark
[1415.10 - 1420.50] because of the herb itself
[1418.46 - 1422.30] so as you can see
[1420.50 - 1426.14] I put the dark
[1422.30 - 1428.96] Herb in here
[1426.14 - 1431.66] but that's three to one
[1428.96 - 1434.72] it shouldn't be that dark
[1431.66 - 1437.72] and that's scary
[1434.72 - 1441.20] gotta think about that for a minute
[1437.72 - 1443.78] it shouldn't be that dark
[1441.20 - 1445.76] why is it that dark
[1443.78 - 1448.22] hidden ingredients
[1445.76 - 1450.50] hidden impurities
[1448.22 - 1452.66] very important to know
[1450.50 - 1456.34] and I'm gonna go into depth about this
[1452.66 - 1456.34] on on the lemon balm front okay
[1459.20 - 1465.14] so it's memory lemon balm right there
[1461.78 - 1467.66] it's supposed to be dark
[1465.14 - 1469.34] keep that in mind
[1467.66 - 1471.70] and you're probably like well what's he
[1469.34 - 1471.70] saying
[1472.22 - 1477.94] remember she
[1473.60 - 1477.94] lemon balm is ten to one
[1479.18 - 1484.84] ten to one
[1481.40 - 1484.84] think about that strength difference
[1485.78 - 1488.74] so let's go into this
[1491.36 - 1498.52] lemon balm is supposed to be dark
[1494.84 - 1498.52] and here's that brand
[1501.32 - 1505.52] look how dark it is
[1503.36 - 1508.10] but it's three to one
[1505.52 - 1510.56] it's not supposed to be that dark
[1508.10 - 1513.56] it's supposed to be a lot lighter than
[1510.56 - 1517.12] beverages ten to one
[1513.56 - 1517.12] which is really high potency
[1517.28 - 1521.96] if your mind isn't blown
[1519.80 - 1524.12] I don't know what to say I don't know
[1521.96 - 1526.82] what else I can do
[1524.12 - 1528.38] this is a really important piece of
[1526.82 - 1529.76] information right here in the supplement
[1528.38 - 1531.92] world
[1529.76 - 1533.84] and yes I'm the only one talking about
[1531.92 - 1536.06] this out there
[1533.84 - 1537.86] the only one and I noticed the
[1536.06 - 1539.36] supplement companies and the influencers
[1537.86 - 1540.44] that work for supplement companies and
[1539.36 - 1542.60] all that stuff
[1540.44 - 1544.88] they won't go near any of this kind of
[1542.60 - 1546.26] talk because their companies are guilty
[1544.88 - 1549.50] of so much
[1546.26 - 1551.48] they won't go near any of this
[1549.50 - 1552.56] very important and it's also why I'm
[1551.48 - 1555.14] hated
[1552.56 - 1558.74] by competitors out there
[1555.14 - 1561.74] they hate how incredible all this is and
[1558.74 - 1562.64] how it shows them up so take a look once
[1561.74 - 1564.50] again
[1562.64 - 1565.52] I'm going to take the popular company
[1564.50 - 1567.92] and
[1565.52 - 1570.68] it's like this all around
[1567.92 - 1573.14] I purchased so many lemon bombs from the
[1570.68 - 1576.58] best companies so called out there
[1573.14 - 1576.58] so ready here we go
[1579.74 - 1583.10] that's the lemon balm from a popular
[1581.60 - 1587.06] company and you guys are watching how
[1583.10 - 1589.40] dark that is but what is mind-blowing
[1587.06 - 1591.44] is that's a three to one ratio which
[1589.40 - 1596.98] isn't that strong
[1591.44 - 1596.98] then what the hell is in there
[1599.36 - 1604.28] that is the question hidden additives
[1602.54 - 1607.94] hidden ingredients that are not
[1604.28 - 1609.92] disclosed junk and impurities what the
[1607.94 - 1611.96] hell is in there
[1609.92 - 1614.60] okay
[1611.96 - 1617.48] very important to know because this is
[1614.60 - 1620.18] the vimorges
[1617.48 - 1623.20] that's the vimorges
[1620.18 - 1623.20] lemon balm
[1623.60 - 1626.86] it's not as dark
[1627.32 - 1632.12] but
[1629.24 - 1633.68] it's ten to one
[1632.12 - 1636.50] stronger
[1633.68 - 1638.72] this is three to one
[1636.50 - 1641.32] do you see how dark that is and this is
[1638.72 - 1641.32] ten to one
[1641.60 - 1646.52] look at that
[1644.24 - 1648.62] that's less impurities less additives
[1646.52 - 1650.78] less junk
[1648.62 - 1653.06] whatever's in here
[1650.78 - 1655.34] is scary
[1653.06 - 1656.54] because a three to one can never be that
[1655.34 - 1657.86] dark do you guys know what I'm talking
[1656.54 - 1659.96] about
[1657.86 - 1662.18] so yeah all the lemon balm tinctures out
[1659.96 - 1663.68] there and all the new companies putting
[1662.18 - 1665.54] out lemon bombs because they they
[1663.68 - 1668.08] because it got trendy because of medical
[1665.54 - 1668.08] medium
[1668.18 - 1671.90] it's like this and I'm going to show you
[1670.22 - 1673.76] another version of lemon balm that's
[1671.90 - 1675.32] lighter and it's scary for a whole
[1673.76 - 1676.34] nother reason so I can't wait to show
[1675.32 - 1679.30] you that
[1676.34 - 1679.30] so here we go
[1682.04 - 1688.22] so that's the difference right there
[1685.22 - 1688.22] okay
[1688.34 - 1694.34] next let's go into another aspect of it
[1690.92 - 1695.84] so that's a lemon balm right there
[1694.34 - 1698.00] all right
[1695.84 - 1700.84] here's a lemon balm a different lemon
[1698.00 - 1700.84] balm right here
[1704.06 - 1706.48] okay
[1706.88 - 1710.66] all right
[1708.26 - 1713.54] this is a lemon balm that tells you
[1710.66 - 1715.58] nothing it doesn't tell you it's a three
[1713.54 - 1717.98] to one it doesn't tell you it's in
[1715.58 - 1720.68] anything it doesn't tell you
[1717.98 - 1723.62] how many milligrams it doesn't tell you
[1720.68 - 1725.24] anything this is a lemon balm that
[1723.62 - 1727.16] someone will go out and buy because it's
[1725.24 - 1727.88] a popular brand it's out there on the
[1727.16 - 1729.38] Shelf
[1727.88 - 1730.94] and they'll buy it thinking they're
[1729.38 - 1733.34] getting themselves better I heard lemon
[1730.94 - 1735.62] balms good for medical medium I heard it
[1733.34 - 1737.42] does all this and all that he talks
[1735.62 - 1740.36] about it in his book let me go to the
[1737.42 - 1743.54] store let me buy a lemon balm and then
[1740.36 - 1746.80] they buy one take a look at this lemon
[1743.54 - 1746.80] balm is supposed to be dark
[1747.20 - 1750.16] that's not dark
[1751.10 - 1755.84] now that's scary all in its own
[1753.80 - 1759.40] what does that mean
[1755.84 - 1759.40] that means this company
[1760.58 - 1766.76] is doing something who only knows
[1764.18 - 1768.38] it's either they have so very little
[1766.76 - 1770.66] lemon bomb and someone's being ripped
[1768.38 - 1774.26] off so everybody buying this lemon balm
[1770.66 - 1777.56] tincture that I won't show you the brand
[1774.26 - 1781.58] they're being ripped off look at that
[1777.56 - 1784.30] do you see it's supposed to be dark
[1781.58 - 1784.30] but yet
[1785.12 - 1791.60] unlike this one which is really dark
[1788.78 - 1794.90] this isn't supposed to be that dark
[1791.60 - 1797.66] because this is just a three to one
[1794.90 - 1801.92] so this one here is
[1797.66 - 1804.50] spooky this one here is spooky
[1801.92 - 1807.92] because lemon balm tincture is supposed
[1804.50 - 1811.10] to be dark but this is golden
[1807.92 - 1814.40] and on the bottle it doesn't tell you
[1811.10 - 1816.98] to what degree of lemon balm is actually
[1814.40 - 1820.82] in there so that's anything from
[1816.98 - 1823.16] impurities hidden ingredients to very
[1820.82 - 1825.50] little lemon balm
[1823.16 - 1827.30] someone takes it they don't see a result
[1825.50 - 1829.40] and now they're not getting better
[1827.30 - 1830.90] someone takes it they don't see any
[1829.40 - 1832.76] improvements they don't see anything
[1830.90 - 1835.96] happening or changing
[1832.76 - 1835.96] and they don't get better
[1836.66 - 1839.96] fly on the wall if I only was a fly on
[1839.18 - 1842.84] the wall
[1839.96 - 1845.84] in everybody's house and saw all the
[1842.84 - 1848.00] mistakes all the tricks all the rip-offs
[1845.84 - 1850.52] it's just unbelievable
[1848.00 - 1853.16] so over there on YouTube
[1850.52 - 1855.08] Edie says can you speak to the fact that
[1853.16 - 1858.04] bemidji's products
[1855.08 - 1862.64] formally contained alcohol in years past
[1858.04 - 1865.94] huh beverages products never contained
[1862.64 - 1868.22] alcohol and any years passed since the
[1865.94 - 1870.92] Inception of that company to this very
[1868.22 - 1875.14] day that's false information and that's
[1870.92 - 1875.14] how rumors are started purposely
[1877.28 - 1881.72] and that's sad because that's what's
[1879.80 - 1883.58] happening right now and there is an
[1881.72 - 1886.52] attack on Bemidji because of the quality
[1883.58 - 1889.64] being so good because it's unbelievable
[1886.52 - 1891.38] stuff it's god-given in my opinion from
[1889.64 - 1894.80] what I've seen
[1891.38 - 1896.30] and it's that incredible and companies
[1894.80 - 1898.88] can't keep up with it they can't match
[1896.30 - 1902.36] it they can't on any level
[1898.88 - 1905.84] and that's why there's so much trouble
[1902.36 - 1907.22] out there with rumors and and fals
[1905.84 - 1908.72] cities and all of that all right so
[1907.22 - 1910.46] let's go into this a little bit deeper
[1908.72 - 1911.24] now with some other stuff so I showed
[1910.46 - 1914.44] you
[1911.24 - 1917.06] the lemon mom with the light color
[1914.44 - 1919.46] brand a lot of people have it in their
[1917.06 - 1920.60] cupboard I can guarantee so many people
[1919.46 - 1922.70] have it
[1920.60 - 1924.56] it's light because there's hardly any
[1922.70 - 1927.86] lemon balm and there's something else in
[1924.56 - 1929.72] here instead which is really sad
[1927.86 - 1933.92] here's the dark lemon balm but it's
[1929.72 - 1936.44] three to one but it's pitch dark which
[1933.92 - 1939.32] means something's wrong here
[1936.44 - 1941.66] it's not supposed to be that dark it
[1939.32 - 1943.40] means a lot of impurities a lot of junk
[1941.66 - 1945.80] and garbage in there and then the
[1943.40 - 1947.72] propolises with the alcohol the
[1945.80 - 1950.60] propolises that say they're alcohol free
[1947.72 - 1952.46] but they're not alcohol free how are
[1950.60 - 1954.20] they allowed to do this they just are
[1952.46 - 1957.32] and that's how the supplement World
[1954.20 - 1959.66] Works anybody can basically put out
[1957.32 - 1961.76] almost anything without checks and
[1959.66 - 1964.16] balances so that's important to
[1961.76 - 1966.92] understand all on its own there is so
[1964.16 - 1969.56] much alcohol in these propolises this
[1966.92 - 1973.30] one is off the charts you smell it and
[1969.56 - 1975.62] you can get drunk that's how insanely
[1973.30 - 1977.00] entrenched in alcohol that that
[1975.62 - 1979.16] supplement is
[1977.00 - 1982.70] it's insane
[1979.16 - 1984.62] so I just want to go over a couple of
[1982.70 - 1986.06] different cool things here about all of
[1984.62 - 1987.68] this because this is important so let me
[1986.06 - 1990.56] just remind everybody a hundred dollars
[1987.68 - 1992.18] of energy product if you purchase a
[1990.56 - 1994.52] hundred dollars of energy product you
[1992.18 - 1995.68] get a free almost four ounces of lemon
[1994.52 - 1998.06] balm
[1995.68 - 1999.86] nervous system
[1998.06 - 2003.46] nervous system
[1999.86 - 2005.80] so good and if you purchase two hundred
[2003.46 - 2008.14] dollars at vimergy.com link is in
[2005.80 - 2010.36] description link is in the profile you
[2008.14 - 2014.38] get a free almost four ounce bottle of
[2010.36 - 2018.34] propolis pure and lemon balm which is
[2014.38 - 2021.10] mind-blowing 71 dollars
[2018.34 - 2022.96] right there take advantage of this stuff
[2021.10 - 2025.78] when it happens like this take advantage
[2022.96 - 2028.06] of those kinds of sales those kinds of
[2025.78 - 2030.16] offers that are out there but you got to
[2028.06 - 2032.44] use the code go to imagery.com check out
[2030.16 - 2035.68] the code that's something I could stand
[2032.44 - 2037.78] behind it's a company I can stand behind
[2035.68 - 2040.36] because of what they do and their
[2037.78 - 2043.18] process so I want to remind people
[2040.36 - 2046.60] I'll go deeper into this so propolis
[2043.18 - 2048.64] pure contains over 50 percent of the
[2046.60 - 2050.32] bioactives
[2048.64 - 2053.62] it's critical to know that the
[2050.32 - 2056.98] polyphenols over 50 percent active
[2053.62 - 2059.50] bioactive polyphenols like quercetin and
[2056.98 - 2062.44] other polyphenols important to know
[2059.50 - 2065.32] that is part of the multi-extraction
[2062.44 - 2068.86] technology to get rid of impurities but
[2065.32 - 2069.88] preserve the bile actives very important
[2068.86 - 2073.24] to know
[2069.88 - 2075.40] and immune system is critical
[2073.24 - 2077.92] heartlight says there I'm a clinician
[2075.40 - 2080.32] I'm a clinical psychologist
[2077.92 - 2082.90] and the Bemidji supplements are critical
[2080.32 - 2085.62] for mental health as well amazing over
[2082.90 - 2085.62] there on IG
[2086.62 - 2091.78] I think what happens is that people
[2088.00 - 2093.46] don't realize when they invest into
[2091.78 - 2095.80] something that they're using on their
[2093.46 - 2097.66] body or inside their body they don't
[2095.80 - 2099.82] know really what's going on there
[2097.66 - 2103.06] because there was a law passed that
[2099.82 - 2104.68] allows companies to not disclose they
[2103.06 - 2106.66] don't have to disclose hidden
[2104.68 - 2107.86] ingredients a certain percentage of
[2106.66 - 2110.14] hidden ingredients in their
[2107.86 - 2113.80] supplementation
[2110.14 - 2116.20] and no one talks about this
[2113.80 - 2118.54] I'm the only one I've seen out there
[2116.20 - 2119.74] talking about this the reason why is
[2118.54 - 2121.72] because
[2119.74 - 2123.46] supplement companies and influencers
[2121.72 - 2125.80] that either own supplement companies are
[2123.46 - 2127.96] starting their own supplement companies
[2125.80 - 2130.24] they're not going to say oh we don't we
[2127.96 - 2132.22] don't have hidden you know percentages
[2130.24 - 2134.32] and they're not going to say that
[2132.22 - 2135.76] because what they do is if you have a
[2134.32 - 2137.86] bunch of money you can go start a
[2135.76 - 2140.26] supplement company tomorrow if you had a
[2137.86 - 2142.42] bunch of money you can go and say okay I
[2140.26 - 2144.28] will go to this manufacturing place they
[2142.42 - 2145.96] will put it together for me I want this
[2144.28 - 2148.90] this
[2145.96 - 2150.82] you know and they put it together and
[2148.90 - 2153.10] they don't have they don't have control
[2150.82 - 2155.38] over the hidden ingredients that are in
[2153.10 - 2157.72] there they don't know how to say hey
[2155.38 - 2159.82] don't put that in ours don't put that in
[2157.72 - 2161.02] this company make sure you do this make
[2159.82 - 2163.12] sure you do that look for the highest
[2161.02 - 2165.76] quality they don't do that it's kind of
[2163.12 - 2167.62] like they just Stamp Out supplements for
[2165.76 - 2169.90] influencers these days that want to
[2167.62 - 2172.48] start companies tomorrow and they stamp
[2169.90 - 2175.72] it out is what they do as long as that
[2172.48 - 2178.24] influencer is wealthy rich or has a
[2175.72 - 2179.56] bunch of money or something somehow and
[2178.24 - 2182.32] they want to start their supplement
[2179.56 - 2184.12] company they just literally oh it's just
[2182.32 - 2186.42] like it's like clothing brands you can
[2184.12 - 2189.10] go and get your clothing lines made
[2186.42 - 2190.66] right to what's out there to what the
[2189.10 - 2191.92] the clothing manufacturers be like all
[2190.66 - 2193.24] right we'll put your name on it we'll
[2191.92 - 2195.40] put the name of your company on and
[2193.24 - 2197.32] we'll put it out there
[2195.40 - 2199.30] but people don't realize in the
[2197.32 - 2201.48] supplement world they're filled with all
[2199.30 - 2203.92] these impurities hidden ingredients
[2201.48 - 2205.48] undisclosed ingredients
[2203.92 - 2208.98] and that's what's happening out there
[2205.48 - 2208.98] and it's really sad
[2209.08 - 2212.86] so
[2210.46 - 2214.66] it's important to know how it works I
[2212.86 - 2217.60] want to go into propolis a little bit I
[2214.66 - 2221.02] think really that it deserves and flim
[2217.60 - 2223.62] bum it deserves a spotlight
[2221.02 - 2223.62] so
[2224.44 - 2229.60] one of the major problems people suffer
[2226.90 - 2231.76] with is immune system issues
[2229.60 - 2233.44] anybody who's got an autoimmune
[2231.76 - 2235.54] diagnosis or any kind of other problem
[2233.44 - 2237.46] anything going on with their immune
[2235.54 - 2239.92] system any kind of symptoms they're
[2237.46 - 2243.30] struggling immune system wise
[2239.92 - 2243.30] and that's important to know
[2243.34 - 2249.46] and so what I like about propolis it's
[2245.56 - 2251.86] one of these Miracles that we have on
[2249.46 - 2253.54] this planet that supports the immune
[2251.86 - 2256.48] system
[2253.54 - 2257.68] and so it's critical you have the purest
[2256.48 - 2260.26] kind
[2257.68 - 2262.30] out there that you can find
[2260.26 - 2265.06] to actually help
[2262.30 - 2267.10] support the immune system
[2265.06 - 2268.72] and that's a big deal so we're up
[2267.10 - 2270.46] against all kinds of exposures out there
[2268.72 - 2273.16] every day we're up against all kinds of
[2270.46 - 2275.22] pathogens we're up against all kinds of
[2273.16 - 2280.12] different impurities different toxins
[2275.22 - 2282.52] and the more load we have on us
[2280.12 - 2285.16] the more our immune system has to kill
[2282.52 - 2287.56] itself to clean it up
[2285.16 - 2289.42] so we take our immune systems for
[2287.56 - 2291.34] granted without realizing it many of us
[2289.42 - 2293.92] take take our immune systems for granted
[2291.34 - 2296.92] and don't realize that our immune cells
[2293.92 - 2299.68] are these garbage eaters
[2296.92 - 2302.02] inside our body so they're there to go
[2299.68 - 2303.52] after pathogens and eat up pathogens our
[2302.02 - 2306.82] immune cells are there to go after
[2303.52 - 2310.36] impurities and garbage and junk
[2306.82 - 2312.04] and to eat it up chemicals metals and
[2310.36 - 2315.22] everything else our immune cells are
[2312.04 - 2318.82] there to eat these things
[2315.22 - 2321.22] so that these things don't affect us as
[2318.82 - 2324.52] much or so bad
[2321.22 - 2326.98] and so what I like about propolis is it
[2324.52 - 2328.90] supports the immune system feeds the
[2326.98 - 2330.70] immune system
[2328.90 - 2332.44] and that's critical if someone's
[2330.70 - 2335.32] actually struggling with anything that's
[2332.44 - 2337.48] why it deserves a spotlight
[2335.32 - 2341.94] and propolis was
[2337.48 - 2345.64] just kind of like this Niche obscure
[2341.94 - 2349.00] novelty thing and people did not know
[2345.64 - 2350.56] really what it does how good it is how
[2349.00 - 2353.76] supportive it is
[2350.56 - 2353.76] in the health movement
[2353.98 - 2357.64] Tara says I've tried so many supplements
[2356.08 - 2359.98] over the years most of them actually
[2357.64 - 2361.48] made my symptoms worse Bemidji
[2359.98 - 2363.40] supplements are incredible and actually
[2361.48 - 2364.96] help me you can really tell the
[2363.40 - 2366.52] difference in quality
[2364.96 - 2368.08] and there is a difference because when
[2366.52 - 2370.60] it comes down to people so many people
[2368.08 - 2373.12] are sensitive they're sensitive for a
[2370.60 - 2374.68] lot of reasons
[2373.12 - 2376.90] and
[2374.68 - 2379.36] if they do take supplements that have
[2376.90 - 2381.58] alcohol in them and natural flavors
[2379.36 - 2383.86] and all kinds of different toxic toxic
[2381.58 - 2385.48] additives and they don't you know it's
[2383.86 - 2387.10] in there and they don't know it and
[2385.48 - 2390.64] they're taking these supplements they'll
[2387.10 - 2392.08] instantly blame the herb or what the
[2390.64 - 2394.54] name of it is
[2392.08 - 2396.82] so if they take a toxic lemon balm and
[2394.54 - 2399.16] there's so many of them out there
[2396.82 - 2401.20] and they take a lemon balm that has
[2399.16 - 2402.94] alcohol in it or a lemon balm that has
[2401.20 - 2404.26] natural flavors or a lemon balm that has
[2402.94 - 2406.12] all this other junk and garbage or
[2404.26 - 2407.80] hidden ingredients and they take it and
[2406.12 - 2409.84] they're like well it's not working it's
[2407.80 - 2412.54] not helping me in fact I feel a little
[2409.84 - 2415.00] bit sensitive it's because of everything
[2412.54 - 2418.24] that's in there that shouldn't be in
[2415.00 - 2419.80] there that they don't know is in there
[2418.24 - 2421.78] so
[2419.80 - 2423.94] um by the way what I normally do with
[2421.78 - 2427.18] beverages lemon balm is I take a dropper
[2423.94 - 2429.58] full and I put it right here
[2427.18 - 2433.00] in some water and some honey
[2429.58 - 2434.92] so that's how I usually do
[2433.00 - 2436.90] this is actually a big mug right here
[2434.92 - 2439.66] that's usually how I do like my lemon
[2436.90 - 2443.62] balm tea now is I take
[2439.66 - 2445.90] the lemon balm now this is an important
[2443.62 - 2449.08] um important piece of information about
[2445.90 - 2450.82] the lemon balm it's ten to one so you
[2449.08 - 2452.92] got to think about it if you pick lemon
[2450.82 - 2454.66] balm out of your garden if you pick it
[2452.92 - 2456.28] out by hand
[2454.66 - 2458.50] and you just get your lemon balm out of
[2456.28 - 2460.18] the garden and you dry it
[2458.50 - 2462.64] and you have a portion of that lemon
[2460.18 - 2466.26] balm like a whole bunch of dried lemon
[2462.64 - 2466.26] balm leaves that's one
[2466.66 - 2472.42] that's one
[2468.10 - 2474.94] ten to one is ten of those
[2472.42 - 2478.38] so that's important to know ten of one
[2474.94 - 2483.28] ten of ten to one is ten of those
[2478.38 - 2484.30] handfuls of herbs and that ten to one is
[2483.28 - 2487.92] in here
[2484.30 - 2487.92] right in the dropper
[2491.02 - 2495.10] this one here
[2493.60 - 2496.60] with the hidden ingredients and the
[2495.10 - 2499.36] impurities
[2496.60 - 2503.56] is a three to one
[2499.36 - 2505.80] so it's only three of these instead of
[2503.56 - 2505.80] ten
[2506.74 - 2509.74] all right so
[2508.36 - 2511.66] um I'm gonna take a little sip here and
[2509.74 - 2514.00] we'll keep on going a little bit because
[2511.66 - 2515.20] this is incredible information you're
[2514.00 - 2517.92] growing your own lemon balm that's
[2515.20 - 2521.10] that's incredible
[2517.92 - 2521.10] so good
[2521.98 - 2524.52] okay
[2527.50 - 2532.00] so I think we're people what people
[2529.90 - 2534.58] don't realize
[2532.00 - 2537.16] is they'll hear something out there like
[2534.58 - 2540.34] lemon balm is good
[2537.16 - 2542.56] but they don't know how much more there
[2540.34 - 2545.38] is to learn about it they'll go out and
[2542.56 - 2547.66] they'll buy a lemon balm tincture
[2545.38 - 2550.18] it doesn't work
[2547.66 - 2553.54] and then they move they move on I tried
[2550.18 - 2555.10] lemon balm it did nothing for me and now
[2553.54 - 2556.54] they have that experience and they have
[2555.10 - 2558.40] that reference
[2556.54 - 2559.96] and that reference can travel to
[2558.40 - 2561.88] somebody else
[2559.96 - 2563.92] it's like oh you tried lemon bomb yeah
[2561.88 - 2566.50] it didn't work for me doesn't work I
[2563.92 - 2568.06] tried it and then this next person goes
[2566.50 - 2569.68] oh okay well then I'm not going to try
[2568.06 - 2572.20] it either because
[2569.68 - 2574.18] it didn't work for you so it's probably
[2572.20 - 2576.40] not going to work for me and then that
[2574.18 - 2578.56] person goes and tells another person oh
[2576.40 - 2580.66] you tried lemon yeah no one doesn't work
[2578.56 - 2582.16] I didn't have to try it I just know it
[2580.66 - 2584.14] doesn't work
[2582.16 - 2586.24] and then it goes on Down the Line like
[2584.14 - 2588.46] that meanwhile it all stems from someone
[2586.24 - 2591.40] taking
[2588.46 - 2592.84] an unproductive lemon balm that didn't
[2591.40 - 2594.58] do the trick that didn't help that
[2592.84 - 2597.88] didn't work
[2594.58 - 2601.30] and so this is the problem in the health
[2597.88 - 2602.68] world it's how we can then just go like
[2601.30 - 2603.88] where do we go and then we go to
[2602.68 - 2606.58] something else then we go to something
[2603.88 - 2609.28] else and it's endless I think one of the
[2606.58 - 2611.26] most disheartening parts of the herbal
[2609.28 - 2612.76] tincture world is the alcohol and
[2611.26 - 2617.34] tinctures and I think medical medium
[2612.76 - 2620.32] information really blew that wide open
[2617.34 - 2622.00] where alcohol is avoided in a lot of
[2620.32 - 2623.44] tinctures now because of medical meme
[2622.00 - 2625.36] information
[2623.44 - 2627.10] which leads me to something else I want
[2625.36 - 2629.62] to say
[2627.10 - 2630.46] wondering Wishin says I tried an organic
[2629.62 - 2632.80] sink
[2630.46 - 2634.84] when first starting medical medium after
[2632.80 - 2635.86] four days I stopped it made me feel
[2634.84 - 2638.38] worse
[2635.86 - 2640.60] after aw talked about supplement quality
[2638.38 - 2643.90] I tried memories Inc and wow and it was
[2640.60 - 2646.90] a game changer can change everything I
[2643.90 - 2649.48] remember back in the day liquid sinks
[2646.90 - 2651.76] with so much citrus acid and there still
[2649.48 - 2653.44] is liquid zincs with so much citric acid
[2651.76 - 2655.18] in there which is also hidden in a lot
[2653.44 - 2657.34] of um the tinctures hidden in the
[2655.18 - 2659.80] supplements citric acid is like in
[2657.34 - 2662.32] everything it's not in memory but it's
[2659.80 - 2665.80] in everything out there and I I recall
[2662.32 - 2668.02] so many people taking zinc the liquid
[2665.80 - 2670.12] zinc from reputable companies on the
[2668.02 - 2671.44] store shelf and they buy it and they
[2670.12 - 2672.28] squirt it in their mouth and they throw
[2671.44 - 2674.08] up
[2672.28 - 2676.42] they just vomit
[2674.08 - 2679.06] just projectile vomit
[2676.42 - 2681.22] it literally turns their stomach in a
[2679.06 - 2683.14] second they get sick and they just puke
[2681.22 - 2684.82] and that's it and that's the reference
[2683.14 - 2686.92] right there with zinc
[2684.82 - 2689.74] from there on out they're just gonna be
[2686.92 - 2691.60] like I can't take zinc meanwhile zinc is
[2689.74 - 2693.58] so critical
[2691.60 - 2695.32] for the healing process and so critical
[2693.58 - 2698.86] for the immune system but that person
[2695.32 - 2701.62] may never actually take a zinc again
[2698.86 - 2704.26] to help them heal and to be one of those
[2701.62 - 2706.00] people where look I just you know and I
[2704.26 - 2707.38] tried zinc it doesn't work and then they
[2706.00 - 2708.94] tell somebody else it doesn't work so I
[2707.38 - 2710.32] want to talk about vimergy as far as
[2708.94 - 2713.98] what they have in here
[2710.32 - 2716.62] they got organic glycerin in their
[2713.98 - 2718.78] tincture bottles
[2716.62 - 2721.96] organic glycerin
[2718.78 - 2723.76] but there's a word next to it
[2721.96 - 2726.34] it's flax
[2723.76 - 2728.26] this is advanced
[2726.34 - 2730.06] this is a big deal
[2728.26 - 2731.50] and this is another reason why I stand
[2730.06 - 2733.54] behind these guys there's so many
[2731.50 - 2735.76] reasons why I stand behind these guys
[2733.54 - 2738.94] you can't touch this stuff other
[2735.76 - 2740.92] companies out there can't touch this
[2738.94 - 2743.80] it's not touchable
[2740.92 - 2747.36] what you'll see is organic glycerin
[2743.80 - 2749.32] and then you'll see the word flax
[2747.36 - 2751.24] f-l-a
[2749.32 - 2753.34] right X
[2751.24 - 2758.38] important to know
[2753.34 - 2760.12] so it's not junk garbage
[2758.38 - 2761.86] glycerin
[2760.12 - 2763.60] so you got two options in the tincture
[2761.86 - 2764.98] world if you want to try to heal and do
[2763.60 - 2766.24] stuff if you want to use Herbal
[2764.98 - 2769.18] tinctures to try to move yourself
[2766.24 - 2770.92] forward get two options it's alcohol or
[2769.18 - 2771.64] glycerin those are your options out
[2770.92 - 2773.44] there
[2771.64 - 2775.42] how he says can all the supplements be
[2773.44 - 2776.98] taken at once that's look that's how I
[2775.42 - 2779.20] do it ask your doctor what's right for
[2776.98 - 2782.08] you Holly but that's what I do
[2779.20 - 2787.00] I'll take them at once
[2782.08 - 2790.30] so there's two options we have
[2787.00 - 2791.74] if you want to look into the supplement
[2790.30 - 2793.72] world
[2791.74 - 2797.46] in the tincture world
[2793.72 - 2800.68] it's alcohol or glycerin
[2797.46 - 2803.58] archangelica says yes I puked from a low
[2800.68 - 2803.58] quality zinc
[2803.92 - 2808.72] you know the sad part is is I hate to
[2807.28 - 2810.70] say this over and over again but I
[2808.72 - 2812.56] talked about this many years ago how
[2810.70 - 2814.12] people puke from their low quality zincs
[2812.56 - 2816.04] but nobody talked about it was like a
[2814.12 - 2818.92] hidden dirty Secret
[2816.04 - 2822.60] Rosie said yes several zincs gave me
[2818.92 - 2822.60] gave many nausea
[2822.94 - 2826.84] so
[2824.44 - 2829.12] Lindsay says all other zinc Brands I've
[2826.84 - 2831.58] tried made me feel super nauseous and
[2829.12 - 2834.34] sick memories Inc is the only one I can
[2831.58 - 2838.26] take and feel fine
[2834.34 - 2838.26] that says so much
[2838.84 - 2843.64] so I just want to say back to this and
[2840.88 - 2846.04] Jackie says I now keep lemon balm in my
[2843.64 - 2848.68] purse for anxiety I tell people keep it
[2846.04 - 2850.36] in their purse keep it in their bag keep
[2848.68 - 2852.88] it in their car keep it at their office
[2850.36 - 2856.18] keep it in the kitchen keep a bottle
[2852.88 - 2859.12] wherever you can if you order a 200
[2856.18 - 2860.98] order at vimergy.com you get a free
[2859.12 - 2862.96] lemon balm almost four ounce bottle
[2860.98 - 2868.36] lemon balm and a free almost four ounce
[2862.96 - 2869.98] bottle a propolis pure 71 dollars a free
[2868.36 - 2871.72] product
[2869.98 - 2874.48] that's insane I don't know how they do
[2871.72 - 2878.02] it Christina says I have used zinc since
[2874.48 - 2881.56] 2011 for my alopecia and they always
[2878.02 - 2883.72] made me so what a bar face it was it
[2881.56 - 2885.94] wasn't before vimorgy zinc that I did
[2883.72 - 2888.34] not get that vimergy zinc is the best
[2885.94 - 2889.60] one out there used it in the past four
[2888.34 - 2891.88] years now
[2889.60 - 2895.02] incredible so I want to go back to the
[2891.88 - 2895.02] glycerin process
[2895.42 - 2898.84] if you're going to take any tinctures at
[2897.16 - 2900.46] all if you're going to go to anybody and
[2898.84 - 2901.66] take tinctures if you're going to buy
[2900.46 - 2903.04] anything out there if you're going to
[2901.66 - 2904.90] talk to an herbalist if you're going to
[2903.04 - 2907.24] talk to a brand new supplement company
[2904.90 - 2909.82] that just put out some tinctures
[2907.24 - 2912.40] you got two options
[2909.82 - 2915.24] glycerin
[2912.40 - 2915.24] or alcohol
[2915.28 - 2919.48] both are bad
[2917.26 - 2922.18] unless the glycerin
[2919.48 - 2925.00] is flax because chances are it's going
[2922.18 - 2928.18] to be a really low quality glycerin
[2925.00 - 2930.28] that's not flax
[2928.18 - 2931.48] you don't even know where it is and what
[2930.28 - 2933.40] it is I mean you don't know what it's
[2931.48 - 2935.32] dry from or where it comes from and
[2933.40 - 2936.70] that's the problem even when talking to
[2935.32 - 2939.58] supplement companies be like well what's
[2936.70 - 2941.74] your glycerin made from whatever
[2939.58 - 2942.88] they'll still kind of have this like
[2941.74 - 2945.88] spew
[2942.88 - 2948.76] but in the end it's bulk glycerin
[2945.88 - 2950.26] and you don't know really the true story
[2948.76 - 2952.60] behind it
[2950.26 - 2955.84] and when I take the Bemidji supplements
[2952.60 - 2958.36] I know this organic glycerin is flax
[2955.84 - 2960.82] derived and that right there gives me a
[2958.36 - 2962.92] good night's sleep all on its own that's
[2960.82 - 2965.56] a big deal I don't see that out there
[2962.92 - 2968.92] and that's huge all on its own you guys
[2965.56 - 2971.26] I mean seriously
[2968.92 - 2973.12] it's just incredible
[2971.26 - 2974.80] it really is
[2973.12 - 2976.24] so I wanted to run those things by you
[2974.80 - 2979.24] guys to let you know that there's a sale
[2976.24 - 2980.98] right now vermergy.com it's really a
[2979.24 - 2982.78] giveaway I don't know what to call it
[2980.98 - 2985.72] it's a giveaway
[2982.78 - 2988.84] it's they're giving away 71 dollars of
[2985.72 - 2991.42] product for a 200 order
[2988.84 - 2993.70] and it's the propolis pure and the lemon
[2991.42 - 2997.42] balm and if you want like I tell people
[2993.70 - 3000.50] you don't have to know everything about
[2997.42 - 3002.70] your healing process or everything about
[3000.50 - 3005.28] products in the world you don't have to
[3002.70 - 3008.10] know everything but you got to know at
[3005.28 - 3009.42] least the foundations and what I see out
[3008.10 - 3011.04] there is people don't know the
[3009.42 - 3013.08] foundations

[3081.84 - 3087.12] their life they got a lot going on and
[3084.30 - 3089.58] it's hard to learn everything it's hard
[3087.12 - 3091.26] to learn a lot of things because you're
[3089.58 - 3092.88] multitasking you've got a lot of
[3091.26 - 3095.76] responsibilities there's so much being
[3092.88 - 3099.32] asked of everybody in life right so what
[3095.76 - 3099.32] I do is I simplify it
[3099.60 - 3104.22] nervous system I don't even call lemon
[3102.18 - 3106.32] bomb lemon balm I call it central
[3104.22 - 3108.36] nervous system
[3106.32 - 3111.72] that's what I call it
[3108.36 - 3113.88] so I changed the name of lemon balm
[3111.72 - 3117.30] in my head
[3113.88 - 3118.74] in my life in my mind and then propolis
[3117.30 - 3120.24] I don't even call it propolis anymore I
[3118.74 - 3121.80] call it immune system
[3120.24 - 3123.96] I mean that's what I call it of course
[3121.80 - 3126.18] this is just propolis and it's not your
[3123.96 - 3127.74] immune system isn't in that bottle but I
[3126.18 - 3130.14] call it immune system and that's what I
[3127.74 - 3133.62] do it's these simple things too that
[3130.14 - 3135.78] like they they just remind you of what
[3133.62 - 3138.36] you're doing for yourself
[3135.78 - 3141.36] and that's a big big deal too it's the
[3138.36 - 3143.16] connection of it like I'm helping my
[3141.36 - 3146.46] nervous system
[3143.16 - 3148.98] that connection alone is so powerful I'm

[3166.26 - 3171.36] supplements from Bemidji at least know
[3168.84 - 3173.46] what all of this is what I showed you
[3171.36 - 3175.02] here if you just came on board watch
[3173.46 - 3176.82] this from the beginning and get your
[3175.02 - 3179.40] mind blown
[3176.82 - 3181.32] crispy perspective on YouTube I just
[3179.40 - 3183.90] took all my beverages supplements first
[3181.32 - 3186.78] day of my menstrual cycle so need all
[3183.90 - 3188.82] the immune support I can get never liked
[3186.78 - 3192.06] taking any supplements and never can
[3188.82 - 3193.50] take it daily until memory
[3192.06 - 3196.80] because
[3193.50 - 3198.84] all those impurities and and added added
[3196.80 - 3203.46] ingredients that people don't know about
[3198.84 - 3205.62] that are added undisclosed not disclosed
[3203.46 - 3207.06] all of that and then the quality
[3205.62 - 3210.18] difference
[3207.06 - 3214.02] you know I hate that word quality I hate
[3210.18 - 3217.80] that word quality because everybody uses
[3214.02 - 3221.10] it when they don't have quality
[3217.80 - 3222.66] or their quality is low but they don't
[3221.10 - 3225.36] have to say low like supplement
[3222.66 - 3228.30] companies can say quality we choose
[3225.36 - 3230.46] quality from the finest places
[3228.30 - 3232.14] but really the quality they're choosing
[3230.46 - 3233.40] is low quality they don't have to say
[3232.14 - 3235.62] low quality
[3233.40 - 3237.00] it's insane Julie Tuesday over there on

[3320.34 - 3327.00] process just always be easy on yourself
[3323.88 - 3329.58] just realize it can take some time for
[3327.00 - 3332.58] so many people so many people
[3329.58 - 3336.06] have a lot of compromises a lot of
[3332.58 - 3339.12] exposures it takes time but keep in mind
[3336.06 - 3341.94] like in the medical medium books
[3339.12 - 3344.76] you can take your healing as far as you
[3341.94 - 3346.68] need to go always know that it's there
[3344.76 - 3349.50] it's not just
[3346.68 - 3351.84] like you try one little thing and that
[3349.50 - 3355.38] was it it's there for you to keep on
[3351.84 - 3357.06] moving forward the information is there
[3355.38 - 3358.92] and just know that you know pat yourself
[3357.06 - 3360.24] on the back know that your body loves
[3358.92 - 3363.00] you unconditionally and don't let
[3360.24 - 3366.12] anybody tell you that your immune system
[3363.00 - 3370.38] is attacking your body your organs
[3366.12 - 3373.44] just let them tell you but that's not
[3370.38 - 3376.20] accurate it's misinformation it's been
[3373.44 - 3379.50] happening since the 1950s
[3376.20 - 3382.68] misinformation literally since the 1950s
[3379.50 - 3387.48] our body's immune system does not attack
[3382.68 - 3389.58] organs it does not attack ourselves
[3387.48 - 3392.28] it doesn't attack
[3389.58 - 3395.94] our body our glands our immune system
[3392.28 - 3397.50] goes after pathogens and Invaders and
[3395.94 - 3399.12] that's what's happening and then
[3397.50 - 3402.84] pathogens
[3399.12 - 3405.42] and Invaders are what inflames us that's
[3402.84 - 3408.06] what goes after our organs and glands
[3405.42 - 3409.74] so if you're somebody that's you know
[3408.06 - 3411.30] coming into a place where like what's
[3409.74 - 3412.74] going on my body's just destroying
[3411.30 - 3415.80] itself my body's immune system is
[3412.74 - 3418.98] attacking itself that's so outdated old
[3415.80 - 3421.14] crap misinformation was never
[3418.98 - 3425.46] scientifically proven ever under a
[3421.14 - 3427.80] microscope it was nothing but a theory
[3425.46 - 3429.84] keep that in mind
[3427.80 - 3431.70] but it's important to know that our
[3429.84 - 3433.62] bodies love us and unconditionally and
[3431.70 - 3435.78] they look out for us and we just have to
[3433.62 - 3437.52] give our bodies what it needs we have to
[3435.78 - 3439.02] support our bodies so our bodies can
[3437.52 - 3440.58] actually do what they need to do our
[3439.02 - 3442.62] immune system can do what it needs to do
[3440.58 - 3445.10] and that's a big part of the healing
[3442.62 - 3445.10] process
[3445.44 - 3451.14] something always to remember that your
[3448.14 - 3454.02] body isn't faulty it's not letting you
[3451.14 - 3456.06] down it's not turning against you you
[3454.02 - 3460.20] don't have a bad body you don't have a
[3456.06 - 3463.86] faulty body you're not a bad person
[3460.20 - 3465.78] so always remember that your body isn't
[3463.86 - 3467.46] kicking your legs out from underneath
[3465.78 - 3470.22] you it's not pulling the carpet from
[3467.46 - 3472.38] underneath you it's not purposely trying
[3470.22 - 3474.90] to take you down your body is actually
