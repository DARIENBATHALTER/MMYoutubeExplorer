1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,520
this is really heartbreaking right here

2
00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:07,639
okay this is what happens when people

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:10,639
don't pay attention and they run over

4
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:12,519
tortoises and run over Turtles the prime

5
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:16,240
example is why I try to save them every

6
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:18,520
single day when I'm out and about and I

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,560
have to get this this this guy right

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:23,279
here to a Wildlife Reserve if possible

9
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,800
I've already called one of

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:31,119
them and uh nobody seemed to care so I

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:34,320
have to call another one um but

12
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:38,160
I have to get this guy the right the

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,879
right things he needs and to protect him

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,760
because this is this is just this is

15
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:43,840
Criminal really this is Criminal I know

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,039
people have accidents I know that they

17
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,760
they do this by mistake a lot of people

18
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:50,280
don't do it my by mistake they don't

19
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,440
care they they have a disregard for

20
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,960
animal life and they just run over

21
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,000
tortoises and turtles and and they

22
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,000
actually make a game of it I see it out

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,719
there all the time and it's sick and

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,360
it's delusional and um Despicable

25
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:08,560
actually so this guy right here

26
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,720
definitely going to put him in a box get

27
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,360
him to a reserve somewhere and try to

28
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,320
get him help because uh even though his

29
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:20,439
survival rate

30
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:23,200
is possibly you know possibly not not

31
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:25,680
going to be what we wanted to be um his

32
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,680
back legs are are partially

33
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,439
paralyzed but we have to do something

34
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,040
about it so I'm going to work on that

35
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:35,560

41
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:51,719
Rush up to a place that we care for um

42
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:55,000
but here he is right here he's

43
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:58,439
struggling he was run over looks like a

44
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,039
few hours ago the blood is drying on his

45
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:04,399
back um

46
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:06,719
truly heartbreaking truly truly

47
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,640
heartbreaking anyway I'm just going to

48
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:14,640
get working on trying to get this guy

49
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:18,599
some attention immediately so signing

50
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,800
off so I've already called four places

51
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:25,840
waiting for responses I'm about to

52
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:28,480
travel a distance as well but

53
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,720
um but I want them to just be

54
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,120
comfortable walk on the grass a little

55
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,040
bit while I'm waiting for a response

56
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,680
from somewhere but this is what what

57
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:41,400
happens with Wildlife rescues you may

58
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,680
not hear from them for a day or two but

59
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,640
we just do the best we can and I'll have

60
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,360
to be traveling a long distance and just

61
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:50,720
searching so probably going to spend the

62
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:53,360
next day maybe the next two days if he

63
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,640
stays alive which you know God willing I

64
00:02:53,360 --> 00:03:00,040
hope hope he does

65
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,640
so still on hold called eight emergency

66
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,360
places Wildlife uh preserves and so

67
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,680
forth still

68
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,920
waiting um I just want to say this guy

69
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,239
this is killing me at this point I'm

70
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:16,840
hard I'm actually hard sick and

71
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:20,360
um but he's got a lot of energy and a

72
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,319
lot of strength left uh so has been

73
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:25,319
talking to

74
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:27,319
me um and I've been getting any kind of

75
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:31,680
guidance from

76
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:34,480
SSC um and so I'm on hold now I'm hoping

77
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,200
that that this is that this is going to

78
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,840
be

79
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,799
fruitful and um but I'm just trying to

80
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:44,640

um I want this to be a good

84
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:58,439
experience where as much as he suffering

85
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:03,120

86
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:03,120
