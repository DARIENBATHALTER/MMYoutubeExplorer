[102.08 - 104.64] mono eating cleanse
[103.44 - 106.16] you're still going to need your celery

[146.72 - 150.48] so the mono eating cleanse that's it
[148.80 - 151.52] right there see i got little postage
[150.48 - 154.00] notes right there
[151.52 - 155.20] too good to see you guys coming on happy
[154.00 - 157.92] about that
[155.20 - 159.04] so you guys can do a couple of different
[157.92 - 160.40] options in here there's
[159.04 - 162.16] and i'm going to give you just the
[160.40 - 162.88] rundown right here right off the running
[162.16 - 165.84] okay
[162.88 - 166.32] you can do a banana mono eating cleanse
[165.84 - 169.04] with
[166.32 - 170.80] optional lettuce because lettuce should
[169.04 - 172.40] be in there and banana and i'll talk
[170.80 - 175.84] about what else we can do
[172.40 - 177.20] papaya is a moderating cleanse too if
[175.84 - 178.72] you can get a hold of papayas then you
[177.20 - 181.84] could just do papaya
[178.72 - 184.40] banana and papaya is optional
[181.84 - 185.60] so both so if you want to do banana and
[184.40 - 187.20] papaya
[185.60 - 188.72] and then you have your lettuce that's
[187.20 - 192.24] the other option there
[188.72 - 195.44] steamed potatoes is an option
[192.24 - 198.00] with lettuce okay steamed
[195.44 - 199.36] peas is another option so steamed peas a
[198.00 - 200.88] lot of people they can't get a hold of
[199.36 - 202.56] potatoes or they can't get a hold of
[200.88 - 204.48] papaya they can't get all the banana
[202.56 - 207.04] then you got the steamed peas
[204.48 - 208.24] right then there's an option where you
[207.04 - 210.48] do steamed
[208.24 - 212.56] winter squash you guys see the butternut
[210.48 - 215.12] squash right here
[212.56 - 215.92] but you can do the steamed winter squash
[215.12 - 218.08] and then
[215.92 - 219.76] pick some green beans or some brussels
[218.08 - 221.76] sprouts or some asparagus
[219.76 - 223.04] for the end of the day as well and have
[221.76 - 225.12] that with your lettuce so
[223.04 - 226.40] that's another option there too so you
[225.12 - 227.92] have all these now there's people that
[226.40 - 229.52] are saying well hey can i do watermelon
[227.92 - 231.60] yeah you can do watermelon
[229.52 - 233.52] but the whole thing with watermelon is
[231.60 - 234.80] you better be doing your celery juice
[233.52 - 236.64] you can't just say hey
[234.80 - 237.92] i'm gonna do watermelon for the next
[236.64 - 239.92] three days
[237.92 - 241.84] and not do your celery juice you need
[239.92 - 243.52] those mineral salts or you're gonna just
[241.84 - 245.76] you're gonna hit that place where
[243.52 - 247.68] boom you're basically just doing a juice
[245.76 - 250.32] fast that's all that is
[247.68 - 252.00] because watermelon doesn't have enough
[250.32 - 254.40] calories
[252.00 - 256.56] to sustain without all of a sudden
[254.40 - 258.16] making it where you want to break or
[256.56 - 260.16] you've got to have the celery juice in
[258.16 - 262.16] there if you go that route
[260.16 - 263.36] and so and if you're doing the
[262.16 - 265.44] watermelon
[263.36 - 266.48] version right that's the one you pick
[265.44 - 268.32] because some people are like i love
[266.48 - 269.04] watermelon it's watermelon season where
[268.32 - 270.72] i am
[269.04 - 272.40] let me do that you've got to be doing
[270.72 - 274.40] your celery juice
[272.40 - 276.00] you should be bringing in some lettuce
[274.40 - 278.08] okay so
[276.00 - 279.52] if you don't mind some lettuce in there
[278.08 - 281.68] bring in some lettuce
[279.52 - 283.44] okay and you don't want to do it term
[281.68 - 285.20] the mono eating cleanse
[283.44 - 286.72] has been designed from spirit of
[285.20 - 289.92] compassion to do long
[286.72 - 290.88] term if you would like long term if you
[289.92 - 294.88] want

[477.36 - 482.24] they got you know like the the
[480.24 - 486.96] inflammation inside the

[509.36 - 514.16] so a lot of people that use it including
[512.24 - 515.76] hives right including hives because it's
[514.16 - 517.12] the liver being junky and everything but
[515.76 - 519.04] a lot of people use the mono-eating
[517.12 - 522.00] cleanse to save their butt
[519.04 - 523.92] to heal and recover they're kind of
[522.00 - 525.76] sensitive so they're not doing much of
[523.92 - 526.64] anything else so they just keep it the
[525.76 - 528.96] monolith
[526.64 - 531.20] you want to bring in a heavy metal detox
[528.96 - 533.44] bring it in after a few days
[531.20 - 535.20] bring it after a few days that's all do
[533.44 - 536.96] the mono eating cleanse without it just
[535.20 - 539.36] for a few days
[536.96 - 540.80] why not if you really don't want to lose
[539.36 - 543.28] the mud if you don't really don't want
[540.80 - 545.52] to lose the heavy metal detox smoothie
[543.28 - 546.80] keep it in keep it in but that's going
[545.52 - 549.04] to be your own
[546.80 - 550.48] version right i mean not you meaning
[549.04 - 553.04] like your own little
[550.48 - 554.88] kind of customizing you're customizing
[553.04 - 556.80] the medical medium tools
[554.88 - 558.16] so if you want to be if you want to be
[556.80 - 559.84] that person you said like i still want
[558.16 - 561.92] to do my heavy metal detox movie but
[559.84 - 562.72] still want to do the mono eating cleanse
[561.92 - 566.40] okay
[562.72 - 568.08] we can we can hybridize it
[566.40 - 570.64] customize it that's what you're doing
[568.08 - 572.80] you're customizing it your way right
[570.64 - 574.48] so i'm going to use this medical medium
[572.80 - 577.20] tool the heavy metal detox smoothie
[574.48 - 577.68] and i'm going to use this medical medium
[577.20 - 580.80] tool
[577.68 - 581.68] some mono eating and that's what you're
[580.80 - 583.44] going to do
[581.68 - 585.28] but depending on the person what's going
[583.44 - 586.80] on you know you may get different
[585.28 - 588.88] results that's why the monoleading
[586.80 - 589.60] cleanse is designed a certain way for
[588.88 - 591.28] certain gut
[589.60 - 592.72] problems but yes you could do the heavy
[591.28 - 595.60] metal detox smoothie question
[592.72 - 597.52] answered yes yes yes another question
[595.60 - 599.20] was the watermelon answer that one yes
[597.52 - 601.04] you can do that that's going to be a nut
[599.20 - 603.20] you're doing a medical medium tool
[601.04 - 604.32] and a medical medium tool you know and
[603.20 - 605.92] that's what you're doing
[604.32 - 607.04] you're doing the celery juice you got to
[605.92 - 608.08] do the celery juice you're going to play
[607.04 - 610.32] with watermelon
[608.08 - 611.68] for those few days you got to do the
[610.32 - 612.56] celery just while you're playing with
[611.68 - 615.28] watermelon
[612.56 - 617.68] and you might want to think about still
[615.28 - 619.68] having some butter leaf lettuce
[617.68 - 621.68] instead of just doing all watermelon all
[619.68 - 623.92] watermelon all watermelon
[621.68 - 625.68] okay you've got to have enough of the
[623.92 - 628.56] mineral salts
[625.68 - 631.04] with that watermelon keep that in mind
[628.56 - 632.16] you have to have the mineral salts with
[631.04 - 633.04] that watermelon if you're going to go
[632.16 - 636.00] that route
[633.04 - 638.24] okay so the bananas look a little
[636.00 - 641.12] browner than normal right but
[638.24 - 641.68] they're not that right they're ripe
[641.12 - 643.84] enough
[641.68 - 644.96] just right what happened is i wash my
[643.84 - 647.92] bananas
[644.96 - 649.36] they just come from the store i'll just
[647.92 - 652.24] oh i'll just wash them
[649.36 - 654.64] is what i do so when you wash bananas
[652.24 - 656.00] the skins on the outsides do this
[654.64 - 657.84] so that's what happens when you wash
[656.00 - 658.48] them i know people they buy them in the
[657.84 - 661.60] store
[658.48 - 663.60] they grab them they crack one open and
[661.60 - 665.84] eat one with their hands
[663.60 - 667.20] and what they don't realize that a whole
[665.84 - 668.64] bunch of people are going through these
[667.20 - 670.00] bananas in this door it's like i don't
[668.64 - 671.44] know if i want that bunch let me put
[670.00 - 671.92] that back i don't know if i want that
[671.44 - 673.76] bunch
[671.92 - 675.12] they're grabbing the carriage there's
[673.76 - 677.92] all kinds of strep and
[675.12 - 680.24] e coli on their hands and all kinds of
[677.92 - 681.60] herpes simplex one on their hands
[680.24 - 683.68] you know for playing with their cold
[681.60 - 684.48] sores or something and there's all kinds
[683.68 - 686.00] of different stuff
[684.48 - 688.00] on their hands all over the place
[686.00 - 689.76] there's feces on shopping carts
[688.00 - 691.28] there's always feces on the handles of
[689.76 - 693.28] shopping carts just you know there's
[691.28 - 696.16] there's always feces on that
[693.28 - 697.20] so when i so so what if i get bananas
[696.16 - 700.00] from the store
[697.20 - 702.80] right and it's not in a case because i
[700.00 - 705.52] like to get a case of bananas this time
[702.80 - 705.92] i didn't get a case of bananas so i got
[705.52 - 709.20] like
[705.92 - 710.64] single bunches so i just gave it a wash
[709.20 - 711.84] that's all so i'm using it because i
[710.64 - 712.40] don't want to put this on my cutting
[711.84 - 714.32] board
[712.40 - 716.40] just right it comes out of the store you
[714.32 - 718.16] put it right on your cutting board
[716.40 - 719.92] i don't want to do that it's not a smart
[718.16 - 721.68] move that's why it's why people just
[719.92 - 723.12] they're like hey i'm doing your stuff
[721.68 - 725.92] and all of a sudden i'll feel good with
[723.12 - 727.52] something i remember over the years but
[725.92 - 729.12] spirit of compassion would be spirit of
[727.52 - 729.60] compassion be like yeah because they
[729.12 - 731.04] just
[729.60 - 733.04] bought stuff through all their
[731.04 - 734.80] containers on their cutting board
[733.04 - 737.12] through all their stuff on their cutting
[734.80 - 737.52] board all kinds of different bugs and
[737.12 - 739.36] things
[737.52 - 741.20] feces from shopping carts and other
[739.36 - 742.88] stuff just all over the stuff
[741.20 - 745.20] and then the other thing too people
[742.88 - 747.04] don't realize in the warehouses
[745.20 - 748.56] where all the grocery products are
[747.04 - 751.12] there's rats running through
[748.56 - 753.04] all the grocery stores there's there's
[751.12 - 754.80] rat poison in the corners of grocery
[753.04 - 755.52] stores all the chain grocery store
[754.80 - 757.60] chains
[755.52 - 760.16] there's mice there's roaches there's
[757.60 - 761.84] rats in the warehouses of all the
[760.16 - 763.28] department of groceries doesn't matter
[761.84 - 764.88] what department it is
[763.28 - 766.28] whether it's wheat whether it's produce
[764.88 - 767.60] whether it's whether it's
[766.28 - 771.52] non-perishables
[767.60 - 774.16] whatever it is um you got you got like
[771.52 - 774.64] all that going on so and i've always
[774.16 - 776.24] known
[774.64 - 779.04] that like if you are you're into canned
[776.24 - 781.12] food you want to wash the can off
[779.04 - 782.24] the lid on the can even if the lid on
[781.12 - 783.60] the can looks fine
[782.24 - 785.68] so you got your can of beans or
[783.60 - 786.80] something someone will buy their can of
[785.68 - 788.72] beans or something
[786.80 - 790.32] they'll buy the can of beans and then
[788.72 - 793.36] you don't know it but there's rat
[790.32 - 795.36] there's rat feces that you can't see on
[793.36 - 796.80] top of the can
[795.36 - 798.00] people don't realize this so that's why
[796.80 - 799.04] i just like keeping things a little
[798.00 - 802.48] cleaner
[799.04 - 804.56] ja nina says uh the cleanse was help my
[802.48 - 807.76] cleanse was helping me so much
[804.56 - 810.08] as i have great gut problems
[807.76 - 812.24] yeah the mono eating cleanse great for
[810.08 - 813.76] helping out the gut issues
[812.24 - 815.44] if you're somebody that's just new to
[813.76 - 816.80] this you're new to the medical medium
[815.44 - 818.00] information you're new to the medical
[816.80 - 821.20] medium books
[818.00 - 824.40] this is a book to have right here
[821.20 - 826.16] uh and this is a book to have for this
[824.40 - 827.20] kind of thing that i'm doing doing the
[826.16 - 830.24] mono eating cleanse
[827.20 - 831.52] challenge i'm challenging myself i love
[830.24 - 832.96] that right
[831.52 - 834.56] there's a question that comes up all the
[832.96 - 835.92] time in sweet potatoes can i use sweet
[834.56 - 838.72] potatoes for the money and cleanse
[835.92 - 839.92] yeah you can you can but there's a
[838.72 - 842.56] reason why
[839.92 - 844.00] when you open the book and you read in
[842.56 - 845.68] here
[844.00 - 848.16] there's a reason why life-saving
[845.68 - 848.80] information is set up in this book like
[848.16 - 850.96] it is
[848.80 - 852.88] and how it heals people the reason why
[850.96 - 853.60] it's not there's all this this stuff
[852.88 - 855.76] isn't like
[853.60 - 856.72] it doesn't say in here mono eating
[855.76 - 859.36] options
[856.72 - 860.72] okay make sure you use sweet potato for
[859.36 - 862.80] a mono eating option
[860.72 - 864.96] doesn't say that doesn't say make sure
[862.80 - 866.40] you eat sweet potato it doesn't say that
[864.96 - 869.76] because i'll tell you why
[866.40 - 872.56] sweet potatoes are a little bit more
[869.76 - 873.60] or a lot more fibrous they have strings
[872.56 - 875.76] in them
[873.60 - 877.20] so sweet potatoes have strings in them
[875.76 - 880.00] so here's the thing
[877.20 - 881.52] say you're somebody with crohn's colitis
[880.00 - 882.08] say you're somebody that's got a lot of
[881.52 - 884.16] gastric
[882.08 - 886.00] problems where you can't even eat
[884.16 - 887.20] anything like you can't even eat
[886.00 - 888.88] anything i have to look out for
[887.20 - 890.48] everybody right look at a lookout for
[888.88 - 893.92] people who are in that condition
[890.48 - 896.24] right and their gut their guts inflamed
[893.92 - 897.84] they got pockets and narrowing in here
[896.24 - 898.96] so they got narrowing problems inside
[897.84 - 901.84] their gut they got
[898.96 - 903.92] pockets inside their gut right sweet
[901.84 - 905.92] potatoes are fine to eat
[903.92 - 907.68] but if you're going to eat large amounts
[905.92 - 909.60] of them or more of them and just eat
[907.68 - 911.28] them every day mono eating
[909.60 - 913.36] they have a lot of strings they have
[911.28 - 914.96] fibrous strings in there you ever see
[913.36 - 916.88] those before in the sweet potatoes
[914.96 - 918.00] when you cut a sweet potato there's
[916.88 - 919.60] there's it's like
[918.00 - 921.44] it's like there's arteries in them you
[919.60 - 923.28] can't see them a lot of them are small
[921.44 - 924.72] you can't see those passageways in the
[923.28 - 926.96] sweet potato
[924.72 - 927.84] well those you know they're they get
[926.96 - 929.76] bulky
[927.84 - 931.52] they get bulky inside the tummy so
[929.76 - 932.80] you've got somebody that can barely eat
[931.52 - 933.60] anything they've got all kinds of
[932.80 - 935.20] problems
[933.60 - 937.52] they're gonna feel the sweet potato a
[935.20 - 939.04] little bit more i want people to get
[937.52 - 940.72] everybody to get a chance to heal yeah
[939.04 - 942.24] sweet potatoes are great to eat it's a
[940.72 - 944.00] great food but
[942.24 - 945.36] but the reason why it's not in here is
[944.00 - 947.44] mono eating cleanse
[945.36 - 948.56] is geared up for people that got some
[947.44 - 952.40] messed up
[948.56 - 953.92] guts messed up guts so what i do is
[952.40 - 956.00] the steamed potatoes the regular
[953.92 - 957.84] potatoes are great
[956.00 - 960.56] they're great for the monolithing if
[957.84 - 963.60] that's the direction you want to go
[960.56 - 967.28] so what i have to say you guys
[963.60 - 969.68] and you can use the red the red potato
[967.28 - 970.56] not sweet or yam but the red potato
[969.68 - 973.52] that's not
[970.56 - 974.40] it's you know it's red or gold or russet
[973.52 - 977.28] right
[974.40 - 978.56] regular potatoes what i got to say is
[977.28 - 980.56] are you prepared
[978.56 - 982.40] what are you going to do are you going
[980.56 - 984.88] to do the banana
[982.40 - 985.84] with lettuce celery juice you can do
[984.88 - 987.12] papaya
[985.84 - 989.28] lettuce and celery juice are you gonna
[987.12 - 991.28] do papaya and banana
[989.28 - 993.12] lettuce and celery juice are you gonna
[991.28 - 995.92] do the steamed potatoes
[993.12 - 996.40] are you gonna do steamed peas as an
[995.92 - 999.12] option
[996.40 - 1002.40] with lettuce celery right are you gonna
[999.12 - 1005.36] do the steamed winter squash
[1002.40 - 1007.04] right that's the butternut right there
[1005.36 - 1010.40] steamed winter squash
[1007.04 - 1014.32] is that what you're gonna do and so
[1010.40 - 1018.16] these are different options right here
[1014.32 - 1019.76] and getting the book is critical
[1018.16 - 1021.60] so you got all the details because the
[1019.76 - 1022.80] questions are gonna crop up once you're
[1021.60 - 1024.00] in this thing you're gonna be like oh my
[1022.80 - 1025.76] god i got a question
[1024.00 - 1027.36] oh my god i got another question let me
[1025.76 - 1029.04] get online and start asking questions
[1027.36 - 1031.60] meanwhile it's right here
[1029.04 - 1033.36] important enough so when we're healing
[1031.60 - 1036.32] the gut food allergies
[1033.36 - 1039.04] difficult difficult gut issues gut
[1036.32 - 1040.32] issues of any kind got problems of any
[1039.04 - 1043.36] kind okay
[1040.32 - 1045.28] people don't know what to eat
[1043.36 - 1046.72] and they run into this whole thing we're
[1045.28 - 1050.24] like what do i eat
[1046.72 - 1052.64] what do i eat what do i eat what do i do
[1050.24 - 1054.08] what like what can i eat and that's
[1052.64 - 1056.00] that's what people run into
[1054.08 - 1057.68] oh i tried that but my stomach's not
[1056.00 - 1059.04] feeling good i tried this but my
[1057.68 - 1060.88] stomach's not feeling good
[1059.04 - 1062.88] i heard this is good for me i heard
[1060.88 - 1065.52] that's good for me and a lot of times
[1062.88 - 1067.44] it's gonna leave people down a path
[1065.52 - 1069.28] of gut destruction because now you're
[1067.44 - 1070.40] going to be dumping gut powders in
[1069.28 - 1072.00] you're going to be trying everything
[1070.40 - 1073.20] you'll be trying bentonite clay then
[1072.00 - 1074.80] you're going to be somebody trying
[1073.20 - 1076.40] charcoal then you're going to be
[1074.80 - 1078.96] somebody trying whey protein because
[1076.40 - 1081.92] you're like i got to get my protein
[1078.96 - 1083.12] and then that protein robot thing kicks
[1081.92 - 1084.72] in i know some of you guys don't like
[1083.12 - 1087.52] when i do the robot
[1084.72 - 1088.88] i know i know that some of you guys
[1087.52 - 1090.56] might like it some of you guys don't
[1088.88 - 1093.76] like it but then the robot
[1090.56 - 1095.36] kicks in selena how about the people who
[1093.76 - 1099.52] eat the bananas
[1095.36 - 1102.00] the peels uh it's not a great
[1099.52 - 1103.92] thing to do there's a tannin in the
[1102.00 - 1105.76] banana peel
[1103.92 - 1108.08] so there's a certain tannin in there and
[1105.76 - 1110.32] you don't want to eat the banana peels
[1108.08 - 1111.20] they don't do a whole lot for us and
[1110.32 - 1113.76] it's something that's
[1111.20 - 1115.92] irritating on the lining really
[1113.76 - 1119.84] irritating on the lining
[1115.92 - 1121.76] and so the whole point is
[1119.84 - 1123.36] you love the robot well you know the
[1121.76 - 1123.84] thing is everybody becomes a protein
[1123.36 - 1125.44] robot
[1123.84 - 1126.88] it's like where do you get your protein
[1125.44 - 1128.24] that's what people are going to be like
[1126.88 - 1129.28] they're like where's your protein though
[1128.24 - 1129.92] so they're like where do you get your
[1129.28 - 1131.20] protein
[1129.92 - 1132.72] where's your protein where's your
[1131.20 - 1133.28] protein where do you get your protein
[1132.72 - 1134.88] protein
[1133.28 - 1137.12] everybody's like the protein robots is
[1134.88 - 1138.16] what they are and uh that's the mini
[1137.12 - 1141.28] robot
[1138.16 - 1142.08] the point is is that everybody's going
[1141.28 - 1144.24] to be like well
[1142.08 - 1145.36] where's mono eating cleanse where's my
[1144.24 - 1146.56] protein that's one thing we're going to
[1145.36 - 1150.08] talk about we'll talk about something
[1146.56 - 1153.68] else as well
[1150.08 - 1157.20] yeah the whole the whole thing is
[1153.68 - 1159.44] about healing some important
[1157.20 - 1161.60] organs in everybody so let's go into
[1159.44 - 1163.92] that for a couple of seconds all right
[1161.60 - 1166.24] let's do that i'm also going to run some
[1163.92 - 1168.24] celery juice i need some for today
[1166.24 - 1170.40] myself let me push this forward a little
[1168.24 - 1170.40] bit
[1171.52 - 1175.60] my buddy here all right
[1176.84 - 1181.76] so here's what happens
[1179.20 - 1182.80] your liver gets dirty it gets stagnant
[1181.76 - 1185.68] it gets
[1182.80 - 1187.76] abused by the industries not by you by
[1185.68 - 1189.36] the industries we get taught to just
[1187.76 - 1190.80] destroy your liver that's what we get
[1189.36 - 1194.32] taught to do
[1190.80 - 1195.36] we get taught to eat so much protein and
[1194.32 - 1198.24] fat
[1195.36 - 1200.32] that we just kill our livers that's what
[1198.24 - 1203.04] we get taught isn't that great
[1200.32 - 1204.32] we're taught that that that's just what
[1203.04 - 1206.24] what happens
[1204.32 - 1207.60] and so the liver gets stagnant sluggish
[1206.24 - 1209.04] it starts to break down
[1207.60 - 1211.60] and then it can't produce the bile it
[1209.04 - 1215.68] needs to produce so the bile reserves
[1211.60 - 1218.64] drop gallbladders get all skanky and bad
[1215.68 - 1218.88] and problematic they get all they get
[1218.64 - 1222.40] all
[1218.88 - 1226.16] toxic the gallbladder gets all toxic
[1222.40 - 1230.00] all filled up with junk right and so
[1226.16 - 1233.36] we start to get like minor versions of
[1230.00 - 1237.68] organ failure as the years go on yeah
[1233.36 - 1239.68] you can have organ failure for 50 years
[1237.68 - 1241.84] you can have organ failure so when
[1239.68 - 1243.68] someone's heart is failing
[1241.84 - 1245.28] they try to keep you alive as long as
[1243.68 - 1248.56] possible they try to keep your heart
[1245.28 - 1250.32] working as long as possible right and
[1248.56 - 1252.72] and you can have you can have heart
[1250.32 - 1254.80] failure for years
[1252.72 - 1256.16] but what people don't realize is organ
[1254.80 - 1258.96] failure is something that just
[1256.16 - 1259.84] lasts for decades and so many people
[1258.96 - 1262.00] it's a liver
[1259.84 - 1263.20] failure that's the organ that that goes
[1262.00 - 1265.60] into this place
[1263.20 - 1266.32] gallbladder failure for years you just
[1265.60 - 1268.64] it's it's
[1266.32 - 1270.96] what's happening is your liver is
[1268.64 - 1272.24] failing to produce the amount of bile it
[1270.96 - 1275.36] needs to break down
[1272.24 - 1278.64] fats your stomach
[1275.36 - 1279.52] is failing to produce the gastric acid
[1278.64 - 1281.68] the hcl
[1279.52 - 1283.68] to break down your proteins and then we
[1281.68 - 1285.84] just fat ourselves to death
[1283.68 - 1287.52] fat ourselves to death protein ourselves
[1285.84 - 1289.60] to death that's what we do
[1287.52 - 1291.36] that's what we do we fat ourselves to
[1289.60 - 1292.80] death and we protein ourselves to death
[1291.36 - 1294.32] hopefully this doesn't fall off right
[1292.80 - 1296.72] now
[1294.32 - 1298.88] so we end up eating all the fat we have
[1296.72 - 1301.36] our fat we fry our eggs in butter
[1298.88 - 1301.92] we do our scrambled eggs and oil
[1301.36 - 1303.04] whatever
[1301.92 - 1304.56] i know that many of you guys are like
[1303.04 - 1305.28] why use coconut oil for my eggs you're
[1304.56 - 1308.00] not
[1305.28 - 1309.92] you're not full in your body man it's
[1308.00 - 1311.28] all the same when it comes down to fat
[1309.92 - 1312.32] even though it's a better fat than
[1311.28 - 1314.72] butter
[1312.32 - 1316.56] and so we just keep on we just fat
[1314.72 - 1317.84] ourselves for years and years and years
[1316.56 - 1320.32] and that's what happens
[1317.84 - 1321.44] you know we have the bagels how many
[1320.32 - 1323.20] guys do bagels
[1321.44 - 1325.60] like how many guys do the bagels cream
[1323.20 - 1326.64] cheese the bagels and different things
[1325.60 - 1330.88] right
[1326.64 - 1332.56] and we do that and overall over time
[1330.88 - 1334.24] we get ourselves in trouble i mean how
[1332.56 - 1335.52] many burgers have you guys had over the
[1334.24 - 1338.96] years right
[1335.52 - 1340.56] okay so we break down our gut we break
[1338.96 - 1342.56] down our gastric system
[1340.56 - 1344.00] we break everything down how many of you
[1342.56 - 1345.36] guys got this in the house right now you
[1344.00 - 1346.16] know what i love about the mono eating
[1345.36 - 1348.80] cleanse
[1346.16 - 1350.16] it's not going to be mono eating eggs
[1348.80 - 1352.64] every now and then somebody like
[1350.16 - 1354.64] well i only eat cheese i only eat eggs
[1352.64 - 1356.16] and i only eat meat so i'm model eating
[1354.64 - 1356.96] cheese eggs and meat and i'm like oh my
[1356.16 - 1358.24] god
[1356.96 - 1360.24] what you're doing is you're killing your
[1358.24 - 1361.92] liver you're killing your
[1360.24 - 1363.36] stomach glands you're killing your
[1361.92 - 1365.84] pancreas
[1363.36 - 1366.64] you're just you're feeding all the bugs
[1365.84 - 1369.76] so
[1366.64 - 1372.64] the point is is that we got some
[1369.76 - 1374.40] things to repair over time and i'm not
[1372.64 - 1376.64] going into all the details
[1374.40 - 1377.92] man i'm not going into all the details
[1376.64 - 1380.72] you guys
[1377.92 - 1381.60] i'm not like the amount of stuff we do
[1380.72 - 1385.04] and take
[1381.60 - 1386.80] that just rips us down inside right
[1385.04 - 1389.44] so the moderating cleanse is a chance to
[1386.80 - 1392.56] recover a chance to come back
[1389.44 - 1394.64] even if you don't know you're down in
[1392.56 - 1396.64] that place where you're hurting
[1394.64 - 1398.00] because you can't sense it yet or feel
[1396.64 - 1399.68] it yet you don't know your liver
[1398.00 - 1400.88] stagnant sluggish yet you don't know
[1399.68 - 1402.08] you're hurting you don't know you got
[1400.88 - 1405.20] problems yet
[1402.08 - 1407.36] right you don't know and so let's talk
[1405.20 - 1409.60] about what the mono eating cleanse does
[1407.36 - 1410.56] one of the things is okay it provides
[1409.60 - 1414.88] protein
[1410.56 - 1417.52] yes bio available protein
[1414.88 - 1418.88] that's what it provides so keep that off
[1417.52 - 1420.48] your worry list
[1418.88 - 1422.00] because people will have that as a worry
[1420.48 - 1425.84] right provides
[1422.00 - 1428.00] omegas yes it does it provides
[1425.84 - 1430.08] phytochemical compounds antioxidants
[1428.00 - 1431.60] antiviral compounds anti-bacterial
[1430.08 - 1434.72] compounds glucose
[1431.60 - 1437.68] mineral salts and that's just
[1434.72 - 1438.64] some of the things it provides important
[1437.68 - 1440.40] to know
[1438.64 - 1442.32] so i want to tell you guys something and
[1440.40 - 1443.12] we get turned into this like protein
[1442.32 - 1446.88] robot
[1443.12 - 1450.00] and we do and here's the funny thing
[1446.88 - 1452.48] protein doesn't kill viruses
[1450.00 - 1453.76] it doesn't kill bacteria and everybody's
[1452.48 - 1456.24] sick because of pro
[1453.76 - 1458.00] because of bacteria and viruses right
[1456.24 - 1460.88] protein doesn't take out toxic heavy
[1458.00 - 1462.00] metals so we can do all protein protein
[1460.88 - 1464.40] shakes protein everything
[1462.00 - 1466.32] it doesn't take out toxic heavy metals
[1464.40 - 1468.08] it doesn't kill bugs
[1466.32 - 1470.84] protein doesn't get rid of yeast and
[1468.08 - 1474.36] mold and unproductive dangerous
[1470.84 - 1476.96] fungus protein doesn't get rid of
[1474.36 - 1480.24] petrochemicals and plastics
[1476.96 - 1483.28] it doesn't get rid of radiation
[1480.24 - 1484.96] it doesn't do any of this stuff so
[1483.28 - 1488.24] interesting right
[1484.96 - 1490.96] so we got to do other things to get your
[1488.24 - 1492.16] organs repaired and get the bad stuff
[1490.96 - 1494.88] out
[1492.16 - 1496.96] everybody's eating everybody's eating a
[1494.88 - 1499.68] ton of protein
[1496.96 - 1500.56] everybody's eating a ton of protein and
[1499.68 - 1502.64] they're sick
[1500.56 - 1504.88] and they stay sick and they stay sick or
[1502.64 - 1506.48] they wave back and forth from being sick
[1504.88 - 1508.24] to a little better being sick to a
[1506.48 - 1510.00] little bit better
[1508.24 - 1512.00] and they but they get in trouble either
[1510.00 - 1513.84] way keep that in mind
[1512.00 - 1515.68] so ask what your protein is doing for
[1513.84 - 1517.28] you because apparently
[1515.68 - 1518.88] medical research and science doesn't
[1517.28 - 1520.16] know what protein does for us
[1518.88 - 1521.84] they don't know because they don't know
[1520.16 - 1523.60] why we're sick but they tell you to keep
[1521.84 - 1526.56] on taking the protein right
[1523.60 - 1527.68] i'm talking about plant-based vegetarian
[1526.56 - 1530.08] i don't care what
[1527.68 - 1531.68] side of the aisle you're on okay animal
[1530.08 - 1533.52] protein diets keto
[1531.68 - 1535.12] paleo whatever you choose or do whatever
[1533.52 - 1536.64] fancy name comes around the corner for
[1535.12 - 1538.24] diets
[1536.64 - 1539.84] protein doesn't get rid of the toxic
[1538.24 - 1541.60] heavy metals protein doesn't get rid of
[1539.84 - 1543.04] pesticides or besides fungicides protein
[1541.60 - 1543.76] doesn't get rid of petrochemicals in the
[1543.04 - 1545.12] solvents
[1543.76 - 1547.36] protein doesn't get rid of the scented
[1545.12 - 1547.92] candle chemicals and the air freshener
[1547.36 - 1549.84] chemicals
[1547.92 - 1551.76] protein doesn't get rid of the bugs the
[1549.84 - 1552.32] viruses the bacteria the mold the yeast
[1551.76 - 1555.04] the fungus
[1552.32 - 1556.00] protein doesn't do any of that so you
[1555.04 - 1558.32] eat your protein all
[1556.00 - 1559.84] you want all you want still be in the
[1558.32 - 1560.86] dental chairs getting your teeth all
[1559.84 - 1562.48] drilled and
[1560.86 - 1564.72] [Music]
[1562.48 - 1566.00] all your teeth getting you know it's
[1564.72 - 1568.24] implants and
[1566.00 - 1570.08] root canals you'll still get that you'll
[1568.24 - 1571.60] still get your gallbladders removed just
[1570.08 - 1572.32] to get your appendix removed you'll
[1571.60 - 1573.92] still get
[1572.32 - 1575.84] you just whatever you'll still get sick
[1573.92 - 1579.28] you'll still stay sick the whole bit
[1575.84 - 1582.80] and that that's what will happen and
[1579.28 - 1582.80] you know the bottom line is
[1584.96 - 1588.08] well the bottom line is that hold on you
[1587.68 - 1599.84] guys
[1588.08 - 1599.84] got a little tech problem
[1601.76 - 1610.88] the monolithing cleanse is to restore
[1607.60 - 1612.96] and heal that's what it's for
[1610.88 - 1614.08] it can be done long term it could be
[1612.96 - 1616.80] done a year
[1614.08 - 1617.36] it could be done two years it can be
[1616.80 - 1620.32] done
[1617.36 - 1621.12] for a month six months eight months it
[1620.32 - 1624.32] can be done
[1621.12 - 1626.64] long term short term we're doing a three
[1624.32 - 1628.88] day mono cleanse challenge i'm pumped up
[1626.64 - 1631.76] i'm excited
[1628.88 - 1633.60] intestinal tracts get inflamed with bugs
[1631.76 - 1636.16] that's what they get inflamed with
[1633.60 - 1638.00] so our guts get inflamed with bugs
[1636.16 - 1641.60] that's that's what happens okay
[1638.00 - 1643.60] and um they lose all the body parts they
[1641.60 - 1646.96] just fall apart there on the ground
[1643.60 - 1648.64] so what happens is that everybody's got
[1646.96 - 1650.64] little buggies inside their gut
[1648.64 - 1653.20] they got inside their colon they got
[1650.64 - 1655.20] inside their small intestinal tract
[1653.20 - 1657.44] and you can take all the probiotics you
[1655.20 - 1659.12] want you can take all the microflora
[1657.44 - 1661.12] products you want you can do all the
[1659.12 - 1663.04] microorganism products
[1661.12 - 1664.24] you can do the fecal matter implant
[1663.04 - 1667.36] which is insane
[1664.24 - 1669.44] which is absolutely insanity you can do
[1667.36 - 1671.52] anything you want with your gut
[1669.44 - 1673.04] do your coffee enemas if you want to
[1671.52 - 1675.28] which is insane
[1673.04 - 1676.80] just terrible you can do all these
[1675.28 - 1679.52] different things
[1676.80 - 1681.68] you can add all the fermented foods you
[1679.52 - 1684.24] want with all the fermented
[1681.68 - 1685.44] the fermented probiotics and all you
[1684.24 - 1687.44] want there
[1685.44 - 1689.44] and all that's going to do is nothing
[1687.44 - 1691.52] because your bad bugs
[1689.44 - 1693.60] don't battle the good bugs your good
[1691.52 - 1695.44] bugs don't battle the bad bugs
[1693.60 - 1696.88] to put all the good stuff you want
[1695.44 - 1698.16] you're still going to be inflamed
[1696.88 - 1700.40] you're still going to have problems you
[1698.16 - 1702.64] still end up with the acid reflux later
[1700.40 - 1704.40] you know your h pylori won't go away if
[1702.64 - 1706.40] you're somebody with h pylori don't even
[1704.40 - 1707.52] know you have h pylori your e coli won't

[1709.84 - 1712.88] road
[1710.64 - 1714.16] it'll happen when you're 60 years old
[1712.88 - 1716.40] just it's going to happen
[1714.16 - 1717.92] might be 25 now and be like no i'm doing

[1909.60 - 1913.12] ounces of lemon water you start out your
[1911.28 - 1916.40] day with that you flush out the liver
[1913.12 - 1918.16] you flush out the poisons get them out

[1936.72 - 1942.24] juicer out now because

[1942.24 - 1944.88] run some if you guys don't mind and
[1943.60 - 1948.00] we're still going to talk about
[1944.88 - 1951.44] the model eating cleanse challenge
[1948.00 - 1953.28] it's important to have the book read the
[1951.44 - 1956.80] book
[1953.28 - 1963.84] really important so you want 16 to 32
[1956.80 - 1963.84] ounces of celery juice
[1964.48 - 1969.20] right so you're gonna juice a little bit
[1966.88 - 1972.08] of that real quick
[1969.20 - 1976.96] you need the mineral salts you need the
[1972.08 - 1978.80] trace minerals
[1976.96 - 1980.72] you know when i hear someone do like the
[1978.80 - 1982.16] carnivore diet i'm like oh my god it's
[1980.72 - 1983.92] just a matter of time yeah you're
[1982.16 - 1986.64] feeling a little better
[1983.92 - 1987.44] for five seconds but it's a matter of
[1986.64 - 1990.24] time
[1987.44 - 1992.32] before you just run out of everything
[1990.24 - 1995.52] your body needs
[1992.32 - 1997.76] to restore recover and heal clockwork
[1995.52 - 1999.28] there's not one carnivore person
[1997.76 - 2001.76] carnivore diet person
[1999.28 - 2003.20] that doesn't just blow themselves up
[2001.76 - 2005.28] from doing that
[2003.20 - 2007.52] it's just terrible right you've got to
[2005.28 - 2009.68] have the mineral salts
[2007.52 - 2011.68] when someone adds celery juice to
[2009.68 - 2013.84] whatever mistakes they're making
[2011.68 - 2015.52] it actually allows them to keep on
[2013.84 - 2016.80] making mistakes did you guys know that

[2128.56 - 2134.56] your supplements
[2131.12 - 2136.96] can you still do that if you're doing
[2134.56 - 2139.52] the mono eating cleanse
[2136.96 - 2141.44] there's a section in the chapter that
[2139.52 - 2144.47] talks about that
[2141.44 - 2146.08] you still want to do supplements
[2144.47 - 2147.44] [Applause]
[2146.08 - 2150.08] yes and you can read about the
[2147.44 - 2150.08] information
[2152.16 - 2158.24] so i'm just juicing a little bit of
[2153.44 - 2162.08] celery juice
[2158.24 - 2164.00] sameel says can i do supplements
[2162.08 - 2165.84] now here's the thing that's a really
[2164.00 - 2166.88] good question too can i do supplements
[2165.84 - 2169.12] right
[2166.88 - 2171.28] well what supplements are we talking
[2169.12 - 2173.36] about we talk about charcoal
[2171.28 - 2175.12] probably like some bad probiotic blend
[2173.36 - 2176.96] are we talking about
[2175.12 - 2179.12] a protein powder are we talking about
[2176.96 - 2180.24] some big multivitamin powder it's got
[2179.12 - 2182.40] garbage and junk in it
[2180.24 - 2184.40] msg are you talking about stuff with
[2182.40 - 2186.08] citric acid in it are you talking about
[2184.40 - 2186.56] whey protein powder are you talking
[2186.08 - 2188.96] about
[2186.56 - 2189.60] bentonite clay are you talking about
[2188.96 - 2192.24] zeolite
[2189.60 - 2193.20] are you talking about chlorella what are
[2192.24 - 2195.68] you talking about
[2193.20 - 2196.80] because all these things are irritants
[2195.68 - 2198.96] and problems
[2196.80 - 2200.80] to the intestinal tract they're all
[2198.96 - 2201.60] irritants and problems the intestinal
[2200.80 - 2205.04] tract
[2201.60 - 2206.40] so you know when someone's like yeah can
[2205.04 - 2207.92] i still do my supplements
[2206.40 - 2209.84] well you could be doing stuff that's
[2207.92 - 2211.36] really irritating really problematic but
[2209.84 - 2213.36] i'm not telling you not to do them
[2211.36 - 2214.80] you do what your doctor wants you to do
[2213.36 - 2217.04] i'm just telling that that's what i
[2214.80 - 2218.72] would be asking myself right there okay
[2217.04 - 2220.32] and i cover this in the medical medium
[2218.72 - 2222.72] cleanse the heel book so
[2220.32 - 2224.40] it's like there's a difference between
[2222.72 - 2226.24] doing supplements
[2224.40 - 2227.52] and there's a difference between doing
[2226.24 - 2229.36] irritants and
[2227.52 - 2231.04] and supplements that actually cause
[2229.36 - 2232.72] problems that don't do anything for you
[2231.04 - 2234.96] and you don't realize it
[2232.72 - 2236.40] it's all of that so here's what can
[2234.96 - 2238.00] happen you're doing the medical media
[2236.40 - 2238.96] monocles and that's actually bringing
[2238.00 - 2240.24] your liver back
[2238.96 - 2242.64] and you're taking all these garbage
[2240.24 - 2244.56] supplements you know and
[2242.64 - 2246.24] just that could happen too i'm not
[2244.56 - 2247.72] saying you're doing that i'm just saying
[2246.24 - 2254.64] people do that
[2247.72 - 2255.92] [Music]
[2254.64 - 2257.73] so i'm just doing a little bit more
[2255.92 - 2259.80] celery right here getting
[2257.73 - 2261.20] [Music]
[2259.80 - 2270.56] [Applause]
[2261.20 - 2272.08] a little bit more in here
[2270.56 - 2274.32] everything freezing on you guys out
[2272.08 - 2274.32] there
[2274.42 - 2277.04] [Music]
[2275.84 - 2280.80] all right just want to juice a little
[2277.04 - 2285.20] bit of celery and there we are
[2280.80 - 2289.84] i'm going to put this away
[2285.20 - 2291.60] yeah got my celery juice
[2289.84 - 2293.04] just love that dry pulp and just a
[2291.60 - 2295.60] little bit of pulp but dry
[2293.04 - 2297.52] it's amazing when that stuff is dry like
[2295.60 - 2298.00] that that's incredible no other juicers
[2297.52 - 2299.36] do that
[2298.00 - 2301.44] it's the only juicer that does that i
[2299.36 - 2302.72] love it
[2301.44 - 2304.16] it's going to strain this you got to
[2302.72 - 2306.72] strain your celery juice the reason why
[2304.16 - 2309.92] i'm actually juicing celery right now
[2306.72 - 2311.92] is not just because i want some myself
[2309.92 - 2313.36] but because i want to remind you guys
[2311.92 - 2316.32] you have to strain
[2313.36 - 2316.32] your celery juice
[2316.56 - 2320.40] you have to celery juice shouldn't have
[2318.64 - 2322.80] any fiber or pulp in it
[2320.40 - 2324.24] or it's not going to work to its maximum
[2322.80 - 2325.60] level
[2324.24 - 2327.36] and if you're going to be doing the mono
[2325.60 - 2327.92] eating cleanse cause i'm gonna be doing
[2327.36 - 2331.20] that
[2327.92 - 2332.88] then you want that maximum right
[2331.20 - 2334.88] if you can't do lemon water and you
[2332.88 - 2336.88] can't do lemon or you don't have a lemon
[2334.88 - 2338.80] do water in the morning first thing
[2336.88 - 2340.48] okay it's it read about it in the
[2338.80 - 2341.44] substitute section in the cleansing heal
[2340.48 - 2343.12] book
[2341.44 - 2344.48] you can do that to read about it in the
[2343.12 - 2346.72] cleanse of heal
[2344.48 - 2349.68] so we'll run over some stuff janet says
[2346.72 - 2352.32] do you need to eat the same thing
[2349.68 - 2353.84] all three days or can you do papaya one
[2352.32 - 2354.56] day squash the next day okay good
[2353.84 - 2357.68] question
[2354.56 - 2360.00] look if you do papaya one day
[2357.68 - 2361.52] banana the next you do papaya one day
[2360.00 - 2362.64] steamed potatoes the next if you do
[2361.52 - 2363.84] papaya one day
[2362.64 - 2366.00] whatever and you're doing you know
[2363.84 - 2367.28] winter squash next don't want to lose
[2366.00 - 2370.88] that one
[2367.28 - 2372.88] if you do that you're you're you're
[2370.88 - 2374.56] basically customizing medical medium
[2372.88 - 2376.16] tools that's what you're doing
[2374.56 - 2379.20] so you're customizing medical medium
[2376.16 - 2381.84] tools it's not meant to be like that
[2379.20 - 2383.52] yeah you can do it but you're but you're
[2381.84 - 2385.60] customizing you're kind of
[2383.52 - 2387.76] you're you're changing up medical medium
[2385.60 - 2391.20] tools right that's what you're doing
[2387.76 - 2393.76] so there's no law against it right
[2391.20 - 2394.96] you can do banana one day you can do
[2393.76 - 2397.52] papaya the next
[2394.96 - 2399.28] steamed potatoes the next so you mono
[2397.52 - 2399.60] eat one thing one day you might wait one
[2399.28 - 2401.52] thing
[2399.60 - 2402.96] no another day you model it because you
[2401.52 - 2404.48] basically do what you did basically
[2402.96 - 2405.92] you're doing mono eating for one day
[2404.48 - 2407.76] model eating for another day just
[2405.92 - 2409.92] changing it up right that's what your
[2407.76 - 2411.52] heart desires that's what you want to do
[2409.92 - 2413.28] something you can do
[2411.52 - 2415.28] is it meant to be like that it's not
[2413.28 - 2416.80] meant to be like that but if you find
[2415.28 - 2419.44] but at the same time and i talk about
[2416.80 - 2422.16] this in cleansing heal just so you know
[2419.44 - 2424.32] if there's something that you're not
[2422.16 - 2425.60] jiving with something you're feeling
[2424.32 - 2429.12] like you're not
[2425.60 - 2430.48] gelling with right and if you're not
[2429.12 - 2431.84] jelly you don't want to do the steamed
[2430.48 - 2432.88] potato one and that's what you're doing
[2431.84 - 2435.68] for a day or two
[2432.88 - 2438.40] you can switch it up 100 you can and
[2435.68 - 2442.00] then start doing papaya but the goal
[2438.40 - 2442.64] is to be on one of them eventually for a
[2442.00 - 2444.40] while
[2442.64 - 2445.68] that's the goal you know you want to be
[2444.40 - 2448.16] on one of them that that
[2445.68 - 2448.88] feels good to you so if steam peas feel
[2448.16 - 2451.12] good to you
[2448.88 - 2452.80] every day so you do your lemon water you
[2451.12 - 2454.80] do your celery juice
[2452.80 - 2456.24] you do your steamed peas you do your
[2454.80 - 2458.72] lettuce and steamed peas
[2456.24 - 2459.60] you do it twice during the day right
[2458.72 - 2461.60] then do some
[2459.60 - 2462.64] then do some more water throughout the
[2461.60 - 2464.64] day
[2462.64 - 2466.64] and your day is done and you did one day
[2464.64 - 2468.16] of a mono-eating cleanse
[2466.64 - 2469.92] try to do the steamed peas again the
[2468.16 - 2472.56] next day if it's gelling
[2469.92 - 2473.76] if it feels good if it's you feel you're
[2472.56 - 2477.12] happy about it right
[2473.76 - 2479.68] do it the next day you could
[2477.12 - 2480.72] recommend a juicer yeah melanie the
[2479.68 - 2485.12] juicer is
[2480.72 - 2488.96] this one right here okay it's the omega
[2485.12 - 2492.00] mm-900 hds but just just so you know
[2488.96 - 2494.00] it's the mm-900 hds
[2492.00 - 2495.84] so it's not any other omega juicer this
[2494.00 - 2497.28] is the one that's the celery juicer but
[2495.84 - 2499.28] it does other things too
[2497.28 - 2501.76] it's a celery juicer where the pulp just
[2499.28 - 2505.36] comes out bone dry
[2501.76 - 2508.40] right apollo says so stay with
[2505.36 - 2508.88] one for three days that's what i'm gonna
[2508.40 - 2510.80] do
[2508.88 - 2512.32] i'm gonna stay with one for three days
[2510.80 - 2514.80] that's what i'm gonna do
[2512.32 - 2516.40] yeah so anyway that's the juice right
[2514.80 - 2518.72] there mm-900 hgs
[2516.40 - 2520.96] there's a sale coming up on that juicer
[2518.72 - 2522.32] in like a few days or something i'm not
[2520.96 - 2523.60] sure what day it is but there's a sale
[2522.32 - 2525.84] coming up where it's 20
[2523.60 - 2527.52] off so if you wait till then that's a
[2525.84 - 2530.48] good idea
[2527.52 - 2531.20] but reading the book is important as i
[2530.48 - 2533.68] said
[2531.20 - 2535.52] multiple times already that it's really
[2533.68 - 2536.88] that important to understand what's
[2535.52 - 2540.16] happening in the book like
[2536.88 - 2541.84] because if you do change it up you know
[2540.16 - 2543.84] if you do change it up it talks about
[2541.84 - 2545.44] what you know what how it works
[2543.84 - 2547.12] read the book for details that answers
[2545.44 - 2548.24] hundreds of questions with the minor
[2547.12 - 2550.24] eating cleanse
[2548.24 - 2552.24] but i'm going to help as far as like
[2550.24 - 2553.68] make this as simple so let's cut let's
[2552.24 - 2556.80] cut right to the chase
[2553.68 - 2558.88] right do you have your celery
[2556.80 - 2560.56] really important do you have your
[2558.88 - 2561.92] bananas if you're going to go the banana
[2560.56 - 2563.92] root

[2789.28 - 2793.12] all going to get worse over time from
[2790.88 - 2796.80] eating eggs
[2793.12 - 2800.00] the mono eating cleanse
[2796.80 - 2800.00] and cleanse the heal
[2800.84 - 2806.40] right the mono-eating cleanse and
[2803.60 - 2806.40] cleanse the heel
[2806.48 - 2810.32] is gentle enough
[2810.88 - 2815.20] but also starves the very bugs that are
[2813.52 - 2816.08] inside your gut that are keeping you
[2815.20 - 2819.04] sick and inflamed
[2816.08 - 2821.12] so that you can heal over time that's
[2819.04 - 2822.08] what it's about adele says no eggs ever
[2821.12 - 2823.44] again
[2822.08 - 2824.56] when it comes down to watermelon if you
[2823.44 - 2826.32] guys want to do if you're going to
[2824.56 - 2827.28] choose watermelon to mono eat
[2826.32 - 2829.36] i'm just going to give you a couple of
[2827.28 - 2831.12] tips you better be doing celery juice
[2829.36 - 2832.88] or you're going to hit the wall you're
[2831.12 - 2835.04] going to hit the watermelon wall
[2832.88 - 2837.12] because there's not enough calories or
[2835.04 - 2838.40] mineral salts in watermelon
[2837.12 - 2840.00] because basically if you're just doing
[2838.40 - 2841.76] watermelon by itself and watermelon's
[2840.00 - 2843.20] great i mean i've done long-term
[2841.76 - 2844.72] stents of eating watermelon but i've
[2843.20 - 2847.04] known how to balance it where you've got
[2844.72 - 2850.32] to have some lettuce
[2847.04 - 2853.04] you got to have some celery juice
[2850.32 - 2854.64] okay the reason why watermelon's not
[2853.04 - 2856.80] this 100 like
[2854.64 - 2858.88] perfect option in the cleansing heel
[2856.80 - 2861.12] book in the monocline section
[2858.88 - 2862.08] is because there's not enough calories
[2861.12 - 2863.36] in the watermelon
[2862.08 - 2865.12] and you end up doing kind of like a
[2863.36 - 2866.24] watermelon juice fast right that's what
[2865.12 - 2869.76] you're doing
[2866.24 - 2870.56] but doing you can't do a watermelon
[2869.76 - 2874.40] juice fast
[2870.56 - 2876.00] long term so how are you going to then
[2874.40 - 2877.44] heal your guts if you need to do the
[2876.00 - 2879.28] monoclines long term
[2877.44 - 2880.88] so the mono cleanse is designed where
[2879.28 - 2882.80] you can actually do it long term
[2880.88 - 2884.40] to get to the finish line and get rid of
[2882.80 - 2885.68] your problems and start healing things
[2884.40 - 2886.40] that are deep within that's the whole
[2885.68 - 2888.16] point
[2886.40 - 2889.44] but absolutely you can do a three-day
[2888.16 - 2891.12] watermelon version
[2889.44 - 2893.28] you're using a medical medium tool right
[2891.12 - 2893.68] the watermelon juice the medical medium
[2893.28 - 2897.04] tool
[2893.68 - 2899.52] that's fine you're using that and
[2897.04 - 2901.20] you're customizing for yourself to do
[2899.52 - 2902.48] some to do some mono eating cleanse
[2901.20 - 2904.00] right it's fine
[2902.48 - 2905.52] but make sure you got some butter leaf
[2904.00 - 2906.72] lettuce in there or some kind of lettuce
[2905.52 - 2908.24] in there and make sure you got your
[2906.72 - 2910.40] celery juice and make sure you got your
[2908.24 - 2911.92] lemon water you have to have the balance
[2910.40 - 2912.72] of all the different phytochemical
[2911.92 - 2915.12] compounds
[2912.72 - 2919.04] the mineral salts they have to be there
[2915.12 - 2920.72] the antivirals antibacterials right
[2919.04 - 2923.12] can i use honey in the lemon water
[2920.72 - 2923.52] during mono eating i'm pretty sure you

[2983.44 - 2986.32] to make you hungry
[2984.88 - 2988.16] on the mono eating cleanse is you're
[2986.32 - 2989.76] going to be probably withholding the
[2988.16 - 2991.76] calories and not eating enough
[2989.76 - 2996.00] got not eating enough you might be like
[2991.76 - 2999.04] okay well i just had a potato today

[3035.36 - 3038.72] servings if you're hungry have a few
[3037.28 - 3040.40] potatoes
[3038.72 - 3042.08] that's what you want to do if you're

[3282.88 - 3287.76] doing the papaya one
[3284.96 - 3290.48] i would have i got a papaya over here
[3287.76 - 3290.48] whole papaya
[3290.96 - 3295.60] buy one there it is right i would do a
[3294.40 - 3299.20] papaya
[3295.60 - 3301.60] a day said i would do for sure cut the
[3299.20 - 3303.52] papaya in half this is a large papaya if
[3301.60 - 3305.92] you got small papayas do more of them
[3303.52 - 3307.84] right i i mean me i would do a papaya
[3305.92 - 3309.92] and a half
[3307.84 - 3311.52] in a day doing my celery juice well
[3309.92 - 3312.40] lemon water papaya and a half that's
[3311.52 - 3316.00] what i would do
[3312.40 - 3318.08] right if you're just doing papaya okay
[3316.00 - 3321.28] you may not want to do that much papaya
[3318.08 - 3323.28] if you're doing bananas
[3321.28 - 3324.56] because if you can choose the papaya and
[3323.28 - 3326.88] banana version
[3324.56 - 3328.00] and cleanse the heal so you can choose
[3326.88 - 3329.60] that one you guys
[3328.00 - 3332.16] the papaya and banana version and
[3329.60 - 3335.20] cleanse the heel so keep that in mind
[3332.16 - 3336.64] right so you can do like you can do a
[3335.20 - 3338.80] few bananas
[3336.64 - 3340.80] during lunch a couple bananas later if
[3338.80 - 3341.28] you wanted to a few more bananas later
[3340.80 - 3343.28] on
[3341.28 - 3345.12] you got your papayas too if you're
[3343.28 - 3345.60] somebody that's like ah can't do papaya
[3345.12 - 3348.48] uh
[3345.60 - 3350.00] can't do banana and you even have an
[3348.48 - 3351.52] option of doing cucumber juice in the
[3350.00 - 3352.64] afternoon too you can do cucumber juice
[3351.52 - 3354.96] in the afternoon remember this is the
[3352.64 - 3356.24] mono cleanse
[3354.96 - 3358.72] and that's what it is and you can do
[3356.24 - 3359.84] that option potatoes you might be
[3358.72 - 3360.96] somebody that's like look i want to do
[3359.84 - 3362.88] steamed potatoes
[3360.96 - 3364.72] that's my that the one i want steamed
[3362.88 - 3367.20] peas is another one read the chapter
[3364.72 - 3368.72] chapter several times it's pretty easy
[3367.20 - 3370.16] to do just read the chapter several
[3368.72 - 3373.20] times
[3370.16 - 3377.04] the steam p version is amazing too
[3373.20 - 3380.32] okay you guys so you got that
[3377.04 - 3384.64] as an option so i am totally
[3380.32 - 3388.00] totally totally down totally psyched
[3384.64 - 3391.68] totally pumped big time
[3388.00 - 3392.24] because so uh teresa says add lime with
[3391.68 - 3397.20] papaya
[3392.24 - 3399.68] yes you can you can boiled potatoes okay
[3397.20 - 3401.28] that's a really good question steamed
[3399.68 - 3403.44] potatoes
[3401.28 - 3405.36] boiling them does something different
[3403.44 - 3408.24] really important to know okay
[3405.36 - 3411.12] when you boil potatoes you boil a lot of
[3408.24 - 3414.64] the carbohydrate out of the potato
[3411.12 - 3417.36] so if you boil a potato okay
[3414.64 - 3418.72] you lose a lot of the glucose that
[3417.36 - 3420.64] you're going to need
[3418.72 - 3423.92] when you boil potatoes you might need to
[3420.64 - 3425.92] eat more potatoes because you boil them
[3423.92 - 3427.04] they end up because the glucose gets
[3425.92 - 3429.04] boiled not
[3427.04 - 3430.80] all of it but the glucose gets boiled
[3429.04 - 3433.76] out of the potato
[3430.80 - 3435.84] and then those natural sugars end up in
[3433.76 - 3438.00] your broth they end up in your
[3435.84 - 3440.24] like the liquid you're dumping out
[3438.00 - 3442.08] that's such an important question
[3440.24 - 3444.56] can you blend both pie and banana yeah
[3442.08 - 3445.60] you can what i like to do is i like to
[3444.56 - 3447.76] blend the papaya
[3445.60 - 3449.84] in a food processor right and then i
[3447.76 - 3451.60] like to chop up little pieces of banana
[3449.84 - 3452.80] i like to dip them into the papaya and
[3451.60 - 3454.16] i'm going to do that i'm actually going
