143
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,320
first

145
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,040

bemergee.com i'm not sponsored it's just

147
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,759
the best stuff it's critical to have the

148
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,360
best stuff

149
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,600
if you don't have the best stuff you try

150
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,199
your best so and we can still do some

151
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,680
you know we can still do some cleansing

152
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,639
but

153
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,000
want to maximize it it's about

154
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:57,680
maximizing that cleanse

155
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,960
here's the barley grass juice powder

156
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,960
right there that's a vimergy barley

157
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,840
grass juice powder

158
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,600
okay so now if you can't get the frozen

159
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,440
wild blueberries these are not

160
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,039
cultivated blueberries so if you put

161
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,960
cultivated blueberries

162
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,080
in the cleanse it's not going to do what

163
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,120
it needs to do

164
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,280
so you may want to get a hold of

165
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,160
the wyman's juice right there that's an

166
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,880
option too

167
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,360
the wyman's uh wild blueberry juice okay

168
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,280
that's at shop.weimans.com

169
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,199
so that's an option right there i know

170
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,120
that a lot of people are using this

171
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,720
in their smoothie they can't get the

172
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,759
frozen wobblers they're also doing both

173
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,600
they're putting this in the smoothie

174
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,639
with their frozen wild black blueberries

175
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,880

213
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,360

216
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,639
metal detox with colette

217
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:59,680
you don't do the heavy metal detox with

218
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,680
zeolite a heavy metal detox smoothie is

219
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,440
not what zeolite very important to know

220
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,560
if it people are

221
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,280
trying to create their own heavy metal

222
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,680
detox

223
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,639
smoothies and stuff so there's imitators

224
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,080
out there because the

225
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,080
medical medium heavy metal detox

226
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,680
smoothie is famous millions of people

227
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,919
around the world

228
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,160
if you look at the gold label on the

229
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,000
medical medium books right here okay

230
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,919
and it says millions of copies sold in

231
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,960
the medical medium series

232
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:29,440
all around the world it's the number one

233
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,000
health books in the world right now six

234
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,400
and a half

235
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,479
years running and there's a reason for

236
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,919
that the heavy metal detox cleanse has

237
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,720
saved lives

238
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,840
and that's how important it is zeolite's

239
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,240
not in the cleanse

240
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,879
chlorella is not in the cleanse

241
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:48,240
bentonite clay is not in the cleanse

242
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:51,280
charcoal is not in the cleanse those

243
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,039
disturbingly hurt people okay there's no

244
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,759
zeolites today

245
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,759
that there were of the yesteryear okay

246
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,080
so that's important and bentonite clay

247
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,199
is

248
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,120
actually dangerous charcoal is dangerous

249
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,479
in the intestinal tract it doesn't take

250
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,440
out metals

251
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:09,120
that's important to know chlorella is

252
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,160
dangerous because

253
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:15,280
chlorella is riddled in bacteria most

254
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,360
most batches of chlorella it's caused

255
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,280
a lot of harm on people people have

256
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,400
literally had their guts torn apart

257
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,720
because of it

258
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,240
and so i don't mess around with

259
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,080
chlorella and it doesn't remove

260
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,360
toxic heavy metals so that's important

261
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,840
to know so

262
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,840
heavy metal detox smoothie works and it

263
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,839
works and it's gentle and it does

264
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,479
because of what's in here

265
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,159
so that's important to know right the

266
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,039
zeolites today

267
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,719
they're dusted with non-edible zeolites

268
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,640
that's why it's not good

269
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,560
that's why it's not good so i don't i

270
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,720
don't recommend those at all

271
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,920
as of today so it's important to know so

272
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,440
we're talking about the heavy metal

273
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,880
detox smoothie cleanse this is

274
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:57,440
preparation

275
00:08:52,880 --> 00:09:00,399
i'm excited this is a big deal today

276
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,440
okay so um and zeolites don't get metals

277
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,800
out of the brain

278
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,320
they don't get metals out of the liver

279
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,399
just so you know chlorella doesn't get

280
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,080
metals out of the brain doesn't get

281
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,920
metals out of the liver

282
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,519
bentonite clay doesn't get metals out of

283
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,399
the brain doesn't get metals out of the

284
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,080
liver

285
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,760
charcoal doesn't get metals out of the

286
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,880
brain doesn't get metals of the liver

287
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,720
there's a reason why the heavy metal

288
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,080
detox smoothie medical medium one works

289
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,640
and how it's imitated

290
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,080
constantly around the world by people

291
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,600
trying to make their own brews

292
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,519
trying to actually first of all the

293
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,040
reason why we know about removing toxic

294
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,440
heavy metals is from

295
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,480
medical medium information so let's make

296
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,640
that clear

297
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,560
that's so important to know because

298
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,519
you're going to hear about metals and

299
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,040
what to do out there but it all stems

300
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,720
from medical medium information

301
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,560
originally 35 years

302
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,480
of helping get metals out of people's

303
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,560
lives out of their out of their bodies

304
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,560
so people can heal

305
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,480
information that toxic heavy metals

306
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,200
cause psoriasis and eczema

307
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,560
and brain fog is medical medium

308
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,800
information

309
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,920
just medical meme information anybody

310
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,040
using that

311
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,880
originally got it from medical media so

312
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,040
in order for us to know about anxiety

313
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,480
even healing from metals and depression

314
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,519
healing from metals

315
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:16,720
and multiple sclerosis and als

316
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:19,519
and brain fog that's from medical medium

317
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,920
information so it's a legendary smoothie

318
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,680

metals are behind adhd

322
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,360
and originally it originates and stems

323
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,959
back to medical medium information as

324
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,440

388

part of the cleanse they don't go into

the smoothie but you want to have some

390
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,920

something you need

394
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:55,839
oranges is in the in the smoothie so um

395
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,360
if someone doesn't like oranges because

396
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,399
i like putting an orange inside the

397
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,800
smoothie

398
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,560
we can switch it up and we can do

399
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,120
coconut water instead of the orange if

400
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:08,560
you'd like or water inside the smoothie

401
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:11,600
but the most important ingredients

402
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:14,480
to the smoothie okay

403
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,079
are the frozen wild blueberries now i

404
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,200
know that some people can't get the

405
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:19,440
frozen wild blueberries right now

406
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,760
because we're in that harvest time

407
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,760

454
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,199
we're going to talk about metals we're

455
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,279
going to talk about

456
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,880
copper because everybody's playing

457
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,440

459
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,760
copper mugs copper thermoses we're going

460
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:02,079

461
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,760

the goal of the cleanse is to get metals

468
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,920
out of our body because we're exposed to

469
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,480
metals we're loaded with metal

470
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,680
we have different types of metal inside

471
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,920
of our brain

472
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,079
we don't just have one type of metal in

473
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,360
our brain we have aluminum in our brain

474
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,120
we have

475
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,040
mercury in our brain we have copper in

476
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,560

00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,240
proven better than any scientific study

730
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:42,320
can

00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:44,400
ever prove in our history that it works

732
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,159
the scientific method is you do

733
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,880
something over and over again in hopes

734
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:51,840
to even get a partial result

735
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,600

740
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,039

00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:16,240
even equals or measures what it really

745
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:18,320

00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:33,039
yeah and that gets passed around

753
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:35,120
from generation to generation when

754
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,520
mercury is in your system it gets passed

755
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,200
around

756
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,279

757
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:43,600

around okay

761
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:50,880

couple of family members who are

859
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:28,080
allergic to fruits so the allergic to

860
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,080
fruits and vitamin c

861
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,600
would it still work without the wild

862
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,840
blueberries

863
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,120
wild blueberries are a critical aspect

864
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,279
of it right

865
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,399
you can try it without the wild

866
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:41,520
blueberry

867
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:43,200
okay and so um so you have some people

868
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,640
in the family that they have an allergic

869
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,960
reaction to

870
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,720
they don't have allergic reaction to uh

871
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,480
natural vitamin c

872
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,320
so they they don't have that because no

873
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,200
one can have an allergic reaction to

874
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,760
actual

875
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,799
the natural vitamin c that's it's it's

876
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,039
part of

877
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:00,799
you see without blood if if they're

878
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:02,960
alive

879
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:05,120
that means they're they're getting

880
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,200
vitamin c somewhere a little vitamin

881
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,559
c because we die without vitamin c

882
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,240
that's important to know

883
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:12,240
if you don't have vitamin c you die

884
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,559
that's why people on a ship

885
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,600
out in the water too long without any

886
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,919
vitamin c

887
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,279
they died before the ship made its land

888
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:21,039
so if a long voyage

889
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:23,440
if there was a long voyage of men on a

890
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:26,000
ship men and women on a ship

891
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,279
right and there was no vitamin c to be

892
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,200
had

893
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:30,640
that would be a ghost ship it would land

894
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,840
land in a port and everybody would be

895
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,080
dead

896
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,760
vitamin c we is one of those make or

897
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,440
breaks we stay alive or not so they're

898
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,039
not allergic to vitamin c

899
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,520
so that means the testing is accurate

900
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:44,240
inaccurate about vitamin c

901
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,760
and as far as fruits go they could be

902
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,679
allergic to fruit if there's

903
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,279
if they if they're like if they eat a

904
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,120
piece of fruit and their throat closes

905
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,880
up and they need the epipen

906
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,320
then yeah they're allergic to fruit

907
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,480
absolutely

908
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,240
but if that's not happening are you just

909
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,600
talking about a food allergy test are

910
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,480
you talking about food sensitivity test

911
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,120
because those are just

912
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,000
bonk bonkers those are bonkers out there

913
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,360
it

914
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,960
i've actually been teaching about that

915
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,240
to doctors too they actually there's so

916
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,559
many doctors know that know

917
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,480
now that those tests are just fraudulent

918
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:14,000
those are fraudulent tests

919
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,600
like you go and get a test and you've

920
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,279
got 50 foods on the test and they tell

921
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,799
you to not eat 10 different fruits or 20

922
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:21,840
different fruits on the test

923
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:23,360
that's actually a fraudulent test unless

924
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,279
you're eating a banana and your throat

925
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,159
closes up and you need an epipen and

926
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:28,240
you're in the hospital

927
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,200
then yeah you're allergic you're

928
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,960
allergic

929
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,240
but do with your doctor do you you know

930
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,799
have your family do what their doctor

931
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,760
tells you

932
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:36,880
so you would want to keep the fruits out

933
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,120
of the cleanse

934
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:41,519
that's what you or you're asking right

935
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,080
so the only thing i can say is you could

936
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,919
still do

937
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,760
some spirulina you can still do coconut

938
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:48,480
water yes you can still do it

939
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,120
and get some benefits absolutely so what

940
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,279
i

941
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:53,200
would ask your doctor if it's okay if

942
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:55,200
you can do the spirulina

943
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,799
the barley grass juice powder right ask

944
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,080
your doctor if it's okay to do those

945
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:00,000
ask your doctor it's okay to do the

946
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:03,360
cilantro ask your doctor if it's okay

947
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,039
to do a little atlantic dolls right and

948
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,720
ask your doctor it's okay to have some

949
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:10,000
coconut water in there too

950
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:11,919
or water you blend it up

951
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,360
and that's that's how you do it that's

952
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,039
what i would do for a family member if

953
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,799
this was happening to them that's how i

954
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:19,200
would do it so yeah you can still

955
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:20,960
do a portion of this cleanse without

956
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,919
having the fruit yes

957
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:25,840
joan um do you all get the heavy metals

958
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:28,880
tested periodically to see how

959
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:31,200
you're progressing it's going to be

960
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,960
totally misconceived it can be deceiving

961
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,760
joan when you have heavy metal testing

962
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,399
because

963
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,880
in the organ is where the metals are

964
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:39,919
they're in

965
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,760
they're in the organ blood testing

966
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:43,039
can't determine how much metal you have

967
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:46,559
inside your brain tissue or

968
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:47,919
your liver all that can do is determine

969
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:49,840
how much metal you have in your

970
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:52,640
bloodstream

971
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:54,320
and still it is inaccurate because there

972
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,679
could be more metal floating around in a

973
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,200
different part of your bloodstream than

974
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:58,960
the part they actually drew out of your

975
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,240
arm in that moment to get the to get the

976
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,600
test

977
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,960
so testing for metals is really your

978
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,919
symptoms

979
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,799
the personalization anxiety depression

980
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:12,559

lyme disease als that's your test

986
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,159
that's your test because all those go

987
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,840
away when people are doing the medical

988
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,399

test

998
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:51,039
not a blood test blood test is what just

999
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,039
gonna drain people more of their blood

1000
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,720
so that's important to know so you guys

1001
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,240
we're talking we're doing preparations

1002
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,799
of the heavy metal detox cleanse

1003
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,840
challenge

1004
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:01,840
i'm excited about can't say susan blonda

1005
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,919
my husband used to think that he was

1006
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,760
allergic to bananas oh my god so many

1007
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:08,800
people think they're allergic to fruit

1008
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:10,720
than bananas we switched to organic and

1009
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,520
it helped but we realized that the

1010
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:14,399
banana

1011
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:15,919
was killing off the strip in his sinuses

1012
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:18,879
so that was probably causing

1013
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:21,119
was fruit is a messenger it does cleanse

1014
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:22,720
and kill out bugs and it does cleanse

1015
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,800
out toxins so it is

1016
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,839
a messenger so that's what fruit is it's

1017
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,320
a messenger

1018
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:29,119
um let's talk about metals for a little

1019
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,399

this is an exciting time you guys i'm so

1038
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:13,040
pumped up about this i can't even tell

1039
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,720
you so where do we get medals let's do a

1040
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:18,000
quick rundown about that

1041
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:21,040
where you get metals copper pipes

1042
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:25,440
restaurants restaurants with copper

1043
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:27,599
pipes okay it's important to know

1044
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,359
restaurant water you didn't get coffee

1045
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:32,160
in a restaurant before

1046
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:33,599
tap water has copper in it and mercury

1047
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:36,800
and toxic heavy metals

1048
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:38,079
and lead and arsenic and then they run

1049
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,839
through copper pipes

1050
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:41,760
right that's one thing right there we

1051
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:45,200
have copper in our body

1052
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:47,520
so can we use kombu uh

1053
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:49,520
other algae instead of dols i'd rather

1054
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,800
have you not use dulce at all if if

1055
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,760
you're gonna switch and use something

1056
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,599
else

1057
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,800
i mean kombu is okay but it's not gonna

1058
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,480
get the metals out

1059
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,800
kelp is okay but it's not good to get

1060
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:01,920
the metals out they're good seaweeds

1061
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,800
right but they're not going to get the

1062
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,280
metals out

1063
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,960
so just i wouldn't even bother i would

1064
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,680
just keep it if you can't get the dust

1065
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,200
then

1066
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,200
then you don't have the dolls make sure

1067
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,760
you have everything else so copper is a

1068
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:15,520
big one if anybody has skin problems

1069
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,119
like eczema psoriasis they have copper

1070
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:20,160
in their system

1071
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:20,720
if anybody has any kind of neurological

1072
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:24,079
condition

1073
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:26,880
there's copper in their brain right

1074
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,680
stay away from copper thermoses copper

1075
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:31,280
mugs

1076
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:33,839
copper jewelry right stay away from

1077
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:35,359
copper copper clothing copper and

1078
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:39,200
clothing

1079
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:42,000
that's all bad really really bad

1080
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:43,560
it's important to know there so i got

1081
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:48,079
some copper here

1082
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:51,119
everybody has had food

1083
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:54,240
from metal pots and pans in restaurants

1084
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:56,560
they just scrape the bottom of the pots

1085
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:58,720
and pans like you can't even believe

1086
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:01,440
you wouldn't believe the gouges and the

1087
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:04,160
metal pots in all the restaurants

1088
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,760
restaurants around the world with their

1089
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,760
big cooking pots

1090
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,520
scrape you see you see the bottom of the

1091
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,359
pots and the lines in there and the

1092
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,359
grooves and the scrapes

1093
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:16,240
the amount of metal people get from

1094
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:19,359
cooking is off the charts right

1095
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:22,640
off the charts it's a little bit

1096
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:26,160

1100
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,920

liver causes problems short circuits the

1111
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,520

implants

1121
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:20,640
we can't avoid metal all the time

1122
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,560
but we have to get the metal that's

1123
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,480
floating around in our body and going

1124
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,440
into our brain in organs we have to get

1125
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,440
that out

1126
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,880
so if you got if you had dental work or

1127
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,839
you've got nuts and bolts holding your

1128
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,200
knee together

1129
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:33,040
if you've got nuts and bolts holding

1130
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,680
your hip or your foot together

1131
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:37,760
that's okay but we still have to get the

1132
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,800
residue that leeches out we have to get

1133
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,560

00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,359
it they taste metal because the liners

00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,359
always leak

1193
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:57,760

i'm sure you guys have tried the fish

1240
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:50,319
oil that's loaded with methyl mercury

1241
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:52,640
all the fish oil and this stuff

1242
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:53,760
keeps us sick and it keeps us down for a

1243
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:55,760
long time

1244
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,119
man that metal builds up it keeps us

1245
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:01,520
down for a long long time

1246
00:42:58,119 --> 00:43:04,400
medications right how about soda

1247
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:05,680
who's shrinking off the aluminum cans

1248
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:08,160
how to hide the brand again

1249
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,880
who's drinking off the aluminum cans

1250
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,440
you're just

1251
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:13,680
sucking off the top of there and then

1252
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,560
the fluid from inside the can gets on

1253
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,560
the lid in there

1254
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:18,560
as you're drinking it starts to dissolve

1255
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:20,880
that aluminum really quick

1256
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:22,560
so just in the course of you sipping and

1257
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,920
enjoying a beverage

1258
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,200
you're getting so much aluminum

1259
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,160
poisoning you couldn't even believe it

1260
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:30,079
it's off the charts

1261
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:33,200
not to mention the liner the liner

1262
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:35,200
the fraudulent liner breaks down

1263
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:37,040
in all the cans and a lot of cans don't

1264
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:39,599
even have a liner by the way

1265
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:40,560
don't even have a liner when your can

1266
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:42,880
gets cold

1267
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:44,880
it constricts right and when it

1268
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,720
constricts the line or breaks

1269
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,920
when your can gets warm from you holding

1270
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:51,280
it outside

1271
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:52,720
it's expands line or breaks liners

1272
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,240
aren't even they're not even being

1273
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,760
they're not even doing anything inside

1274
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,880
these so this is all important

1275
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,720
information

1276
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,280
and these are just some of the places we

1277
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:02,880
get metals and then the metals end up

1278
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,319
end up inside the liver but they end up

1279
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,400
inside every single organ

1280
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:08,079
inside the body and they end up inside

1281
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:10,720
the brain and then you get

1282
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:11,920
that sadness you just can't pin your put

1283
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,119
your finger on

1284
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,599
and then someone's going to tell you

1285
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:17,280
it's because you died in 1854

1286
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:19,040
and that was a past life that you were

1287
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,280
you you were queen victoria you had your

1288
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:22,720
head chopped off

1289
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:26,560
someone's going to say you were in some

1290
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:29,599
kind of like battle in 1604

1291
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:31,359
or in 800 a.d

1292
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:32,319
someone's going to say you're you know

1293
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,680
and that's what they're going to say

1294
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:35,200
because you can't pinpoint that

1295
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,240
depression that's sadness so they're

1296
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,520
you're going to be looking for all these

1297
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,800
answers because medical research and

1298
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,480
science is not going to know why you're

1299
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,640
sick with depression

1300
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:44,880
and anxiety and sadness you can't

1301
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:46,000
explain it's toxic heavy metals that sit

1302
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,319
in there how many people

1303
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,839
have been just they just don't know and

1304
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:50,960
the metals are inside their brain

1305
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:53,520
causing problems

1306
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:57,119
then they oxidize and then we eat the

1307
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:59,599
high fat diet so then we eat food

1308
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:02,160
and then we eat food and we accelerate

1309
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:04,319
we accelerate the metals

1310
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,920
they start to break down and oxidize and

1311
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:07,680
we eat food that breaks them down and

1312
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,960
oxidizes if you guys just came on here

1363
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:42,800

that's why depression goes away that's

1365
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,319
unexplainable depression

1366
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:48,319
i'm not talking about this depression

1367
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:51,119
from a horrible loss

1368
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:53,040
or a sad situation that happened the

1369
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:54,400
terrible loss of struggle emotional

1370
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:56,640

00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:59,920

1372
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:02,400
you out when there isn't such a thing

1373
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,440
pamela says i feel so tricked about fish

1374
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,319
oil oh my god

1375
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:07,760
pamela i i i i'll during the cleanse

1376
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:09,280
i'll go through it big time about the

1377
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,960
fish oil it's so bad

1378
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:14,160
i've been told if you have depression

1379
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:17,760
your brain needs more and more fish oil

1380
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:19,280
that's horrifying horrifying

1381
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,880
that will take you to a place of

1382
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:23,200
alzheimer's down the road

1383
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,240
so then when you're 75 years old and you

1384
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,839
got alzheimer's

1385
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:28,000
the doctors told you do more and more

1386
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:30,880
fish oil more more fish oil

1387
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,200
you know alternative doctors you name it

1388
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:36,640
so

1389
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:36,640
sad what about the things

1390
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,960
sorry i tried to read the comments you

1391
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,960
guys um

1392
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:45,520
what about the fillings in my mouth the

1393
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,160
heavy metal detox work so here's how it

1394
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:49,440
works

1395
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:51,280
if the fillings are leaching the heavy

1396
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:53,520
metal detox smoothie and cleanse

1397
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:55,200
helps to get that product that byproduct

1398
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:58,559
out that's leaching right

1399
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:58,559
so when you've got the mercury

1400
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:07,839
so when you got the mercury right

1401
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:07,839
it's important to um

1402
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:14,720
so when you get the mercury in your

1403
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:18,640
teeth right

1404
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:20,640
okay that mercury is leaching yeah

1405
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:22,319
and so what i tell people if you got a

1406
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,880
mercury filling it doesn't mean you have

1407
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:24,480
to get the

1408
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:26,559
mercury filling dug out if it's in

1409
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,680
perfect condition or it's in good

1410
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:30,160
condition

1411
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:31,119
right it you can keep the mercury

1412
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,559
filling in there

1413
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:33,920
but what you're doing is you're getting

1414
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:35,760
rid of when you're doing the heavy metal

1415
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:38,240
detox smoothie and cleanse

1416
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:40,240
you're getting rid of byproduct that's

1417
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:42,960
leaching from the fillings

1418
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:44,720
so the byproduct okay in your

1419
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,559
bloodstream and then goes to your brain

1420
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:47,680
and all that you're cleaning up all that

1421
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:49,680
mercury

1422
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:51,440
is what you're doing if you are to

1423
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:55,040
remove mercury fillings

1424
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:56,400
i always say do one at a time

1425
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:58,280
and i don't recommend taking them out

1426
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,960
unless they're broken or

1427
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:02,720
denatured or about to pop out or you got

1428
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:04,880
to crack in your tooth and they have to

1429
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:07,920
do it anyway

1430
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:09,520
you know because they dig out the

1431
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,040
mercury and then you you got more

1432
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:12,480
mercury you better be on the heavy metal

1433
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:14,880
detox smoothie if that's the case

1434
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:16,720
but yeah so that mercury gets in the

1435
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,920
brain that's what it does it gets in the

1436
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:20,720
brain

1437
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,720
that's what it does

1438
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:27,200
so we're doing the medical medium heavy

1439
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:29,599
metal detox

1440
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:31,119

doctors put out books and ph

1489
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:06,079
phds put out books and said your brain

1490
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:09,119
fog is from not being happy

1491
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:10,160
unbelievable i got very sick after

1492
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:11,760
removing my fillings

1493
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:13,839
yeah that's why i tell people you got to

1494
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:15,280
do one at a time if you ever do or don't

1495
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:16,960
do it at all unless they're broken and

1496
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,880
they need to come out

1497
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:20,319
or something's wrong but that's why it's

1498
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:22,160
so important do the heavy metal detox

1499
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:23,599
cleanse clean that out that's the whole

1500
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:26,559
thing to get all that stuff

1501
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:26,880
out and and if you're getting fillings

1502
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:28,480
out

1503
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:30,000
space them out space them out with

1504
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:32,640
enough time and talk about that medical

1505
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,640
medium books

1506
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:37,839
so what's the goal the goal is

1507
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,520
if you're if you're not even

1508
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:40,800
experiencing a symptom the goal is to

1509
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,559
get the metals out so you never

1510
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,839
experience a symptom

1511
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:47,440
the goal is to get the metals out if

1512
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:47,440
you're experiencing symptoms too

1513
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:52,800
ip1 says i got 11 mercury 11 mercury

old caps out in the last five years now

1516
00:51:55,599 --> 00:52:01,119
i'm dealing with eczema dermatitis and

1517
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:04,160
psoriasis you also have copper

1518
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:07,280
in your system too

1519
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:11,599
copper as well and that's here

1520
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:15,200
i highly highly highly recommend

1521
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:16,480
avoid copper products copper thermoses

1522
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:19,920
copper mugs

1523
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:22,880
copper jewelry copper copper clothing

1524
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:23,359
highly recommended it's toxic and you're

1525
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:26,720
being

1526
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:26,720
totally screwed over

1527
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:32,640
i highly recommend you avoid fish oil

1528
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:34,160
with everything you got this stuff is

1529
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:36,240
methylmercury

1530
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:38,880
the homeopathic version of mercury it's

1531
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:40,400
worse than eating fish

1532
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:42,960
i highly recommend you don't do

1533
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:47,839
bentonite clay and zeolite and

1534
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:47,839
charcoal highly recommend you avoid

1535
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:52,640
avoid i know some of you say no there's

1536
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:54,720
good literature and data on

1537
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:57,040
copper thermoses and copper being good

1538
00:52:54,720 --> 00:53:00,000
for you you're wrong you're being misled

1539
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:03,359
by that data

1540
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:06,800
copper is so toxic right

1541
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:08,640
that it does kill a certain amoeba

1542
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:10,880
that was in the water that caused

1543
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:11,680
dysentery thousands of years ago so they

1544
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:14,319
used to put

1545
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:15,839
water because they didn't have access to

1546
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:18,880
water thousands of years ago

1547
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:20,640
so they used in many many cultures they

1548
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,680
didn't have access to water for clean

1549
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:24,160
fresh running water

1550
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:25,280
so in order to keep water still meaning

1551
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:28,160
without it going real

1552
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:28,960
rancid they used to put it in copper big

1553
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:32,480
copper

1554
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:34,319
uh vaults right to keep the watch so

1555
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:36,400
that the copper would poison

1556
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:38,640
any kind of critter in there like any

1557
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,839
kind of big parasite or amiibos really

1558
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:42,559
amoebas

1559
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:43,520
amoebas don't like copper but at the

1560
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:45,200
same time

1561
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:47,040
the people poisoned themselves by

1562
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:48,640
drinking that water but yet they needed

1563
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,440
water so they had to drink the copper

1564
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:51,280
poison

1565
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:52,480
you don't have to drink copper poison

1566
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:55,200
why are you being tricked to drink

1567
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:58,400
copper poisonous water now

1568
00:53:55,200 --> 00:54:00,319
you can find water without amoebas in it

1569
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:02,319
it was a survival tactic thousands of

1570
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:03,359
years ago doesn't mean if you need to do

1571
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:04,960
it now

1572
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:07,520
why do you have to poison yourselves

1573
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:09,040
with copper copper mugs and stuff

1574
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:10,559
like why do you have to poison yourself

1575
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:12,720
with copper uh

1576
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:14,480
you know with copper mugs and everything

1577
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:16,800
right

1578
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,760
like let me just drink out of a copper

1579
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:19,599
mug

1580
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,960
because i want to be like it's 3 000

1581
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:21,839
years ago when they didn't have any

1582
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:24,240
fresh water

1583
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:27,440
and they all got copper poisoning so

1584
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:30,079
they wouldn't die from an amoeba

1585
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:32,079
that's not your life now you can get

1586
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:33,839
water and not have an amoeba in that

1587
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:36,400
water

1588
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:38,559
and you can avoid the copper poisoning

1589
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:40,000
that shortened everybody's life

1590
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:42,079
yeah they were able to drink a little

1591
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,839
bit more water but they also died young

1592
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:46,000
because of the copper poisoning so why

1593
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:48,240

metals out of your organs

00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:10,400
metals is how the tattoo ink

1661
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:13,359
pops you can't see

1662
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:14,079
them tattooing clear unless light

1663
00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:17,200
reflects

1664
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:20,319
against metal your vegan ink is loaded

1665
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:22,960
with toxic heavy metals

1666
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:24,079
that's how that you can see the tattoo

1667
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:27,119
it's from the light

1668
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:27,920
popping it the light has to reflect off

1669
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:29,760
the metal

1670
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:31,520
if you don't have metal in the ink in

00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:44,079

1706
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:46,640
um i am going to get better do they come

1707
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:50,000
out with laser removal it doesn't mean

1708
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:53,599
you have to do

1709
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:55,440
your attack you have to remove tattoos

1710
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:57,040
to get the metal out you have to be

1711
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:59,680
doing you have to be pro

1712
00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:00,240
proactive and getting the metals out of

1713
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:02,799
your brain

1714
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:04,160
you can get your tattoos lasered off but

1715
00:59:02,799 --> 00:59:07,200
you're gonna still have all the

1716
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:10,559
ink the metal in your organs and

1717
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:12,640
the laser doesn't remove the metals

1718
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:15,760
it doesn't remove the metals in your

1719
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:18,240
skin it's gonna still be in there

1720
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:20,640
the laser just makes the tattoo

1721
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:23,040
disappear over time

1722
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:23,920
but the metals though they disperse and

1723
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:26,319
they're still going to be

1724
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:27,119
deep within the derma push down deep in

1725
00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:28,880
the derma

1726
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:30,960
the point is it's okay if you have

1727
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:32,000
tattoos you just have to clean the

1728
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:34,720
metals out of the brain

1729
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,920
where the tattoo ink eventually disapp

1730
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:39,200
what happens is

1731
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:41,119
over time the tattoo ink leeches metals

1732
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:42,720
and gets to your brain every single day

1733
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:44,839
from the first day you got it into your

1734
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:45,520
bloodstream when they did it this is

1735
00:59:44,839 --> 00:59:48,400
this is

1736
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:50,160
it and it's okay but we're doing the

1737

little while and they

1832
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:15,280

1833
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:17,200
the difference

1834
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:18,880

have access to a heavy metal detox movie

1838
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:26,880
