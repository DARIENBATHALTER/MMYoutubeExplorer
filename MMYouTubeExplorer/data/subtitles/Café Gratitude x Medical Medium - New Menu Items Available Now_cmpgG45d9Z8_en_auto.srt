1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:03,959
so true give me the uh load down on this

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,319
on some of the masterful work that

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:08,880
you've done with the medical medium

4
00:00:05,319 --> 00:00:10,559
dishes I know they're no oil no nuts

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,679
which is incredible all on its own

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,719
glutenfree soy free soy free and easy on

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,160
the salt exactly so tell me a little bit

8
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:20,359
about how like working with those

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,760
parameters and everything well I mean it

10
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:23,840
was like I said it was a great

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,800
opportunity to look at cooking in a new

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,240
way so it was and and to look for

13
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,359
alternatives to the traditional flavor

14
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,759
builders that we usually use in food um

15
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:33,360
as you know part of the collaboration

16
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:34,920
that we have here is that we assign

17
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,520
affirmation names to all of our food

18
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,399
which actually helps the healing process

19
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:41,760
in our opinion um and mine too yeah

20
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:44,200
right it is a good thing so here we have

21
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,360
imys which is our green papaya and kelp

22
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,120
noodle salad um with a coconut based

23
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:51,160
dressing and lots of Thai spices and

24
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,879
herbs here we've got the I Am Noble for

25
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,600
the noble potato because it's the spicy

26
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,800
potato burrito bowl with your cheese

27
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,480
sauce and the potato is Noble for sure

28
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,519
exactly and a healing food a lot of

29
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,280
people don't know that so that's really

30
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:03,440
powerful the name goes perfect with it

31
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,920
right there and we've got a black bean

32
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,680
picadillo that goes with that and then

33
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,000
some water sauteed kale and some great

34
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,400
Pico deallo W you got the kale that's

35
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,400
incredible to got some greens in there

36
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,280
to sort of lighten it up a bit and so

37
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:18,159
this is I am trustworthy which is your

38
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,119
uh original portabello and uh pepper

39
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,600
fajita dish we've dressed it up with a

40
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:24,720
little bit of lemon marinated red onions

41
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,560
some guacamole and some P DEA with a

42
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,479
squeeze of lime as well and we serve it

43
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,600
with the Millet tortillas which are I

44
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,920
think you're sort of famous for those

45
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,600
right you can see it's the Perfect Blend

46
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,159
and you got the Millet tortilla you can

47
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,680
put a little bit of guacamole in there

48
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:40,520
you can put a little bit of the onion in

49
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,600
there you can make it the way you want

50
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,119
it that's incredible and then it becomes

51
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,960
like finger food then you have in your

52
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:48,360
hands you can enjoy it then you can add

53
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,280
a little bit more that's exciting I'm

54
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,560
actually I can't wait that's the first

55
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,119
thing I go to is that right there cuz I

56
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,719
want those little tortillas in my hand

57
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:58,880
and I want to put a little bit of that

58
00:01:55,719 --> 00:02:00,360
guacamole and you know your guacamole

59
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,360
that's a whole different kind of

60
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,479
guacamole and I know that because I've

61
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,479
tried guacamole in different places and

62
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,840
Cafe Gratitude guacamole is another

63
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,440
level it actually has flavor and that's

64
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,520
the key well in part of the affirmation

65
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,040
healing you can trust that everything in

66
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,440
this plate is going to be good for the

67
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,200
body right so that's what we're calling

68
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,959
it

69
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,959
trustworthy and the last one that we're

70
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:22,840
having as part of the menu here is the I

71
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:25,280
am insightful which is a jasmine rice an

72
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,680
organic jasmine rice vegetable Sushi we

73
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,319
serve it with uh pumpkin seed tofu which

74
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,239
is something that I think is a really

75
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:34,480
great sort alternative another whole

76
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:36,360
food avocado some vegetables carrots

77
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,959
cabbage and also some cucumber in there

78
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,200
as well you got the zinc and the Pumpkin

79
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:43,159
Seed so there's just there's healing

80
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,760
there's all kinds of different aspects

81
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:46,400
of these dishes that are healing in oh I

82
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,599
want to go to the papaya which is

83
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,400
incredible you're not using the Hawaiian

84
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:53,440
papaya no that is mindblowing right

85
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,239
there because you know like just if

86
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,159
somebody's going to use papaya it always

87
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:59,640
seems to be the Hawaiian papaya and I'm

88
00:02:57,159 --> 00:03:02,959
like no this is incredible so you got

89
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:05,599
the shredded papaya and that's IM Amy

90
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,040
yes we we work with Organics pretty much

91
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:10,120
exclusively and I believe under the

92
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,519
organic certifications you can't have

93
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,920
the genetically modified papaya so

94
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:15,480
that's why we don't go with the Hawaiian

95
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,319
one unfortunately but that's just the

96
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,920
reality it's just the reality of it oh

97
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:20,879
we forgot the precious the uh wild

98
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,879
blueberry and cherry smoothie there it

99
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,159
is right there an mm smoothie okay and

100
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:26,879
that's the wild blueberry that's the

101
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:29,840
Cherry people are going to love the

102
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:32,360
flavor it's B orang juice oh it's so

103
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,319
good and so so rich but yet so light

104
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:38,360
you're satiated but you won't leave like

105
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:40,319
we're feeling real heavy and greasy and

106
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:42,959
all that it's absolutely not absolutely

107
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,560
not just healing food people can fill up

108
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,560
get satiated and then they can do

109
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,040
whatever they need to do they're

110
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,599
workouts they can go to the beach

111
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,799
whatever they got to do live their life

112
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:53,400
but they got the best food purest forms

113
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:54,959
they don't have the uh the nuts and the

114
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,599
oils and I'm not saying that like nuts

115
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,879
are terrible or anything like that it's

116
00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:01,879
just that these are breaking those rules

117
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:04,280
it's like the no oil the no soy the no

118
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:06,280
gluten the no nuts and then the easy on

119
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,040
the salt I mean it's mind-blowing well

120
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,720
the more the more guidelines that we can

121
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,519
follow here the the more people we can

122
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,280
bring into this way of eating right so

123
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,640
if somebody wants to eat healthier but

124
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,919
can't eat nuts then half of the menu you

125
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,400
know is not going to be available in

126
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:19,919
this case they can have the whole thing

127
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,759
there's no nothing that they don't have

128
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:25,320
to uh not have you know I challenge

129
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:27,160
