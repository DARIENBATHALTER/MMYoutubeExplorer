[0.32 - 3.84] okay a couple things to cover i'm gonna
[1.92 - 5.68] be talking about blood again
[3.84 - 7.52] what happens when you get your blood
[5.68 - 9.20] drawn i didn't cover

[232.40 - 235.92] before we get started talking about
[233.76 - 239.44] blood and everything else
[235.92 - 241.92] um readers continue
[239.44 - 243.28] to introduce more and more healthcare
[241.92 - 246.32] providers to this
[243.28 - 248.40] book and it has prompted
[246.32 - 250.56] a new movement to look for the deeper
[248.40 - 251.84] causes of chronic illness and to take
[250.56 - 256.24] epstein-barr
[251.84 - 257.68] virus seriously prior to the publication
[256.24 - 261.68] of medical medium
[257.68 - 264.28] the first edition right ebv
[261.68 - 265.84] epstein-barr virus was practically a
[264.28 - 267.52] non-concern
[265.84 - 269.12] medical communities didn't understand
[267.52 - 272.08] what the virus could do
[269.12 - 273.68] because for example medical research and
[272.08 - 276.24] science were unaware
[273.68 - 278.40] that epstein-barr virus creates symptoms
[276.24 - 278.88] that led to neurological problems you
[278.40 - 280.84] guys
[278.88 - 282.40] neurological problems caused by
[280.84 - 284.56] epstein-barr
[282.40 - 287.28] medical medium was ahead of the curve
[284.56 - 289.84] there not one single doctor
[287.28 - 290.88] on planet earth nor did medical research
[289.84 - 293.12] and science know
[290.88 - 294.24] that epstein-barr led to a neurological
[293.12 - 296.80] symptom
[294.24 - 298.00] and medical medium book one brought that
[296.80 - 301.52] truth out
[298.00 - 304.64] um very special okay
[301.52 - 306.24] now epstein-barr virus testing and
[304.64 - 309.52] awareness are becoming
[306.24 - 310.16] every day at the doctor's office because
[309.52 - 313.68] of little
[310.16 - 315.60] me well spirit of compassion really i
[313.68 - 317.44] can't take credit
[315.60 - 319.76] research and science are finally
[317.44 - 322.24] starting to find a link
[319.76 - 323.04] between epstein-barr virus and dozens of
[322.24 - 326.32] conditions
[323.04 - 328.80] after the publication years after
[326.32 - 330.40] research and science are finding a link
[328.80 - 333.28] so when someone says where's your
[330.40 - 335.04] science where's your science
[333.28 - 336.96] where's your science medical medium
[335.04 - 338.72] where's your study well how about this
[336.96 - 341.12] medical research and science is taking
[338.72 - 342.88] all my information and using it
[341.12 - 344.56] they take it after medical medium
[342.88 - 346.08] publishes a book and then medical
[344.56 - 346.48] research and science a couple years
[346.08 - 349.12] later
[346.48 - 350.16] takes it and plagiarizes the information
[349.12 - 352.08] so stop saying
[350.16 - 354.00] where's your science because really
[352.08 - 356.00] where's their science well it's here
[354.00 - 358.32] they're taking it from here and using it
[356.00 - 360.16] anyway it's just fun
[358.32 - 362.00] and that's the truth medical medium new
[360.16 - 364.08] edition it's out you guys i'm making

[378.88 - 383.68] times a doctor friend of mine says
[380.40 - 385.68] you got to be a genius you have to be
[383.68 - 387.04] in order to write medical books that
[385.68 - 390.16] research in science
[387.04 - 391.60] steals after the fact you have to be a
[390.16 - 394.80] genius and i'm like
[391.60 - 395.92] i ain't no genius it's spirit of
[394.80 - 398.96] compassion
[395.92 - 399.68] um anyway you guys i'm gonna make mango

[443.04 - 446.96] and just so you know it's all
[444.08 - 449.04] misinformation leslie

[449.04 - 453.92] of tongue
[450.00 - 456.96] throat etc all right so here's the thing
[453.92 - 459.76] there's always a food that gives
[456.96 - 460.80] somebody a swelling in their mouth some
[459.76 - 463.84] people swell
[460.80 - 465.76] when they eat um anything doesn't matter
[463.84 - 468.16] what it is whether they eat a carrot
[465.76 - 470.24] okay you talk to people someone's always
[468.16 - 472.08] gonna say i'm i can't eat a carrot i
[470.24 - 473.68] either get swelling in the mouth or
[472.08 - 474.96] something happens or
[473.68 - 476.24] someone's gonna have a problem with a
[474.96 - 477.52] celery stick someone's gonna have a
[476.24 - 479.20] problem with a zucchini
[477.52 - 480.56] someone has a problem with apple you
[479.20 - 482.96] would think apples
[480.56 - 485.04] anybody can eat an apple everybody can
[482.96 - 485.60] eat an apple there's always someone
[485.04 - 488.08] that's like
[485.60 - 490.24] my mouth something happens in my mouth
[488.08 - 492.24] or my throat when i eat an apple right
[490.24 - 493.84] the one out of a hundred thousand people
[492.24 - 495.60] or whatever it is
[493.84 - 497.76] it's like that and there's people i eat
[495.60 - 498.48] a piece of cheese and i get a swelling
[497.76 - 501.28] in my mouth
[498.48 - 503.20] i eat an egg and then my face blows up i
[501.28 - 504.88] eat you know i hear this all the time
[503.20 - 507.60] it's every single food
[504.88 - 509.04] on the planet someone's gonna have
[507.60 - 510.80] something to it right
[509.04 - 512.56] but when they have a little problem with
[510.80 - 515.20] the tomato it's because of tomatoes a
[512.56 - 517.52] nightshade and it's a really bad tomato
[515.20 - 519.52] you know tomatoes are really bad but
[517.52 - 521.36] they're not bad and that swelling may
[519.52 - 522.80] stop someday and you may not have a
[521.36 - 523.84] reaction but you but i'm going to give
[522.80 - 525.44] i'm going to help you to be your own
[523.84 - 528.72] private detective right
[525.44 - 532.16] is it to is it a tomato by itself
[528.72 - 535.68] is it a fresh ripe organic tomato
[532.16 - 537.36] by itself right that does it
[535.68 - 539.12] that's one question right there and if
[537.36 - 540.24] you're getting a swelling don't eat them
[539.12 - 542.56] don't eat them
[540.24 - 543.28] um so that's one thing to know or is it
[542.56 - 546.56] tomato
[543.28 - 547.28] sauce mixed with canola oil is it some
[546.56 - 550.00] tomato
[547.28 - 550.56] treat that's got natural flavoring in it
[550.00 - 554.16] is it
[550.56 - 556.32] is it tomato with cheese is it tomato
[554.16 - 558.32] cheese some kind of parmesan is it
[556.32 - 561.44] lasagna and it's the tomato
[558.32 - 563.36] like whatever it is is it ketchup
[561.44 - 564.48] and you're having this problem or don't
[563.36 - 565.60] or you don't have the problem with
[564.48 - 567.28] ketchup so
[565.60 - 568.88] all these things are just questions to
[567.28 - 570.24] kind of look at right there so that's
[568.88 - 572.24] number one
[570.24 - 573.68] do you swell with any other food that's
[572.24 - 575.04] another question ask yourself to be your
[573.68 - 576.16] own detective and i tell this for
[575.04 - 577.76] everybody
[576.16 - 579.68] like anybody who swells want to eat a
[577.76 - 580.96] carrot because i i've run into that all
[579.68 - 582.96] the time people like i can't touch
[580.96 - 586.16] carrots i can't touch carrot juice
[582.96 - 589.04] my mouth swells up it is it is it
[586.16 - 590.80] you know that's so is it any other food
[589.04 - 591.36] no other food swells up your mouth on
[590.80 - 593.44] any level
[591.36 - 595.12] not one other food you can eat anything
[593.44 - 597.92] doesn't matter pork fish
[595.12 - 598.64] chicken you know eggs whatever you can
[597.92 - 601.36] glam
[598.64 - 601.68] uh you know milk cheese butter not just
[601.36 - 603.76] that
[601.68 - 605.76] any vegetable anything there is right
[603.76 - 607.20] any fruit the only thing that makes you
[605.76 - 608.64] swell is tomatoes that's the next thing
[607.20 - 610.00] you kind of kind of kind of
[608.64 - 612.16] kind of got to look at and be your own
[610.00 - 613.92] detective i say this for everyone who
[612.16 - 615.36] swells to something i see people who
[613.92 - 617.44] have a problem eating cauliflower
[615.36 - 619.44] i see people who can't touch a lemon i
[617.44 - 620.48] see people have you know it's all that
[619.44 - 621.92] kind of stuff so
[620.48 - 623.60] check out all those different things so
[621.92 - 624.00] what i would do if i was swelling and it
[623.60 - 626.16] was
[624.00 - 628.00] tomato and i had a mouth swell from
[626.16 - 630.64] tomato itself
[628.00 - 632.00] i would get rid of other things in my
[630.64 - 632.88] that i was eating i would get rid of
[632.00 - 636.00] milk cheese
[632.88 - 637.68] butter gluten eggs gone i would look out
[636.00 - 639.28] to make sure i was doing no msg no
[637.68 - 641.20] natural flavors in anything
[639.28 - 642.56] no apple cider vinegar no nutritional
[641.20 - 645.60] yeast and no caffeine
[642.56 - 647.04] get rid of all that then and i would
[645.60 - 647.84] even probably get rid of chocolate and
[647.04 - 649.92] then
[647.84 - 652.40] after about a month being free from all
[649.92 - 654.32] that you try a piece of tomato
[652.40 - 655.76] if you want or your doctor wants you to
[654.32 - 657.28] you ask your doctor what's right for you
[655.76 - 658.00] but that's what i would do if it was for
[657.28 - 659.20] me
[658.00 - 661.84] that's what i would do because what
[659.20 - 664.96] happens is tomatoes
[661.84 - 668.00] are anti-viral and for some people
[664.96 - 669.12] they do some serious viral like
[668.00 - 672.24] cleansing
[669.12 - 674.40] even viral killing and when that happens
[672.24 - 675.52] you could have an h pylori in your gut
[674.40 - 676.32] and the reason why you're getting
[675.52 - 678.24] swelling
[676.32 - 680.16] is because the tomatoes starting to
[678.24 - 682.00] whack that h pylori you can have a
[680.16 - 684.24] little streptococcus in your gut
[682.00 - 685.68] e coli and that tomatoes whacking that
[684.24 - 687.12] strep and that e coli
[685.68 - 689.36] so i just want to cover it's a really
[687.12 - 691.04] good topic i love when someone brings it
[689.36 - 693.76] up so i can help other people
[691.04 - 695.36] awesome okay you guys let's start making
[693.76 - 696.56] some stuff we'll talk about blood draw
[695.36 - 700.16] too
[696.56 - 703.28] so um when it comes down to blood draw
[700.16 - 703.68] all right you have to know that they
[703.28 - 706.96] take
[703.68 - 707.68] too much blood for what they're looking
[706.96 - 710.88] for
[707.68 - 712.08] they throw all the blood away they take
[710.88 - 713.76] a little bit of blood
[712.08 - 715.44] they draw a nice tube of it and they
[713.76 - 717.12] take a little bit of blood and they
[715.44 - 720.16] throw it they discard it
[717.12 - 721.44] at least you think they're throwing it
[720.16 - 724.48] away
[721.44 - 726.24] what if they're not throwing it away i
[724.48 - 728.16] was talking to someone the other day
[726.24 - 731.36] because they heard me talking about this
[728.16 - 732.80] and they're like well you know aw what
[731.36 - 734.48] if they're not throwing it away
[732.80 - 736.16] i said yeah they could be using that
[734.48 - 738.56] stuff for genetic testing meaning
[736.16 - 741.28] genetic messing
[738.56 - 743.36] playing with genes they can be using
[741.28 - 746.48] that stuff for a lot of reasons
[743.36 - 750.16] absolutely because why else would they
[746.48 - 753.60] ask this why else aw would they be
[750.16 - 754.80] drawing so much blood they don't need to
[753.60 - 758.00] draw
[754.80 - 761.04] why would they do that if they weren't
[758.00 - 763.36] using it for something that was somebody
[761.04 - 766.48] asking me that question right
[763.36 - 769.60] i was like hey hey who knows who knows
[766.48 - 771.20] okay that's right no one does anything
[769.60 - 772.08] dirty and horrible out there oh that's
[771.20 - 773.76] right
[772.08 - 776.00] science of research never did anything
[773.76 - 777.84] wrong oh that's right they're angels
[776.00 - 780.00] everybody who works for them is angels
[777.84 - 780.64] the people at the top they're all angels
[780.00 - 782.24] anyway
[780.64 - 783.68] let's talk about blood draw okay
[782.24 - 785.28] everything else is rotten in the world
[783.68 - 786.32] there's corruption everywhere but not
[785.28 - 787.60] there
[786.32 - 790.32] let's talk about this now we'll go to
[787.60 - 792.08] page 197 right here so
[790.32 - 793.92] it's all interesting stuff you know it
[792.08 - 797.28] makes you think really and that's that's
[793.92 - 798.64] that's something too kind of giving you
[797.28 - 801.76] i'm in the new book right now if you
[798.64 - 804.80] just got here all right
[801.76 - 808.64] so i'm in a new book
[804.80 - 811.52] and we're having some fun so
[808.64 - 812.32] i'm in page 197 on the medical medium
[811.52 - 813.76] new edition
[812.32 - 815.76] just so you guys know i'm talking about
[813.76 - 818.72] blood draw information
[815.76 - 819.60] and it's important to know that that
[818.72 - 822.80] when you get
[819.60 - 825.92] your blood test ask your doctor for less
[822.80 - 828.48] blood go in there more frequently or go
[825.92 - 829.92] to the to the blood lab place more
[828.48 - 832.72] frequently
[829.92 - 834.48] um and be cautious to how much now if i
[832.72 - 836.88] was gonna get blood work
[834.48 - 837.60] you know i wouldn't let more than three
[836.88 - 840.16] vials
[837.60 - 841.52] out the gate that's that's for for you
[840.16 - 844.80] know what i would do
[841.52 - 846.48] and i would even do two vials so you
[844.80 - 848.00] tell your doctor get what you can get
[846.48 - 850.72] out of two vials
[848.00 - 851.76] get what you can get out of three vials
[850.72 - 854.72] right
[851.76 - 856.08] and then i'll come back another day
[854.72 - 859.36] because what happens is
[856.08 - 862.40] your white count is in that blood
[859.36 - 865.52] your white count is keeping all of your
[862.40 - 867.56] autoimmune in check because everybody's
[865.52 - 870.08] going to be diagnosed with autoimmune
[867.56 - 870.88] everybody out there i don't care who it
[870.08 - 874.24] is
[870.88 - 876.72] eventually mark my words every
[874.24 - 878.48] single human on this planet is going to
[876.72 - 880.56] get an autoimmune diagnosis
[878.48 - 881.68] as the years go by just telling you
[880.56 - 885.04] right now
[881.68 - 885.60] some earlier than later some later than
[885.04 - 888.80] earlier
[885.60 - 889.60] all depends so i want to show you some
[888.80 - 892.64] stuff here so
[889.60 - 895.44] anyway this is
[892.64 - 896.56] um a white blood cell okay that's your
[895.44 - 899.60] white blood cell
[896.56 - 902.64] so it's floating around in your
[899.60 - 905.92] bloodstream that's a virus
[902.64 - 908.96] okay the viruses they
[905.92 - 910.72] mainly stay inside your organs and i
[908.96 - 912.24] know that some people will say
[910.72 - 914.00] wait a minute if you're getting your
[912.24 - 916.64] blood drawn out and your white
[914.00 - 917.60] count your killer cells are all being
[916.64 - 921.44] taken out
[917.60 - 924.24] because you're taking 5 7 10 12 14 vials
[921.44 - 926.00] and it's being taken out right well the
[924.24 - 928.00] viruses that are in your bloodstream
[926.00 - 930.16] they're going to be taken out too with
[928.00 - 931.92] it so it's kind of one for one tip for a
[930.16 - 933.84] tat right or equal ground
[931.92 - 936.16] you're taking just as much white count
[933.84 - 938.40] out as you're taking viruses out
[936.16 - 939.76] so you end up with less viruses you end
[938.40 - 942.08] up with less immune system
[939.76 - 943.60] we're okay cancels out each other not
[942.08 - 946.64] how it works
[943.60 - 948.00] not how it works at all the viruses they
[946.64 - 950.64] live inside your liver
[948.00 - 952.00] they live inside your organs they live
[950.64 - 954.32] inside your spleen
[952.00 - 956.08] they live inside your pancreas they live
[954.32 - 959.84] inside the intestinal
[956.08 - 963.04] linings they live inside
[959.84 - 966.24] tissue all through the body okay
[963.04 - 967.60] and they live on nerves they even live
[966.24 - 969.28] on nerves
[967.60 - 970.80] vagus neurophrenic nerve all kinds of
[969.28 - 974.16] nerves right
[970.80 - 975.28] but and your white count is swimming
[974.16 - 980.32] around
[975.28 - 983.36] making sure making sure
[980.32 - 984.00] that that virus doesn't get out of the
[983.36 - 986.16] gate
[984.00 - 987.84] so when the virus wants to peek its head
[986.16 - 990.32] out of your out of your liver
[987.84 - 990.88] and it wants to make a run for it to
[990.32 - 993.92] then
[990.88 - 997.20] blow up and explode meaning blow up and
[993.92 - 999.20] and and proliferate and start to spread
[997.20 - 1000.24] what it does your white count is keeping
[999.20 - 1001.68] all that in check
[1000.24 - 1004.00] so the white counts going through your
[1001.68 - 1005.68] bloodstream hey you want to peek out of
[1004.00 - 1007.60] the liver today you're not gonna
[1005.68 - 1010.08] just just starts to tear apart that
[1007.60 - 1012.08] virus the virus wants to pop out
[1010.08 - 1013.92] of your spleen the white count is
[1012.08 - 1016.48] swimming around in your bloodstream
[1013.92 - 1018.24] finds it tears it down keeps it down
[1016.48 - 1020.00] your viruses because everybody's got
[1018.24 - 1022.64] viruses inside of them
[1020.00 - 1024.88] know that there's an armed guard always
[1022.64 - 1026.88] in the bloodstream floating around
[1024.88 - 1028.16] floating around and there's things that
[1026.88 - 1029.92] drop our immune system
[1028.16 - 1031.52] lots of things there's betrayal broken
[1029.92 - 1033.52] trust broken heart
[1031.52 - 1035.92] hardship emotional abuse emotional
[1033.52 - 1038.24] hardship all of that knocks down
[1035.92 - 1040.08] the immune system adrenaline fight or
[1038.24 - 1042.56] flight caffeine
[1040.08 - 1043.92] really hits the immune system hard right
[1042.56 - 1045.44] so there's all this stuff that hits the
[1043.92 - 1047.52] immune system and then we're not eating
[1045.44 - 1048.80] foods that build up our immune system
[1047.52 - 1052.72] right
[1048.80 - 1055.20] and then then the worst of all
[1052.72 - 1056.24] the blood tests that's when they take
[1055.20 - 1059.28] your immune system
[1056.24 - 1060.24] out of your body and then it takes weeks
[1059.28 - 1062.40] and sometimes
[1060.24 - 1065.44] months to get your immune system back up
[1062.40 - 1067.92] to par they pull all that blood out
[1065.44 - 1069.60] right they pull all that blood out which
[1067.92 - 1072.72] is your white count
[1069.60 - 1074.16] and then the viruses they got free game
[1072.72 - 1076.88] and then that means a couple of months
[1074.16 - 1078.72] later my lupus is worse or i just got
[1076.88 - 1079.60] diagnosed with lupus and i never had it
[1078.72 - 1082.16] before
[1079.60 - 1083.04] or now my hashimoto's is going to a new
[1082.16 - 1085.60] level
[1083.04 - 1087.04] and i want to talk about this in regards
[1085.60 - 1088.64] to cancer
[1087.04 - 1090.16] this is important when it comes down to
[1088.64 - 1092.16] cancer okay
[1090.16 - 1094.24] getting large blood draws constantly
[1092.16 - 1097.60] because of cancer
[1094.24 - 1100.48] it's a nightmare a nightmare
[1097.60 - 1101.68] and i mean i have a you know family
[1100.48 - 1104.88] friend
[1101.68 - 1107.20] family friend right say like you know
[1104.88 - 1108.40] what do we do what do we do like you get
[1107.20 - 1110.16] small
[1108.40 - 1111.44] you know this is you you do what your
[1110.16 - 1112.56] doctor tells you okay whatever your
[1111.44 - 1114.48] doctor tells you it's what you do but
[1112.56 - 1118.16] this is what i told family friend
[1114.48 - 1122.32] small blood vials periodically
[1118.16 - 1124.64] versus larger ones you know at one time
[1122.32 - 1126.00] because when it comes down to cancer you
[1124.64 - 1127.92] need your white count
[1126.00 - 1130.00] you need it to be strong and you need it
[1127.92 - 1131.60] to be actually keeping things in check
[1130.00 - 1133.84] and under control
[1131.60 - 1135.04] really important really important so i'm
[1133.84 - 1136.00] going to read just a little bit out of
[1135.04 - 1139.28] medical medium right
[1136.00 - 1142.96] here for a second
[1139.28 - 1142.96] okay you guys and um
[1143.28 - 1148.64] when you have autoimmune when you have
[1145.84 - 1148.64] autoimmune
[1148.84 - 1153.36] um of any kind
[1151.04 - 1154.24] eczema psoriasis hashimoto's thyroiditis
[1153.36 - 1156.40] ra lupus
[1154.24 - 1157.92] ms lyme disease lyme disease now now is
[1156.40 - 1159.20] autoimmune it's not bacterial
[1157.92 - 1161.04] thanks to this book right here if you
[1159.20 - 1162.72] guys just came on here this book has
[1161.04 - 1164.24] changed how they view lyme disease now
[1162.72 - 1166.72] medical research and science took the
[1164.24 - 1168.56] cue from the book
[1166.72 - 1170.16] took the information and now lyme
[1168.56 - 1171.12] disease is in the autoimmune category
[1170.16 - 1174.56] which means viral
[1171.12 - 1176.80] which isn't bacterial anymore and
[1174.56 - 1178.32] so any kind of condition you get
[1176.80 - 1180.16] diagnosed with
[1178.32 - 1181.76] and say you're not diagnosed with a
[1180.16 - 1183.20] condition you guys say you're not
[1181.76 - 1184.96] there's no diagnoses
[1183.20 - 1186.40] tingles and numbness you got a little
[1184.96 - 1188.64] vertigo dizziness
[1186.40 - 1189.60] focus and concentration maybe you can't
[1188.64 - 1191.28] see good you know
[1189.60 - 1192.88] something's going on there whatever it
[1191.28 - 1196.16] is that's happening in your
[1192.88 - 1197.60] life whatever it is okay whatever
[1196.16 - 1199.04] symptoms migraines
[1197.60 - 1201.04] body aches and pains a little bit
[1199.04 - 1203.44] fatigue all can worsen
[1201.04 - 1204.48] all of it anxiety i've seen people get
[1203.44 - 1206.32] too much blood drawn
[1204.48 - 1207.68] and their anxiety becomes from from
[1206.32 - 1211.28] level 1
[1207.68 - 1214.32] to level 10 and now they're crippled
[1211.28 - 1217.36] crippled with anxiety because
[1214.32 - 1220.80] when you remove your immune system
[1217.36 - 1223.12] it takes time to rebuild it over again
[1220.80 - 1223.84] and there's not a lot of quick ways to
[1223.12 - 1225.76] do it
[1223.84 - 1228.16] because no one's going to be doing
[1225.76 - 1230.24] medical medium to the 100th degree
[1228.16 - 1231.92] a lot of people dabble in it a lot of
[1230.24 - 1234.40] people dabble in medical medium they're
[1231.92 - 1236.08] playing with it they do the celery juice
[1234.40 - 1238.00] they do a little this they do a little
[1236.08 - 1239.68] that and then they're doing apple cider
[1238.00 - 1240.64] vinegar nutritional yeast charcoal
[1239.68 - 1241.84] colostrum
[1240.64 - 1243.28] collagen they're doing all the stuff
[1241.84 - 1244.72] that breaks down the immune system
[1243.28 - 1246.48] they're doing caffeine but they're
[1244.72 - 1248.96] saying they're doing mm
[1246.48 - 1249.92] so in order to build that blood up quick
[1248.96 - 1252.56] you got to really
[1249.92 - 1253.84] stick to mm stuff for sure but the
[1252.56 - 1256.32] bottom line is
[1253.84 - 1257.20] you know it doesn't happen really like
[1256.32 - 1260.72] that it takes
[1257.20 - 1263.28] time takes time to actually rebuild your
[1260.72 - 1266.40] immune system and so
[1263.28 - 1268.88] and that's the problem there um so
[1266.40 - 1269.68] what i would do is small amounts it's
[1268.88 - 1271.76] not about
[1269.68 - 1273.76] fear it's not about never get a blood
[1271.76 - 1277.04] test it's not about being scared
[1273.76 - 1279.20] it's either i watch your back and and
[1277.04 - 1280.48] help you so you can have a choice to
[1279.20 - 1283.68] protect yourself
[1280.48 - 1284.64] or you know or i become a people pleaser
[1283.68 - 1287.36] you guys want me
[1284.64 - 1288.88] to be a people pleaser you you want me
[1287.36 - 1290.16] just to people please like all the other
[1288.88 - 1291.84] podcast doctors do
[1290.16 - 1293.60] because what they do is it's always
[1291.84 - 1295.52] about just always about
[1293.60 - 1296.96] you know people pleasing a little bit
[1295.52 - 1300.40] and this and that right
[1296.96 - 1303.44] it's all about that and it's not about
[1300.40 - 1304.56] here it is how can we protect you how
[1303.44 - 1307.44] can we can make
[1304.56 - 1309.36] make sure how can we make your make make

[1315.12 - 1318.88] seen
[1316.00 - 1319.68] for for over 30 plus years 35 years
[1318.88 - 1323.84] really
[1319.68 - 1326.48] i've seen people recovering recovering
[1323.84 - 1327.60] recovering they're getting there to the
[1326.48 - 1328.88] finish line
[1327.60 - 1331.12] they're recovering from multiple
[1328.88 - 1333.28] sclerosis and they're making it
[1331.12 - 1334.56] and then boom they had a 14 vial blood
[1333.28 - 1336.88] draw
[1334.56 - 1337.68] back in the saddle again back in the
[1336.88 - 1340.24] saddle again
[1337.68 - 1341.36] now we got to go to recovering
[1340.24 - 1344.56] recovering
[1341.36 - 1345.60] recovering recovering seven vial blood
[1344.56 - 1347.76] draw boom
[1345.60 - 1349.36] kick back notch even if it comes two
[1347.76 - 1350.00] months later three months later five
[1349.36 - 1353.12] months later
[1350.00 - 1355.20] boom kicked back recovering recovering
[1353.12 - 1357.44] having a harder time recovering now
[1355.20 - 1358.40] because the body just went what the heck
[1357.44 - 1361.92] recovering
[1358.40 - 1365.44] another five vials another 10 vials
[1361.92 - 1366.40] it's it's horrifying and no doctor
[1365.44 - 1369.44] realizes it
[1366.40 - 1371.60] no doctor knows about it then unless
[1369.44 - 1374.72] they've learned from medical medium
[1371.60 - 1378.96] and you know it's really it's really sad
[1374.72 - 1381.04] this is why it's so important so
[1378.96 - 1382.32] tanya says what does it mean when the
[1381.04 - 1384.32] test comes back
[1382.32 - 1387.12] and they say there was too much white
[1384.32 - 1388.96] blood cell in the blood
[1387.12 - 1390.32] first of all when you get a blood test
[1388.96 - 1392.48] and something's
[1390.32 - 1394.32] something's high in your your white
[1392.48 - 1395.76] count say your white counts hot
[1394.32 - 1397.84] whatever they can average your white
[1395.76 - 1399.36] count the basophils neutrophils
[1397.84 - 1401.28] you know lymphocytes whatever they want
[1399.36 - 1402.00] to do right monocytes whatever they want
[1401.28 - 1404.24] to average
[1402.00 - 1405.60] out with your white with your white
[1404.24 - 1407.04] count right
[1405.60 - 1408.80] killer cells however they want to
[1407.04 - 1410.08] average it some doctors average it
[1408.80 - 1411.60] differently some look at it differently
[1410.08 - 1412.96] i've seen virologists look at blood work
[1411.60 - 1416.00] differently right
[1412.96 - 1419.20] and but when the white counts up
[1416.00 - 1421.44] that means low-grade viral infection
[1419.20 - 1423.28] that's what that means low-grade viral
[1421.44 - 1424.56] infection that's what i've always taught
[1423.28 - 1426.00] doctors through the years
[1424.56 - 1427.76] it's the number one question i've had
[1426.00 - 1428.24] doctors ask me throughout the years you
[1427.76 - 1429.92] know
[1428.24 - 1431.44] it's like you know what's going on with
[1429.92 - 1432.88] this white count you know what can we
[1431.44 - 1434.40] see what could we not see and what
[1432.88 - 1435.92] happens is in a lot of people that have
[1434.40 - 1438.48] their elevated white count
[1435.92 - 1439.68] they got some viruses inside the liver
[1438.48 - 1441.44] they got that happening
[1439.68 - 1442.72] where they got the bugs inside the liver
[1441.44 - 1444.32] a little bit of an elevation of
[1442.72 - 1446.24] low-grade viral infection
[1444.32 - 1448.24] or their white count is in the process
[1446.24 - 1450.72] of destroying an epstein-barr virus
[1448.24 - 1452.56] epstein-barr virus is the number one
[1450.72 - 1453.68] reason why people get that elevated
[1452.56 - 1457.12] white count
[1453.68 - 1460.48] important to know shingles can do it too
[1457.12 - 1462.16] and and simplex one the cold sore
[1460.48 - 1464.24] cold sore people go few my cold sore
[1462.16 - 1465.60] went away it's just a cold sore well
[1464.24 - 1467.52] what happens what people don't know
[1465.60 - 1469.88] is it's still in your system and then it
[1467.52 - 1472.64] causes some trouble so it's good to be
[1469.88 - 1474.40] anti-viral and that's the thing about
[1472.64 - 1478.00] the medical medium new edition
[1474.40 - 1478.96] it's an anti-viral book in its greatest
[1478.00 - 1482.00] sense
[1478.96 - 1482.72] and and so important to know it really
[1482.00 - 1484.56] is
[1482.72 - 1486.96] good question michelle what about what
[1484.56 - 1489.20] about um what about low white count
[1486.96 - 1490.40] same thing low grade viral infections
[1489.20 - 1493.12] with low white count
[1490.40 - 1494.80] because the because the white count was
[1493.12 - 1497.84] maxed at one point
[1494.80 - 1500.64] and then it lost some steam and then it
[1497.84 - 1502.48] maxes and loses some steam and the thing
[1500.64 - 1504.88] is with blood work anyway
[1502.48 - 1505.68] any given day it could change so he gets
[1504.88 - 1508.32] your blood test
[1505.68 - 1510.48] one time one month two months later you
[1508.32 - 1511.52] get it tested again
[1510.48 - 1513.44] it's different than what it would have
[1511.52 - 1515.28] been a day later or three days later or
[1513.44 - 1516.72] five days later it's always changing and
[1515.28 - 1517.92] ebbing and flowing for a lot of people
[1516.72 - 1520.16] but low white count
[1517.92 - 1522.00] low weight count what that is is usually
[1520.16 - 1522.72] a little extra toxic heavy metals which
[1522.00 - 1525.04] actually
[1522.72 - 1526.88] lowers the red blood cells too so it
[1525.04 - 1529.68] lowers those babies
[1526.88 - 1531.52] and and the thing is is you know red
[1529.68 - 1533.60] blood cells you get your blood drawn
[1531.52 - 1534.72] you get trouble with the red blood cells
[1533.60 - 1538.24] you get the trouble with the
[1534.72 - 1541.36] white blood cells right and below
[1538.24 - 1542.40] white count is is indicative to the
[1541.36 - 1544.56] whole thing if it was
[1542.40 - 1546.80] high at one point and then it got
[1544.56 - 1548.32] drained the immune the immune system got
[1546.80 - 1549.76] low it got lower it got lower it's
[1548.32 - 1551.28] getting drained because it's battling
[1549.76 - 1553.28] low-grade viral infections
[1551.28 - 1555.12] you ask your doctor about you know take
[1553.28 - 1556.56] the medical medium books to the doctor
[1555.12 - 1558.00] you ask them all the questions you want
[1556.56 - 1559.44] to ask them show them the book that's
[1558.00 - 1560.88] what happened with this one it was shown
[1559.44 - 1563.52] to doctors around the world
[1560.88 - 1564.40] for the last six and a half seven years
[1563.52 - 1567.04] however it is
[1564.40 - 1568.80] um so anyway you guys i'm here i'm
[1567.04 - 1570.00] making a mango salad but haven't started
[1568.80 - 1571.60] yet talking about blood draw
[1570.00 - 1573.04] how serious it is when you get your
[1571.60 - 1574.64] blood test um
[1573.04 - 1576.32] and here's here's why i'm talking about
[1574.64 - 1578.88] it so much today okay
[1576.32 - 1580.08] so here's one reason why i'm bringing
[1578.88 - 1581.28] this up for someone reading some
[1580.08 - 1584.32] questions
[1581.28 - 1586.80] vivian says what about if the celery
[1584.32 - 1589.52] causes high blood pressure what can i do
[1586.80 - 1591.92] to stop the blood pressure from going up
[1589.52 - 1593.52] um that's you be your own detective is
[1591.92 - 1594.40] it really the celery causing high blood
[1593.52 - 1596.40] pressure
[1594.40 - 1598.16] um nothing else caused it you never had
[1596.40 - 1600.24] high blood pressure before
[1598.16 - 1601.76] um what happens when you don't do celery
[1600.24 - 1602.64] at all do you ever have high blood
[1601.76 - 1605.20] pressure
[1602.64 - 1607.04] um if i had high blood pressure uh
[1605.20 - 1607.92] because celery juice lowers high blood
[1607.04 - 1609.68] pressure right
[1607.92 - 1611.44] so but and that's what it's that's what
[1609.68 - 1613.68] it's proven to do out there but what
[1611.44 - 1616.40] i would do if i had high blood pressure
[1613.68 - 1618.08] is i would lower fats
[1616.40 - 1619.60] i would make sure there's no milk cheese
[1618.08 - 1621.44] butter and eggs in there if you're
[1619.60 - 1622.16] eating animal protein only eat it once a
[1621.44 - 1624.40] day
[1622.16 - 1626.48] if you're eating plant fats like avocado
[1624.40 - 1628.80] nuts seeds nut butters nut milks
[1626.48 - 1630.16] lower them i would lower them so your
[1628.80 - 1633.12] blood isn't so
[1630.16 - 1634.56] thick and stagnant and the liver gets a
[1633.12 - 1636.08] break and then you start healing the
[1634.56 - 1637.20] liver and then blood pressure problems
[1636.08 - 1640.64] that are mysterious
[1637.20 - 1642.24] go away ask your doctor take
[1640.64 - 1643.60] take take the book to your doctor go to
[1642.24 - 1644.56] library if you don't want to buy it it's
[1643.60 - 1645.68] going to come out in the library i'm
[1644.56 - 1647.20] sure eventually
[1645.68 - 1649.12] get the la get it in the library for
[1647.20 - 1650.48] free and and take it to your doctor
[1649.12 - 1653.04] ask them about your high blood pressure
[1650.48 - 1655.04] show them the book um
[1653.04 - 1656.32] ask him any questions you find any any
[1655.04 - 1659.04] you know things that you find in here
[1656.32 - 1659.04] that you want to ask
[1659.28 - 1665.52] so anyway you guys allison said you said
[1662.72 - 1666.88] two or three tubes yes sometimes the
[1665.52 - 1668.16] tubes are larger sometimes you're
[1666.88 - 1669.36] smaller you don't know which one you're
[1668.16 - 1670.48] gonna get you don't know which one
[1669.36 - 1671.84] they're gonna take
[1670.48 - 1673.52] sometimes they'll surprise you they'll
[1671.84 - 1674.16] take the large ones sometimes surprise
[1673.52 - 1676.48] you they'll take
[1674.16 - 1677.52] more of a smaller tube but i'd say two
[1676.48 - 1680.40] to three tubes
[1677.52 - 1682.32] that's what i would do for max but
[1680.40 - 1682.96] really if you're sensitive two to three
[1682.32 - 1685.28] tubes
[1682.96 - 1686.48] that's my recommendation ask your doctor
[1685.28 - 1689.44] do what's right for you
[1686.48 - 1690.40] you know with your doctor um and i would
[1689.44 - 1693.04] even ask for
[1690.40 - 1694.40] half tubes so the phlebotomist said it'd
[1693.04 - 1696.96] be like oh half tubes
[1694.40 - 1698.00] can we do half tubes and i would ask
[1696.96 - 1700.16] your doctor can i get
[1698.00 - 1702.24] half tubes now the blood labs would be
[1700.16 - 1704.40] like we don't want half tubes but they
[1702.24 - 1705.68] but but they're fine with it when it
[1704.40 - 1708.24] does go through
[1705.68 - 1709.20] and one doctor says okay let's do half
[1708.24 - 1712.56] half tubes
[1709.20 - 1715.28] so instead of eight you know full
[1712.56 - 1716.48] tubes we do really at equals to four
[1715.28 - 1717.52] food full tubes
[1716.48 - 1719.92] instead of eight because you're getting
[1717.52 - 1720.80] half tubes right and it goes to the
[1719.92 - 1723.68] blood lab
[1720.80 - 1725.52] and the blood lab is fine and runs it so
[1723.68 - 1727.20] when you hear about the blood lab won't
[1725.52 - 1728.48] let it they won't let it go
[1727.20 - 1730.96] they're they're just they're being
[1728.48 - 1732.08] ridiculous because they're only using a
[1730.96 - 1734.24] smidgen
[1732.08 - 1735.60] and they're throwing it all away
[1734.24 - 1736.16] smidging and they're throwing it all
[1735.60 - 1739.60] away
[1736.16 - 1740.32] now look you guys why would i take this
[1739.60 - 1742.32] serious
[1740.32 - 1743.52] like why would i want to talk about this
[1742.32 - 1746.88] because
[1743.52 - 1748.88] it can mean life or death for a lot of
[1746.88 - 1751.84] very sick people that are chronically
[1748.88 - 1754.56] ill fighting their way back
[1751.84 - 1755.76] from hell and they mean lyme disease
[1754.56 - 1757.60] really bad ms
[1755.76 - 1759.20] lupus or you're somebody that just gets
[1757.60 - 1760.96] headaches you're sensitive
[1759.20 - 1762.40] because you've got a low grade shingles
[1760.96 - 1763.60] without knowing it you've got something
[1762.40 - 1764.80] else without knowing and say you got
[1763.60 - 1766.00] sibo
[1764.80 - 1768.72] you don't know it you're walking around
[1766.00 - 1769.52] sibo and h h pylori and streptococcus in
[1768.72 - 1771.76] your gut
[1769.52 - 1773.12] and you got some sibo and stuff and and
[1771.76 - 1775.60] you know the blood draw
[1773.12 - 1776.40] affects us and here's the thing you have
[1775.60 - 1778.88] to know
[1776.40 - 1780.24] one of the most important things what
[1778.88 - 1781.84] you're going to hear from functional
[1780.24 - 1784.24] medicine doctors what you're going to
[1781.84 - 1786.28] hear from podcast doctors
[1784.24 - 1788.08] what you're going to hear from
[1786.28 - 1789.84] nutritionists now
[1788.08 - 1791.12] you're going to hear parroting right
[1789.84 - 1794.32] it's like a parrot
[1791.12 - 1797.20] you know and the parrot says
[1794.32 - 1798.64] your immune system is all in your gut
[1797.20 - 1799.68] that's where your immune system is
[1798.64 - 1801.20] that's what you're going to hear from
[1799.68 - 1802.56] the podcast doctors the functional
[1801.20 - 1803.52] medicine doctors
[1802.56 - 1804.88] you're going to hear that now for
[1803.52 - 1806.40] chinese medicine doctors you're just
[1804.88 - 1807.44] going to hear it the immune system is
[1806.40 - 1810.40] all in your gut
[1807.44 - 1810.88] that's where your immune system is wrong
[1810.40 - 1814.00] boom
[1810.88 - 1815.52] wrong another ridiculous trend and
[1814.00 - 1818.00] theory and thought
[1815.52 - 1819.36] in the system which sends everybody you
[1818.00 - 1821.04] know in the wrong direction
[1819.36 - 1822.80] your immune system is not all in your
[1821.04 - 1823.60] gut that's not where most of your immune
[1822.80 - 1826.96] system is
[1823.60 - 1828.56] completely 100 inaccurate and wrong
[1826.96 - 1830.00] bottom line okay you know where your
[1828.56 - 1832.80] immune system is
[1830.00 - 1834.40] it's in your bloodstream that's where
[1832.80 - 1837.84] your immune system is
[1834.40 - 1841.04] it's in your bloodstream
[1837.84 - 1843.92] that's where it is that's where they
[1841.04 - 1846.72] test for it that's where it is
[1843.92 - 1847.04] it's in your bloodstream so you don't
[1846.72 - 1850.72] get
[1847.04 - 1853.04] blood poisoning i'll say it again
[1850.72 - 1853.76] okay it's not in your gut it's in your
[1853.04 - 1856.96] bloodstream
[1853.76 - 1859.20] so you don't get blood poisoning
[1856.96 - 1860.32] so another ridiculous trend but here's
[1859.20 - 1862.08] the thing
[1860.32 - 1863.84] they're allowed to make ridiculous
[1862.08 - 1865.60] trends over and over again and as they
[1863.84 - 1867.04] keep on bombing or hurting people or
[1865.60 - 1867.76] bombing or hurting people or being
[1867.04 - 1870.80] useless
[1867.76 - 1873.44] no one pays the price it's all like oh
[1870.80 - 1875.36] move on something else five years ago oh
[1873.44 - 1877.28] let's move on to something else so let's
[1875.36 - 1878.64] change our tune once again let's do
[1877.28 - 1879.52] another ridiculous trend let's talk
[1878.64 - 1881.92] about lectins now
[1879.52 - 1883.20] that's the new one what's coffee animus
[1881.92 - 1885.04] let's talk coffee enemas
[1883.20 - 1886.56] oh wait a minute here let's do some cold
[1885.04 - 1889.44] plunging into ice
[1886.56 - 1890.08] and shock our body so that we live less
[1889.44 - 1891.68] longer
[1890.08 - 1893.36] let's you know because the body gets
[1891.68 - 1895.04] injured over time from the shock
[1893.36 - 1897.20] let's do all kinds of things and that's
[1895.04 - 1901.04] what happens the ridiculous trends come
[1897.20 - 1902.40] flying in and and should people just you
[1901.04 - 1903.60] know and they don't do it
[1902.40 - 1905.36] you know before medical medium
[1903.60 - 1906.88] information you guys came around before
[1905.36 - 1907.92] medical medium information got in the
[1906.88 - 1910.32] books too
[1907.92 - 1912.24] before that everybody swam in all those
[1910.32 - 1913.36] ridiculous trends misinformation and
[1912.24 - 1915.36] theories right
[1913.36 - 1917.12] they didn't have mm info to pull them
[1915.36 - 1918.88] out but now it's mixing up
[1917.12 - 1920.56] it's mixing they're taking medical
[1918.88 - 1921.52] medium information they're sticking it
[1920.56 - 1923.52] in with all those
[1921.52 - 1925.60] while doing all that other useless stuff
[1923.52 - 1928.56] and then people get a little bit better
[1925.60 - 1930.48] and it's the mm celery juice it's it's
[1928.56 - 1932.40] the m it's lowering the fats
[1930.48 - 1933.92] intermittent fasting is lowering the
[1932.40 - 1935.12] fats that's making sure you don't do
[1933.92 - 1936.64] fats in the morning
[1935.12 - 1938.56] that alone is helping people a little
[1936.64 - 1939.20] bit even though it's not quite right
[1938.56 - 1941.44] done
[1939.20 - 1943.60] but the bottom line is and then the
[1941.44 - 1944.88] epstein-barr reactivation of epsom bars
[1943.60 - 1947.52] medical medium information
[1944.88 - 1948.00] it was in this book first so i want to
[1947.52 - 1949.92] read a little
[1948.00 - 1951.68] bit about the blood draw when a larger
[1949.92 - 1953.36] number of blood vials are
[1951.68 - 1955.28] drawn it could be stressful on the
[1953.36 - 1957.52] immune system
[1955.28 - 1959.52] because the very immune defenses that
[1957.52 - 1960.56] are keeping the viruses behind lyme
[1959.52 - 1962.16] symptoms at bay
[1960.56 - 1963.68] and other chronic illness symptoms at
[1962.16 - 1966.24] bay are being drawn
[1963.68 - 1967.04] out of the body with the blood that's
[1966.24 - 1970.32] taken
[1967.04 - 1973.12] your white count gets drawn out you get
[1970.32 - 1975.52] sicker as you go along down the road
[1973.12 - 1977.28] and yeah you're young doesn't feel
[1975.52 - 1979.04] there's no problems you're you know
[1977.28 - 1980.96] young and you're you feel indestructible
[1979.04 - 1982.56] but you only got some acne and
[1980.96 - 1984.00] maybe a little you're a little tired a
[1982.56 - 1986.00] little brain fog
[1984.00 - 1987.92] but it's gonna hurt you when it's done
[1986.00 - 1988.40] wrong and they keep on vamping that
[1987.92 - 1992.00] blood
[1988.40 - 1995.04] out of you okay so
[1992.00 - 1997.04] larger blood draws
[1995.04 - 1998.48] tend to take away a substantial portion
[1997.04 - 2002.24] of a person's immune system
[1998.48 - 2004.32] that day yeah and it sometimes takes
[2002.24 - 2006.08] weeks and even longer to rebuild those
[2004.32 - 2009.04] portions of the immune system
[2006.08 - 2011.12] within those weeks that the full power
[2009.04 - 2014.16] of the immune system is not present to
[2011.12 - 2017.52] monitor the blood in organs
[2014.16 - 2020.40] right not present viruses can get
[2017.52 - 2021.28] in a window get a window to strengthen
[2020.40 - 2023.28] and proliferate
[2021.28 - 2024.88] infections can travel from organ to
[2023.28 - 2027.12] organ with ease
[2024.88 - 2028.80] because they're not being corralled by
[2027.12 - 2030.56] your immune system anymore
[2028.80 - 2032.80] and that can lead to a flare up of
[2030.56 - 2034.16] symptoms whether a week later a few
[2032.80 - 2036.80] weeks later months later
[2034.16 - 2038.80] or even a year later i recommend doing
[2036.80 - 2040.88] smaller blood draws
[2038.80 - 2042.48] over more visits if you're struggling
[2040.88 - 2045.52] with lyme symptoms
[2042.48 - 2046.08] ra focus and concentration migraines
[2045.52 - 2047.52] anxiety
[2046.08 - 2049.44] depression whatever you're struggling
[2047.52 - 2051.92] with eczema psoriasis
[2049.44 - 2053.60] i recommend no more than four vials of
[2051.92 - 2055.68] blood at a time
[2053.60 - 2057.68] and even consider fewer if you're very
[2055.68 - 2059.28] sensitive a mistake made by well-meaning
[2057.68 - 2061.20] doctors is to draw a large number of
[2059.28 - 2064.24] blood vials with sensitive people
[2061.20 - 2065.84] even ask for half blood vials anyway
[2064.24 - 2067.44] i'm reading medical medium new edition
[2065.84 - 2068.48] you guys the book is out there
[2067.44 - 2071.20] amazon.com

[2129.28 - 2132.80] that's great

[2132.80 - 2135.28] lifetime
[2135.76 - 2140.40] i wonder how many doctors are using your
[2138.80 - 2143.12] information
[2140.40 - 2144.96] how many people have gone from being
[2143.12 - 2146.72] deathly sick in their beds and got their
[2144.96 - 2150.40] lives back and they're running
[2146.72 - 2152.24] five miles a day now 10 miles a day
[2150.40 - 2155.76] how many people did you help in your
[2152.24 - 2155.76] life i wonder
[2157.12 - 2160.40] thanks for being on here though i
[2158.48 - 2162.48] appreciate it eileen
[2160.40 - 2163.76] i guess we don't get the answer about
[2162.48 - 2166.40] donating blood
[2163.76 - 2167.68] yeah i'll talk about it i'll talk about
[2166.40 - 2172.56] it
[2167.68 - 2174.08] um first of all
[2172.56 - 2176.48] if you're sensitive you got chronic
[2174.08 - 2177.20] illness you got any kind of epstein-barr
[2176.48 - 2180.40] related
[2177.20 - 2183.36] symptoms and conditions
[2180.40 - 2184.40] um if you're somebody with fatigue
[2183.36 - 2188.24] eczema
[2184.40 - 2190.64] aches and pains um
[2188.24 - 2191.52] somebody with you know with high anxiety
[2190.64 - 2194.40] depression
[2191.52 - 2197.20] anything somebody with an autoimmune
[2194.40 - 2200.72] diagnosis or maybe just a rosacea
[2197.20 - 2201.04] dermatitis um you know anything like
[2200.72 - 2203.12] that
[2201.04 - 2204.72] maybe you've had symptoms before tinkles
[2203.12 - 2208.88] and numbness
[2204.72 - 2211.68] whatever it is you want to be cautious
[2208.88 - 2212.64] about donating blood because you get rid
[2211.68 - 2215.44] of a lot of blood
[2212.64 - 2217.20] you get rid of your immune system and
[2215.44 - 2219.04] then you can become a sick person
[2217.20 - 2221.60] a real sick person who's going to need
[2219.04 - 2223.44] someone to donate blood to
[2221.60 - 2225.04] and so kind of think about that and be
[2223.44 - 2227.36] cautious because
[2225.04 - 2228.56] if you get too much blood drawn and too
[2227.36 - 2230.48] much blood drawn
[2228.56 - 2232.96] and you're sick you can end up really
[2230.48 - 2235.76] release it because i've seen it happen
[2232.96 - 2237.60] and um and then now you're now you're
[2235.76 - 2240.64] you're needing blood
[2237.60 - 2241.28] yourself absolutely it's one thing to
[2240.64 - 2244.40] think about
[2241.28 - 2246.40] i'm going to talk more about it though
[2244.40 - 2248.24] jenny love you detox smoothie really
[2246.40 - 2249.52] helping my son with autism incredible
[2248.24 - 2252.56] jenny
[2249.52 - 2253.44] amazing it really is so i got some
[2252.56 - 2256.48] lettuce in here
[2253.44 - 2257.60] right another thing is too um yeah you
[2256.48 - 2259.36] can donate blood
[2257.60 - 2260.88] absolutely it's it's a noble thing to do
[2259.36 - 2265.20] it's a great thing to do
[2260.88 - 2266.88] um maybe you can donate smaller batches
[2265.20 - 2270.80] maybe you can find out about that and
[2266.88 - 2273.60] look into it smaller batches
[2270.80 - 2274.24] also be really proactive when you donate
[2273.60 - 2276.80] blood
[2274.24 - 2278.96] be careful don't don't push yourself
[2276.80 - 2280.56] hard for a week afterwards
[2278.96 - 2282.56] make sure you're taking good care of
[2280.56 - 2285.60] yourself staying hydrated
[2282.56 - 2286.48] make sure um make sure you're doing some
[2285.60 - 2288.00] zinc
[2286.48 - 2290.00] ask your doctor if that's right for you
[2288.00 - 2291.68] okay but i would if i was donating blood
[2290.00 - 2294.96] i'd be on zinc
[2291.68 - 2297.44] um and the right kind of zinc of course
[2294.96 - 2299.36] lunel medical medium is the only hundred

[2355.04 - 2361.28] uh julianne medical medium has helped me
[2358.08 - 2364.48] his methods work incredible incredible
[2361.28 - 2368.08] cutting up some some cauliflower right
[2364.48 - 2369.60] here right now
[2368.08 - 2372.96] putting that in here i'm cutting the
[2369.60 - 2374.56] pieces not so small not so big
[2372.96 - 2376.48] that's how i got lime from a blood
[2374.56 - 2378.48] transfusion shannon bentley that's how i
[2376.48 - 2381.04] got lime from blood transfusion
[2378.48 - 2382.40] um my concern is when you donate blood
[2381.04 - 2383.60] and you have that reactivated
[2382.40 - 2385.28] epstein-barr and they don't know you
[2383.60 - 2386.88] have reactivated epstein-barr then you
[2385.28 - 2388.40] donate blood then that reactivated
[2386.88 - 2390.08] epstein-barr goes into somebody else but
[2388.40 - 2391.92] yet we need people to donate blood
[2390.08 - 2393.44] because of critical situations
[2391.92 - 2395.20] surgeries heart surgeries and all kinds
[2393.44 - 2396.48] of different stuff and i completely
[2395.20 - 2398.24] understand that
[2396.48 - 2400.00] but if you're donating blood maybe
[2398.24 - 2402.08] donate less maybe
[2400.00 - 2403.84] really take care of yourself for a week
[2402.08 - 2407.36] or two after
[2403.84 - 2411.92] i if okay this is a good way of doing it
[2407.36 - 2414.08] say i was gonna donate blood all right
[2411.92 - 2415.76] well what i would do is make sure i
[2414.08 - 2419.68] wasn't eating any
[2415.76 - 2422.40] of these right here any time before
[2419.68 - 2424.08] like a month before and anytime after i
[2422.40 - 2427.20] would not eat these eggs right here
[2424.08 - 2428.40] okay that i would not do no eggs no milk
[2427.20 - 2429.68] cheese no butter
[2428.40 - 2431.84] i would keep that away i would keep
[2429.68 - 2433.36] gluten away at least keep those foods
[2431.84 - 2436.72] away if you're going to donate blood
[2433.36 - 2438.48] that's something to consider right there
[2436.72 - 2441.36] and i suggest never eating those at all
[2438.48 - 2442.40] eggs for for sure i suggest never eating
[2441.36 - 2444.40] those anyway
[2442.40 - 2446.80] cutting up some florets some cauliflower
[2444.40 - 2446.80] right here
[2446.88 - 2450.88] it's one thing i do i make sure i would
[2448.64 - 2453.28] be taking zinc
[2450.88 - 2454.88] i would be taking some goldenseal i'd be
[2453.28 - 2456.64] taking the vimorji stuff personally
[2454.88 - 2459.68] that's what i would be doing
[2456.64 - 2463.04] um i'd be taking lemon balm that's what
[2459.68 - 2465.44] i'd be doing i'd be taking antivirals
[2463.04 - 2466.80] vitamin c i'd be taking a lot of vitamin
[2465.44 - 2469.04] c so if i
[2466.80 - 2470.32] try to donate blood at least i had a lot
[2469.04 - 2472.40] of vitamin c in me
[2470.32 - 2473.60] that was feeding what was left of my
[2472.40 - 2475.76] immune system
[2473.60 - 2477.12] so here i'm going to donate some blood
[2475.76 - 2479.12] they're taking it out
[2477.12 - 2480.72] right and meanwhile i took vitamin c
[2479.12 - 2482.56] that morning because i want to make sure
[2480.72 - 2484.24] whatever white counts left in me it's
[2482.56 - 2485.76] able to gobble down and gobble down and
[2484.24 - 2487.36] gobble down vitamin c
[2485.76 - 2489.52] which i think i put it over there but
[2487.36 - 2495.36] that's what i would do
[2489.52 - 2499.12] i mean definitely what i do um
[2495.36 - 2499.12] yeah i don't know where my vitamin c is
[2499.68 - 2503.44] so yeah so i put some cauliflower in the
[2502.00 - 2505.92] salad
[2503.44 - 2507.60] now i'm going to start doing some mango
[2505.92 - 2509.36] maybe some tomato in a little bit
[2507.60 - 2510.72] let's see what these mangoes look like i
[2509.36 - 2512.16] don't know if they look good if they're
[2510.72 - 2514.40] not good i don't know what's going on
[2512.16 - 2517.36] we're gonna see
[2514.40 - 2517.36] but you know you guys
[2518.00 - 2523.04] you know it's like this okay
[2521.20 - 2524.88] all right i have a this mango does look
[2523.04 - 2527.68] good it's not not so bad at all wasn't
[2524.88 - 2531.60] sure what i had today
[2527.68 - 2531.60] i'm not trying to put fear in anybody
[2532.00 - 2536.00] but i know a lot of people that were
[2535.04 - 2537.68] happy they got this
[2536.00 - 2539.20] information throughout the years when i
[2537.68 - 2542.72] taught it
[2539.20 - 2545.04] one-on-one a lot of people were happy
[2542.72 - 2546.32] it protected a lot of people so they can
[2545.04 - 2548.72] be safe
[2546.32 - 2550.96] they got smaller blood draws their
[2548.72 - 2553.12] immune system was preserved
[2550.96 - 2555.20] and they kept fighting forward healing
[2553.12 - 2557.04] instead of getting vamped
[2555.20 - 2558.96] instead of it all being taken out of
[2557.04 - 2560.96] them vampires
[2558.96 - 2564.16] okay i've done a lot of lectures about
[2560.96 - 2567.76] it throughout the years
[2564.16 - 2568.16] all of that so and i figured you know
[2567.76 - 2569.84] what
[2568.16 - 2571.20] i don't talk about it enough i've talked
[2569.84 - 2572.64] about it before
[2571.20 - 2574.72] but i don't talk about it enough with
[2572.64 - 2576.88] you guys and i'm like wait a minute i
[2574.72 - 2579.28] better jump on this because
[2576.88 - 2581.04] i gotta look out for you guys that's
[2579.28 - 2584.08] just the bottom line
[2581.04 - 2586.32] you know so
[2584.08 - 2587.68] making some mango salad i got some mango
[2586.32 - 2589.92] i'm just gonna
[2587.68 - 2591.28] take i take a spoon i just cut it i cut
[2589.92 - 2593.52] it like that and these little
[2591.28 - 2595.12] you know squares in there and i take a
[2593.52 - 2598.72] spoon and i'm just dropping
[2595.12 - 2598.72] the pieces down in here right
[2600.16 - 2605.36] this is the way i'm doing it a piece
[2601.68 - 2608.80] just went on the floor landed on my foot
[2605.36 - 2611.44] so let me get some of this going
[2608.80 - 2613.76] um mango is a really powerful healing
[2611.44 - 2613.76] food
[2613.84 - 2618.56] i talk about it i think the detox was
[2616.64 - 2620.96] too much for my adrenals which caused my
[2618.56 - 2623.04] blood pressure to rise and i became
[2620.96 - 2625.52] really weak i crashed i had to quit
[2623.04 - 2627.76] celery juice and doing better
[2625.52 - 2627.76] um
[2629.52 - 2636.40] nancy uh so
[2633.28 - 2637.60] are you doing any antivirals are you
[2636.40 - 2639.44] doing what kind of what kind of
[2637.60 - 2642.40] protocols are you doing
[2639.44 - 2642.96] um when someone's really toxic or really
[2642.40 - 2646.08] really
[2642.96 - 2647.76] viral you know that they can have
[2646.08 - 2649.20] all kinds of things can happen when
[2647.76 - 2650.96] you're healing and flushing the stuff
[2649.20 - 2654.96] out of your system
[2650.96 - 2658.72] um but celery juice is really really
[2654.96 - 2661.84] gentle it's gentle very very gentle
[2658.72 - 2663.28] um why don't you i mean you don't have
[2661.84 - 2665.20] look ask your doctor what's right for
[2663.28 - 2666.32] you
[2665.20 - 2667.92] that's what i would do why don't you ask
[2666.32 - 2670.08] your doctor but if it was me i'd go down
[2667.92 - 2671.52] to four ounces of celery juice
[2670.08 - 2675.12] i mean that's what i would do but ask
[2671.52 - 2675.12] your doctor what you what you should do
[2675.52 - 2677.84] so
[2679.36 - 2682.48] cutting some more mangoes here we'll see
[2680.88 - 2684.48] if we get some more good ones that's a
[2682.48 - 2686.72] really nice one right there
[2684.48 - 2688.96] if it was up to me i would work up the
[2686.72 - 2690.24] dosage that's what i would do
[2688.96 - 2693.60] trying to pay attention so i don't cut
[2690.24 - 2695.36] my hand of course got another mango here
[2693.60 - 2698.56] i would work up start with four ounces
[2695.36 - 2698.56] start working my way up
[2699.44 - 2704.56] another thing too if you're detoxing
[2702.80 - 2706.08] okay what else are you doing and what
[2704.56 - 2707.12] else are you eating are you eating
[2706.08 - 2708.40] enough
[2707.12 - 2711.04] could have nothing to do with the celery
[2708.40 - 2712.96] juice are you eating enough
[2711.04 - 2715.04] did you go without food too much are you
[2712.96 - 2718.32] on so little calories
[2715.04 - 2720.80] are your calories enough
[2718.32 - 2722.40] because really it sounds to me like not
[2720.80 - 2723.76] enough calories going on
[2722.40 - 2725.20] might have been eating smaller portions
[2723.76 - 2726.56] of something or not eating enough
[2725.20 - 2727.92] frequently enough especially if you have
[2726.56 - 2733.52] adrenal issues
[2727.92 - 2737.76] especially if you're adrenal sensitive
[2733.52 - 2737.76] um i'm putting some more mango in here
[2738.96 - 2747.84] okay i got my mango pieces in the salad
[2740.96 - 2747.84] which is coming along really nice
[2750.88 - 2755.92] got the mango in here all right let's do
[2753.84 - 2758.08] some green onion
[2755.92 - 2759.68] you guys okay if i do some green onion
[2758.08 - 2761.52] some people say i don't like green
[2759.68 - 2763.76] onions some people like it i still got
[2761.52 - 2765.68] radishes to go that's a healing food
[2763.76 - 2767.36] radishes are antiviral green onions are
[2765.68 - 2769.04] antiviral
[2767.36 - 2771.52] so i'm gonna cut these green onions
[2769.04 - 2771.52] right now
[2772.96 - 2776.00] now i don't want them too small and i
[2774.80 - 2779.12] don't want them too big
[2776.00 - 2779.12] so i'm just going to do this here
[2784.08 - 2786.96] put these on top
[2787.20 - 2791.60] can you guys see this i'll show you the
[2788.80 - 2791.60] salad in a second
[2793.04 - 2795.76] got a little bit of that so we're
[2794.32 - 2797.20] working on it we've got the mango
[2795.76 - 2798.96] cauliflower butter leaf lettuce
[2797.20 - 2802.16] underneath there we've got the scallions
[2798.96 - 2805.76] as well let's
[2802.16 - 2806.56] do some radishes let's not lose that
[2805.76 - 2807.92] radish
[2806.56 - 2810.16] because i like to throw things in the
[2807.92 - 2813.36] air
[2810.16 - 2814.40] the habit i picked up throughout the
[2813.36 - 2817.84] years anybody
[2814.40 - 2817.84] hands me something i throw it in the air
[2820.40 - 2823.76] i don't think that's a great thing
[2826.88 - 2832.00] some thinly slicing these
[2830.40 - 2835.28] that's how i'm doing it with the with
[2832.00 - 2835.28] with this radish right here
[2836.32 - 2839.36] because do you guys eat enough radishes
[2838.08 - 2841.04] do you ever have them
[2839.36 - 2843.04] it's something that a lot of people
[2841.04 - 2846.24] don't really think about it's like nah
[2843.04 - 2849.52] radishes isn't something i want to get
[2846.24 - 2850.40] at the store you know i'm going to cut
[2849.52 - 2853.12] these radish
[2850.40 - 2855.44] slices in half in one half okay like
[2853.12 - 2859.84] this
[2855.44 - 2859.84] that's what i'm going to do
[2862.40 - 2865.68] guys we're live on youtube and facebook

[2915.84 - 2922.24] what i cover in there is just
[2919.20 - 2924.32] it's just unbelievable beth buck i'm
[2922.24 - 2927.04] very grateful i wish i would have known
[2924.32 - 2928.16] i had 15 vials and it makes me sad and
[2927.04 - 2929.76] cry to think
[2928.16 - 2931.28] they harmed me well here it is they're
[2929.76 - 2932.72] not doing it on purpose
[2931.28 - 2935.04] it's just that science research is
[2932.72 - 2936.96] behind on a lot of information
[2935.04 - 2938.72] and now you know how to protect yourself
[2936.96 - 2940.64] what you do is you ask your doctor can
[2938.72 - 2942.64] you do less can you do seven vials
[2940.64 - 2943.68] if it's if you know can you do half
[2942.64 - 2946.88] vials i mean
[2943.68 - 2948.24] i would i would do i would do
[2946.88 - 2950.08] if i'm sick and i have any kind of
[2948.24 - 2950.48] condition if i had any kind of symptom
[2950.08 - 2952.08] or
[2950.48 - 2954.56] aches and pains or condition i would
[2952.08 - 2956.40] personally do two to three vials
[2954.56 - 2957.52] at a time i'd say to my doctor what can
[2956.40 - 2958.64] you get out of three vials because
[2957.52 - 2959.28] that's what i'm that's what i'm going to
[2958.64 - 2961.68] give you
[2959.28 - 2962.96] i think we okay well we'll schedule they
[2961.68 - 2965.04] just here's what it is
[2962.96 - 2966.88] they want it all all at once they don't
[2965.04 - 2968.96] want to have to think
[2966.88 - 2970.72] that you know the doctor doesn't want to
[2968.96 - 2971.12] have to think what he has to divide the
[2970.72 - 2975.28] test
[2971.12 - 2978.64] in it's a hassle right so you become
[2975.28 - 2978.96] anybody becomes like either you take the
[2978.64 - 2980.56] hit
[2978.96 - 2982.16] because the doctor doesn't want the
[2980.56 - 2984.40] hassle that's all so
[2982.16 - 2985.36] let me get it all done in one boom out
[2984.40 - 2987.04] the door
[2985.36 - 2988.96] instead of doctor being like okay let me
[2987.04 - 2990.08] divide this let me check out your
[2988.96 - 2992.16] thyroid
[2990.08 - 2993.84] right check out some of your white count
[2992.16 - 2995.60] we'll do smack 27
[2993.84 - 2997.84] let's check out your white count let's
[2995.60 - 2999.44] check out say your liver enzymes let's
[2997.84 - 3001.20] check out your thyroid that should be
[2999.44 - 3002.64] enough let's do a few vials
[3001.20 - 3004.16] and then we'll come back and we'll check
[3002.64 - 3005.60] out hormones we'll check out this we'll
[3004.16 - 3006.96] check out that we'll check cortisol out
[3005.60 - 3008.24] we'll do that at another day we'll do
[3006.96 - 3010.80] another three vials that day
[3008.24 - 3012.40] now you're protected but yet it's a
[3010.80 - 3015.68] hassle for the doctor you see
[3012.40 - 3015.68] to do that to break it up
[3015.76 - 3020.32] suzanne doctors all told me i need to
[3017.76 - 3022.00] kill my thyroid with radioactive iodine
[3020.32 - 3023.12] i was feeling horrible had tried
[3022.00 - 3025.68] everything in the world

[3046.48 - 3049.68] radioactive iodine and a lot of people
[3048.00 - 3051.12] who did the radioactive iodine

[3366.48 - 3371.04] help myself
[3367.36 - 3372.32] i can't okay more people are drinking
[3371.04 - 3373.28] celery juice around the world than
[3372.32 - 3375.92] anything else
[3373.28 - 3376.88] in the healing arts anything there's
[3375.92 - 3378.64] nothing else
[3376.88 - 3380.80] in the healing arts that people are
[3378.64 - 3383.44] doing more than drinking celery juice
[3380.80 - 3386.00] stores run out thousands and thousands
[3383.44 - 3387.44] of farms are growing it
[3386.00 - 3388.80] hundreds of thousands of farms around
[3387.44 - 3390.96] the world are growing it it's the
[3388.80 - 3391.36] largest crop in every farm but guess
[3390.96 - 3394.08] what
[3391.36 - 3395.12] everybody pretends it doesn't exist
[3394.08 - 3397.44] because guess why
[3395.12 - 3399.44] medical mediums the originator all the
[3397.44 - 3399.92] influencers keep it quiet why they drink
[3399.44 - 3400.72] it now
[3399.92 - 3402.08] they don't want to talk about it
[3400.72 - 3403.60] meanwhile they're all drinking it you
[3402.08 - 3404.00] can even see it i have people tell me
[3403.60 - 3405.92] all the day
[3404.00 - 3407.60] that people are getting caught drinking
[3405.92 - 3408.80] it in their youtubes and they're not
[3407.60 - 3410.72] saying they are but they're caught
[3408.80 - 3413.52] drinking it every morning like
[3410.72 - 3415.04] it's crazy right it is the number one
[3413.52 - 3416.64] healing tool in the world right now and
[3415.04 - 3418.16] the media doesn't want to touch it
[3416.64 - 3419.92] they don't even want to talk about it
[3418.16 - 3421.76] because too many people are healing from
[3419.92 - 3423.44] it it's too powerful the movement's too
[3421.76 - 3425.68] powerful it's too big
[3423.44 - 3427.76] and yeah there's a shortage and they're
[3425.68 - 3429.12] growing it in truckloads like never
[3427.76 - 3431.52] before in history
[3429.12 - 3433.36] it's actually just crazy really i think
[3431.52 - 3434.08] the influencers don't talk about it as
[3433.36 - 3435.60] much
[3434.08 - 3438.00] and youtubers don't talk about it as
[3435.60 - 3441.04] much because they can't make
[3438.00 - 3441.84] money off of it you can't make money off
[3441.04 - 3445.12] of it it's like
[3441.84 - 3447.28] you juice it you drink it you can't say
