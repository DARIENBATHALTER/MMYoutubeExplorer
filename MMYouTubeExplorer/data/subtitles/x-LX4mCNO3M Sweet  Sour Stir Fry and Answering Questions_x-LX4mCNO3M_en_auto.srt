33
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,840

35
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,280

medical medium book new edition so i'm

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,880
excited

39
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,960
so i'm gonna get my things ready and

40
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,240
show you i got the bell peppers i know

41
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,720
some of you are like no

42
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,320
not i can't do a bell pepper it's gonna

43
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,159
it's gonna hurt me it's not gonna hurt

44
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,759
you this is really good for you

45
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,280
i got the orange bell peppers i got the

46
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,079
red bell peppers which you don't want is

47
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,560
a green

48
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,079
bell pepper green it's not ripe so you

49
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,360
got to remember that

50
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:51,119
green bell peppers are not ripe

51
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,200
that's the whole ticket right there

52
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,920
right you want to eat

53
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,520
ripe food and green bell peppers aren't

54
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,600
so keep that in mind because somebody

55
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,719
will have a green bell pepper

56
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,200
and it's not going to feel good in their

57
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,680
stomach because unripe food

58
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,680
doesn't feel good it just doesn't i mean

59
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,399
can you imagine eating an unripe mango

60
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,120
you just

61
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,239
really hard mango or an unripe avocado

62
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,280
where you can't even you guys like

63
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,000
avocados well

64
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,440
if your avocado's not ripe right are you

65
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,800
just gonna eat it where it's hard as a

66
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,280
rock where you can't get a knife through

67
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,400
it

68
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,920
so but a green bell pepper is not ripe

69
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,840
and that's what you want to avoid but

70
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,360
the red ones are ripe so i got some

71
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,959

for this um

97
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,200
renita says i can't eat any peppers they

98
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,200
cause joint pain for me

99
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,560
well make sure they're not green peppers

100
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,720
make sure they're never green

101
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,040
make sure they're they're red and make

102
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,440
sure that have you ever had a piece of

103
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,560
red

104
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,879
bell pepper by itself like a piece

105
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,640
or was it peppers and something else was

106
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,920
it peppers in a sausage

107
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:46,480
grinder with cheese was it peppers

108
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,120
in a chicken grinder with cheese was it

109
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,840
was it

110
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,560
peppers and eggs was it peppers and

111
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,799
butter

112
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,159
what was it that you were having was it

113
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,159
was it gluten

114
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,840
was there like was there was it a pepper

115
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,239
sandwich with all these other things and

116
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,000
then gluten was involved and

117
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,080
keep that in mind just we can do some

118
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,959
self-diagnosis a little self-diagnosis

119
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,760
there like

120
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,720
could a little piece of red bell pepper

121
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,760
be the problem

122
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,680
or is it whatever that pepper was in

123
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,519
that was maybe the problem what was

124
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,799
going on was there vinegar in there so

125
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,120
that's another thing too because the

126
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:21,519
true cause of joint pain

127
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,199
is viral stuff so that's the joint pain

128
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,000
so it's viral stuff i talk about that

129
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,840
with ra

130
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,759
rheumatoid arthritis i talk about the

131
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,199
epstein-barr virus being

132
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:33,759
the joint pain maker it hurts the nerves

133
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,720
swells up joints too so keep that in

134
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,240
mind

135
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,840
but hey you can stay away from the red

136
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,759
bell pepper and the orange bell pepper

137
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,360
of course of course try something else

138
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,759
keep it out of the stir fry how about

139
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,080
that

140
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,199
lorraine lawson wow green bell peppers

141
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,360
are not ripe

142
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,199
yes they're not ripe exactly totally no

143
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,800
wonder why no wonder i thought peppers

144
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,520
affected me at one time

145
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,800
i stopped eating them but love the red

146
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,040
and orange ones

147
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,479
the green bell peppers so another thing

148
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,800
too somebody might

149
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,560
get a pepper meal of some kind like a

150
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,639
dish or a condiment and it's got

151
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,400
green and red and other things in it or

152
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,600
or but the green

153
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,520
pepper is what causes problems anything

154
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,320
unripe can cause trouble so keep that in

155
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,520

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,360
an unripe banana so they'll put that in

190
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,440
their book or they'll put there on their

191
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,960
podcast where do an unripe banana

192
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,720
that's the worst thing you can do you

193
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,600
don't want unripe

194
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,960
bananas on ripe fruits you don't want to

195
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,800
eat an orange that didn't turn

196
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,960
orange you don't want to eat a green

197
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,919
unripe orange where it's green

198
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,120
on a tree you want food to be ripe

199
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,400
that's the key

200
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,840
and that's something that people get in

201
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,479
trouble with in general because they

202
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,560
won't

203
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,400
they won't know what they're doing those

204
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,360
jalapenos when they're green

205
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,199
they're on ripe so keep that in mind too

206
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,160
green bell peppers are so yummy though

207
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,599
yeah you know

208
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,199
alex if you still want to eat them you

209
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:56,639
could still have green bell peppers

210
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,840
you can you can so i'm making some food

211
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,960
now i'm going to start making this

212
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,120
stir-fry

213
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,039
i'm excited what's the name of the book

214
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,360
please i just saw that

215
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,160
this is medical medium okay secrets

216
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,919
behind chronic

217
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,240
mystery illness and how to finally heal

218
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,680
and this is the new edition so revised

219
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,160

so i cover chronic fatigue syndrome

221
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,319
lupus

222
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,680
ra multiple sclerosis lyme disease this

223
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,840
is the book

224
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,360
that blew the roof off of lyme disease

225
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,680
and millions have healed because of it

226
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,639
so this is the truth about lyme and how

227
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,400
to heal it

228
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,840

from the grave i mean brought people

234
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,199
back

235
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,479
they were literally in wheelchairs

236
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,479
suffering in bed

237
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,840
and the 28-day cleanse has brought so

238
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:51,120
many lives back

239
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:54,319
and this is the book so jim

240
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,800
kathy says i've had the all cat blood

241
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,800
test

242
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,160
that says i'm highly reactive to bell

243
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,680
peppers or bananas

244
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,800
how can i do your cleanses when they

245
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,800
call for banana well

246
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,280
um look i talk to doctors all the time

247
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,039
about that test and the consensus is

248
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,800
between lots of doctors i know

249
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,280
plus information that i've learned along

250
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,280
the way about that that the test is very

251
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,639
inconsistent so it'll tell you that

252
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,639
you're sensitive to a lot of different

253
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,879
things but what it won't tell you

254
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,639
is maybe something that you should be

255
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,720
sensitive like you should keep out of

256
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,479
your diet so

257
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,160
does that test tell you to stay away

258
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,240
from eggs because eggs

259
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,719
feed all manners of illness that feeds

260
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,959
pathogens viruses bacteria

261
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:38,240
so if you have any kind of condition at

262
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:40,640
all eczema psoriasis

263
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,399
cfs lupus aches and pains tingles

264
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,880
numbness vertigo dizziness whatever it

265
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,519
is

266
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,200
you know ringing in the ears utis

267
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,080
chronic sinusitis whatever you have

268
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,640
going on

269
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,920
eggs will feed all these bugs and what

270
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,760
the alcat test

271
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,360
never understood or never knew the

272
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,160
makers of it okay

273
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,640
was they never knew what causes sickness

274
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,040
so

275
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,120
the creators of the alcat test don't

276
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,399
know what causes cfs or lyme disease

277
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,000
unless they learned it from medical

278
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,640
medium information like so many doctors

279
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,640
have

280
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,920
but they didn't know what causes any

281
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,240
sickness and illness so

282
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,240
all of a sudden now they're experts at

283
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,160
what foods you should stay away from

284
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,279
you know that's interesting too so

285
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,880
they're experts

286
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:21,200
but meanwhile they can't get anybody

287
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,959
better that's got the ms and they can't

288
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,399
get the people better with lupus and

289
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,560
they can't get the people better with

290
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,680
raging eczema psoriasis where they can't

291
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,959
wear clothes

292
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,480
and they're suffering all night

293
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,760
scratching their skin off and it's

294
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,920
bleeding everywhere

295
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,320
well they can do an lcat test for that

296
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,920
eczema patient or that psoriasis patient

297
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,760
but they sure as heck can't stop their

298
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,440
skin from tearing off and then bleeding

299
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,519
all night long in agony and needing

300
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,800
drugs to try to calm the pain down

301
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,640
well they can't fix that so what i

302
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,560
kind of like what i've learned through

303
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,720
the years is when

304
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,920
you know something works and you've seen

305
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,920
it work and

306
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,760
the results are there and millions have

307
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,000
healed from the information

308
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,000
that's kind of the leads you kind of go

309
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,640
with because the makers of the alcat

310
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,800
test

311
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,000
well they can't save that person with

312
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,600
severe eczema

313
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,839
and they can't save that person in the

314
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,760
wheelchair that needs to get out and

315
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,600
recover further that mass and they can't

316
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,360
save that person with neurological lyme

317
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,040
and their life is falling apart all

318
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,120
around them and

319
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,800
and they can't save anybody there they

320
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,480
can tell you that you should stay away

321
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,880
from a banana and they should tell you

322
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,600
they can tell you that

323
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,640
mandy i had those food sensitivity tests

324
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,440
two years two

325
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:34,160
um two years ago and was told i was

326
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:37,440
highly sensitive to bananas turnout

327
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:40,079
that was incorrect once i found the mm

328
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,560
information in 2017 i eat bananas every

329
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,240
day

330
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,920
every single day and they have helped me

331
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,600
heal being being

332
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:50,480
so high in lysine correct 100 mandy

333
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,440
right on so true and that's the mistakes

334
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,399
out there

335
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,279
once again you got a whole bunch of

336
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,560
hackers

337
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,320
this is how you know this leads into

338
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,480
something i've been thinking about like

339
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,920
just recently but this leads to a whole

340
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,640
bunch of hackers in health

341
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,000
right and they got all these different

342
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,920
ways of doing stuff

343
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,120
meanwhile they don't know what's wrong

344
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,800
and they're kind of like just they're

345
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,040
shooting blanks everywhere it's like hey

346
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,480
stay away from that banana stay away

347
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,000
from that tomato

348
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,600
stay away meanwhile they don't even know

349
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,640
why anybody's suffering and i don't know

350
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:23,040
why you're sick

351
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:25,360
and a whole bit um lunell

352
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,120

353
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,640
i'm here so let's talk about this let's

354
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,519
get this going and i want to cover some

355
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,160

so i'm going to slice up some carrots to

359
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,399
start with okay

360
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,079
so i'm going to thinly slice up some

361
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,120
carrots i got them right here

362
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:46,560
so this is the sweet and sour stir-fry

363
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,079
um look i understand it's it's easy easy

364
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,800
to get tricked

365
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,680
into the owl cat it's easy to get

366
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,040
tricked

367
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:58,480
into food sensitivities because

368
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:01,680
you know one of the things is that

369
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:04,880
what food sensitivity tests change

370
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,839
they change literally by the hour so you

371
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,320
can get some

372
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,959
blood drawn right you can do even some

373
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:14,639
saliva testing or blood drawn

374
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:16,880
okay and you can do it an hour later

375
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,360
if you went back to your doctor an hour

376
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:23,040
later and had a new blood test

377
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:26,720
drawn it would show different

378
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:30,560
sensitivities to different foods in one

379
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:32,959
hour okay a day later

380
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,399
the same thing all of a sudden now your

381
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,800
food sensitivity says

382
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,240
tess says you're allergic to cilantro

383
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,959
now oh you're not supposed to have

384
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,680
parsley

385
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:43,920
oh stay away from strawberries oh forget

386
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,839
asparagus that's a bad one too

387
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,920
here's what's funny you can get that

388
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,839
test done and get it done a month later

389
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,399
and here's what your doctor will do

390
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,240
your fancy doctor will go hey some new

391
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,120
sensitivities showed up on your test

392
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,040
this month

393
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,480
since last month you're not just now

394
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,720
sensitive to some bananas

395
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,079
but you're sensitive to some cilantro

396
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,600
you're sensitive to

397
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,880
some parsley and this is how ridiculous

398
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,880
it really is

399
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,800
and how it consistent if they did a

400
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:14,320
blood test an hour later

401
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:16,800
after you went to bathroom okay

402
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,160
or ate something all of a sudden that

403
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,760
test would change

404
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:23,600
isn't that incredible um

405
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,560
karen todd says finding your books gave

406
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,240

you know like

411
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:38,880
look i understand because

412
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,800
it it's the people that haven't suffered

413
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,240
and they haven't struggled and they

414
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,800
don't know what it's like to be down

415
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,639
there

416
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,320
in that in that spot they don't know

417
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,320
what it's like to have that kind of

418
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:52,240
struggle or suffering right

419
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,519
and um i'm slicing these carrots by the

420
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,440
way thinly slicing them

421
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,720
and they don't know what it what it's

422
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,880
like to be there

423
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,399
they're easy to judge quick you know

424
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,040
they're easy to judge quick they'll be

425
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,199
like

426
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,959
no don't listen to the m make sure

427
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,639
you're on apple cider vinegar make sure

428
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,680
you do two tablespoons of apple cider

429
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,079
vinegar every day

430
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,399
that'll help your foot you know you hear

431
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:14,560
all this kind of information out there

432
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,320
and what's sad is that information can

433
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,839
get you in trouble and when you're

434
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:23,519
when you're in a situation that's really

435
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,920
really tricky and exactly maybe about to

436
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,959
get

437
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,600
your foot amputated or something every

438
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:31,680
little bit

439
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:34,000
counts every little bit counts

440
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,760
it really matters then but if you're

441
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,560
you're you're fairly healthy don't have

442
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,160
much going on

443
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,760
maybe just a little anxiety and a little

444
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,959
fatigue right

445
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,560
and you're fairly healthy um

446
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,160
you know you can you can play around

447
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,760
with all these different things

448
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,519
but you know what it really counts is

449
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,959
when yeah when when

450
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:55,440
when it matters matters the most um

451
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:57,199

489
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,440
right and

490
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,160
it's really not a good term bio

491
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,320
biohacking

492
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,000
because really what it means it's a lot

493
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,120
of guessing games

494
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,199
so biohacking is really just hey i'm

495
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,839
gonna try to hack my body

496
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:46,000
i'm gonna try to trick out my body i'm

497
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:48,639
gonna try to psych out my body

498
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,240
i'm not gonna know what my body needs or

499
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,839

500
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,759
i'm just going to kind of guess with a

501
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,759
bunch of crap i find out there and then

502
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:59,199
i'm going to try to hack my body

503
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:01,440
whether my body likes it or not

504
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:03,360
you know so the bio hacking thing is

505
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,880
really kind of a tough one for me

506
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:10,000
because when i hear it i hear

507
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:12,319
really hey i don't know what's wrong

508
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,679
i don't know what my body needs i don't

509
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,160
know what i should do

510
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:19,280
but i'm just going to try to like hack

511
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:22,400
it and what i noticed with biohacking

512
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:25,439
is all the bio hacking

513
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:28,720
all the bio hacking is

514
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:30,840
really adrenaline based stuff

515
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,080
so it's like oh you got all these health

516
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,960
experts

517
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,240
and they're all bio hack experts okay

518
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,640
but really what they're doing

519
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,600
is they're teaching people how to get

520
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,520
adrenalized

521
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,720
they're teaching people how to live on

522
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,120
adrenaline

523
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,120
so health experts should really be

524
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,320
called how to get high on your own

525
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,960
adrenaline

526
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,559
not you know let's bio hack and find

527
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,440
some answers that way

528
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,960
because bio hacking's really like a lot

529
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,840
of stuff thrown out there these days

530
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,440
it's like

531
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,880
lots of cacao make sure you're doing

532
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,320
your cacao make sure you're doing your

533
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,000
apple cider vinegar

534
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,000
make sure you're doing you know lots of

535
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,919
your coffee drinks do your matcha tea

536
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,280
try that that's good for you so

537
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,039
biohacking can

538
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,559
you know and then there's also it goes

539
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,679
beyond that right so you guys i'm

540
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,679
putting brussels sprouts in there

541
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,160
biohacking is like not just caffeine

542
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,160
which

543
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,919
really that's a big one for biohacking

544
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,320
get everybody on caffeine

545
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,520
get everybody on chocolate right but

546
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,760
biohacking is also

547
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,679
high fat get everybody on a high fat

548
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,080
diet that's already been on a high fat

549
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,000
diet

550
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,760
who's already gotten sick from being on

551
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,480
a high fat diet all these years

552
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,039
and then we say hey get on a high fat

553
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,280
diet

554
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,799
you know that's another thing too so but

555
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,120
i want to talk about that a little bit

556
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,200
like

557
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,480
what happens is when you do a high fat

558
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,039
diet

559
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,960
because that's what everybody does

560
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,919
you're burning out your adrenals faster

561
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,160
than they should be

562
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,039
you're using your credit card your

563
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,880
adrenal

564
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,160
credit card something that's really

565
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:58,400
important to know

566
00:18:54,160 --> 00:19:00,240
see your adrenals are only good

567
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,240
they're only as good as how you treat

568
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:05,440
them and take care of them

569
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:07,600
and we waste them throughout the years

570
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,280
so a lot of the biohackers actually all

571
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,520
of the biohackers out there

572
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,559
are really just about wearing down your

573
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,559
adrenals

574
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,559
burning them out and one way to do that

575
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,400
is the high fat diet so what happens is

576
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,520
when you're eating all this fat

577
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,799
which you're not going to find in this

578
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,320
dish by the way when you're eating all

579
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:25,039
this fat

580
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,640
what i call radical fats your blood gets

581
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,760
thick with that fat and then your

582
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,679
adrenals

583
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,760
have to spit out all this adrenaline

584
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:35,280
pump all this adrenaline out to thin

585
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:38,400
out your blood so your adrenaline

586
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,600
becomes a blood thinner that's really

587
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,320
important to know

588
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,280
the reason why it's trying to save your

589
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,000
brain

590
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,880
your brain sends a message to your

591
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,080
adrenals

592
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,039
save me that's what your brain does send

593
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,240
adrenaline

594
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:56,720
fast because this person

595
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,440
actually dumped a ton of fat inside the

596
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,840
body

597
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,760
the fat's going to head up to the brain

598
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,120
and and take the oxygen away

599
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,440
so here's what happens when you're doing

600
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:08,880
the high fat diet you take

601
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:11,520
oxygen away from your blood

602
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,760
you lose oxygen out of your blood that

603
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:16,880
means your brain gets less oxygen

604
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:20,559
so your brain your nervous system sends

605
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,120
out a signal an alarm bell that alarm

606
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:24,240
bell

607
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:27,520
goes right to the adrenals the adrenals

608
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:29,200
then floods your bloodstream with a lot

609
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:32,400
of adrenaline

610
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:34,799
every time you eat your big fatty meal

611
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,640
okay because the health hackers and the

612
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:41,520
biohackers they want you to do that

613
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:41,520
every time you do that what happens is

614
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,400
your brain is begging for help from your

615
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,679
adrenals

616
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,280
so it's looking for help your adrenals

617
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:54,240
release all this adrenaline the

618
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:56,960
adrenaline thins out your blood

619
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,880
so your brain to save your brain to

620
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,880
protect your brain

621
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,200
it ha your adrenals have to release all

622
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:06,240
this adrenaline to thin out your blood

623
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,240
so the fat doesn't kill the brain

624
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,440
happens every day every meal you have

625
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,000
you have the bacon and eggs in the

626
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,240
morning

627
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,919
your adrenals are pumping you want to do

628
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,799
a carnivore diet adrenals are pumping

629
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,200
i'm not anti

630
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:19,039
i'm not anti-animal protein you guys i'm

631
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,159
not anti-vegan plant-based

632
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,240
i'm just telling you what happens

633
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,280
because you could be vegan you can be

634
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,360
plant-based

635
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,039
right and guess what you're on a

636
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,919
high-fat diet

637
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:31,360
um tiffany says i'm so confused you

638
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:34,480
didn't use any oil

639
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,200
no oil needed in stir fry you got a hot

640
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,760
pan

641
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,039
right here hot ceramic pan i got the

642
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,559
carrots in here i got the brussels

643
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,880
sprouts i'm cooking them down a little

644
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,559
bit

645
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,000
i got the heat on i just put a little

646
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,679
water a little touch

647
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,600
just a little water in there that's all

648
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,440
you needed to do

649
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,120
so i'll give you guys a little recap

650
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,200
this is really important to know

651
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,600
when you're told to do those high fat

652
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:58,799
diets which everybody's told to do

653
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:01,919
okay what is happening is your brain

654
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:02,960
is crying for help sends a signal down

655
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,960
to the adrenals

656
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,080
the adrenals release all this

657
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,559
epinephrine

658
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,919
to thin out your blood so that the fat

659
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,799
doesn't rob oxygen

660
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,000
from your brain right now you're on an

661
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,520
adrenal high

662
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,120
so now that's a lie a lot of people are

663
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,799
like whoa i just had that

664
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,880
i just had the animal protein i'm

665
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,960
starting to just i feel better now

666
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,880
i feel like myself what's happening is

667
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,200
you're getting the adrenaline surge

668
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,320
or say you're plant-based say you're

669
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,520
plant-based

670
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:34,080
okay say you're vegan i just ate a whole

671
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,760
pile of nuts

672
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,840
i just ate a whole bunch of macadamia

673
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:41,360
nuts i just ate a whole

674
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:43,039
whole pile of peanuts i just had a

675
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,440
two tablespoons three tablespoons of

676
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:47,039
peanut butter on my smoothie bowl

677
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,799
i just had some almond butter and almond

678
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:53,200
milk you know

679
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:54,880
i just had some butter some

680
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,559
if ghee if you're into animal protein i

681
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,159
just had some butter and so what's

682
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:01,360
happening is

683
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,000
just so you know you can be plant-based

684
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,000
and vegan

685
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,200
and you can kill your adrenals over time

686
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,200
now hey hey hey

687
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,480
sounds a little too much right you're

688
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,080
killing your adrenals

689
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,080
how can that be just because you're

690
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,640
eating a high fat diet whether it's

691
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,559
healthy

692
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,000
or not how can that be i mean this

693
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,280
doesn't sound right you guys i just cut

694
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,840
the bell pepper i showed you this the

695
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,679
other day

696
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,000
i cut the top off right there and i'm

697
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:25,840
just taking out the center

698
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,000
that's all and i got the bell pepper

699
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,200
you might be thinking it's kind of harsh

700
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,559
isn't it he's

701
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,799
he's saying that we're killing our

702
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:35,840
adrenals on the high fat diet

703
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:36,880
you know how's that possible well here's

704
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,039
how it goes

705
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,640
your adrenals don't die quick and they

706
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:43,200
don't die too easy

707
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:45,120
so they hang on because they have to

708
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,039
because that's how we stay alive

709
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,200
it's our adrenals that keep us alive

710
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,559
that's a big part of how we stay alive

711
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,919
right cutting up some

712
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:54,559
bell pepper here but here's what goes

713
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:56,159
wrong you keep on doing it you keep on

714
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,760
doing everybody has different levels

715
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,679
they have a different adrenal strengths

716
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,760
different levels of tolerance

717
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,960
some people have weaker adrenals some

718
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,640
people have one

719
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,799
one adrenal that's stronger than the

720
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:09,520
other right but then

721
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:10,799
you also get someone where it hits them

722
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,320
pretty good along the way

723
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,880
they don't know it until they have their

724
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:18,000
baby yeah

725
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:21,200
hard pregnancies are from weak

726
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,559
adrenals throughout the years from high

727
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,640
fat diets

728
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:29,679
from caffeine from chocolate okay

729
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:32,720
all right from from uh and

730
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:34,400
hard child births hard pregnancy

731
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,640
hard child birth because here's what

732
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:40,159
happens it's

733
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:43,039
in order to have a baby your adrenals

734
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:44,000
have to be supersonic they got to be

735
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:46,880
powerful

736
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,240
they got to be strong so a woman's

737
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,480
adrenals are not like

738
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,360
men's adrenals and men don't know this

739
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:55,840
so men health hackers and biohackers

740
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,600
all over the internet out there they'll

741
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,799
just tell you do lots of caffeine that's

742
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,400
how you do your matcha tea

743
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:04,159
do your cacao do your high fat diets but

744
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,080
they're not the ones that are going to

745
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:08,080
have that hard childbirth potentially or

746
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,600
the second baby being really difficult

747
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,039
because the adrenals start to weaken

748
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:14,240
over time

749
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:17,679
so what happens is you need

750
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:21,600
your adrenals working top notch

751
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:24,240
when you deliver a baby when a baby

752
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,600
is born when you birth a baby so it's

753
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,799
very important to know this

754
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,159
but there's a lot of women right now and

755
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,600
young women they're saying that was a

756
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:34,559
really difficult labor

757
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,279
the labor went four hours why the labor

758
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:38,559
went

759
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:42,159
seven hours how come the labor went two

760
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:43,039
days how come like why does it have to

761
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,720
be that hard

762
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:50,720
labor to go two days and

763
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:52,799
um and what they don't know

764
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,039
is all those years even if it was two

765
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:57,360
years even it was three years

766
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,400
of the coffee drinks the matcha tea the

767
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,600
energy drinks

768
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:03,760
the chocolate chocolate every week

769
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,760
all the cacao cacao nibs whatever

770
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:08,799
chocolate bars whatever

771
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:10,000
all of that beats down the adrenals and

772
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:11,120
here's another thing that kills the

773
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,880
adrenals for women so they have

774
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,840
difficult child births here's another

775
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,360
thing

776
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:19,840
intermittent fasting epic disaster

777
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,440
for childbirth okay years of

778
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,679
intermittent fasting

779
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,520
breaks down the adrenals because you run

780
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:28,480
on adrenaline all day

781
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:30,320
you withhold food so your adrenals have

782
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,360
to release adrenaline

783
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:35,520
to replace glucose so now

784
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,600
glucose has to be replaced that's your

785
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:40,080
blood sugar glucose right

786
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,600
so you have no glucose going on you're

787
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,799
intermittent fasting

788
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:47,360
right and you're going without food

789
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:49,919
you're on caffeine all day long

790
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:52,080
and your adrenals are flooding all day

791
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:56,640
long your adrenals are flooding all day

792
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:58,320
long see and they start to wear down

793
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,039
so then you got so here's what's

794
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:03,360
happening biohackers are teaching women

795
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:04,559
women biohackers too men biohackers are

796
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,200
teaching women

797
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:09,200
to intermittent fast the wrong way okay

798
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,880
to get all jacked up on caffeine

799
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,760
and to do high fat diets when they do

800
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:17,200
eat the combination of all three

801
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:21,039
is an epic disaster for child for for

802
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:22,559
for delivering a baby okay and

803
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:25,360
and so that's very important to know

804
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:27,039
it's also an epic disaster for future

805
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,480
hair thinning and hair loss and what

806
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,840
you'll find is women

807
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,080
end up getting hair thinning after

808
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:34,799
having a baby yeah

809
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:36,080
because it's just too much too much

810
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:39,039
happened to their adrenals

811
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:41,360
in the years before they had their baby

812
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:43,200
too many things happen to their adrenals

813
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,120
and the hair started thinning and then

814
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,159
they get the sunspots and the age spots

815
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,159
everywhere

816
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:50,000
and then they get they they get the weak

817
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,760
adrenals and then they lose energy and

818
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,559
then they need more caffeine and more

819
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:57,760
caffeine and more caffeine

820
00:27:54,559 --> 00:28:01,440
so chopping up some

821
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:03,200
orange bell pepper here so bio hackers

822
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,919
and health experts really shouldn't be

823
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,000
called

824
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,840
health experts well actually they should

825
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,520
be they're health experts to how to

826
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,760
trash your adrenals

827
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,880
weaken adrenals shorten them for the

828
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,720
long haul

829
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,320
make life more difficult for millions of

830
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,240
women and

831
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,520
even some men in some ways in different

832
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,120
ways but

833
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,720
especially for women especially for

834
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,760
women

835
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:28,320
you need your adrenals to be on point

836
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:31,840
for threatening events

837
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:36,640
hard times a divorce

838
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:41,520
a bad breakup a betrayal car accident

839
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,520
you know you can't lift up a car

840
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,600
you know out of a ditch off of somebody

841
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,360
that's trapped under it

842
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:50,000
when your adrenals have had 10 years of

843
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:52,399
caffeine 10 years of high fat diets

844
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,080
10 years of intermittent fasting you

845
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:56,320
won't get that car off that person

846
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,840
underneath that car

847
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,720
you will though if you protect your

848
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:02,960
adrenals and keep those adrenals strong

849
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,200
and not get tricked and fooled by

850
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:08,480
biohackers

851
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:10,399
so something really important to know

852
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,080
um i got some red bell peppers here i

853
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:13,679
got some orange bell peppers i got some

854
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,200
brussels sprouts in here too and i got

855
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,720
some carrots i'm making a stir fry it's

856
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,320
called sweet and sour stir-fry

857
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,080
if you guys just got on here it's a

858
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,640
medical medium new addition right here a

859
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,640
recipe

860
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,640
right out of this brand new book coming

861
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:27,600
out that's the recipe i'm making

862
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,880
so i just want to let you know and

863
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,039
here's the other thing

864
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,320
your adrenals are what creates the most

865
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:33,840
important hormones

866
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,320
so everybody's worried about hormones my

867
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,919
hormones my hormones my hormones doctor

868
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,120
says worry about my hormones

869
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:42,000
doctor says she's worried about my

870
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:44,159
hormones my reproductive system

871
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,440
my hormones maybe my hormones are off

872
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,760
that's what you'll hear right

873
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,799
your your adrenals are the hormone

874
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,279
makers

875
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:52,640
the liver is the second hormone maker

876
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:55,840
but the adrenals

877
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:59,200
that's the big one that's your estrogen

878
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:00,559
that's your that is where that's where

879
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,480
it's happening right there

880
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:03,600
it's those adrenals so that's your

881
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,679
testosterone

882
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,440
you need that testosterone that's your

883
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,919
estrogen those adrenals

884
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,600
are what's cranking that out every day

885
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:13,200
so when you're worried about hormones

886
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,240
and you say well my doctor says my

887
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,320
hormones are off

888
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,840
my nutritionist said maybe my hormones

889
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,240
are off you know

890
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:22,000
you know all that well guess what at the

891
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,679
same time your nutritionist is going to

892
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,159
tell you to do the high fat diet tell

893
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:25,760
you

894
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:28,000
matcha tea is just fine eat lots of

895
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,679
chocolate it's good for you studies say

896
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,520
and they're going to tell you that and

897
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,880
then they're going to tell you with all

898
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,000
that and the coffee and the coffee

899
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,760
drinks and

900
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,360
the chocolate and the intermittent

901
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,200
fasting they're going to tell you to do

902
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,720
with all that combined and then they'll

903
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,919
say hey you know what

904
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,279
and all that's going to be killing your

905
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:45,520
adrenals which is going to mess up your

906
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:47,440
hormones more and more and more and more

907
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,679
but then they're going to say why don't

908
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,159
you do some hot yoga

909
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,600
why don't you do some hot yoga that's an

910
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:55,120
adrenal destroyer

911
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,640
right there i got nothing against yoga i

912
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,919
think it's great i think you know i

913
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:01,039
think it's great

914
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:02,720
hot yoga it's ridiculous it's actually

915
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:04,799
the adrenal crusher

916
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,640
what hot yoga does if you do it long

917
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:08,320
term will make sure that when you do

918
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,480
want to have that baby

919
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,399
that's going to be a hard birth okay not

920
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:15,120
everybody because their adrenals are

921
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:16,960
maybe stronger than someone else's but

922
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,559
eventually it catches up to everybody

923
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,919
and it catches up to them later on in

924
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:23,279
life in different ways

925
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:25,600
maybe fatigue maybe aging faster

926
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:27,679
maybe you know sensitive nervous systems

927
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,399
from adrenaline pumping through them so

928
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,039
much

929
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:31,679
so health experts and biohackers are

930
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:35,200
really

931
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:36,799
adrenal destroyer experts

932
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,279
they promote everything that destroys

933
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:40,880
adrenals shortens women's lives as far

934
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:43,120
as aging them faster

935
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,559
making life more difficult and then

936
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:47,519
they'll tell you to do the saunas

937
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:49,279
with a really high temps you know really

938
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:52,399
high temperatures they'll say

939
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:55,440
do the saunas high temperatures true

940
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:56,399
130 degree 150 degrees stay in there for

941
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,519
40 minutes

942
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:01,360
whatever and what you'll do is right on

943
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:03,919
the edge of hyperthermia

944
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,880
your body goes into shock and goes into

945
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,120
crisis

946
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:09,039
and then you and then that high comes

947
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,159
out because your adrenals are flooding

948
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:12,240
in for dear life

949
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:13,760
your brain's saying you're cooking my

950
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,960
freaking brain

951
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:18,240
your brain is telling your adrenals god

952
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,399
help me you're cooking

953
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,159
my brain so you're sitting there being

954
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:24,720
told to do these really hot

955
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:25,600
hot hot yoga you're doing the real hot

956
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,120
saunas

957
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,360
you've got the temperature really high

958
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:31,440
you're told to stay in there longer

959
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,799
and what's happening is your brain is

960
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,760
starting to cook

961
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:36,399
and then it's calling for adrenaline to

962
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,760
save

963
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:41,200
its life which is your life so

964
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,960
the adrenals are flooding all this

965
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,120
adrenaline by the time you're 30 minutes

966
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:48,000
40 minutes into your hot sauna

967
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:49,120
which is another brainiac really silly

968
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,039
idea

969
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,320
and then your adrenals are now like

970
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:54,000
you're wasting them and

971
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,320
wasting them and then you feel high

972
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,360
after that sauna that really hot one i'm

973
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,960
not talking about going into the

974
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,159
infrared sauna for five minutes 10

975
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,000
minutes 20 minutes

976
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:03,519
you know at a reasonable temp i'm

977
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,399
talking about

978
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:07,039
you know not even like 105 whatever you

979
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:08,799
know

980
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:10,880
the point is is you're going in high

981
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:12,799
temperatures in these saunas now

982
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,480
and what you're doing is you're getting

983
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:16,640
high off of adrenaline so

984
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,519
biohackers and health experts are

985
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,320
experts

986
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:22,960
at destroying your adrenals shortening

987
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:25,279
and aging your life

988
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,399
setting you up for misery later on when

989
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:27,919
you're in your 40s

990
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:29,679
so when you're 22 and you're doing your

991
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:31,440
hot saunas and it sounds like a great

992
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:32,799
idea and you got these cool guys and

993
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,320
cool people whatever

994
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:36,240
and telling you what to do you do this

995
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,960
hot sauna you crank it up

996
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,919
and now you get high afterwards they're

997
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,880
still robbing

998
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:43,760
and stealing they're vampires that are

999
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,120
robbing

1000
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:50,799
and stealing your adrenaline reserves

1001
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:52,640
breaking down your adrenals and

1002
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:54,159
yeah saunas are very healing when you

1003
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:57,440
use them right

1004
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:59,679
but see biohackers and health experts

1005
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,880
they don't use a lot of things right

1006
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:02,640
they don't

1007
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,080
and the same thing with cold plungers

1008
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,720
and cold

1009
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,679
and you know cold plunges okay that's

1010
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,879
another thing too

1011
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:12,960
any kind of cold shock therapy all right

1012
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:16,480
it's any kind of cold shock therapy i'm

1013
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,480
gonna get some asparagus in here now

1014
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:22,320
anything in the hypothermic realm so

1015
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,839
when you sit there and you freeze

1016
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,159
yourself

1017
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:28,000
what you're doing is you're putting your

1018
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,760
body in shock and then your adrenals are

1019
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,599
now cooking again they're cranking

1020
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,200
your adrenals are now flooding again you

1021
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:34,720
see how it works

1022
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,639
so now you're killing your adrenals

1023
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:37,919
again because your brain's saying you're

1024
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:41,280
freezing me

1025
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:44,639
see so when you do the cold plunges

1026
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,119
and the cold therapies your brain is

1027
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:48,560
saying

1028
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:50,800
okay now you're freezing you're freezing

1029
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:53,200
my ass off is what your brain's saying

1030
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,480
send out the adrenaline army send out

1031
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,159
the adrenaline reserves

1032
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,480
because we need adrenaline here because

1033
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:01,680
you're putting me in shock

1034
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,640
so it's not just the heat it's also the

1035
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,760
cold

1036
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,880
see it's life threatening in the entire

1037
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,320
brain

1038
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,760
so how do you use this karen how do you

1039
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,520
use the sauna correctly you can use an

1040
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,920
infrared sun you can also use a steam

1041
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:15,760
shower steam bath sauna steam

1042
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,200
so you can do that but you don't cook

1043
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,280
yourself you stay in there

1044
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,800
for a little while you need to do 15 20

1045
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,280
minutes do 10 minutes

1046
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,320
keep the temps reasonable don't keep

1047
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,280
them blaring

1048
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:29,280
and don't be a hero because the

1049
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,960
biohackers

1050
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,400
what they do is they don't care about

1051
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,640
women's health really

1052
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,520
they're usually men and they usually

1053
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,359
tell you

1054
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:39,680
to just push it to the limit push it to

1055
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:41,520
the max and that's what they do

1056
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,760
and so they'll end up saying they won't

1057
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,920
do something they won't be protective

1058
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:48,000
over women they won't be like no be

1059
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,599
cautious keep the heat at a reasonable

1060
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,920
rate just be in there for a certain

1061
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:53,680
amount of time check out how you feel

1062
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,599
you won't hear any of that you'll hear

1063
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,040
here's what you do here's the new trend

1064
00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:00,160
here's a new fad

1065
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:02,320
crank it you know and do it every day do

1066
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:05,359
your sauna crank the heat up

1067
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:07,520
and and then people get damaged

1068
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:09,119
they get damaged later on you might not

1069
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:11,119
sense it in the moment you might not

1070
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:13,359
sense it in the first year or two

1071
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:14,800
you'll sense it later on and then your

1072
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:16,880
adrenals are cooked

1073
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:19,440
things are actually you're in a lot

1074
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,720
difficult situation with your health

1075
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,560
and if you're somebody with chronic

1076
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:25,359
illness if you have anything going on if

1077
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:27,200

lupus forget that symptoms how about

1079
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:31,440
symptoms you know feel good you got

1080
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:33,280

1084
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,320
any of that you got to be careful you do

1085
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,880
the sauna carefully

1086
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,440
do the infrared one you can do a steam

1087
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:47,040

carefully so you be mindful

1089
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,160

00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,240
to tell you guys because that just

1091
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:55,359

everybody's honoring their body

1099
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,880
everybody's so careful

1100
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:14,000
on that level where they're like hey i'm

1101
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,200
honoring my body

1102
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,800

1103
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:22,400
so spiritual

1104
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:24,320
right and meanwhile

1105
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,520
they're not listening to their body

1106
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:29,680
they're not

1107
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:32,880
you know being spiritual is about

1108
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:35,359
letting some things go like vices

1109
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,640
and it's okay if you can't let a vice go

1110
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:39,200
it's all right

1111
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,720
that's okay i get it some people need

1112
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,880
devices absolutely

1113
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:45,040
they need them to survive life is hard

1114
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:48,240
i'm putting green onion in here

1115
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:50,320
scallions but

1116
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:52,880
there's a lot of people these days

1117
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:56,079
they're acting like spiritual experts

1118
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:58,320
acting like they're so spiritual

1119
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:00,000
and they're literally intermittent fast

1120
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,599
intermittent fasting they're on caffeine

1121
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,040
all day long they're doing all this

1122
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:04,720
caffeine on their body they're doing

1123
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:07,839
chocolate all day

1124
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:09,040
and being spiritual is living without a

1125
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:11,599
little bit you know what i mean

1126
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:13,520
being spiritual is learning how to let

1127
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:17,200
go of vice

1128
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:20,720
and then feeling what that feeling is

1129
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:24,240
being spiritual is being able to like

1130
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:25,920
give your body something truly back so

1131
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,240
instead of saying everybody's honoring

1132
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:31,040
their body you know what own it

1133
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:32,000
okay just finally own it you're not

1134
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:35,440
honoring your body

1135
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:39,119
totally be straight out be honest please

1136
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:41,760
okay you know what i mean because

1137
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:43,520
if you really were to honor your body

1138
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,720
you'd break out of the caffeine

1139
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:48,240
addiction

1140
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:50,800
let it go and fix what's wrong

1141
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,720
the caffeine hides everything so it's

1142
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,320
hiding everything for everybody it's got

1143
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,960
them on a big high

1144
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,320
and look look i'm not judging anybody i

1145
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:01,680
look i know some people

1146
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:03,280
had some hard lives hard lives and

1147
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,720
that cup of coffee pushes them through

1148
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:08,480
their day okay

1149
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:09,839
and i got friends with hard lives and

1150
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,320
you know they were like look i'm working

1151
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:14,720
on it i'm like totally i totally get it

1152
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,520
it's just that some of the friends i

1153
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,520
have

1154
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,200
they're not saying how down they how how

1155
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,320
they got it all down they're not saying

1156
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,160
how spiritual they are

1157
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,760
acting so spiritual they're not

1158
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,800
pretending on their youtube channels how

1159
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,200
spiritual they are

1160
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:29,280
you know they're straight out they're

1161
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,240
saying i got a lot of work to do you

1162
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,400
know they're humble

1163
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,599
i got a lot of work to do i'm trying to

1164
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,920
honor my body

1165
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:37,920
but i'm just not there yet you know

1166
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,680
right now life's hard i'm pushing

1167
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:43,440
through each hour man

1168
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:45,920
anthony i'm pushing through hour by hour

1169
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,119
and i know i need to work on stuff and

1170
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,480
at least i know

1171
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:50,400
and that's the key right there but

1172
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,839
what's happening here is people are

1173
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,160
being told

1174
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:55,520
things are good for them now everybody's

1175
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,880
saying hey the caffeine caffeine's good

1176
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,480
for you everybody's saying the coffee

1177
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,960
drinks and the chocolate is so good for

1178
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,119
you

1179
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,000
and then everybody's like i'm honoring

1180
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:05,119
my body

1181
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,960
i'm being so spiritual i'm you know i'm

1182
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:09,599
i'm a health expert now

1183
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,000
and come on let's just be real a little

1184
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:13,200
bit

1185
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,880
because if you removed that caffeine

1186
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,720
you would notice depression starts to

1187
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,400
kick in you'd notice that fatigue starts

1188
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,040
to kick in you can't do your workouts

1189
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,560
anymore

1190
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,240
you know that anxiety would start

1191
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,040
kicking in and that's when you honor

1192
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,960
your body

1193
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,560
that's when you're spiritual because

1194
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,560
you're without your vice

1195
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,599
and you're honoring your body and you

1196
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,280
start

1197
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:33,760
and you start you know and you get off

1198
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,680
that high fat diet and you realize whoa

1199
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,280
wait a minute what's wrong here honoring

1200
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:39,440
your body is

1201
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,960
finding out what's really wrong too it's

1202
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:43,280
it's about hey

1203
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,960
i got a problem i can't focus and

1204
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,839
concentrate without my caffeine

1205
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:49,839
how do i fix this you know i can't

1206
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:51,520
function without my caffeine i can't do

1207
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:53,440
my two hour workouts now every day

1208
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:57,200
because without my caffeine

1209
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:59,440
or how about this i got to keep my

1210
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:01,520
caffeine in order to function

1211
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,480
i know it's not good for me i know it's

1212
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,760
a drug

1213
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:05,680
you know i know everybody's trying to

1214
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:09,200
pretend it's good for you now

1215
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:11,760
but you know honoring honoring you

1216
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:13,440
honoring your body is really about being

1217
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,720
self-aware for real like really

1218
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,440
self-actualized

1219
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,319
really self-realized it's about saying

1220
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,119
hey

00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:22,160
you know i know i need work you know

1222
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:24,079

1223
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,280
humbling a little bit about knowing you

1224
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:27,440

1227
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,760

never had any problems you're young and

1299
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:10,640
everything's taken care of for you and

1300
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,319
you're out there promoting the heck out

1301
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:14,480
of a

1302
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:16,079
a caffeine product and it's keeping you

1303
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,839
running around like crazy and it's

1304
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:18,480
hiding your anxiety and it's hiding your

1305
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:20,319
fatigue

1306
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,000
and it's hiding your depression and

1307
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:23,680
you're telling another hundred thousand

1308
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,880
people or fifty thousand people that

1309
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:29,440
they should be jacked up on caffeine too

1310
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,640
it's not really honoring your body or

1311
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,000
others

1312
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:34,319
or teaching them how to intermittent

1313
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,160
fast wrong getting some lime juice here

1314
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:37,680
okay two tablespoons of lime juice in

1315
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:41,359
this

1316
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:41,359
i'm gonna put some grated ginger in here

1317
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:46,560
you know when you're a health expert

1318
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:48,480
you're supposed to protect people right

1319
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:50,000
that's what you're supposed to do and

1320
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:53,119
you're supposed to give in

1321
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:56,160
a little bit right give in

1322
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:59,680
be honest be truthful

1323
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:02,720
about what you're doing it's like

1324
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:04,960
protecting people is the number one

1325
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:07,440
thing that should be in your soul and on

1326
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:10,560
your mind as a health expert

1327
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,960
that's the critical thing that you gotta

1328
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:14,480
be

1329
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,480
and it's hard to protect people when

1330
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:18,160
you know you're training them to be

1331
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,839
jacked up on caffeine

1332
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:21,680
training them to lose their adrenal

1333
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:22,880
strength so they have difficult

1334
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,160
childbirths later

1335
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,680
training them for all these things so

1336
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,880
i'm going to put i got it next thing i'm

1337
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:29,920
going to put a little

1338
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:31,680
tomato paste in here that's what i'm

1339
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:34,319
doing now

1340
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,319
get a spoon

1341
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:39,200
so right now i have a cup of pineapple

1342
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:41,200
juice in here

1343
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:42,319
all right so i got that i'm going to put

1344
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:45,280
some tomato paste

1345
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:48,640
a couple teaspoons in here or a couple

1346
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:51,200
tablespoons of tomato paste in the sauce

1347
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,200
there we go

1348
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,520
so i got that in there now i'm going to

1349
00:45:55,839 --> 00:46:01,839
grate some ginger that's going to go in

1350
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:01,839
here too

1351
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:13,680
and the whole biohacking thing is really

1352
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:16,640
kind of

1353
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:18,160
interesting when you think about it it's

1354
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:21,119
really a guessing game

1355
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:22,480
and i noticed all biohackers these days

1356
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:24,079
just want to make sure that whatever

1357
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,319
they're offering for advice most of it

1358
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:29,599
means killing your adrenals

1359
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:34,160
that's what it means you know maybe

1360
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:36,000
maybe it doesn't matter right who cares

1361
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:37,680
i mean should we really care just let

1362
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
people do what they want to do

1363
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:43,760
let them do what makes them happy let

1364
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:45,200
them um let them get the hair thinning

1365
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:47,440
you know all the women getting the hair

1366
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:49,440
thinning let the age spots happen let

1367
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,240
the wrinkled skin happen real fast the

1368
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:53,520
wrinkles

1369
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:53,520
when they shouldn't be happening

1370
00:46:53,599 --> 00:47:00,160
menopause symptoms coming on faster

1371
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:01,839
right losing precious hormones critical

1372
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:03,040
hormones for the whole body

1373
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:05,119
so that you're not in the doctor's

1374
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:07,599
office every single day

1375
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:08,880
you know all worried about the hormones

1376
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:12,480
right

1377
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:14,400
so i don't know i mean shouldn't we care

1378
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,000
or what about if you get you have an

1379
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,520
experience someday you pick up some bugs

1380
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:21,200
you pick up some epstein bar

1381
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:22,800
i got some some grated ginger in here

1382
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:25,839
what if you pick up a new epstein bar

1383
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,839
and you get really sick

1384
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:31,200
and your adrenals can't handle it

1385
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:34,400
so i'm going to do some garlic too i'm

1386
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,400
going to mince up some garlic

1387
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:40,640
you want your adrenal strong you guys

1388
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:43,839
you want your adrenals strong for what

1389
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:46,720
gets thrown at you in your lifetime

1390
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:48,800
and so adrenal robbers which are

1391
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:50,559
basically vampires in the health field

1392
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,640
now there's tons of them out there tons

1393
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:55,680
of vampires in the health field now

1394
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:58,000
they'll teach you how to rob

1395
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:59,520
and kill your adrenals right they'll

1396
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,880
teach you that matcha tea is good for

1397
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:03,200
you all that caffeine they'll teach you

1398
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:05,680
cacao is all good for you so you

1399
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:07,440
just ruin your adrenals so they're the

1400
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:10,000
real thieves right

1401
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:12,559
but i'm going to put some garlic in here

1402
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,559
too you guys

1403
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:23,040
then they'll go on podcasts

1404
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:23,760
talk about all the scientific studies

1405
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:26,559
well you know

1406
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:28,400
last when i checked no one ever got

1407
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:30,480
better from a scientific study ever in

1408
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:32,640
chronic illness

1409
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:34,880
so i guess you could wait for another 20

1410
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:37,839
years for scientific studies to come out

1411
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:39,280
to get you better but we've already

1412
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:40,880
waited 50 70 years

1413
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:43,200
for scientific studies to get everybody

1414
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:46,000
better at chronic illness but

1415
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:47,280
but last i checked there's no study that

1416
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,319
fixes anybody

1417
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:52,160
um can you show me a study somewhere

1418
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:54,240
that gets somebody out of a wheelchair

1419
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:55,920
with ms

1420
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:57,520
okay so let's do i put the garlic in

1421
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,920

got that

1430
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:24,319

00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:29,599
stop somebody from having the worst

1432
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:31,040

that way adrenal high adrenal high

1481
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:23,119
because when you go without glucose

1482
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:25,119
your adrenals replace the glucose and

1483
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:26,720
flood flood flood flood and it makes you

1484
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:28,559
do more chocolate more caffeine more

1485
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:30,160
coffee drinks more matcha tea more green

1486
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:31,280
tea whatever more energy drinks

1487
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:33,760
and you're just doing the intermittent

1488
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:35,599
fasting like that so there's more people

1489
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:37,119
doing that more people doing

1490
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:38,720
the hot saunas but i'm talking about the

1491
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:41,599
hot saunas right long

1492
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:43,680
long time in there 40 minutes more heat

1493
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:44,240
cranked up until you go into that crisis

1494
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:46,000
and then your

1495
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:47,760
adrenals flood like crazy and you come

1496
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,240
out like oh my god i feel so good i'm

1497
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:52,800
high

1498
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:52,800
and you're totally high on adrenaline

1499
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,960
and then you know you do the apple cider

1500
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:01,040
vinegar and you kill your stomach glands

1501
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:04,880
with the apple cider vinegar

1502
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:07,920
you kill your stomach glands and

1503
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:09,200
once you kill your stomach glands you're

1504
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:11,599
going to need adrenaline too

1505
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,960
to help digest your food so then people

1506
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:13,599
do this thing where they don't get it

1507
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,960
but

1508
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:17,200
once your stomach lands start getting

1509
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:19,040
eaten up start getting eaten up and

1510
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:21,119
weakened from apple cider vinegar eaten

1511
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:22,800
up and weakened from caffeine once those

1512
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:25,280
once a stomach lands the things that

1513
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:27,200
make your gastric juices and your hcl

1514
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,720
once they start weakening then you're

1515
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:30,720
going to need more adrenaline to

1516
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:32,079
try to digest food and try to get

1517
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:35,520
peristaltic action

1518
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:35,520
you're gonna need more adrenaline

1519
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:43,119
so basically i guess the talk today

1520
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:44,559
is information today the trendy stuff

1521
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:46,400
that's happening in the health experts

1522
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:49,359
in the biohackers today

1523
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:51,359
are really promoting how to kill and

1524
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:53,119
destroy your adrenals

1525
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:54,720
which inevitably will shorten your life

1526
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:56,160
make your life more miserable later on

1527
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,280
and you'll never be able to connect the

1528
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:59,440
dots

1529
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:01,119
why is my hair falling out i'm a woman

1530
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:02,079

1531
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:04,400
happening

um let me go to another doctor it's

1535
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:12,880

1539
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,520
and then you start getting sick with all

1540
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:20,880

the

1549
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:35,920
biohackers they're just out to basically

1550
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:40,000
rob and steal

1551
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:42,079
theft and basically rape and pillage

1552
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,640

1561
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:09,119
lot of adrenaline you weaken the adrenal

1562
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:12,960
glands from doing it

00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:26,720
that information it heals

1569
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:28,400
advanced information that's now that i

1570
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:30,240
published first that science research is

1571
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:33,599
stealing

1572
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:34,480
um what do i know st mason says but i

1573
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:37,359
would love it if

1574
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:38,880
anthony could clarify on cold showers

1575
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:41,920
cold showers are fine

1576
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:45,359
it's just cold showers are fine i just

1577
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:47,920
wouldn't um if you're okay

1578
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:49,040
if you're struggling with a condition

1579
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:51,200
you're not well

1580
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:52,319
you got some fatigue cold showers aren't

1581
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:54,160
great meaning

1582
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:57,119
freezing cold showers where you shock

1583
00:54:54,160 --> 00:55:00,319
your body staying in there too long

1584
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:03,440
like bringing your body temperature down

1585
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:06,319
not a great thing okay

1586
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:08,480
you don't want like ice cold do a cool

1587
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:09,680
shower where you feel a little bit of

1588
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:12,799
that shock right

1589
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:13,280
just don't go ice cold don't be jumping

1590
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:16,240
into

1591
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:18,000
you know like the ice and and staying in

1592
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:19,040
there too long because you're gonna be

1593
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,559
on adrenaline

1594
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:22,319
straight adrenaline when you're in the

1595
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:22,720
shower right and you just flip it to

1596
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:23,839
cold

1597
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:26,319
and you're in the shower and you flip it

1598
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:28,319
right to cold okay

1599
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:30,640
and that hits you and you go like this

1600
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:30,640
you're like

1601
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,359
is the waters hitting you your adrenals

1602
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:36,640
are flooding

1603
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:38,640
that's what's happening they're going

1604
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:40,559
crazy and you're getting adrenaline

1605
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:42,319
surges adrenaline high

1606
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:43,599
you don't want to do too much of it you

1607
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:45,119
don't want to get let it get out of

1608
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:47,200
control and if you got some health

1609
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:50,079
issues of any kind

1610
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:50,079
probably wouldn't do it at all

1611
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:54,400
what's wrong with hot yoga i'll tell you

1612
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:57,200
what's wrong what happens is when you're

1613
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:58,640
pushing yourself in that kind of heat a

1614
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:02,000
lot of studios keep it

1615
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:04,559
really really hot on hot weather days

1616
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,480
on top of it so outside of the studio

1617
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:07,839
could be like a 90 degree day where

1618
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:09,119
depending on where you are during the

1619
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:11,599
summer or whatever it is

1620
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:13,440
so it's already your body's already

1621
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:14,960
elevating at a much higher temperature

1622
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,680
your body's trying to cool itself

1623
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,440
already

1624
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:20,319
then you're going to do hot you go into

1625
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:21,920
a hot yoga studio they got it cranked up

1626
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:23,520
and you're sitting there for an hour

1627
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:25,359
session sometimes hour and a half

1628
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:26,559
session i've seen hot yoga sessions two

1629
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:28,640
hours i've seen them

1630
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:30,200
even less or whatever but what you're

1631
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:33,119
doing is you're going into

1632
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:35,200
hyperthermia so now you're go but but

1633
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:37,119
your will your free will is making you

1634
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:38,720
do it like i gotta do this i gotta push

1635
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:39,599
through with everybody else to this hot

1636
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:41,920
yoga

1637
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:43,680
you can't stop me i gotta do it i gotta

1638
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:45,280
show everybody i can do it too

1639
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:46,960
so everybody's in there and everybody's

1640
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:48,160
like and they're breathing and they're

1641
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:50,079
doing their hot yoga

1642
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:51,200
meanwhile your brain is saying you're

1643
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:53,680
cooking me baby

1644
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:55,200
you're cooking me so hey i need

1645
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:57,119
adrenaline so now your

1646
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:59,119
your adrenals are surging and purging

1647
00:56:57,119 --> 00:56:59,760
and purging by the end of that whole

1648
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:02,000
session

1649
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:03,599
you're high on adrenaline because your

1650
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,720
brain almost cooked because you had to

1651
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:07,920
use adrenaline

1652
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:08,559
it's hard on the system then you end up

1653
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,880
getting that

1654
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:12,400
that adrenal fatigue hormone imbalance

1655
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:13,839
imbalances later

1656
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:15,680
you get if you're if you're young and

1657
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:17,200
you're trying to have a baby

1658
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:18,240
you're you're there's a good chance

1659
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,760
you're going to have a difficult

1660
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:21,920
childbirth

1661
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:23,359

1679
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:04,079
start and i'm proud of you

1680
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:05,440
28 day cleanse you could do longer term

1681
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:06,319
you can do it longer you can ask your

1682
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:08,079
doctor too

1683
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:09,680
how long your doctor wants you to be on

1684
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:11,359
it if you feel for your health

1685
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:13,440
healthcare practitioner and so forth but

1686
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:14,799
the 28 day a lot of medical doctors know

1687
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:16,559
about medical medium information

1688
00:58:14,799 --> 00:58:18,000
thousands of them across the country use

1689
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:19,359
medical medium information the books and

1690
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:23,040
everything in their practices

1691
00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:23,520
but but the 20-day cleanse is one aspect

1692
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:25,760
but

1693
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:28,240
looking at where your condition is like

1694
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:29,839
say it's adrenal fatigue so

1695
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:32,400
if you were diagnosed with adrenal

1696
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:33,280
fatigue or do you have neurological

1697
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:35,520
fatigue

1698
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:37,599
too which is your nervous system being

1699
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:39,760
affected by a little bit of epstein-barr

1700
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:41,200
because adrenal fatigue is one thing but

1701
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:43,839
you can have also

1702
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:44,720
chronic fatigue which is neurological

1703
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:46,799
fatigue

1704
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:48,799
which means your fatigue for other

1705
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:50,720
reasons besides your adrenals even

1706
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:53,680
though the adrenals could be part of it

1707
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:54,319
that's when it's important to have like

1708
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:56,319
you know

1709
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:58,640
like in here there's an adrenal section

1710
00:58:56,319 --> 00:58:59,920
in here shows supplements and protocols

1711
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:01,359
and dosages

1712
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:02,720
i mean you can talk to your practitioner

1713
00:59:01,359 --> 00:59:04,799
and show your practitioner's book in the

1714
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:08,559
section in there and you can see there's

1715
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:11,760
more you can do so not only can you do

1716
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:13,520
the 28-day cleanse right not only can

1717
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:15,760
you do the 28-day cleanse

1718
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:17,599
but you can do supplements too and in

1719
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:19,440
here i have them all listed in here too

1720
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:21,440
supplements for the for the adrenals and

1721
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:22,480
here and you can take a little bit at a

1722
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:24,960
time and start

1723
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:26,880
reinforcing your adrenals that way if

1724
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:30,400
your fatigue persists

1725
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:32,799
you might have some neurological fatigue

1726
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:34,400
which is some chronic fatigue syndrome

1727
00:59:32,799 --> 00:59:36,160
from epstein barr

1728
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:38,079
that's happening then you want to go

1729
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:39,359
anti-viral which these books provide all

1730
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:40,880
that information you can take them to

1731
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:43,280
your doctor so forth and talk to them

1732
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:43,280
about it

1733
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:48,160

so there it is i think mine

1757
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:06,240
here versus mine that was made here when

1758
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:08,880
i made this i think i chopped it a

1759
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:08,880
little differently

1760
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:16,000
but that's the recipe right there

1761
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:17,920
listen you guys your body wants to know

1762
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:20,240
you're in it with them your body wants

1763
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:22,960
to know you're on the same page

1764
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:24,240
your body is always up against what we

1765
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:26,559
think

1766
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:27,680
we should do or what we get told what we

1767
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:31,040
should do out there

1768
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:34,000
if we're told caffeine's okay our bodies

1769
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:34,880
like its pants it's like wait a

1770
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,160
minute

1771
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:38,000
wait a minute you're going to dump all

1772
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:39,280
that caffeine in me you're going to do

1773
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,200
that to me what do you mean the

1774
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:42,559
communication breakdown between your

1775
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:45,119
actual body

1776
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:46,000
and your free will and your will to do

1777
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:47,680
things

1778
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,200
you see what i'm talking about that's

1779
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:51,760
where the problem is so

1780
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:53,280
it's like that's why i kind of like it

1781
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:54,720
pains me to see a little bit out there

1782
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:56,240
when people are like so spiritually

1783
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:58,079
connected and they're so they got their

1784
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:59,760
health down so good and their intuition

1785
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:02,000
so great but their bodies like

1786
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:03,039
freaking out saying why are you killing

1787
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,880
me man

1788
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:06,319
why are you killing my adrenals who told

1789
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:07,440
you to eat a chocolate bar every single

1790
01:02:06,319 --> 01:02:09,599
day

1791
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:10,720
90 child who told you to eat cacao nibs

1792
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:12,640
every single day like that

1793
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:14,640
good or something with all that caffeine

1794
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:17,200
your adrenals are just getting toasted

1795
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:18,720
it's like who told you to go into a

1796
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:20,559
sauna for too long

1797
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:22,400
with such a high heat like who told you

1798
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:24,160
to jump into ice and

1799
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:25,760
and freeze yourself to hyperthermia

1800
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:26,960
level to your adrenals freak out who

1801
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:29,359
told you to go into a

1802
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:30,000
yoga studio with the heat being at 105

1803
01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:31,920
degrees

1804
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,920
on a 100 degree day outside during the

1805
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:36,000
summer time with your body going into

1806
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:37,520
total hyperthermia like who told you so

1807
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,799
your adrenals have to clean up all the

1808
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:42,079
mess your body

1809
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:44,400
your body is just like freaking out and

1810
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:46,160
it needs those adrenal reserves for the

1811
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:48,319
long haul who told you to intermittent

1812
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:49,760
fast what it was some brainiac idea from

1813
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:51,680
somebody to make sure you're jacked up

1814
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:53,359
on caffeine all day and no food

1815
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:54,799
and then you eat a high fat meal at the

1816
01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:56,240
end of the day which also kills your

1817
01:02:54,799 --> 01:02:59,039
adrenals

1818
01:02:56,240 --> 01:03:00,400
it's never ending throw in a whole bunch

1819
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:01,839
of other stuff too

1820
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:03,200
and then while you're intermittent fast

1821
01:03:01,839 --> 01:03:05,520
and then have chocolate at the end of

1822
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:07,440
the night like two on top of it

1823
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:09,359
so maybe even chocolate ice cream you

1824
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:10,880
intermittent fast all day long and then

1825
01:03:09,359 --> 01:03:12,079
boom you have your big fatty meal at the

1826
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:13,520
end of the day and then you have some

1827
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:14,720
chocolate or something else or maybe

1828
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:16,799
some weed

1829
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:18,400
so now you know some weed at the end of

1830
01:03:16,799 --> 01:03:20,640
the day smoking weed

1831
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:21,599
i'm not judging anybody people do all

1832
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:25,039
kinds of stuff

1833
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:26,240
i'm just saying our body what it wants

1834
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:28,240
to do

1835
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:30,240
could be a lot different than what we

1836
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:33,359
want to do you know

1837
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:34,160
like our body might be thinking a lot

1838
01:03:33,359 --> 01:03:37,200
different than

1839
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:39,920
what we're thinking right heather says

1840
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:41,520
that's a crazy diet

1841
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:43,599
our body's thinking differently you see

1842
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:46,640
what i mean so

01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:48,640
and bipolar and depersonalization and

1875
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:50,960
ocd

1876
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:53,280
and but everybody's too busy just trying

1877
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:54,079
to rob and steal and theft everybody's

1878
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:55,760
adrenaline

1879
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:57,760
and vampire the hell out of their

1880
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:59,599
adrenals and kill them faster

1881
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:01,920
and making sure that young women have

1882
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:03,440
really difficult second child births or

1883
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:05,280
first child births or third ones where

1884
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:06,319
it's epic disaster because their

1885
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:09,039
adrenals are saying

1886
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:11,039
dear god i just did 10 years of caffeine

1887
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:12,640
and 10 years of all this other stuff

1888
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:14,640
and no one protected me and told me

1889
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:16,319
about it and now i'm just crapping out

1890
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:18,000
while i'm trying to have a baby

1891
01:05:16,319 --> 01:05:19,599
and that's what the adrenals that's what

1892
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,280
they do and that's why some women will

1893
01:05:19,599 --> 01:05:23,839
be in labor for two days because their

1894
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:25,680
adrenals can't cut the mustard

1895
01:05:23,839 --> 01:05:27,039
because they've been doing caffeine for

1896
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:29,920
the last five years

1897
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:31,440
six seven years and every and these

1898
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:32,960
podcast doctors are sitting on the

1899
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:34,559
podcast they'll be like much

1900
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:37,039
tea is good for you yeah i drink it

1901
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:38,640
every day oh it's got antioxidants every

1902
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:40,400
woman should be drinking their caffeine

1903
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:44,000
every single day

1904
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:47,760
and that's how it works but like i said

1905
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,760
what do i know right

1906
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:53,200
you know what do i know it's a you know

1907
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:57,520
it's

1908
01:05:53,200 --> 01:06:00,559
it's funny because it's like

1909
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:02,240
the key is let's just be all straight

1910
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:06,079
out and honest about it

1911
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:08,880
let's just be open about stuff

1912
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:09,920
and let's see the reality of it see

1913
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:11,359
let's

1914
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:12,400
i'm tired of hearing people say they're

1915
01:06:11,359 --> 01:06:14,079
going to speak their truth or they're

1916
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:16,799
speaking their truth or

1917
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:18,480
truth truth or whatever it is and it's

1918
01:06:16,799 --> 01:06:20,480
not really truth

1919
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:22,640
i just like to do real truth that's what

1920
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:24,079
i like to do like real truth

1921
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:25,680
and there's a difference between real

1922
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:27,839
truth and bs

1923
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:28,880
truth or fake truth there's a big

1924
01:06:27,839 --> 01:06:30,799
difference

1925
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:32,000
and yeah i'm the only one going against

1926
01:06:30,799 --> 01:06:34,640
the caffeine industry

1927
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,039
right now pretty much yeah i'm the only

1928
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:36,720
one

1929
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:39,280
telling it like it is about all this

1930
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:41,599
other stuff but

1931
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:42,480
isn't it about like making sure that

1932
01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:44,799
you're protected

1933
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:46,000

you can make the choice to heal when

1936
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:52,559
given the knowledge

1937
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:54,559
isn't it about making sure that your

1938
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:56,000
life is precious and everything in your

1939
01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:59,280

1946

and be cautious

1947
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:16,400
be cautious look out

1948
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:20,799
renata says what's hard to convince

1949
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:22,559
people to listen to this info

1950
01:07:20,799 --> 01:07:24,000
what's hard is to convince people to

1951
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:25,760
listen to this info

1952
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,240
it's heartbreaking how stubborn some

1953
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:30,480
people can be i was told today

1954
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:32,319
just chill out nutritional yeast

1955
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:34,720
tomatoes

1956
01:07:32,319 --> 01:07:35,680
so just chill about nutritional yeast

1957
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:39,200
tomatoes

1958
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:40,880
have msg too nutritional yeast

1959
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:42,880
it can make or break somebody's healing

1960
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:43,440
process i just want you guys to know

1961
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:46,640
that

1962
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:49,200
it can um it's highly toxic

1963
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:51,359
and what nutritional yeast does it

1964
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:53,359
interferes with the brain chemistry

1965
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:55,039
it interferes with electricity in the

1966
01:07:53,359 --> 01:07:56,640
brain neurotransmitters in the brain

1967
01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:57,520
it's one thing what nutritional yeast

1968
01:07:56,640 --> 01:08:00,559
does

1969
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:03,119
another thing nutritional yeast does is

1970
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:04,480
it weakens the immune system it doesn't

1971
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:07,599
build the immune system

1972
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:08,640
so if you got fibrocfs eczema psoriasis

1973
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:11,359
depression anxiety

1974
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:12,799
whatever you got going on utis bladder

whatever you got acne yeah acne

1977
01:08:15,839 --> 01:08:18,880
your immune system lowers down and you

1978
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:20,719
get acne every time your immune system

1979
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:22,480
lowers you get acne

1980
01:08:20,719 --> 01:08:24,319
tomatoes don't have msg by the way but

1981
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:26,000
anyway all

1982
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:28,000
what happens is that nutritional yeast

1983
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:30,400
can make or break your finish line

1984
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,279
your healing to the end your finish line

1985
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:32,640
maybe

1986
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:34,159
you don't have any issues you're eating

1987
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:35,440
it all day long because you got nothing

1988
01:08:34,159 --> 01:08:37,920
yet

1989
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:39,199
everybody is going to get sick who isn't

1990
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:41,359
sick now

1991
01:08:39,199 --> 01:08:42,719
that's where we're heading everybody

1992
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:44,960
gets something

1993
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:46,080
everybody gets something and some get

1994
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:49,199
many get much

1995
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:51,120
more than just something um

1996
01:08:49,199 --> 01:08:52,480
people who aren't sick will spout out

1997
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:54,080
where's your study

1998
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:55,679
they don't want to know like your track

1999
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:56,960
record of how many people healed in the

2000
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:59,839
world doing your info

2001
01:08:56,960 --> 01:09:01,679
or they don't want to know what celery

2002
01:08:59,839 --> 01:09:02,719
juice does for people and why it's the

2003
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:05,359
biggest

2004
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:06,080
the biggest out there as far as how many

2005
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:09,279
people are doing

2006
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:10,719
it there's no trend or anything else

2007
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:12,799
that overrides it but you know why you

2008
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:14,319
don't hear about it every minute celery

2009
01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:15,759
juice even though everybody's doing it

2010
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:16,960
500 million people in the world are

2011
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:18,400
doing it right now the reason why i

2012
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:20,799
don't hear about it

2013
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:22,400
because it makes no one money it makes

2014
01:09:20,799 --> 01:09:24,640
nobody money

2015
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:26,400
and all the other crap makes people

2016
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:28,719
money collagen

2017
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:30,480
coffee caffeine whatever it is makes

2018
01:09:28,719 --> 01:09:32,560
people tons of money right

2019
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:34,239
so because it makes them all money you

2020
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:37,600
hear about it every minute

2021
01:09:34,239 --> 01:09:40,239
every single minute um

2022
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:42,400
so yeah so people who aren't sick

2023
01:09:40,239 --> 01:09:44,159
they'll they'll be spouting out like

2024
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:45,759
they haven't figured out that science

2025
01:09:44,159 --> 01:09:48,400

you can't eat brain to fix your brain

you can't eat a cow's brain to fix your

2093
01:11:56,159 --> 01:12:00,480

2095
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:02,800
really disturbing about the collagen

2096
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:05,600
thing

2097
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:07,920
it's such a psych out for people it

2098
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:09,040
really insults people in a way that's

2099
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:12,719
unbelievable

2100
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:14,960
how dare you think you can eat something

2101
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:16,000
to actually fix something but eat that

2102
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:18,239
very thing

2103
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,280
it doesn't happen it doesn't exist it'll

2104
01:12:18,239 --> 01:12:23,199
never happen

2105
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:26,000
you can't eat brain to heal your brain

2106
01:12:23,199 --> 01:12:26,960
bottom line and that's something to

2107
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,880
remember

2108
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:30,880
you have to eat other foods to build

2109
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:33,520
your collagen you have to create

2110
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:35,679
collagen through using foods that create

2111
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:37,360
that actually help you build collagen

2112
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:38,159
the process in your body to create

2113
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:40,719
collagen

2114
01:12:38,159 --> 01:12:42,719
comes from leafy greens it comes from

2115
01:12:40,719 --> 01:12:44,640
fruits it comes from these foods here

2116
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:46,640
these healing foods asparagus it comes

2117
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:48,480
from these healing foods

2118
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:50,640
that's where it comes from it's so

2119
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:52,960
insulting to trick people out

2120
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:55,199
maybe the system thinks people are so

2121
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:58,239
dumb or something out there maybe

2122
01:12:55,199 --> 01:13:00,080
the evil system that just you know banks

2123
01:12:58,239 --> 01:13:01,760
trillions of dollars on stupid ideas

2124
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:05,840
