2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:15,760
find out what's making you sick and how

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:18,880
to heal Anthony William is the medical

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,439
medium hello I'm Anthony William you're

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,039
listening to the medical medium radio

6
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:24,599
show where each week I talk about the

7
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:26,359
most advanced healing information and

8
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:29,320
secrets about health much of which is

9
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:31,359
not found anywhere else and is decades

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,559
ahead of what's out there now as I've

11
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:37,239
always said who has 10 20 30 years to

12
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:40,120
wait for answers on PCOS polycystic

13
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:42,879
ovarian syndrome or anything just

14
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:45,800
waiting for answers on anything PCOS is

15
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:48,440
the topic today it's a great one because

16
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:51,079
it really showcases how research and

17
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:53,960
science doesn't really know anything and

18
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:55,879
I say that because they really don't

19
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,359
when it comes down to PCOS they might

20
00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:02,079
know something about how you know a

21
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:04,760
rocket ship can get into outer space

22
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,799
okay so a space shuttle and a space

23
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,880
station you know we got that kind of

24
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,759
technology and and quite honestly that

25
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,840
technology is probably way behind

26
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:16,360
compared to it where it would be

27
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,600
actually at this point I mean to the

28
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,640
bottom line or where it's supposed to be

29
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,920
going when it comes down to chronic

30
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,280
illness though research and science fall

31
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,880
short I mean really flat really flat I

32
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,280
mean don't get me wrong research and

33
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,240
science is in in fact amazing in so many

34
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,360
different areas especially especially in

35
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,799
medical

36
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,159
technology as far as medical technolog

37
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,200
is getting better and better and better

38
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,920
and it's still still far far behind in

39
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,720
so many ways but but yet it's Advanced

40
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,159
too and I respect that I mean you break

41
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,840
your leg you break your leg they're

42
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,960
putting bones together better than they

43
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,479
ever did I mean you know you get into a

44
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:54,000
car accident something happens you get

45
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:56,000
hurt and there's really some some good

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,799
medical technology today it's way better

47
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,560
they just don't take two boards and slap

48
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:04,520
it on your leg and tyro rope around it

49
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,159
and hope you live or who knows dies so

50
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:09,200
you know it's not

51
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:11,000
1850 but you know so we're in a better

52
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,200
place there without a doubt and and you

53
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,239
got to have a lot of respect for that

54
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,519
and there's some incredible surgeons too

55
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:21,200
incredible surgeons seriously that save

56
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:23,519
lives save lives all the time um there's

57
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,120
some great internists some great MDS out

58
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:27,640
there great medical doctors great

59
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,480
functional medical doctors too there's

60
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,360
there's a lot of great great great great

61
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,920

everything and and don't don't forget

63
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,560
about the nurses actually because um

64
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,200
there's just so many we're blessed to

65
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,360
have the nurses that we have in the

66
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,879
industries and all this is incredible I

67
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,959
I don't want anybody to think I lose

68
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,519
sight of any of that so if you're new to

69
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,720
the show but look we have to be honest

70
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,519
and we can't be in denial we have to be

71
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,720
honest we have to be truthful we have to

72
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,440
be we have to be straight up truthful I

73
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,879
mean this is no joke people suffering is

74
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:04,239
no joke and and where we are with PCOS

75
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:06,400
is really really sad frightening sad

76
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,560
chronic and Ill chronic illness in in

77
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,680
science and research with chronic

78
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:14,040
illness is disastrous including any

79
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:16,040
chronic illness any chronic illness

80
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,239
science and research is disastrous just

81
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:21,159
anything pick anything pick Alzheimer's

82
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,000
pick dementia pick anything you can just

83
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:24,560
randomly go ahead and pick something

84
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,840
it's

85
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,239
disastrous just just so you know just so

86
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,200
you know you can pick lupus pick

87
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,000
anything all right it's just all of it

88
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,480
not only not only do research and

89
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,319
science even doesn't even know what

90
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,599
causes anything out there really doesn't

91
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:41,319
cause anything and then they and they

92
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,720
throw it into genes and you know which

93
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:44,879
is what we're going to talk about

94
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,640
PCOS and they throw it into the body

95
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,200
attacking itself theories and just just

96
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:51,120
to distract us because they don't know

97
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,760
what's going on because it's

98
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,439
embarrassing it's embarrassing at this

99
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,760
point because you have to understand

100
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:00,439
there's a tremendous amount of

101
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:03,680
prestige and money

102
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:06,200
and money and Prestige I'll say it over

103
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,879
and over again and that money and that

104
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:12,799
Prestige and that schooling and that

105
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:15,360
that arrogance doesn't want to actually

106
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,840
be mocked mocked because it doesn't have

107
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,600
a true answer for PCOS it doesn't want

108
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,199
to be mocked the industries don't want

109
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,680
to be mocked and the people in the

110
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,600
industries don't want to be mocked they

111
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,000
don't want to be mocked when they don't

112
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,880
have an answer for Lupus they don't have

113
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,440
any real answers for anything you know

114
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:34,039
I'm just picking random random illnesses

115
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,199
but the point is they don't want to be

116
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:37,840
mocked that's serious I'm talking I'm

117
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:39,560
I'm I'm serious about this you have to

118
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,520
understand this it's all about oh how

119
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,400
many studies and oh I've been involved

120
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,919
in peer reviews and no I've graduated to

121
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,400
the best top my class and the best

122
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:50,160
medical universities I've gotten

123
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:53,400
everything else and oh no no uh PCOS oh

124
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,039
it's it's it's it's jeans it's jeans no

125
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:58,560
but luis's body attacking itself it's

126
00:04:55,039 --> 00:05:00,600
autoimmune uh uh ra us autoimmune genes

127
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,840
and it's genetic too

128
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:06,479
because if you don't have an answer you

129
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:09,720
don't want all that you did all that you

130
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:12,000
worked for all that you have all that

131
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,600
entitlement all that whole thing with

132
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,560
bureaucracy in the medical world you

133
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,560
don't want all that mocked and laughed

134
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,720
at so it's better to just throw it on

135
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:22,440
you it's your fault you got faulty genes

136
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,880
and that's just the way it's going to be

137
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,880
guess what that's not the way it's going

138
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,919
to be because it's not the way it is and

139
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:30,039
that's not the truth and it's not about

140
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:33,120
genes it's about not knowing what's

141
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:34,840
wrong with someone is what the truth is

142
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,039
of what's happening in chronic illness

143
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,400
and everything else so you have to

144
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:40,680
understand something got tremendous

145
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:42,960
respect for science and research which

146
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,440
by the way is is all theories because

147
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,800
that's how it works they they they have

148
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,240
a theory they have a theory they base

149
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,639
the theory it's not about math it's not

150
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,479
like ACC counting where the numbers come

151
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,919
out right and that's it it's concrete

152
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,240
you got the numbers and the numbers

153
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:57,240
that's not science that's not

154
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,080
science so science science is just a

155
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,560
theory you work off the theory and you

156
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,919
hope and outcome goes your way so then

157
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:06,199
you can publish that outcome and make

158
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:08,120
the investors happy really important to

159
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:10,880
understand this because we we walk

160
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,440
around we walk around blind to how it

161
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,560
really works and what's happening and

162
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:17,680
then we shoot our mouths off like oh oh

163
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,680
you know hey uh those medical medium

164
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,199
books they got no science in them oh no

165
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,880
no no s it's all science if you read the

166
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:25,880
medical medium books it's all science

167
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,360
it's undiscovered science and it's truth

168
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:30,000
about what's causing illness and that's

169
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,840
what it is and it gets people really

170
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,039
heated up out there too I noticed it

171
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,599
gets some people heated up when you're

172
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:38,639
healing tens of thousands of people

173
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:40,319
through the words from Spirit hundreds

174
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,720
of thousands of people and millions

175
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:45,080
globally through these books that Spirit

176
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,479
puts out there and people are getting

177
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:50,280
better and their lives are turning

178
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:53,440
around it really pisses people off out

179
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:55,240
there it pisses them off like you don't

180
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,919
even know because the truth is no one's

181
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,400
really supposed to get better that's why

182
00:06:56,919 --> 00:06:59,639
the world is getting sicker and sicker

183
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,080
and sicker because it keeps keeps the

184
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:03,840
industry going and it keeps the dollars

185
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,199
going it keeps the wheel going around

186
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,160
and you have to know that that's the

187
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,479
where they where they really want it

188
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,280
actually and science and research

189
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:12,360
doesn't really want to go in the right

190
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,680
direction with chronic illness with

191
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,639
chronic illness the doctors do they want

192
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,319
to but they don't have control over it a

193
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,039
lot of the doctors and lab technicians

194
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,080
don't have control over it I know I talk

195
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:23,639
to them I talk to them I talk to lab

196
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,120
technicians I talk to doctors I talked

197
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:27,560
to a lot of people I talked to a lot of

198
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,639
high-profile people all across the globe

199
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:32,800
I've worked with a lot of extremely

200
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:35,599
extremely high-profile people globally

201
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,599
and I know how the industries work and

202
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:40,199
so when it comes down to PCOS this is a

203
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:42,680
prime example this is a real prime

204
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:45,360
example of ignorance arrogance

205
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:48,120
entitlement all put together and then

206
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:51,680
women suffering with no answers and the

207
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:54,319
answers they have are are absurd and

208
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,520
insulting and not only insulting

209
00:07:54,319 --> 00:08:01,759
ridiculous and utterly wrong and that's

210
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:04,240
how it works so you know hey man I just

211
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,280
I can't say enough about all this it's

212
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,639
really frightening it's

213
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:13,039
disappointing and it's disheartening and

214
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:14,440
sad and so we're talking about PCOS

215
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,680
today so if you just tuned in or

216
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:18,479

00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,960
just tuned in listen to the show on a

218
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,240
replay and just listen to the beginning

219
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,120
of the show it's important everybody

220
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:26,039
needs to know how it works they need to

221
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,560
know how it works and as far as about

222
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:29,520
this show and how it works this the only

223
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,840
show there is in the medical field

224
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,560
alternative and conventional that

225
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:35,479
doesn't have repackaged or recycled

226
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:38,599
Theory made to sound like a new

227
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:41,440
understanding of PCOS or any illness or

228
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:42,959
disease in this show the information

229
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,560
here doesn't come from medical interest

230
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:46,519
groups the information here isn't

231
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,399
contaminated with medical funding with

232
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:50,920
strings attached botched research

233
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,920
investors investing in a guy to have an

234
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,640
outcome to make the investors happy so

235
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,600
they better come up so the thumb gets

236
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,240
pushed on the scale so that we all get

237
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,320
cheated and chronic illness goes nowhere

238
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,560
that's why we're getting sicker and

239
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,160
sicker lobbyist medical lobbyist that's

240
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,959
right it's all just just you wouldn't

241
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:08,360
believe what goes on internal Kickbacks

242
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:10,839
persuaded belief systems belief systems

243
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:13,720
like for instance that hey Croc you know

244
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:16,640
chalk it up to all to genetics that

245
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:19,240
belief system will stop the hands of

246
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,640
time from getting anybody better I don't

247
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,839
know if that made sense stop the hands

248
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:26,200
of time you know what I mean

249
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:30,800
literally that belief system that it's

250
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:34,040
all genes halts it's going to halt any

251
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:36,720
any any movement in chronic illness and

252
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:40,200
autoimmune disease it's going to Halt it

253
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:42,320
for a century a century you need to know

254
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,440
this because when you have a belief

255
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,680
system like its genes you will never

256
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,480
look for the truth you'll just it just

257
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,000
money will funnel into jeans and they'll

258
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,560
just be worried about cloning because

259
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,640
they they have sinister sinister

260
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,920
sinister things they're doing with genes

261
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:00,320
and that's where money is piling in and

262
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,760
piling in piling in and they just say

263
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,800
leave the chronic illness people just

264
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,320
let them die let them die just tell them

265
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,920
its genes and just give them the

266
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,440
steroids and just give them whatever and

267
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,120
just let them suffer and then it can

268
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,440
suffer and if they die they die if they

269
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:15,040
live they live who cares that's how it

270
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:17,279
works just so you know up at the top at

271
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,800
the top at the top bar that's how it

272
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:21,600
works and I feel bad for doctors to have

273
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,720
to be even you know and you know just

274
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,120
just go into the system and they're just

275
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,040
like I didn't and they go in and they

276
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,519
didn't realize their hands are tied and

277
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,720
they're kept busy with all kinds of

278
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:31,600
jargon

279
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,000
private panels of influencers you

280
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,000
wouldn't believe how that works health

281
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,639
field payoffs or trendy traps none of

282
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,399
that is in the information in the show

283
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:41,000
it's the only show there is in existence

284
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,399
on the planet and globally that actually

285
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,240
has information it comes from an

286
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:46,279
untampered Source a clean Source Advance

287
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,200
source and I know what you're thinking

288
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:48,800
you're thinking wait a minute there's

289
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,160
other Alternative Health show shows out

290
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,240
there what do you mean that

291
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,480
information's not good that information

292
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,000
like I said has all that stuff attached

293
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,880
to it it has the private panel of

294
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,720
influencers in the way back it has the

295
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,399
trendy traps it has all of that both

296
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,680
alternative and conventional medicine

297
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:05,760
it's the only show that doesn't so this

298
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:09,040
information is pure gift I was given at

299
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,399
age 4 whether anybody likes it or not I

300
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,040
noticed that people are getting a little

301
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:15,800
jealous about that it's strange back

302
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:18,200
when I was younger they weren't jealous

303
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:21,320
about it they used to line up at the

304
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:24,000
door at my family's house on Sunday to

305
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:26,959
get readings when I was 8 n 10 11 12

306
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,240
years old and no one was jealous about

307
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,720
it but I noticed in this internet age

308
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:33,200
and the way things work right now and I

309
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,040
know how it all goes people are jealous

310
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,800

311
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,680

people don't like what they're painting

316
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,920
and think that they're not gifted but

317
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:52,839
they are there's no question credible

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,880
credible painter and and and this person

319
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:56,839

that when they were painting years and

321
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:01,360
years ago there wasn't any jealousy

322
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:04,079
towards this person's gift and now

323
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,079

00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:40,560
those a little bit high blood pressure

366
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:43,120
that's a symptom of PCOS that they look

367
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:47,399
for high A1C so you know insulin

368
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:50,279
resistance type two diabeties depression

369
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:51,360
anxiety acne that's something they look

370
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:55,680
for

371
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:58,839
too okay hair growth in strange places

372
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:02,639
or you know more hair growth than usual

373
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:05,759
weight gain regular periods hair

374
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,279
loss all these symptoms are these

375
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:10,399
symptoms of

376
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:12,800
PCOS are these symptoms of PCOS I mean

377
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:16,759
this is how ridiculous this is this is

378
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:18,240
really going to be an eye openening show

379
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:20,519
so these are the things they look for so

380
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,240
they look for insulin levels they test

381
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:24,079
you for Diabetes Type 2 diabetes

382
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,240
pre-diabetes that's what they're

383
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,920
concerned about that because they're

384
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,800
thinking people with you know women with

385
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:34,120
PCOS more prone to

386
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:38,480
diabetes diabetic issues and are they

387
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:40,560
are they or is PCOS just something that

388
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,800
they have too and if they didn't have it

389
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,959
would have bet all the women that are

390
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,519
pre-diabetic that don't have PCOS what

391
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:49,040
about all the women that are

392
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,880
pre-diabetic

393
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,440
that um what about all the women that

394
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:57,720
are actually diabetic that don't type 2

395
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:59,120
diabetes and have hair loss and even a

396
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,240
regular periods that don't don't have

397
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,959
PCOS what about all the women that have

398
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,399
we weight gain what about all the women

399
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:07,959
that have acne there's so much confusion

400
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:10,199
tied up and wrapped up in here it's

401
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:13,199
insane okay and that's what I mean it's

402
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:16,279
like if they really cared about women

403
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:18,519
the industries really cared about women

404
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:20,720
they would organize this they would get

405
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:24,600
people on this they would dump money in

406
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:27,959
this stuff they would dump money into

407
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:31,040
helping women and figuring out symptoms

408
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:32,800
and conditions with women but they don't

409
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,319
because the industries don't care

410
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,839
doctors do doctors care they care about

411
00:15:35,319 --> 00:15:39,360
their own their own women they care

412
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,600
about their wives they care about their

413
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,079
daughters they care about their patients

414
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,199
they do of course they do I'm talking

415
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,680
about above the doctors the doctors

416
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:52,279
always have their hands tied most of

417
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:54,399
them anyway um so the deal is is that

418
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:57,319
there's a theory theory is more more

419
00:15:54,399 --> 00:16:00,279
Androgen hormone levels rising or

420
00:15:57,319 --> 00:16:02,480
increasing that's a a theory so the

421
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:05,720
theory is that the O the ovaries are

422
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:08,160
being stimulated to produce a more of a

423
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:10,639
male hormone so that's a theory that

424
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,440
they have that they look for and then

425
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,759
there's a symptom of O ovaries

426
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,680
collecting pockets of fluid so fluid

427
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:19,600
filled

428
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:22,759
cysts fluid filled cysts so follicles

429
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,399
are are forcing fluid to build and grow

430
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:25,880
and then they got these fluid filed

431
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:29,920
cysts is that's something they look for

432
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:32,920
too that's an identification of PCOS so

433
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,519
if a woman has the fluid the fluid

434
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:37,839
building around the

435
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:40,040
ovaries and then she has type 22

436
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:42,079
diabetes and she has something else

437
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:44,399
going on or she has you know insulin

438
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,720
resistance they package it all together

439
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,600
that these are the symptoms here but

440
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,480
what about the woman who doesn't have

441
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,920
the fluid around the cyst but has

442
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,120
everything else it's just there's a lot

443
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:56,759
of confusion great

444
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,959
confusion so so science and research

445
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:01,759
have locked on to one thing they've

446
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:04,280
locked onto one thing that's interesting

447
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:06,559
that we're going to cover so it it's

448
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,959
like they touched upon one thing but

449
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:11,439
it's that it's like you're almost it's

450
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:14,160
like you're almost there you're almost

451
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:16,280
there and oh no no you're not you're not

452
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,240
you're not like you're almost there it's

453
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:21,839
like you know you're going to you're

454
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,400
about to get there and then no it just

455
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:26,439
not going to

456
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:28,880
happen it's like it's the let down thing

457
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:30,559
it's like you know you know talking

458
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,000
about it's non-stop like that the

459
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:34,080
medical world so science of research

460
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,039
locked down to one Discovery and there's

461
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,679
low grade

462
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:41,160
inflammation they don't know why they

463
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:43,640
don't know where of course not cuz who

464
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,720
cares who cares

465
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:48,880
seriously because research and science

466
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:51,320
doesn't care if they did all they have

467
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,840
to do is just dig a little deeper and

468
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:56,520
look a little harder and then you

469
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:59,240
wouldn't even need me anymore you

470
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:01,679
wouldn't even need me anymore and maybe

471
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:03,520
you know what maybe maybe hey that would

472
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,039
be a great thing they had all the

473
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,760
answers for every single illness and

474
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,840
they had all the answers for chronic

475
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:10,440
illness if I didn't have to constantly

476
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:13,640
beat out science and research my whole

477
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:15,919
life 24/7 since I was age four that

478
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:18,600
probably would be great for me maybe I

479
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:20,039
could just you know do something with my

480
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:23,000
life for

481
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:26,799
once and so anyway the bottom line is

482
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,799
they locked on to lowgrade

483
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:31,320
inflammation low grade influ so that's

484
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:35,520
that's important that's important to

485
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:37,000
understand in the reproductive system so

486
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,360
mystery has

487
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,880
it Eureka low grade inflammation we

488
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,520
don't know what it is spirit and I know

489
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,080
what it is but we don't know what it is

490
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:50,520
science and research that's how they

491
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:53,919
look at it but it's there and the theory

492
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:56,440
is the theory is too that you can get

493
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:59,559
this other other thing happening liver

494
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:01,280
inflammation randomly occur occurring

495
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:04,679
another

496
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:06,559
Discovery another another discovery that

497
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:09,440
they're kind of putting together the

498
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:10,799
dots so they got all these symptoms all

499
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,919
these

500
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:15,720
conditions okay all these symptoms and

501
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:18,679
all these conditions and then they

502
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:21,799
have with that a couple of other things

503
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:26,640
thrown in there but if if they knew what

504
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:28,840
the cause was for all these symptoms and

505
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,720
conditions they would have have this

506
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:33,280
down they would know what's going on

507
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,480
they would know what to do they would

508
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,919
know what it is but the problem is they

509
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:40,280
don't even know what causes type 2

510
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:41,760
diabetes they don't even know what

511
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:44,440
causes type two

512
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:48,000
diabetes okay that's number one that's

513
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:50,880
number one they don't know what causes

514
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,280
high blood pressure science and research

515
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,720
doesn't know what causes high blood

516
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:57,159
pressure meaning someone without a heart

517
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,600
problem they don't know what causes it

518
00:19:57,159 --> 00:20:02,320
they don't know what causes depression

519
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,039
they don't know what causes anxiety so

520
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,720
think about this all the symptoms and

521
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:09,400
conditions listed as as being part of

522
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:12,159
PCOS they don't have the cause in

523
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:16,360
science and research for someone with or

524
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:19,720
without PCOS someone with or

525
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:21,960
without um fluid around the ovaries

526
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:25,000
someone with or without Androgen levels

527
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:28,760
being uh increasing from the

528
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:31,440
ovary okay so what I'm saying regardless

529
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:33,600
or not they don't have answers for high

530
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:37,600
blood pressure they don't have answers

531
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:39,320
for high A1C they don't have um science

532
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,880
research doesn't understand depression

533
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:45,919
have a single answer for depression not

534
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:49,039
one that makes sense and is real and

535
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:51,400
legit or anxiety science research has no

536
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:54,000
idea what causes anxiety and probably

537
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:56,120
will never no matter what even I could

538
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
do a million shows on anxiety I can put

539
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:01,280
out books on anxiety I probably just

540
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,960
ignore it why thousands and thousands

541
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,000
and tens of thousands recover from their

542
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:08,480
anxiety and get the right

543
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,080
information okay and the reason why

544
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,919
there's no there's no money in it when

545
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,360
the answer is given to you there's no

546
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:16,039
money in it there's no there's no all

547
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:18,919
that stuff that happens I talk about the

548
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:21,240
beginning of the show acne they don't

549
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:23,559
know what causes acne science and

550
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:25,640
research doesn't know what causes acne

551
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:27,640
just for the record they don't we've

552
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:30,480
explored it on the show if you're if

553
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:32,679
you're if you're listener to the show or

554
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,679
if you you know if youve you know you

555
00:21:32,679 --> 00:21:39,760
know the stuff that I put out there then

556
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:43,000
you know okay they know the cause of

557
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:45,640
hair growth so so hair growth in random

558
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:49,320
places or excessive hair growth and

559
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:52,159
women hurt to its them or you know just

560
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:54,720
just hair popping up in places they got

561
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:57,120
an idea and that's the Androgen hormone

562
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,400
so they got that one weight gain they

563
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,279
still don't know I mean they'll just

564
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:03,720
think it's you know a bad diet and no

565
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:06,080
exercise or they'll think someone's just

566
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,640
eating too much they'll think someone's

567
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,520
eating too much something blamed on

568
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:12,159
women

569
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:13,799
forever ever women aren't allowed to eat

570
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,600
they're not allowed to eat they're still

571
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:18,880
not allowed to eat because if a if a

572
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:21,400
woman's eating too much whether it's a

573
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,840
fancy dinner somewhere at a gathering or

574
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:28,360
whether it's home if if a woman's eating

575
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:31,240
too much all eyes are on that in this in

576
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:34,440
this day and age still in this day and

577
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:38,559
age it's it's unbelievable it's

578
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:40,159
unbelievable um so hair loss they still

579
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:42,720
don't know what causes hair loss science

580
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,240
of research has no idea no idea and I

581
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,200
don't care who the doctor is they have

582
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,120
no idea unless they have the right

583
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,400
information that that we've been putting

584
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:52,120
out spirit and

585
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:54,360
I okay they don't know what causes the

586
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:57,600
level of insulin Rising they think it's

587
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:59,080
sugar they think it's sugar that causes

588
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:02,559
insulin to

589
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:04,440
rise that's not true it's not sugar

590
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:07,279
sugar is not the cause I talked about

591
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:11,039
that in medical medium book one science

592
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:12,200
of research um oh face it science of

593
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,360
research doesn't even know what causes

594
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,360
regular heart

595
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:19,520
disease so this is just and there's

596
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:22,039
other symptoms too that can be chocked

597
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:25,320
up to PC there's other symptoms too that

598
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:27,360
can that can be blamed on

599
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:29,640
PCOS but science of research doesn't

600
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:32,320
know what any of symptoms are so I love

601
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:34,760
when they package them up and they throw

602
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:39,480
it into a PCOS

603
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:43,000
bag and meanwhile women all have those

604
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:45,559
symptoms without any signs of any kind

605
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:49,159
of ovary

606
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:52,799
problems without any of that depression

607
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:55,480
anxiety elevated blood sugar high1 see

608
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:57,880
you know the whole bit hair loss weight

609
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:01,400
gain all of that a regular period

610
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:04,320
periods too including acne all of that

611
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:07,559
even hair growth without an increase of

612
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,960
Androgen levels without the increase of

613
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:12,520
Androgen

614
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:14,120
levels hair growth yeah then what's

615
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,679
causing that what's causing hair hair

616
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,600
growth someone that's not when you're

617
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:20,799
not detecting Androgen

618
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:25,559
levels it's a mess it's a hot mess in

619
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:28,159
the industries it's so bad it's so bad

620
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:29,880
it's frightening look I have have to

621
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,399
tell you because if I don't tell you

622
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,000
you're just going to walk around and

623
00:24:31,399 --> 00:24:34,640
you're just going to be not know and

624
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,840
they can get sucked into stuff and

625
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:40,360
that's what happens you can get sucked

626
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:42,559
into stuff you can get sucked into

627
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:44,159
stuff and it's frightening I've seen

628
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:46,640
even the best practitioners the best

629
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:48,440
doctors in the alternative movement

630
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,640
offering things to people people have

631
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:53,399
had to come to me they're being offered

632
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,080
things that are entirely opposite of

633
00:24:53,399 --> 00:24:57,120
what they need and what their condition

634
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:59,360
really is I still see it every single

635
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:02,039
day it's

636
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:04,960
unbelievable so in so when it comes down

637
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:08,120
to PCOS what are they closest to

638
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:11,159
understanding to anything about PCOS the

639
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:14,399
lowgrade inflammation that occurs in the

640
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:15,919
reproductive system now they think

641
00:25:14,399 --> 00:25:18,679
science of research will be just thought

642
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:20,960
it's a body attacking

643
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:22,320
itself that's genes and the body

644
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,840
attacking

645
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:28,600
itself but that's not how it

646
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:31,880
works at all and that's not right on any

647
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:34,880
level so they got the low grade

648
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:36,760
inflammation tag going on and so they're

649
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,760
you're they're on to something they're

650
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:42,640
actually on to something but it's never

651
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:46,880
going to go anywhere ever ever ever so

652
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:48,880
you know 50 years go by the Next

653
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,600
Generation generation Generation

654
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,720
generation three four generations

655
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:56,760
whatever 60 years goes by three four

656
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:59,279
generations of women entering puberty or

657
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:01,320
just in their their young adulthood

658
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:04,440
developing or getting diagnosed with

659
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:07,399
PCOS with no answers to come is what's

660
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:09,000
going to occur and this is a prime

661
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:11,760
example

662
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,600
so so what do we do what what's going on

663
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:17,120
with PCS what's happening PCOS has

664
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:19,960
everything to do with the liver with the

665
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:22,880
liver so a woman's liver and what's

666
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:24,480
inside the liver and this is this is

667
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,360
another thing too they see the

668
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:30,600
inflammation in livers too with women

669
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:32,559
with PCOS do see that as well so that

670
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,159
occurs so it has everything to do with

671
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:35,480
the liver it's a big part of it it's

672
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,880
actually a big part of it but it has

673
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:40,159
everything to do with the reproductive

674
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:43,720
system too to some degree as far as the

675
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:46,640
fluid filled the fluid around the O

676
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:48,360
ovaries the fluid in the fluid around

677
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,960
the ovaries is a virus called the

678
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:54,080
Epstein bar the Epstein bar is the

679
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:57,200
common virus for PCOS it is the cause of

680
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,840
PCOS it's what I put in the thyroid book

681
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,919
I had a a thyroid book in front of me

682
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:05,320
right now I I could read the PCOS

683
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:07,039
section um so but you should when you

684
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:10,919
get a chance you

685
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:13,720
should and Epstein bar is a virus that

686
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:16,000
enters into the liver very early on it

687
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:19,480
could it could be passed down from the

688
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,360
family um literally right from birth you

689
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,440
you could get it anywhere you can get it

690
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:25,840
in

691
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:29,360
preschool you can get it in daycare you

692
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:32,880
can get it anywhere a child a baby can

693
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:34,399
get it it's pretty easy to pick up the

694
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,880
Epstein bar

695
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:42,360
virus almost everybody has

696
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:45,880
it as far as in the US also globally

697
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:48,480
it's not it's it's everywhere so but it

698
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:51,679
has the potential of of of going after

699
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:53,360
the ovaries attacking the ovaries that's

700
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:56,320
the that's what it does it has the

701
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:58,399
potential of doing that and when it does

702
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:02,159
that the fluid will will build up around

703
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:05,640
the ovaries this is from a viral

704
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:09,640
infection that viral infection prompts

705
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:12,399
your immune system to be elevated on the

706
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:13,679
lookout for this virus the immune system

707
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,399
doesn't

708
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:18,240
attack the

709
00:28:15,399 --> 00:28:19,880
ovaries so your white blood cells can't

710
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,640
attack your

711
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:26,799
ovaries but they're Mindful and they're

712
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:29,000
out and about looking for viral material

713
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:30,880
now there are

714
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,960
antibodies

715
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:36,840
undiscovered for this ovarian

716
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:40,360
syndrome okay so so just hear this out

717
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:41,760
for a second here okay with with

718
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:44,039
Hashimoto's

719
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:47,880
thyroiditis which by the

720
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:50,360
way women with PCOS all get thyroid

721
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:52,120
problems they all get thyroid problems

722
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:55,559
because they have the Epstein bar and

723
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:58,039
the Epstein bars be is is is causes low

724
00:28:55,559 --> 00:29:00,159
thyroid and hyperthyroid it causes low

725
00:28:58,039 --> 00:29:02,640
thyroid hyperthyroid talk about all that

726
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:05,039
and thyroid healing the epine bar goes

727
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,399
into the thyroid and causes all this so

728
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:10,240
women with PCOS whether at the very

729
00:29:07,399 --> 00:29:13,559
beginning around puberty or even earlier

730
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:17,080
or anytime anytime the epine bars in

731
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:20,799
their system could eventually go after

732
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:23,720
the thyroid at some point so you you

733
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:27,080
have to know how that works so with PCOS

734
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:28,240
I mean the ovarian fluid that going on

735
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:32,320
there

736
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:36,720
that's from the virus now you you can't

737
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:40,120
put all those other symptoms in a PCOS

738
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:42,279
bag it's wrong to do that they all have

739
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:45,080
some they have similarities there's

740
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:46,760
reasons for them all but you can't just

741
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:48,600
throw them all together and say well

742
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:51,919
that's what a PCOS person goes through

743
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:53,200
that's why that's why the PC PCOS a

744
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:57,880
someone with

745
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:59,840
PCOS can be skinny and thin someone with

746
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:02,399
PCOS can be

747
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:04,360
overweight it depends how much Epstein

748
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:08,120
bar is inside the

749
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:10,640
liver and of course Foods matter but the

750
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:13,919
foods that you're feeding the epine bar

751
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:16,240
with inside the liver matter so when you

752
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:18,640
take away certain

753
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,279
foods there could be a big difference to

754
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:23,799
your weight loss because you're not

755
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:25,159
feeding the virus so we're going to go

756
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:28,120
into this a little deeper I mean it's

757
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:31,880
it's it's little complicated that's but

758
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:34,679
simple but simple simple simple simple

759
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:37,399
so what they recommend out there is low

760
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:39,240
calorie diets meaning low calorie from

761
00:30:37,399 --> 00:30:40,840
carbohydrates so they want you on no

762
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:43,360
carbohydrates so what they do is they

763
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:45,200
put women on the same old high-fat diet

764
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,200
they put them on high fat the trendy

765
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,760
high fat diets out there to try to lose

766
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,880
weight they get them exercising some

767
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:53,679
women lose weight some women gain more

768
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,399
weight some women really just they tire

769
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,039
out they get sick because they got no

770
00:30:55,399 --> 00:30:58,760
sugar at all to run their body they got

771
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:00,559
no sugar to run their cells they got no

772
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:02,080
sugar to run their organs their adrenals

773
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:04,000
collapse and then they run into that

774
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:07,440
where the high trendy fat diet just

775
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,120
literally destroys them and that happens

776
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,919
all the time with women especially with

777
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,639
low-grade Epstein bar because when

778
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:14,960
you're dealing with PCOS and you're

779
00:31:12,639 --> 00:31:17,000
dealing with the fluid around the the

780
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,919
fluid filled cysts or the fluid that

781
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,840
actually impacts the ovary when you're

782
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:23,519
dealing with that you have a viral

783
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:26,559
infection you have a low grade

784
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:29,720
inflammation that's causing caused by a

785
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:31,600
virus now antibodies there's an antibod

786
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:33,080
that they've discovered that has

787
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,840
something to do with Hashimoto they

788
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:36,960
haven't discovered all the antibodies

789
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:38,760
with Hashimoto they've only discovered

790
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,600
one they haven't discovered all the

791
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:42,799
antibodies there's all kinds of

792
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:45,360
antibodies running through the body that

793
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:47,600
the immune system creates that your

794
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:49,600
white blood cells create the white blood

795
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,639
cells happen to be adjacent and they

796
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:54,559
happen to be revved up and they happen

797
00:31:51,639 --> 00:31:56,440
to be around the reproductive system

798
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:58,080
because they're releasing an antibody

799
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:00,600
that hasn't been discovered by research

800
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:04,120
and science yet that antibody is

801
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:07,360
released not to harm the body but to go

802
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:09,120
after the Epstein bar virus to go after

803
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,559
the Epstein bar virus the science of

804
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:13,080
researcher discovering you know lab

805
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:14,360
technicians science of research

806
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:16,080
discovering there's some inflammation

807
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:17,480
going on some chronic lowgrade

808
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,440
inflammation but they're not connecting

809
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:21,840
the dots they have no way of knowing no

810
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,039
way of whatever because we're 100 years

811
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,240
from even knowing anything maybe 20

812
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:26,799
years from now they'll discover the

813
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:28,840
antibody and they'll be like okay wait a

814
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:30,480
minute there an antibody to PCOS but

815
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,799
chances are they might not because

816
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,039
they're passing everything off to

817
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:37,360
genetic to such a degree that they're

818
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:40,880
dropping chronic illness like never

819
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:42,960
before on their agenda so they're just

820
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:45,799
putting it in the back seat like they've

821
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:48,200
never done before in history we had this

822
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:52,120
time in the 80s when when genes didn't

823
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:54,360
take over as far as as the theory as the

824
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:56,039
as the Fall Guy and in the 80s they were

825
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:57,600
moving forward with some research and

826
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:59,720
science towards chronic illness the

827
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,000
minute they started getting close and

828
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:03,679
closer and closer started really in the

829
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,799
60s they started getting closer and

830
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:08,760
closer it was all shut down and pushed

831
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:10,399
back and genes then then are taking over

832
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:13,200
and The Chronic and then autoimmune the

833
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:15,080
body attacking itself took over because

834
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,840
the closer they got to real answers for

835
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:19,880
women with chronic illness and Men it

836
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,440
was too frightening for the industries

837
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:23,039
because it meant a tremendous amount of

838
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:27,320
money

839
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:30,600
lost tremendous amount of gains lost so

840
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:32,639
this is serious stuff so on the chronic

841
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:34,120
illness in the reproductive system it's

842
00:33:32,639 --> 00:33:35,600
the Epstein bar it's a variety of

843
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:38,760
Epstein bar that tends to go to the

844
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:40,399
reproductive system a lot of times in wh

845
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:42,600
with women Epstein bar heads the

846
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:44,760
reproductive system goes into the uterus

847
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:47,000
it goes in it it it attacks the ovaries

848
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:49,519
it heads into different places in the in

849
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,200
the reproductive system this is this

850
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:54,639
also creates mystery pregnancy problems

851
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,960
miscarriages it's not the thyroid that

852
00:33:54,639 --> 00:33:58,600
causes

853
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:01,039
miscarriages it's not the ovarian

854
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:03,960
syndrome PCOS that causes

855
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:07,360
miscarriages and pregnancy problems it's

856
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:09,960
the viral infection causing pregnancy

857
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,960
problems Mis miscarriages inability to

858
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:13,040
become

859
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,200
pregnant and the dysfunction that's

860
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:18,520
happening with the ovary it's the virus

861
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:20,040
causing that it's not a mystery it's a

862
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:22,639
mystery to research and science but it's

863
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:25,200
not a mystery over

864
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:27,040
here so it's a virus and just so you

865
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:29,320
know I've known this since I was a kid

866
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:31,119
kid because spirit's always known

867
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:32,879
Advanced information it's not like

868
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:36,879
Spirit learned this information

869
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:40,679
yesterday and now hey by the way Anthony

870
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:43,040
uh I I'm getting information now on PCOS

871
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:47,760
right here in 200 and whatever we're

872
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:51,000
in No 7 eight years old someone walked

873
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:53,520
in front of me with fluid filled cysts

874
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:57,400
in their ovaries spirit said this is

875
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:59,079
what it is nothing's changed at all

876
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:02,040
with the advanced information you're

877
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:04,640
hearing today than if I was talking to

878
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:07,280
somebody when I was 9 years

879
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:09,800
old that's how it's always been so just

880
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,280
so you know what's going on I've never

881
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,720
put that in the book either I should

882
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,960
actually talk about that in the book

883
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:17,200
because it's a whole thing behind that

884
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:19,280
you would be just blown away I think I

885
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,040
mean it blows me away when I stand back

886
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,680
and I look and I say spirit I don't know

887
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:27,800
how you do this

888
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:31,119
amazing because spirit's amazing now me

889
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:34,079
I'm just a big pain in the butt okay so

890
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:36,079
the bottom line is this here we go

891
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:37,400
understand this so you got an antibody

892
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:39,320
that's not discovered by science and

893
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:41,040
research the antibody is trying to go

894
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:43,040
after the virus so it's trying to do its

895
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:46,520
job that's what's happening there nobody

896
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:49,640
knows about it whatever fine you got a

897
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:53,760
virus that's attacking the ovary causing

898
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:57,720
fluid the fluid is a weapon is the

899
00:35:53,760 --> 00:36:01,160
ovar resistance it's the resist

900
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:04,960
resistance that's what the fluid is the

901
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:07,560
fluid is to try to stop the virus it's

902
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,680
released as if you had the flu in your

903
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:13,240
throat and mucus was forming to be

904
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:14,920
released to try to stop the flu virus

905
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:18,640
the ovaries

906
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:21,720
releasing mucus the ovaries releasing

907
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:24,040
mucus that fluid is in

908
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:27,359
water it's

909
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:31,400
mucus so the ovar is bleeding

910
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:34,079
mucus leeching mucus and and and and

911
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:36,640
around the ovary to stop the virus to

912
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:38,880
trap the virus to try to shut it down to

913
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,520
try to tangle it up and then they become

914
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,720
cystic sometimes with some women where

915
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:46,160
it's not just the these bubbly pockets

916
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:48,839
of mucus instead it's it's more than

917
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:51,079
that becomes in sometimes the you be you

918
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:54,640
get the cyst involved

919
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:57,640
too and Epstein bar creates ovarian

920
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:59,800
cysts that are not fluid filled to too

921
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:01,599
it also does that a lot of times with

922
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,880
women they have PCOS they got the fluid

923
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:05,800
filled stuff and then they get the

924
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:07,960
ovarian hard cysts later on down the

925
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,440
road too that's always optional with

926
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:13,359
Epstein

927
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:16,400
bar so the the the ovies are trying to

928
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:17,960
protect itself to protect themselves

929
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,680
that's a defense

930
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:22,119
mechanism at the same time you got an

931
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:23,960
antibody that has been discovered

932
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:27,079
floating around trying to get to the

933
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:29,359
virus to stop it and you got white blood

934
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:32,000
cells trying to look for the virus to to

935
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:34,760
tag it it's a lot going on what does

936
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,640
science and research say uh just some

937
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:39,560
chronic low grade inflammation you eat

938
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:43,040
too much you better lose weight better

939
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:44,520
go on a high fat no carb diet um you

940
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:48,200
know this is

941
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:50,200
genetic uh you're you know whatever on

942
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:52,079
and on it goes stupidity stupidity at

943
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:53,599
the best clinics at the best medical

944
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:55,359
clinics there are the best conventional

945
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:59,319
medical clinics there are you would

946
00:37:55,359 --> 00:38:02,880
think they have Godly Godly information

947
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:06,079
for women to heal with real real

948
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:09,880
information but no no it's just Earth

949
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:14,359
Earthly stupid human crap bureaucracy

950
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:16,640
crap paid for bought just just just you

951
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:20,599
know thrown on women just just that's

952
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:22,520
the way it is and it's sad so and and I

953
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:24,920
I get I get passionate I get emotional

954
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:28,240
about this for a reason because women

955
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:31,200
suffer with this like emotionally

956
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:34,599
mentally not just physically it's all of

957
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:37,960
it and you know and and and then the

958
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:39,400
people around them the their family and

959
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:41,520
you know their spouses and their

960
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:45,119
partners and just all of it it's it's

961
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:47,680
there's nothing easy about it so it's

962
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:49,520
insulting to where we are and how they

963
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:52,280
treat women with this and how it's done

964
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:54,760
sure doctors are nice it their hands are

965
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:57,720
tied it's the industry above them I talk

966
00:38:54,760 --> 00:39:00,200
about always know that

967
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:02,040
always know that I'm sure there's a some

968
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:04,200
doctors out there with some bedside man

969
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:07,119
bad bedside man or sure whatever but I'm

970
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:09,200
just saying overall it's the industry

971
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,599
the bottom line here is that we have to

972
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,280
do something better so let's cover some

973
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:14,960
of these other we got to cover some of

974
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:17,359
these other symptoms too that's what we

975
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:19,760
need to do acne first of all acne when

976
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:23,440
you have Epstein bar you also have strep

977
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:25,880
strep acacus acne is caused by strep

978
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,520
that's what causes acne it gets it's in

979
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,839
the liver goes up through the lymphatic

980
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,520
system then it goes up underneath the

981
00:39:28,839 --> 00:39:33,800
Derma and it sits there sits there and

982
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:37,119
sits there and it works its way up acne

983
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:39,040
is what it it acne is Strep women with

984
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:40,480
PCOS meaning an ovary problem because

985
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:43,640
they're fighting Epstein

986
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:46,160
bar have acne because they're going to

987
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:48,480
have strep too research and science is

988
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:52,640
so far from that it's unbelievable to

989
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:54,079
this deg to this degree um irregular

990
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,400
periods of course it can be irregular

991
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:57,200
periods when you have Epstein bar

992
00:39:55,400 --> 00:40:00,040
reproductive systems go irregular

993
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:02,480
happens all the time W gain that's the

994
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:03,960
liver that's the liver causing that

995
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,160
because what happens is for the

996
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:08,480
reproductive system to be like this

997
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:10,000
because of the fact that Epstein bar was

998
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,960
present it means you had it your whole

999
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,520
life all the way since childhood the

1000
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:16,119
sluggish liver occurs that sluggish

1001
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:17,960
liver occurs in a lot of women they'll

1002
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:20,160
have one or two varieties of Epstein bar

1003
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:22,079
inside the liver and they'll also have

1004
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,920
other gunk in the liver too and the

1005
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:25,599
high-fat diets really burden the liver

1006
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,640
too cuz everybody's on a high-fat diet

1007
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:30,040
all the way from bird on all the way

1008
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:32,880
from birth on I mean not birth sorry

1009
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:35,200
after the breast milk which is lowfat

1010
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:37,760
it's high we we we all push high-fat

1011
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:39,400
diet the the human nature does that or

1012
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:42,839
whatever the industries it's all high

1013
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:44,960
fat high fat under the hidden gu of high

1014
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:47,599
protein by the way so the weight gain is

1015
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:50,079
the sluggish stagnant liver that's a

1016
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:52,240
liver problem hence why you can even

1017
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:53,760
have inflammation discovered by science

1018
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,319
and research where they discovered

1019
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,520
inflammation in the liver and they've

1020
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:59,280
Associated that with PCOS cases because

1021
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,880
duh it's the Epstein bar inside the

1022
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,160
liver causing the liver to be stagnant

1023
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,359
sluggish and

1024
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:06,200
toxic and what happens then is the

1025
00:41:04,359 --> 00:41:08,839
weight gain occurs because of the liver

1026
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:10,359
condition this is just some symptoms

1027
00:41:08,839 --> 00:41:12,359
same thing with the diabetes that's a

1028
00:41:10,359 --> 00:41:13,960
liver condition the diabetes insulin

1029
00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:15,839
resistance because your liver runs out

1030
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:17,680
of glucose so it can't protect you

1031
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:19,839
anymore it can't release GL GL the

1032
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:22,400
glucose into your bloodstream to protect

1033
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:24,200
you anymore and then and then when

1034
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,480
you're dumping all this high fat into

1035
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:27,480
your body and high fat into your

1036
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:29,040
bloodstream you get insulin resistance

1037
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:31,960
and then when you even eat a piece of

1038
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:34,920
sugar the insulin the insulin resistance

1039
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:36,920
shows itself it shows itself I talked

1040
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:38,760
about this on the diabetes show it's not

1041
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:40,520
the sugar that does it it's all the high

1042
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:42,040
fat and the sluggish liver and the liver

1043
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:43,839
dysfunction same thing with cholesterol

1044
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:45,200
problems it's the liver dysfunction all

1045
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:48,960
because of Epstein

1046
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:51,280
bar that's how it works um I'm just

1047
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:54,079
going over some of these some of these

1048
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:56,520
so the whole bit and then you know

1049
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:58,760
what's really disturbing about the whole

1050
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:01,200
thing with PCOS is the diets that they

1051
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:03,319
recommend for it first of all treatment

1052
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:06,079
birth control that's the treatment oh

1053
00:42:03,319 --> 00:42:08,800
birth control there's the treatment

1054
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:11,160
great progestin there's the treatment

1055
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:14,560
great um diabetic drugs there's the

1056
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:16,240
treatment great um you know that that

1057
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:19,760
that's the treatment right there that's

1058
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:22,440
what we have here we are right now what

1059
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:25,760
year we're in where are we and that's

1060
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:26,800
the treatment right there that's the big

1061
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,599
big

1062
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,760
Discovery that's where science and

1063
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:33,200
research is here's birth control a

1064
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:34,839
steroid to try to suppress your viral

1065
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,400
symptoms they don't know that they don't

1066
00:42:34,839 --> 00:42:38,359
know that that's trying to suppress

1067
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:41,240
viral symptoms because it's what it is

1068
00:42:38,359 --> 00:42:43,599
now I'm not making fun of birth control

1069
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:46,599
I mean I'm not razin on it it's what it

1070
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:49,119
is birth control is it's it's a it's a

1071
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:50,880
variety of steroids it's a certain batch

1072
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:52,359
of steroids it's a certain combination

1073
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,760
it's a certain chemical balance of

1074
00:42:52,359 --> 00:42:56,559
hormones which are

1075
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:59,079
steroids and the reason why they even

1076
00:42:56,559 --> 00:43:00,640
see some results with that is because

1077
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:02,920
when you have a viral infection and a

1078
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:04,800
chronic viral infection steroids tend to

1079
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:07,960
numb it out meaning reduce the

1080
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:10,960
inflammation calm things down so that

1081
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:12,839
everything's not going chaotic and crazy

1082
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,440
but research and science doesn't even

1083
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:16,599
acknowledge they don't even know that

1084
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:18,200
that's what they're using it for that's

1085
00:43:16,599 --> 00:43:24,040
how backwards we

1086
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:27,400
are and so treatment is really now just

1087
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:28,760
okay you get these trendy clinics

1088
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:30,160
conventional medical clinics with

1089
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:32,640
doctors in there and like okay you got

1090
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:34,359
to go high fat you got to go no carb you

1091
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:37,480
can't get sugar in you we got to get you

1092
00:43:34,359 --> 00:43:38,440
exercising here's here's birth control

1093
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:39,760
and this is you're going to have this

1094
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:42,400
the rest of your life you're never going

1095
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,559
to you know have babies and you know and

1096
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,440
you're going to have to get used to it

1097
00:43:43,559 --> 00:43:48,240
we have a counselor here at the clinic

1098
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:49,599
talk to the counselor make appointments

1099
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:51,160
you're spending thousands and thousands

1100
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:52,720
of dollars you didn't even get a real

1101
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:54,400
answer to what the illness is and then

1102
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,760
when you try to ask the doctor what is

1103
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,200
this doctor says well you know we just

1104
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:00,240
think it's it's

1105
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:02,079
genetic and maybe maybe it even could be

1106
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:04,040
the body attacking itself but probably

1107
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:05,280
just all genetic in this situation and

1108
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:07,960
then you go to your counselor you're

1109
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:09,640
spending all this money all this money

1110
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:11,440
not everybody has health insurance not

1111
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:12,760
everybody has good health insurance some

1112
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,400
people have terrible terrible health

1113
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:16,880
insurance some people they can't even

1114
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:18,760
use their health insurance a lot of

1115
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:21,359
people can't because they can't even

1116
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:25,119
meet the the required whatever so it's

1117
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:28,119
like the bottom line is is then you're

1118
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:31,240
just you're just that's it that's it

1119
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:34,440
there you are where we are today with

1120
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:37,319
womenkind I mean come on it's

1121
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:38,760
unbelievable when you think about it

1122
00:44:37,319 --> 00:44:40,839
okay so what do we need to do we need to

1123
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:43,119
go after the virus 100% we need to

1124
00:44:40,839 --> 00:44:45,040
attack and kill the virus can it work

1125
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:46,680
yes it can work can you get rid of PCOS

1126
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,480
yes you can meaning you can get rid of

1127
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:50,599
the ovarian syndrome part of it and you

1128
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:52,839
can get rid of most all other symptoms

1129
00:44:50,599 --> 00:44:54,520
too you do all the right stuff one of

1130
00:44:52,839 --> 00:44:57,119
the most disastrous things you can do

1131
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:59,079
with PCOS or anybody diagnosed the PCOS

1132
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:00,720
or with diabetes or with any of the

1133
00:44:59,079 --> 00:45:05,160
symptoms I talked about

1134
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:07,040
before is eating high fat is eating that

1135
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:08,760
all it does is B bog your liver down

1136
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:10,319
make it worse and worse and worse make

1137
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:12,240
things worse eventually switch your

1138
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:13,920
weight to not losing it anymore because

1139
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,240
it's kind of like the ketogenic method

1140
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,040
where you take all your sugar away you

1141
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:18,640
eat all this high fat you start losing

1142
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,520
weight you exercise and then guess what

1143
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:22,520
you blow up and you gain the most weight

1144
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:24,599
you've ever done in history 5 years

1145
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:27,000
later 3 years later with still having

1146
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:29,160
PCOS still having symptoms still having

1147
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,800
to be on everything else so what can you

1148
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:33,760
do you can do something I promise you

1149
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:36,640
you can first thing is first you got to

1150
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:38,319
go on an antiviral protocol you have to

1151
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:40,000
you have to go on an antiviral protocol

1152
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:42,839
talk to your practitioner get somebody

1153
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,319
to help you with this okay and you want

1154
00:45:42,839 --> 00:45:47,559
to do some cats claw very helpful with

1155
00:45:45,319 --> 00:45:49,760
with this because cats claw will go and

1156
00:45:47,559 --> 00:45:52,079
start to seek out the cats claws

1157
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:54,160
photochemicals that are poison to

1158
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:56,680
viruses like Epstein bar and quite

1159
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:59,880
frankly poison to strep which causes

1160
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:01,800
acne and and so you know it's the

1161
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:03,640
confusion they don't even understand

1162
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,400
because all people with bcos end up with

1163
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:08,280
thyroid problems too it's all kind of in

1164
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:09,839
the it's all part of the Epstein bar and

1165
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:11,280
all these different symptoms occur from

1166
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:12,640
the liver the Epstein bar and the liver

1167
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,839
all these different symptoms occur and

1168
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:15,880
everything they just don't even

1169
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:18,480
understand any of this it's amazing so

1170
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:19,760
what comes down to the diet we'll talk

1171
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,359
about more about supplements in a minute

1172
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,640
too when it comes down to the diet you

1173
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:25,480
want to be lowfat and you want fruit in

1174
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:27,240
your diet they keep fruit away from

1175
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:29,160
women the very thing that heals the

1176
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:31,839
reproductive system the very thing that

1177
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:34,040
can actually give a woman a chance to

1178
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:37,520
have a healthy baby is fruit for the

1179
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:40,280
reproductive system a baby is a fruit is

1180
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:42,920
a fruit of the reproductive system

1181
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:45,520
that's what that it's every flower the

1182
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:48,119
reproductive system is this flower is

1183
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:49,640
what it is and then it gets

1184
00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:52,200
pollinated

1185
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:54,119
right and so that's the whole point

1186
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:56,040
that's the whole point and and you have

1187
00:46:54,119 --> 00:46:57,920
to eat fruit you need the antioxid since

1188
00:46:56,040 --> 00:47:00,720
you need the sugars to feed the

1189
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:02,599
reproductive system but starve out the

1190
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:04,960
virus the Epstein bar virus because

1191
00:47:02,599 --> 00:47:07,520
that's what it does the fruit also

1192
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:09,040
restores the glucose glycogen res um

1193
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:11,359
storage banks of the liver so the

1194
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:14,599
adrenals get stronger so the weight

1195
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:17,200
drops that's critical but you got to

1196
00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:20,000
keep the fats down low here's the great

1197
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:22,920
disaster about PCOS eggs they tell women

1198
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,640
to eat more eggs lots of eggs eggs are

1199
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:28,960
disastrous they feed the epine bar they

1200
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:31,200
make PCOS worse so worse so bad it's

1201
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:33,520
unbelievable it's it's the most

1202
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:36,280
frightening frightening recommendation

1203
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:39,000
is eggs for a woman with PCOS dairy

1204
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:41,240
products cheese they'll leave they'll

1205
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:44,680
leave their the you know they'll leave

1206
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:45,960
the doctor's office going to buy cheese

1207
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:48,400
and the doctor might be like oh no get

1208
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:51,160
hard cheeses though quality hard cheeses

1209
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,920
unbelievable and oh be on eggs y be on

1210
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:55,040
high protein make sure lots of chicken

1211
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:58,040
chicken's the worst thing the worst

1212
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:59,640
thing for p PCOS I would consider going

1213
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:02,000
even plant-based with

1214
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:04,319
PCOS at least for a time in your life

1215
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,480
for a little while and then or and if

1216
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:08,800
you can't do that you can do a little

1217
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,880
chicken but a little bit or a little

1218
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,280
because you're not going to make room

1219
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:12,640
for the foods that actually knock out

1220
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,200
the Epstein bar and heal the liver so

1221
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,920

00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,000
all of it I would consider you

1227
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:27,359
plant-based for a while it has nothing

1228
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,359
to do with my belie system here or there

1229
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:31,240
whatever cuz I don't buy into any belief

1230
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:33,119
system there is it's what's right for

1231
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:34,720
the person what's wrong with them and

1232
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:36,319
what you need to do and what's happening

1233
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:38,280
and with the Epstein bar getting into

1234
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:39,960
the ovary and doing that in the

1235
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:42,000
reproductive system you want to starve

1236
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:43,720
it out and in order to starve it out you

1237
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,839

you pull Metals out of the reproductive

1245
00:48:58,119 --> 00:49:02,240
system cuz Metals feed also feed the

1246
00:49:00,359 --> 00:49:04,520
Epstein bar and cause it to get stronger

1247
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:07,559
you pull that out of your system you get

1248
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:09,119
that the spirina feeds feeds the ovaries

1249
00:49:07,559 --> 00:49:11,559
so they can get stronger so they can

1250
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:13,000

1271
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:56,280
have some pumpkin seeds you can have a

1272
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:57,839
few walnuts you can can do things like

1273
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:59,920
that but you have to have enough fruits

1274
00:49:57,839 --> 00:50:02,000
and vegetables to help heal the problem

1275
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:03,920
so that means you got to lower the

1276
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,400
chicken you got to lower the turkey you

1277
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:07,920
got to lower the red meat whether it's

1278
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,559
grass-fed or free range or whatever you

1279
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:12,040
got to lower them because the high fat

1280
00:50:09,559 --> 00:50:14,559
content fills up the blood clogs up the

1281
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:16,079
liver the the virus thrives in the liver

1282
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:17,520
when the virus thrives in the liver it's

1283
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:19,000
going to thrive in the reprodu

1284
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:21,240
reproductive system it's going to thrive

1285
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,040
in the ovaries and when you have that

1286
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:24,559
you can't even go after it so when the

1287
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:27,480
chronic inflammation that they're

1288
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:29,240
detecting is viral caused your body's

1289
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:31,400
your body is trying to go after this

1290
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:32,760
virus and if you clog up the blood and

1291
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:34,440
everything else in the reproductive

1292
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:35,920
system with high fats and your liver

1293
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:38,280
gets sluggish and it's clogged up with

1294
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:40,040
high fats you can't even go after it and

1295
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:42,119
when you lower your fat and you bring in

1296
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:44,240
more fruits and more salads and more

1297
00:50:42,119 --> 00:50:46,280
spinach and lots of cilantro and parsley

1298
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:48,880
and you bring all this in and tomatoes

1299
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:50,160
lots of fresh tomatoes tomatoes are so

1300
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,319
