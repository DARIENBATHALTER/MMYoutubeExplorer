133
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,880

139
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,919

172
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:13,360
you can't clean up the lymphatic system

173
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,880
until you clean up the liver really

174
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,360
important

175
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,360
you can't clean up the lymphatic system

176
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,880

you have to clean that up first if you

184
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,360
don't clean that up

185
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,120
there is no cleaning the lymphatic

186
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,800

187
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,600
lymphatic system really important to

189
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:48,240
that's how it works and

190
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:51,120
another thing too by the way you can't

191
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:54,240
clean up your brain

192
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,160
until you clean up your liver it's

193
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,599
another thing too you can't clean your

194
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,240
brain up either

195
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:02,000
that's a whole nother point your brain

196
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,880
is not supposed to be

197
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
the filter you guys your brain is not

198
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,880
supposed to be the filter

199
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,240
but it becomes the filter because our

200
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:14,240
liver stays dirty

201
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:17,360
and sick so our brain becomes a filter

202
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:20,080
it's not supposed to be a filter

203
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,280
so everybody walks around dirty brains

204
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,400
dirty

205
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:27,280
gross brains filled with sludge

206
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,240
and pus all going through it and acid

207
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,039
going through it

208
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,960
we walk around with acid brains because

209
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:36,080
we need to cleanse

210
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,880
and that's how it works once your liver

211
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,479
gets dirty

212
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,599
it starts to get clogged up over the

213
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:44,639
years everything else gets dirty

214
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:47,199
and nasty that's how our bodies work

215
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:50,720
that's how our system works

216
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,720
important to know right there

217
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,240
so i don't know if you guys were ever

218
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:00,400
told or if you ever heard about

219
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:03,280
it don't cleanse one of the most

220
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,840
powerful and cleansing foods bring some

221
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,560
of the uh

222
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:10,240
con reading some of the comments to you

223
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,240
guys trying to catch them wherever i can

224
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,160
um

225
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,240
so someone's saying most chemicals

226
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,919
cannot pass through the blood-brain

227
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,919
barrier

228
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:25,280
uh did you just say blood

229
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:28,720
did you say blood so on tick-tock most

230
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,479
chemicals and toxins cannot pass through

231
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,200
the blood-brain barrier

232
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,919
uh does your does your brain need any

233
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,159
blood

234
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:40,240
you guys does your brain get any blood

235
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,080
i'm just curious about that just because

236
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,800
i'm scratching my head on that one

237
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,519
i love when you throw a comment at me

238
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,240
that

239
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,279
is so ridiculous that it's a head

240
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:54,320
scratcher um

241
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:56,399
okay so if blood gets to your brain

242
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,240
in it is going to be to poisons and

243
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,399
toxins you know that right

244
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,839
on tick tock you know that right i mean

245
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,240
you know that

246
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,200
your blood is filled with garbage and

247
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,240
junk chemical

248
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:11,600
chemical compounds that are synthesized

249
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,720
chemicals toxins fragrances junk toxic

250
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,519
heavy metals

251
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,320
all kinds of exposure fat acids all

252
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,000
kinds of things

253
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,160
floating around your bloodstream right

254
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,360
okay all the pesticides herbicides

255
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,480
fungicides floating around your

256
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,120
bloodstream right

257
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,720
bloodstream did you hear me bloodstream

258
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,920
did you know your brain gets

259
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,680
blood right

260
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,839
so when you try to throw out that whole

261
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:37,920
thing that blood brain barrier thing

262
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:41,040
okay your brain tissue

263
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,959
needs blood so you're pretending no

264
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,720
blood goes to the brain whatsoever

265
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,560
so you're just pretending you're just

266
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,399
telling me it's all spinal fluid

267
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,519
so not one drop of blood goes through

268
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,200
the brain it's just all spinal fluid

269
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,959
so that doesn't even make sense

270
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,160
basically that's just already naturally

271
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,959
debunked

272
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,440
your blood is filled with junk your

273
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:03,040
blood

274
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:05,519
goes to the brain that's how it works

275
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,120
is there a part of the brain that

276
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,440
actually has the spinal fluid

277
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,240
aspect of it yeah but what about the

278
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,839
rest of it

279
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,200
what about the wrestling it's critical

280
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,200
this is critical information

281
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,760
but you know what though i'm glad you're

282
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,680
here on tick tock and i appreciate it

283
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,040
because it's those kinds of comments

284
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,640
that are important because

285
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,800
someone else is going to hear that

286
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,440
catherine elizabeth gaspino good to see

287
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,560
you

288
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:33,920
um if the liver can't

289
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:36,160
clean up and stop the toxin it's gonna

290
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:39,120
go to the brain

291
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,000
and you're gonna get sicker and sicker

292
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,519
someday or

293
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:47,600
get sick that's how it works

294
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:50,480
it's important to know so

295
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,680
the blood brain barrier you can't

296
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,320
pretend

297
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,680
the brain doesn't get any any blood

298
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,240
whatsoever

299
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,600
you can't pretend it gets no blood

300
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,800
because it does

301
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,440
it does and that blood is dirty going to

302
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:08,560
the brain

303
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,560
that's how it works yeah

304
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,760
the liver is your filter that's your big

305
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,000
filter

306
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,560
i'm watching the comments on tick-tock

307
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,560
for the moment

308
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,720
bro the blood-brain barrier is not your

309
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,519
filter

310
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:28,800
so it's not your brain's filter so keep

311
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:31,440
that in mind too

312
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,120
catherine says we were told to cleanse

313
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,800
but not in the right way okay so let's

314
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,839
go into that part

315
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,760
catherine really good point okay a lot

316
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,240
of people are told to cleanse

317
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,200
and it's all the wrong way so keep that

318
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:47,120
in mind

319
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:50,480
friends for instance you can't cleanse

320
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,959
if there are any fats in your cleanse

321
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,519
if you're downing olive oil in a cleanse

322
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,279
because

323
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,959
that happens a lot have you guys ever

324
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,480
heard that have you ever heard of like

325
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,760
cleanses where you're dumping olive oil

326
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,279
and straight straight in you

327
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,040
just let you know let me know if you

328
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,680
drop a comment and let me know about

329
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,320
that one

330
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,839
if you've seen that before live on

331
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,800
clubhouse tick tock

332
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,200
live on facebook live on youtube have

333
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,079
you

334
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,800
heard of olive oil being in a cleanse at

335
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:18,320
all

336
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:21,839
just curious because

337
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,399
you can't cleanse anything if there's a

338
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,639
fat

339
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:30,560
inside your cleanse okay

340
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:32,079
so keep that in mind that's important

341
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,600
once you have fat in your bloodstream

342
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:37,519
your liver can't cleanse

343
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:40,639
it's focused on producing bile

344
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:43,360
that's how it works so you can be

345
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,040
you can be somebody that's eating light

346
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:49,120
you're just doing some drinks

347
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:50,320
with with olive oil in there right

348
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,480
i'm seeing some of you guys have

349
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,560
actually seen that liver flush

350
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,160
right crispy apple says liver flush with

351
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,320
the olive oil

352
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,240
you don't flush the liver when you're

353
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,079
doing the olive oil you don't

354
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,639
all you're doing is shutting the liver

355
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,720
down it can't cleanse when you put

356
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,560
when you put the olive oil in there this

357
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,279
is really important

358
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,600
linea says i have a friend who is

359
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,600
drinking olive oil to cleanse

360
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,839
but he never got better because you

361
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:21,200
can't cleanse

362
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:25,519
you can't cleanse with

363
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:28,800
olive oil in your cleanse drink

364
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:32,079
it's not possible you

365
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:36,480
have to stop the liver from

366
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:40,720
having to work in order to cleanse

367
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:45,920
your liver needs to take a vacation

368
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:49,279
in order for you to cleanse

369
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:51,519
bottom line that's how it works

370
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,959
the minute you dump in the fat and

371
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,800
you're dropping in the fat

372
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,160
and you're putting in your drink and

373
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,279
someone's gave you some

374
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:02,320
brilliant brainiac cleanse idea

375
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:04,000
because of some trendy bs cleanse and

376
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,760
you're dropping the olive oil in

377

499
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,600
everybody is sick

500
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,600
even science and research says they

501
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,240
don't know what everybody's saying

502
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,600

that doesn't know why anybody's sick

505
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,240

your head around that for like two

507
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,280
seconds

508
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,960

519
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:46,480
anybody's sick

520
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:49,919
but you want scientific evidence

521
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,280
that's what you want but what you will

522
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,039
find that science takes

523
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,880
information from medical medium after

524
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,160
it's been published so and here's one

525
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,840
thing for like if you're a

526
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,760
science-minded person

527
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,000
science and research has never proved

528
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:06,080
medical medium information wrong yet

529
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,320
it's only proven it right that's a fact

530
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,080
the info is advanced it's already healed

531
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,360
millions worldwide from chronic illness

532
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,480
and i have the street cred

533
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:17,919
see what i like is street cred

534
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,840
scientific data doesn't make me happy

535
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,440
because i've seen millions of people

536
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,880
screwed over out there

537
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,720
losing their lives losing their

538
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,000
livelihoods losing their careers losing

539
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,200
their relationships losing their

540
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,039
husbands and wives

541
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,520
losing their boyfriends and girlfriends

542
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:33,280
losing their fiances

543
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,799
because of sickness and chronic sickness

544
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,520
and illness because it's either made

545
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:40,400
them

546
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:40,400
lose it completely or made them so sick

547
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:47,919
lerna says science was not able to help

548
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:50,640
me with my bad trigeminal neuralgia mm

549
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:51,280
healed me science just drilled my

550
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,840
healthy

551
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,039
teeth until i lost several of my

552
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:58,159
beautiful teeth so

553
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:59,840
on tick-tock did you hear that

554
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,080
see how important it is to know how

555
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:04,240
things work so i get it i know you're

556
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:06,080
curious where's your scientific evidence

557
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,280
about fats

558
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,640
but you're when you're dealing with

559
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,480
medical medium information you're

560
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,159
dealing with medical medium information

561
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,679
you're dealing with advanced information

562
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:16,240
that science takes later

563
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,919
all the doctors are using now people are

564
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,360
stealing it left and right in the health

565
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,039
movement and not citing it back to

566
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:24,159
medical medium even though

567
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:25,440
factual it's been published first

568
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,919
so what you're going to find if you're

569
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,960
new here mm info has never been proven

570
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:32,880
wrong and it's never contradicted itself

571
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,559
fact but when you go listen to your

572
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,400
doctors on your doctor podcast or

573
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,720
something

574
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,480
and they're stealing medical medium

575
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,400
information

576
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,000
or they've contradicted themselves a

577
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,120
million times throughout the last 10

578
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,400
years of the career

579
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:50,640
think about that for a second so let's

580
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,200
talk about this

581
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,280
our livers get sluggish and stagnant

582
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,480
they get overworked they get pathogens

583
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,360
inside of them

584
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,880
everybody has bugs inside their liver

585
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,760

586
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,559

you do that you're not gonna cleanse

640
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,960
just so you know

641
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:23,360
when you're when you're overnight when

642
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,400
you're sleeping you're not eating any

643
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,799
fat

644
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,320
when you're awake you're tanking the

645
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:31,279
fats

646
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,320
so your liver is doing its cleansing all

647
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,240
night long

648
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,159
because you're not bombarding it with

649
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,840
fats

650
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,919
here you go you have your dinner at

651
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,480
night and whatever your dinner is

652
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:43,840
you just hit your liver with fats right

653
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,360
that's how it works

654
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:50,720
so you had to roast the chicken at night

655
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:53,120
for dinner you had your roasted chicken

656
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,840
at night for dinner you just slammed

657
00:24:53,120 --> 00:25:00,320
your liver with fats okay

658
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:02,880
but you go to bed and the hours go by

659
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,400
right say you eat at seven o'clock at

660
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,559
night

661
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,880
three hours later it's ten o'clock at

662
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,880
night

663
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,120
four hours later it's eleven five hours

664
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,600
it's twelve

665
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,240
six hours it's one two o'clock in the

666
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,320
morning you're

667
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:22,559
seven hours since eating your fat

668
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,840
three in the morning i think we're at

669
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,799
three in the morning two in the morning

670
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,080
three in the morning

671
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:31,679
three in the morning okay

672
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:33,600
we're another couple of hours in

673
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,279
now we're getting to the point where we

674
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:39,679
haven't eaten

675
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:42,880
in a lot of hours keep that in mind

676
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:46,240
you're eight hours into not eating

677
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:49,840
eight hours right

678
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:52,080
so now your liver is free

679
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,559
it's clean it's already been working on

680
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:57,600
dealing with processing that dinner time

681
00:25:54,559 --> 00:26:00,720
fat it was processing and working on it

682
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:03,600

683
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:05,279

686
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:15,200
we're nine hours into it if

687
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:16,640

689
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,640

695
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,360
now you're 9 10 11 hours into it

seven

700
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:49,520
your chicken fat

701
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:53,200

702
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:55,360

706
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:04,000
how it works you guys

you see how it works your liver is ready

708
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,440

709
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,440
okay the chicken you ate

710
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:19,120
the chicken you ate was a long time ago

711
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:21,679
right the chicken fat was a long time

712
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:24,720
ago you guys

713
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:25,039
but here's the deal you don't want to

714
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,520
put

715
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:30,559
fat back in your diet in the morning

716
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,559
because the minute you do

717
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:38,000
you can't cleanse you can't clean

718
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:40,880
up it's not going to happen

719
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,880
i'm letting you know

720
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,760
the minute you drop in that peanut

721
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,159
butter on your smoothie the minute you

722
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,080
put

723
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:49,520
that olive oil in your smoothie the

724
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,120
minute you have your coconut oil minute

725
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:55,760
you put olive oil on your bread

726
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:58,960
the minute you have avocado

727
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:02,240
you're not cleansing anymore done

728
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,919
it's over and i know that gets people

729
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,960
upset they're like oh he doesn't like

730
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,360
avocado

731
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:09,200
he must be a real stupid guy in the

732
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:11,279
health scene he must be really dumb

733
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,679
because every single podcast i listen to

734
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:16,240
they talk about how healthy avocado is

735
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:18,000
everybody's having avocado toast he must

736
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,600
not know what's going on are you kidding

737
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,080
me

738
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:24,080
i i still don't i still i'm still not

739
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,840
sure we'd be here in the avocado world

740
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,320
like we were if it wasn't for 35 years

741
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,000
of me

742
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,760
trying to teach people to eat avocado

743
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,039
because i needed them to eat avocado

744
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:35,279
instead of pork because it's a better

745
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:38,799
fat it's a healthy fat

746
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:41,600
but it doesn't it doesn't change

747
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:42,720
the fact that when you have your avocado

748
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:46,000
in the morning

749
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:48,000
your cleanse just ended

750
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,039
i try to get people to eat avocado

751
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,480

830
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,720
thing just so you know

831
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:17,440
i'm gonna give you some very important

832
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,440
tip right here

833
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:21,840
you wake up in the morning

834
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:28,480
and you have your coffee and you say

835
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:30,399
well i'm not eating anthony

836
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,159
so i should be cleansing fine i just

837
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:36,000
have my coffee

838
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:39,279
and i'm drinking my coffee black aw

839
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,600
so i should be cleansing because there's

840
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:44,799
no

841
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:44,799
fat in my coffee i'm drinking it black

842
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:52,640
wrong wrong here's how it works

843
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:54,320
the minute you use the psychoactive drug

844
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,880
caffeine

845
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:59,760
the minute you use that in the morning

846
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,760
guess what happens

847
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:10,320
your adrenaline stops your cleanse

848
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:12,640
adrenaline produced by the psychoactive

849
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:16,399
drug caffeine in the morning

850
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:20,799
stops your cleanse your cleansing

851
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:24,159
over done and done

852
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:26,480
that's how it works just so you know

853
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:29,600
because adrenaline is so highly

854
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:31,840
corrosive and toxic

855
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,720
that the liver has to put up with it

856
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,480
immediately

857
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,320
it has to shut down it's cleansing

858
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,799
immediately your liver is done

859
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:41,519
it's done the minute you drink your

860
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:43,440
coffee in the morning

861
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,440
i don't care if you're someone's like i

862
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,360
don't really eat much in the morning i

863
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,640
don't need anything i just drink my cup

864
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,440
of coffee

865
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,000
so i'm not a big ham and egg person in

866
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,840
the morning

867
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:58,000
so i aw really you know i got it covered

868
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,679
what happens is the minute you drink

869
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,120
your coffee you have your psychoactive

870
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:04,080
drug in the morning

871
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:05,440
your adrenals start to explode release

872
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,760
all the epinephrine

873
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,359
and your liver has to suck it up and

874
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,800
absorb it up and it has to stop

875
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:12,639
cleansing immediately and

876
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,159
decaf still it's the same thing it's

877
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,800
caffeine green tea is still the same

878
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,359
thing

879
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:20,320
matcha tea is still the same thing just

880
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:22,960
letting you know

881
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:24,079
so you do your coffee in the morning

882
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:27,440
guess what

883
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:33,040
you're not cleansing it's over

884
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:35,359
no plans happening no cleanse happening

885
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:38,159
lerna says coffee is extremely toxic on

886
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:39,599
the body it destroys bones and teeth it

887
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,599
does

888
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,280
it does now if you're going to keep your

889
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:44,639
coffee in i still want you to do your

890
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,639
celery juice

891
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:48,000
they're still going to be helpful

892
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,760
abilities that everything

893
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,359

894
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,879
i'm talking i'm talking about the

895
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,839
medical medium morning cleanse about

896
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:56,879
cleansing

897
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:59,119
deep stuff so you cleanse every day

898
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:01,760
and you work on healing and the minute

899
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:04,800
you bring in that caffeine

900
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:07,760
cleanse stops because your adrenaline is

901
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:10,800
so toxic your liver has to absorb it

902
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:13,119
so cleanse over done

00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,119

00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:51,040
now if you don't have your celery juice

940
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:54,160
you don't have it

941
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:57,760
just don't do your fats sure

942
00:36:54,160 --> 00:37:00,320
your cleanse might not be as powerful

943
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,880
without the celery juice but you're

944
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:04,320
still

945
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:05,119
cleansing see guys you're still

946
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,440
cleansing

947
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:09,280
now keep this in mind if you're someone

948
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,760
that doesn't want to eat or drink

949
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,640
anything all morning long and you think

950
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,560
that will be

951
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,839
a cleanse because you're not doing any

952
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:18,800
fats like aw

953
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:22,720
says don't do any fats you're not going

954
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:24,079
to cleanse

955
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,839
the reason why you're not going to

956
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:28,079
cleanse

957
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:30,160
is because when you run on adrenaline

958
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,280
and you have no mineral salts or glucose

959
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:34,079
in your bloodstream

960
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,720

cleanse

962
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,839

963
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:41,359

00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:42,160
celery juice is glucose in it and

1055
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:45,359
mineral salts keep that in mind

1056
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:46,720
glucose and mineral salts are in celery

1057
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:49,920

00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:52,480

happens

messed up out there

1119
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:18,800
one of the obstacles is that

1120
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:24,079

if fruit is not in your diet you're

1125
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:35,200
going to rely more on what

1126
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,920
what are you guys going to rely more on

1127
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:39,200
you're going to rely

1128
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:41,839
more on fatty fruits

1129
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:43,839
it's a fruit but fatty fruits they're

1130
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:46,160
going to rely on more on nuts and nut

1131
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:48,800
butters and

1132
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:50,000
almonds right peanut butter you're going

1133
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:53,200
to rely more on these

1134
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,960
things is what you're going to do

1135
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:57,280
you know and that's what's going to

1136
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,280
happen

1137
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:01,599
you're going to rely more on those

1138
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,599
things

1139
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:05,839
so

1140
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,960
a lot of times when we rely

1141
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:15,920
we rely more on those things we get in

1142
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,640
trouble because now we're relying on the

1143
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:20,400
fat

1144
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:22,319
is what we're relying on and

1145
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,920
there's really no way out with that one

1146
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:25,280
you're going to think well no i rely on

1147
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,160
protein that's what you're going to

1148
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,400
you're going to think you're going to be

1149
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:30,800
like no i rely on protein

1150
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,640
i'm not relying on fat and that's where

1151
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,319
we get in trouble right there because we

1152
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:37,920
don't realize that

1153
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:40,160
our protein is filled with fat

1154
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:47,839
and that's something we don't realize is

1155
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:47,839
that our protein is filled with fat

1156
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:53,680
you know what's fun about doing these

1157
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:56,720
live

1158
00:45:53,680 --> 00:46:01,839
that when you mess up

1159
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:01,839
everybody knows it

1160
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:09,680
so so when something's going on and

1161
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:09,680
you're doing damage control

1162
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:15,359
everybody can figure it out all right

1163
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:18,640
i'm back i'm back

1164
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:19,760
where did i go green blue i forgot to

1165
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:23,200
defrost the

1166
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:25,359
pitaya so

1167
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,880
i got some frozen pattaya here you guys

dragon fruit right there

1169
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:31,520
i forgot to defrost it so i basically

1170
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:33,680
had a bag of dragon fruit

1171
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:36,960
and it was all stuck together and i was

1172
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:41,760
trying to chip away at it like this

1173
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:43,280
chipping away with a spoon to get it out

1174
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,240
guys we're live on clubhouse live on

1175
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,720

so many people swear by it

1183
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:10,960
but science didn't didn't say so

1184
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:12,960
it doesn't matter what people say

1185
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:14,400
doesn't matter about people healing

1186
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:17,119
doesn't matter about people getting

1187
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:20,480
their lives back doesn't matter

1188
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:21,200
right because science science didn't

1189
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,960
okay it

1190
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,480

here i'm putting wild blueberries in

1203
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:48,000
here but i have been doing this where i

1204
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:50,000
put the

1205
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,200
wild blueberry juice in there too i put

1206
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,839

1208
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:00,480
some medicinal factors right

1209
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:06,079
that's the weimann's by the way just so

1210
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:07,920
you know what that is

1211
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:10,480
i work with them on that juice by the

1212
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:12,960
way i work with them

1213
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:15,280
this is for the record that's the

1214
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:17,920
wyman's wild blueberry juice you guys

1215
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:19,359
i'm i'm obsessed with it obsessed with

1216
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:22,240
it

1217
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:23,599
so i just popped in some frozen wild

1218
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,960
blueberries

1219
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:26,720
right that's two cups of frozen wild

1220
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:29,359
blueberries i'm making the

1221
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:32,839
medical medium liver rescue smoothie

1222
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:34,000
let's get the bananas next where are the

1223
00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:36,960
bananas

1224
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,960
some bananas going

1225
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:45,839
so science research

1226
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:50,160
doesn't if they don't okay you healing

1227
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:52,640
you didn't heal if your eczema went away

1228
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:55,200
it's not real science research didn't

1229
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:55,200
okay it

1230
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:59,920
you're not allowed to heal on your own

1231
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:06,559
science and research won't validate it

1232
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,559
putting two bananas in here

1233
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:12,800
so whenever you hear anybody come out

1234
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:14,559
and throw signs of research crap

1235
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:17,839
like where's your science about that or

1236
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:17,839
where's your research about that

1237
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:21,520
you've got to realize where they're

1238
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,720
coming from they're coming from a real

1239
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:24,160
ignorant place

1240
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:25,440
the person who's saying where's your

1241
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:27,440
science where's your research is

1242
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:29,040
completely ignorant to one fact

1243
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:30,800
science research doesn't want you to

1244
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:32,400
heal they won't even validate if someone

1245
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,440
actually healed on any level even if

1246
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,839
they got partially better

1247
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:37,359
science research won't validate it think

1248
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:39,119
about that

1249
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:42,480
how psycho is that that's actually

1250
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:44,240
psycho it's evil really

1251
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:46,559
it kind of goes beyond it's actually

1252
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,559
evil

1253
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:52,079
you didn't heal you didn't get better

1254
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:55,440
your 50 symptoms didn't go away

1255
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:58,640
besides the research didn't okay

1256
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:59,760
it just they didn't go away so let's go

1257
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,040
into this a little bit

1258
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,480
a lot of people are hung up on the

1259
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,839
protein factor and i think this is

1260
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:05,440
important i'm making a liver rescue

1261
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:07,520
smoothie but i want to just drop this on

1262
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:09,280
your critical piece of information

1263
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:12,079
you might be thinking i'm not doing fat

1264
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:13,040
i'm doing protein in the morning so

1265
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:15,680
you're thinking your

1266
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:16,800
your salmon in the morning is protein

1267
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,000
you're thinking you're tuning in the

1268
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,280
morning's protein you're thinking your

1269
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,400
chicken in the mornings protein you're

1270
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,200
thinking your protein powders are

1271
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:24,720
protein you're thinking

1272
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:26,240
there's fat and all that you're thinking

1273
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,680
that your nut butters in the morning are

1274
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:29,200
protein you're thinking your nuts and

1275
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,800
seeds are protein you see how it works

1276
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,599
you're thinking your protein bar is

1277
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,839
protein

1278
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:35,359
but it's all fat your protein bars fat

1279
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:36,640
so you're having fat in the morning

1280
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:38,079
thinking you're doing protein in the

1281
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:39,760
morning and then you stop your liver

1282
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:40,240
from cleansing so just keep that in mind

1283
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:43,440
that's

1284
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:44,800
really important right there and here's

1285
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:47,119
another thing too

1286
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:48,960
don't get obsessed about protein

1287
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:51,520
proteins in every single

1288
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:52,640
food protein isn't what keeps your

1289
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:54,400
muscles growing

1290
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:56,000
proteins not what makes your muscles

1291
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:58,319
grow proteins

1292
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,640
not what what not it's not what keeps

1293
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:04,000
your muscles strong

1294
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:06,559
okay so it's glucose

1295
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,359
that keeps your muscles strong okay it's

1296
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:09,200
sugar

1297
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:10,800
sugar has to enter every cell in the

1298
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,880
body sugar has to enter

1299
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:14,160
your muscles in order for your muscles

1300
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:16,079
to work

1301
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:17,760
sugar plus mineral salts keep that in

1302
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:19,200
mind if you're a bodybuilder you're

1303
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:22,480
saying why isn't aw

1304
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:24,720
like built like a tank that's because i

1305
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:26,800
don't have the time and energy

1306
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:28,960
because my time and energy goes into

1307
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:30,800
working 20-hour days

1308
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,480
and if i sit there and i do a two-hour

1309
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,839
workout every day

1310
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:37,119
basically what's gonna happen i just

1311
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:38,800
lost two critical three critical hours

1312
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:40,559
and so i can't do that right now i have

1313
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:42,960
a book deadline coming up i have a book

1314
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:45,920
deadline for the next so many years

1315
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:47,200
so what i do is i'll go out for a quick

1316
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:50,000
run or something

1317
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:51,440
or i'll go out for a quick bike ride but

1318
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,680
i can't go into the gym

1319
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:55,280
and i can't and i can't go in there for

1320
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:58,559
two three hours a day

1321
00:51:55,280 --> 00:52:00,319
start dedicating my life to bulking up

1322
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:02,559
it's just not it's just it's not

1323
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:04,640
something it takes an actual commitment

1324
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:06,319
of time

1325
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:09,040
doesn't you know i can't i go out and i

1326
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:12,480
try to do a half an hour where i can

1327
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:14,000
so keep that in mind if you're

1328
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,520
somebody's a bodybuilder what i do is i

1329
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,200
help bodybuilders i help you pro

1330
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:18,000
bodybuilders out there get their you

1331
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:20,000
know get their muscles

1332
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,920
to wherever they need to get it and i

1333
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,000
notice that when when a body builder

1334
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:26,079
gets older they lose their muscle

1335
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,240
unless they get enough carbohydrate you

1336
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:31,440
guys hear that you hear that

1337
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:33,359
when uh when when when athletes and

1338
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:36,720
bodybuilders get older

1339
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:39,200
and now they're in their 40s they start

1340
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:41,119
losing all their muscle

1341
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:42,400
because they're they're getting maxed

1342
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:44,000
out with fat

1343
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:45,440
they're just their fats are stuck all

1344
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,119
the fat

1345
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:48,720
in their protein they're eating is

1346
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:50,079
stopping their muscles from being able

1347
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:52,240
to stay strong

1348
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:53,760
so they start to decline so then you've

1349
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,319
got to switch it out you've got to take

1350
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:56,160
the fat

1351
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:57,920
out of their diet and bring in more

1352
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:59,520
carbohydrate and then when they're 40

1353
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,960
years old you could get them built back

1354
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:04,720
up again

1355
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:05,520
that's how it's done medical medium

1356
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,880
style

1357
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:08,000
so we're doing a liver rescue smoothie

1358
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:09,520
we've got bananas in there while

1359
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,440
blueberries i put some wine and wild

1360
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:13,800
blueberry juice

1361
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:16,000
um that's at shop lyman's

1362
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:19,440
lymanshot.weimans.com

1363
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:22,160
and keep the protein powders out

1364
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:22,960
keep the protein powders out okay very

1365
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:27,119
important to know

1366
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:30,079
keep the protein powders out um

1367
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:31,040
i'll put the vimergy wild blueberry

1368
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:34,800
powder in there too

1369
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:39,119
thing is with antioxidants is i love

1370
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:41,359
antioxidants right like i always have

1371
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:42,319
going all the way back so i try to get

1372
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:45,440
them where i can

1373
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:47,680
so i'll put the vimorjiwab blueberry

1374
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:51,839
powder in here

1375
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:56,640
with the frozen wild blueberries with

1376
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:58,960
the wyman blueberry juice right

1377
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:02,000
keep protein powders out they got hidden

1378
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:03,760
sugars they got hidden msg

1379
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,000
so that's another thing to keep in mind

1380
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:08,800
another important piece of information

1381
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,640
boom keep protein powders out you want

1382
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,200
to get healthier keep protein powders

1383
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,119
out

1384
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:14,640
protein powders don't make you healthier

1385
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:16,400
they got natural flavorings

1386
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:17,839
in most of them most of the protein

1387
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:21,040
powders have natural

1388
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:25,040
flavor in them

1389
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:26,960
and those natural flavorings is msg

1390
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:29,119
so in some protein powders they got

1391
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:32,559
added fat in them

1392
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:34,640
they got added msg in them okay

1393
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:36,880
and too much protein by the way kills

1394
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:39,280
your kidneys it kills your liver so

1395
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:40,720
there you go you don't want to be doing

1396
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:43,040
that

1397
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,760
lissy cone says and p protein is harsh

1398
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:46,160

1399
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:46,960
right question mark totally right let's

1401
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:53,359
harsh on the stomach totally

1402
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:56,480
important to know let's get working on

1403
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:59,280
this let's drop some pattaya in there

1404
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:00,720
so i got the dragon fruit right there

1405
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:04,319

00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:28,160
let's do that right

1413
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:30,079
i think we're ready i think that's the

1414
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:35,359
liver rescue smoothie

1415
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:38,559

1417
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:49,839
got it blending up right now you guys

1418
00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:58,240
envy doom says aw can you use prickly

1419
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:01,599
pear instead of

1420
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:03,839
pattaya uh

1421
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:03,839
no

1422
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:09,040
don't use prickly pear instead of

1423
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:10,000
pattaya and be mindful about prickly

1424
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:12,400
pear

1425
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,240
self-limiting extremely self-limiting

1426
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:17,839
keep be mindful on that one

1427
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:20,960
okay i like prickly pear i do

1428
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:22,079
right but it's self-limiting it's

1429
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:24,079
dehydrating

1430
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:26,160
just letting you know very dehydrating

1431
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:28,160
so when you have prickly pear

1432
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:29,440
like it's never been a no-no i've never

1433
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:32,160
said a no on it

1434
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,720
right you've never heard me say no on it

1435
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:34,480
but

1436
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:36,559
it's just a little reminder try not to

1437
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:37,119
tank it try not to tank that prickly

1438
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:40,160
pear

1439
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:42,160
take that prickly pear you're it you'll

1440
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:44,559
get some dehydration going on

1441
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:45,359
you might even get the runs but it's

1442
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:48,240
runs

1443
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:49,200
on the opposite end of the scale which

1444
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:51,839
is runs

1445
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:54,160
not from detox from the prickly pear but

1446
00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:55,200
runs from the hydration from prickly

1447
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:58,559
pear

1448
00:56:55,200 --> 00:57:03,280
but yeah i still like

1449
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:06,160

i say boom okay we've got

1465
00:57:56,319 --> 00:58:00,559
we got some more to do let's turn on the

1466
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:03,599
griddle

1467
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:06,480
let's get the griddle on

1468
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:08,960
griddle's on let's go more to talk about

1469
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:12,400
okay i'm just focused on

1470
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:13,680
not knocking crap over and breaking

1471
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:16,000
stuff right now

1472
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:17,920
so i'm just focused on making sure i'm

1473
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,839
not

1474
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:21,280
dropping a whole bottle of juice or

1475
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:23,599
something down

1476
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:25,359
if you need a heavy heavier meal you

1477
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:28,880
could do steamed potatoes winter squash

1478
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:31,920
sweet potatoes millet oatmeal

1479
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:34,960
you can do oatmeal now oatmeal is high

1480
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:36,960
it's higher in fat okay

1481
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:39,200
that's oatmeal right here right it is

1482
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:40,640
higher in fat but you're not adding fat

1483
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:42,559
to it

1484
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:44,160
it's higher in fat but you're not adding

1485
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:46,640
fat to it

1486
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:48,079
so you can still do some cleansing with

1487
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:49,440
a medical medium morning cleanse if

1488
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:51,119
you're an oatmeal person and it's

yeah gluten-free oats

1578
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:25,920
oatmeal is an option if you're somebody

1579
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,160
that can handle grains

1580
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:29,920
keep that in mind you're somebody that's

1581
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:30,799
that's okay with grains they can handle

1582
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:34,880
grains

1583
01:02:30,799 --> 01:02:36,319
oatmeal is an option gluten grains

1584
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:39,440
are what you want to use it's

1585
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:42,640
gluten-free grains

1586
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:42,640
that's what you want to use

1587
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:50,799
okay if you're somebody that's not

1588
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:52,720
trying to

1589
01:02:50,799 --> 01:02:54,160
if you're somebody that's not trying to

1590
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:55,839
heal at all

1591
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:58,000
it's still the best grains to use it's

1592
01:02:55,839 --> 01:03:00,480
millet that's your number one best grain

1593
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:02,240
oatmeal is your second best grain if

1594
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:04,400
you're somebody not trying to heal

1595
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:05,440
and then you can put your nut milks on

1596
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:06,880
there if you're somebody that's not

1597
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:08,319
trying to heal or cleanse you put nut

1598
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:09,200
milk you put nut butters if that's what

1599
01:03:08,319 --> 01:03:11,839
you want to do

1600
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:16,240
but i recommend not doing it i recommend

1601
01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:17,920
there's plenty of fat in oatmeal

1602
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:20,559
if you're somebody that wants to heal

1603
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:24,319
you can still cleanse

1604
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:27,119
and do oatmeal and millet

1605
01:03:24,319 --> 01:03:28,839
just keep the fats out keep the fats out

1606
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:33,440
so you can still cleanse

1607
01:03:28,839 --> 01:03:35,440
okay so this is almost cooked

1608
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:36,480
so some people like their oatmeal really

1609
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:38,160
really creamy

1610
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:40,480
they dump all this nut milk in there

1611
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:43,440
they make it basically like an oatmeal

1612
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:46,079
soup i don't like it that way personally

1613
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:48,079
that's not my style

1614
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:49,359
i like it really thick that's just the

1615
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:50,640
way i like to do it

1616
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:52,640
so i'm going to add some blueberries in

1617
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:54,559
the oatmeal it's cooking right

1618
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:58,160
right up right now i'm going to add some

1619
01:03:54,559 --> 01:04:02,559
wild blueberries

1620
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:02,559
you can cleanse and still have this

1621
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:07,520
in the morning isn't it interesting

1622
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:12,559
putting a few more in here there you go

1623
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:13,280
you can cleanse and still have this in

1624
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:16,400
the morning

1625
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:18,799
the reason why you'll cleanse

1626
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:19,440
is because you don't have the almonds in

1627
01:04:18,799 --> 01:04:21,200
there

1628
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:23,039
you don't have the peanut butter in

1629
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:24,480
there you don't have that in there you

1630
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:27,039
don't have the nut milks in there

1631
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:30,000
now you can cleanse so you can have the

1632
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:31,440
oatmeal if that's what you want

1633
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,119
you want to get the best out of a

1634
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:33,680
cleanse in the morning you do the lemon

1635
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:36,000
water

1636
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:37,520
or lime water you do the celery juice

1637
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,599
you do the liver rescue smoothie or the

1638
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:43,280
heavy metal detox smoothie or both

1639
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:44,640
both you do your you add additional 16

1640
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:47,200
ounces of water or

1641
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:49,520
coconut water right you do it all before

1642
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,520
noon

1643
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:58,799
that's your best option right there

1644
01:04:55,359 --> 01:05:00,319
that's your best option for cleansing

1645
01:04:58,799 --> 01:05:03,119
but you but if you're somebody that

1646
01:05:00,319 --> 01:05:04,799
needs something like a steamed potato

1647
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:06,480
don't put the fats on and you'll still

1648
01:05:04,799 --> 01:05:08,559

1854
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:23,199
because you're not going to cleanse if

1855
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:24,719
you have those in the morning it's not

1856
01:14:23,199 --> 01:14:29,840
going to happen

1857
01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:29,840
this is just the way it works

1858
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:33,840
if you have a bagel and cream cheese or

1859
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:35,199
a bagel

1860
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:37,199
in butter in the morning you're not

1861
01:14:35,199 --> 01:14:38,719
going to cleanse

1862
01:14:37,199 --> 01:14:40,640
instead you're just going to get insulin

1863
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:42,000
resistance it's another thing that

1864
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:43,440
happens when everybody puts fat

1865
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:45,360
in their diet in the morning they just

1866
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:47,199
continue with their insulin resistance

1867
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:50,320
worsen it and worsen and worsen over

1868
01:14:47,199 --> 01:14:53,520
time that's what they do

1869
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:53,520
all these things are important

1870
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:59,679
one of the reasons why the medical

1871
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,679
meeting morning cleanse has to be done

1872
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:05,440
is you'll save your bones you'll save

1873
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:08,320
your teeth

1874
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:10,239
because you'll cleanse acids out of your

1875
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:12,719
bloodstream every single morning

1876
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:14,800
as the night goes on your bloodstream is

1877
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:17,520
filled with acid

1878
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:19,280
it's filled with all kinds of acid it's

1879
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:22,000
filled with

1880
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:22,880
all kinds of toxins and poisons but real

1881
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:26,000
acidy

1882
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:27,760
toxins and poisons okay dr faun md good

1883
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:30,800
to see you

1884
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:32,719
so what happens is is that when you do

1885
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:34,239
your when you wake up in the morning and

1886
01:15:32,719 --> 01:15:36,320
you don't cleanse

1887
01:15:34,239 --> 01:15:38,480
or give your body a chance to clean out

1888
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:41,120
and cleanse

1889
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:41,840
you end up losing a little bit of a part

1890
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:45,199
of yourself

1891
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:47,199
every day you lose your own bones they

1892
01:15:45,199 --> 01:15:49,120
all slowly dissolve

1893
01:15:47,199 --> 01:15:51,520
that's why when we get older we get the

1894
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:53,360
osteopenia osteoporosis we lose our

1895
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:55,600
teeth our skull fracture is easy our

1896
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:57,280
hips break and fracture easy

1897
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:58,880
when you get older everything just

1898
01:15:57,280 --> 01:16:01,199
starts breaking because

1899
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:02,800
we had years of never cleansing no one

1900
01:16:01,199 --> 01:16:06,080
ever cleanses

1901
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:08,080
so acids cause calcium to leach

1902
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:09,600
if you don't cleanse the acid out every

1903
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:12,159
single morning

1904
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:13,679
the calcium will leech out of your bones

1905
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:16,640
you see how it works you guys

1906
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:16,640
see how critical this is

1907
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:26,640
very important to know how it works okay

1908
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:29,600
so every single day all night long

1909
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:29,600
your skeleton

1910
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:35,040
your skeletal system is begging to get

1911
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:37,440
rid of those acids

1912
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:39,840
every single day begging to get rid of

1913
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:43,040
those acids

1914
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:46,880
and so cleansing in the morning

1915
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:48,320
doing your lemon water your celery juice

1916
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:50,239

okay and i believe in meditation

1946
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:55,280
meditation is powerful there's medical

1947
01:17:53,199 --> 01:17:57,440
media meditations all in the books

1948
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:58,719
but meditation and deep breathing

1949
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:01,920
doesn't

1950
01:17:58,719 --> 01:18:04,400
fix chronic illness it doesn't

1951
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:06,719
i wish it did but it doesn't fix chronic

1952
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:09,199
illness because it won't get the poisons

1953
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:10,159
out of your liver it won't get the

1954
01:18:09,199 --> 01:18:11,600
viruses out

1955
01:18:10,159 --> 01:18:13,760
it won't get the epstein bar out of your

1956
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:15,120
system you can deep breathe all you want

1957
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:16,080
you can deep breathe all you want and i

1958
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:17,760
love deep breath

1959
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:20,159
deep breathing you can deep breathe all

1960
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:23,920
you want you can meditate all you want

1961
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:23,920
that's that heals your soul

1962
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:28,320
so what i love about meditation is you

1963
01:18:26,719 --> 01:18:29,520
heal your soul you heal your

1964
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:33,199
metaphysical you

1965
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:35,600
heal your subconsciousness you repair

1966
01:18:33,199 --> 01:18:37,120
you repair the emotional center of your

1967
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:41,840
brain

1968
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:44,000
that's why meditation is so critical

1969
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:46,000
but if you got like multiple sclerosis

1970
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,679
and you got trigeminal neuralgia and you

1971
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:49,360
got chronic fibromyalgia and you got

1972
01:18:47,679 --> 01:18:51,199
severe neurological fatigue and you got

1973
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:53,040
lupus and you got neurological lyme

1974

and you got hashimoto's thyronitis you

1975
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:56,400
can deep breath all you want

1976
01:18:58,159 --> 01:19:02,719
it's different i get it some people be

1977
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:04,159
like oh i healed from all that deep

1978
01:19:02,719 --> 01:19:06,239

out there because i healed from it

1982
01:19:10,239 --> 01:19:15,520
because of my car accident what you got

1983
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:16,960
from your car accident you had surgeons

1984
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:18,880
work on you you had

1985
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:20,080
you had orthopedic doctors work on you

1986
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:23,520
you had massage

1987
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:25,440
five times a week

1988
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:27,120
because i've seen this out there i've

1989
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:28,800
seen some people who are on the scene

1990
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:29,840
and they're like lecturing and lecturing

1991
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:31,520
and they're talking about how

1992
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:32,800
their meditation healed them from a car

1993
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:33,360
accident i'm like you know what i'm

1994
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:36,640
sorry but

1995
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:37,760
actually from what i recollect you had

1996
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:39,920
massage

1997
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:41,600
five times a week coming to your house

1998
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:43,360
and you had orthopedic surgeons and you

1999
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:45,440
had doctors and you were you were

2000
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:46,960
you had nuts and bolts put into you and

2001
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:48,320
you were put you were glued together

2002
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:51,840
after your car accident you're trying to

2003
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:51,840
tell me that your meditation did that

2004
01:19:57,679 --> 01:20:02,320
yeah the way

2005
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:04,159
here's how it works with meditation

2006
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:05,840
which i love it's really a powerful tool

2007
01:20:04,159 --> 01:20:07,600
meditation heals the soul

2008
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:09,199
and her soul can be fractured your soul

2009
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:10,400
you can get the betrayal and you can get

2010
01:20:09,199 --> 01:20:12,080
all that

2011
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:14,480
but meditation is not going to remove

2012
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:15,920
the acid out of your bloodstream you

2013
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:18,239
have to cleanse that so i just

2014
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:19,679
the reason why i go into this topic

2015
01:20:18,239 --> 01:20:21,679
because someone's going to say i don't

2016
01:20:19,679 --> 01:20:25,679
need to cleanse

2017
01:20:21,679 --> 01:20:27,600
i don't need a cleanse aw

2018
01:20:25,679 --> 01:20:29,280
i can just i can just do some deep

2019
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:30,480
breathing and meditation and i can fix

2020
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:31,840
my problems

2021
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:33,440

2023

2024
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:37,199
cleanse

2025
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:40,000
you can't get the toxic heavy metals out

2026
01:20:37,199 --> 01:20:40,000
with meditation

2027
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:47,840
you can't you can't get

2028
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:51,520

01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:53,920
of your condition you can't get copper

2030

01:20:56,159 --> 01:21:00,800
it's just

2033
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:02,239
the lay of the land medical medium

2034
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:04,159
information has a street cred where

2035
01:21:02,239 --> 01:21:07,280

2093
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:10,639
neurological lyme thinking that it was

2094
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:12,400
all in their head and they just needed

i just medical meme information is about

2128
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:21,760
being real

2129
01:24:19,199 --> 01:24:23,360
straight up it's truth it's why people

2130
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:25,280
heal around the world

2131
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:27,280
and if i was going to tell you that you

2132
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:28,480
can meditate your mercury out of your

2133
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:31,199
brain

2134
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:32,880
not only would that be such a disservice

2135
01:24:31,199 --> 01:24:36,320
it'd be dastardly

2136
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:36,320
miss herbs it would just be terrible

2137
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:39,280
you got to do the heavy metal detox

2138
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,719
movie get the metals out of your brain

2139
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:42,400
and if you want to say a meditation

2140
01:24:40,719 --> 01:24:44,800
fixed you after you did the heavy metal

2141
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:46,159
detox movie and it got the metals out

2142
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:47,679
and you got better but you want to say

2143
01:24:46,159 --> 01:24:49,840
it was a meditation fine

2144
01:24:47,679 --> 01:24:51,520
but just you've got to make sure you get

2145
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:53,679
the metals out

2146
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:55,120
and you should credit what's getting it

2147
01:24:53,679 --> 01:24:57,840
out too it's just like

2148
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:59,120
heavy metal detox smoothie because if

2149
01:24:57,840 --> 01:25:00,400
you don't credit what's getting you

2150
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:02,480
better you end up hurting a bunch of

2151
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:03,920
people i've seen people out there

2152
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:06,080
and i've seen people out there and

2153
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:07,360
people have told me this too where

2154
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:09,280
they do medical medium they do the

2155
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:10,080
celery juice 16 to 32 ounces every

2156
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:12,239
single day

2157
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:14,080
they do the heavy metal detox movie

2158
01:25:12,239 --> 01:25:15,440
right they learn how to heal and what

2159
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:17,120
foods to stay away from

2160
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:18,639
they heal and then they say it was a

2161
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:21,120
meditation somebody somebody's

2162
01:25:18,639 --> 01:25:23,199
meditation that did it

2163
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:24,639
so then that other person says it was so

2164
01:25:23,199 --> 01:25:25,360
then they go do that somebody else's

2165
01:25:24,639 --> 01:25:26,639
meditation

2166
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:28,080
and then they don't know about the heavy

2167
01:25:26,639 --> 01:25:29,920
metal detox smoothie they don't know

2168
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:31,679
about the celery juice and they just go
