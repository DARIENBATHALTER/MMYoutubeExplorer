00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,519
I've already thrown my stones in earlier

00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:18,060
today

7
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:19,140
and but I found a stranded turtle on the

8
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,420
road

9
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,720
and it was drying up and it had nowhere

10
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:27,660
to go and I've been Reviving it today

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,500
before I got a chance to take it to a

12
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,000
pond

13
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,399
and so

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,700
I've been giving it a little chance I've

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,620
been keeping it out of the Heat and Sun

16
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:41,100
giving it a little bit of water

17
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:43,079
some grass and vegetation and then now

18
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,700
I'm ready to let this little baby turtle

19
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,460
go it's a mud turtle so they don't get

20
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,600
really big but this is a very small

21
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,579
turtle

22
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,340
I don't think they grow more than a few

23
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:55,570
inches past this
