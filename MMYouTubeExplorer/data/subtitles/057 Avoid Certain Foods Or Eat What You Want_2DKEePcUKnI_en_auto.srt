99
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:49,320

101
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:55,240

you say something bad about food people

109
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,880

110
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:20,280
you don't eat you won't exist we have to

111
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,880
eat in order to sustain ourselves to

112
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:25,319

113
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,319
brain to feed our heart we have to

chronically ill they're not holding a

234
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,360
packaged food item that's filled with

235
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,880
chemicals because they're really

236
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,959
concerned that you're going to get that

237
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:26,880
chemical in your body and it's going to

238
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:28,720

when you're hardly sick and it's kind of

242
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,079
fun just getting rid of some processed

243
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:38,680
foods eating better doing some

244
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:40,959
meditation doing some yoga changing your

245
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:43,240
lifestyle for the better and if you're

246
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:45,800
not so sick and you only have some mild

247
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:47,279
symptoms that come and go or go away

248
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,639
completely because you got rid of the

249
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,079
processed foods and you're taking care

250
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:52,480

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,600
really an expert because there's a big

256
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,320
difference a very big difference from

257
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:09,560
being not so sick and being really sick

258
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:12,079
and being seasoned with that trying

259
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:14,720
everything been there done that lots of

260
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:17,800
doctors been sick a long time tried

261
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:20,839
virtually almost everything and being

262
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:22,639
not so sick getting rid of One symptom

263
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:25,279
eating better taking care of yourself in

264
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:27,040
general symptom comes and goes you feel

stronger more confident feel like you

266
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,360
know health and wellness big big

267
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:34,800
difference right there two different

268
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:38,079
worlds two different worlds completely

269
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:40,240
The Not So Sick and the very very sick a

270
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:42,839
sick person who's been around the block

271
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,639
knows a thing or two they know what

272
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:46,480
works for them what doesn't work for

273
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:49,040
them at that point especially if they've

274
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,279
been in it for years and they also know

275
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,880
when they find something that makes

276
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:55,720
sense and actually works and they can

277
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,200
feel it and they're moving forward in

278
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:00,160
their life and they're getting rid of

279
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,240
some symptoms shedding me maybe even 10

280
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:05,120
symptoms they know they got something

281
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,440
it's gold and they've been on a search

282
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,720
long and hard for many years so when

283
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,639
they find that thing they hold on to it

284
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,440
they hold on to it with conviction

285
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:16,240
because they know it is saving them and

286
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,600
then they're not so sick that are

287
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,320
playing around with all kinds of

288
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,839
different foods they're looking out for

289
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,600
some of the bad stuff they're looking

290
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:24,720
out for some of the good stuff they're

291
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,360
trying different things they feel

292
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,199
something might be helping them they

293
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,560
feel something might not be helping them

294
00:12:28,199 --> 00:12:32,800
but until they're really sick will they

295
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:36,000
ever have that conviction will they ever

296
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:38,160
really know and have that inner truth

297
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,160
what happens is The Not So Sick will

298
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:43,279
just play games try this and try that do

299
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:46,160
this and do that and they'll just EB and

300
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:48,240
flow and they'll go along for the ride

301
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:51,320
they're not that sick they can do it

302
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,880
until the scale tips someday and they go

303
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:56,320
downward and then they're like oh my God

304
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:58,920
those things aren't helping me anymore

305
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,839
but until that downfall happens until

306
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:03,959
they hit that rock bottom or head down

307
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:06,079
to that direction they sit up here way

308
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:08,040
up and they're just like yeah I know

309
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,639
what I'm doing I'm going to tell you how

310
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:12,440
to heal I'm going to tell you how to

311
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:14,959
take care of yourself the thing is I've

312
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:17,839
seen this thousands and thousands and

313
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:21,000
thousands of times I've seen people play

314
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:24,040
around up there being not so sick and

315
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,959
then the scale tip and then they go

316
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:29,480
downwards and they're getting humbled

317
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:31,440
takes a little time doesn't happen fast

318
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:33,839
depends on the entitlement or who they

319
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,839
are or where they come from or their

320
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,839
resources and when they start heading

321
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,760
down and they're like weit a minute

322
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,880
something isn't changing I'm really

323
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:45,760
stuck down here I don't feel good then

324
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,800
The Humbling starts to happen and then

325
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,160
they come knocking on a door cuz they

326
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:52,440
already knocked on 50 other doors and

327
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,600
they're still sick they knock on a door

328
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,440
and they're like you know what I like

329
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:59,680
what you're talking about I need some

330
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:02,279
answers these look like real answers so

331
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:05,360
let's Jump Ahead let's put aside food

332
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:08,160
chemicals let's put aside fast food and

333
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,680
greasy fried foods let's put aside

334
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,279
processed foods say you're somebody and

335
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,040
you're already pass that you're not

336
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:16,240
doing any of that or you believe you're

337
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:19,040
not doing any of that maybe some slips

338
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:21,680
in by default but you're trying to

339
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:25,079
really avoid that in your life you're

340
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:27,519
wise but you're still sick and you're

341
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:29,560
not getting fully better and you're

342
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:32,000
avoiding virtually

343
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:35,680
most of that or all of that and whatever

344
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:39,600
your sickness is inflammation is playing

345
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:41,480
a role you've heard that before inflamed

346
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,800
inflammation and the other thing that's

347
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:46,600
playing a role is immune system weakened

348
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,560
immune system and

349
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:51,120
inflammation but what does that mean in

350
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,320
the end if you go to a practitioner or

351
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,680
healthc care provider or a medical

352
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,320
professional and they say you're

353
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:58,639
inflamed or you have some form of

354
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,759
inflammation or markers are up and

355
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,920
you're inflamed in some way and they say

356
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:05,079
well you either got autoimmune or you

357
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:07,360
have some form of inflammation

358
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:09,040
something's going on here your Ana is

359
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,959
high your markers are high whatever it

360
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:14,839
may be whatever test you did what's the

361
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:18,600
answer in the end where's the

362
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:23,120
answers because it comes down to this

363
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:27,519
pathogens and metals bugs and

364
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:29,600
toxins viruses bacteria and poisons

365
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,920
toxins and metals

366
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,240
pathogens create this inflammation

367
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:37,839
that's inside of people's bodies mystery

368
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:40,199
chronic illness pathogens love toxins

369
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,880
and metals and feed off of toxins and

370
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:43,639
metals and then that also Spurs on lots

371
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,040
of

372
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:48,639
inflammation pathogens eat the toxins

373
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:51,120
and the poisons and the metals and then

374
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:54,120
they excrete the poison out of their

375
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:57,319
little viral cells and pathogen cells

376
00:15:54,120 --> 00:16:00,279
but pathogens also eat other things they

377
00:15:57,319 --> 00:16:02,160
eat Foods because this is one of the

378
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:05,680
biggest and most important missing links

379
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:08,639
here it's what feeds pathogens food that

380
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:11,360
pathogens like so it's not about being

381
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:13,399
the food police out there don't eat this

382
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:17,519
and don't eat that it's about having

383
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:19,920
real reason to not eat this or that when

384
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:22,720
you have a chronic illness there's a

385
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:25,319
reason to avoid a certain food it's not

386
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,759
just about shaming somebody about a food

387
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:29,959
or saying you shouldn't eat all that you

388
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:32,560
shouldn't eat a loaf of bread and a

389
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:34,319
stick of butter every day it's not about

390
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,240
that because there's people out there

391
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:38,319
that can eat a loaf of bread every day

392
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,959
and a stick of butter and they may not

393
00:16:38,319 --> 00:16:43,319
have the same inflammation as somebody

394
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:45,160
else who's eating pretty good because

395
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:47,399
they may not have the pathogens that

396
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:51,040
somebody else has they may not have the

397
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:52,920
viruses and the bacteria so when they're

398
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,920
eating a loaf of bread and a stick of

399
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:59,040
butter it may not be feeding the same

400
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:01,240
pathogens that someone else has and

401
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,880
let's face it if anybody's trying to eat

402
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:05,439
healthy that's because something's wrong

403
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,880
because why would they just give up all

404
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,360
the pizza they wanted and all the

405
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,600
macaroni and cheese and all the

406
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:12,839
cheeseburgers and all the ice cream and

407
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:15,559
all the milkshakes why would they just

408
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:17,600
give that up they're either sick or they

409
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:20,000
want to look a certain way it's either

410
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:22,439
one or the other and looking a certain

411
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,400
way may not be enough motivation because

412
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:27,240
you'll still have your cheat days and so

413
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:30,520
forth as time goes on and pathogens

414
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:33,039
don't discriminate pathogens don't say

415
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:35,799
well those are children those are

416
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:38,039
teenagers those are young adults those

417
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:41,720
are people in their 30s those are people

418
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:44,240
in their 40s hm let's see let's not be a

419
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:46,400
pathogen in an 8-year-old let's only be

420
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,000
a pathogen in a 50-year-old it doesn't

421
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,360
work that way that's why there's a lot

422
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,960
of sick kids pathogens all kinds of

423
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:55,240
different bugs pathogens like viruses

424
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,919
and bacteria will be in children they'll

425
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,799
be in teenagers they'll be in young

426
00:17:56,919 --> 00:18:02,440
adults they'll be in anybody anywhere

427
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:05,000
anyhow there's no discrimination they're

428
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:08,120
just in everyone at any time and the

429
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,760
same thing happens pathogens and toxins

430
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:14,120
creating inflammation pathogens and

431
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:16,760
metals creating inflammation so when it

432
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:20,600
comes down to avoiding a food there

433
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:23,720
needs to be a reason like seriously a

434
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:27,039
very important reason to avoid a certain

435
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:31,080
food and that important reason is to not

436
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:34,120
feed a bug because foods can feed bugs

437
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:37,120
pathogens viruses and bacteria Epstein

438
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:42,280
bar shingles hhv6

439
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:46,159
hhv7 undiscovered hhv 10 through 16 hsv1

440
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:48,679
hsv2 the herpes simplexes sedam virus

441
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:55,520
and many more many mutations many

442
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:57,760
different strains strep staff CI hpylori

443
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,919
anything and different bugs have

444
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:02,600
different appetites they like different

445
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,559
foods for different reasons for one

446
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:07,200
thing a bug might have been in somebody

447
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:08,640
else before you caught that bug a bug

448
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,200
might have been sitting in somebody else

449
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,640
and then eating a diet that that

450
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:16,200
somebody else fed that bug and that bug

451
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:18,640
has been used to that very diet and then

452
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:21,559
that bug gets contracted into somebody

453
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,559
else someone actually gets that bug

454
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:25,880
maybe they drank off of somebody's glass

455
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:28,240
maybe they shared a bodily fluid or

456
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,880
maybe off of a shopping cart handle you

457
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,640
touch the handle then you put your

458
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:35,200
finger in your eyee and then you got a

459
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:37,799
bug and that bug has a history it has a

460
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,280
past bugs have a past when they come

461
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:42,919
from other people they had a different

462
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:45,760
diet different foods so maybe you were

463
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:48,120
fine eating corn you've been eating corn

464
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:52,880
every year you eat corn in different

465
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:55,880
ways corn flour tortilla chips corn off

466
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:58,480
the cob you eat frozen corn any kind of

467
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:01,240
corn cornbread and everything's fine and

468
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:05,039
then then a bug you picked up recently

469
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:07,720
some exposure that had a corn diet from

470
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:09,640
another person is now in you and now

471
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:11,120
you're eating corn and you're eating

472
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:13,120
corn and you're eating corn and

473
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,000
something's changing you're not feeling

474
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,640
good you're getting sicker something's

475
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,600
wrong and you don't even know it but

476
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:22,039
that bug is feasting off of that corn

477
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:24,919
and eliminating toxins growing

478
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:27,080
proliferating getting stronger and

479
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:29,000
you're getting weaker you might be a

480
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:30,679
person that always did good with glut

481
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,080
you saw everybody else wasn't doing good

482
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:34,039
with gluten you hear about it all the

483
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,640
time you see gluten-free products

484
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:41,039
everywhere and you could eat plain old

485
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:43,520
straight Pizza glutened in bread anytime

486
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:46,559
you want and everything's fine and then

487
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,960
one day all of a sudden you get a bug

488
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:52,640
you catch somebody else's bug maybe it's

489
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:55,520
a strap you catch that strap loves to

490
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,760
Feast on gluten and that strap was in

491
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:00,240
somebody else's body and it was feasting

492
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:03,480
on gluten all the time and reproducing

493
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,440
itself and wreaking havoc UTI all the

494
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:08,880
time bladder infections kidney

495
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:12,279
infections St conjunctivitis lung

496
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:14,039
infections sore throats ear infections

497
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:17,159
all kinds of different headaches and so

498
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:19,240
forth and that strep was flying high and

499
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:22,240
it was feeding off of that gluten and

500
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:24,640
now that strep bug got into you somehow

501
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:27,120
maybe you kissed somebody maybe you just

502
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,520
caught it somewhere somehow on a public

503
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,679
toilet seat but you have it in you and

504
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,600
it's feasting on gluten and that was

505
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:36,320
never a problem before before instead

506
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:38,480
now you're like wait a minute

507
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,559
something's wrong I feel a little bit

508
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,799
better getting off of gluten am I one of

509
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:45,159
those people now where I have to be off

510
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:47,360
of gluten and yeah you have to be off of

511
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:50,520
gluten and maybe you're somebody that

512
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:52,880
does great with eggs can eat eggs every

513
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:54,720
day two eggs every single day could have

514
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,039
them boiled fried you could have them on

515
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,120
your salads you can have them scrambled

516
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:01,240
you can have any form of egg you can

517
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,960
have it in bread you can have it

518
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:06,320
anywhere anyhow you do good with eggs

519
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:08,400
you've been eating them for years and

520
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,360
then you're getting sick and sick and

521
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,720
sicker because you caught a bug maybe

522
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:15,600
you caught an Epstein bar virus maybe

523
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,799
it's your Epstein bar virus that

524
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,559
suddenly was awakened because your

525
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:23,080
immune system just broke down and some

526
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:25,840
triggers occurred and other exposures

527
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:28,240
and then boom immune system weakened and

528
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:31,120
then an Epstein bar came out of a dormy

529
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:34,000
that's been there forever and as it gets

530
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:36,480
up and strong and grows it's feeding off

531
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,640
those eggs for the first time in all

532
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,840
these years and something starts to

533
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,520
change and then you're in a public

534
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:45,880
bathroom you sit on a toilet seat you

535
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:48,720
actually eliminate in the toilet the

536
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:51,279
splash goes right up into the rectum and

537
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:55,240
in that Splash was a different Epstein

538
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:57,240
bar virus got into you it's now in you

539
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:59,880
it's not going to leave you it's going

540
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:01,440
to percolate it's going to do its thing

541
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:04,520
and you start getting sick and that

542
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:09,039
Epstein bar virus had a different diet

543
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:11,840
it loved dairy products milk cheese and

544
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:14,320
butter and that Epstein bar virus that

545
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,880
was in another person that was eating a

546
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:19,720
lot of milk cheese and butter wasn't

547
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,960
used to or eating goat's milk or goat's

548
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:24,080
cheese and that person that has this

549
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:27,320
virus now that's feeding off of milk

550
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:29,320
cheese and butter is shying away over

551
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:31,880
time from milk cheese and butter and

552
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:33,559
starting to gravitate to other options

553
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,480
because they're hearing people say well

554
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:37,279
if you don't feel good get off the milk

555
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:40,000
get off the dairy and you should try

556
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:42,360
goats milk or goats cheese and they end

557
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,520
up feeling a little bit better they do

558
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:46,520
okay and they're like wo I like goat

559
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:48,760
cheese that's what I eat and that's what

560
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:51,919
I like and I seem to do better with it

561
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:55,400
until that epine bar over time says I'm

562
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:57,960
hungry and I need some Dairy so it

563
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:00,480
starts to actually go towards the goat

564
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:02,679
cheese and the goat milk and then you're

565
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,960
somebody with a shingles virus maybe it

566
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:06,960
was dormant for years maybe you picked

567
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,120
up a shingles virus very easily from

568
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:12,640
somebody else somehow and that shingles

569
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:15,080
virus had a diet in somebody else that

570
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,760
was actually eggs somebody else ate a

571
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:20,080
lot of eggs they had a shingles flare up

572
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:22,440
continuously they had maybe multiple

573
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,440
shingles viruses and those shingles

574
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:27,919
viruses were used to eating eggs for a

575
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:29,720
long time and maybe you ate eggs and

576
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:33,000
everything was fine but this other

577
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:34,880
person they got away from eggs they got

578
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,640
away from other things too because they

579
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,360
were kind of figuring out whoo this

580
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,720
doesn't work for me this does work for

581
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:42,640
me because they were so inflamed for so

582
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,399
long with these shingles viruses but

583
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,279
you've been eating eggs all this time

584
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:48,720
and you've been doing okay with them and

585
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:50,679
you feel confident that the eggs work

586
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,720
for you and then you get this new

587
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:57,919
shingles virus it's in you now and it's

588
00:24:53,720 --> 00:25:01,080
feeding on the eggs same goes with soy

589
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:03,760
soy can feed pathogens too genetically

590
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:06,200
altered soy can actually feed some

591
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,720
pathogens so if somebody's loaded with

592
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,760
some kind of pathogen and they're eating

593
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:11,520
a lot of soy same thing can happen or

594
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:15,960
they get a pathogen from somebody else

595
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:18,200
who ate a lot of soy GMO soy and then

596
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:20,159
boom they were eating soy too that

597
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,960
pathogen's like whoa this is the food I

598
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,720
like this is the food I want and when

599
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,919
someone gets extra inflamed out of

600
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,799
nowhere because they're eating that soy

601
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,640
if they could line it up and match it up

602
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:31,159
cuz a lot of people can some people

603
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:33,279
don't know what's bothering them they

604
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:35,919
don't know what food's triggering them

605
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:38,080
but some people do and they're like whoa

606
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,480
I think I'm going to back down the soy

607
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,960
for a while and now they're feeling a

608
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:43,159
little bit better but what's really

609
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:46,000
happening is they're starving the

610
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:48,320
pathogen they're starving the virus

611
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,279
medical medium information is about

612
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,399
customizing a protocol for you taking

613
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:56,039
your health as far as you want to go so

614
00:25:53,399 --> 00:25:58,480
when you learn that gluten feeds bugs

615
00:25:56,039 --> 00:26:01,840
say you got an H pylori say you have or

616
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:04,399
two streps and they eat gluten and that

617
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:06,559
gluten is feeding them creating

618
00:26:04,399 --> 00:26:09,520
inflammation then you could rid that

619
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:13,080
gluten and see what happens and you're

620
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:14,880
starving one or two varieties of bugs

621
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:17,440
same thing if you take eggs out of your

622
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:20,679
diet you're taking the eggs away from

623
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:24,559
the pathogens viruses like shingles and

624
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:27,559
Epstein bar love eggs so when you remove

625
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:29,799
the eggs those bugs don't have a food

626
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:32,039
that they love and eat every day

627
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:34,840
essentially you're starving the bugs

628
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:36,559
starving them out of your body they die

629
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,159
if they don't have the food they need

630
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:40,799
it's a great way of getting rid of so

631
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:43,200
many bugs many people use the medical

632
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:45,840
medum information to clean up all the

633
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:48,080
pathogens they learn about the foods

634
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:50,840
they get rid of the pathogens and then

635
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:53,520
they bring those Foods back in the eggs

636
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,799
or the gluten or dairy as time goes on

637
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,320
and they notice that they're actually

638
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:58,520
able to eat it they're not getting

639
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,840
inflamed and they're okay but

640
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:03,720
everybody's different so many people

641
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:06,559
have different toxins poisons metals and

642
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:08,720
different bugs and pathogens some people

643
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:11,080
have two or three different viruses some

644
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:13,480
people will have 10 different strains of

645
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:15,080
viruses some people will have five

646
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,840
different viruses or they'll have

647
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:19,600
bacteria as well and there'll be

648
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:22,679
different levels of bugs some aggressive

649
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:24,760
some very mild so they have to customize

650
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:26,200
protocol for what they need because

651
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:28,399
they're different than somebody else

652
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:30,600
who's sick they have the option of

653
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:33,640
taking out one of the foods that feeds

654
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:35,000
bugs or take all of them out the

655
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:37,679
difference with medical medium

656
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,080
information then what's out there is

657
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,799
that it's not one siiz fits-all it's one

658
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,279
siiz fits-all out there in so many

659
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:46,240
different ways in the end it comes down

660
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:47,880
to just one size fits-all but with

661
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,679
medical medium information you can

662
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:53,039
customize it to what you need for where

663
00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:55,120
you are at you can take it as far as you

664
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:57,519
