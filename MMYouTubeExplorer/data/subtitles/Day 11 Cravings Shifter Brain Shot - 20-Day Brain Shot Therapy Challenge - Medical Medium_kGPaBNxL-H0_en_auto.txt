[47.58 - 51.18] talking about Cravings creating shifter
[49.38 - 53.16] we're talking about the moderation trap
[51.18 - 55.62] took some reading straight out of here
[53.16 - 57.00] brain saver just so you know I'm gonna
[55.62 - 58.86] read a little bit which is kind of
[57.00 - 61.62] exciting let's find the craving shifter
[58.86 - 63.56] of what we're going to be working on
[61.62 - 68.16] we're doing the craving shifter today
[63.56 - 69.66] mind blowing it is so powerful it is not
[68.16 - 71.10] a joke man when you do that craving
[69.66 - 75.72] shifter
[71.10 - 77.46] that thing shuts down Cravings like it
[75.72 - 80.46] just shuts them down it's really
[77.46 - 82.86] incredible it's a miracle
[80.46 - 85.50] I'm reading page 147 of the moderation
[82.86 - 87.78] trap inside brain saver if you guys want
[85.50 - 90.24] to hang out while I read a little bit
[87.78 - 93.30] it's pizza smells really good These
[90.24 - 95.66] Wings smell really good right here
[93.30 - 99.36] Heidi Inman said saving so much money
[95.66 - 101.94] not buying so you're not buying all the
[99.36 - 104.18] chocolate and all the coffee because I
[101.94 - 105.98] see some emojis there
[104.18 - 109.38] all right
[105.98 - 110.58] you guys know that why it's not good to
[109.38 - 113.64] eat eggs right
[110.58 - 115.74] you know vegans don't eat eggs
[113.64 - 118.98] for the moment when they're 100 vegan
[115.74 - 121.86] because they don't want to eat an animal
[118.98 - 124.32] product but they don't know why eggs are
[121.86 - 126.60] bad nobody knew why eggs were bad nobody
[124.32 - 128.34] in any health realm vegan or anywhere
[126.60 - 130.56] else eggs are bad because the medical
[128.34 - 132.60] medium information about eggs feeding
[130.56 - 134.46] pathogens inside the body dormant
[132.60 - 138.00] shingles virus dormant Epstein-Barr
[134.46 - 139.08] Dorman hhv6 dormant CMV all the
[138.00 - 142.38] different viruses especially
[139.08 - 145.62] Epstein-Barr feed on eggs we eat the
[142.38 - 148.02] eggs the viruses feed on the eggs and
[145.62 - 150.06] then release neurotoxins and the
[148.02 - 152.16] neurotoxins give everybody symptoms
[150.06 - 153.84] neurological symptoms which is all
[152.16 - 156.36] medical medium information nobody knew
[153.84 - 159.12] that either it's incredible really the
[156.36 - 160.56] contribution of spirit of compassion to
[159.12 - 161.70] the Alternative Health world and
[160.56 - 163.62] conventional Health world with this
[161.70 - 166.80] information that's why you don't eat
[163.62 - 168.66] eggs it's not because of other reasons
[166.80 - 170.40] like hey I'm vegan and I won't eat eggs
[168.66 - 172.56] even though vegans go back to eating
[170.40 - 174.18] eggs after they get sick eating vegan
[172.56 - 176.34] because they're not doing vegan the
[174.18 - 178.26] right way or whatever people just go
[176.34 - 180.90] back to eating eggs
[178.26 - 182.76] all right moderation trap right here in
[180.90 - 184.62] brain saver good to see you guys we're
[182.76 - 186.84] day at 11 brain shot therapy cleanse
[184.62 - 188.28] challenge moderation never works for
[186.84 - 191.28] anyone
[188.28 - 193.38] what what
[191.28 - 195.36] are you serious there's an IG comment
[193.38 - 197.76] here I'm about to read
[195.36 - 199.38] uh Madeline says oh and the craving
[197.76 - 202.38] shifter worked
[199.38 - 204.06] yeah it does work thank you for saying
[202.38 - 205.86] that because it really does it's
[204.06 - 208.08] powerful it's a powerful tool it's
[205.86 - 213.00] incredible it's unmatched for busting
[208.08 - 215.88] Cravings it's an instant craving Crusher
[213.00 - 221.06] is what it is it's incredible
[215.88 - 221.06] moderation never works for anyone what
[221.28 - 226.10] it's permission to do things that aren't
[223.38 - 226.10] great for us
[226.20 - 231.54] am I wrong or am I right
[228.48 - 234.62] is this wrong or is this right is SOC
[231.54 - 234.62] wrong or is SOC right
[235.20 - 238.98] it's permission to do things that aren't
[237.36 - 241.26] great for us
[238.98 - 244.02] right because that's what moderation is
[241.26 - 245.94] moderation the whole concept the whole
[244.02 - 247.80] understanding of it is to make sure we
[245.94 - 250.68] have permission to do things that just
[247.80 - 253.02] aren't good for us
[250.68 - 254.64] our physical body does not like
[253.02 - 257.64] moderation
[254.64 - 259.98] it doesn't I'm just gonna do these
[257.64 - 262.68] shrooms man and put in moderation I'm
[259.98 - 264.42] going to micro dose these this Ayahuasca
[262.68 - 267.72] just in moderation I'm gonna eat this
[264.42 - 271.80] chocolate bar in moderation man
[267.72 - 275.54] I'm on page Jane I'm on page 147
[271.80 - 275.54] in brain saver right here
[277.20 - 280.74] I'm gonna do these recreational drugs in
[279.30 - 283.70] moderation I'm gonna eat this chocolate
[280.74 - 283.70] cake in moderation
[283.86 - 289.26] yet our body is governed by our
[286.50 - 291.66] subconsciousness and Consciousness our
[289.26 - 294.24] body is under the control of our
[291.66 - 295.68] subconsciousness and Consciousness that
[294.24 - 297.84] part of that piece right there is just
[295.68 - 301.56] incredible when you think about it our
[297.84 - 304.50] body is under the control
[301.56 - 305.94] of our subconsciousness and
[304.50 - 310.50] consciousness
[305.94 - 314.12] that means if our Consciousness wants to
[310.50 - 317.76] eat in moderation or party in moderation
[314.12 - 320.88] then our body has to shut up
[317.76 - 322.92] sit down and take it
[320.88 - 324.24] that's what our body has to do
[322.92 - 326.28] if our Consciousness and
[324.24 - 328.74] subconsciousness wants to partake in
[326.28 - 332.34] moderation in any way it wants to
[328.74 - 335.22] partake in any kind of moderation
[332.34 - 339.30] whether it's wreck drugs
[335.22 - 341.22] prescription Pharmaceuticals whatever or
[339.30 - 343.74] Pizza
[341.22 - 345.12] chocolate cake whatever cacao
[343.74 - 347.90] our body
[345.12 - 351.78] has to just be like
[347.90 - 355.26] gotta do it got no choice
[351.78 - 358.16] your body has to shut up
[355.26 - 358.16] and take it
[358.68 - 363.18] so our body is governed by our
[360.60 - 365.76] subconsciousness and Consciousness our
[363.18 - 368.52] mind which can be injured or persuaded
[365.76 - 371.42] to want something our physical body
[368.52 - 371.42] doesn't want
[372.24 - 377.22] our Free Will is part of how we step
[374.76 - 379.86] outside the box in life we use our free
[377.22 - 382.26] will to step out of the box
[379.86 - 384.60] it's how we embark on trying to heal
[382.26 - 386.70] when we aren't being given any true
[384.60 - 388.68] answers so we don't have any answers go
[386.70 - 391.04] to the doctor we're sick we have no
[388.68 - 391.04] answers
[391.44 - 395.76] we go to a functional doctor and he says
[393.42 - 397.56] oh stay away from processed foods
[395.76 - 399.30] you do it you stay away from processed
[397.56 - 400.92] foods and you're still sick
[399.30 - 403.26] don't know why but you're still sick and
[400.92 - 405.84] don't have an answer
[403.26 - 408.06] and because of that our Free Will has
[405.84 - 409.20] this desire to be like we we use our
[408.06 - 411.24] free will
[409.20 - 413.76] our soul has this desire to get a free
[411.24 - 415.92] will to be like we need help we need
[413.76 - 419.00] help we need answers I don't want to be
[415.92 - 419.00] sick I need answers
[419.82 - 423.60] we can make two kinds of mistakes I'm
[422.34 - 425.22] interested in reading that I want to
[423.60 - 429.00] know what these mistakes are
[425.22 - 432.18] hm sounds 88 says yes what is wrong with
[429.00 - 434.06] cacao just really kills the adrenals it
[432.18 - 435.90] gives women hard
[434.06 - 439.20] childbirths like
[435.90 - 441.74] it because you're adrenals
[439.20 - 445.68] get clobbered when you're doing cacao
[441.74 - 448.08] clobbered so you're using them like a
[445.68 - 450.24] credit card you're using them you're
[448.08 - 452.46] using all your credit card power out of
[450.24 - 453.72] your adrenals so if you're if you're
[452.46 - 456.12] someone that's dealing with adrenal
[453.72 - 457.26] fatigue or any kind of adrenal issues
[456.12 - 459.84] you don't even know you're dealing with
[457.26 - 461.70] or kidney issues on any level that you
[459.84 - 463.80] don't even know you're dealing with
[461.70 - 466.20] or brain problems you don't know you're
[463.80 - 469.14] dealing with like nervous system issues
[466.20 - 470.82] cacao kills your nervous system because
[469.14 - 472.44] it jacks up the adrenaline the
[470.82 - 474.54] adrenaline floods into the brain and
[472.44 - 476.52] destroys nerve sheaths because
[474.54 - 478.98] adrenaline's so corrosis it's like
[476.52 - 481.44] corrosive you're taking adrenaline that
[478.98 - 483.00] you shouldn't be using you're creating a
[481.44 - 484.20] stimulation you're not supposed to be
[483.00 - 486.00] creating
[484.20 - 489.42] so it's a drug
[486.00 - 491.64] it's a cacao really prevents healing
[489.42 - 494.04] okay fine if you're not so sick and we
[491.64 - 495.96] just did a big talk about people who are
[494.04 - 498.18] not so sick they can play in any land
[495.96 - 500.28] they want I'm going to eat a whole
[498.18 - 503.82] ton of eggs I'm gonna eat all the cacao
[500.28 - 505.50] I want I could do what I want right when
[503.82 - 507.90] you're not so sick but when you get
[505.50 - 510.30] really sick and the scale tips
[507.90 - 512.82] and you start doing that cacao you you
[510.30 - 515.40] can't heal the chocolate industry the
[512.82 - 518.16] caffeine industry has has a lot of money
[515.40 - 520.14] behind it they will tell you that it has
[518.16 - 522.00] antioxidants and Cacao is good for you
[520.14 - 523.74] and caffeine products are good for you
[522.00 - 527.58] but they're not
[523.74 - 529.80] and they really really rip apart the
[527.58 - 532.62] nervous system they damage the brain
[529.80 - 536.64] over time and they they cause the
[532.62 - 539.16] adrenals to just flood what the cacao
[536.64 - 541.08] does for women is it makes it so many
[539.16 - 543.66] women have to have a C-section when they
[541.08 - 546.36] weren't planning on a C-section
[543.66 - 550.32] that's what cacao can do years of cacao
[546.36 - 552.18] and chocolate coffee right all of it
[550.32 - 553.98] they have think tanks that are designed
[552.18 - 556.80] to really keep people addicted for a
[553.98 - 558.78] lifetime so the caffeine industry
[556.80 - 560.82] has think tanks that are designed to
[558.78 - 562.20] make sure that you stay on caffeine for
[560.82 - 564.30] the rest of your life and that your baby
[562.20 - 567.98] becomes addicted to caffeine and all
[564.30 - 567.98] that carries it on carries it up
[568.20 - 572.34] we can make two kinds of mistakes I'm
[570.06 - 574.20] reading page 147 in brain saver these
[572.34 - 577.62] are incredible books that protocols
[574.20 - 581.00] right friend saver protocols
[577.62 - 581.00] anybody who's interested
[581.04 - 586.80] we can make two kinds of mistakes in the
[583.26 - 589.68] first kind of mistake we can have a test
[586.80 - 594.08] in front of us in school and get several
[589.68 - 594.08] true true or false questions wrong
[595.56 - 600.48] we can make a mistake crossing our T's
[598.08 - 604.98] and dotting our eyes
[600.48 - 607.50] we can make a mathematical mistake
[604.98 - 609.42] in this type of mistake there's no free
[607.50 - 613.86] will
[609.42 - 616.68] or rather not your free will
[613.86 - 619.80] the Free Will behind that test was the
[616.68 - 621.48] Free Will of an institution or the
[619.80 - 626.22] person who designed it
[621.48 - 629.72] so you're in school and you take a test
[626.22 - 629.72] you're not using your free will
[630.00 - 635.46] it's an institution
[632.40 - 638.48] that's making you take that test
[635.46 - 638.48] the institution
[638.70 - 643.08] is in control of your free will you
[641.58 - 645.12] don't have free will
[643.08 - 647.82] you take you're taking the test in
[645.12 - 650.60] school because an institution has you
[647.82 - 650.60] taking that test
[653.82 - 657.18] Free Will behind that test was not the
[656.16 - 659.28] free will
[657.18 - 661.86] of your own
[659.28 - 663.84] it was an institution
[661.86 - 665.64] or the person who designed it so the
[663.84 - 668.22] person who designed your test in school
[665.64 - 671.40] your mathematic medical test or whatever
[668.22 - 672.60] remember I'm not a college grad I never
[671.40 - 674.04] went to college
[672.60 - 676.14] whatever
[674.04 - 679.02] the point is
[676.14 - 681.24] the point is is that
[679.02 - 682.68] if you go to school which is fine I want
[681.24 - 684.90] people to go to school I want them to go
[682.68 - 686.64] to college I want them to do
[684.90 - 688.26] what's right for them of course right
[686.64 - 690.06] not telling people don't go to school
[688.26 - 692.76] it's just that we don't use our free
[690.06 - 694.86] will when we're in school
[692.76 - 696.72] our Free Will is taken over by an
[694.86 - 699.14] institution or a person who designed
[696.72 - 699.14] that test
[701.52 - 706.08] we only used our free will when we
[703.56 - 710.22] decided to sit down
[706.08 - 713.04] this so you walked into class and you
[710.22 - 714.60] sat down that's your when you use your
[713.04 - 717.72] free will
[714.60 - 719.82] and when you filled out the test
[717.72 - 722.40] and you tried to answer questions that
[719.82 - 724.44] was your free will
[722.40 - 727.02] then we can make mistakes that affect
[724.44 - 730.14] our soul mistakes through decision
[727.02 - 733.02] processes using our conscious mind that
[730.14 - 734.64] aren't about exact calculations so
[733.02 - 736.86] there's one form of mistake you make
[734.64 - 740.52] where you fill out the wrong
[736.86 - 744.74] answer on your test in school that's a
[740.52 - 744.74] mistake you made you made a mistake
[746.04 - 751.38] but there's other mistakes mistakes that
[749.10 - 753.78] decision processing happened where you
[751.38 - 756.36] used your Consciousness it's not about
[753.78 - 757.56] exact calculations formulations or word
[756.36 - 759.66] choices
[757.56 - 762.06] we can make mistakes that are outside
[759.66 - 764.94] the realm of punching numbers and
[762.06 - 767.88] answering questions that we've studied
[764.94 - 770.40] and prepared for and memorized
[767.88 - 772.80] so when you study for a test you can
[770.40 - 775.50] still make a mistake oh
[772.80 - 777.54] I remembered the answer I can't remember
[775.50 - 780.00] it right now so I'm going to choose this
[777.54 - 782.66] little spot I'll check this box and oh I
[780.00 - 782.66] made a mistake
[783.54 - 788.48] but there's another form of mistake we
[785.34 - 788.48] make with our consciousness
[789.54 - 793.20] while making these other kinds of
[791.04 - 794.70] decisions our soul can be impacted these
[793.20 - 798.12] are the mistakes we make with our own
[794.70 - 802.58] free will so what I'm trying to say is
[798.12 - 802.58] we can make mistakes in moderation
[803.22 - 807.84] that hinder Us in other ways
[806.28 - 809.46] Health with Liz said this is
[807.84 - 812.22] mind-blowing that's why I didn't
[809.46 - 815.72] continue using my free will now to
[812.22 - 815.72] create myself it's incredible
[815.94 - 818.84] when we're sick
[819.30 - 824.52] the diagnostic testing process is
[821.70 - 827.90] similar to being in school
[824.52 - 827.90] you guys follow me on that
[828.72 - 834.00] when we are sick the diagnostic testing
[831.42 - 836.64] process when we're sick is similar to
[834.00 - 840.24] being in school here's a physical test
[836.64 - 843.96] that the doctor prescribed
[840.24 - 846.80] here's a drug that the doctor prescribed
[843.96 - 846.80] it's kind of like school
[847.02 - 854.88] here's another test here's another drug
[851.52 - 857.64] we use our free will only
[854.88 - 859.08] to try all these tests and these
[857.64 - 862.44] treatments
[859.08 - 866.04] we're using our free will to do the test
[862.44 - 868.86] and try the drug
[866.04 - 872.70] just like we use our free will to sit
[868.86 - 876.36] down and take a test in school
[872.70 - 878.52] we go through the MRIS
[876.36 - 880.44] the CAT scans
[878.52 - 882.60] the blood panels
[880.44 - 885.84] and more
[882.60 - 887.34] we're still not better
[885.84 - 889.56] a lot of people that go through all that
[887.34 - 891.54] and they're not better yet right
[889.56 - 893.76] that leaves us in the realm of not
[891.54 - 895.20] finding answers how many people have
[893.76 - 898.58] gone through
[895.20 - 898.58] a battery of tests
[898.92 - 905.60] taking a battery of drugs
[902.28 - 905.60] and they're not better
[905.64 - 910.38] it leads them to search for answers
[908.10 - 912.54] correct
[910.38 - 915.66] we find ourselves sitting at home one
[912.54 - 919.68] night telling ourselves we really need
[915.66 - 921.54] to heal we have to find an answer
[919.68 - 923.94] how many people have been left sitting
[921.54 - 926.10] home at night
[923.94 - 927.60] after they tried a battery test in a
[926.10 - 929.28] battery of drugs
[927.60 - 931.38] and a battery of doctors and they're
[929.28 - 934.62] sitting home at night
[931.38 - 936.96] and they see to themselves
[934.62 - 939.30] I have to get out of this
[936.96 - 943.04] I have to find a way
[939.30 - 943.04] I have to find an answer
[943.32 - 946.46] I have to heal
[947.88 - 952.62] now we have to use our free will like
[950.76 - 954.36] never before to find answers for our
[952.62 - 955.26] physical body you see where I'm going
[954.36 - 957.06] here
[955.26 - 959.28] anyone who found medical medium
[957.06 - 961.92] information
[959.28 - 963.96] they went above and beyond using their
[961.92 - 967.38] free will
[963.96 - 970.22] they really ignited their free will to
[967.38 - 970.22] find an answer
[973.08 - 977.70] now we have to use our free will like
[975.54 - 980.58] never before to find answers for our
[977.70 - 981.96] physical body it's not about black and
[980.58 - 984.68] white
[981.96 - 984.68] we discover
[984.72 - 990.54] it's about taking a it's not about
[988.50 - 994.02] taking a test
[990.54 - 996.00] in an institution on a memorized set of
[994.02 - 998.94] answers
[996.00 - 1000.32] it's not about being indoctrinated to a
[998.94 - 1004.84] place
[1000.32 - 1004.84] all our egos oh sorry
[1005.72 - 1010.10] must be the ego shifter I'm still
[1007.46 - 1012.68] remembering there it's not about being
[1010.10 - 1014.00] indoctrinated to place all our eggs in
[1012.68 - 1017.06] their basket
[1014.00 - 1018.14] instead finding Health answers becomes a
[1017.06 - 1020.48] journey
[1018.14 - 1023.66] when I think about this getting a little
[1020.48 - 1025.60] bit a little bit emotional right now in
[1023.66 - 1029.30] this moment because I'm getting
[1025.60 - 1031.22] flashbacks over and over again of how
[1029.30 - 1032.84] many people I've seen throughout the
[1031.22 - 1035.30] years
[1032.84 - 1036.44] and how many people that are out there
[1035.30 - 1039.20] now
[1036.44 - 1041.84] they're searching for answers
[1039.20 - 1044.06] their free will only went as far
[1041.84 - 1045.98] as sitting down and taking getting
[1044.06 - 1048.20] through a battery of tests and doing a
[1045.98 - 1049.64] battery of drugs but then they found I'm
[1048.20 - 1052.72] not better yet
[1049.64 - 1052.72] I need to do more
[1054.20 - 1059.00] l r Rose says I can relate and then they
[1057.08 - 1060.86] sat down
[1059.00 - 1063.50] one night
[1060.86 - 1065.24] maybe in their Darkest Hour
[1063.50 - 1066.50] and they thought about all the symptoms
[1065.24 - 1068.60] they have
[1066.50 - 1070.04] and how they've tried everything they
[1068.60 - 1072.56] can think of
[1070.04 - 1074.66] and they're stuck
[1072.56 - 1076.64] spiritual path to true love says all
[1074.66 - 1078.92] those tests really had me fooled that
[1076.64 - 1082.54] they knew what they were doing so glad
[1078.92 - 1082.54] you told us what's really going on
[1084.08 - 1089.36] it's a powerful uh comment by the way
[1086.84 - 1091.34] that means you're experienced that means
[1089.36 - 1094.30] you've seen how things are you know
[1091.34 - 1094.30] what's going on out there
[1097.94 - 1103.70] so what I'm what I'm reading to you guys
[1100.52 - 1106.72] right now is I'm talking about how
[1103.70 - 1106.72] our free will
[1107.30 - 1111.26] really ignites and takes off when we're
[1109.88 - 1114.92] in that dark hour
[1111.26 - 1117.70] and we've used our Free Will instead for
[1114.92 - 1117.70] the institutions
[1117.86 - 1121.70] and then all of a sudden
[1119.54 - 1123.32] there's this moment in time where like I
[1121.70 - 1126.02] need an answer
[1123.32 - 1129.14] I need to heal I need to find something
[1126.02 - 1130.76] and that's when your Consciousness and
[1129.14 - 1133.52] subconsciousness
[1130.76 - 1135.32] really
[1133.52 - 1137.66] hunker down
[1135.32 - 1138.74] attach itself to the Free Will that you
[1137.66 - 1142.66] have
[1138.74 - 1142.66] and then you search for something else
[1143.00 - 1149.42] now you're not putting all your eggs in
[1146.54 - 1152.96] the institutions basket
[1149.42 - 1154.94] instead you're finding Health answers it
[1152.96 - 1157.82] becomes a journey
[1154.94 - 1159.74] kind of like when we're looking for love
[1157.82 - 1161.84] we're lonely
[1159.74 - 1163.22] we want a partner to share our lives
[1161.84 - 1166.58] with
[1163.22 - 1169.28] and there can almost be a desperation
[1166.58 - 1172.40] of our Consciousness in some situations
[1169.28 - 1174.92] that brings the soul into a different
[1172.40 - 1177.68] Realm
[1174.92 - 1180.14] just like in the search for love when we
[1177.68 - 1182.00] reach when we reach this point in our
[1180.14 - 1184.22] search for healing
[1182.00 - 1186.98] it's not about what looks perfect on
[1184.22 - 1188.42] paper anymore or even what makes sense
[1186.98 - 1192.40] anymore
[1188.42 - 1192.40] we end up taking risks
[1193.82 - 1199.16] that's where the soul has no choice but
[1196.52 - 1202.16] to go along for the ride with whatever
[1199.16 - 1205.16] we're being pushed into and whatever our
[1202.16 - 1207.68] Consciousness is pushing our soul into
[1205.16 - 1210.38] even if it's not the best for our soul
[1207.68 - 1213.92] and physical brain and body this is
[1210.38 - 1216.56] where we can make mistakes
[1213.92 - 1219.14] if our Consciousness is peer pressured
[1216.56 - 1221.60] convinced persuaded or conditioned into
[1219.14 - 1223.58] using information or practices that
[1221.60 - 1227.06] don't align with healing or that even
[1223.58 - 1229.66] interfere with healing I'm on page 148 a
[1227.06 - 1229.66] brain saver
[1230.42 - 1235.52] you know when I read that what do I
[1233.24 - 1238.60] understand
[1235.52 - 1241.46] this means that after we leave that
[1238.60 - 1244.40] institutional understanding
[1241.46 - 1246.44] you go through a battery of tests
[1244.40 - 1247.82] you do a battery of drugs
[1246.44 - 1249.50] you're stuck
[1247.82 - 1251.48] and now
[1249.50 - 1253.28] you go on a journey
[1251.48 - 1254.06] you use your free will and go on a
[1253.28 - 1256.58] journey
[1254.06 - 1258.20] but we can still make mistakes using our
[1256.58 - 1261.08] free will on a journey but we're still
[1258.20 - 1263.24] we still have to search
[1261.08 - 1265.46] we may search for love
[1263.24 - 1266.96] it may not work out
[1265.46 - 1268.46] but we
[1266.96 - 1271.22] need it
[1268.46 - 1273.86] to find somebody else
[1271.22 - 1276.14] and maybe it did work out
[1273.86 - 1277.94] or searching for health answers
[1276.14 - 1279.26] we take a whole bunch of stuff that
[1277.94 - 1281.12] isn't good and eat a whole bunch of
[1279.26 - 1284.18] cacao and we do all this other stuff
[1281.12 - 1287.00] whatever I'm just saying
[1284.18 - 1289.10] and we don't get what we need
[1287.00 - 1292.72] but then we stumble across something we
[1289.10 - 1292.72] do find and it works out
[1293.96 - 1296.84] foreign
[1295.00 - 1299.12] spiritual said it made many many
[1296.84 - 1301.58] mistakes because of that
[1299.12 - 1304.42] Korean passion says this is amazing I
[1301.58 - 1308.54] had no idea how deep you were
[1304.42 - 1310.82] and that's your service and
[1308.54 - 1312.68] wait a minute don't you listen to my
[1310.82 - 1314.00] podcast at Medical meme podcast at Apple
[1312.68 - 1315.50] podcast
[1314.00 - 1317.54] and don't you read all the medical
[1315.50 - 1321.68] medium books
[1317.54 - 1324.02] serious deep stuff big time
[1321.68 - 1326.54] ah you thought I was just a celery juice
[1324.02 - 1328.78] guy no I don't know
[1326.54 - 1328.78] foreign
[1335.38 - 1339.98] to go against our instincts check this
[1338.00 - 1343.88] section out you guys this is incredible
[1339.98 - 1346.22] page 148 a brain saver
[1343.88 - 1349.58] moderation
[1346.22 - 1352.88] is one of those practices
[1349.58 - 1354.68] there's nothing wrong with having that
[1352.88 - 1356.06] I'm not saying
[1354.68 - 1357.44] I tell people they can eat what they
[1356.06 - 1358.88] want they can eat pizzas they could eat
[1357.44 - 1360.62] this and this but just try to do some
[1358.88 - 1363.26] medical medium Tools in between it all
[1360.62 - 1364.88] try to get started somehow start with 16
[1363.26 - 1367.64] ounces of celery juice on an empty
[1364.88 - 1369.14] stomach I don't tell people if they have
[1367.64 - 1371.06] to give up everything in their life
[1369.14 - 1373.16] that's not it it depends how sick they
[1371.06 - 1375.02] are and what they need accomplished how
[1373.16 - 1376.82] they need to heal how far they need to
[1375.02 - 1380.30] go someone's really sick they're
[1376.82 - 1383.30] bedridden they're on mattress Island
[1380.30 - 1386.30] there's a way out and it may be where
[1383.30 - 1388.34] we're not doing certain things to get
[1386.30 - 1390.14] out of that
[1388.34 - 1392.12] moderation is one of those practices
[1390.14 - 1394.52] I've always said start bringing in the
[1392.12 - 1396.92] good and crowd out the bad that's the
[1394.52 - 1400.70] medical medium talk for years now
[1396.92 - 1404.14] decades bring in the good slowly and
[1400.70 - 1404.14] it'll crowd out the bad
[1404.60 - 1408.80] moderation is one of those practices
[1406.76 - 1411.98] there's nothing wrong with having that
[1408.80 - 1414.32] you should have what you want
[1411.98 - 1417.02] you need to balance it
[1414.32 - 1421.04] we're told that if we only engage in
[1417.02 - 1423.02] reasonable amounts questionable Foods
[1421.04 - 1425.18] and certain practices such as micro
[1423.02 - 1426.32] dosing caffeine and even alcohol could
[1425.18 - 1430.40] benefit us
[1426.32 - 1431.90] if it's in small reasonable dosages it
[1430.40 - 1432.80] could benefit you that's what we're
[1431.90 - 1435.92] taught
[1432.80 - 1439.48] so we give them a try and we end up set
[1435.92 - 1442.22] back even more in our healing
[1439.48 - 1445.54] absolutely so many people are set back
[1442.22 - 1445.54] in their healing constantly
[1446.72 - 1451.10] whether we know it or not we're set back
[1449.42 - 1453.14] in our healing
[1451.10 - 1455.00] because our conditioning is so strong
[1453.14 - 1458.36] that's what happens on planet Earth
[1455.00 - 1461.24] we're up against an immense amount of
[1458.36 - 1463.16] conditioning here and brainwashing
[1461.24 - 1466.10] we blame ourselves for these practices
[1463.16 - 1468.92] not working out instead of blaming the
[1466.10 - 1472.64] substances themselves
[1468.92 - 1475.24] we don't know how to blame the
[1472.64 - 1475.24] substances
[1476.18 - 1481.28] we're conditioned to think the
[1477.80 - 1483.88] substances are fine like cacao
[1481.28 - 1483.88] coffee
[1484.10 - 1488.72] so many other things
[1486.68 - 1491.18] and this isn't just the cacao and coffee
[1488.72 - 1493.52] thing I'm talking about those two little
[1491.18 - 1495.38] examples
[1493.52 - 1497.42] because of our conditioning is so strong
[1495.38 - 1499.46] we blame ourselves for those for these
[1497.42 - 1502.22] practices not working out instead of
[1499.46 - 1504.80] blaming the substances themselves we may
[1502.22 - 1508.16] even become so attached that we guard
[1504.80 - 1510.68] these practices with our lives
[1508.16 - 1512.42] Kombucha tea can turn your blood into
[1510.68 - 1517.40] acid
[1512.42 - 1520.52] mm info for over 30 years now out there
[1517.40 - 1523.46] it literally can turn the blood into a
[1520.52 - 1525.56] straight acidosis condition
[1523.46 - 1529.96] but people love their Kombucha Tea it's
[1525.56 - 1529.96] most Kombucha tea has caffeine in it
[1536.36 - 1540.20] we've been pushed so often into finding
[1538.46 - 1543.56] fault with ourselves with their brains
[1540.20 - 1546.44] and bodies that we self-blame ourselves
[1543.56 - 1551.32] and it becomes our default setting it's
[1546.44 - 1551.32] my fault it's my fault it's my problem
[1552.56 - 1558.80] I'm the blame my body's faulty I caused
[1556.16 - 1561.02] the problem I'm why I'm sick I'm why I'm
[1558.80 - 1563.90] mental I have a problem because of me
[1561.02 - 1567.38] it's me it's me it's my fault
[1563.90 - 1570.62] it's not the conditioning out there
[1567.38 - 1572.66] yes it is it's not the brainwashing out
[1570.62 - 1574.76] there yes it is
[1572.66 - 1576.86] it's not all the traps out there yes it
[1574.76 - 1579.44] is the traps out there people just blame
[1576.86 - 1583.30] themselves it's got to be me I'm faulty
[1579.44 - 1583.30] I'm broken down I'm a bad person
[1583.94 - 1589.10] Warehouse one says my health crashed in
[1586.58 - 1592.70] early 2020.
[1589.10 - 1595.34] lived with an ostomy bag 10 months
[1592.70 - 1598.22] they had no answer I asked what caused
[1595.34 - 1600.08] my colon disease they had no answer two
[1598.22 - 1601.58] years on medical media my life is better
[1600.08 - 1603.74] than ever now
[1601.58 - 1607.42] Warehouse one on YouTube thank you for
[1603.74 - 1607.42] leaving that comment bless your heart
[1611.06 - 1617.54] moderation cannot be defined
[1614.60 - 1620.38] even though you'll see a definition of
[1617.54 - 1620.38] the word moderation
[1621.44 - 1627.86] if you look it up in the dictionary
[1624.62 - 1632.48] we should see it as undefinable
[1627.86 - 1635.12] because moderation is not measurable
[1632.48 - 1638.02] it's a ruleless definition because it's
[1635.12 - 1638.02] different for everyone
[1638.84 - 1643.24] isn't that interesting moderation can't
[1640.70 - 1643.24] be defined
[1644.00 - 1648.14] that's incredible
[1645.98 - 1651.38] number one Spirit of compassion gave me
[1648.14 - 1653.60] those words and I wrote them as I heard
[1651.38 - 1655.58] them
[1653.60 - 1656.96] I was kind of blown away because I
[1655.58 - 1659.60] didn't think about that what do you mean
[1656.96 - 1661.64] moderation the definition can't like you
[1659.60 - 1664.78] can't have a definition for moderation
[1661.64 - 1664.78] how's that possible
[1666.44 - 1670.22] I cover kombucha and brain saver
[1668.30 - 1672.82] protocols for those that are asking if
[1670.22 - 1675.98] kombucha is actually healthier enough
[1672.82 - 1678.26] I would love to do a Kombucha Tea
[1675.98 - 1680.24] episode I would love to do a Kombucha
[1678.26 - 1682.16] Tea podcast right now and I would love
[1680.24 - 1685.84] to talk about it but we've got to talk
[1682.16 - 1685.84] about moderation for a little bit
[1687.80 - 1691.10] this is mind-blowing right here is it
[1689.96 - 1693.14] just me
[1691.10 - 1694.82] no I know you guys think this is cool
[1693.14 - 1698.66] too right the info
[1694.82 - 1700.52] moderation cannot be defined what
[1698.66 - 1702.14] even though you'll see a definition of
[1700.52 - 1705.32] the word moderation if you look it up in
[1702.14 - 1707.96] the dictionary it still can't be defined
[1705.32 - 1711.08] we should see it as undefinable because
[1707.96 - 1713.96] moderation is not measurable
[1711.08 - 1716.24] it's a ruleless definition because it's
[1713.96 - 1717.56] different for everyone
[1716.24 - 1719.90] foreign
[1717.56 - 1722.60] each individual's limitations are
[1719.90 - 1724.52] different one person's moderation can
[1722.60 - 1727.34] kill another person
[1724.52 - 1730.22] see why it's not definable
[1727.34 - 1732.58] one person's moderation can kill another
[1730.22 - 1732.58] person
[1736.40 - 1740.18] someone else is drinking in moderation
[1738.08 - 1743.50] can kill another person
[1740.18 - 1743.50] who can't drink like that
[1743.84 - 1748.16] that's true whether we're talking about
[1745.58 - 1749.84] alcohol psychedelics or even food even
[1748.16 - 1752.36] food
[1749.84 - 1754.58] someone who's allergic to nuts could die
[1752.36 - 1756.86] from someone else's level of nuts in
[1754.58 - 1759.32] moderation someone else could have a nut
[1756.86 - 1761.36] allergy but still be able to eat nuts in
[1759.32 - 1763.94] moderation another person with a nut
[1761.36 - 1765.62] allergy can't even eat a speck of nut in
[1763.94 - 1767.42] moderation
[1765.62 - 1772.42] it'll kill them
[1767.42 - 1772.42] it can't be defined it's not measurable
[1773.18 - 1779.86] when sort of compassion told me that and
[1775.10 - 1779.86] I put it in here what's this like what
[1780.26 - 1785.42] we hear moderation talked about a lot
[1783.02 - 1787.28] with food choosing to eat a food in
[1785.42 - 1789.86] moderation is born out of knowing
[1787.28 - 1793.04] somewhere deep inside that the food
[1789.86 - 1796.52] you're choosing may not be safe to eat a
[1793.04 - 1799.60] lot of or to eat constantly is that true
[1796.52 - 1799.60] like is that true
[1802.94 - 1806.72] I hear moderation all the time out there
[1804.92 - 1808.88] I hear people talk about it all the time
[1806.72 - 1811.22] I'm eating in moderation I'm doing what
[1808.88 - 1813.32] I want in moderation do you guys hear it
[1811.22 - 1815.00] out there choosing to eat of food in
[1813.32 - 1816.50] moderation is born out of knowing
[1815.00 - 1818.98] somewhere deep inside deep inside
[1816.50 - 1818.98] everybody
[1819.44 - 1822.62] that it may not be a good thing to eat
[1821.42 - 1825.20] too much of
[1822.62 - 1826.84] instinctually you may feel that way I'm
[1825.20 - 1830.42] just gonna have a slice of that
[1826.84 - 1832.94] pepperoni sausage pizza
[1830.42 - 1834.38] I gotta be I gotta just do moderation
[1832.94 - 1836.54] right now and I only have to have to
[1834.38 - 1838.16] slice of that because deep inside I know
[1836.54 - 1840.70] I'm not supposed to be tanking one of
[1838.16 - 1840.70] these every night
[1841.94 - 1847.58] Ros Angela says lived way too many years
[1845.12 - 1850.58] feeling like I was inadequate as a woman
[1847.58 - 1853.82] since age 10 being made to believe my
[1850.58 - 1856.10] body was flawed out and I'd never get
[1853.82 - 1857.00] better thank God I found you three years
[1856.10 - 1860.06] ago
[1857.00 - 1862.52] thank you for being here truly vegan
[1860.06 - 1865.10] mommy V's life
[1862.52 - 1867.56] all the books are truly amazing with
[1865.10 - 1869.60] life-changing information I must say I'm
[1867.56 - 1872.12] really loving the brain saver books
[1869.60 - 1874.40] though I've learned so much I feel like
[1872.12 - 1876.20] the brain saver books are the best books
[1874.40 - 1878.72] ever
[1876.20 - 1881.66] ever out of all time I mean in history
[1878.72 - 1884.24] of Health when you crack into these
[1881.66 - 1887.86] the information is just
[1884.24 - 1887.86] so mind-blowing so incredible
[1889.70 - 1894.14] I mean all the medical meaning books
[1892.34 - 1895.04] so we're talking about moderation right
[1894.14 - 1898.58] now
[1895.04 - 1900.86] deep inside of us innately
[1898.58 - 1902.96] we're using the term moderation because
[1900.86 - 1905.00] we know that we have to be careful and
[1902.96 - 1909.04] that what we're eating might not be good
[1905.00 - 1909.04] and what we're doing might not be good
[1910.16 - 1913.82] we use the term moderation to give
[1911.84 - 1916.28] ourselves permission to consume that
[1913.82 - 1918.38] food something inside us knows we're not
[1916.28 - 1919.88] supposed to be eating fried greasy food
[1918.38 - 1922.76] every day
[1919.88 - 1924.56] is there something inside of you that
[1922.76 - 1927.80] tells you you should probably not be
[1924.56 - 1929.98] eating fried greasy food every single
[1927.80 - 1929.98] day
[1930.50 - 1934.22] because I talk about moderation all
[1932.84 - 1936.98] these years
[1934.22 - 1938.78] I've had a lot of people both like
[1936.98 - 1940.64] outside of the communities and every now
[1938.78 - 1942.56] and then someone inside the community it
[1940.64 - 1945.02] just doesn't like
[1942.56 - 1946.58] you know doesn't like doing their celery
[1945.02 - 1949.00] juice doesn't like whatever and they'll
[1946.58 - 1949.00] be like
[1949.28 - 1956.74] he's he's anti-moderation moderation is
[1952.94 - 1956.74] is the best thing in life
[1957.98 - 1960.80] are we
[1959.60 - 1963.32] foreign
[1960.80 - 1965.90] are we okay to eat cakes and cookies and
[1963.32 - 1968.18] donuts all day long
[1965.90 - 1970.94] we know it's not good
[1968.18 - 1973.84] so maybe we'll just have one cake one
[1970.94 - 1973.84] cookie one donut
[1975.40 - 1980.60] see Rising Phoenix said it would be very
[1978.38 - 1982.90] very very helpful to hear more about
[1980.60 - 1986.78] what is helpful for the normal person
[1982.90 - 1988.94] and not everything but grass and celery
[1986.78 - 1990.68] are acceptable to eat
[1988.94 - 1991.58] what's really interesting about that
[1990.68 - 1993.50] comment
[1991.58 - 1997.16] Rising Phoenix
[1993.50 - 1999.08] is that medical medium information is
[1997.16 - 2001.60] the only out there in all the health
[1999.08 - 2003.10] world that allows people to be a vegan
[2001.60 - 2006.58] if they want
[2003.10 - 2010.36] or an animal protein person if they want

[2036.94 - 2042.22] whatever meaning like looking into the
[2039.28 - 2043.84] books getting the information
[2042.22 - 2045.94] and
[2043.84 - 2048.34] check out the medical game podcasts at
[2045.94 - 2049.90] Apple podcast so you know like what I
[2048.34 - 2051.52] talk about because it's not about just
[2049.90 - 2053.56] grass and celery
[2051.52 - 2055.42] that's not here so I don't know where
[2053.56 - 2057.46] that information came from I don't know
[2055.42 - 2058.96] if someone said that out there you must
[2057.46 - 2061.12] not be reading the books or this or
[2058.96 - 2062.92] hearing the podcasts or seeing
[2061.12 - 2064.66] everything on social media with all the
[2062.92 - 2066.34] amazing foods and the recipes and the
[2064.66 - 2068.08] herbs and the wild foods and you can eat
[2066.34 - 2071.14] meat if you want you can be plant-based
[2068.08 - 2074.56] if you want that's how incredibly vast
[2071.14 - 2077.26] it is so I just want you to know Rising
[2074.56 - 2082.14] Phoenix that it's not just grass and
[2077.26 - 2084.70] celery and it's it's so much the recipes
[2082.14 - 2086.20] you can be eating all the potatoes you
[2084.70 - 2088.60] want you can do whatever you can be
[2086.20 - 2090.64] plant-based you could be animal protein
[2088.60 - 2092.50] it's really there's a tremendous amount
[2090.64 - 2094.66] of information so I wonder if someone
[2092.50 - 2096.52] just said something to you and
[2094.66 - 2098.26] and you just didn't know
[2096.52 - 2100.92] but thank you for being here and thank
[2098.26 - 2100.92] you for that comment
[2103.30 - 2108.34] see we learn along the way that it's not
[2105.76 - 2110.86] the best choice and could lead to some
[2108.34 - 2112.96] kind of Health complication if we want
[2110.86 - 2114.82] to just go crazy and eat donuts every
[2112.96 - 2116.50] day all day long we know that
[2114.82 - 2119.92] something's going to go wrong we can
[2116.50 - 2122.68] sense it we can feel it we know it
[2119.92 - 2125.56] moderation is permission to self-indulge
[2122.68 - 2128.74] or self-sabotage so it's a permission to
[2125.56 - 2131.26] self-sabotage when you hear hey I can do
[2128.74 - 2133.06] it in moderation we're actually giving
[2131.26 - 2135.64] ourselves permission or someone's giving
[2133.06 - 2136.66] us permission that moderation is totally
[2135.64 - 2139.72] fine
[2136.66 - 2140.80] and maybe it is fine if you've never
[2139.72 - 2143.56] been sick
[2140.80 - 2145.96] and you're not sick and you want to play
[2143.56 - 2148.18] reindeer games and you want to partake
[2145.96 - 2149.98] in whatever maybe it is fine if that's
[2148.18 - 2151.24] what you want to do but if you're sick
[2149.98 - 2152.86] and you're struggling you've got the
[2151.24 - 2155.44] migraines and the aches and pains and
[2152.86 - 2157.68] the jaw pain the back pain and you've
[2155.44 - 2160.12] got R.A you're at the rheumatologist
[2157.68 - 2162.04] you're you're going everywhere you're at
[2160.12 - 2164.74] the autoimmune doctor you don't know
[2162.04 - 2166.90] what's wrong with you you got brain fog
[2164.74 - 2168.58] you've got anxiety you've got depression
[2166.90 - 2172.06] you got Tremors ticks and spasms
[2168.58 - 2176.94] whatever's going on then moderation only
[2172.06 - 2176.94] is out to get you not protect you
[2177.30 - 2182.86] maytal said on YouTube I question a lot
[2180.88 - 2184.66] of the foods my health nutritionist says
[2182.86 - 2188.38] for my sibo
[2184.66 - 2191.08] no pears and apples but cookies and one
[2188.38 - 2192.62] serving of alcohol okay
[2191.08 - 2195.75] are you trying to make me laugh
[2192.62 - 2195.75] [Music]
[2196.36 - 2200.44] Hall
[2198.46 - 2203.44] are you trying to cheer me up and make
[2200.44 - 2204.64] me laugh or something give me a giggle I
[2203.44 - 2209.26] don't agree
[2204.64 - 2210.76] the FODMAP list is very outdated
[2209.26 - 2213.16] first of all
[2210.76 - 2216.04] FODMAP or any place else
[2213.16 - 2217.78] they were always outdated mm info was
[2216.04 - 2219.76] always far advanced
[2217.78 - 2222.10] but now they're actually taking medical
[2219.76 - 2224.26] medium information
[2222.10 - 2227.50] and they're incorporating them in all to
[2224.26 - 2229.30] those outdated programs and diet belief
[2227.50 - 2230.86] systems they're just stealing and
[2229.30 - 2232.62] poaching so much mm info and they're
[2230.86 - 2235.00] plugging it into all those outdated
[2232.62 - 2236.68] there was all those outdated crappy
[2235.00 - 2238.54] belief systems that never got people
[2236.68 - 2241.50] better when they were sick anyway you
[2238.54 - 2241.50] made me laugh right there
[2241.78 - 2246.82] okay
[2244.36 - 2248.50] a little bit of alcohol is fine don't
[2246.82 - 2250.96] eat a pear
[2248.50 - 2253.26] don't eat an apple but you can have a
[2250.96 - 2253.26] cookie
[2254.32 - 2257.28] oh man
[2258.40 - 2262.54] I'm cracking up over here
[2260.26 - 2264.04] drinking in moderation is also a term
[2262.54 - 2266.20] though often here that's because they
[2264.04 - 2267.40] were allowing drinking in moderation we
[2266.20 - 2270.16] happen to be talking about that right
[2267.40 - 2271.96] there maybe you even use the term
[2270.16 - 2274.32] drinking in moderation I'm drinking in
[2271.96 - 2277.24] moderation
[2274.32 - 2280.24] you guys want to come over my house
[2277.24 - 2282.10] later have some drinks
[2280.24 - 2285.40] um we'll do it in moderation medical
[2282.10 - 2287.92] medium will have just half a shot of
[2285.40 - 2290.08] vodka Maybe
[2287.92 - 2291.52] do you want a Long Island Iced Tea
[2290.08 - 2292.96] do you want a Bloody Mary do you want
[2291.52 - 2295.18] some do you want do you want a rum and
[2292.96 - 2297.90] coke right we'll do it all in moderation
[2295.18 - 2297.90] I'll have a drink
[2298.66 - 2303.04] kidding
[2300.94 - 2306.10] maybe you even use the term moderation
[2303.04 - 2308.14] as with any other substance using the
[2306.10 - 2311.74] term moderation around alcohol gives us
[2308.14 - 2314.92] a fuzzy safe warm feeling inside I'm
[2311.74 - 2316.60] doing it in moderation I can have this
[2314.92 - 2319.62] beer in this glass of wine right now
[2316.60 - 2319.62] it's in moderation
[2319.78 - 2325.78] it's permission to drink in any capacity
[2322.48 - 2328.06] we feel is appropriate yeah my
[2325.78 - 2330.76] moderation happens to be three glasses
[2328.06 - 2333.04] of wine a night I'm not doing six
[2330.76 - 2335.20] glasses of wine at night I'm doing just
[2333.04 - 2339.52] three glasses of wine a night that's my
[2335.20 - 2342.34] moderation ah it's warm and fuzzy
[2339.52 - 2344.26] that's a slippery slope one person may
[2342.34 - 2347.08] drink every single day and still call
[2344.26 - 2348.82] this moderation heck yeah another person
[2347.08 - 2350.50] may drink in the afternoons and feel
[2348.82 - 2352.96] that's moderation because they're not
[2350.50 - 2355.06] drinking in the morning I don't drink in
[2352.96 - 2358.78] the morning so my moderation is pretty
[2355.06 - 2361.66] good it's pretty solid pretty untapped
[2358.78 - 2363.22] it's right there I mean my moderation is
[2361.66 - 2364.96] don't drink in the morning I could drink
[2363.22 - 2367.90] from the afternoon on as long as it's
[2364.96 - 2370.92] after 12 o'clock in the afternoon I can
[2367.90 - 2373.12] definitely drink that's my moderation
[2370.92 - 2375.16] everybody's moderation when it comes to
[2373.12 - 2377.08] alcohol is different for some it may be
[2375.16 - 2377.80] on weekends only I only drink on the
[2377.08 - 2379.84] weekend
[2377.80 - 2381.46] that's my moderation I got it totally
[2379.84 - 2383.38] under control
[2381.46 - 2385.54] for others it may be one glass of wine
[2383.38 - 2389.08] at night all week
[2385.54 - 2391.84] one glass of wine a week
[2389.08 - 2394.56] and for others moderation may be getting
[2391.84 - 2398.80] straight out drunk once a month I get
[2394.56 - 2401.20] plastered and shit-faced once a month
[2398.80 - 2402.82] that's my moderation I don't drink for
[2401.20 - 2405.58] the whole month
[2402.82 - 2408.10] and then I totally
[2405.58 - 2410.08] get plastered
[2408.10 - 2412.30] we hide our alcohol addiction behind the
[2410.08 - 2415.12] word moderation of it as if it's a
[2412.30 - 2417.22] shield keeping us from harm moderation
[2415.12 - 2419.62] is my shield
[2417.22 - 2421.78] I got a shield right here that's my
[2419.62 - 2422.98] moderation Shield right here and I'm in
[2421.78 - 2425.68] battle
[2422.98 - 2426.94] I'm really getting hungry though oh I
[2425.68 - 2429.78] think I'm gonna have a pizza but it's
[2426.94 - 2429.78] only in moderation
[2431.02 - 2435.82] meanwhile we make those who recognize
[2433.78 - 2438.88] themselves as addicts feel different or
[2435.82 - 2441.22] faulty when that's far from the case
[2438.88 - 2443.38] yeah no you're an addict
[2441.22 - 2445.48] when you're you're doing the
[2443.38 - 2447.40] 20-step program
[2445.48 - 2449.14] you're an addict totally you're an
[2447.40 - 2451.00] alcohol you've got alcoholic you got a
[2449.14 - 2452.98] disease me I'm just drinking in
[2451.00 - 2455.26] moderation I don't have a disease and
[2452.98 - 2457.96] I'm not an alcoholic I drink one glass
[2455.26 - 2460.78] of wine a night I'm not an alcoholic I
[2457.96 - 2462.28] don't have a disease but you you got a
[2460.78 - 2464.92] disease and you're an alcoholic you
[2462.28 - 2468.40] better do your 12-step program
[2464.92 - 2471.46] that's right you better be micromanaged
[2468.40 - 2473.80] because you're not safe with yourself me
[2471.46 - 2476.26] I drink in moderation
[2473.80 - 2478.24] I drink on the weekends yeah I get drunk
[2476.26 - 2480.28] on Saturday night but I got control over
[2478.24 - 2482.02] it I drink in moderation you you better
[2480.28 - 2484.66] be doing your 12-step program man
[2482.02 - 2486.58] because you're an alcoholic
[2484.66 - 2489.46] Jacob Johnson said it's amazing how we
[2486.58 - 2491.64] rationalize our self-sabotage indeed it
[2489.46 - 2491.64] is
[2491.86 - 2494.92] all right let's talk about moderation
[2493.24 - 2496.60] Origins for a little bit if you guys
[2494.92 - 2499.66] hanging in there with me we're gonna
[2496.60 - 2501.58] make a craving shifter today Gene says I
[2499.66 - 2504.10] was told to eat fruits in moderation but
[2501.58 - 2507.52] I could have eggs dairy sugar
[2504.10 - 2510.04] Free Stuff Etc
[2507.52 - 2511.60] better be careful with fruit better eat
[2510.04 - 2513.76] fruit in moderation but you can have
[2511.60 - 2516.82] lots of these
[2513.76 - 2517.96] could have plenty of eggs six eggs a day
[2516.82 - 2521.14] just
[2517.96 - 2525.04] be careful with the fruit
[2521.14 - 2527.68] gotta watch out don't eat more than one
[2525.04 - 2531.06] orange a week but you can have lots of
[2527.68 - 2533.80] eggs all week long it's unbelievable
[2531.06 - 2535.42] Nicholas Russell I've been following mm
[2533.80 - 2537.04] closely really
[2535.42 - 2539.20] what did you find
[2537.04 - 2542.14] I've been following mm closely for about
[2539.20 - 2544.36] seven and a half years boom Nicholas
[2542.14 - 2548.04] Russell that's a long time always spot
[2544.36 - 2550.72] on and never once contradicted info
[2548.04 - 2553.66] uh I love knowing you're keeping a
[2550.72 - 2556.78] record Nicholas that makes me happy mm
[2553.66 - 2560.26] info truly is a game changer it works if
[2556.78 - 2562.66] you work it with a I think a heart there
[2560.26 - 2565.20] thank you Nicholas appreciate it
[2562.66 - 2568.50] it's good to know you've been
[2565.20 - 2571.84] uh watching over me
[2568.50 - 2573.82] waiting for me to screw up someday
[2571.84 - 2575.68] and you know the thing is Spirit of
[2573.82 - 2578.32] compassion it's hard to contradict
[2575.68 - 2579.76] that's the that's the problem like
[2578.32 - 2581.80] that's not the problem that's a good
[2579.76 - 2584.14] problem to have Spirit of compassion
[2581.80 - 2586.18] makes it so I don't contradict because
[2584.14 - 2589.06] it's not my information if I was if it
[2586.18 - 2589.84] was my information from a human I'm a
[2589.06 - 2593.86] human
[2589.84 - 2596.50] I think I am right I'm human and so
[2593.86 - 2598.96] if it was coming from me I probably
[2596.50 - 2601.66] would have contradicted myself a billion
[2598.96 - 2603.16] times over like all the other people do
[2601.66 - 2606.04] in health they contradict themselves
[2603.16 - 2608.14] yearly weekly daily
[2606.04 - 2610.78] and it seems like on social no one
[2608.14 - 2612.16] really sees it it's just here today gone
[2610.78 - 2614.38] tomorrow they contradicted themselves
[2612.16 - 2615.82] six months ago and nobody remembers and
[2614.38 - 2618.34] then they start fresh with some other
[2615.82 - 2620.02] bull crap and then they contradict
[2618.34 - 2621.64] themselves on that right but medical
[2620.02 - 2623.80] medium
[2621.64 - 2625.78] info
[2623.80 - 2627.64] hasn't we don't contradict Spirit
[2625.78 - 2629.98] compassion and we don't contradict and
[2627.64 - 2631.78] we stay consistent and it's always been
[2629.98 - 2634.12] like that for years with eight huge
[2631.78 - 2636.54] Bibles I mean it's it's really
[2634.12 - 2636.54] incredible
[2641.08 - 2644.64] so that's important to know too
[2645.10 - 2648.58] exactly never contradict itself Lucas
[2647.68 - 2650.44] says
[2648.58 - 2653.08] we don't do trends
[2650.44 - 2655.90] we don't do Trends this is timeless
[2653.08 - 2658.18] information on how to heal
[2655.90 - 2660.94] medical medium info
[2658.18 - 2663.90] is not Trend this trend that Trends
[2660.94 - 2667.18] don't heal people this is incredible
[2663.90 - 2668.44] Timeless classic unique information from
[2667.18 - 2670.78] above
[2668.44 - 2672.34] all right moderation Origins if you guys
[2670.78 - 2675.22] don't mind I would
[2672.34 - 2677.38] I want to proceed if that's okay
[2675.22 - 2679.60] even when we know better
[2677.38 - 2681.16] when we know not to consume something
[2679.60 - 2683.38] that isn't best for our health and
[2681.16 - 2685.36] well-being someone around us or
[2683.38 - 2689.08] something we see in the media tells us
[2685.36 - 2691.84] we can do it in moderation
[2689.08 - 2694.18] even when we know better
[2691.84 - 2697.12] someone is going to say you can do that
[2694.18 - 2700.66] in moderation in the media or somebody
[2697.12 - 2702.16] you know or whoever a practitioner a
[2700.66 - 2703.90] doctor but always listen to your doctors
[2702.16 - 2707.20] do what your doctor tells you of course
[2703.90 - 2708.28] but I'm just saying someone's gonna tell
[2707.20 - 2710.56] you
[2708.28 - 2711.88] even when you know better and it's not
[2710.56 - 2714.00] good someone's going to tell you to do
[2711.88 - 2714.00] it
[2714.52 - 2720.04] sometimes it's stated
[2717.46 - 2723.46] and sometimes the modern the moderation
[2720.04 - 2724.90] message is subliminal
[2723.46 - 2725.92] sometimes it's just straight out in
[2724.90 - 2730.08] front
[2725.92 - 2730.08] sometimes it's subtle
[2730.18 - 2734.92] the suggestion is always in our face
[2732.64 - 2738.22] whenever we turn
[2734.92 - 2740.14] and wherever we turn moderation is
[2738.22 - 2741.88] nothing new it goes back hundreds and
[2740.14 - 2744.22] hundreds of years in human civilization
[2741.88 - 2745.54] this is cool just check this out if you
[2744.22 - 2747.58] guys got a second this piece of
[2745.54 - 2749.08] information always blows my mind
[2747.58 - 2751.06] it just does
[2749.08 - 2752.92] Katrin says Anthony what's going on with
[2751.06 - 2755.02] people
[2752.92 - 2758.08] who do everything opposite every day
[2755.02 - 2759.88] that food smoke caffeine drink on the
[2758.08 - 2763.00] weekends no fruits no grains no water
[2759.88 - 2764.20] age 45 and no problems why talk about
[2763.00 - 2766.84] that through all the medical medium
[2764.20 - 2768.64] books their scale will tip Katrin
[2766.84 - 2771.82] it will tip
[2768.64 - 2773.44] and they'll be in a bad place no one's
[2771.82 - 2776.08] escaping sickness
[2773.44 - 2777.28] everybody's sick out there now just
[2776.08 - 2781.72] about
[2777.28 - 2783.40] and there are a few scragglers left that
[2781.72 - 2786.04] are 45 and they're still doing what they
[2783.40 - 2788.56] want and then when they're 48
[2786.04 - 2790.00] it hits sometimes it just hits in
[2788.56 - 2791.62] different ways maybe they won't get a
[2790.00 - 2793.18] chronic illness where it's all this
[2791.62 - 2794.98] neurological stuff
[2793.18 - 2797.16] and instead they get their first heart
[2794.98 - 2797.16] attack
[2800.80 - 2805.12] moderation is nothing new it goes back
[2803.02 - 2807.22] hundreds and hundreds of years in human
[2805.12 - 2809.26] civilization
[2807.22 - 2811.84] for as long as it's been human
[2809.26 - 2815.52] conditioning
[2811.84 - 2815.52] to eat ourselves sick
[2817.48 - 2823.38] the concept of everything in moderation
[2819.64 - 2823.38] arose in ancient times
[2823.48 - 2826.72] the con the concept of everything in
[2825.58 - 2828.94] moderation
[2826.72 - 2831.16] it's not now it's not in modern day
[2828.94 - 2835.26] world modern day Health modern day
[2831.16 - 2835.26] medicine modern day reality
[2835.30 - 2841.62] the concept of everything in moderation
[2837.66 - 2841.62] arose in ancient times
[2841.72 - 2847.06] people are always like oh oh in ancient
[2843.58 - 2849.88] times they knew about this herb oh no
[2847.06 - 2855.28] in ancient times they knew about celery
[2849.88 - 2857.62] no celery root is not celery celery root
[2855.28 - 2860.26] was a soup
[2857.62 - 2863.08] in the 1800s had nothing to do with
[2860.26 - 2865.06] people dude juices orange juice the
[2863.08 - 2867.16] industries push it hard they push
[2865.06 - 2868.54] moderation really hard and they run with
[2867.16 - 2870.40] it because that's how they keep you
[2868.54 - 2872.38] conditioned and train you but check this
[2870.40 - 2874.60] out
[2872.38 - 2876.58] everything in moderation arose in
[2874.60 - 2879.52] ancient times when people first started
[2876.58 - 2882.46] to have the type of access that allowed
[2879.52 - 2886.38] them to indulge in excessive consumption
[2882.46 - 2886.38] of all times the minute
[2886.98 - 2894.40] civilization was able to indulge
[2891.22 - 2898.86] they weren't starving to death
[2894.40 - 2898.86] they had resources and access
[2899.74 - 2905.86] that's when moderation started
[2904.24 - 2908.14] hand in hand
[2905.86 - 2910.90] with this newfound instant gratification
[2908.14 - 2916.00] the concept of moderation developed as a
[2910.90 - 2920.44] way to rain it all in because the minute
[2916.00 - 2924.40] civilizations had enough to eat
[2920.44 - 2927.70] they would burst their stomachs
[2924.40 - 2930.40] they would eat themselves sick
[2927.70 - 2931.96] and so they had to learn how to rein it
[2930.40 - 2933.40] in and the minute they learned how to
[2931.96 - 2935.86] rein it in that's when moderation
[2933.40 - 2938.56] started
[2935.86 - 2940.30] this moderation knowledge has now been
[2938.56 - 2943.48] in our Consciousness for centuries
[2940.30 - 2945.58] that's insane it's unbelievable really
[2943.48 - 2948.88] if we're not taught to be careful and
[2945.58 - 2951.28] put limitations on what how when why or
[2948.88 - 2955.84] how much we consume we can kill
[2951.28 - 2957.70] ourselves in one capacity or another
[2955.84 - 2960.52] today
[2957.70 - 2963.52] we can kill ourselves today in one
[2960.52 - 2966.18] capacity or another
[2963.52 - 2966.18] boom
[2968.20 - 2974.62] even though the word moderation emerged
[2972.10 - 2976.96] concept emerged as a way to protect
[2974.62 - 2978.88] ourselves
[2976.96 - 2980.86] now moderation is being used to
[2978.88 - 2984.04] unprotect ourselves did you know that
[2980.86 - 2986.92] moderation is being used in the reverse
[2984.04 - 2988.42] way right now you guys to unprotect
[2986.92 - 2990.46] ourselves
[2988.42 - 2992.68] that's what we're being brainwashed to
[2990.46 - 2995.62] do constantly now unprotect ourselves
[2992.68 - 2997.72] we're using it moderation as a
[2995.62 - 3000.96] permission to poison ourselves
[2997.72 - 3003.20] we're actually using moderation now to
[3000.96 - 3006.30] give us permission to poison ourselves
[3003.20 - 3010.20] whatever we want to indulge in or harm
[3006.30 - 3014.04] ourselves with we can do it so in good
[3010.20 - 3016.38] Consciousness right by saying
[3014.04 - 3018.48] in good conscious we're doing it in
[3016.38 - 3020.70] moderation we're meant to have the tools
[3018.48 - 3022.80] and knowledge and resources to not go
[3020.70 - 3025.20] down this road though and that's another
[3022.80 - 3026.16] point we're meant not to have to go down
[3025.20 - 3027.54] this road
[3026.16 - 3031.38] but
[3027.54 - 3033.60] what's happened now is it's being used
[3031.38 - 3035.76] to control us
[3033.60 - 3037.32] to control what we purchase out there
[3035.76 - 3040.28] now and
[3037.32 - 3040.28] to eat now
[3043.08 - 3048.36] it's hard to break away from the status
[3045.90 - 3051.42] quo of moderation because it's so built
[3048.36 - 3052.74] in society it is weaved into society now
[3051.42 - 3056.46] as
[3052.74 - 3058.56] a weapon moderation has been weaponized
[3056.46 - 3062.94] right now
[3058.56 - 3065.64] so much so that if you start eating
[3062.94 - 3067.86] to heal someone's gonna call you
[3065.64 - 3069.90] orthorexic
[3067.86 - 3072.12] if you start eating to heal this is
[3069.90 - 3074.28] incredible kale right here this kale is
[3072.12 - 3076.32] insanely good
[3074.28 - 3078.78] if you start eating to take care of
[3076.32 - 3080.58] yourself and heal
[3078.78 - 3082.44] and you you're sticking with your celery
[3080.58 - 3084.54] juice every single morning you can be
[3082.44 - 3088.32] called orthorexic or that the medical
[3084.54 - 3091.08] medium protocols or create orthorexia or
[3088.32 - 3093.54] something that's how weaved in
[3091.08 - 3095.94] moderation has been it's weaponized
[3093.54 - 3097.80] right now it's actually weaponized so
[3095.94 - 3100.80] you're not allowed to have your spinage
[3097.80 - 3103.50] and your heavy metal detox smoothies and
[3100.80 - 3106.50] your incredible celery juice
[3103.50 - 3108.18] and your protocols to heal and eat as
[3106.50 - 3109.92] much fruit as you want or whatever it is
[3108.18 - 3112.08] you're not allowed to because the minute
[3109.92 - 3114.30] you start doing the right things to take
[3112.08 - 3117.62] your healing further and further they
[3114.30 - 3117.62] weaponized moderation
[3117.90 - 3123.90] to actually use against anyone in that
[3120.48 - 3125.58] moment to totally screw with their head
[3123.90 - 3126.66] you can feel like you're on top of the
[3125.58 - 3128.58] world you're taking care of yourself
[3126.66 - 3130.80] you're actually juicing you're you're
[3128.58 - 3132.78] working on healing and then someone will
[3130.80 - 3134.88] turn around on social or somewhere and
[3132.78 - 3136.38] be like oh you're just orthorexic now
[3134.88 - 3138.78] and it scares the crap out of somebody
[3136.38 - 3141.36] and they'll be like what I am what do
[3138.78 - 3143.10] you mean oh like you can you can eat
[3141.36 - 3145.20] healthy in moderation but you should be
[3143.10 - 3146.52] able to do everything you want to do but
[3145.20 - 3148.08] I was sick
[3146.52 - 3150.66] oh it doesn't matter you should still
[3148.08 - 3152.90] just do moderation like it's weaponized
[3150.66 - 3152.90] now
[3154.20 - 3158.10] it's hard to break away from the status
[3156.30 - 3160.74] quo of moderation because it's so
[3158.10 - 3163.08] weaponized in society if you choose to
[3160.74 - 3165.96] fight the brainwashing of moderation you
[3163.08 - 3168.18] get your wrists smacked if you want to
[3165.96 - 3171.84] fight moderation someone's going to
[3168.18 - 3174.42] smack your wrists with a ruler
[3171.84 - 3176.04] you get punished by others who don't
[3174.42 - 3178.26] want to break their own habits and
[3176.04 - 3180.18] lifestyle of using moderation to consume
[3178.26 - 3182.82] foods and substances that aren't
[3180.18 - 3183.66] benefiting them what happens is you're a
[3182.82 - 3185.88] threat
[3183.66 - 3188.52] when you take care of yourself
[3185.88 - 3192.32] you're a threat in the medical medium
[3188.52 - 3192.32] Community if you do it right
[3192.54 - 3198.18] because you're a threat to somebody else
[3195.48 - 3200.58] outside of the community
[3198.18 - 3203.16] that doesn't want to be told
[3200.58 - 3204.60] they should eat better they want to do
[3203.16 - 3205.86] it their way
[3204.60 - 3207.96] they want to have all their chocolate
[3205.86 - 3209.34] bars they want to eat their eggs even
[3207.96 - 3211.26] though they're sick and it's making them
[3209.34 - 3213.30] sick they want to do whatever they're
[3211.26 - 3215.16] doing their apple cider vinegar or
[3213.30 - 3216.42] whatever they want they want to do what
[3215.16 - 3218.76] they're doing and they don't want to be
[3216.42 - 3221.04] they don't want to be shown
[3218.76 - 3222.72] that it probably isn't a good idea so
[3221.04 - 3224.58] then they'll turn around and bite the
[3222.72 - 3225.84] person and be like no you're orthorexic
[3224.58 - 3228.60] you shouldn't be taking care of yourself
[3225.84 - 3229.62] they weaponize it people get bullied and
[3228.60 - 3232.26] that's what we're talking about now
[3229.62 - 3234.54] bullying they get bullied big time for
[3232.26 - 3236.10] it even in families in society and
[3234.54 - 3239.04] Friends
[3236.10 - 3240.66] by strangers it's so hard for people to
[3239.04 - 3243.06] heal when they're being bullied and
[3240.66 - 3245.54] moderation is being weaponized against
[3243.06 - 3245.54] people
[3245.76 - 3250.62] and so is the whole term orthorexia
[3248.28 - 3253.02] which means that was a term did you know
[3250.62 - 3255.06] that was a conventional term created to
[3253.02 - 3258.26] stop somebody from taking care of
[3255.06 - 3261.18] themselves did you guys know that
[3258.26 - 3264.48] orthorexia was a conventional term
[3261.18 - 3267.80] created to stop someone from starting a
[3264.48 - 3267.80] journey of eating healthier
[3269.58 - 3272.72] that is a sick
[3272.82 - 3278.04] what's sicker than that
[3274.80 - 3280.26] what's sicker than just the dumbass
[3278.04 - 3282.90] guy or professional that created that
[3280.26 - 3284.76] term back in the 80s because he didn't
[3282.90 - 3287.04] like to see somebody actually eating
[3284.76 - 3288.90] better what's sicker than that if
[3287.04 - 3291.12] somebody
[3288.90 - 3292.86] in the health communities or even the
[3291.12 - 3294.48] medical medium Community that's trying
[3292.86 - 3295.50] to sabotage other people and they use
[3294.48 - 3298.94] that term
[3295.50 - 3298.94] that's actually even sicker
[3300.60 - 3304.98] if you choose to fight the brainwashing
[3302.76 - 3308.58] of moderation you get your risks back to
[3304.98 - 3310.74] get punished by others you get bullied
[3308.58 - 3312.54] punished by others and bullied by people
[3310.74 - 3315.56] who don't want to break their own habits
[3312.54 - 3318.30] or lifestyle so they lean on moderation
[3315.56 - 3320.58] so they can consume foods and substances
[3318.30 - 3323.78] that aren't benefiting them
[3320.58 - 3323.78] they're delusional
[3323.94 - 3329.28] Aquarian passion says
[3326.88 - 3332.24] so refreshing to find you with three
[3329.28 - 3332.24] explanation points
[3333.90 - 3339.54] Laura says I have been called orthorexic
[3336.54 - 3342.32] and believed it until medical medium and
[3339.54 - 3342.32] learning the truth
[3346.38 - 3351.78] medical uh meaning France says I've
[3349.74 - 3355.76] bullied in my been bullied in my family
[3351.78 - 3355.76] for five years for doing medical medium
[3356.06 - 3361.02] those who give themselves permission to
[3358.86 - 3363.06] indulge in what they know deep down
[3361.02 - 3365.76] isn't good for them
[3363.06 - 3368.94] find it unsettling and even threatening
[3365.76 - 3372.26] when you decide to go in your own
[3368.94 - 3375.66] Direction and heal
[3372.26 - 3377.10] including people that dabble in the
[3375.66 - 3378.66] medical medium community that sell
[3377.10 - 3382.64] programs and all kinds of stuff they
[3378.66 - 3382.64] they don't want to be told
[3383.34 - 3388.68] that you're doing it
[3386.46 - 3391.08] they want to be able to just roll you
[3388.68 - 3394.34] and tell you how to do it there's that I
[3391.08 - 3394.34] see that too it's really sad
[3394.98 - 3400.80] they want to even kind of shake you up
[3397.02 - 3401.76] and shift your brain you're taking care
[3400.80 - 3403.68] of yourself you're doing the medical
[3401.76 - 3405.72] meeting protocols you're doing a great
[3403.68 - 3407.46] job you've already done some healing and
[3405.72 - 3409.70] then they try to shake you up and be
[3407.46 - 3409.70] like
[3410.76 - 3415.20] why are you doing it that way should do
[3412.80 - 3418.38] it my way and then when you look my way
[3415.20 - 3421.14] which is you not orthorexic it's
[3418.38 - 3423.24] moderation meanwhile it's normal to be
[3421.14 - 3426.06] sick though
[3423.24 - 3427.62] as you age you gotta you can get on a
[3426.06 - 3429.78] ton of medications and be in the
[3427.62 - 3432.90] hospital all the time that's great
[3429.78 - 3434.76] well that's a great place to be
[3432.90 - 3435.96] don't do it right so you're in you know
[3434.76 - 3437.16] so you're in the hospital all the time
[3435.96 - 3439.74] down the road when you age and
[3437.16 - 3442.82] everything else and
[3439.74 - 3442.82] it's just unbelievable
[3443.16 - 3447.96] it makes people uncomfortable when you
[3446.16 - 3450.36] start to find empowerment and take
[3447.96 - 3452.88] control over your health and become
[3450.36 - 3455.76] aware that certain foods and substances
[3452.88 - 3458.36] even in moderation aren't doing you
[3455.76 - 3458.36] justice
[3458.64 - 3463.62] instead of questioning their own
[3460.38 - 3467.10] practices these moderation champions
[3463.62 - 3471.30] and orthorexic champions tend to point
[3467.10 - 3473.88] to you as if you're out of balance
[3471.30 - 3475.46] the more uncomfortable they feel the
[3473.88 - 3478.08] higher and the more
[3475.46 - 3480.78] insistently they start waiving the
[3478.08 - 3483.48] moderation and orthorexic flag
[3480.78 - 3486.38] they're watching you do your thing and
[3483.48 - 3489.54] they're like trying to throw shade in it
[3486.38 - 3492.60] orthorexic moderation
[3489.54 - 3495.18] Tamara Jones says that's gaslighting gas
[3492.60 - 3496.92] lighting indeed it sure is to trigger
[3495.18 - 3499.68] somebody to doubt themselves well that's
[3496.92 - 3501.66] what a whole bunch of people do out
[3499.68 - 3504.48] there
[3501.66 - 3507.54] and volca says my mom was not sick like
[3504.48 - 3509.22] ever and hit her 70s and Wham chronic
[3507.54 - 3511.86] illness is popping up
[3509.22 - 3513.90] and more after C triggering more issues
[3511.86 - 3515.90] sure there are people that skate by to
[3513.90 - 3519.36] their 70 but that's rare that's rare
[3515.90 - 3521.88] that that's that's not happening anymore
[3519.36 - 3525.00] I'm letting you know that that's there's
[3521.88 - 3526.86] only gonna be a few of those
[3525.00 - 3528.90] and then not even a few of those anymore
[3526.86 - 3530.28] people aren't going to be 70 and then
[3528.90 - 3531.66] they get sick when they're 70. they're
[3530.28 - 3532.62] all going to be getting sick in their
[3531.66 - 3534.24] 20s
[3532.62 - 3535.98] everyone's going to be getting sick of
[3534.24 - 3539.00] their 20s coming up
[3535.98 - 3539.00] that's where it's going
[3546.00 - 3550.32] yes there's people in the community that
[3548.04 - 3552.36] used to be in the community
[3550.32 - 3554.94] and they wanted to sell programs and do
[3552.36 - 3556.10] and and all that off of medical medium
[3554.94 - 3558.42] information or whatever they're doing
[3556.10 - 3561.00] and then they go and they try to put
[3558.42 - 3562.74] down other people's heads in hopes that
[3561.00 - 3564.60] they gain more followers and stuff to
[3562.74 - 3567.06] sell more programs to that's happened
[3564.60 - 3568.68] over the years it's kind of like a thing
[3567.06 - 3570.78] and then they throw words like
[3568.68 - 3572.70] orthorexic out where they throw other
[3570.78 - 3574.68] stuff with moderation because they try
[3572.70 - 3577.92] to screw up the person's thinking in
[3574.68 - 3579.42] heads and just mess them up and in the
[3577.92 - 3583.68] end the whole thing's sad because it
[3579.42 - 3586.38] just doesn't get anybody anywhere
[3583.68 - 3589.80] a chance to grow free
[3586.38 - 3590.64] we are smart our souls are wise do you
[3589.80 - 3592.44] hear that
[3590.64 - 3594.84] you know what I love about Spirit of
[3592.44 - 3598.32] compassion
[3594.84 - 3601.56] it's like I remember writing that
[3598.32 - 3603.54] and something Felt So Good In the Moment
[3601.56 - 3606.90] I was sitting at my desk
[3603.54 - 3608.22] and SOC said we are smart and I wrote We
[3606.90 - 3610.02] are smart
[3608.22 - 3612.00] and then Spirit of compassion said our
[3610.02 - 3613.86] souls are wise and I wrote our souls
[3612.00 - 3616.44] were wise
[3613.86 - 3619.44] and then I wrote
[3616.44 - 3620.82] from SOC when we're finally given the
[3619.44 - 3622.98] knowledge
[3620.82 - 3625.02] the correct knowledge
[3622.98 - 3629.24] about how to heal
[3625.02 - 3629.24] we have the potential to recognize it
[3630.36 - 3633.60] when I wrote that like my hair was
[3632.40 - 3635.94] standing up
[3633.60 - 3638.28] back of my neck I was just like
[3635.94 - 3639.60] Goosebumps everywhere and I feel like
[3638.28 - 3642.00] that now
[3639.60 - 3642.90] if we have struggled enough with our
[3642.00 - 3645.66] health
[3642.90 - 3646.62] that the blindfold of Health Dogma has
[3645.66 - 3649.14] come off
[3646.62 - 3651.44] we can see the information here for what
[3649.14 - 3651.44] it is
[3651.54 - 3655.32] and spirit of compassion gave me those
[3653.46 - 3657.66] words to write
[3655.32 - 3660.80] like
[3657.66 - 3660.80] who would ever know that
[3661.80 - 3664.58] the truth
[3664.68 - 3670.02] then it's like recognizing a soul mate
[3666.78 - 3672.84] after years of relationships gone awry
[3670.02 - 3676.20] whether suddenly or slowly we realize
[3672.84 - 3679.08] that those past relationships we
[3676.20 - 3682.32] contorted ourselves into in desperation
[3679.08 - 3684.42] didn't go wrong because of some flaw in
[3682.32 - 3686.94] Who We Are
[3684.42 - 3689.76] just like a healthy relationship the
[3686.94 - 3692.28] truth about healing may push us to grow
[3689.76 - 3696.06] if we give ourselves that chance to grow
[3692.28 - 3699.24] we give ourselves the chance to heal
[3696.06 - 3704.10] there's so much depth in this right here
[3699.24 - 3706.08] if you even read into it and really read
[3704.10 - 3708.42] what that is it
[3706.08 - 3710.40] is more even there than even your
[3708.42 - 3712.50] reading
[3710.40 - 3714.96] when on the other hand we take
[3712.50 - 3718.26] moderation and apply it to the world of
[3714.96 - 3722.18] poisons and toxins we push it too far
[3718.26 - 3724.80] now we're taking the basic
[3722.18 - 3726.24] problematic standard of moderation and
[3724.80 - 3729.66] exalting it
[3726.24 - 3731.58] to a place recklessly

[3947.64 - 3950.94] how that works with the diet hide fat
[3949.68 - 3952.62] and everything they're like wait aren't
