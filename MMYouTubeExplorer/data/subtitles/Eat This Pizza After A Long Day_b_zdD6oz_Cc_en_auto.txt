[0.00 - 4.00] It's at the end of the night. I just
[1.44 - 6.40] came back from Cafe Gratitude night one
[4.00 - 8.48] of the popup dinners, the pizza party.
[6.40 - 10.64] And I got my pizza right here, which is
[8.48 - 13.04] actually amazing. I got more than one
[10.64 - 15.68] pizza, though, cuz you know, I might be
[13.04 - 18.72] eating them different times. This one is
[15.68 - 20.08] the Mediterranean Putin. This is
[18.72 - 22.40] amazing. I'm just going to take a bite.
[20.08 - 22.40] Can't help
[22.44 - 27.00] it. Oh, that's insane. All right, let me
[25.20 - 31.12] see what else I
[27.00 - 31.12] got. Another one here.
[31.92 - 36.96] Okay. So, oh
[33.80 - 40.96] yeah, right here it's the veggie medley
[36.96 - 43.96] with the uh broccolini and then the um
[40.96 - 46.96] potato cheese. This is really
[43.96 - 46.96] good.
[48.12 - 52.68] Mhm. That's
[50.44 - 55.68] insane. That's
[52.68 - 58.88] insane. So good. But here's the thing. I
[55.68 - 61.28] even got a couple more
[58.88 - 63.40] There's one right here. It's probably
[61.28 - 66.92] one of the other ones. Obviously, there
[63.40 - 70.24] is. Wow. And then I got one
[66.92 - 73.56] more. So, am I going to eat all four of
[70.24 - 77.84] these tonight? No, I don't think so.
[73.56 - 80.00] But I am going to eat definitely one of
[77.84 - 82.00] them for sure. Maybe I'll eat one and a
[80.00 - 84.00] half cuz I really didn't eat anything
[82.00 - 85.76] today. You know, I just been so busy.
[84.00 - 87.12] Didn't eat much. just spending on a
[85.76 - 89.44] little bit of coconut water and some
[87.12 - 91.20] other stuff. So, but now I'm hungry. So,
[89.44 - 93.68] at the end of the day, I'm going to eat
[91.20 - 95.20] you guys. And um I'm so excited about
[93.68 - 97.96] this. This is a collaboration medical
[95.20 - 99.92] medium and Cafe Gratitude with pizzas.
[97.96 - 102.56] Unbelievable. The first pizza
[99.92 - 103.32] collaboration ever in Cafe Gratitude
[102.56 - 105.32] right
[103.32 - 108.72] here.
[105.32 - 111.60] And and they're delicious. These are
[108.72 - 114.08] worth flying out of the country, flying
[111.60 - 117.20] from another country to here to actually
[114.08 - 120.16] just taste these. They're that great.
[117.20 - 122.40] Oh, by the way, the crust, chickpea,
[120.16 - 125.28] potato, and sweet potato. How about that
[122.40 - 127.76] for a crust? That's unique. That's
[125.28 - 129.28] amazing. Medical meme pizzas. Cafe
[127.76 - 130.72] Gratitude. Anyway, you guys, I'm just
[129.28 - 132.24] going to start eating. That's what I'm
[130.72 - 134.88] going to do. I'm going to move this one
[132.24 - 137.12] over for a second. I'm going to bring
[134.88 - 139.12] this one back over here. And I'm
[137.12 - 142.00] actually gonna just start, you know, I'm
