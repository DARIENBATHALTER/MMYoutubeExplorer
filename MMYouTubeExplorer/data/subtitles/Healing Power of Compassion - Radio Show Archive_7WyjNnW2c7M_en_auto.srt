00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,920
compassion for ourselves and we don't

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,399
claim to be um you know an enlightened

34
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:36,799
one I never have I'm a student of spirit

35
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:41,479
I'm a student of spirit when I'm talking

36
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:44,399
about compassion I'm reteaching myself

37
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:47,439
in this moment along with giving you any

38
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,520
information I can from Spirit spirit's

39
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,680
been teaching me about compassion and

40
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,399
and and giving me all the information

41
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,880
since I was a child before I can even

42
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:56,119
pronounce it I'd hear the word from

43
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,680
Spirit and I couldn't even pronounce it

44
00:01:56,119 --> 00:02:00,479
I'd be like comp what is this and

45
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:04,200
I'd be like and I would and I would have

46
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:06,920
to say the word and and it doesn't mean

47
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,879
I have enough of it it doesn't mean I've

48
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:12,360
worked hard on it or I'm compassionate

49
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:14,360
enough to myself I try I work on it I

50
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,879
work on with everything Spirit has given

51
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:19,400
me and I and I Pat myself on the back

52
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,440
when I can and I need you to to do that

53
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,160
too and I need you to learn about

54
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,760
compassion because it's so critical to

55
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,000
your healing it's so critical to knowing

56
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,319
what compassion even means because if

57
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,480
you don't know what it means it's it's

58
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,879
hard to even touch it or grasp it and

59
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,080
you know some people might argue and say

60
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,360
well you either have it or you don't

61
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,840
some people have it or they you don't no

62
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:43,599
no no we all we all can access it we all

63
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,879
can access compassion we all have it in

64
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,440
us somewhere it just needs to come out

65
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:51,480
and we can create it if we don't think

66
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:54,400
we have it in us we can create it we can

67
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,920
learn about it and that's the big thing

68
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,080
and so you know it's so I'm learning too

69
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,800
from Spirit all the time with compassion

70
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,480
I'm learning too too and and because

71
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,840
because yeah because I get busy I do

72
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,400
things I'm always listening to Spirit

73
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,920

74
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,640

spiritual and physical but the point is

77
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,760
is that you know I can also I can use a

78
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:20,920
dose I can use a dose of spirit's

79
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,360

and and and knowing compassion so let's

94
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:59,239
go into this I'm saying this because

95
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,000
it's so important this whole thing this

96
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:05,400
is I'm really excited about this show

97
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,360
really excited about the show now I know

98
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:11,400
that that many of you that know my book

99
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,439
The First Medical medium book I talk a

100
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,720
little bit about compassion because

101
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:20,280
spirit is that source to begin with and

102
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,280
spirit has always known that I'm flawed

103
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,919
I'm flawed in many ways Spirit has

104
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:27,120
always known that I am and you know I'm

105
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:31,560
a human being SP you know Spirit chose

106
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,919
me to have the gift not because I'm this

107
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,360
uh miraculous person that's not it at

108
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,800
all the irony is not because I'm the

109
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,840
smartest person because I'm not I'm not

110
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,320
the smartest person you guys probably

111
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:46,120
know that by now and and spirit when

112
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,039
Spirit chose me to have the gift when I

113
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:51,240
was a child it wasn't because Spirit

114
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:53,400
thought oh here's an enlightened one to

115
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:56,600
have the gift that wasn't it Spirit gave

116
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:59,160
me the gift because Spirit knew that

117
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:01,840
there was something inside of me and it

118
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,840
wasn't compassion it wasn't compassion

119
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,600
Spirit knew excuse me that there was

120
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:09,280
something inside of me that could hang

121
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:12,120
in there for the ride that's why I was

122
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,720
chosen there was something inside of me

123
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:17,400
I had a tough Edge that there was

124
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,960
something that would stand the test of

125
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:22,560
time in order to be able to give you the

126
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,080
information to be the messenger to give

127
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,039
people the information with chronic

128
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:30,880
illness to get them the information they

129
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:32,479
need to heal and spirit my my throat's a

130
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,199
little horse I've been talking so much

131
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:38,280
lately so just bear with me Spirit knew

132
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:40,280
that I could handle it or had a

133
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,840
possibility of handling it because when

134
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,280
you get this gift when you're a young

135
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,080
age you don't want to live you don't

136
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,080
want to stay here you don't want to be

137
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,440
here

138
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:54,800
anymore so you don't want to you don't

139
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:57,440
want to be here because it's too hard

140
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,960
it's too hard to constantly see all day

141
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,840
long or wherever you're going as you're

142
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,880
growing up everybody's suffering and

143
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,880
it's tooo hard to see their illnesses

144
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,639
it's too hard to live with that Non-Stop

145
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,160
and to hear Spirit Non-Stop and to hear

146
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,680
a voice from the outside of your ear

147
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:14,440
going into your ear Non-Stop and never

148
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,440
ending because it's always there meaning

149
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,400
spirit is always there he's always

150
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:21,280
giving me the information whether I like

151
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:24,000
it or not so there were it wasn't

152
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:26,400
because I was an enlightened child that

153
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,599
I receive the gift just don't get

154
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,599
confused with that it wasn't because I

155
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:34,199
was going to be a guru or I was a guru

156
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:36,520
and I was a chosen one no not at all it

157
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:38,560
was because the people who do get given

158
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:42,000
this gift over the centuries don't make

159
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:44,039
it too long I almost didn't make it

160
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,199
because you don't want to be here with

161
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:48,199
this gift because you can't function as

162
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:49,759
a normal human being you get the snow

163
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:51,639
blind which is the light blindness

164
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,960
constantly because you're doing readings

165
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:57,080
all the time you can't you can't be in

166
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,800
public places too too long because the

167
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,440
readings will eventually just be too

168
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,199
much and too much much too much there's

169
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:05,280
so many reasons I mean I could name list

170
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,840
100 reasons why it's difficult but

171
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,720
that's not what this is about I'm

172
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:13,160
talking about the whole thing about why

173
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,960
I got the gift and how I have to be the

174
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:18,479
messenger of compassion for you the

175
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,479
messenger of spirit's compassion so that

176
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,960
you have a chance to move forward and

177
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,560
you have a chance to do what you need to

178
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:26,400
do and take care of yourselves and look

179
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:28,360
out for your loved ones it's all part of

180
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,919
the same thing about getting the message

181
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,639
and information about what's going on

182
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:34,160
with health so you have that information

183
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:36,199
knowledge is power and in The Compassion

184
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,479
situation The Compassion moment here

185
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:41,000
that's knowledge is power too it it

186
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:43,280
means that much it makes that much of a

187
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,080
difference so when I was younger it

188
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,639
didn't mean I had any compassion when I

189
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:50,919
was a child and growing up turning into

190
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:52,879
a teenager I had to learn about what it

191
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:55,840
was and what it was what it meant of

192
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:58,280
course I felt bad for people I felt

193
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,280
their suffering it was difficult I still

194
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:04,680
do now with every bit about it but

195
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:07,000
tapping into the compassionate side a

196
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,960
part of what unconditional is that I'm

197
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,520
going to go into is is is is was a big

198
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:15,199
key for me and I've done that on and off

199
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:18,039
with everything I have and I've done

200
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:21,360
that and I've did everything I can in

201
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:24,159
that realm but I still need work too we

202
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,440
all do Spirit knew I was flawed when I

203
00:08:24,159 --> 00:08:28,639
was given the gift in the sense that you

204
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:30,840
know I wasn't this this enlightened

205
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,360
being Spirit knew that that wasn't what

206
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:36,880
it is Spirit knew I was tough that I

207
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:39,479
could handle I could handle the beatings

208
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:42,640
I could take a beating a real good

209
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:45,720
licking I could take a kicking I could

210
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,880
take the crap kicked out of me and

211
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:51,360
that's what Spirit knew that I had that

212
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:53,399
I possessed I could get stepped on and

213
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:57,200
and and and stand back up and dust

214
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:58,920
myself off I could be pushed I could be

215
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,000
pushed aside I could be pushed on the

216
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:04,680
ground I could be pushed around I could

217
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:08,440
be bullied I could be smacked around

218
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:10,640
Spirit knew I was tough Spirit knew I

219
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:14,760
could handle it when I was born Spirit

220
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:18,240
knew what soul I was and who I was

221
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:20,959
Spirit knew it may not be great

222
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:24,640
Enlightenment Spirit knew I might not be

223
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:27,399
the greatest revered Guru in the world

224
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,760
Spirit knew all that Spirit just knew I

225
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:33,240
was going to be a good messenger a good

226
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:35,839
messenger and spirit knew this Spirit

227
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,680
has compassion towards me has compassion

228
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:41,320
towards me knows I've had it hard knows

229
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:43,760
I didn't have it easy knows what my job

230
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,880
is in this lifetime to try to finish out

231
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,800
in this lifetime with the best capacity

232
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,920
I have and the best ability I have to

233
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:53,000
get you the information I can and spirit

234
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:55,399
knows that Spirit has compassion for me

235
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,560
and I have to realize that that Spirit

236
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:59,160
actually has compassion for me and it

237
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,680
matters to me I have to have comp

238
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,360
compassion too for myself for what I've

239
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,040
been through what I struggled through

240
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,760
for what you've struggled through for

241
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,959
everything you've gone through I have

242
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:12,680
compassion for you I do I do I do I've

243
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:14,959
worked on it since a child I haven't

244
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:17,560
been perfect it doesn't mean I've had it

245
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:19,640
all the time and every minute of my life

246
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,560
but I've worked on having it and I want

247
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:24,000
to tell you all about it a little bit

248
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:27,120
you know when I was a child and

249
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,959
compassion told me so compassion which a

250
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,760
spirit told me that compassion

251
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:34,079
is the understanding of

252
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,079
suffering that's what spirit said to me

253
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:38,800
compassion is the understanding of

254
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:41,639
suffering what does that mean it means

255
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,200
you you know compassion means that you

256
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:46,200
understand somebody's suffering that you

257
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,440
you at least understand it I've known a

258
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,000
lot of people out there they don't even

259
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,320
understand somebody's suffering meaning

260
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,959
like what get up go go to the doctor

261
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,040
what are you doing oh you're making it

262
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:58,000
up oh you're just weak oh it's all in

263
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,760
your head whatever it is and they're not

264
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,160
tapping into comp comp passion when they

265
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:05,519
do that that's the first thing

266
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:08,279
compassion is the understanding of

267
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,560
suffering it's a big one compassion is

268
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:13,680
the

269
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:17,079
soul the soul of so many things it's the

270
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,160
soul of Truth and honor and purpose it's

271
00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:23,000
that

272
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:26,760
powerful compassion is the soul of peace

273
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,480
and joy and and it matters now you have

274
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:31,519
to understand you know

275
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,079
it this is about having compassion for

276
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,040
yourself it's not just about having

277
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:37,920
compassion for others that that can

278
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:40,000
happen that can happen naturally I need

279
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,000
you to have it for yourself and I'm

280
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,560
going to talk about that a little bit

281
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,079
you know Spirit told me that God is love

282
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:50,680
and that is ancient and we know that we

283
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:53,120
know God is love you know God is love

284
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:55,279
now whatever God is to you some people

285
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,279
say well you know what God to me is

286
00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:01,480
something different God to me is a light

287
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:03,160
in this guy God to me is a Creator God

288
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,680
to me is the universe God to me

289
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:09,560
everybody's got a different thing going

290
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:12,120
on but whatever that is okay it's love

291
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:14,000
God is love but this is the important

292
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:17,480
thing I have to tell you about that's

293
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:21,800
powerful God is not love

294
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:25,680
alone God is unconditional love you know

295
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:28,480
that you know that right and the human

296
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:31,399
mind us us humans will always put

297
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,920
conditions upon our love you know that

298
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:34,399
you know we'll put conditions upon the

299
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,480
love for others you know we'll put

300
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,240
conditions upon the loves the love for

301
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,240
ourselves there's going to be conditions

302
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:46,120
on even the love for ourself we can't

303
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:49,240
help it that's what US humans do okay we

304
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:53,639
we think we can feel unconditional

305
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:57,040
love but if we do feel unconditional

306
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:59,519
love that means compassion was alongside

307
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:03,079
of our love see

308
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:06,320
see unconditional love is compassion

309
00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:08,880
plus love put together it's both of

310
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,399
those it's compassion plus love put

311
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:14,880
together that's what unconditional love

312
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:16,880
is that's the human version of

313
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,360
unconditional love God's unconditional

314
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,480
love is much bigger than that I'm sorry

315
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,800
to say that but much bigger much bigger

316
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,839
much bigger than that God's

317
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,720
unconditional love is bigger than than

318
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:30,360
human's unconditional

319
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:32,000
love but even hum hum have a whole

320
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,320
difficult problem we have a whole

321
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,519
difficult situation we can't T we can't

322
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,680
tap into that unconditional love ever

323
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:42,680
because we're wrapped up in love without

324
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,399
the compassionate side mixed in because

325
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:47,160
that's what makes things unconditional

326
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:50,000
is when compassion is then ignite it's

327
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:52,800
it's when it's combined when it's joined

328
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,240
it forces into love when compassion is

329
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:58,519
both with love that is

330
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:00,320
when it's a human's version your version

331
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:02,320
of unconditional love that you can have

332
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,440
that's when it's us our version of

333
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,040
unconditional love you can have so I

334
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,839
know that's really intense this is a

335
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:10,839
deep show this is no joke I'm going to

336
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,600
give you information from Spirit I've

337
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:14,560
wrote some of this in some of the books

338
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:17,839
too and life-changing Foods I've talked

339
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:20,800
about this about what's going on like

340
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:23,360
compassion is not empathy right you know

341
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:27,120
that because if I've I've written about

342
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:30,399
that compassion is not empathy empathy

343
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:33,160
is is something that has expiration date

344
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:35,560
you know like a carton of spoiled milk

345
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:37,880
you know if someone has been suffering

346
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:40,399
for a long time and you have empathy for

347
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:43,120
that person it could wax and Wayne it

348
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:46,079
could sour over time it has an

349
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:50,320
expiration date

350
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:53,560
unless compassion is really in there see

351
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,680
because compa empathy is not compassion

352
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,680
but we confuse that so what we do is we

353
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,759
have this whole thing about love we love

354
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,959
ourselves we follow in love love love

355
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:04,120
love love

356
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:08,040
love but and then we have empathy mixed

357
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:10,240
in with it but it can go sour it has an

358
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:14,320
expiration date even with people that

359
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:16,360
are in love it just it can die you I

360
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,639
can't tell you how many people who have

361
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:21,079
been ill for a long time and their story

362
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:22,759
has been like they had their family

363
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:24,320
rallying for them they had their friends

364
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:27,399
rallying for them they had people

365
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:30,360
rallying for them and they kind of

366
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:32,480
dissipated it dissipated whether it's

367
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:35,839
months or years later because empathy

368
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:38,440
has an expiration date even if they love

369
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:41,240
you it has an expiration date compassion

370
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:43,680
is not sympathy don't get confused with

371
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:45,480
sympathy too it's another whole problem

372
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,959
I've written about that's because

373
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,720
sympathy has strings attached it has

374
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:53,360
strings attached that's what that is

375
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:57,600
it's like alone it's like alone

376
00:15:53,360 --> 00:16:01,680
compassion doesn't have strings attached

377
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:04,279
compassion isn't like a loan or a bank

378
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,480
loan or you're loaning something or

379
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:08,959
you're loaning somebody a lawn mower or

380
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,639
you're Lo somebody a shovel so they can

381
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:14,720
shovel their driveway there's a string

382
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:16,680
attached to that you feel bad that your

383
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,560
neighbor can't shovel their Drive shovel

384
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,720
their porch out because they their

385
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,920
shovel broke so you give them a shovel

386
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,600
you kind of you see I'm sympathetic to

387
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:28,040
that here's a shovel here take this

388
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:30,240
shovel but don't keep that shovel don't

389
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:33,040
don't keep keep it that's not yours I

390
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,440
want that back someday that's what that

391
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,880
is that's sympathy we can't get that

392
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,759
confused with compassion that means that

393
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,360
you don't have compassion about your

394
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,600
neighbor not being able to shuel out

395
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,560
their porch stoop you do you're not it's

396
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,519
not about compassion there it's about

397
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:49,240
sympathy we can't we can't get that

398
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,800
confused with oh that's a compassionate

399
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:53,279
person they want they want that person

400
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,279
to be okay there no we got to be careful

401
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:57,759
with that it's not really what it

402
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,759
is it's like when you lend somebody that

403
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:02,000
sympathetic ear you know when you lend

404
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,039
them that sympathetic ear there's an

405
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,079
understanding that she or he the other

406
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:09,120
person will lend that favor back someday

407
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:12,439
we lend that sympathetic ear back

408
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:14,079
someday I owe you one you owe me one

409
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:16,959
that's what sympathy is that's not

410
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:18,839
compassion you owe me one I gave you

411
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,640
that I gave you that I listen to you

412
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:24,360
when I listen to you at that time you

413
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:26,000
owe me some listening that's sympathy

414
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:28,039
that see there's a difference there I

415
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,960
know this is heavy duty I know this is

416
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:31,160
like

417
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,440
I know I'm hitting you hard with this

418
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:38,559
stuff and and look look I I'm hitting

419
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:41,840
you hard with it but I'm I'm re reesing

420
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:43,960
it myself if that's even a word I'm

421
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,320
digesting it all over again constantly

422
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:48,520
from Spirit I have to I'm a human I'm

423
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:51,400
like you we're all we're all like each

424
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:53,039
other you know so the whole thing with

425
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:56,679
sympathy is like I owe you one you owe

426
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:59,799
me one and it's a it's a it's a tricky

427
00:17:56,679 --> 00:18:02,320
one because if you have a friend that

428
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:04,840
nurtures somebody during a breakup so if

429
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:07,120
you have a breakup if you broke broke up

430
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:10,000
with a relationship and someone nurtures

431
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,960
you it's there's an understanding there

432
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,960
it's

433
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:16,000
transactional that means you better be

434
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:18,679
doing that for me if I have a breakup

435
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,799
you better be doing that for me

436
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:25,240
compassion has no strings attached

437
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:27,159
there's no I owe you and you owe me

438
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:30,799
compassion is doesn't have a cell by

439
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:33,520
date like that boiled container of

440
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:36,000
milk when you received compassion

441
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,960
there's no loan shark there's no bank

442
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,640
loan there's no lone shark or somebody

443
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,760
with a baseball bat that's going to

444
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:44,799
break your legs if you don't come up

445
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:48,480
with that lot of money that you

446
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:52,559
borrowed compassion won't hunt you down

447
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:55,080
like a rat and snap you in a trap

448
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:58,039
compassion won't do that compassion

449
00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:00,520
won't want you back with interest with

450
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:02,480
interest interest paid I want you back I

451
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:05,960
want to own your soul and I want

452
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:08,559
interest on top of that

453
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:10,559
compassion is not like empathy and

454
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:12,640
sympathy and those aren't bad things

455
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:14,960
they they have their places don't get me

456
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:18,440
wrong they have their

457
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:21,799
places but compassion is nothing to mess

458
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:23,480
around with it's a whole different game

459
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:25,559
and it isn't a game that's the whole

460
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,840
point because empathy and sympathy is

461
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:32,039
like a

462
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:33,919
game compass is not a game it's not it

463
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:37,240
is something different it's

464
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:40,039
vital compassion can even be

465
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:42,240
contagious compassion is

466
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:46,679
lifechanging compassion opens up the

467
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:49,320
heart compassion con can change the soul

468
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:52,240
of someone compassion doesn't

469
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:55,280
necessarily reside in somebody's

470
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:57,320
Soul it doesn't always reside in their

471
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,799
soul like oh that person is just their

472
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:04,080
soul is filled to compassion no it it

473
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:07,320
can fill it can restore a soul it can

474
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:09,960
heal a soul compassion is more powerful

475
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:13,600
than our souls

476
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:16,320
themselves than our than our souls

477
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,640
themselves you need to know that

478
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,760
compassion heals the heart it can fill

479
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,799
the

480
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:26,280
heart some of us have compassionate

481
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:28,400
sources deep within us and they've

482
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:31,120
gotten buried along the way they've

483
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,679
gotten buried they've gotten dumped on

484
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,039
and we can tap into that compassion

485
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:36,440
Source some people don't have compassion

486
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,000
that's deep inside them but they can

487
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:40,159
still get it they can still get it and

488
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,799
restore it or they can Infuse themselves

489
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,480
with it they can receive it they can

490
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:46,039
ingest it they can take it they can have

491
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:48,360
it inside of

492
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:51,240
them and you know when I was young and

493
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:53,600
when I was a child Spirit knew this guy

494
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:55,840
here this guy here he needs he needs

495
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,679
work there's no doubt he there's work to

496
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:01,159
do for this guy there's no doubt meaning

497
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:03,760
he needs self- transformational work

498
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:06,320
there's no question he needs

499
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:09,799
Enlightenment there's no doubt but we're

500
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:12,440
picking him we're picking him for one

501
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:15,880
reason he can hang in here with this

502
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:18,840
gift he can listen to The Voice every

503
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:23,360
day as a child and not lose

504
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:25,799
it and not lose himself he can still he

505
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:28,559
can still hold on to himself and hang in

506
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:31,440
there even if it's by a thread even if

507
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:34,159
it's by a thread I almost left a couple

508
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,679
of times you know the story about my dog

509
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:40,880
when my dog went out into the ocean and

510
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:43,840
I went out there in that cold water and

511
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:46,279
and I and I knew I knew I I knew I was

512
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:48,320
going down I knew I was done for and I'd

513
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:50,279
never even know you guys now I'd never

514
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:53,360
even be able to do what I do I'd never

515
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:54,880
be able to whatever if that happened and

516
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,760
I would only only people that would have

517
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,120
known of me and my information from

518
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:01,520
Spirit and the messages would have been

519
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:05,360
been the people in the first 19 20 years

520
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:07,960
of my life and that would have been it

521
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:10,559
but I I've I stood the test of time and

522
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:13,480
I'm here a lot of times I thought about

523
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:15,840
hey this is too hard but Spirit knew

524
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:18,880
there was something inside of me now

525
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:21,679
spirit said the the re the real test

526
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:24,520
after that is going to be getting this

527
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:27,159
guy to build up his compassionate

528
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:29,320
reserves and I've had to work on that my

529
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:32,760
whole life and I just want to share that

530
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:34,600
and have you do that too why not why not

531
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:36,320
and you know what I bet you some of you

532
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,679
if not most of you or many of you or

533
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,400
would ever probably have more

534
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:42,799
compassionate reserves than I've had or

535
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,360
have you probably would blow me out of

536
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:47,559
the water and many of you are probably

537
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:50,039
lacking it and diminished it or

538
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:52,760
diminishing in it even way way way under

539
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:57,080
me diminishing it of it and need a

540
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:59,240
refill I need a refill all the time so

541
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:02,799
that's why this is such a powerful

542
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:06,039
powerful powerful show and I love this

543
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:10,440
when we become Frugal with our

544
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:13,559
compassion when we become withholding of

545
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:16,279
it that's not good

546
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:18,520
either that's a really difficult thing

547
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:21,679
that can happen we treat our compassion

548
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:24,200
like it was like we were rationing it we

549
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:28,159
were carefully rationing

550
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:30,480
it that's not a good thing either when

551
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:33,600
we micromanage its

552
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,760
distribution we come become trapped with

553
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,840
barriers when we micromanage our

554
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,400
compassion I'll give you a little bit of

555
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,720
compassion but it won't give you a

556
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:44,200
little bit of compassion I won't I'll

557
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:46,720
give this person just a little bit maybe

558
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,360
I'll give this person some another day

559
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,080
maybe I'll just only give a little bit

560
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:55,240
to this person maybe just a tiny bit

561
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:57,120
when we rash it maybe I'll only give

562
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:59,559
myself a little bit of compassion I'll

563
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:03,080
just give myself a tiny pat on the back

564
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:07,039
how about that a little tiny Pat not a

565
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:09,440
big Pat right not a big Pat just give

566
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:12,640
myself a little you know you know that

567
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:15,559
isn't good either we get trapped like a

568
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:18,880
rat in a trap we get trapped like a

569
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:20,400
raccoon in a in a in a one of those

570
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,760
metal traps when you're trying to get a

571
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:26,919
raccoon out of your garage you're trying

572
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:31,000
to get a raccoon out of your garage you

573
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:33,720
know it's we get get stuck because what

574
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,559
happens is we ration it we ration it on

575
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:37,559
ourselves and there's a barrier there's

576
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:41,880
a

577
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:43,159
barrier so this is just a little bit of

578
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,399
what I'm going to talk about with

579
00:24:43,159 --> 00:24:46,240
compassion we're going to go into some

580
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:48,720
other stuff too we're we're we're

581
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:52,039
rediscovering compassion within

582
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,679
ourselves we're rediscovering it if we

583
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:56,880
have it already in there we're going to

584
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:58,279
reignite it if we don't have any at all

585
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:02,760
I've run across people people they don't

586
00:24:58,279 --> 00:25:04,480
have a speck of it a speck of it and I

587
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:08,120
and and I was supposed to feel good

588
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:11,159
about myself because I had a good hunk

589
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:13,760
of it inside of me lots of

590
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:15,960
compassion and then I've run across

591
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:18,159
people with zero compassion so you would

592
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:21,520
think I would walk away saying whoa ho

593
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:24,159
ho ho whistling

594
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:28,679
away happy because I'm so loaded with

595
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:32,679
compassion and proud of myself and and

596
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:34,840
no I I I felt terrible terrible for this

597
00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:38,279
person or the people I've come across

598
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:40,840
with no compassion inside of them and I

599
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:44,559
felt kind of like okay kind of guilty I

600
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:46,480
had so much what do I do what do I do

601
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:48,159
how do I what do I do the first thing I

602
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:51,480
was was having compassion for the person

603
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:54,600
who didn't have any at all and I try to

604
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:57,279
instill what I could and spread the

605
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:58,679
message because it's that important and

606
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:01,480
when someone someone's dried up from it

607
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:05,559
or doesn't have any of it at all it's

608
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:07,520
sad it's truly sad so you know look hey

609
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:10,840
do you have a cup of tea herbal tea this

610
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:13,279
is intense this is really this is really

611
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:15,279
you know this is tough stuff this is

612
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:17,640
tough stuff so let's get into it a

613
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:21,039
little bit so I was saying

614
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:25,559
earlier God is love right we know that

615
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:27,760
we know that and but God is not just

616
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:28,679
love alone God is unconditional love

617
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:32,320
know

618
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:34,120
that the human mind which is our minds

619
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,960
puts conditions on everything on

620
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:39,159
ourselves and on others we can't help it

621
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:42,120
we can't help it there's no

622
00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:43,679
question we think we can feel

623
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:46,600
unconditional

624
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:49,039
love but we can only feel unconditional

625
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:52,080
love if we've tapped into compassion

626
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:53,159
alongside of our love they both have to

627
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:57,360
be

628
00:26:53,159 --> 00:27:01,000
there compassion plus love that's our

629
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:03,919
ver version of real unconditional love

630
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:07,279
that's our version of it this is going

631
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:09,320
to be intense right here okay this is

632
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:12,919
you can't find

633
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:16,120
peace unless you have some

634
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:18,440
compassion you can't find peace unless

635
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:22,360
someone

636
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:26,159
bestowed generously compassion upon

637
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:28,600
you peace for someone who has no

638
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:31,240
compassion is when someone gives them

639
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:33,600
compassion I know that's intense when

640
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:35,919
someone gives you compassion it can give

641
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:39,880
someone with no compassion peace it can

642
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:42,919
give somebody suffering with hatred upon

643
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:45,519
themselves when someone hates

644
00:27:42,919 --> 00:27:48,000
themselves and they hate their existence

645
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:49,919
or they just don't like their body or

646
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,840
they just don't like who they are or

647
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,360
they don't believe in themselves or

648
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,919
they've lost all confidence which I'm

649
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:57,159
going to cut into the confidence thing

650
00:27:54,919 --> 00:27:58,240
you got to hear about this this is

651
00:27:57,159 --> 00:27:59,640
intense

652
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:03,120
from

653
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:05,200
Spirit when someone denies themselves of

654
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:08,480
anything because they hate themselves so

655
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:11,039
much and someone bestows compassion

656
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,840
towards them you wouldn't believe what

657
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,840
can

658
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:16,600
happen it's unbelievable the miracle

659
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:20,120
that can

660
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:22,120
occur often when people think they have

661
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:24,200
compassion for themselves it's really

662
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:26,159
confidence So This Is Where It's Tricky

663
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:30,080
right here just look out hold on to this

664
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:32,840
hold on to this get ready okay when

665
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:35,480
someone thinks they have compassion for

666
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:37,640
themselves it's really just confidence

667
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:40,000
and that's a mistake made all the time

668
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:42,159
and I'll tell you why it's a mistake

669
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,919
this is unbelievable What Spirit has

670
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:46,120
taught me over the years and what I'm

671
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:49,320
about to share with

672
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:52,360
you that's what we build in the world

673
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:54,679
right now it's confidence not compassion

674
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:57,919
do not get those confused because

675
00:28:54,679 --> 00:29:00,559
they're confused they're confused the

676
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:04,080
minute something goes wrong like in

677
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:06,679
someone's life like love confidence goes

678
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:10,320
away did you know that did you know that

679
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:11,960
confidence goes away so therefore what

680
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,919
they thought was compassion

681
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:17,080
self-compassion towards themselves

682
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:20,240
disappears completely it goes

683
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:23,279
away you can shape your whole lifetime

684
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,880
around confidence believing in yourself

685
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:26,679
because of your achievements and listen

686
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,799
there is a good thing about that too I'm

687
00:29:26,679 --> 00:29:30,840
not trying to cut that in half I'm not

688
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:35,240
trying to tear that tear that down I'm

689
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:38,559
not trying to ruin that I'm just saying

690
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:41,480
you can shape your whole lifetime upon

691
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:44,320
confidence 100% where it's all about

692
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:47,200
confidence and not realize it you can

693
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:50,039
believe in yourself and in one flick of

694
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:53,200
a switch just like when you turn a light

695
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:55,519
off the darkness of self-doubt can take

696
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,519
its place and Destroy every last bit of

697
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:59,480
that confidence and tear it down a

698
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:02,399
lifetime of confidence ripped down

699
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:04,760
thrown down the toilet thrown in the

700
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:07,440
garbage confidence is important please

701
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:09,480
don't get me wrong we should all hold on

702
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:13,720
to it when we

703
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:15,880
can if it's all you got you hold on to

704
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:17,880
it if you have no compassion and didn't

705
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:20,399
realize it you've mistaken it with

706
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:21,919
confidence it's okay you hold on to that

707
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:24,360
confidence and you don't you try not to

708
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:28,480
let it go you hold on to it if you

709
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:30,640
can but when people hit him a chronic

710
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:33,159
illness and their confidence in

711
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:38,480
themselves turns to

712
00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:40,640
zero it turns to zero it drops it's gone

713
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,640
it wasn't compassion in the end it

714
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,840
wasn't self-compassion that was confused

715
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:47,200
with confidence it was confidence it was

716
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:49,320
just confidence in whatever was going on

717
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,039
in their life I see it with young people

718
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,760
all the time I see it with college

719
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:54,000
students that get sick I see it with

720
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,440
people that are starting their lives

721
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,240
after college and they get sick and they

722
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,519
got hashimotos thyroiditis and they get

723
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,039
fatigue and they don't know what it is

724
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:02,039
and doctors are giving them all these

725
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:03,600
prescriptions and their family members

726
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:05,039
or their spouses or their boyfriends or

727
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,080
girlfriends are kind of like acting

728
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:09,639
weird because of it and their confidence

729
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:11,960
drops and drops and drops and drops and

730
00:31:09,639 --> 00:31:15,120
there's no self-compassion involved

731
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:18,279
something else takes place self-hatred

732
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:21,399
the confidence disappears it waxes it

733
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:22,960
wanes it disappears it diminishes

734
00:31:21,399 --> 00:31:24,600
confidence is important don't get me

735
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,840
wrong it's how we struggle through

736
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:28,960
school and get get our grades done it's

737
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:30,679
how we become good students it's how we

738
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,200
we we work in the workplace it's how we

739
00:31:30,679 --> 00:31:34,799
try to build our careers we try to have

740
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:37,120
confidence in what we do at work but if

741
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:40,600
if self-compassion if compassion isn't

742
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:45,919
mixed in it if it's not in there in any

743
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:49,600
way all it takes is one failure one

744
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:52,480
failure okay one failure and boom

745
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:54,240
confidence is destroyed a lifetime of

746
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,679
confidence can be destroyed then you're

747
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,440
trying to get an empa an empathetic ear

748
00:31:56,679 --> 00:32:00,120
a sympath athetic ear from someone a

749
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,919
friend or a family member to build your

750
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:05,399
confidence back up but it doesn't even

751
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:07,720
mean still compassion is

752
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:10,519
involved I'm just saying how important

753
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:13,519
self-compassion is it's a savior it's a

754
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:16,080
Lifeboat it is a life raft it is one of

755
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:17,799
those those those Circle things with

756
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,919
those donuts you throw into the water

757
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:24,000
with a rope on it when someone's

758
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:26,279
drowning drowning and failure and no

759
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,600
confidence anymore even though their

760
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:30,519
whole life was based on building conf

761
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,960
confidence just like athletes build

762
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:33,279
confidence in themselves and all of a

763
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:35,200
sudden they have a failure and that

764
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:37,279
confidence just disappears completely

765
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,760
100% but if there's no self-compassion

766
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:42,240
in there it makes it that much

767
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,760
harder we should hold on to confidence

768
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,360
whenever we

769
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,960
can but it doesn't have the strength of

770
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:49,960
something else you need to know this it

771
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:53,159
doesn't have the strength of compassion

772
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:55,279
please understand this this is all

773
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:57,720
wisdom from

774
00:32:55,279 --> 00:33:01,000
Spirit wisdom from Spirit

775
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:03,240
Spirit you know I I'm impressed all the

776
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,320
time in the sense where I'm like Spirit

777
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:10,080
you just blew me away again you blew me

778
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:12,440
away again because if I didn't have you

779
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:15,519
giving me this information I wouldn't

780
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:19,240
even I wouldn't even know any of

781
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:21,080
this and it blows me away because

782
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:23,639
spirit's talking to me right now you

783
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:25,880
have to understand that as we're sitting

784
00:33:23,639 --> 00:33:29,039
here all together spirit's giving me

785
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:30,880
this information I just want you to know

786
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:33,760
how important that is

787
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:37,360
too confidence is not the answer to

788
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,360
self-hatred spirit

789
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:44,799
says confidence doesn't give us peace it

790
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:47,399
gives us temporary

791
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:50,159
peace because the minute confidence is

792
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:52,720
broken from a failure of any kind or any

793
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:55,360
kind of struggle or loss or any kind of

794
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:57,240
struggle with our health on any level

795
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:59,200
like if it was some kind of ill illness

796
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:01,080
chronic illness or autoimmune disease or

797
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:04,120
we're told our body's attacking itself

798
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:05,760
when it's not right the autoimmune

799
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:07,919
chapter in thyroid

800
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,839
healing when we're told our body's

801
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:12,599
destroying itself we lose confidence in

802
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:16,000
our body and without self-compassion we

803
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:18,119
just destroyed our our peace is

804
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,760
destroyed that's why I call the medical

805
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:22,599
industry with their

806
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,159
theories their misbegotten theories

807
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:27,800
they're misguided theories they call

808
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:29,639
them peace destroyers peace destructors

809
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:32,119
that's what I call those and they get

810
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:34,639
they bleed on to alternative medicine to

811
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:37,240
the functional medicine doctors without

812
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:38,119
knowing by accident destroy the peace in

813
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:40,639
others

814
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:42,119
too but not understanding how the body

815
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:44,079
doesn't attack itself because it was

816
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:46,480
just a theory and it's not

817
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:49,440
correct we lose confidence when we get

818
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:52,040
in illness when we're sick too long we

819
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,280
lose our peace or peace of mind or peace

820
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:56,480
in our soul or peace in our hearts our

821
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:59,280
family members lose the peace around us

822
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:01,079
it happens I'm just being truthful but

823
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,920
it doesn't have to happen this way you

824
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:04,480
don't have to lose your peace you don't

825
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:06,680
have to lose all

826
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,320
this it's okay if you lose your

827
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:10,320
confidence but if you have your

828
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,440
self-compassion if you have compassion

829
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,119
what does that mean and I'm going to

830
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,320
talk about it if you have your

831
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:18,640
compassion for yourself in there a

832
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:22,119
little bit it won't hurt when the

833
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:23,720
confidence is busted in half it won't

834
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:26,320
hurt

835
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:28,359
because you truly do love yourself in a

836
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:31,000
different way not in a fake

837
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:34,480
way in a real way we're going to talk

838
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:37,440
about that in a minute man that's really

839
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:40,000
intense if there's no compassion then

840
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:43,040
your confidence drops away the damage

841
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,480
becomes extreme to your soul and

842
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:47,640
body if you hold that compassion

843
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:50,319
internally if you hold it

844
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:52,560
within you can lose the confidence in it

845
00:35:50,319 --> 00:35:56,880
won't phase you you can lose it and it

846
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:58,200
won't phase you you can fail at anything

847
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:01,200
you can get

848
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:05,040
sick you can be let down but your

849
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,040
compassion to yourself

850
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:11,040
remains whether you believe in

851
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:12,800
yourself or you just lost the belief in

852
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:15,720
yourself compassion will hold it all

853
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:20,040
together it holds it all together for

854
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:22,000
you compassion helps you heal compassion

855
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:24,040
from others to you to fill that

856
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,520
compassion Bank helps you heal so if you

857
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:28,280

858
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:30,000

of

905
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:27,560
peace is having compassion for

906
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:31,440
yourself and that compassion brings

907
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:34,480
peace to your soul it will and it does

908
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:39,160
and if if you have compassion to someone

909
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:41,160
else it'll bring peace to their soul it

910
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:46,280
will it's the

911
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:48,160
creator of Peace it is the creation of

912
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:50,480
Peace that's what compassionate spirit's

913
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,480
telling

914
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:57,280
me and you need to know that peace isn't

915
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:59,640
just about peace on Earth it's not just

916
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:03,640
about and this is coming from Spirit

917
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:05,880
peace isn't just about peace on Earth

918
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:09,560
you know peace isn't just about war and

919
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:12,760
violence and hatred and trying to stop

920
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:15,800
that out there that's not what peace is

921
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:19,560
just about that's not at

922
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:21,960
all peace is about having compassion to

923
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:23,720
yourself so your soul can receive that

924
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:27,200
peace it's about giving somebody else

925
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:30,640
peace in their soul through compassion

926
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:34,560
the presence of

927
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:38,440
compassion and that's really what it's

928
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:40,200
about so listen love is a big topic

929
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,400
these days and it's a big one and we're

930
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:43,319
going to cut through it right here a

931
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,960
little bit with what time we have left

932
00:39:43,319 --> 00:39:46,920
we're going to work on

933
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,280
this

934
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:51,160
self-compassion is not self-love you

935
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:54,400
need to know the difference it's not

936
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:57,800
self-love self-compassion is not

937
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,839
self-love they're not the same thing

938
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:03,560
they're not I promise you they're not

939
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:06,800
you need to know this self-love is okay

940
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:10,480
loving yourself is okay it's not a bad

941
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:14,400
thing if it gets you by you use that

942
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:16,800
until the compassion comes self-love see

943
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:19,079
see self-love it's about loving who you

944
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:21,400
are and it's about appreciating who you

945
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:24,040
are and that's what's good about

946
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:27,119
selflove it's about appreciating who you

947
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:29,680
are and and loving Who You Are

948
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:31,280
and it can reach into accepting who you

949
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:34,760
are loving yourself means you're

950
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:36,160
accepting who you are okay it seems to

951
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:38,880
work

952
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:40,520
perfectly for some people that

953
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:43,560
everything is going

954
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:46,200
perfect everything and it seems to work

955
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:48,880
for some people that need a quick remedy

956
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:51,319
when things aren't going so great but

957
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:53,319
when you really go through a through a

958
00:40:51,319 --> 00:40:55,760
true hardship when you go through an

959
00:40:53,319 --> 00:40:58,040
illness when you get sick when a family

960
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:00,400
member gets get sick when something else

961
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:03,400
happens when struggling happens when a

962
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:05,880
suffering happens the game changes

963
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:08,480
completely you know what self-love turns

964
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:11,560
into something else self-love doesn't

965
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:13,319
mean you're granting yourself healing

966
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:15,160
through self-compassion it's not the

967
00:41:13,319 --> 00:41:17,240
same thing self-compassion is not the

968
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:18,960
same thing as self- Lov at

969
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:23,760
all

970
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:26,359
self-love cannot Grant you peace alone

971
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,839
it's not something that can grant you

972
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:30,920
peace in your soul is self-love alone

973
00:41:28,839 --> 00:41:33,400
and because I'll tell you why when you

974
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:37,000
focus on loving yourself it can

975
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:39,440
accidentally bleed over until in into

976
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,200
loving yourself more than anybody else

977
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,520
around you have you ever met anybody

978
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:45,720
like that they love themselves more than

979
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:49,200
anybody else around them and it's

980
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:50,800
evident and you know it you know it

981
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:55,200
that's what happens when compassion is

982
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:58,240
not in there that's what happens love

983
00:41:55,200 --> 00:42:01,040
love just so you know this is not what

984
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:03,319
keeps two people together in a

985
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:04,920
relationship it's not love I'm going to

986
00:42:03,319 --> 00:42:06,880
tell you right now it's not love that

987
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:09,240
keeps two people together when you're in

988
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:11,640
the throws of a new romance and

989
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:15,079
everything's all hot nice and the

990
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:17,640
finances are flowing or life is Rosy or

991
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:19,240
whatever love can be plenty to hold it

992
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:21,000
together to hold the relationship

993
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:24,000
together especially when it's in that

994
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:26,599
honeymoon stage love can be plenty but

995
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,520
when a challenge comes along and this is

996
00:42:26,599 --> 00:42:30,280
why we have what we have out there right

997
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:32,960
now is so much hardship with

998
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:34,079
relationships and people when a hardship

999
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:37,480
comes

1000
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:41,280
along when a challenge comes along love

1001
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:43,280
is no longer strong enough to keep to

1002
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:46,640
keep a relationship together because

1003
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:49,880
human love is not the creator of Peace

1004
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:53,319
human love can be the creator of hell

1005
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:56,000
too for people I've seen it love is no

1006
00:42:53,319 --> 00:42:57,559
longer enough how many relationships I

1007
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,119
love love you I love you I love you I

1008
00:42:57,559 --> 00:43:01,040
love you until someday something goes

1009
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:03,839
wrong no matter what that is and the

1010
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:06,880
members of the coup will become mortal

1011
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:09,200
enemies loving another can turn into

1012
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:13,480
hating the person very

1013
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:15,880
fast unless unless I'm telling you right

1014
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:18,680
now compassion is involved and that's

1015
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:20,079
how it changes the game that's how it

1016
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:22,079
changes

1017
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:25,559
everything when

1018
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:28,160
compassion is involved in love the

1019
00:43:25,559 --> 00:43:31,599
relationship ship can go through a hard

1020
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:36,400
time and love won't turn into hate or

1021
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:37,480
turn into non love anymore or just turn

1022
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:41,960
into

1023
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:45,640
disinterest it won't when compassion is

1024
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:48,400
involved compassion is the

1025
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:51,200
glue component it's the

1026
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:55,079
glue to a

1027
00:43:51,200 --> 00:44:00,319
relationship it keeps love

1028
00:43:55,079 --> 00:44:03,440
alive it stops love from turning into

1029
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:06,319
hatred or sour

1030
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:07,640
grapes and I hate using grapes as a term

1031
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:09,680
because grapes is such a healing

1032
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:11,599
beautiful fruit it's such a healing

1033
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:13,760
beautiful fruit I don't like using

1034
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:15,559
grapes as a maybe something maybe we'll

1035
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:19,599
come up sour

1036
00:44:15,559 --> 00:44:21,599
eggs sour eggs sour chicken

1037
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:26,760
eggs if

1038
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:30,520
you if you look at love as a fruit as an

1039
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:33,920
apple compassion is its core compassion

1040
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:37,000
is its core how about that that's a lot

1041
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:38,920
better and same goes for self-love you

1042
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,359
can't love yourself without having

1043
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:42,960
self-compassion or it can flip to hating

1044
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:45,559
yourself how many people worked on

1045
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,960
self-love and and it flips on hating

1046
00:44:45,559 --> 00:44:48,839
themselves does that happen to you did

1047
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:51,640
it happen to you that's easy that can

1048
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:53,319
happen to all of us oh my God I love

1049
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:56,680
myself I love myself I'm okay I love

1050
00:44:53,319 --> 00:44:58,960
myself oh my God I hate myself it can

1051
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:00,760
happen too easy because self-compassion

1052
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,920
wasn't involved it wasn't in the mix it

1053
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:05,400
wasn't

1054
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:07,400
there if suddenly you're facing a

1055
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:10,880
chronic illness or an emotional

1056
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:13,440
challenge selflove can vanish it can

1057
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:15,720
disappear it can disappear like nothing

1058
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:17,880
has ever disappeared before in your life

1059
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:19,800
it can literally slip through like sand

1060
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:22,960
in your hand at the beach it could do it

1061
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:25,319
could slip through in your hand like

1062
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,800
water and guess what takes its place

1063
00:45:25,319 --> 00:45:28,359
when it disapp appears when that self-

1064
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,400
Lov disappears guess what takes its

1065
00:45:28,359 --> 00:45:32,880
place self-hatred takes its place just

1066
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:35,400
Falls right in there it's one of the

1067
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:38,640
greatest obstacles to peace it's one of

1068
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:40,520
the greatest obstacles to peace with

1069
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:42,760
when an athlete is

1070
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:45,359
injured self- love can turn into

1071
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:48,040
self-hatred in an instant I've seen it

1072
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:48,040
over and over

1073
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:52,760
again I've seen it the mom who could

1074
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:55,400
take care of everything the mother who

1075
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:57,440
can do everything she can exercise she

1076
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:59,280
can run to the gym she can pick up the

1077
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:01,240
kids at soccer practice she can make

1078
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:02,960
dinner she can take care of her husband

1079
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:05,160
and all the bills in the house and she

1080
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:07,599
could run the household and she can run

1081
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:10,119
and go get a part-time job or not even

1082
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:12,520
whatever it is she can take care of

1083
00:46:10,119 --> 00:46:16,839
everything until symptoms got in the

1084
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:21,400
mom's way and made her doubt

1085
00:46:16,839 --> 00:46:21,400
herself and made her feel like a

1086
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:30,720
failure that should never happen ever

1087
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:33,480
ever ever happen ever it just shouldn't

1088
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:35,880
it shouldn't we have a little compassion

1089
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:38,200
inside of us we get that compassion well

1090
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:41,319
built up and that's not going to happen

1091
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:43,000
it's not it's not if someone around us

1092
00:46:41,319 --> 00:46:46,160
has just a little bit of compassion a

1093
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:50,760
fraction just a a fiber of compassion a

1094
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:52,920
fiber a fiber it can stop that Mom from

1095
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:55,000
feeling that way even if she has no

1096
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:56,480
compassion towards herself whatsoever on

1097
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,720
any level and all all she had was

1098
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:03,000
self-love and that's all she had if

1099
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:06,599
that's all she had if someone else had a

1100
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:11,760
fiber of compassion to share it could

1101
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:15,520
ignite a spark and stop that self-hatred

1102
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:17,000
it can stop that self-hatred when we get

1103
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:19,559
chronically ill and we get told that

1104
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:22,440
it's our genes oh man you better have

1105
00:47:19,559 --> 00:47:25,119
that compassionate compassionate well

1106
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:26,240
get started somehow because that evil

1107
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:28,040
evil not

1108
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:30,319
from the medical industry will try to

1109
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:32,240
tear you down and make you think you're

1110
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:34,000
faulty just because they don't know

1111
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:35,599
what's truly behind chronic illness and

1112
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,240
they make everything look so rosy with

1113
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:39,200
all their geneticists and they make

1114
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:41,119
things everything look so low with the

1115
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:43,559
literature they put out that's paid for

1116
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:45,800
and funded and all

1117
00:47:43,559 --> 00:47:48,040
rigged and they're going to make you

1118
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:50,640
feel like you're

1119
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:53,400
bad because that's the name of the game

1120
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:55,119
it's to break down whatever you got left

1121
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:57,280
in you whatever confidence you got left

1122
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:59,240
in you what whatever compassion you got

1123
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:01,200
left in you but compassion won't break

1124
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:03,520
down under that they just want to break

1125
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:05,520
down whatever self-love whatever

1126
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:07,839
confidence and selflove you have inside

1127
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:10,720
of you they want to break that down and

1128
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:10,720
tear tear it

1129
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:17,240
apart just telling you right now take a

1130
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:18,960
deep breath the misguided attempts to

1131
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:21,800
explain illness out

1132
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:23,720
there like saying you you caused it on

1133
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:26,680
yourself or it's your genes or your body

1134
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:29,880
attacking itself can make you hate every

1135
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:32,200
last fiber in your body they're the

1136
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:34,599
ultimate peace destroyers they're the

1137
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:37,160
ultimate Soul destroyers body mind and

1138
00:48:34,599 --> 00:48:38,240
soul and do not get suckered into it and

1139
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:40,480
if you have a little bit of

1140
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:42,760
self-compassion building up you pat

1141
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:44,880
yourself on the back you listen to this

1142
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:46,880
show over and over again and you get

1143
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,400
that little bit built up and little bit

1144
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:50,240
and some of you may have a ton of it

1145
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,880
already and I wish I can sh I wish I

1146
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:53,920
could take some of that for myself give

1147
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:57,599
me some of that self-compassion I'll

1148
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:57,599
take some more for myself

1149
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:01,400
because I'm human too and I'm up against

1150
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:02,880
all the same things you guys are against

1151
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:04,280
just because I hear spirit and spirit

1152
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,319
knows every bit of this powerful

1153
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:07,839
information every bit of the information

1154
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:09,720
to get you better well I use it for

1155
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:11,319
myself to get me better too I use it for

1156
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:13,760
myself to build that compassion at well

1157
00:49:11,319 --> 00:49:15,599
too that's the whole point and maybe I'm

1158
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:17,839
lucky and blessed in that way because I

1159
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:20,000
get to take spirit's information right

1160
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:22,079
there and he reminds me all the time so

1161
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,559
I can work on keeping my compassionate

1162
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:26,079
levels there keeping it there and I

1163
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:27,680
understand that so that that is great

1164
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:29,440
but I can give that to you too you can

1165
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:31,559
give that back to me too we can all have

1166
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:33,160
this but don't let the peace destroyers

1167
00:49:31,559 --> 00:49:35,040
ruin your mind body and soul and don't

1168
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:38,240
let them just don't let them suck you

1169
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:42,040
dry have some self-compassion get it

1170
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:42,040
deeply rooted if it not already

1171
00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:47,440
is is really

1172
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:51,720
important really important

1173
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:53,280
stuff so we lose touch with all the

1174
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:56,280
compassion for

1175
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:58,520
ourselves if we even held compassion to

1176
00:49:56,280 --> 00:50:01,400
begin with it can disappear when one

1177
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:03,280
acre pain does

1178
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:06,240
come

1179
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:09,079
but we have the ability to ignite it and

1180
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:11,079
Spark it we have the ability to spark it

1181
00:50:09,079 --> 00:50:13,400
back up it's strong it's powerful if it

1182
00:50:11,079 --> 00:50:18,079
was there before like I said it can

1183
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:18,079
ignite faster and easier like never

1184
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:25,799
before the further away self-compassion

1185
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:28,319
feels we feel something's wrong with us

1186
00:50:25,799 --> 00:50:31,280
remember we just need to bring it back

1187
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:33,520
to reel it back in to pull it back in we

1188
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:36,040
just need to bring the self-compassion

1189
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:38,000
back into ourselves we need to bring it

1190
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:40,119
back in because the further it goes the

1191
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,520
way the further we think something's

1192
00:50:40,119 --> 00:50:44,319
wrong with me something's wrong with you

1193
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:46,200
something's wrong with her something's

1194
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:48,440
wrong with him something's wrong with

1195
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:51,160
them we think something's wrong the

1196
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:53,280
minute compassion starts to drift away

1197
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:55,599
and Falls away and further away and

1198
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:57,280
peace destroyers like I said originally

1199
00:50:55,599 --> 00:51:00,640
just a couple of minutes ago can push it

1200
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:03,480
away further don't let it push you away

1201
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:06,480
from compassion whatever you do grab on

1202
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:09,000

1203
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:12,160

Angels if you have to call upon the

1205
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:18,359
Angels any of the Angels any of them

self-hatred will go away you won't

1210
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:31,960

there and you got a little bit of it

1267
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:55,359
already it's there I promise you it's

1268
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:57,640
there and guess what the people

1269
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:59,720
destroyers will not take it away when

1270
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:01,319
they come and they come and they say oh

1271
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:04,000
it's your it's your fault it's your

1272
00:54:01,319 --> 00:54:05,680
fault it's all you to blame or when you

1273
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,599
get that injury and your confidence goes

1274
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:09,680
away or you something happens at work

1275
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:11,319
and you lost your confidence oh no no no

1276
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:13,920
the compassion is there it's to take

1277
00:54:11,319 --> 00:54:15,720
over it's a take over it's to replace

1278
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:19,000
confidence so confidence can come back

1279
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:22,400
over time just have that

1280
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:25,359
confidence but listen The Compassion is

1281
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:27,280
really going to keep it all together and

1282
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:30,200
it's going to make sure that nothing

1283
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:33,480
nothing goes away completely and only

1284
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:35,880
grows from there and gets stronger and

1285
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:38,000
stronger and stronger so your selflove

1286
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:40,200
turns into unconditional love for others

1287
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,359
and for yourself it becomes compassion

1288
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:44,079
and you pat yourself on the back instead

1289
00:54:42,359 --> 00:54:46,280
of self-love that dissipates and turns

1290
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:47,880
to nothing so that relationships you

1291
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:49,720
have get stronger because you have

1292
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:51,400
compassion for your that person and that

1293
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:54,319
person it's infectious they might get a

1294
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:55,799
little compassion too you take one day

1295
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:59,400
