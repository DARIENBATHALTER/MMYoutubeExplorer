[315.68 - 319.12] into this let's talk about this a little
[316.88 - 320.80] bit why anti bug plants what does it
[319.12 - 322.80] even mean like
[320.80 - 325.52] how does it work we got bugs that live
[322.80 - 328.64] inside of us everybody is loaded with
[325.52 - 330.96] bugs some people load it with more bugs
[328.64 - 331.84] some people little less
[330.96 - 333.44] and
[331.84 - 335.84] there's four
[333.44 - 338.64] actually yep four categories okay to
[335.84 - 340.32] think about all right one category is
[338.64 - 342.96] bug fuel
[340.32 - 343.76] so we're eliminating
[342.96 - 347.52] bug
[343.76 - 348.64] fuel so we're eliminating a category of
[347.52 - 352.16] foods
[348.64 - 354.48] that feed the bugs so we're eliminating
[352.16 - 355.36] bug fuel so that's one part that we're
[354.48 - 359.28] gonna do
[355.36 - 362.48] we're also eliminating blood thickeners
[359.28 - 364.64] foods that thicken the blood when you
[362.48 - 368.32] use foods that thicken the blood you
[364.64 - 370.24] never cleanse you never detox you just
[368.32 - 372.96] slowly kill your liver
[370.24 - 374.56] you slowly kill yourself along the way
[372.96 - 376.56] throughout your life
[374.56 - 378.84] all those blood thickeners we're getting
[376.56 - 380.48] rid of another category
[378.84 - 382.32] dehydrator
[380.48 - 383.76] not food dehydrators meaning like if you
[382.32 - 385.60] got a dehydrator something like that you
[383.76 - 388.88] want to make some crackers no no no
[385.60 - 391.92] we're getting rid of a category of foods
[388.88 - 394.64] that dehydrate the body dehydrate the
[391.92 - 396.24] brain dehydrate the blood dehydrate the
[394.64 - 397.68] organs right
[396.24 - 400.88] and then we're getting rid of another
[397.68 - 402.32] category of foods which are toxin
[400.88 - 404.72] contributors
[402.32 - 407.04] we're getting rid of the toxin
[404.72 - 409.12] contributors so we're getting rid of the
[407.04 - 411.12] bug fuel that's one right there we're
[409.12 - 412.80] getting rid of blood thickeners that's
[411.12 - 415.68] another one right there we're getting
[412.80 - 417.36] rid of dehydrators it's another category
[415.68 - 420.08] of foods we're getting rid of toxic
[417.36 - 421.68] contributors another category of foods
[420.08 - 423.92] that's how exciting this is we're
[421.68 - 425.52] getting rid of four
[423.92 - 428.40] categories
[425.52 - 431.68] that end up keeping us from healing
[428.40 - 433.76] keeping us from cleaning out toxins
[431.68 - 437.52] keeping us from killing the bugs that
[433.76 - 439.52] live inside of us and you may say hey aw
[437.52 - 441.28] i don't have any bugs i don't know what

[595.20 - 599.20] is it what are we doing like why are we
[597.28 - 601.44] even doing this and i want to read a
[599.20 - 602.88] little something too in a second about
[601.44 - 604.64] the cleanse
[602.88 - 606.24] but if you guys just got on here it's
[604.64 - 608.72] critical
[606.24 - 609.52] to have the cleanse to heal book
[608.72 - 611.04] right
[609.52 - 613.44] you guys are like hey he's just trying
[611.04 - 615.20] to sell a book well that's funny because
[613.44 - 616.88] i could turn this into a cleanse and
[615.20 - 619.92] sell it for three thousand dollars a
[616.88 - 621.84] ticket take it to a private platform
[619.92 - 623.44] sell it to fifty thousand people or
[621.84 - 625.68] twenty thousand people at three thousand
[623.44 - 628.48] dollars a piece do the math how much can
[625.68 - 630.08] i make but i don't and i'm not going to

[632.24 - 637.04] amazon 51 off but make sure you have the
[635.20 - 638.96] cleanse the heel book it's got the
[637.04 - 640.40] anti-book cleanse in there and when you
[638.96 - 642.24] read the rest of the book your mind will
[640.40 - 643.84] be blown because it's got a lot more in
[642.24 - 646.00] there than that it's got over 200
[643.84 - 648.56] symptoms and conditions it's got 75
[646.00 - 651.52] recipes it's got the causes of chronic
[648.56 - 654.48] illness it's got other cleanses this

[662.72 - 669.04] what i love about the anti-bug cleanse
[664.56 - 671.20] is it makes more room for healing foods
[669.04 - 672.32] it makes more room for healing foods
[671.20 - 674.56] right
[672.32 - 676.40] so when you're making more room for
[674.56 - 679.76] healing foods
[676.40 - 681.76] you're taking away other foods that may
[679.76 - 683.44] not be healing does that look like
[681.76 - 684.80] healing foods to you i'm kind of
[683.44 - 686.56] wondering does that look like healing
[684.80 - 688.56] foods is that going to get rid of all
[686.56 - 691.36] the bugs it's not and i'll talk to talk
[688.56 - 693.92] to you guys why later right the eggs and
[691.36 - 696.24] the butter on that gluten bread the
[693.92 - 698.56] bacon is that gonna get rid of the bugs
[696.24 - 700.40] okay so
[698.56 - 703.44] when you take away
[700.40 - 706.24] these other foods or choose not to use
[703.44 - 707.76] them and then choose to use foods that
[706.24 - 709.68] help heal you
[707.76 - 710.72] like the recipes we're going to do

[952.40 - 956.16] but i got a couple things i want to read
[954.16 - 959.12] to you a little bit real quick if you
[956.16 - 961.68] have a negative association
[959.12 - 964.48] with removing foods from your diet
[961.68 - 966.80] because of past diet protocols where
[964.48 - 968.88] food was eliminated do any any of you
[966.80 - 971.52] guys run into that do you have like a
[968.88 - 973.76] negative association with removing foods
[971.52 - 975.84] because of some kind of elimination diet
[973.76 - 977.12] out there or some other kind of diet out
[975.84 - 978.96] there right
[977.12 - 981.28] where your food was eliminated for
[978.96 - 983.04] example like food allergy diets or food
[981.28 - 984.48] allergy testing
[983.04 - 988.88] please know
[984.48 - 990.64] that those were man made programs
[988.88 - 992.08] gonna say it again
[990.64 - 994.16] if you have a negative association with
[992.08 - 997.04] removing foods from your diet
[994.16 - 998.40] because of ptsd
[997.04 - 1000.08] from past
[998.40 - 1001.52] diets you've done
[1000.08 - 1003.44] and cleanses
[1001.52 - 1006.12] and food elimination
[1003.44 - 1008.96] right please know that those were
[1006.12 - 1012.16] man-made programs
[1008.96 - 1014.56] man-made programs so important to know
[1012.16 - 1016.24] their makers
[1014.56 - 1017.52] their makers the men who made the
[1016.24 - 1019.44] programs
[1017.52 - 1022.40] their makers are unaware
[1019.44 - 1024.24] of what causes chronic illnesses such as
[1022.40 - 1027.44] autoimmune
[1024.24 - 1029.60] okay and how food plays a role they were
[1027.44 - 1032.08] unaware of that going all the way back
[1029.60 - 1033.76] 35 years of doing this that's any time
[1032.08 - 1035.20] i've ever seen any kind of diet or
[1033.76 - 1036.96] cleanse or anything
[1035.20 - 1039.12] nobody was aware of what caused chronic
[1036.96 - 1040.88] illness why somebody was sick with
[1039.12 - 1043.04] autoimmune or chronic fatigue or
[1040.88 - 1045.84] anything else but yet they were creating
[1043.04 - 1047.68] these diets okay
[1045.84 - 1050.40] so that's important to know
[1047.68 - 1053.36] those are guessing games that we don't
[1050.40 - 1054.32] play here so we don't play guessing
[1053.36 - 1055.68] games
[1054.32 - 1057.44] this is about knowing why you're
[1055.68 - 1059.44] eliminating a food
[1057.44 - 1062.40] what happens when you do
[1059.44 - 1064.96] what bugs you're starving because of it
[1062.40 - 1067.28] and how to heal like so many have healed
[1064.96 - 1069.12] this is important so those are guessing
[1067.28 - 1071.28] games out there that we don't play here
[1069.12 - 1074.80] only here
[1071.28 - 1077.12] only here will you find food empowerment
[1074.80 - 1078.72] and the ability to take control of your
[1077.12 - 1080.56] healing
[1078.72 - 1083.76] take control of your healing process
[1080.56 - 1085.52] using real knowledge okay i recommend
[1083.76 - 1087.84] that you consider shifting your thinking
[1085.52 - 1090.64] it's not that you're not allowed
[1087.84 - 1091.76] to eat something i'm not gonna see and
[1090.64 - 1093.68] actually you're not allowed to eat
[1091.76 - 1096.32] something you're not allowed to eat
[1093.68 - 1097.84] something okay you're allowed to eat
[1096.32 - 1099.28] anything you want you you want to eat
[1097.84 - 1100.40] something
[1099.28 - 1102.00] yeah
[1100.40 - 1103.36] look if you want to do this cleanse with
[1102.00 - 1105.36] me and this is what you want to eat for
[1103.36 - 1106.88] four days because that's what your free
[1105.36 - 1108.40] will wants to do
[1106.88 - 1109.92] and that's for some reason of what you
[1108.40 - 1111.84] want to do

[1118.96 - 1124.00] allowed to do anything you could do

[1124.00 - 1128.80] you choose
[1125.92 - 1131.04] choose not to eat the foods that will
[1128.80 - 1133.20] feed the bugs like the cheese and gluten
[1131.04 - 1135.49] pizza or anything i'm hoping that you
[1133.20 - 1136.72] choose to do the cleanse

[1178.96 - 1183.28] right now we're in the anti-book cleanse
[1181.36 - 1185.44] we're doing the preliminary stuff this
[1183.28 - 1187.92] is the prep you guys
[1185.44 - 1189.92] this is the prep we're prepping getting
[1187.92 - 1192.08] ready tomorrow starts three days
[1189.92 - 1193.44] anti-book lens i'm doing all five levels
[1192.08 - 1194.24] you can pick the level you guys want to
[1193.44 - 1196.80] do
[1194.24 - 1198.48] it's gonna be fun right
[1196.80 - 1200.88] so
[1198.48 - 1202.72] this lit this is a list here so you can
[1200.88 - 1204.88] make informed decisions
[1202.72 - 1208.24] so the list is in this book you can make
[1204.88 - 1210.16] for informed decisions on what foods
[1208.24 - 1211.28] that are getting in the way of your life
[1210.16 - 1213.76] right
[1211.28 - 1216.88] let's also be clear that none of the
[1213.76 - 1218.80] foods here are listed as problematic out
[1216.88 - 1221.84] of prejudiced
[1218.80 - 1224.16] against a dietary belief system such as
[1221.84 - 1225.48] veganism
[1224.16 - 1228.80] plant-based
[1225.48 - 1230.48] vegetarianism paleo philosophy or
[1228.80 - 1232.80] ketogenic
[1230.48 - 1236.16] theory
[1232.80 - 1238.64] okay so this isn't about being biased to
[1236.16 - 1240.64] ketogenic being biased to paleo being
[1238.64 - 1243.76] biased to veganism being biased to
[1240.64 - 1246.32] plant-based being bias to vegetarian
[1243.76 - 1247.52] this isn't about that at all
[1246.32 - 1249.96] okay
[1247.52 - 1252.72] nor is this cleanse about
[1249.96 - 1255.36] self-deprivation you guys
[1252.72 - 1258.32] you're gonna be drinking hot spiced
[1255.36 - 1258.32] apple juice
[1258.88 - 1263.60] you're gonna be eating
[1260.80 - 1265.52] delicious recipes
[1263.60 - 1267.60] this is not a cleanse about
[1265.52 - 1269.36] self-deprivation
[1267.60 - 1270.88] starvation
[1269.36 - 1273.04] or shame
[1270.88 - 1275.12] this isn't about shame either i told you
[1273.04 - 1277.76] before if you're not ready to do the
[1275.12 - 1279.36] anti-bug cleanse hang out
[1277.76 - 1281.36] if you're hanging out and you're eating
[1279.36 - 1283.92] pizza i still want you here and i'm not
[1281.36 - 1285.44] shaming you it's a hard world
[1283.92 - 1287.28] some people are just like man i just
[1285.44 - 1288.64] need a slice of pizza
[1287.28 - 1291.44] but i want you to be able to learn
[1288.64 - 1293.84] though you can learn so hang out
[1291.44 - 1294.88] maybe get the book someday
[1293.84 - 1297.52] right
[1294.88 - 1299.60] the foods are listed solely because they
[1297.52 - 1301.76] pose the risk
[1299.60 - 1305.20] that you will not succeed with your
[1301.76 - 1306.88] cleansing or healing process
[1305.20 - 1308.80] that's what it is
[1306.88 - 1310.16] so it's important
[1308.80 - 1312.56] give you a quick
[1310.16 - 1314.40] rundown on the medical medium
[1312.56 - 1316.56] books here in this book
[1314.40 - 1318.00] they got the street cred
[1316.56 - 1319.76] millions around the world have gotten
[1318.00 - 1321.12] their lives back they're healing
[1319.76 - 1323.20] everywhere
[1321.12 - 1324.88] it's the thing that moves the needle or
[1323.20 - 1326.80] the medical medium books medical medium
[1324.88 - 1329.12] book series when people use it and apply
[1326.80 - 1331.68] it properly they move the needle and
[1329.12 - 1334.16] they get their lives back
[1331.68 - 1335.76] and that's already happened so this
[1334.16 - 1337.28] isn't this thing where i came out with a
[1335.76 - 1338.96] book for the first time and it's an
[1337.28 - 1340.96] experiment and i'm hoping to get one or
[1338.96 - 1343.52] two people better and maybe i will
[1340.96 - 1345.60] someday and hey maybe i can get my book
[1343.52 - 1346.72] known or something no
[1345.60 - 1348.80] he's number one new york times
[1346.72 - 1351.04] best-selling books they're saving lives
[1348.80 - 1353.84] they already have it's happened around
[1351.04 - 1355.76] the world and before the books came out
[1353.84 - 1357.68] people came from all over the world to
[1355.76 - 1359.92] my office got the information they
[1357.68 - 1362.88] needed and got their lives back for over
[1359.92 - 1365.60] 35 years so this is exciting this is the
[1362.88 - 1368.24] anti-bug cleanse it's a free

[1426.64 - 1429.28] so let's talk about the cleanse a little
[1428.56 - 1431.52] bit
[1429.28 - 1433.52] why not
[1431.52 - 1435.12] 16 ounces of celery juice now if you're
[1433.52 - 1436.08] somebody that's already doing 32 ounces
[1435.12 - 1438.56] and that's what you're doing every
[1436.08 - 1440.80] single day these 32 ounces of celery
[1438.56 - 1443.12] juice but 16 ounces to celery juice
[1440.80 - 1445.36] every single morning okay
[1443.12 - 1447.44] keep out the troublemaker foods that
[1445.36 - 1449.52] you're picking the level you're picking
[1447.44 - 1451.44] whether it's level one level two level
[1449.52 - 1454.96] three level four right
[1451.44 - 1456.64] drink at least 32 ounces or a liter of
[1454.96 - 1459.68] water every day
[1456.64 - 1461.92] you can sip coconut water make sure your
[1459.68 - 1463.52] coconut water if you like coconut water
[1461.92 - 1465.84] you don't have to sip or use coconut
[1463.52 - 1469.92] water but if you are
[1465.84 - 1472.64] make sure your coconut water is not red
[1469.92 - 1475.68] make sure it's not pink
[1472.64 - 1478.48] okay that's toxic coconut water
[1475.68 - 1479.92] i know a trend passed around because the
[1478.48 - 1481.68] coconut water industry didn't want to
[1479.92 - 1482.96] lose millions and millions and millions
[1481.68 - 1484.72] hundreds of millions of dollars over the
[1482.96 - 1486.32] years so they convinced everybody they
[1484.72 - 1489.12] lied
[1486.32 - 1490.56] a zinger alert zinger alert
[1489.12 - 1492.96] they lied
[1490.56 - 1495.04] and they said that the pink red to pink
[1492.96 - 1497.60] to darker red and the darker the color
[1495.04 - 1499.12] of the coconut water going red
[1497.60 - 1500.56] is actually good for you and that's the
[1499.12 - 1503.52] best coconut water
[1500.56 - 1506.32] that was a gross disgusting lie
[1503.52 - 1509.60] the coconut water industry
[1506.32 - 1511.76] i mean it's oxidated it's shot the
[1509.60 - 1513.84] coconut water went bad
[1511.76 - 1515.20] and that's what happens when it goes red
[1513.84 - 1516.80] singer alert that's all that's what
[1515.20 - 1517.60] happens when it goes red keep that in
[1516.80 - 1519.36] mind
[1517.60 - 1522.72] and what happens is when they're getting
[1519.36 - 1524.64] all that coconut water shipped overseas
[1522.72 - 1526.24] and it turned red
[1524.64 - 1528.72] or it's turning red because it's getting
[1526.24 - 1531.12] old they don't want to lose their shirts
[1528.72 - 1532.96] so that red pink that pink to red
[1531.12 - 1535.68] coconut water
[1532.96 - 1537.92] is oxidative and gone bad and then they
[1535.68 - 1539.84] sell it in the health food stores
[1537.92 - 1541.28] pretending that that's the best stuff
[1539.84 - 1543.84] that's how many tricks are out there of
[1541.28 - 1545.60] the trade anyway use coconut water
[1543.84 - 1547.84] that's not like that
[1545.60 - 1550.56] keep that in mind so
[1547.84 - 1551.44] zinger alert you're being screwed over
[1550.56 - 1553.20] like
[1551.44 - 1554.64] so many things happen in the alternative
[1553.20 - 1557.20] movement non-stop
[1554.64 - 1559.28] and uh and i love making no friends
[1557.20 - 1561.60] because of it because then i'll piss
[1559.28 - 1563.44] somebody else off because
[1561.60 - 1565.52] man once you get that word out there and
[1563.44 - 1566.80] stuff people start getting you know mad
[1565.52 - 1568.48] again it's like what are you gonna do
[1566.80 - 1570.80] it's like if i don't have your back what
[1568.48 - 1572.56] what am i supposed to be not be be
[1570.80 - 1574.40] afraid i can't make any friends out
[1572.56 - 1575.84] there and i'll turn movement i don't
[1574.40 - 1577.04] want to play that game i just got to
[1575.84 - 1579.04] have your back people who are
[1577.04 - 1580.72] chronically ill don't have time to waste
[1579.04 - 1583.44] and they have to heal and that's what
[1580.72 - 1585.12] it's about at medical medium okay
[1583.44 - 1587.12] so all right
[1585.12 - 1589.28] so the recipes in the book if you want
[1587.12 - 1591.04] to choose other recipes in the book say
[1589.28 - 1593.52] you don't want to make the recipe that
[1591.04 - 1595.52] i'm going to be making tomorrow
[1593.52 - 1597.52] right the potato salad
[1595.52 - 1599.60] so you don't want to make that recipe
[1597.52 - 1601.04] say you want to make a different recipe
[1599.60 - 1602.00] you don't want to make the potato salad
[1601.04 - 1603.92] tomorrow because i'm making that
[1602.00 - 1607.04] tomorrow that's okay if you want to do a
[1603.92 - 1608.64] different recipe totally on board okay
[1607.04 - 1610.08] and say you don't want to do your
[1608.64 - 1611.20] portobello stew
[1610.08 - 1613.36] because you don't like portobello
[1611.20 - 1614.88] mushrooms that's okay
[1613.36 - 1616.88] maybe keep the portobello mushrooms out
[1614.88 - 1620.40] or something make it the way you want to
[1616.88 - 1622.80] make it right that's perfectly fine
[1620.40 - 1624.72] so this is not a restricted diet you can
[1622.80 - 1626.64] eat all day that's the cool thing you
[1624.72 - 1628.56] want to make a big portobello stew and
[1626.64 - 1630.56] you want to eat that all day long and
[1628.56 - 1631.92] you can do that that's what's awesome
[1630.56 - 1634.16] about that
[1631.92 - 1636.96] and there's the portobello herb stuffed
[1634.16 - 1638.32] peppers i'm making on the third day i
[1636.96 - 1639.60] think i'm making that on the third day
[1638.32 - 1640.56] yeah third day
[1639.60 - 1642.40] right
[1640.56 - 1644.24] so if for some reason you don't like
[1642.40 - 1646.00] peppers you want to pick another recipe
[1644.24 - 1647.52] inside the book pick another recipe in
[1646.00 - 1650.40] the book but i'm hoping you make the fun
[1647.52 - 1651.60] stuff with me right
[1650.40 - 1653.52] so
[1651.60 - 1655.44] let's talk about the levels that's the
[1653.52 - 1657.84] next part so let's cover levels for a
[1655.44 - 1660.96] little bit so this is fun
[1657.84 - 1663.20] level one you want to keep out certain
[1660.96 - 1665.12] foods okay
[1663.20 - 1667.12] so let's bring in some foods in level
[1665.12 - 1668.56] one level one
[1667.12 - 1670.48] right
[1668.56 - 1672.16] you want to keep these out
[1670.48 - 1674.56] this is critical
[1672.16 - 1677.28] this is bug fuel
[1674.56 - 1679.52] i'm not ranking on eggs
[1677.28 - 1681.44] eggs were a good survival food for years
[1679.52 - 1684.24] and years and years out there
[1681.44 - 1685.92] i was never anti-egg
[1684.24 - 1688.32] but what happened was
[1685.92 - 1690.32] classified medical research in science
[1688.32 - 1692.00] before 1920
[1690.32 - 1694.08] took the egg
[1692.00 - 1696.16] and they learned they can grow pathogens
[1694.08 - 1699.36] inside there because the eggs can eat
[1696.16 - 1701.28] undeveloped protein from the egg so that
[1699.36 - 1703.04] i mean the bugs can eat under
[1701.28 - 1704.40] protein from the egg so they they
[1703.04 - 1706.96] learned
[1704.40 - 1709.68] that eggs feed all the bugs
[1706.96 - 1712.32] and so they raised all the pathogens
[1709.68 - 1713.92] the plague that everybody's freaking out
[1712.32 - 1715.04] about right now
[1713.92 - 1716.16] came from
[1715.04 - 1718.16] eggs
[1716.16 - 1719.20] meaning they were raised in eggs in the
[1718.16 - 1721.52] labs
[1719.20 - 1723.92] right so it's important to know so every
[1721.52 - 1725.12] bug you deal with your simplex fever
[1723.92 - 1727.12] blister
[1725.12 - 1729.04] or your simplex 2
[1727.12 - 1730.64] genital herpes or whatever you got going
[1729.04 - 1731.92] on in your life that you want to clean
[1730.64 - 1734.16] up and heal
[1731.92 - 1737.28] or your mono or whatever it is
[1734.16 - 1738.96] came originally grown out of eggs
[1737.28 - 1741.04] from classified medical research in
[1738.96 - 1742.72] science and then was released into the
[1741.04 - 1744.56] public hiv
[1742.72 - 1746.72] was grown out of eggs
[1744.56 - 1748.32] and then released into the public person
[1746.72 - 1750.40] purposely
[1748.32 - 1752.00] so that people would get hiv
[1750.40 - 1753.44] that's how classified medical research
[1752.00 - 1755.12] and science does it
[1753.44 - 1756.08] public medical research science doesn't
[1755.12 - 1757.28] know this
[1756.08 - 1760.00] so
[1757.28 - 1761.20] you eat the eggs and every single bug in
[1760.00 - 1762.72] your body
[1761.20 - 1764.40] has a field day
[1762.72 - 1766.96] and starts to eat
[1764.40 - 1768.72] so we're taking away the eggs
[1766.96 - 1771.44] that's on level one
[1768.72 - 1772.72] so can you do it can you break away from
[1771.44 - 1774.80] the eggs
[1772.72 - 1777.68] can you break away from the bug feeders
[1774.80 - 1780.64] right there so that's one
[1777.68 - 1784.08] another thing too now level one in level
[1780.64 - 1784.88] one right here says dairy products
[1784.08 - 1787.52] so
[1784.88 - 1789.60] can you get rid of the stick of butter
[1787.52 - 1791.12] can you get rid of the cheese
[1789.60 - 1792.56] can you get rid of the cheese sticks
[1791.12 - 1794.48] right can you get rid of any kind of
[1792.56 - 1796.64] cheese
[1794.48 - 1798.56] cheese will feed the bugs too
[1796.64 - 1800.32] can you get rid of the milk cheese and
[1798.56 - 1802.48] the butter so that's one thing right
[1800.32 - 1804.00] there to get rid of
[1802.48 - 1806.32] okay
[1804.00 - 1808.40] gluten that's the next one so let's get
[1806.32 - 1810.72] rid of gluten right so we've got a slice
[1808.40 - 1812.64] of bread right here
[1810.72 - 1813.76] got a slice of bread can you get rid of
[1812.64 - 1815.92] the bread
[1813.76 - 1818.64] now that's not like straight white
[1815.92 - 1821.12] processed flour bread but still
[1818.64 - 1823.68] this was and it was toasted up with some
[1821.12 - 1826.48] cheese inside right so can you get rid
[1823.68 - 1829.84] of like the bread and the cheese
[1826.48 - 1832.32] so this is level one level one also says
[1829.84 - 1836.64] no soft drinks
[1832.32 - 1838.64] no soft drinks on level one
[1836.64 - 1839.92] so no soft drinks
[1838.64 - 1842.08] right
[1839.92 - 1845.36] that's important to know
[1842.08 - 1847.60] no gluten which was the bread right the
[1845.36 - 1850.96] wheat gluten so you can read the book
[1847.60 - 1852.24] for more details but that's level one
[1850.96 - 1853.68] and that's what i'm in right here
[1852.24 - 1855.20] cleanse the heel
[1853.68 - 1856.88] now maybe you're somebody that you just
[1855.20 - 1858.24] wanna do level one
[1856.88 - 1860.64] totally cool
[1858.24 - 1862.08] totally cool happy you're here if you're
[1860.64 - 1864.00] somebody that doesn't wanna do level one
[1862.08 - 1866.24] and you just you just to have some
[1864.00 - 1868.24] buttered toast and watch the gig i'm
[1866.24 - 1870.80] happy you're here okay maybe you'll
[1868.24 - 1873.36] learn some stuff it'll be fun right
[1870.80 - 1876.08] let's go into level two so can you guys
[1873.36 - 1878.24] do level two level two
[1876.08 - 1879.84] is the same as level one you you get rid
[1878.24 - 1881.92] of those first you get rid of the eggs
[1879.84 - 1886.72] the milk the cheese the butter
[1881.92 - 1888.80] gone but level two has additional foods
[1886.72 - 1891.60] like pork
[1888.80 - 1892.64] so that's when you get rid of the pork
[1891.60 - 1894.72] so
[1892.64 - 1897.28] you get the pork out of there that's a
[1894.72 - 1899.28] big one too so that means like the bacon
[1897.28 - 1901.44] the pork so i got some bacon on this
[1899.28 - 1904.00] dish right here right so that's the
[1901.44 - 1907.04] bacon so level two is getting rid of
[1904.00 - 1909.04] pork now that's what we need to do
[1907.04 - 1909.92] it's level two
[1909.04 - 1912.80] okay
[1909.92 - 1913.52] pork is a blood thickener i just showed
[1912.80 - 1915.68] you
[1913.52 - 1917.84] bug fuel right which is the eggs the
[1915.68 - 1919.76] dairy the milk the cheese the butter
[1917.84 - 1922.80] that's bug fuel
[1919.76 - 1924.32] now i'm showing you blood thickeners
[1922.80 - 1926.32] pork right
[1924.32 - 1931.36] let's move to another one too so we're
[1926.32 - 1933.20] in level two right the next one is tuna
[1931.36 - 1934.88] so now we're talking about tuna so this
[1933.20 - 1937.28] is sushi
[1934.88 - 1940.16] so whether you open a can of tuna fish
[1937.28 - 1942.64] or you open a pack of tuna
[1940.16 - 1945.28] keeping tuna out is critical we're in
[1942.64 - 1947.28] level two level two is not just eggs
[1945.28 - 1950.00] dairy gluten milk cheese butter gluten
[1947.28 - 1952.16] right and soft drinks level two
[1950.00 - 1953.68] is pork
[1952.16 - 1954.96] tuna
[1953.68 - 1956.72] right
[1954.96 - 1959.04] and corn
[1956.72 - 1961.68] pork tuna and corn
[1959.04 - 1963.44] that's level two
[1961.68 - 1966.40] keeping those out so what happens if
[1963.44 - 1968.00] you're gonna have corn tortillas
[1966.40 - 1969.44] taco shells
[1968.00 - 1970.32] made of corn
[1969.44 - 1972.72] right
[1970.32 - 1974.00] any kind of popcorn how many of you guys
[1972.72 - 1975.76] are still like
[1974.00 - 1977.84] cooking up and popping popcorn thinking
[1975.76 - 1980.00] you guys are like in the safe zone
[1977.84 - 1982.32] you're popping organic popcorn every
[1980.00 - 1984.56] single night or on the weekends right
[1982.32 - 1988.32] and you think you're in the safe zone oh
[1984.56 - 1990.24] those feed bugs corn will feed the bugs
[1988.32 - 1992.80] because it's it's all contaminated it's
[1990.24 - 1995.52] all gmo and they use corn
[1992.80 - 1997.44] right in the pharmaceutical world that's
[1995.52 - 2000.32] how they make your drugs they use corn
[1997.44 - 2002.64] to make all your drugs gmo corn they use
[2000.32 - 2003.60] corn now also to still feed bugs in the
[2002.64 - 2004.96] labs
[2003.60 - 2007.12] okay
[2004.96 - 2010.24] so we're level two
[2007.12 - 2012.00] we will go into levels more tomorrow i'm
[2010.24 - 2014.56] gonna make some hot apple juice so
[2012.00 - 2016.32] there's level three there's level four
[2014.56 - 2018.24] there's level five
[2016.32 - 2020.40] right so let me make some hot spiced
[2018.24 - 2023.12] apple juice so make sure you're ready
[2020.40 - 2025.52] this is the pre-cleanse day so this is
[2023.12 - 2027.52] the preliminary to the cleanse it starts
[2025.52 - 2030.00] tomorrow i'm really pumped out i'm
[2027.52 - 2031.84] really excited right
[2030.00 - 2035.20] so that was you my god doing all the
[2031.84 - 2037.36] corn even organic corn even organic corn
[2035.20 - 2040.16] it'll feed the bugs now what i've always
[2037.36 - 2043.20] said with corn like organic corn if you
[2040.16 - 2044.80] wanted to use it sparingly and carefully
[2043.20 - 2046.40] throughout the summer or something
[2044.80 - 2048.48] because you wanted you know to put some
[2046.40 - 2051.52] corn in a dish you want to have that
[2048.48 - 2053.68] roasted corn on the cob keep keep it
[2051.52 - 2055.12] under control where you're just doing a
[2053.68 - 2056.88] little here and there but if you're sick
[2055.12 - 2058.56] with chronic illness like really sick
[2056.88 - 2060.32] you've got something going on and you're
[2058.56 - 2062.16] really struggling i would keep the corn
[2060.32 - 2065.20] out all together because it could feed
[2062.16 - 2067.76] the bugs even organic corn can so keep
[2065.20 - 2069.92] that in mind i'm gonna make some
[2067.76 - 2072.72] hot apple
[2069.92 - 2074.88] spice juice right got two options okay
[2072.72 - 2076.72] so i got apple i'm gonna i got the apple
[2074.88 - 2078.48] juice itself so you can go and pick up
[2076.72 - 2082.08] an apple juice and organic apple juice
[2078.48 - 2084.72] right you go pick one up you can um use
[2082.08 - 2086.64] that if you need to it's perfectly fine
[2084.72 - 2088.24] right as long as it does as long as it's
[2086.64 - 2090.24] not like some apple juice it's got all
[2088.24 - 2092.32] the citric acid in there or all these
[2090.24 - 2094.24] natural flavors in there if it's just
[2092.32 - 2096.08] pure straight
[2094.24 - 2097.92] apple juice
[2096.08 - 2099.84] you can use it if you want you can pour
[2097.92 - 2102.08] it into your pot
[2099.84 - 2104.16] you can make you can make your hot
[2102.08 - 2106.08] spiced apple juice pour it into the pot
[2104.16 - 2109.68] in the whole bit that's one option you
[2106.08 - 2111.36] can also juice fresh apples too
[2109.68 - 2113.20] so you can do that so i'm going to juice
[2111.36 - 2114.08] a little bit of some fresh apples right
[2113.20 - 2117.36] here
[2114.08 - 2119.44] so i'm going to do that
[2117.36 - 2122.80] and this is an option too you guys can
[2119.44 - 2122.80] do which is perfectly fine
[2123.12 - 2126.56] you just run some apples to the juicer
[2125.04 - 2128.64] if you'd like
[2126.56 - 2130.40] that's an option
[2128.64 - 2132.80] just going to cut up some apple slices
[2130.40 - 2132.80] right now
[2133.20 - 2138.88] what i love about the anti-bug cleanse
[2136.32 - 2140.32] is that it gets rid of bugs that control
[2138.88 - 2141.92] your life
[2140.32 - 2143.60] because if you're sick and going to the
[2141.92 - 2146.00] doctor all the time and you're doing
[2143.60 - 2147.60] your doctor visits all the time and
[2146.00 - 2150.16] that's that's a big part of your life
[2147.60 - 2152.16] where you have to you have to make your
[2150.16 - 2154.08] doctor appointments okay i gotta go see
[2152.16 - 2155.60] this doctor about this skin problem now
[2154.08 - 2158.08] i have to see the doctor because i don't
[2155.60 - 2160.48] feel good now the doctors you know
[2158.08 - 2162.72] drawing all your blood and knocking down
[2160.48 - 2165.84] your immune system by drawing too much
[2162.72 - 2169.12] blood out of you you become like a slave
[2165.84 - 2171.44] to the industry a slave to
[2169.12 - 2174.72] what the bugs are doing inside of you
[2171.44 - 2177.84] you know like you're becoming a slave to
[2174.72 - 2179.36] to basically the world of bugs and the
[2177.84 - 2180.24] medical industry
[2179.36 - 2182.56] and
[2180.24 - 2184.64] that's not a like a great place to be
[2182.56 - 2187.68] that's not a fun place to be like i
[2184.64 - 2189.84] don't want to be um controlled by bugs
[2187.68 - 2192.56] and then controlled by big pharma too
[2189.84 - 2194.80] like who wants to be controlled by bugs
[2192.56 - 2197.36] and big pharma and here's the crazy
[2194.80 - 2199.44] thing big pharma the classified medical
[2197.36 - 2201.92] research and science part of big pharma
[2199.44 - 2204.00] is what made all the bugs so that's why
[2201.92 - 2206.16] you're sick to begin with you're sick
[2204.00 - 2209.84] because they made you sick and then they
[2206.16 - 2212.96] exposed you just like the hiv right
[2209.84 - 2215.60] you know the hiv they stuck all that hiv
[2212.96 - 2217.28] and all that blood that tainted blood
[2215.60 - 2219.52] and then they pumped it into people
[2217.28 - 2220.32] right that was one thing right there i
[2219.52 - 2222.56] mean
[2220.32 - 2224.00] you know they've actually spread hiv in
[2222.56 - 2226.88] a lot of different ways throughout the
[2224.00 - 2228.96] years purposely so that people would
[2226.88 - 2230.72] actually get sick right and they're
[2228.96 - 2232.32] doing they're doing it with every single
[2230.72 - 2235.28] thing with
[2232.32 - 2237.12] with the epstein bars
[2235.28 - 2240.48] i said once again i said in the past
[2237.12 - 2243.36] woodstock isn't is it how simplex and
[2240.48 - 2245.68] herpes got around it wasn't because of
[2243.36 - 2248.00] free sex and woodstock
[2245.68 - 2249.28] they put those bugs out there
[2248.00 - 2251.68] and
[2249.28 - 2254.40] they they put them out into the system
[2251.68 - 2257.76] they contaminated the system
[2254.40 - 2260.00] they actually infected people purposely
[2257.76 - 2262.72] that's what medical research and science
[2260.00 - 2265.68] did so keep that in mind of how it works
[2262.72 - 2267.60] so any reason why you're sick
[2265.68 - 2269.84] is because of that and then people yes
[2267.60 - 2272.56] people spread them of course but they
[2269.84 - 2274.72] knew that they knew people would spread
[2272.56 - 2277.52] the bugs they actually knew people would
[2274.72 - 2277.52] spread the bugs
[2277.84 - 2281.84] so it's like if you're if you're
[2280.08 - 2283.52] somebody who's living with a condition
[2281.84 - 2285.60] of any kind
[2283.52 - 2287.06] you're living with the bugs and if
[2285.60 - 2288.48] you're living with the bugs
[2287.06 - 2290.80] [Music]
[2288.48 - 2292.72] they're controlling a part of your life
[2290.80 - 2294.32] they're they're actually pushing you
[2292.72 - 2295.92] into
[2294.32 - 2299.60] they're pushing you into the doctor's
[2295.92 - 2302.08] offices you have to get prescriptions
[2299.60 - 2303.68] all the time right you got a thyroid
[2302.08 - 2305.36] problem and you have to live on thyroid
[2303.68 - 2307.36] medication well the bugs are doing that
[2305.36 - 2309.52] because the epstein bars is the whole
[2307.36 - 2311.92] reason for the thyroid problem you got
[2309.52 - 2314.56] hypothyroidism that's epstein-barr so
[2311.92 - 2317.20] why are we doing the anti-bug plants
[2314.56 - 2319.92] i think about it we're doing it so we
[2317.20 - 2322.40] can start knocking back the epscene bar
[2319.92 - 2325.20] knocking back the simplexes knocking
[2322.40 - 2326.96] back that shingles people think they
[2325.20 - 2328.40] skate free
[2326.96 - 2330.80] people think they skate free and they're
[2328.40 - 2333.28] going to be fine and then they have
[2330.80 - 2336.00] if you can like fast forward someone
[2333.28 - 2337.92] into the future like a healthy seemingly
[2336.00 - 2339.92] healthy 20 year old who's feels
[2337.92 - 2341.84] indestructible who has no problems if
[2339.92 - 2343.84] you can fast forward them to when
[2341.84 - 2345.28] they're 60 years old and they get a
[2343.84 - 2346.88] shingles breakout all through their
[2345.28 - 2349.92] mouth and throat and then want to kill
[2346.88 - 2351.52] themselves commit suicide
[2349.92 - 2353.20] it's happened you don't think the 60
[2351.52 - 2354.48] year olds or the 55 year olds to get
[2353.20 - 2356.48] shingles all through their mouth and
[2354.48 - 2358.08] their throat and the roof of their mouth
[2356.48 - 2360.16] you don't think they weren't they were
[2358.08 - 2362.00] 20 at one point and weren't like
[2360.16 - 2363.92] exercising and playing sports and
[2362.00 - 2365.76] feeling indestructible and now they're
[2363.92 - 2367.36] 54 years old shingles all down their
[2365.76 - 2370.48] throat and they want to die and they're
[2367.36 - 2372.32] on morphine in the hospital
[2370.48 - 2375.20] these bugs are in everybody and they
[2372.32 - 2376.22] come out and they come out in the most
[2375.20 - 2378.08] crazy ways
[2376.22 - 2379.20] [Music]
[2378.08 - 2381.12] so
[2379.20 - 2383.04] medical medium information is
[2381.12 - 2386.40] reactivated epstein-barr if you heard of
[2383.04 - 2388.16] epstein-barr reactivated
[2386.40 - 2389.92] if you've heard that
[2388.16 - 2392.40] public medical research and science
[2389.92 - 2394.56] didn't know epstein-barr caused
[2392.40 - 2396.24] neurological symptoms and reactivated
[2394.56 - 2398.64] that's medical medium information so if
[2396.24 - 2400.40] you hear that from a podcast doctor it
[2398.64 - 2401.92] was taken from medical medium
[2400.40 - 2404.08] information
[2401.92 - 2405.68] because that's where it was first no one
[2404.08 - 2407.60] knew and it's years of teaching this and
[2405.68 - 2409.92] years of teaching doctors nobody knew
[2407.60 - 2411.84] any of that they didn't know that that's
[2409.92 - 2414.24] how it worked they didn't know
[2411.84 - 2415.84] uh epstein-barr reactivated they didn't
[2414.24 - 2418.00] know epstein barr
[2415.84 - 2420.24] had a second or third fourth life and
[2418.00 - 2422.04] reactivated over and over again
[2420.24 - 2423.68] they didn't know that epstein-barr
[2422.04 - 2425.20] [Music]
[2423.68 - 2426.48] is long haul
[2425.20 - 2428.48] uh play
[2426.48 - 2430.24] that's all that's that's that's all uh
[2428.48 - 2432.32] that all that i've seen bar information
[2430.24 - 2434.16] is medical medium information originally
[2432.32 - 2436.80] so if you're here doubting why am i
[2434.16 - 2438.96] listening to this guy and his anti-bug
[2436.80 - 2440.72] cleanse well
[2438.96 - 2443.12] that information is originally medical
[2440.72 - 2444.96] medium just so you know so
[2443.12 - 2448.00] what i'm doing is i'm juicing a fresh
[2444.96 - 2448.00] apple juice right now
[2448.08 - 2453.04] if you guys are interested in the mm-900
[2450.32 - 2455.60] hds wait for the sale
[2453.04 - 2457.12] wait for a sale
[2455.60 - 2459.44] i'm just saying because i know i'm going
[2457.12 - 2461.52] to get a billion questions about
[2459.44 - 2464.00] juicing so i'm trying to head it off at
[2461.52 - 2464.00] the pass
[2464.96 - 2469.28] so i'm what i'm doing is i'm making some
[2466.72 - 2470.96] fresh apple juice right now
[2469.28 - 2472.96] i'm going to put it in there
[2470.96 - 2475.93] in the pot so i'm going to make that
[2472.96 - 2477.84] fresh hot spiced apple juice
[2475.93 - 2480.40] [Music]
[2477.84 - 2482.16] which i'm excited about now there's
[2480.40 - 2483.20] honey crisps out there right now you
[2482.16 - 2485.12] guys
[2483.20 - 2487.76] and like i said you can do bottle juice
[2485.12 - 2489.20] if you want to do an organic clean
[2487.76 - 2491.20] bottle juice
[2489.20 - 2494.16] you can do that like you know without
[2491.20 - 2496.24] citric acid put in there without natural
[2494.16 - 2498.72] flavors put in there so that's important
[2496.24 - 2500.64] to know what i like about the spicy hot
[2498.72 - 2501.92] apple juice it tastes so good it's
[2500.64 - 2506.40] insane
[2501.92 - 2508.40] you can use any kind of apples right
[2506.40 - 2510.24] you may not want to use green apples
[2508.40 - 2512.00] though so you may not want to use green
[2510.24 - 2513.36] apples green apples don't usually come
[2512.00 - 2514.80] out that great
[2513.36 - 2517.92] they don't they don't come out that
[2514.80 - 2519.20] tasty they don't come out that great
[2517.92 - 2520.64] [Music]
[2519.20 - 2522.32] what i love about
[2520.64 - 2524.16] you can use any juicer you have what i
[2522.32 - 2525.84] love about this juicer is with food
[2524.16 - 2528.16] costs going up all it does is save you
[2525.84 - 2529.52] money which is incredible and really
[2528.16 - 2532.40] really
[2529.52 - 2534.72] like puts the pressure on whatever
[2532.40 - 2537.12] you're juicing so that you squeeze every
[2534.72 - 2538.72] last juice like drop a juice and that's
[2537.12 - 2540.24] what i love about it
[2538.72 - 2542.00] i'm gonna cut up some more apples real
[2540.24 - 2543.44] quick you guys
[2542.00 - 2545.52] i might have enough and then i could
[2543.44 - 2549.48] also add some too which is great
[2545.52 - 2549.48] i mean i could juice but
[2550.00 - 2555.12] and i'm gonna make it again during the
[2551.44 - 2555.12] cleanse too probably in the whole bit
[2556.08 - 2559.36] i'm gonna pop this right in
[2561.76 - 2568.72] i'm excited so that's incredible
[2565.28 - 2568.72] and move the juicer over
[2574.88 - 2578.44] get the book here
[2580.00 - 2583.76] all right so i got this heating up i'm
[2581.36 - 2586.08] gonna throw some spices in here too
[2583.76 - 2587.68] so i got some cinnamon sticks now you
[2586.08 - 2589.28] don't have to use cinnamon sticks so you
[2587.68 - 2591.28] can just use some cinnamon if you really
[2589.28 - 2593.44] want to but i'm gonna use the cinnamon
[2591.28 - 2596.00] sticks okay so i'm going to pop i'm
[2593.44 - 2598.24] going to break one all right
[2596.00 - 2599.84] pop that in there okay
[2598.24 - 2601.12] i'm going to add also a little bit of
[2599.84 - 2603.44] the bottle stuff because i want you guys
[2601.12 - 2606.44] to know that that's an option
[2603.44 - 2606.44] so
[2607.20 - 2610.56] it's a clean apple juice which you
[2608.96 - 2612.48] really like it's got no natural flavors
[2610.56 - 2614.72] got no you know citric acid always check
[2612.48 - 2616.24] is whatever apple juice you find make
[2614.72 - 2618.16] sure it's you know you do the organic
[2616.24 - 2619.92] apple juice and make sure it doesn't
[2618.16 - 2621.60] have that citric acid or anything so i
[2619.92 - 2623.04] just put some cinnamon sticks in there i
[2621.60 - 2625.28] could put one more
[2623.04 - 2625.28] too
[2625.43 - 2630.40] [Music]
[2627.44 - 2632.80] let that do its thing this tastes so
[2630.40 - 2635.28] good it's insane
[2632.80 - 2636.72] i'm gonna pop some cloves in here
[2635.28 - 2640.00] too
[2636.72 - 2640.00] i'm gonna pop a few of those
[2640.08 - 2643.28] right and you know what the weather and
[2641.76 - 2647.36] everything this is just such a great
[2643.28 - 2649.84] thing oh my god a little bit of nutmeg

[2649.84 - 2653.36] i'm gonna take a little bit of ginger
[2651.76 - 2655.44] pop a little bit of ginger in there so
[2653.36 - 2658.00] you can use fresh ginger
[2655.44 - 2662.00] perfectly fine
[2658.00 - 2664.16] okay i got this simmering
[2662.00 - 2664.16] so
[2664.48 - 2670.00] everybody has a bug in them
[2666.80 - 2672.40] whether they know it or they don't
[2670.00 - 2673.92] hepatitis c when you see people getting
[2672.40 - 2676.32] hepatitis c
[2673.92 - 2678.32] that's epstein-barr gone wrong so that's
[2676.32 - 2680.32] epsilon sitting in somebody's liver for
[2678.32 - 2683.28] so many years that they eventually get
[2680.32 - 2685.76] the hepatitis c diagnosis see
[2683.28 - 2688.64] so and if you got a reproductive system
[2685.76 - 2691.60] problem if you have endometriosis
[2688.64 - 2694.80] those are bugs if you have pcos that's
[2691.60 - 2697.60] the epstein bar which creates pcos
[2694.80 - 2700.24] so keep that in mind so can i use
[2697.60 - 2702.72] essential oils of clove cinnamon and
[2700.24 - 2705.28] ginger etc no kathleen don't do that
[2702.72 - 2706.96] that's not food like that's not food
[2705.28 - 2709.04] it's essential oils
[2706.96 - 2713.92] and and i'm not against essential oils
[2709.04 - 2715.92] but don't don't use that as a food okay
[2713.92 - 2718.16] use the food
[2715.92 - 2719.76] use the cinnamon stick don't use the
[2718.16 - 2720.64] essential oil
[2719.76 - 2723.12] use
[2720.64 - 2725.52] use the ginger the fresh ginger or the
[2723.12 - 2728.40] ginger spice don't use the ginger
[2725.52 - 2729.84] essential oil no they're not the same
[2728.40 - 2731.60] they're not the same i know people think
[2729.84 - 2733.92] they are but they're not okay
[2731.60 - 2735.28] and i never recommend essential oils
[2733.92 - 2737.76] internally
[2735.28 - 2739.76] i never recommend them internally it's
[2737.76 - 2742.24] great to smell them you can put them in
[2739.76 - 2744.24] infusers your diffusers or whatever you
[2742.24 - 2746.16] want to put them in you can put a little
[2744.24 - 2748.32] on your skin you can make your own
[2746.16 - 2749.76] concoctions you can add it to some hemp
[2748.32 - 2751.60] oil or coconut oil make your little
[2749.76 - 2753.44] concoction you can play with essential
[2751.60 - 2754.72] oils absolutely
[2753.44 - 2757.20] but never
[2754.72 - 2758.16] take them internally
[2757.20 - 2760.40] never
[2758.16 - 2764.08] eat them don't internalize
[2760.40 - 2766.48] those essential oils they aggravate
[2764.08 - 2768.40] the intestinal tract the central nervous
[2766.48 - 2770.64] system and when you're sensitive it
[2768.40 - 2772.72] could wreak such havoc i've seen people
[2770.64 - 2774.72] just in such bad shape from it so don't
[2772.72 - 2776.56] do that some people are so sensitive
[2774.72 - 2778.48] they're sensitive to even the smell of
[2776.56 - 2780.16] essential oils they're too strong for
[2778.48 - 2781.92] certain people to even smell them
[2780.16 - 2784.16] without getting headaches from it or
[2781.92 - 2786.72] getting aggravated by with anxiety
[2784.16 - 2788.56] problems getting worse essential oils
[2786.72 - 2790.64] are for people who
[2788.56 - 2792.88] have a very strong constitution who
[2790.64 - 2795.20] don't mind about strong smells they're
[2792.88 - 2796.88] their nerves aren't that sensitive or
[2795.20 - 2798.72] not sensitive at all
[2796.88 - 2800.48] and they can you know they can burn and
[2798.72 - 2802.56] they can diffuse them they can do they
[2800.48 - 2804.24] can do what they want with them but i
[2802.56 - 2806.32] still don't recommend taking them
[2804.24 - 2810.00] internally important on the central oil
[2806.32 - 2810.00] note really important information
[2810.88 - 2814.88] okay guys right now i'm just doing some
[2812.88 - 2817.12] hot apple cider
[2814.88 - 2819.36] actually it's hot apple juice and this
[2817.12 - 2822.00] is really amazing i got this in here
[2819.36 - 2824.32] i did some fresh apple juice in here i
[2822.00 - 2826.32] also want to show you that you can use
[2824.32 - 2828.40] the bottled apple juice too so i don't
[2826.32 - 2832.80] want you feeling stuck like you can't
[2828.40 - 2834.80] use the bottle you can all right
[2832.80 - 2836.72] so
[2834.80 - 2839.92] so i want you to make sure you're doing
[2836.72 - 2842.48] 32 ounces of water or up to a liter of
[2839.92 - 2844.80] water a day i want that water intake
[2842.48 - 2846.64] herbal tea doesn't replace the water
[2844.80 - 2848.48] intake so if you're doing herbal tea
[2846.64 - 2851.44] right so if you're doing your herbal tea
[2848.48 - 2852.96] it doesn't replace the water intake
[2851.44 - 2853.92] keep that in mind during this cleanse
[2852.96 - 2856.00] right
[2853.92 - 2858.64] this cleanses in a deprivation cleanse
[2856.00 - 2860.08] so it's not about holding food back and
[2858.64 - 2862.72] starving
[2860.08 - 2865.36] it's not about going hungry
[2862.72 - 2866.24] really important to know okay
[2865.36 - 2868.24] so
[2866.24 - 2869.84] what you'll notice if you have questions
[2868.24 - 2872.32] like wait a minute what can i eat what

[2876.96 - 2881.36] you'll instantly know
[2878.88 - 2883.44] because the levels tell you what you
[2881.36 - 2885.52] should choose to stay away from what you
[2883.44 - 2888.08] shouldn't eat right
[2885.52 - 2889.92] so you can actually see whoa i'm not
