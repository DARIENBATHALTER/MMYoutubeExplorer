[104.96 - 108.16] how many people are like lemons are bad
[106.80 - 110.24] for your teeth
[108.16 - 112.80] when my dentist said lemons destroyed my
[110.24 - 114.88] teeth that's what did it it wasn't all
[112.80 - 116.56] that other stuff i did it wasn't all the
[114.88 - 118.24] garbage and the chips i've eaten all
[116.56 - 120.16] these years
[118.24 - 122.16] and it wasn't anything else wasn't the
[120.16 - 123.84] candy i had well candy doesn't really
[122.16 - 125.12] kill teeth depends on what's in it
[123.84 - 126.56] that's a whole nother story all the
[125.12 - 129.36] additives and all the garbage and all
[126.56 - 131.44] that right but it's like yeah no it was
[129.36 - 133.36] the lemon water that destroyed my teeth
[131.44 - 135.44] and ruined them that's what you hear all
[133.36 - 139.28] the time the dentist is like whoa you
[135.44 - 141.44] you need five cavities here and
[139.28 - 144.24] how much lemons are you doing well i had
[141.44 - 146.24] a lemon like a year ago what do you mean
[144.24 - 147.84] lemon right

[158.64 - 164.88] right there okay now look
[160.72 - 166.64] 16 to 32 ounces is the best way to do it
[164.88 - 168.88] so you can just take a glass right there
[166.64 - 171.60] that's like probably 12 ounces
[168.88 - 173.28] right but 16 ounces just do a half a
[171.60 - 175.84] lemon right in the glass every single

[229.84 - 232.00] guess well
[231.12 - 234.80] yeah
[232.00 - 238.72] but look i'm not picking on you
[234.80 - 240.88] if you just do this right here

[240.88 - 245.68] right
[242.32 - 248.08] okay let me get this glass right here

[254.56 - 260.72] no judgment if you just do this and a
[257.76 - 264.00] little bit of that lemon juice just
[260.72 - 266.56] falls off of that slice right there just
[264.00 - 267.84] a little bit and goes in that water
[266.56 - 270.72] i'm proud
[267.84 - 273.04] very proud if that's all you do
[270.72 - 274.80] i'm okay with that every single morning

[274.80 - 281.28] on you i'm not gonna judge you okay
[277.36 - 283.28] it would be better if you did this right
[281.28 - 285.60] see the juice come out that would be
[283.28 - 287.92] better and it would be even better
[285.60 - 289.92] better if you do this
[287.92 - 290.88] right you squeeze more of it out and
[289.92 - 292.56] then
[290.88 - 294.96] it'd be even better if you took the
[292.56 - 296.48] other part and you did that
[294.96 - 300.00] that's better
[296.48 - 301.76] much better there you go now you got a
[300.00 - 303.76] glass of lemon water do that first thing
[301.76 - 305.60] in the morning and flush out that poison
[303.76 - 306.96] and toxin load which we're going to talk
[305.60 - 309.28] about
[306.96 - 312.16] jojo i see a question right there why
[309.28 - 314.16] not hot water number one question that's
[312.16 - 316.24] sweeping the nation right there it is
[314.16 - 318.08] and i'll tell you why because people do
[316.24 - 322.32] it in hot water now
[318.08 - 325.28] you're allowed to do your lemon juice
[322.32 - 326.96] from your lemon in hot water
[325.28 - 328.88] but you're not gonna get the same
[326.96 - 331.28] results you're not gonna get the
[328.88 - 333.36] flushing action now you want a cup of
[331.28 - 335.76] hot tea in the morning
[333.36 - 337.60] or you got you got a flu
[335.76 - 340.32] or something and you you want to drink

[344.72 - 348.64] get medicinals
[346.48 - 350.80] from that lemon if you do hot water but
[348.64 - 353.84] this is what's going to go wrong
[350.80 - 356.64] if you do it for flushing the liver and
[353.84 - 360.16] flushing toxins it has to be
[356.64 - 363.28] raw alive and living you go wrong when
[360.16 - 366.24] it's hot or in hot water when you put it
[363.28 - 368.08] in hot water like a mug of hot hot tea
[366.24 - 370.24] when you do that you don't get the
[368.08 - 372.48] flushing action that you need in the
[370.24 - 374.88] morning you guys to drive the toxins out

[777.28 - 781.16] your teeth they help prevent gum disease
[780.48 - 783.52] they're
[781.16 - 786.72] antibacterial so that's a key right
[783.52 - 788.08] there people are loaded with bacteria in
[786.72 - 790.48] their mouth
[788.08 - 793.28] multiple kinds of bacteria the bacteria
[790.48 - 795.20] is eating away at the gums the bacteria
[793.28 - 797.92] is eating away at the teeth
[795.20 - 800.56] and so lemon water helps to get rid of
[797.92 - 803.04] that bacteria helps to clean
[800.56 - 805.04] the palate it helps to clean the mouth
[803.04 - 807.44] clean the teeth that's important all in
[805.04 - 809.20] its own and the misconception out there
[807.44 - 811.92] is well you can't do lemon on your teeth
[809.20 - 813.84] but how many people really do lemons how
[811.92 - 815.52] many people do that much lemon water i
[813.84 - 818.00] know the medical medium community uses
[815.52 - 820.88] it as a healing tool you guys you drink
[818.00 - 823.28] your lemon water 16 to 32 ounces on an
[820.88 - 825.92] empty stomach and you're using your your
[823.28 - 827.28] lemon water tool every morning
[825.92 - 829.44] and then you move on from there and you
[827.28 - 831.92] do your celery juice right but you're
[829.44 - 834.00] doing your lemon water but in the world
[831.92 - 836.08] of dentistry in the world of patients
[834.00 - 838.88] seeing their dentist there's millions of
[836.08 - 840.88] people in there in the dentist chair
[838.88 - 844.16] getting their teeth rolled getting root
[840.88 - 847.36] canals getting implants getting bridges
[844.16 - 849.28] getting fillings getting crowns right
[847.36 - 850.72] getting veneers because their teeth are
[849.28 - 853.04] so shot
[850.72 - 855.92] so shot and a big part of their teeth
[853.04 - 857.60] being so shot is mineral deficiencies so
[855.92 - 859.84] people don't realize when you're doing
[857.60 - 862.24] your lemon water you're putting minerals
[859.84 - 864.56] back into your teeth you're not hurting
[862.24 - 867.12] your enamel you're not messing your
[864.56 - 869.60] teeth up you're helping your teeth
[867.12 - 872.00] because you're actually putting calcium
[869.60 - 873.52] back into the teeth so that's something
[872.00 - 874.56] that's really important to know right
[873.52 - 876.40] there
[874.56 - 878.24] jeanette says i've been drinking lemon
[876.40 - 880.72] juice first thing in the morning per
[878.24 - 882.48] year instructions i have not had any
[880.72 - 885.20] cavities or teeth problems for a few
[882.48 - 887.36] years and jeanette the reason why is
[885.20 - 889.52] because it's helping to stave off
[887.36 - 891.60] cavities now a lot of people they may
[889.52 - 894.32] start lemon water and their teeth fall
[891.60 - 896.72] apart because they were already falling
[894.32 - 898.64] apart because teeth are like time
[896.72 - 900.72] capsules and i go into this in detail on
[898.64 - 902.96] the medical medium podcast you guys on
[900.72 - 905.36] this episode you got to watch got to
[902.96 - 908.96] listen to this episode what happens is
[905.36 - 911.20] our teeth become these mineral deficient
[908.96 - 912.40] time capsules that through life because
[911.20 - 914.48] of our deficiencies
[912.40 - 917.28] and all the acidic foods and all the
[914.48 - 919.60] vinegar we do right
[917.28 - 922.24] all the vinegars in our food
[919.60 - 924.96] all of that we break down the teeth we
[922.24 - 928.16] destroy them over time vinegar not only
[924.96 - 930.64] corrodes erodes the enamel off the teeth
[928.16 - 933.04] but when you have vinegar go into your
[930.64 - 935.76] body and it's in your bloodstream it's
[933.04 - 937.68] so acidic that your your teeth throw the
[935.76 - 939.76] calcium out of it
[937.68 - 941.92] your bones throw the calcium out of it
[939.76 - 944.16] and this is really important to know so
[941.92 - 946.48] here's how it works
[944.16 - 948.40] the more acidic we are inside our body
[946.48 - 950.80] the less alkaline we are inside our body
[948.40 - 953.28] and the more acidic we have to take
[950.80 - 955.84] calcium from the bones to neutralize it
[953.28 - 957.84] so the more vinegar you do even if it's
[955.84 - 960.16] just in a dressing every single day or
[957.84 - 961.92] in a salsa or something else what's
[960.16 - 964.16] happening is the calcium inside your
[961.92 - 966.08] bones is starting to deplete as you're
[964.16 - 968.08] doing vinegar another one is coffee
[966.08 - 969.36] right if you're doing your coffee every
[968.08 - 971.28] single day
[969.36 - 972.96] what's happening is your body has to
[971.28 - 975.92] throw calcium reserves into the
[972.96 - 978.16] bloodstream to buffer it a straw is not
[975.92 - 979.68] going to save you so if you drink your
[978.16 - 981.36] coffee with a straw you drink your
[979.68 - 982.88] vinegar with a straw you drink your
[981.36 - 984.40] lemon water well lemon water you don't
[982.88 - 986.40] need a drink with a straw anyway
[984.40 - 988.96] regardless but if you're drinking with
[986.40 - 990.24] the straw thinking that's your best bet
[988.96 - 991.76] you're not going to save your teeth
[990.24 - 993.20] because it's about what's going into the
[991.76 - 995.04] bloodstream it's not about what's
[993.20 - 996.80] touching the teeth so much
[995.04 - 998.64] vira good to see you let's see i noticed
[996.80 - 1000.32] my teeth get sensitive after drinking
[998.64 - 1001.76] lemon water for a while so let's cover
[1000.32 - 1003.04] that right now that's important all of
[1001.76 - 1004.08] its own
[1003.04 - 1006.72] okay
[1004.08 - 1008.48] so what happens elvira is that when
[1006.72 - 1010.72] people have sensitive teeth they already
[1008.48 - 1013.52] have sensitive teeth lemon water doesn't
[1010.72 - 1015.36] make it sensitive it's already sensitive
[1013.52 - 1017.20] so if you have a nerve problem a gum
[1015.36 - 1019.28] problem a tooth problem any kind of
[1017.20 - 1022.16] issue with your teeth mouth trigeminal
[1019.28 - 1024.16] neuralgia or just just a nerve that's
[1022.16 - 1025.92] had it's been jabbed too many times at
[1024.16 - 1027.76] the dentist so it becomes sensitive
[1025.92 - 1029.84] because you had the novocaine the
[1027.76 - 1032.24] numbing agent the needle went into your
[1029.84 - 1034.72] nerve in the jaw right and it just made
[1032.24 - 1037.36] it it made it sensitive over the years
[1034.72 - 1038.56] so if lemon water you feel it with the
[1037.36 - 1040.48] lemon water
[1038.56 - 1042.16] you're probably feeling it with other
[1040.48 - 1043.92] things too so it's not like you're
[1042.16 - 1045.20] living your life and you never had a
[1043.92 - 1046.56] tooth sensitivity and all of a sudden
[1045.20 - 1048.64] you have lemon water and now you have
[1046.56 - 1051.04] one it doesn't work like that i'm sure
[1048.64 - 1053.28] that you have sensitivity somewhere
[1051.04 - 1055.36] around your tooth with other things that
[1053.28 - 1058.08] you either eat or drink because
[1055.36 - 1059.52] everybody does right now
[1058.08 - 1061.68] the other thing too is people get
[1059.52 - 1063.44] sensitive teeth they have sensitive
[1061.68 - 1066.16] teeth automatically they get sensitive
[1063.44 - 1069.04] if it's cold water going down or if it's
[1066.16 - 1071.36] really hot and no ha that'll ring the
[1069.04 - 1074.00] bell on a sensitive nerve but lemons
[1071.36 - 1076.88] don't make a sensitive nerve lemons help
[1074.00 - 1078.56] heal a sensitive nerve susan broon says
[1076.88 - 1080.56] i use limes in my water which i have
[1078.56 - 1083.28] right here susan cool i use lime in my
[1080.56 - 1085.84] water do they work the same as lemons
[1083.28 - 1087.52] yes they do incredible if you love lime
[1085.84 - 1089.20] that's the way to go
[1087.52 - 1090.96] that's a great way to go wendy says my
[1089.20 - 1093.20] teeth actually stopped being sensitive
[1090.96 - 1095.04] with medical medium protocols amazing
[1093.20 - 1096.72] and that i hear that all the time that
[1095.04 - 1099.12] people's nerves get stronger in their
[1096.72 - 1101.44] mouth because medical medium protocols
[1099.12 - 1102.96] so they end up healing so that they're
[1101.44 - 1105.04] less sensitive in their mouth which is
[1102.96 - 1106.48] incredible all on its own you guys if
[1105.04 - 1108.32] you just got on here we're live right
[1106.48 - 1110.32] now but i just wanted to announce which
[1108.32 - 1113.20] i'm really excited about the medical

[1155.36 - 1158.88] you've got to check it out
[1156.96 - 1160.80] so when it comes down to
[1158.88 - 1162.32] acid versus alkaline let's hit that
[1160.80 - 1164.00] really quick this is important
[1162.32 - 1164.88] information that you might want to know
[1164.00 - 1165.92] right
[1164.88 - 1166.96] lemons
[1165.92 - 1169.20] yes
[1166.96 - 1171.76] it's got some citric acid the natural
[1169.20 - 1174.64] kind the right kind right so it's got
[1171.76 - 1177.68] the acid in here but it's alkaline the
[1174.64 - 1179.92] lemon is an alkaline fruit lime two for
[1177.68 - 1183.04] the ones that like lime right these are
[1179.92 - 1185.52] alkaline what happens is that when those
[1183.04 - 1187.36] minerals those alkaline minerals enter
[1185.52 - 1190.00] in
[1187.36 - 1192.80] okay when they enter in the body these
[1190.00 - 1195.20] alkaline minerals an amazing process
[1192.80 - 1197.04] occurs
[1195.20 - 1199.92] they go alkaline
[1197.04 - 1202.56] everything in the lemon goes alkaline so
[1199.92 - 1204.64] if it feels like it's not
[1202.56 - 1206.88] alkaline because it's acidic that's the
[1204.64 - 1208.48] fruit acid that you're experiencing
[1206.88 - 1210.56] right
[1208.48 - 1212.56] but the minerals in here
[1210.56 - 1214.56] turn alkaline because they are alkaline
[1212.56 - 1218.00] they change the chemistry of your body
[1214.56 - 1219.36] immediately so lemon water is alkalinity
[1218.00 - 1221.76] so first thing in the morning you're
[1219.36 - 1223.44] getting an alkaline flesh
[1221.76 - 1225.92] that's critical to know
[1223.44 - 1228.64] so lemon may seem acidic but it's
[1225.92 - 1231.76] neutralizing acids it's making you
[1228.64 - 1233.92] alkaline internally which is a game
[1231.76 - 1236.16] changer for people who are sick and have
[1233.92 - 1238.96] problems and all these other issues
[1236.16 - 1242.56] so when it comes down to restoring
[1238.96 - 1246.00] minerals back into deficient teeth the
[1242.56 - 1247.84] lemon water brings alkaline minerals
[1246.00 - 1250.80] like calcium because it's high in
[1247.84 - 1252.96] calcium back into your teeth to help
[1250.80 - 1253.92] restore your teeth
[1252.96 - 1256.56] that's
[1253.92 - 1258.08] where the money's at right there
[1256.56 - 1260.24] because you're actually bringing your
[1258.08 - 1262.40] teeth back when you do lemon water
[1260.24 - 1264.64] that's how it works i've had thousands
[1262.40 - 1267.04] of lemons in my life thousands upon
[1264.64 - 1268.72] thousands and i still have every one of
[1267.04 - 1269.84] my own teeth
[1268.72 - 1271.60] okay
[1269.84 - 1273.60] which is incredible
[1271.60 - 1275.76] so that's important to know right and
[1273.60 - 1277.84] yeah okay they're not perfectly straight
[1275.76 - 1280.48] but i never had braces or anything but
[1277.84 - 1282.64] whatever i don't have veneers i know all
[1280.48 - 1284.72] the podcast doctors they all got veneers
[1282.64 - 1286.48] they all got implants you know but you
[1284.72 - 1288.24] know who cares if someone has implants
[1286.48 - 1291.20] or veneers or some people that have
[1288.24 - 1292.64] crowns and root canals i get it and i
[1291.20 - 1294.48] totally understand but what i'm saying
[1292.64 - 1296.24] is with the podcast doctors is here they
[1294.48 - 1299.04] are they're the ones saying these days
[1296.24 - 1300.80] watch the lemons watch the lemon on your
[1299.04 - 1303.12] teeth meanwhile these guys are just been
[1300.80 - 1305.52] drinking coffee all their life
[1303.12 - 1307.44] doing whatever vinegar everything else
[1305.52 - 1308.72] all their teeth are gone they all got
[1307.44 - 1311.04] veneers
[1308.72 - 1313.04] you know and at my age
[1311.04 - 1314.56] i got all my teeth every last one of
[1313.04 - 1316.56] them they're there and they're in top
[1314.56 - 1318.96] shape bottom line
[1316.56 - 1322.08] and i've done thousands of lemons
[1318.96 - 1323.12] thousands upon eaten lemons do the lemon
[1322.08 - 1325.12] water
[1323.12 - 1327.44] clearly nature says my teeth are so much
[1325.12 - 1330.32] stronger with medical medium no more
[1327.44 - 1332.00] thin chipping teeth exactly so many
[1330.32 - 1335.12] people have the thin chipping teeth
[1332.00 - 1338.40] because teeth crumble from the inside
[1335.12 - 1340.40] out they are the time capsules manual
[1338.40 - 1343.60] says does fermented food also have the
[1340.40 - 1345.36] same acidic effect like vinegar
[1343.60 - 1347.36] fermented food it all depends on what's
[1345.36 - 1350.72] going on with that fermented food a lot
[1347.36 - 1353.36] of fermented food has it is acidic okay
[1350.72 - 1355.28] it is acidic naturally fermentation
[1353.36 - 1357.12] becomes that but it doesn't have the
[1355.28 - 1358.96] same effect
[1357.12 - 1360.48] kim miller says my teeth were falling
[1358.96 - 1362.96] apart
[1360.48 - 1365.04] doing acv regularly
[1362.96 - 1366.40] doing your protocols have saved my teeth
[1365.04 - 1368.40] and they've never been healthier now
[1366.40 - 1370.96] here's the funny thing
[1368.40 - 1373.36] exactly so you'll see professionals and
[1370.96 - 1375.36] health professionals and dietitians and
[1373.36 - 1377.92] podcast doctors or whoever out there and
[1375.36 - 1380.24] they're promoting the acv they want all
[1377.92 - 1382.56] their people to buy their acv brand
[1380.24 - 1384.48] right apple cider vinegar meanwhile
[1382.56 - 1386.24] they're just promoting people to lose
[1384.48 - 1388.48] and destroy their teeth
[1386.24 - 1390.72] there's a big difference right there all
[1388.48 - 1391.68] on its own you know how much confusion's
[1390.72 - 1393.12] out there
[1391.68 - 1395.36] um by the way in the fermented food
[1393.12 - 1396.56] question that was there earlier actually
[1395.36 - 1399.52] just so you know
[1396.56 - 1400.40] the kombucha tea right kombucha tea that
[1399.52 - 1402.88] is
[1400.40 - 1405.60] highly acidic that's got the caffeine in
[1402.88 - 1408.00] it that re and it's really acidic that
[1405.60 - 1410.56] fermentation process that does hurt
[1408.00 - 1411.92] teeth bad so kombucha tea does hurt
[1410.56 - 1414.08] teeth really bad
[1411.92 - 1417.04] so kim miller says my teeth are falling
[1414.08 - 1418.56] apart doing acv regularly doing your
[1417.04 - 1421.44] protocols oh you said that incredible
[1418.56 - 1424.32] and they're healthier amazing um smokey
[1421.44 - 1425.36] mountain paradise i've healed a cracked
[1424.32 - 1427.76] tooth
[1425.36 - 1429.12] split right down the middle on medical
[1427.76 - 1430.72] medium
[1429.12 - 1434.72] drop the mic
[1430.72 - 1436.48] that's amazing that's incredible
[1434.72 - 1437.68] incredible um
[1436.48 - 1440.64] gina says
[1437.68 - 1443.52] my broken enamel grew back i consume
[1440.64 - 1444.80] around 10 pounds of lemons each week
[1443.52 - 1447.52] yeah
[1444.80 - 1449.44] right and people don't know this
[1447.52 - 1452.08] they're in fear every day out there
[1449.44 - 1455.20] jeannette says citric acid is not citrus
[1452.08 - 1456.80] correct citric acid in supplementation
[1455.20 - 1459.84] is corn
[1456.80 - 1462.08] it's a byproduct of corn
[1459.84 - 1464.16] it's not good either and it's always gmo
[1462.08 - 1466.32] citric acid this is different this is an
[1464.16 - 1468.32] entirely different kind of citric acid
[1466.32 - 1470.96] entirely different sabby says i heard
[1468.32 - 1473.04] the episodes they are boring and the
[1470.96 - 1474.72] same repeat of the information you have
[1473.04 - 1476.56] already mentioned in your lives books
[1474.72 - 1478.00] and blogs that's interesting sad because
[1476.56 - 1479.28] i'm wondering what episodes you heard
[1478.00 - 1481.04] then i think you were listening to
[1479.28 - 1483.76] somebody else's podcast
[1481.04 - 1486.56] because it was all new information
[1483.76 - 1489.20] the whole episode is is like cranking
[1486.56 - 1491.76] with info in detail
[1489.20 - 1494.00] so i'm like confused i recommend you
[1491.76 - 1495.76] read my books again and i recommend you
[1494.00 - 1497.44] listen to the episode again or try to
[1495.76 - 1500.88] find the episode because i don't think
[1497.44 - 1501.92] you heard it okay so but thank you for
[1500.88 - 1503.68] listening

[1533.84 - 1536.64] got some comments here i want to read to
[1535.36 - 1539.44] you guys
[1536.64 - 1540.48] tracy lynn lemon and lime water ghost
[1539.44 - 1543.20] thing
[1540.48 - 1545.84] i'm the morning's game changer and no
[1543.20 - 1547.84] more erosive esophagealitis and all
[1545.84 - 1550.00] these years the doctor said to me stay
[1547.84 - 1552.16] away from lemons and tomatoes no pain
[1550.00 - 1554.16] and teeth are great
[1552.16 - 1556.32] incredible well that's what happens
[1554.16 - 1557.52] right doctors don't know why we're sick
[1556.32 - 1558.96] i want you guys to have doctors but
[1557.52 - 1561.60] doctors don't know why we're sick with
[1558.96 - 1563.52] chronic illness they don't it's sad but
[1561.60 - 1565.60] they don't because scientists don't know
[1563.52 - 1567.04] why we're sick with chronic illness so
[1565.60 - 1568.48] medical universities don't know why
[1567.04 - 1570.56] we're sick with mysterious chronic
[1568.48 - 1571.84] illness we know that right
[1570.56 - 1573.60] and at the same time they're like
[1571.84 - 1575.60] telling you what to do or don't do or
[1573.60 - 1577.60] not do meanwhile they don't have any of
[1575.60 - 1579.04] the real teeth i know because i know so
[1577.60 - 1580.88] many doctors
[1579.04 - 1582.08] they don't have their teeth right and
[1580.88 - 1583.36] next thing you know they're doing all
[1582.08 - 1584.72] the chocolate and they're doing
[1583.36 - 1586.16] everything else they're telling people
[1584.72 - 1588.56] lots of chocolate that's a great way to
[1586.16 - 1589.60] lose your teeth too
[1588.56 - 1590.96] so
[1589.60 - 1592.56] my teeth have been getting strong so
[1590.96 - 1594.64] nisha says my teeth have been getting
[1592.56 - 1596.88] stronger with medical medium information
[1594.64 - 1600.48] i can actually see how strong my teeth
[1596.88 - 1603.36] are now they used to be transparent the
[1600.48 - 1604.88] transparent teeth look exactly now they
[1603.36 - 1607.28] are solid
[1604.88 - 1608.40] boom you're getting all your minerals
[1607.28 - 1610.88] back
[1608.40 - 1613.68] lamb tails says the sarcasm used to put
[1610.88 - 1616.00] me off because i was too serious
[1613.68 - 1618.48] and heavy-hearted and you taught me to
[1616.00 - 1620.40] lighten up in many ways my inner light
[1618.48 - 1622.40] is brighter than ever and getting
[1620.40 - 1624.16] stronger
[1622.40 - 1626.40] you're actually you're actually getting
[1624.16 - 1628.40] me emotional because to think that you
[1626.40 - 1630.40] you know that you're okay with my
[1628.40 - 1631.68] sarcasm i am honored i'm not kidding
[1630.40 - 1634.32] around right now i'm not joking i'm
[1631.68 - 1637.76] honored and thank you because i get it i

[1665.92 - 1670.56] acv is bad for you all peer review
[1668.64 - 1672.64] studies that know why everybody's sick
[1670.56 - 1674.40] the peer review studies that get moms
[1672.64 - 1675.44] out of bed that are actually dying
[1674.40 - 1677.28] because they
[1675.44 - 1679.04] can't even feed themselves they can't
[1677.28 - 1681.68] lift up their arms the peer review
[1679.04 - 1684.48] studies that have people all healed and
[1681.68 - 1686.96] better with multiple sclerosis oh wait a
[1684.48 - 1689.20] minute or do you mean how science took
[1686.96 - 1691.60] medical medium information that fcmr
[1689.20 - 1693.44] causes multiple sclerosis so just so you
[1691.60 - 1695.68] know when you say peer-reviewed studies
[1693.44 - 1698.32] to medical medium please know science
[1695.68 - 1700.80] takes medical mediums information
[1698.32 - 1702.64] and they use it and they do it illegally
[1700.80 - 1704.08] and we know that because it's already
[1702.64 - 1707.12] been published in all the medical medium
[1704.08 - 1709.52] books and science takes it later so try
[1707.12 - 1711.60] that for your peer review
[1709.52 - 1714.64] you guys this is great susan says i love

[1789.36 - 1793.60] doing your protocols for more than three
[1791.28 - 1796.24] years god bless you
[1793.60 - 1799.20] everything like my stomach and thyroid
[1796.24 - 1801.84] issues got a lot better but my teeth not
[1799.20 - 1804.88] my dentist wants me to use fluoride and
[1801.84 - 1806.56] i don't know what to do okay
[1804.88 - 1807.52] so okay
[1806.56 - 1809.20] look
[1807.52 - 1811.44] i've always listened to your doctors but
[1809.20 - 1813.76] i would nev me personally would never
[1811.44 - 1814.88] touch fluoride ever in a million years
[1813.76 - 1816.80] okay
[1814.88 - 1820.32] fluoride's a neurotoxin doesn't
[1816.80 - 1824.00] strengthen the teeth it destroys teeth
[1820.32 - 1826.00] my opinion fine so so i always tell my
[1824.00 - 1828.24] family and my friends when they're at
[1826.00 - 1830.00] the dentist you avoid
[1828.24 - 1832.08] that fluoride treatment
[1830.00 - 1833.60] always tell my family and my friends
[1832.08 - 1834.88] don't let them put that poison in your
[1833.60 - 1836.88] mouth
[1834.88 - 1838.72] teeth are time capsules you can be doing
[1836.88 - 1841.04] medical medium for three years and
[1838.72 - 1842.96] medical medium during those three years
[1841.04 - 1845.44] could be stopping your teeth from really
[1842.96 - 1847.12] falling apart
[1845.44 - 1849.36] see your teeth
[1847.12 - 1851.44] all these years being a time capsule
[1849.36 - 1853.28] already had the deficiencies already
[1851.44 - 1855.52] been damaged by vinegar all along the
[1853.28 - 1858.64] way maybe even caffeine chocolate
[1855.52 - 1860.64] products coffee products already damaged
[1858.64 - 1862.72] along the way you might have come into
[1860.64 - 1865.52] this world mineral deficient so your
[1862.72 - 1868.80] teeth were already on the trajectory of
[1865.52 - 1870.64] falling apart for the future right
[1868.80 - 1872.64] then you got onto medical medium and
[1870.64 - 1875.20] it's slowing the process down it's
[1872.64 - 1877.20] slowing the teeth from really collapsing
[1875.20 - 1878.72] and falling apart
[1877.20 - 1882.16] because the medical medium information
[1878.72 - 1882.16] is like putting on the brakes like
[1882.24 - 1886.40] it's like putting on the brakes of a
[1884.16 - 1888.80] real problem happening
[1886.40 - 1892.24] but you still got work to do lots of
[1888.80 - 1894.24] work for restoring and re-mineralizing
[1892.24 - 1896.16] and that's important to know you're
[1894.24 - 1898.00] doing the celery juice what protocol are
[1896.16 - 1899.28] you using medical medium are you doing
[1898.00 - 1901.52] the lemon award the cellar juice the
[1899.28 - 1903.44] heavy metal detox movie people who have
[1901.52 - 1905.28] a lot of heavy metals
[1903.44 - 1907.36] in their body
[1905.28 - 1910.40] have teeth problems
[1907.36 - 1912.40] are they getting all the metals out
[1910.40 - 1914.16] you know are they getting the metals out
[1912.40 - 1916.32] of their body are they getting the
[1914.16 - 1918.40] metals out of their liver
[1916.32 - 1921.84] all these things matter
[1918.40 - 1925.76] because those time capsules
[1921.84 - 1927.92] are a historic history of the past in
[1925.76 - 1929.84] your life from all kinds of toxins
[1927.92 - 1931.76] poisons coming in here mineral deficient
[1929.84 - 1932.84] having toxic heavy metals in your system
[1931.76 - 1934.88] all of
[1932.84 - 1936.72] this so when you're doing the mm
[1934.88 - 1938.96] protocol and everything else is getting
[1936.72 - 1940.24] better your thyroid this that your
[1938.96 - 1941.68] stomach everything's getting better
[1940.24 - 1943.60] everything's getting better think about
[1941.68 - 1945.36] how many problems you got right well
[1943.60 - 1948.16] your your body's using all those
[1945.36 - 1949.76] reserves man your teeth they're just
[1948.16 - 1952.72] like time capsules that are deficient
[1949.76 - 1954.88] from you being sick all these years too
[1952.72 - 1956.88] so it matters that you're even doing
[1954.88 - 1958.48] medical medium protocol because not only
[1956.88 - 1960.32] are things getting better but you're
[1958.48 - 1963.60] halting you're stopping the teeth from
[1960.32 - 1965.60] getting worse and worse faster until the
[1963.60 - 1968.88] breaks can hit and then it's about now
[1965.60 - 1968.88] the teeth are getting better
[1969.12 - 1972.48] so you guys we're live right now i
[1970.40 - 1974.56] wanted to tell you if you just got on
