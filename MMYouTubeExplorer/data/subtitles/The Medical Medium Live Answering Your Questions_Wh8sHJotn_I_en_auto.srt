heal

43
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:32,320
pcos okay so um when it comes down to

44
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,320
pcos what people don't know

45
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,079
is that what what research and science

46
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,520
doesn't know it's so sad

47
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,680
and if something you might be someone

48
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,439
that's like oh don't say nothing bad

49
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,560
about research in science well that's

50
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,159
funny

51
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,079
because there's millions of people sick

52
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,280
and laying in their beds sick and going

53
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,000
to doctors and

54
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,520
fatigued and don't have answers and that

55
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,280
research and science hasn't saved them

56
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,600
it's it's really a sad

57
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,040
sad situation out there and we got to do

58
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,479
everything we can to get people better

59
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,439
we can't wait 50 years

60
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,719
in hopes that research does a test study

61
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,799
that determines

62
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,479
something about something so someone's

63
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,200
pcos can go away

64
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,479
like what uh you'll be 100 years old by

65
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,400
the time research in science actually

66
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,920
figures anything out about pcos

67
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,760
so anyway enough with like the sarcasm

68
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,080
and stuff but it's true it's true

69
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,400
it's true everything i said it's just so

70
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,480
anyway pcos it's a viral condition it's

71
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,720
epstein-barr virus epstein-barr virus

72
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,000
it's

73
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,879
it is from the mono and and pcos is a

74
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,360
result of that

75
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,560
the epstein-barr gets into the ovaries

76
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,599
that's the whole point

77
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,239
creates the fluid filled ovarian cysts

78
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,319
um

79
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,519
and it creates a disturbance hormonally

80
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,720
and and that's what that's what

81
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,640
epstein-barr can do

82
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,920
and a lot of women have epstein-barr in

83
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,200
different places in their body they'll

84
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,879
have it in their thyroids they'll have

85
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,920
pcos and their thyroid

86
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,720
in thyroiditis or hypothyroid and all

87
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,959
that um

88
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,319
best supplements are antiviral you want

89
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,920

90
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,239
supplements i use

uh personally i'll do a show on that

92
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,760
someday you know it's the vimergy stuff

93
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,400

94
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,560
personally use but um

95
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,480
but um cleanse the heel is a place you

96
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,200
can find about pcos find out what the

97
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,879
cause is

98
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,159

99
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:16,080
dosages of supplements pcos is no joke

100
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,280

101
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,959
the industry

102
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,560
you know and and they don't understand

103
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,920
what it's like to have that unless

104
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,360
they're a woman that actually is

people are in the industry and and the

109
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,959
industry is all

110
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,799

lunch slash dinner i'm going to be

talking about how healing those foods

147
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,080
are

148
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,440
so i'm going to be making that i'm going

149
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,160
to be answering questions thoroughly

150
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,479
michelle

151
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,440
schuffer says you talk about coffee and

152
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,560
caffeine but not

153
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,680
organic decaf can i drink that well

154
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,479
decaffeinated coffee has caffeine

155
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,160
so it just has a little less so you got

156
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,240
to think about that so decaffeinated

157
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,040
coffee is just a little bit less

158
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,720
and so what that means is so if you have

159
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,759
a big cup of decaf

160
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,280
you're really having a half cup of

161
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,520
regular coffee

162
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,560
for caffeine wine so it's like so if

163
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,479
you're doing

164
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,360
a nice big mug of decaf coffee a nice

165
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,759
big mug

166
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,560
you're really doing a good old big cup

167
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:21,440
of coffee regular coffee caffeine wise

168
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,240
so it all depends if you want caffeine

169
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,639
out of your life

170
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,560

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,600
should really check it out

189
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:06,240
really check it out if you get a chance

190
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,600
adrenal issues okay rhonda says adrenal

191
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,960
issues dark circles

192
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,240
under the eyes well dark circles under

193
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,840
the eyes

194
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,520
here's what happens when your adrenals

195
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,360
get tired when your adrenals get tired

196
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,280
you get more dehydrated

197
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,120
that can kind of give you a little bit

198
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,560
of problems underneath the eyes

199
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,560
the other thing about underneath the

200
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,800
eyes is um

201
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,840
the liver so that's the liver so that's

202
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,919
what that is

203
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,120
so and when your liver stagnant and

204
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,400
sluggish

205
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,080
so and the other thing about dark

206
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,639
circles under eyes if you're tired like

207
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,240
me

208
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,759
i'll get you know i'll definitely get

209
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,160
some shadows under there

210
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,199
last night i slept three hours i've been

211
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,280
working full bore

212
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,199
some days i work 20 hours a day some

213
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,680
days i work 19 hours a day

214
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,280
i got five hours the other night three

215
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,199
hours last night

216
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,199
tomorrow i mean tonight i'm hoping to

217
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,720
get six if i'm lucky but i'm gonna be

218
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,039
working late

219
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,479
so just got too much to do right now so

220
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,960
it's but

221
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,479
you know so i might get a little shady

222
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,639
under the eyes

223
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,319
but but if you're getting the dark

224
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,720
circles in the eyes liver

225
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:11,039
that's the big one if you're rested

226
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,880
liver and adrenals too but mostly

227
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,479
liver that's the big one there because

228
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,440
when your blood gets toxic

229
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,919
the skin is really thin underneath your

230
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,080
eyes

231
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,199
really thin so when your blood gets

232
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,919
toxic

233
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,840
it shows through the thin skin

234
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,360
underneath your eyes that's how it works

235
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,960
talked about it in liver rescue by the

236
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,479
way you guys my book level rescue this

237
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,759
is cleanse the heel that's my

238
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:35,360
liver rescue um

239
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,520
but i'm doing a lot i'm doing more

240
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,440
tick-tock videos letting you know

241
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,880
so i'm doing a lot more tik-tok videos

242
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,840
i'm working on them

243
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,800
but i won't be re-posting those tick

244
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,919
tock videos

245
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,560
on ig and facebook so i won't be doing

246
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,080
that

247
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,240
that that's not going to be happening in

248
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,919
the future you guys might be noticing

249
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,120
that i'm i'm posting those tick tock

250
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,319
videos i'm going to be doing lots of

251
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,639
tick tock videos but i

252
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,639
i might not be posting them so much or

253
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,560
at all coming up so follow me on tick

254
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,400
tock so you could see them but

255
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,919
also most importantly follow me on tik

256
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,120

257
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,319

questions thoroughly i'm going to be

259
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:13,120
eating dinner lunch with you guys

260
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,160
and we're going to be shooting the sh

261
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,199
because

262
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,800
i'm actually not censored on there so

263
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,319
who knows what we're going to talk about

264
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,120
just letting you know get some lemon

265
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,120
balm tea right now

266
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,000
aaron stewart says how can i get rid of

267
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:31,440
chronic candida

268
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,200
fungus for 30 years on my feet um

269
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,560
so when it comes down to candida when it

270
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,800
comes down to fungus

271
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,039
of any kind and it's on your feet any

272
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,560
kind of fungus that's on your feet

273
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,399
you definitely definitely want to

274
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,320
address it with immune system you want

275
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,640
your immune system stronger

276
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,519
zinc deficiencies is why people get feet

277
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,440
fungus

278
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,200
at zinc deficiencies we walk around

279
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,880
through life with a zinc deficiency and

280
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,399
then we can catch anything

281
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,480
we can catch anything we can sit on a

282
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,440
public toilet seat pick up a variety of

283
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,279
strep

284
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,560
some antibiotic resistant straps

285
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,480
somebody else has

286
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,480
right off the toilet seat right off out

287
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,160
of the water someone

288
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,399
goes the bathroom and that's in that

289
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,320
toilet it's got strep all floating

290
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,880
around you they flush it it goes down

291
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,360
but the strap just clings to the side or

292
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,320
it's still in the water it comes back up

293
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,560
from the flush

294
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,480
then you go on that toilet you start

295
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,320
going the bathroom and it splashes and

296
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,160
that water splashes up

297
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,160
you know goes under your tush there and

298
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,880
boom you've got some streptococcus but

299
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,200
if you're

300
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,640
your zinc is good then your immune

301
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,240
system is going to be really

302
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,080
really strong and it's just going to

303
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,600
annihilate it hopefully before it could

304
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,120
get anywhere

305
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,880
say it goes with foot fungus it's like

306
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,399
if your zinc is low your immune system's

307
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,279
been down for years

308
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,920
and you're eating foods that feed that

309
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,839
feed

310
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,360
you know bad fungus i don't think that's

311
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,640
probably a candida but

312
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,399
but candida candida is not the kind of

313
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,560
fungus that's on feed i think

314
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,399
that's what they'll say but really

315
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,519
there's all these other types of fungus

316
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,120
that are on the feet

317
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,959
and they're not candida they're they're

318
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,160
a whole bunch of other ones

319
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,800
um so yeah yeah so much to talk about

320
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,600
you guys

321
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,800
can you speak on third nerve palsy and

322
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,320
the eyelid

323
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:14,160
shutting yeah the whole the whole palsy

324
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,480
thing the shingles virus is real you

325
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,720
know

326
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,079
any anybody i've ever known with any

327
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,560
kind of bell's palsy

328
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,360
anything like that where it it wasn't

329
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,720
there before

330
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,240
and you end up getting it where there's

331
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,880
a droop and all of a sudden there's like

332
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,120
a stroop

333
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,279
and you're like that or your eyes

334
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,600
drooping down like this and it's just

335
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,040
happening um and i've helped doctors for

336
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,600
years about this and

337
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,200
and and in fact medical medium

338
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,800
information is the only information

339
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,040
that put out there in the world that

340
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,480
bell's palsy shingles related and now

341
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,920
there's people that go into doctors

342
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,519
offices out there there's no science to

343
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,720
prove it there's no science research

344
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,640
that proves

345
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,160
bell's palsy is from shingles but

346
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,279
there's doctors all over the country in

347
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,480
the world now that are saying it's

348
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,320
shingles

349
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,160
because of medical mean information

350
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,720
without having some study it's just

351
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,000

00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:41,279
um debbie says i don't

407
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,760
drink coffee and i still have major hair

408
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,800
loss

409
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,959
please help um so what happens is did

410
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,360
you drink any coffee eat any chocolate

411
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:51,040
drink any much tea any black tea

412
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,120
throughout the years because the hair

413
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,800
loss comes later and it all falls out

414
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,040
and went with women

415
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,200
the the greatest joke ever played on

416
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,240
women which is the sickest joke by the

417
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,160
industry

418
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,920
sickest joke by the industry get them

419
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,000
addicted to caffeine

420
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,519
get them addicted to chocolate get them

421
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,680
addicted caffeine

422
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,279
throughout their life this way their

423
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,279
hair falls out later because it just

424
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,720
does because of it because the adrenals

425
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,880
lose their hormones

426
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,079
and then the hair follicles die and then

427
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,000
women lose their hair

428
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,680
now maybe you didn't have chocolate ever

429
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,959
in your life maybe you didn't have

430
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,560
caffeine ever your life

431
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,000
and you got some hair loss there well

432
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,920
then you're still losing the hormone and

433
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,320
the adrenal for other reasons and we got

434
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:32,720
to talk about that in sluggish liver

435
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,399
you know low-grade viral issues you're

436
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,839
not taking care of your adrenals you're

437
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,200
not eating enough throughout meaning

438
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,440
you're not eating enough snacks for

439
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,199
adrenals there's all kinds of reasons so

440
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,120
keep that in mind i talk all about that

441
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,800
and the information and

442
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,160
and maybe a bad event happened in your

443
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,000
life a divorce

444
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,320
a betrayal someone stabbed you in the

445
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,320
back and twisted the knife too hard

446
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,760
and which is terrible because that's

447
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,519
what happens out there maybe a couple of

448
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,519
emotional bullets hit you

449
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,560
because that happens every day out there

450
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,680
broken trust

451
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:05,440
dear lord broken trust betrayal

452
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,880
broken heart um everything and losses

453
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,800
that could that could also knock the

454
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,959
hair off your head years later

455
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,399
like three years later five years later

456
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,639
from a stressful event

457
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,880
you know i know i i have a friend who

458
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,519
had a big breakup

459
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,040
a big relationship breakup for her and

460
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,320
she was devastated

461
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:26,639
devastated it was three years ago and

462
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,600
her hair is just was just falling out

463
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,680
two years later after that

464
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,600
because your adrenals are running from

465
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,959
the emotional event all the time

466
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,399
and if you're someone who does caffeine

467
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,360
your adrenals are running during the

468
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,680
caffeine

469
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,480
and boom that hair is going to go for

470
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,680
women

471
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,519
it all it's it hinges on these things

472
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,760
sure a piece of chocolate it's harmless

473
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,440
i get it you know a cup of coffee is

474
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,160
harmless and espresso's harmless

475
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,320
sure but the hair falls out later and no

476
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,880
one wants to know no one no one cares or

477
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,079
no one

478
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,000
i don't know what it is it's the

479
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:00,880

480
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,240

leslie i drink coffee and have no hair

513
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:16,240
loss

514
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,240
yeah this is stupid you

515
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,680
it's really funny well here's how it

516
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,160
works okay

517
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,160
you can drink coffee for five years and

518
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,040
not have hair loss you can drink it for

519
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,800
two years

520
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,720
you can drink it for six years seven

521
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,600
years you could drink it a little longer

522
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,519
but it comes later and it comes later

523
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,880
for anybody and the timing doesn't

524
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,639
always have to be the same

525
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,880
i've seen 20 year olds drink it for a

526
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,639
couple of years and it all comes out

527
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,560
when they're 25 27

528
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:43,839
they're at these autoimmune doctors they

529
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,480
don't know what's wrong

530
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,040
alopecia is starting and you can drink

531
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,920
it for 10

532
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,519
15 years 18 years and keep your hair but

533
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,279
when you're now 65

534
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,560
it's all gonna fall out and then you're

535
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,720
wearing like a

536
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,560
a wig and so and then you're gonna be

537
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,839
laughing at me then maybe

538
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,759
and say oh he was so stupid but you know

539
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,559
remember me when the hair comes out down

540
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,039
the road

541
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:09,199
if you remember when you remember me

542
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,760
then then you can say wait a minute he

543
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:14,559

and what to take with me i'm vegan whoa

660
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,720
you're vegan

661
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:58,559
let's see that's incredible and i'm

662
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:02,159
using 32 ounces of celery juice

663
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:04,000
whoa that's that's that's a perfect

664
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,520
amount of celery juice really it is

665
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,679
that's so great

666
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,120
um you're doing the zinc you're doing

667
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,520
the lemon balm you're doing that well i

668
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,480
seen cats caught in spirulina fantastic

669
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,440
because you're keeping your immune

670
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,720
system strong

671
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,240
so the mold doesn't uh

672
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,080
break down your immune system that's

673
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,240
what you're doing so fern did you hear

674
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,240
my mold episode you probably heard that

675
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,400
um from medical media podcast at apple

676
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,240
podcast so what you're doing is

677
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,840
you're doing your celery juice which is

678
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,760
keeping your immune system strong

679
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,280
right it's also cleaning up any mold in

680
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,000
your system that could come in that's

681
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,200
incredible

682
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,799
you're doing your zinc to keep your

683
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,520
immune system strong so you don't react

684
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,440
to the mold

685
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,280
because that will help that'll help stop

686
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,080
you reacting to the mold

687
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,760
and um you're doing the lemon balm which

688
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,880
is really important for the nerves too

689
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,200
because mold can

690
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,520
start bothering things lysine cancer is

691
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:54,320
incredible so these are antivirals so

692
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,480
you're doing these antivirals to protect

693
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:59,520
your immune system so that mold

694
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,200
doesn't trigger something inside of you

695
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,559
so that's really smart fern i'm really

696
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,000
proud of you

697
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:07,440
i really am i really am so um

698
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,679
um so anyway you guys just want to

699
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,280
remind you we're going going to tick

700
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,559

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,760
i'm going to ig in a little bit then

702
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,960
we're going to tic tac but right now

703
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,880
we'll stay on here and we'll talk a

704
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,520
little bit for another one more minute

705
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,200
so fern um the belongings thing is

706
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:24,080
really the belonging things

707
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,720
is is tough what some of the things that

708
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,240
i've

709
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,840
some of the tricks that i've seen is you

710
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,360
put some stuff outside when the

711
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,440
weather's really nice

712
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,360
uh you can keep some of it in storage if

713
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,440
you have to until then but

714
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,280
the weather's nice you can put things

715
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,840
outside and i notice

716
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,559
that when they're outside you know in

717
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,039
the sun

718
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:45,200
in the fresh air sometimes it kind of

719
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:46,799
breaks it down and it starts to diminish

720
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,000
it diminish it diminish it it's one

721
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,320
little technique

722
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,440
it depends on how mouldy everything got

723
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:55,760
how moldy is it really is it so moldy

724
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,799
is it is it a is it is it a mold you

725
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,799
have tested

726
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:00,240
in the house and is it a really bad mold

727
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:03,360
out of all the molds

728
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:05,440
um or is it really the the usual that

729
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,960
everybody has kind of sprinkled about on

730
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,720
everything so all these things are

731
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,080
something to think about

732
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,919
