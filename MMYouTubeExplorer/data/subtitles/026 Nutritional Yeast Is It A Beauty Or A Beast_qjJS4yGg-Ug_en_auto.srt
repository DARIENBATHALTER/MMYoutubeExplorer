Williams we're talking about nutritional

15
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:54,559

25
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:25,759

hummus behind the deli counter that was

00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:15,720
loaded with nutritional yeast and

85
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:19,440
usually is my friend got me a bag of

86
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:21,120

93
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:40,440
like sunflower

nutritional yeast natural flavors too

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,479
but that's another story but nutritional

99
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:57,240
yeast he was like what is that yeast

100
00:04:55,479 --> 00:05:00,240
like the kind of baker's yeast I was go

101
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,440
no no no no it's different than that so

102
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,600
he said it's got to be good for you

103
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:09,639
right I mean it's a health food it hits

104
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:12,759
all the marks it's non GMO I'm like yeah

105
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:15,120
yeah it says that on the bag glutenfree

106
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:18,759
yeah says it on the bag no additive

107
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:21,759
preservatives uh-huh but I said to him

108
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:24,440
it's not as good as you think it is it's

109
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:28,240
not as good for people to eat as they

110
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:30,840
think it is but he said kale Kale's

111
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,520
amazing right I mean it's incredible I

112
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:37,720
said Kale's incredible Kale's amazing

113
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:39,520
for you yeah but it's dressed up to be

114
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,560
something more than just kale it's got

115
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,919
the nutritional yeast in it he goes okay

116
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:47,199
okay okay just tell me what's wrong with

117
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:49,840
the nutritional yeast so there's little

118
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:53,800
things about nutritional yeast that

119
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:56,680
aren't good and there's bigger things

120
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,720
about nutritional yeast that aren't good

121
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,000
we're going to start with the little

122
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:04,039
ones the nutritional yeast World hangs

123
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,800
their hat on the nutrition aspect of

124
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:08,800
nutritional yeast the nutrients like

125
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,400
you'll hear out there well it's got a

126
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,199
lot of vitamins it's got a lot of

127
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,000
minerals in there it's got a lot of

128
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:17,199
nutrients and it's like whoa I'm sold

129
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,199
right there and the nutritional yeast

130
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,360
World they got to be in it for the

131
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,919
goodness of everything the well-being of

132
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,680
everything because there's a lot of

133
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:28,319
nutrients in there and so that's the hat

134
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,039
right there they hang up on the hook so

135
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,560
it's this nutrient profile that makes it

136
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,880
really intriguing because you think

137
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,039
about it there's vitamins there's

138
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:40,720
nutrients there's minerals in there

139
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:43,599
where can you go wrong and that's the

140
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,840
whole point of nutritional yeast it's

141
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:49,400
yeast that happens to create

142
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:53,240
nutrients and so the nutrients inside

143
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:55,960
nutritional yeast are good for us so if

144
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:58,759
we're sick and unhealthy and have

145
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:01,319
problems this seems like a viable source

146
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:04,160
of nutrients to help our health and

147
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:06,960
well-being it's kind of an easy cell

148
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,879
it's like whoa nutritional yeast it's

149
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,360
loaded with vitamin A it's got some B's

150
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:13,639
in there it's got some different

151
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:16,360
nutrients this is perfect I need that

152
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:18,280
right now because I'm kind of sick I

153
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:21,400
don't feel good I'm always into my

154
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:26,639
health I'm looking for things to help me

155
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:29,360
so this works and whoa it tastes really

156
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,599
good so what's my problem withut

157
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,120
nutritional yeast all the nutrients it

158
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,199
has that's awesome think about it that's

159
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,160
really

160
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:41,720
incredible well to begin with it's not

161
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:44,159
that many nutrients that's just a start

162
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:47,479
because it's not as packed it's not as

163
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:50,440
dense the amounts of nutrients aren't

164
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:53,560
high that alone is tricky you can eat

165
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:56,000
one orange and you supersede it what

166
00:07:53,560 --> 00:08:00,039
nutritional yeast could ever offer you

167
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:03,319
if you eat one banana one tomato

168
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:06,599
one artichoke one asparagus you

169
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:11,440
superseded those nutrients and then some

170
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:14,400
quadruple Su tfold 20 fold a piece of

171
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:17,120
kale you blew nutritional yeast out of

172
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,879
the water the nutrient profile in the

173
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,120
nutritional yeast could not even stand

174
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:25,319
up to one leaf of

175
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:28,599
spinach one leaf of spinach the nutrient

176
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:29,879
profile through the roof nutritional

177
00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:34,360
yeast

178
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:38,080
not really at all it's so mild part of

179
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:41,000
why they fortify it a lot of companies

180
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:44,200
fortify it they add you know like white

181
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:48,399
bread processed white bread they got to

182
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:51,040
fortify it you got to enrich it it's

183
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:54,720
enriching that's what the companies do

184
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:57,040
the big manufacturers do so big

185
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:00,480
manufacturers they throw a whole bunch

186
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:03,720
of bulk vitamins in into the nutritional

187
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,839
yeast because in the end there really

188
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:08,640
isn't a lot of vitamins in the

189
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:11,880
nutritional yeast so they got to fortify

190
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:14,800
it just like white bread look I know the

191
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:17,600
deeper I get into this episode the more

192
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,079
friends I lose I understand that when it

193
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,560
comes down to n people are highly

194
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:25,079
protective over their n but let's go to

195
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,680
the other little problem I have so this

196
00:09:25,079 --> 00:09:29,800
one's a little different think about

197
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:33,240
this yeast

198
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:35,360
is not a plant right now I know there's

199
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,000
a lot of plant-based people out there

200
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,440
they want to eat plants I know there's a

201
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,600
lot of animal protein people out there

202
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:45,480
that want to eat plants you want to eat

203
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,480
your animal proteins if you're an animal

204
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:51,480
protein person and your plants and if

205
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:56,800
you're vegan or plant-based you want to

206
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:59,720
have your plants and your plants right

207
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:02,279
so where does the yeast come in that's

208
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:05,160
not a plant why are we getting all

209
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:07,800
excited about it why are we supporting

210
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:10,360
it so much why are we fighting for it so

211
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:15,760
much it's not a

212
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:18,000
plant plants are medicine plant food

213
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,320
medicine right if you believe animal

214
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,399
products are medicine because you eat

215
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:25,399
animal products well there you go you

216
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:27,399
can say that too but where's the yeast

217
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:29,920
what's going on with that see that's a

218
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:31,680
fungus that's fungi

219
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,680
that's not a

220
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:37,399
plant oh I get it wait wait wait wait

221
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:40,240
wait you're thinking mushrooms now think

222
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:42,000
like what's this guy talking about fungi

223
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:47,480
yeast it's a

224
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:52,360
mushroom no it's not it's different a

225
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:54,079
mushroom doesn't feed off of bad

226
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,320
things a

227
00:10:54,079 --> 00:11:01,079
mushroom doesn't

228
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:05,399
feed off of Bad Things things in order

229
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:10,040
to survive an edible mushroom so edible

230
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:13,720
mushrooms don't feed off of Highly toxic

231
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:15,519
substances in order to survive a yeast

232
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:19,480
will and then you're thinking well wait

233
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:21,160
a minute the yeast nutritional yeast is

234
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:25,480
feeding off of

235
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:28,360
beets so that's not a highly toxic thing

236
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:30,160
it's feeding off of beets that shouldn't

237
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:33,240
be a problem

238
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:35,880
it's a really big problem I told you you

239
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:39,160
better fasten your seat bels so now

240
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:42,240
let's talk about this a bit an edible

241
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:46,839
mushroom doesn't just care about

242
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:50,200
itself an edible mushroom knows

243
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:53,720
someone's going to feed off of it a wild

244
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:56,560
animal an animal in the woods a certain

245
00:11:53,720 --> 00:12:00,040
variety of insect specifically large

246
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:04,480
insects too people

247
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:08,399
humans it doesn't grow for itself edible

248
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:11,519
mushrooms grow for the person they grow

249
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:15,160
for human life animal life to

250
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:18,600
consume yeast grows for

251
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:22,079
itself it devours what it wants for

252
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:26,560
itself and it doesn't matter if what it

253
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:29,360
devours is extremely highly toxic sure

254
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:32,279
we can take yeast and we can throw it on

255
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:35,160
something that's not highly highly toxic

256
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:39,279
and it'll feed off of it but it will

257
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:43,600
feed off of it only for itself not for

258
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:47,800
consumption of itself not for an animal

259
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:50,920
or a human to feed off of but wait wait

260
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:56,040
wait wait you got me you think you got

261
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:58,399
me candida candida I talk about that you

262
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:02,279
know it's inside our intestinal tract it

263
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:05,959
feeds off of things right but you're not

264
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:06,880
supposed to be scraping someone's colon

265
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:10,040
of

266
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,760
candida and eating it you're not

267
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:14,160
supposed to be scraping out your own

268
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,639
candida or somebody else's candida out

269
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,560
of their intestinal track trying to grow

270
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:22,120
it so you can package it up and then

271
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:24,720
sprinkle it on all the food you want eat

272
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,600
it every single day hey I got my candido

273
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,600
over here you guys I got a big bag of it

274
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,399
you want it on your popcorn let me put

275
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,560
on

276
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:35,360
hey you guys did you get your popcorn I

277
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:40,079
got a whole big bucket of candida right

278
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:42,560
here came out of a a a guy down the road

279
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:44,560
he said he would grow it for me so he

280
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:47,680
kept on eating all this crappy food and

281
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:50,079
he's just yes candida was Goblin all

282
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,079
that garbage he was eating all that

283
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:54,959
stuff in his gut and he had so much

284
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:57,920
candida that you know he had a a

285
00:13:54,959 --> 00:14:00,440
physician scrape it out and a colon

286
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:03,440
hydrotherapist uh get it out and then

287
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:05,199
they grew it I got barrels of this stuff

288
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,600
man it's better than nutritional yeast

289
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:10,320
you got to try this hey bring your

290
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,600
popcorn over here okay here here it goes

291
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:16,519
what do you think it's good right it's

292
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:18,480
real good if you think that a portella

293
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:21,079
mushroom you know the big old portabella

294
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,000
mushrooms you buy in the store it's like

295
00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:24,360
honey I want to throw one on the grill

296
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,440
I'm going to make everybody some

297
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:29,399
portella mushrooms I got a whole package

298
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:34,720
of them here if you think that the Cella

299
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:37,959
mushroom is the same thing as yeast then

300
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:40,480
you're terribly mistaken no disrespect

301
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:43,519
but terribly mistaken so you might be

302
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:46,600
somebody that's like he's wrong still

303
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:49,199
all fungi fungi family they're all the

304
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:52,399
same they're all doing the same thing

305
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:54,480
he's wrong well let's take a look at the

306
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:59,160
plants for a second so I said before

307
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:02,639
plants are plants right fungi fungi okay

308
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:05,519
I get it but not even all plants are the

309
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,880
same so I'm scratching my head on this

310
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,399
one

311
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,199
because I just told my friend he can

312
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:13,240
actually take all the poison ivy out of

313
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,959
his yard he pulled it off of the oak

314
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:20,160
tree and then picked it up all the

315
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:23,360
ground and he had a barrel of poison ivy

316
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:26,120
and I said since it's a plant it's the

317
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:30,639
same thing he can do what he wants with

318
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:33,160
it so he made a poison an ivy bed and he

319
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,759
slept on it last night he said it was

320
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:37,880
soft and comfortable he's in the

321
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:41,560
hospital right now but the point is is

322
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:44,079
that I think I made a mistake because I

323
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:47,519
since it's a plant I told them it's all

324
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:50,240
plants and he's a vegan by the way and

325
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:52,040
this plants are all the same so because

326
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,839
fungi are all the same too PTO Bell

327
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:57,279
mushrooms same thing as yeast uh that's

328
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,480
what everybody tells me out there all

329
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:02,480
the Geniuses so so I I just figured the

330
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,880
poison ivy is the same thing as

331
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,759
asparagus and so he decided cuz it was

332
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,120
really soft and comfortable he made this

333
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:13,880
massive bed of poison IV and he slept on

334
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:15,880
it last night and um his his partner and

335
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:19,199
him are both in the hospital right now

336
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:20,839
on steroids because the truth is yeast

337
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,639
is not a

338
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:27,160
mushroom that's the truth a big old

339
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:30,600
portella mushroom a shant tril a button

340
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:34,360
mushroom a baby Pella a bear's mushroom

341
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:36,600
whatever it's not the same thing as

342
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:39,360
yeast they're different

343
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:42,360
creatures oh wait I think somebody out

344
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:45,160
there has me again uh-oh they're saying

345
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:47,560
well poison ivy yeah that's a poisonous

346
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:51,959
plant duh it's not going to be an

347
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:54,319
asparagus so um excuse me aw but

348
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:57,480
nutritional yeast isn't poisonous we

349
00:16:54,319 --> 00:16:59,240
don't get poisoned when we eat it so got

350
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,839
you there

351
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:06,000
well all right let me just tell you this

352
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:09,240
one now yeast is a cleaner upper it's a

353
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:13,360
fungi that's there to clean and eat

354
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:16,000
anything and everything okay poison ivy

355
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:18,280
is a plant it's growing out of the

356
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,799
ground same Earth as you can grow

357
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:22,919
lettuce and everything else and you can

358
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:24,839
have a garden with lettuce tomatoes

359
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:26,679
cucumbers anything you want in there

360
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:29,160
asparagus and then you can have poison

361
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:30,520
ivy growing right out of that garden

362
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:34,160
soil

363
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:36,480
too yeast is a whole different Beast you

364
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:39,480
can have that growing on something

365
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,679
highly toxic even

366
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:44,440
dangerous and it will

367
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:47,080
grow right off of it and doesn't have a

368
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:50,880
filter or a processing system like a big

369
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:54,400
old mushroom portello can grow out of

370
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:57,400
some poop but it will take in the good

371
00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:00,159
stuff to make it into a portabella

372
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:03,600
mushroom same way a tomato plant can

373
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:06,720
grow out of poop it'll take in the good

374
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:09,520
stuff turn it into a juicy tomato and

375
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:13,120
it's safe and you can eat

376
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:15,000
it well yeast isn't like that yeast will

377
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,559
grow off something highly toxic and if

378
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,880
you eat that yeast you

379
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:23,640
die okay nutritional yeast well it's not

380
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,520
highly toxic and you can eat it and you

381
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:28,880
don't die because they didn't throw that

382
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:32,600
yeast onto something super high

383
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:36,520
toxic but if they did there'd be no

384
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:39,280
filter there'd be no body and no filter

385
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:44,000
system it actually will grow and become

386
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:45,200
as toxic to what it's growing on equal

387
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,120
and that's a

388
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:52,720
difference similar to snails and slugs

389
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:55,559
snails and slugs don't have a filtration

390
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:58,440
system they can feed off of something

391
00:18:55,559 --> 00:19:02,360
highly toxic and then if you eat that

392
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:06,080
snail or eat that slug you can die now

393
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:09,799
if a snail and a slug is not feeding off

394
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:13,400
of foliage or any kind of waste that is

395
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:15,240
highly toxic you can boil that snail and

396
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,640
you can have your escargo or any kind of

397
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,480
other snails there's so many different

398
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,640
snails and varieties out there fresh

399
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:24,520
water salt water whatever but if your

400
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:28,280
snail is feeding on something that's not

401
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:30,080
highly toxic and your slug slugs too are

402
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:32,960
feeding on something that's not highly

403
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,880
toxic you can then boil them up and eat

404
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:38,760
them but that slug if you don't know

405
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:43,400
where that slugs been if that slug was

406
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:46,360
on some dangerous plants dangerous

407
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:48,320
foliage dangerous sludge somewhere and

408
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:50,799
you picked up that Slug and said whoa I

409
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,840
know I can boil you and eat you you can

410
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:55,440
you actually eat slugs and you go and

411
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:58,280
boil it and eat it and then you die or

412
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,799
get deathly ill because that slug didn't

413
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:04,200
have filtration system and actually ate

414
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:06,280
what was toxic stayed in it and it

415
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:10,000
became highly toxic well that's what

416
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:14,240
East can do so let's head now to what

417
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:18,000
really bothers me like the big boy let's

418
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:21,159
go there now okay yeast nutritional

419
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,679
yeast is not toxic because you're eating

420
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:26,720
it you got your yeast it's all good and

421
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:30,159
I'm going to grab mine right

422
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,600
now I got my nutritional use right here

423
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,720
and you know what's interesting about

424
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,159
this nutritional use bag that I have

425
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,960
well it says n

426
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,960
GMO n

427
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:47,640
GMO I got peace in my heart peace in my

428
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:50,280
mind peace in my soul I'm doing a little

429
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:54,480
happy dance right here got my n GMO

430
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:58,240
stuff going and uh that's just freaking

431
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:02,760
awesome you know put wait I got a bomb

432
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:05,760
to drop oh my God I just realized right

433
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:10,400
now what a fool I've

434
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:15,080
been stupid ass I am the primary food

435
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:18,679
source for yeast nutritional yeast is

436
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:19,840
GMO beats what the hell was I thinking

437
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:22,640
all these

438
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:25,679
years I've been gobbling this stuff by

439
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,679
the truckloads

440
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:33,720
man I just realized it just now this

441
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:38,480
very second the primary source of food

442
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:42,600
for the yeast to grow on is GMO beat

443
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:44,919
it's sugary beats it's sugar beats like

444
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:48,600
oh my God like

445
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:50,039
du anyway you guys that's the big boy

446
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,559
right there and I'm going to tell you

447
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:57,279
something about that big boy that really

448
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:58,960
scares me the yeast becomes what it eats

449
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:03,520
you have to remember remember that yeah

450
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:06,679
of course I get it on paper they can say

451
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,840
technically it's not GMO so they can put

452
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:10,520
that on the package they can put it

453
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:12,640
right on there I'm grabbing the package

454
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:16,400
again says n

455
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:22,520
GMO that's interesting because all this

456
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:24,960
yeast that grew grew on GMO beats whoa

457
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:28,760
you guys are sneaky man you guys are

458
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:30,120
really really sneaky the type of yeast

459
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:34,240
they're using

460
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:37,200
sacris is growing on GMO sugar beet

461
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,039
remember when I said that yeast becomes

462
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,960
what it

463
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:47,240
eats that means nutritional yeast

464
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:49,679
becomes that GMO product but Legally

465
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:52,559
Legally they don't have to make that

466
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:54,799
connection for you on the package they

467
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:57,520
don't have to and they're not going to

468
00:22:54,799 --> 00:23:00,400
shut down their yeast factories just

469
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:03,880
because of that minor little detail oh

470
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,799
wait oh my God you think I'm wrong again

471
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:08,960
because your nutritional East that

472
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:11,919
you're eating it's growing on molasses

473
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:16,159
they grow that one on molasses right so

474
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:19,720
I must be wrong again molasses is sugar

475
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:21,559
beat oh wait wait you got me again now I

476
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:24,080
think I think he got me again right

477
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:28,919
you're saying that the company you talk

478
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:34,080
to the sugar beads they use aren't GMO

479
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:36,600
oh really really all sugar beads are GMO

480
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:39,240
cross-contamination has happened the

481
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:41,080
majority of sugar beads used in

482
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:44,000
nutritional yeast making and

483
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:47,200
Manufacturing are 100%

484
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:51,240
GMO the small portion of sugar beads

485
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:52,400
that aren't 100% GMO are still 100% GMO

486
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,720
by cross

487
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,080
contamination the nutritional yeast

488
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,000
factories their phones are going to be

489
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,360
ringing off the hook after this podcast

490
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,320
comes out and they're going to be

491
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:06,679
telling everybody a really nice bedtime

492
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:10,240
story they're going to say oh no no no

493
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:12,799
no no not our Factory we have the best

494
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:16,200
quality beets you've ever seen our

495
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:17,960
nutritional yeast is all good and pure

496
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,559
they're going to make you feel nice and

497
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:22,039
good so you can keep your addiction

498
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:24,360
strong and we're going to go into the

499
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:26,320
addictive nature of it pretty soon but

500
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:30,240
we still have some horror stories to

501
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:34,080
tell with the GMO Factor now the problem

502
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:37,559
with fungus yeast that type of fungus it

503
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,919
has the ability to adapt change change

504
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:43,240
its chemical

505
00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:46,039
structure change its nature to

506
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:47,919
survive that's what yeast does that's

507
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:50,880
why when someone has a yeast

508
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:52,000
infection they go to the doctor they

509
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,399
take an

510
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:58,360
antifungal it goes away they get another

511
00:24:55,399 --> 00:24:59,799
yeast infection go to the doctor

512
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:02,880
take the same

513
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:05,559
antifungal and it's very tricky and

514
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,919
stubborn and it doesn't go away and then

515
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:11,440
they have to give that patient extra

516
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:13,799
antifungal finally it goes away then

517
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:16,799
they get another yeast infection go to

518
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:20,120
the doctor and then they have to give

519
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:22,159
them another type of antifungal because

520
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:24,760
you can't use the other antifungals it

521
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:27,520
adapted to those antifungals it

522
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:28,640
acclimated it over roded it Rose above

523
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:32,840
it

524
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:35,600
yeast has an intelligence to save itself

525
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:39,919
it has the ability to change so when

526
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:43,919
it's on top of GMO food molasses GMO

527
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:47,200
sugar beat it actually Alters itself

528
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:50,840
because GMO foods are toxic they have

529
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:52,360
toxins in them GMO toxins the yeast

530
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:56,279
changes its

531
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:58,600
structure it changes its actual cell

532
00:25:56,279 --> 00:26:02,399
structure but no no one's monitoring

533
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:04,679
that no one cares just pump that stuff

534
00:26:02,399 --> 00:26:08,440
out to the masses have them eat it all

535
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:11,320
they want more GMO sugar beets come in

536
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:14,520
which is highly toxic because it's a GMO

537
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:18,159
product and then the cell structure of

538
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:21,039
the yeast changes and changes meanwhile

539
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:23,039
no one's going to get $250 million the

540
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:25,000
magic number to get a group of

541
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:28,679
scientists together to take a little

542
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:32,279
lucky L at what's going wrong like

543
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:34,240
Frankenstein yeast Franken yeast no

544
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:36,360
one's going to take a peek into it you

545
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:39,760
know rosec colored glasses got to have

546
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:41,320
them on rosecolor glasses call the

547
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,000
nutritional yeast Factory and you're

548
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:47,720
going to

549
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:50,919
get nutritional yeast Factory here hello

550
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:53,240
hello yes yes what's your concern

551
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:56,360
customer uh

552
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:58,440
GMO there's no GMO in our nutritional

553
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:01,559
yeast huh

554
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:03,960
what kind of talk is that I'm sorry are

555
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:06,480
you saying that we're using GMO sugar

556
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:09,799
beat well um

557
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:13,000
maybe yeah and the and the yeast is

558
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:15,399
growing off the sugar beat uh yes it's

559
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,240
growing off our molasses yes yes our

560
00:27:15,399 --> 00:27:19,159
good

561
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:21,399
molasses yes and and then uh what the

562
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:24,080
yeast is turning into something you mean

563
00:27:21,399 --> 00:27:28,159
it's it's growing off the GMO and it's

564
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:30,919
changing its cell structure the hogwash

565
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:34,320
oh goash that doesn't even make any

566
00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:36,720
sense yes yes we have the Finest

567
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:39,799
nutritional yeast there is we sell it to

568
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:42,679
all great places health food stores use

569
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:46,120
it I actually take it myself I like my

570
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:48,360
nutritional yeast um I just don't really

571
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:51,679
think there's a lot of Merit in this

572
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:53,679
this uh this GMO thing we're not GMO we

573
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:56,080
say it on the package we have every

574
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:58,279
legal right to say it's not GMO on the

575
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:01,279
package but yes

576
00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:02,960
well I believe oh we'll we'll bring this

577
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:06,720
up in the next meeting and the next

578
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:08,640
board meeting but I mean I listen I'll

579
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,000
give you some free would you like a free

580
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,600
order I'll give you a free order sent to

581
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:17,600
your address would that make you feel

582
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:21,559
better okay okay that's what we'll do

583
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:24,120
see yeast doesn't like to die and yeast

584
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:28,039
doesn't like to be challenged so when

585
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:30,120
it's up against a predator like GMO

586
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:32,640
because GMO foods are actually a

587
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:38,080
predator food that's not a food to help

588
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:40,360
nurture us help heal us help fortify us

589
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:43,279
it's actually a predator food it's

590
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:47,559
designed in a lab it's dangerous we know

591
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:50,200
that about GMO food but fungus likes to

592
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:52,880
rise above it when it's up against

593
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:57,640
confrontation like that it changes its

594
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:59,640
cell structure it changes how it thrives

595
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:01,919
and how it grows because the yeast

596
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:04,919
doesn't want to die it wants to live

597
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:07,760
forever that's what yeast does that's

598
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:09,480
why a baker with Baker yeast which is

599
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:13,039
still yeast it's a little different but

600
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:16,200
it's still yeast can keep yeast alive

601
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:18,760
for a thousand years it can be in the

602
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:21,200
lineage of somebody in their home and

603
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:24,279
they can keep that yeast alive for

604
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:27,080
centuries it could be centuries old

605
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:29,559
yeast it doesn't like to die instead it

606
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:32,279
likees to adapt and when you give it

607
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:35,360
something toxic and dangerous to adapt

608
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:39,440
to you don't have the same yeast you

609
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:41,320
once had you have more of a

610
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:45,000
non-world

611
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:48,919
non-natural more of a super fungus just

612
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:52,039
like a super bacteria like MCA but you

613
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:55,760
end up with a super fungus fungus can

614
00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:58,080
alter its own cell structure so it never

615
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:01,880
has to Forfeit a battle

616
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:05,120
and die it won't succumb to the law of

617
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:07,640
nature meaning the law of death it won't

618
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:11,159
succumb to being poisoned by something

619
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:13,960
unnatural and highly toxic instead it'll

620
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:16,399
supersede it and that's when yeast turns

621
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:19,799
into a Frankenstein yeast a Franken

622
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:22,799
yeast and it holds that toxin Superior

623
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:26,159
within itself it's being that GMO

624
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:29,480
product and reproduces itself over and

625
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:32,559
over again with that GMO product within

626
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:34,840
itself and that leads to another scary

627
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:38,480
thing kind of get ready for this one

628
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:41,360
fast in your seat belts nutritional

629
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:44,279
nutritional nutritional vitamins

630
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:46,399
minerals nutrients we're eating the

631
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:47,799
nutritional yeast because obviously

632
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:49,519
we're addicted and we'll talk about the

633
00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:51,720
addiction part A little later but we're

634
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:56,279
eating it too because we think it's good

635
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:58,600
for us we keep on being told that it's

636
00:30:56,279 --> 00:31:01,720
packed with vitamins and minerals and

637
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:04,360
nutrients so we say okay great this is

638
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:08,080
nutritional it's got vitamin B it's got

639
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:10,399
all this in it and this is great but no

640
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:12,519
one's realizing

641
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:16,039
something those are

642
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:18,760
GMO vitamins and nutrients that's what

643
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:21,360
nutrients those are the nutrients and

644
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:25,960
vitamins that the yeast

645
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:27,760
created from the GMO sugar beat becomes

646
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:31,960
a GMO new

647
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:35,039
nutrient GMO nutrients aren't fit for

648
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:38,279
human consumption they're not fit for

649
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:41,519
the human body our bodies can't thrive

650
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:44,639
on those nutrients they don't help us

651
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:47,320
heal they don't refill our

652
00:31:44,639 --> 00:31:52,960
deficiencies they help us become

653
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:55,360
deficient GMO food pushes a person into

654
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,880
deficient land into

655
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:01,519
deficiencies the yeast is is growing off

656
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:06,080
of the GMO sugar bead developing and

657
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:08,600
creating its own Frankenstein vitamins

658
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:10,840
and that's what we're consuming another

659
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:14,679
thing which is really interesting

660
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:18,039
there's no regulation determining that

661
00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:20,240
your yeast you're growing has to be on

662
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:22,840
molasses GMO

663
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:25,679
molasses you can grow your yeast on

664
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:27,799
anything you choose as long as that

665
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:30,639
yeast will feed on it

666
00:32:27,799 --> 00:32:35,279
grow you can then package it up and sell

667
00:32:30,639 --> 00:32:39,080
it so the gray area is really scary so

668
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:42,840
yes the majority of the production is

669
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:45,320
all about molasses which is GMO but

670
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:47,480
there are some people out there they're

671
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:50,320
picking anything they want to choose

672
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:52,799
from doesn't matter what food it is GMO

673
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:55,639
food for sure it could be anything it

674
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:58,440
could be sewage it could be engine oil

675
00:32:55,639 --> 00:33:01,880
it can be petroleum

676
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:04,240
petroleum ready it can be petroleum

677
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:08,760
byproduct did you know that there is

678
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:12,200
Baker yeasts that grow off of oil waste

679
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:14,720
petroleum byproduct so that means

680
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:16,880
anybody can legally do that you can open

681
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,320
up a nutritional yeast Factory get a

682
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:22,159
petroleum byproduct or something toxic

683
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:24,200
like a sewage or a sludge from petroleum

684
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:27,159
byproduct throw a whole bunch of yeast

685
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:29,200
on it in it in your own of course

686
00:33:27,159 --> 00:33:32,320
sterile containers it doesn't matter you

687
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:35,159
can still use the same facility the same

688
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:37,240
structure but you're using the sludge or

689
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:39,320
the engine oil or the petroleum

690
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:41,840
byproduct and waste and you're growing

691
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:43,720
the yeast off of that and that's the

692
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:46,919
yeast you're creating and now packaging

693
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:49,480
and selling it's been done before they

694
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:51,440
do it with baker's yeast they can do it

695
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:54,000
with nutritional yeast and there's no

696
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:57,320
rules there's no regulations and there's

697
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:00,159
no nutritional yeast police police leing

698
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:03,639
it and governing it just like there's no

699
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:06,120
real marijuana cannabis police that are

700
00:34:03,639 --> 00:34:08,599
governing if someone sees an apit attack

701
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:10,960
on marijuana leaves that they can take a

702
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:13,040
can of raid and just shoot it all over

703
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,440
the place and shoot the plant down to

704
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:18,560
kill off those aphids no one's watching

705
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:21,040
that either the regulations aren't there

706
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:24,359
so what happens when we eat nutritional

707
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:25,919
yeast and it's Franken yeast so we're

708
00:34:24,359 --> 00:34:27,399
chewing it we're eating it we're

709
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:30,679
swallowing it

710
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:33,839
it's this yeast That Grew off of GMO

711
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:36,679
beads it altered its self structure it

712
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:39,040
became something different it adapted we

713
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:42,720
then consumed it ate it it went down

714
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:45,599
into our intestinal tract and now it

715
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:48,599
becomes food for something else so this

716
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:50,399
will be interesting to know but yeast

717
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:55,079
eats

718
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:57,400
yeast yeast consumes yeast so now you

719
00:34:55,079 --> 00:34:59,880
have yeast inside your gut you have

720
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:01,800
yeast in your small intestinal tract you

721
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:05,000
have yeast in your large intestinal

722
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:07,760
tract people have yeast on the rectum

723
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,760
every day just a big hunk of yeast is

724
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:15,640
just right on the edge of the

725
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:19,200
rectum yeast devours yeast problem here

726
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:21,520
though you have yeast inside of you like

727
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:25,280
candida that's going to have to then

728
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:28,599
feed off of this yeast the nutritional

729
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:31,560
yeast that has died you've consumed it

730
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:33,560
you've eaten it and it's not the same

731
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:36,000
kind of yeast it's a different yeast but

732
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:40,480
it's an altered yeast it's made

733
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:44,280
primarily out of GMO food so here you go

734
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:48,119
your yeast now is consuming a different

735
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:49,040
yeast that has information in it yeast

736
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:52,760
is

737
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:56,319
intelligent it holds information as it's

738
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:57,480
gobbling up the Franken yeast it's

739
00:35:56,319 --> 00:35:59,720
computing

740
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:02,560
it's digesting information it's

741
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:05,400
receiving information it can change the

742
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:09,119
structure of the yeast that we naturally

743
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:11,200
have in us now we have bad yeast in us

744
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:13,359
we got good yeast in us we got a

745
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:15,400
combination of a few different yeasts

746
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:17,800
some people have even more some people

747
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:21,480
may have 10 varieties of yeast some

748
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:23,599
people may just have two but either way

749
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:27,319
it changes the yeast that we naturally

750
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:30,680
have in us because as that yeast is

751
00:36:27,319 --> 00:36:33,040
cleaning up all that dead GMO yeast that

752
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:35,760
changed and the cell structure changed

753
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:37,640
and everything about it altered for

754
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:40,480
survival for

755
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:43,400
adaptation as our yeast gobbles up that

756
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:46,240
yeast our yeast starts to adapt and

757
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:49,599
change and if it's a bad yeast inside of

758
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:53,240
us it could adapt and change and create

759
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:55,599
infections that won't respond to

760
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:57,960
antifungals at the doctor's office or in

761
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:59,760
the hospital so now we're in trouble

762
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:03,720
there and then if it's a good yeast

763
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:06,640
inside of us it can alter and change and

764
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:09,240
end up becoming a bad yeast and so the

765
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:11,240
good yeast inside of us eats the bad

766
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,839
yeast and starts to change now what if

767
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:16,240
you're somebody that collected a lot of

768
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:19,000
yeast in your day public bathrooms

769
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:21,560
collecting it there restaurants eating

770
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,079
out a lot collecting it there

771
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:26,480
relationships Partners collecting it

772
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:28,839
there hospital visits collecting it

773
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,560
there there you could be somebody that

774
00:37:28,839 --> 00:37:33,720
has a lot of different varieties of

775
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:35,440
yeast all kinds of yeast and then we're

776
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:37,640
putting in that nutritional yeast and

777
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:39,119
we're training and teaching all these

778
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:42,240
other different yeasts that are inside

779
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:44,400
of us to be different and that's where

780
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:48,079
things can go wrong that's where chaos

781
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:50,160
can ensue it's because our yeast will

782
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:52,480
start to learn behavior taking

783
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:55,400
information from yeast that isn't

784
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:58,079
supposed to even be here on any level

785
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:59,720
meanwhile somebody's micro biome doctor

786
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,920
like who's trying to help somebody with

787
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:02,760
the good of their heart and they're

788
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:05,359
using all their expertise that they have

789
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:07,200
doesn't even know any of this and they

790
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:09,680
might even be like hey nutritional yeast

791
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:12,040
is fortified and it's got vitamins and

792
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:14,319
minerals and oh you can keep that in

793
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:16,480
there just make sure you don't do any

794
00:38:14,319 --> 00:38:19,599
celery juice but make sure you have your

795
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,800
nutritional yeast there okay so let's go

796
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:23,720
to the next big one if you're still into

797
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,640
your nutritional yeast I don't blame you

798
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:27,599
it's hard to let it go and it's

799
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:30,240
addictive and we we'll head there don't

800
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:32,800
worry but there's one other pink

801
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:36,359
elephant in the room and we're gonna

802
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:39,079
have to talk about it it's glutamic acid

803
00:38:36,359 --> 00:38:41,440
whoa I know it I know it I know it I

804
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:44,400
know what's happening right now a bunch

805
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,800
of Ed guys are probably like okay he

806
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,760
doesn't know anything about this there's

807
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:51,839
no MSG in this at all my nutritional

808
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:56,079
yeast doesn't have MSG it's welln it's

809
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:59,400
not MSG so he'll say glutamic acid he's

810
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:03,680
trying to trick us but he's

811
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:07,440
wrong all right here it goes glutamic

812
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:12,079
acid isn't all plants it's in all

813
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:13,480
foods it's an acid that's everywhere so

814
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:16,760
why is it a big deal that's in

815
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:19,319
nutritional yeast like who hears it's in

816
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:22,880
everything because nutritional yeast is

817
00:39:19,319 --> 00:39:26,640
a yeast that's why we're talking about

818
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:30,040
glutamic acid in a yeast we're not

819
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:33,680
talking about glutamic acid in an

820
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:38,880
asparagus artichoke Brussels sprout

821
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:40,880
banana potato green apple berry we're

822
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:45,040
not talking about that we're not talking

823
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:48,680
about glutamic acid in Dairy yes in eggs

824
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:51,240
and meat and chicken even pork that's

825
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:53,640
got glutamic acid in it but it's in all

826
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:57,480
the different foods but how much is it

827
00:39:53,640 --> 00:40:01,200
in the different foods for example Le if

828
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:05,680
it's in an asparagus a Brussels sprout a

829
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:09,160
potato a carrot it's a lot less it's a

830
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:14,319
lower amount of glutamic acid another

831
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:18,480
thing too fungi is not a plant it's a

832
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:23,520
different form of glutamic acid animal

833
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:25,960
products most animals are eating plants

834
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:29,680
so those animals are eating plants

835
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:32,079
they're lamic acid is coming from

836
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:33,359
concentrations of the plant Foods

837
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:37,319
they're

838
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:40,000
consuming but ounce for ounce pound for

839
00:40:37,319 --> 00:40:43,599
pound it's not a lot of glutamic acid

840
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,160
compared to yeast and people get carried

841
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:46,839
away with their yeast do you know

842
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:49,079
anybody who gets carried away with their

843
00:40:46,839 --> 00:40:52,480
nutritional yeast because I know some

844
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:55,760
people they throw it on everything they

845
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:58,960
make a lot of food with it there's not a

846
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:01,920
lot of glut GLC acid in a carrot not a

847
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:05,560
lot of glutamic acid in a cucumber or

848
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:08,960
green apple or red apple or a Cherry

849
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:11,800
Berry a watermelon but it's highly

850
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:14,280
concentrated in yeast highly

851
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:18,200
concentrated in nutritional yeast

852
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:20,880
because nutritional yeast is a small

853
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:23,440
microorganism a small microorganism with

854
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:25,800
a lot of glutamic acid within it and

855
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:29,079
then we take a large amount of that

856
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:32,640
microorg organism we concentrate it it

857
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:35,880
becomes a powder it turns out it becomes

858
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:39,040
an MSG powder without having to add

859
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:41,400
MSG now remember the scientists they're

860
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,839
not going to do that looky L into things

861
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,240
they're not going to look at the yeast

862
00:41:42,839 --> 00:41:47,319
that's feeding off of the GMO beats and

863
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:49,480
determine that that yeast is changing

864
00:41:47,319 --> 00:41:53,319
and adapting they're not going to spend

865
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:55,040
the $250 million from a grant to get a

866
00:41:53,319 --> 00:41:57,200
group of scientists to do that but

867
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:59,800
they're also not going to get a grant

868
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:01,359
for $250 million to have a bunch of

869
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:04,200
scientists look at the different

870
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:05,720
glutamic acid structures because they're

871
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:08,400
different compounds coming from

872
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:11,160
different places so a green apple

873
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:13,440
glutamic acid much different than a

874
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:15,240
yeast glutamic acid and they're not

875
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,440
going to take the time to do the lookie

876
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:21,160
look to do the looky L to take a look

877
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:23,839
and be like whoa wait a minute that

878
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:27,760
yeast that produces a different form of

879
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:28,839
glutamic acid and it's more concentrated

880
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,760
and it's

881
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:35,319
aggressive because that's what it is a

882
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:40,040
yeast glutamic acid is an aggressive

883
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:42,520
nature different than a carrot than a

884
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:44,640
steak but what they need to do the

885
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:48,640
scientists need to isolate the glutamic

886
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:51,359
acid from yeast take that isolation take

887
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:54,880
that concentration and feed it to mice

888
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:57,839
and they can watch the mice and their

889
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:01,000
behavior hey did you give the mouse the

890
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:04,800
glutamic acid tablet the glutamic acid

891
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:08,400
tablet the mouse ate the other Mouse the

892
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:11,640
Mouse is dead he ate the other Mouse he

893
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:14,680
had an anchor fit and now he wants more

894
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:17,960
glutamic acid tablets I went to the cage

895
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:21,200
and he ran up to me and he jumped up and

896
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:24,119
he want my other glutamic acid

897
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:27,160
tablet yeah he killed the other

898
00:43:24,119 --> 00:43:29,280
Mouse but no one's keeping tabs they're

899
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:31,079
not keeping tabs of the GMO beats

900
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,960
they're feeding the yeast they're not

901
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:35,880
keeping tabs of the yeast and how it

902
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:37,920
actually evolves they're not keeping

903
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:39,640
tabs of the glutamic acid production

904
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:43,680
inside the yeast and the fact that the

905
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:47,200
glutamic acid production is actually GMO

906
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:50,119
it's a glutamic acid that's GMO no one's

907
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:52,079
keeping tabs of that and of course

908
00:43:50,119 --> 00:43:53,760
they're not keeping tabs of the fact

909
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:56,079
that the glutamic acid is different than

910
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:58,280
any other type of glutamic acid than the

911
00:43:56,079 --> 00:44:01,760
the type of glutamic acid that's in meat

912
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:04,200
beef poultry vegetables fruit to

913
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:06,440
different Beast all on its own and no

914
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:09,079
one's informing anybody about the

915
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:11,599
dosages how much they're consuming how

916
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:14,520
much they're eating and is it storing up

917
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:18,800
somewhere glutamic acid can store up in

918
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:20,599
the brain so wait a minute here we're

919
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:23,319
eating all this glutamic acid

920
00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:26,040
concentrated forms of it in a lot of

921
00:44:23,319 --> 00:44:27,920
yeast we're putting on our food we're

922
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:31,200
assuming large amounts of this gamic

923
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:36,000
acid where is it going it goes to the

924
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:38,480
brain so all this GMO gamic acid ends up

925
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,240
inside our brain no one's keeping tabs

926
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,520
on that either now let's talk about

927
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:45,280
dosages I see people they're pouring it

928
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:47,240
on they're giving it to their children

929
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:49,800
and it's not their fault they're just

930
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:52,440
being told it's good for them so that's

931
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:54,720
the sad part all on its own people are

932
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:56,599
being very generous with the helpings I

933
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,640
know somebody there like taking a

934
00:44:56,599 --> 00:45:00,119
scooper and it's a scooper they use and

935
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,920
they use this big old scooper and it

936
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:04,240
just goes in all their food they make

937
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:07,400
dishes they make rose you know where

938
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:09,720
you're making soups and stews or making

939
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:12,319
dressings and ruse people throw it on

940
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:14,079
their salads they throw it on their meat

941
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:16,400
they throw it on their chicken they

942
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:18,160
throw it on all the food they're making

943
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:20,119
some people just eat it out of their

944
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:22,079
hand they're just popping it in their

945
00:45:20,119 --> 00:45:24,839
mouth left and right right out of the

946
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:26,680
bag they put it on their granola they

947
00:45:24,839 --> 00:45:28,720
have it on their snacks

948
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:29,880
they have it on everything people just

949
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,640
pop it in their mouth as they're

950
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:34,200
coughing and choking on it sometimes

951
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:38,160
because you can inhale it by accident

952
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:41,440
it's extremely addictive because yeast

953
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:44,880
glutamic acid mimics

954
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:47,359
MSG it becomes the ultimate comfort food

955
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:50,760
for so many people and I don't blame

956
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:53,200
them one bit I'm not judging anybody

957
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:55,440
okay I know we go through a lot of

958
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:57,319
hardships and struggles a lot of stress

959
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:00,440
and when we we find a comfort food that

960
00:45:57,319 --> 00:46:03,880
feels good to us an emotional connection

961
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:06,400
happens and we use it as an anchor

962
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:09,359
nutritional yeast is a comfort food for

963
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:11,599
so many people I feel bad for somebody

964
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:13,960
who's listening to this episode when I

965
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:16,000
think about it because they may be

966
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:19,280
really eating a lot of it and then it's

967
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,960
about whoa what do I do do I wean myself

968
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:25,319
off how do I move this out of my life

969
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:27,960
it's really hard the problem with MSG is

970
00:46:25,319 --> 00:46:30,880
it goes to the brain it gets into the

971
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:32,640
nerves it gets on the neurons in the gal

972
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:36,440
cells it

973
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:39,440
crystallizes MSG deposits build up

974
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:41,680
around neurons creating these little

975
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:44,000
crystallizations that interfere with

976
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:47,440
electrical impulses in our brain

977
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:50,240
chemistry creating a brain response

978
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:52,079
that's highly addictive I talk more

979
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:55,319
about this in the brain saver books

980
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:59,040
coming out and then there's gut health

981
00:46:55,319 --> 00:47:01,760
intes tract Health glutamic acid from

982
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:05,000
nutritional yeast aggravates nerve

983
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:06,720
endings in the intestinal tract lining

984
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,359
if someone's got gas and bloating

985
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:12,839
Crohn's colitis or Celiac or some kind

986
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:15,079
of distension some kind of cramping

987
00:47:12,839 --> 00:47:17,880
maybe flatulence maybe gastroparesis

988
00:47:15,079 --> 00:47:20,640
maybe some type of intestinal tract

989
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:24,000
disorder nutritional yeast is the last

990
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:27,440
thing you want to eat it's an intestinal

991
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:30,280
irritant a colon irritant it's

992
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:32,800
problematic inside the intestinal tract

993
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:35,920
causes a lot of problems with the lining

994
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:38,079
a lot of food sensitivity doctors food

995
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,800
allergists they'll test you for a lot of

996
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:41,640
different allergies they'll have a big

997
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:44,160
old list of your food

998
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:47,240
sensitivities and most of the time if

999
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:50,119
not all the time nutritional yeast won't

1000
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:51,800
be on the list and you'll be free to eat

1001
00:47:50,119 --> 00:47:55,400
all the nutritional yeast You Ever

1002
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:58,880
Wanted by your doctor's orders Katie the

1003
00:47:55,400 --> 00:48:01,720
doctor will see you well Katie it looks

1004
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:04,400
like your food allergist has came in and

1005
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:07,960
it doesn't seem like you have a food

1006
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:07,960
allergy a food

1007
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:14,079
allergy a food allergy to nutritional

1008
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:19,240
yeast after

1009
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:23,079
all it saddens me so many good people

1010
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:27,160
doing good things for themselves wanting

1011
00:48:23,079 --> 00:48:30,200
the best out of life wanting to heal

1012
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:35,040
wanting to make sure that everything

1013
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:37,440
they do is right it matters to them life

1014
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:39,760
matters health is

1015
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:43,359
everything they care about their loved

1016
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:46,680
ones they care about their friends the

1017
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:49,079
people they know they want what's best

1018
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:54,400
for everybody around them and they want

1019
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:56,359
to learn and they want to grow but then

1020
00:48:54,400 --> 00:49:00,760
comes Darkness

1021
00:48:56,359 --> 00:49:04,599
you just can't see blinders on and we

1022
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:08,920
don't understand how capable Darkness

1023
00:49:04,599 --> 00:49:11,960
can be and we don't see behind the

1024
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:14,680
mirror as we're looking at ourselves

1025
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:17,599
that there are obstacles in the way of

1026
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:21,040
our healing that have taken us and our

1027
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:25,000
health but once we learn and find our

1028
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:27,880
way we strengthen and never let anything

1029
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:30,839
ever again again get in our way

1030
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:34,760
knowledge is power and power of the

1031
00:49:30,839 --> 00:49:38,680
light so bright it kills the yeast that

1032
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:41,799
grows as it fights and how do we trust

1033
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:45,240
to find our way there's so much out

1034
00:49:41,799 --> 00:49:48,440
there we don't know that contributes and

1035
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:50,880
it makes our body pay we want to feel

1036
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:54,520
better than less than we want to feel

1037
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:57,000
our best we don't want to be sad we

1038
00:49:54,520 --> 00:50:00,599
don't want to be left out we want to

1039
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:03,559
know all of the rest when we think about

1040
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:06,079
it we get tricked into putting things

1041
00:50:03,559 --> 00:50:09,680
into our mouth by telling us it's

1042
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:13,040
healthy and it will provide a way out

1043
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:16,400
but not all the things we eat are really

1044
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:20,000
good for us and not all foods are the

1045
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:22,720
same and are really safe for us when you

1046
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:27,440
have the truth in your hands you got the

1047
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:27,440
freedom to choose
