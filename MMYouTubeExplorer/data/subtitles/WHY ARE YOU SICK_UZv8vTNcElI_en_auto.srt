1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,279
right why does anybody get sick like why

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,440
should anybody get sick

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:10,320
shouldn't we

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:13,040
be born

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,040
we grow

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:20,160
we stay strong

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:23,519
and then we die in our sleep

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,119
99 years old to 110 years old or

9
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,199
whatever

10
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,560
shouldn't that be what should be right

11
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,199
but wait

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,800
it's not like that

13
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,440
it was

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,280
almost like that

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:41,760
almost

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,760
30 years ago now how's that possible

17
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,920

had people 98 105 109.

21
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,239

00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,239
operations heart surgeries were

24
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,399
antiquated

25
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,920

29
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:16,799

42
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:01,360
35 years old 35 years ago you wouldn't

43
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:04,000
find a 35 year old 35 years old 35 years

44
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,240
ago you wouldn't find a 25 year old you

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,679
didn't find a 20 year old that was

46
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,080
basically wasting away

47
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:15,040
it was rare they were there but it was

48
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,360
so rare it was sprinkled in different

49
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,760
parts of the country sprinkled around in

50
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,400
different parts of the states

51
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,760
but now that's changed

52
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:29,680
life expectancy has dropped

53
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:32,239
dropped tragically dropped

54
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,920

55
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,879

where you can get rid of a little bit of

116
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,280

simplistic level

188
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:14,160
you either have something toxic in you

189
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,360
or you have

190
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,840
something alive in you that shouldn't be

191
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,479
in you

192
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:25,120
you either have

193
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,560
something toxic in you right

194
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,000

so healthy for you by the way it's not

212
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,520
copper's highly toxic

213
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,080
and they're just they're just playing

214
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,759
with fire when they play with copper

215
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,120
touching it is really bad touching

216
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,120
copper is bad

217
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,479

so

221
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,280
we're either

222
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,280
saturated with some kind of toxin

223
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,280
whether it's metals whether it's

224
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,360
chemicals

225
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,840
right for old pharmaceuticals but we're

226
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,039
saturated with either that

227
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,440
or

228
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:34,240
we got the bugs we got some things

229
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:37,279
inside of us alive that's not supposed

230
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,719
to be there alive it's not supposed to

231
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:42,159
be there

232
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:46,160
but it's there and then

233
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:49,360
having both having both toxins

234
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,640
and the bugs combined is even harder on

235
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,360
people

236
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:56,560

peace through all this

246
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,720
what happens is people have two things

248
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,800

and it's releasing neurotoxins

266
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,720
and it gets into the inner ear the

267
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,800

312
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,560
lynette says my oldest daughter is 21

313
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:56,160
and having different issues has ruptured

314
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,519
ovarian cyst

315
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,880
kidney stone borderline anemia anxiety

316
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,360
so

317
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,040
if that was happening to

318
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,920
a family say a family member came to me

319
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,519
and said look this is what's going on

320
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,040
the anemia

321
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,240
is viral

322
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,519
that's what i would tell my family

323
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,600
member

324
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,200
the anemone the anemia is viral

325
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,519
epstein-barr causes anemia that's

326
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,880
mystery anemia

327
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,800
right

328
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,120
epstein-barr also

329
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,360
causes ovarian cysts

330
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,120
reproductive cysts

331
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,639
so it's another thing epstein-barr

332
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,440
causes

333
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:36,399
toxic heavy metals

334
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,399
cause anxiety

335
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:42,639
okay what's happening here is

336
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,360
published in the medical medium books

337
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:48,560
quite a long time ago now

338
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:51,120
uh kim d'andrea says you cured my son

339
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,600
from hypothyroidism on facebook

340
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,040
incredible incredible

341
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,639
medical medium information is so

342
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,399
advanced and so ahead of research in

343
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,839
science that research and science ends

344
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:03,600
up stealing it years later

345
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,120
but the jokes on research and science

346
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,839
we're stealing it because it's already

347
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,839
been published

348
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,519
and

349
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,000
it's already here

350
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,720
way before as proof

351
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,839
that another source up above

352
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,519
a source

353
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,639
had the answers before research in

354
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,680
science

355
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,360
so what they're doing they're taking

356
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,880
medical media information now about

357
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,560
epstein-barr and a lot of other things

358
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,079
is actually insane what they're doing

359
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,959
they used to say

360
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,800
this disease or condition cause unknown

361
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,320
and now they put viral infection now

362
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,920
they put epstein-barr now they put

363
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,279
shingles it's like okay but where's the

364
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,040
research paper and you look there is no

365
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:41,279
research paper and then you look there

366
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,360
really is no research that was done then

367
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,279
you realize it's just somebody

368
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,880
going like this

369
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,480
whoa

370
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,839
that guy sold millions and millions and

371
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,760
millions of books

372
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,360
talking about epstein-barr doctors are

373
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,120
using it all around the world we can't

374
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,880
let this guy get away with this we

375
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,199
better just take it and steal it doesn't

376
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:02,320
matter if we don't have research yet

377
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:04,880
yeah our a is now epstein-barr ms is now

378
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,760
epstein-barr with no real research

379
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,920
behind it interesting

380
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,600
so when it comes down to being sick

381
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,680
there's real reasons i've been saying

382
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,839
this for over 35 years

383
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,480
if you have

384
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:18,560
vertigo

385
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:22,240
it's the vagus nerves it's the vagus

386
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,760
nerves being inflamed by a critter you

387
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,600
got tinnitus

388
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,079
it's a critter getting into the

389
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,480
labyrinth of the inner ear

390
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,720
and inflaming that nerve channel causing

391
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,959
your tinnitus you're popping you're

392
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:38,320
fluttering you're washing

393
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:39,680
viral infection right

394
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,880
if you've got other conditions like

395
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,920
eczema

396
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:46,560
and psoriasis that's a combination of

397
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,399
having toxic heavy metals like copper

398
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,839
inside your liver

399
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,399
and then having

400
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:54,160
a little buggy right here that feeds off

401
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,560
of the copper because that's what

402
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,560
happens to little bugs inside of a speed

403
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:01,279
feeds off the copper releases a

404
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:04,880
dermatoxin and now you have your skin

405
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:06,720
problems your psoriasis and eczema

406
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,320
if this is really hard for someone to

407
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,839
understand because it could be hard for

408
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,399
somebody to understand when you think

409
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,920
about it right if it is you just gotta

410
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,000
break it down you gotta break break it

411
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,560
down it's the most simplest form

412
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,199
you got a critter in you

413
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,959
and you got some poisons and toxins of

414
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:26,160
some kind in you

415
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:28,959
you can name them all right

416
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:31,839
and one is bothering you

417
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,839
on its own

418
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,880
or

419
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:39,120
both of them are bothering you together

420
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:42,560
that is as simple as it gets and then

421
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:46,160
ready after that

422
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:50,560
our immune systems break down

423
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:53,440
we become deficient dehydrated

424
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,440
and toxic

425
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:58,000
and then we just start to fall apart as

426
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,399
the years go on

427
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
i can sum it up that easy

428
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,320
that fast

429
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,040
for anyone

430
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,959
and if i heard that and i was sick so if

431
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,560
i had something wrong and i was in bad

432
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,639
shape and i heard that be like what do i

433
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,480
need to do

434
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,639
it sounds to me like i have to get rid

435
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,720
of the critters

436
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,160
find out which ones

437
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,480
and then i got to figure out how to get

438
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,560
rid of the poisons and the toxins like

439
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,199
the metals or anything else

440
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:30,399
and then i'm home free

441
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,399
but how am i going to do that

442
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,160
answers are here

443
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:37,040
it's doable

444
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,399
people are doing it all around the world

445
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,240
they are

446
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,000
so let's go into a little bit

447
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,880
now now

448
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:49,120
if i was sick okay

449
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:51,360
i'd be drinking licorice tea if i had

450
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,800
symptoms

451
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,440
that were

452
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:58,000
looking like

453
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,440
they were because of epstein-barr or

454
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,279
shingles

455
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,480
and those symptoms are

456
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:06,480
fatigue conditions like lupus chronic

457
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,720
fatigue syndrome

458
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,199
brain fog right

459
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,039
autoimmune of any kind and so i'd be

460
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:17,280
like okay licorice tea

461
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:18,880
because that's an antiviral right there

462
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,319
even if you're doing little things like

463
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,079
this well i'm going to do my licorice

464
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:25,199
tea that's one thing right there so i'm

465
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:27,760
going to go into auto immune right now

466
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:30,079
and i'm going to look forward here

467
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,079
right

468
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,840
and

469
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,919
so let's go to autoimmune

470
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,160
so autoimmune diseases and disorders

471
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,160
right so if you get diagnosed with an

472
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,320
autoimmune disease and i'm going to read

473
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,559
real quick the autoimmune part right

474
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,320
if your individual autoimmune

475
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,720
issue isn't listed here because there's

476
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,240
so many there's hundreds right

477
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,559
if it's not listed here you still can

478
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,600
use this autoimmune section by the way

479
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:59,760
the true cause of autoimmune is unknown

480
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,320
to medical research and science health

481
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:05,280
problems that are labeled autoimmune are

482
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:07,440
in truth viral infections viruses that

483
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,960
cause autoimmune conditions can be one

484
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,080
or more

485
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,880
of the 60 varieties of epstein-barr

486
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,679
over 30 varieties of shingles

487
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,440
okay

488
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:23,039
many varieties of hhv-6 hhv-7

489
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:25,520
undiscovered hhv-10 through hhv-16

490
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:27,840
multiple varieties of herpes simplex

491
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:30,320
ones so the fever blister people got the

492
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,240
fever blister in their body their whole

493
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,240
life but then what happens is the fever

494
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,840
blister virus you guys

495
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:39,120
ends up

496
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:42,480
causing jaw pain teeth pain

497
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:44,960
strange headaches back to the neck right

498
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,640
trigeminal neuralgia other problems so

499
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,360
that's what happens with the herpes

500
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,280
simplex viruses herpes simplex one cold

501
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,480
store fever blister i just got a fever

502
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,080
blister

503
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,720
yeah don't worry don't worry yeah what

504
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:59,120
do you see on my lip don't worry

505
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,559
it's just a fever blister is what it is

506
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,080
and that's what people don't realize

507
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,679
it's like oh no it's no big deal

508
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,360
meanwhile you know it is a big deal

509
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,120
because in the end it can cause some

510
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,919
problems and it's important to kind of

511
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,039
like be like open to that it's like it's

512
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:13,280
like

513
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:15,520
yeah i know i have a fever blister don't

514
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,679
worry about it

515
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,360
you want to share my glass i'll share my

516
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,039
glass with you right

517
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,480
it's like yeah no can i borrow that i'll

518
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,080
give you your glass back can i try that

519
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,160
drink don't worry about this fever

520
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,320
blister right now yeah don't worry the

521
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,799
fever blisters are highly contagious

522
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,559
right highly contagious

523
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,720
and

524
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,400
and they cause so many troubles but

525
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,840
people don't know they cause any trouble

526
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,840
so it's like okay no don't worry

527
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,799
we have

528
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,880
doctor says my child's fine my child has

529
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,799
a fever blister

530
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,919
obviously came from me the parent and

531
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,360
the parents

532
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,960
but you know no one talks about it the

533
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,200
doctor says it's perfectly fine it goes

534
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,799
away meanwhile it means early trigeminal

535
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,880
neuralgia unless you do something about

536
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,640
it it means early migraines it means

537
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,799
early symptoms it means all kinds of

538
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,679
issues if you don't do something about

539
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,240
it

540
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:06,240
so in the autoimmune section right here

541
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,799
okay

542
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,440
i'm reading this the cause of autoimmune

543
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:12,880
disorders and diseases

544
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,120
right

545
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:18,240
are not the body's immune system

546
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,520
attacking its own organs and glands

547
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,880
medical research and science you know

548
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,720
what they did recently they took

549
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,159
epstein-barr information from medical

550
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,520
medium books

551
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,320
word for word plagiarizing

552
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,000
and

553
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,760
but they still think the body's

554
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,320
attacking itself too because they can't

555
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:36,320
let that old theory go they're bringing

556
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:39,120
in something fresh

557
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:41,039
something that's solid and works like mm

558
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,240
info about epstein-barr causing all

559
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,520
these symptoms and conditions and then

560
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,120
they mix it

561
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,919
they just can't help themselves they

562
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,520
mismix it with the ah the body attacks

563
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:51,280
itself with it

564
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,559
it's ridiculous really they can't keep

565
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,400
it straight there's no consistency

566
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,159
there's no check and balance

567
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,440
they constantly contradict itself you

568
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,360
notice how that's the world right now

569
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,440
it's nothing but contradictions 24 7.

570
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:04,000
there's no check and balance

571
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,440
right medical medium science

572
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,280
is what they're using so they're using

573
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,679
medical medium science

574
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,039
so it's a theory that the body attacks

575
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,799
itself right and that's what the

576
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:15,120
industry always uses started from the

577
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:17,280
1950s

578
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,120
the truth is though

579
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,280
people are dealing with viruses

580
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,360
responsible for these illnesses that are

581
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,520
they're living with viral activity in a

582
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,799
combination with toxic metals and other

583
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,440
chemicals

584
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:31,919
these viruses feed on foods too that i

585
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:36,400
always talk about

586
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:39,120
if you want to weigh out if you want out

587
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,799
do you want out yeah you want out no one

588
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,559
wants to be sick you guys don't want to

589
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:45,200
be sick i don't know anybody that wants

590
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:46,640
to be sick

591
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,000
i definitely don't know anybody that

592
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,039
wants to be sick

593
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,120
right

594
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,799
but there's a way out

595
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,320
there really is

596
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,480
it's about learning about whoa wait a

597
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:59,120
minute i can go after the bugs inside of

598
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,280
me i can actually get the toxins out i

599
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:04,720
could do something about it

600
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:06,880
powerful that's powerful

601
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,880
so

602
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,960

603
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:14,320

time was since i ate a bowl i ate a

638
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,400

00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,279
don't talk about these guys that much

660
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:11,440
even though i do when i can

661
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,440
so

662
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,559
um rosangela says the amount of times i

663
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,480
heard that my body was attacking myself

664
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:21,679
had me thinking something was wrong with

665
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,440
me for years

666
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,880
that's the way the system is built up

667
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,840
it's on youtube thank you for being here

668
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,760
rosa

669
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,760
that's the way the system's built it's

670
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,840
built to convince the person their

671
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,679
bodies are faulty attacking themselves

672
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,919
their bodies are no good

673
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,840
and their body wants you dead because

674
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:40,080
your body is attacking itself so that

675
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,000
means your body wants you gone right if

676
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,760
it's attacking you and making you sick

677
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,760
to the point where you can't live life

678
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,600
anymore then yeah maybe my body turned

679
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,200
against me but that's not what happens

680
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,320
has nothing to do with your body doing

681
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,600
that

682
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,960
it's about these little critters that

683
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,880
everybody has inside of them and when

684
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,480
you have autoimmune which everybody's

685
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,640
getting a diagnosis of autonomy do you

686
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,640
think that's normal

687
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,960
because is that a normal great thing

688
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:06,400
every single human being on this planet

689
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:08,799
will get an autoimmune diagnosis

690
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:12,159
every single one of them in the coming

691
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:12,159
next 10 15 years

692
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:16,799
maybe young people not as much but but

693
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,039
most of them will still get an

694
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:20,080
autoimmune diagnosis

695
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:22,240
but

696
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,919
everybody will have that label

697
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,960
eventually have it if they get a little

698
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:27,520

the library

and just take it out of the library

809
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,640
that's all i care about if i know you're

810
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:09,279
sitting at home and you're looking into

811
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:11,760
this and you're like what

812
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:13,360
i i can actually get better

813
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,200
there's answers in here

814
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,840
right

815
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:20,399
so yeah important to know

816
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,840
so let's talk about just a couple little

817
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:23,120
the little nitty gritty i've talked

818
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,559
about it before i'm going to talk about

819
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,760
it again

820
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:29,200
you have to be careful when you're

821
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:32,799
getting your blood tests that's critical

822
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:35,360
people don't stand a chance

823
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:36,640
they don't stand a chance unless they

824
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,679
learn

825
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:42,320
to ask for half files from your doctor

826
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:44,320
or quarter vials from your doctor if the

827
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,440
phlebotomist says

828
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,960
no

829
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,039
we can't do it

830
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,039
call your doctor and you tell them

831
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:53,440
you're only going to give half files

832
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:55,600
or quarter vials

833
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,640
that's what you do

834
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,760
and then the doctor will tell the

835
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:01,600
phlebotomist just take the blood

836
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,279
and then that blood will do the same

837
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,480
thing any other blood will do because

838
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:06,399
they only need

839
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,840
a quarter or half file they need way

840
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:10,320
less than that i talk about that all

841
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,520
these years right

842
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,880
one of the ways they're getting

843
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,559
everybody right now and if i don't

844
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,080
explain this to you guys once in a while

845
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:18,559
you're just gonna fall into the traps

846
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:21,039
there's a lot of new people here too

847
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:22,720
they'll get you on the blood tests

848
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:25,360
they'll take the vials from you and

849
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:28,320
you'll lose your white count while

850
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,600
your white count is trying to stop this

851
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,080
right here

852
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:34,559
so inside your body there's a war all

853
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,240
the time you're sick you got the brain

854
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:38,240
 you don't feel good you got

855
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,159
symptoms you got conditions

856
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,000
you're not well you got anxiety you got

857
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,080
severe depression you got body pain

858
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,440
you've got fatigue you've got all these

859
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,880
different conditions you've got skin

860
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,600
rashes you've got hives and what's

861
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:52,799
happening is your white blood cells are

862
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:56,080
trying to control and gobble down and

863
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:56,080
eat the bugs

864
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:00,480
and then you're going to your doctor

865
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,080
because you feel so darn sick and your

866
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,159
butt doctors can be like i need to look

867
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:06,559
at all your profiles

868
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:08,640
let's get all the profiles here

869
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:10,320
i want to look at metabolic i want to

870
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,080
look at everything

871
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,720
and then you get i want a thyroid panel

872
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:16,399
metabolic panel i want a nutrition panel

873
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,120
i want to whatever and that's what they

874
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:19,519
do

875
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:22,720
and then what happens is your white

876
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:25,679
blood cells are removed

877
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:28,080
with every blood test with every vial

878
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:30,399
but before they can restore which can

879
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,440
take weeks and even months for many

880
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:32,880
people because you already have an

881
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,200
immune system problem because that's why

882
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:38,080
you're at the doctor's office the bugs

883
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:40,320
are still in the organs without your

884
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,960
immune system in the blood anymore to

885
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:44,880
keep it under control and you get sicker

886
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,559
this is why people have lost their lives

887
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,559
with neurological lyme multiple

888
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:50,640
sclerosis and cancer in almost every

889
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:53,360
other condition because they take and

890
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,960
the more you get sick and complain the

891
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,480
more blood they take and then the

892
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,720
specialist takes and then the next

893
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,240
specialist takes no one cares and then

894
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,320
you're sick in the hospital and they

895
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,320
take it every day

896
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,200
until you lose your life

897
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,919
or

898
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:10,880
somehow end up home without a blood test

899
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:13,600
long enough to regain your life back to

900
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:17,760
sustain yourself enough before they try

901
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,760
to draw your blood again and kill you

902
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:23,200
this is not radical thinking

903
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,039
i talk to doctors about this all the

904
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,480
time i have doctors now reaching out to

905
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:28,480
me saying that's the best thing they've

906
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,080
ever heard their patients are rebounding

907
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,760
quicker their patients are healing

908
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:34,240
they're ordering quarter miles and half

909
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,840
vials it's changing medicine right now

910
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,720
but if you're not on board you're just

911
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:41,200
gonna get ripped off

912
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,480
yeah ripped off

913
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,279
the one thing

914
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:47,840
about the medical medium books

915
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:49,679
is they teach you about this blood draw

916
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:52,240
too that's one thing right there there's

917
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,519
so many cool things right

918
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,120
so

919
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:57,840
there's a section in here there's a

920
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:59,039
section in here about like where like

921
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,919
that i'm going to show you in a minute

922
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:03,760
too

923
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:05,279
when it comes down to lyme disease right

924
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,799
it comes down to lyme disease and i have

925
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:10,559
a lime section in all my books there's a

926
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:13,679
lime section in this book right here

927
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:16,000
you can never heal from lyme disease

928
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:18,159
unless you learn

929
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,480
what you're after you got to go after

930
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:22,480
the bugs and the right kind

931
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:25,919
you have to go after the toxins and then

932
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:28,480
you have to look out for the blood draws

933
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:30,240
the blood frogs are a big part you know

934
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,519
you know who heals with lyme disease

935
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,720
when they start feeling a little better

936
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:34,799
when they do the right things like the

937
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,399
medical medium information and then

938
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:37,600
they're they're going to the doctors a

939
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:39,519
lot less

940
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,600
and they're getting less blood drawn and

941
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:43,679
now they're rocking now they're getting

942
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:46,240
their lives back it's incredible it's

943
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,240
incredible

944
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,600
right

945
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,200
so i got this little part here in this

946
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,640
medical medium book one all the medical

947
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,159
medium books are so loaded with

948
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,960
information

949
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,200
right

950
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:59,200
when a larger number of blood vials are

951
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,919
drawn it could be stressful on the

952
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:04,399
immune system

953
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:06,960
four full vials six full vials 20 full

954
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:07,919
vials 34 miles right

955
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,760
okay

956
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:12,399
because the very immune defenses that

957
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:14,480
are keeping the viruses behind lyme

958
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:16,159
symptoms and any other symptom or

959
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,079
autoimmune disease or anything else

960
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:20,240
you're up against are being drawn out of

961
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:22,159
the body when the blood is being drawn

962
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:25,119
so your very defenses like your immune

963
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:27,280
systems being sucked up and drawn up

964
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:29,359
if you don't know how to ask for quarter

965
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:32,320
vials and be cautious and be cautious on

966
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:33,919
how much blood is being taken

967
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,000
blood draws tend to take away a

968
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:38,159
substantial portion of a person's immune

969
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,679
system that day and it sometimes takes

970
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,599
weeks to months to rebuild those

971
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:43,119
portions of the immune system

972
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:44,960
fancy that

973
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:46,639
within those weeks

974
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,200
that the full power of your immune

975
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:51,440
system is not present anymore

976
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,800
in your blood monitoring bugs and

977
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,720
viruses

978
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,879
there's a window of strength all the

979
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:58,320
bugs get in that moment they rise up and

980
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:00,400
now you're sicker and you're going to

981
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,520
the doctor one more time and when you go

982
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,359
to the doctor one more time you're

983
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,520
getting blood drawn again darcey lee

so when i talk about why are we sick i'm

1038
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,960
giving you guys the foundational tools

1039
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,440
right

1040
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,599
you got some kind of critter in you

1041
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:14,800
right we got a critter

1042
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:18,880
right i gave you that one we got toxins

1043
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:21,119
we got poisons right it's another one

1044
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,760
and then

1045
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:26,880
we get broken down

1046
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:29,359
too many blood draws

1047
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:33,119
too much caffeine

1048
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:35,680
chocolate coffee green tea matcha tea

1049
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:37,200
too much caffeine foods that feed the

1050
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,800
bugs

1051
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,480
right

1052
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:43,280
deborah says i'm not getting any

1053
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:45,599
notifications for you how do i get them

1054
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,040
again i keep missing you deborah

1055
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,720
that's by design

1056
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,720
not for me

1057
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:53,359
keeping you from seeing these but it's

1058
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,359
by design

1059
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,079
and that's been happening since 2018

1060
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,960
so

1061
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:03,520
try turning on your note face

1062
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:07,359
notifications again and try to give it a

1063
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,359
you know give it a shot try to reset it

1064
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,040
so

1065
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:15,680
jen's gen z says

1066
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:17,440
i've been advised to donate more blood

1067
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:21,599
because my blood is poisoned with carbon

1068
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,599
monoxide so it's not good blood to keep

1069
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,560
look

1070
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,920
i want you to listen to your doctor

1071
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,680
because that's what you should do you if

1072
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,480
you're advised by your your

1073
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,720
your

1074
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:33,839
health care provider to do something you

1075
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:35,359
do it if that was me

1076
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:37,200
i wouldn't be doing that

1077
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:39,839
if that was me but that's just this is

1078
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,040
just my life i could i could say that

1079
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:42,800
okay

1080
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:46,800
and because i would ask myself like why

1081
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:48,880
would that help someone else then so

1082
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,560
am i going to give i would say to that

1083
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,680
doctor

1084
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,680
i would say to that doctor

1085
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,320
if you want me to donate my blood

1086
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:01,040
because it's poison with carbon carbon

1087
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,800
monoxide

1088
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:04,320
isn't that what if there's a child that

1089
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,520
needs my blood

1090
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,599
and they're going to do they're going to

1091
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,880
do a blood transfusion in a child and

1092
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:11,280
they're going to poison that child with

1093
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:15,160
carbon monoxide

1094
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,160
that's what i would ask my doctor

1095
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:18,400
and

1096
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:19,760
that's really

1097
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,240
disturbing

1098
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,920
i'm going to ask dr nesbitt if he'll

1099
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:26,480
come out right now because i want to see

1100
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:29,520
what dr nesbitt has to say

1101
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:31,200
because dr nesbitt is a better doctor

1122
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:08,960
he's on the medical board and he's a

1123
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,359
surgeon

1124
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,880
what do you think about that that

1125
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:13,920
doctor hasn't stopped sticking that in

1126
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,280
my face

1127
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,240
um

1128
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,480
he says

1129
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,440
he wouldn't donate the blood

1130
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,319
what

1131
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:24,560
he said that doctor is definitely

1132
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:26,720
a quack what

1133
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,880
he says the doctor's a quack

1134
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,880
and there's a lot of bad doctors out

1135
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,720
there really what why do you say that

1136
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,400
home doctors are good

1137
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,800
he says it's the third

1138
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:39,680
reason why people die in this country

1139
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:41,680
alone is from malpractice

1140
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:44,079
because doctors

1141
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:47,760
are like

1142
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:50,720
no that's not right no doctors

1143
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:52,079
are they're not no what they haven't no

1144
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,760
they have an what are you trying

1145
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:55,280
to say what

1146
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:58,079
dr nesbitt

1147
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:00,720
doesn't even know what he's saying

1148
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:02,960
he's saying that

1149
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,760
doctors are like everybody has

1150
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,920
one

1151
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:08,640
that doesn't even make any sense anyway

1152
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:10,319
dr nesbit has to go back into surgery

1153
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:12,240
he's taking this with him he's going to

1154
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:13,839
going to inject this vial of blood that

1155
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,359
has carbon monoxide and some other

1156
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:16,880
dangerous things in it

1157
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:18,800
he's going to inject this into his

1158
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,800
patient he thinks he thinks that was

1159
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,680
wise advice from the other doctor to

1160
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,000
just

1161
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:25,920
put blood that's not good in someone

1162
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,920
else and put it in someone else is that

1163
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,280
release no he's only kidding he would
