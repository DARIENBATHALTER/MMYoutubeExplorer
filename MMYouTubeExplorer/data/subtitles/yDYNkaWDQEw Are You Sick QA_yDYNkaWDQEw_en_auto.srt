1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,020

00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:21,960
tightness of the chest you're at the

9
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,199
pulmonologist now you're at a specialist

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:29,400
now you have a neurologist anxiety

11
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:32,040

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,620

you won't hear that out there

20
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,739
I think it's suppressed I think the

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,180
information is kept down

22
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:55,800
I don't think

23
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,420
I don't think the industry the health

24
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,280
industry the medical industry wants

25
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:03,120

so many people

121
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,300
have problems

122
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:44,820
Beyond just say a neurological tingle or

123
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,979
numbness or an ache or a pain or jaw

124
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:49,100
pain or dizziness or vertigo or ear

125
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:52,500
popping or whatever so many people have

126
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:54,120
addiction issues that they just can't

127
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,979
get past

128
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,900
whether it's an addiction to caffeine

129
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:58,919
addiction to coffee addiction to

130
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,800
chocolate

131
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:02,880
addiction to food because you're under

132
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,699
stress

133
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:08,160
so so many people are are addicted to

134
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:10,440
flavor they're addicted to MSG they're

135
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,960
addicted to that

136
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:15,479
that excitability they get from food

137
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,000
that adrenaline surge

138
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:21,000
and then there's so many people that

139
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,680
also have skin problems like eczema and

140
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,680
psoriasis

141
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:28,139
psoriatic arthritis kind of combination

142
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,680
of both and then you get people who have

143
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:34,800
rosacea dermatitis and all kinds of

144
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,240
other skin issues too so

145
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,400
I'm looking right here and I'm looking

146
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,560
through symptoms conditions in the brain

147
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,900
saver book and I'll just run a few right

148
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,300
here by you this is interesting like I'm

149
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:47,400
just cutting through some of these

150
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,800
so anemia is in here how many people are

151
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:53,580
anemic so I just want to hit that a

152
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:55,380
little bit so anemia is mysterious

153
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:59,639
that's mysterious to the medical

154
00:05:55,380 --> 00:06:03,600
industry being anemic right so one thing

155
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:06,000
people don't realize is that low iron

156
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,639
in the blood

157
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,199
a big part of that is low-grade viral

158
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,560
infection

159
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:15,080
some people have epstein-bars and other

160
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,960
viruses

161
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:20,280
Epstein-Barr tends to feed on iron so in

162
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,319
a lot of people they're dealing with

163
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:25,560
this anemia because they're dealing with

164
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,300
a chronic low-grade viral infection

165
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,280
and that's something that so many people

166
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:31,139
struggle with that they'll never get an

167
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,639
answer to but they'll never get that

168
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:34,199
answer ever

169
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,020
and they'll just be like dealing with

170
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:39,600
their anemia not know how to fix it not

171
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:41,580
know how to heal it

172
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,199
so I'm looking through here too for all

173
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:45,060
kinds of there's Alzheimer's I can see

174
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,440
that there's

175
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:50,060
um

176
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:52,560
there's anxiety there's anxiousness

177
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:55,500
arrhythmias a lot of people have heart

178
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,560
palpitations and heart issues that are

179
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:00,419
not physical in the sense where the

180
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,979
heart has a problem how many of you guys

181
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:03,600
have dealt with that like heart

182
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:06,360
palpitations right you feel like you

183
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,919

184
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,919

185
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:14,580

ectopic heartbeat heart palp so many

187
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:20,639
people are up against that all the time

188
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:22,740
this question what's your take on Lupus

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,020
and multiple sclerosis so if you look in

190
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:27,360
medical medium book one you can even

191
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:29,460
look at brain saver on that somebody's

192
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:33,360
asking about lupus

193
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:35,099
so I have Lupus in here and it talks um

194
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,419
it talks about that in here too and

195
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:38,759
multiple sclerosis there's a whole

196
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:41,460
section here in multiple sclerosis

197
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:42,840
that's a very important topic so what is

198
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:45,240
my take on it

199
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:48,060
my take is having an answer for multiple

200
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,099
sclerosis that's my take it's something

201
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:52,520
that you can't get anywhere else in the

202
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:56,340
industry and that's Epstein-Barr

203
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:58,020
Epstein-Barr is the cause of multiple

204
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,280
sclerosis now you might be somebody

205
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,139
though

206
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,340
and have seen this there's other people

207
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:04,919
out there that have had this where

208
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:06,060
they're misdiagnosed with multiple

209
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:08,580
sclerosis

210
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:11,340
and they have a flurry of other

211
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:13,860
neurological symptoms weakness in the

212
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:15,780
limbs weakness in the legs weakness in

213
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:18,360
the arms

214
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:21,960
all kinds of vibrations and spasms in

215
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,879
the arms ticks and they may get a

216
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:26,460
multiple sclerosis diagnosis but really

217
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:28,319
there's something else going on

218
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,460
but then there's multiple sclerosis

219
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,500
where

220
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:35,099
the nerve sheath

221
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:38,700
is physically damaged and they can see

222
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:40,440
that so there's that option to is that

223
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:42,919
there's that too that diagnosis that

224
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:46,440
happens for people but in these books

225
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:47,700
and in the medical medium new addition

226
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,800
right here

227
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,660
I talk about multiple sclerosis and the

228
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:54,420
details of it and then I talk about

229
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:56,580
lesions in brain saver

230
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:58,980
which are really important too in brain

231
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:01,200
saver protocols a lot of people have

232
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:03,240
lesions they get diagnosed with multiple

233
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,220
sclerosis but the lesion isn't causing

234
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,839
the problem

235
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,339
so the lesion

236
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,820
in the brain

237
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:15,240
on the nerve sheath on the spine is not

238
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:16,920
why they're actually having problems

239
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,300
they could be having problems for other

240
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,940
reasons

241
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:23,519
and so I go into detail on all kinds of

242
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:26,399
black spots white spots calcifications

243
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,920
in the brain all kinds of different Scar

244
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,720
Tissue problems people have in their

245
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:33,480
brain and brain tissue

246
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,399
I talk about stains in the brain

247
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,000
causing

248
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:38,040
um

249
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,839
causing dark doctors to actually

250
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,959
misdiagnose

251
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,240
multiple sclerosis or issues regarding

252
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,760
that but when it comes down to Multiple

253
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:51,060
Sclerosis if I was diagnosed with Ms I

254
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,800
would be taking it on like a virus

255
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:55,740
causing it

256
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,720
and I'd be concerned about Metals too so

257
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:00,600
when someone has

258
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:03,540
a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis

259
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:07,080
that's usually a combination of viruses

260
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:09,660
like Epstein-Barr and toxic heavy metals

261
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:11,339
and I would take those two wands

262
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,200
do what's right for you and what your

263
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:16,740
doctor tells you but that's what I would

264
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,899
do I'd go into the medical meeting books

265
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:20,100
learn about a multiple sclerosis

266
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:22,500
protocol

267
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:25,560
so let's see if we can find one these

268
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:27,959
books are just like vast textbooks of

269
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,880
information so let me see I'll go into

270
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:31,980
the protocols book right here

271
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:34,459
and actually you can go in here too and

272
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,459
find them

273
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:40,920
so there's a couple of places you can go

274
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,600
for multiple sclerosis you can go right

275
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,660
in here

276
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,660
things

277
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:53,820
so somebody said the who or linking MS2

278
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:56,459
I saw that okay down here I measure

279
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:58,860
hi have MS and have been using medical

280
00:10:56,459 --> 00:11:01,800
medium information to heal just came off

281
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:03,959
my Ms medication and was able to heal

282
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,820
one of my brain lesions that caused

283
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:07,019
double vision that's wild blueberry

284
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:09,180
dreams

285
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:10,980
on IG

286
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:12,240
a lot of people first of all I'm proud

287
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:14,959
of you incredible you're using medical

288
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,800
meme information to heal your MS

289
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,480
lots of people have healed their

290
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,339
multiple multiple sclerosis different

291
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,500
lesions with with the medical medium

292
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:24,300
information it's all about chronic

293
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,880
illness it's all about

294
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:29,820
these very things multiple sclerosis on

295
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,860
page 68

296
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:35,220
right here

297
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:39,360
so I'm in medical medium book one

298
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:41,839
the new edition I'm on page 68 multiple

299
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,839
sclerosis

300
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,380
it is so packed with information this

301
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:48,959
chapter

302
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:50,760
it has so many details on how it even

303
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,899
occurs what it really is like for

304
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,899
instance I'm reading right here what

305
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:56,760
multiple sclerosis really is

306
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:58,440
medical communities believe multiple

307
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,120
sclerosis is an autoimmune disease

308
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,339
resulting from your immune system

309
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:05,339
somehow confusing areas of your nerve

310
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:08,399
sheath with Invaders and attacking them

311
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:09,959
huge mistake by the medical industry

312
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,700
sorry to say

313
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:14,399
but it's a mistake

314
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:16,680
it's a medical communities believe it's

315
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:20,459
your immune system being confused and

316
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:22,500
attacking your nerve sheath

317
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:24,240
as I say in other chapters this is a

318
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,519
philosophy that will hold back the truth

319
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,260
in medical research for decades the

320
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:31,200
human body does not attack itself

321
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:32,820
pathogens are to blame so it goes on to

322
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,320
how the Epstein bar creates multiple

323
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,060
sclerosis

324
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,160
and then there's sections in here like

325
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:41,820
healing from multiple sclerosis

326
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:44,339
it's packed so I'll read you a protocol

327
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:47,459
really quick a little bit of it Mitchie

328
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:50,279
says does it have epilepsy yes the Brain

329
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:53,160
book does

330
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:57,560
so in the brain books

331
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:57,560
I talk about epilepsy is here seizures

332
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:01,680
so if I had multiple sclerosis I would

333
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:04,399
take this book

334
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,399
right here

335
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:10,560
and I would look at the protocol and the

336
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:13,279
first thing in the protocol if you only

337
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,279
did this

338
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,800
the first thing in the protocol is

339
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,899
celery juice

340
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,940
if you're somebody and you're like well

341
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:22,260
I don't know if I have multiple

342
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:24,420
sclerosis but I have a lot of symptoms

343
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:26,579
like this said hey you can always go

344
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:28,800
this direction in this path but you also

345
00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:31,139
can find your symptoms in the Brain book

346
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,000
specifically

347
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:36,180
so it starts out with fresh celery juice

348
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:39,300
work up to 32 ounces daily then work up

349
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:42,660
to 64 ounces if possible

350
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:45,779
so if someone has serious

351
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:48,180
a serious diagnosis and struggles with

352
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:50,579
multiple sclerosis

353
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:53,339
that's what it says here now look what

354
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:55,560
it says it says work up to

355
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:57,120
work up to 32 ounces that means you

356
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,880
could start at four ounces

357
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,240
inserted six or eight ounces

358
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:05,459
and that's what it says right there

359
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:08,339
and then it goes through supplements it

360
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:09,480
goes through dosages right here you'll

361
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:11,220
see there's a bunch of different

362
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:14,579
supplements in here and you could take

363
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:16,800
it where when you read the supplement

364
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:18,420
chapter you can see where you can start

365
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,760
slow you can start with one or two

366
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:24,360
supplements now I know there's a lot

367
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:25,560
of talk out there about take supplements

368
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,139
or not you don't need to take

369
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:31,260
supplements to heal stay away from

370
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:32,940
supplements you'll hear out there

371
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:34,680
but there's a lot of confusion like

372
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:36,540
which supplements are you talking about

373
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:39,240
because you're talking about swallowing

374
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:41,040
charcoal stay away from it if you're

375
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,800
talking about

376
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,779
you know drinking and swallowing Pearl

377
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,519
powder and Soviet sodium bicarbonate

378
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:48,779
yeah you shouldn't be doing it if you

379
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,519
talk about supplements that are filled

380
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:53,160
with natural flavors and citric acid and

381
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:54,420
all kinds of toxic ingredients sure you

382
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,600
don't want to be using that you should

383
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:59,639
stay away from it but

384
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:02,579
supplements are critical

385
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:06,000
for people who need to customize and go

386
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:07,320
further with their healing process

387
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,120
this person

388
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,040
is dealing with a host of problems so if

389
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,720
somebody gets a diagnosis of multiple

390
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,820
sclerosis or any kind of neurological

391
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,620
problem they're also probably dealing

392
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:18,420
with stress

393
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,800
Financial issues all kinds of different

394
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:23,760
issues

395
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:26,279
maybe even emotional mental struggles

396
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:29,699
all of the above

397
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:32,579
and so it is critical to

398
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:34,440
Venture into protocols if you need that

399
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:36,120
now I tell people they can use the

400
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:38,399
medical medium books and they can just

401
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,620
focus on like the mono

402
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,360
right the mono diet they can focus on

403
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,740
the monoclans they can focus on the

404
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,500
morning cleanse

405
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:49,199
they can focus on the 369 they can focus

406
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:52,019
on the 20-day cleanse whatever it is

407
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:54,480
they can start there or keep that and

408
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:57,779
then incorporate supplementation too

409
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,699
but I've seen live saved when using

410
00:15:57,779 --> 00:16:01,260
supplementation

411
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:04,260
properly

412
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:08,399
in protocols that actually work I've

413
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:10,019
seen lives get saved problem is in the

414
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:13,079
industry out there's a lot of

415
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:16,019
supplements being sold

416
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:19,380
for a lot of stupid reasons

417
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:22,139
and so it's a dog eat dog world

418
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:23,459
there's a battle and a war out there for

419
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:25,079
everybody

420
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:26,339
and their grandfather to sell a

421
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:29,519
supplement

422
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:32,279
and what's lost is why are people really

423
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,060
sick really what protocol do they really

424
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:34,980
need

425
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:38,120
those are the things that matter just

426
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:38,120
having those details

427
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:44,459
um a couple different questions here too

428
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:47,459
someone said

429
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:49,800
yes please talk more about autism when

430
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:51,600
kids it's an epidemic and it's only

431
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,040
getting worse so medical meme

432
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,079
information

433
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,240
many years ago

434
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:58,560
broke the news about toxic heavy metals

435
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,560
in Mercury

436
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,779
in book one and long before that so I'm

437
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,220
in medical medium book one revised

438
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:08,280
Edition right here

439
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:10,500
New Edition and I have autism in this

440
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:12,480
book a whole chapter on it so let's

441
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,819
let's just go into that for a second

442
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,620
guys if you guys have time to sit here

443
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:18,179
with me I want to talk about some

444
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:20,459
different conditions I want to look at

445
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:21,720
some of your questions I want to be

446
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:24,299
helpful

447
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:26,220
I know I didn't finish about multiple

448
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:28,260
sclerosis but there's so much to cover

449
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:29,520
here and the informations here and I'm

450
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:31,020
hoping that I'm still getting

451
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,580
information that you can really learn

452
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:35,240
from and glean from

453
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,240
so let's

454
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:39,720
find

455
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:41,640
what's the best cleanse to do for Ms let

456
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,059
me answer that in a second and I'm also

457
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,059
going to find

458
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:51,620
I find the autism section in here

459
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:57,740
what I love about these books

460
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,900
is they're so packed with information

461
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,700
I see so many interesting things to talk

462
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:17,160
about I'm actually like

463
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:19,500
my mind is exploding right now is what's

464
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:22,860
happening

465
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:25,140
all right so ADHD

466
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:27,120
and autism

467
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,320
so you'll see right here down the corner

468
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,799
I want to read one little thing really

469
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:35,039
quick what causes ADHD and autism

470
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:36,840
a popular misconception is that ADHD and

471
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,220
autism are the result of a poor

472
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:41,280
intestinal environment so you're going

473
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:43,440
to hear that so if you have a child and

474
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:46,320
you're going to seek help they're just

475
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,900
going to be all about gut health

476
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:51,860
I'm not saying that can't be helpful or

477
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:54,780
not no judgment on any of it

478
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:56,880
but some current thinking goes that in

479
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:58,620
overproduction of candida yeast and mold

480
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,840
and non-beneficial bacteria are to

481
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:03,539
filling for children it's hyperactive in

482
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,860
attentive impulsive or anti-social

483
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:07,320
Behavior

484
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:09,059
and then improving intestinal Flora will

485
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,860
improve children's brain health and

486
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:12,840
alleviate their symptoms so every mom

487
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:14,700
goes down this course eventually if they

488
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:17,160
leave the conventional wisdom every mom

489
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:21,059
will get child with autism end up try

490
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:23,340
and ends up traveling down that course

491
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:27,059
this theory is a distraction from what's

492
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:29,220
really in play that's a bold statement

493
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:32,000
by SOC in this book right here I'm

494
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:32,000
talking about autism

495
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:36,660
anybody can benefit from cleaning up

496
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:39,240
their gut health even if they're unaware

497
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:42,360
how or why

498
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:44,100
in the case of ADHD and autism trying to

499
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,559
improve the intestinal tract environment

500
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:50,460
with probiotics and probiotic rich foods

501
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:53,840
is a good intention that's peripheral

502
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,840
you guys hear that that's peripheral

503
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,340
it it doesn't address the true

504
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:03,000
underlying cause of ADHD and autism

505
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:07,500
toxic heavy metals

506
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:11,640
the true underlying Beast of autism and

507
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:13,380
ADHD toxic heavy metals if you say oh

508
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,000
I've heard that already

509
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,260
you're welcome

510
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,580
I've heard that already you're not

511
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:19,980
telling me something new medical medium

512
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:21,720
why am I watching you you're welcome

513
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:25,500
you're welcome

514
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:28,320
Decades of my work you're welcome

515
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:31,380
specifically ADHD and autism are born

516
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:33,539
from primarily Mercury plus aluminum

517
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:35,820
that settles in the brain's midline

518
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:38,880
cerebral canal

519
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:40,919
which divides the left hemisphere

520
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,780
than the right hemisphere the Mercury

521
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:44,580
and aluminum can also be in other areas

522
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:46,740
of the brain sprinkle the bowel in

523
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:50,220
smaller deposits some even inside the

524
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:52,080
emotional center of the brain

525
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:53,940
it might occur to you that it's hard to

526
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,100
build up significant exposure to toxic

527
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:57,480
heavy metals in just a few years of a

528
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:00,179
young life

529
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:02,700
how did my child get filled up with all

530
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:06,179
these toxic heavy metals

531
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:09,000
how did it happen however

532
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:11,100
Mercury is a neurotoxin that slips under

533
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,440
doctors noses

534
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:15,660
does it ever most doctors are oblivious

535
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,000
to which Medical Treatments they offer

536
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:19,799
that contain mercury and if they are

537
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,720
aware of it they're either in denial

538
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:23,400
afraid to break traditional protocol or

539
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,840
they believe in the treatment and that

540
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,400
belief overrides their common sense

541
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:29,280
about the nature of the toxic heavy

542
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,679
metals medical communities are due for a

543
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,539
massive wake-up call about obvious

544
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,159
Mercury contamination and so what you'll

545
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:36,600
see now is functional medicine doctors

546
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:38,340
and different doctors now are testing

547
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:41,159
for Metals all the time it's like the

548
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:42,840
routine thing going on so a lot of years

549
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:44,280
of medical medium work and Publishing

550
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:48,020
books and getting it out there but it's

551
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:48,020
now about toxic heavy metals

552
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:55,020
Mercury is a great instigator of ADHD

553
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:57,539
and autism in children in the 21st

554
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:59,880
century Mercury is also responsible for

555
00:21:57,539 --> 00:22:01,559
most seizure disorders so I just want to

556
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,360
answer that a little bit going into the

557
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:07,159
seizure someone was asking about that

558
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,159
seizure disorders epilepsy

559
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,880
until Mercury and aluminum are addressed

560
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:14,159
the conditions will continue to affect

561
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:15,960
millions of new kids each year

562
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,500
millions of new kids around the globe

563
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,500
each year

564
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,860
it's very easy for a baby to take in

565
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:24,780
toxic heavy metals from her or his

566
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:26,880
mother while in the womb and for a

567
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:29,039
father to pass along toxic heavy metals

568
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,960
at conception

569
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,880
mm info

570
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,280
that's because the parents have likely

571
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,140
accumulated Mercury over decades and so

572
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,179
did their mothers and fathers before

573
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,620
them and Mercury tends to stay in the

574
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:43,559
family both line generation after

575
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:46,200
generation in some cases for centuries

576
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:48,000
unless specific steps are taken to

577
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,080
remove it now that's I hate saying this

578
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,760
in the moment but that's original

579
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:53,400
medical meme info and when you see

580
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:56,280
somebody on a post somewhere

581
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:58,620
say you know like somebody that's trying

582
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:00,720
to amp up a crowd because there's there

583
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:02,880
are health coach or

584
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,919
whoever it is out there or influencer

585
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,720
and they'll be like Mercury can pass

586
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:09,419
from generation to generation but no

587
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:12,240
citation of family one medical medium

588
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:13,860
genetics are not behind ADHD and autism

589
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,360
now that's going to probably piss off a

590
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,740
few people right there me just saying

591
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,679
that but

592
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:21,299
it's so interesting and I talk about the

593
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,559
rest of this I mean it's so packed

594
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:24,240
there's so much information let's keep

595
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:26,280

and so happy to be here if you guys have

599
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:36,960
a little time I want to just cut into

600
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:38,880
some symptoms conditions I was talking

601
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,880
about neurological conditions which is

602
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:44,159

603
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:47,039
we were talking about too hello what do

604
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:50,520

question mark

607
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:56,900
let's head into brain saver a little bit

608
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:56,900
for depression

609
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:03,860
depression is something that people are

610
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:03,860
um

611
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,460
they feel like they're prisoners of

612
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:11,340
depression is

613
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:13,620
is not describable

614
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:15,059
by anyone who hasn't suffered from it

615
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,799
truly

616
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:19,380
I know that so many people have been

617
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:20,580
through so much but in here I have a

618
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:24,480
protocol

619
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:26,039

621
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:30,059
depression so let's hit that for a

622
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,860
little bit

623
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:33,960
what's incredible is there's a

624
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:36,419
depression chapter in

625
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,500
medical medium too as well so I'm going

626
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:39,960
to find

627
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:42,360

so I want to read to you a little bit

638
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,980
about this disorder so it's page 266.

639
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,860
I love when someone says oh you don't

640
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:28,200
know the topic so you have to read out

641
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:30,659
of your own book

642
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:33,240
you have to read after the book I mean

643
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:35,159
it's that much information when we hear

644
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,960
someone has depression we often have a

645
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:39,059
sense of what that means

646
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,860
they may feel hopeless they may feel

647
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:43,020
like their existence is worthless they

648
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:45,600
may they may feel guilty even though

649
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:48,120
they haven't committed any crime nothing

650
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:50,700
they do feels like any accomplishment is

651
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:52,740
made you guys know that sense and that

652
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:55,799
feeling right anybody who suffered or

653
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:58,380
struggled with depression how nothing

654
00:25:55,799 --> 00:26:00,900
soothes it nothing

655
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:04,620
makes it feel better

656
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:06,120
when it's there and it's in the way so

657
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:08,100
you guys are all saying yes you guys

658
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,940
have actually experienced that many of

659
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:12,059
you

660
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:14,880
wow and a lot of you guys have

661
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:17,880
experienced depression nothing a person

662
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,440
does feels like it's working you feel

663
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:22,440
lost

664
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,179
you feel even if you know where you're

665
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,620
supposed to be you feel like you're

666
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:28,020
still lost

667
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:29,580
I know that so many people feel like no

668
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:31,320
matter where they are if they're in the

669
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:34,140
right place or not their depression is

670
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:36,419
so agonizing upon them I see so many

671
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:38,400
yeses oh my God all you guys have all

672
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:41,580
you guys know what it likes is you know

673
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:43,860
what it's like suffer from depression

674
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:47,279
many people who have depression could be

675
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:49,200
around a loved one and they feel like

676
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:52,200
they're supposed to be somewhere else

677
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:54,360
because they're so lost they feel numb

678
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,440
did you guys ever have that where you

679
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:58,200
feel numb

680
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:00,179
at all with your depression

681
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,320
so I see many of you guys well a lot of

682
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:03,720
you guys have depression because you're

683
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:06,419
sick too you're sick for so long you've

684
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:08,580
been sick for a long time and you feel

685
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:11,640
actual like

686
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:13,559
oppression from that great sadness and

687
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:15,779
then a lot of you guys just feel

688
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:17,960
depression regardless you know what that

689
00:27:15,779 --> 00:27:17,960
is

690
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:21,779
along with these experiences of

691
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:23,880
depression there can be an inability to

692
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:26,820
receive any relief

693
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:28,380
heard that for so many people there's no

694
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:31,200
relief

695
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:34,200
depression compounds a depression

696
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,480
compounds upon itself

697
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,700
because part of a person's Consciousness

698
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,600
knows they tried so many Avenues to get

699
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:42,000
relief

700
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,679
it's like a failure feeling like you

701
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,940
you're trying to get relief for your

702
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,320
depression you're trying to fix it

703
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:49,340
you're trying to get past it and then

704
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:53,279
when it fails it's like more depression

705
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:55,500
compounds upon that depression right it

706
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:57,240
stacks on top of itself

707
00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:00,020
I know so many of you people have

708
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,020
experienced that

709
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,820
Lee Hines says I don't deal with

710
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,460
depression it is being exhausted all the

711
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:10,679
time so you're just in the exhaustion

712
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:12,659
phase all the time so let's hit that for

713
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:15,299
a little bit let's go into chronic

714
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:16,860

would ever have guessed it or known

739

until you crack into these and you find

00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:24,960
out what's wrong with you you find out

741
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:26,399
why you're sick why you're suffering and

742
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,679
you find out that there's something you

can do for it

744
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:33,779
when you actually Venture into this it's

745
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:36,120
a freedom that's indescribable

746
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:37,559
I've seen so many people

747
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:40,200
at a place

748
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:42,720
where they finally get free and nothing

749
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:45,299
describes that freedom and that feeling

750
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,320
of knowing why they're sick what went

751
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:47,880

00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:38,460
epidemic I'm going to go to page 31

770
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:40,520
Epstein-Barr virus

771
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,520
um

772
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:45,779

through the books I always find

781
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:03,000
something I have missed when I look

782
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:04,919
again

783
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,039
it's always like that it's the same

784
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:10,620
thing with me as well always like that

785
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:13,200
Frenchie league on IG says doctors I've

786
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:15,779
seen just don't understand because I

787
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:18,360
look fine on the outside so I can't be

788
00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:21,240
suffering on the inside and they may not

789
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:24,000
find anything on the inside either

790
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:26,580
so you're suffering on the inside in so

791
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,620
many different ways and they can't find

792
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:30,779
an answer

793
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:32,520
the Epstein-Barr virus has created a

794
00:31:30,779 --> 00:31:34,080
secret epidemic

795
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,640
we're at a place in time where the

796
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,440
majority of the world's population is

797
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,539
living with one or more of the many

798
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,980
mutations of Epstein-Barr virus and what

799
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:42,059
does it create since we're talking about

800
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:45,679
fatigue

801
00:31:42,059 --> 00:31:45,679

807
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:02,700

people with chronic fatigue syndrome

824
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:43,919
often hear that they are liars

825
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:45,600
lazy delusional or crazy it's an illness

826
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:48,179
that affects women

00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:56,820
with chronic fatigue in chronic fatigue

830
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:58,740
syndrome is on the rise it's becoming

831
00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:00,779
common for young women in college to

832
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:02,820
return home mid-semester with the

833
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:03,720
condition unable to do anything to lie

834
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:05,940
in bed

835
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:09,380
I've seen that years ago it's happening

836
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:09,380
more now than ever before

837
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:15,059
unable to do anything

838
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:17,399
Contracting chronic fatigue syndrome as

839
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:19,320
a person in your late teens or early 20s

840
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:21,600
can be particularly devastating as you

841
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:23,880
watch friends move on with relationships

842
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,740
and jobs meanwhile feeling stuck and

843
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:27,480
unable to live up to your potential and

844
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:28,860
maybe you're not in that condition but

845
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,899
you have chronic fatigue syndrome and

846
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:33,360
it's still hindering you in your life if

847
00:33:30,899 --> 00:33:35,100
you like your legs are like sandbags you

848
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,659
feel like you you literally you feel

849
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:38,640
like you're being held down like

850
00:33:36,659 --> 00:33:40,919
gravity's pulling you down as you walk

851
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:43,799
so as you're walking you feel like

852
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:46,019
gravity is holding you back because your

853
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:48,720
chronic fatigue syndrome is so intense

854
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:50,760
and so strong

855
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,380

870
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:26,639
here's something on Instagram right here

871
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,080
at home fitness says I used to have

872
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,480
narcolepsy

873
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:33,599
but healed because of your information

874
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:37,560
lemon water celery juice heavy metal

875
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:40,379

hydrating fruit low protein low fat Etc

877
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:43,980

878
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:47,000
narcolepsy

879
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:47,000
that's incredible

880
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:55,260
McIntyre 792 says I'm 24. 24 you're

00:34:52,919 --> 00:34:57,420
young I'm 24 and slowly seeing results

882
00:34:55,260 --> 00:35:00,599
after being on medical medium six months

883
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:04,740
so far to heal Tourette's

884
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:07,440
it's freeing to know it's not genetics

885
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:09,180
and uncurable like doctors told me my

886
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:14,220
whole childhood Tourette's is curable

887
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:16,920
Tourette's is healable Tourette's can

888
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:19,020
be reversed

889
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:21,540
I've had a doctor recently say that to

890
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:26,099
me a doctor said to me

891
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:28,520
aw Tourette's is fixable it's curable

892
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:33,240
that's what the doctor said to me

893
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:35,160
recently because he applied it to a

894
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:37,380
family member the information for

895
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:39,060

924
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:06,359
years ago medical meme information gave

933
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:28,740
I am not a smart guy but the books

supersede Medical Science in so many

935
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:33,240
ways it's unbelievable the information

936
00:37:30,839 --> 00:37:35,359
comes from above Tourette's syndrome is

937
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:38,280
caused primarily by Mercury and copper

938
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:41,300
Mercury and copper when you learn how to

939
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:44,540
get that out of your brain Tourette's

940
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:44,540
goes away

941
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:49,320
Tourette's syndrome is caused primarily

942
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:52,680
by Mercury and copper with traces of

943
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:54,960
lead impeding electrical impulses

944
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:57,480
in the brain here's how it happens when

945
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:00,119
an electrical impulse travels across the

946
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:02,160
synapses it's something like traveling

947
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:04,560
through a tunnel if it's a depositive

948
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:07,079
toxic heavy metal surrounds that tunnel

949
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:09,599
inside the brain the toxic heavy metals

950
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:11,700
narrow the channel creating a bottleneck

951
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:14,160
the electrical impulse traveling through

952
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:16,440
gets hung up practically stuck in a

953
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:18,119
short amount of time a fraction of a

954
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:20,160
second another electrical impulse

955
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:22,859
follows behind it this new electrical

956
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:25,260
limb pulse hits the impeded electrical

957
00:38:22,859 --> 00:38:27,540
impulse and propels the impeded

958
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:29,760
electrical impulse forward this is like

959
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:31,800
unlike OCD where an electrical impulse

960
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,900
hits a heavy metal deposit and gets

961
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,520
propelled backwards in Tourette's the

962
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:37,380
copper mixed with lead that's

963
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,900
surrounding the synapsis conducts the

964
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:41,579
electrical impulses forward even as the

965
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:44,339
bottlenecking blocks the impulses

966
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:45,780
physically to some degree sometimes both

967
00:38:44,339 --> 00:38:47,400
electrical impulses are even stuck

968
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:50,940
together combined and they shoot out

969
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:54,560
together and that's what Tourette's is

970
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:54,560
it's an electrical impulse

971
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:01,440
filled with information a thought and a

972
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:03,300
word you guys just got in there talking

973
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,460
about Tourette's so Tourette's is an

974
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:07,760
electrical impulse filled with

975
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,760
information

976
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:12,240
in that electricity in the electrical

977
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:14,400
impulse and thoughts

978
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:16,920
and emotions

979
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:20,400
and when it gets hung up

980
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:23,339
in that tube synapsis it shoots forward

981
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,359
out from being bottlenecked and when it

982
00:39:23,339 --> 00:39:26,339
does

983
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:28,440
Tourette's occurs now there's different

984
00:39:26,339 --> 00:39:30,960
varieties of threats

985
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:34,520
and in different ways depending on where

986
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,520
the metals are situated in the brand

987
00:39:34,859 --> 00:39:38,520
so we're talking about Tourette's

988
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:41,160
there's so much information in here you

989
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:42,540
guys we could spend days upon days weeks

990
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:44,460
upon weeks and it's still weeks still

991
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:47,400
couldn't cover it all there's protocols

992
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:51,000
in brain saver that you can customize

993
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:53,280
for everything customized for Tourette's

994
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,099
customized I'm looking on here

995
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:59,520
in here tremors

996
00:39:56,099 --> 00:40:01,940
vertigo trigeminal neuralgia it just is

997
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,940
endless

998
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:07,500
okay

999
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:10,260
ticks and spasms

1000
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:12,900
tinnitus

1001
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:14,520
and it goes on seizures let's talk about

1002
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:16,140
seizures for a minute because I know a

1003
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:18,960
lot of people know people with seizures

1004
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:22,339
a lot of people suffer greatly with that

1005
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,339
one so if you guys got a minute

1006
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:28,140
internet nonsense of severe seizures

1007
00:40:25,619 --> 00:40:30,900
come from large deposits of heavy metals

1008
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:33,480
rather than sprinklings

1009
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:35,520
so

1010
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:38,820
everybody has a sprinkling of toxic

1011
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:40,260
heavy metals inside their brain

1012
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:42,599
everybody

1013
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:43,980
has a sprinkling of toxic heavy metals

1014
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:46,940
inside their brain looks like Christmas

1015
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:46,940
tree lights

1016
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:56,400
okay sometimes there are even clusters

1017
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:58,200
of large deposits although it's usually

1018
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,880
only a cluster of two deposits when it

1019
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:02,220
comes down to seizures

1020
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:04,140
what creates these seizures is the

1021
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:07,140
interaction of metal specifically in

1022
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:09,720
alloy of mercury aluminum and copper

1023
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:11,940
with all three of those residing next to

1024
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:14,040
each other or sometimes even partially

1025
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:15,900
forged together through excessive heat

1026
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:17,760
exchange from past seizures most people

1027
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:19,740
who suffer from seizures

1028
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:23,220
severe seizures were exposed to all

1029
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:26,160
three Metals at the same time

1030
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:28,140
so I talk about with people that suffer

1031
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:30,420
from seizures they talk about all the

1032
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:31,859
details and it's really a huge piece of

1033
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:34,560
information in here

1034
00:41:31,859 --> 00:41:36,119
but there's a protocol for seizures in

1035
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:38,160
these books there's the brand saver

1036
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:41,099
protocols

1037
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:43,500
if I was having seizures

1038
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:45,000
I would dive into these books

1039
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:47,099
and I would start going through the

1040
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,500
protocols

1041
00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:52,320
I would get the metals out of my system

1042
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:55,380
out of my brain

1043
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:57,720
and minimize those seizures over time

1044
00:41:55,380 --> 00:42:01,440
it can be done because it has been done

1045
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:03,119
so many times for people

1046
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,640
but take the books to your doctor ask

1047
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:07,740
your doctor if it's okay and if if it's

1048
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:10,079
right for you and then your doctor tells

1049
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:12,720
you brain saver books

1050
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:14,400
have seizures in here you can find them

1051
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:16,380
in the brain saver books seizure and

1052
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,300
protocol seizure and

1053
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:21,300
here

1054
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:23,760
information and material

1055
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:27,140
epilepsy

1056
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,140
Okay so

1057
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:37,380
any of you guys ever had tinnitus

1058
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:39,300
popping in the year raining in the year

1059
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:41,339
I'm just curious on that right there

1060
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:42,839
because there's so many people there

1061
00:42:41,339 --> 00:42:44,099
because a lot of people so I want to go

1062
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:46,440
into this people who have chronic

1063
00:42:44,099 --> 00:42:50,400
fatigue syndrome

1064
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:53,339
most people with CFS or fatigue issues

1065
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:55,800
don't just have fatigue only

1066
00:42:53,339 --> 00:42:58,260
they have a little bit of dizziness see

1067
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:01,560
that they have some tinnitus we have

1068
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:04,200
some ringing and popping in the ear

1069
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:05,880
they have aches and pains a lot of

1070
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:08,160
people with fatigue chronic fatigue

1071
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:11,579
syndrome will also have some fibro

1072
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:15,500
and some tinnitus and some vertigo

1073
00:43:11,579 --> 00:43:15,500
when you look inside these books

1074
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:20,339
if you guys don't have the medical meme

1075
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:21,480
New Edition please consider it if you

1076
00:43:20,339 --> 00:43:23,579
guys don't have the brain saver

1077
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:25,319
protocols book or the brain zero please

1078
00:43:23,579 --> 00:43:27,599
consider it

1079
00:43:25,319 --> 00:43:29,460
get the information become an expert

1080
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:31,079
learn it

1081
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:34,560
get yourself better

1082
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:38,520
get yourself out of the woods

1083
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:40,380
pull yourself out of the woods

1084
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:42,900
with the information

1085
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:45,060
change your life

1086
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:47,339
change your life

1087
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:48,540
baby Paris says you're over there on

1088
00:43:47,339 --> 00:43:50,099
YouTube

1089
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:53,460
I say you left the YouTube comment the

1090
00:43:50,099 --> 00:43:55,859
other day day four of 369 advanced

1091
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:58,079
doing this for my allergies they were

1092
00:43:55,859 --> 00:44:01,440
horrible this year proud of you Bibi

1093
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:01,440
Paris amazing

1094
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:10,980
and IG do you explain memory and inflect

1095
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:14,400
loss at early age of 45

1096
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:16,560
oh my god do I ever

1097
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:19,079
do I ever how about memory loss

1098
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:21,300
protocols how about protocols for memory

1099
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:22,619
loss

1100
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:24,420
seriously

1101
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:25,920
they're here

1102
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:30,020
they're here

1103
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:30,020
incredible protocols for memory loss

1104
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:36,000
Alzheimer's memory issues dementia

1105
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:37,980
there's a dementia Alzheimer's chapter

1106
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,800
but just because you have memory loss

1107
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:42,359
don't don't go to that place

1108
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:46,020
then that doesn't mean you have anything

1109
00:44:42,359 --> 00:44:47,640
like that it's easy to have trauma and

1110
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:49,319
have memory loss

1111
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:51,300
it's easy to have trauma in your life

1112
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:52,740
and have memory loss it's easy to have

1113
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:55,260
too many toxic heavy metals in your

1114
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:58,819
brain and have memory loss

1115
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:58,819
it's easy for that to happen

1116
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:06,500
so

1117
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:12,380
so much information in here I just

1118
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,380
opened it up to microdosing

1119
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:18,480
Erica asks any other languages on this

1120
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:20,040
books these books yes

1121
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,599
um almost in every single country in the

1122
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:23,040
world

1183
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:09,660
it's nobody's fault

1184
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:11,700
but wait a minute

1185
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:14,579
sometimes it's not just that sometimes

1186
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:16,619
it's exposure exposure unexpected

1187
00:48:14,579 --> 00:48:18,780
exposure and I thought that I talked

1188
00:48:16,619 --> 00:48:22,680
about that I just read that earlier

1189
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:22,680
what that means Beatrice

1190
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:29,460
where did you go Beatrice Beatrice my

1191
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:33,540
heart starts racing just as I'm about to

1192
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:36,540
fall asleep what is it due to

1193
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:38,819
also has unpleasant extra strong

1194
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:40,260
Heartbeats

1195
00:48:38,819 --> 00:48:41,339
so

1196
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:43,380
look

1197
00:48:41,339 --> 00:48:46,260
if your heart's racing that falls under

1198
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:48,900
like ectopic heartbeat it falls under

1199
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:51,480
it's not that but it falls under the

1200
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:54,119
hole right you've got something going on

1201
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:56,099
with the heart heart racing but you've

1202
00:48:54,119 --> 00:48:57,960
gone to your doctors your doctors didn't

1203
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:59,700
diagnose you with afib your doctors

1204
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:01,560
didn't diagnose you with ectopical

1205
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:03,060
heartbeat or doctors didn't diagnose you

1206
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:04,859
with something

1207
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:06,780
so that's another thing all on its own

1208
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:09,060
did you get a diagnosis from the doctor

1209
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:10,260
you know telling you what it is it's one

1210
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:12,839
thing to know

1211
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:14,420
another thing is a lot of people have

1212
00:49:12,839 --> 00:49:15,960
racing

1213
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:19,140
Heartbeats

1214
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:21,839
racing pulse racing heart

1215
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:25,140
I mean there's so many things people are

1216
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:27,900
dealing with one is just falling asleep

1217
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:31,079
is because you're calming yourself down

1218
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:33,900
enough to feel the fact that that's

1219
00:49:31,079 --> 00:49:36,420
fluctuating I've had a lot of people go

1220
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:38,160
through that in life where it's that

1221
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:38,940
moment when you're laying down to go to

1222
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:41,400
bed

1223
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:43,079
right there another thing too A lot of

1224
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:45,420
people have anxiety before they go to

1225
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:47,579
sleep and it cranks up there's so many

1226
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:49,140
reasons why people deal with that I'm

1227
00:49:47,579 --> 00:49:51,140
giving you a whole bunch of them because

1228
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:54,119
I want everybody to have an option

1229
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:55,920
something there's hundreds of people out

1230
00:49:54,119 --> 00:49:58,260
there right now watching this so I want

1231
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:00,300
to make sure they can kind of find their

1232
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:03,119
way with this a lot of you guys might

1233
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:04,619
have a racing heart at different times a

1234
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:08,040
lot of you guys might have tachycardia

1235
00:50:04,619 --> 00:50:09,660
aphid you might have heart palps

1236
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:11,099
um

1237
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:13,560
um all the different issues with with

1238
00:50:11,099 --> 00:50:15,000
their heart racing the heartbeat

1239
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:17,760
and

1240
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:21,599
so I talk about it in these books a lot

1241
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:23,819
of people have electricity heart racing

1242
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:26,640
it's electricity it's coming from the

1243
00:50:23,819 --> 00:50:27,720
brain stem coming from the brain down to

1244
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:30,119
the heart

1245
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:32,099
and racing the heart and it's not a

1246
00:50:30,119 --> 00:50:34,260
physical heart problem

1247
00:50:32,099 --> 00:50:36,180
a lot of people just have so much junk

1248
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:38,280
in the liver that's another reason too

1249
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:40,560
they get a stickiness inside the valves

1250
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:43,260
I've talked about that for years

1251
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:45,660
Palace he says my nephew is throwing up

1252
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:49,980
10 times a day

1253
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:52,140
no doctors can figure it out please help

1254
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:54,660
that's awful

1255
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:56,520
it really is what I recommend is take

1256
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:57,720
the doctors take the books to your

1257
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:59,339
doctors

1258
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:02,700
had it backwards

1259
00:50:59,339 --> 00:51:03,599
take the books to your doctors

1260
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:06,720
um

1261
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:08,700
ask your doctors if it's okay

1262
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:11,359
right if you can go there go look into

1263
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:11,359
the books

1264
00:51:12,119 --> 00:51:17,160
customize a protocol

1265
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:20,280
start with the basics take it to the

1266
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:22,200
doctor and if the doctor is all right

1267
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:25,559
about that so let's go into that so you

1268
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:27,900
have a nephew that's throwing up so if I

1269
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:30,240
had a nephew that was throwing up 10

1270
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:34,140
times a day I would be going into

1272
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:38,819

00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:34,740
when someone is experiencing nausea or

1308
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:36,960
vomiting the first thing almost everyone

1309
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:39,440
assumes is that it's a stomach related

1310
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,440
issue

1311
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:44,520
someone who visits a doctor complaining

1312
00:53:41,819 --> 00:53:46,680
of nausea will grip your stomach like

1313
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:49,319
your nephew did I'm sure your nephew did

1314
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:50,280
that will grip their stomach because

1315
00:53:49,319 --> 00:53:52,940
that's where they're feeling

1316
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:52,940
uncomfortable

1317
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:57,540
it's true that these symptoms can

1318
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:59,819
originate from the stomach in intestinal

1319
00:53:57,540 --> 00:54:02,300
area when food poisoning our stomach flu

1320
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:05,460
are behind the symptoms in some cases

1321
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:07,559
stomach cancer can also cause nausea and

1322
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:09,900
vomiting although in many cases they're

1323
00:54:07,559 --> 00:54:13,079
not symptoms of the disease most cases

1324
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:13,859
of unexplained nausea now get this

1325
00:54:13,079 --> 00:54:16,260
foreign

1326
00:54:13,859 --> 00:54:18,240
most cases of unexplained Aussie and

1327
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:21,000
vomiting have everything to do with the

1328
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:23,940
central nervous system and nearby nerves

1329
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:26,220
central nervous system and nearby nerves

1330
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:28,280
keep that in mind here all right when

1331
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:31,319
you're dealing with mystery nausea

1332
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:32,940
sensual nervous system

1333
00:54:31,319 --> 00:54:36,000
come on big guy

1334
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:39,900
let's get over here somewhere let's see

1335
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:43,700
if we can get you over here uh

1336
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:43,700
let's let's try this here

1337
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:48,720
central nervous system

1338
00:54:47,099 --> 00:54:51,180
so

1339
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:53,880
if I had a nephew

1340
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:56,040
that was vomiting 10 times a day

1341
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:58,339
doctors didn't know what it was they

1342
00:54:56,040 --> 00:55:02,880
probably looked at tummy

1343
00:54:58,339 --> 00:55:06,000
colonoscopy endoscopy all of it right

1344
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:07,740
I would be looking here

1345
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,200
in the brain

1346
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:13,819
central nervous system

1347
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:13,819
right but wait

1348
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:22,640
the vagus nerves which originate in the

1349
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:22,640
brain stem

1350
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:28,920
okay

1351
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:31,500
multitasking here just bear with me

1352
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:33,540
the vagus nerves which originate in the

1353
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:34,859
brain stem are the most important nerves

1354
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:37,920
regarding anything to do with the

1355
00:55:34,859 --> 00:55:41,040
stomach if the vagus nerves are inflamed

1356
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:43,380
or irritated on any level whether up in

1357
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:45,420
or near the brain itself or down closer

1358
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:47,099
to the stomach the vagus nerves

1359
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:49,020
affecting the stomach

1360
00:55:47,099 --> 00:55:52,819
do you see where I'm going

1361
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:52,819
the vagus nerve affecting the stomach

1362
00:55:53,099 --> 00:56:01,440
the vagus nerves can go into spasm

1363
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:03,720
nausea can occur

1364
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:06,000
often the reason for vagus nerve

1365
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:09,420
inflammation is a chronic low-grade

1366
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:12,260
viral infection that's releasing

1367
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:12,260
neurotoxins

1368
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:16,079
take the book to your doctor ask your

1369
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:17,400
doctor if it's a low-grade viral

1370
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:20,099
infection

1371
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:22,800
affecting the vagus nerve through

1372
00:56:20,099 --> 00:56:24,839
neurotoxin inflammation and what's

1373
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:27,900
Happening Here is

1374
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:31,040
in a nutshell the vagus nerve is

1375
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:35,099
inflamed and aggravated and agitated

1376
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:39,540
causing a heaving spasm to happen which

1377
00:56:35,099 --> 00:56:43,760
means vomiting with no

1378
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:43,760
reason it's a mystery

1379
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:49,980
Celeste Waldo says you're so amazing aw

that you're listening to this telegram

messages I will leave more

1391
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:22,740
toxic heavy metals inside the brain

1392
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:25,980
close to the vagus nerves you guys can

1393
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:27,660
also cause nausea so toxic heavy metals

1394
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:29,880
inside the brain

1395
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:32,400
can cause nausea

1396
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:35,640
brand new exposure to a heavy metal such

1397
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:39,240
as mercury can cause nausea and vomiting

1398
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:42,660
I would say to my nephew did you get any

1399
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:45,480
new exposure I don't know about

1400
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:47,400
you didn't tell me were you

1401
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:49,020
I'm not saying your nephew does this on

1402
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:50,940
here I'm just saying were you vaping

1403
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:53,420
were you doing something that has toxic

1404
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:56,220
heavy metal exposure

1405
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:58,460
vaping is definitely an antagonistic

1406
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:58,460
thing

1407
00:57:59,819 --> 00:58:05,099
no judgment for anybody who Vapes it's

1408
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:07,140
not uncommon for someone to get all

1409
00:58:05,099 --> 00:58:08,460
their dental amalgam fillings removed

1410
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:10,680
and be overcome by these symptoms

1411
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:12,599
afterward D2 Mercury exposure causing

1412
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:14,280
vomiting all the time

1413
00:58:12,599 --> 00:58:17,640

00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:51,480
phagus nerve

1428
00:58:49,619 --> 00:58:52,980
allowing a baby syrup to be extra

1469
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:29,240
here

1470
01:00:25,859 --> 01:00:29,240
we're a mystery vomiting

1471
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:35,280
sinus infections from strep that's been

1472
01:00:33,359 --> 01:00:37,440
the walls of the sinus cavities for

1473
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:39,480
years can also cause chronic nausea as a

1474
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:41,220
result of sinus nerves affecting facial

1475
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:44,160
nerves and other cranial nerves

1476
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:46,579
eventually placing pressure on the vagus

1477
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:46,579
nerves

1478
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:54,420
there are certain situations where

1479
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:56,160
someone can have acid reflux due to a

1480
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:58,319
toxic liver and overload of strep rates

1481
01:00:56,160 --> 01:01:00,480
pylori and the intestinal tracting sibo

1482
01:00:58,319 --> 01:01:02,040
and this can cause nausea too so I'm

1483
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:03,480
giving you just a couple of rundown how

1484
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:05,220
many people have nauseated

1485
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:07,740
you so many of you guys probably have

1486
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:09,359
chronic nausea

1487
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:10,260
and

1488
01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:12,240
um

1489
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:14,099
but you're not projectile vomiting or

1490
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:17,299
vomiting every day a bunch of times many

1599
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:44,880
on IG miyamona says hi Anthony could you

1600
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:46,619
say something about getting acne after

1601
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:49,160
being two years on medical beating

1602
01:06:46,619 --> 01:06:49,160
protocols

1603
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:53,359
okay so a couple of things

1604
01:06:53,520 --> 01:07:01,020
you can go and Shop in the grocery store

1605
01:06:57,420 --> 01:07:03,020
grab the handles on the carriage

1606
01:07:01,020 --> 01:07:04,920
it's loaded with streptococcus

1607
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:07,859
streptococcal whatever however you want

1608
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:09,420
to say I like saying streptococcus

1609
01:07:07,859 --> 01:07:12,000
and I know a doctor friendly call to

1610
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:15,660
streptococcus or either or

1611
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:19,859
it's loaded with strep all on the handle

1612
01:07:15,660 --> 01:07:21,839
of your Carriage load it

1613
01:07:19,859 --> 01:07:23,880
it's not just loaded with strap from

1614
01:07:21,839 --> 01:07:26,220
everybody wiping their ass

1615
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:29,480
and having it on their hands

1616
01:07:26,220 --> 01:07:29,480
because quite frankly

1617
01:07:33,299 --> 01:07:37,319
I know a lot of people that only use one

1618
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:39,000
sheet to wipe their ass and I understand

1619
01:07:37,319 --> 01:07:42,859
why

1620
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,859
because toilet paper costs money

1621
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:53,720
but if I wiped my ass with this sheet

1622
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:53,720
my hand would definitely be soiled

1623
01:07:54,660 --> 01:07:57,260
so

1624
01:07:57,359 --> 01:08:03,740
everybody out there

1625
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,740
has their feces on their hands

1626
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:07,319
unless they're washing their hands

1627
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:09,180
before they go into the grocery store

1628
01:08:07,319 --> 01:08:12,680
and grab the cart

1629
01:08:09,180 --> 01:08:12,680
which I highly doubt

1630
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:19,020
there's gonna be strep 10 different ways

1631
01:08:17,699 --> 01:08:22,339
till Sunday

1632
01:08:19,020 --> 01:08:22,339
on that card handle

1633
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:27,600
if you're not doing an alcohol rub on

1634
01:08:25,199 --> 01:08:28,980
that card handle

1635
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:30,960
whatever

1636
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:32,660
all you have to do is get that on your

1637
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:35,279
hands and here's the problem

1638
01:08:32,660 --> 01:08:37,319
antibiotic resistant strips

1639
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:39,600
strips that can put people in hospitals

1640
01:08:37,319 --> 01:08:42,960
are all over those handles and door

1641
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:46,739
handles and carriage handles

1642
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:48,779
it's easy to pick up a new strip on The

1643
01:08:46,739 --> 01:08:51,239
Daily

1644
01:08:48,779 --> 01:08:54,420
you can reverse your conditions heal

1645
01:08:51,239 --> 01:08:56,279
your Epstein-Barr heal things take the

1646
01:08:54,420 --> 01:08:58,080
metals out of your body and guess what

1647
01:08:56,279 --> 01:09:00,839
you can go and pick up a brand new strap

1648
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:03,319
and get a new batch of acne or a UTI or

1649
01:09:00,839 --> 01:09:03,319
something else

1650
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:08,699
so the tools in these books are to knock

1651
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:10,500
down what you're getting

1652
01:09:08,699 --> 01:09:12,179
I know people that have healed with

1653
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:13,859
medical medium information got into a

1654
01:09:12,179 --> 01:09:15,839
brand new relationship

1655
01:09:13,859 --> 01:09:17,880
with a new partner picked up two or

1656
01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:19,739
three new epstein-bars two brand new

1657
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:22,319
straps

1658
01:09:19,739 --> 01:09:24,779
a Simplex herpes one and they went back

1659
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:27,179
to drawing board again

1660
01:09:24,779 --> 01:09:29,100
I'm not saying you can't have intimacy

1661
01:09:27,179 --> 01:09:31,620
or you shouldn't have a relationship

1662
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:33,000
that's not it at all nothing to do with

1663
01:09:31,620 --> 01:09:35,219
that

1664
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:38,060
I'm just saying that the protocols are

1665
01:09:35,219 --> 01:09:38,060
here for life

1666
01:09:38,219 --> 01:09:42,660
life

1667
01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:44,699
a lot of people heal from their bugs

1668
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:47,339
that they already have and then go and

1669
01:09:44,699 --> 01:09:49,500
collect a whole round of another batch

1670
01:09:47,339 --> 01:09:51,719
of bugs

1671
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:53,520

1703
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:11,000
people

1704
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:17,400
they'll um they'll also keep in mind

1705
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:19,560
this this can happen too your immune

1706
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:20,760
system is battling a lot of different

1707
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:21,900
things inside your body so you're

1708
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:23,520
somebody that's got a lot going on

1709
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:24,840
you've got to strep from acne or you've

1710
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:27,360
got a strap from strep throat from

1711
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:28,980
childhood you've got uh you had

1712
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:30,659
mononucleosis when you were a child you

1713
01:11:28,980 --> 01:11:32,820
have two or three different viruses you

1714
01:11:30,659 --> 01:11:34,500
have metals and you your immune system

1715
01:11:32,820 --> 01:11:36,420
is battling off that and then other

1716
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:39,000
exposures right the immune system is

1717
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:40,500
trying to gobble all that up and eat all

1718
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:43,080
that up right that's what your immune

1719
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:44,699
system is doing and then you guys

1720
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:46,320
has your immune system's gobbling

1721
01:11:44,699 --> 01:11:49,320
everything up up and eating everything

1722
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:50,940
up you're healing

1723
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:54,239
you're healing

1724
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:56,400
but when there's a lot to heal

1725
01:11:54,239 --> 01:11:59,040
anything can trigger you and tip you

1726
01:11:56,400 --> 01:12:01,199
back too maybe you had blood work done

1727
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:03,179
and they took too much blood and you

1728
01:12:01,199 --> 01:12:05,960
didn't read the blood draw chapter right

1729
01:12:03,179 --> 01:12:05,960
here in this book

1730
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:12,300
the blood draw chapter is critical to

1731
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:14,040
read it so critical I can't even say it

1732
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:17,280
so let me let me go in here and it's an

1733
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:18,960
insane chapter it's just insane

1734
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:21,659
yeah

1735
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:23,520
so I got some vials of blood here I just

1736
01:12:21,659 --> 01:12:25,560
happen to keep blood sphere blood in the

1737
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:27,179
refrigerator

1738
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:30,780
should I just open the refrigerator I

1739
01:12:27,179 --> 01:12:32,940
happen to keep spare blood

1740
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:36,300
and I'm gonna bring some vials of blood

1741
01:12:32,940 --> 01:12:38,820
here you think this is a Biohazard

1742
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:41,940
is this a do you think this these

1743
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:44,600
bottles of my blood or a blood or a

1744
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:44,600
Biohazard

1745
01:12:45,659 --> 01:12:50,640
anyway okay so

1746
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:52,560
what happens is that people

1747
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:54,120
they're healing they're working on their

1748
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:55,560
healing they're battling a whole bunch

1749
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:58,920
of different problems in their health

1750
01:12:55,560 --> 01:13:01,860
they're battling bugs they're battling a

1751
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:05,219
condition of some kind

1752
01:13:01,860 --> 01:13:07,020
that's caused by pathogens their immune

1753
01:13:05,219 --> 01:13:08,640
system is working really hard and then

1754
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:11,580
they go to their doctor for routine

1755
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:13,679
blood work and the doctor's drawing a

1756
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:15,719
ton of blood out of them

1757
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:16,920
and so you want to understand this you

1758
01:13:15,719 --> 01:13:19,260
want to know this because I'll tell you

1759
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:21,480
right now I've seen this bring people to

1760
01:13:19,260 --> 01:13:24,420
their knees and bring them to an early

1761
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:26,280
grave I'm not against blood testing I

1762
01:13:24,420 --> 01:13:28,320
sound like a broken record I'm not

1763
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:30,719
against blood testing I'm not against

1764
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:32,400
blood testing

1765
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:34,560
but there's things you have to

1766
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:37,920
understand about getting your blood

1767
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:39,780
drawn and that alone can knock your

1768
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:42,239
immune system back so if you still have

1769
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:44,219
a strep inside you boom now you got acne

1770
01:13:42,239 --> 01:13:45,960
a month after you had your blood work

1771
01:13:44,219 --> 01:13:48,300
two months after you had your blood work

1772
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:50,400
as your immune system drops

1773
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:54,840
so it isn't just always catching new

1774
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:56,820
bugs which it is a lot it's also

1775
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:59,100
it's also your immune system dropping

1776
01:13:56,820 --> 01:14:01,140
for some other reason you have no idea

1777
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:03,120
about because you weren't taught

1778
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:06,300

understand

1882
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:34,440
and I know this runs through people's

1883
01:18:32,699 --> 01:18:37,560
veins

1884
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:39,540
it's blaming yourself

1885
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:41,880
blaming yourself

1886
01:18:39,540 --> 01:18:43,260
for any kind of adversity and any kind

1887
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:45,780

1908
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:43,620
