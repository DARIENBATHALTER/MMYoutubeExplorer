The New Normal so no more guessing games

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:46,160
it's time to get answers welcome to the

13
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:46,160
medical medium podcast I'm Anthony

14
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,559
William hey everybody today we're doing

15
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:55,840
a powerful brain meditation for letting

16
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:58,760
go of fear and riding fear from our soul

17
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,320
spirit and heart fear is something that

18
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:04,199
becomes a part of of our soul and it

19
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,560
gets in the way of who we truly are and

20
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:11,119
it can end up taking away a piece of who

21
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:14,200
we are and shadowing who we aspire to

22
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:18,080
be as we go through life and live

23
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:21,799
through hardships betrayal broken trust

24
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:25,119
losses broken friendships relationships

25
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:28,479
or emotional struggles of any kind we

26
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:31,720
have small outof body experiences where

27
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:34,159
our soul lead Lees our brain and body

28
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:37,600
and a disconnect happens and there

29
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:42,439
becomes an empty space between our soul

30
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:45,479
and brain a distance and fear fills the

31
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:48,479
Gap this meditation is about taking

32
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:52,719
control over your life not letting fear

33
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:55,280
run you or own you in any way this will

34
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:57,640
allow your neurons that are in the

35
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,880
emotional Center of your brain to

36
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:04,000
reconnect to your soul and redirect

37
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:07,399

down a

54
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:27,280
road and you see a bridge in the

55
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:35,080
distance

56
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:35,080
it can be whatever type of bridge you

57
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:42,480
like it can be a wooden

58
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:45,799
bridge a swinging bridge suspended over

59
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,799
a canyon or

60
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:53,599
Ravine it can be a larger Bridge

61
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:53,599
Crossing a wide

62
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,120
river

63
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:07,159
once you envision your

64
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,159
bridge take a deep breath

65
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:13,720

66
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,040
release you are

67
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:31,600
alone you are standing on the

68
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:31,600
road exactly where the bridge starts

69
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,680
don't walk across the bridge

70
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:48,800
yet first get a clear image of what's

71
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,800
before

72
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,720
you it's a bridge that's in

73
00:04:54,759 --> 00:05:01,560
disarray it seems to be under

74
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,560
construction in desperate need of

75
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:10,000
repair it has chunks of bridge

76
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:13,600
missing piles of wood scrap metal and

77
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,600
trash everywhere on the

78
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,400
bridge but the bridge is still

79
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:30,800
standing you see a beat up sign it says

80
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:34,280
warning out of commission

81
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,280
use at your own

82
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:42,759
risk as you stand there looking at the

83
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:46,280
debris and Rubble that's on the bridge

84
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:48,919

fog

180
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:38,600
you look to the right of

you and there is a broken down

182
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:47,040
car you look ahead of

183
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:49,320
you and it's a waste

parents and their

190
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:14,920
children with fishing

195
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:30,880
disaster you did not see them

bridge and a friendly puppy comes

214
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:42,279

00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:00,759
retriever the puppy begins to lick your

220
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,759
hand

223
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:16,759
sense how did it get here from the other

224
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:21,880
side behind the puppy is a hole in the

225
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:21,880
bridge and behind that hole is debris

226
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:29,240
everywhere you hear the voice

227
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:31,000

00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:22,120
safe all of a

242
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:22,120
sudden a leash appears attached to the

243
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,000
puppy and at the other end of the leash

244
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:31,519
is a

245
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,519
person who offers a delightful

246
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:38,279
smile you think how is this

247
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:42,440
possible as they walk by

248
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:46,720
you you turn around to look at them and

249
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,720
they disappear in the fog and are

250
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:54,600
gone but you are gaining a little bit of

251
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:57,880
trust step by step on this

252
00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:01,399
bridge as you discover pieces of the

253
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:01,399
bridge are

254
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:09,399
safe but now all that's left before you

255
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:12,279
is a giant hole in the

256
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:15,360
bridge and you are not sure that trust

257
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:17,959
and confidence will be enough to carry

258
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:21,839
you across this

259
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:26,319
hole do you see the hole in the

260
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:26,319

step you can fall through that hole and

268
00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:55,600

now you get to the last step of the

348
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:07,320
bridge and you're standing

349
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:14,360
there and the person who's been calling

350
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:16,400
you all along from the other side is

351
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:22,480
standing there as

352
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:26,279
well right in front of you waiting for

353
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:29,720
you and it becomes

354
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:31,200
clear this person

355
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:34,919
was

356
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,919
you this whole

357
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:48,200
time your soul was

358
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:51,880
waiting at the other end of the

359
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:55,480
bridge and the fear that was keeping you

360
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:55,480
apart is now

361
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:02,799

362
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,799

365
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:28,360
eyes we don't realize that when we go

366
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:31,360
through life our soul becomes in injured

367
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:34,640
from betrayal and broken trust and this

368
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:37,600
creates fear within us this hinders the

369
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:40,799
bridge between our soul and our physical

370
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:43,440
brain and this bridge is the connection

371
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:45,480
that allows us to feel safe and to trust

372
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,400
again and not live in

373
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:51,320
fear you have now completed the

374
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:53,679
meditation that Bridges your soul to

375
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:56,159
your physical neurons in the emotional

376
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:59,840
Center of your brain so that the

377
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:03,240
connection between them grows strong and

378
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:06,559
fear and broken trust won't hold you

379
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:09,360
back feel free to repeat this meditation

380
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:12,640
daily every other day or a couple times

381
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:15,919
a week because each time it only becomes

382
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:19,640
more powerful in its ability to mend the

383
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:25,720
bridge between your soul and your

384
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:25,720
body I believe in you and I know you can

385
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,799
