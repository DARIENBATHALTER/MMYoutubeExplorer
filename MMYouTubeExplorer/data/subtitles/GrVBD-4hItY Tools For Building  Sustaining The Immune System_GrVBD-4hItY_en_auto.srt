our immune systems are under a lot these

48
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,939
days right everybody's are okay so we

49
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,799
want to keep our immune system strong

50
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:55,979
keep in mind this is really important to

51
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:58,200
know if you got any kind of symptoms any

52
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:59,939
kind or if you've got any kind of

53
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,159
diagnosis if you're you're someone with

54
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:05,759
Hashimoto's thyroiditis or

55
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,399
hyperthyroidism right or fatigue or

56
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,140
anything anxiety or lupus or

57
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,060
neurological Lyme or whatever it is

58
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:16,099
you're dealing with your immune system

59
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:19,080
is already struggling so it's already

60
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:20,819
weakened along the way your immune

61
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:24,599
system's already been weakened along the

62
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:26,459
way and then the flu comes and hits us

63
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:28,200
and knocks us down and then we're

64
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:30,720
knocked down and then

65
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,700
we go when we go and we go to the doctor

66
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,040
we get a blood test

67
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,720
and we get our blood drawn out of us and

68
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,080
then boom our immune system gets knocked

69
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,300
down again right down to the floor okay

70
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,980
so we get hit in all these ways that's

71
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,599
just a couple of ways we get our immune

72
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,099
systems down low when they start to

73
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,680
knock down like that right and then we

74
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:52,140
get all upset about things we get worked

75
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,019
up and then boom adrenals

76
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:57,000
fight or flight fight or flight fight or

77
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:58,560
flight and her immune system is dropping

78
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,959
then too

79
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,599
see then where our immune system is

80
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,760
getting hit hard on that as well you're

81
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,640
upset about something emotional

82
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,800
confrontation emotional stress of any

83
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,440
kind any kind of struggle hardship

84
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,720
difficulty and then we got adrenaline

85
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,739
running and it drops down our immune

86
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:20,280
system

87
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:21,720
so that's another thing all on its own

88
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,519
and then

89
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:27,060
our brain

90
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,560
starts to get toasted it gets toasted it

91
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:32,940
gets beaten down

92
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,560
right so our mind it gets beaten down so

93
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:37,319
easily these days everybody's going

94
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,120
through so much and that breaks down our

95
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:42,180
immune system too because that's a lot

96
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,680
on us right it's a lot on us so there's

97
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,299
a lot of reasons why our immune system

98
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,700
takes a hit

99
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:50,220
and there's things that happen in our

100
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,780
personal lives that lower our immune

101
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:54,540
system but what's the note what's really

102
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:57,360
annoying what's really annoying

103
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:59,519
is when we got enough on our plate

104
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:03,180
personally right in our life and then we

105
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,680
have outside Invaders

106
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,980
flew

107
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,299
anything happening in the flu family

108
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:12,120
bugs people are worried about that are

109
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:14,580
going around right and we have that

110
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,840
outside sources salt in the wound you

112
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,680
crap on our hands with their immune

113
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:21,660
systems as if we got enough difficulties

114
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,699
with our immune systems next thing you

115
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,840

offer my family and my friends is of

160
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,419
course it's got to be the liquid zinc

sulfate that's the best one there is out

162
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:05,220

163
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:07,199
not sponsored by these guys just telling

164
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:09,660
you right off the running it's vimorgy

165
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:12,960
these in Victor I Amazon Mary e r g

166
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:15,240
y.com themergy.com that's the zinc I use

167
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,460
for my friends and family it's critical

168
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,460
for immune system stuff and if you look

169
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:22,020
at the medical medium books right

170
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:26,160
if you look at like cleanse the heel

171
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:28,620
okay and you see autoimmune in here and

172
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,600
you see symptoms and conditions in here

173
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,979
because there's almost 200 or over 200

174
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,319
when when you go through the book of

175
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:37,139
symptoms and conditions right you'll see

176
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,780
zinc is for these symptoms and

177
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:41,819
conditions there's a reason when we're

178
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:46,319
sick and we have a symptom or condition

179
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:48,840
our immune system is down it's down

180
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:51,060
that's the whole point zinc builds it

181
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:53,280
back up because we're zinc deficient

182
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:55,680
that's what happens out there we're zinc

183
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:58,259
deficient very important to know

184
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,639
okay we're zinc deficient because we're

185
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:02,400
up against so much we're up against

186
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:04,560
bacteria we're up against viruses we're

187
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,139
up against these things so we get zinc

188
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,300
deficient zinc gets burned up it gets

189
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:10,380
used up really quick and easy in the

190
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,180
body

191
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:15,960

is a great tool to knock things back

225
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:37,440

00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:38,459
I mean like really I mean that's what it

227

can do

228
00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:42,779
and I talked about it years ago it's a

229
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,760
medical medium tool you know when you

230
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:46,680

237
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,700
you pick something up

238
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,500
and a lot of people were sick with

239
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,540
symptoms and conditions they already

240
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,279

um you know they're sensitive sensitive

257
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:53,880

00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,100
sensitive know what I'm talking about

259
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:58,260

00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,300
supplement there right really sensitive

261
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,740

there right and I'm talking about what

266
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,600
to do for our immune system and I'm not

267
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:19,079
sponsored by those guys

268
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,820
um great people okay I get to know the

269
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:22,560
the different companies that have the

270
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:25,260
best products out there I get to know

271
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,660
them I like having relationships this

272
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:29,459
way I can keep my eyes on things is the

273
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:32,820
product staying at its highest qualities

274
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:34,620
the product staying at its best and I've

275
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:36,420
lost a lot of relationships throughout

276
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:38,339
the years because companies would not

277
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:40,740
keep that quality they would not keep

278
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:43,620
that quality insurance you know and keep

279
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:45,060
all that Holy keep it right and they

280
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,100
would change because they have free will

281
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:48,660
and they can change their recipes change

282
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:52,620
their products and then I'm like I'm

283
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:54,540
done but Bemidji incredible products um

284
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:56,700

that because they have hearts of gold

286
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:01,320
there's a lot of companies that I've

287
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:04,200
that I work with in the sense where

288
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,820
making sure their stuff is good

289
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,560

291
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:15,300
let's talk about vitamin C shock therapy

292
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:19,200
vitamin C shock therapy okay is

293
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:22,500
that's a really good one too so this is

294
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:26,240
this is a vitamin C that's amazing for

295
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:28,680
people who are sensitive to vitamin C

296
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,320
ascorbic acid

297
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:35,519
it's really harsh on a lot of people's

298
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:38,040
system ascorbic acid okay and this isn't

299
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:42,420
ascorbic acid this isn't like the

300
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:44,880
battery acid vitamin C out there this is

301
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:46,620
buffered in a way that's gentle on the

302
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:50,220
system so that's what I love about the

303
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:52,920
micro C and Powerful right so there's

304
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:54,019

310
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:08,100
what happens here with the the micro C

311
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:10,980

so I'm talking about another powerful

395
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:41,480
tool golden seal now this is interesting

396
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:45,660
because

397
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:48,899
Goldenseal is in supplements out there

398
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:51,600
okay immune like immune strengthening

399
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:52,800
supplements and so forth but they use a

400
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,500
speck of it

401
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,880
spec of it and it's usually mixed in a

402
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:00,720
formula with a whole bunch of other

403
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:04,800
stuff okay and over the years

404
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:06,720
I have seen that never work I have never

405
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,839
seen that work

406
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,759
when a speck of it is used where they

407
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,740
literally use less than what you see

408
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:16,380
there as a drop that's one drop right

409
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:18,660
there you use one drop it's in a formula

410
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:19,440
or a capsule with a whole bunch of other

411
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:22,019
things

412
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:25,079
I've never seen that be effective when

413
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:29,220
someone is getting a UTI a bad case of

414
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:32,220
acne conjunctivitis a stye strep throat

415
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:34,920
a sore throat a flu a cold I've never

416
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:37,740
seen that work

417
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:39,899
I've seen practitioners tell people go

418
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:41,339
take this formula go take this formula

419
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:43,139
there's a little bit of echinace in

420
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:45,600
there there's a little bit of Goldenseal

421
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:47,459
and they still get sick and they're

422
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,740
still running to get antibiotics for

423
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:52,380
their their UTI they're still running to

424
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:53,940
get antibiotics for their stye for their

425
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:55,500
chronic sinusitis for their lung

426
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:56,699
infection for their bronchitis they're

427
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,279
still running

428
00:16:56,699 --> 00:17:00,440
to have to get the antibiotics because

429
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:03,000
they're taking

430
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:05,939
weak formulas

431
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:09,600
okay Goldenseal is a powerful medical

432
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:11,400
medium tool because and I can say that

433
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,880
because of the way

434
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:16,620
it's supposed to be used right if you

435
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:20,000
look and cleanse the heel there's a

436
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:25,079
strep throat section five dropper holes

437
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:27,720
twice a day in the strep throat section

438
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:30,660
any family member or friend that

439
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,460
contacts me that says aw I got a sore

440
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:35,100
throat coming on whether it's strep

441
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:37,919
throat or a cold or whatever it is

442
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:39,059
I'm like hit the strep throat section in

443
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,900
here

444
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:45,419
and take that Goldenseal therapeutically

445
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,799
therapeutically it's critical to take it

446
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:49,380
therapeutically that's the difference

447
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:51,179
right there okay because I've watched

448
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:53,220
for years talked to hundreds of doctors

449
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:54,960
over the last 30 years I've watched all

450
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:57,960
kinds of different formulas made out

451
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:01,620
there and it's usually some bad alcohol

452
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:03,620
written natural flavor ridden citric

453
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:07,380
acid ridden

454
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:10,640
formula with a drug no one realizes it a

455
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:13,740
drop of low quality

456
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,720
Goldenseal in it oh this formula looks

457
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:17,580
good oh I'm in the store right now I'm

458
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,200

461
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,380

away good luck if something's got to get

466
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:39,000
done it has to be done right so what I

467
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:41,940
like to use Golden sealed how I like to

468
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,380

469
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:45,840
when it comes down to your immune system

470
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:48,120
and immune system issues and building up

471
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:51,080

500
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:11,700
to take it I don't need to take it I

501
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,280

00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:09,539
their thing mm info

553
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:11,039
was for the people that had enough and

554
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:13,020
they're like you know what

555
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,880
I've already been to 10 doctors I've

556
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:16,679
already been to three neurologists I've

557
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,299
already had the MRIs in the CAT scans

558
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:19,460
I've already had more blood taken from

559
00:22:18,299 --> 00:22:22,080
me than

560
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:24,059
than anybody I've ever known I've

561
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,980
already done all this

562
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:27,720
and I heard about medical medium I've

563
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:29,520
been I've been not wanting to do it but

564
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:32,039
I finally got his books and I realized

565
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:34,080
it makes sense I've never heard this

566
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:36,539

567
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,460
and now I'm healing and that's what mm

568
00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:40,559

569
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:43,140
people coming into my office for over 35

570
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:45,659
years after they've traveled around the

571
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:47,520
world and had the best access to the

572
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:49,440

medical medium dorm being like we are

576
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:58,799
desperate we don't usually talk to

578
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:03,419
to get our information but right now

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:27,059

therapeutically that's the difference

606
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,960
right there and that's what you don't

607
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,820
hear all these years from the naturopath

608
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,620
from the holistic doctor from the

609
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:18,600
acupuncturist from God bless them all

610
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:20,159
but you don't hear this stuff you might

611
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,960
hear from somebody you should try to be

612
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,279
on an immune system formula I saw it at

613
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,440
Whole Foods I saw it at the health food

614
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:27,120
store here here's the brand and it's got

615
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,880
this in it it's got this in it it's got

616
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:31,980
this in it good luck good luck because

617
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:34,440
it's got that much gold and seal it's

618
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:36,900
got no zinc in it it's got that much

619
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:38,700
Goldenseal if you're lucky in the whole

620
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:40,860
formula mixed with a whole bunch of

621
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:43,080
other stuff and that's why people they

622
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:45,299
stay lost and they don't know where to

623
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:46,919
go and it's sad

624
00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:48,960
so anyway we're talking about Goldenseal

625
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:52,980
that's the Bemidji golden seal and when

626
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:55,620
you have a powerful version of it

627
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:56,940
it takes it to a whole new level and

628
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,740
that's what's incredible you guys this

629
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:01,200

630
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:03,600

631
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,120
it does it gets them out of trouble and

632
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:08,520
that's what's amazing about it okay so

633
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,779
go through another immune system builder

634
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:12,659

putting out cat's claw out there all

640
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:27,480

644
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:36,960
around the world right but me

645
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:38,220
I'll use cat's call for friends and

646
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,080
family

647
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:43,140
if they got something cooking that's

656
00:25:57,179 --> 00:26:03,419
Taylor Rain I suffered from Interstitial

that's how it happens with medical

663
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:21,659
medium information it's people been

664
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:24,120
through a lot and they've seen a lot of

665
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:25,559
people throughout the years someone just

the medical medium guy

669
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,159
um he hears his information from above

670
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:37,440

671
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:38,640

that's only stuff but really it's the

676
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:49,440
majority of people have to just I guess

677
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:51,539

678
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,220
and you got to go to your doctor you

679
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:54,960

doctor ask your doctor about them

684
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:04,919

685
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:07,200
giving you a little recap real quick so

686
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:08,820
vitamin C shock therapy with the microcl

687
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:12,120
showing you guys there's two capsules

688
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:14,159
every two hours every waking two hours

689
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,960
got a family member that woke up in the

690
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:17,039
middle of the night and they were up for

691
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:20,159
a few minutes

692
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:21,960
right they texted me I happened to be up

693
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:24,000
I was working on the book I said do it

694
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,380
again I said yeah but I did it all day I

695
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,360
said do it again

696
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:29,700
in the middle of the night get the two

697
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:32,460
capsules out and do it again you're up

698
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:34,260
you're awake do it again they did it

699
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:37,260
went back to sleep they got that extra

700
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:39,299
one in it's important so it's an

701
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:40,860
incredible information talk about zinc

702
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:45,779
shock therapy

703
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:47,880
zinc shuts down bugs shuts it down bugs

704
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:49,140
are allergic to zinc something you'll

705
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:51,480
never hear out there

706
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:54,179
it's mm info bugs are allergic they're

707
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:56,940
sensitive to zinc zinc destroys bugs

708
00:27:54,179 --> 00:27:59,700
pushes bugs back so it's not just about

709
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:01,260
zinc actually restoring your immune

710
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:03,299
system which it feeds your immune cells

711
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:06,360
that's what it does but it slows down

712
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:08,820
the bugs they get docile

713
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:10,919
they actually get docile so when you got

714
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:13,080
that cold or flu family or whatever bug

715
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:14,159
that's out there swimming around and

716
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:16,080
everybody's worried about you got these

717
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,700
different bugs you hear something going

718
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,919
around some kind of tummy bug whatever

719
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:23,940
it is

720
00:28:18,919 --> 00:28:25,679
zinc slows it down and then it levels

721
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:28,440
out the immune system so it doesn't

722
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:30,779
overreact or under react

723
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,460
see how important that is really really

724
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:34,620
important

725
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:36,179
all right so let's talk about some other

726
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:38,460
stuff let's

727
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:41,399
talk about metals

728
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:43,620
you guys got anxiety

729
00:28:41,399 --> 00:28:45,960

730
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:48,299

that's the metals talking the metals can

777
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:54,899
literally reshape and change someone's

778
00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:57,659
life in a way they don't want

779
00:30:54,899 --> 00:31:00,600
metals can even speak for you when you

780
00:30:57,659 --> 00:31:03,659
don't even want to speak metals can

781
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:05,640
control us and create this mind control

782
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:07,320
over us

783
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:09,659
do anybody who wants to be depressed

784
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:11,700

the medals can make people suicidal

791
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:26,880
one thing I don't like about toxic heavy

792
00:31:24,899 --> 00:31:29,100
metals is it breaks down the immune

793
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:31,320
system

794
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:34,559
we got enough breaking down our immune

795
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:36,840
systems you guys we have enough

796
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:39,779
we got hardships we got the adrenaline

797
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:41,940

798
00:31:39,779 --> 00:31:43,679
got all kinds of crap on our plate we

799
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:45,600
got enough struggles we got enough

800
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:47,340
issues and problems with all kinds of

801
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,260
people throughout our lives we get

802
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:50,820
enough stress when we're driving a car

803
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:53,039
we get enough stress when we're

804
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:55,320
registering a car we get enough stress

805
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:58,080
in general and then

806
00:31:55,320 --> 00:32:00,539
we get these outside sources we get the

807
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:02,220
metals toxic heavy metals and then we

808
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:03,419
get the bugs and then we're all of a

809
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,860

811
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:09,360
got more metals and guess what

812
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:11,220
it starts to break down the immune

813
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:13,200
system so it isn't just everything else

814
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:15,059
out there it's the metals that break

815
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,880

okay

895
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:21,060
so let's talk about OCD for a couple of

896
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:23,640
seconds too we're making the heavy metal

897
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:25,380
detox smoothie right we got the wild

898
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:26,400
blueberries in here a couple bananas in

899
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:28,619
there

900
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:31,200
we're going to talk about OCD for a

901
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:33,780
second this is fun

902
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,880
it's not fun if you have OCD

903
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:37,920
breaks my heart so many people suffering

904
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:39,300
to a degree with it it's just it's just

905
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,900
brutal

906
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:46,260
beware though okay

907
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:47,940
they're changing OCD around where

908
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:50,220
anybody who has anything they'll say

909
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:51,420
it's OCD now though it's really sad what

910
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:54,060
they're doing out there and I have to

911
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:55,260
talk about that okay because what

912
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:56,820
they're doing is they're saying if

913
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:58,859
someone's even anxious they're saying

914
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:00,900
that's OCD it's like no they're they're

915
00:35:58,859 --> 00:36:03,420
anxious well see these are different

916
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:05,820
kind of thing so if you'll see this

917
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:08,160
pencils pencil is a neuron so that's a

918
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:10,619
neuron inside your brain right neurons

919
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:13,500
inside your brain okay

920
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:14,760
that's your head that's half a brain

921
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:17,579
right there

922
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:20,520
that's a neuron this pencil

923
00:36:17,579 --> 00:36:24,240
that's metal

924
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:28,140
that metal is in the middle of a neuron

925
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:30,900
okay now electricity goes to the neuron

926
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:32,460
and it travels down the neuron when you

927
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:34,020
think of thought so when you're thinking

928
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:35,940
of thought like hey

929
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:37,800
this is what I'm going to do today I'm

930
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:39,599
going to make this my best day this is

931
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,460
going to be a good day I'm going to do

932
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:43,320
some cool stuff I'm thinking of thought

933
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:45,839
right now

934
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:47,040
and then all of a sudden some thoughts

935
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:49,440
you don't want to think you start

936
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:51,660
circulating right it's a vicious cycle

937
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,480
that's happening and you're in stuck in

938
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:56,880
this OCD land okay what's happening is

939
00:36:54,480 --> 00:37:00,660
electricity is going down the neuron

940
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:02,599
and then it's hitting a piece of metal

941
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:05,220
on the neuron

942
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:07,140
microscopic piece of metal but it's

943
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:09,060
hitting it on the neuron

944
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:12,060
then

945
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:13,440
it's going back the other way when it's

946
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:15,780
not supposed to

947
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,820
at the same time you're thinking a

948
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:19,980
thought another electrical impulse

949
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:22,980
electricity is going down the neuron

950
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:24,720
while that other electrical impulse is

951
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:26,760
coming back

952
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:29,280
they meet right here

953
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:31,680
and then they explode

954
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:35,940
that's OCD right there

955
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:38,460
just so you know metal can change your

956
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:41,460
life the direction of your life

957
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:44,160
it can change how you live your life it

958
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:46,619
can wreak nothing but Havoc I love

959
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:48,839
getting metal out of people's heads

960
00:37:46,619 --> 00:37:52,260
important this is this is Advanced

961
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:55,859
Medical medium information okay

962
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:59,160
I love getting Metals out of everyone's

963
00:37:55,859 --> 00:38:01,020
brain really important our brain gets

964
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,280
saturated with metal

965
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:04,560
okay

966
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:06,660
wears down her immune system and it

967
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,400
breaks us down so here we are we're

968
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:10,680
struggling with our OCD and we're

969
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,359
getting really upset

970
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:14,579
we're getting upset

971
00:38:12,359 --> 00:38:17,820
it's exhausting us

972
00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:20,400
we're wearing down our adrenals

973
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:22,800
when we have bipolar we're getting upset

974
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,420
we're exhausting ourselves and we're

975
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,400
wearing down our adrenals when we have

976
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:28,260
crippling anxiety we're getting upset

977
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,180
we're exhausting ourselves and we're

978
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:33,200
wearing down our adrenals and our immune

979
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:33,200
system starts to break down

980
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:38,180
Metals break down our immune systems

981
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,680
very important to know okay

982
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,839
let's talk about me

983
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,700
it makes Incredible tool that has

984
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:49,920
changed lives

985
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:52,740
I'm recapping on the smoothie for a bit

986
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:56,460
we got bananas we got two cups of Frozen

987
00:38:52,740 --> 00:39:00,480
wild blueberries right we got that let's

988
00:38:56,460 --> 00:39:00,480
go into the next one cilantro

989
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:07,440
cilantro by itself

990
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:10,380
can get some metals out some

991
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:12,480
but when it's mixed with the other key

992
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:15,300
ingredients something happens that

993
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,560
changes everything

994
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:20,119
so

995
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:20,119
put some cilantro in there

996
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:26,280
we got that now

997
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,320
what I like to do is you guys know about

998
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:30,000
the wild blueberry juice okay

999
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,980
and I told you I am working with these

1000
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,480
guys all right because I don't I don't I

1001
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:35,520
don't want this to disappear out there

1002
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:37,200
because it's that incredible so that's

1003
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:41,160
the Wyman's wild blueberry juice right

1004
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:43,800
they pressed the wild blueberries into a

1005
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:45,480
potent form so what I do is I put the

1006
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:47,940
wild blueberries in there

1007
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:50,880
but I do a shot

1008
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:54,000
of that blueberry juice

1009
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:57,020
I just can't help myself right I'll do a

1010
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,020
shot of that you know

1011
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:03,119
that's incredible stuff

1012
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:04,380
if you don't have the wild blueberries

1013
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:05,880
then you got the wild blueberry just use

1014
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:07,200
the wild blueberry juice don't have the

1015
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:09,780
wild blueberries

1016
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:14,220
then I'll do the vermergy

1017
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:16,020
wild blueberry powder if you can't get

1018
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:18,240
the Frozen wild blueberries

1019
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:20,700
do the wild blueberry powder right so

1020
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:22,319
I'll put some of that in there

1021
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:24,480
in there too

1022
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:26,220
the amount of anthocyanins we're talking

1023
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,859
about right here like we're talking

1024
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:30,660
about medicine now now we're in

1025
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:31,859
medicinal

1026
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:33,359
you know I love when I hear out there

1027
00:40:31,859 --> 00:40:34,380
people are like well that's medicinal it

1028
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:36,119
is

1029
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:37,079
I'm scratching my head because what

1030
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:38,520
you're showing me over there ain't

1031
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:40,380
medicinal

1032
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:42,119
I see it all time out there it's like no

1033
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,900
no this is Madison I'm like oh really it

1034
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:44,520
is

1035
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:46,079
this chocolate's medicinal I'm like

1036
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:47,460
really because chocolate has caffeine in

1037
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:49,260
it and it breaks down your adrenals and

1038
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:50,460
lowers your immune system how is

1039
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:51,960
chocolate medicinal when breaks your

1040
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:54,359
immune

1041
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:56,339
I want to know his apple cider vinegar

1042
00:40:54,359 --> 00:40:57,900
is medicinal over here oh it is because

1043
00:40:56,339 --> 00:40:59,819
guess what you won't have teeth left

1044
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:01,680
when you're older because that apple

1045
00:40:59,819 --> 00:41:04,079
cider vinegar will dissolve your teeth

1046
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,700
from the inside out

1047
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,900
and how good is that going to be for

1048
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:09,480
your immune system when you have no

1049
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:11,160
teeth left down the road right

1050
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,720
it's important to know like I hear it

1051
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:14,579
all the time well that's medicinal oh it

1052
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,020
is because I'm scratching my head over

1053
00:41:14,579 --> 00:41:17,460
here a little bit because that apple

1054
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:18,839
cider vinegar is going to dissolve your

1055
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:21,619
teeth I call it the teeth dissolver

1056
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:21,619
because that's what it is

1057
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:28,260
it's like okay anyway this is medicinal

1058
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:29,540
that's what we're talking about here so

1059
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:33,300
we got

1060
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:34,040
the cilantro in here we got the

1061
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:38,839
um

1062
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:38,839
blueberries so now

1063
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:44,940
we're talking about spirulina okay

1064
00:41:42,839 --> 00:41:46,980
I put one cup roughly one cup of

1065
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:49,440
cilantro in there by the way okay now

1066
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:51,960
we're talking about this uh the

1067
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:55,859
spirulina now Okay so

1068
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:57,540
spirulina gets Nettles out remember this

1069
00:41:55,859 --> 00:41:58,920
you can make a rhyme out of it if you

1070
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:01,859
want

1071
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:04,200
spirulina gets Metals out

1072
00:42:01,859 --> 00:42:07,560
Chlorella

1073
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:08,819
doesn't I know that doesn't rhyme

1074
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:11,359
but

1075
00:42:08,819 --> 00:42:16,140
it's something to remember chlorella

1076
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:18,060
doesn't get Metals out spirulina gets

1077
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:19,020
Metals out it's so important to know you

1078
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:21,240
know why

1079
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:23,579
is I can tell you now

1080
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:26,280
and you'll know now

1081
00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:27,420
but then you'll see out there a lot of

1082
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,280
people don't

1083
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:31,740
and you'll see they're like gorilla

1084
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:34,440
chlorella that does it chlorella I'll

1085
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:37,680
give you a little hint or a little

1086
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:40,079
talk about chlorella I've seen it

1087
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:43,619
almost killed children

1088
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:45,359
because it's so Russian roulette with

1089
00:42:43,619 --> 00:42:47,220
bad bacteria

1090
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:50,760
that's number one

1091
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:53,220
I've seen people react from chlorella to

1092
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:54,420
an allergic reaction where their throat

1093
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:56,640
closes up

1094
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:58,980
and they almost die

1095
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:00,780
I've seen that for 30 plus years

1096
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:04,020
I've seen

1097
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:06,660
people throw their guts out

1098
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:09,780
on their bathroom floor for weeks at a

1099
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:10,859
time until almost dying because of

1100
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:12,720
Chlorella

1101
00:43:10,859 --> 00:43:15,480
that I've seen

1102
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:17,520
but I've never seen chlorella fix

1103
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:19,680
somebody's bipolar fix somebody's

1104
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:21,060
depression fix somebody's OCD fix

1105
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,980
somebody's depersonalization if

1106
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:24,359
somebody's crippling anxiety fix

1107
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:26,579
anything

1108
00:43:24,359 --> 00:43:28,200
that I haven't see

1109
00:43:26,579 --> 00:43:31,260
that's the difference

1110
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:34,020
and it doesn't remove metals very

1111
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:36,060
important to know so I like a good

1112
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:37,619
quality spirulina it's the best one on

1113
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:39,540
the market

1114
00:43:37,619 --> 00:43:41,400
putting a teaspoon in there that's the

1115
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:43,440
Bemidji one right

1116
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,700
that's the best one there is if you just

1117
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:47,700
got on here and you're wondering if I'm

1118
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:50,300
trying to sell Subs I'm not sponsored by

1119
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:50,300

barley grass juice powder now this is

1122
00:43:56,819 --> 00:44:01,740
important to know

1123
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:03,660
not barley grass

1124
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:06,660
not barley grass

1125
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:09,000
barley grass juice powder I put a

1126
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:12,359
teaspoon in there it's the specific

1127
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:14,520
blend that gets the metals out

1128
00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:16,440
in the medical medium heavy metal detox

1129
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:18,960
smoothie it's the barley grass juice

1130
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:20,900
powder the spirulina

1131
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:24,300
it's the cilantro

1132
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:26,579
it's the wild blueberry

1133
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:29,520
right and then

1134
00:44:26,579 --> 00:44:31,980
it's the dolls now today I got the dose

1135
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:33,540
liquid right so that's the Bemidji dose

1136
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:35,700
liquid which is incredible so I'm

1137
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:37,079
popping that in

1138
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:38,220
I don't know if you had a chance to

1139
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:40,980
check that out but this stuff is

1140
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:43,920
incredible it's absolutely amazing so I

1141
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:47,160
just threw a shot of that in there

1142
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:50,700
um so the memory dose right

1143
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:54,180
liquid so right now I have

1144
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:56,640
the power five in here

1145
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:58,440
the power five I still got one more

1146
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:00,780
thing to put in

1147
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:02,579
but I got the spirulina I got the barley

1148
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:05,819
grass juice powder I got the wild

1149
00:45:02,579 --> 00:45:08,280
blueberry I got the cilantro and what's

1150
00:45:05,819 --> 00:45:10,200
the fifth I got the dolls in there now

1151
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:12,000
got the five

1152
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:15,920
right

1153
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,920
then orange goes in

1154
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,880
so put some orange in there squeeze in a

1155
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,440
little bit of that if you got an orange

1156
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:25,260
and that doesn't have a lot of juice you

1157
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:28,859
can put two orange squeezes in you know

1158
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:30,660
you can also peel the orange and put the

1159
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:32,520
r a whole orange and a lot of people do

1160
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:33,960
that it's perfectly fine so just want to

1161
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:35,940
answer that question because I know

1162
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:37,859
everybody

1163
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:40,619
Chris you seem fine to me

1164
00:45:37,859 --> 00:45:42,180
power five right

1165
00:45:40,619 --> 00:45:43,800
so I'm putting a little these are small

1166
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:46,020
oranges I'm just squeezing a little

1167
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:49,099
extra Orange in here this is what I'm

1168
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:49,099
doing there we go

1169
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:57,420
now

1170
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:59,160
when it comes down to immune systems you

1171
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:01,740
know what I like

1172
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:04,380
I like what works

1173
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:05,760
there is so much misinformation about

1174
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:07,859
the immune system and what works and

1175
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,180
what doesn't out there

1176
00:46:07,859 --> 00:46:13,020
it's

1177
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:14,760
even contagious that misinformation

1178
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:16,980
I like things that have a track record

1179
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:18,480
of working I like things that have a

1180
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:20,220
history of working

1181
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,780
I like things that have a history of

1182
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:23,819
saving people's lives

1183
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:26,280
I like things that have a real history

1184
00:46:23,819 --> 00:46:29,060
in changing so many lives it's

1185
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:29,060
indisputable

1186
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:34,680
and that's what I like for the immune

1187
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:37,160
system

1188
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:37,160
okay

1189
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:42,480
I got this rigged up right now I'm gonna

1190
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:45,859
turn this on

1191
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,859
my hand over it

1192
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:49,400
so let me escape

1193
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:53,099
foreign

1194
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:07,140
we're at a place in time in history

1195
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:11,599
where immune systems are under assault

1196
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:11,599
and under attack like never before

1197
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:17,339
keep that in mind

1198
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:19,980
that's where we are right now we're at a

1199
00:47:17,339 --> 00:47:22,680
place in time where our immune systems

1200
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:27,500
are just under assault I got a cup right

1201
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:27,500
here so I'm all set gonna pop this in

1202
00:47:28,619 --> 00:47:30,800
foreign

1203
00:47:33,079 --> 00:47:37,619
there's more actually than than what's

1204
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,540
in this glass right here so I just

1205
00:47:37,619 --> 00:47:41,400
filled it up to the top

1206
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:43,380
with that

1207
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:45,540
the medical medium heavy metal detox

1208
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:48,059
smoothie right there

1209
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:49,740
a little recap on what's Happening Here

1210
00:47:48,059 --> 00:47:51,780
and I still have one more tool to show

1211
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:53,280

Facebook we're live on Tick Tock we're

00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:08,760
live on that as well

1218
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:10,920
I want to talk about some things that

1219
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:12,660
break down our immune system

1220
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:15,660
this is going to be one of the most

1221
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:17,579
important things you take from today

1222
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:20,339
even if you're somebody that doesn't

1223
00:48:17,579 --> 00:48:23,280
have the medical medium tools

1224
00:48:20,339 --> 00:48:26,160
this is important okay

1225
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:28,500
you want to definitely listen to this

1226
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:32,119
right

1227
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:32,119
what's happening right now

1228
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:39,300
is people are getting taken advantage of

1229
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:41,040
they go get their blood tests and too

1230
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:44,599
much blood is drawn

1231
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,599
when too much blood is drawn

1232
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:52,680
they lose their CBC

1233
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:54,900
they lose their white blood count

1234
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:57,300
is what they lose

1235
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:59,960
very important their white blood count

1236
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:03,180
to kill ourselves their immune system

1237
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:05,819
your immune system parols

1238
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:07,920
your entire body

1239
00:49:05,819 --> 00:49:10,200
protecting you so that you don't get

1240
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:12,059
brain infections see that you don't get

1241
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:13,800
other infections so that you stay

1242
00:49:12,059 --> 00:49:16,559
healthy

1243
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:19,140
the majority of your immune system

1244
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:22,559
is circulating throughout your blood and

1245
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:24,059
blood vessels and organs and glands

1246
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:26,280
important to know

1247
00:49:24,059 --> 00:49:27,960
and what happens is when you get too

1248
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:31,079
much blood removed

1249
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:32,940
they remove it a portion of your immune

1250
00:49:31,079 --> 00:49:35,180
system so you're now more susceptible to

1251
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:38,160
getting the flu the cold the UTIs

1252
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:39,420
conjunctivitis the bronchitis and

1253
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:41,700
anything else that you're dealing with

1254
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:43,339
including sending you backwards into

1255
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:46,380
chronic

1256
00:49:43,339 --> 00:49:47,400
mcfs lupus neurological lime or anything

1257
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:49,559
else

1258
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,819
people already have low immune systems

1259
00:49:49,559 --> 00:49:53,099
that's why they're sick to begin with

1260
00:49:50,819 --> 00:49:54,660
and then they get more blood drawn and

1261
00:49:53,099 --> 00:49:56,280
then they get sicker and then they get

1262
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:58,200
more blood drawn because they got sicker

1263
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:59,700
and no one's picking this off this is

1264
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:01,020
something that's critical and then as

1265
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:02,760
they get sicker they get more blood

1266
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:04,079
drawn and then they get sicker more

1267
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:06,780
blood drawn

1268
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:09,420
see the Vicious Cycle

1269
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:11,520
do you know why so many people died of

1270
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:14,760
neurological Lyme in the last 40 years

1271
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:16,380
they were bled to death

1272
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:19,500
by their doctors

1273
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:21,480
but the medical industry 27 vials 25

1274
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:23,040
vials another 14 vials with a specialist

1275
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:24,300
another 10 vials with another specialist

1276
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:26,099
another doctor pulling another seven

1277
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:28,619
vials another doctor pulling 40 vials

1278
00:50:26,099 --> 00:50:31,760
another doctor pulling 30 vials

1279
00:50:28,619 --> 00:50:31,760
and they lost your life

1280
00:50:32,339 --> 00:50:34,920
happens with a lot of people with cancer

1281
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:36,780
too

1282
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:38,760
you get sicker they pull more blood

1283
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:40,920
sicker they pull more blood sicker they

1284
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:42,300
pull more blood I'm saying this because

1285
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:43,800
if you want to protect your immune

1286
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:45,119
system going on into where we're heading

1287
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:48,380

1307
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:31,800
in what they say out there that you have

1308
00:51:29,579 --> 00:51:33,540
to pay for it in order to honor respect

1309
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:35,640
it and appreciate it I don't believe

1310
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:38,640
that that's that's basically talking

1311
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:40,440
stupid to people people aren't like that

1312
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:43,079
I believe people know when they're

1313
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:45,359
getting something that's incredibly and

1314
00:51:43,079 --> 00:51:46,800
powerful and for free and they know and

1315
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:49,440
they appreciate it and I know you guys

1316
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:51,839

1318
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:56,400
bit

1319
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:58,880
they only need to take this much blood

1320
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,880
right

1321
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:06,660
that that much blood

1322

to run your A1C and a a a a nutritional

1323
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:11,460
panel a thyroid panel

1324
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:14,160
you see what I'm saying they can find a

1325
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:16,559
speck of blood on someone's pair of

1326
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:19,740
jeans that was in a shallow grave 40

1327
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:23,160
years ago from a murder scene

1328
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:25,440
make a serum out of it

1329
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:28,460
and get more information from it than

1330
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,460
you can possibly imagine

1331
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:34,140
think about that

1332
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:35,819
but they will bleed you to death and

1333
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:38,640
lower your immune system this is an

too

1337
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:48,059
not just build it not just get it strong

1338
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:49,200
not just fight bugs and fight problems

1339
00:52:48,059 --> 00:52:50,940
that I've been talking about all the

1340
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:53,220
different conditions this is about

1341
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:55,319
getting Metals out building up your

1342
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:56,760

sustaining and protecting your immune

1348
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:11,700
system I believe in blood tests I

1349
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:14,280
believe in going to your doctor

1350
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:15,839
but I believe in doing it right and

1351
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:18,059
careful

1352
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:19,800
because they've been trained to please

1353
00:53:18,059 --> 00:53:21,720
you to death

1354
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:23,280
and that's why half the people with

1355
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:25,980
neurological line in the last 40 years

1356
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:28,020
lost their lives and died that's why

1357
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:29,400
many people with multiple sclerosis lost

1358
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:31,800
their lives and died throughout the

1359
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:33,180
years that's why many people with ALS

1360
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:34,859
lost their lives and died many years

1361
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:36,359
that's why people with Hashimoto's got

1362
00:53:34,859 --> 00:53:38,339
worse until they got worse until they

1363
00:53:36,359 --> 00:53:40,200
got worse that's why everybody gets

1364
00:53:38,339 --> 00:53:42,300
sicker they've had their immune system

1365
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:43,500

have the fresh thyme

1432
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:49,020
if there's nothing

1433
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:52,040
you take from these lives right here

1434
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:52,040

00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:56,880
I'm proud of you okay

1436
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:59,220

1439
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:04,799

1440
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:07,440
one step at a time if you need to that's

1441
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:11,180
okay all right so let's talk about time

1442
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:14,940
for a little bit it's the

1443
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:17,520
repeller of bugs

1444
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:19,440
so

1445
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:21,180
you got the bugs going around you got

1446
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:22,500
the flu viruses you got the cold viruses

1447
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:23,700
you got the plague viruses you got all

1448
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:25,020
the bugs going around everything's

1449
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:29,000
floating around

1450
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:29,000
and when you have this in your system

1451
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:35,460
you're helping to repel and destroy

1452
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:36,420
those bugs these bugs are allergic to

1453
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:38,700
time

1454
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:41,579
phytochemical compounds in time are

1455
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:44,220
antiviral and antibacterial so time has

1456
00:57:41,579 --> 00:57:45,720
antiviral antibacterial compounds

1457
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:48,420
keep that in mind

1458
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:50,760
you put this inside your body and the

1459
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:52,440
bugs that keep everybody sick and all

1460
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:55,880
you guys sick

1461
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:55,880
don't like time

1462
00:57:56,579 --> 00:58:02,760
they don't like time

1463
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:05,339
so time is an amazing tool it stays in

1464
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:07,140
the bloodstream longer

1465
00:58:05,339 --> 00:58:08,520
so when you have your time water every

1466
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:10,020
single day you're keeping the

1467
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:11,819
phytochemical compounds that are

1468
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:13,799
antiviral antibacterial you're keeping

1469
00:58:11,819 --> 00:58:15,660
them in your bloodstream longer and

1470
00:58:13,799 --> 00:58:17,760
longer and longer and you're keeping

1471
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:19,680
them there so then now you're creating a

1472
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:21,660
little bit of a shield a little bit of

1473
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:23,760
an extra protector so if you were gonna

1474
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:28,099
get sick you're gonna get sick way less

1475
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:28,099
than you would have gotten way worse

1476
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:35,339
keep that in mind

1477
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:39,180
because it was sitting there Fielding

1478
00:58:35,339 --> 00:58:43,200
your bloodstream keeping Invaders from

1479
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:44,700
exploding out of control

1480
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:46,200

1481
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:49,619
