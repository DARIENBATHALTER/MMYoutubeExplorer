sticking your credit card in there well

15
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,480
your pancreas is your credit card your

16
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,399
adrenals are your credit card your liver

17
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,960
is your credit card right

18
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:57,039
you can burn those babies out and

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,840
eventually that liver

20
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:02,800
that spleen that pancreas right just

21
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,199
says okay i'm done i'm done you maxed me

22
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,880

23
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,200
done and that's what happens all the

24
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,240
time so you have to understand that

25
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,720
so what we need to do is we need to now

26
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,880
figure out a way of getting savings into

27
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,280
your liver savings into your pancreas

28
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,680
savings into your kidney savings into

29
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,880
your adrenals this is how you do it

30
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,200
right here

so check this out okay

158
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,880
eggs are radical fat

159
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,720
they're high in fat people don't realize

160
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,240
that but they're high in fat

161
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,800
why do you think there was this fear

162
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,560
about eggs years ago where doctors

163
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,160
actually had it right

164
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,000
where if you eat too many eggs you're

165
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,520
basically going to have a heart stopping

166
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,880
effect and you're just going to die of a

167
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,319
heart disease or something like that

168
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,440
well they're still right about well they

169
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,039
don't believe that now because they

170
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,880
don't know what they believe

171
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,960
because you know propaganda just

172
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,720
switches gears every la every minute but

173
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,919
there was a one time where conventional

174
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,360
doctors

175
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,560
they were saying hey you got to worry

176
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,199
about eggs well guess what you still got

177
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,600
to worry about eggs that's a radical fat

178
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,919
and then that sausage right there

179
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,080
radical fat maybe you juice meatless

180
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:32,080
sausage you guys do meatless sausage

181
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,680
because those are filled with radical

182
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,720
fat too

183
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,479

184
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,080

185
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,319
right you got the pork right there

186
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,720
that's a radical fat

187
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,639
and then you got that lump of butter

188
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,160
right there

189
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,319
till this day

190
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,479
anybody that thinks butter in their

191
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,400
coffee is a good thing

192
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,680
they're just misled

193
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,840
and

194
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,160
whoever propelled that butter in your

195
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,319
coffee thing out there in the world is a

196
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,720
complete and an idiot and has led

197
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,960
people astray in a bad way

198
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,160
a real idiot that did the butter in the

199
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,199
coffee thing

200
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,840

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,000
name

204
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,560

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,919
lead people to heart surgeries artery

206
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,479
surgeries like with vein surgeries

207
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:26,080

radical fats stop the body from

265
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,040
cleansing when you eat them before noon

266
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,800
when you eat a radical fat before noon

267
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,480
your body does not cleanse that's it no

268
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,600
cleansing cleansing doesn't happen

269
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,080
whatsoever

270
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,080
what's another healthy fat peanut butter

271
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,920
is a healthy fat i've always said that

272
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,200
i've said that since i was like six

273
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,880
years old

274
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,680
that it's a healthy fat

275
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,959
six years old it's a healthy fat it is

276
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,560
spirit of compassion was saying yeah

277
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,959
that's a healthy fat

278
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,880
it is and guess what when i was six year

279
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,880
old six years old peanut butter wasn't

280
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,959
considered a healthy fat it was

281
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,279
considered a terrible

282
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,560
horrible fat that can kill your heart

283
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,519
did you know that

284
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,120
mainstream medicine believed peanut

285
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,440
butter

286
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,240
would kill you

287
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,480
back

288
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,959
when i was six years old

289
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,279
and at six years old spirit of

290
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:15,279
compassion would say no tell people it's

291
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,920
healthy but it's a healthy fat but you

292
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,600
don't want the healthy fats before noon

293
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,959
is what i'm trying to say

294
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,480
you don't want to do that here's a

295
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,920
healthy fat right now

296
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,920
in my hand

297
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:29,120
avocados

298
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,720
avocado toast save it till noon and

299
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,560
after if that's what you're going to eat

300
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,000
is a healthy fat

301
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,600
okay that's important power of

302
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,839
compassion said i used to eat high-fat

303
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,320
breakfast it totally destroyed me

304
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,160
the high-fat breakfast

305
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,079
definitely does some damage to people

306
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,399
especially if they got autoimmune eczema

307
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:48,160
psoriasis especially if they have lupus

308
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,800
multiple sclerosis any kind of condition

309
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:54,399
whatsoever including acne anything

310
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,680
vitiligo it's dermatitis

311
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,560
so

312
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:02,000
what you get when you keep on having

313
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:05,360

cleansing

347
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,200
and then we get in trouble and then we

348
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:25,120
get sick as time goes on rob said the

349
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,240
keto diet wrecked me

350
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,639
rob

351
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,040
the keto diet

352
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,200
killed the people years ago

353
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,279
they changed the keto diet now where it

354
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,600
still will wreck people the keto diet

355
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:40,320
will still wreck people

356
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,320
but they brought in fruits

357
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,720
they brought in vegetables

358
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,440
they brought in a few greens

359
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,399
they brought these things in right

360
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,800
and so

361
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:53,519
and and but the keto diet when you're

362
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,360
sick will still wreck and destroy but

363
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,040
people don't know that sure if you've

364
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,120
never been sick before and you go on a

365
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,680
keto diet a new keto diet of the day

366
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,160
which allows a green juice it allows

367
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,160
sugar it allows avocado right you go on

368
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,240
a new type of keto diet of the day right

369
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,399
now which isn't a keto diet but you go

370
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,680
on to the new keto diets you might get

371
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,800
some results you might get a little

372
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,240
weight loss because you got off of

373
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,880
processed foods but if you're really

374
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,880
sick it will just halt your healing and

375
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,720

have a cup of hot tea and put lemon in

470
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,680
it there's nothing wrong with that but

471
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:42,720

and kill it

478
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,600
so it doesn't flush your liver in the

479
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,000
morning

480
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,680

513
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,720
tip you guys very important

514

if the lime is green you can still use

515
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,240
it but it's not ripe but you can still

516
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:21,039
use it

517
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:24,160
you want the limes that have some color

518
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:25,120
to them the color changed so that's a

519
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,840
lime

520
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:30,720
you know tip right there okay

521
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:33,200
when you let the lime ripen or you find

522
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,039
that lime that's more ripe you'll get

523
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,559
more juice out of it so i'm going to

524
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,080

00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,240
if you're gonna drink whatever

562
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,320
if you're gonna have your tea your black

563
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,320
tea if you're gonna have your caffeine

564
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,640
in the morning

565
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:03,200
do the lemon water

566
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,520
before you poison yourself and your

567
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:08,000
liver remember that

568
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:10,400
do the lemon water 16 to 32 ounces to

569
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,880
flush out your liver before you shut

570
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,400
your liver down with caffeine and

571
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,320
adrenaline

572
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,200
keep that in mind right there

573
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,480
okay

574
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,159
and you can

575
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,679
you know you can take the caffeine out

576
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:24,320
in the morning that's a troublemaker you

577
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:26,080
can take out which is really great

578
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,600
but keep that in mind

579
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,400
flush the liver

580
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,400
before you poison it

581
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,840
really important and i talk about that

582
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,640
in the medical medium cleanse the heel

583
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,159
book so i mean look i can't stop anybody

584
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,159
from drinking their caffeine and this

585
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,039
isn't an anti-caffeine

586
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,480
you know

587
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:45,200
talk today

588
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,960
but i'm saying the details are in here

589
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,679
if you are going to drink the coffee

590
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,240
which people do every single day

591
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:55,520
then do that coffee

592
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:57,840
after you've flushed out that liver

593
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:00,880
important tory sue says could i juice my

594
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,799
lemons and freeze the juice in ice trays

595
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,360
so as to store them up if you have to

596
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:08,799
absolutely then put a cube in a glass to

597
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:10,400
dissolve it in the am uh yes you can

598
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,720
is it ideal

599
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:15,919
no but it's still doable that's doable

600
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,679
that's better than putting that lemon in

601
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:19,039
the hot water so i want to answer more

602
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,960
questions to you guys i want to be

603
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,559
really helpful i want to tell you how to

604
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,960

606
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,880
free okay

607
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,440
john morris hey

608
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,440
i don't think coffee is bad as long as

609
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,760
you don't add a lot of sweetener but i

610
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,280
agree you should flush the liver first

611
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,360
because the first thing you consume is

612
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,799
what your body takes in the most of well

613
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,960
first of all thanks for agreeing with

614
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:45,200
that flushing the liver first is great

615
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,360
i'm glad you don't think coffee is not

616
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,039
bad you know that's that's that's fine

617
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,120
i'm glad the caffeine companies taught

618
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,720
you that and i'm glad the caffeine

619
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,880
propaganda and the caffeine industry

620
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,120
taught you that too the coffee's not bad

621
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,400
and but i'm just going to tell you right

622
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,840
now

623
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:04,000
okay sure john john morris right i

624
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,799
respect what you say of course right

625
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,559
you're a guy but women's health suffers

626
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,400
from caffeine

627
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,440
women's health suffers greatly from

628
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,120
caffeine

629
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,640
i'm just going to let you know right now

630
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,400
women have to

631
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,200
birth children

632
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,880
and it takes adrenal strength to do that

633
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,360
a difficult birth

634
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,559
can happen for women because they toast

635
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,159
out their adrenals from all that

636
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,679
caffeine

637
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,960
so that's one thing important another

638
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,320
thing too

639
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,559
women are being thrown on these

640
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,720
intermittent fasting diets

641
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,960
and they run on caffeine and adrenaline

642
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,960
all day and eventually by the time

643
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,039
they're 40 they're burnt out they're

644
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,960
fried they can't think they got brain

645
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:45,600
frog

646
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,640
their adrenals are totally toasted

647
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,480
and

648
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,000
and what happens is they've also gone

649
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,600
through maybe one or two really

650
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,600
difficult births

651
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,720
and maybe you've even had c-sections

652
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,159
because of it the adrenals get burnt and

653
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,120
fried out

654
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:04,400
pain tolerance goes you know down really

655
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,919
fast and caffeine causes a lot of this

656
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,159
another thing that happens with women

657
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:10,159
too is your skin gets all choppy they

658
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:12,559
get all the they get all of the brown

659
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:15,120
spots all over their face that happens

660
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:16,080
all over their skin that's from caffeine

661
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,120
so

662
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,159
john i get it you think caffeine's fine

663
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:24,159
and

664
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:25,679
as a guy sure can drink the caffeine but

665
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,520
for women's health it's actually

666
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,520
terrible the caffeine industry knows

667
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:32,400
this behind the scenes

668
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:34,559
and their mantra is get pregnant women

669
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:37,120
on caffeine

670
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:38,880
so that their babies will be caffeine

671
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:41,279
addicts when they're born

672
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,480
and get pregnant women on caffeine so

673
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,880
their breast milk is filled with

674
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,279
caffeine so their babies are caffeine

675
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,679
addicts when they're breastfeeding and

676
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:52,400
this what this does is it ensures the

677
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:54,159
caffeine industry banks and banks and

678
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,480
banks and banks

679
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,360
and never stops banking

680
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,520
all right

681
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,120
enough on the caffeine talk as we go

682
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:04,480

742
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,400
different if you need to

743
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,799
if you have an old blender take your

00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:09,679

00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:11,110
it

747
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,480
right

748
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:14,960
[Music]

749
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,720
so we're going to do

750
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,840
is i'm going to run some celery through

751
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,720
here

752
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:22,400
now if you're somebody that's sensitive

753
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,559
okay

754
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:29,120
somebody that's sensitive

755
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:31,440
you can do less four ounces two ounces

756
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,679
if you're somebody that's sensitive do

757
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,120
less celery juice

758
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:37,200
all right

759
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,039
and that's perfectly fine if you're

760
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,600
somebody that's sensitive in this

761
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:44,720
situation where your blood is thick and

762
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:48,000
dirty you've never cleansed before

763
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:50,159
you're eating radical fats all the time

764
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,559
you're highly toxic

765
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,880
you've got pathogens but don't even know

766
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:57,360
it you got streptococcus in your

767
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,640
intestinal tract you don't even know it

768
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,120
right

769
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:04,159
and you got symptoms conditions you have

770
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:07,279
no idea what they're from

771
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:08,960
they're from pathogens and toxins

772
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,880
so if you're somebody that's highly

773
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,120
toxic and you're doing the medical

774
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:16,720
medium morning cleanse you don't have to

775
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:18,640
do 16 to 32 ounces of celery juice you

776
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,640
can start out with four ounces you can

777
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:23,360
start out with eight ounces

778
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:26,240
keep in mind you haven't had radical

779
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:29,919
fats yet kathleen has a question can you

780
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:31,520
use powdered celery juice no you cannot

781
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,520
i can't tell you what to do you have

782
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,520
your own free well you can do whatever

783
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,919
you want right of course

784
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:40,640
my recommendation is don't do it it

785
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:43,360
won't fix you it doesn't have the

786
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:46,159
ability to fix anybody it doesn't have

787
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:49,039
that healing ability it's dehydrated

788
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:51,760
it's lost what it needs to help heal

789
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:53,840
someone and clean somebody up keep that

790
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,120
in mind if you guys just came on here

791
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,360
we're doing the medical medium morning

792
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,840
cleanse challenge we're heading into the

793
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:02,640
section of juicing celery you can do

794
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:05,039
four ounces six ounces 8 ounces whatever

795
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:07,760
you would like you don't have to do 16

796
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:10,000
to 32 ounces i prefer 32 ounces that

797
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,880
would be fantastic

798
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,919
okay

799
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,480
so

800
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:16,240
the reason why some people get benefits

801
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,840
from intermittent fasting is because

802
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,760
they remove fats in the morning but they

803
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:22,799
don't know that's why

804
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:26,080
they actually don't know why

805
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:29,679
they're getting some type of result

806
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:32,640
it's because they're moving fats out of

807
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:34,159
their morning regime they're keeping the

808
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,159
fats out

809
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:39,039
and that's why

810
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:40,799
okay so it's important to know

811
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:43,760
but the problem with intermittent

812
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:44,640
fasting is you will burn your adrenals

813
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,279
out

814
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:50,480
with intermittent fasting because you

815
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:54,480
have to get trace mineral salts and you

816
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:56,559
have to get sugar in your bloodstream

817
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,120
if anybody's anti-sugar like

818
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:01,679
anti-glucose

819
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:04,000
then you're they're illey misinformed

820
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:06,159
because

821
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,480
what happens is if you don't get glucose

822
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,159
to your brain in the morning

823
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,880
you're starving your brain of what it

824
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:15,279
needs glucose is why we function

825
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:17,919
so the critical aspect of intermittent

826
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:20,559
fasting the critical aspect of it

827
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:22,720
working to some degree is you keep fats

828
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,760
out but you have to have something in

829
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,640
there

830
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:28,799
that actually feeds your brain

831
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,880
to keep that in mind

832
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:33,600
so when you remove

833
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:36,159
sugar from your morning you don't need a

834
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:39,440
piece of fruit you don't have lemon

835
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:41,919
water okay when you remove sugar from

836
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,720
your breakfast in the morning and you

837
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:45,120
just

838
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:47,600
intermittent fast you're you're now

839
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,880
running on adrenaline and caffeine if

840
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,520
you're somebody that's intermittent

841
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:54,240
fasting on caffeine right these are ways

842
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:56,880
that age you faster and they don't help

843
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,559
you cleanse

844
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,000
so right now we're making some celery

845
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:01,279
juice

846
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,840
if you're somebody that's doing the

847
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:05,679
medical medium morning cleanse challenge

848
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,200
and you had your celery juice already in

849
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,640
the morning hang on we're still going to

850
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,559
do some other stuff so this is going to

851
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,120
be fun okay

852
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:15,760
so right now i'm running some juice i'm

853
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:17,919
already past 8 10 ounces easy i'm

854
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,840
probably going into like 16 ounces easy

855
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:23,200
i'm going to go a little bit more too so

856
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:25,120
we'll run some more

857
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,200
this is the omega for the people asking

858
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:30,080
about the juicer right now the juicer

859
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,200
sale ends i think tomorrow this is the

860
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,240
omega

861
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,600
mm

862
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:37,919
900 hds so one that saves money you see

863
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,520
this right here this is coming out dry

864
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,960
just so you know you guys

865
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,640
i'm just showing you guys on tick tock

866
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,520
can you see that right there on the

867
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,080
screen

868
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:48,159
so that's coming out dry right

869
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,440
the reason why this pulp is dryer it's

870
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:51,279
this machine

871
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,360
and so you're saving money so you're

872
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:55,120
you're getting a lot more juice right

873
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,840

912
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:29,279

there you go

916
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,679
somebody asked me on tick tock just now

917
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:40,159
what do adrenals do

918
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:42,159
what do they do

919
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:43,840
if you're talking that's because of

920
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:46,880
adrenaline

921
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:47,919
if you're walking that's from adrenaline

922
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,919
right

923
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:51,279
anything you do did you take a shower

924
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:53,440
this morning

925
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:54,840
that's from your adrenals your adrenals

926
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,279
gave you that

927
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,799
blessing that's why people that they

928
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:00,080
lose their adrenals they can't get up

929
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:02,320
they can't shower

930
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:05,039
okay

931
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:07,440
adrenals do all of that for you right

932
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:09,360

1178
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:56,880
critical to go in here now the reason

why this works

1180
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,119

00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:02,800
of the blend of what's going in here

1182
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:06,160
keep that in mind

1183
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:07,280
the blueberry doesn't remove toxic heavy

1184
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:10,319
metals

1185
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,280
but the wild blueberry does

1186
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,400
that's

1187
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,720
right there

1188
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:17,040

the best one on the market

1202
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:50,160
when you use a high quality product like

1203
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:52,720
this it takes

1204
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:54,079
the removal of metals to an entirely

1205
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,599
different level and that's what i love

1206
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:59,359
about it so you put a teaspoon of that

1207
00:42:55,599 --> 00:43:01,520
spirulina in there

1208
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:04,079

little bit of wild blueberry juice now i

1259
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,720
do work with wyman's

1260
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:55,280
okay

1261
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:58,079
i do do work with them

1262
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:00,400
i endorse this product 100

1263
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:01,520
and i do work with them because what

1264
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,520
they do

1265
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,400
is they take the wild blueberry out of

1266
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,400
the field

1267
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:08,480
they harvest it out of the field right

1268
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:10,400
which is a process all on its own that's

1269
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,440
unbelievable because it's really hard to

1270
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,040
do

1271
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,560
and what they do is

1272
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:17,680
they press it

1273
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:20,400
okay so what this is right here is a

1274
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:22,640
wild blueberry juice

1275
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,720
okay that's pressed i never want this

1276
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,599
stuff to disappear in the world

1277
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,760
because

1278
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:29,520
it it's an unbelievable process to even

1279
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:32,000
make it happen and the antioxidant

1280
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:33,359
levels off the chart so what i do is i

1281
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,520

what

1509
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:53,599
you're still cleansing

1510
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:55,599
you're still cleansing

1511
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:59,280
i just put maple syrup on here you can

1512
00:53:55,599 --> 00:54:02,000

1513
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:03,520

1514
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,720
wild blueberries they're frozen wild

1515
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:08,160
blueberries

1516
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:09,599
i have them on top of that hot steamy

1517
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:11,280
millet

1518
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:13,920
gluten free

1519
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:16,079
i put a little bit of maple syrup on top

1520
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:19,200
and that's allowed in the medical medium

1521
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:19,200
morning cleanse challenge

1522
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:25,200
fats are what stops you

1523
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:29,520
from cleansing in the morning keep that

1524
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:32,000
in mind fats also block

1525
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:33,520
the sugar from entering your cells and

1526
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,880
you get insulin resistance in the

1527
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,640
morning everybody gets insulin

1528
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:39,359
resistance in the morning

1529
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:40,799
because they're on so many fats

1530
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,720
and they end up getting sugar in them at

1531
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:44,640
the same time mixing it so let's get

1532
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:46,480
some oatmeal going so here we go we got

1533
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:48,799
the pan ready

1534
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:50,720
the pot ready right here let's get a

1535
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:54,319
little bit of oatmeal in here

1536
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:57,359
so this is exciting okay

1537
00:54:54,319 --> 00:55:00,000
can you add oil free oat milk i wouldn't

1538
00:54:57,359 --> 00:55:03,040
because i don't think it's fat free oat

1539
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,880
milk oat milk gets pretty high in fat so

1540
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:07,280
you're pushing it on that one it's so

1541
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:09,920
concentrated that oatmeal so that

1542
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:12,079
oatmeal gets pretty high in fat keep

1543
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:15,119
that in mind right so i'm gonna pop some

1544
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:16,319
oatmeal in here that oh milk

1545
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:17,839
does

1546
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:21,359
oatmeal doesn't

1547
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:24,160
oatmeal is not high in fat okay

1548
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:26,799
it's not high in fat it's not an overt

1549
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:29,520
fat but when you concentrate that oat

1550
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:32,799
milk it almost crosses it does it

1551
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:34,400
crosses the line kind of into overt fat

1552
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:36,720
world is what it does

1553
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:38,559
and then over fat is it the radical fat

1554
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:39,839
world right and that's going to stop you

1555
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:42,960
from doing what you need to do so let's

1556
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:42,960
get some water in here

1557
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:47,359
right

1558
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:50,880
and i'll put a little bit more water in

1559
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:50,880
there we're cooking this right now

1560
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:54,160
you guys if you just got on here this is

1561
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:56,400
the medical medium morning cleanse

1562
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:58,880
challenge

1563
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,880
there we go

1564
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:04,000

1569
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:17,839
why does oak meal hurt my stomach makes

1570
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:17,839
me bloated i get dizzy eating it too

1571
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:22,319
here's how it works oatmeal is not a

1572
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:23,040
healing food

1573
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:25,280
so

1574
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:26,240
stephanie doyle oatmeal is not a healing

1575
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:28,880
food

1576
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:30,960
but it's not a food that feeds viruses

1577
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:33,359
and pathogens but if you've got other

1578
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:35,359
stuff going on other sensitivities and

1579
00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:37,680
other things going on it might not be

1580
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:40,000
the best option for you something else

1581
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:42,160
could be the best option for you see

1582
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,000
it whether it's millet becomes a better

1583
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:46,480
option whether it's steamed potatoes

1584
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,880
becomes a better option for you you see

1585
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:50,640
so steamed potatoes could actually be a

1586
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:52,880
good option right there for you keep

1587
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:56,400
that in mind it could be just bananas

1588
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:58,160
too also what do you put in your oatmeal

1589
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:00,240
that could be actually making you

1590
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:02,000
bloated getting you dizzy and hurting

1591
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:03,119
your stomach so keep in mind be your own

1592
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,799
detective

1593
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:06,799

there you're putting peanut butter in

1613

what's the purpose

1718
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:23,200
so that's something to keep in mind like

1719
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:27,119
why do we need to be doing it what's the

1720
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:28,480
point why do we have to do it

1721
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:30,400
and you can do so much with steamed

1722
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:32,240

1727
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:44,640
so the goal you guys

1728
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:44,640
is not to bombard

1729
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:49,440
your

1730
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:51,280
liver and organs with fat in the morning

1731
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:53,280
you want to be

1732
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:54,880
fat free is what you want i got the

1733
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:57,280
oatmeal just heating up and cooking

1734
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:59,359
right there you want to be fat free in

1735
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:01,680
the morning keep that in mind that's a

1736
01:01:59,359 --> 01:02:03,280
big way to cleanse

1737
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:06,400
if you have fats in the morning you

1738
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:08,480
can't cleanse so nothing cleanses just

1739
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:11,039
keep that in mind you want to stay

1740
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:13,119
hydrated in the morning so what happens

1741
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:15,440
is when you do your lemon water first

1742
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:17,200
thing in the morning 16 to 32 ounces and

1743
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:19,280
then you wait 15 to 30 minutes you do

1744
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:21,119
your celery juice 16 to 32 ounces of

1745
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:23,520
celery juice right and then you have

1746
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:25,760
your heavy metal detox smoothie

1747
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:27,359
if you want if that's one option or you

1748
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:29,280
don't need anything and you just want

1749
01:02:27,359 --> 01:02:32,160
you know an orange or something right

1750
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:34,720
that's something whatever it is

1751
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:36,160
you're allowing yourself to cleanse

1752
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:38,079
is what's happening you can drink

1753
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:40,079
coconut water sometime in the morning

1754
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:42,720

1755
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:43,760
ounces of coconut water 16x extra ounces

1756
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:45,520

1757
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:47,200

1864

quinoa

1866
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:47,440
the reason why quinoa is not a highly

1867
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:50,079
recommended medical medium food

1868
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:52,160
is because it's scratchy

1869
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:53,920
it's scratchy

1870
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:54,590
so many people come to medical medium

1871
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:55,680
information

1872
01:06:54,590 --> 01:06:56,559
[Music]

1873
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:59,599
to be

1874
01:06:56,559 --> 01:07:01,520
taken away from pain to come out and

1875
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:03,200
rise above their illness and symptom and

1876
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:05,920
condition

1877
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:07,359
quinoa is not a guarantee

1878
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:09,200
that's going to happen for somebody with

1879
01:07:07,359 --> 01:07:10,960
intestinal tract disorders

1880
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:12,680
it's scratchy

1881
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:14,559
people have diverticulitis

1882
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:16,559
diverticulosis right

1883
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:18,720
it's a different scratchy it's not like

1884
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:20,280
when you have some lettuce and you have

1885
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:22,319
diverticulitis that's good for

1886
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:24,559
diverticulitis right

1887
01:07:22,319 --> 01:07:28,079
it's not like that it's a different kind

1888
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:31,599
of abrasive scratch quinoa causes so

1889
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:34,400
when you have crohn's colitis ibs other

1890
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:36,559

1892
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:40,400
inflammation in the intestinal tract

1893
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:42,799
quinoa is not the best bet

1894
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:44,079
yeah i like quinoa it's not the best bet

1895
01:07:42,799 --> 01:07:45,680
though for somebody with all kinds of

1896
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:48,319
other conditions

1897
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:49,920
that's why it's not recommended very

1898
01:07:48,319 --> 01:07:51,760
important to know cold white spring good

1899
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:53,920
to see you may good to see you yeah it's

1900
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:54,720
because it's scratchy

1901
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:56,799
so

1902
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:58,559
so and people don't realize this so you

1903
01:07:56,799 --> 01:08:00,319
have somebody and they got all these

1904
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:01,920

sibo they got all these other conditions

1906
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:04,400
and they're still having problems and

1907
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:05,920
they don't know what the problem is

1908
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:07,680
they're just like oh my god i just went

1909
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:09,839
to the bathroom i don't know what's

1910
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:12,160
going on here and they don't realize it

1911
01:08:09,839 --> 01:08:14,720
but the quinoa is causing an aggravated

1912
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:16,799
issue inside it's not it's not that

1913
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:18,480
quinoa feeds bugs it doesn't quinoa

1914
01:08:16,799 --> 01:08:20,480
doesn't feed pathogens it doesn't feed

1915
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:22,000
epstein-barr it doesn't feed it doesn't

1916
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:23,920
feed streptococcus all the medical

1917
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,279
medium information about epsine bar and

1918
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:27,759
all those other different pathogens

1919
01:08:25,279 --> 01:08:30,319
right it doesn't feed those

1920
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:32,159
right oatmeal doesn't feed pathogens

1921
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:34,880
millet doesn't feed pathogens but what

1922
01:08:32,159 --> 01:08:38,880
you have to understand is the quinoa has

1923
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:41,600
a scratch to it then that scratchiness

1924
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:44,239
because quinoa doesn't break down

1925
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:46,400
and it goes through you like sandpaper

1926
01:08:44,239 --> 01:08:47,839
and that's why it's not recommended but

1927
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:50,560
but but yet

1928
01:08:47,839 --> 01:08:52,400
i've said you can eat it sure and it's

1929
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:53,920
something that's still

1930
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:55,920
okay

1931
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:58,400
but it's not top dog

1932
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:59,839
it's not top dog really important though

1933
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:01,440
