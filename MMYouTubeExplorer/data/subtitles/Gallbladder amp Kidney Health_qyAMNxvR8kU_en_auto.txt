[0.08 - 4.88] now we're talking about gallbladders
[2.48 - 7.36] talking about adrenals kidneys
[4.88 - 8.16] talk about kidney stones we're talking
[7.36 - 9.76] about
[8.16 - 11.36] lots of things we can talk about the
[9.76 - 14.08] bladder too
[11.36 - 14.92] but what we're going to talk about is
[14.08 - 17.28] why
[14.92 - 19.44] everyone thinks it's perfectly fine and
[17.28 - 22.80] normal to have kidney stones and
[19.44 - 25.52] gallbladder stones dysfunctional livers
[22.80 - 28.00] dysfunctional kidneys adrenals that are
[25.52 - 30.64] all burnt out we walk around and we
[28.00 - 31.92] we just accept it or we don't know about
[30.64 - 32.72] it and then when we learn a little bit
[31.92 - 35.84] about it
[32.72 - 37.20] we just accept it again or when we find
[35.84 - 39.04] out we have a kidney stone or we have a
[37.20 - 41.92] gallbladder stone
[39.04 - 43.04] we think hey we better just eat a
[41.92 - 45.04] certain way and it turns out that
[43.04 - 46.64] certain way is actually disastrous for a
[45.04 - 48.64] kidney stone gallbladder
[46.64 - 50.24] a gallbladder stone it's interesting how
[48.64 - 52.72] things work you guys i'm excited
[50.24 - 53.44] this is the last day tomorrow's the last
[52.72 - 56.72] day last
[53.44 - 59.68] two days of the mm-900 hds sale

[90.24 - 96.08] on a device like a juicer

[96.08 - 99.92] medical device i told you about that too
[98.24 - 102.00] you guys you don't want to be on other
[99.92 - 104.16] medical devices because

[122.08 - 127.12] eggs i just want to know
[124.32 - 128.56] who's raised on cheese who was raised on
[127.12 - 131.12] eggs
[128.56 - 133.20] right you raised on cheese raised on
[131.12 - 137.36] eggs
[133.20 - 140.08] raised on that who was raised on butter
[137.36 - 141.52] who's raised on butter nice stick of
[140.08 - 144.88] butter right here
[141.52 - 146.96] right red cheese
[144.88 - 148.88] who's raised on cheese good to see you
[146.96 - 150.40] guys we're live right now
[148.88 - 152.16] were you guys how much cheese and butter
[150.40 - 154.56] and eggs have you guys eaten
[152.16 - 156.24] just just wondering how much cheese
[154.56 - 158.56] butter and eggs
[156.24 - 161.84] right a lot of cheese buttered eggs
[158.56 - 166.32] raised on cheese butter and eggs
[161.84 - 167.84] how many pizzas have you guys had
[166.32 - 170.24] how many pizzas there's a pizza right
[167.84 - 172.08] here in the medical medium kitchen
[170.24 - 173.76] how many pizzas have you guys eaten
[172.08 - 175.60] right
[173.76 - 178.00] i'm not shaming anybody i'm not judging
[175.60 - 180.96] anybody nothing like that
[178.00 - 182.88] nothing like that at all i'm just
[180.96 - 186.00] thinking what are we doing
[182.88 - 188.48] to reverse all those meals we
[186.00 - 189.60] ate all those meals what are we doing to
[188.48 - 191.84] reverse
[189.60 - 194.72] all that build up all that sediment in
[191.84 - 196.16] the gallbladder right
[194.72 - 197.36] that's your liver right there that's
[196.16 - 198.48] your gallbladder right here the
[197.36 - 202.00] gallbladder
[198.48 - 205.04] gets filled up with sludge and sediment
[202.00 - 207.04] and sludge and more sediment more sludge
[205.04 - 208.72] and it gets heavy so our gallbladders
[207.04 - 211.04] get heavy and then we get stones
[208.72 - 214.16] building up in there too
[211.04 - 216.48] and a big part of that is
[214.16 - 218.64] all the eggs we've done all those years
[216.48 - 221.36] all the butter we do all those years
[218.64 - 223.12] right anybody that says butter's healthy
[221.36 - 225.84] i just i just have to laugh
[223.12 - 227.92] i have to laugh i can't you know dr
[225.84 - 231.12] nesbitt rescue us
[227.92 - 231.12] i have to laugh because
[231.60 - 235.20] butter is really a tough one on the body
[234.40 - 237.76] real tough
[235.20 - 239.36] okay burns out the liver feeds all the
[237.76 - 241.52] viruses and bacteria
[239.36 - 242.88] feeds everything proliferates everything
[241.52 - 245.76] that's bad for us
[242.88 - 249.04] but what it also does is it causes you
[245.76 - 251.04] to lose calcium out of your bones
[249.04 - 252.88] so we're all in the business of just
[251.04 - 254.40] blowing our calcium reserves out left
[252.88 - 256.32] and right that's what we do
[254.40 - 257.92] we blow all of our calcium reserves out
[256.32 - 260.32] left and right
[257.92 - 261.12] that's how it works we acidify our
[260.32 - 263.44] bodies
[261.12 - 265.20] with all that butter and all that cheese
[263.44 - 266.48] got some cheese sticks right here

[334.96 - 336.72] right
[335.68 - 338.32] if you guys just came on here i'm
[336.72 - 339.92] talking about kidney stones gallbladder
[338.32 - 341.28] gallbladder stones
[339.92 - 344.56] all kinds of different problems that we
[341.28 - 347.04] get okay sediment in the gallbladder
[344.56 - 347.84] all right important to know all that's
[347.04 - 350.48] important
[347.84 - 353.84] this is the mm-900 hds the sales lasting
[350.48 - 355.20] today and tomorrow you can save 65
[353.84 - 357.76] i'm gonna juice in a little while
[355.20 - 359.04] because celery juice is critical for
[357.76 - 360.72] cleaning up the sediment in the
[359.04 - 362.24] gallbladder it's critical for cleaning
[360.72 - 363.04] up the liver critical for cleaning up
[362.24 - 366.08] the kidneys
[363.04 - 368.32] dissolving stones that's the medical
[366.08 - 369.92] device right there that's the medical
[368.32 - 372.16] tool it's 20
[369.92 - 374.16] off of megajuicers.com just so you guys
[372.16 - 377.60] know so megajuicers.com
[374.16 - 379.52] right now 20 off save 65
[377.60 - 381.12] for the best juicer i've ever seen and
[379.52 - 382.88] it saves money like no
[381.12 - 385.76] other and that's what's incredible about
[382.88 - 387.60] it if a head of salaries like two
[385.76 - 389.12] dollars and fifty cents two dollars and
[387.60 - 390.56] forty nine cents sometimes it's two
[389.12 - 391.28] dollars sometimes you can get it for a
[390.56 - 392.96] dollar
[391.28 - 394.72] sometimes you can get ahead of celery
[392.96 - 396.64] depending on what time of year
[394.72 - 397.84] you know a bunch of celery you can get
[396.64 - 399.76] you know cost a little bit more
[397.84 - 402.16] sometimes it costs a little less
[399.76 - 403.68] what i love about the juicer is that for
[402.16 - 407.28] me i've had to buy
[403.68 - 408.08] half the celery less half less celery
[407.28 - 410.96] than i normally
[408.08 - 412.16] buy so if i needed a case a week it's a
[410.96 - 414.16] half a case
[412.16 - 415.76] if you're somebody that needs a half a
[414.16 - 418.00] bunch of celery
[415.76 - 418.80] right a day then you're going to
[418.00 - 420.40] basically
[418.80 - 422.16] it's going to cut it down to a little
[420.40 - 423.76] more than a quarter of celery you'll
[422.16 - 425.20] need right a little more than a quarter
[423.76 - 426.72] that's that's what i've been noticing
[425.20 - 428.24] all this time so the juicer pays for
[426.72 - 429.36] itself and pays for itself
[428.24 - 432.40] if you're somebody that needs two
[429.36 - 434.96] bunches a day then you're saving already
[432.40 - 437.04] probably three quarters of a bunch
[434.96 - 439.52] easy because it squeeze out so much
[437.04 - 440.88] juice and then it adds up and it adds up
[439.52 - 442.40] and then over the course of the year you
[440.88 - 442.72] just bought yourself two new juicers
[442.40 - 445.44] three
[442.72 - 446.80] new juicers for free it paid for itself
[445.44 - 450.16] cheryl said did all that
[446.80 - 451.92] now i no longer have a gallbladder
[450.16 - 454.00] which is why celery juice is important
[451.92 - 455.60] all on its own you know for many years
[454.00 - 456.96] people have come knocking on my door at
[455.60 - 458.48] the office like i don't have a
[456.96 - 460.24] gallbladder because i know
[458.48 - 461.60] or i'd see they don't have a gallbladder
[460.24 - 463.76] be like you know you're missing
[461.60 - 464.96] your gallbladder right yeah i'm missing
[463.76 - 467.04] my gallbladder
[464.96 - 468.80] okay they take gallbladder pluck
[467.04 - 469.68] gallbladders out of people left and
[468.80 - 472.08] right
[469.68 - 473.84] because they gotta they gotta pluck
[472.08 - 474.48] gallbladders a lot of times they do it
[473.84 - 476.96] without
[474.48 - 478.24] having to some people have mystery pain
[476.96 - 480.40] nobody knows what it is
[478.24 - 481.44] it's a mystery pain and they pluck those
[480.40 - 484.40] gallbladders out
[481.44 - 485.36] just for the sake just for just for the
[484.40 - 487.04] sake of it
[485.36 - 489.76] they just pluck them out pluck them like
[487.04 - 491.28] apples off a tree pluck put put
[489.76 - 493.68] pluck pull pluck gall bladders goblins
[491.28 - 495.12] gallbladders right
[493.68 - 497.52] kidney stones are really common
[495.12 - 498.80] everybody's got kidney stones it depends
[497.52 - 502.72] on what's happening
[498.80 - 506.96] so we'll cover that a little bit so
[502.72 - 509.92] right inside your kidney you guys
[506.96 - 512.32] inside your kidneys all that butter all
[509.92 - 514.48] that butter ends up in the kidney
[512.32 - 516.16] all that all those eggs end up in the
[514.48 - 517.36] kidney all that cheese ends up in the
[516.16 - 520.24] kidneys
[517.36 - 521.60] sits in there on the shelf sits right
[520.24 - 523.36] there on the shelf
[521.60 - 524.96] you get the protein stones and the
[523.36 - 526.88] calcium stones sometimes you get a
[524.96 - 527.52] combination of both protein and calcium
[526.88 - 530.88] stones
[527.52 - 532.88] everybody's got it you may not know
[530.88 - 534.08] olympic athletes have it they have
[532.88 - 535.44] kidney stones
[534.08 - 537.28] i mean i can't tell you how many olympic
[535.44 - 538.80] athletes that come to me for help for
[537.28 - 540.16] different stuff with their health as as
[538.80 - 541.44] they're getting a little older
[540.16 - 543.36] and next to you know they've got kidney
[541.44 - 545.60] stones how's that possible
[543.36 - 547.60] it's possible because if you're not
[545.60 - 549.36] you've still if you're not eating good
[547.60 - 551.36] you're eating really acidic you could be
[549.36 - 553.12] really really really acidic and still
[551.36 - 556.16] have lots of muscle and still be able to
[553.12 - 558.16] perform but be really really acidic
[556.16 - 559.36] but stuff all breaks down later on and
[558.16 - 561.44] breaks down all
[559.36 - 563.12] later on and breaks down inside those
[561.44 - 563.84] kidneys right on the shelf right there
[563.12 - 566.56] and these little
[563.84 - 569.52] these little nooks and crannies in here
[566.56 - 573.60] you get all these little tiny crystals
[569.52 - 576.24] calcium crystals protein crystals
[573.60 - 578.80] and i'll go into like why we get the
[576.24 - 580.56] protein versus calcium so let's do that
[578.80 - 582.56] protein versus calcium you guys just
[580.56 - 585.44] came on here this the mm-900

[653.44 - 656.72] we leach calcium is what we do we leach
[656.16 - 660.16] it from
[656.72 - 662.96] our bones that's how we do it okay we
[660.16 - 666.96] lose our calcium as time goes on
[662.96 - 666.96] right and
[667.84 - 674.64] we all end up there we all end up there
[672.08 - 676.32] and all our calcium ends up in our
[674.64 - 679.36] kidneys and we
[676.32 - 681.12] pee it out all the time we pee our
[679.36 - 684.24] calcium out
[681.12 - 685.20] every single day we pee it out that's
[684.24 - 687.20] what we do
[685.20 - 689.52] we peel a little bit more of our calcium
[687.20 - 691.68] out every day even if you don't have a
[689.52 - 693.20] big calcium stone in your kidney
[691.68 - 695.68] you've got all these little calcium
[693.20 - 697.84] crystals in your kidney your kidneys
[695.68 - 699.12] build up all these tiny little calcium
[697.84 - 701.60] crystals and we
[699.12 - 703.52] we pee out those crystals every single
[701.60 - 706.96] day we pee out those crystals
[703.52 - 710.56] that's what we do so our frame
[706.96 - 714.40] starts to slowly disintegrate as
[710.56 - 717.68] every year and decade goes by a frame
[714.40 - 721.20] slowly disintegrates our skull
[717.68 - 723.04] starts to dissolve inside out inside
[721.20 - 726.08] out that's where it starts to dissolve
[723.04 - 729.84] okay that's where it dissolves
[726.08 - 733.36] from the inside out it gets thin
[729.84 - 734.64] and then you're 60 years old 55 years
[733.36 - 738.08] old
[734.64 - 740.16] sometimes 45 sometimes whatever
[738.08 - 742.00] and you and you're walking along and you
[740.16 - 743.44] slip and you bend your head
[742.00 - 746.08] and you fractured your skull because
[743.44 - 748.24] things are getting thinner
[746.08 - 749.84] julie says you said in cleanse to heal
[748.24 - 751.36] there's toxic calcium
[749.84 - 753.44] is this what you are referring to leach
[751.36 - 755.12] bone calcium the toxic calcium is from
[753.44 - 757.60] dairy products
[755.12 - 758.24] so that's the toxic calcium that's one
[757.60 - 760.00] of them
[758.24 - 761.76] the other toxic calcium comes out of
[760.00 - 765.28] chemtrails floating out of the sky
[761.76 - 766.40] man we are and you know comes floating
[765.28 - 770.08] out the sky
[766.40 - 771.76] it comes okay toxic calcium is also on
[770.08 - 774.32] water supplies right
[771.76 - 775.68] but toxic calcium is also in the dairy
[774.32 - 777.84] products that's the calcium that's the
[775.68 - 778.56] toxic calcium too and toxic calcium
[777.84 - 781.12] causes
[778.56 - 781.84] the leaching of our our you know good
[781.12 - 784.00] calcium
[781.84 - 785.52] that causes it as well because you know
[784.00 - 787.52] and so
[785.52 - 789.76] problem is we walk around so acidic and
[787.52 - 791.76] then we're doing the caffeine you guys
[789.76 - 793.68] and we're doing the vinegars we're doing
[791.76 - 794.16] the caffeine we're doing the vinegars
[793.68 - 797.76] and we're
[794.16 - 799.52] leaching calcium left and right
[797.76 - 800.80] and that calcium crystals build up in
[799.52 - 802.16] the kidneys
[800.80 - 803.92] and the reason why we leach it is we
[802.16 - 805.52] have to buffer the acids we have to
[803.92 - 807.12] buffer the acids
[805.52 - 808.88] that's how our body works to protect
[807.12 - 811.04] your organ brain your brain
[808.88 - 812.08] and your heart to buffer the acid guys
[811.04 - 815.04] just came on
[812.08 - 817.12] sale is on for two more days on the mm
[815.04 - 820.44] 900 hds just so you know

[820.44 - 828.00] megajuicers.com the mm-900 hds
[824.96 - 831.52] so really important to know
[828.00 - 833.76] how protein works okay
[831.52 - 836.40] protein doesn't break down in
[833.76 - 838.32] everybody's guts anymore we don't break
[836.40 - 839.92] our protein down we think we break our
[838.32 - 843.20] protein down but we don't
[839.92 - 845.04] because our hcl doesn't allow it we
[843.20 - 847.20] don't have strong hcl anymore
[845.04 - 849.52] everybody's losing their hcl
[847.20 - 850.64] they're losing our hydrochloric acid
[849.52 - 853.12] it's important to know
[850.64 - 853.12] right here
[855.04 - 859.20] okay our stomach
[859.36 - 863.68] our stomach tends to wear out people's

[911.04 - 914.32] i'm having my chicken breast right here
[913.28 - 917.52] just
[914.32 - 919.04] disclaimer 4-1-1 to the animal protein
[917.52 - 921.04] people
[919.04 - 922.88] okay i support animal protein diets and
[921.04 - 924.80] i support plant-based diets
[922.88 - 926.40] i'll rip apart the plant-based diet in
[924.80 - 929.20] 10 seconds flat
[926.40 - 930.40] 10 seconds flat i'm not biased and i'm
[929.20 - 933.36] not sure this isn't an
[930.40 - 936.32] anti-animal protein campaign but you
[933.36 - 938.80] want to keep on doing too much chicken
[936.32 - 940.32] too much chicken you're gonna burn out
[938.80 - 945.36] those stomach glands
[940.32 - 945.36] burn them out lila says
[945.68 - 949.04] sylvia phil spinach is among those green
[948.24 - 950.56] veggies
[949.04 - 953.12] that contain the highest amount of
[950.56 - 955.20] oxalic acid wrong
[953.12 - 957.12] eating too much spinach may result in
[955.20 - 961.04] the formation of calcium oxalate
[957.12 - 962.48] oxalate wrong which can cause kidney
[961.04 - 964.88] stones not true that's called
[962.48 - 966.40] misinformation and that's what's sad
[964.88 - 968.24] because you're going to carry that mr
[966.40 - 971.36] information around
[968.24 - 972.24] and that's really really sad no one has
[971.36 - 976.32] ever eaten
[972.24 - 977.92] enough spinach to prove that point okay
[976.32 - 979.44] you know somebody that's gobbling down
[977.92 - 980.64] barrels and barrels like spinach you
[979.44 - 982.00] know somebody's eating a big giant
[980.64 - 983.52] container or two of spinach
[982.00 - 985.20] every single day did they get kidney
[983.52 - 986.48] stones who do you know that ate that
[985.20 - 988.72] much spinach are you talking about a
[986.48 - 990.88] spinach leaf on somebody's salad
[988.72 - 992.56] somewhere are you talking about in a
[990.88 - 994.40] restaurant a fancy restaurant somebody
[992.56 - 995.92] put a spinach leaf who orders spinach in
[994.40 - 997.68] a restaurant do you go into a
[995.92 - 1000.08] restaurant did you order spinach at a
[997.68 - 1000.96] pizza place so it's it's spinach that's
[1000.08 - 1004.48] causing the
[1000.96 - 1007.28] the stones so um is that what it is

[1145.60 - 1151.84] ordered
[1146.64 - 1151.84] because i didn't water it you're right
[1156.32 - 1159.52] the thing is you guys
[1161.44 - 1165.04] you guys the thing is is this okay i
[1163.12 - 1166.56] understand there's misinformation out
[1165.04 - 1167.92] there and and to the credit of the
[1166.56 - 1169.60] person
[1167.92 - 1172.24] you know to the credit of the person
[1169.60 - 1175.28] that says you know that spinach causes
[1172.24 - 1177.28] uh you know an oxalic acid stone or
[1175.28 - 1179.92] you know actually causes you know a
[1177.28 - 1182.08] stone a stone in the kidney
[1179.92 - 1183.76] it's misinformation and i don't blame
[1182.08 - 1185.60] you for having misinformation it's just
[1183.76 - 1187.36] that information hurts people
[1185.60 - 1188.96] it'll make someone who doesn't even eat
[1187.36 - 1191.68] spinach anyway
[1188.96 - 1193.52] it'll make them never eat a spinach leaf
[1191.68 - 1195.92] if they even had a spinach leaf
[1193.52 - 1198.16] two years ago in some weird mixed green
[1195.92 - 1199.92] salad over a friend's house
[1198.16 - 1201.92] the point is no one's eating spinach
[1199.92 - 1202.32] spinach has never given anybody a kidney
[1201.92 - 1204.88] stone
[1202.32 - 1206.96] ever spinach is an incredible food you
[1204.88 - 1207.60] should juice it if you get the mm-900
[1206.96 - 1208.96] juice it
[1207.60 - 1211.12] juice it with a whole bunch of different
[1208.96 - 1212.96] stuff it's an incredible food
[1211.12 - 1214.24] what i love like the mm-900 i'll run
[1212.96 - 1216.88] spinach through here
[1214.24 - 1219.68] i don't just do celery in here but
[1216.88 - 1222.80] spinach helps to bring people back
[1219.68 - 1224.40] it helps to bring you back from hell
[1222.80 - 1226.00] it helps to bring you back from chronic
[1224.40 - 1227.60] illness and autoimmune disease
[1226.00 - 1229.36] medical medium spinach soup has brought
[1227.60 - 1232.32] back a lot of people and
[1229.36 - 1233.28] and it's misinformation it's so sad so
[1232.32 - 1235.28] sad who eats
[1233.28 - 1236.80] who's ever eaten enough spinach what
[1235.28 - 1238.32] doctor's eating enough spinach to get
[1236.80 - 1239.52] himself his own kidney stone from
[1238.32 - 1241.20] spinach none
[1239.52 - 1242.64] they get kidney stones because they're
[1241.20 - 1244.40] eating eggs
[1242.64 - 1246.32] that's eating eggs how many eggs have
[1244.40 - 1248.72] you had compared to how much spinach
[1246.32 - 1250.40] have you had in 30 years
[1248.72 - 1251.76] meanwhile you will get a kidney stone
[1250.40 - 1253.60] and it won't because of a piece of
[1251.76 - 1255.28] spinach and because your caffeine your
[1253.60 - 1257.60] vinegar
[1255.28 - 1259.52] your kidney stones are caused by
[1257.60 - 1262.72] caffeine they're caused by vinegar
[1259.52 - 1264.96] acidic acidic foods and now kombucha tea
[1262.72 - 1266.56] all the all the people yoga mamas with
[1264.96 - 1268.48] their kombucha tea
[1266.56 - 1270.72] yoga dudes with their kombucha tea will
[1268.48 - 1272.00] end up with kit with kidney stones
[1270.72 - 1274.16] they'll end up with kidney stones down
[1272.00 - 1276.64] the road once they get past that age
[1274.16 - 1277.60] 30 and they're all getting paid age 38
[1276.64 - 1279.44] and they've been used to drinking
[1277.60 - 1281.20] kombucha tea for 10 years
[1279.44 - 1282.32] they'll get their kidney stones because
[1281.20 - 1284.32] they'll be on their vinegars and
[1282.32 - 1286.08] kombucha tea and they're caffeine
[1284.32 - 1291.84] and they'll be on their eggs still and
[1286.08 - 1291.84] they'll get their kidney stones
[1298.40 - 1301.28] that's how it works that's how it works
[1300.16 - 1302.96] we've got a lot to cover we're going to
[1301.28 - 1303.84] talk about stones we're going to talk
[1302.96 - 1305.28] about

[1658.40 - 1660.80] a plant-based diet if you're on a
[1660.00 - 1663.44] plant-based diet
[1660.80 - 1664.80] stay on a plant-based diet if you're on
[1663.44 - 1667.12] an animal protein diet that's what you
[1664.80 - 1668.96] want to do stay on it
[1667.12 - 1670.48] don't switch sides you don't have to
[1668.96 - 1671.92] switch sides you have to run back and
[1670.48 - 1674.24] forth
[1671.92 - 1676.08] but but you need to know how to clean
[1674.24 - 1678.48] things up either way because you can be
[1676.08 - 1683.28] plant-based and dirty everything up and
[1678.48 - 1686.72] and not heal in fact get sick
[1683.28 - 1690.00] here's how the plant-based diet works
[1686.72 - 1692.72] you eat lots of fat plant fat
[1690.00 - 1695.20] until you get sick and then you get you
[1692.72 - 1698.48] get run and scared
[1695.20 - 1700.16] back to your eggs you get run and scared

[1717.04 - 1721.20] love it never had that with a juicer
[1719.36 - 1724.32] before in my life
[1721.20 - 1727.52] try them all
[1724.32 - 1730.80] this is a cold cold pressed juicer
[1727.52 - 1734.40] right and um
[1730.80 - 1737.44] no metal gears grinding against
[1734.40 - 1739.76] each other no metal gears
[1737.44 - 1742.08] don't know a juicer better it's quiet
[1739.76 - 1743.82] you can juice without tons of noise
[1742.08 - 1745.84] you don't hear
[1743.82 - 1747.84] [Music]
[1745.84 - 1749.36] you don't hear all these crazy noises
[1747.84 - 1753.68] you don't hear that when you're juicing
[1749.36 - 1755.28] with this
[1753.68 - 1756.80] the only problem with juicing with this
[1755.28 - 1758.56] juicer is it's too quiet
[1756.80 - 1759.84] for me because then i have to hear
[1758.56 - 1761.44] spirit of compassion
[1759.84 - 1764.64] when i really don't want to hear spirit
[1761.44 - 1764.64] of compassion all the time
[1764.96 - 1769.44] as you probably know if you read origins
[1767.52 - 1771.65] of a medical medium in my
[1769.44 - 1774.73] new edition
[1771.65 - 1774.73] [Music]
[1775.60 - 1783.84] anthony are you plant-based it's
[1778.96 - 1786.64] it's a secret it's a secret
[1783.84 - 1789.84] i might be it might be it might be
[1786.64 - 1789.84] plant-based you never know
[1793.60 - 1797.44] i love the plant-based diet love it love
[1796.96 - 1800.24] the plant
[1797.44 - 1801.68] what's the juicer's name see omega
[1800.24 - 1803.52] juicers.com
[1801.68 - 1805.72] but that's not the juicer it's the
[1803.52 - 1809.84] mm-900 hds
[1805.72 - 1809.84] mm-900 hds
[1811.04 - 1818.40] okay so what you'll find in the mm
[1814.96 - 1821.52] 900 hds is you'll find dry pulp right
[1818.40 - 1823.84] dry pulp that's where the money's at
[1821.52 - 1825.28] the money's in the dried pulp right
[1823.84 - 1827.20] that's where the money's at it's the
[1825.28 - 1830.24] dried pulp
[1827.20 - 1830.64] it's not the wet slimy pulp that you
[1830.24 - 1833.20] lose
[1830.64 - 1834.32] all of your juice it's the dried pulp
[1833.20 - 1835.84] and that's where it's at
[1834.32 - 1838.08] and it's important to know how that
[1835.84 - 1838.80] works it's dusty dry you can dump the
[1838.08 - 1841.52] pulp out
[1838.80 - 1842.64] and this is very very very fibrous
[1841.52 - 1845.28] celery right here
[1842.64 - 1846.08] extremely fibrous right but what you
[1845.28 - 1849.28] won't find
[1846.08 - 1851.20] is that wet juice just dry
[1849.28 - 1852.40] all the little pieces they didn't stick
[1851.20 - 1854.08] they're dry right
[1852.40 - 1856.96] that's that's the difference that's
[1854.08 - 1859.76] where the money's at right there
[1856.96 - 1859.76] that's where it's at
[1861.12 - 1866.16] gotta strain your juice straining the
[1864.32 - 1869.36] celery juice is important
[1866.16 - 1872.16] keep that in mind so straining it's
[1869.36 - 1873.84] really important
[1872.16 - 1876.32] a little fell out there because i'm
[1873.84 - 1876.32] being all
[1876.48 - 1880.08] quick right here because i'm trying to
[1878.40 - 1881.76] do this for you guys really quick so i
[1880.08 - 1884.96] dropped a little touch of it
[1881.76 - 1886.72] but can you imagine real wet pulp where
[1884.96 - 1888.16] you lose all the juice anyway and then
[1886.72 - 1889.12] you spill a little drop and now you're
[1888.16 - 1891.20] like oh my god
[1889.12 - 1894.64] now i really lost it all well that's
[1891.20 - 1894.64] incredible really is incredible
[1895.04 - 1899.92] so that's your juice right there let's
[1896.96 - 1899.92] talk about what it does
[1900.24 - 1905.92] so the key the whole key
[1903.44 - 1906.88] about celery for for one it's herbal

[1930.88 - 1936.16] so it's it but we have things stored up
[1934.00 - 1937.76] inside our kidneys inside our liver
[1936.16 - 1939.76] inside our gallbladder
[1937.76 - 1942.08] we have stuff stored up in our stomach

[1960.84 - 1965.04] basin
[1962.00 - 1965.68] the basin where your stomach where your
[1965.04 - 1968.72] food
[1965.68 - 1970.16] leaves your stomach and starts heading
[1968.72 - 1972.64] down your duodenum
[1970.16 - 1973.76] a pocket builds up with sludge right
[1972.64 - 1976.32] there
[1973.76 - 1977.04] a pocket of sludge and then it gets
[1976.32 - 1979.36] heavy
[1977.04 - 1982.00] and then your stomach stretches around
[1979.36 - 1984.88] the duodenum entrance
[1982.00 - 1985.44] and in a divot forms and you get sludge
[1984.88 - 1987.84] that's been

[2343.84 - 2348.16] i have vegan donuts aw i'm clear i'm in
[2346.96 - 2350.96] the clear
[2348.16 - 2351.28] i'm like yeah all that canola oil in
[2350.96 - 2354.56] your
[2351.28 - 2358.80] in your donut your vegan donut
[2354.56 - 2360.48] right all that fat in your vegan donut
[2358.80 - 2362.72] all this other stuff in there you're not
[2360.48 - 2363.52] in the clear you know even plant-based
[2362.72 - 2365.68] people are in the corner
[2363.52 - 2367.20] i can't stop you from eating vegan
[2365.68 - 2368.80] donuts and i can't stop you from eating
[2367.20 - 2370.48] regular donuts
[2368.80 - 2373.12] sue is it common to have lots of
[2370.48 - 2376.24] diarrhea after having celery juice
[2373.12 - 2379.12] well it's like this so
[2376.24 - 2380.48] i want you to be your own detective
[2379.12 - 2382.16] never had diarrhea before
[2380.48 - 2383.76] you don't have diarrhea at all you don't
[2382.16 - 2386.96] have the runs at all so
[2383.76 - 2388.96] it's something that never happened and
[2386.96 - 2389.92] it only happens when you have celery
[2388.96 - 2392.16] juice
[2389.92 - 2393.20] then you're having to die off so what i
[2392.16 - 2396.64] tell people
[2393.20 - 2400.00] is reduce the amount
[2396.64 - 2402.08] that means you're sensitive reduce it
[2400.00 - 2405.20] the other thing is is celery juice is
[2402.08 - 2407.04] going to flush and clean
[2405.20 - 2408.96] it's going to flush and clean and it
[2407.04 - 2410.32] goes away over time the runs with celery
[2408.96 - 2411.04] juice if you're one if you're one of
[2410.32 - 2412.96] those
[2411.04 - 2415.12] that just means you've got a lot going
[2412.96 - 2417.92] on so sue it means you've got a lot
[2415.12 - 2419.04] a lot of bacteria in there got the
[2417.92 - 2420.56] bacteria
[2419.04 - 2422.08] everybody has all the strep and they
[2420.56 - 2423.76] have all the the the
[2422.08 - 2425.52] they have all the e coli they have all
[2423.76 - 2427.92] the staff they have all the c
[2425.52 - 2429.76] diff and it's loaded in there the other
[2427.92 - 2430.88] thing is strain your celery juice that's
[2429.76 - 2431.60] another thing too to be your own
[2430.88 - 2434.40] detective
[2431.60 - 2435.12] and it's really helpful it eases that
[2434.40 - 2438.40] another thing
[2435.12 - 2438.96] too is you know if i was having diarrhea
[2438.40 - 2440.40] and it was
[2438.96 - 2442.48] with celery juice and i didn't change
[2440.40 - 2445.04] anything didn't do anything different
[2442.48 - 2445.84] didn't catch a stomach bug either that's
[2445.04 - 2448.32] something to be
[2445.84 - 2450.32] to consider too did you catch a stomach
[2448.32 - 2452.48] bug did you eat in a restaurant
[2450.32 - 2454.72] around the time you started your celery
[2452.48 - 2456.96] juice because it's easy to just blame
[2454.72 - 2459.76] the new thing you started right
[2456.96 - 2461.68] it's easy i've seen people blame
[2459.76 - 2462.16] everything for anything i've seen people
[2461.68 - 2465.28] blame
[2462.16 - 2467.60] oil pulling for diet for oil pulling
[2465.28 - 2468.96] for diarrhea they started oil pulling
[2467.60 - 2469.92] the week they got food poisoning and
[2468.96 - 2472.32] they're like oh my god it's
[2469.92 - 2473.44] oil pulling i've seen people just blame
[2472.32 - 2475.68] anything and everything
[2473.44 - 2477.60] so what i'm saying is if if it was me
[2475.68 - 2479.68] regardless i would be
[2477.60 - 2482.80] lowering the amount that's what i would
[2479.68 - 2485.12] do but you do what your doctor tells you
[2482.80 - 2486.00] so how many donuts has everybody had how
[2485.12 - 2488.16] many bagels
[2486.00 - 2490.00] ashley rose using celery juice and
[2488.16 - 2492.16] taking out troublemaker foods is how i
[2490.00 - 2494.88] lost 80 pounds in a year
[2492.16 - 2496.64] oh my god incredible i was never able to
[2494.88 - 2500.24] lose weight in my life but when i
[2496.64 - 2504.16] learned my liver was completely maxed
[2500.24 - 2509.12] from ebv you're so smart antibiotics and
[2504.16 - 2511.60] other toxins and metals
[2509.12 - 2512.48] i knew this was a lifestyle change i can
[2511.60 - 2515.04] use to heal
[2512.48 - 2516.48] incredible that's exactly how it works
[2515.04 - 2518.72] the liver gets maxed
[2516.48 - 2520.40] the gallbladder gets maxed everything
[2518.72 - 2522.32] like your liver gets filled with all
[2520.40 - 2524.80] kinds of toxins and poisons all kinds of
[2522.32 - 2527.28] acids and protein and garbage and
[2524.80 - 2528.40] calcium calcium deposits it shouldn't be
[2527.28 - 2530.40] in there everything

[2538.00 - 2541.20] in every day you guys
[2539.52 - 2542.64] you know what it used to be there used
[2541.20 - 2545.12] to be a gas attendant
[2542.64 - 2546.96] at the gas stations and the gas
[2545.12 - 2548.40] attendant would pump gas for like 30
[2546.96 - 2550.80] years and then die
[2548.40 - 2552.56] did you guys know that just die it's
[2550.80 - 2556.32] just petrochemical disease
[2552.56 - 2558.56] they just died now gas attendants
[2556.32 - 2560.72] aren't breathing in gas all day long
[2558.56 - 2562.56] right sometimes it only lasts 10 years
[2560.72 - 2565.44] as a gas attendant before they die
[2562.56 - 2565.76] 15 years 20 years they were like you
[2565.44 - 2567.68] know
[2565.76 - 2569.12] that's what to do you you would be a gas
[2567.68 - 2572.40] attendant you go

[2582.40 - 2586.16] there and breathe it in and
[2583.76 - 2588.16] okay there you go ma'am right and so
[2586.16 - 2590.08] what who took the hit was the gas
[2588.16 - 2592.88] attendants took the hit
[2590.08 - 2593.60] they're the ones that died after they 20
[2592.88 - 2595.52] years
