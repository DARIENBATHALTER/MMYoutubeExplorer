[250.72 - 255.60] at a meal that doesn't have radical fats
[253.44 - 257.04] because okay michelle sounds like he

[257.04 - 259.28] sounds like he didn't have any milk
[258.40 - 260.72] cheese butter
[259.28 - 262.48] eggs sounds like he didn't have any
[260.72 - 263.76] bacon it sounds like he didn't have any
[262.48 - 265.04] kind of pork right
[263.76 - 267.28] didn't sound doesn't sound like he had
[265.04 - 268.64] any chicken or any beef it doesn't sound
[267.28 - 270.08] like you had nut butters
[268.64 - 272.56] doesn't sound like you had you know
[270.08 - 273.84] seeds and nuts and sunflower seeds and
[272.56 - 276.00] hemp seeds and
[273.84 - 277.04] peanut butter and macadamia nut butter
[276.00 - 278.64] it doesn't sound like you had any of
[277.04 - 280.00] that doesn't sound like you had olives
[278.64 - 283.36] doesn't sound like you have oils
[280.00 - 284.08] coconut oil sesame oil olive oil tahini
[283.36 - 286.56] right
[284.08 - 287.60] doesn't sound like you had any of that
[286.56 - 290.16] and
[287.60 - 291.60] but i know that a lot of people do i
[290.16 - 292.32] mean think about what everybody's eating
[291.60 - 294.00] and maybe as
[292.32 - 295.60] people have avocado toast then they'll
[294.00 - 296.48] take a couple tablespoons of peanut
[295.60 - 298.16] butter
[296.48 - 300.08] and throw it in their smoothie maybe
[298.16 - 301.68] they'll throw it on their acai bowl
[300.08 - 303.04] maybe they'll throw it on their oatmeal
[301.68 - 304.24] right did you guys have oatmeal this
[303.04 - 306.48] morning any of you
[304.24 - 308.08] okay and you'll throw fats on there now
[306.48 - 309.52] see i'm
[308.08 - 311.68] i'm not gonna be able to stop you guys
[309.52 - 313.60] from eating fats every day you just guys
[311.68 - 315.04] most of you guys are just gonna do it
[313.60 - 316.48] and you're gonna do it continuously
[315.04 - 318.00] every single day and there's there's no
[316.48 - 321.12] stopping you it's not like
[318.00 - 323.76] i'm not trying to be like you know
[321.12 - 324.96] a problem and be hey you shouldn't be
[323.76 - 325.92] doing that shouldn't be doing that it's
[324.96 - 328.08] not it it's just that
[325.92 - 330.32] it's good to take a break when you can
[328.08 - 332.40] maybe take a day off
[330.32 - 333.92] maybe do one of the cleanses and cleanse
[332.40 - 337.92] the heel and and take a
[333.92 - 338.72] week off maybe do the 369 advanced and
[337.92 - 340.24] and all that
[338.72 - 342.24] because what happens you guys are doing
[340.24 - 344.96] all this fat
[342.24 - 346.56] and all that fat builds up in the
[344.96 - 348.40] arteries all that fat builds up in the
[346.56 - 350.48] veins and that's what happens there
[348.40 - 353.76] michelle says i got my hashimoto
[350.48 - 354.24] antibodies down from 404 to 33 following
[353.76 - 356.48] you
[354.24 - 357.68] amazing i'm so proud of you i'm so so
[356.48 - 360.48] proud of you
[357.68 - 362.00] um what happens is when you're doing the
[360.48 - 363.36] fats every day when you do the pork when
[362.00 - 364.72] you do the bacon when you do the milk
[363.36 - 367.28] cheese butter when you do
[364.72 - 367.92] the nut butter cisco is plant-based too
[367.28 - 369.36] this isn't
[367.92 - 371.60] you know just because we say we're
[369.36 - 374.48] plant-based say we're
[371.60 - 376.64] vegan right or say vegetarian or
[374.48 - 379.92] something or simple plant-based right
[376.64 - 381.60] it doesn't mean you're safe from getting
[379.92 - 383.36] all that plaque and all that buildup
[381.60 - 385.36] inside your heart inside your valves
[383.36 - 387.20] inside your veins
[385.36 - 389.20] because you're not it builds up in
[387.20 - 390.48] everybody everybody gets it in there
[389.20 - 392.40] next thing you know it
[390.48 - 393.76] they hit the microscope shoved up their
[392.40 - 395.36] leg through a vein
[393.76 - 397.12] it's going up there they're looking for
[395.36 - 397.68] collapsed arteries collapsed veins all
[397.12 - 398.88] that stuff

[588.24 - 591.44] foods
[588.88 - 593.36] not to eat so joanne says i love all
[591.44 - 595.92] these foods but hard to
[593.36 - 598.00] hard for me to eat so look you take one
[595.92 - 599.60] day at a time you eat what you can
[598.00 - 601.52] you feel like leslie says five to six
[599.60 - 602.72] years following no no foods but
[601.52 - 605.92] digestion
[602.72 - 606.96] has tanked why will this be hard to
[605.92 - 608.64] digest
[606.96 - 609.84] so what's going on in your life are you
[608.64 - 612.08] really stressed out and know that if
[609.84 - 615.04] we're really stressed out our guts
[612.08 - 616.88] don't want to digest properly i mean if
[615.04 - 618.80] anything's happening any kind of stress
[616.88 - 620.00] any kind of financial stress any kind of
[618.80 - 623.12] other stress
[620.00 - 624.56] anything like that and our digestive
[623.12 - 627.60] system gets really
[624.56 - 629.92] really um exhausted from that you know
[627.60 - 631.20] our nerves our vagus nerve gets affected
[629.92 - 632.48] so a lot of times when we go through
[631.20 - 634.72] anything in life
[632.48 - 635.68] any kind of any kind of trauma any kind
[634.72 - 638.80] of struggle our
[635.68 - 640.96] vagus nerve tightens up it tightens up
[638.80 - 642.32] and our digestive system just has a
[640.96 - 645.76] difficult time
[642.32 - 648.40] um are you eating a lot of grains those
[645.76 - 649.92] are little actually you know a lot more
[648.40 - 651.76] difficult to digest
[649.92 - 652.96] are you eating a lot of meat are you
[651.76 - 655.60] eating a lot of fat
[652.96 - 656.72] all that's difficult to digest so is
[655.60 - 659.84] your
[656.72 - 662.64] digestive system tanking
[659.84 - 663.68] because there's any milk cheese butter
[662.64 - 667.68] ice cream
[663.68 - 671.68] eggs bacon too much chicken too much
[667.68 - 673.60] beef any processed foods at all
[671.68 - 675.60] any any of that maybe you're eating
[673.60 - 678.48] really good but you're
[675.60 - 680.00] you're eating too much avocado um think
[678.48 - 681.84] you know just i'm trying to help you be
[680.00 - 683.84] your own detective here
[681.84 - 685.44] and are you doing chocolate nutritional
[683.84 - 686.80] yeast are you doing vinegar you're doing
[685.44 - 687.44] apple cider vinegar are you doing
[686.80 - 689.12] caffeine
[687.44 - 690.56] all these things can really tank the
[689.12 - 692.80] digestive system
[690.56 - 694.00] and they can tank them over time they
[692.80 - 696.16] can do that they can
[694.00 - 697.84] they can tank the digestive tract over
[696.16 - 699.60] time so if you're doing any kind of
[697.84 - 701.60] caffeine or chocolate you can tank your
[699.60 - 703.84] digestive tract because
[701.60 - 704.80] not only does the chocolate is at high
[703.84 - 706.64] in fat but
[704.80 - 708.32] what happens is the caffeine hits the
[706.64 - 709.68] adrenals really hard and once your
[708.32 - 711.68] adrenals start to weaken
[709.68 - 713.84] start to weaken start to weaken
[711.68 - 715.12] digestion starts to weaken the liver
[713.84 - 717.04] starts to weaken
[715.12 - 719.76] because when our adrenals are really
[717.04 - 721.44] overrun and overtaxed by caffeine
[719.76 - 723.20] our liver just starts to get overburden
[721.44 - 724.88] overburden overburden so then the
[723.20 - 726.16] digestion eventually starts to fall
[724.88 - 727.76] apart
[726.16 - 730.48] but really i mean have you tried the
[727.76 - 732.00] monoeating cleanse
[730.48 - 733.84] have you tried the mono eating cleanse
[732.00 - 734.40] have you tried the potato monolithic
[733.84 - 736.80] cleanse
[734.40 - 738.24] the banana papaya monolining cleanse
[736.80 - 739.76] have you tried any of that so that's
[738.24 - 740.40] what i've always recommended other
[739.76 - 742.24] people
[740.40 - 743.44] to do doctors and stuff doctors come to
[742.24 - 744.08] me and they'll be like what do i do
[743.44 - 746.08] about
[744.08 - 747.36] this patient and stuff with mono eating
[746.08 - 749.12] cleanse and they say well yeah we're
[747.36 - 751.84] doing it it's starting to work
[749.12 - 753.60] and and what happens is it's easy on the
[751.84 - 755.44] digestion it helps you restore your
[753.60 - 757.36] adrenals back it helps to restore your
[755.44 - 759.76] digestion
[757.36 - 760.64] but you might want to consider you might
[759.76 - 762.72] want to think about
[760.64 - 764.48] what are you doing like are you doing a
[762.72 - 768.00] lot of fats is that happening
[764.48 - 770.48] are you doing is that going on um
[768.00 - 772.08] and it's not just the fats it's even
[770.48 - 773.36] more than that is there vinegar in there
[772.08 - 776.56] kills the gastric
[773.36 - 778.00] gastric glands so when we do acetic acid
[776.56 - 779.68] like apple cider vinegar
[778.00 - 781.20] even if we do it once every couple of
[779.68 - 784.64] weeks we basically
[781.20 - 787.76] wipe our stomach lands clean
[784.64 - 788.80] in a negative way we just we just bash
[787.76 - 790.88] them we just
[788.80 - 792.64] wipe them out so they're they're exhaust
[790.88 - 793.36] they don't have any more gastric juice
[792.64 - 795.68] because they
[793.36 - 796.80] they lost it all from the acetic acid so
[795.68 - 797.68] when we drop down a little bit of
[796.80 - 799.76] vinegar
[797.68 - 801.04] a little bit acetic acid our stomach
[799.76 - 803.28] glands they just
[801.04 - 804.48] spill their guts they smell everything
[803.28 - 806.88] they have left
[804.48 - 808.64] and and then they're just done that's
[806.88 - 810.08] acetic acid it does say i'll just have
[808.64 - 811.04] some apple cider vinegar here let me
[810.08 - 813.28] just
[811.04 - 814.96] let me just do some apple cider vinegar
[813.28 - 816.72] and meanwhile
[814.96 - 818.48] the stomach glands they're just these
[816.72 - 820.24] tiny little glands
[818.48 - 821.92] that produce your stomach acid your
[820.24 - 824.56] gastric acid these
[821.92 - 826.16] tiny little glands and when you throw in
[824.56 - 829.52] that apple cider vinegar
[826.16 - 831.28] they almost explode i mean literally
[829.52 - 833.44] did not literally almost explode but
[831.28 - 835.60] they do explode every gastric juice they
[833.44 - 837.60] can possibly muster it up and they just
[835.60 - 839.12] spill it all out and then they're just
[837.60 - 842.00] white they're wiped out
[839.12 - 842.32] and and they sit there wiped out and
[842.00 - 844.56] then
[842.32 - 846.40] it takes days to restore and then we do
[844.56 - 847.44] apple cider vinegar again or vinegar
[846.40 - 850.48] again
[847.44 - 852.32] and and it takes a lot of mineral salts
[850.48 - 854.08] are you doing enough celery juice
[852.32 - 856.08] are you doing celery juice every single
[854.08 - 858.00] day are you restoring
[856.08 - 860.88] those stomach lands and getting them
[858.00 - 862.96] back so yeah our digestion can get wiped
[860.88 - 863.68] out it can get wiped out easy if we've
[862.96 - 866.64] already had
[863.68 - 868.64] years and years of high fat years and
[866.64 - 871.60] years of vinegar
[868.64 - 873.28] years and years of caffeine if you did
[871.60 - 875.36] caffeine 10 years ago
[873.28 - 877.68] and you don't do it anymore and you did
[875.36 - 880.08] alcohol it's 15 years ago
[877.68 - 881.44] and you did nutritional yeast that you
[880.08 - 883.92] did apple cider vinegar
[881.44 - 885.44] 10 years ago and you know and you've
[883.92 - 888.08] already been on the high fat
[885.44 - 889.92] year after year who hasn't everybody is
[888.08 - 892.00] the digestive system is going to get rot
[889.92 - 894.08] wonky wonky wonky wonky and then when
[892.00 - 895.76] you try to heal it you try to heal it
[894.08 - 897.76] a lot of fats are being used it's like
[895.76 - 898.80] hey avocado's healthy let me eat that
[897.76 - 900.88] every single day
[898.80 - 902.32] let me make avocado toast hey nut
[900.88 - 904.32] butters are healthy let me do
[902.32 - 906.08] lots of nut butter let me do almond milk
[904.32 - 907.20] all that almond milk all the oat milk
[906.08 - 909.76] right
[907.20 - 911.44] and then our finally everything just
[909.76 - 914.00] goes
[911.44 - 916.24] done everybody's like done just
[914.00 - 918.80] exhausted your liver is exhausted
[916.24 - 921.84] adrenals are exhausted stomach glands
[918.80 - 925.20] are exhausted and everything's just
[921.84 - 926.88] done and that's what happens and then
[925.20 - 930.48] you might have some pathogens going on
[926.88 - 930.48] you might have some streptococcus
[930.80 - 934.56] might have a little bit of strep like my
[933.28 - 937.84] little strep
[934.56 - 940.40] model right here there it is
[937.84 - 941.52] what people don't realize and science
[940.40 - 945.12] research doesn't know
[941.52 - 948.16] is bacteria and viruses
[945.12 - 951.04] there's a little virus right here okay
[948.16 - 954.16] bacteria and viruses eat food so when
[951.04 - 955.52] you're doing some gluten
[954.16 - 958.56] when you're doing a little gluten this
[955.52 - 960.40] is a piece of lettuce it's not gluten so
[958.56 - 962.72] i don't have any gluten in this in this
[960.40 - 964.00] house but say this is a piece of gluten
[962.72 - 966.80] right here
[964.00 - 968.00] right so it's floating around floating
[966.80 - 970.48] around it's in your liver
[968.00 - 972.48] or it's in your bloodstream and you got
[970.48 - 973.04] that streptococcus oh you don't have
[972.48 - 974.48] strep
[973.04 - 976.64] i heard somebody just say they don't
[974.48 - 978.08] have strep i did
[976.64 - 979.60] and i didn't hear it myself through my
[978.08 - 980.88] own ear i heard it from spirit of
[979.60 - 982.56] compassion
[980.88 - 984.40] somebody just said spirit of compassion
[982.56 - 986.72] said that
[984.40 - 987.68] they don't have strep so this is a waste
[986.72 - 990.16] of their time
[987.68 - 991.52] that's what spirit just said to me um i
[990.16 - 993.36] should probably tell you guys more about
[991.52 - 994.64] what spirit says to me as i got to do
[993.36 - 996.64] all these lives it's actually really
[994.64 - 999.20] hard um
[996.64 - 1001.52] but guess what you do have strep if you
[999.20 - 1004.32] had strep throat when you were a kid
[1001.52 - 1006.48] you got strep got acne you got strep if
[1004.32 - 1008.72] you ever had a uti
[1006.48 - 1010.56] yeast infection you got strep any kind
[1008.72 - 1012.08] of chronic sinusitis you got strep
[1010.56 - 1014.00] everybody's got strep even if the
[1012.08 - 1016.40] symptoms don't come out
[1014.00 - 1017.28] uh bladder infection kidney infection
[1016.40 - 1020.16] whatever
[1017.28 - 1020.48] and is that gluten swimming around in
[1020.16 - 1023.60] you
[1020.48 - 1024.00] right that strep bacteria likes to
[1023.60 - 1026.16] gobble
[1024.00 - 1028.48] it up i don't know if this can actually
[1026.16 - 1031.12] and it just it absorbs it right up
[1028.48 - 1032.40] it absorbs it through the membrane the
[1031.12 - 1033.36] gluten went right in there how do you
[1032.40 - 1034.88] like that
[1033.36 - 1036.56] the strep bacteria just absorb the
[1034.88 - 1039.12] gluten wow
[1036.56 - 1040.56] and munching that right up munching that
[1039.12 - 1043.28] right up right and then all of a sudden
[1040.56 - 1045.28] that streptococcus gets nice and strong
[1043.28 - 1047.20] nice and strong and then it goes up into
[1045.28 - 1049.20] the derma a little bit higher and all of
[1047.20 - 1050.96] a sudden whoa i got cystic acne now
[1049.20 - 1053.52] i just broke out with a little cystic
[1050.96 - 1054.08] acne here a little cystic acne here acne
[1053.52 - 1055.60] here
[1054.08 - 1057.04] and that's because of strep but guess
[1055.60 - 1058.72] what the doctor's going to tell you
[1057.04 - 1059.36] you're hormonal and that's why you broke
[1058.72 - 1061.60] out with your
[1059.36 - 1063.20] with your acne because they don't know
[1061.60 - 1065.12] it's streptococcus they'll think it's
[1063.20 - 1066.56] hormones because they blame everybody on
[1065.12 - 1069.20] hormones everything's on hormones
[1066.56 - 1071.12] hormones hormones
[1069.20 - 1072.88] and but what happens is if you're going
[1071.12 - 1073.44] through a period of time where you're
[1072.88 - 1075.36] actually
[1073.44 - 1078.24] are hormonal in a sense for your cycle
[1075.36 - 1080.40] or menstruation or anything like that
[1078.24 - 1081.84] you your immune systems drop so when
[1080.40 - 1082.72] your immune systems drop the strep can
[1081.84 - 1084.16] get stronger
[1082.72 - 1086.24] that does happen but it's not the
[1084.16 - 1087.60] hormones causing it it's not how it
[1086.24 - 1089.92] works
[1087.60 - 1090.96] cystic acne isn't something that for
[1089.92 - 1094.00] centuries
[1090.96 - 1097.36] women had this is new acne
[1094.00 - 1100.16] is actually new so you mean to tell me
[1097.36 - 1101.20] all those hundreds of years women didn't
[1100.16 - 1102.96] have hormones
[1101.20 - 1105.12] did women just develop hormones in the
[1102.96 - 1106.24] last 60 years because i'm confused about
[1105.12 - 1107.92] that one
[1106.24 - 1109.36] did women just develop hormones in the
[1107.92 - 1113.28] last 80 years
[1109.36 - 1117.76] because i'm confused because guess what
[1113.28 - 1119.76] acne wasn't even on the list anyway
[1117.76 - 1122.32] got some bacteria here and what that
[1119.76 - 1126.32] bacteria does
[1122.32 - 1127.92] that bacteria loves to eat
[1126.32 - 1129.84] viruses love to eat got a little bit of
[1127.92 - 1133.68] epstein-barr in you whoa it loves the
[1129.84 - 1133.68] love to eat that gluten yum yum yum
[1134.16 - 1139.68] there's over 30 there's over 30
[1137.12 - 1141.76] varieties of shingles there's over 60
[1139.68 - 1144.48] varieties of epstein barr
[1141.76 - 1146.64] and there's and there's over 50 groups
[1144.48 - 1148.40] of streptococcus and hundreds and
[1146.64 - 1151.84] hundreds of strains of strep
[1148.40 - 1151.84] and everybody's passing them around
[1151.92 - 1155.60] i got a friend that's like i just don't
[1153.44 - 1157.76] feel good these days i don't feel good i
[1155.60 - 1159.28] feel really tired my throat's really
[1157.76 - 1161.12] sore
[1159.28 - 1162.72] i said what you've been doing i don't
[1161.12 - 1163.84] know i don't know why i have this i
[1162.72 - 1165.44] don't know what's going on and
[1163.84 - 1168.72] what's happening did you meet anybody
[1165.44 - 1171.04] yeah i'm dating this new person
[1168.72 - 1173.52] i said you are yeah dating this new
[1171.04 - 1176.00] person and
[1173.52 - 1177.04] doing a lot of kissing i'm like okay
[1176.00 - 1179.76] well
[1177.04 - 1181.12] did it come on after that yeah it did
[1179.76 - 1182.24] well i think you need to clean up that
[1181.12 - 1185.04] strap
[1182.24 - 1186.88] i think you picked up a new strip you
[1185.04 - 1188.32] know um
[1186.88 - 1189.76] you can pick them up from the public
[1188.32 - 1191.52] bathrooms you can pick them up from the
[1189.76 - 1192.88] public toilets you can pick them up from
[1191.52 - 1194.96] restaurants
[1192.88 - 1196.72] i mean people get more probably the most
[1194.96 - 1198.56] strep comes from
[1196.72 - 1199.76] relationships and the and then i'd
[1198.56 - 1202.80] probably say the second
[1199.76 - 1206.32] is public places like restaurants
[1202.80 - 1208.56] people prepping your food um
[1206.32 - 1209.92] just strap just go strap just drips off
[1208.56 - 1212.72] of people's heads
[1209.92 - 1214.56] chefs in the kitchen they're just the
[1212.72 - 1216.08] kitchens are 100 degrees in a lot of
[1214.56 - 1219.04] these restaurants and
[1216.08 - 1221.12] sweat is dripping off their temples with
[1219.04 - 1221.60] strep in it and dropping in everybody's
[1221.12 - 1223.20] food
[1221.60 - 1224.64] here you go you got your you got your
[1223.20 - 1226.48] salad here it is
[1224.64 - 1228.96] get it to the table as fast as possible
[1226.48 - 1230.32] ring that bell
[1228.96 - 1234.72] are you guys i'm steaming up some
[1230.32 - 1237.36] asparagus and brussels sprouts
[1234.72 - 1239.60] jennifer can you tell me about oxalates
[1237.36 - 1243.04] my friend says they are in plants
[1239.60 - 1245.92] fruit that makes her sick
[1243.04 - 1247.36] well may as well just quit all fruits
[1245.92 - 1249.44] and vegetables
[1247.36 - 1250.56] never eat any fruits and vegetables ever
[1249.44 - 1252.08] again and then you'll end up on the
[1250.56 - 1256.16] carnivore diet where it's just
[1252.08 - 1258.08] meat and uh my god
[1256.16 - 1259.60] then you'll just age really fast because
[1258.08 - 1260.80] there's no antioxidants there's no
[1259.60 - 1262.08] anything
[1260.80 - 1264.56] so i'll give you a little rundown on
[1262.08 - 1266.96] oxalates oxalates is a theory
[1264.56 - 1267.84] it's a theory with no science behind it
[1266.96 - 1269.44] so
[1267.84 - 1271.12] that's one of the problems with all the
[1269.44 - 1274.48] theories
[1271.12 - 1277.12] is they get everybody in trouble um
[1274.48 - 1278.72] there's no real scientific study since
[1277.12 - 1280.32] everybody wants a study hey everybody
[1278.72 - 1282.16] wants to study here study there's no
[1280.32 - 1282.88] scientific study that actually has shown
[1282.16 - 1286.80] or proven
[1282.88 - 1288.96] in any way on any level that an oxalate
[1286.80 - 1290.96] causes any kind of issues with someone's
[1288.96 - 1293.44] health not even possible
[1290.96 - 1294.80] they haven't even found a link they
[1293.44 - 1297.92] haven't even found
[1294.80 - 1300.32] once there's not one study that can show
[1297.92 - 1302.08] someone getting oxalates from some kind
[1300.32 - 1302.88] of food and having a problem it doesn't
[1302.08 - 1306.72] exist
[1302.88 - 1308.88] so it's a theory number one number two
[1306.72 - 1309.84] um oxalates yeah they don't cause a
[1308.88 - 1314.08] problem
[1309.84 - 1315.92] um but and it oxalates and fruits and
[1314.08 - 1317.52] vegetables don't cause a problem
[1315.92 - 1318.96] but you know what happens is when you're
[1317.52 - 1321.36] really sick or you're you're
[1318.96 - 1323.04] you're you you're really toxic and you
[1321.36 - 1324.96] eat some fruits you eat some
[1323.04 - 1326.72] leafy greens you eat some vegetables
[1324.96 - 1328.08] you're gonna start cleansing possibly if
[1326.72 - 1329.12] you're really toxic and your liver is
[1328.08 - 1330.64] really toxic
[1329.12 - 1333.60] and you might experience something but
[1330.64 - 1336.24] yet if you gobble down some eggs
[1333.60 - 1337.76] the eggs just turn to glue and they seem
[1336.24 - 1339.76] like they go fine they seem like they
[1337.76 - 1341.84] work fine you eat some eggs it's like
[1339.76 - 1343.44] it's just turns into this gluey glop
[1341.84 - 1344.40] that sits in the middle of your stomach
[1343.44 - 1345.76] and
[1344.40 - 1348.40] sits in the middle of your digestive
[1345.76 - 1351.60] system and finds its way down over time
[1348.40 - 1353.76] and that gluey glop feels kind of easy
[1351.60 - 1355.76] and comforting and feels all right but
[1353.76 - 1358.24] when you're really toxic
[1355.76 - 1359.76] and you're you're you know you're eating
[1358.24 - 1361.12] you're eating arugula look at this
[1359.76 - 1361.68] beautiful arugula right here you're
[1361.12 - 1363.84] eating
[1361.68 - 1365.68] butter leaf lettuce every day and you're
[1363.84 - 1369.44] really toxic and you're eating
[1365.68 - 1370.96] you're eating basil it's antiviral
[1369.44 - 1371.92] antibacterial compounds you're eating
[1370.96 - 1373.44] basil
[1371.92 - 1376.72] you're going to start cleaning some
[1373.44 - 1379.04] stuff up you you have some onion which
[1376.72 - 1380.08] you're gonna get that sulfur that kills
[1379.04 - 1382.64] bugs
[1380.08 - 1384.16] and you're doing your lemons right and
[1382.64 - 1385.84] you're cleansing your liver
[1384.16 - 1387.44] you're gonna start feeling something if
[1385.84 - 1389.76] you're really really toxic and you know
[1387.44 - 1390.32] what if somebody put a spook in your
[1389.76 - 1392.88] head
[1390.32 - 1394.08] like oh it's oxalates that's what's
[1392.88 - 1396.72] going on
[1394.08 - 1399.20] meanwhile the funniest thing is the
[1396.72 - 1400.40] oxalate theory comes from people
[1399.20 - 1401.52] that the people they don't even know
[1400.40 - 1402.80] what's wrong with people they don't even
[1401.52 - 1404.16] know why people are sick they don't know
[1402.80 - 1405.60] why people have hashimoto's they don't
[1404.16 - 1406.96] know why people are sick with anything
[1405.60 - 1408.64] they don't know why people have any
[1406.96 - 1411.68] conditions
[1408.64 - 1413.52] and so why is everybody an expert
[1411.68 - 1416.80] why is everybody an expert about things
[1413.52 - 1419.68] like oxalates and leptins
[1416.80 - 1421.04] come on you're an expert you don't know
[1419.68 - 1422.40] why people are sick
[1421.04 - 1425.52] oh they're sick because of processed
[1422.40 - 1427.04] foods oh that's that's that's
[1425.52 - 1428.72] sick from processed foods that's why
[1427.04 - 1430.16] they're sick
[1428.72 - 1431.60] there's a lot of 80 year olds eating
[1430.16 - 1432.64] processed foods their whole life they
[1431.60 - 1435.12] ain't sick
[1432.64 - 1436.40] somehow there's 85 year olds 89 year
[1435.12 - 1437.92] olds eating gluten their whole life
[1436.40 - 1439.28] they're not sick you know why
[1437.92 - 1440.64] gluten makes somebody else sick and
[1439.28 - 1441.36] doesn't make somebody else sick it's
[1440.64 - 1443.20] because
[1441.36 - 1445.28] the 89 year old didn't have all those
[1443.20 - 1447.68] bugs all the streps and all the epstein
[1445.28 - 1451.20] bars and all the shingles and hhv-6s and
[1447.68 - 1454.80] h8v7s and simplex ones and simplex twos
[1451.20 - 1456.96] they didn't have all those so
[1454.80 - 1458.80] it's not lectins it's not oxalates
[1456.96 - 1460.56] there's real reasons why people are sick
[1458.80 - 1462.64] i love these theories that just co
[1460.56 - 1464.08] i don't know it's just incredible really
[1462.64 - 1465.44] i guess everybody has to play guessing
[1464.08 - 1465.92] games when they don't know why anybody's
[1465.44 - 1467.92] sick
[1465.92 - 1469.84] so it just goes around and then they'll
[1467.92 - 1471.76] blame it on jeans
[1469.84 - 1473.44] blame it on jeans blame it on the body
[1471.76 - 1475.76] attacking itself so all our genes went
[1473.44 - 1475.76] bad
[1475.92 - 1479.84] or your jeans are bad now your child's
[1478.08 - 1480.32] jeans are bad now your kids jeans are
[1479.84 - 1482.42] bad
[1480.32 - 1485.36] all our genes went bad in 20 years
[1482.42 - 1486.88] [Laughter]
[1485.36 - 1489.68] thousands of years ago by it all our
[1486.88 - 1489.68] genes went bad
[1490.48 - 1493.20] it's unbelievable
[1494.00 - 1497.76] i think i just saw a question was it a
[1495.28 - 1500.88] bone marrow question
[1497.76 - 1504.24] what about bone marrow failure
[1500.88 - 1506.00] amanda you know i've given a lot of
[1504.24 - 1508.08] information about that too
[1506.00 - 1509.68] a couple of different a couple of
[1508.08 - 1511.60] different clinics medical clinics over
[1509.68 - 1513.20] the years i used to lecture a lot
[1511.60 - 1514.88] and see a lot of doctor friends and
[1513.20 - 1516.08] medical clinics and stuff and
[1514.88 - 1518.24] and i used to tell them it's always the
[1516.08 - 1521.28] toxic heavy metals so
[1518.24 - 1524.40] uh bone marrow failure is
[1521.28 - 1526.64] it's mercury it's aluminum inside
[1524.40 - 1527.44] the bones a lot of mercury inside the
[1526.64 - 1531.28] bones
[1527.44 - 1531.28] a little bit of lead inside the bones
[1531.84 - 1535.44] that's where we get in trouble a lot of
[1533.28 - 1538.40] fluoride inside the bones a lot of
[1535.44 - 1543.84] fluoride inside the bones
[1538.40 - 1543.84] all right so i'm steaming these up
[1544.72 - 1548.48] anyway so you guys what to avoid well
[1547.04 - 1550.80] i'd stay away from gluten
[1548.48 - 1552.64] right some of you guys are probably like
[1550.80 - 1554.56] that's a no-brainer
[1552.64 - 1556.08] you know but everybody just seems to run
[1554.56 - 1557.60] back to it they're back on it
[1556.08 - 1559.52] one way or another they're doing gluten
[1557.60 - 1560.96] again and the reason why i think is
[1559.52 - 1561.60] because they just don't know really what
[1560.96 - 1563.04] happens and
[1561.60 - 1564.88] like i was showing you before gluten
[1563.04 - 1566.16] feeds every bug there is inside of her
[1564.88 - 1569.36] body
[1566.16 - 1573.12] esther says why do younger
[1569.36 - 1573.12] people have these bugs
[1575.60 - 1580.48] there's a lot more aggressive bugs than
[1577.12 - 1582.48] ever before mutated strains
[1580.48 - 1585.04] they get passed around a lot more now
[1582.48 - 1588.32] than they ever did in the past
[1585.04 - 1590.00] um you know that that's
[1588.32 - 1591.36] that's that's how it goes the bugs have
[1590.00 - 1595.44] mutated
[1591.36 - 1597.52] they're more they're more uh virulent
[1595.44 - 1599.84] so that's another thing too spreads so
[1597.52 - 1601.84] much easier
[1599.84 - 1603.60] years and years and years ago the first
[1601.84 - 1605.36] couple of epstein bars the first few
[1603.60 - 1607.84] epstein bars over the years didn't
[1605.36 - 1610.40] really spread so easy
[1607.84 - 1612.48] but they also manufactured a lot of new
[1610.40 - 1613.12] bugs so they manufactured a lot of new
[1612.48 - 1617.28] bugs
[1613.12 - 1617.28] so the private medical system
[1617.36 - 1621.12] um it's a little virus right here a
[1619.44 - 1622.00] little little epstein-barr to show you
[1621.12 - 1624.16] guys
[1622.00 - 1626.64] the private medical industry
[1624.16 - 1629.44] manufactured a lot of new bugs
[1626.64 - 1631.12] and they've been released and these new
[1629.44 - 1635.04] bugs have been released
[1631.12 - 1638.48] in the last probably 40 years
[1635.04 - 1641.20] they've been raised on eggs so
[1638.48 - 1643.12] pretend this is an egg when you got a
[1641.20 - 1644.00] little bit of egg matter floating around
[1643.12 - 1645.52] in your body
[1644.00 - 1647.04] and you got the epstein-barr virus
[1645.52 - 1649.20] especially a mutated one
[1647.04 - 1650.88] one of the newer strains you're gonna go
[1649.20 - 1653.20] in and eat that egg
[1650.88 - 1654.48] there you go and the egg's gone it's in
[1653.20 - 1657.28] the virus
[1654.48 - 1657.92] the virus multiplies easier so why are
[1657.28 - 1660.00] people
[1657.92 - 1661.12] why are younger people sicker now with
[1660.00 - 1665.04] pathogens
[1661.12 - 1666.80] is because just in the last 30 40 years
[1665.04 - 1668.32] they really let out a lot of them the
[1666.80 - 1669.92] private medical industry really let out
[1668.32 - 1672.08] a lot of new epstein bars a lot of
[1669.92 - 1673.76] mutated versions also
[1672.08 - 1675.76] when they go from person to person to
[1673.76 - 1677.60] person as the years go by
[1675.76 - 1679.44] they mutate and they become a little bit
[1677.60 - 1680.72] more virulent a little bit more virulent
[1679.44 - 1683.44] a little more virulent
[1680.72 - 1685.12] they spread easy too in restaurants not
[1683.44 - 1686.72] as easy as they did years ago i mean
[1685.12 - 1688.40] much more easier than they did years ago
[1686.72 - 1689.92] in restaurants
[1688.40 - 1691.52] there's a lot of reasons these are just
[1689.92 - 1693.20] some of them
[1691.52 - 1695.36] now we have toxins like we never had
[1693.20 - 1696.96] before we have so many toxins and
[1695.36 - 1699.12] chemicals and pollutions and
[1696.96 - 1701.20] we got not just pollution we're talking
[1699.12 - 1702.96] about air fresheners and
[1701.20 - 1704.40] and scented candles drop the immune
[1702.96 - 1705.68] system so we're losing our immune
[1704.40 - 1708.00] systems now too
[1705.68 - 1710.24] so the younger people are sicker than
[1708.00 - 1712.24] ever before with viruses and bacteria
[1710.24 - 1714.88] epstein bars and shingles because their
[1712.24 - 1718.56] immune systems are dropping
[1714.88 - 1718.56] more so than ever before in our history
[1718.64 - 1721.68] because they've never been exposed to
[1720.00 - 1722.88] the chemical companies to the degree
[1721.68 - 1726.40] they are so
[1722.88 - 1728.24] children now are eating chemicals 24 7.
[1726.40 - 1729.60] they're they're eating scented candles
[1728.24 - 1730.88] it's just breathing it in it's going in
[1729.60 - 1731.76] their mouth they're eating air
[1730.88 - 1734.32] fresheners
[1731.76 - 1735.12] colognes perfumes aftershaves the worst
[1734.32 - 1738.64] thing to have
[1735.12 - 1741.92] in the house dad throws on some
[1738.64 - 1744.00] aftershave and hugs hugs his child and
[1741.92 - 1745.36] that aftershave is so toxic and immune
[1744.00 - 1747.04] system lowering
[1745.36 - 1748.96] so these this is just this you know we
[1747.04 - 1750.40] have the toxins we have now and the
[1748.96 - 1752.08] heavy metals now too
[1750.40 - 1753.28] that are in all of this and in the
[1752.08 - 1753.76] pesticides the herbicides they're
[1753.28 - 1757.36] spraying
[1753.76 - 1761.20] more mosquito spray for no reason
[1757.36 - 1763.68] more mosquito spray more um
[1761.20 - 1764.72] west nile spray more fungicide on
[1763.68 - 1768.16] highways
[1764.72 - 1769.60] more herbicide in parks than ever before
[1768.16 - 1771.44] in our history
[1769.60 - 1772.88] it's fire retardant all over people's
[1771.44 - 1775.92] beds all over clothing
[1772.88 - 1777.60] fire retardant on couches it's all about
[1775.92 - 1779.04] killing our immune system so chemical
[1777.60 - 1781.12] companies want to destroy our immune
[1779.04 - 1784.00] systems apparently
[1781.12 - 1785.84] and then you have more violent strains
[1784.00 - 1787.52] of epstein-barr more mutated versions
[1785.84 - 1790.08] more mutated versions of shingles more
[1787.52 - 1793.20] mutated versions of hhv-6 h827
[1790.08 - 1794.08] off the chart the simplex simplex won
[1793.20 - 1797.12] the cold sore
[1794.08 - 1800.16] everybody has that there's like
[1797.12 - 1802.16] there's a dozen of those now easy dozen
[1800.16 - 1805.36] of those mutated now not everybody's
[1802.16 - 1808.64] simplex is the same simplex i remember
[1805.36 - 1810.16] i remember uh years ago somebody come in
[1808.64 - 1813.52] to me for help
[1810.16 - 1815.12] and they had a simplex they they went on
[1813.52 - 1817.60] a date and
[1815.12 - 1818.40] you know after the date they had a
[1817.60 - 1821.44] simplex
[1818.40 - 1824.00] on their tongue and
[1821.44 - 1826.48] it never went away it just it was a
[1824.00 - 1829.92] mutated version it stayed there
[1826.48 - 1832.64] it stayed there for like ever and they
[1829.92 - 1834.00] asked the other person did they have
[1832.64 - 1835.60] anything like that because they were
[1834.00 - 1837.52] like where did this and the other person
[1835.60 - 1838.96] said yeah i didn't disclose it to you
[1837.52 - 1840.96] and i didn't tell you but
[1838.96 - 1844.08] i've had that on my tongue too for like
[1840.96 - 1844.08] the last 20 years
[1844.72 - 1849.36] anyway and those cold sores when they do
[1848.08 - 1850.72] go away on people
[1849.36 - 1852.00] they're still in your system they go in
[1850.72 - 1853.52] the trigeminal nerve they cause
[1852.00 - 1855.44] trigeminal neuralgia a little bit
[1853.52 - 1856.88] shingles does too but it causes problems
[1855.44 - 1857.84] what i'm saying is we need to do things
[1856.88 - 1861.60] about it we can
[1857.84 - 1863.20] we can clean this stuff up it's nothing
[1861.60 - 1864.48] it's not about being you know you don't
[1863.20 - 1866.16] you don't have to be afraid of bugs
[1864.48 - 1868.00] that's not it you just you just clean
[1866.16 - 1870.72] them up and you don't feed them
[1868.00 - 1871.12] you don't feed them eggs that's an egg
[1870.72 - 1872.88] yolk
[1871.12 - 1874.88] it's not an egg yolk but you don't feed
[1872.88 - 1877.04] them you don't feed them eggs you don't
[1874.88 - 1880.16] feed them gluten you don't feed them
[1877.04 - 1883.60] milk cheese and butter
[1880.16 - 1885.28] and you can you can clean them up
[1883.60 - 1886.64] some are harder to deal with some are a
[1885.28 - 1888.24] little bit stronger some have
[1886.64 - 1889.60] a little bit more mutated some are a
[1888.24 - 1891.12] little bit more aggressive some people
[1889.60 - 1892.88] have more toxic heavy metals in their
[1891.12 - 1894.56] system some people have more
[1892.88 - 1896.24] toxins in their system some people have
[1894.56 - 1897.12] lowered immune systems because of these
[1896.24 - 1900.08] things
[1897.12 - 1901.60] and it's a little bit harder but yes you
[1900.08 - 1902.48] don't have to fear anything you just
[1901.60 - 1904.72] have to get better
[1902.48 - 1906.08] do the right stuff and get it out of
[1904.72 - 1908.56] your system clean up
[1906.08 - 1909.68] knock the stuff out kill it off is what
[1908.56 - 1911.20] you do
[1909.68 - 1912.88] and you kill it off you knock it out of
[1911.20 - 1915.20] your system and you move forward and you
[1912.88 - 1915.20] heal
[1918.84 - 1921.84] um
[1922.24 - 1926.00] what is the pan you're using check out
[1923.76 - 1927.80] my directory medicalmedium.com
[1926.00 - 1929.52] i got some kitchenware on there
[1927.80 - 1931.60] medicalmedium.com
[1929.52 - 1932.72] uh there's a kitchen kitchenware
[1931.60 - 1934.24] directory
[1932.72 - 1936.48] so i'm steaming up i don't know if you
[1934.24 - 1938.32] guys see this
[1936.48 - 1940.56] steaming up some asparagus some brussels
[1938.32 - 1942.08] sprouts
[1940.56 - 1944.32] they're just about done i'm making a
[1942.08 - 1946.72] salad i'm gonna cut up some potatoes now
[1944.32 - 1948.72] i'm gonna do that
[1946.72 - 1950.48] i'm doing the arugula potato asparagus
[1948.72 - 1954.64] salad if you guys just came on
[1950.48 - 1957.68] um is it right there
[1954.64 - 1960.84] medical medium new addition
[1957.68 - 1963.20] and that's that's what i'm making right
[1960.84 - 1965.68] now
[1963.20 - 1966.64] incredible having you guys here now what
[1965.68 - 1968.88] i'm doing is
[1966.64 - 1970.40] when i'm what i like to do in a pan is i
[1968.88 - 1972.32] like to steam these up in a pan
[1970.40 - 1974.24] and only put a little bit of water so
[1972.32 - 1975.44] the water eventually goes away
[1974.24 - 1977.36] and then they kind of get a little
[1975.44 - 1979.12] toasty in here so that when they go on
[1977.36 - 1980.88] the salad they're not going on the salad
[1979.12 - 1983.36] dripping wet with water
[1980.88 - 1984.88] right that's the way i like to do it
[1983.36 - 1986.88] instead they're like getting nice and
[1984.88 - 1988.64] toasty now i got the pan on high
[1986.88 - 1990.00] the water's already been evaporated
[1988.64 - 1993.04] they've already done some
[1990.00 - 1994.64] steaming in the pan
[1993.04 - 1995.92] and now they're getting a little toasty
[1994.64 - 1998.56] there's still some moisture in the pan
[1995.92 - 2000.56] so i really like it that way
[1998.56 - 2005.84] so let me start making a salad let me
[2000.56 - 2005.84] get some greens together in a bowl
[2006.16 - 2009.12] i'm going to chop up some butter leaf
[2007.68 - 2011.12] lettuce let me show you what i got you
[2009.12 - 2013.68] guys
[2011.12 - 2015.20] some butter leaf right here on the other
[2013.68 - 2019.84] side i have arugula
[2015.20 - 2019.84] i'm going to chop up a little bit
[2025.44 - 2032.32] i see my neighbors spraying the local
[2029.12 - 2033.84] council spraying around parks and rivers
[2032.32 - 2035.68] and they aren't even wearing mask or
[2033.84 - 2037.52] gloves people children and animals are
[2035.68 - 2038.64] all around them it makes me so angry
[2037.52 - 2042.48] yeah
[2038.64 - 2044.16] did you know and i've seen this
[2042.48 - 2047.92] did you know what's on the barrels of
[2044.16 - 2050.00] that stuff it's a skull and crossbones
[2047.92 - 2053.44] skull and crossbones did you know the
[2050.00 - 2055.60] guys that handle the barrels of chemical
[2053.44 - 2057.52] that actually eventually gets diluted
[2055.60 - 2059.12] and put into you know sprayed and put
[2057.52 - 2062.72] into parks and all that
[2059.12 - 2064.72] that same chemical they die really young
[2062.72 - 2065.84] it's a job you only have for like 20
[2064.72 - 2069.76] years and then you're done
[2065.84 - 2069.76] you're done it's horrible
[2070.48 - 2074.72] you know i i've seen photographs of
[2072.56 - 2077.92] those barrels
[2074.72 - 2077.92] skull and crossbones
[2078.00 - 2081.84] i mean seriously skull crossbones on
[2080.72 - 2086.08] those barrels
[2081.84 - 2087.68] i'm not kidding and guess what
[2086.08 - 2089.84] chemical companies want your babies to
[2087.68 - 2092.00] have it all over them in the park
[2089.84 - 2094.16] they want your babies to have it all
[2092.00 - 2097.44] children
[2094.16 - 2101.52] chemical companies i truly believe
[2097.44 - 2102.00] want people poisoned why else would they
[2101.52 - 2105.92] put their
[2102.00 - 2110.24] deadly chemicals in parks and why
[2105.92 - 2112.40] would counties and states and
[2110.24 - 2114.56] villages and wherever you live around
[2112.40 - 2117.52] the world
[2114.56 - 2120.24] why would they let that happen can
[2117.52 - 2120.24] someone tell me
[2120.69 - 2125.44] [Music]
[2122.16 - 2125.44] because i've always said it's a sick
[2128.84 - 2134.80] world
[2131.68 - 2136.88] see money says viruses can't live in
[2134.80 - 2140.24] carnivore blood that's why the carnivore
[2136.88 - 2140.24] diet works for autoimmune
[2143.44 - 2151.36] well so if you're on a carnivore diet
[2149.84 - 2153.68] wait viruses can't live in carnivore
[2151.36 - 2155.68] blood does that mean that okay so while
[2153.68 - 2159.84] you're on the carnivore diet i get it
[2155.68 - 2159.84] i get it um
[2160.24 - 2164.56] this is not true viruses feed off of
[2163.12 - 2165.52] toxic heavy metals and when you're a
[2164.56 - 2167.04] carnivore
[2165.52 - 2168.40] you're not eating any foods when you're
[2167.04 - 2169.68] doing the carnivore diet you're not any
[2168.40 - 2171.04] eating any of the foods to get the
[2169.68 - 2172.80] metals out
[2171.04 - 2174.64] so all your metals are sitting inside of
[2172.80 - 2175.84] you and the viruses will feed on the
[2174.64 - 2178.56] metals
[2175.84 - 2179.20] yeah i i give you this though i give you
[2178.56 - 2180.56] this
[2179.20 - 2183.28] you're not eating well you might be
[2180.56 - 2185.04] eating eggs if you're doing eggs on a
[2183.28 - 2186.40] carnivore diet you're feeding the heck
[2185.04 - 2190.88] out of those viruses
[2186.40 - 2192.56] big time if you're doing raw cheese on
[2190.88 - 2194.24] that carnivore diet you're feeding those
[2192.56 - 2195.44] viruses
[2194.24 - 2197.76] just say if you're doing eggs you're
[2195.44 - 2202.40] feeding the viruses okay
[2197.76 - 2205.04] right there now if your carnivore diet
[2202.40 - 2207.76] is corn fed
[2205.04 - 2209.44] it's corn fed you're feeding the viruses
[2207.76 - 2210.80] with the meat you're eating
[2209.44 - 2213.20] make sure none of your meat you're
[2210.80 - 2216.80] eating in a carnivore diet is corn fed
[2213.20 - 2218.56] okay and um but yeah i get it you
[2216.80 - 2220.16] removed your gluten you removed your
[2218.56 - 2221.68] milk cheese butter probably
[2220.16 - 2223.28] uh if you're doing the butter you're
[2221.68 - 2224.80] feeding your viruses so you
[2223.28 - 2226.40] i know people on a carnivore diet
[2224.80 - 2227.52] they're doing butter you're feeding the
[2226.40 - 2229.36] viruses they're doing eggs
[2227.52 - 2231.44] feeding viruses if you're only doing
[2229.36 - 2234.40] meat and meat only and you're eating
[2231.44 - 2235.68] just the animal flesh and that's it
[2234.40 - 2239.28] you're still going to have toxic heavy
[2235.68 - 2239.28] metals feeding the viruses in there
[2239.60 - 2242.32] and then you end up getting symptoms
[2240.96 - 2243.60] later so you can be on your carnivore
[2242.32 - 2245.52] diet doing okay and then you get
[2243.60 - 2247.52] symptoms later it happens all the time
[2245.52 - 2248.96] because eventually the viruses will
[2247.52 - 2250.24] still feed
[2248.96 - 2251.84] and here's the other thing too if you're
[2250.24 - 2253.12] on a carnivore diet and you're not doing
[2251.84 - 2254.40] any fruits and vegetables
[2253.12 - 2255.60] and you're not cleaning up the liver
[2254.40 - 2257.44] your liver is just going to get more
[2255.60 - 2258.96] beaten down more beating down more fatty
[2257.44 - 2260.16] more fatty and then more fat building up
[2258.96 - 2262.16] in your liver and
[2260.16 - 2263.84] your fat the fat builds so much in your
[2262.16 - 2265.28] liver that you end up having a problem
[2263.84 - 2266.72] and then boom you're
[2265.28 - 2270.56] you're sick anyway with other problems
[2266.72 - 2272.08] you got gout
[2270.56 - 2273.28] and then if you're on a high fat diet
[2272.08 - 2274.00] non-stop because you're just on
[2273.28 - 2275.28] carnivore
[2274.00 - 2277.12] so you're eating the high-fat diet
[2275.28 - 2278.08] non-stop you're burning out the adrenals
[2277.12 - 2279.52] over time you're going to get some
[2278.08 - 2280.80] adrenal fatigue and you're going to
[2279.52 - 2283.44] end up binging on some kind of
[2280.80 - 2285.20] carbohydrate
[2283.44 - 2287.36] i'm not ranking on the carnivore diet
[2285.20 - 2288.88] i'm just saying that
[2287.36 - 2290.72] you don't have a free pass on a
[2288.88 - 2293.36] carnivore diet
[2290.72 - 2294.48] i look you don't have a free pass on a
[2293.36 - 2297.20] vegan diet
[2294.48 - 2298.96] plant-based diet animal protein diet
[2297.20 - 2300.88] there's no free pass on any of it
[2298.96 - 2302.64] because if you're doing all these fats
[2300.88 - 2303.76] on a plant-based diet here so you don't
[2302.64 - 2304.88] have a free ticket if you're doing all
[2303.76 - 2305.76] this vinegar you don't have a free
[2304.88 - 2306.88] ticket
[2305.76 - 2307.76] if you're doing all this nutritional
[2306.88 - 2308.88] yeast you don't have a free ticket if
[2307.76 - 2310.16] you're doing all this caffeine you don't
[2308.88 - 2311.36] have a free ticket no one has a free
[2310.16 - 2312.16] ticket and they realize they really
[2311.36 - 2314.24] really
[2312.16 - 2317.04] really avoid everything and then clean
[2314.24 - 2317.04] up what's happening
[2317.68 - 2323.76] chopped up some arugula right here you
[2320.72 - 2326.80] don't have to chop this up
[2323.76 - 2328.40] but i i want to
[2326.80 - 2330.48] i don't care what diet you're on i don't
[2328.40 - 2332.64] care if a martian
[2330.48 - 2334.00] arrived on your back porch on a little
[2332.64 - 2336.16] spaceship
[2334.00 - 2338.56] and gave you a brand new diet from outer
[2336.16 - 2338.56] space
[2338.64 - 2341.76] if you don't know why you're sick or
[2340.08 - 2344.24] what causes your symptoms
[2341.76 - 2345.92] it's not going to be enough it's just
[2344.24 - 2347.36] not going to be enough you have to know
[2345.92 - 2348.16] what the cause of your problem is your
[2347.36 - 2350.32] symptoms
[2348.16 - 2351.28] why you're sick you have to that's a big
[2350.32 - 2353.28] part of it
[2351.28 - 2356.24] so i got some butter leaf lettuce i got
[2353.28 - 2356.24] some really good right here
[2356.40 - 2360.48] um so i'm gonna start putting some other
[2359.36 - 2364.00] i'm gonna start cutting an onion
[2360.48 - 2364.56] let's do that bev asked what oils do you
[2364.00 - 2368.24] cook with
[2364.56 - 2368.24] none nada
[2368.46 - 2373.12] [Music]
[2370.56 - 2376.08] don't need to just a little bit of water
[2373.12 - 2378.00] you don't have to cook in oils
[2376.08 - 2379.52] you know that whole rule of cooking with
[2378.00 - 2382.24] oils
[2379.52 - 2384.00] is really not necessary these are fat
[2382.24 - 2385.52] free meals so that you can get a break
[2384.00 - 2386.88] and your liver can get a break once in a
[2385.52 - 2390.48] while so you can just take a break i'm
[2386.88 - 2390.48] gonna slice up this onion right here
[2391.92 - 2398.24] um you can do white onion
[2395.28 - 2400.08] i like red onion too so i'll do red
[2398.24 - 2406.00] here's a white one right here too
[2400.08 - 2406.00] um but i'm gonna cut these nice and thin
[2406.56 - 2412.96] so i like keeping these fat free
[2410.96 - 2414.80] that's what i like to do because there's
[2412.96 - 2415.28] but there's fats like i said earlier i
[2414.80 - 2416.80] said i
[2415.28 - 2418.24] think i said earlier there's fats in
[2416.80 - 2419.68] everything there's fats in brussels
[2418.24 - 2421.92] sprouts there's fats in
[2419.68 - 2424.08] asparagus there's fats in lettuce butter
[2421.92 - 2426.96] leaf lettuce has omegas in it as i was
[2424.08 - 2426.96] telling you guys earlier
[2427.84 - 2431.36] so i'm cutting up some onion right here
[2431.76 - 2439.84] gonna put some red onion on the salad
[2440.00 - 2444.96] got some red onion so let me start
[2441.60 - 2444.96] putting some potatoes in here
[2445.04 - 2448.16] i'm gonna cut these up
[2448.64 - 2453.76] is there a test for viral issues
[2451.84 - 2455.52] mean there's some basic tests you can
[2453.76 - 2457.68] see if you have a
[2455.52 - 2459.84] infection of epstein-barr see if you
[2457.68 - 2462.96] have some epstein-barr titers
[2459.84 - 2466.16] but to be honest
[2462.96 - 2467.76] they don't know what viruses do
[2466.16 - 2469.28] and just so you know there before
[2467.76 - 2472.00] medical medium books were published and
[2469.28 - 2474.48] medical medium information came out
[2472.00 - 2476.08] um they didn't even know epstein-barr
[2474.48 - 2478.64] had a afterlife
[2476.08 - 2480.32] epstein barr has an afterlife causes
[2478.64 - 2483.84] hashimoto's thyroiditis
[2480.32 - 2486.88] causes ra rheumatoid arthritis causes um
[2483.84 - 2490.08] uh lupus causes lyme disease
[2486.88 - 2494.16] they didn't know that you know
[2490.08 - 2496.40] epstein-barr had an afterlife
[2494.16 - 2497.36] and the publication of this book the
[2496.40 - 2498.96] first edition
[2497.36 - 2501.04] the publication is first edition that
[2498.96 - 2503.36] came out years ago
[2501.04 - 2505.20] uh busted out the truth about what
[2503.36 - 2506.24] epstein-barr does and everything and how
[2505.20 - 2508.40] you can get the
[2506.24 - 2509.76] reactivation you can get you know the
[2508.40 - 2512.56] virus comes back
[2509.76 - 2514.00] comes out of dormancy again and sits
[2512.56 - 2515.52] inside your liver and all this stuff now
[2514.00 - 2517.36] science research is actually taking it
[2515.52 - 2519.20] seriously years later after i've already
[2517.36 - 2523.04] published the information
[2519.20 - 2525.52] and so it's interesting
[2523.04 - 2526.80] but they didn't even know they had no
[2525.52 - 2528.48] clue
[2526.80 - 2530.40] you know they thought epstein-barr was
[2528.48 - 2532.56] just mono when it went away and that's
[2530.40 - 2532.56] it
[2534.84 - 2538.24] so
[2536.00 - 2540.32] so i'm bringing the bowl over for now
[2538.24 - 2542.48] okay i got this virus in the way right
[2540.32 - 2546.08] here i got to move him
[2542.48 - 2546.08] it's a cute little bugger that virus
[2546.32 - 2550.72] move these asparagus over so here's the
[2548.56 - 2553.36] salad i'm making right here
[2550.72 - 2556.56] barbara butler i just joined what do you
[2553.36 - 2560.08] use to wash your organic vegetables
[2556.56 - 2561.84] look if i'm gonna cook them i use hot
[2560.08 - 2564.16] water
[2561.84 - 2566.24] so i use hot water i get a big old bowl
[2564.16 - 2568.72] and put some hot water in it coming out
[2566.24 - 2568.72] of the sink
[2570.08 - 2576.88] i use an unscented mild dish soap
[2573.76 - 2576.88] i like to do that too
[2577.68 - 2582.56] and in the water just a couple of drops
[2580.48 - 2583.20] i massage the vegetables massage the
[2582.56 - 2585.68] greens
[2583.20 - 2588.64] rinse it out a couple times and i'm good
[2585.68 - 2588.64] that's what i like to do
[2591.44 - 2596.64] massage your fruits and vegetables
[2596.72 - 2599.60] so i'm gonna put some asparagus in here
[2598.24 - 2601.28] i still got some other things to go in
[2599.60 - 2607.76] here too i got lemon
[2601.28 - 2609.12] i gotta make the dressing
[2607.76 - 2610.72] terry says you're helping make
[2609.12 - 2611.92] vegetables look yummy incredible
[2610.72 - 2613.68] incredible i'm really excited about
[2611.92 - 2616.24] these actually
[2613.68 - 2620.08] annette says can you explain driving an
[2616.24 - 2622.40] adrenaline surge
[2620.08 - 2622.40] lays
[2624.40 - 2631.28] um can you explain driving
[2627.84 - 2632.64] and adrenaline surges well adrenaline
[2631.28 - 2635.20] surges
[2632.64 - 2636.48] can happen we always have mild
[2635.20 - 2638.24] adrenaline surges
[2636.48 - 2640.32] so we always have mild ones whatever we
[2638.24 - 2642.40] do so anything we do
[2640.32 - 2644.72] all right our nervous systems are always
[2642.40 - 2647.04] hyperly attached to adrenals
[2644.72 - 2648.48] you get a phone call and you're nervous
[2647.04 - 2650.56] about the phone call your adrenals are
[2648.48 - 2652.00] going you're getting an adrenal surge
[2650.56 - 2653.68] you get some bad news on your phone
[2652.00 - 2655.12] somebody texts you maybe it's a friend
[2653.68 - 2657.04] or not a friend and they
[2655.12 - 2658.56] and they and they say some terrible
[2657.04 - 2660.08] things on your text or something and now
[2658.56 - 2660.88] you're just you're just shaking you're
[2660.08 - 2662.16] shaking
[2660.88 - 2663.52] and you're just like oh my god and
[2662.16 - 2664.88] you're sitting on your couch looking at
[2663.52 - 2666.32] your phone like what the hell just
[2664.88 - 2669.36] happened and you're shaking that's
[2666.32 - 2670.80] that's adrenal surge get some
[2669.36 - 2672.16] i mean anything could happen you hear a
[2670.80 - 2672.80] knock on the door and you're like wait a
[2672.16 - 2675.04] minute
[2672.80 - 2676.16] i thought i had a package delivery is it
[2675.04 - 2677.28] stolen and all of a sudden you get an
[2676.16 - 2677.84] adrenal surge because you think your
[2677.28 - 2680.24] package
[2677.84 - 2682.00] that was delivered was stolen where's my
[2680.24 - 2683.20] wallet i can't find it oh my god did i
[2682.00 - 2685.20] leave it at the grocery store you get
[2683.20 - 2688.24] adrenal surge
[2685.20 - 2689.92] so you adrenal surges all day long right
[2688.24 - 2691.36] you bump your head on the cupboard and
[2689.92 - 2692.08] you're like oh my god is this a
[2691.36 - 2694.08] concussion
[2692.08 - 2696.00] this really hurts i feel an egg growing
[2694.08 - 2697.52] on my head i got to get some ice
[2696.00 - 2699.04] should i run to the doctor should i call
[2697.52 - 2700.32] the emergency room you get your adrenals
[2699.04 - 2702.80] are surging
[2700.32 - 2704.08] it's just it's non-stop right so i'm
[2702.80 - 2705.84] just saying so and then
[2704.08 - 2707.92] the caffeine that's a big one right
[2705.84 - 2708.96] there that's that's every time you do
[2707.92 - 2711.76] caffeine
[2708.96 - 2713.68] you just put caffeine in your system and
[2711.76 - 2716.24] the surges don't stop
[2713.68 - 2716.96] they don't stop you guys you eat some
[2716.24 - 2719.36] chocolate
[2716.96 - 2720.80] those surges don't stop that's like you
[2719.36 - 2722.80] know if your package
[2720.80 - 2724.40] wasn't stolen or you've lost your wallet
[2722.80 - 2725.92] for five minutes and you found it your
[2724.40 - 2729.52] surges stop
[2725.92 - 2730.72] right but man caffeine it's got this
[2729.52 - 2732.40] evil twist to it
[2730.72 - 2734.16] once you get it in your system your
[2732.40 - 2735.12] adrenals have no choice they're sitting
[2734.16 - 2736.64] there panting
[2735.12 - 2738.32] they're panting they're surging they're
[2736.64 - 2738.96] surging they're surging you can't stop
[2738.32 - 2742.00] it
[2738.96 - 2743.92] it's just it'll surge for a day if
[2742.00 - 2745.12] caffeine will make them search for three
[2743.92 - 2746.80] days
[2745.12 - 2749.36] it just it'll make them search a little
[2746.80 - 2751.36] less when you're when it's wearing out
[2749.36 - 2752.72] but they'll still be surging it's like
[2751.36 - 2754.40] people live their life with their
[2752.72 - 2757.84] adrenal surging
[2754.40 - 2759.28] forced by caffeine and i think they're
[2757.84 - 2760.32] getting energy from caffeine i'm gonna
[2759.28 - 2762.24] put some um
[2760.32 - 2764.00] basil on here i got this beautiful basil
[2762.24 - 2766.00] leaves right here
[2764.00 - 2767.76] and what's really happening though is
[2766.00 - 2771.28] their adrenals are just
[2767.76 - 2774.80] just getting beat to crap really are
[2771.28 - 2777.04] from from from the caffeine
[2774.80 - 2779.44] so that surges them right there that's a
[2777.04 - 2783.04] big deal and then the high fat diets
[2779.44 - 2786.16] this meal right here won't surge
[2783.04 - 2789.20] it won't surge cause adrenal surge
[2786.16 - 2791.44] this meal won't it just can't there's
[2789.20 - 2792.96] if you dropped two tablespoons of olive
[2791.44 - 2796.00] oil on here
[2792.96 - 2797.60] and threw some pine nuts on here right
[2796.00 - 2799.28] tastes amazing probably right threw some
[2797.60 - 2801.20] tahini on here
[2799.28 - 2803.44] all that fat would then start thickening
[2801.20 - 2804.96] your blood right when it gets to what
[2803.44 - 2806.80] right when you eat it it gets down in
[2804.96 - 2808.40] here and now it starts to surge
[2806.80 - 2810.24] the adrenals start to surge because the
[2808.40 - 2811.92] fat is starting to absorb into your
[2810.24 - 2813.36] bloodstream and once the fat starts to
[2811.92 - 2814.88] absorb into your bloodstream
[2813.36 - 2816.56] your adrenals have to release all this
[2814.88 - 2819.20] epinephrine to thin out your blood so
[2816.56 - 2819.20] your heart
[2819.44 - 2822.48] so your heart doesn't have to pump so
[2821.68 - 2825.12] hard
[2822.48 - 2826.24] all that fat you put in it just makes
[2825.12 - 2829.12] your heart pump so
[2826.24 - 2829.68] i get it it's okay to have some tahini
[2829.12 - 2832.00] i'm not
[2829.68 - 2834.08] anti-tahini i'm not anti-hemp seeds
[2832.00 - 2837.28] anti-peanut buttery anti
[2834.08 - 2840.48] almond butter i'm not anti pine nuts
[2837.28 - 2842.32] i'm not anti avocado i'm not anti oils
[2840.48 - 2843.92] and if you love animal protein
[2842.32 - 2846.08] i support you but what what i'm trying
[2843.92 - 2849.20] to say is we don't stop
[2846.08 - 2851.76] no one gets a break it's 24
[2849.20 - 2854.24] 7 it's fats fats fats fats fats every
[2851.76 - 2855.52] single day and no one gets a day off
[2854.24 - 2857.28] your liver doesn't get a day off your
[2855.52 - 2860.32] adrenals don't get your day off
[2857.28 - 2862.32] your heart doesn't get a day off i mean
[2860.32 - 2864.88] i mean seriously your heart is up
[2862.32 - 2868.40] against that non-stop
[2864.88 - 2871.04] so nothing gets a break so it's like
[2868.40 - 2873.12] more fat hey more avocado oh the next
[2871.04 - 2875.36] day comes peanut butter and my oatmeal
[2873.12 - 2876.32] next day comes olive oil on my salad
[2875.36 - 2878.80] next day comes
[2876.32 - 2879.84] lots of chicken at night it's it doesn't
[2878.80 - 2882.88] stop
[2879.84 - 2883.52] pork chicken beef milk cheese butter
[2882.88 - 2885.52] eggs
[2883.52 - 2887.28] let me have an egg well there we go lots
[2885.52 - 2890.32] of fat again it just doesn't stop
[2887.28 - 2892.72] so then your heart is like it just
[2890.32 - 2895.12] doesn't stop and your heart has to pump
[2892.72 - 2896.88] it has to literally pump all that fat
[2895.12 - 2897.68] through and your adrenals have to thin
[2896.88 - 2900.32] out the blood
[2897.68 - 2901.04] it's just and then the plaque builds up
[2900.32 - 2902.56] the plaque
[2901.04 - 2904.32] all that plaque later on you're seven
[2902.56 - 2906.64] years old you got plaque on the arteries
[2904.32 - 2910.16] the veins
[2906.64 - 2912.56] veins start collapsing let me put some
[2910.16 - 2913.84] of this on here you guys
[2912.56 - 2915.76] putting these beautiful pieces of
[2913.84 - 2918.00] asparagus on here and then the other
[2915.76 - 2919.04] thing is toxins absorb in all that fat
[2918.00 - 2924.16] every time
[2919.04 - 2924.16] uh fat toxins fat soluble
[2924.72 - 2929.60] fat toxin soluble they just absorb into
[2928.72 - 2931.44] each other like
[2929.60 - 2933.84] perfectly so i'm putting a little bit of
[2931.44 - 2935.20] uh some brussels and some asparagus on
[2933.84 - 2936.08] here this is beautiful right here it's
[2935.20 - 2938.40] potatoes
[2936.08 - 2939.92] this is looking amazing it really is i'm
[2938.40 - 2942.72] going to drop some thyme on here that
[2939.92 - 2946.00] teaspoon of dried thyme
[2942.72 - 2946.00] put a little bit of that on here
[2946.08 - 2949.52] and i forgot the parsley i still have to
[2947.76 - 2950.24] put some parsley quarter cup of parsley
[2949.52 - 2953.52] on
[2950.24 - 2955.20] sorry you guys a little bit of thyme
[2953.52 - 2957.12] wasn't easy to come out let me chop up a
[2955.20 - 2960.24] little parsley
[2957.12 - 2964.88] okay and i got it right here all right
[2960.24 - 2968.96] i'm gonna chop this up so
[2964.88 - 2970.96] my job is just to teach you guys
[2968.96 - 2972.00] to give your body a break get the
[2970.96 - 2974.40] healing foods
[2972.00 - 2976.08] know what causes symptoms and conditions
[2974.40 - 2977.60] give you every chance to heal
[2976.08 - 2980.32] no one else is doing it i mean it's
[2977.60 - 2982.16] crazy it's it's like
[2980.32 - 2984.40] you'll listen to the best podcast guys
[2982.16 - 2985.68] or the best health gurus out there and
[2984.40 - 2988.24] they don't even know what causes
[2985.68 - 2990.80] sickness they're too busy reading matcha
[2988.24 - 2992.88] tea studies
[2990.80 - 2994.40] looking for some special antioxidant
[2992.88 - 2996.64] matcha tea
[2994.40 - 2997.92] paid for by the caffeine industry and
[2996.64 - 3000.00] then they'll end up thinking it's just
[2997.92 - 3001.44] your genes anyway that's why you're sick
[3000.00 - 3003.04] and they won't be trying to get metals
[3001.44 - 3003.76] out if they are they're trying to do it
[3003.04 - 3006.40] because
[3003.76 - 3009.92] i brought it to light spent 35 years
[3006.40 - 3014.96] teaching people about toxic heavy metals
[3009.92 - 3014.96] um it's not because i'm special
[3015.60 - 3019.44] that's for sure so i'm gonna put some
[3017.52 - 3024.24] lemon on here i looked everywhere
[3019.44 - 3024.24] tell me where to find your 369 protocol
[3024.96 - 3028.88] um get cleanse the heel if you can get
[3027.44 - 3030.72] it from the library if you can't afford
[3028.88 - 3033.92] the book even though it's on sale
[3030.72 - 3036.32] amazon.com it's 16.99 incredible price
[3033.92 - 3038.00] um it's a medical textbook but you can
[3036.32 - 3041.20] go to the library get it for free
[3038.00 - 3043.76] and 369 cleanse the advanced cleanse
[3041.20 - 3045.28] uh simplified cleanse original cleanse
[3043.76 - 3048.96] and you can pick the one you want
[3045.28 - 3048.96] the answers are in the books
[3051.12 - 3055.84] but you know and what i love about these
[3054.72 - 3059.36] foods is
[3055.84 - 3061.76] is that they're healing foods but
[3059.36 - 3063.20] when you combine healing foods with the
[3061.76 - 3064.24] fact that you remove the foods that are
[3063.20 - 3068.80] troublesome
[3064.24 - 3071.12] then you're moving forward you know
[3068.80 - 3072.64] so let's uh let's put a little lemon on
[3071.12 - 3077.92] top of here
[3072.64 - 3077.92] so basically i'm going to use a strainer
[3078.32 - 3083.84] so the seeds aren't going in here
[3086.64 - 3091.28] a couple tables a tablespoon of lemon is
[3088.64 - 3091.28] fine on here
[3093.36 - 3097.84] i can't wait to eat this thing
[3098.08 - 3100.88] here's the other thing about all the
[3099.36 - 3101.92] fats you keep on doing all the fats
[3100.88 - 3103.60] every day
[3101.92 - 3104.80] all you do is cause corrosion with the
[3103.60 - 3108.00] toxic heavy metals that are in your
[3104.80 - 3108.00] brain so let me show you this
[3109.60 - 3114.24] so metals are heavy
[3112.96 - 3116.16] and they don't just stay in the
[3114.24 - 3117.68] bloodstream that's why they can't find
[3116.16 - 3120.48] them no one can really find them
[3117.68 - 3122.00] and you get blood tests for it and but
[3120.48 - 3123.68] metals are heavy so they sit inside
[3122.00 - 3125.20] organs so they go deep inside organ
[3123.68 - 3127.04] tissue this they go deep inside your
[3125.20 - 3129.28] brain and that's when the ocd starts the
[3127.04 - 3131.12] bipolar starts anxiety depression starts
[3129.28 - 3134.56] the personalization starts
[3131.12 - 3137.12] schizophrenia starts whatever starts and
[3134.56 - 3138.00] um emotional ups and downs that can't be
[3137.12 - 3140.16] explained
[3138.00 - 3142.40] all of it so you get the toxic heavy
[3140.16 - 3145.20] metals and they sit inside the brain
[3142.40 - 3147.12] and um and then you eat all the fat so
[3145.20 - 3148.96] gobble down all the pork and the chicken
[3147.12 - 3151.28] milk cheese and the butter and the eggs
[3148.96 - 3152.24] and the almond butter and all the seeds
[3151.28 - 3154.64] and nuts
[3152.24 - 3156.64] and the peanut butter and oils and the
[3154.64 - 3159.84] coconut oil and what happens is
[3156.64 - 3161.76] all that all that fat in the bloodstream
[3159.84 - 3163.68] goes around the metal it starts to hit
[3161.76 - 3166.72] the metal and then the metal
[3163.68 - 3168.48] oxidizes fat causes the metal to oxidize
[3166.72 - 3169.68] and then it bleeds over into different
[3168.48 - 3170.56] parts of the brain and different
[3169.68 - 3172.08] different tissue and then your
[3170.56 - 3173.20] conditions get worse over time worse
[3172.08 - 3174.96] over time
[3173.20 - 3176.24] and electrical impulses have a hard time
[3174.96 - 3178.84] getting through the metal so it starts
[3176.24 - 3181.84] to get shocked in there
[3178.84 - 3181.84] and
[3181.92 - 3187.12] so so here's a half a brain
[3188.00 - 3192.24] so on this half of brain you got little
[3190.72 - 3194.08] metal deposits see i put these little
[3192.24 - 3195.68] deposits here these are big ones so this
[3194.08 - 3196.48] is just a demo that's not what it looks
[3195.68 - 3198.16] like
[3196.48 - 3199.68] you can't see the microscopic metal in
[3198.16 - 3201.84] brain in the brain
[3199.68 - 3203.44] unless it causes so much corrosion over
[3201.84 - 3205.36] time or it's a large enough deposit and
[3203.44 - 3206.24] then it causes a gray area gray spot
[3205.36 - 3208.24] dark spot
[3206.24 - 3210.00] or or some type of crystallization on
[3208.24 - 3210.88] the mri eventually as you as you get
[3210.00 - 3212.32] older
[3210.88 - 3214.80] and blood tests aren't accurate for
[3212.32 - 3216.56] finding metals and
[3214.80 - 3217.76] here they are so electrical impulses are
[3216.56 - 3220.00] firing through your brain they're
[3217.76 - 3222.16] hitting the metal deposits and it's like
[3220.00 - 3223.68] it's like what's wrong with you are you
[3222.16 - 3225.04] okay today honey
[3223.68 - 3227.60] i don't know what's wrong with me i'm
