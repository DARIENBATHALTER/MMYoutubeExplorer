58
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:04,880
of a lot of people's lives they

59
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:08,000
shape how they think

60
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:11,039
metals take over they

61
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,319
actually are like an alien in someone's

62
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,560
brain

63
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:17,599
they make people make decisions that

64
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,239
people wouldn't even make in their life

65
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,680
did you know that metals when they're

66
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:25,360
inside the brain

67
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:29,360
can control people control

68
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:32,319
people metals inside our brain

69
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,400
can control us that's something you

70
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:37,840
haven't heard right

71
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,160
metals inside the brain can trip us up

72
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,840
make us say things we don't want to say

73
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,959
in times of our life

74
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:48,319
metals in our brain can throw us off

75
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,720
our game in our life

76
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,879
that's what they can do they can give us

77
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,640
diagnoses that are brain related they

78
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,480
can cause us problems they can give us

79
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,440
brain fog

80
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,840
they can take us off our game like i

81
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,200
said

82
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:06,080
of life right and so

83
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,959
metals do some things with people they

84
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,080
do

85
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,440
they can get people depressed

86
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,000
when they're not supposed to be

87
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,200
depressed sad when they're not supposed

88
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,200
to be sad right

89
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,280
think about someone who spent years with

90
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,560
severe depression

91
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:25,120
think about that severe depression

92
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,879
because the metals inside the brain are

93
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,519
creating that situation

94
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,120
so think about how that shapes someone's

95
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,159
life

96
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:37,920
right toxic heavy metals

97
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:40,159
inside the brain and brain stem

98
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,080
shaping someone's life into something

99
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,159
that they may not have wanted to be

100
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,120
or something that was happening severe

101
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,840
depression

102
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,720
crippling panic and anxiety for years

103
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,760
that too

104
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,319
right so this is important this is so

105
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,959
critical to get metals out of us

106
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,680
so we can live free because you can't

107
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,280

108
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,680
free metals do shape things that we may

109
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,080
not

110
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,599
want shaped in the way they become

111
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,280
shaped and we don't like that

112
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,280
we want our lives free we want to be

113
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,239

114
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,599

is you're taking out

202
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,080
something out of your body that's

203
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:28,240
foreign it's a foreign invader

204
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,319
you're not supposed to naturally have

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,080
accelerating disease as you get older

208
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,080
you're not supposed to have that

209
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,919
that's that's literally like having some

210
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,479

211
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,280

that's what creates birth defects okay

287
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:40,240

341
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,560
best one it's so one that i trust i

342
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,360
don't trust

343
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,880
pacific spirulina anymore for a lot of

344
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,120
reasons

345
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,200
a lot of reasons i've talked about it's

346
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,880
terrible

347
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,680
and what you see is barley grass juice

348
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:08,000
powder not barley grass

349
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,519

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:17,839
right and then

353
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,720
you also see some wild blueberries these

354
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,079
are frozen wild blueberries i defrosted

355
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,160
right so there's a frozen wild

356
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:26,480
blueberries that are frosted

357
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,279
now you can't find frozen wild

358
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,800
blueberries

359
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:34,320

00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,800

ounces celery juice that's the next part

396
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:11,760
of the heavy metal detox cleanse if

397
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,240
you're sensitive and

398
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,680
you all this is a lot because you're

399
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,240
really toxic

400
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,720
your nerves are really sensitive from

401
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,480
all those

402
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,600
metals and all those pathogens and

403
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,880
there's someone that's sick with all

404
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,480
kinds of stuff going on

405
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,000
maybe do a little bit of celery juice

406
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,760
four or eight ounces

407
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,920
maybe do four or eight ounces of lemon

408
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,920
water maybe do that maybe do four or

409
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,399
eight ounces of the smoothie we're about

410
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,160
to do

411
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,600
and then you build up and you build up

412
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,160
and then you can feel like whoa i could

413
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,759
do more

414
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,600
i could do more you're getting the junk

415
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,199
out you're okay you're okay

416
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,040
you can do more you can do more and it's

417
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,560
incredible so that's one way of doing it

418
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,279
you guys so i have a celery juice right

419
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,639
here so 16 to 32 ounce celery juice

420
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,639
is a great thing there's a question on

421
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:53,279
tick-tock right there why is adding

422
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:55,040
water bad because you dilute the sodium

423
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:58,160
cluster salts the very thing that

424
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,759
magically helps us heal celery juices

425
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,959
phytochemical compounds that have to

426
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,839
stay

427
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,240
suspended in a living solution right

428
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,600
here

429
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,040
you don't want to dilute it you don't

430
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,320
want to add anything if you hear out

431
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,120
there someone adding lemon to their

432
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,800
cellar juice

433
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,480
they just lost what celery juice does

434
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,040
for them they just lost it

435
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,199
boom they just lost it another thing too

436
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,839
don't do hpp so when you go into the

437
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,240
store

438
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,600
and you see a celery juice that's in

439
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,920
like a brand

440
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,759
and the brand is in the cold section you

441
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,160
guys of the store the health food store

442
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,519
right

443
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,920
and it says fresh or just not just juice

444
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,000
but

445
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,759
it says fresh celery juice or something

446
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,079
and it's in a bottle

447
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,320
and it wasn't freshly juiced that day

448
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:40,639
instead it was manufactured right

449
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,160
off an assembly line okay that's called

450
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:43,839
high pressure pasteurization

451
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,360
you don't want that kind of celery juice

452
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,600
it doesn't work high pressure

453
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,240
pasteurization which is hpp

454
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,519
that's a trick so you just get full what

455
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,040
happens is in the health movement

456
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,920
everybody gets screwed over constantly

457
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,000
they don't know it

458
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,360
they throw away their money they get

459
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,759
they don't even know what's happening

460
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,639
they're buying hpp products that's not

461
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:05,439
fresh celery juice gotta make it fresh

462
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:07,439
or a juice bar makes it fresh for you

463
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,520
and that's a different story because

464
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,280
that's how you make it work

465
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,640
and then you might be somebody that says

466
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,839
hey i did celery juice and it didn't

467
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,640
work it's like well you've been doing

468
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,319
hpp

469
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,839
you've been adding lemon to it or you've

470
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,600
been doing something else

471
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:21,600
you're not doing the way it's supposed

472
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,679

thousands of dollars with that juicer

482
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,919
it's the only juicer that pays for

483
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,160
itself so that's the mm-900 hds

484
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,120

they guess that bentonite clay does but

592
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,039
it doesn't

593
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,760
they guess that charcoal might but it

594
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:50,080

so the wild blueberry is the star you

675
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,559
guys

676
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:48,480
it does so much right so

677
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:50,400
nutrition in the wild blueberry is

678
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,480
understudied so they don't even

679
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,240
they don't even have really the

680
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,520
understanding of why the wild blueberry

681
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,840
is so amazing

682
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,679
cultivated blueberries are weak they're

683
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,679
still good for you but they're weak so

684
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,480
the big cultivated blueberry in the

685
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,960
store

686
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,919
is actually a weakened version of this

687
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,400
right here

688
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:10,640
this is the original this is not just

689
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,400
heirloom but this is a wild food

690
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,480
and medical medium information is about

691
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,120
wild foods and it always was about wild

692
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,440
foods

693
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,880
medical medium information isn't fruits

694
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:22,320
and vegetables

695
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,600
it's wild foods that's something to know

696
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,159
and it's so important

697
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,000

706
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,679
here

707
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:48,080
blueberries can cross the blood-brain

708
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:50,720
barrier when they're wild

709
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,840
wild blueberries cross the blood-brain

710
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,120
barrier

711
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:56,000
important to know right there cultivated

712
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,600
blueberries

713
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,960
don't cross the blood-brain barrier

714
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:06,159
critical information right there to know

715
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,840
right so let's scoop some in we'll talk

716
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,640
about wild blueberries a little bit more

717
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,000
and a little bit more

718
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,919
right so these are frozen wild

719
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,320
blueberries right here

720
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:16,720
can't do lemon water even a tiny amount

721
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,159
do water in the morning if you can't do

722
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:22,559
lemon water

723
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:25,840
not even a tiny amount do regular water

724
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:28,880
that's okay let's do that right

725
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,919
or squeeze a tiny amount of lemon in

726
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,480
your water

727
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:34,400
if you can't do lemon now you might not

728
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,760
you might say you can't do lemon because

729
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,039
you've been told by your dentist that

730
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,200
it's bad for your teeth

731
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:41,200
don't stop it because of that reason

732
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:44,000
because that's not true

733
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,799
you might not do lemon because you think

734
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,799
it's

735
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:52,000
uh acidic and it's bad for you

736
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:55,360
it's not true it's alkaline lemon

737
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,679

738
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,440

00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:23,200
substitutions

750
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,039
for people who are afraid of bananas or

751
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,240
maybe they don't do good with bananas or

752
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:28,000
somebody that might have allergic

753
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:31,520
reaction to bananas sure

754
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,919
it's it's very possible right now

755
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,600
with the wild blueberry okay let's just

756
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:37,200
finish the wild blueberry information

757
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,720
though okay i was going to do it

758
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,399
add it a little later but i'm going to

759
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,360
do it now

760
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:45,520
all right so if you don't have frozen

761
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,840
wild blueberries

762
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,840
then pick up a wild blueberry powder

763
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:52,720
that's the vimergy wild blueberry powder

764
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,480
right so that's one option because some

765
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,440
people they can't get the frozen wild

766
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,720
blueberries

767
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,279
depending on where they are around the

768
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,320
world what they can get the vimergy wild

769
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,679
blueberry powder

770
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,240
so that's the best one right there that

771
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:06,480
i use okay so

772
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:10,640
i what i do anyways i put a little in

773
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,640
anyway with the frozen wild blueberries

774
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,799
so i'm gonna put some of that in that's

775
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:18,880
right there

776
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:18,880
i call that gold

777
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:25,600
got that right there i also put

778
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:27,360
the wyman's juice they got a new stock

779
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,919
and you guys know i work with wyman's

780
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,840
right

781
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:31,200
i'm making sure this product stays alive

782
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:33,039
stays out there

783
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,440
um because people don't realize what it

784
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:37,440
takes to harvest wild blueberries

785
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,279
and then actually squeeze it down to a

786
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,360
juice it's an incredible process

787
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:42,640
it's an incredible process so i actually

788
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,760
support

789
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:48,080
uh wyman's 100 with this juice it's and

790
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,570
it's an incredible product

791
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,120
you're if you're ever interested it's

792
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:53,520
[Music]

793
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,279
shop.wymans.com

794
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,360
they have it there i buy it by the case

795
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:59,360
you get like 13

796
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,200
discount off of each bottle when it's

797
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,679
that way so i put about two ounces in

798
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,039
here

799
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:06,480
right two to four out look if you don't

800
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:07,600
have wild blueberry frozen wild

801
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,440
blueberries you could do two to four

802
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,760
ounces of this in the smoothie

803
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,200
you can do that i just throw two ounces

804
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,320
in with my wild blueberries

805
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,080
and my vemma g powder but you know

806
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,559
the blueberry powder right but the point

807
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:23,360
is is you can do

808
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:24,159
um you can do two to four ounces of this

809
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:27,200
no problem

810
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:29,760
if that's all you have is this

811
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,279
so it's good to find other options in

812
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,919
case you don't have the frozen wild

813
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,360
blueberries

814
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:36,720
so here we go we've got that covered

815
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:41,840
let's go into banana land

816
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,840
two bananas right

817
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:47,840
one banana down another

818
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,000
we're talking about glucose right here

819
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:53,760
right now glucose

820
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:56,559
carries the properties

821
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:58,000
in the wild blueberry and the properties

822
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:00,320
in the rest of

823
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,240
of um the smoothie that we're going to

824
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:05,200
talk about carries the properties the

825
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:08,240
glucose carries to enter the cells

826
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:10,640
if someone's on like no carb

827
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,520
no sugar from fruit i'm scared of all

828
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,520
that

829
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,720
then how are you going to get the metals

830
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,200
out because

831
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,320
glucose is what carries every nutrient

832
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,640
into a cell

833
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:22,559
do you know how you can age really fast

834
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:25,200
you want to age really quick

835
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:26,159
don't eat any fruit don't ever eat any

836
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,080
potato

837
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,520
don't have any kind of critical clean

838
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:32,240
carbohydrate that's what i call

839
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,679
medical medium in the books critical

840
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,679
clean carbohydrates

841
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:38,240
don't have any of that be afraid of that

842
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:40,159
completely just do some vegetables and

843
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,720
some animal protein or some vegetables

844
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:42,880
and nuts

845
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,399
or whatever if you know people do and

846
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,000
and they like stay with that whole thing

847
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:48,480
where they they're afraid of sugar and

848
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,720
you will age so fast down the line

849
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,399
because you need the glucose to carry

850
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,039
the nutrients

851
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:57,360
in so now if you're afraid of banana i

852
00:30:55,039 --> 00:31:00,080
got alternatives right here okay

853
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,760
i got mango i'll crack one of these open

854
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:04,240
right

855
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,840
so i got mango that's an alternative

856
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,760
papaya's another one

857
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:10,320
so i'll have to get that out a little

858
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:12,720
bit but i got the mango

859
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,559
and you can do frozen mango so that's an

860
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,240
option too he's putting frozen mango in

861
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:17,679
here that's okay if you do that

862
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,360
you guys just got on here we're talking

863
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:21,760

00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:40,799
like it takes times that might not be

875
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,919
that beneficial right now while we're

876
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:44,480
doing the cleanse

877
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:46,960
but get a hold of the book page 179 the

00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,720
heavy metal detox cleanse is on here

879
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,559
critical to have the details the details

00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,480
matter the information's right here

881
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:54,000
we're doing this cleanse we just talked

882
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,760
about the wild blueberries now we're

883
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:00,880
adding the bananas

884
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:03,679
let's move on to something else cilantro

885
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:05,679
let's get cilantro in there now even if

886
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:08,080
you don't like cilantro

887
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:09,039
but you you you'll you'll put a little

888
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,600
in that's okay

889
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:13,120
put a little in then if that's what you

890
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,760
that's all you can do

891
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:17,840
right put a little bit in there can you

892
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,799
blend the papaya with the seeds i

893
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,120
wouldn't no way

894
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:22,799
no way the seeds are edible i've been

895
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,919
teaching that for years since i was a

896
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:27,440
child the seeds

897
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:28,880
are edible but you don't want the seeds

898
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,640
in the smoothie okay

899
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,760
if you want to eat a couple of teaspoons

900
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,799
of the seeds while you're eating the

901
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,200
papaya

902
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:36,000
right you can always do that but they're

903
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,200
spicy

904
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,559
and they're gritty very gritty you don't

905
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,159
want them in here there's no need to

906
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:44,399
have them in here

907
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:46,080
so we're putting some cilantro in here

908
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:48,240
let's do that

909
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,919
i like putting a lot of cilantro i like

910
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,799
having a cup of cilantro

911
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:55,679
right you can do less if you want you

912
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:59,519
can do a little bit more if you want

913
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:02,559
cilantro works really well

914
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:05,840
in removing toxic heavy metals

915
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:08,880
when it's got the other four

916
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:11,919
players involved that's

917
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:14,640
critical to know you want the cilantro

918
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:15,679
fresh and raw because it's got the

919
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:19,039
living

920
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:20,640
water inside of it if you don't like the

921
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:23,039
taste of cilantro

922
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,960
that means you're high in toxic heavy

923
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,760
metals all these tips are really

924
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,279
important

925
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,880
got the cilantro in there now we're

926
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:30,320
doing bananas so we don't need to crack

927
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,919
open the mango

928
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,519
i can maybe cut it open a little while

929
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:38,720
but we don't have to do that right now

930
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:41,600
so let's move on a little bit

931
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,039
what about cilantro tincture marcy nope

932
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,360
it won't do the same thing

933
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:47,440
not even close it won't be enough it

934
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,960
won't be enough with one dropper full

935
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,880
you'd have to use the whole bottle and

936
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,720
that's not going to work and be enough

937
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,000
so cilantro tincture is not the way to

938
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,559
go

939
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,080
i mean it's real listen if you don't

940
00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:00,159
have the cilantro you can't get the

941
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:02,080
cilantro keep it out of the smoothie

942
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:03,600
i'd rather have you keep that out of the

943
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:07,840
smoothie i'd rather have you

944
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,840
not do the cilantro tincture

945
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,639
okay then meaning like i'd rather have

946
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:13,760
you just not do any cilantro at all if

947
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,720
you're gonna use the tincture is what i

948
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,200
mean

949
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,879
so yeah so um try not to do that so we

950
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:21,839
got the cilantro in here let's move on

951
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:21,839
to a little bit more

952
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:29,679
let's get into the barley grass

953
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:32,240
juice powder now huge mistake

954
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:33,599
barley grass is not barley grass juice

955
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:35,440
powder you guys

956
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:37,679
barley grass is not barley grass juice

957
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:41,280
powder huge mistake made

958
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:43,839
you can't get the full benefits right

959
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,280
so this is the vimergy barley grass

960
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:47,280

967
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,040
it's been juiced this is the barley

968
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:06,160
grass juice

969
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:09,440

970
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:11,359

987
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,480
by the sales people who are pushing

988
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,960
chlorella

check into oh chlorella

993
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:04,960
hey claire clarell is good you know

994
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:07,440
don't get confused by all the admin

995
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,040
the thousands of them and the chlorella

996
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,359
trolls that are being paid

997
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:13,280
by the thousands of them being paid by

998
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:15,359
chlorella companies to try to

999
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,200
get that stuff out there don't get

1000
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:20,640
thrown off the track

1001
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:21,359
chlorella is dangerous for a lot of

1002
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,920
people

1003
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:24,400
how it's caused them to throw their guts

1004
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,720
up

1005
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,920
for weeks at a time hugging onto their

1006
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:30,240
toilet

1007
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,119
it's not properly checked with bacteria

1008
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:35,119
chlorella

1009
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:37,599
harbors bacteria it's a bacteria harbor

1010
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:39,520
not to mention even in a perfect world

1011
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:42,079
the best chlorella out there

1012
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:43,119
without bacteria will not get metals out

1013
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:45,839
of the brain

1014
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:48,560
so important chlorella is irresponsible

1015
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:52,000
it drops metal even if it picked it

1016
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,880
up important to know drops it that means

1017
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,200
if chlorella

1018
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,000
is moving metal it moves it into more

1019
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,079
tissue

1020
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,200
it doesn't carry it with it all the way

1021
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:01,760
out of the body

1022
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:03,200
do not get confused with chlorella which

1023
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:06,320
doesn't work

1024
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:08,160
with spirulina which does work very

1025
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,160
important to know

1026
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:13,280
okay and to answer a question i just saw

1027
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:16,000
barley grass juice powder is gluten free

1028
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,119
barley grass juice powder at least the

1029
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,320
let me correct that

1030
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:20,800
at least the vimergy barley grass juice

1031
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,800
powder

1032
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,320
is gluten free i can't speak for any

1033
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,520
other barley grass juice powder

1034
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:30,960
companies okay or whatever right

1035
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:32,720
frozen cilantro another question frozen

1036
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:35,359
cilantro is okay

1037
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,000
but use it right after meaning use it

1038
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:38,079
right when you

1039
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,760
pull it out of that freezer don't let it

1040
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:43,520
defrost and turn into yuck muck

1041
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,520
don't let the cilantro come out of the

1042
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:48,640
freezer and defrost

1043
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:50,640
in a bag or on the counter and turn into

1044
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:53,119
yucky muck

1045
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,720
it won't work it can only work when you

1046
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:55,119
throw that stuff in there while it's

1047
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,880
still

1048
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:58,320
frozen frozen state you throw it in

1049
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,680
there

1050
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,520
that's important to know all these

1051
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:04,640
details matter

1052
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:07,040
spirulina is critical

1053
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:08,160
for the heavy metal detox smoothie it's

1054
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,400
another star

1055
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:12,079
in the smoothie it's another star in the

1056
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,359
heavy metal detox cleanse if you're

1057
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:14,480
somebody that can only do a little bit

1058
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:15,680
do a little bit

1059
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,760
if you're someone that's you know that's

1060
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,599
someone that's sensitive to a little bit

1061
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,960
i mean a lot of sense of people do a lot

1062
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:22,400
but if you're someone you can just do a

1063
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,800
little bit of the smoothie a little bit

1064
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,000
of this

1065
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,839
a little bit of that in here a little

1066
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,640
bit of cilantro a little bit you can you

1067
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:30,640
can baby step it if you need to right

1068
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,480
and that's okay could do a quarter

1069
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,000
teaspoon instead of a teaspoon

1070
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,440
so there's the spirulina it's the best

1071
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,040
spirulina out there it's the bemergey

1072
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,280
spirulina by far

1073
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:41,200
the best stuff on the market i used to

1074
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,000
like the pacific many years ago this is

1075
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,680
the only thing

1076
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,680
that was out there that was decent

1077
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:48,000
enough but this supersedes it

1078
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,720
problem is pacific ocean has gotten real

1079
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,640
nasty

1080
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,160
i wouldn't swim in there if someone paid

1081
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,079
me to and someone said

1082
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,280
hey medical medium go surfing in the

1083
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:56,560
pacific ocean

1084
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,320
you know we'll give you ten thousand

1085
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,839
dollars every time you ride a wave in

1086
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,760
i'll be like no way am i letting that

1087
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:03,839
pacific ocean water touch me it's so

1088
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:07,680
polluted at this point with dioxin

1089
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:10,160
and metals it's out of control so anyway

1090
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,800
um keep that in mind that's that i don't

1091
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,920
recommend

1092
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:15,599
pacific spirulinas anymore not to

1093
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:18,480
mention i found something

1094
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:19,599
one of the pacific spirulina companies

1095
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,240
uh jar

1096
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:24,079
that i actually contacted company to

1097
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,440
talk to and they blew me off and it was

1098
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:26,560
dangerous what i found in one of their

1099
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,440
jars

1100
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:30,560
bottom line anyway spirulina right here

1101
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,640
got the vimergy

1102
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,240
so let's go let's keep on moving along

we're not sponsored by bimergy but your

1104
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:39,760

all right juice from one orange

1106
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,280
one orange here's a question that comes

1107
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,960
up all the time

1108
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,839

have to just do the juice from one

1113
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,160
orange

1114
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:00,720

if your coconut water is red toss it

1149
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,680
another scam

1150
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:19,280
in the world of health all right

1151
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,920
everybody just gets

1152
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,960
totally jaked over it's a major scam

1153
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,000
going on

1154
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:26,800
pink and red coconut water went bad it's

1155
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,760
rancid

1156
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,400
but the problem is okay coconut water

1157
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,800
companies

1158
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,000
lie and say it's good for you and it's

1159
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:37,440
the good stuff

1160
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,640
because if they don't lie and say that

1161
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,480
then they're not going to be able to

1162
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:42,720
sell as much coconut water because their

1163
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,880
coconut water is going bad

1164
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:47,119
that's what that means when it's red and

1165
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,319
pink that means the coconut water went

1166
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:50,640
rancid

1167
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:52,960
that's what happens so don't do the pink

1168
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:56,800
and red coconut water important to know

1169
00:41:52,960 --> 00:42:00,720

so we got the smoothie right there you

1312
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:03,440

1313
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,440
know

1314
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,839
something that's

1315
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,400
and i'm going to move this over

1316
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:15,760
so what i'm going to make

1317
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,839
something a little different here right

1318
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:28,800
so i'm gonna do the apples next okay

1319
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:30,960
apples

1320
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:34,480
are important in the heavy metal detox

1321
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:36,480
cleanse right

1322
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:38,960
but let me use my food processor for

1323
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,960
this one

1324
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:45,520
you don't want to do fats in the morning

1325
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:47,119
you don't want to do fats in the morning

1326
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,960
with a heavy metal detox cleanse you

1327
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:50,480
don't want avocado you don't want oils

1328
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,280
you don't want nut butters you don't

1329
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:53,280
want nuts

1330
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:55,520
you don't want any of that in the

1331
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,240
morning because once you do radical fats

1332
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:59,440
like that

1333
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:01,359
you just shut your cleanse down you just

1334
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:03,599
shut it down

1335
00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:05,599
you're doing all that work the heavy

1336
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:06,480
metal detox smoothie only can take out a

1337
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:08,960
portion

1338
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:10,480
a small portion of the metals when

1339
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:12,079
you're doing all that fat

1340
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,839
because if you're doing avocado with

1341
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:15,520
your smoothie i'll do the heavy metal

1342
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:16,079
detox smoothie but i'll throw a half an

1343
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,680
avocado

00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:19,520

apple but the pulp of the apple

1390
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:52,880
the pulp the pectin of the apple helps

1391
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:55,119
to carry out some of the metals

1392
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,400

1402
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,520
for a couple of minutes

1403
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:17,280
[Applause]

1404
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:20,960
right that's your liver right there

1405
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:22,800
okay your liver produces bile

1406
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:24,079
you're doing the heavy metal detox

1407
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:27,520
cleanse

1408
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:29,920
your spirulina your wild blueberries

1409
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:30,640
your cilantro your barley grass juice

1410
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:33,200
powder

1411
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:34,880
everything your celery juice all of it

1412
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:37,200
is working

1413
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:38,319
on getting those toxic heavy metals out

1414
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:40,800
of you to free you

1415
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:42,000
up free you up of conditions and

1416
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:45,520
symptoms

1417
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:49,599
right when all that enters

1418
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:52,559
into the liver it starts to loosen up

1419
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:56,400
the metals and grabs onto the metals

1420
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:56,400
and when it grabs onto the metals

1421
00:51:56,559 --> 00:52:03,280
the bile spews up the pipe

1422
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:06,319
and goes into the intestinal tract that

1423
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:08,319
bile has toxic heavy metal in it

1424
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:10,319
keep that in mind that bile has toxic

1425
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:13,200
heavy metal in it

1426
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:15,040
so and and the smoothie that you're

1427
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,400
doing in the heavy metal detox cleanse

1428
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:18,319
is already circulating throughout the

1429
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:21,599
entire body including the brain

1430
00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:25,040
taking metals out of the brain right

1431
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:28,960
but the liver is gonna volcano

1432
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:30,640
volcano that metal out into the bile

1433
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:32,000
the bile is gonna drop back into the

1434
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:36,079
intestinal tract

1435
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:40,880
right you guys and then the apples

1436
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:44,400
help to carry it out the pectin

1437
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:48,400
the pulp of the apple helps the bind

1438
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:51,040
onto that bile that's contaminated

1439
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:52,720
with toxic heavy metals and pull it out

1484
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:25,040
if you want don't worry

1485
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:27,119
you can eat the apple if you want if

1486
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:30,319
that's what you want to do that's fine

1487
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:31,200
i could totally do that right i toss the

1488
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:32,480
core

1489
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:34,400
you know i don't want to grind up the

1490
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:35,440
core so i toss the course if there's any

1491
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:39,520
questions there

1492
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:41,040
right you can do a half an apple you can

1493
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:42,240
eat a half an apple you can eat a

1494
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:45,599
quarter of an apple

1495
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:47,280
you can do that if you can't do the

1496
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:48,640
apple if you're somebody that's allergic

1497
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,000
to an apple if you're somebody that

1498
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:51,520
doesn't like an apple if you're somebody

1499
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,640
that just can't do an apple or you can't

1500
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:56,160
find an apple

1501
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:58,160
realize that your atlantic dolls

1502
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:59,440
is part of getting the metals out of

1503
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:01,359

00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:11,520
out of the intestinal tract you're still

1510
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:12,400
doing the spirulina which also helps to

1511
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:16,240
get it out

1530
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:57,839
anybody who just got on here i advise

1531
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:58,640
you to watch this from the beginning to

1532
00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:02,000
the end

1533
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:04,160
watch it on youtube or or a facebook

1534
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,520
allows us to see it because because i'm

1535
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:10,559
censored there a lot

1536
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:10,559
watch it on facebook can do that too

1537
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:19,520
so i'm making an apple sauce this is a

1538
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:21,359
fresh living applesauce right here

12 o'clock every day during the cleanse

1542
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:30,160

1543
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:33,040
in here

1544
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:34,400

row really quick

1625
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:46,880
mercury america bright mercury there you

1626
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:49,760

1628
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:55,920
sushi

1629
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:57,680
copper you guys there was a question

1630
00:59:55,920 --> 01:00:00,000
by the way there was a question

1631
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:02,559
yesterday that said well 14 karat gold

1632
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:05,119
18 karat gold why not 24 karat gold

1633
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:08,000
because 24 karat gold breaks

1634
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:09,200
it breaks it's not strong enough it's

1635
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:12,559
too soft that's why

1636
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:13,680
24 karat gold jewelry i mean you just

1637
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:15,119
you lose it

1638
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:17,440
you're on the beach and boom there goes

1639
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:18,720
your earrings gone you hit one wave and

1640
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:21,359
boom there goes your necklace

1641
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:23,440
gone you know you're on your paddle

1642
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:25,920
board boom you just lost your gold chain

1643
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:28,240
if it's 24 karat it just falls apart

1644
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:28,960
so that's why so 18 karat is the way to

1645
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:31,920
go

1646
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:33,440
14 karat if you can that's fine too but

1647
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:37,119
copper

1648
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:39,280

dementia

1822
01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:37,839

1823
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:42,720
who's younger

1824
01:06:37,839 --> 01:06:42,720
absolutely what else do i have here soda

1825
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:48,160
soda sipping off that aluminum right

1826
01:06:46,319 --> 01:06:50,160
here and the liners

1827
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:52,000
and i hope no one says oh but there's

1828
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:54,079
liners in there oh really

1829
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,760
because when that can constricts from

1830
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:57,359
being cold in the fridge the liner

1831
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:59,599
breaks

1832
01:06:57,359 --> 01:07:01,119
when that can expands because it's metal

1833
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:02,559
because you hold it in your hand and

1834
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:05,920
it's warming up at a cookout

1835
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:07,680
the liner expands and liner breaks

1836
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:09,200
there's there's not even liner and half

1837
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:10,559
the aluminum cans out there

1838
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:13,200
you don't know what brand has a liner or

1839
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:16,640
not most of them don't

1840
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:20,160
oh just sip off of it too okay

1841
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:24,079

1842
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:26,319

1843
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:27,680
there's no lead medical medium in

1844
01:07:26,319 --> 01:07:31,200
pencils

1845
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:32,079
so you're just wrong no but i've seen

1846
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:35,119
too many people
