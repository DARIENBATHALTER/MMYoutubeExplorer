[0.56 - 4.74] reprehensive information about trace
[2.70 - 6.72] minerals in this book you won't find
[4.74 - 9.60] anywhere else I'm reading it a section
[6.72 - 12.24] here about trace minerals versus toxic
[9.60 - 14.58] heavy metals that sit inside our brain
[12.24 - 16.56] to trace minerals in our brain connect
[14.58 - 18.96] to our very soul
[16.56 - 22.20] so trace minerals that are in our brain
[18.96 - 24.84] tissue connect to the soul our soul
[22.20 - 27.84] that's sitting inside of rain they hold
[24.84 - 30.06] information within them that connects us
[27.84 - 33.96] to the moon the stars
[30.06 - 37.50] trace minerals they Harbor information
[33.96 - 40.92] that connect us to the moon and stars
[37.50 - 43.80] the atmosphere The Ether the heavens it
[40.92 - 46.62] goes beyond textbook science it's beyond
[43.80 - 49.26] numbers it goes straight to the soul
[46.62 - 51.78] it's about everything people don't
[49.26 - 54.54] realize that happens inside the brain
[51.78 - 56.28] and what happens from above the
[54.54 - 58.38] connection that occurs from the physical
[56.28 - 60.48] to the metaphysical
[58.38 - 61.86] it goes beyond textbook science it goes
[60.48 - 64.92] beyond numbers
[61.86 - 67.38] Beyond right or wrong are good or bad
[64.92 - 70.32] trace minerals have both a physical
[67.38 - 74.16] presence and a purpose and a
[70.32 - 76.80] metaphysical presence and purpose that
[74.16 - 78.72] information is incredible wait till you
[76.80 - 80.94] read what's next to you guys I'm talking
[78.72 - 83.10] about trace minerals and toxic heavy
[80.94 - 85.14] metals but right now I'm talking about
[83.10 - 86.64] detailed information about trace
[85.14 - 89.04] minerals and how they connect our
[86.64 - 90.66] physical brain to above
[89.04 - 92.28] part of how that spiritual connection
[90.66 - 94.50] occurs
[92.28 - 96.66] so let's go into it a little bit
[94.50 - 99.12] trace minerals have both a physical
[96.66 - 101.40] presence and a purpose and a
[99.12 - 103.98] metaphysical presence and a purpose and
[101.40 - 105.24] along with macro minerals so I was
[103.98 - 107.16] talking about trace minerals now I'm
[105.24 - 109.38] talking about macro minerals trace
[107.16 - 112.56] minerals were meant to be the only
[109.38 - 115.68] metals inside our brain so check this
[112.56 - 118.44] out the only metals that are supposed to
[115.68 - 121.44] be inside your brain your friend's brain
[118.44 - 124.08] your loved one's brain our brain is
[121.44 - 127.20] supposed to be trace minerals because
[124.08 - 130.20] those are soft metals that are supposed
[127.20 - 132.78] to be inside our brain are those trace
[130.20 - 136.14] minerals trace minerals were meant to be
[132.78 - 139.14] the only metals inside our brain If
[136.14 - 141.54] trace minerals had brains of their own
[139.14 - 145.56] they would never think they'd be taking
[141.54 - 150.06] up residence in our brains beside the
[145.56 - 153.08] evil version of themselves good evil
[150.06 - 156.66] trace minerals that are in our brain
[153.08 - 160.38] good toxic industrialized heavy metals
[156.66 - 163.80] residing inside our brain evil trace
[160.38 - 165.84] minerals never would believe if they had
[163.80 - 168.92] their own brain that they would be
[165.84 - 172.92] taking up residence with evil
[168.92 - 175.92] industrialized toxic heavy metals
[172.92 - 177.96] so when a metal has been industrialized
[175.92 - 180.62] like a toxic heavy metal mercury copper
[177.96 - 183.66] lead aluminum arsenic goes on goes on
[180.62 - 185.82] any benefit as a trace mineral is
[183.66 - 189.48] completely destroyed for instance
[185.82 - 192.42] industrial copper is different than the
[189.48 - 194.64] trace mineral copper very important to
[192.42 - 196.32] know if everybody's all into copper like
[194.64 - 198.60] copper you need your copper you're
[196.32 - 200.94] missing your copper and the whole bit
[198.60 - 203.76] information in here clarifies all that
[200.94 - 206.76] we get confused with copper we hear no
[203.76 - 208.56] Copper's good we need lots of copper we
[206.76 - 210.36] hear that all the time what really
[208.56 - 213.06] happens is that when copper is
[210.36 - 216.60] industrialized that is when it's turned
[213.06 - 219.06] into a copper pot or copper pipe copper
[216.60 - 222.06] vessel to drink your water out of copper
[219.06 - 225.06] pot copper pipe or whatever it is it's
[222.06 - 227.94] now deformed and people don't realize it
[225.06 - 230.34] the copper is actually deformed any
[227.94 - 233.40] opportunity for it to be beneficial
[230.34 - 234.54] Trace mineral is now destroyed and
[233.40 - 236.94] that's what people don't realize
[234.54 - 239.28] whenever you industrialize copper now
[236.94 - 242.00] it's the evil not the good but people
[239.28 - 245.34] don't realize that professionals or
[242.00 - 247.56] experts in health don't realize that the
[245.34 - 251.10] residue of that copper pot or copper
[247.56 - 254.52] pipe or copper water bottle or copper
[251.10 - 257.10] kitchen tool or copper jewelry copper
[254.52 - 259.80] jewelry everybody's wearing now is not
[257.10 - 262.44] beneficial it cannot be used as an
[259.80 - 265.38] active bioavailable Trace mineral inside
[262.44 - 267.96] the body or brain anymore instead it's a
[265.38 - 270.72] destructive dangerous metal because it's
[267.96 - 273.78] been industrialized and denatured
[270.72 - 276.06] the Earth is partly made of living trace
[273.78 - 278.52] minerals and when they're kept in their
[276.06 - 280.74] natural state they can be usable by the
[278.52 - 282.72] body as long as they're in the right
[280.74 - 284.58] amounts for the right purposes then
[282.72 - 287.40] check this out
[284.58 - 289.38] forging Metals though removes the
[287.40 - 291.18] natural Earth's energy that exists in
[289.38 - 292.86] them so when you forge the metal and you
[291.18 - 295.44] want to make a nice piece of copper
[292.86 - 297.54] jewelry out of copper you purchase that
[295.44 - 299.52] was forged that was industrialized
[297.54 - 302.10] that's toxic when a metal is
[299.52 - 304.74] industrialized and forged it has lost
[302.10 - 307.20] its memory an industrialized metal has
[304.74 - 309.54] become toxic and destructive to our
[307.20 - 311.76] bodies its natural Nature has been
[309.54 - 314.10] disrupted and its active ability to
[311.76 - 316.50] participate for the planet's benefit has
[314.10 - 318.66] been lost so we're talking about good
[316.50 - 320.40] versus evil good trace minerals that
[318.66 - 322.80] reside inside our brain that keep us
[320.40 - 325.92] thinking that keep us going that keep us
[322.80 - 329.10] smart that keep us connected to above
[325.92 - 332.66] right all of that we're talking about
[329.10 - 335.28] the trace minerals versus evil Darkness
[332.66 - 337.14] industrialized toxic heavy metals that
[335.28 - 338.70] reside in our brain that have the dark
[337.14 - 340.62] Forces attached to it that
[338.70 - 342.90] industrialization
[340.62 - 345.12] so I'm reading out a brain saver you

[374.52 - 380.52] that's just mind-blowing
[377.46 - 384.06] toxic heavy metals are trace minerals
[380.52 - 384.78] worst enemy and vice versa so check this
[384.06 - 386.88] out
[384.78 - 388.62] toxic heavy metals are the worst enemy
[386.88 - 390.84] for trace minerals
[388.62 - 394.08] Trace mineral Metals natural minerals
[390.84 - 396.00] minerals that are inside our brain right
[394.08 - 398.76] at the same time trace minerals the
[396.00 - 400.68] worst enemy to toxic heavy metals one
[398.76 - 402.12] way they're sacrificed is that toxic
[400.68 - 403.92] heavy metals destroy the natural
[402.12 - 405.24] energetic and physical abilities of
[403.92 - 408.98] trace minerals so let's talk about this
[405.24 - 412.80] your trace minerals become sacrificed
[408.98 - 415.14] destroyed damaged by toxic heavy metals
[412.80 - 417.84] toxic heavy metals hold a destructive
[415.14 - 420.18] charge while trace minerals they're
[417.84 - 422.40] polar opposite betrays minerals inside
[420.18 - 424.62] your brain you guys are polar opposite
[422.40 - 428.16] of toxic heavy metals they hold a
[424.62 - 429.54] beneficial charge as neutralizers your
[428.16 - 431.16] trace minerals that you get from
[429.54 - 432.36] Everything Medical meme talks about from
[431.16 - 434.76] celery juice and all the different
[432.36 - 436.08] protocols and information and the brain
[434.76 - 439.14] shot therapies that are in this book
[436.08 - 442.20] here you wait till you see those what
[439.14 - 444.18] happens is that's your neutralizer trace
[442.20 - 446.22] minerals give up their existence and
[444.18 - 448.86] essentially get eaten up by trying to
[446.22 - 450.48] stop evil your trace minerals get eaten
[448.86 - 453.00] up inside your brain because they're
[450.48 - 455.28] trying to stop evil industrialize dark
[453.00 - 457.14] heavy metals that's what's happening
[455.28 - 460.50] inside our brains there's a battle going
[457.14 - 461.88] on in our brain with good versus evil on
[460.50 - 464.34] a physical level
[461.88 - 466.14] not just metaphysical 2 out there right
[464.34 - 467.88] the spiritual war that I've been talking
[466.14 - 469.14] about for years the spiritual war
[467.88 - 471.36] happening
[469.14 - 473.10] as neutralizers trace minerals give up
[471.36 - 475.74] their existence and essentially become
[473.10 - 478.50] eaten up trying to fight and battle for
[475.74 - 480.78] your life trying to protect you that's
[478.50 - 483.12] what trace minerals do and they go up
[480.78 - 484.92] against toxic heavy metals destructive
[483.12 - 487.02] charge
[484.92 - 489.00] here's another way trace minerals are
[487.02 - 490.86] sacrifice because toxic heavy metals
[489.00 - 493.62] make electricity in our brains run
[490.86 - 496.32] hotter more Metals you got in your brain
[493.62 - 499.02] the more the heat heats up the more the
[496.32 - 501.60] emotional anguish and frustration and
[499.02 - 503.64] depression and sadness and anxiety and
[501.60 - 505.56] bipolar starts to amp up and the
[503.64 - 508.80] depersonalization starts to amp up and
[505.56 - 513.36] the heat happens inside the brain
[508.80 - 515.76] the more trace minerals get eaten up
[513.36 - 517.44] and the more mental health struggles
[515.76 - 520.20] occur
[517.44 - 522.06] yourself up from the mental struggles
