[0.16 - 5.12] a lot of people are upset by stretch
[1.72 - 7.44] marks they feel that they feel upset
[5.12 - 9.40] they feel like betrayed they work so
[7.44 - 10.84] hard to lose their weight they work
[9.40 - 12.80] really hard and then they have the
[10.84 - 15.08] stretch marks and they're like wow I did
[12.80 - 17.52] all this work I got rid of some excess
[15.08 - 19.60] unwanted pounds and now I'm dealing with
[17.52 - 21.80] stretch marks reason for those stretch
[19.60 - 23.60] marks obviously is because you're
[21.80 - 26.56] expanding right when you gain weight we
[23.60 - 29.56] expand so then we get more more tissue
[26.56 - 32.76] growth if someone gains a few pounds or
[29.56 - 34.68] 10 lb 15 or 20 lb and they lose the
[32.76 - 36.84] weight some people their stretch marks
[34.68 - 39.80] are a lot worse than some other people
[36.84 - 41.88] the reason for that is the very base The
[39.80 - 44.60] Landmark I'm talking about that we want
[41.88 - 47.16] to protect and we want to support that
[44.60 - 49.40] very landmark and base it's deficient
[47.16 - 51.64] and it's saturated and soaked up with
[49.40 - 53.32] toxins and free radicals that have been
[51.64 - 55.92] there for years and it's deficient of
[53.32 - 58.00] things that it needs so that sponge got
[55.92 - 60.40] oversaturated with too much poisons
[58.00 - 61.68] fight ORF flight too many toxins right
[60.40 - 63.80] here at the base right here at the
[61.68 - 65.92] bottom too much adrenaline and it got
[63.80 - 68.00] damaged and when that base that bottom
[65.92 - 70.44] of that Derma gets damaged we don't it
[68.00 - 74.24] doesn't bounce back easy a staticity is
[70.44 - 76.36] gone collagen weakens we lose Vitality
[74.24 - 78.84] in the bottom of our Derma that's where
[76.36 - 79.88] it starts to really disappear and if
[78.84 - 81.48] you're dealing with somebody with a
[79.88 - 83.04] stagnant sluggish liver which is a big
[81.48 - 85.32] part of it all cuz that's saturated with
[83.04 - 87.36] toxins and poisons it doesn't help in
[85.32 - 89.92] fact that's a big deal on its own some
[87.36 - 91.76] people might have a really toxic liver
[89.92 - 94.00] because they're so toxic that the Derma
[91.76 - 95.88] got filled up with a lot more toxins and
[94.00 - 99.00] saturated with a lot more adrenaline and
[95.88 - 101.88] then when they lost the weight thees the
[99.00 - 105.32] elasticity is actually gone they don't
[101.88 - 107.68] have that play that room to play anymore
[105.32 - 109.96] it doesn't Revitalize easy it doesn't
[107.68 - 112.04] bounce back quick at all and then we
[109.96 - 115.56] have the stretch mark when it comes down
[112.04 - 120.36] to skin repair and has to start from
[115.56 - 123.20] deep down into the Derma it has to be
[120.36 - 126.08] down deep we got to go low you want to
[123.20 - 127.96] work on skin and keep skin good you
[126.08 - 130.36] don't want stretch marks taking over
[127.96 - 132.72] when you gain weight and then you lose
[130.36 - 135.80] the weight and you lost all the L right
[132.72 - 138.68] elasticity of the skin and you got the
[135.80 - 142.36] skin is is way too
[138.68 - 144.24] played and it's not bouncing back and
[142.36 - 145.56] everybody's trying to get the tummy tuck
[144.24 - 147.92] and they're trying to get all the
[145.56 - 149.88] different surgeries and Tucks their skin
[147.92 - 151.68] won't work with them or maybe you just
[149.88 - 153.16] gained a little bit of weight and then
[151.68 - 154.12] you got the stretch marks from a little
[153.16 - 158.08] bit of
[154.12 - 160.28] weight the way we have to address all of
[158.08 - 163.04] this is always remember no matter what
[160.28 - 167.08] that when we're addressing skin it has
[163.04 - 172.96] to be from the bottom up it has to be
[167.08 - 174.40] from the ground up so from the ground up
[172.96 - 178.76] it can't be
[174.40 - 183.20] surface it can't even be follicle
[178.76 - 185.40] level it has to be right at the base
[183.20 - 189.36] which is what I call the foundation of
[185.40 - 193.84] your skin deep within the Derma and
[189.36 - 197.36] right under the Derma right under the
[193.84 - 199.52] skin it's all about immune power it's
[197.36 - 202.56] all about immune system our immune
[199.52 - 204.48] system patrols that area our immune
[202.56 - 208.00] system needs
[204.48 - 210.48] antioxidants in that area antioxidants
[208.00 - 212.76] are one of the critical
[210.48 - 215.00] Builders right there by the way you guys
[212.76 - 218.60] know I work with vimergy this is the
[215.00 - 222.48] vimergy micro immune power with the
[218.60 - 227.04] organic bamboo silica this is the
[222.48 - 229.16] vimergy MSM with the bamboo silica we're
[227.04 - 232.84] going to be joining these two we're
[229.16 - 235.84] going to be putting these two together
[232.84 - 238.92] and vimergy is going to give anyone
[235.84 - 242.52] who's actually getting this a free lemon
[238.92 - 245.80] balm and 5% off of the MSM on top of it
[242.52 - 248.88] so what I love about the Skin Potion
[245.80 - 252.48] what I'm showing you is immune system
[248.88 - 252.48] and then building blocks for
[255.28 - 258.28] skin
