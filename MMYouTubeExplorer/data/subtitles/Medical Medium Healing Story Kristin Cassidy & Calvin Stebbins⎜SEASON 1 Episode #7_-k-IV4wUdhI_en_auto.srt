years ago now I would say now just a

32

yeah and yeah it's been quite some time

34
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:04,049
so and you were ten years old and you're

35
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:05,880
starting to happen and everything so so

36
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:07,799

00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:11,520
know and I could I could take like I

39
00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:12,810
just know when you guys reached out it

40
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,910
was your mom that reached

41
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:17,700
is that how it happened originally um

42
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:20,250
yeah my mom was the one that found you

43
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:23,069
I'm in a magazine and got this sort of

44
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:25,620
intuitive hit that this was someone that

45
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:27,690
could help us and we were at a point

46
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,390
where we were so desperate at that point

47
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:33,540
when we did find you and this had

48
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:36,330
started in January Calvin had started

49
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,709
with a just a just a stomach book just

50
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:41,520
an upper-respiratory thing like every

51
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:43,500
kid gets a normal cold and and then it

52
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:46,500
just it was having this abdominal pain

53
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,360
that just continued for months months

54
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,010
and months weeks and months and just

55
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,200
progressed and progressed and we went

56
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:53,910
through all of this we went through

57
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:57,060
everything that we could possibly yeah

58
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:59,310
by the time we had met you we were we

59
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,860
were at a bad place and it's just a very

60
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:04,709
very desperate desperate I was I was

61
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:08,880
just at a place of such desperation as a

62
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:12,290
mother it was just the most challenging

63
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:15,420
thing to have your child so sick and to

64
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:17,940
be so hopeless and our whole family you

65
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:19,590
know Calvin's dad and comes sister who's

66
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:21,150
a little older too we all you know all

67
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:23,190
of us together having to go through this

68
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:26,910
but I every day it was a it was a

69
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:29,160
full-time job every day to find

70
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:31,260
something that would work for him every

71
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:36,959
day I brought you I would bring you two

72
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:38,760
things you're old for a ten-year-old

73
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,769
that's got to be really hard

74
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,350
I mean I've talked about this for years

75
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:45,470
too but it's of course with mom goes

76
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:48,660
through because it's unimaginable to

77
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:50,730
when that's happening but then when

78
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:53,430
you're 10 years of age though it's

79
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:55,709
really confusing I mean and it's like

80
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:59,310
okay what's wrong here life was normal

81
00:03:55,709 --> 00:04:01,320
and then now I can't really function I

82
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:03,660
can't do anything and that's you know

83
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:06,239
you know and I remember being on the

84
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:09,359
phone with you and you were just

85
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:12,299
literally in tears but it was more of

86
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:14,850
was New York I mean it was he couldn't

87
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:17,789
get up and walk when I was on the phone

88
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:19,410
was right and and you told me he was his

89
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:21,630
spirit was so broken you been to the

90
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:23,970
hospitals you've seen all the doctors

91
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:24,780
seeing the best doctors around all of

92
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:26,640
this and

93
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:28,520
and that's a thing I always tell people

94
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:31,650
science and research doesn't have

95
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:33,570
information for people that we think

96
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:35,640
they do they think we think they have it

97
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:38,730
all set yeah it all down beat you

98
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:40,620
quickly fine now that's not true and

99
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:42,660
that's that I mean and so tell me a

100
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:44,130
little bit like what you remember were

101
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:47,340
you in pain because I remember you

102
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:49,470
wanting excruciating pain yeah I think

103
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:51,210
the hardest part to is in the medical

104
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:53,370
industry if they don't know what it is

105
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:55,620
then they say you have a mental illness

106
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:57,930
that was the biggest thing that we were

107
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:02,010
gone for evil that was 10 years old I

108
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:04,500
had this enormous amount of pain that I

109
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:06,630
could feel in my body and then mental

110
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:09,180
state was terrible because everybody was

111
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:10,590
saying I was crazy you know they wanted

112
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:17,669
to put me in the loony bin

113
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:19,919
pretty much unbeliev what people don't

114
00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:21,930
know about back in lolis I've been doing

115
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,400
this for 35 years people think I started

116
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:25,710
this yesterday meaning doing the work

117
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,750
we're doing on this and this is - going

118
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:29,280
on ten years with you guys but I think I

119
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,810
stirred this yesterday they think I just

120
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,190
popped out a book or I started some

121
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:36,870
celery juice thing but they don't know

122
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:38,550
that back in the back years ago and what

123
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:41,610
they did was they just told you it was

124
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:43,770
all in your head now they're teaching

125
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:45,150
you you're creating it that's the new

126
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:46,919
thing they're doing they're teaching you

127
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:48,810
you're gonna be eating it so it's like

128
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:50,400
your simple and your fault you're

129
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:52,650
creating it you're not attached to the

130
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,510
universe you're not attached to did some

131
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:56,910
things whatever and it breaks my heart

132
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:58,410
but the older days it was like it's in

133
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:01,380
your head can you imagine telling a 10

134
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:03,780
year old and and a 10 year olds mom that

135
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:06,180
he's making it up I mean he's an

136
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:08,370
absolutely excruciating pain he kills me

137
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:10,560
this is this yeah this is a stuff that

138
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:12,900
kept me going every day because it's

139
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,210
like we can't have this happen I mean he

140
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:18,840
went through a hell yeah I mean yeah

141
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:20,790
yeah it was hell on earth I mean yeah at

142
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,220
first it was confusing and then when I

143
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:25,110
got to the point where just before we

144
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:28,229
met you that was rock bottom

145
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:30,419
that was rocking like everybody I was

146
00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:32,760
tired everybody would just want to give

147
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:35,190
up friends some friends and family gave

148
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,930
up on me though you know so as a

149
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,770
ten-year-old that is the hardest thing

150
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,840
is

151
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:42,930
so yeah it's not just being like

152
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,639
excruciating pain you can't go and you

153
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:45,210
can't go and you can't play you're ten

154
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,039
years old

155
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:49,169
ya can't ride your bike you can't have

156
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,539
any fun you're bedridden yeah

157
00:06:49,169 --> 00:06:53,639
a men's family really does in certain

158
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:56,729
aspects of families not really trusting

159
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:58,470
in how you're young because they heard

160
00:06:56,729 --> 00:07:00,990
from a professional that well we can't

161
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:02,699
find anything wrong with him and that's

162
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:04,139
the thing science research doesn't know

163
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:07,050
what's wrong with anybody even has a

164
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:09,300
diagnosis anyway yeah so it's it's this

165
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:11,340
is exactly what's happening at but I

166
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:14,400
mean I can't imagine as a little kid and

167
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:16,289
I remember I mean I was like when I was

168
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,169
on the phone with you and talking to you

169
00:07:16,289 --> 00:07:21,900
and stuff oh yeah when I was hearing how

170
00:07:19,169 --> 00:07:23,970
you guys are being treated ya know with

171
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:26,819
Indiana medical industry I mean I've

172
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:30,270
seen it happen before but but when you

173
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:31,770
see with you know literally I mean you

174
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:33,569
were so choked up you couldn't even

175
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:36,120
speak I mean you couldn't even speak

176
00:07:33,569 --> 00:07:38,400
anymore and then yeah you said he can't

177
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:45,330
even get out of bed Anthony and no one

178
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:47,610
no one is helping yeah yeah I mean as a

179
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:49,169
mother like that was and you know

180
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:52,139
there's all those moments where I'm just

181
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:54,990
like you know I can't give up can't give

182
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:56,729
up on your child it's like you have to

183
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:58,529
do everything within your power and I

184
00:07:56,729 --> 00:08:02,490
had a big bag of tricks like I really

185
00:07:58,529 --> 00:08:04,110
thought I had you know I I was a you

186
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:06,060
know I was a practicing herbalist for a

187
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:07,409
really long time so which is incredible

188
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:09,449
Kalvin which is amazing how it like

189
00:08:07,409 --> 00:08:10,860
lived in the garden and I made all these

190
00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:13,080
things and that's what I treated him

191
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:15,240
with and so I knew a lot of alternative

192
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:18,300
healers and they were actually great

193
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:20,900
they they you know I went from phone

194
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:23,490
calls to people across the country i

195
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:25,020
exhausted all attempts of certain

196
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:27,029
doctors that I had and they could go so

197
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:29,069
far they went so far to support what

198
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:31,400
they could but really it was so out of

199
00:08:29,069 --> 00:08:34,450
their sort of you know realm of

200
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,450
[Music]

201
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:40,129
I used as sort of a last choice but I

202
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,319
mean we went through that whole process

203
00:08:40,129 --> 00:08:44,720
because he was in such pain I mean he

204
00:08:42,319 --> 00:08:48,379
was I'm like we gotta go the ER and get

205
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:51,050
him comfortable and so we did ER visits

206
00:08:48,379 --> 00:08:53,619
from our town we went to Dartmouth we

207
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:55,999
had to drive every time we drove him to

208
00:08:53,619 --> 00:08:59,059
the larger medical which was the

209
00:08:55,999 --> 00:09:01,040
Dartmouth Hitchcock in our he's like a

210
00:08:59,059 --> 00:09:05,029
snowstorm I was like why can't they be

211
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:06,860
either in a snowstorm or something he

212
00:09:05,029 --> 00:09:10,160
did the Scopes we did the blood test we

213
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:11,869
did heart ever to take your son hard to

214
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,559
take your child to all these different

215
00:09:11,869 --> 00:09:17,300
tests driving around I mean with no

216
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:19,639
answers sitting here on a wild goose

217
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,929
chase yeah it was it was unbelievable

218
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:24,050
and they also in some of their bedside

219
00:09:20,929 --> 00:09:25,939
manner was you know like after he did

220
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:27,470
his Scopes and I came in and then he

221
00:09:25,939 --> 00:09:29,329
started that stomach pain and he was

222
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:32,149
moaning because it was just a you know

223
00:09:29,329 --> 00:09:35,240
he just moaned all day long and she's

224
00:09:32,149 --> 00:09:36,470
told to be quiet and I thought okay i

225
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,779
wheeled him out of that day in a

226
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:40,970
wheelchair and he just says mom you know

227
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:44,089
they're not on our side you know my

228
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:45,559
moment I said to him you know what no

229
00:09:44,089 --> 00:09:47,269
they're not but but I'm here and I'm not

230
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:49,939
giving up and I'm gonna do whatever I

231
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:52,549
can and you know but and it just kept

232
00:09:49,939 --> 00:09:53,660
going and going and going and no answers

233
00:09:52,549 --> 00:09:55,549
I mean get through and it was a

234
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:57,949
full-time job I had to connect with all

235
00:09:55,549 --> 00:10:00,110
the doctors I actually fired a doctor if

236
00:09:57,949 --> 00:10:03,529
you do that hired someone else's his

237
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:09,589
primary because they were just not you

238
00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:10,249
do I'm not against doctors never was I

239
00:10:09,589 --> 00:10:12,649
know

240
00:10:10,249 --> 00:10:20,589
I know hundreds of doctors I talked

241
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:24,709
about some great but you got a fire you

242
00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:26,839
because like we just needed some other

243
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:30,199
support that just wasn't happening there

244
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:32,329
that's all well you know it's look

245
00:10:30,199 --> 00:10:34,730
someone may think 10 years ago it's not

246
00:10:32,329 --> 00:10:38,149
a long time ago that's a long time to

247
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:40,459
welcome kind of times were harder than

248
00:10:38,149 --> 00:10:41,930
chore with being recognized that you

249
00:10:40,459 --> 00:10:45,020
even have something

250
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:47,240
wrong with you you know but still this

251
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:49,310
is still happening today regardless but

252
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:53,600
it happened a lot more back then yeah

253
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:57,140
but but it's it it's it's tragic in the

254
00:10:53,600 --> 00:11:00,470
sense where because it's it's lingering

255
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:02,660
afterwards it's like it's the PTSD is

256
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:05,390
what I know you guys have gone through

257
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:07,100
you told me about it but it's the it's

258
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:09,310
the post-traumatic stress syndrome or

259
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:12,980
pts SS they call PT a

260
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:14,540
PT so many PTSS right cuz they're they

261
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:17,959
call it now it's a stress syndrome

262
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:19,610
version yes you know and but the bottom

263
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:25,160
line is you guys went through a lot of

264
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:27,350
that yeah I mean it was pretty much that

265
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:29,270
was just like a testing dummy for a few

266
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:31,700
months until I met you going into

267
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:33,310
doctors doctors are great but when it

268
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:35,779
comes to something that they don't know

269
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:38,510
it's a thing people if they if they

270
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:40,550
don't know something then they tend to

271
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:41,870
not like it so they tend to not focus on

272
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:43,820
it yeah and that's kind of what the

273
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:46,130
doctors did they didn't know what it was

274
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:49,339
so they didn't focus on it they picked

275
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:51,350
another excuse for it yeah which was a

276
00:11:49,339 --> 00:11:55,220
hard thing to do it was hard and like

277
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:56,959
you said the medical was just that there

278
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:58,400
was I was grateful for all the testing

279
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,410
to show but nothing would show up on his

280
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:03,680
testing so it was like nothing came in

281
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:05,900
to this this illness I want to bring it

282
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,730
back so you know you felt ill at first

283
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:09,860
and we're gonna talk about we're gonna

284
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:11,930
talk about what happened and along the

285
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:16,930
way your recovery what I saw we're gonna

286
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:20,300
go and talk to but wondering what was it

287
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:23,330
we're gonna cover back in yeah yeah but

288
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:27,740
like as far as like as you were getting

289
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:29,990
worse and and and the pain was there I

290
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:32,000
mean rock-bottom was you were just

291
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:34,790
laying in bed yeah couldn't walk

292
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,010
couldn't walk yes I couldn't even walk

293
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:39,020
across the floor it hurts so bad the

294
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:41,390
vibration that's what you said right

295
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:45,230
yeah is there any member any harm bring

296
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:47,720
him anywhere you told me he couldn't be

297
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:51,050
carried you told me that Dad had to

298
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:54,790
carry him around yeah we would carry him

299
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:56,770
you carry yeah yeah right sometimes yeah

300
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:58,720
yeah and that if you walk the you could

301
00:12:56,770 --> 00:13:01,990
your steps were just even just stepping

302
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:04,420
was so pain stinky yeah until he

303
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:06,340
couldn't really scary

304
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:09,070
yeah and that was when as Calvin said

305
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:11,170
that rock-bottom to a feeling like you

306
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:12,880
like you said you think you've got that

307
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:15,220
there's gotta be someone out there who

308
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,650
knows something like you it's been six

309
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:19,720
months almost of just everything and

310
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:21,040
hitting a wall hitting along and having

311
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,710
people in your life like I had some of

312
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,180
my best friends the time show up and say

313
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:26,770
you know what are you doing to get in

314
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:29,260
the way of this healing why aren't you

315
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:31,150
having my license he's gonna end up in a

316
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:32,740
diaper if you don't and I'm like I can't

317
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:34,800
go down the road of fear with you I'm

318
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:37,000
sorry it's uncomfortable to watch this

319
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,910
you can't Ramanan what it's like to live

320
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,780
it I always yeah but I know I'm on there

321
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:42,490
what you're saying I'll look at

322
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:44,470
everything you know we could try to

323
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:47,080
psych her out they wanted to put him on

324
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:52,330
these meds that I couldn't even believe

325
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:53,320
you know it's just I got you know it was

326
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:54,550
just like all right we're gonna do we're

327
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,590
gonna cover everything to the point

328
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:59,260
where we feel but the biggest thing was

329
00:13:56,590 --> 00:14:00,580
just like everything that we got out of

330
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,750
this and when I got out of it too is

331
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:03,670
just like I had to follow my gut

332
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:06,490
instinct I'm like I know that it's not

333
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:08,200
in his head I know that everyone in

334
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:09,820
everyone around me was saying you're

335
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,260
doing the wrong thing you're doing the

336
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,640
wrong thing he's gonna end up here and

337
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,800
you're you know you're gonna regret this

338
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:16,930
what if he what if he dies and you're

339
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,240
gonna regret doing you know and I felt

340
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:21,490
like every test he got it just didn't

341
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:25,360
help you know and even worse than

342
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:28,630
general a ten-year-old just wants to

343
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:34,020
play yeah be happy yeah and eat

344
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:37,660
he went to snowboard a ten-year-old boy

345
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:41,410
doesn't lay in a bed and purposely just

346
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:44,470
go into a mental state to die yeah it

347
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:46,000
doesn't happen but but that's and even

348
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:48,520
in the thing is and I've been talking

349
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,980
about this for years is that you lose

350
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:54,460
friends you know who your friends are

351
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:56,680
you know who your friends are and then

352
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:59,080
you lose them to you you know who you do

353
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:01,240
have his friends and then you know who

354
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:03,900
isn't your friend or isn't you know

355
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:08,250
because they can't put some type of

356
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:12,150
belief system they can't put that

357
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:14,190
they put that ahead of you knowing your

358
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:16,680
son softly yeah and put that ahead of

359
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:18,390
you you know of your son suffering you

360
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,370
know they do and I think people do that

361
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:22,530
because it makes them feel better that's

362
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:24,270
enough that's what yeah it makes them

363
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:26,010
feel comfortable to whatever they

364
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:27,950
believe in how science and research has

365
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:31,200
the answers because you're doubting

366
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:33,120
science and research and that that makes

367
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:35,010
them uncomfortable because people want

368
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,440
to feel safe you're not you're not

369
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:40,830
seeing the chronic illness is growing

370
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,660
exponentially it's it's populating the

371
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:45,360
population on the planet is basically

372
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:47,280
suffering at this point I mean because

373
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,840
people are hurting because yeah I mean

374
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,850
it's just the u.s. alone there's so many

375
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:55,200
people sick I mean in with symptoms but

376
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:57,960
this was this was grave at the point it

377
00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:01,020
was yeah it was grave it was really

378
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:03,450
really really hard for you guys but it

379
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:05,040
look like I said it's it's people want

380
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:07,290
to feel better notice that that's what

381
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,060
they do so though they'll turn against

382
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:11,000
you or they won't believe you because it

383
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:13,140
makes them feel comfortable because

384
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,270
that's another thing it's the most

385
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,710
bizarre thing but it's true it is and I

386
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:20,480
think a lot of it I just I mean when my

387
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:22,680
friends came to me I I was just still I

388
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,850
recognized that was just their fear they

389
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:26,760
were afraid and there was nothing they

390
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:29,760
could do and I did understand you know

391
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:31,170
that you know that I said to just you

392
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,880
know I just got to do what feels right

393
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:34,740
to me even though it was really just a

394
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,830
few people in our lives who were on our

395
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:40,920
same page yeah just a few everyone else

396
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:42,570
just all the teachers means that you

397
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:44,550
know you're just a lot of other family

398
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:46,050
members I mean in the friends too I mean

399
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:47,640
they just didn't know they were just

400
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:49,260
probably as confused but they didn't

401
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:51,150
live the daily every day that was so

402
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:54,150
excruciating and to even hear him in

403
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:55,740
pain and for us to to feel that you know

404
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:58,140
and have trouble sleeping and it was

405
00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:00,090
just so much I had him watching videos

406
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:01,230
we were watching Jeff Dunham and even

407
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:03,450
though I felt it was a little

408
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:05,550
inappropriate at the time the puppet guy

409
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:07,589
I just knew that laughter was needed

410
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:08,970
because it was we were like I just feel

411
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:10,980
like my spear was breaking and I was

412
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:12,569
scared of that like I was starting to

413
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:14,280
head that's when I wasn't even

414
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:16,260
comfortable going and I couldn't give up

415
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:20,870
but I was at that moment where yeah I

416
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:20,870
was I was sitting at the table going

417
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:26,300

00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:49,510
would talk to me and tell me what's

540
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:51,370
going on and give me the vision of the

541
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:53,470
internal is internal working so I could

542
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,910
see in there as well a whole bunch of

543
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:56,110
white light comes down many of you

544
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:58,660
probably know I've talked about this

545
00:22:56,110 --> 00:23:01,270
before I go partially blind and then I'm

546
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:03,760
able to see inside the person so that's

547
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:06,370
how it works so what was happening with

548
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,950
him he had a virus viruses I talked

549
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:12,820
about now viruses I talked about before

550
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:15,250
they came to me and advanced information

551
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:18,700
about virology that doesn't exist

552
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:20,680
anywhere and and so what happens who

553
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:22,720
that's responsible for chronic illness

554
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:24,370
and why people suffer and I try to keep

555
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,340
on teaching that there but what happened

556
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:30,100
was I saw a viral issue inside of him

557
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:31,540
and it was in the shingles family it was

558
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:33,610
actually in the shingles family now

559
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:37,030
children can get the shingles and it

560
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:40,270
won't rash out that's how it works

561
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:41,860
they're too young to have it rash out

562
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:43,750
because it's a different form of

563
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:46,030
shingles there's over 30 varieties of

564
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:48,000
shingles right now out there many of

565
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:50,860
them are non rashing that children get

566
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,020
adults can get non-rational ones too but

567
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:54,470
this is what variety of virus that

568
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:57,320
wasn't the problem is with this fire

569
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:59,570
it creates so much pain now an adult can

570
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:02,419
have shingles and they know the pain it

571
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:04,190
creates the outside rash the amount of

572
00:24:02,419 --> 00:24:07,399
nerve pain it creates now when its

573
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:09,440
internal like this it's it's so

574
00:24:07,399 --> 00:24:11,570
debilitating you can't walk you can't

575
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,269
function you could barely eat you can

576
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:16,279
barely even move and you won't you felt

577
00:24:14,269 --> 00:24:18,440
kind of almost seized up and pain from

578
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:23,720
your from your lower abdomen to the top

579
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:25,700
here right where he was like you know

580
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,049
you're dreaming weird like your dream

581
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:31,639
remember you said something about your

582
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:33,529
dreams yeah and I'll talk about why it

583
00:24:31,639 --> 00:24:35,419
wasn't right and then it's interfering

584
00:24:33,529 --> 00:24:37,730
with and so people he just doesn't wanna

585
00:24:35,419 --> 00:24:39,710
do homework I'm like no you know he's

586
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:41,600
like I can't get my brain so he's gonna

587
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:43,759
live he's gonna he's gonna he's gonna

588
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,379
lay in a bed and just waste away and die

589
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:51,070
because he doesn't wanted you home yeah

590
00:24:45,379 --> 00:24:53,480
makes sense right ten years old yeah

591
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:58,190
yeah you know I didn't want to do any

592
00:24:53,480 --> 00:25:01,430
homework when I was a kid but I would

593
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:04,469
just throw throw my notebook my homework

594
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:04,469
[Music]

595
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:13,639
that was that was how I handle it I know

596
00:25:12,169 --> 00:25:15,110
you would handle the same way he didn't

597
00:25:13,639 --> 00:25:17,690
want really doing you just wouldn't do

598
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:20,090
it yeah but you did your homework that's

599
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:22,340
not it you did exactly and all that but

600
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:25,159
it's unbelievable and so the shingles

601
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:27,440
virus that herpetic family virus it's in

602
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:29,960
people have if you think you don't have

603
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,429
the shingles viruses in yeah I got I got

604
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:34,009
it just give you this wake up called

605
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:35,659
everybody does think there's different

606
00:25:34,009 --> 00:25:37,549
varieties and they come out at different

607
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:39,559
times they give people in there Appa

608
00:25:37,549 --> 00:25:41,509
thee to give people jaw pain trigeminal

609
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:43,070
neuralgia to get people migraines they

610
00:25:41,509 --> 00:25:45,620
give people fatigue they give people a

611
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:47,779
lot of problems and that's what the

612
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:49,879
shingles virus does and those are just

613
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:51,440
some things that it does and and so it's

614
00:25:49,879 --> 00:25:53,980
amazing now it was interfering with

615
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:56,480
sleep because it releases a neurotoxin

616
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:58,100
viruses when they're really hyperactive

617
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,470
like that when you come down with an

618
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:03,019
infection like that like Calvin did it

619
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:04,759
releases a neuro toxic chemical that

620
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:05,120
floats around all through the body and

621
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:07,010
even

622
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,660
to the brain it can disturb sleep it can

623
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:10,309
create sleeping issues can make dreams

624
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,700
weird it could do all these kinds of

625
00:26:10,309 --> 00:26:13,790
stuff

626
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:15,170
now it's advanced information you're not

627
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:16,850
gonna hear this stuff anymore and that's

628
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:18,890
what other thing is because we're kept

629
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:21,320
in this weird bubble of no one has

630
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:23,480
answers I don't care the best the best

631
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:25,070
authors the best doctor offers the best

632
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:27,110
whatever all these people out there they

633
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:29,030
don't have the answers science research

634
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:30,140
doesn't so we're kept in this bubble of

635
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:32,150
just try this try that

636
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:34,880
go get your blood work oh it's this it's

637
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:37,040
that in and so but this is really

638
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,720
complicated information so just try to

639
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:42,710
rewatch this again to understand how the

640
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:45,110
show - works and the bottom line is when

641
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:47,059
it gets into the lymphatic vessels -

642
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:49,730
because that's what happened it got into

643
00:26:47,059 --> 00:26:54,110
your lymph glands from your down from

644
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:56,360
your lower groin and was spreading yeah

645
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:58,850
yeah it's spreading so what happens is

646
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:00,410
when it gets in there it then swells up

647
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:02,150
around the vagus nerve around the

648
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:03,620
phrenic nerves that run to your chest so

649
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:04,970
you got the vagus nerve and your phrenic

650
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:07,100
nerves that run down through your neck

651
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:09,470
down into your chest right here they get

652
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:12,230
inflamed from the neurotoxins from the

653
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:14,240
shingles virus it can seize you up it

654
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:17,120
could get everything - not only hurt in

655
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:19,340
severe critical pain but it could get

656
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,559
get your chest tight it could make it so

657
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:24,620
you can't walk it could cause so many

658
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:27,500
complications and difficulties and so

659
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:29,390
and these viruses if you don't when they

660
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,860
get like that and you don't jump on it

661
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:32,600
and you don't do the right things they

662
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:34,910
could go like this and be like this

663
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:36,770
forever I mean for years but we jumped

664
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:38,480
on this we got it taken care of and he

665
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:40,820
doesn't have to worry ever again yeah

666
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:43,280
but this was a shingles virus infection

667
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:46,040
it got into the lymphatic vessels they

668
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:48,320
got into nerves and in the thing is with

669
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:50,000
abdominal nerves are so sensitive that

670
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,010
all you need is a viral infection

671
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,470
touching all those different abdominal

672
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:57,140
nerves and and it's it's crippling and

673
00:27:54,470 --> 00:28:00,410
for a ten-year-old to pierce that scary

674
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:03,530
thing you you did an amazing job you

675
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:06,110
protected your son yeah because because

676
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:08,179
of how you know you were mindful about

677
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:11,179
alternative medicine you were mindful

678
00:28:08,179 --> 00:28:13,960
you're you have a yoga studio you still

679
00:28:11,179 --> 00:28:15,760
have a yoga studio now there's Erin into

680
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:17,380
he's been eating out of the garden you

681
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,919
know when he was in trouble you have the

682
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:20,679
garden

683
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:23,919
you guys were organic food right yeah

684
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:26,169
there's that's a miracle that's why I

685
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:28,210
don't dislike all of alternative

686
00:28:26,169 --> 00:28:30,429
medicine or alternative thinking you

687
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:32,320
know now we see the alternative medicine

688
00:28:30,429 --> 00:28:33,940
world still is messed up - just like

689
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:38,190
conventional but there's so many great

690
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:38,190
things you guys are even working about

691
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:44,620
but the thing is is that that was a

692
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:47,559
blessing because moms out there they

693
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:51,070
don't have that and they they get stuck

694
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:52,690
in the conventional way and then what do

695
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:54,399
you do where do you go from there they

696
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:57,010
don't they don't take they don't they

697
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:59,049
don't reach out for something else or

698
00:28:57,010 --> 00:29:01,299
they don't they just stay within the

699
00:28:59,049 --> 00:29:03,309
perimeter of what they have a

700
00:29:01,299 --> 00:29:06,640
conventional system or the thought

701
00:29:03,309 --> 00:29:08,830
process there and then a virus like this

702
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,080
now could get really severe it could

703
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:13,779
create a problem then the then the

704
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:16,179
children may get a diagnosis of like ALS

705
00:29:13,779 --> 00:29:18,490
or they may get a child did he make yet

706
00:29:16,179 --> 00:29:20,590
another diagnosis of something else or

707
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:22,450
some see severe critical multiple

708
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:24,730
sclerosis or they run you through 20

709
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:33,070
more tests and they end up injuring you

710
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:34,690
in those 20 yes I've watched this it's

711
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:36,220
painful I talk to doctors that have

712
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:38,320
watches me I've seen some amazing

713
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:40,270
doctors out there talk about you know

714
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:46,270
other doctors that have not seen the

715
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:49,090
signs yeah yeah and so so your your your

716
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:51,460
motherhood your mother powers were

717
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:54,159
really on I mean you are really an all

718
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:55,539
moms powers are on they're all doing the

719
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:58,450
best they can and don't have

720
00:29:55,539 --> 00:30:01,330
opportunities you know you guys were

721
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:03,220
able to find me yeah and and and so yeah

722
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:05,409
I mean but you don't know what you don't

723
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:07,779
know you know and so that's in like you

724
00:30:05,409 --> 00:30:09,340
said to that even when we found you you

725
00:30:07,779 --> 00:30:12,640
said you were caring for a lot of

726
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:14,679
children and a lot of them will end up

727
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,360
strapped to a hospital bed which I knew

728
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:17,770
that that was sort of the mean I just

729
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:19,570
felt like that was trajectory we're

730
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:20,860
headed if they were you know everyone's

731
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:22,000
like just put him on psych meds why

732
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,850
isn't he on psych meds and I just

733
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,119
thought you don't get it

734
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:28,339
IIIi will lose him

735
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:31,249
we'll lose him and you know and you said

736
00:30:28,339 --> 00:30:38,119
that that was you know I know I was

737
00:30:31,249 --> 00:30:40,699
harsh no you are you didn't you weren't

738
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:43,009
her salt what what look this is my what

739
00:30:40,699 --> 00:30:45,859
you said that was I was so worried you

740
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:47,749
were but no you just said you are right

741
00:30:45,859 --> 00:30:49,249
because I said I know it's not his head

742
00:30:47,749 --> 00:30:52,879
and you said you are right in that

743
00:30:49,249 --> 00:30:53,989
moment it was just to me like okay like

744
00:30:52,879 --> 00:30:56,719
my gut instinct

745
00:30:53,989 --> 00:30:58,459
I mean mom's just that's like the

746
00:30:56,719 --> 00:31:00,499
greatest thing like go with your gut no

747
00:30:58,459 --> 00:31:02,529
matter what people say or do and we had

748
00:31:00,499 --> 00:31:05,359
everyone around us in my world just

749
00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:07,129
doubting every move you are being a

750
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:10,129
terrible mother I mean I got I got stuff

751
00:31:07,129 --> 00:31:12,289
coming at me and I just thought you know

752
00:31:10,129 --> 00:31:13,939
what I have to keep going I have to keep

753
00:31:12,289 --> 00:31:15,799
going and have to keep sticking to here

754
00:31:13,939 --> 00:31:17,749
because I will lose him if I even think

755
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:20,779
to do what everyone is telling me to do

756
00:31:17,749 --> 00:31:23,329
so when you just you just stepped in and

757
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:26,389
said you're right it's not in his head

758
00:31:23,329 --> 00:31:27,979
you're right it's like okay so you kind

759
00:31:26,389 --> 00:31:29,569
of pulled me up from that spirit so I'm

760
00:31:27,979 --> 00:31:31,189
just like you just kind of hang on there

761
00:31:29,569 --> 00:31:32,689
you keep going with us keep going with

762
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:34,279
this and that's why it was like we

763
00:31:32,689 --> 00:31:35,959
talked a lot and you said put him on

764
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:38,899
this will do that there was only a

765
00:31:35,959 --> 00:31:40,129
certain amount of food available to we

766
00:31:38,899 --> 00:31:45,919
did a lot of bananas we did a lot of

767
00:31:40,129 --> 00:31:48,199
well you guys were in Vermont I mean I

768
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:49,939
come from me I know what it's like in

769
00:31:48,199 --> 00:31:54,229
the winter I know it's like when there's

770
00:31:49,939 --> 00:31:56,929
nothing there you know and just it's a

771
00:31:54,229 --> 00:31:58,939
difficult situation and but it was like

772
00:31:56,929 --> 00:32:02,809
okay well what do you have what's there

773
00:31:58,939 --> 00:32:04,279
you know what kind of it was it was sort

774
00:32:02,809 --> 00:32:05,359
of like a mono diet in some way and

775
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:07,129
you're like no that's fine that he's

776
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:09,889
having a lot of bananas it's fine and I

777
00:32:07,129 --> 00:32:12,619
drove 45 minutes to an hour every week

778
00:32:09,889 --> 00:32:14,929
to go to Whole Foods so I had more fruit

779
00:32:12,619 --> 00:32:16,189
and possibility and I was making things

780
00:32:14,929 --> 00:32:18,229
that weren't so great for you because

781
00:32:16,189 --> 00:32:26,779
you couldn't have meat and things like

782
00:32:18,229 --> 00:32:28,099
that no because in order to it doesn't

783
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:29,449
mean you have to be off animal protein

784
00:32:28,099 --> 00:32:31,729
the rest of your life right but what it

785
00:32:29,449 --> 00:32:33,679
is and this is where belief systems can

786
00:32:31,729 --> 00:32:34,249
completely stop somebody from healing

787
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:36,379
yeah

788
00:32:34,249 --> 00:32:37,090
if someone's book it believes or doctor

789
00:32:36,379 --> 00:32:39,040
believes now the

790
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:40,330
or protein or a family believes animal

791
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:42,370
protein is going to be the answer you

792
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:44,710
can't not eat animal protein in this

793
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:47,260
situation you wouldn't be here right now

794
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:49,060
yeah so anybody who's playing bass this

795
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:49,930
is kudos for you or whatever I mean you

796
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:51,790
guys are you know because you

797
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:53,920
plant-based believers or really they're

798
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:56,560
really strong on their belief system and

799
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:57,910
they fight a fight you know unless they

800
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:09,070
get a symptom and then they run back to

801
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:11,950
animal protein but the point is the

802
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:13,330
bottom line is is that the reason why we

803
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:14,860
had to go off the animal protein for you

804
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:16,780
which is a huge step for a ten-year-old

805
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:19,300
boy yeah I mean that's a huge step the

806
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:21,970
reason is because the high fat in the

807
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:24,370
bloodstream lowers oxygen levels so we

808
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:26,830
won't have a good chance of healing the

809
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:30,010
virus your virus is in your blood

810
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:31,840
it's in nerves it's in organs and then

811
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:34,210
if the blood fats too high because

812
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:36,130
you're having chicken fat cuz chicken

813
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:38,740
lean chicken lean chicken breast without

814
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:41,260
the skin has all this fat in it if you

815
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:43,750
have too much of any kind of animal

816
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:45,760
protein fat or if you have an animal

817
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:46,540
protein that could feed viruses it's a

818
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,550
whole other thing

819
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:50,230
and I'm not anti animal protein I'm not

820
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:54,130
anti being in whatever I'm just giving

821
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:56,110
you guys the layout is viruses they

822
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:57,790
think they can't thrive when oxygen

823
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:59,490
levels are really high in the

824
00:33:57,790 --> 00:34:03,910
bloodstream that's number one okay

825
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:07,720
number two in order to get medicinals

826
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:10,270
in your system rapidly and faster you

827
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:12,340
can't have high blood fat you can't have

828
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:14,440
chicken fat and I mean I've seen this

829
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:16,150
over and over again and you got the keto

830
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:18,070
diet which is a high fat diet meaning

831
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:19,360
meanwhile you put somebody if a

832
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:21,460
ten-year-old boy suffering to this

833
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,540
degree has a virus like this so many of

834
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:24,670
you out there and you put them on a keto

835
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:27,910
diet we're gonna go downhill from yeah

836
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:30,100
people don't realize that in I'm

837
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:32,310
not anti keto diet I'm just saying it's

838
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:34,810
in this crisis situation we're applying

839
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:37,780
especially later saying can't have him

840
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:39,520
on me he will atrophy like I feel when

841
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:41,920
he's lying down there people that are

842
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:44,320
blind down thinking I mean all these

843
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:46,850
people in hospital you know that need

844
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:49,280
healing are being fed the wrong diet

845
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:51,530
here's how it works yeah the high fat

846
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:54,230
when you're when you're bedridden and

847
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:57,020
you you have the possibility of Astra

848
00:34:54,230 --> 00:35:00,200
Fein and losing muscle and you're eating

849
00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:03,650
the animal proteins you're the high fats

850
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:06,640
block sugars from getting to your cells

851
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:09,770
and sugar is how you sustain muscle

852
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:11,330
laying in bed I've had to help so many

853
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:13,520
people with severe neurological

854
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:15,290
disorders or viruses or problems Orange

855
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,540
is chronic illness of some kind it's

856
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:19,370
like whoa did the high fats have to go

857
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:21,410
the animal products have to go for a

858
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:24,020
little while because we need to sustain

859
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:26,600
your muscle because carbohydrates is how

860
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:28,820
we keep muscles it's how we keep those

861
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:31,460
muscles built and kidneys muscles strong

862
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:34,610
people don't know that so here's how it

863
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:36,560
works is okay number one you're stuck in

864
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:38,570
bed you're ten years old you can't use

865
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,160
your muscles so now we're at that now

866
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:42,620
we're at the mercy of the conventional

867
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,930
system both psychiatrists psychiatry

868
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:47,000
both the medical system he's 10 years

869
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:49,640
old they can possibly take him away from

870
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,010
you who knows you know the mindset they

871
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:54,590
have right you know that's how they do

872
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:56,450
and here you aren't laying in bed and we

873
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:59,480
had to say hey wait a minute

874
00:35:56,450 --> 00:36:01,550
we have to make sure you sustain muscles

875
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:03,260
so spirit of compassion knows this

876
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:05,210
information nobody knew this information

877
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:07,340
out there they still don't and so it's

878
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:09,530
like sustain your muscles number one we

879
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:13,310
had to lower your fats in your diet so

880
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:14,030
that viruses can't thrive because here's

881
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:16,280
how it works

882
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:19,220
sugars like fruit sugars and potato

883
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:21,890
sugar and all that doesn't feed viruses

884
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:24,650
it doesn't at all it feeds your muscles

885
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:27,020
its antiviral so it's number one

886
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:29,720
so getting getting the fats down lower

887
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:33,530
made more oxygen occur in the blood it

888
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:36,110
allowed supplementation disels to get to

889
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:38,570
the virus the virus protects itself with

890
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:40,580
fact that's how it works so if we eat

891
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:43,550
all these fatty foods and we're sick

892
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:45,410
then it protects it with all that's the

893
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:47,330
fat in the bloodstream and does it

894
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:49,520
matter you know so what happens is we

895
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:52,250
had to make sure the supplementation got

896
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:53,390
to the bugs and killed off the bugs so

897
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:55,070
that's what happened we use

898
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:57,250
supplementation I talked about in the

899
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:58,630
books all the time about viruses and

900
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:00,220
these different things we had to make

901
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:01,780
sure that that was ample and you're in

902
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:04,510
your bloodstream we had to make sure

903
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:05,950
that the diet was really clean we had to

904
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:09,640
make sure there was no eggs in the diet

905
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:11,290
because eggs feed viruses and you're on

906
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:13,240
eggs at the time when I met you guys

907
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:15,310
yeah okay yeah you're gonna make your

908
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:17,530
ten-year-old ten-year-old scrambled eggs

909
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:22,810
of course every mom and makes their

910
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:24,850
technically not child scrambled eggs and

911
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:27,220
you know and rightfully so I totally

912
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:29,560
understand but hey these belief systems

913
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:31,900
we had to be like wait a minute no and

914
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:33,670
we had at the pinpoint no guessing games

915
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:35,560
yeah that's what I've talked about in

916
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:37,120
the books is there's no guessing games

917
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:38,800
at the map believe information it comes

918
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:40,930
from above any of the other information

919
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,970
that's all being thrown around a total

920
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:45,940
guessing game to how to make sure we'd

921
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:47,830
save his life and you did you did just

922
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:50,230
as bunch of a part of the you say I was

923
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:52,750
you too because all these different

924
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:54,970
things you did you listened and you know

you're like okay I'm gonna I'm gonna do

926
00:37:54,970 --> 00:38:04,450

make me it actually was look like

933
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:38,380
pudding and I remember thinking god this

934
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,220
tastes really good I think we could only

935
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:43,270
use raw honey

936
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:45,220
so it's wrong and pure like cake can our

937
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:47,710
cocoa and I had to go and I whipped it

938
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:49,420
up and it was this good and I'm like oh

939
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:50,440
my god chocolate pudding and he goes

940
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:51,940
chocolate pudding he takes a couple

942
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:55,900
green in the avocado you go wait

943
00:38:54,430 --> 00:39:00,880

00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,470
do these like nut burgers and then I

947
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,839
think

948
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:09,640
I think some other moms - you had me

949
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:11,109

950
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:13,290

952
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:18,490
situation and when we cook and where can

953
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:20,680
we go there is a lot of moms that we

959
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:32,470

00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:34,000

00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:46,829
for it but but what is it when it yeah

1011
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,240
when it's viral pain and it's it's in

1012
00:41:46,829 --> 00:41:50,460
it's infectious like the higher

1013
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:52,950
infectious state they listen you're

1014
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:55,650
healthy the thing is is everybody's got

1015
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:57,750
these bugs in them everybody girl boy

1016
00:41:55,650 --> 00:42:00,180
doesn't matter who they are they got him

1017
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:02,210
in them so it's not like that's the

1018
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:04,770
whole thing it's just Russian Roulette

1019
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:06,780
basically or whatever it's like musical

1020
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:08,940
chairs to when it's gonna hit yeah it

1021
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:11,190
can hit you at 40 that's when it hits it

1022
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:12,450
hits you at 45 you can go find you can

1023
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:14,160
go through life you can do whatever

1024
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:16,260
you're doing and then it hits you it's

1025
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:18,869
just horrible and and then it can hit

1026
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:21,569
you younger too it just means it's so

1027
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:24,240
it's like we all have these bugs in our

1028
00:42:21,569 --> 00:42:25,859
system that's how it works and we all

1029
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:28,079
get these different conditions I mean

1030
00:42:25,859 --> 00:42:30,450
you're healthy you're so healthy now

1031
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:33,810
it's ridiculous you're healthier now

1032
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:35,640
then I mean I could go just walk down

1033
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:37,230
the street or I can go in a meeting

1034
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:39,270
somewhere you're healthier than anybody

1035
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:40,980
in there meeting you healthier then I

1036
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:42,810
mean that's the whole thing I mean

1037
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:45,390
you're really rock solid it gave you a

1038
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:48,960
hug when you got here it was kind of

1039
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:52,170
guns you got muscles you got muscles

1040
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:56,099
many times bigger than even arms and in

1041
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:58,650
your back you were all muscle so it was

1042
00:42:56,099 --> 00:43:01,170
like if the whole point is it's like

1043
00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:02,730
yeah you were like you're healthy with

1044
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:04,890
how you taking care of yourself you

1045
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:06,630
cleaned up that bug early on so it

1046
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:08,940
doesn't sneak up on you down the road

1047
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:10,230
everybody else has sneaks up on that I'm

1048
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:12,089
Dan of getting sick with all these

1049
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:13,589
problems they get the high anxiety they

1050
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:15,569
get the you know the aches and pains

1051
00:43:13,589 --> 00:43:16,829
they get the tingles and numbness they

1052
00:43:15,569 --> 00:43:18,660

1053
00:43:16,829 --> 00:43:20,579
their life and they get that you know

about like the PTSD factor though

1058
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:34,410
because I'm big on the PTSD because I

1059
00:43:31,009 --> 00:43:37,199
mean I even wrote about it I wrote about

1060
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:40,529
it in the books many times and how in

1061
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:42,479
the PTSD for one you've recovered from

1062
00:43:40,529 --> 00:43:44,640
something and gone through something

1063
00:43:42,479 --> 00:43:47,729
it's like you think if you get a little

1064
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:51,420
cold you're like oh my god yeah yeah you

1065
00:43:47,729 --> 00:43:53,969

what is this gonna be you know you you

1067
00:43:53,969 --> 00:43:58,259
overthink everything and then it just

1068
00:43:55,890 --> 00:44:01,229
sends you back down the road yeah when I

1069
00:43:58,259 --> 00:44:02,910
was super sick so it was it was hard to

1070
00:44:01,229 --> 00:44:05,160
actually get through that it took I

1071
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:07,890
don't want to for me it took a couple

1072
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:09,989
years I'd say a couple years yeah yeah I

1073
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:11,910
mean we all sort of our work you know

1074
00:44:09,989 --> 00:44:13,469
and when you're in crisis as a family

00:45:21,329 --> 00:45:26,219
I mean you have this newfound compassion

1102
00:45:24,029 --> 00:45:27,700
for people that are also experiencing

1103
00:45:26,219 --> 00:45:28,839
what you're experiencing out there

1104
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:30,220
you know all of you that are out there

1105
00:45:28,839 --> 00:45:33,460
experiencing that you're experiencing

1106
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:36,160
and knowing that you know to be able to

1107
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:39,400
manage that day by day it's such an

1108
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:41,890
intense power within you to just manage

1109
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:44,470
it and you're gonna have days where you

1110
00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:50,250
must have just felt like you wanted to

1111
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:53,920
give up I can't yeah yeah yeah you know

1112
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:55,569
just get so broken down that you know

1113
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:58,270
that this information is out there too

1114
00:45:55,569 --> 00:45:59,309
you know that just you know like you

1115
00:45:58,270 --> 00:46:01,569
said we went through everything

1116
00:45:59,309 --> 00:46:03,250
everything served in its own way like

1117
00:46:01,569 --> 00:46:05,230
you said that's you know everything

1118
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:07,210
servic but really we couldn't get to a

1119
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:09,760
point where we could actually heal and

1120
00:46:07,210 --> 00:46:11,680
here we are there's all these little

1121
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:13,210
tidbits out there there's all this

1122
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,619
information the internet there's all

1123
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:15,730
these so-called studies behind it

1124
00:46:14,619 --> 00:46:17,740
because everybody's throwing all these

1125
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:19,329
studies the vegans and opinions are

1126
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:21,430
battling each other over food and don't

1127
00:46:19,329 --> 00:46:23,890
even know what causes illness and then

1128
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:26,559
you have all this going on and but yet

1129
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:29,290
in the end you get sick you get sick

1130
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:31,690
it's yes really sick where you shrug

1131
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:33,790
them for why me and that's that's that's

1132
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:35,230
what spirit told me when I was a child

1133
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:36,549
and said you have to understand how

1134
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:38,230
important this is cuz when I was your

1135
00:46:36,549 --> 00:46:41,290
age when I was 10 years old I wanted to

1136
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:42,849
quit and I remember telling spirit I

1137
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:45,400
don't care about anybody I don't care I

1138
00:46:42,849 --> 00:46:46,420
want to live my life was to be a kid I

1139
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,559
want to be a kid

1140
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:49,690
yeah that's route said no you don't

1141
00:46:47,559 --> 00:46:51,579
understand and there's there's gonna be

1142
00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:54,190
a lot of misinformation out there spirit

1143
00:46:51,579 --> 00:46:56,440
told me and it's gonna be impossible for

1144
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:58,540
people to take action that really do

1145
00:46:56,440 --> 00:47:02,099
need to heal the here and you have to

1146
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:02,099
stay with this as long as you can

1147
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:08,770
post-traumatic stress disorder or so you

1148
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:10,930
know the whole thing with that the PTSD

1149
00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:13,390
that's definitely interesting you know

1150
00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:14,680
the thing is with that is is it happens

1151
00:47:13,390 --> 00:47:16,059
to every I know I haven't see you guys

1152
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:18,520
too all the time you got the chronic

1153
00:47:16,059 --> 00:47:20,349
fatigue syndrome you got you got the the

1154
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:22,240
vertigo you got it doesn't you know you

1155
00:47:20,349 --> 00:47:23,770
got the anxiety you got the migraines

1156
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:25,690
you got in an off son you're getting a

1157
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:27,670
little better and then you get a little

1158
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:29,290
symptom and if you like you know and I

1159
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:30,640
always say it's still you know healing

1160
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:32,200
is three step when you're doing the

1161
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:34,540
right things have three steps up two

1162
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:36,010
steps back and when you finally get out

1163
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:36,720
of there and you're out of the weeds and

1164
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:39,599
you're out of that

1165
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:42,000
the depth of darkness you know and

1166
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:44,010
you're finally pulled out of that then

1167
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,140
you can still have that PTSD for a long

1168
00:47:44,010 --> 00:47:49,560
time I mean I've seen people have it for

1169
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:51,420
five years four years you know years

1170
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:53,099
after they've been healed or after

1171
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:54,180
they've healed and so it really is

1172
00:47:53,099 --> 00:47:56,369
amazing how it works

1173
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:58,170
yeah I think ours was about the same I

1174
00:47:56,369 --> 00:48:01,800
think that I mean I remember a day where

1175
00:47:58,170 --> 00:48:03,810
I didn't react with when you got sick I

1176
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:06,570
remember that moment when oh my gosh I

1177
00:48:03,810 --> 00:48:10,980
didn't get that feeling in my body so

1178
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:12,869
you were getting harassed it could have

1179
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:14,580
been three years I just remember each

1180
00:48:12,869 --> 00:48:16,140
time even all of us you know the whole

1181
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:18,090
family each time there was sort of a

1182
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:20,220
sniffle read sneeze cough or someone's

1183
00:48:18,090 --> 00:48:23,820
sick at school and we thought oh gosh

1184
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:27,000
the other thing that Calvin did you

1185
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:28,830
remember is that when you when he in his

1186
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,859
healing process and we would start to

1187
00:48:28,830 --> 00:48:35,099
transition them to eating more he would

1188
00:48:31,859 --> 00:48:36,900
start to get those symptoms again so we

1189
00:48:35,099 --> 00:48:42,720
know if we were off track and he'd say

1190
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:44,250
oh gotta go back on that shouldn't eat

1191
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:46,560
that I can't go on back any like you

1192
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:50,040
immediately track back into protocol we

1193
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:52,080
did that you know because you're still

1194
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:54,660
in the early early process of healing

1195
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:56,250
you were healing rapidly and then we're

1196
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:57,990
and then you know you go into the old

1197
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:59,369
ways in the old ways anyway wait a

1198
00:48:57,990 --> 00:49:01,619
minute I gotta get back on track until

1199
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:03,960
it's finally all yeah did you have a

1200
00:49:01,619 --> 00:49:07,619
basketball hoop in your driveway did I

1201
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:09,930
were dead why am I thinking you had did

1202
00:49:07,619 --> 00:49:14,820
you did you have a basketball basketball

1203
00:49:09,930 --> 00:49:16,080
yeah I'm saying this because I remember

1204
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:22,470
you telling me he was in the driveway

1205
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:25,109
bouncing a basketball well when you told

1206
00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:27,359
me and this was this was literally like

1207
00:49:25,109 --> 00:49:28,980
the first warm dad coming up I think or

1208
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:30,780
you're just recovering you're finally

1209
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:32,190
walking around the house yeah you were

1210
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:35,250
feeling good

1211
00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:36,660
to it you told me I called up I was like

1212
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:38,250
alright what's going on what's going on

1213
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:46,849
and you're like he's in the driveway

1214
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:49,700
playing basketball right now yeah yeah

1215
00:49:46,849 --> 00:49:51,839
because they knew motional II

1216
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:53,700
emotionally you're using your arms

1217
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:55,260
you're getting your strength back you're

1218
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:57,599
bouncing your back that's gonna feel

1219
00:49:55,260 --> 00:50:00,089
mentally like you feel past that stage

1220
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:02,010
if oh my god I was dying yeah now you

1221
00:50:00,089 --> 00:50:04,380
feel at the stage where no I'm living my

1222
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:08,660
life playing and I knew that was so

1223
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:11,190
powerful you that's the key it's like

1224
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:13,140
you needed to be freed up and be that

1225
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:15,390
child again and just move on with your

1226
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:17,190
life you know when people get pranic

1227
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:18,869
illness you guys know it's like hey wait

1228
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:20,520
a minute I want to move past this I want

1229
00:50:18,869 --> 00:50:24,450
to move on with my life I want to get

1230
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:27,000
past all this and you know and and and

1231
00:50:24,450 --> 00:50:29,280
so there's nothing better than having

1232
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,140
that final chance to do that is to

1233
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,430
finally put it behind you and just to go

1234
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:33,420
back to work because so many people have

1235
00:50:32,430 --> 00:50:36,089
met them with the medical medium

1236
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:37,470
information they heal and they feel like

1237
00:50:36,089 --> 00:50:38,849
they can go back to work they feel like

1238
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:41,250
they go back to do things they feel like

1239
00:50:38,849 --> 00:50:44,339
all that stuff when you're a child I

1240
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:47,579
mean it's it's just unimaginable really

1241
00:50:44,339 --> 00:50:48,690
because and you have to grow up fast you

1242
00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:59,279
have to learn how to grow up fast

1243
00:50:48,690 --> 00:51:00,930
because you had a council mom both my

1244
00:50:59,279 --> 00:51:02,940
kids are it was a really interesting

1245
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:03,650
experience when he was in that process

1246
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:05,520
of healing

1247
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:06,930
especially when you have people telling

1248
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:10,109
you that it was all sort of secondary

1249
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:11,880
game for some reason and that and the

1250
00:51:10,109 --> 00:51:12,960
other thing too with the information

1251
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:15,359
what does that mean

1252
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:17,059
secondary game yeah I mean secondary

1253
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:19,680
gain was what some of the um

1254
00:51:17,059 --> 00:51:22,020
professionals were telling us that um

1255
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:23,819
secondary gain means that he was doing

1256
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:26,039
it to get out of school work okay that's

1257
00:51:23,819 --> 00:51:27,390
it yeah that's it like that kind of

1258
00:51:26,039 --> 00:51:29,369
thing they were saying I'm like this is

1259
00:51:27,390 --> 00:51:31,890
not my kid this isn't how he is but

1260
00:51:29,369 --> 00:51:35,789
that's that's that's just I know it's oh

1261
00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:38,730
you can't no it's awful but you know but

1262
00:51:35,789 --> 00:51:40,589
I watch that be literally the thing now

1263
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:42,960
that's what it was out there you got

1264
00:51:40,589 --> 00:51:43,650
sick if they couldn't figure it out

1265
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:47,180
which was

1266
00:51:43,650 --> 00:51:47,180
millions of people that was all

1267
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:50,160
experiencing that where you think you're

1268
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:52,620
crazy

1269
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:53,880
now it's like this is hope like now

1270
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:56,790
these nations in the books the

1271
00:51:53,880 --> 00:52:00,390
information is here and in a live chat

1272
00:51:56,790 --> 00:52:02,670
or in any of your you know mediums that

1273
00:52:00,390 --> 00:52:05,310
you're out sharing this information is

1274
00:52:02,670 --> 00:52:07,320
that I think the number one thing to and

1275
00:52:05,310 --> 00:52:09,570
in the process of healing and being a

1276
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:11,460
catalyst for that it's just hope when

1277
00:52:09,570 --> 00:52:13,470
you're at a place where your soul feels

1278
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:15,600
so broken so hopeless and so sick that

1279
00:52:13,470 --> 00:52:18,990
you start to lose hope that there's

1280
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:20,550
something that can actually be there to

1281
00:52:18,990 --> 00:52:22,470
sort of help you and and that was a

1282
00:52:20,550 --> 00:52:24,090
really big for me for you to just be

1283
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:25,560
like hang in there hang in there okay

1284
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:27,390
now he has to walk I'm like are you sure

1285
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:29,550
like yeah you got to get him up on you

1286
00:52:27,390 --> 00:52:31,650
got to get him on his feet and and

1287
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:34,550
Calvin wanted to get to his sister's

1288
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:37,080
graduation and he forced himself in pain

1289
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:39,390
forced himself on crutches when she was

1290
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:41,310
at school so we could surprise her in

1291
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:43,410
her eighth grade graduation we put him

1292
00:52:41,310 --> 00:52:48,360
in the car and it still hurt to go up

1293
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:50,700
there because I'd hit a bump and he's

1294
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:52,620
like wow but he just went through and he

1295
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:54,630
showed up on his crutches and you know

1296
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:57,480
from then on like you said then he

1297
00:52:54,630 --> 00:53:01,380
started to get ready oh yes we haven't

1298
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:10,860
had a relapse you know and once that was

1299
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:13,260
healing no relapse yeah I just hope for

1300
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:14,850
people absolutely we got him out I mean

1301
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:17,850
I wish I could have written the books

1302
00:53:14,850 --> 00:53:19,740
earlier than 2014-2015 I wish I could

1303
00:53:17,850 --> 00:53:21,030
have done that and to get the

1304
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:23,580
information to everybody so they can

1305
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:25,320
have this information yeah but I was

1306
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:27,360
helping out so many the waiting list was

1307
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:30,120
in the millions by the time I was I was

1308
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:31,860
writing the books and there was just no

1309
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:33,690
way to do that had to be through the

1310
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:36,540
books from here on out but this was the

1311
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:39,420
early days and this is this was towards

1312
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:41,070
he you know this was not so early in at

1313
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:43,980
all but it was early it was ten years

1314
00:53:41,070 --> 00:53:45,750
ago and it was in it you got me there

1315
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:47,700
you know you got me when I was doing

1316
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:49,800
that but they tell people don't lose

1317
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:51,540
hope just because you can't talk to me

1318
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:54,270
because now I'm doing the books the

1319
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:56,790
books have this information in it if you

1320
00:53:54,270 --> 00:53:58,830

1321
00:53:56,790 --> 00:54:00,900

mean you know we're family now yeah but

1349
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:07,890
yeah yeah that's so amazing when you go

1350
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:10,680
through something like that yeah and it

1351
00:55:07,890 --> 00:55:13,200
just it bonds you together you know you

1352
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:21,930
know you can't break that it's just

1353
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:26,130
always going to be there but I mean but

1354
00:55:21,930 --> 00:55:27,540
I have to say you know you you were your

1355
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:31,230
fighters yeah

1356
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:33,240
swear to God your fighters and I always

1357
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:38,940
tell people just just find that fight

1358
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:41,070
it's in you find that fun right there is

1359
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:44,040
a place there is a place and I think

1360
00:55:41,070 --> 00:55:45,330
that's my this was like the most the

1361
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,890
most challenging thing I've had to go

1362
00:55:45,330 --> 00:55:48,450
through and I always look at what's my

1363
00:55:46,890 --> 00:55:50,070
takeaway that I can share my yoga

1364
00:55:48,450 --> 00:55:52,500
students or even people in my life and I

1365
00:55:50,070 --> 00:55:54,690
think you know indomitable will it's

1366
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:56,640
it's that like there's something inside

1367
00:55:54,690 --> 00:55:58,260
of us that is such a charge and such a

1368
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:00,360
force that's untouchable from anything

1369
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:02,460
else and that we have to find that place

1370
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:04,200
there and I and I want people to find

1371
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:06,319
out what you're doing now you're doing

1372
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:08,929

community I just wanted to provide a

1383
00:56:40,929 --> 00:56:48,439
sacred space for people to come and

1384
00:56:43,759 --> 00:56:50,449
access through yoga just to access a

1385
00:56:48,439 --> 00:56:52,400
place you know being in their body in a

1386
00:56:50,449 --> 00:57:01,369
way that's accepting really funny the

1387
00:56:52,400 --> 00:57:03,229
place we're talking about I just

1388
00:57:01,369 --> 00:57:07,959

it's freezing cold so I'm here to I'm

1392
00:57:28,219 --> 00:57:33,859
here as as a facilitator of getting

1393
00:57:31,249 --> 00:57:35,569
people to just label like the eleven

1394
00:57:33,859 --> 00:57:37,519
little you have a lot of experience

1395
00:57:35,569 --> 00:57:39,650
because when you when you get through

1396
00:57:37,519 --> 00:57:41,119
something like you did I mean that's

1397
00:57:39,650 --> 00:57:42,529
what I always tell you guys you guys are

1398
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:43,880
experts when you when you literally

1399
00:57:42,529 --> 00:57:46,549
you're going through all that that

1400
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:48,049
experience of being sick and going to

1401
00:57:46,549 --> 00:57:49,429
doctor and a doctor and making life

1402
00:57:48,049 --> 00:57:50,929
about doctors appointments cuz you have

1403
00:57:49,429 --> 00:57:52,159
no choice and all these other things you

1404
00:57:50,929 --> 00:57:54,199
give to the experience and something

1405
00:57:52,159 --> 00:57:56,419
inside you becomes powerful your soul

1406
00:57:54,199 --> 00:57:58,459
everything through the whole process and

1407
00:57:56,419 --> 00:58:01,759
go I don't want anybody to give up on

1408
00:57:58,459 --> 00:58:05,209
any level and then and then so what's

1409
00:58:01,759 --> 00:58:07,189
what it is is it's it's that experience

1410
00:58:05,209 --> 00:58:09,769
with all its really powerful and healing

1411
00:58:07,189 --> 00:58:12,079
and I mean you guys you guys are experts

1412
00:58:09,769 --> 00:58:13,669
that's how I see it I mean I see Calvin

1413
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:16,369
is an expert because he knows more about

1414
00:58:13,669 --> 00:58:18,349
health than so many people that are

1415
00:58:16,369 --> 00:58:19,849
professionals he knows more about health

1416
00:58:18,349 --> 00:58:22,070
than any diet

1417
00:58:19,849 --> 00:58:23,930
and I met some great ones that know a

1418
00:58:22,070 --> 00:58:25,760
lot he knows more about health about

1419
00:58:23,930 --> 00:58:27,650
many of the nutritionist I've ever met

1420
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:29,119
he knows more about health that's the

1421
00:58:27,650 --> 00:58:33,530
enemy that's the kind of thing it

1422
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:34,970
creates like I'm wiping I'm hoping you

1423
00:58:33,530 --> 00:58:36,470
do some kind of health coaching

1424
00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:41,720
eventually I know you're young and on

1425
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:43,340
your own but you know I'm hoping you

1426
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:45,710
some health coaching I'm hoping that you

1427
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:47,450
like start something like that because

1428
00:58:45,710 --> 00:58:48,950
your experience of what you went through

1429
00:58:47,450 --> 00:58:51,859
and how much you know and the knowledge

1430
00:58:48,950 --> 00:58:53,750
you have I think is priceless and I'm

1431
00:58:51,859 --> 00:58:55,580
hoping you actually start something and

1432
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:57,830
instructing and helping people on that

1433
00:58:55,580 --> 00:59:00,410
level Tuesday no they gave no so much so

1434
00:58:57,830 --> 00:59:02,300
it's incredible when you I want people

1435
00:59:00,410 --> 00:59:03,619
to become experts I want you guys become

1436
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:05,510
experts you know I've only said that

1437
00:59:03,619 --> 00:59:07,490
read the books become experts that's

1438
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:09,230
that's when you become an expert too

1439
00:59:07,490 --> 00:59:10,609
it's experience you have of what you've

1440
00:59:09,230 --> 00:59:12,349
been through then you read the medical

1441
00:59:10,609 --> 00:59:14,750
medium book so you know the truth and

1442
00:59:12,349 --> 00:59:18,109
then you put that together and then

1443
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:20,119
that's that's that's what happens and I

1444
00:59:18,109 --> 00:59:22,190
think what's great too is it empowers

1445
00:59:20,119 --> 00:59:24,050
you to take responsibility for your

1446
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:26,000
health and you know like you said

1447
00:59:24,050 --> 00:59:28,700
there's only so much we can do but then

1448
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,650
we can access the more educated to make

1449
00:59:28,700 --> 01:00:00,920
the choices that we may be able to

1450
00:59:30,650 --> 01:00:03,609
empower ourselves because research says

1451
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:03,609
there's nothing in it

1452
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:09,050
research doesn't know what's wrong with

1453
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:10,730
people but they'll say celery juice

1454
01:00:09,050 --> 01:00:14,030
