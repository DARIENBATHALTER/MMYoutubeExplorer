1
00:00:01,959 --> 00:00:06,560
talking about neurological problems

00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,639
brain issues because let's face it I

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,559
don't know if you guys are seeing it but

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,559
everybody's brains are going to out

5
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:15,360
there there's no doubt about it you can

6
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:16,840
see it out there you can talk to people

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,240
out there you can see how things

8
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:22,720
function or work and everybody's getting

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,800
tripped up people's brains are not

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,240
functioning like they should I want to

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,240

00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,759
that I'm also going to talk about Foods

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,320
a little bit right Troublemaker Foods

14
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:34,360
foods that are problematic why they're

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,920
problematic you'll see I got assorted

16
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:38,320
amounts of foods right here in front of

17
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:42,600
me but I want to make an announcement

18
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:46,280
the Cafe Gratitude medical medium

19
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:50,000

24
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:05,040
the link leaked out somehow somebody

25
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:08,000
found it maybe they sleuthed it maybe

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:11,799
they found it somewhere but the link got

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,960
out it leaked out because tomorrow I was

28
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:15,400

29
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,439

00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,560
everybody look it's going to be tomorrow

32
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,320
because it's going to be a meet and

34
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,439
intimate setting it's just in the

35
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,759
restaurant Cafe Gratitude and I'm going

36
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:29,200
to be there and it's going to be really

37
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,479
cool it's going to be a lot of great

38
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,520
stuff happening

39
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,600
but I didn't even get a chance to even

40
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,600
go into any of it the link was thrown

41
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,079
around or spread around it got into some

42
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:43,439
groups or somewhere else and that was it

43
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,200
the tickets were all sold in literally

44
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,640
uh two or 3 minutes or something

45
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,680
ridiculous like that so I just I mean

46
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,719
it's crazy it's actually crazy but it

47
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,560
happened I can't do anything about it

48
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:56,759
and I feel bad for anybody who is

49
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:58,240
waiting tomorrow or anybody who's on the

50
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:00,680
other side of the world and they're

51
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,880
asleep right now so that another thing

52
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,799
too I was a little worried about is that

53
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,680
there's a whole bunch of people that uh

54
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:10,640
probably would have come that are on the

55
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,840
other side of the world all in bed you

56
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,640
know snoozing and snuggling and they're

57
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,200
going to wake up in the morning their

58
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,640
morning their morning and they're going

59
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,840
to see what happened it's not even being

60
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,800
launched there's no launch or anything

61
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:29,400
like that lra over there YouTube says no

62
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:31,360
this is so sad we had we had a launch

63
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,680
link that was going to be used for

64
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,640
tomorrow all these things and it didn't

65
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:40,400
happen someone got the link and passed

66
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:42,480
it around and so we had to then release

67
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,120
whatever we had to release that we had

68
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,480
that was for tomorrow but we had to do

69
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,080
it today so anyway that was just what I

70
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,599
wanted to tell you by the way anybody

71
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:54,920
who did get a ticket for the Cafe

72
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:58,159
Gratitude medical medium pop-up dinner

73
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:02,000
is going to be stoked is going to be

74
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:05,440
totally totally psyched for October 22nd

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,799
October 23rd you can join the wait list

76
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,239

77
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:13,400
restaurants because it's October 22nd is

78
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:16,159
one restaurant October 23rd is another

79
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,680
restaurant so it's Cafe Gratitude so

80
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,239
there is a waiting list that's there so

81
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,080
you can hop on that wait list you never

85
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,400
really cool there like that but anyway

86
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:34,200
that's what happened it's shocking

87
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,680
totally shocking I'm I'm in shock

88
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:39,000
because it happened in seconds like in

89
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,680
seconds like 3 minutes it was just

90
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,120
seconds basically I don't know what it

91
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,959
was like 240 seconds or something like

92
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,319
that and it was all gone that's what it

93
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:49,760
that's what it seemed like October 15th

94
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,879
though I do want to say this before we

95
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,640

96
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:54,920

97
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,159
like that as you guys could see we're

98
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,640

122
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,479

123
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,320
you're you know wondering what's going

124
00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:00,880
on or what happened the link escaped

125
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,280
somehow or somebody got the link somehow

126
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,600
they found it and they passed it around

127
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:09,520
and it was sold out just in a literally

128
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:12,039
in a second not literally in a second

129
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,960
but three minutes anyway all right so I

130
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:14,639
want to talk a little bit about

131
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,440
neurological brain and everything and

132
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,840
then I'll just remind everybody in case

133
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:21,039
somebody comes on and goes what happened

134
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,240
yeah it's it's it's crazy it's

135
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,560
crazy so I'm going to talk about Foods a

136
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,960
little bit but I'm also going to talk

137
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,479
about brain problems because I don't

138
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:32,080
know if you guys are seeing it out there

139
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:35,039
right uh um anyway Spirit of compassion

140
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,759
told me back what was it five years ago

141
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,080
four and a half years ago or something

142
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:42,160
like that that there was going to be

143
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:43,919
this onslaught of just

144
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,319
deterioration um people getting

145
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,080
chronically ill in so many ways

146
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:49,240
neurologically and so forth and it was

147
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,840
going to be just quite a ride and that's

148
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,440
where it's heading and it is heading

149
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,360
that way and you'll see me like there's

150
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:57,319
studies out there like scientist say

151
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,360
that 40% of the people now are have this

152
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:00,520
or 60% of the people are getting sick

153
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,199
with this this and that they've never

154
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:06,319
seen anything like it's

155
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:08,919
unprecedented yeah so you'll see that

156
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,919
you'll see that out there and at the

157
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:14,560
same time really the reality is it's

158
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:16,840
more it's more it's more it's more

159
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,639
people are getting sick they're getting

160
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:22,759
brain sick it is

161
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:25,599
disturbing it is disturbing a lot of on

162
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:28,800
a lot of levels because when someone's

163
00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:30,400
brain is getting messed up for some

164
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,639
reason or another we're going to cover

165
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,840
some of those

166
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:36,800
things it can open the door for anything

167
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:39,000
all kinds of different problems so it's

168
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,479
toxic heavy metals are really elevating

169
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,319
like nobody's business in people's

170
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,479
brains these days it's a whole another

171
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,240
level right all that and what you'll see

172
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,039
out there is this you'll see this now

173
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,240
right this got popular forever chemicals

174
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:52,599

article after article and people be

179
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,120
talking about it but forever

180
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,919
chemicals yeah it's not something

181
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:09,879
medical medium information talked a lot

182
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:11,879
about because that's compared

183
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:13,400
to what's really in people's brains

184
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:15,080
that's compared to what people

185
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,520
are really up against and that's

186
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,840
 compared to what's really going

187
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:21,319
on like the reality and real problems

188
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,759
okay so forever chemicals sure that's

189
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:26,160
not a good thing but you'll see it's the

190
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:29,120
buzz right now but it's a great

191
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,879
distraction for what's really causing

192
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,120
harm to people's neurological systems

193
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:36,240
and their brain and their organs and

194
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,599
everything else their other organs and

195
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:43,080
that's the sad thing but there's always

196
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:45,800
some kind of hip trendy BS thing going

197
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:48,120
on and forever chemicals avoid these

198
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:51,000
foods with forever chemicals avoid these

199
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,440
foods that have this and that in it and

200
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,240
that you know you'll hear that out there

201
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,599
it's like okay great great glad you got

202
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,120
that figured out you're not supposed to

203
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:01,800
spray crap that's you know on pans and

204
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,639
you know cook your food you know aerosol

205
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:07,280
cans filled with all kinds of crazy

206
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:10,080
stuff sure I get it duh but really it's

207
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:13,240
much bigger than that it's a viral

208
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,720
explosion I've always said it's Plastics

209
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,599
right that's another thing that's been a

210
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,680
problem out there I've always said it's

211
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:20,520
radiation that's another thing out there

212
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:23,280
so life-changing Foods I talked about

213
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:26,199
the viral explosion and the metals and

214
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:28,000
the radiation right the pesticides like

215
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:29,840
DDT and everything that are still out

216
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,320
there and they're still using DDT by the

217
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:35,919
way they're still using it all around

218
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:38,519
the globe that stuff is like still

219
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:41,599
backlogged I mean they they have like

220
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:44,519
warehouses and warehouses filled the DDT

221
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:48,640
from the 1950s and the

222
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:51,360
1940s and the 1960s they have so much to

223
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:54,920
use that they're still unloading it

224
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:59,680
they're unloading barrels of DBT with

225
00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:01,440
dates on the barrels like 1951 1952 and

226
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,120
they're unloading these and selling them

227
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,600
to you know on the black market to

228
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,800
people they're using it all around the

229
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:09,200
world they're using it as a pesticide

230
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,160
and insectic side they're using As for

231
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,600
apartment buildings around the world

232
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:15,519
they're using DDT still and that's how

233
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,120
insane things are so it's like yeah

234
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,680
forever

235
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,839
chemicals yeah blah blah blah I hear

236
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,600
that all the time now it's like you

237
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:26,560
don't worry about those how about

238
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:29,000
worrying about all the Mercury and the

239
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,440
lead and the cadmium and the copper

240
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,680
that's going into people's brains and

241
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:34,120
building up like crazy right now how

242
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,680
about worrying about other things how

243
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,640
about worrying about everybody's zinc

244
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,880
deficiency how about that there zinc

245
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:42,240
deficiencies are just out totally

246
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:44,720
outrageous on the level people have zinc

247
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,920
deficiencies and then you know worry

248
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,079
about the viral explosion that's taking

249
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,920
off where people are getting

250
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:55,839
neurologically sick because of viruses

251
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:57,839
viral explosion and boom Metals right

252
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,560
those are the two big ones and then of

253
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,279
course there's all these solvents and

254
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,640
all these pesticides and herbicides and

255
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,800
fungicides which are high in metals and

256
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:08,160
there's all these other different things

257
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,839
that get in people's systems solvents

258
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,560
are a big one right there that's an

259
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,160
antagonist and then Pharmaceuticals

260
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,680
right Pharmaceuticals in water

261
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,399
Pharmaceuticals in food Pharmaceuticals

262
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:21,640
in everything basically it's in the air

263
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:23,920
it's in pole water if you go swimming

264
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,600
it's in the beach Pharmaceuticals are

265
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,200
floating everywhere now and that's

266
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,279
another thing on its own but either way

267
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,720
there's a lot of different different

268
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:36,360
things that are getting into us and

269
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:39,360
creating that dirty blood syndrome which

270
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:41,480
creates a dirty liver which creates a

271
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:45,120
you know a dirty brain which creates all

272
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:48,200
of this and we end up in trouble so

273
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,040
there's lots to talk about here um you

274
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:52,120
know as far as the hip stuff that's out

275
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,079
there which they're trying to shove down

276
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:57,399
people's throats forever chemicals is

277
00:10:54,079 --> 00:11:00,279
one of them the other one is HPV they're

278
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:03,160
trying to actually say basic basically

279
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:05,000
with HPV they're trying to say well HPV

280
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:07,279
that's a cancer-causing virus that

281
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,680
creates cancer it's interesting because

282
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,680
they're using medical Med information

283
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,040
that I put out there about epine bar and

284
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,120
so forth creating cancer and they're

285
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,720
using that information but they don't

286
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,440
have the science to back it up so this

287
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:22,440
is pretty crazy so it's like oh HPV

288
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,399
causes all kinds of throat cancer causes

289
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:27,519
all kinds of cancers because it gets

290
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,760
into it invades the tissue creating you

291
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:32,120
know de demented C

292
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,920
uh really because it's medical medium

293
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:38,079
information that's all about viruses

294
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:40,639
creating damaged cells which in turn

295
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:42,760
creates cancerous cells I published

296
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:45,040
articles about it I put it in the books

297
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,680
I lectured about it before the books but

298
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,360
now science all of a sudden what they

299
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,160
just went to Medical medium again they

300
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,279
just took well let's just pluck this out

301
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,680
now this sounds great let's just start

302
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:55,920
saying how HPV creates cancer it's like

303
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,399
where's your science though when you

304
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,000
really dig into it they don't have it

305
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:01,600
they've never seen HPV even create a

306
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,399
cancer can saw that's how sick that is

307
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,120
but they take the information and

308
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:06,639
they're now applying my Epstein bar

309
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,600
information about Epstein bar and other

310
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,560
viruses creating cancer cells and now

311
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,760
they take that and they now take it put

312
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,720
it to HPV even though they have no signs

313
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:20,120
to show it it's actually disturbing but

314
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:24,760
that's how it works out there so

315
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:26,399
um but yes if you talk to people enough

316
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:29,320
or you look into things or you're just

317
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:31,279
looking for help somewhere some services

318
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,959
or you You' got errands to run or you

319
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,680
didn't you talk to somebody here or you

320
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,120
talk to somebody there you'll notice

321
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:41,320
that things aren't working like they

322
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:43,920
used to preco era pre right four years

323
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,480
ago pre five years ago you'll notice

324
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,040
things aren't the same you'll notice

325
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:50,519
people making mistakes like a ton of

326
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,000
mistakes that's what people do they're

327
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,519
making lots of mistakes because their

328
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,440
brains aren't working good have you

329
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,959
noticed it have you noticed it yet a

330
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,279
whole bit their brains aren't working

331
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,680
like they should some mistakes are

332
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:02,440
happening all the time

333
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,920
and people are not functioning like they

334
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,839
should and that's happening right there

335
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:09,199
yep Dr fa they take medical Med

336
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:10,000
information warp it to fit their agenda

337
00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:12,880
very

338
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,160
true very correct right there so I'm

339
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,440
going to read just a couple of things

340
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,240
first of all I'm talking about chronic

341
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,000
illness as well you know chronic fatigue

342
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:22,519
syndrome neurological fatigue that's a

343
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
big one right there you know for years

344
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:26,480
and years and years it was all about

345
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,600
people being tired you know yeah you're

346
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,399
tired you just you're depressed that's

347
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,639
why you're tired tired you're depressed

348
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:35,079
that's why you're tired it's like no I'm

349
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:37,440
not depressed I don't want yeah I am

350
00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:39,360
depressed because I'm T I'm not

351
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,880
depressed no I'm depressed now because

352
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,040
I'm tired I can't function for 6 months

353
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:46,680
but I wasn't depressed before I got

354
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:49,199
tired but now I'm tired every day and I

355
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,880
can't function so now I am depressed so

356
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:52,480
the confusion is there that happens all

357
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,079
the time to people it's like no you're

358
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,880
depressed you need an anti-depressant

359
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:58,320
need anti-anxiety meds and

360
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,880
anti-depressants that's why you're tired

361
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,720
but really what's happening is people

362
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:04,120
have so many problems in their brain

363
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:06,759
their brain stem problems in their brain

364
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:08,959
stem problems with their cranial nerves

365
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:10,880
they're inflamed they're inflamed

366
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:14,680
because of metals and viruses those are

367
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:17,079
the two big boys right there JS says yes

368
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:20,279
I work in Bakery and it's a Biz it's

369
00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:22,839
bizarre how much brain fog there is not

370
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:25,000
only that but there's also a lot of

371
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:27,320
arrogance and entitlement coupled with

372
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,560
it

373
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:33,600
entitlement entitlement that's a fun one

374
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,759
right there enti entitlement is

375
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,160
definitely out there there's no question

376
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:41,160
about that I've talked about entitlement

377
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:43,160
a little bit you know there's in people

378
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,800
who have gone after medical medium with

379
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:48,079
lies and all kinds of other stuff they

380
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:50,360
were highly entitled so many people are

381
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:52,480
that entitlement thing is just crazy I

382
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,800
know I know it's true though it's a

383
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,800
level of like brain fog but it's a level

384
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,440
of entitlement with it crispy

385
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,839
perspective they repeat the wrong

386
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,920
numbers can't remember things oh my God

387
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:06,880
it pre

388
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:08,759
2019 pre-2020 it wasn't like that they

389
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,160
repeat the wrong numbers can't remember

390
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:13,639
things can't read info correctly can't

391
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,040
spell get brain fog Etc crispy

392
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:16,199
perspective that's exactly what's

393
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,000
happening out there sure there was

394
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:19,600
always a little bit about that little

395
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,040
bit of that out there okay keep that in

396
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:27,880
mind there's always a little bit of that

397
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:29,880
out there pre 2019 pre-2020 there was

398
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:33,000
there just was there brain fog out there

399
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:36,000
of course I mean there's sick brains

400
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,839
there's people that aren't well but it

401
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,920
exploded exploded Parkinson boom on the

402
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:45,240
rise right Ms On The Rise Parkinson's On

403
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:48,000
The Rise all the different you know

404
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:50,920
memory loss Alzheimer's dementia all on

405
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,120
the rise but it's even more than that

406
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:54,600
it's like this person doesn't have

407
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:56,199
Alzheimer's but this person just got the

408
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,000
numbers wrong right there and then they

409
00:15:56,199 --> 00:15:59,440
put it in the computer and boom they

410
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,199
just ruined your life and now you're

411
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,199
calling that you know blah blah blah hey

412
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:05,000
that's not that's not what happened

413
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:06,800
identity theft or this and it whatever

414
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,279
it is you know the craziest stuff's

415
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,399
happening because people are misplacing

416
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:12,319
numbers and information that you're you

417
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,279
know you need services for whatever

418
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:15,920
you're doing and they're you're using

419
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:17,360
private information and you're giving it

420
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,480
to them and they just put it in the

421
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,560
wrong category or the wrong place and

422
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:25,240
then it gets out there it's crazy what's

423
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:27,440
happening um it really is Katie over

424
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:29,639
here on YouTube Says Yes actually now

425
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,800
that he says that people do do seem to

426
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:34,800
make a lot of mistakes oh like it's

427
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,560
unbelievable to the degree like things

428
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,120
don't go smoothly anywhere sometimes I

429
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,600
wonder how the world is still

430
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,319
functioning seriously Katie that is

431
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,800
exactly what's happening now it is

432
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:48,240
getting worse it was worse it was bad a

433
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:51,880
year ago it was bad two years ago now

434
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,959
it's absurdly insanely bad like it is so

435
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:56,600
bad now but what are we going to do

436
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:59,000
about it probably nothing it's just

437
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,399
getting worse and worse and worse but I

438
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,199
want you to be able to protect yourself

439
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:06,079
so you're not falling into that category

440
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:07,600
of people where mistakes are being made

441
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:11,199
and everything else is happening like

442
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:13,480
that so yeah so you you live a good life

443
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,480
and you can think clear and you can

444
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:17,319
function and you can you know you can

445
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,319
see other people messing up left and

446
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:21,559
right because their brain isn't working

447
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:23,919
but at Le at least yours is working and

448
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:26,160
you see it I'd rather have you on that

449
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:28,480
end I want to be on that end I want to

450
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:31,559
be on the end of like my brain's working

451
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,840
yeah and that is good end to be on and

452
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:35,480
then I want to be there and then I want

453
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,720
to be on the end where you know I'm

454
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,400
seeing everybody mess up it sucks I

455
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,960
don't want to see people mess up but I'd

456
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,559
rather be where I am now like you guys

457
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,640
and then see other people just screwing

458
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:46,400
up every second because their brain

459
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,960
isn't working I don't want to be

460
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,880
somebody who's losing their mind and

461
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,240
that's what's happening out there um

462
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,039
because it's

463
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:58,480
true the medical medum heavy metal detox

464
00:17:55,039 --> 00:18:01,480
is critical to protect people it just is

465
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,840
that's a fact it just is it's critical

466
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,640
to help people and protect them it's in

467
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,919
the it's in the medical medium brains

468
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:11,400
saer books right here okay it's in there

469
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:13,000
and you know it's important to take care

470
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,360
of your brain so let's talk about Foods

471
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,240
a little bit before we get into some

472
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:20,320
illnesses let's do that okay

473
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:22,559
so what you see in front of me is just

474
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,120
some foods okay you got a cheeseburger

475
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,000
right here you got a pizza right there

476
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,840
you got I think a meatball wedge

477
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,480
meatball wedge you got a steak and

478
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,320
cheese right there steak and cheese got

479
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,280
some eggs over here if you see that got

480
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:38,440
a nice big hero right here a big hogy

481
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,840
big wedge grinder whatever you call it

482
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,559
whatever you want to call it or whatever

483
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,559
it's called somewhere right so you got

484
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:45,400
that there too but what you're seeing in

485
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:47,679
here sure our foods that you might not

486
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:50,039
eat you might not be out there eating

487
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:52,400
these Foods tomorrow you might not be

488
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:55,360
eating maybe you never even you you like

489
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:58,840
the hero right there and so you may not

490
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:01,520
be eating these okay but there's things

491
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:03,720
in these foods that you may be eating

492
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,120
though in some other food keep that in

493
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:08,440
mind you might be like I haven't had a

494
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:11,320
meatball wedge in 20 years so this

495
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:14,880
excludes me aw oh it's not really about

496
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:17,679
the meatball wedge it's about the egg in

497
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,080
the meatball it's about the cheese on

498
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,280
the meatball wedge it's about these

499
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:25,919
things right it's about the

500
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:27,919
oil that was used in that meatball wedge

501
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,000
it's about the gluten in the bread

502
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,799
crumbs that were were used in the

503
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,280
meatballs cuz you know a lot of people

504
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:36,440
do meatballs they put there's

505
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:38,520
breadcrumbs put into the meatballs right

506
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:41,240
and there's eggs put into the meatballs

507
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:43,720
and so forth but there's eggs and gluten

508
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:46,320
and then there's Dairy and it's these

509
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:48,679
Foods right here that are problematic

510
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:53,960
for so many reasons one big reason is

511
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:58,840
those Foods feed feed bugs bugs that eat

512
00:19:53,960 --> 00:20:01,039
people alive over time so bugs love

513
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:04,360
things like Dairy and they love the

514
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:06,720
proteins and eggs and they love the

515
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:10,600
gluten they love the feed off of gluten

516
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:14,480
bugs love these kinds of foods and so

517
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:16,240
it's key to actually know hey look these

518
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,679
aren't good foods and it's not good to

519
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,400
get canola oil in your system do you

520
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:23,640
know I started talking about canola oil

521
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:27,640
being bad for people in the 80s how

522
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:31,880
crazy is that in the80s canola oil is

523
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:35,200
bad everybody thought I was crazy to say

524
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:38,200
canola oil is bad it was like what are

525
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,280
you talking about canola oil and then

526
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,919
now you need got to worry about the

527
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:44,200
canola oil and olive oil mixes out there

528
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:47,240
that's a big deal is the mix of canola

529
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:50,039
oil and olive oil it's everywhere so

530
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:53,679
what we're allowed to do here is we're

531
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:56,159
allowed to take uh olive oil mix it with

532
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:59,280
a little bit of canola oil and call it

533
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:02,120
just olive oil that's how it works here

534
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:05,200
now so that's the rules and that's a

535
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:07,840
scary place to be and but it's the rules

536
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:10,919
now as long as the percentage of canola

537
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,799
oil is less than the olive oil maybe

538
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:15,400
even a lot less than the olive oil and

539
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:17,279
you make a mix right there predominantly

540
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,760
as long as you know you got the olive

541
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:22,360
oil there and the majority is the olive

542
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:25,279
oil you can call it olive oil not Olive

543
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:28,919
and canola you don't have to put canola

544
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:31,360
on the ingredient list on the bottle

545
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:34,640
canola oil is

546
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:37,720
damaging damaging to the intestinal

547
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:40,120
tract to the liver it's not a good oil

548
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,600
to have people eat that all the time and

549
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:44,720
don't even know it's in all these salad

550
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:47,520
dressings it's in lots of condiments

551
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,039
canola oil is infiltrated in all of

552
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,520
these condiments out there you got to

553
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:55,080
worry about it something to keep in mind

554
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:57,640
right these things matter these little

555
00:21:55,080 --> 00:22:00,279

00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:06,840
want any concerns they don't want to get

559
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,080

interesting right so's information

604
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:02,039
everyday toxins and poisons inside the

605
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:05,480
brain are a large part of the brain

606
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:08,080
limitations we experience brain

607
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:09,240
limitations from toxins and poisons in

608
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:12,000
the brain did you know the health

609
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:13,720
movement didn't really even like I mean

610
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,960
the conventional Health movement didn't

611
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:18,039
even use the word toxin it was

612
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:20,360
ridiculous most of the health movement

613
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:23,279
didn't even touch the word toxin it was

614
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:25,240
crazy everyday toxins and poisons inside

615
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,960
the brain are a large part of the brain

616
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:29,559
limitations we experience including

617
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,640
emotional limitations so emotional

618
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:33,440
limitations so someone could be seeing

619
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:35,480
their psychiatrist they can be seeing

620
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,159
their therapists they could be seeing

621
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:43,000
their coaches and they're just they're

622
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:45,520
just like unloading so much so much just

624
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:50,440
depression and anxiety issues and

625
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:53,080
everything else are unloading unloading

626
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:55,000
unloading but really what's happening is

627
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:58,600
there's limitations emotionally because

628
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:00,080
the brain is so overburdened with junk

629
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:02,039

630
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,760

abundant level of poisons and toxins

vaping that's a level of vaping it's

649
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:47,159
scented candles I remember when I first

started hitting the whole fragrances

651
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:50,159

00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:57,320
and fragrances what's wrong with you

655
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:58,960
medical medium putting fear at us about

656
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:01,520
scented candles

657
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,039
yeah it's that bad scent to candles are

658
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,760
that bad and then people are taking it

659
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:07,000
now right taking that information you'll

660
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:08,559
see somebody pop up on Tik Tok like Tik

661
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:13,279
Tok like fragrances the sending candles

662
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:16,200
are bad mhm yeah sure yep they

663
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:18,279
are so people have all that stuff the

664
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,200
area of the brain that gets clouded up

665
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:23,240
with these brain betrayers like sended

666
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:25,840
candles and air fresheners clones and

667
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:28,320
perfumes and metals which sit inside of

668
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,440
all those things I just said the bra

669
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,360
brain the emotional Center of that of

670
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:34,039
your brain gets actually all kind of

671
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:36,720
clogged up with that we're going to have

672
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:38,320
a trouble and we're going to be in big

673
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,279
trouble when emotional centers of the

674
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,039
brain become filled up and clouded with

675
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:44,520
toxins and poisons we become more

676
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:47,000
reliant on other parts of our brain so

677
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:49,000
it's another thing that happens so as

678
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,360
the emotional you ever run into somebody

679
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,440
that's just like so numb emotionally

680
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:57,320
though they're emotional in some ways

681
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:59,399
but they're so numb they're just numb

682
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:01,520
with seeing like somebody else's

683
00:26:59,399 --> 00:27:03,799
emotions are what they're going through

684
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,240
they're just numb in general they seem

685
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:07,679
like they're really really self-absorbed

686
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,080
and they're wallowing in their own

687
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:11,720
suffering and pain and everything but

688
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,720
really they're just like they're numbed

689
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:16,360
out and numb that means the emotional

690
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:18,200
centers of the brain got so clogged up

691
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:20,399
and so clouded up with toxins and

692
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,360
poisons to such a degree that they're

693
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,720
now using other parts of their brain

694
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,440
they're using other parts of the brain

695
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,679
which means that they just they're not

696
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,760
connecting at all to that person in any

697
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:31,840
way it's not possible instead they're

698
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:34,760
just you know off here

699
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:36,159
instead so um we'll go into a little bit

700
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:38,960
more of this

701
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:40,880
right we can become Limited in getting

702
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,840
in touch with our own emotional state

703
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,480
and that's another thing

704
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,159
depersonalization so let's go into

705
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:47,679
depersonalization a little bit I mean

706
00:27:45,159 --> 00:27:49,760
you guys know anybody who suffered with

707
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,440
depersonalization or maybe are suffering

708
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,360
with

709
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:54,360
depersonalization that's a big one out

710
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:57,159
there that's getting worse too every

711
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:59,519
single condition that I can say is like

712
00:27:57,159 --> 00:28:01,399
this now up there versus down here

713
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:03,039
depersonalization boom that's how many

714
00:28:01,399 --> 00:28:06,559
more people are actually suffering with

715
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:08,880
that it's incredible what's happening so

716
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:10,600
the personalization is a big one so when

717
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,679
the emotional centers of the brain are

718
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:15,360
getting clouded up with poisons and

719
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:17,679
toxins and metals and all of that then

720
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,360
we get disconnected toxins and poisons

721
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:21,559
clogging the emotional centers of brain

722
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:23,600
can also mean that we become extremely

723
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:26,159
emotional without understanding why so

724
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:28,440
then we're having a burst or an episode

725
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:30,640
or we get triggered easy how many people

726
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,600
you know get triggered easy because the

727
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:35,320
emotional centers of the brain are so

728
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:37,200
poisoned up they're so clogged up with

729
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:40,279
so much different stuff right how many

730
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,480
people you know get triggered so easily

731
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:44,679
emotionally and it's like boom they're

732
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:47,399
in an episode they're triggered boom and

733
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:49,880
they're there like easily there how many

734
00:28:47,399 --> 00:28:51,799
people do you know so many people go

735
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:54,200
through that because there's that much

736
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:57,080
junk and garbage inside the emotional

737
00:28:54,200 --> 00:29:00,039
centers of the brain causing somebody to

738
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:02,200
be like this is Lightning Fast triggered

739
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:04,080
in the moment an episode can hit out of

740
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,200
nowhere or they're just completely

741
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,120
numbed out disconnected with

742
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:11,519
depersonalization but even people with

743
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:13,679
depersonalization you guys end up boom

744
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:16,120
into sometimes like the deep end with a

745
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,399
trigger then now they're just oh

746
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:19,039

776
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,559
tomorrow had my whole team working on it

777
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,519
they were killing themselves I kid you

778
00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:34,519
not like like working hard on it right

779
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:36,799
they have been all week and so forth and

780
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:39,039
then what happened was we were all set

781
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:40,880
to do it for tomorrow and we were

782
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:42,960
mentioning CA gratitude collaboration

783
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,760
and all of it I mean you know a big part

784
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:49,320
of my team was doing it and then out of

785
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:52,159
nowhere someone somehow got a hold of

786
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:54,960
the link that was supposed to be put in

787
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:57,360
the email and released tomorrow they got

788
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:59,399
a hold of it today and then they passed

789
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,399
it around in all the groups and

790
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:03,760
everywhere and then things just went

791
00:31:01,399 --> 00:31:05,720
haywire and it went crazy I mean it's

792
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,760
mindblowing really how it happened and

793
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:09,480
what happened but it's also going to

794
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,159
upset some people let's just be honest

795
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,639
there it's going to upset a few people

796
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:14,000
that were waiting for tomorrow looking

797
00:31:12,639 --> 00:31:15,320
out for tomorrow like I said before

798
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,120
there are people sleeping on the other

799
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:20,279
side of the world right now asleep and

800
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:23,440
they're going to wake up tomorrow and

801
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:26,799
they're going to be like what happened

802
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:29,440
what happened and so the link basically

803
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:32,720
got out someone somehow sleuthed it and

804
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:35,760
they found it or they found it somewhere

805
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:38,039
yeah it's it's something like

806
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,519
that making peace with our healing

807
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:41,240
timeline I want to talk about healing

808
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:42,880
timelines right here too a little bit

809
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:46,240
because neurological problems and brain

810
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:49,600
problems don't go away fast for a lot of

811
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:52,679
people they don't Parkinson's does not

812
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:54,559
go away in a day for people people who

813
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:57,039
do medical M information can get rid of

814
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:58,639
their Parkinson how many people reverse

815
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:03,279
their Parkinson with medical medum

816
00:31:58,639 --> 00:32:05,200
information a lot of people okay so um

817
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:07,159
but does it happen in a day no it

818
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,760
doesn't you can see results in a day

819
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:11,559
believe it or not just by bringing in

820
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:15,600
some of the tools but getting rid of it

821
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:17,799
completely in a day will never

822
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:20,240
happen

823
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:22,600
so conditions like

824
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,919
Parkinson's or any kind of neurological

825
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,080
condition and that's another problem too

826
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:28,960
on all on its own you may not be

827
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:33,120
diagnosed with Parkinson's

828
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:35,960
you may not be diagnosed as um dementia

829
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:38,480
Alzheimer's you may not be di diagnosed

830
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:40,480
to something like that but you got all

831
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,200
these other different symptoms and you

832
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,519

862
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:06,760
peace with our healing timeline a little

863
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:08,720
bit when we get sick we start to track

864
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:11,879
the timeline did you ever run into

865
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:14,079
anybody who tracks the timeline did you

866
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:15,960
track the timeline I talked about this

867
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:17,520
before but it's really important it's

868
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,440
pertinent right now to talk about for a

869
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:21,240
lot of reasons because that many more

870
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,000
people are getting sick every day when

871
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:26,720
we get sick we start to track the

872
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,399
timeline everybody okay we count the

873
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:31,879
days we've been sick maybe even the

874
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:33,800
hours a lot of people will count hours

875
00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:35,839
believe it or not we count the weeks the

876
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,639
months and eventually if it lasts that

877
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:40,040
long and we're sick that long we count

878
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:43,440
the years that's something we do when

879
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:46,159
we're sick that is definitely something

880
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:48,520
people do when they're sick it's like

881
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:51,399
instantly it's like I got sick on this

882
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:53,399
date I got sick that week I got sick

883
00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:55,000
that month and I've been sick for 5

884
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:58,000
years people do

885
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,040
it okayy

886
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,240
over there on YouTube aw what tea are

00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:04,480

888
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:07,960
tea right here but it's not just a lemon

889
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:11,040
bomb tea it also has a shot of a couple

890
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:14,119
of things in there it's got a shot of

891
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:17,599
guess what it's got a shot shot of the

892
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:19,800
vigy propolis I put in my lemon bomm tea

893
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:24,760
as you can see right there it's The Vig

894
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:27,400
propolis one of the most profound

895
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:30,200
profound I mean right there is that prop

896
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:32,680
is cure it's incredible anyway you guys

897
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:35,280
know you guys know that it fully endorse

898
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:37,800
mgy but anyway I have that in there but

899
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,640
this is my lemon balm tea with propolis

900
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:43,240
in

901
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:45,720
there I love the way that tastes by the

902
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:47,880
way something happens to us emotionally

903
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:50,280
when remember when we remember the month

904
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:53,480
we got sick the time of

905
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:55,880
year something that connects with that

906
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:59,680
and it sticks with us so if you were

907
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:01,359
sick a year ago in September it sticks

908
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:04,000
with you and then When September Comes

909
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:06,000
Around again it's like boom right

910
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,359
there's this connection that happens

911
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,440
okay the beautiful thing about ever all

912
00:36:08,359 --> 00:36:12,440
of this is when you start healing you

913
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:14,040
remember when you started to heal and

914
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:17,280
you remember the month you started to

915
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:22,079
heal and you start remembering and then

916
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:24,400
that starts to wash over so many

917
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:26,920
emotions so many different references

918
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:29,200
and memories of when you got sick right

919
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:31,520
it starts to take over that healing

920
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:34,960
process starts to just be this bright

921
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:37,359
light it's such a beautiful thing many

922
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:39,800
of us remember the people we were around

923
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:42,240
when we first got

924
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,560

933
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:05,839
we were around when we first got sick

934
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:07,880
the places we were the jobs we were

935
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:09,359
doing the commitments do you remember

936
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:11,319
the job you were doing when you got sick

937
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:14,160
do you remember if there was a job you

938
00:37:11,319 --> 00:37:15,920
had when you got sick that happens all

939
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,480
the time too especially when people lose

940
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,599
their jobs and lose their careers when

941
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:23,560
they get sick they remember that the

942
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:25,560
commitments we had on our plate time

943
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:27,880
plays a large role in our emotional

944
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:31,359
brain it's as if our emot emotional

945
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:33,720
brain is directly connected to time sure

946
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:37,040
we worry about time on a daily basis

947
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:39,359
even when we're not sick or struggling

948
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:41,560
our responsibilities and plans are based

949
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:43,640
around time everything's based around

950
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:45,520
time yet something changes when we're

951
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:48,319
sick we see time differently we start

952
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:50,839
saying it's time to get better you get

953
00:37:48,319 --> 00:37:52,839
sick it's time to get better and you can

954
00:37:50,839 --> 00:37:55,040

955
00:37:52,839 --> 00:37:57,960

00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,560
important right I want to just go

961
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:11,119
through this a little bit and I want to

962
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:13,760
talk about shock therapies and in some

963
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:13,760
other incredible

964
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:21,960
tools something changes when we get sick

965
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,319
we see time differently we start saying

966
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:27,040
it's time to get better or it's about

967
00:38:24,319 --> 00:38:29,560
time I'm feeling better or we hear it's

968
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:33,079
due time time you'll get better it's due

969
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:36,240
time I get better it's about time I get

970
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:38,000
better it's time right now to get better

971
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:40,319
keep that in mind time is such a large

972
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,599
aspect of illness because if we're sick

973
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:46,599
we feel like we lost time we're losing

974
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:47,880
out okay so if you guys know if you've

975
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:49,319
been sick and I know a lot of you have

976
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:51,440
been sick and struggling you've risen

977
00:38:49,319 --> 00:38:55,160
out of the ashes you

978
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:58,040
know you know that it feels like it's

979
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:59,839
lost time when you're sick so many

980
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:02,640
things you could have done so many

981
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:03,920
places you could have gone right and so

982
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,599
many people have healed and they have

983
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:08,560
gone to the medical medium events right

984
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:11,200
they've done that recently there's

985
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:12,880
people there that were sick for years

986
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,400
couldn't travel couldn't do anything and

987
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,800
now all of a sudden you're traveling and

988
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,319
they were there which is mindblowing all

989
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:22,079
on its

990
00:39:18,319 --> 00:39:24,280
own right time feels like it passes by

991
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:26,520
us at the start it doesn't feel us

992
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:28,200
threatening emotionally yeah I've been

993
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:30,160
sick for a week I've been sick for 2

994
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:32,240
weeks the hands of time start to feel

995
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:35,200
heavy when it goes on too long you're

996
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:37,839
not quite better you're not you're even

997
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:39,680
getting worse and now time becomes

998
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:42,000
doctor appointments and your care

999
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:44,319
schedule time is about how much energy

1000
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,520
you have how much space you have around

1001
00:39:44,319 --> 00:39:48,599
your illness to do what you need to do

1002
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:50,240
life can change when you're sick causing

1003
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:52,760
restrictions making us feel everything

1004
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:55,800
is so difficult we have to slow

1005
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:58,560
down and when you heal and when you

1006
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:00,760
start healing

1007
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:04,319
everything just speeds

1008
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:06,680
up everything just moves forward it's as

1009
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:08,640
if you're bypassing time is as if you're

1010
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:10,440
moving past time and moving ahead of

1011
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:12,960
time as you're healing it's an

1012
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:15,960
incredible experience incredible feeling

1013
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,839
healing the feeling of healing itself

1014
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:21,400
you know what that feels like you know

1015
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:24,040
when wait a minute I'm actually better

1016
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:25,760

00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:27,520
calming down wait a minute it's

1018
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,880
intermittent now instead of being all

1019
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,920
the time wait a minute something's

1020
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:33,960
changing something's happening I'm

1021
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:37,560
healing I'm moving forward that's a

1022
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:41,079
feeling that's an experience that is so

1023
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:42,599
beautiful so amazing all on its own and

1024
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:44,200
you can feel that experience if you

1025
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:46,480

1026
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:49,280
experience if you haven't yet keep that

1027

in mind you'll get in touch with that

1028
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:54,520
experience and that feeling of I am

1029
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:56,720
healing and I am moving on medical Med

1030
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:58,359

1031
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,640
that could have never gotten healed

1032
00:40:58,359 --> 00:41:02,960
anywhere else it heals people that were

1033
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:05,440
so wounded and so bad off from years of

1034
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:07,160
being sick and had no options anymore

1035
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,440
and they lost hope and it healed them

1036
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:11,480
medical meme information moves people

1037
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:13,119

1042
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:27,040
back into life you could be in that

1043
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:27,040
position and get there you can

1044
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:35,119

dream a lot of people

1073
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,720
dream different ways when they're sick

1074
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:59,680
when they're really sick they dream of

1075
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:01,800
being sick sick and how difficult it is

1076
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:04,240
but they also dream of moments when they

1077
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:06,440
weren't sick and they were strong and

1078
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:08,280
they felt good and they have dreams

1079
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:09,800
where they felt good and they were

1080
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:11,280
living their life and they wake up from

1081
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:15,599
the dream and they're like I'm not there

1082
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:18,280
yet that was in the past that was it

1083
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:21,000

out what did I do did I push it too hard

1091
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:39,760
as I was trying to heal you got to look

1092
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:41,400
at all these things did I get some

1093
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,480

00:44:11,559 --> 00:44:15,400
happen with my girlfriend keep in mind

1111
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,960
that there's so many things that can

1112
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:18,839
happen emotionally that can kick us down

1113
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:20,640
a notch we're like boom so we're trying

1114
00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:23,880
to get up and we're getting kicked down

1115
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:26,319
did I catch C you know did I catch like

1116
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:28,520
you know what I mean did I catch the flu

1117
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:31,160
did I catch something and I was sick for

1118
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:32,760
a few weeks ago and now my neurological

1119
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:35,240
problems are worse but really it's

1120
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:37,200
because you're recovering from Co or

1121
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:39,359
you're recovering from the flu three

1122
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:41,119
weeks ago or a month ago because what

1123
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:43,200
happens when people get a flu they get a

1124
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:45,200
cold whatever you want to call it and

1125
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,599
you're you're you're blowing out snot

1126
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:49,079
and you're you're coughing and

1127
00:44:46,599 --> 00:44:50,400
everything else and now you're

1128
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:52,480
recovering you're recovering there's

1129
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,200
this weird lag time response that

1130
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,920
happens there's this wake that happens

1131
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:58,760
and now your neurological problems a

1132
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:00,000
month later are down here a little bit

1133
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:01,800
could have been when you started some

1134
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,160
cats claw around that area you started

1135
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:05,880
some cats claw do your due diligence

1136
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:08,079
make sure you're looking at everything

1137
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:09,920
you can a lot of people are so sick

1138
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:11,880
right now from pathogens going around

1139
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:13,400
right now they are bed RDS keep that in

1140
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:16,800
mind right

1141
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:19,000
now people are bedridden because of the

1142
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:22,319
flu and the cids that are actually going

1143
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:26,000
around right now it's bad right now like

1144
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:27,800
today and next month the month after

1145
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,680
that there's some bugs go it around

1146
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:31,400
right so people can actually kind of

1147
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:33,440
hold on to those they catch it they hold

1148
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:35,200
on to it they're coughing they're just

1149
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,559
you know doing their thing and then they

1150
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,119
get dragged down a little bit with

1151
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:40,520
neurological problems it becomes a

1152
00:45:38,119 --> 00:45:42,599
trigger so check that out too like in

1153
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:45,480
your life and your references and go

1154
00:45:42,599 --> 00:45:47,920
back into your journal and look and then

1155
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:49,760
Foods that's important too okay Foods

1156
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,319
matter if you're feeding something

1157
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,839
that's creating your neurological

1158
00:45:51,319 --> 00:45:55,520
problem what are you feeding your

1159
00:45:52,839 --> 00:45:57,960
neurological problem which is meaning

1160
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:00,960
like neurological viruses neurological

1161
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:03,839
pathogens what are you feeding you know

1162
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:06,280
those pathogens is it the foods that are

1163
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:08,880
creating more trouble creating more

1164
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:10,839
neurotoxins or anything like that what

1165
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,599
are you doing did you stop your celery

1166
00:46:10,839 --> 00:46:15,240
juice have you even drank your celery

1167
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:18,559
juice what's you know all these things

1168
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:21,880
play a role while you're trying to heal

1169
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:24,359
so you might be doing some propis and

1170
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:27,800
then you're having a down cycle but

1171
00:46:24,359 --> 00:46:30,200
propolis can't create a down cycle

1172
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:32,680
that's how it works cats Cola can't

1173
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:34,680
create a a down cycle propolis can't

1174
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:37,240
create a down cycle so what's happening

1175
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:39,559
in your life examine it take a look and

1176
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:41,960
see what's going on or were you already

1177
00:46:39,559 --> 00:46:43,960
getting sick and thank God you're doing

1178
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:45,720
the propolis or whatever you're doing

1179
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:47,640
you know and did you have a medical

1180
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:49,720
treatment did you have something else

1181
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:51,640
out there did you have an x-ray did you

1182
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:54,680
have radiation exposure didn't know it

1183
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:56,319
did you get a pesticide drift hit hits

1184
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:58,520
you from the apartment building next

1185
00:46:56,319 --> 00:47:00,119
door from somebody spraying it guy had a

1186
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:02,920
mask on he was just spraying it like

1187
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:05,400
this all in the yard you got to look at

1188
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:08,200
everything but you got to also have

1189
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:10,079
faith and trust in the tools but you got

1190
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:12,000
to look at everything else you have to

1191
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:15,280
it's important to look at everything

1192
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:18,720
else but no propolis does not cause a

1193
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:21,440
down cycle propolis is one of well wait

1194
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:23,960
a minute well what kind of propolis

1195
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:25,640
who's propolis that all stuff is there

1196
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:27,240
alcohol in it is there junk in it what

1197
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:29,359
kind of that's a whole whole another

1198
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:31,480
game all on its own you know a lot of

1199
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:33,359
people don't know about a good propolis

1200
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:35,200
they don't know about like say vimer

1201
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:36,760
propolis or something else they just

1202
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:39,480
they have no

1203
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:42,359
idea but it's a good question and keep

1204
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:42,359
the questions coming

1205
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:48,200
in if you have hyper

1206
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:51,440
sensitivities your nerves become hyper

1207
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:54,280
sensitive keep that in mind anything can

1208
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:57,480
also rock the boat a chemtrail can rock

1209
00:47:54,280 --> 00:48:01,359
the boat one day anything can the heat

1210
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:03,680
index can rock the boat exercising one

1211
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:05,200
day you know you're doing a sweat and

1212
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:07,359
everything you're a little dehydrated

1213
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:09,480
that can rock the boat maybe you're not

1214
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:11,000
hydrating enough so many people don't do

1215
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:13,359
enough for themselves are you drinking

1216
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,240
coconut water you drinking celery juice

1217
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:18,680
listen to the chemical sensitivity and

1218
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:21,480
food sensitivity podcasts on medical

1219
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:23,040
mean podcast at Apple podcast everybody

1220
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:24,599
wants to heal can I read this little

1221
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:28,319
spot for you guys everybody wants to

1222
00:48:24,599 --> 00:48:31,559
heal nobody does doesn't want to

1223
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:34,119
heal no one wants to be sick or suffer

1224
00:48:31,559 --> 00:48:35,839
emotionally no one is afraid of healing

1225
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:37,920
no one has a fear of healing that's

1226
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:39,559
secretly holding on that's secretly

1227
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:42,079
holding them back from getting better

1228
00:48:39,559 --> 00:48:45,960
nobody is being held back because they

1229
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:47,359
have a fear of healing keep that in mind

1230
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:49,680
because I'm seeing it more and more

1231
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:52,440
about manifestation out there and you

1232
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:56,280
know look I'm I'm not out there to just

1233
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:58,359
rip into people I've been I've you know

1234
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:00,400
it's not my thing to just rip into

1235
00:48:58,359 --> 00:49:02,040
people like that where like manif if I

1236
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:04,520
don't like you know

1237
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:06,559
manifestation or something like that

1238
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:08,359
it's not that I don't like manifestation

1239
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:10,240
it's just

1240
00:49:08,359 --> 00:49:12,440
that it's

1241
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:14,240
like if someone's sitting there and they

1242
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:15,720
got a virus and the virus is creating

1243
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:18,640
chronic fatigue syndrome and the brain

1244
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:21,680
is swelling and they got Amy you know

1245
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:24,079
CFS and they can't even driving a car

1246
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:25,720
and they're just falling apart it's like

1247
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:27,200
manifestation is not something I'm

1248
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:29,319
worried about I'm worried worried about

1249
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,200
getting that virus killed off killing

1250
00:49:29,319 --> 00:49:32,760
that

1251
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:35,559
virus getting the body would it needs to

1252
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:37,200
fight that virus getting them recovered

1253
00:49:35,559 --> 00:49:38,880
and if you want to play in manifestation

1254
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:40,920
land after that you can play in

1255
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:42,240
manifestation land all you want I just

1256
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:45,200
want you better you know what I mean

1257
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:49,040
it's like and that's the problem when

1258
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:51,400
manifestation kind of crawls into crawls

1259
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:54,359
into the chronic illness world it's a

1260
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:56,160
tricky tricky blend you know the

1261
00:49:54,359 --> 00:49:57,880
manifestation movement was really

1262
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,720
originally about people that weren't

1263
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:01,880
sick at all they just weren't sick there

1264
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:04,960
was lesser numbers of people being sick

1265
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:06,680
it was for people who were just you know

1266
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,559
they wanted more in their life and they

1267
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:10,799
wanted good things to happen and it's

1268
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:12,760
fun right and people can believe in it

1269
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:15,520
and work with that right but the

1270
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:17,880
manifestation thing flung into the

1271
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:19,400
chronically ill world and then made

1272
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:22,000
everybody in the chronic illness World

1273
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:24,960
think they manifested their sickness

1274
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:27,319
that's where the problem went it's not

1275
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:30,520
that I personally

1276
00:50:27,319 --> 00:50:33,200
you know can't tolerate or disagree or

1277
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:36,400
hate manifestation that's not it at all

1278
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:39,000
manifestation mixed into the chronic Leo

1279
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:41,440
world like a big bag of nuts mixed up

1280
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:43,359
and what happened was it was like a lot

1281
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:45,400
of leaders and manifestation that would

1282
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:47,760
say you're the reason why you're sick

1283
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:49,839
you created it you did this to yourself

1284
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:52,480
you wish this upon yourself you

1285
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:54,240
manifested this now you got to manifest

1286
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:56,040
out of this sickness and a lot of people

1287
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:57,400
who chronic leil and sick are trying to

1288
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:59,920
manifest out out of the sickness but

1289
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:01,480
they're not getting better how come

1290
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:03,559
they're trying to manifest them then

1291
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:04,839
they all of a sudden hate themselves

1292
00:51:03,559 --> 00:51:06,200
they all of a sudden doubt themselves

1293
00:51:04,839 --> 00:51:08,640
and they hate themselves because they're

1294
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:10,920
like wait a minute I can't even manifest

1295
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:13,839
properly here I am bedridden on couch

1296
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:16,040
Island and and Mattress Island and

1297
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:17,520
obviously I must have created this

1298
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:19,040
because everybody else who's manifesting

1299
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:21,720
such good things are doing great things

1300
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:23,920
out there and they're fine I'm bedridden

1301
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:25,799
so I'm trying to manifest myself out of

1302
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:28,640
this but I can't seem to so I'm a

1303
00:51:25,799 --> 00:51:30,799
failure even more not only did I create

1304
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:32,480
my sickness and illness manifesting the

1305
00:51:30,799 --> 00:51:35,359
wrong way or whatever it was that

1306
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:37,319
created this I am now a failure because

1307
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:38,760
I can't get out of it and I'm sick and I

1308
00:51:37,319 --> 00:51:42,920
must have done this to myself and I

1309
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:45,520
created it for myself that's demented

1310
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:48,599
and that's sick not the person who

1311
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:49,839
thinks that but the manifestation laws

1312
00:51:48,599 --> 00:51:52,799
that have been thrown upon the

1313
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:55,480
chronically ill in the last five six

1314
00:51:52,799 --> 00:51:57,240
years seven years and just eight years

1315
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:59,799
and I've watched that happened where it

1316
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:01,119
was like a storm coming over The Chronic

1317
00:51:59,799 --> 00:52:03,760
leil

1318
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:06,200
like the manifestation

1319
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:07,640
storm and the chronically old people

1320
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:09,920
these poor people suffering and

1321
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:13,000
struggling sick for 10 15 years and it's

1322
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:14,920
just like mixed just you know boom piled

1323
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,799
on top of them everybody was like I must

1324
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:18,599
have created this I must be sick because

1325
00:52:16,799 --> 00:52:22,079
I must have manifested it I must have

1326
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:25,440
made this happen and it's sad no you got

1327
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:28,480
sick because of other reasons you got

1328
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:32,280
sick because of yeah epine bar shingles

1329
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:34,240
cyega virus you got sick because hhb6

you got sick because of toxic heavy

1333
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:43,200
metals you got sick because of all these

1334
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:44,680
solvents and pharmaceutical poisons and

1335
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:47,160
all this other stuff that got into your

1336
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:49,400
body and yeah you didn't help yourself

1337
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:50,680
out by not knowing what to eat and you

1338
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,559
were eating things that you probably

1339
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:53,760
should have been eating and you're

1340
00:52:51,559 --> 00:52:56,680
seeing some of that right here right and

1341
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:58,240
you're seeing that here sure sure but

1342
00:52:56,680 --> 00:53:00,480
you you know you didn't know you're just

1343
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:02,520
eating to survive you're just eating to

1344
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:04,880
try to just get through another day it's

1345
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:08,040
not your fault but either

1346
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:09,680
way you got sick along the way because

1347
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:11,839
of all these other reasons and maybe it

1348
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:14,640
was emotional stress adding to it maybe

1349
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:16,720
it was emotional abuse adding to it and

1350
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:18,520
maybe you got injured in many ways

1351
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:20,480
emotionally and abused emotionally and

1352
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:22,119
that packed on to the mercury poisoning

1353
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:23,640
and all the other vital issues and now

1354
00:53:22,119 --> 00:53:25,880
you're really sick and now you got every

1355
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:28,920
symptom in the book and then

1356
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:30,359
manifestation comes along like we got

1357
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:32,480
the answers for everything you just have

1358
00:53:30,359 --> 00:53:34,400
to manifest it and get yourself out

1359
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:36,480
that's all it really is you know and

1360
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:39,040
then and then whoa you're sick because

1361
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:41,480
that you caused that that's your problem

1362
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:42,920
20 doctors you saw that they didn't they

1363
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:44,440
don't know you know why you're sick you

1364
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:46,839
don't have the answer so you must have

1365
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:50,960
manifested this or it's all in your

1366
00:53:46,839 --> 00:53:50,960
head and that's that's what I don't

1367
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:57,640
like there's also a trusting wire within

1368
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:59,440
us that's been taking advantage of by

1369
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:01,839
Industries this has created a

1370
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:04,400
brainwashing within us a me mechanism

1371
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:06,240
inside us that wants permission to do

1372
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:08,880
harmful things to

1373
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:10,680
ourselves people want permission to do

1374
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:13,920
harmful things to themselves this the

1375
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:15,839
desire for health is so strong inside us

1376
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:17,760
that we'll try to look for answers about

1377
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:21,359
why anything that's harmful could be

1378
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:23,799
good for us I just saw an article that

1379
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:26,400

like too much of it too much of it

1404
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:36,280
medical medum information out there only

1405
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:40,319
only used chocolate for a couple of

1406
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:43,079
things one is to get people off of

1407
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:44,079
heroin it was a tool to get people off

1408
00:55:43,079 --> 00:55:47,280
of

1409
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:51,319
heroin it was a tool to get people off

1410
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:54,640
of cigarettes to use chocolate like a

1411
00:55:51,319 --> 00:55:56,799
really high quality cacao to get you off

1412
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:58,559
of cigarettes so medical me information

1413
00:55:56,799 --> 00:56:00,359
throughout the years and I used to try

1414
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:02,359
to help people they used to come to my

1415
00:56:00,359 --> 00:56:05,520
office throughout the

1416
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:07,760
decades and and spirit of compassion

1417
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:10,119
said chocolate's not good for somebody

1418
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:11,720
who's chronically ill chocolate will not

1419
00:56:10,119 --> 00:56:13,599
help their adrenals chocolate will

1420
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:15,079
destroy their adrenals CH chocolate will

1421
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:17,720
do all these things if they regularly

1422
00:56:15,079 --> 00:56:19,799
eat it but Spirit of compassion said

1423
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:22,640
it's either that or the heroin kills

1424
00:56:19,799 --> 00:56:24,280
them it's either that or the other drug

1425
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:26,520
kills them it's either that or they

1426
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:28,359
can't get off of smokes it's either that

1427
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:31,240
or if they can't get now they can't get

1428
00:56:28,359 --> 00:56:35,640
off of vape and you there's a way to use

1429
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:37,839
it as a leverage until they can get off

1430
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:41,119
of something that's literally killing

1431
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:44,599
them fast to get them all of a sudden on

1432
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:46,680
something that you know is you know much

1433
00:56:44,599 --> 00:56:49,160
less

1434
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:50,880
aggressive theah says over there in

1435
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:53,039
YouTube he has a podcast about using

1436
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:57,880
chocolate for

1437
00:56:53,039 --> 00:56:57,880
addiction I forgot about that

1438
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:04,440
everybody wants to

1439
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:06,640
heal everybody wants to

1440
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:07,960
heal so I'm talking about the trusting

1441
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:10,480
wire so I want to go a little bit more

1442
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:13,000
into this is really good okay right here

1443
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:14,319
all right the desire for health is so

1444
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,920
strong inside of us that we'll try to

1445
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:17,760

1451
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:35,880

kill their liver or whatever they're

1458
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:49,559
going to do right it's not helping them

1459
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:51,039
out and then a demon comes out again and

1460
00:57:49,559 --> 00:57:53,160
puts it out the industry and it's just a

1461
00:57:51,039 --> 00:57:55,400
demon industry says red wine is good for

1462
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:57,559
you again and does it all over again so

1463
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:59,240
people in their are like you know after

1464
00:57:57,559 --> 00:58:01,599
they've destroyed their health you know

1465
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:02,920
in universities and college and drank

1466
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:04,440
themselves practically to death and

1467
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:05,799
they're trying to recover all of a

1468
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:07,640
sudden they hear a demon out there in

1469
00:58:05,799 --> 00:58:09,520
the industry say red wine is good for

1470
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:10,720
you so they go back to drinking red wine

1471
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:12,280
and they think it's good for them they

1472
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:13,720
drink it when they're pregnant they

1473
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:15,240
drink it when they're two weeks pregnant

1474
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:17,079
three weeks pregnant they just whatever

1475
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:18,960
they're drinking it and they're just

1476
00:58:17,079 --> 00:58:21,000
back to you know doing something stupid

1477
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:22,559
again and then when they get past it and

1478
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,280
they realize the red wine is making them

1479
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:26,480
bloated and sick and not good and

1480
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:27,920
they're getting sick a demon in the

1481
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:29,480
industry comes out again and puts out

1482
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:31,559
another article and says red wine is

1483
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:35,400
good for you it it's almost like a

1484
00:58:31,559 --> 00:58:35,400
massive trick that's it's

1485
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:40,599
unbelievable we want validation that

1486
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:42,440
hurting ourselves is actually good for

1487
00:58:40,599 --> 00:58:44,520
us this can make it seem as if

1488
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:47,000
self-sabotage is part of our innate

1489
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:49,000
emotional nature as if we want to harm

1490
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:51,119
ourselves when we really don't we don't

1491
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:54,720
want to harm ourselves we don't and our

1492
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:57,799
soul is saying don't harm me don't harm

1493
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:59,240
me we don't self-sabotage because we

1494
00:58:57,799 --> 00:59:00,599
want to make ourselves sick we

1495
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:02,559
definitely don't want to do it to make

1496
00:59:00,599 --> 00:59:04,480
ourselves sick that's for sure we

1497
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:07,160
self-sabotage because we're taught to

1498
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:10,359
self-sabotage we're conditioned to

1499
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:12,119

intense stress or need a shift from from

1629
01:04:25,839 --> 01:04:29,400
a long-standing chronic illness or

1630
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:31,039
roller coaster Rod which everybody ends

1631
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:33,559
up on when they're sick they're

1632
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:35,839
chronically sick for a long time medical

1633
01:04:33,559 --> 01:04:38,160
mem shock therapies are critical to this

1634
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:40,039
day and age because that's what's

1635
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:42,960
happened here the reason I'm going to

1636
01:04:40,039 --> 01:04:44,400
the medical meme shock therapies is

1637
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:46,640
things have gotten so bad out there like

1638
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:48,200
I said how I opened up this episode with

1639
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:50,400
about people aren't thinking right

1640
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:52,240
people aren't feeling good the amount of

1641
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:55,039
sickness and illness is going crazy

1642
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:57,760
people are dying left and right just

1643
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:59,440
dropping out there there are protocols

1644
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:00,880
in this book for neurological symptoms

1645
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:02,640
and conditions I'm just talking about

1646
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:05,400
medical M shock therapies but there's

1647
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:08,520
full protocols in here in this book for

1648
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:11,319
neurological symptoms and so forth as

1649
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:14,319
Darkness tries to destroy all that's

1650
01:05:11,319 --> 01:05:16,599
good and if that doesn't sound right to

1651
01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:19,680
you if it

1652
01:05:16,599 --> 01:05:21,400
doesn't then you're in a really really

1653
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:24,799
mighty fine

1654
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:29,520
bubble you're in a mighty fine bubble if

1655
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:32,160
that's if that line right there doesn't

1656
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:34,680
resonate as Darkness tries to destroy

1657
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:37,400
all that's good we Rise Against Darkness

1658
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:40,839
using light created Health weapons to

1659
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:44,839
regain empowerment and that's what s so

1660
01:05:40,839 --> 01:05:47,799
is and that's what s so has done right

1661
01:05:44,839 --> 01:05:51,359
there Spirit of compassion has put in

1662
01:05:47,799 --> 01:05:51,359

matters when you're sick gaining Health

1666
01:06:02,319 --> 01:06:07,599
empowerment is

1667
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:09,480
critical as The Changing Times bring did

1668
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:12,160

01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:26,079
the quickening in these 40 years I've

1676
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:27,880
been trying to get the word out since I

1677
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:29,079
was a kid and spirit of compassion has

1678
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:32,200
been calling it The

1679
01:06:29,079 --> 01:06:33,880
quickening Spirit of compassion has be

1680
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:35,680
you know calling it Changing Times as

1681
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:38,559
these Changing

1682
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:41,079
Times okay bring additional stress Upon

1683
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:43,039
Us humankind goes into a deeper Health

1684
01:06:41,079 --> 01:06:45,799
deficit if you don't think humankind is

1685
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:47,319
going into a deeper Health deficit then

1686
01:06:45,799 --> 01:06:51,839
I got news for

1687
01:06:47,319 --> 01:06:54,520
you it is and the funny thing is too A

1688
01:06:51,839 --> 01:06:56,920
lot of those stats are just all being

1689
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:58,720
buried there are more sicker people out

1690
01:06:56,920 --> 01:07:00,200
there than anybody knows and sure you

1691
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:01,960
might be around people that aren't quite

1692
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:04,480
sick yet but they got something going on

1693
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:06,720
you know but whoa is it getting worse

1694
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:06,720
and

1695
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:12,640
worse humankind goes into a deeper

1696
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:15,279
Health deficit than during previous

1697
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:17,319
decades this is the decade right here

1698
01:07:15,279 --> 01:07:19,200
that we're in where it's all shifting

1699
01:07:17,319 --> 01:07:22,319
right now in spirit of compassion saw

1700
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:23,680
that coming 5 years ago and forewarn me

1701
01:07:22,319 --> 01:07:24,960
to forewarn everybody that we're going

1702
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:26,440
to see a level of sickness that we've

1703
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:29,119
never seen before before and guess what

1704
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:31,200
it's going there we're in it and we're

1705
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:33,480
in that decade right now wait till we

1706
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:33,480
get to

1707
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:41,960
2030 Spirit of compassion tells me that

1708
01:07:37,559 --> 01:07:43,520
2030 isn't a landmark of time because it

1709
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:49,039
lands on 3

1710
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:51,520
0 or 2030 because it's the end of the

1711
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:53,440
decade Spirit of compassion says it's a

1712
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:57,520
year that's going to sum up a lot of

1713
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:59,839
what this decade really really was about

1714
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:03,200
for a lot of reasons and it's going to

1715
01:07:59,839 --> 01:08:05,640
be extremely visible for so many people

1716
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:08,400
at that point of what's going on in the

1717
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:08,400
chronic illness

1718
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:14,000
World sickness now dominates the lives

1719
01:08:12,079 --> 01:08:17,759

the playing field where chemical and

1725
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:32,319
medical Industries are playing dirty

1726
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:34,480
against humankind and that's a big piece

1727
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:38,640
of it the industries are playing dirty

1728
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:40,600
with humankind cuz you're just a number

1729
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:43,040
is what you

1730
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:45,440
are and everybody has a number assigned

1731
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:47,040
to them that they're not even aware of

1732
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:51,880
on planet Earth because in the end

1733
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:51,880
you're just literally a number to the

1734
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:56,880
evildoers there's some great notes in

1735
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:59,040
here about the medical meme shock

1736
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:00,719
therapies you'll find suggestions for

1737
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:02,640
the best applications for various

1738
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:04,839

01:09:04,839 --> 01:09:08,600
incredible protocols not just the

1741
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:12,480
recipes which are amazing all on its own

1742
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:15,040
but the protocols are really um amazing

1743
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:16,520
too and then the brain shot therapies as

1744
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:19,480
well I haven't talked about brain shot

1745
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:21,120
Therapies in two years I think was it

1746
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:23,520
two years or a year and a half now or

1747
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:26,640
year and 3/4s don't quote me on that

1748
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:28,480

about these books I barely utter them I

1755
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:41,679
think that it's important to let people

1756
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:44,920
know they

1757
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:47,080

sceris and you know or take the symptoms

1778
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:33,280
individually don't even just take a

to look out for the troublemaker foods

1964
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:31,239
which I have written about extensively

1965
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:31,239
in the medical medium

1966
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:35,199
books okay we got a question right there

1967
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:39,199
on

1968
01:18:35,199 --> 01:18:41,679
YouTube sick boy on YouTube says will

1969
01:18:39,199 --> 01:18:44,040
the events be

1970
01:18:41,679 --> 01:18:46,320
broadcasted get ready for this answer

1971
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:48,000
okay we are looking into this to see if

1972
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:51,679
we can live

1973
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:55,320
stream so people who couldn't make it to

1974
01:18:51,679 --> 01:18:57,800
this these events could see it because

1975
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:59,400
of the limited space in the restaurants

1976
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:01,840
and they can't be there because there

1977
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:03,880
was only 200 tickets it's 120 for one

1978
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:07,000
restaurant 80 for another

1979
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:09,000
restaurant because of that we're going

1980
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:10,840
to see if we can live stream it and

1981
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:12,400
we're going to fight for it in the sense

1982
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:13,920
where we're going to try to get the

1983
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:15,239
right people with the right equipment

1984
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:16,840
and right everything and we're going to

1985
01:19:15,239 --> 01:19:19,639
do everything we can to try to live

1986
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:22,520
stream this if we can I can't make

1987
01:19:19,639 --> 01:19:24,520
promises I can't make promises on that

1988
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:26,679
but like true medical median fashion I

1989
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:28,840
will will do my best my team will do

1990
01:19:26,679 --> 01:19:30,880
their best to try to live stream this

1991
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:32,800
with everything we have and you never

1992
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:34,560
know we might be able to do it unless

1993
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:36,000
there's some massive glitch and we can't

1994
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:38,480
or something falls through we're going

1995
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:41,480
to give it a shot

1996
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:44,320
and if we can do the it's expensive to

1997
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:46,560
Li live stream live stream how about

1998
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:49,560
that that's pretty funny it's expensive

1999
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:53,120
to live stream in the way we like to do

2000
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:56,199
it which is like the professional Pro

2001
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:59,120
high quality High Tech way that's really

2002
01:19:56,199 --> 01:20:01,719
expensive so and um we're going to try

2003
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:04,520
to pull it off it's right anyway you

2004
01:20:01,719 --> 01:20:06,040

2005
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:07,960

2007
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:11,600

2008
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:13,000
