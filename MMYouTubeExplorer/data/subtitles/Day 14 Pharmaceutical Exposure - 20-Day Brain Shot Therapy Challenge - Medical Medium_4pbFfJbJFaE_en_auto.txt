[0.00 - 5.24] you doesn't mean you're not exposed to
[2.40 - 5.24] Pharmaceuticals
[6.24 - 11.40] exactly
[8.06 - 13.68] exactly I don't take any Pharmaceuticals
[11.40 - 16.76] I'm all natural
[13.68 - 19.20] I'm a vegan I take no Pharmaceuticals
[16.76 - 20.64] crazy thing is vegan steak
[19.20 - 22.80] Pharmaceuticals all the time they take
[20.64 - 25.32] antibiotics they take
[22.80 - 27.90] all kinds of different stuff drugs for
[25.32 - 29.40] their acne there's so many vegans out
[27.90 - 31.14] there that take they take
[29.40 - 33.48] Pharmaceuticals for their acne that's
[31.14 - 35.70] what they do every single day duh right
[33.48 - 37.38] there's all kinds of stuff like that and
[35.70 - 40.20] then there's
[37.38 - 42.18] uh animal protein people still they're
[40.20 - 44.70] on Pharmaceuticals as well all the time
[42.18 - 46.26] and they're doing animal protein people
[44.70 - 48.12] that are actually really into all
[46.26 - 50.34] natural living
[48.12 - 51.78] still take Pharmaceuticals everybody
[50.34 - 53.28] does it doesn't matter what side of the
[51.78 - 55.08] aisle you're on you can be on the beacon
[53.28 - 57.78] Isle you could be on the animal protein
[55.08 - 59.94] aisle they just do anyway but you might
[57.78 - 61.32] be somebody that's like no I'm not I
[59.94 - 63.60] don't take I just had to peel this lime
[61.32 - 66.48] you guys sorry about this I I don't take
[63.60 - 70.38] any Pharmaceuticals at all does it mean
[66.48 - 72.12] you're not exposed to Pharmaceuticals do
[70.38 - 73.32] you have a partner do you have a loved
[72.12 - 76.64] one do you have a boyfriend do you have
[73.32 - 79.86] a girlfriend who is on a pharmaceutical
[76.64 - 81.72] and you share bodily fluids with that
[79.86 - 84.30] girlfriend that boyfriend that partner
[81.72 - 86.64] or that husband that wife that fiance
[84.30 - 89.58] that whoever and
[86.64 - 93.48] you know are you are you sharing bodily
[89.58 - 96.54] fluids are they on an Acme medicine are
[93.48 - 98.70] they on a Statin huh how did you think
[96.54 - 101.28] about that one that one's interesting
[98.70 - 102.90] isn't it okay you're sharing bodily
[101.28 - 105.18] fluids with a loved one that's on a
[102.90 - 106.92] Statin how about a loved one that's on
[105.18 - 108.60] high blood pressure medication you don't
[106.92 - 110.88] take any Pharmaceuticals but you share
[108.60 - 112.92] bodily fluids with the with a loved one
[110.88 - 116.64] that's on high blood pressure medication
[112.92 - 119.40] think about that for a moment
[116.64 - 121.20] uh-huh and so it's just it's we
[119.40 - 124.76] pharmaceutical pharmaceutical exposure
[121.20 - 127.14] it's really easy to occur for anybody
[124.76 - 129.42] so that's important too anyway we're
[127.14 - 131.28] doing the pharmaceutical exposure shot
[129.42 - 133.20] would you believe it day 14 of the
[131.28 - 134.58] medical medium brain shot therapy
[133.20 - 136.38] cleanse challenge
[134.58 - 139.80] I have brain saver right here brain
[136.38 - 143.76] saver is critical it did you read the
[139.80 - 146.82] blood draw chapter in this book
[143.76 - 149.04] you guys you have to read the blood draw
[146.82 - 152.94] chapter in this book
[149.04 - 155.28] you you just have to seriously if you're
[152.94 - 158.04] ever considering getting any blood drawn
[155.28 - 159.26] on any level for anything routine
[158.04 - 163.20] anything

[198.54 - 201.78] um
[199.80 - 203.88] let's just do that so there's a chapter
[201.78 - 205.20] first of all the pharmaceutical exposure
[203.88 - 207.30] shot I just want to show it to you
[205.20 - 209.04] before we get started so that's it right
[207.30 - 211.44] there do you have what you need let's go

[237.18 - 244.20] about pharmaceuticals chapter 19 in
[240.48 - 246.90] brain saver foreign
[244.20 - 248.10] common Pharmaceuticals any of these ring
[246.90 - 250.56] a bell
[248.10 - 252.72] antibiotics

[257.48 - 262.92] anti-inflammatories uh-huh
[260.70 - 264.48] sleeping pills
[262.92 - 266.70] yeah
[264.48 - 269.00] biologics

[269.00 - 273.48] immunosuppressants yeah somebody might
[271.92 - 275.52] not know they're on any of these you

[295.68 - 300.08] exposure shot and I'm on page 19.
[300.36 - 305.22] common Pharmaceuticals I'm talking about
[302.64 - 307.44] Okay so
[305.22 - 309.74] antibiotics
[307.44 - 311.58] antidepressants
[309.74 - 313.16] anti-inflammatories
[311.58 - 316.44] sleeping pills
[313.16 - 319.56] biologics immunosuppressants
[316.44 - 322.74] prescription amphetamines
[319.56 - 325.58] Adderall whatever okay prescription
[322.74 - 325.58] amphetamines
[326.52 - 329.52] opioids
[329.96 - 336.54] and the list goes on statins
[334.02 - 338.88] blood pressure medications
[336.54 - 341.34] hormone medications
[338.88 - 343.92] thyroid medications I know a lot of
[341.34 - 345.30] people are on thyroid medications I know
[343.92 - 347.16] that
[345.30 - 349.26] steroids
[347.16 - 351.30] a lot of people are on steroids
[349.26 - 354.42] the pill
[351.30 - 357.48] a lot of people are on the pill right
[354.42 - 360.48] pharmaceutical alcohol
[357.48 - 360.48] interesting
[361.26 - 364.14] people don't realize how much
[362.58 - 365.58] pharmaceutical alcohol they're on they
[364.14 - 368.10] have no idea
[365.58 - 370.38] recreational drugs
[368.10 - 372.06] is anybody on recreational drugs these
[370.38 - 374.58] days
[372.06 - 375.60] man I think that business is booming out
[374.58 - 379.50] there
[375.60 - 381.84] so I'm on page 199 of brain saver if you
[379.50 - 384.68] want to know okay
[381.84 - 384.68] here we are
[385.44 - 392.04] if you're on medication
[387.54 - 394.86] or you received a medical treatment
[392.04 - 397.56] you're aware of it
[394.86 - 399.96] you may not be completely aware of what
[397.56 - 404.16] was in the medication
[399.96 - 407.46] you at least know it was administered
[404.16 - 410.52] what you might not know is what you were
[407.46 - 412.14] given in your Early Childhood or even
[410.52 - 415.98] babyhood
[412.14 - 417.96] that could still be in your system
[415.98 - 419.10] so that's a good point right there all
[417.96 - 420.96] on its own
[419.10 - 423.42] what have people
[420.96 - 425.76] been on in childhood
[423.42 - 427.32] what was administered to them in
[425.76 - 431.46] babyhood
[427.32 - 434.42] right we forget as we go along
[431.46 - 434.42] or don't know
[435.24 - 438.78] what you might not know is what you were
[437.04 - 440.64] given in your Early Childhood or even
[438.78 - 442.44] babyhood that could still be in your
[440.64 - 446.10] system
[442.44 - 448.94] it's very common to receive antibiotics
[446.10 - 451.14] early in life
[448.94 - 452.76] pre-memory is interesting right
[451.14 - 455.28] pre-memory
[452.76 - 457.38] even if you've never taken medicine
[455.28 - 460.16] Pharmaceuticals
[457.38 - 463.50] it still can be in your brain and body
[460.16 - 466.98] now and you don't know pre-memory you
[463.50 - 469.62] took it when you were a baby or a child
[466.98 - 471.54] so this is an incredible little chapter
[469.62 - 473.10] right here in the medical medium brain
[471.54 - 474.78] saver I'm reading out of okay you guys
[473.10 - 477.54] just wanted to
[474.78 - 480.06] start with us today and we're making the
[477.54 - 482.82] pharmaceutical exposure shot
[480.06 - 485.34] so it's a brain shot therapy I'm excited
[482.82 - 487.38] we're day 14 today
[485.34 - 489.18] water supply
[487.38 - 491.58] interesting
[489.18 - 494.72] more and more Pharmaceuticals are
[491.58 - 494.72] entering the water supply
[495.36 - 501.18] because people who are taking them then
[498.84 - 503.42] eliminate them when they go to the
[501.18 - 503.42] bathroom
[503.46 - 508.08] so think about that
[505.26 - 511.08] where does it all go
[508.08 - 515.34] it has to go somewhere no matter what
[511.08 - 518.70] billions of people going to bathroom
[515.34 - 521.34] well over a billion people easy on this
[518.70 - 524.10] planet or are on Pharmaceuticals
[521.34 - 526.56] more than that
[524.10 - 529.14] where's it going
[526.56 - 532.86] when they go to the bathroom
[529.14 - 536.16] this also means that medication laced
[532.86 - 538.68] water can become a part of our food
[536.16 - 540.90] through reservoirs
[538.68 - 544.26] irrigation
[540.90 - 547.08] Public Water Supplies
[544.26 - 549.36] well water near septic tanks
[547.08 - 550.80] and fish swimming in lakes rivers and
[549.36 - 552.66] oceans
[550.80 - 555.66] there are other ways to get this
[552.66 - 559.10] pharmaceutical laced water
[555.66 - 559.10] such as brushing our teeth
[559.74 - 563.06] cooking with tap water
[563.12 - 569.52] swimming in lakes and rivers pools pools
[567.48 - 572.10] swimming in poles
[569.52 - 574.62] and that's a whole thing there too if
[572.10 - 577.32] you're on vacation and you're swimming
[574.62 - 579.60] in a pool
[577.32 - 582.54] public pool
[579.60 - 584.70] you don't take Pharmaceuticals
[582.54 - 586.62] but maybe a whole bunch of people in
[584.70 - 588.66] that same pool take Pharmaceuticals and
[586.62 - 591.36] it's leaching out of their skin their
[588.66 - 593.76] pores their armpits
[591.36 - 596.70] and everywhere else
[593.76 - 598.86] that water is not being replaced
[596.70 - 601.38] that's sitting in a pool
[598.86 - 603.72] that water can be the same water in that
[601.38 - 606.54] pool for 10 years
[603.72 - 609.98] they don't drain pools and replace water
[606.54 - 609.98] it's too expensive
[610.80 - 615.78] it's not it's not a common practice
[613.50 - 620.16] so in hotels or anywhere else in public
[615.78 - 622.62] pools that water can be 10 years old
[620.16 - 624.96] thousands of people could have swam in
[622.62 - 627.30] it and pharmaceuticals could have
[624.96 - 629.40] leached off their bodies into that pool
[627.30 - 633.32] water and now pool water is never being
[629.40 - 633.32] tested for pharmaceuticals
[634.38 - 639.54] water parks
[636.96 - 641.34] restaurant water normally contains
[639.54 - 642.84] pharmaceutical runoff
[641.34 - 644.94] did you hear that one
[642.84 - 646.92] restaurant water
[644.94 - 647.94] the really good one there
[646.92 - 650.18] so
[647.94 - 654.78] you're eating in a restaurant that water
[650.18 - 656.76] most likely contains Pharmaceuticals
[654.78 - 657.96] all right let's go let's hit pools and
[656.76 - 660.54] water parks
[657.96 - 662.76] I'm on page 200 brain saver I mean this
[660.54 - 665.10] is an interesting topic right I mean I
[662.76 - 666.48] think this is really interesting when
[665.10 - 668.52] Spirit of compassion was giving me this
[666.48 - 671.40] information I was just like okay no I'm
[668.52 - 673.64] I'm hooked I'm hooked
[671.40 - 673.64] foreign
[674.76 - 680.40] water parks swimming in a pole or water
[678.18 - 683.10] park doesn't only lead to pharmaceutical
[680.40 - 685.68] exposure via the water supply
[683.10 - 687.72] there's also the runoff coming from
[685.68 - 689.82] people's bodies
[687.72 - 692.70] when you're swimming in a hotel pool
[689.82 - 694.74] here we go for example
[692.70 - 697.20] there's pharmaceutical runoff coming
[694.74 - 700.32] from people's skin and out of their
[697.20 - 701.66] armpits their genitals
[700.32 - 704.40] yeah
[701.66 - 708.26] Pharmaceuticals coming out of their
[704.40 - 708.26] genitals in the pool
[708.56 - 712.56] Pharmaceuticals are coming out of their
[710.40 - 714.06] mouth if they get water in their mouth
[712.56 - 717.18] how many people are swimming and they're
[714.06 - 718.32] spitting out water they're getting water
[717.18 - 720.54] in their mouth
[718.32 - 723.36] it's not like someone swimming in a pool
[720.54 - 724.92] and they close their mouth perfectly and
[723.36 - 726.90] they don't talk to their friend that's
[724.92 - 729.18] also swimming and they're swimming
[726.90 - 732.36] around with their mouth sealed shut and
[729.18 - 735.20] after they get out of the pool they dry
[732.36 - 735.20] off their face
[736.08 - 741.54] no people get water in and out of their
[738.78 - 744.00] mouth when they're swimming in the pool
[741.54 - 745.92] I've seen people just
[744.00 - 748.40] spitting water out of their mouth in the
[745.92 - 748.40] pool of course
[750.48 - 753.90] when you're swimming in a hotel pool for
[752.40 - 755.70] example there's pharmaceutical runoff
[753.90 - 757.52] coming from people's skin and out of
[755.70 - 760.02] their armpits their genitals their mouth
[757.52 - 763.82] if they get water in their mouth and
[760.02 - 763.82] even their urine and feces
[764.52 - 769.62] if they urinate defecate or pass gas in
[768.54 - 771.78] the poll
[769.62 - 774.00] the pool water becomes a filter for
[771.78 - 777.84] what's in the gas
[774.00 - 779.52] it's a pharmaceutical bath
[777.84 - 782.88] so which is interesting right here
[779.52 - 787.80] anybody who farts in a pool
[782.88 - 790.62] the pool becomes a filter for that gas
[787.80 - 795.02] that's coming out of the person
[790.62 - 795.02] the gas that's coming out of the person
[795.06 - 799.74] has Pharmaceuticals in the gas
[798.00 - 801.48] so if there's a whole bunch of people
[799.74 - 802.98] swimming around in a pool and they're
[801.48 - 804.48] farting in a pool and they're letting
[802.98 - 807.78] out gas
[804.48 - 809.64] that gas is loaded with particles of
[807.78 - 811.44] pharmaceuticals it's like a
[809.64 - 812.64] pharmaceutical aerosol coming out of
[811.44 - 814.92] their body if they're on anything
[812.64 - 818.70] thyroid medication statins blood
[814.92 - 821.58] pressure pills antibiotics
[818.70 - 822.84] the pill anything doesn't matter what it
[821.58 - 824.34] is
[822.84 - 827.22] um amphetamines prescription
[824.34 - 829.26] amphetamines all of it right so opioids
[827.22 - 831.84] whatever it is that they're on
[829.26 - 834.54] it's coming out if they were at the
[831.84 - 838.02] dentist and they had lidocaine they had
[834.54 - 840.78] novocaine lidocaine septicane whatever
[838.02 - 842.40] it is that they had it's in their body
[840.78 - 844.08] so they went to the dentist they just
[842.40 - 846.24] had lidocaine
[844.08 - 847.98] they had some dental work done they're
[846.24 - 851.96] swimming in the pool they fart in the
[847.98 - 851.96] pool lidocaine is now in the pool water
[852.96 - 856.92] syriana says chlorine doesn't eliminate
[855.00 - 859.50] this no
[856.92 - 860.28] chlorine is just for microbes you know
[859.50 - 863.22] like
[860.28 - 864.42] microbes microorganisms amoebas stuff
[863.22 - 866.76] like that
[864.42 - 870.12] stuff that's naturally happening because
[866.76 - 872.04] it's it's it's Standalone water
[870.12 - 874.56] the water is
[872.04 - 877.74] standing still
[874.56 - 880.62] so because it's not like it's just water
[877.74 - 883.20] sitting in a pool
[880.62 - 885.30] it has to stay fresh so they kill off
[883.20 - 887.16] microbes with chlorine chlorine doesn't
[885.30 - 888.66] eliminate any of this that's not an
[887.16 - 890.82] Eliminator of all the Pharmaceuticals
[888.66 - 892.80] Elena says oh my God I remember when I
[890.82 - 894.96] was swimming this summer in a pool it
[892.80 - 897.18] got so much worse and there was a time
[894.96 - 900.54] when someone
[897.18 - 903.42] threw up in a pool
[900.54 - 905.28] they just fished it out laugh out loud
[903.42 - 908.28] never drained the pole and we all went
[905.28 - 910.98] back they never drained the pole it's
[908.28 - 913.26] too costly for the hotels
[910.98 - 915.84] so and and water parks and stuff like
[913.26 - 918.90] that gotta remember if you're gonna
[915.84 - 921.42] drain 200 000 gallons of water
[918.90 - 923.46] you have to pay for that 200 000 gallons
[921.42 - 925.92] of water to get put back in hotels don't
[923.46 - 928.26] do that your water will stay there for
[925.92 - 931.38] 10 years 15 years unless the pool has to
[928.26 - 933.12] be fixed if the pool cracks or breaks
[931.38 - 935.46] then they have to drain the pool they
[933.12 - 937.08] have to eat the money and the cost they
[935.46 - 939.48] have to seal to crack and then they have
[937.08 - 941.88] to fill the pool back in right
[939.48 - 945.12] so what I'm trying to say is your pool
[941.88 - 947.22] water can Harbor Pharmaceuticals for 10
[945.12 - 949.64] years building up in the water it never
[947.22 - 949.64] goes away
[950.94 - 955.74] sure oh here's something interesting
[953.28 - 957.84] here so since the person that I read the
[955.74 - 959.40] comments said does Chlor chlorine get
[957.84 - 961.92] rid of it right
[959.40 - 965.76] chlorinating it sure they chlorinate the
[961.92 - 967.80] water to shock it for parasites bacteria
[965.76 - 970.86] and algae
[967.80 - 972.66] that chlorine doesn't remove any of the
[970.86 - 976.62] pharmaceutical residue in the water
[972.66 - 978.48] supply or the runoff from people's skin
[976.62 - 980.46] do you have the book I know the person
[978.48 - 981.66] said what about chlorinating does that
[980.46 - 984.72] help that means you might not have the
[981.66 - 986.64] book because it says it in here
[984.72 - 989.34] you should get this book and read the
[986.64 - 992.36] blood draw agenda chapter
[989.34 - 992.36] it's just incredible
[993.06 - 997.44] inner truth healing says oh my God makes
[995.16 - 999.60] so much sense
[997.44 - 1002.54] but not common sense
[999.60 - 1004.52] because it's not common about this
[1002.54 - 1007.22] information it's from Spirit of
[1004.52 - 1010.22] compassion yes it makes sense though
[1007.22 - 1012.92] Red Raven says oh people put babies with
[1010.22 - 1016.70] diapers on in the pool indeed they do
[1012.92 - 1018.92] and babies get Medical Treatments
[1016.70 - 1021.44] everybody's well aware of that ends up
[1018.92 - 1023.60] in the pool
[1021.44 - 1025.94] and adults get Medical Treatments
[1023.60 - 1028.06] everybody's aware of that ends up in the
[1025.94 - 1028.06] pool
[1028.52 - 1033.86] somebody says on IG free as a bird says
[1031.10 - 1036.68] 144 good number I think this is the most
[1033.86 - 1038.96] shocking info I heard so far even if we
[1036.68 - 1040.34] are on no meds we can get them from
[1038.96 - 1043.34] others
[1040.34 - 1045.56] never like fools
[1043.34 - 1047.36] every time Spirit of compassion gives me
[1045.56 - 1049.28] a piece of information from above it's
[1047.36 - 1050.90] the most shocking ever
[1049.28 - 1052.46] over and over again
[1050.90 - 1054.86] how many years
[1052.46 - 1057.86] how many times have I had to deliver the
[1054.86 - 1060.74] message of shocking information
[1057.86 - 1062.18] and then I get branded the worst crap
[1060.74 - 1064.40] hit pieces on me saying I'm
[1062.18 - 1065.60] fear-mongering hit pieces on me saying
[1064.40 - 1067.52] whatever
[1065.60 - 1070.04] and I'm just trying to deliver the
[1067.52 - 1071.06] information from above and yes it's
[1070.04 - 1073.52] shocking
[1071.06 - 1075.50] just like the blood draw agenda that's
[1073.52 - 1077.18] shocking too that blows people's minds
[1075.50 - 1078.98] when they hear about that it's just it's
[1077.18 - 1080.60] all the medical meme information is
[1078.98 - 1081.68] mind-blowing people deserve to know the
[1080.60 - 1083.84] truth so they can make their own
[1081.68 - 1086.12] decisions but I get to discriminated
[1083.84 - 1089.12] against and punished for it
[1086.12 - 1091.82] punished for I mean people they use a
[1089.12 - 1093.32] new tactic now oh oh reliable source I
[1091.82 - 1095.72] got a reliable source that says don't
[1093.32 - 1098.24] trust medical mediums information that's
[1095.72 - 1100.82] the new thing now on social
[1098.24 - 1102.38] oh yeah it's from reliable source that
[1100.82 - 1104.60] says you know don't trust medical
[1102.38 - 1106.16] mediums info oh really and what's a
[1104.60 - 1107.36] reliable source some other influencer
[1106.16 - 1109.76] that hates me
[1107.36 - 1112.28] anyway
[1109.76 - 1114.08] check this out sure they chlorinate the
[1112.28 - 1116.12] water to shock it from for parasites
[1114.08 - 1117.98] bacteria and algae that chlorine doesn't
[1116.12 - 1119.72] remove any of the pharmaceutical residue
[1117.98 - 1122.90] in the water supply or the runoff from
[1119.72 - 1125.60] people's skin those Pharmaceuticals stay
[1122.90 - 1128.00] in the pool water unless the pool is
[1125.60 - 1129.44] fully drained which guess what the poles
[1128.00 - 1130.64] are never fully drained they're never
[1129.44 - 1133.16] drained
[1130.64 - 1135.52] unless 10 years later there's a crack in
[1133.16 - 1135.52] the pool
[1137.12 - 1143.72] pool water can stay in the pool for a
[1141.14 - 1147.08] very long time without ever getting a
[1143.72 - 1150.20] repair that calls for it to be drained
[1147.08 - 1152.66] at a hotel for example you could have
[1150.20 - 1155.24] pharmaceutical filled water for five
[1152.66 - 1157.76] straight years or more
[1155.24 - 1160.34] where it concentrates year after year
[1157.76 - 1162.56] and doesn't dissipate
[1160.34 - 1166.40] and pools never get tested for
[1162.56 - 1168.74] pharmaceutical levels ever
[1166.40 - 1169.94] there are so many Pharmaceuticals in
[1168.74 - 1173.24] pool water
[1169.94 - 1176.24] no one could even imagine it is a
[1173.24 - 1179.98] pharmaceutical bath of hundreds of
[1176.24 - 1179.98] different kinds of pharmaceuticals
[1180.26 - 1183.44] all right
[1181.64 - 1187.10] I'm glad that's the most shocking thing
[1183.44 - 1188.84] you've ever heard because there's a lot
[1187.10 - 1191.36] of shocking stuff in the medical medium
[1188.84 - 1194.50] books way more shocking than that all
[1191.36 - 1194.50] right let's go into food supply
[1197.84 - 1200.84] antibiotics
[1202.64 - 1206.66] I can't help but I'm just laughing today
[1204.32 - 1210.08] I don't know why I'm laughing today but
[1206.66 - 1212.84] I am Danielle says why is 144 a good
[1210.08 - 1215.54] number I'm always seeing it and I was
[1212.84 - 1219.04] born at 144. listen to my telegram audio
[1215.54 - 1222.94] message on numbers I talk about 144
[1219.04 - 1222.94] talked about it for years
[1223.34 - 1226.54] since I was a kid
[1226.64 - 1232.58] okay food supply
[1230.02 - 1235.34] antibiotic fed animals
[1232.58 - 1237.44] translate to our ingesting antibiotics
[1235.34 - 1239.06] when we eat their eggs meat fish and
[1237.44 - 1241.04] Dairy
[1239.06 - 1242.78] even if you take care to find the
[1241.04 - 1244.82] highest quality best treated animal
[1242.78 - 1247.00] products for when you prepare food at
[1244.82 - 1247.00] home
[1247.06 - 1252.80] yeah
[1248.72 - 1255.62] but you don't eat antibiotic fed animal
[1252.80 - 1257.78] products do you
[1255.62 - 1260.12] so you think
[1257.78 - 1261.74] which is a great perspective measure if
[1260.12 - 1263.42] you eat animal products because you
[1261.74 - 1265.10] don't want to take any you don't want to
[1263.42 - 1267.32] eat animal
[1265.10 - 1271.16] products that are
[1267.32 - 1273.74] subjected to antibiotics
[1271.16 - 1276.38] and other Pharmaceuticals you've likely
[1273.74 - 1278.72] been unable to avoid eating conventional
[1276.38 - 1281.12] animal products when dining out or
[1278.72 - 1283.70] eating at a friend's house
[1281.12 - 1285.56] and that means antibiotic exposure so
[1283.70 - 1288.68] you mean to tell me
[1285.56 - 1290.36] there's not one meal you had
[1288.68 - 1293.06] over a friend's house or a family
[1290.36 - 1296.30] member's house or in a restaurant
[1293.06 - 1298.04] that you can guarantee
[1296.30 - 1302.18] was
[1298.04 - 1304.64] not an anti-antibiotic fed animal
[1302.18 - 1309.20] like you can guarantee it
[1304.64 - 1311.60] like there's not one meal you had
[1309.20 - 1314.66] eating out somewhere friends house
[1311.60 - 1317.24] family's house wherever
[1314.66 - 1319.88] now you can guarantee
[1317.24 - 1322.48] that there were no antibiotics fed to
[1319.88 - 1322.48] those animals
[1323.84 - 1328.04] you've likely been unable to avoid
[1326.42 - 1329.84] eating conventional animal products when
[1328.04 - 1334.06] dining out or eating at a friend's house
[1329.84 - 1334.06] and that means antibiotic exposure
[1334.58 - 1337.78] should I go on you guys
[1338.90 - 1342.86] also animals are treated with
[1340.40 - 1345.92] antibiotics when sick even if it's not
[1342.86 - 1349.30] an antibiotic fed animal or meat I'm
[1345.92 - 1349.30] going to go into details about that
[1349.70 - 1357.02] even if you take great care to avoid
[1353.42 - 1359.42] eating animals fed antibiotics now
[1357.02 - 1361.60] what about the first 10 years of your
[1359.42 - 1361.60] life
[1362.06 - 1367.94] was that 100 antibiotic
[1365.54 - 1370.94] free animal products
[1367.94 - 1373.70] were the first 20 years of your life or
[1370.94 - 1375.98] even the first 30 years of your life
[1373.70 - 1378.80] those antibiotics
[1375.98 - 1381.86] that you were exposed to during a
[1378.80 - 1385.58] previous chapter in your life's store up
[1381.86 - 1387.50] over time your entire lifetime basically
[1385.58 - 1389.96] what it said is
[1387.50 - 1393.14] you had antibiotic fed
[1389.96 - 1395.30] Pro animal products long ago and stored
[1393.14 - 1397.96] up in your body and never left
[1395.30 - 1397.96] never left
[1398.24 - 1402.86] Mina Levy says I am living proof of my
[1400.76 - 1405.32] experience
[1402.86 - 1407.54] I am livering proof my experience was
[1405.32 - 1409.88] terrifying until this man described what
[1407.54 - 1412.10] was going on
[1409.88 - 1413.78] not one doctor could
[1412.10 - 1415.58] you saved my life
[1413.78 - 1418.52] and my sanity
[1415.58 - 1421.52] he's the real deal and his source is
[1418.52 - 1423.92] knowledge to the haters of the solution
[1421.52 - 1426.82] not the problem
[1423.92 - 1426.82] thank you Anthony
[1427.06 - 1432.98] thank you Tamara says oh my God this is
[1430.34 - 1435.20] shocking what a barf face you know the
[1432.98 - 1438.02] emoji with the green barf coming out
[1435.20 - 1441.20] appreciate all your info I so cherish
[1438.02 - 1444.68] your books my books even more now thank
[1441.20 - 1447.50] you on YouTube thank you Tamara
[1444.68 - 1449.72] Andre here
[1447.50 - 1450.86] all right should I keep on reading a
[1449.72 - 1453.56] little bit more we'll talk about it
[1450.86 - 1455.84] because I'm a brain saver get a whole
[1453.56 - 1458.60] bunch of ingredients here for the
[1455.84 - 1460.78] pharmaceutical exposure shot I'm excited
[1458.60 - 1460.78] about
[1463.10 - 1468.10] keep in mind
[1465.40 - 1470.66] grass-fed animals
[1468.10 - 1472.54] grass-fed beef
[1470.66 - 1475.12] free range
[1472.54 - 1479.06] pastured chicken
[1475.12 - 1482.36] organic fed pigs
[1479.06 - 1484.76] still occasionally get infections and
[1482.36 - 1487.60] get sick and get treated with steroids
[1484.76 - 1487.60] and antibiotics
[1488.60 - 1494.24] here's how it works
[1490.54 - 1499.28] grass-fed cows
[1494.24 - 1502.96] don't get antibiotics and steroids mixed
[1499.28 - 1502.96] in with their grass
[1503.30 - 1506.80] they're a grass-fed cow
[1506.84 - 1511.70] but when the grass-fed cow gets sick
[1509.60 - 1514.76] which
[1511.70 - 1517.82] most of them do at one point
[1514.76 - 1519.44] they get treated for that sickness with
[1517.82 - 1522.26] antibiotics
[1519.44 - 1526.34] and steroids
[1522.26 - 1530.42] but they don't have to legally
[1526.34 - 1533.72] put that on the package that that cow
[1530.42 - 1537.98] that you're eating that steak from
[1533.72 - 1540.32] was sick for a week or two and was on an
[1537.98 - 1542.42] actual treatment you don't get told that
[1540.32 - 1546.98] it won't say it on the package instead
[1542.42 - 1551.18] it'll say grass fed beef
[1546.98 - 1553.64] because they didn't do a daily drug
[1551.18 - 1558.16] treatment mixed in their food like they
[1553.64 - 1558.16] do the industrial cows and animals
[1559.36 - 1564.50] keep in mind grass-fed animals grass-fed
[1562.10 - 1566.66] beef free range pasture chicken organic
[1564.50 - 1568.64] fed pigs still occasionally get
[1566.66 - 1571.84] infections and get sick and get treated
[1568.64 - 1571.84] with steroids and antibiotics
[1572.90 - 1577.22] if you're eating chopped meat grass-fed
[1575.54 - 1581.66] chopped meat
[1577.22 - 1585.56] remember that chopped meat isn't one cow
[1581.66 - 1587.36] that chopped meat can be a hundred cows
[1585.56 - 1589.40] a chopped meat
[1587.36 - 1591.02] is chop me
[1589.40 - 1593.30] that's mixed
[1591.02 - 1596.00] with a hundred other animals
[1593.30 - 1598.94] all ground up together
[1596.00 - 1601.04] maybe 20 of those hundred animals never
[1598.94 - 1603.14] experience a pharmaceutical in their
[1601.04 - 1604.64] diet obviously not in their diet they're
[1603.14 - 1607.94] grass-fed right never experience a
[1604.64 - 1611.18] pharmaceutical treatment for being sick
[1607.94 - 1612.44] but the other 80 cows that are ground up
[1611.18 - 1613.94] into that chopped meat to make that
[1612.44 - 1615.68] grass-fed Burger
[1613.94 - 1618.68] could have had
[1615.68 - 1621.22] treatments for being sick
[1618.68 - 1621.22] foreign
[1624.34 - 1628.88] against animal protein or animal protein
[1627.20 - 1632.24] eating
[1628.88 - 1634.88] I support everybody regardless of what
[1632.24 - 1636.50] diet they choose I just teach people how
[1634.88 - 1639.20] to do it better
[1636.50 - 1640.28] that's it I message information from
[1639.20 - 1642.26] above
[1640.28 - 1644.54] so they can learn how to take care of
[1642.26 - 1646.28] themselves better
[1644.54 - 1648.80] so if you're a vegan
[1646.28 - 1651.92] you can be a vegan I'm pro-vegan Pro
[1648.80 - 1654.74] plant-based but there's a way to do it
[1651.92 - 1656.24] that you can customize to heal because
[1654.74 - 1658.94] there's a lot of sick vegans out there
[1656.24 - 1660.50] they never heal and they're getting bits
[1658.94 - 1662.96] and pieces of medical meme information
[1660.50 - 1664.94] that's shrinkling out of the communities
[1662.96 - 1667.46] and they poach it and stuff so it's
[1664.94 - 1669.26] helping vegans out there
[1667.46 - 1672.14] and they don't say to back them in but
[1669.26 - 1675.26] the point is is as a vegan as a
[1672.14 - 1677.60] plant-based person someone might be
[1675.26 - 1679.40] this information is here for them to
[1677.60 - 1680.72] take it to the next level and still stay
[1679.40 - 1682.10] vegan or plant-based now if you're an
[1680.72 - 1683.18] animal protein person it's the same
[1682.10 - 1686.30] thing
[1683.18 - 1688.34] I don't shun shame or judge anybody for
[1686.30 - 1690.86] being an animal protein person
[1688.34 - 1693.08] in the medical medium community
[1690.86 - 1694.70] quite the opposite instead if that's
[1693.08 - 1698.06] what you want to do I want to help you
[1694.70 - 1700.52] do it right so you can customize
[1698.06 - 1702.56] and do what you need to do to heal if
[1700.52 - 1704.42] that's what you want to do
[1702.56 - 1706.58] so I don't want anybody thinking this is
[1704.42 - 1709.28] some weird you know animal protein
[1706.58 - 1710.66] campaign slash vegan thing that's not
[1709.28 - 1712.58] what this is this is just information
[1710.66 - 1715.16] from above that I have to message to
[1712.58 - 1717.16] everybody it's just the truth
[1715.16 - 1719.72] foreign
[1717.16 - 1723.14] Spirit lover says what about natural
[1719.72 - 1726.38] salt water pools like not public pools
[1723.14 - 1728.42] but for home it's not about if it's
[1726.38 - 1730.22] natural salt water
[1728.42 - 1732.56] Spirit lover
[1730.22 - 1735.08] or chlorine based
[1732.56 - 1737.00] which snaps or salt water kind of is is
[1735.08 - 1738.32] a type of fluorine based it's just
[1737.00 - 1740.30] different it's the natural salt right
[1738.32 - 1742.52] the point is Spirit lover
[1740.30 - 1744.08] it's not about that it's about who's in
[1742.52 - 1746.24] your pool
[1744.08 - 1748.58] it's a spirit lover you said
[1746.24 - 1751.16] but for home instead of a public pool
[1748.58 - 1752.48] right well yeah a public pool means you
[1751.16 - 1754.70] got a whole bunch of people going in
[1752.48 - 1757.94] there and all their gunks coming out of
[1754.70 - 1759.14] their body at home in your own pool I
[1757.94 - 1761.54] don't know who's swimming in your own
[1759.14 - 1764.54] pool I don't know who's in there
[1761.54 - 1767.18] is Auntie Jane in there is Uncle Bob in
[1764.54 - 1768.56] there are they on 10 Pharmaceuticals are
[1767.18 - 1770.06] they swimming around in your pool and
[1768.56 - 1772.22] then that pharmaceutical is in your pool
[1770.06 - 1774.56] for a lifetime unless you drain the
[1772.22 - 1776.48] water but the point is Spirit lover it's
[1774.56 - 1778.64] about who's in your pool doesn't matter
[1776.48 - 1780.68] what kind of
[1778.64 - 1783.04] system you have whether it's all salt or
[1780.68 - 1783.04] chlorine
[1784.40 - 1787.94] problem is with medical medium
[1786.38 - 1790.46] information over and over again there's
[1787.94 - 1792.98] one huge problem
[1790.46 - 1795.52] because it comes from above it does this
[1792.98 - 1795.52] all the time
[1796.94 - 1803.42] just close your mind and then people are
[1800.36 - 1805.52] just like what the f and then the word
[1803.42 - 1807.44] gets out they're always like fear Monger
[1805.52 - 1809.84] fear Monger instead it's more like
[1807.44 - 1814.18] Empower and Power
[1809.84 - 1814.18] because the information empowers people
[1817.40 - 1820.76] hit the thumbs up if you like this video
[1819.26 - 1823.36] if you don't like the video hit the
[1820.76 - 1823.36] thumbs up please
[1823.94 - 1828.26] keep in mind grass-fed animals grass-fed
[1826.28 - 1830.06] beef free-range bastard chickens we're
[1828.26 - 1832.64] getting that big still occasionally get
[1830.06 - 1835.34] infections get skin problems get sick
[1832.64 - 1837.86] and get treatments with steroids and
[1835.34 - 1839.30] antibiotics they're just not as
[1837.86 - 1841.10] saturated for the most part with
[1839.30 - 1843.44] antibiotics for chronic contagious
[1841.10 - 1846.38] infections or conventionally raised
[1843.44 - 1848.24] foods with the drugs in them that
[1846.38 - 1850.58] animals are on in the industrial places
[1848.24 - 1853.88] when chronic infections do occur with
[1850.58 - 1855.98] grass-fed animals raised free range and
[1853.88 - 1858.20] pastured some animals are out of
[1855.98 - 1860.96] commission for a while due to an ongoing
[1858.20 - 1863.66] infection that takes a month to treat
[1860.96 - 1865.04] once recovered the animal is back in the
[1863.66 - 1867.92] running again
[1865.04 - 1869.72] you're set free cow you're better now
[1867.92 - 1872.24] you were sick for a month and went into
[1869.72 - 1875.00] a different station on the farm and Now
[1872.24 - 1878.06] cal you're free you're free to roam and
[1875.00 - 1880.46] everything right oh let me see here and
[1878.06 - 1883.84] that's what happens it's like
[1880.46 - 1883.84] like cow is now free
[1884.54 - 1888.76] the cow's free to roam and everything
[1886.28 - 1888.76] right
[1891.02 - 1894.28] now once a cow's free
[1896.78 - 1901.34] yeah
[1898.34 - 1904.70] the cow goes back into
[1901.34 - 1907.64] playing reindeer games on the farm
[1904.70 - 1909.92] the cow might have been sick for a month
[1907.64 - 1913.04] and then put out a commission
[1909.92 - 1914.18] but the cow gets better and then goes
[1913.04 - 1916.16] back in
[1914.18 - 1919.36] for the slaughter later
[1916.16 - 1919.36] to be on somebody's table
[1920.12 - 1924.14] once recovered the animal is back in the
[1922.76 - 1926.90] running again
[1924.14 - 1929.78] it's still listed as grass-fed beef
[1926.90 - 1932.86] doesn't matter if your grass-fed cow was
[1929.78 - 1936.26] sick for a month it's still listed as
[1932.86 - 1938.60] grass-fed beef
[1936.26 - 1940.94] doesn't matter if your grass-fed cow had
[1938.60 - 1946.06] antibiotics and steroids and
[1940.94 - 1946.06] anti-fungals like they do
[1946.10 - 1950.66] you don't hear this stuff getting talked
[1947.90 - 1952.34] about in all the animal hate stuff like
[1950.66 - 1954.92] all the vegan stuff and all the
[1952.34 - 1956.18] propaganda out there everybody says
[1954.92 - 1957.80] they're an expert you don't hear any of
[1956.18 - 1959.42] this stuff talked about because
[1957.80 - 1961.46] you know you'll hear it talked about now
[1959.42 - 1964.72] now that the books are out right well it
[1961.46 - 1964.72] didn't come from medical medium though
[1965.90 - 1971.18] they'll say
[1968.00 - 1973.16] Liars it's still listed as grass-fed
[1971.18 - 1975.50] beef and ready for the market when the
[1973.16 - 1978.56] time comes we're shielded from this
[1975.50 - 1981.20] information it's kept from the inside
[1978.56 - 1984.44] goings on when you're in the market
[1981.20 - 1986.78] you're shielded from the fact that the
[1984.44 - 1989.78] grass-fed animals were still treated
[1986.78 - 1991.58] they still have drugs inside of them and
[1989.78 - 1995.26] they were put back on the market and
[1991.58 - 1995.26] they have the label of grass-fed beef
[1995.48 - 2000.16] you can't always avoid all these things
[1997.28 - 2002.68] the pharmaceutical exposure shot so you
[2000.16 - 2004.78] can get them out of your system you
[2002.68 - 2007.06] can't always avoid all of these things
[2004.78 - 2009.04] it's not about shutting your life down
[2007.06 - 2012.22] it's not about you can't live your life
[2009.04 - 2013.90] anymore it's not about being afraid it's
[2012.22 - 2015.76] just about being empowered so you can
[2013.90 - 2018.10] make choices I would like to know what's
[2015.76 - 2021.00] going on personally I would like to know
[2018.10 - 2021.00] what's going on myself
[2024.40 - 2028.00] laughs
[2025.78 - 2030.16] and having tools like these brain shot
[2028.00 - 2032.02] therapies is incredible because not only
[2030.16 - 2034.12] can we deep like know about it we can do
[2032.02 - 2037.96] something about it we think it's
[2034.12 - 2040.06] inconceivable that the animals have ever
[2037.96 - 2042.82] had something wrong with them
[2040.06 - 2046.96] there's no way in hell
[2042.82 - 2049.72] this package of grass-fed beef
[2046.96 - 2052.18] had an animal
[2049.72 - 2053.92] have something wrong with it there's no
[2052.18 - 2057.52] way in hell this package of grass-fed
[2053.92 - 2060.10] beef I'm holding my hand somehow this
[2057.52 - 2061.66] animal that once was an animal and now
[2060.10 - 2063.22] it's in this package wrapped with
[2061.66 - 2065.56] whatever
[2063.22 - 2068.68] and sealed in this package there's no
[2065.56 - 2071.76] way that this was a sick animal it says
[2068.68 - 2071.76] grass-fed beef you know
[2072.28 - 2076.18] we think it's inconceivable that the
[2074.32 - 2078.34] animals have ever had something wrong
[2076.18 - 2080.56] with them any kind of infection or
[2078.34 - 2082.84] illness it's inconceivable there's no
[2080.56 - 2085.06] way one animal had something wrong with
[2082.84 - 2087.34] it it's grass-fed it's pre-range
[2085.06 - 2089.38] pasteurized there's no way it had
[2087.34 - 2092.20] anything wrong with it
[2089.38 - 2094.30] I don't want you under the illusion that
[2092.20 - 2097.96] you're not going to get antibiotics from
[2094.30 - 2100.66] grass-fed meat because it's not true I
[2097.96 - 2103.90] don't want anybody under the illusion
[2100.66 - 2105.64] the scam illusion
[2103.90 - 2107.44] that you're not going to get any
[2105.64 - 2109.18] Pharmaceuticals from your grass-fed
[2107.44 - 2111.90] products and so forth and free range
[2109.18 - 2111.90] products and everything
[2114.70 - 2118.00] Marion
[2116.08 - 2123.12] McGinty
[2118.00 - 2123.12] McIntyre says blowing my mind today
[2127.12 - 2131.44] okay more pharmaceutical exposure
[2129.76 - 2133.86] sources are you guys ready you guys
[2131.44 - 2133.86] ready for this
[2134.68 - 2137.10] all right
[2137.98 - 2140.70] thank you
[2141.04 - 2143.82] sorry guys
[2144.76 - 2149.92] a lot of people get medication exposure
[2147.28 - 2153.46] from the flea or tick powder or cream
[2149.92 - 2155.86] they apply to their dogs and cats
[2153.46 - 2159.04] if you can tell me
[2155.86 - 2162.10] that you never had a tick collar or flea
[2159.04 - 2164.50] collar on your dog or cat
[2162.10 - 2167.80] if you can tell me you never put a flea
[2164.50 - 2170.56] powder or tick powder on your cat or dog
[2167.80 - 2173.64] if you can tell me they never received a
[2170.56 - 2173.64] medication before
[2174.76 - 2179.44] that would be amazing
[2177.04 - 2184.60] at least you don't have to get exposed
[2179.44 - 2187.84] right and it's okay I I love
[2184.60 - 2192.94] doggies and cats I love animals
[2187.84 - 2195.16] and um I would never ever shame a dog or
[2192.94 - 2197.14] judge a dog or cat or animal because
[2195.16 - 2198.64] they had to have a medication from the
[2197.14 - 2200.14] vet or anything
[2198.64 - 2204.84] I'm just saying that if there is
[2200.14 - 2204.84] exposure we got the brain shot therapy
[2208.06 - 2212.20] a lot of people get medication exposure
[2210.10 - 2214.12] from flea tick powders creams they apply
[2212.20 - 2218.10] to their dogs and cats or from flea and
[2214.12 - 2218.10] tick repelling pet collars
[2219.88 - 2223.42] intimacy
[2221.62 - 2225.64] is another form of pharmaceutical
[2223.42 - 2227.56] exposure for example kissing someone
[2225.64 - 2230.56] who's on medication
[2227.56 - 2233.86] I talked about that earlier
[2230.56 - 2236.56] then there are medicated creams that
[2233.86 - 2237.82] have a powerful out gas
[2236.56 - 2241.90] now
[2237.82 - 2244.26] I'm not trying to be like take this so
[2241.90 - 2244.26] far
[2244.84 - 2250.18] that it's like so mind-blowing
[2248.62 - 2254.22] but I'm just gonna tell you what happens
[2250.18 - 2254.22] at the stores at the grocery store
[2254.44 - 2259.66] a lot of people
[2256.18 - 2261.58] have medications that are creams and
[2259.66 - 2262.84] they rub them on all parts of their
[2261.58 - 2265.72] bodies
[2262.84 - 2268.30] it's one of the biggest pharmaceutical
[2265.72 - 2271.00] industry part there is
[2268.30 - 2273.58] creams
[2271.00 - 2276.22] creams that are pharmaceutical based
[2273.58 - 2278.38] drugs and creams
[2276.22 - 2280.36] everybody puts their creams on in the
[2278.38 - 2282.52] morning
[2280.36 - 2284.14] wherever they're going to rub it
[2282.52 - 2287.68] like wherever
[2284.14 - 2290.26] their butt wherever creams are big
[2287.68 - 2293.26] creams for their butt
[2290.26 - 2295.06] the rectums
[2293.26 - 2296.98] for hemorrhoids
[2295.06 - 2299.98] creams for everything
[2296.98 - 2301.96] creams for their skin rashes creams for
[2299.98 - 2304.54] their skin tags
[2301.96 - 2306.34] people are on creams
[2304.54 - 2308.56] and then they go to the grocery store
[2306.34 - 2310.78] after they creamed up
[2308.56 - 2312.88] steroid creams everything
[2310.78 - 2315.10] and now they're going through all the
[2312.88 - 2318.40] produce and they're rubbing their creams
[2315.10 - 2319.66] on all the produce and packaged food and
[2318.40 - 2322.06] everything
[2319.66 - 2323.14] but it's not just one person thousands
[2322.06 - 2325.60] of people going through the grocery
[2323.14 - 2327.52] stores and farmers markets
[2325.60 - 2328.62] and they're getting their creams on
[2327.52 - 2331.36] everything
[2328.62 - 2333.58] chemotherapy cream
[2331.36 - 2335.20] I can't tell you how many times Spirit
[2333.58 - 2336.64] of compassion has told me when I was at
[2335.20 - 2339.40] a farmer's market that someone's
[2336.64 - 2341.56] chemotherapy cream
[2339.40 - 2344.52] was rubbed on produce
[2341.56 - 2344.52] or something else
[2344.92 - 2348.46] so many people are on chemotherapy
[2346.96 - 2350.08] creams
[2348.46 - 2351.88] that's why they're at a farmer's market
[2350.08 - 2353.80] they're trying to eat healthier they've
[2351.88 - 2356.68] been diagnosed with cancer
[2353.80 - 2358.36] and they're using the creams
[2356.68 - 2360.40] foreign
[2358.36 - 2363.16] there's
[2360.40 - 2365.56] a lot of pharmaceutical creams
[2363.16 - 2368.14] so that are that it's it's incredible
[2365.56 - 2371.20] right how it works so so many people
[2368.14 - 2373.44] have creams on them and it's getting on
[2371.20 - 2373.44] everything
[2374.08 - 2378.10] so I'm not saying
[2376.42 - 2380.62] I mean we just got to live on planet
[2378.10 - 2383.56] Earth can't hide from it
[2380.62 - 2385.90] but that's why I like having tools
[2383.56 - 2388.00] so that if I'm getting some of that
[2385.90 - 2390.28] stuff in me here and there somehow
[2388.00 - 2391.96] grabbing this package grabbing that and
[2390.28 - 2395.76] I'm getting it in me
[2391.96 - 2395.76] I want to have a tool to help
[2396.64 - 2403.72] Danielle says I've worked at a ranch
[2399.64 - 2407.14] all grass fed every year they brand them
[2403.72 - 2408.88] and cut the balls off the steers and
[2407.14 - 2411.22] they give them a shot of antibiotics
[2408.88 - 2414.60] every single baby cow
[2411.22 - 2414.60] it's pharmaceutical exposure
[2415.78 - 2420.00] oh God that's awful
[2417.88 - 2420.00] um
[2423.94 - 2427.66] then there are medicated creams that
[2425.80 - 2430.42] have a powerful out gas
[2427.66 - 2432.28] a large variety of medicated creams from
[2430.42 - 2434.98] steroid creams to chemotherapy creams
[2432.28 - 2436.96] out gas a very potent pungent smell that
[2434.98 - 2438.88] the person using the cream is unaware of
[2436.96 - 2441.52] because they live in it breathing in
[2438.88 - 2444.52] this gassing is exposure
[2441.52 - 2446.98] but I talked about about the exposure in
[2444.52 - 2450.60] the stores right basic contact with
[2446.98 - 2450.60] shopping carts handles
[2451.78 - 2455.26] um
[2452.56 - 2456.82] Ardent Advent says all the things we
[2455.26 - 2460.26] don't even think about thank you for
[2456.82 - 2460.26] bringing awareness you're welcome
[2460.32 - 2465.28] basic contact with shopping cart handles
[2462.88 - 2468.30] shopping cart handles are a big one
[2465.28 - 2468.30] that's a big one
[2470.14 - 2476.40] if I have to grab a sharping a shopping
[2473.02 - 2476.40] cart handle sorry
[2476.74 - 2481.66] Linda kluskey says
[2479.92 - 2484.00] so the point of this is to let everyone
[2481.66 - 2485.68] know that no matter how healthy pure
[2484.00 - 2487.54] they think they are we all have
[2485.68 - 2489.82] Pharmaceuticals in our bodies yes so I
[2487.54 - 2492.58] would love to do something for people I
[2489.82 - 2495.16] would love to know they have tools
[2492.58 - 2496.66] so they can help themselves protect
[2495.16 - 2498.84] themselves defend themselves and so
[2496.66 - 2498.84] forth
[2505.18 - 2509.38] basic contact with shopping cart handles
[2507.46 - 2511.90] is another surprising source of exposure
[2509.38 - 2514.00] because those handles are
[2511.90 - 2517.18] where a lot of pharmaceutical residue
[2514.00 - 2519.28] resides not just bacteria and viruses
[2517.18 - 2521.98] and herpes and everything else that's on
[2519.28 - 2525.46] those shopping cart handles I take an
[2521.98 - 2528.18] alcohol wipe and I wipe the handle with
[2525.46 - 2528.18] an alcoholic
[2529.98 - 2536.68] often from pharmaceutical creams
[2533.44 - 2538.00] and sweat from individuals Palms so what
[2536.68 - 2540.00] I don't like about the shopping cart
[2538.00 - 2542.44] handles is because
[2540.00 - 2544.42] Pharmaceuticals come out of people's
[2542.44 - 2547.30] Palms
[2544.42 - 2548.62] their sweat from their palms they start
[2547.30 - 2550.98] holding the handles and pushing the
[2548.62 - 2550.98] handle through
[2551.74 - 2555.70] which contain pharmaceutical residue if
[2553.84 - 2557.50] they're on medication
[2555.70 - 2560.62] all right you guys want me to read a
[2557.50 - 2562.50] little bit more we okay
[2560.62 - 2566.52] foreign
[2562.50 - 2566.52] Pharmaceuticals and our brain
[2568.14 - 2572.74] Pharmaceuticals are manufactured to
[2570.40 - 2576.04] affect the brain or body in specific
[2572.74 - 2577.96] ways generally stimulating or
[2576.04 - 2579.82] suppressing certain neurological or body
[2577.96 - 2582.28] processes
[2579.82 - 2584.38] so when you take a medication it could
[2582.28 - 2586.18] very well be for the purpose of trying
[2584.38 - 2587.86] to enhance or subdue particular
[2586.18 - 2589.36] functions of the brain
[2587.86 - 2591.46] at the same time you know like
[2589.36 - 2594.78] antidepressants any
[2591.46 - 2597.42] uh any anti-anxiety meds
[2594.78 - 2599.68] benzodiazepines right at the same time
[2597.42 - 2601.96] Pharmaceuticals can affect the functions
[2599.68 - 2603.94] of the brain in ways that aren't always
[2601.96 - 2606.94] ideal
[2603.94 - 2608.86] metal says I'm not an animal eater but
[2606.94 - 2613.50] does this apply to the Kosher meat
[2608.86 - 2613.50] industrial industry too yes it does
[2615.58 - 2618.36] see
[2619.06 - 2623.02] there are side effects sometimes
[2620.86 - 2624.88] debilitating and life-altering and even
[2623.02 - 2626.26] creating a dependency that outweighs the
[2624.88 - 2627.88] original problem for which the person
[2626.26 - 2630.46] took the medication for so we all know
[2627.88 - 2632.44] that a lot of medications prescribed for
[2630.46 - 2633.70] people for their brains
[2632.44 - 2636.00] because their brains aren't working
[2633.70 - 2636.00] right
[2636.76 - 2643.62] but then a dependency happens and then
[2639.46 - 2643.62] the problem can worsen and so forth
[2644.92 - 2648.28] and that dependency outweighs the
[2646.66 - 2651.24] original problem the person even took
[2648.28 - 2651.24] the medication for right
[2651.34 - 2657.10] medications can be in general toxic to
[2655.06 - 2658.18] all areas of the brain here's how it
[2657.10 - 2661.30] works
[2658.18 - 2662.44] some on page 201 a brain saver just want
[2661.30 - 2664.42] to give you a little run down here
[2662.44 - 2667.48] before I go any further
[2664.42 - 2670.18] new people that popped on here okay two
[2667.48 - 2672.82] best books right now hands down
[2670.18 - 2675.16] in health history I can say that because
[2672.82 - 2676.90] I can judge these books I'm allowed to
[2675.16 - 2680.32] judge it myself and have an opinion on
[2676.90 - 2683.74] these books best books
[2680.32 - 2686.34] hands down greatest books of all time
[2683.74 - 2686.34] in history
[2686.38 - 2691.48] letting you know
[2688.18 - 2693.88] Miramar says I was going I was going to
[2691.48 - 2696.58] make this today now let's see wait
[2693.88 - 2698.98] I wasn't gonna make this today I thought
[2696.58 - 2701.14] I didn't need it now I'm making both for
[2698.98 - 2703.60] me and my daughter
[2701.14 - 2706.98] pharmaceutical exposure shot
[2703.60 - 2706.98] that's what marama is talking about
[2707.08 - 2711.88] hands down the best books
[2709.54 - 2714.28] truly and you'll know it when you read
[2711.88 - 2716.26] them I can judge him because the
[2714.28 - 2718.18] information came from above it wasn't
[2716.26 - 2720.40] I'm not being biased it came from above
[2718.18 - 2722.62] if I don't like it I can say I don't
[2720.40 - 2724.30] like it but they're incredible
[2722.62 - 2725.74] okay
[2724.30 - 2727.90] um
[2725.74 - 2730.78] Char dream says what if you have to take
[2727.90 - 2733.12] medications to live it's fine of course
[2730.78 - 2734.32] this isn't this isn't about stopping
[2733.12 - 2736.24] your medications if you're on your
[2734.32 - 2738.52] medications
[2736.24 - 2739.36] no this is about pharmaceutical exposure
[2738.52 - 2742.90] shots
[2739.36 - 2744.82] which means yeah you can take the book
[2742.90 - 2746.50] to your doctor or doctor can I take the
[2744.82 - 2747.94] pharmaceutical exposure shot
[2746.50 - 2750.88] it's apples
[2747.94 - 2754.06] it's lemons it's cilantro it's onion
[2750.88 - 2757.98] it's limes it's asparagus it's lemons I
[2754.06 - 2757.98] said that right can I take the shot
[2758.22 - 2761.80] foreign
[2759.88 - 2764.40] pharmaceutical shot is for recent
[2761.80 - 2764.40] exposure
[2765.22 - 2768.94] which is incredible
[2766.96 - 2771.28] and other medical medium information and
[2768.94 - 2773.44] stuff is from for past exposure but I
[2771.28 - 2775.06] like the pharmaceutical shot also for
[2773.44 - 2777.16] some past exposure too because past
[2775.06 - 2778.90] exposure can Leach out of our liver and
[2777.16 - 2782.52] become recent exposure so I like the
[2778.90 - 2782.52] Pharmaceuticals shop for that
[2783.10 - 2786.96] okay
[2784.84 - 2786.96] um
[2787.54 - 2790.84] I'd like to read a little bit more if we
[2789.04 - 2793.84] can
[2790.84 - 2796.18] let's see Polly Wren says Anthony I love
[2793.84 - 2798.10] your life so so much
[2796.18 - 2801.76] especially this brain shot challenge
[2798.10 - 2803.98] Hearts I prayed to catch this today
[2801.76 - 2806.20] because the timing usually clashes with
[2803.98 - 2808.84] my kids
[2806.20 - 2810.88] with my kids bedtime and here I am yes
[2808.84 - 2813.82] and yes you are and this is an amazing
[2810.88 - 2815.38] Live two-day talk about pharmaceutical
[2813.82 - 2818.82] stuff which is always fun to talk about
[2815.38 - 2818.82] I mean come on it is right
[2821.14 - 2826.66] okay medications can be in general toxic
[2824.86 - 2828.40] to all areas of the brain here's how it
[2826.66 - 2831.54] works
[2828.40 - 2831.54] he's got a brain over here
[2832.00 - 2837.12] excuse me guys I might have to take my
[2833.92 - 2837.12] Pharmaceuticals right now
[2837.16 - 2841.92] um
[2838.48 - 2841.92] and nothing to drink them with
[2841.96 - 2844.92] you guys don't mind right
[2846.70 - 2850.90] could I can I take it with my celery
[2848.62 - 2853.50] juice or is that is that not good I'm
[2850.90 - 2853.50] gonna take away
[2854.26 - 2857.94] let me just take it with some water here
[2862.00 - 2867.94] oh
[2863.32 - 2870.60] I'm joking that is an L-lysine capsule
[2867.94 - 2873.40] from vimergy my favorite company
[2870.60 - 2875.62] vemergy.com he's in Victor i m e r g
[2873.40 - 2878.38] y.com I endorse these guys their stuff
[2875.62 - 2883.44] is incredible and that is a lysine
[2878.38 - 2883.44] capsule licing capsule from beverages
[2884.14 - 2887.80] all right enough fooling around let's
[2885.94 - 2889.48] get down to it you guys
[2887.80 - 2892.84] here's how it works when a medication
[2889.48 - 2896.20] enters a person's body system the liver
[2892.84 - 2898.96] absorbs some of it every time we take a
[2896.20 - 2901.66] medication the liver absorbs some of it
[2898.96 - 2903.46] right here the liver I haven't seen this
[2901.66 - 2905.20] guy in a long time I think it's been
[2903.46 - 2908.02] like a couple of years before he's
[2905.20 - 2909.58] before I've had him out here on the
[2908.02 - 2913.06] stage
[2909.58 - 2914.62] okay your liver absorbs part of that
[2913.06 - 2917.04] medication every time you have a
[2914.62 - 2917.04] medication
[2917.80 - 2921.88] much of that medication enters the
[2919.72 - 2924.02] bloodstream directly
[2921.88 - 2926.44] bypassing the liver at first
[2924.02 - 2929.34] [Music]
[2926.44 - 2929.34] sound effects
[2929.50 - 2934.30] because some medications have an uncanny
[2932.08 - 2937.18] ability to absorb into your bloodstream
[2934.30 - 2940.42] through your mouth medications can
[2937.18 - 2941.56] absorb through the mouth in through the
[2940.42 - 2943.90] throat
[2941.56 - 2945.82] esophagus
[2943.90 - 2948.58] stomach
[2945.82 - 2950.98] duodenum
[2948.58 - 2953.38] when medications find their way as far
[2950.98 - 2955.12] as the small intestinal tract that's
[2953.38 - 2957.76] when they find their way into the lining
[2955.12 - 2960.04] of the track and eventually into the
[2957.76 - 2963.30] hepatic portal vein and where does that
[2960.04 - 2963.30] go up to your liver
[2963.82 - 2969.76] even medications that bypass the liver
[2966.28 - 2971.80] at first eventually find their way there
[2969.76 - 2974.44] through the bloodstream so even a
[2971.80 - 2976.66] medication that absorbs here boom
[2974.44 - 2979.78] absorbs through here here esophagus
[2976.66 - 2982.20] stomach duodenum still find their way to
[2979.78 - 2982.20] the liver
[2982.60 - 2987.82] when the liver absorbs the medications
[2984.94 - 2989.62] as part of its bloodstream cleanup the
[2987.82 - 2992.32] kidneys aren't the only part of the
[2989.62 - 2996.54] blood cleanup equation
[2992.32 - 2996.54] the liver is doing blood clean up
[2998.02 - 3002.16] Lynn aubers I feel like I have a
[3000.24 - 3004.68] fighting chance now yes best books ever
[3002.16 - 3008.40] I mean best books ever thank you Lynn
[3004.68 - 3011.12] thanks for agreeing
[3008.40 - 3011.12] thank you
[3011.40 - 3014.28] um
[3012.12 - 3015.96] no one you know what they try to throw
[3014.28 - 3018.72] at Medical medium I noticed that the
[3015.96 - 3020.64] influencers try to pull this stuff
[3018.72 - 3021.78] it's kidneys it's kidneys and kids it's
[3020.64 - 3023.64] kidneys he knows nothing about the
[3021.78 - 3026.52] kidneys it's like

[3035.82 - 3038.94] years and and not even knowing anything
[3037.44 - 3040.86] about the liver and how what the liver
[3038.94 - 3042.78] does and how to clean it up kidneys
[3040.86 - 3044.94] kidney kidneys am I going to be that
[3042.78 - 3046.26] fool that does that or am I going to
[3044.94 - 3048.06] listen to Spirit of fashion it's like
[3046.26 - 3050.04] liver liver or liver that's how you can
[3048.06 - 3051.48] save your kidneys if you don't take care
[3050.04 - 3053.28] of your liver you can't save your
[3051.48 - 3055.50] kidneys
[3053.28 - 3057.06] same thing with lymphatic system medical
[3055.50 - 3059.34] medium doesn't talk enough about
[3057.06 - 3061.74] lymphatic system lymphatic system that's
[3059.34 - 3063.96] what the influencers do it's like dude
[3061.74 - 3067.46] your lymphatic system is a Dumping

[3075.96 - 3080.34] liver and what the liver does because if
[3077.70 - 3082.74] you don't take care of your liver
[3080.34 - 3085.08] your lymphatic system is just going to
[3082.74 - 3087.24] be filled with all the time your
[3085.08 - 3089.94] lymphatic system is going to be drowning
[3087.24 - 3091.92] in garbage if you don't take care of
[3089.94 - 3094.02] your liver your lymphatic system is
[3091.92 - 3097.68] going to be drowning the medical medium
[3094.02 - 3100.02] cleanses and Protocols are pro-lymphatic
[3097.68 - 3102.42] system because it's taking care of the
[3100.02 - 3104.04] liver it automatically takes care of the
[3102.42 - 3105.72] lymphatic system but you'll find
[3104.04 - 3108.12] influencers goes he doesn't do anything
[3105.72 - 3109.38] about the lymphatics are you kidding me
[3108.12 - 3111.78] he used to know anything about the
[3109.38 - 3115.28] kidneys like what if you don't take care
[3111.78 - 3115.28] of your liver

[3123.06 - 3127.80] say lymphatic system or or kidney so
[3125.52 - 3130.50] they can sell you a product
[3127.80 - 3132.54] that's an affiliate product
[3130.50 - 3134.28] coming from another place in another
[3132.54 - 3135.90] place that convinces all these young
[3134.28 - 3138.84] influencers oh you've got to get your
[3135.90 - 3140.40] lymphatic systems what if you don't take
[3138.84 - 3142.14] care of your liver or understand your

[3142.14 - 3145.80] your lymphatic system I don't care how
[3143.76 - 3147.48] many lymphatic drainage massages you get
[3145.80 - 3149.58] you can't take care of your lymphatic
[3147.48 - 3153.44] system if you don't take care of your
[3149.58 - 3153.44] liver that's just the bottom line
[3153.48 - 3157.62] it is for your lymphatic system that's
[3155.70 - 3160.04] what all this is for they just don't
[3157.62 - 3160.04] know it
[3162.54 - 3168.90] anyway
[3164.52 - 3170.70] okay I had to get one rant in today
[3168.90 - 3173.54] so let's let's move on to the
[3170.70 - 3173.54] medications
[3173.94 - 3178.92] when the medication is out of your
[3175.92 - 3181.20] bloodstream it's living somewhere else
[3178.92 - 3182.88] such a stored deep inside the liver
[3181.20 - 3185.10] where the medication is then Time
[3182.88 - 3187.92] released back into the bloodstream for
[3185.10 - 3190.44] future years to come inevitably a
[3187.92 - 3194.22] stagnant sluggish liver with a storage
[3190.44 - 3196.50] bin of old Pharmaceuticals has to pop a
[3194.22 - 3198.48] cork every so often
[3196.50 - 3200.28] so if we don't take care of our liver it
[3198.48 - 3203.28] pops a cork and then our lymphatic
[3200.28 - 3206.10] system takes a hit
[3203.28 - 3208.98] releasing residues they find their way
[3206.10 - 3210.36] to the brain eventually if someone's not
[3208.98 - 3213.48] cleansing
[3210.36 - 3215.52] then all that Gunk is just going to the
[3213.48 - 3217.56] brain
[3215.52 - 3220.80] you can squeeze your lymphatic system
[3217.56 - 3223.92] all you want if you don't
[3220.80 - 3226.14] clean up the liver
[3223.92 - 3228.42] then you don't stand a chance of keeping
[3226.14 - 3231.02] your lymphatic system clean
[3228.42 - 3231.02] oops
[3231.24 - 3235.44] they still say this is for your
[3233.10 - 3238.56] lymphatic system so do do this product
[3235.44 - 3240.24] do this program you know it this is what
[3238.56 - 3242.64] it does in your body which they don't
[3240.24 - 3244.62] even know it's all a scam anyone can
[3242.64 - 3246.42] sense like scam scam scam everywhere
[3244.62 - 3247.92] it's for your lymphatic system this is
[3246.42 - 3249.12] for your kidneys here's a product for
[3247.92 - 3251.28] your kidneys here's your product for
[3249.12 - 3252.84] your lymphatic system
[3251.28 - 3255.80] but they don't even actually know what
[3252.84 - 3255.80] does what or what
[3258.08 - 3263.16] the liver is up against a lot when we
[3260.94 - 3265.56] don't know how to care for it so it
[3263.16 - 3269.10] can't hold on to every brain betrayer
[3265.56 - 3271.38] forever which is Pharmaceuticals example
[3269.10 - 3273.30] as the liver gets over saturated with
[3271.38 - 3275.70] various cocktails of medications you
[3273.30 - 3277.62] might have taken along the way or taken
[3275.70 - 3281.46] long term including over-the-counter
[3277.62 - 3284.22] medications it starts letting go of some
[3281.46 - 3287.78] of those medications liver starts to let
[3284.22 - 3287.78] go of some of those meds
[3292.56 - 3295.50] they circulate throughout the
[3293.94 - 3297.66] bloodstream again and again and they
[3295.50 - 3300.18] find their way back to the brain no
[3297.66 - 3302.76] longer just affecting The receptors the
[3300.18 - 3305.28] medications were originally intended for
[3302.76 - 3308.46] the longer the meditation the meditation
[3305.28 - 3310.86] is Fun the longer the meditation stay in
[3308.46 - 3315.18] the body the more
[3310.86 - 3317.46] efficacy the medications lose
[3315.18 - 3319.32] for their intended purpose so what
[3317.46 - 3320.94] happens is all the med just stay in our
[3319.32 - 3323.52] body and they don't even work anymore
[3320.94 - 3325.86] for their intended purpose now the
[3323.52 - 3327.66] pharmaceutical Brew can act as a toxic
[3325.86 - 3330.12] substance
[3327.66 - 3333.66] to the brain overall
[3330.12 - 3336.24] on IG Hillary thank you aw for helping
[3333.66 - 3340.58] me save money and not by trendy fad
[3336.24 - 3340.58] items that don't help the root problem
[3340.68 - 3346.98] and boy
[3342.90 - 3349.86] boy oh boy oh boy
[3346.98 - 3352.08] that's why I'm not like so much by so
[3349.86 - 3354.36] many people creating hit pieces is
[3352.08 - 3356.22] because if you tell the truth about an
[3354.36 - 3358.14] ionizer water machine or you tell the
[3356.22 - 3360.72] truth about
[3358.14 - 3362.04] whatever Pearl powder Shiloh G charcoal
[3360.72 - 3364.38] whatever you want us to call I mean
[3362.04 - 3366.30] people get angry as
[3364.38 - 3368.46] angry Infinite Wellness says my
[3366.30 - 3370.92] lymphatic system was drowning until I
[3368.46 - 3373.02] found you and healed
[3370.92 - 3375.48] foreign
[3373.02 - 3378.00] plus Pharmaceuticals contain toxic heavy
[3375.48 - 3381.00] metals Pharmaceuticals also contain
[3378.00 - 3383.16] caffeine these additives are part of how
[3381.00 - 3384.72] medications affect the brain so potently
[3383.16 - 3387.00] because there's Metals in
[3384.72 - 3388.74] Pharmaceuticals and caffeine in
[3387.00 - 3391.10] Pharmaceuticals and they get to your
[3388.74 - 3391.10] brain
[3391.88 - 3396.78] medications of any kind whether intended
[3394.62 - 3398.58] for the brain or elsewhere have the
[3396.78 - 3400.62] ability to get past the blood-brain
[3398.58 - 3403.26] barrier and enter every part of the
[3400.62 - 3405.84] brain because Pharmaceuticals are tissue
[3403.26 - 3408.54] soluble how's that word how do you
[3405.84 - 3411.54] pronounce that word soluble
[3408.54 - 3411.54] cellulable
[3412.20 - 3417.36] soluble
[3414.36 - 3419.28] I'm not a scholar I'm not an academic
[3417.36 - 3421.62] I'm a messenger that writes word for
[3419.28 - 3424.14] word from Spirit of compassion doesn't
[3421.62 - 3426.66] mean I'm the best reader
[3424.14 - 3430.80] there's no part of the brain that's
[3426.66 - 3432.66] immune or unexposed medication also gets
[3430.80 - 3435.54] stuck in the brain
[3432.66 - 3437.10] in which case it doesn't get time
[3435.54 - 3439.80] released
[3437.10 - 3441.24] it stays there indefinitely okay so what
[3439.80 - 3442.98] this is saying right here is what Spirit
[3441.24 - 3444.78] fashion was saying that these meds get
[3442.98 - 3446.94] stuck on our brain and they're not Time
[3444.78 - 3448.74] released in the brain out of the brain
[3446.94 - 3452.10] they're Time released out of the liver
[3448.74 - 3453.72] so liver will pop a cork and let some of
[3452.10 - 3456.36] that out all the time but the brain
[3453.72 - 3458.82] won't pop a cork and let the meds out
[3456.36 - 3462.68] they saturate the brain unless we work
[3458.82 - 3462.68] on getting them out with tools
[3464.58 - 3470.22] these toxins stay definitely raising
[3468.06 - 3472.08] toxicity levels within the brain tissue
[3470.22 - 3473.82] slowly denaturing brain cells and then
[3472.08 - 3476.22] never leaving the brain until someone
[3473.82 - 3478.32] learns how to actively and proactively
[3476.22 - 3482.60] work to clean it out of the brain tissue
[3478.32 - 3482.60] and that's why people can go mad
[3482.94 - 3486.14] just all that stuff just building up in
[3484.68 - 3489.56] their brain
[3486.14 - 3489.56] it's terrible
[3489.84 - 3494.64] for more information
[3492.00 - 3497.58] on how recreational drugs can affect our
[3494.64 - 3499.62] brain see chapter 11 micro dosing I had
[3497.58 - 3502.26] to read that little part
[3499.62 - 3504.96] some medications can be useful in crisis
[3502.26 - 3506.76] situations such as injuries or severe
[3504.96 - 3508.68] infections I love how they're trying to
[3506.76 - 3510.84] make micro dosing so hip and trendy it's
[3508.68 - 3512.16] unbelievable and it's I notice
[3510.84 - 3516.00] that
[3512.16 - 3519.00] it's like ridiculous too it's like
[3516.00 - 3520.80] it's like preying on kids now for real
[3519.00 - 3524.34] the micro dosing thing is preying on
[3520.80 - 3527.04] kids now because you got all these
[3524.34 - 3529.14] young people that have brain problems
[3527.04 - 3530.76] they got brain fatigue they got brain
[3529.14 - 3533.64] fog they got folks in concentration
[3530.76 - 3534.84] issues and then you tell these young
[3533.64 - 3537.36] people
[3534.84 - 3538.62] about microdosing psychedelics and
[3537.36 - 3540.96] everything else
[3538.62 - 3543.18] and you know it hits that science-minded
[3540.96 - 3545.46] thing like micro dosing it must be
[3543.18 - 3547.32] science proven there must be people who
[3545.46 - 3549.12] have done you know just right they know
[3547.32 - 3550.80] what's going on it's a micro dosing
[3549.12 - 3552.12] culture that's starting up is actually
[3550.80 - 3555.90] insane
[3552.12 - 3557.82] Colleen bloomhuff I'm soaking in water
[3555.90 - 3560.04] that's connected to the ionizer machine
[3557.82 - 3563.76] I thought it cleanses the lymph system
[3560.04 - 3565.62] and heavy metals out of the body Colleen
[3563.76 - 3567.60] you can do what you want and do what
[3565.62 - 3569.40] your doctor tells you but I'm going to
[3567.60 - 3570.78] tell you my
[3569.40 - 3573.48] my
[3570.78 - 3577.74] thoughts okay
[3573.48 - 3579.42] alkaline ionizer water machines are one
[3577.74 - 3581.52] of the greatest scams of all time
[3579.42 - 3583.32] there's a lot of great scams and that's
[3581.52 - 3587.24] one of them
[3583.32 - 3587.24] those metal plates corrode
[3588.30 - 3592.62] and in the past before medical meme
[3590.76 - 3594.12] information got everywhere like it's
[3592.62 - 3596.16] pretty much getting everywhere now where
[3594.12 - 3597.54] people are actually like on all this B12
[3596.16 - 3598.74] and they're doing all these things now
[3597.54 - 3600.54] and taking care of themselves all that's
[3598.74 - 3603.54] been Pro medical meaning for for decades
[3600.54 - 3606.12] right in the past when people were doing
[3603.54 - 3607.50] the ionizer water machines they went
[3606.12 - 3610.14] mental
[3607.50 - 3613.44] and got sicker
[3610.14 - 3616.38] because of the metal plates corroding
[3613.44 - 3618.48] is one of the greatest scams of all time
[3616.38 - 3620.40] one of them there's a bunch of them but
[3618.48 - 3623.00] that's definitely on the list
[3620.40 - 3623.00] it's terrible
[3624.30 - 3627.78] and then people doing those machines and
[3626.16 - 3629.76] then blaming medical medium for getting
[3627.78 - 3631.74] them sicker when they're drinking tons
[3629.76 - 3633.48] of that ionizer water that alkaline
[3631.74 - 3635.34] ionized water and they're going to get
[3633.48 - 3638.28] so sick
[3635.34 - 3640.50] their brains that's metal metal
[3638.28 - 3642.96] particles leaching out of those
[3640.50 - 3644.40] those plates with electric with
[3642.96 - 3647.46] electricity attached to those metal
[3644.40 - 3648.96] plates corroding them over time
[3647.46 - 3652.70] insane
[3648.96 - 3652.70] that tips to scale the wrong way
[3655.08 - 3657.98] it's exhausting
[3658.20 - 3662.16] been saying it for years some
[3660.06 - 3664.44] medications can be useful in crisis
[3662.16 - 3665.94] situations this is interesting
[3664.44 - 3667.62] I've done water shows in the past
[3665.94 - 3671.54] talking about this I'll do some things
[3667.62 - 3671.54] again when I can
[3673.14 - 3676.50] but right now we're in the 20-day
[3674.64 - 3679.88] medical meme brings out there big one
[3676.50 - 3679.88] challenge guess what it's free
[3681.06 - 3686.76] so how to get your stuff
[3684.48 - 3689.10] get the book free at the library
[3686.76 - 3691.74] some medications can be useful in crisis
[3689.10 - 3692.94] situations such as injuries or severe
[3691.74 - 3696.00] infections
[3692.94 - 3699.36] I'm not anti-medication
[3696.00 - 3701.88] I am not anti-medication
[3699.36 - 3704.24] for a lot of reasons some of it is
[3701.88 - 3704.24] useful
[3704.40 - 3708.90] there are times when they are truly
[3706.50 - 3711.12] necessary I say it here
[3708.90 - 3713.70] what we need to be aware of is how
[3711.12 - 3715.44] long-term use of pharmaceuticals end up
[3713.70 - 3717.30] saturating brain tissue and dampening
[3715.44 - 3719.70] the central nervous system's ability to
[3717.30 - 3721.26] perform and we're not fixing the
[3719.70 - 3723.90] original problem we have to work on
[3721.26 - 3725.70] fixing the original problem
[3723.90 - 3727.44] when we're not given answers from the
[3725.70 - 3729.30] medical industry about how to heal
[3727.44 - 3731.82] chronic illness
[3729.30 - 3734.52] are symptoms and conditions continue far
[3731.82 - 3737.28] too long and we may find ourselves on
[3734.52 - 3741.74] medications for extended periods and I'm
[3737.28 - 3741.74] not shaming blaming or judging anybody
[3743.70 - 3748.80] with the medications possibly making our
[3746.22 - 3751.50] conditions worse on top of it medical
[3748.80 - 3754.38] research and science don't even know
[3751.50 - 3755.58] what the cause of chronic illness is to
[3754.38 - 3758.10] begin with
[3755.58 - 3759.78] so they also don't realize they could be
[3758.10 - 3761.40] making the condition worse from the
[3759.78 - 3763.80] medication
[3761.40 - 3765.96] one thing to keep in mind
[3763.80 - 3767.70] is that sometimes multiple medications
[3765.96 - 3769.98] are prescribed by different doctors
[3767.70 - 3773.04] creating a stronger Brew than anyone
[3769.98 - 3774.66] intended that can alter or hinder
[3773.04 - 3777.18] your brain's ability to function
[3774.66 - 3780.06] optimally if you're actively relying on
[3777.18 - 3783.12] medication I respect that
[3780.06 - 3784.86] says it here I do you can still work on
[3783.12 - 3787.26] healing your brain and protecting it
[3784.86 - 3788.70] from the dozens of other brain betrayers
[3787.26 - 3791.00] here in part
[3788.70 - 3791.00] three
[3792.96 - 3796.40] boom diddly boom

[3878.04 - 3881.58] try doing that only around it's a bad
[3879.66 - 3883.92] idea because that's what I do
[3881.58 - 3887.66] don't do what I do
[3883.92 - 3887.66] because I do things that are Reckless
[3887.88 - 3894.72] I work 20 hours a day and get a few
[3892.14 - 3897.30] hours of sleep that is not wise it's

[4014.18 - 4018.20] Spears
[4015.74 - 4020.24] get it right
[4018.20 - 4022.34] whoa
[4020.24 - 4024.62] there's two nice ones there these are
[4022.34 - 4028.18] kind of like still small just letting
[4024.62 - 4028.18] you know these aren't the real big ones
[4028.52 - 4033.64] all right what's next half a stock
[4030.98 - 4037.48] celery
[4033.64 - 4037.48] oh hang on
[4039.50 - 4042.22] all right
[4043.34 - 4047.08] I'm stock celery
[4056.96 - 4060.46] let's get that in here
[4060.98 - 4067.06] I don't think that's funny at all
[4064.10 - 4067.06] half an apple
[4070.04 - 4076.60] foreign
[4072.22 - 4076.60] that's a really nice apple right there
[4077.72 - 4081.16] this is going to be so good
[4081.62 - 4086.60] I love the pharmaceutical
[4084.50 - 4088.04] exposure shot
[4086.60 - 4089.72] a friend of mine said why are you taking
[4088.04 - 4090.74] the pharmaceutical exposure shot like
[4089.72 - 4092.12] what's wrong with you are you on
[4090.74 - 4094.34] Pharmaceuticals
[4092.12 - 4097.52] no I'm not any I'm not on any
[4094.34 - 4100.16] Pharmaceuticals no not on any it's
[4097.52 - 4104.06] taking the shot I said I don't know did
[4100.16 - 4108.16] you read the book it's a lot of exposure
[4104.06 - 4108.16] there's so many Avenues of exposure
[4110.30 - 4113.92] popping some apple in here
[4115.52 - 4118.30] we go
[4120.80 - 4125.60] if you're new here and you don't know
[4122.66 - 4128.12] about the mm1500 or 900 it's 20 off
[4125.60 - 4130.16] right now but guess what
[4128.12 - 4131.78] that's not the special thing that's
[4130.16 - 4134.18] that's amazing
[4131.78 - 4136.64] the special thing is
[4134.18 - 4139.04] is the money saved
[4136.64 - 4140.90] not because of the 20 off the money
[4139.04 - 4143.24] saved because of the fact that squeezes
[4140.90 - 4145.34] so much juice out
[4143.24 - 4147.14] and I endorse these guys because of it
[4145.34 - 4149.60] because if it saves you money it saves
[4147.14 - 4150.86] you money I love how the pulp comes out
[4149.60 - 4152.36] like this
[4150.86 - 4156.38] right
[4152.36 - 4157.58] I saw a comment on YouTube
[4156.38 - 4160.52] um
[4157.58 - 4164.66] I think it was legit was it Roseanne was
[4160.52 - 4164.66] it Rosanna I can't remember but
[4165.20 - 4168.68] I think she was talking about how
[4167.12 - 4170.42] there's influencers out there pushing
[4168.68 - 4172.40] the spinning basket one
[4170.42 - 4175.76] yeah
[4172.40 - 4178.76] yeah totally the spinning basket one is
[4175.76 - 4181.40] takes a lot of produce and you lose a
[4178.76 - 4184.88] lot of produce and people aren't wealthy
[4181.40 - 4187.34] or Rich enough or have access to co-ops
[4184.88 - 4188.60] and access to infinite amounts of
[4187.34 - 4189.74] produce coming their way where they
[4188.60 - 4190.94] could just keep on pushing it through
[4189.74 - 4193.46] that machine
[4190.94 - 4196.04] people who are chronically sick don't
[4193.46 - 4198.26] have all that money to throw away so
[4196.04 - 4200.84] that's what I love about the mm 1500 900
[4198.26 - 4202.64] because it's squeezing more juice out of
[4200.84 - 4204.26] it that's the whole point and it's
[4202.64 - 4205.58] preserving the nutrients because it's a
[4204.26 - 4207.56] cold pressed masticating machine because
[4205.58 - 4209.06] when you're sick you need that when
[4207.56 - 4211.28] you're chronically sick you need a
[4209.06 - 4212.66] medicine maker not a you know a
[4211.28 - 4214.52] flamboyant
[4212.66 - 4216.86] spend a ton of money on produce every
[4214.52 - 4219.44] minute kind of machine
[4216.86 - 4221.90] Carrie Pearson says the mm Omega juicers
[4219.44 - 4223.94] are the best save so much money and
[4221.90 - 4225.50] you're saving money not just not just
[4223.94 - 4226.28] because the discount right you're saving
[4225.50 - 4228.44] money
[4226.28 - 4231.20] because of the produce you're buying
[4228.44 - 4233.30] less produce oh my God
[4231.20 - 4234.14] matters
[4233.30 - 4236.86] yeah
[4234.14 - 4236.86] all right
[4237.62 - 4243.88] guess what
[4240.20 - 4243.88] I got a shot glass right here
[4244.34 - 4249.06] fantastic
[4247.10 - 4258.14] I did something right
[4249.06 - 4261.20] [Music]
[4258.14 - 4263.84] see you later Pharmaceuticals
[4261.20 - 4268.52] bye bye
[4263.84 - 4270.29] any recent exposure I may have had
[4268.52 - 4275.48] I'm kissing you goodbye
[4270.29 - 4278.26] [Music]
[4275.48 - 4278.26] so good
[4281.18 - 4286.10] it's incredible is you can sense how it
[4283.82 - 4287.78] it actually can work
[4286.10 - 4289.76] because I don't get experiences like
[4287.78 - 4290.44] that when I just drink the juice the
[4289.76 - 4292.10] green juice
[4290.44 - 4295.34] [Music]
[4292.10 - 4297.88] because it's about what it is the
[4295.34 - 4300.44] phytochemical compounds working together
[4297.88 - 4303.02] we create so much
[4300.44 - 4307.34] destruction and Death on this planet
[4303.02 - 4309.92] Earth so much toxic waste
[4307.34 - 4313.40] you have to have a balance somewhere
[4309.92 - 4315.92] there has to be something that exists on
[4313.40 - 4317.78] this planet that you can grow from your
[4315.92 - 4321.64] food that can
[4317.78 - 4321.64] Levy against it
[4324.98 - 4328.58] and that's what I love that's where the
[4326.48 - 4331.64] compassions wisdom
[4328.58 - 4334.72] and knowledge about what we can use to
[4331.64 - 4334.72] battle what we need to battle
[4336.62 - 4341.32] bartender
[4338.48 - 4341.32] give me another
[4341.96 - 4346.90] bartender I'm not mad or anything I just
[4344.48 - 4346.90] want another
[4347.54 - 4354.62] Carson says I took ADHD meds
[4352.40 - 4356.42] since I was a child I had terrible side
[4354.62 - 4358.22] effects and symptoms when I finally got
[4356.42 - 4360.20] off of them I tried everything to heal
[4358.22 - 4361.58] but the only thing that worked was the
[4360.20 - 4363.92] medical medium information
[4361.58 - 4365.60] eternally grateful
[4363.92 - 4368.56] God love you
[4365.60 - 4368.56] God bless you
[4370.88 - 4376.06] that means more to me anybody knows
[4378.62 - 4381.88] that's the whole point
[4382.10 - 4386.52] truly making a difference in people's
[4383.84 - 4388.94] lives because no one understands
[4386.52 - 4392.00] [Music]
[4388.94 - 4396.04] no one understands what it's like
[4392.00 - 4396.04] they don't understand what it's like
[4397.46 - 4401.98] to be struggling and and have no answers
[4403.10 - 4406.82] um
[4404.06 - 4409.10] someone wants to tell you that they are
[4406.82 - 4411.98] happy you're off the ADHD medications
[4409.10 - 4413.30] and you found medical medium too
[4411.98 - 4415.64] um

[4426.50 - 4429.62] of
[4427.76 - 4432.44] of you for getting off this meds and
[4429.62 - 4436.06] finding medical medium information

[4440.48 - 4447.38] she's indisposed in the moment

[4503.14 - 4511.58] psychiatrist and a surgeon
[4506.84 - 4512.54] Dr Nesbitt says that he will gladly
[4511.58 - 4517.76] um

[4562.10 - 4567.86] yep in Greece is nothing better than
[4565.58 - 4570.14] chickens he's hoping he's got a question
[4567.86 - 4571.46] to ask you guys is it a question or a
[4570.14 - 4573.62] demand
[4571.46 - 4576.98] he's insisting on something he says that
[4573.62 - 4580.40] can you please not eat chickens or
[4576.98 - 4582.80] chicken or chicken fingers he says try
[4580.40 - 4585.44] not to eat chicken fingers or chicken
[4582.80 - 4587.36] breasts Dr Nesbitt don't get too excited
[4585.44 - 4588.74] about this they're not gonna stop if
[4587.36 - 4590.36] they like chicken they're probably gonna
[4588.74 - 4592.94] still eat chicken and I can't tell them
[4590.36 - 4594.80] different so just just calm down
[4592.94 - 4596.06] he says he's been wanting to say this
[4594.80 - 4599.48] for a long time but he's hoping
[4596.06 - 4601.10] everybody stops eating chicken
[4599.48 - 4604.96] um
[4601.10 - 4604.96] what about Peggy and Donnie the Donkey

[4610.82 - 4618.80] piggy sake uh Dr Nesbitt asks if you
[4613.82 - 4620.96] stop eating pig and ham and bacon
[4618.80 - 4624.02] Dr Nesbitt people are going to do what
[4620.96 - 4627.16] they want to do and uh that's just it we
[4624.02 - 4627.16] have a message for the vegans
[4627.20 - 4631.76] yeah he says the vegans
[4630.38 - 4634.04] um they're eating too much vegan cheese
[4631.76 - 4636.44] out there
[4634.04 - 4639.68] he says the vegan cheese he says that he
[4636.44 - 4641.66] was doing a surgical operation on a
[4639.68 - 4642.92] human and he found a hunk of vegan
[4641.66 - 4645.38] cheese
[4642.92 - 4647.06] uh inside
[4645.38 - 4648.74] their abdomen
[4647.06 - 4650.90] what
[4648.74 - 4653.06] says yes he pulled a piece of vegan
[4650.90 - 4656.00] cheese out of somebody's abdomen
[4653.06 - 4658.12] and he said that one of the nurses ate
[4656.00 - 4658.12] it
[4658.34 - 4662.18] Dr Nesbit that's that's like a terrible
[4661.04 - 4665.54] joke
[4662.18 - 4667.04] he says no it was a perfect piece of
[4665.54 - 4669.14] vegan cheese
[4667.04 - 4672.38] it was still wrapped in plastic from the
[4669.14 - 4674.18] store they swallowed the vegan cheese
[4672.38 - 4675.44] with the plastic on it so the nurse said
[4674.18 - 4676.94] there was nothing wrong with it and it
[4675.44 - 4680.42] shouldn't go to waste and she ate the
[4676.94 - 4683.72] vegan cheese in darkness we gotta go
[4680.42 - 4686.00] Dr Nesbitt says that

[4818.02 - 4821.96] and that they want to do a consultation
