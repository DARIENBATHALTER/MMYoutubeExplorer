[150.64 - 154.96] right bladder issues that are
[152.68 - 156.40] unexplainable that just get a diagnosis
[154.96 - 158.00] that really doesn't help
[156.40 - 160.32] all these things people have gone
[158.00 - 162.64] through along with like chronic
[160.32 - 165.76] sinusitis and all kinds of other stuff
[162.64 - 167.60] and good to see you guys and so i was
[165.76 - 169.52] known as this bizarre symptoms guy and
[167.60 - 172.40] one of the tools
[169.52 - 172.72] powerful tools for spirit of compassion
[172.40 - 176.56] was
[172.72 - 179.92] juicing a minimum of 16 ounces of celery
[176.56 - 180.96] right on an empty stomach on an empty
[179.92 - 184.64] stomach
[180.96 - 188.16] okay and you know once a day
[184.64 - 192.16] and that was we're talking game
[188.16 - 195.60] changer man game changer
[192.16 - 197.92] like a whole another level
[195.60 - 199.92] and so look if you're not juicing celery
[197.92 - 201.68] if you haven't tried it that's okay
[199.92 - 203.28] right that's all right i haven't had
[201.68 - 204.64] celery juice today so i figured i'd get
[203.28 - 207.36] the juicer out
[204.64 - 209.12] and run some celery through it because i
[207.36 - 211.52] haven't had any

[268.16 - 273.76] moved the needle for me

[293.36 - 298.32] batches you guys i want to give you
[295.20 - 301.28] all the tidbits okay some batches
[298.32 - 303.20] are astringent right they're more
[301.28 - 305.20] spindly and green
[303.20 - 306.40] check this out have you seen this kind
[305.20 - 308.96] of batch
[306.40 - 309.60] this is what i call like the paper thin
[308.96 - 312.08] batch
[309.60 - 313.20] the stocks look big right the stocks
[312.08 - 316.40] look big
[313.20 - 318.96] but guess what it's a trick they're not
[316.40 - 321.12] they're paper thin and they're kind of
[318.96 - 322.24] like strange in a way like when i get
[321.12 - 324.00] this kind
[322.24 - 325.76] and i know i've known this kind for so
[324.00 - 329.04] many years it's like a
[325.76 - 329.52] paper thin stalk you see that kind right
[329.04 - 332.32] there
[329.52 - 333.84] and interesting and it's it's okay it
[332.32 - 335.68] tastes alright right it's not my
[333.84 - 338.56] favorite one
[335.68 - 340.56] and sometimes you'll get in in this this
[338.56 - 343.12] batch of celery i have now
[340.56 - 344.00] right this batch of celery i have now
[343.12 - 346.48] it's got this
[344.00 - 347.04] thick cord in the center you know and
[346.48 - 349.68] you can
[347.04 - 351.68] chop that up and use it so let me take
[349.68 - 352.00] this knife right here right it's got the
[351.68 - 354.72] thick
[352.00 - 355.52] cord so you can you can cut that in half
[354.72 - 357.12] right
[355.52 - 358.80] and you can put it through the juicer
[357.12 - 359.52] like that too so that's something you
[358.80 - 361.28] can do
[359.52 - 362.56] so that's that's one kind right there
[361.28 - 365.68] that i'm talking about
[362.56 - 368.72] um okay yatro mckay
[365.68 - 369.04] i can't tolerate even a small amount i
[368.72 - 371.84] get
[369.04 - 373.52] full on diarrhea wondering what to do
[371.84 - 375.52] one teaspoon
[373.52 - 377.52] help would be appreciated first of all
[375.52 - 379.92] you might be straining it
[377.52 - 380.80] right meaning you might be straining it
[379.92 - 382.80] or you might
[380.80 - 384.24] not be straining it which one is because
[382.80 - 386.24] you have to strain it
[384.24 - 387.68] it's one thing that's important you guys
[386.24 - 389.36] you can juice your celery
[387.68 - 390.80] but you still have to strain it through
[389.36 - 394.24] a fine mesh strainer
[390.80 - 396.80] right so that's one thing
[394.24 - 397.36] because the little the little the little
[396.80 - 400.48] tiny
[397.36 - 402.64] the pulp left over can be a
[400.48 - 403.52] like sometimes promote that kind of
[402.64 - 406.24] peristaltic
[403.52 - 406.80] action it's one thing the other thing is
[406.24 - 408.40] if
[406.80 - 410.00] cell like for okay here's the other
[408.40 - 412.64] thing be your own detective
[410.00 - 413.92] so that means there's nothing else
[412.64 - 415.60] that's giving you diarrhea
[413.92 - 417.12] like you have never never had diarrhea
[415.60 - 420.56] before
[417.12 - 421.52] just a question right so i ask everybody
[420.56 - 424.56] that okay
[421.52 - 425.84] if celery juice gives you diarrhea just
[424.56 - 428.08] a little bit of it
[425.84 - 429.92] is your stomach upset on a normal basis
[428.08 - 430.72] so everything's perfect your stomach's
[429.92 - 432.00] fine
[430.72 - 434.64] nothing's ever happened with your
[432.00 - 435.84] stomach like nothing goes wrong with it
[434.64 - 438.00] you don't have bloating you know
[435.84 - 438.88] cramping diarrhea no stomach digestive
[438.00 - 441.44] issues whatsoever
[438.88 - 443.04] everything's completely perfect until
[441.44 - 445.44] you have a little celery juice
[443.04 - 447.12] and then diarrhea comes or did you have
[445.44 - 448.80] diarrhea last week
[447.12 - 450.72] um did you have diarrhea three days ago
[448.80 - 452.16] did you have diarrhea two months ago a
[450.72 - 453.84] week ago two weeks ago
[452.16 - 455.44] or do you have a little bit of it on and
[453.84 - 457.44] off every other day
[455.44 - 459.28] and it's hit or miss it's like whoa got
[457.44 - 461.20] the runs now i don't know what i ate
[459.28 - 463.04] i got the runs now something's irritated
[461.20 - 463.44] oh i've been to the doctor i got ibs
[463.04 - 464.96] like
[463.44 - 466.80] so be your own detective that's one
[464.96 - 468.80] thing there so
[466.80 - 470.16] then you can distinguish how you know
[468.80 - 472.88] you got the tummy
[470.16 - 473.52] the tummy stuff going on right you know
[472.88 - 475.28] or
[473.52 - 476.96] is everything perfect and you drink a
[475.28 - 478.64] little celery juice because if
[476.96 - 480.56] everything's perfect
[478.64 - 482.48] and you drink a little celery juice
[480.56 - 484.40] right that celery juice
[482.48 - 485.60] is doing some cleansing so it's killing
[484.40 - 487.76] off some bugs
[485.60 - 489.36] if everything's not perfect and you have
[487.76 - 492.56] stomach problems anyway
[489.36 - 495.36] and stomach issues anyway it's killing
[492.56 - 496.72] off some bugs too right so we'll go into
[495.36 - 498.96] that a little bit here's a close here's
[496.72 - 502.40] a sodium cluster salt right here
[498.96 - 503.92] it's an orange it's an orange eva lopez
[502.40 - 504.96] i've been drinking celery juice for the
[503.92 - 508.08] last four months
[504.96 - 510.08] every morning went
[508.08 - 511.44] went and had a wellness check it came
[510.08 - 514.00] back with no issues
[511.44 - 514.96] my doctor was amazed because i'm 49
[514.00 - 517.52] years old
[514.96 - 519.12] and i'm not on any pharmaceutical the
[517.52 - 522.56] doctor said keep drinking
[519.12 - 524.88] that celery juice amazing and you know
[522.56 - 525.68] look you guys got to look out to you for
[524.88 - 528.64] triggers i
[525.68 - 530.24] call them new medical treatments you
[528.64 - 532.96] gotta always question them
[530.24 - 534.80] look out for triggers be careful because
[532.96 - 536.96] you could have some good health and then
[534.80 - 538.08] a new medical treatment could set some
[536.96 - 539.84] people back
[538.08 - 541.52] if they're not checking into stuff you
[539.84 - 542.32] know what i mean kind of give you kind
[541.52 - 545.44] of heads up
[542.32 - 547.04] and then not only that um
[545.44 - 548.72] other triggers like are you going to
[547.04 - 549.44] your doctor and getting blood tests
[548.72 - 551.68] regularly
[549.44 - 554.24] and are they drawing a lot of blood they
[551.68 - 556.32] drawing 70 milliliters 50 milliliters
[554.24 - 557.76] 100 milliliters 140 milliliters 200 ml
[556.32 - 559.60] are they taking blood because then you
[557.76 - 561.84] lose your immune system and eventually
[559.60 - 563.04] you go backwards that way too keep in
[561.84 - 563.84] mind that there's always a couple of
[563.04 - 565.28] triggers
[563.84 - 567.44] that we have to keep you know always
[565.28 - 569.60] look out for because yeah
[567.44 - 571.52] the celery juice can help us help us
[569.60 - 573.52] help us and then we do things
[571.52 - 574.56] then knock us down knock us down knock
[573.52 - 577.20] us down
[574.56 - 578.88] right that's how it works you're going
[577.20 - 580.72] up you're going up with your celery
[578.88 - 582.72] i'm getting better whoa moving the
[580.72 - 584.24] needle moving the needle this is great
[582.72 - 585.92] moving the needle this is amazing i'm
[584.24 - 587.84] going to put these celery sticks in here
[585.92 - 589.36] moving the needle drinking my celery
[587.84 - 591.28] juice getting better
[589.36 - 592.72] and what just had a whole bunch of blood
[591.28 - 593.92] taken for me just had a whole bunch of
[592.72 - 596.08] blood taken from me
[593.92 - 597.52] said going backwards don't know why
[596.08 - 600.48] maybe it's the celery just no
[597.52 - 602.16] it's the blood taken out right or you're
[600.48 - 603.52] moving forward you're moving up
[602.16 - 605.04] you're drinking your celery juice you're
[603.52 - 606.08] moving the needle you're moving the
[605.04 - 608.88] needle
[606.08 - 610.24] and then boom new medical treatment that
[608.88 - 612.00] was offered or something
[610.24 - 614.16] something you didn't do enough research
[612.00 - 617.68] on something you know that
[614.16 - 620.64] maybe you got peer pressured into
[617.68 - 621.76] right something you might have been peer
[620.64 - 625.04] pressured into
[621.76 - 627.04] right and boom back going back
[625.04 - 628.64] going back going back going back you
[627.04 - 630.48] know and
[628.64 - 633.12] so i mean keep that in mind too i forgot

[661.60 - 666.00] i don't know what i'm saying if anything
[665.04 - 669.68] can go wrong
[666.00 - 672.64] it will right um
[669.68 - 672.96] i'll go look for another syringe but so
[672.64 - 675.60] we
[672.96 - 676.08] we do these things that we don't realize
[675.60 - 679.12] right
[676.08 - 679.76] that could set us back when we move the
[679.12 - 681.36] needle
[679.76 - 682.96] and we're moving the needle forward and
[681.36 - 686.16] then there's this war
[682.96 - 689.84] right this war that's happening
[686.16 - 692.88] this war of you're doing something good
[689.84 - 694.88] and then you're getting hit backwards
[692.88 - 696.96] with something that you don't know might
[694.88 - 698.48] not be so good like i always tell
[696.96 - 701.04] people yeah i want people to go to their
[698.48 - 702.08] doctor absolutely okay i talk to doctors
[701.04 - 704.16] all the time
[702.08 - 706.24] and i want people to see their doctors i
[704.16 - 710.08] want people to get blood tested
[706.24 - 712.32] i want people to take advice
[710.08 - 714.48] recommendations prescriptions from their
[712.32 - 716.72] doctors right
[714.48 - 718.16] but at the same time doctors are in this
[716.72 - 719.76] playing field where they don't know
[718.16 - 721.20] what's wrong with people right they
[719.76 - 721.60] don't know what causes chronic illness a
[721.20 - 723.28] doctor
[721.60 - 725.20] doesn't know what causes fibromyalgia
[723.28 - 727.04] doesn't know what causes ra
[725.20 - 728.00] they don't know what causes lyme disease
[727.04 - 729.12] because they were wrong about the
[728.00 - 731.52] bacteria
[729.12 - 733.68] so when when they don't know what's
[731.52 - 735.60] going on with people but they also
[733.68 - 736.80] here's how it works with big pharma and
[735.60 - 737.92] doctors i'm going to give you this
[736.80 - 739.68] little tidbit right here and this is
[737.92 - 742.88] really important to know right
[739.68 - 744.40] is big pharma puts pressure on doctors
[742.88 - 746.08] because i talk to doctors all the time
[744.40 - 748.48] been talking to doctors forever about
[746.08 - 752.24] this stuff right and big pharma
[748.48 - 754.56] they put pressure on doctors
[752.24 - 755.84] pushing out the pharmaceuticals that big
[754.56 - 758.24] pharma wants
[755.84 - 760.08] see and you guys don't know that you
[758.24 - 762.08] guys go make an appointment to doctor
[760.08 - 763.76] doctors there and but well you don't
[762.08 - 764.56] know that the doctors all had to have a
[763.76 - 768.40] meeting
[764.56 - 770.72] with the uh with the uh big pharma
[768.40 - 773.12] dealer right the dealer that comes to
[770.72 - 775.52] the clinics the dealer that comes to
[773.12 - 776.64] they come to the they fly around they
[775.52 - 779.36] get off the plane
[776.64 - 780.40] they got their black bag they go into
[779.36 - 782.16] the clinic
[780.40 - 783.68] they go and they're in the clinic now
[782.16 - 785.52] right
[783.68 - 787.36] and all the doctors get around for a
[785.52 - 789.20] minute and they they take out the black
[787.36 - 791.36] black bag and they go we got this new
[789.20 - 793.44] anti-anxiety medication right here yep
[791.36 - 795.36] right we got that one we got this is big
[793.44 - 795.92] pharma this is somebody working for big
[795.36 - 798.72] pharma
[795.92 - 800.40] we got this new treatment here you guys
[798.72 - 802.16] want here's the pamphlet
[800.40 - 804.24] the doctors know nothing about the
[802.16 - 804.88] treatment they know nothing about the
[804.24 - 806.48] drug
[804.88 - 808.32] they know nothing about anything they
[806.48 - 810.64] can hand it a pamphlet
[808.32 - 811.36] the doctor doesn't know any history
[810.64 - 813.20] behind it
[811.36 - 814.72] doesn't know what happened really in the
[813.20 - 816.80] studies on the drug
[814.72 - 817.92] doesn't know anything big pharma comes
[816.80 - 820.24] with their bag
[817.92 - 820.96] their bag of goodies they come to the
[820.24 - 822.32] doctor
[820.96 - 823.92] the chick this is really important
[822.32 - 825.44] information i actually never told you
[823.92 - 826.88] guys this i don't think maybe i did
[825.44 - 829.52] years ago
[826.88 - 830.72] they go to the doctor's office right and
[829.52 - 834.24] then they sell
[830.72 - 836.32] their bag of goods that's how it's done
[834.24 - 837.52] so your doctor sits there and or group a
[836.32 - 838.72] doctor sits there and he's sitting here
[837.52 - 839.52] like this and he's like okay what else
[838.72 - 842.88] you got
[839.52 - 845.12] like well we got we got uh this we got
[842.88 - 846.40] this new drug coming out for anxiety
[845.12 - 848.24] this is for women that are
[846.40 - 849.76] suffering from anxiety it's a new
[848.24 - 853.52] variety of anti
[849.76 - 856.80] okay what else you got we got this here
[853.52 - 858.88] this other drug here for inflammation
[856.80 - 860.80] you can put it in a needle put in
[858.88 - 862.88] syringe and inject it if you need to
[860.80 - 864.96] into them here's another drug we have
[862.88 - 865.84] here here's a new painkiller we have
[864.96 - 868.40] right
[865.84 - 869.92] and but the doctors don't know anything
[868.40 - 872.96] about if these drugs work or not because
[869.92 - 875.60] the doctors are the experiment
[872.96 - 876.80] part of the experiment okay they're part
[875.60 - 878.40] of the experiment
[876.80 - 880.16] the doctor's like well i got all these
[878.40 - 881.76] patients walking through the door
[880.16 - 883.52] and all these patients are hurting with
[881.76 - 886.80] something um
[883.52 - 888.64] the drug dealer came here
[886.80 - 890.32] and with his bag of tricks his bag of
[888.64 - 892.64] goods he told me
[890.32 - 894.32] that try this new drug for this woman's
[892.64 - 896.16] depression
[894.32 - 897.52] try this new anti-anxiety for this
[896.16 - 899.52] woman's depression
[897.52 - 902.16] try this new prostate medication for
[899.52 - 905.20] this for this man's prostate problem
[902.16 - 906.96] try this new whatever right so they have
[905.20 - 908.32] and then they just they're just part of
[906.96 - 911.44] the experiment
[908.32 - 913.20] see how it works so now you come in well
[911.44 - 916.32] i got an appointment of doctors
[913.20 - 918.40] met the doctor said uh time anthony
[916.32 - 919.92] time to time to come okay let me get up
[918.40 - 921.28] let me go see the doctor right i guess
[919.92 - 922.88] i'll go in there right
[921.28 - 924.32] and you go in there and the doctor looks
[922.88 - 925.60] at your you know whatever looks at your
[924.32 - 928.40] tests or
[925.60 - 928.72] makes his conclusions and says okay well
[928.40 - 930.64] and
[928.72 - 932.16] he goes and he goes well let me give you
[930.64 - 936.48] a prescription for this drug
[932.16 - 939.52] he was only told just recently
[936.48 - 941.60] by a representative of a big pharma to
[939.52 - 942.48] try these drugs so now you become the
[941.60 - 944.48] experiment
[942.48 - 946.08] you're the experiment now right doesn't
[944.48 - 947.44] this make celery juice so much nicer
[946.08 - 950.24] when i think about it
[947.44 - 951.20] does this make celery juice like what
[950.24 - 953.44] you know
[951.20 - 954.56] you can take celery juice and work on
[953.44 - 956.32] getting better
[954.56 - 957.84] millions are healing around the world i
[956.32 - 959.52] mean doesn't this other process sound
[957.84 - 962.08] horrifying in a way
[959.52 - 963.68] so we become an experiment to every
[962.08 - 965.84] single drug that comes out
[963.68 - 966.96] so every single drug the big pharma
[965.84 - 969.60] peddles
[966.96 - 970.00] that had they have their drug dealers
[969.60 - 972.56] right
[970.00 - 973.84] bring their black bag to all the clinics
[972.56 - 975.52] if you just got on here i'm talking
[973.84 - 976.88] about big pharma's drug dealers they go
[975.52 - 978.32] to all the clinics and all the doctors
[976.88 - 979.12] in all the hospitals and all doctors
[978.32 - 980.56] offices
[979.12 - 982.08] and they take their black bag out and
[980.56 - 983.44] they show the doctors the new drugs
[982.08 - 984.56] coming out and then you become the
[983.44 - 986.24] experiment
[984.56 - 987.60] and if that drug's been out already for
[986.24 - 989.04] two months you're now part of the
[987.60 - 990.16] experiment for two months if the drug's
[989.04 - 991.60] been out for two years probably
[990.16 - 993.60] experiment for two years
[991.60 - 994.72] christine k did the doctors make money
[993.60 - 996.88] off each prescription
[994.72 - 998.80] yes i talked to one doctor and every
[996.88 - 1001.36] single prescription that the doctor
[998.80 - 1004.80] prescribes he gets five dollars
[1001.36 - 1007.84] um off that prescription
[1004.80 - 1008.40] for a lifetime like a stipend kind of
[1007.84 - 1009.76] thing
[1008.40 - 1011.84] now i don't know of all doctors they
[1009.76 - 1013.28] don't know all around the world
[1011.84 - 1014.64] i talked to a lot of doctors i talked to
[1013.28 - 1015.60] one doctor and he says he gets five
[1014.64 - 1020.56] dollars
[1015.60 - 1023.12] for every single bottle or prescription
[1020.56 - 1024.32] that's sold so that means that then this
[1023.12 - 1026.00] doctor told me it's going to give him a
[1024.32 - 1027.20] lifetime of playing golf right
[1026.00 - 1028.96] so you're going to be able to play golf
[1027.20 - 1030.32] not every doctor is signed on to this
[1028.96 - 1032.16] program i don't think i don't know how
[1030.32 - 1033.76] it works really i mean i should find out
[1032.16 - 1035.68] bet more about it but he told me that
[1033.76 - 1037.68] it's like okay well
[1035.68 - 1039.28] so now you know that means he said when
[1037.68 - 1041.20] he retires
[1039.28 - 1043.12] if people are still using those
[1041.20 - 1044.40] prescriptions because they're sick for
[1043.12 - 1045.68] their whole lifetime and he's still
[1044.40 - 1047.20] getting five dollars for every bottle
[1045.68 - 1048.64] that's filled right
[1047.20 - 1050.16] but that was him i don't know if it's
[1048.64 - 1051.84] like that for but he said don't don't
[1050.16 - 1053.84] don't quote me on that for everybody
[1051.84 - 1055.36] every doctor every country
[1053.84 - 1057.76] this country that country don't quote me
[1055.36 - 1060.08] on that but i did hear that um
[1057.76 - 1061.68] and i'm gonna look into it more too but
[1060.08 - 1063.04] the bottom line is
[1061.68 - 1066.16] the bottom line is we become an
[1063.04 - 1067.84] experiment right so the drug dealer from
[1066.16 - 1070.72] big pharma ashley kevin i saw
[1067.84 - 1072.56] the drug dealer from big pharma comes to
[1070.72 - 1074.88] the doctor's office
[1072.56 - 1076.24] shows him what he's got whether it's
[1074.88 - 1078.08] five years ago four years ago three
[1076.24 - 1080.32] years ago today tomorrow
[1078.08 - 1082.08] and then everybody's now an experiment
[1080.32 - 1084.96] on that drug right
[1082.08 - 1087.12] so everybody your experiment right so
[1084.96 - 1089.92] with that in mind
[1087.12 - 1092.24] right there could be some new medical
[1089.92 - 1096.64] treatments that are really really
[1092.24 - 1098.96] peer pressure peer pressure
[1096.64 - 1098.96] you know
[1099.35 - 1103.28] [Music]
[1100.72 - 1105.68] right under pressure people go like
[1103.28 - 1110.16] under pressure
[1105.68 - 1111.60] and to actually partake
[1110.16 - 1112.96] and so here you are moving forward
[1111.60 - 1114.24] moving forward moving forward moving
[1112.96 - 1115.12] forward moving forward moving forward
[1114.24 - 1116.72] moving forward
[1115.12 - 1118.72] you're healing you're healing you're
[1116.72 - 1121.76] healing what
[1118.72 - 1122.00] going back so that's you know and then
[1121.76 - 1124.08] there's
[1122.00 - 1125.84] so many different there's so many
[1124.08 - 1127.76] different potholes and
[1125.84 - 1129.60] and trouble spots out there and
[1127.76 - 1132.88] everything else that could happen
[1129.60 - 1136.00] um so i just want you to know
[1132.88 - 1139.44] that we have to we have to be
[1136.00 - 1141.76] also our own caretakers right
[1139.44 - 1143.04] we gotta be we gotta just we gotta know
[1141.76 - 1145.28] discernment

[1145.28 - 1148.24] people out there say i don't know about
[1147.04 - 1150.96] celery juice
[1148.24 - 1151.44] i don't know about it i don't trust it i
[1150.96 - 1154.72] don't
[1151.44 - 1156.80] know i heard it's okay um i'd rather
[1154.72 - 1158.80] keep on taking all my drugs

[1185.76 - 1190.08] i just so the bottom line is you guys is
[1188.16 - 1193.12] when we're healing
[1190.08 - 1196.08] there's there's ways we can go backwards
[1193.12 - 1197.04] and we have to be careful we have to
[1196.08 - 1199.28] look out right
[1197.04 - 1201.20] the blood draw is one of them that's one
[1199.28 - 1204.32] right there all on its own
[1201.20 - 1206.32] um there's a lot of reasons
[1204.32 - 1207.52] that we have to be careful not just one
[1206.32 - 1208.72] right there
[1207.52 - 1211.28] i'm not talking about getting your
[1208.72 - 1212.64] carpets cleaned right there that can
[1211.28 - 1213.60] set somebody back can't tell you how
[1212.64 - 1215.92] many people they get their carpets
[1213.60 - 1218.24] cleaned by toxic chemicals boom
[1215.92 - 1219.04] uh household cleaners that aren't
[1218.24 - 1222.32] natural
[1219.04 - 1224.56] boom right msg and natural flavors uh
[1222.32 - 1225.92] bug bites bug bites can set people back
[1224.56 - 1229.04] i've seen bug bites set
[1225.92 - 1231.36] people back right so you know they're
[1229.04 - 1232.08] it's swimming in the ocean as beautiful
[1231.36 - 1234.96] as it seems did
[1232.08 - 1237.04] everything cold white spring um hearing
[1234.96 - 1238.00] about odd reactions from people living
[1237.04 - 1240.24] with those that
[1238.00 - 1242.96] had certain things going on huh out
[1240.24 - 1245.20] there so yeah i mean the bottom line is
[1242.96 - 1246.56] you know it's it's there's a lot of
[1245.20 - 1249.68] things happening
[1246.56 - 1250.96] that we get stuck in right so we get a
[1249.68 - 1252.56] lot of radiation
[1250.96 - 1254.16] you go through the airport that's a big
[1252.56 - 1257.60] one i can't even tell you right
[1254.16 - 1260.64] like i tell family and friends like
[1257.60 - 1262.32] hey be careful in the airport you know
[1260.64 - 1265.20] be careful opt
[1262.32 - 1266.80] out for certain things and stuff because
[1265.20 - 1268.96] you go into the airport
[1266.80 - 1270.76] and the radiation you can get whacked
[1268.96 - 1273.52] with when you're traveling is
[1270.76 - 1273.92] unbelievable right and then your luggage
[1273.52 - 1275.12] too
[1273.92 - 1276.88] i tell people you gotta throw out your
[1275.12 - 1278.48] luggage every now and then you got to
[1276.88 - 1280.96] throw your luggage out
[1278.48 - 1282.16] keep that in mind you know it's it's
[1280.96 - 1286.32] like because
[1282.16 - 1287.52] the luggage is a radiation collector
[1286.32 - 1288.72] right when you go through the airport
[1287.52 - 1290.72] you got a knapsack
[1288.72 - 1292.72] what i do is i throw that knapsack out
[1290.72 - 1295.28] every time yeah it gets expensive and
[1292.72 - 1298.32] it's annoying but i try to balance my
[1295.28 - 1300.64] own personal life budget to that
[1298.32 - 1301.36] you know so when i travel and i have to
[1300.64 - 1304.80] stick that
[1301.36 - 1309.04] that knapsack that on through that
[1304.80 - 1311.04] radiation little spot right there right
[1309.04 - 1312.72] if i do that i know that that thing's
[1311.04 - 1314.24] gonna collect so much radiation
[1312.72 - 1316.40] that if i have it in my house or
[1314.24 - 1317.76] whatever it is or wherever i am and i
[1316.40 - 1319.92] have it it's going to constantly be
[1317.76 - 1321.60] radiating that radiation right so
[1319.92 - 1323.52] it's these things that matter all these
[1321.60 - 1324.80] little things add up so what can we do
[1323.52 - 1326.96] for ourselves celery juice is one of
[1324.80 - 1330.16] those things that can also help us
[1326.96 - 1331.76] um yeah susan gross is a harmful
[1330.16 - 1333.68] fly choice of years twice a year isn't
[1331.76 - 1335.28] bad but just look out for those very
[1333.68 - 1337.92] things right
[1335.28 - 1340.16] so um here's the thing about celery
[1337.92 - 1343.56] juice if you're gonna buy celery juice
[1340.16 - 1347.36] don't do hpp don't buy it with
[1343.56 - 1349.12] hpp that is a bad
[1347.36 - 1350.88] trick going down right now and i know
[1349.12 - 1353.04] i'm not going to make any friends
[1350.88 - 1354.88] once again every time i look out for you
[1353.04 - 1358.32] guys
[1354.88 - 1359.92] i don't make friends and
[1358.32 - 1361.44] that's another one right there high
[1359.92 - 1364.48] pressure pasteurization
[1361.44 - 1365.60] right and you know high pressure
[1364.48 - 1368.64] pasteurization just
[1365.60 - 1370.56] isn't gonna work uh cat conte celery
[1368.64 - 1372.64] juice daily for six months i am healing
[1370.56 - 1374.00] and had an excellent checkup new book is
[1372.64 - 1375.60] god send two the new
[1374.00 - 1377.12] book you guys i didn't even show you my
[1375.60 - 1379.28] book right
[1377.12 - 1380.16] revise and expand it new edition the
[1379.28 - 1381.68] medical medium
[1380.16 - 1383.20] new edition it's gotta be the new
[1381.68 - 1385.92] edition definitely
[1383.20 - 1386.56] definitely gonna be a new edition right
[1385.92 - 1388.80] so
[1386.56 - 1390.88] hpp is something that's a new uh
[1388.80 - 1392.56] pasteurization process that's fairly new
[1390.88 - 1395.84] in the last decade right
[1392.56 - 1398.32] and it allows juices
[1395.84 - 1399.36] on the store shelf to look like they're
[1398.32 - 1401.60] raw
[1399.36 - 1402.80] and to look like they're fresh just
[1401.60 - 1405.92] letting you know
[1402.80 - 1410.24] so and and they don't use heat
[1405.92 - 1412.32] to pasteurize so they're allowed to say
[1410.24 - 1413.76] hey this stuff is fresh this stuff is
[1412.32 - 1415.44] raw right
[1413.76 - 1417.20] and it's got a shelf life on there for a
[1415.44 - 1418.16] month or to have a shelf life on there
[1417.20 - 1420.24] for three
[1418.16 - 1422.16] three weeks or a shelf life on there for
[1420.24 - 1425.84] you know two weeks you'll see it right
[1422.16 - 1428.96] but if it was really fresh juice
[1425.84 - 1430.64] it only has a few days a shelf life for
[1428.96 - 1432.48] two days
[1430.64 - 1433.68] right so what happens people don't
[1432.48 - 1435.04] realize that they go in the health food
[1433.68 - 1436.24] store
[1435.04 - 1438.08] they walk in here i'm gonna grab
[1436.24 - 1438.56] something after my yoga class here let
[1438.08 - 1440.96] me grab
[1438.56 - 1442.48] whoa celery juice hey it says fresh whoa
[1440.96 - 1442.88] it says raw let me grab it it's in the
[1442.48 - 1444.80] cold
[1442.88 - 1446.72] section let me just grab that celery
[1444.80 - 1449.36] juice and they grab it
[1446.72 - 1451.04] okay and they think they got some fresh
[1449.36 - 1453.44] raw celery juice they go that
[1451.04 - 1454.32] you know they cash out and drink in it
[1453.44 - 1456.88] like okay
[1454.32 - 1457.68] it's not gonna work it's not gonna work
[1456.88 - 1459.68] it's not
[1457.68 - 1460.72] it's been injured so it's been injured
[1459.68 - 1464.00] through high
[1460.72 - 1466.96] pressure pasteurization
[1464.00 - 1467.36] high pressure pasteurization right it's
[1466.96 - 1471.76] not
[1467.36 - 1474.16] fresh it's only fresh if you saw a dude
[1471.76 - 1476.96] there at the health food store running
[1474.16 - 1479.84] that celery through that juicer or
[1476.96 - 1481.04] if a dude or whoever right or if
[1479.84 - 1484.80] somebody working there
[1481.04 - 1487.12] right um was was running that juicer
[1484.80 - 1488.80] and running juice through it right
[1487.12 - 1491.28] meaning creating juice
[1488.80 - 1492.16] and then putting that on the shelf for a
[1491.28 - 1494.48] day or two
[1492.16 - 1495.36] for a day or two you know so that that
[1494.48 - 1497.92] right there
[1495.36 - 1499.36] that's fresh right and that that is not
[1497.92 - 1501.44] going to have a shelf life it's not
[1499.36 - 1504.48] going to have a long-term shelf life
[1501.44 - 1504.48] i'm just telling you right now
[1508.80 - 1515.76] so the juice a little bit
[1513.60 - 1517.84] don't add anything to your celery juice
[1515.76 - 1521.84] i said it before i'll say it again
[1517.84 - 1523.84] don't add anything to your celery juice
[1521.84 - 1525.92] what you'll see out there too is those
[1523.84 - 1526.88] high pressure pasteurization celery
[1525.92 - 1530.48] juices
[1526.88 - 1532.24] hpp which don't work
[1530.48 - 1534.40] what you'll see is they'll have lemon in
[1532.24 - 1534.40] it
[1535.04 - 1539.20] it's a bad idea that's strike number two
[1538.00 - 1541.60] and
[1539.20 - 1543.60] strike number two you add something to
[1541.60 - 1545.12] your celery juice it's not gonna work
[1543.60 - 1549.60] the way it's supposed to
[1545.12 - 1552.72] you dilute the sodium cluster salts
[1549.60 - 1555.84] it's what you do right you dilute the
[1552.72 - 1558.32] sodium cluster salts
[1555.84 - 1559.04] you don't want to add anything to it no
[1558.32 - 1562.96] ice
[1559.04 - 1564.80] no water no ice and no water
[1562.96 - 1566.08] very important to know okay you don't
[1564.80 - 1568.96] want to add
[1566.08 - 1570.56] ice or water right by the way this is
[1568.96 - 1575.04] the mm-900
[1570.56 - 1575.04] hds um
[1579.04 - 1585.84] i'm working with omega on this juicer
[1581.68 - 1585.84] you guys know that
[1587.12 - 1591.76] so one of the things that happened that
[1590.24 - 1593.92] happens all the time is
[1591.76 - 1595.44] people will say they did celery juice
[1593.92 - 1596.88] and i've been doing this for so many
[1595.44 - 1599.20] years and
[1596.88 - 1600.40] people say they i i tried celery juice
[1599.20 - 1601.76] no they didn't
[1600.40 - 1604.48] i can't tell you how many people in the
[1601.76 - 1606.56] health scene no they tried carrot
[1604.48 - 1607.68] celery apple and beets together is what
[1606.56 - 1610.84] they tried
[1607.68 - 1612.36] no one was juicing celery by itself
[1610.84 - 1615.44] therapeutically
[1612.36 - 1617.20] therapeutically right it would be this
[1615.44 - 1619.76] if if it ever happened it would be
[1617.20 - 1622.32] because someone just for some reason
[1619.76 - 1624.16] happenstance had only celery in their
[1622.32 - 1626.48] fridge and not one other vegetable or
[1624.16 - 1628.88] fruit and decided to juice right
[1626.48 - 1630.24] but nobody ever did it therapeutically
[1628.88 - 1633.20] right as as
[1630.24 - 1635.36] as a medicine an herbal medicine and
[1633.20 - 1637.36] what i love about
[1635.36 - 1638.72] like a good juicer like this one right
[1637.36 - 1640.48] here and you can use any juicer if you
[1638.72 - 1641.68] have a juicer use any juicer you can use
[1640.48 - 1642.64] a blender and strain it through a
[1641.68 - 1645.28] cheesecloth
[1642.64 - 1646.32] and nut milk bag right what i love about
[1645.28 - 1650.08] this juicer is
[1646.32 - 1652.32] is this pulp comes out so ridiculously
[1650.08 - 1655.44] dry so i'm saving money
[1652.32 - 1658.08] that's what i love about this one
[1655.44 - 1658.64] so the tr that so where people get
[1658.08 - 1661.20] fooled
[1658.64 - 1663.36] is they put ice in their celery juice
[1661.20 - 1665.28] they add water to their celery juice
[1663.36 - 1666.56] if you're gonna blend it don't add water
[1665.28 - 1668.08] to your blender
[1666.56 - 1669.92] you're just gonna have to keep on
[1668.08 - 1671.44] blending it pushing it down and blending
[1669.92 - 1675.36] it not adding water
[1671.44 - 1675.36] ichota good to see you you're here too
[1677.44 - 1683.68] so why is celery juice helping people
[1682.32 - 1685.20] heal i'm going to talk about that in a
[1683.68 - 1688.24] minute like the power
[1685.20 - 1690.08] it has why it's helping people and
[1688.24 - 1690.88] bringing their lives back and moving the
[1690.08 - 1694.40] needle
[1690.88 - 1694.40] to cover that in a couple of minutes
[1695.68 - 1701.60] you're someone sensitive to celery juice
[1699.12 - 1703.92] there's a lot of bugs in your system a
[1701.60 - 1705.44] lot of people got bad bacteria in their
[1703.92 - 1707.76] intestinal lining
[1705.44 - 1709.88] right right on their intestinal lining
[1707.76 - 1712.00] bad
[1709.88 - 1715.28] streptococcus that's one of them right
[1712.00 - 1717.84] there a lot of people have that strep
[1715.28 - 1718.64] right that's a bacteria right there they
[1717.84 - 1720.56] got the strep
[1718.64 - 1722.00] in there that's what gives you your sibo
[1720.56 - 1724.32] your bloating
[1722.00 - 1725.20] all kinds of other issues it's that
[1724.32 - 1729.04] strep
[1725.20 - 1733.12] and when you put the celery juice in you
[1729.04 - 1736.32] you're actually killing off that strep
[1733.12 - 1737.92] you're killing off those bugs and you
[1736.32 - 1739.60] may only have you may be somebody that
[1737.92 - 1741.28] could only do a little bit to start with
[1739.60 - 1743.44] you start with a small amount
[1741.28 - 1745.44] for somebody that can only do a little
[1743.44 - 1747.12] bit of celery juice and that's that's
[1745.44 - 1748.24] what you do then you start with a little
[1747.12 - 1750.56] bit
[1748.24 - 1750.56] um
[1751.60 - 1755.28] and don't go like oh don't do a ton of
[1755.04 - 1757.12] it
[1755.28 - 1759.36] well a ton of it don't do 16 ounces
[1757.12 - 1762.08] don't do 32 ounces then start small
[1759.36 - 1763.44] do four ounces do two ounces start at
[1762.08 - 1765.68] that level
[1763.44 - 1767.44] joy and sago says are you doing celery
[1765.68 - 1770.80] juice
[1767.44 - 1773.20] after doing celery juice for about nine
[1770.80 - 1776.56] months my endocrinologist lowered my
[1773.20 - 1780.00] daily synthroid intake
[1776.56 - 1782.00] that's incredible that's incredible
[1780.00 - 1783.12] are you doing other tools medical medium
[1782.00 - 1784.32] tools too
[1783.12 - 1788.48] are you doing medical medium
[1784.32 - 1788.48] supplementation protocols as well
[1789.92 - 1793.44] because that's there too people can go
[1791.60 - 1794.24] as far as they want with their thyroid
[1793.44 - 1797.28] problems
[1794.24 - 1799.28] when you have the right tools
[1797.28 - 1801.04] peggy says don't add water to blended
[1799.28 - 1802.32] celery juice peggy you're so right peggy
[1801.04 - 1805.68] o'connor thanks for being here
[1802.32 - 1806.08] today debbie manning how long is it good
[1805.68 - 1809.84] for
[1806.08 - 1813.20] in the fridge um
[1809.84 - 1816.24] celery juice is good in the fridge
[1813.20 - 1818.56] for a couple of days but honestly
[1816.24 - 1819.52] i don't like i don't like keeping it in
[1818.56 - 1821.44] there that long
[1819.52 - 1822.72] i don't i like to drink it right after i
[1821.44 - 1823.84] made it that's when it's best and the
[1822.72 - 1826.24] most powerful
[1823.84 - 1829.52] so celery juice is the most powerful and
[1826.24 - 1833.68] and at its best
[1829.52 - 1836.96] right when it's made fresh yeah
[1833.68 - 1839.76] tara appleman tara good to see you uh
[1836.96 - 1841.28] audrey antler pretty sure that they they
[1839.76 - 1844.32] are being misleading
[1841.28 - 1847.36] in saying that it's cold pressed
[1844.32 - 1849.52] maybe but then hpp terry you're
[1847.36 - 1850.48] spot on incredible actually because
[1849.52 - 1852.96] people don't understand
[1850.48 - 1854.48] hpp out there so that that's amazing you
[1852.96 - 1855.36] know but then again you know a lot of
[1854.48 - 1857.12] stuff
[1855.36 - 1859.44] you're really knowledgeable um high
[1857.12 - 1860.88] pressure pasteurized hpp which lengthens
[1859.44 - 1863.28] the shelf life
[1860.88 - 1864.00] but destroys the healing power of it
[1863.28 - 1866.56] that was said
[1864.00 - 1868.40] so perfectly tara appleman like that was
[1866.56 - 1870.16] so perfectly said
[1868.40 - 1871.60] it's actually said way better than what
[1870.16 - 1872.96] what i was talking about
[1871.60 - 1876.84] you know about it i don't even think i
[1872.96 - 1879.44] was clear that was really to the point
[1876.84 - 1882.48] um incredible really
[1879.44 - 1884.56] so i'm gonna strain
[1882.48 - 1885.92] some right here and put some in here
[1884.56 - 1888.80] through the strainer
[1885.92 - 1888.80] so i have
[1888.96 - 1892.48] a glass here i think i'm gonna have
[1890.56 - 1895.84] plenty left over
[1892.48 - 1895.84] in this big tall glass
[1899.36 - 1903.84] there you go put that right there for
[1902.96 - 1906.88] now
[1903.84 - 1909.84] um you know what's incredible about
[1906.88 - 1910.32] this juicer is this pulp is dry to the
[1909.84 - 1913.44] bone
[1910.32 - 1915.12] bone just dry that's it i mean when i
[1913.44 - 1918.40] think about it it still blows my
[1915.12 - 1921.04] blows my mind really um daniel
[1918.40 - 1923.20] anthony i wash i wash my conventional
[1921.04 - 1924.40] celery with sodium bicarbonate is that
[1923.20 - 1926.64] okay
[1924.40 - 1928.40] this week you said you would not consume
[1926.64 - 1930.24] sodium i would not eat it no
[1928.40 - 1931.60] i i wouldn't i wouldn't take it i
[1930.24 - 1934.32] wouldn't consume it
[1931.60 - 1936.32] if you're gonna wash with it just wash
[1934.32 - 1938.00] the sodium bicarbonate off
[1936.32 - 1940.24] make sure that that's washed off good
[1938.00 - 1941.04] okay and you can even use a little bit
[1940.24 - 1943.92] of natural
[1941.04 - 1945.92] dish soap if you wanted to like in like
[1943.92 - 1948.40] a little gentle studs in a
[1945.92 - 1950.16] big bowl of water but if you want to do
[1948.40 - 1952.00] the sodium bicarbonate just make sure
[1950.16 - 1954.96] that sodium bicarbonate is
[1952.00 - 1955.76] is washed off that's all if it's washed
[1954.96 - 1959.12] off then
[1955.76 - 1959.12] you know you're looking better
[1960.56 - 1964.24] but it could have some residue so make
[1962.56 - 1967.60] sure you wash it off carefully
[1964.24 - 1969.68] that's all like really good um
[1967.60 - 1972.32] i mean honestly with celery you don't
[1969.68 - 1973.68] even have if you're using warm water
[1972.32 - 1975.20] that's an option right there a lot of
[1973.68 - 1975.68] times i'll just use warm water in the
[1975.20 - 1978.80] bowl
[1975.68 - 1980.16] and i'll massage the celery and rinse it
[1978.80 - 1982.08] massage it rinse it
[1980.16 - 1983.68] and get the inside of the stalks like
[1982.08 - 1985.60] this right here with my thumb
[1983.68 - 1987.68] and i'm using just warm water and i'm
[1985.60 - 1990.16] not using anything else right
[1987.68 - 1991.92] with conventional too but yeah if you
[1990.16 - 1994.40] want to use sodium bicarbonate
[1991.92 - 1995.20] you can but just make sure you're
[1994.40 - 1996.64] washing off
[1995.20 - 1998.56] as much as you can of that too and
[1996.64 - 2000.96] there's no residue left over
[1998.56 - 2001.92] try to be cautious on that level because
[2000.96 - 2004.00] you don't want to ingest sodium
[2001.92 - 2006.32] bicarbonate i mean it's you know
[2004.00 - 2007.44] but there's a question on the juicer
[2006.32 - 2011.36] it's uh
[2007.44 - 2014.24] mm-900 hds so mm-900 hds
[2011.36 - 2015.12] um i mean honestly it saved me so much
[2014.24 - 2017.52] money it's
[2015.12 - 2019.44] ridiculous at this point i can't tell
[2017.52 - 2021.20] you how much celery i would buy
[2019.44 - 2022.48] and any juicer i've tried i don't care
[2021.20 - 2023.84] what kind of juicer it was and i've
[2022.48 - 2026.00] tried them all
[2023.84 - 2027.12] it would just be like you're you've got
[2026.00 - 2029.12] the wet pulp
[2027.12 - 2030.80] right because you're not getting enough
[2029.12 - 2032.00] juice out of it so you're literally
[2030.80 - 2033.36] losing money while
[2032.00 - 2035.44] you're trying to do it and that's why i
[2033.36 - 2037.28] like the mm-900 it's an affordable
[2035.44 - 2037.84] really compared to so many models out
[2037.28 - 2040.48] there
[2037.84 - 2041.20] and then it's dry to the bone and that's
[2040.48 - 2043.44] the
[2041.20 - 2044.84] that's that's incredible it's like my
[2043.44 - 2047.76] favorite
[2044.84 - 2050.88] um yeah julie
[2047.76 - 2053.52] jewel julie says that juicer is the best
[2050.88 - 2054.64] my pulp is very dry thanks anthony it's
[2053.52 - 2056.56] incredible right
[2054.64 - 2060.16] i've given the the company my full
[2056.56 - 2063.76] endorsement this is omega juicers.com
[2060.16 - 2066.08] you get it there um this is the mm-900
[2063.76 - 2067.44] hds salary juicer i'm working with the
[2066.08 - 2069.36] company
[2067.44 - 2071.28] as far as like to try to really like
[2069.36 - 2074.08] benefit people's lives with this
[2071.28 - 2076.00] adriana adi i don't have any reaction to
[2074.08 - 2077.84] celery juice does that mean i don't have
[2076.00 - 2079.68] bad bacteria
[2077.84 - 2080.96] a couple of things it means is that
[2079.68 - 2084.32] there's a good chance
[2080.96 - 2086.08] that you don't have um
[2084.32 - 2087.92] there's different kinds of bacteria some
[2086.08 - 2089.04] bacteria is more toxic so that when it
[2087.92 - 2092.16] dies
[2089.04 - 2094.40] you you feel it you feel it when it dies
[2092.16 - 2096.16] so that could be some runs that could be
[2094.40 - 2097.36] some extra bloating it could be anything
[2096.16 - 2099.36] like that right so
[2097.36 - 2101.76] you feel it okay then you can have
[2099.36 - 2103.12] different varieties of bad bacteria like
[2101.76 - 2105.76] low-grade strep that's
[2103.12 - 2106.48] not aggressive doesn't it's not as it
[2105.76 - 2109.76] it's not as
[2106.48 - 2110.16] toxic and that's one thing or you don't
[2109.76 - 2113.20] have
[2110.16 - 2114.24] a heck of a lot of toxins in you so that
[2113.20 - 2116.56] the bacteria
[2114.24 - 2117.76] in you isn't loaded they're not like
[2116.56 - 2119.92] loaded guns
[2117.76 - 2122.48] so you know it's it's like or bombs
[2119.92 - 2123.68] right the more toxic stuff you have in
[2122.48 - 2126.00] you
[2123.68 - 2127.12] the more the bad bacteria that you have
[2126.00 - 2129.68] in you gets
[2127.12 - 2131.28] extra toxic so when you kill off that
[2129.68 - 2133.68] bacteria
[2131.28 - 2134.88] there's a splash right there's an
[2133.68 - 2137.12] aftermath awake
[2134.88 - 2138.80] right so there's a good chance maybe you
[2137.12 - 2140.32] don't have a lot of toxins in your
[2138.80 - 2143.36] intestinal tract
[2140.32 - 2145.60] maybe you have more toxins in your liver
[2143.36 - 2146.96] see and when they're in your liver you
[2145.60 - 2148.96] may not feel it like that
[2146.96 - 2151.20] some people they got a ton of stuff in
[2148.96 - 2153.44] their gut a lot of it a lot of toxins a
[2151.20 - 2154.96] lot of bacteria that's eating the toxins
[2153.44 - 2157.20] the minute that celery juice goes down
[2154.96 - 2159.84] in there it's like a bomb blows off
[2157.20 - 2160.64] right these bugs they'll just you know
[2159.84 - 2162.72] we can weaken
[2160.64 - 2164.40] and explode the sodium cluster salt i'll
[2162.72 - 2164.88] just use this orange as a sodium cluster
[2164.40 - 2167.04] salt
[2164.88 - 2168.08] that sodium cluster salt sticks to the
[2167.04 - 2171.12] bug
[2168.08 - 2173.20] that's what happens stay stuck to it
[2171.12 - 2174.24] and stay stuck to it and eats away at
[2173.20 - 2177.68] the bug
[2174.24 - 2180.96] until the bug just falls apart kind of
[2177.68 - 2182.40] kind of concaves in right and when that
[2180.96 - 2184.56] does that
[2182.40 - 2185.60] boom all the poison in that bug comes
[2184.56 - 2187.68] out so
[2185.60 - 2189.20] your bugs might not have a lot of
[2187.68 - 2190.80] different poisons in them that are more
[2189.20 - 2191.44] aggressive some people have bugs and
[2190.80 - 2194.40] they're they're
[2191.44 - 2196.32] filled chalk full of poisons right so
[2194.40 - 2198.32] there's all these different variables
[2196.32 - 2199.84] that's one thing right there um you
[2198.32 - 2200.32] might have more stuff going on in your
[2199.84 - 2202.08] liver
[2200.32 - 2203.52] you might have some more stuff going on
[2202.08 - 2204.88] in your nervous system might have stuff
[2203.52 - 2205.92] more stuff going on in these other
[2204.88 - 2208.80] places
[2205.92 - 2209.92] but in somebody else to just have a
[2208.80 - 2212.24] trail of
[2209.92 - 2214.00] bad stuff inside their gut right their
[2212.24 - 2217.36] intestinal lining bugs of all
[2214.00 - 2218.08] kinds dehydrated proteins stuck to the
[2217.36 - 2221.28] walls
[2218.08 - 2224.40] with bugs behind them e coli c diff
[2221.28 - 2226.48] streptococcus staph all in their gut
[2224.40 - 2228.24] you know maybe throw a couple of worms
[2226.48 - 2229.68] in there too which aren't parasites
[2228.24 - 2231.20] they're worms
[2229.68 - 2232.88] it's very important to know two
[2231.20 - 2236.00] different distinct distinct
[2232.88 - 2239.68] distinctions really important
[2236.00 - 2242.64] heidi hey what if what if diagnosed with
[2239.68 - 2244.32] celery allergy well okay okay so be your
[2242.64 - 2246.00] own detective right
[2244.32 - 2247.92] and i talk to doctors about this one all
[2246.00 - 2249.36] the time like what if you're diagnosed
[2247.92 - 2251.60] with a celery allergy and i've been
[2249.36 - 2253.20] asked that by doctors okay it's like
[2251.60 - 2255.36] wait a minute does that mean something
[2253.20 - 2259.36] happens when you eat the celery like
[2255.36 - 2262.88] is something happening is it where
[2259.36 - 2265.20] is it where your um
[2262.88 - 2266.72] is it where something happens in the
[2265.20 - 2268.08] sense where you eat it and your throat
[2266.72 - 2270.48] closes up
[2268.08 - 2272.32] is that that kind of allergy or you eat
[2270.48 - 2273.68] it and your mouth does something weird
[2272.32 - 2276.32] and swells
[2273.68 - 2279.28] is it that kind of allergy like what's
[2276.32 - 2282.24] going on there is it something like that
[2279.28 - 2284.00] because these are things to consider or
[2282.24 - 2287.76] nothing happens
[2284.00 - 2289.20] nothing happens okay you're just
[2287.76 - 2293.36] just living your life and nothing
[2289.20 - 2297.68] happens is it that
[2293.36 - 2301.68] and and but yet you had
[2297.68 - 2304.00] a practitioner do you know an all cat or
[2301.68 - 2307.20] or a food sensitivity test and they
[2304.00 - 2309.44] listed the celery on your test
[2307.20 - 2311.28] now here's the first question i'll i'll
[2309.44 - 2313.84] ask you right
[2311.28 - 2316.32] what do you think about this okay what
[2313.84 - 2318.32] do you think about this
[2316.32 - 2320.00] all of our doctors and practitioners
[2318.32 - 2320.96] don't know why we have chronic illness
[2320.00 - 2322.48] and they don't know what causes
[2320.96 - 2324.00] autoimmune okay
[2322.48 - 2325.92] they're trying their best to help in any
[2324.00 - 2329.20] way they possibly can
[2325.92 - 2331.36] so we have our practitioners
[2329.20 - 2333.20] they might be good at looking and
[2331.36 - 2335.20] reading at a test
[2333.20 - 2337.44] say a test like a food allergy
[2335.20 - 2340.56] sensitivity test right
[2337.44 - 2341.12] but it is is it even right like it is it
[2340.56 - 2345.20] even
[2341.12 - 2348.00] on is it even spot on is it even like
[2345.20 - 2348.88] is it right is it correct because what
[2348.00 - 2351.44] i've learned
[2348.88 - 2353.84] is there are foods that help you that
[2351.44 - 2355.60] show up as an allergen on your test
[2353.84 - 2357.60] because that food that's helping you is
[2355.60 - 2361.12] battling the bad stuff
[2357.60 - 2363.12] okay i've seen that in tests too
[2361.12 - 2364.80] i've also seen foods that don't help you
[2363.12 - 2368.32] show up on a food allergy test but
[2364.80 - 2368.72] more more occasions i see foods that are
[2368.32 - 2370.80] actually
[2368.72 - 2372.16] helping people show up on the allergy
[2370.80 - 2373.44] test they'll be like oh
[2372.16 - 2375.36] strawberries strawberries are really
[2373.44 - 2377.04] good for us they're incredible right oh
[2375.36 - 2378.96] figs you're allergic to figs right
[2377.04 - 2381.28] oh no you're allergic to cilantro too
[2378.96 - 2382.64] we're reading your test right here
[2381.28 - 2384.80] and it looks like we're allergic to
[2382.64 - 2385.68] cilantro looks like we're allergic to
[2384.80 - 2388.56] parsley
[2385.68 - 2389.92] you know the whole bit and and um and
[2388.56 - 2391.36] then we'll we'll think
[2389.92 - 2393.52] that okay wait a minute there's
[2391.36 - 2395.04] something here you're allergic to rag
[2393.52 - 2397.44] rad wheat ragweed
[2395.04 - 2400.56] you're allergic to cilantro parsley
[2397.44 - 2402.16] you're allergic to star and nice
[2400.56 - 2404.72] allergic to ginger allergic to
[2402.16 - 2408.48] strawberries allergic to a blackberry
[2404.72 - 2410.00] allergic to rutabaga you're allergic to
[2408.48 - 2412.80] you know you'll see the weirdest thing
[2410.00 - 2414.72] radish you're allergic to you'll see
[2412.80 - 2416.08] and celery you'll see all of a sudden
[2414.72 - 2417.28] then they'll say oh you're allergic to
[2416.08 - 2419.20] gluten too
[2417.28 - 2420.40] right they'll throw the gluten in there
[2419.20 - 2423.36] you're allergic to
[2420.40 - 2424.40] you're allergic to uh sheep's milk and
[2423.36 - 2427.36] they come out with this
[2424.40 - 2428.00] random random stuff like on the test
[2427.36 - 2431.20] right
[2428.00 - 2433.84] you're allergic to caseopod
[2431.20 - 2435.76] you're allergic to chamomile you're
[2433.84 - 2437.92] allergic too and they got this
[2435.76 - 2439.52] whole thing going down where it's like
[2437.92 - 2441.44] now you're like allergic to all this
[2439.52 - 2442.56]  right you're just allergic to all
[2441.44 - 2446.00] this stuff
[2442.56 - 2449.68] okay and meanwhile
[2446.00 - 2451.36] the the guy right he or she
[2449.68 - 2452.96] doesn't even know why anybody's sick out
[2451.36 - 2454.72] there that's what's amazing
[2452.96 - 2456.40] they don't know why everybody's dealing
[2454.72 - 2457.76] with fibro and hashimoto's they don't
[2456.40 - 2459.36] know it causes anything they don't know
[2457.76 - 2460.32] why people are sick with exomus rises
[2459.36 - 2461.44] they don't know why people have all
[2460.32 - 2462.96] these symptoms they don't know why
[2461.44 - 2464.96] people have anxiety depression but it's
[2462.96 - 2466.08] like but yeah they're spot on about
[2464.96 - 2467.84] reading a test
[2466.08 - 2470.24] which is a whole other thing all on its
[2467.84 - 2471.68] own so um
[2470.24 - 2473.60] so what happens is with the food
[2471.68 - 2476.72] sensitivity test if if a
[2473.60 - 2478.80] food is killing off pathogens
[2476.72 - 2480.40] it might show up on that food
[2478.80 - 2483.84] sensitivity test
[2480.40 - 2487.04] if it's killing off bugs and then
[2483.84 - 2488.80] if a food is feeding bugs
[2487.04 - 2491.76] it may show up on that food sensitivity
[2488.80 - 2492.08] test too but are you really allergic to
[2491.76 - 2494.64] it
[2492.08 - 2495.84] see what i talked to this this other
[2494.64 - 2498.56] doctor friend of mine
[2495.84 - 2498.96] many years ago it's like 25 years ago
[2498.56 - 2501.36] right
[2498.96 - 2503.44] and um i talked to him recently and he's
[2501.36 - 2504.72] like 94 years old now you know and i've
[2503.44 - 2506.24] been helping him with his health his
[2504.72 - 2507.04] whole life right all these years and his
[2506.24 - 2509.12] whole life but
[2507.04 - 2510.08] for as long as i've known him i mean his
[2509.12 - 2511.84] his his
[2510.08 - 2514.32] elder life i've been helping him with
[2511.84 - 2516.32] right and not the beginning in his life
[2514.32 - 2518.08] i wasn't born yet but the point is is
[2516.32 - 2521.84] that what i've learned
[2518.08 - 2524.96] from him is that he said an allergic
[2521.84 - 2528.16] reaction to a fruit or a vegetable
[2524.96 - 2529.20] right or anything like that okay or an
[2528.16 - 2532.00] herb
[2529.20 - 2533.92] you have to experience it where your
[2532.00 - 2535.04] throat's doing something like closing
[2533.92 - 2538.08] off you know
[2535.04 - 2541.52] your mouth swells and you can't breathe
[2538.08 - 2543.60] your lips swell up right and then
[2541.52 - 2544.80] that's how the old-school way to
[2543.60 - 2546.40] determine if you're really allergic
[2544.80 - 2548.08] because the new school
[2546.40 - 2549.60] which he's seen too out there with all
[2548.08 - 2552.64] the food sensitivity tests
[2549.60 - 2553.68] the new school doesn't add up unless
[2552.64 - 2556.00] you're experiencing
[2553.68 - 2557.52] like every time you bite onto a celery
[2556.00 - 2559.04] stick
[2557.52 - 2560.88] do you break out in a rash every time
[2559.04 - 2561.84] you bite out mine in a celery stick your
[2560.88 - 2564.72] throat swallows up
[2561.84 - 2568.00] like that's the allergy like that's the
[2564.72 - 2568.00] same thing with any food right
[2568.40 - 2575.52] mirrorless um aw with the cj and
[2572.12 - 2577.76] hmds cause an ear and headache
[2575.52 - 2580.40] from detoxing the brain have been in a
[2577.76 - 2583.04] screeching pain for 10 days
[2580.40 - 2583.44] i've never seen it cause any of that um
[2583.04 - 2587.20] but
[2583.44 - 2588.00] if that was me i'd be glad i was doing
[2587.20 - 2589.36] cj
[2588.00 - 2590.88] if that was me do what your doctor tells
[2589.36 - 2592.08] you to do if he doesn't watch on cj or
[2590.88 - 2593.92] not you do what your doctor tells you
[2592.08 - 2596.80] but if it was me
[2593.92 - 2597.52] um i'm i would be happy i'm on cj
[2596.80 - 2599.92] because i'm
[2597.52 - 2600.80] i would be hoping the cj could be
[2599.92 - 2603.68] helping
[2600.80 - 2605.20] so that's not worse than it would be and
[2603.68 - 2606.56] then i always backtrack what else did i
[2605.20 - 2608.96] do what else did i do
[2606.56 - 2610.32] is it a is it a new medical treatment i
[2608.96 - 2613.68] might have gotten involved in
[2610.32 - 2616.80] is it is it um exposure
[2613.68 - 2619.28] without realizing it is it um
[2616.80 - 2621.04] exposure to air fresheners exposure to
[2619.28 - 2622.40] cologne perfume is it exposure to
[2621.04 - 2624.96] scented candles
[2622.40 - 2626.72] is it was my immune system down did i
[2624.96 - 2628.24] get a blood draw a month ago and
[2626.72 - 2630.24] i didn't know it but my immune system
[2628.24 - 2632.16] dropped down did i get a blood draw two
[2630.24 - 2634.00] months ago and now i'm on this road of
[2632.16 - 2636.08] now getting sicker because i had
[2634.00 - 2637.12] all this blood drawn from me right i
[2636.08 - 2638.96] would do all the like
[2637.12 - 2640.96] the spot checking like what else is
[2638.96 - 2642.56] happening am i under a lot of stress
[2640.96 - 2644.00] you know how's my relationships going
[2642.56 - 2646.96] did i have a hard time did it
[2644.00 - 2648.00] trigger me into something um anything
[2646.96 - 2650.64] like that i would go through
[2648.00 - 2652.24] all the paces all the paces right and
[2650.64 - 2653.76] then i would look into i would even look
[2652.24 - 2655.04] into look get this free at the library
[2653.76 - 2656.56] if you don't want to buy it this is the
[2655.04 - 2658.08] new edition medical medium new edition i
[2656.56 - 2659.20] got a migraine chapter in here and then
[2658.08 - 2660.80] you can really look into all the
[2659.20 - 2662.64] migraines and see
[2660.80 - 2664.56] what's happening all the migraine stuff
[2662.64 - 2667.92] so that's important to know right there
[2664.56 - 2667.92] juicing a little bit more celery
[2672.72 - 2678.80] so these are all things to consider
[2676.88 - 2679.92] so we covered a little food sensitivity
[2678.80 - 2681.92] stuff is really cool
[2679.92 - 2683.68] i love talking about that because people
[2681.92 - 2684.40] really don't know a lot about it you
[2683.68 - 2685.76] know
[2684.40 - 2691.84] so it's so important to have that
[2685.76 - 2691.84] information it really is
[2693.04 - 2697.44] monica l smith says i don't have a
[2695.04 - 2698.64] juicer but i cut up my celery into small
[2697.44 - 2702.08] pieces
[2698.64 - 2704.32] add to my blender add a banana blueberry
[2702.08 - 2705.20] spinach and cilantro love it i don't add
[2704.32 - 2707.04] no water rice
[2705.20 - 2708.40] well first of all i just love that
[2707.04 - 2710.24] you're doing that monica
[2708.40 - 2712.48] i love it okay you want to make a
[2710.24 - 2714.48] smoothie
[2712.48 - 2715.76] you want to make a smoothie and you want
[2714.48 - 2719.04] celery in your smoothie
[2715.76 - 2719.84] it's healthy right it's not going to do
[2719.04 - 2721.84] the same
[2719.84 - 2722.88] thing it's not going to be the same
[2721.84 - 2725.92] thing
[2722.88 - 2727.20] as celery juice on its own okay because
[2725.92 - 2728.64] you're mixing it with something you're
[2727.20 - 2728.96] mixing it with fruits and vegetables
[2728.64 - 2730.32] right
[2728.96 - 2732.32] so you're mixing it with all this other
[2730.32 - 2735.12] stuff so it can't
[2732.32 - 2736.24] do the same thing it's supposed to do
[2735.12 - 2739.60] right
[2736.24 - 2741.36] and but you made a really healthy
[2739.60 - 2743.28] smoothie
[2741.36 - 2744.88] totally now if that was me you do what
[2743.28 - 2745.68] your doctors tells you of course but if
[2744.88 - 2749.60] it was me
[2745.68 - 2752.00] i would add you know bemergey spirulina
[2749.60 - 2752.64] i would add some barley grass juice
[2752.00 - 2754.16] powder
[2752.64 - 2756.08] it wouldn't be the medical medium heavy
[2754.16 - 2759.28] metal detox movie but it would be
[2756.08 - 2761.04] getting closer to it and then
[2759.28 - 2763.20] and then i would i would you know amp it
[2761.04 - 2765.20] up if you're gonna makeshift a smoothie
[2763.20 - 2768.80] of some kind wanting it to help
[2765.20 - 2770.64] but it's not gonna do what celery
[2768.80 - 2772.64] celery does on its own when you juice
[2770.64 - 2774.32] celery by itself okay
[2772.64 - 2777.44] so keep that in mind too that's
[2774.32 - 2777.44] important to keep in mind
[2777.60 - 2783.04] um so
[2780.96 - 2784.16] why does celery help us so much i'll
[2783.04 - 2788.00] give you a little
[2784.16 - 2790.72] give you a little show in a second too
[2788.00 - 2793.12] to see you guys today i'm really happy
[2790.72 - 2793.12] about this
[2794.80 - 2798.48] i'm just juicing a little extra i used
[2796.72 - 2800.00] to be glass a couple seconds ago and i'm
[2798.48 - 2801.28] gonna i'm gonna juice a little bit more
[2800.00 - 2804.24] real quick right now
[2801.28 - 2805.20] i'm gonna pour some as we speak um a
[2804.24 - 2808.00] little extra
[2805.20 - 2808.00] is what i'm doing
[2810.96 - 2816.00] what i like to do is any pulp left over
[2813.36 - 2817.04] i like to press it with my fingers on
[2816.00 - 2820.80] top of it too
[2817.04 - 2820.80] there's so it's just so great
[2823.20 - 2827.20] maria says common sense when i do the
[2825.60 - 2830.96] food sensitivity test
[2827.20 - 2834.24] and they told me i am
[2830.96 - 2838.08] all w-r-g-i
[2834.24 - 2839.52] gender to spinach oh you're allergic to
[2838.08 - 2842.56] spinach and such
[2839.52 - 2846.16] i instinctively knew it was complete
[2842.56 - 2846.16]  common sense
[2847.12 - 2851.04] yeah yeah and that's that's incredible
[2849.52 - 2853.60] you know
[2851.04 - 2853.60] um so
[2857.20 - 2860.96] it makes a lot of sense exactly honestly
[2859.92 - 2862.24] they'll tell you you're allergic to
[2860.96 - 2864.00] spinach right they'll say you're
[2862.24 - 2866.00] allergic to spinach or something
[2864.00 - 2867.04] and but you're not allergic to spinach
[2866.00 - 2868.88] right
[2867.04 - 2870.96] food sensitivity test i think was one of
[2868.88 - 2875.04] the biggest scams
[2870.96 - 2876.88] of our like alternative medicine days it
[2875.04 - 2878.48] was could still at half conventional
[2876.88 - 2879.76] it really hit the alternative market
[2878.48 - 2880.80] more a lot of functional medicine
[2879.76 - 2882.24] doctors do it doesn't mean the
[2880.80 - 2883.20] functional medicine doctor isn't smart
[2882.24 - 2885.28] doesn't mean the
[2883.20 - 2887.28] functional medicine doctor isn't it
[2885.28 - 2888.56] isn't up on some other stuff
[2887.28 - 2889.84] it just means the functional medicine
[2888.56 - 2891.52] doctor doesn't realize that the food
[2889.84 - 2892.40] sensitivity test really has holes in it
[2891.52 - 2894.88] everywhere
[2892.40 - 2896.73] um i don't even trust the labs on any
[2894.88 - 2898.88] level really
[2896.73 - 2902.08] [Music]
[2898.88 - 2904.48] so red says what brand of juice
[2902.08 - 2905.52] press that so this is a cold pressed
[2904.48 - 2908.72] juicer this is
[2905.52 - 2910.64] a mega juicers.com but
[2908.72 - 2912.04] it they have a lot of juicers there
[2910.64 - 2913.32] don't get them confused this is the
[2912.04 - 2917.36] mm-900
[2913.32 - 2919.12] hds mm-900hds
[2917.36 - 2920.40] this is their celery juicer model but
[2919.12 - 2921.44] you can juice anything in it it's
[2920.40 - 2923.84] incredible
[2921.44 - 2924.72] the pulp comes out so dry it's
[2923.84 - 2926.96] ridiculous
[2924.72 - 2928.08] and i'm saving so much money every every
[2926.96 - 2930.16] year with this now i mean
[2928.08 - 2931.20] it's my end to my second year of saving
[2930.16 - 2934.08] money because i
[2931.20 - 2935.92] get so much so so much celery and i you
[2934.08 - 2937.36] know i juice so much of it it's such a
[2935.92 - 2940.88] great machine
[2937.36 - 2943.44] so what do you do with all the pulp
[2940.88 - 2944.48] it goes to my garden valerie yeah goes
[2943.44 - 2947.12] in my garden
[2944.48 - 2948.32] it does don't get thrown by the whole
[2947.12 - 2951.76] thing where
[2948.32 - 2954.56] you juice and you're wasting all this
[2951.76 - 2955.76] pulp right even if you threw the pulp
[2954.56 - 2957.60] away
[2955.76 - 2959.92] in the garbage bin and didn't use it for
[2957.60 - 2961.28] your garden you're not wasting it
[2959.92 - 2962.56] there's a reason for that first of all
[2961.28 - 2964.16] you're extracting medicine out of the
[2962.56 - 2965.68] celery so you're using it as a medicine
[2964.16 - 2966.96] you're extracting herbal medicine right
[2965.68 - 2967.68] you're doing herbal medicine so you're
[2966.96 - 2969.52] getting all the
[2967.68 - 2971.28] what you need out of it to turn it into
[2969.52 - 2972.64] something just like a tea
[2971.28 - 2975.60] right just like a tea where you throw
[2972.64 - 2976.72] the tea grounds away the other thing is
[2975.60 - 2978.96] and keep this in mind this is an
[2976.72 - 2982.96] important one too is when we
[2978.96 - 2985.36] eat something it all gets thrown away
[2982.96 - 2988.56] the fiber right all the pulp and fiber
[2985.36 - 2990.88] we poop it out in the toilet right so is
[2988.56 - 2992.64] everybody like saving their poop
[2990.88 - 2994.64] because i'm confused about that one i
[2992.64 - 2997.04] had i had some like an r
[2994.64 - 2998.08] an rn registered sorry are not an rn
[2997.04 - 3000.00] nurse an rd
[2998.08 - 3001.68] right registered dietitian confront me
[3000.00 - 3003.12] one time right when i was doing a
[3001.68 - 3005.68] lecture years ago
[3003.12 - 3007.04] and she said okay well that's really
[3005.68 - 3008.00] great so you're just gonna have
[3007.04 - 3010.48] everybody
[3008.00 - 3012.72] throw away and waste all of that fiber
[3010.48 - 3013.92] and pulp and
[3012.72 - 3015.68] that's what you're doing with the
[3013.92 - 3016.96] juicing it's such a bad idea i don't
[3015.68 - 3018.40] believe in juicing i don't believe
[3016.96 - 3020.40] you're doing anything right and i'd be
[3018.40 - 3022.88] like listen listen i said
[3020.40 - 3025.04] everybody who eats she was like you eat
[3022.88 - 3026.72] it you eat it i go okay well you eat it
[3025.04 - 3027.84] and then all the pulp and fiber that you
[3026.72 - 3029.36] can't use
[3027.84 - 3030.56] just like this pulp and fiber here
[3029.36 - 3032.00] because you squeezed everything out of
[3030.56 - 3034.88] it you can't use there's nothing
[3032.00 - 3036.72] in here anymore like this here there's
[3034.88 - 3039.20] nothing you can do with this
[3036.72 - 3041.36] this if you ate the celery this would
[3039.20 - 3043.44] still come out of your back end
[3041.36 - 3045.04] this would still come out of you right
[3043.44 - 3048.00] your bottom end would still
[3045.04 - 3050.08] this would come out right here this this
[3048.00 - 3052.80] this would not get utilized
[3050.08 - 3053.28] every single like the pith from the
[3052.80 - 3055.20] orange
[3053.28 - 3056.48] and the the pulp from the orange is
[3055.20 - 3058.40] going to come out of you
[3056.48 - 3059.76] you're not going to utilize all that
[3058.40 - 3062.48] fiber
[3059.76 - 3062.96] it's going to come out into the toilet
[3062.48 - 3065.04] and
[3062.96 - 3066.88] anything you extract with a good juicer
[3065.04 - 3069.12] especially this juicer right
[3066.88 - 3071.92] because there's nothing left right
[3069.12 - 3075.20] anything you extract with a good juicer
[3071.92 - 3075.76] um it you would be doing the same if you
[3075.20 - 3078.08] ate it
[3075.76 - 3078.88] right but the difference is you can't
[3078.08 - 3080.88] get you
[3078.88 - 3082.00] so the question would be we'll just eat
[3080.88 - 3084.40] it then why juice
[3082.00 - 3086.40] it no that's not how you can actually
[3084.40 - 3089.44] create herbal medicine
[3086.40 - 3090.08] a large extraction of an herbal medicine
[3089.44 - 3094.00] that takes
[3090.08 - 3096.32] no digestion no digestion
[3094.00 - 3098.56] that right there you don't weaken your
[3096.32 - 3100.40] digestive process you strengthen it you
[3098.56 - 3101.68] strengthen your hcl you strengthen your
[3100.40 - 3102.48] stomach glands that's a whole other
[3101.68 - 3105.84] thing there
[3102.48 - 3107.52] okay so you're strengthening your gut
[3105.84 - 3108.48] your digestion you're strengthening your
[3107.52 - 3112.08] hcl
[3108.48 - 3114.08] um your gastric juice production
[3112.08 - 3116.00] from your stomach glands you're
[3114.08 - 3117.84] strengthening your liver
[3116.00 - 3120.48] that's the difference durable medicine
[3117.84 - 3122.40] you can't strengthen so much
[3120.48 - 3124.64] when you're eating all the fiber and
[3122.40 - 3126.40] pull so the argument is this
[3124.64 - 3127.84] is they're like well let's just eat it
[3126.40 - 3129.12] because you're just wasting it anyway
[3127.84 - 3131.04] what are you kidding
[3129.12 - 3132.80] um this is going to come out of you
[3131.04 - 3135.44] everything you eat apples
[3132.80 - 3136.96] meat whatever is coming whatever's left
[3135.44 - 3138.64] of what you're eating that can't be
[3136.96 - 3140.56] broken down
[3138.64 - 3142.48] is going out the toi into the toilet
[3140.56 - 3143.28] right so what are you gonna do i mean
[3142.48 - 3145.92] you may as well
[3143.28 - 3146.64] juice a medicine throw this in your
[3145.92 - 3148.72] garden
[3146.64 - 3149.92] so you're actually being able to use the
[3148.72 - 3151.84] fiber much
[3149.92 - 3153.20] better than if you just ate the stuff
[3151.84 - 3155.92] went to the bathroom and it went
[3153.20 - 3158.96] out to the septic right so and that
[3155.92 - 3160.72] that's important to know
[3158.96 - 3162.96] it looks like this model juicer is just
[3160.72 - 3163.60] for celery it's it's not just for celery
[3162.96 - 3165.76] it's for
[3163.60 - 3167.36] everything not recommended for any other
[3165.76 - 3169.20] fruits but actually it is
[3167.36 - 3170.56] am i understanding this right no beverly
[3169.20 - 3172.56] i'm glad you asked it's a really good
[3170.56 - 3174.48] question no it's a juicer for everything
[3172.56 - 3176.00] it just has a celery juice attachment
[3174.48 - 3177.68] and you can use that attachment and
[3176.00 - 3179.36] still juice everything and squeeze a lot
[3177.68 - 3181.12] more out of everything
[3179.36 - 3183.44] be open heart it says i needed this
[3181.12 - 3184.88] today thank you awb open art good to see
[3183.44 - 3187.12] you i saw your comments and
[3184.88 - 3188.48] uh on the youtube that you the last
[3187.12 - 3189.92] youtube i think it's the last one

[3224.48 - 3228.16] every time i remember the ginger he told
[3226.56 - 3228.64] me the ginge like the ginger flew off
[3228.16 - 3230.16] the counter

[3230.16 - 3233.92] somewhere it's hilarious you know and
[3232.40 - 3235.36] then i try to pick up the pace
[3233.92 - 3236.96] at the beginning this youtube my phone

[3244.88 - 3251.04] amazing medical doctor right there
[3247.60 - 3252.88] incredible really is um so
[3251.04 - 3254.16] because i mean really we can't go by
[3252.88 - 3256.08] that
[3254.16 - 3258.48] mishi madness that's a cool handle
[3256.08 - 3262.16] celery juice is a game changer it really
[3258.48 - 3262.16] is it's such a game changer it really is
[3262.24 - 3267.68] having some right now um
[3265.28 - 3269.68] so okay so the whole thing what do you
[3267.68 - 3271.20] want to do with your fiber
[3269.68 - 3272.72] it's not going to break down anyway in
[3271.20 - 3273.92] your gut okay
[3272.72 - 3275.28] you're going to get plenty of fiber
[3273.92 - 3276.40] anyway i'm not telling you to live off
[3275.28 - 3278.08] juice only
[3276.40 - 3279.92] you're going to eat and you're going to
[3278.08 - 3281.12] get tons of fiber your berries your
[3279.92 - 3283.36] apples your melons
[3281.12 - 3285.04] your your grapefruits anything you eat
[3283.36 - 3287.20] right any vegetable you eat
[3285.04 - 3288.88] cucumbers that's a fruit tomatoes that's
[3287.20 - 3290.16] a fruit right zucchini
[3288.88 - 3292.00] you know that's a fruit hey i'm hitting
[3290.16 - 3292.56] all the fruits right now but vegetables
[3292.00 - 3295.36] like the
[3292.56 - 3296.40] crucifix cruciferous right you got your
[3295.36 - 3297.92] kale you got your
[3296.40 - 3299.84] broccoli you got your cauliflower you
[3297.92 - 3300.16] got your cabbage right all that fiber is
[3299.84 - 3301.68] just
[3300.16 - 3304.84] gonna come out of you right you're gonna
[3301.68 - 3307.44] get plenty of fiber plenty of fiber
[3304.84 - 3308.96] so so when someone says oh you're you
[3307.44 - 3311.28] know you're juicing the celery
[3308.96 - 3312.88] what a waste it's like okay well that's
[3311.28 - 3315.60] really funny because
[3312.88 - 3317.44] we're going to poop out all the stuff
[3315.60 - 3319.04] we're not going to use and it's going
[3317.44 - 3320.72] down in the toilet at least with this i
[3319.04 - 3323.44] could throw it in my garden
[3320.72 - 3323.44] some you know
[3323.84 - 3328.08] but anyway it the whole thing about
[3326.72 - 3331.84] let's talk about this part too
[3328.08 - 3334.24] right so um so as far as
[3331.84 - 3337.60] intestinal tract goes let me grab an
[3334.24 - 3337.60] intestinal tract really quick
[3339.44 - 3344.00] i'm going to grab a liver too i'm going
[3341.44 - 3344.00] to show you guys
[3345.20 - 3350.80] all right so what i like to do is i like
[3349.20 - 3352.16] to think about what the celery juice is
[3350.80 - 3352.64] doing when it's going through my gut the
[3352.16 - 3354.16] beginning
[3352.64 - 3355.44] to begin with when it starts at the
[3354.16 - 3356.72] stomach which i don't have a stomach
[3355.44 - 3359.92] right now but that's okay
[3356.72 - 3362.32] meaning i don't have a stomach here but
[3359.92 - 3364.00] what it does is it already charges up
[3362.32 - 3365.68] those stomach glands
[3364.00 - 3367.28] it's bringing back the stomach gland so
[3365.68 - 3369.28] the trace mineral salts the sodium
[3367.28 - 3370.88] cluster salts are bringing back
[3369.28 - 3372.56] the the stomach glands it's the one
[3370.88 - 3374.40] thing right there off you know
[3372.56 - 3375.60] right off the start with your stomach
[3374.40 - 3376.72] when it leaves your stomach starts
[3375.60 - 3379.36] heading down into the
[3376.72 - 3380.96] the duodenum right and when it heads
[3379.36 - 3382.08] down to your wad a lot of people have h
[3380.96 - 3383.52] pylori
[3382.08 - 3385.60] you don't know it but just almost
[3383.52 - 3388.80] everybody has h pylori
[3385.60 - 3390.24] and and they'll have the h pylori at
[3388.80 - 3390.80] different levels some people have it
[3390.24 - 3393.60] where they ca
[3390.80 - 3395.28] it can't be detected it's not at this
[3393.60 - 3396.96] raging level
[3395.28 - 3398.56] so and that's what most people have at
[3396.96 - 3400.00] but it's there so as it starts heading
[3398.56 - 3402.32] down to the duodenum it's
[3400.00 - 3404.72] knocking down some h pylori left and
[3402.32 - 3406.72] right so the celery juice
[3404.72 - 3408.16] is going through and just boom right
[3406.72 - 3410.24] then it hits
[3408.16 - 3411.76] the the top of your small intestinal
[3410.24 - 3413.60] tract okay
[3411.76 - 3414.80] where there's always some bacteria
[3413.60 - 3416.16] sitting right there all on its own
[3414.80 - 3419.00] sometimes viruses too
[3416.16 - 3420.48] viruses and bacteria right some some
[3419.00 - 3424.24] unproductive
[3420.48 - 3426.96] fungus bad fungus right fungus
[3424.24 - 3427.36] mold right and even though mold doesn't
[3426.96 - 3429.04] cause
[3427.36 - 3430.72] a big problem when it's in us the
[3429.04 - 3431.20] viruses and bacteria cause the most
[3430.72 - 3433.36] problem
[3431.20 - 3434.32] you'll still have some mold in there why
[3433.36 - 3435.84] have that in there
[3434.32 - 3437.92] everybody has it in there but celery
[3435.84 - 3439.12] juice can start to clean that up
[3437.92 - 3440.56] so it starts to go down to small
[3439.12 - 3442.24] intestinal tract and now it's heading
[3440.56 - 3444.64] down and it's hitting different pockets
[3442.24 - 3445.52] what happens with everybody is our small
[3444.64 - 3449.52] intestinal tract
[3445.52 - 3450.40] is pocketing it's it's expanding in some
[3449.52 - 3452.80] areas
[3450.40 - 3453.76] shrinking in some areas expanding in
[3452.80 - 3456.80] some areas
[3453.76 - 3460.48] shrinking in some areas right or it's
[3456.80 - 3463.36] the same size but internally
[3460.48 - 3464.80] it's shrinking because it's inflamed
[3463.36 - 3466.64] that's the other thing too
[3464.80 - 3468.16] you could have narrowing some people
[3466.64 - 3469.44] have a lot of narrowing some people have
[3468.16 - 3470.88] a little bit of neurons some people have
[3469.44 - 3474.56] expansion some people have
[3470.88 - 3476.16] mega colon colon
[3474.56 - 3478.40] and that's with you know the large
[3476.16 - 3479.12] intestinal tract mostly with mega colon
[3478.40 - 3480.96] right
[3479.12 - 3483.68] where it just keeps on it keeps on
[3480.96 - 3485.68] expanding it loses its elasticity it's
[3483.68 - 3488.40] losing that it's starting to expand
[3485.68 - 3490.44] right diverticulitis but diverticulitis
[3488.40 - 3493.92] is all that e coli
[3490.44 - 3495.76] streptococcus right c death
[3493.92 - 3498.24] and mostly strep and e coli with
[3495.76 - 3500.32] diverticulitis right diverticulosis
[3498.24 - 3501.44] so as the celery is going down it's got
[3500.32 - 3503.60] a lot of work to do
[3501.44 - 3505.60] it's heading on down and it's starting
[3503.60 - 3506.72] to just get into those pockets and nooks
[3505.60 - 3507.76] and crannies right
[3506.72 - 3509.20] you know what happens when you guys
[3507.76 - 3510.64] vacuum your house what are you doing
[3509.20 - 3512.00] you're like vacuuming in the bathroom
[3510.64 - 3514.08] then you vacuum in the corner and
[3512.00 - 3515.04] vacuum here you're vacuuming this corner
[3514.08 - 3516.00] and trying to get all the different
[3515.04 - 3517.60] corners right
[3516.00 - 3519.28] the celery juice is trying to hit every
[3517.60 - 3520.48] corner as it's going on down and running
[3519.28 - 3522.72] on through you
[3520.48 - 3523.60] and and that's what's happening you guys
[3522.72 - 3525.60] and it's
[3523.60 - 3528.16] it'll run into a pocket of e coal like e
[3525.60 - 3530.72] coli festers these little pockets
[3528.16 - 3532.96] they fester and here's the other thing
[3530.72 - 3536.72] inside your small intestinal tract right
[3532.96 - 3540.00] you got you got caked caked on
[3536.72 - 3541.12] um um putrified proteins
[3540.00 - 3543.60] they're kicked down the walls of your
[3541.12 - 3546.72] small intestinal tract you got rancid
[3543.60 - 3549.12] fat that hardened you got actual
[3546.72 - 3550.72] fat that hardened all in the small
[3549.12 - 3552.48] intestinal tract right i've talked to a
[3550.72 - 3553.60] lot of colon surgeons over the years
[3552.48 - 3554.72] intestinal surgeons you know
[3553.60 - 3556.72] gastrointestinal
[3554.72 - 3558.16] surgeries that that people have had that
[3556.72 - 3561.44] i would talk to the surgeons
[3558.16 - 3564.80] and and so forth right and and
[3561.44 - 3566.32] they would talk about how the inside of
[3564.80 - 3568.56] the intestinal tract when they really
[3566.32 - 3572.24] took a good look the inside
[3568.56 - 3574.08] from the eye not from the scope
[3572.24 - 3575.68] the eye sees things that the scope can't
[3574.08 - 3576.88] see and the scope sees things that the
[3575.68 - 3579.84] eye can't see
[3576.88 - 3581.84] the scope sees things when your
[3579.84 - 3582.40] intestinal tract is sitting inside of
[3581.84 - 3584.64] you
[3582.40 - 3586.32] right so the scope goes up you right you
[3584.64 - 3589.12] know you know endoscopy
[3586.32 - 3589.68] colonoscopy right but what happens is
[3589.12 - 3592.24] that
[3589.68 - 3594.00] from the surgeon's eye is a whole other
[3592.24 - 3596.08] story when they have a piece of small
[3594.00 - 3598.56] intestinal tract that they cut out
[3596.08 - 3600.32] so they cut out two feet of your colon
[3598.56 - 3601.92] or small intestinal tract combined or
[3600.32 - 3603.28] they cut your ilium out and part of your
[3601.92 - 3605.12] small intestinal tract and part of your
[3603.28 - 3609.04] colon out right
[3605.12 - 3611.36] and they slice it open and look inside
[3609.04 - 3612.72] a good gastrointestinal surgeon right a
[3611.36 - 3616.08] good surgeon
[3612.72 - 3617.84] colon surgeon will see you know things
[3616.08 - 3620.48] differently in a lot of people and a lot
[3617.84 - 3622.48] of times the higher you go up
[3620.48 - 3624.80] into the small intestinal tract the more
[3622.48 - 3628.48] caked on rancid fats built up in the
[3624.80 - 3631.12] testosterone lining the more um the more
[3628.48 - 3631.68] uh putrified proteins hardened on the
[3631.12 - 3635.12] lining
[3631.68 - 3637.44] up higher right celery juice starts to
[3635.12 - 3639.76] work all the way down right the top
[3637.44 - 3642.00] the the bottom of your stomach there's a
[3639.76 - 3644.88] little divot that starts to occur
[3642.00 - 3645.76] and sitting in it is all this junk and
[3644.88 - 3648.08] sludge
[3645.76 - 3649.68] celery just starts to knock that down it
[3648.08 - 3652.08] gets down your dwadding starts to knock
[3649.68 - 3653.60] off each pylori boom boom boom
[3652.08 - 3656.16] starts to get down the small intestinal
[3653.60 - 3658.24] tract starts to hit pockets of e coli
[3656.16 - 3660.40] streptococcus starts to go through there
[3658.24 - 3662.72] heading on down head down down
[3660.40 - 3664.24] it's it's wham it's hitting things and
[3662.72 - 3667.60] then
[3664.24 - 3670.16] it gets absorbed and starts heading up
[3667.60 - 3673.36] the hepatic portal highway
[3670.16 - 3676.72] veins and that are
[3673.36 - 3680.24] driving up to your
[3676.72 - 3682.16] liver right okay and you know veins
[3680.24 - 3683.76] arteries that are running in and out of
[3682.16 - 3684.96] the liver right so all of a sudden now
[3683.76 - 3686.08] you've got it going up the paddock
[3684.96 - 3687.12] portal highway
[3686.08 - 3688.56] heading to the liver and that's where
[3687.12 - 3689.12] the solar just has to go and when it
[3688.56 - 3691.52] goes there
[3689.12 - 3693.20] we do some shock treatment you got a
[3691.52 - 3693.92] liver full of all kinds of poisons and
[3693.20 - 3695.52] toxins
[3693.92 - 3697.04] stagnant sluggish liver giving you
[3695.52 - 3698.40] gaining weight the reason why you're
[3697.04 - 3700.24] gaining weight
[3698.40 - 3701.76] all of it why does celery juice start
[3700.24 - 3703.92] fixing things where we start losing
[3701.76 - 3705.44] weight start getting our lives back
[3703.92 - 3706.88] because it's getting into that liver
[3705.44 - 3709.12] it's cleaning up that stagnant sluggish
[3706.88 - 3710.80] liver you got viruses inside that liver
[3709.12 - 3711.36] right here you got viruses inside that
[3710.80 - 3714.56] liver
[3711.36 - 3716.72] you know and all of a sudden boom
[3714.56 - 3718.16] the celery juice is hitting it so this
[3716.72 - 3720.16] is this isn't
[3718.16 - 3721.36] be open-hearted you said best medical
[3720.16 - 3722.72] medium community
[3721.36 - 3726.32] medical mean community is the best
[3722.72 - 3728.64] community ever in health uh
[3726.32 - 3730.72] raquel jane i've been doing it for two
[3728.64 - 3734.56] years doesn't help me at all
[3730.72 - 3736.80] have lime now mold h by laurie sibo i
[3734.56 - 3740.08] was praying it worked it would help
[3736.80 - 3743.52] um so here's what you have to think
[3740.08 - 3745.12] about what would happen if you weren't
[3743.52 - 3745.84] doing celery juice for the last two
[3745.12 - 3748.72] years
[3745.84 - 3749.68] with your h pylori and everything else
[3748.72 - 3753.28] would it be
[3749.68 - 3754.64] the same or do you think it would be
[3753.28 - 3758.08] worse
[3754.64 - 3759.44] so and what else is happening so
[3758.08 - 3761.28] i want you to do everything your doctor
[3759.44 - 3764.16] tells you to do but if i
[3761.28 - 3765.44] was doing that i'd be like well what

[3807.96 - 3814.08] antibiotics for my lime
[3810.72 - 3816.56] was i mean all these things add up right
[3814.08 - 3819.12] so was i on antibiotics for my lime two
[3816.56 - 3821.60] years ago three years ago four years ago
[3819.12 - 3824.08] how much damage did the antibiotic do
[3821.60 - 3827.28] how much repair do i really have to do
[3824.08 - 3830.24] am i doing a lime protocol
[3827.28 - 3832.88] right so that's the next thing too am i
[3830.24 - 3834.24] exposed to other things am i exposed to
[3832.88 - 3835.92] clones and perfumes
[3834.24 - 3838.08] does somebody i live with have a lot of
[3835.92 - 3839.84] cologne going on maybe they don't am i
[3838.08 - 3841.04] doing scented candles am i doing air
[3839.84 - 3842.72] fresheners right
[3841.04 - 3844.80] am i doing this so i'm giving you the
[3842.72 - 3847.36] run down right here am i getting
[3844.80 - 3849.44] dental work and i'm getting my immune
[3847.36 - 3851.28] system knocked down with dental work did
[3849.44 - 3853.92] i get hit with some fluoride
[3851.28 - 3854.32] fluoride treatments right so all these
[3853.92 - 3856.32] things
[3854.32 - 3858.32] matter like what else am i eating am i
[3856.32 - 3860.48] still eating tuna fish
[3858.32 - 3862.72] what what else is going on am i still
[3860.48 - 3864.08] using deodorant with aluminum in it
[3862.72 - 3866.96] right
[3864.08 - 3868.40] so all these things matter and or am i
[3866.96 - 3870.56] just doing celery juice
[3868.40 - 3871.52] have i looked in the lime chapter so if
[3870.56 - 3873.44] that was me
[3871.52 - 3875.28] i'd be in the lyme disease chapter right
[3873.44 - 3877.76] here and i would be looking at like
[3875.28 - 3880.16] the lyme protocol take it to your doctor
[3877.76 - 3881.68] if it's you take it to your doctor
[3880.16 - 3883.36] do what your doctor tells you but take
[3881.68 - 3885.12] it to your doctor see what he thinks
[3883.36 - 3886.96] but what i would be doing is the medical
[3885.12 - 3888.08] medium protocols i'd start to read the
[3886.96 - 3890.16] supplement chapter
[3888.08 - 3891.44] learning what's happening in here that's
[3890.16 - 3893.68] important what kind of
[3891.44 - 3895.84] supplements are you taking right like
[3893.68 - 3898.48] what kind what kind of supplements
[3895.84 - 3900.32] now for i want you to do what your
[3898.48 - 3902.16] doctor says but what i recommend a
[3900.32 - 3903.20] family member when when they get lyme
[3902.16 - 3905.44] disease right
[3903.20 - 3906.88] i recommend like the vimergy cats claw
[3905.44 - 3908.96] the vimersy zinc
[3906.88 - 3910.32] the vimergy vitamin c these are just a
[3908.96 - 3912.32] few things right there
[3910.32 - 3914.32] so that's a critical aspect all on its
[3912.32 - 3917.36] own the vimergy lysine
[3914.32 - 3919.52] no msg no alcohol no added
[3917.36 - 3921.68] no added natural flavors which is the
[3919.52 - 3926.16] msg that's important too
[3921.68 - 3929.36] am i taking goldenseal for my h pylori
[3926.16 - 3931.36] see so if it was me or a family member
[3929.36 - 3933.20] i'd be like you got to be on the golden
[3931.36 - 3935.52] seal and you got to be on the right one
[3933.20 - 3936.80] you got to be on some cat's claw don't
[3935.52 - 3938.80] do what i what i'm
[3936.80 - 3940.56] what i recommend for a family member you
[3938.80 - 3941.84] do what your doctor tells you to do but
[3940.56 - 3944.16] this is what i would do
[3941.84 - 3945.44] with my family i'd be like are you on
[3944.16 - 3947.36] the golden seal
[3945.44 - 3949.12] you know are you on the micro sea are
[3947.36 - 3951.60] you on the cat's claw because that lyme
[3949.12 - 3953.36] disease we gotta get to that epstein bar
[3951.60 - 3954.48] we gotta get to the cause of what you're
[3953.36 - 3956.32] really going through
[3954.48 - 3957.84] and then what kind of how much celery
[3956.32 - 3959.84] juice are you doing i tell my family
[3957.84 - 3960.32] member are you doing 32 ounces of celery
[3959.84 - 3962.88] juice
[3960.32 - 3964.40] what is it you're doing 32 ounces so
[3962.88 - 3965.52] that's another thing all in its own
[3964.40 - 3967.76] right
[3965.52 - 3969.36] and then you know i would be another
[3967.76 - 3970.24] thing i would learn from medical medium
[3969.36 - 3972.00] information
[3970.24 - 3973.76] lyme disease then i would say wait a
[3972.00 - 3975.44] minute that's neurological
[3973.76 - 3978.40] so a lot of neurological symptoms with
[3975.44 - 3980.96] lyme disease how much b12
[3978.40 - 3983.36] am i do i need how much b12 should i be
[3980.96 - 3983.92] on am i doing the right b12 the right
[3983.36 - 3985.36] kind
[3983.92 - 3987.60] that's the vimergy so you guys know
[3985.36 - 3988.24] bemidji it's v is in victor i am as mary
[3987.60 - 3992.56] e r g
[3988.24 - 3995.76] y uh bemergee.com and i'm not sponsored
[3992.56 - 3999.12] but if there's lots of traps out there
[3995.76 - 4000.64] so what are the traps what's going on
[3999.12 - 4002.72] right there's a lot of different
[4000.64 - 4003.92] supplements out there with msg and
[4002.72 - 4007.36] alcohol
[4003.92 - 4010.08] and casey of gum and citric acid what
[4007.36 - 4011.84] would you know what's going on like and
[4010.08 - 4013.28] i would be my own detective and saying
[4011.84 - 4014.00] you know i need to look into the medical
[4013.28 - 4015.52] media books
[4014.00 - 4017.04] i need to know where i'm stepping into
[4015.52 - 4018.72] those potholes i need to know where i'm
[4017.04 - 4021.36] tripping up i need to know
[4018.72 - 4022.96] why am i not getting better how many
[4021.36 - 4026.24] blood draws have i had
[4022.96 - 4027.20] now i know as is being in this in this
[4026.24 - 4028.88] for so many years
[4027.20 - 4030.56] that people with lyme disease have the
[4028.88 - 4033.20] blood sucked out of them
[4030.56 - 4034.56] they have the blood sucked out of them
[4033.20 - 4037.12] three years ago
[4034.56 - 4037.60] someone could be getting 40 vials 30
[4037.12 - 4040.08] vials
[4037.60 - 4041.20] 10 vials regularly and then they get
[4040.08 - 4044.40] sicker two years
[4041.20 - 4046.84] later because they've had so much blood
[4044.40 - 4049.92] taken from them before that
[4046.84 - 4051.20] so so it's not just hey celery just
[4049.92 - 4054.48] isn't working for me
[4051.20 - 4056.24] celery juice is trying to save save you
[4054.48 - 4058.88] while there's all these other things
[4056.24 - 4060.56] going on dr fong celery powder isn't
[4058.88 - 4062.24] effective at all oh it's terrible
[4060.56 - 4064.08] save your money on that real salary your
[4062.24 - 4066.72] celery powder is awful
[4064.08 - 4068.16] it's terrible terrible it's the worst
[4066.72 - 4071.12] worst stuff
[4068.16 - 4072.24] it's just this so all these things
[4071.12 - 4076.16] matter you guys
[4072.24 - 4079.12] all these things are critical
[4076.16 - 4081.12] esther what if someone doesn't want to
[4079.12 - 4082.48] do mono cleanse to give digestion a
[4081.12 - 4085.60] break
[4082.48 - 4087.60] can we do a juice cleanse all juices
[4085.60 - 4089.28] look i'm not a big fan of the juice
[4087.60 - 4090.32] cleanses because what happens is you go
[4089.28 - 4091.60] under calorie
[4090.32 - 4093.44] well do what your doctor says your
[4091.60 - 4095.52] doctor wants energy just let's do it
[4093.44 - 4096.80] but esther what happens is juice
[4095.52 - 4099.92] cleanses you go
[4096.80 - 4102.96] under calorie then you go under calorie
[4099.92 - 4104.96] too long right so i don't mind a juice
[4102.96 - 4106.64] cleanse for two days but is it a juice
[4104.96 - 4108.32] cleanse that that's actually like
[4106.64 - 4110.48] efficient enough is it does it have
[4108.32 - 4111.60] enough glucose the reason why people are
[4110.48 - 4113.28] sick is because
[4111.60 - 4114.72] they're missing the mineral salts and
[4113.28 - 4116.16] the glucose so when you go on these
[4114.72 - 4117.84] juice cleanses it doesn't mean it's the
[4116.16 - 4119.36] right even the right combinations it
[4117.84 - 4120.88] doesn't mean it's enough calories to
[4119.36 - 4124.24] give you the glucose and then
[4120.88 - 4126.16] you can tank right and in juice cleanses
[4124.24 - 4127.52] if they're not done right can lower your
[4126.16 - 4129.20] immune system
[4127.52 - 4130.84] versus help your immune system so keep
[4129.20 - 4134.16] that in mind too
[4130.84 - 4136.16] um but yeah incredible you guys i'm
