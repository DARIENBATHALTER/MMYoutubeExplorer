[381.16 - 385.88] really explodes into the lymphatic and
[383.68 - 388.08] everywhere else the lungs fill up with
[385.88 - 392.16] fluid you get the pneumonia you get the
[388.08 - 394.00] cough that's from also being burdened
[392.16 - 396.28] everybody's so burdened with all kinds

[652.84 - 657.68] guys do it you just eat a big big ass
[655.12 - 662.04] bowl of sugar in the morning no you

[666.96 - 673.08] one eats a freaking bowl of sugar in the
[670.00 - 677.28] morning but everybody acts like they are
[673.08 - 682.28] everybody talks like they are no one
[677.28 - 685.88] sits there eating a big stupid bowl of
[682.28 - 687.96] sugar every day they don't but that's
[685.88 - 690.12] how ridiculous the health movement has
[687.96 - 693.88] been that's how ridiculous ulous all the
[690.12 - 696.36] health whoever have been because no
[693.88 - 697.60] one's eating straight sugar you know why
[696.36 - 699.64] you know what they're doing I'll tell
[697.60 - 704.60] you why this is critical critical to
[699.64 - 706.36] know they're eating sugar
[704.60 - 710.60] with
[706.36 - 712.48] fat they're eating sugar with fat you
[710.60 - 714.84] see that right there what's on top of
[712.48 - 718.12] those pancakes right there you see that
[714.84 - 719.64] you see it's on top right they're eating
[718.12 - 724.44] sugar
[719.64 - 726.32] with fat combined combined that's where
[724.44 - 729.68] the problem is I've been watching the
[726.32 - 729.68] health movement
[729.80 - 736.24] literally re-engineer itself trying to
[733.52 - 739.20] figure it out for decades and they don't
[736.24 - 741.04] get it oh I quit sugar really what did
[739.20 - 743.44] you quit were you eating sugar all day
[741.04 - 745.40] long no I never eat sugar out of a bowl
[743.44 - 747.92] all day long then what are you talking

[761.60 - 770.12] of fat and milk egg fat butter fat
[767.12 - 772.92] whatever butter on top of those pancakes
[770.12 - 776.24] that's the whole point what you dial
[772.92 - 777.84] down was the fat that's what you dialed

[891.60 - 895.96] dude you're cutting down on the fat
[894.36 - 899.60] that's the reason why you're turning
[895.96 - 900.68] your life around a little bit that's how
[899.60 - 903.88] it
[900.68 - 906.00] works simple as that hold on I got a
[903.88 - 910.56] delivery delivery right here around the
[906.00 - 912.88] corner don't worry here right thank you
[910.56 - 915.68] yeah no no the tip the tip is right
[912.88 - 919.72] there yep thank you oh God I can't wait
[915.68 - 922.36] to eat this I'm actually hungry for this
[919.72 - 924.48] right here today because you know what
[922.36 - 926.20] you know the only thing is though is I
[924.48 - 928.72] better back down on this pizza you know
[926.20 - 930.56] why I need to back down on the sugar
[928.72 - 932.12] that's why I need it back down in the
[930.56 - 934.16] sugar
[932.12 - 937.40] no it's not
[934.16 - 940.08] sugar it's the fat in that pizza it's
[937.40 - 942.68] that pepperoni fat it's that cheese fat
[940.08 - 946.60] it's the oil fat that's been dumped on
[942.68 - 948.76] your pizza that is what the problem is
[946.60 - 952.32] that makes sugar evil that's what turns
[948.76 - 955.24] sugar into evil and people don't know it
[952.32 - 958.00] but that's it right there it's all the
[955.24 - 959.72] fat can't eat that pizza lots of carbs
[958.00 - 961.04] man I got to back down on my sugar I'm
[959.72 - 962.48] backing down on the pizza dude you're
[961.04 - 965.88] backing down on the
[962.48 - 969.08] fat that's the point because no one's
[965.88 - 972.56] just eating sugar no one is eating just
[969.08 - 974.76] sugar it's not happening on any level it
[972.56 - 976.04] does not happen if you're eating bowls
[974.76 - 977.64] and bowls of sugar in the morning then
[976.04 - 978.80] you're the only person on this planet
[977.64 - 983.92] doing
[978.80 - 986.32] it only person on this planet that's
[983.92 - 986.32] doing
[986.44 - 994.36] it if you're eating a big old bowl of
[988.96 - 998.84] sugar you're the only one on this entire
[994.36 - 1003.00] planet only one and even if some dude is
[998.84 - 1005.76] in a sugar cane field and he hacks a big
[1003.00 - 1008.68] stock of the fresh sugar cane and he
[1005.76 - 1011.88] presses it through a press and it juices
[1008.68 - 1016.28] the sugar cane into a big old
[1011.88 - 1019.76] Bowl guess what that's part sugar big
[1016.28 - 1022.64] part of all water Trace minerals
[1019.76 - 1026.56] nutrients phytochemical compounds the
[1022.64 - 1030.04] sugar is this much everything else is
[1026.56 - 1033.68] there the sugar is this much everything
[1030.04 - 1037.00] else is there in there you see no one
[1033.68 - 1039.44] eats straight sugar like that in the
[1037.00 - 1042.96] morning it doesn't exist but you sure as
[1039.44 - 1045.76] hell can think they do if I did not know
[1042.96 - 1048.96] anything if I came off of a
[1045.76 - 1052.40] spacecraft if I was abducted to 20 years
[1048.96 - 1053.56] ago by some alien race and I and they
[1052.40 - 1055.84] had me up there and they were
[1053.56 - 1058.28] experimenting on me and doing whatever
[1055.84 - 1061.80] and they decided to let me go 20 years
[1058.28 - 1063.88] later and drop my butt off and I was
[1061.80 - 1066.40] dropped off I didn't know nothing or 40
[1063.88 - 1068.24] years later didn't know nothing or I 50
[1066.40 - 1071.32] years whatever if they abducted me when
[1068.24 - 1073.00] I was 2 years old and dropped me off now
[1071.32 - 1074.80] I would think everybody was eating tons
[1073.00 - 1076.16] and tons of bowls and bowls of sugar I'd
[1074.80 - 1078.00] be on the internet like whoa this person
[1076.16 - 1079.64] quit carbs whoa this person quit sugar
[1078.00 - 1081.28] whoa this person's off their sugar I'd
[1079.64 - 1083.64] be like whoa what was everybody doing
[1081.28 - 1087.64] eating piles and piles of sugar and
[1083.64 - 1091.68] that's how ridiculous it is Brad says
[1087.64 - 1092.52] no carbs turn fat into
[1091.68 - 1094.60] [Music]
[1092.52 - 1100.32] [Laughter]
[1094.60 - 1105.16] evil fat turns carbs into
[1100.32 - 1107.72] evil yeah that's how it goes all right
[1105.16 - 1109.16] so what happens when you put fat and
[1107.72 - 1113.96] sugar together
[1109.16 - 1116.48] together when you put fat and sugar
[1113.96 - 1118.40] together you inhibit yourself from
[1116.48 - 1121.64] getting something so important which is
[1118.40 - 1124.88] the nutrients nutrients I'm taking this
[1121.64 - 1126.80] supplement I'm taking this powder I'm at
[1124.88 - 1129.36] my doctor's office he gave me this
[1126.80 - 1133.16] powder I'm taking this supplement I'm
[1129.36 - 1135.92] eating this oh I got a superfood here
[1133.16 - 1139.92] and guess what without sugar
[1135.92 - 1143.28] useless useless the sugar takes
[1139.92 - 1145.08] nutrients into your cells mm info right
[1143.28 - 1148.00] there have to say
[1145.08 - 1151.12] it I'm been screaming it published it
[1148.00 - 1154.08] you name it nutrients don't enter the
[1151.12 - 1156.60] cells unless you have sugar to take them
[1154.08 - 1160.36] in so the all those nutrients that we
[1156.60 - 1163.28] have vitamin B's Vit D this that you
[1160.36 - 1165.28] need nutrients to take it in all kinds
[1163.28 - 1167.60] of different anthocyanins antioxidants
[1165.28 - 1170.28] you need nut you need sugar to take the
[1167.60 - 1174.00] nutrients in you need that sugar to
[1170.28 - 1175.60] drive it in you want those nutrients in
[1174.00 - 1177.48] you want to get those nutrients to get
[1175.60 - 1178.80] into every cell you want them into your
[1177.48 - 1180.36] nerve cells you want them into your
[1178.80 - 1181.76] brain you want them into your liver you
[1180.36 - 1184.28] want them into your pancreas you want
[1181.76 - 1186.76] them into every aspect of your body but
[1184.28 - 1189.96] those phytochemical compounds those
[1186.76 - 1193.32] healing nutrients those polyols those
[1189.96 - 1197.44] anthocyanins all of it can't enter into
[1193.32 - 1199.24] a cell unless sugar takes it in so but
[1197.44 - 1202.32] everybody's and
[1199.24 - 1204.12] sugar and in the end all they do is
[1202.32 - 1206.04] because they don't know and haven't been
[1204.12 - 1209.36] taught they end up just binging on
[1206.04 - 1211.60] garbage that has fat and sugar because
[1209.36 - 1214.52] they end up starving themselves from
[1211.60 - 1216.84] carbs but their brain needs the sugar so
[1214.52 - 1218.68] they hold off the carbs and what happens
[1216.84 - 1221.40] is they get hungry and then next thing
[1218.68 - 1225.16] you know what they're eating guess
[1221.40 - 1227.48] what they're eating a chocolate bar
[1225.16 - 1229.44] that's what they're eating a nice
[1227.48 - 1231.16] chocolate bar bar this looks like a good
[1229.44 - 1234.08] chocolate bar this is a really good
[1231.16 - 1237.64] chocolate bar right here that's a good
[1234.08 - 1239.56] one then they become like slaves to
[1237.64 - 1243.16] Chocolate slaves
[1239.56 - 1246.12] to to caffeine slaves
[1243.16 - 1248.52] to that's what they become slaves to
[1246.12 - 1250.00] it's terrible and then they're high
[1248.52 - 1251.32] because they have to go to Chocolate
[1250.00 - 1253.44] every minute because they're hold
[1251.32 - 1256.36] withholding all these carbs they're
[1253.44 - 1259.04] withholding all these sugars but
[1256.36 - 1262.00] ooh what's chocolate
[1259.04 - 1263.96] what's a chocolate bar sugar sugar and
[1262.00 - 1265.72] fat combined once again sugar and fat
[1263.96 - 1268.28] combined and every time we have sugar
[1265.72 - 1270.08] and fat combined what you get is insulin
[1268.28 - 1274.80] resistance everybody's walking around
[1270.08 - 1278.00] with insulin resistance every single day
[1274.80 - 1280.32] they're walking around with insulin
[1278.00 - 1283.72] resistance that's what they're
[1280.32 - 1286.20] doing yeah you got it and their A1C gets
[1283.72 - 1288.28] driven up over time their A1C gets
[1286.20 - 1289.44] driven up they don't know what to eat
[1288.28 - 1291.40] they don't know what to do then they
[1289.44 - 1292.92] hold off away from carbs they stay away
[1291.40 - 1294.60] from fruit they stay away from
[1292.92 - 1297.64] everything they're scared to eat
[1294.60 - 1300.88] anything and then then they end up
[1297.64 - 1302.84] binging cheat days cheat days to make up
[1300.88 - 1304.20] for the loss of carbs cheat days to make
[1302.84 - 1307.00] up for the loss of
[1304.20 - 1310.20] sugar and then those sheat days end up
[1307.00 - 1313.64] being fat and sugar combined back to the
[1310.20 - 1315.92] evil back to sugar and fat
[1313.64 - 1318.40] combined and you see it out there all
[1315.92 - 1321.28] the time it's unbelievable so called
[1318.40 - 1323.32] glucose experts now influencers seem to
[1321.28 - 1325.48] know a lot about glucose influencers
[1323.32 - 1327.72] seem to know a lot about type 2
[1325.48 - 1328.96] diabetes but they don't they'll sit
[1327.72 - 1332.28] there and be like what you need to have
[1328.96 - 1334.76] your nuts with um your Apple you need to
[1332.28 - 1335.96] have a you need to have this with this
[1334.76 - 1338.60] and it's like dude you're just making
[1335.96 - 1340.84] insulin resistance for the person I go
[1338.60 - 1343.56] we got a food plan you can buy buy our
[1340.84 - 1344.80] $300 food plan and you'll learn when to
[1343.56 - 1347.20] eat something and when not to eat
[1344.80 - 1348.76] something when you look at that I look
[1347.20 - 1350.32] at that stuff I look at that stuff now
[1348.76 - 1352.44] and I'm like oh dude you just made an
[1350.32 - 1353.68] insulin resistance bomb for that person
[1352.44 - 1355.52] that person in two years is going to
[1353.68 - 1356.88] have hypoglycemia hyperglycemia they're
[1355.52 - 1359.12] going to be all over the map and they
[1356.88 - 1361.44] just paid for your your useless $300
[1359.12 - 1363.12] program and they're not going to know if
[1361.44 - 1364.28] they're coming or going in a year or six
[1363.12 - 1367.36] months they're just going to be all over
[1364.28 - 1369.84] the food map like what is going on it's
[1367.36 - 1373.28] crazy out there what's
[1369.84 - 1375.40] happening what I recommend from s so is
[1373.28 - 1377.24] you don't have fat in the morning if you
[1375.40 - 1379.52] can help it if you're going to eat fat
[1377.24 - 1382.00] during the day some sometime so be it I
[1379.52 - 1384.44] can't control you I can't stop you you
[1382.00 - 1387.00] got your own free will I can't just
[1384.44 - 1391.72] whoop show up at your door and be like
[1387.00 - 1393.40] whoa what did you just eat I can't but I
[1391.72 - 1395.80] get it life is hard we eat all kinds of
[1393.40 - 1398.04] different stuff the point is is that
[1395.80 - 1400.48] people are just stuck on in a place
[1398.04 - 1402.36] where they're boo chasing their tail
[1400.48 - 1404.68] tail and they got the insulin resistance
[1402.36 - 1406.84] bodybuilders have to bulk and cut did
[1404.68 - 1409.04] you know that they bulk and cut and did
[1406.84 - 1412.00] you know something else

[1506.60 - 1511.52] a chump that follows a chump that
[1509.76 - 1513.28] follows a chump and they all go down in
[1511.52 - 1515.40] the pit of death together in the
[1513.28 - 1518.36] end and in the end it doesn't even
[1515.40 - 1519.52] matter cuz who the hell cares because
[1518.36 - 1522.76] we're all going to
[1519.52 - 1524.24] die what you're going to live to be 180

[1541.68 - 1546.64] the pit of death together in the end no
[1544.28 - 1546.64] matter
[1547.72 - 1552.36] what whatever all
[1555.32 - 1559.48] right that's what you do when you have

[1559.48 - 1564.68] live I try not to have celery Force
[1562.12 - 1564.68] before I go

[1572.36 - 1577.36] food I got to cook you name it but let's
[1575.80 - 1578.76] talk about white lung a little bit we
[1577.36 - 1580.48] talked about insulin resistance we
[1578.76 - 1585.00] talked about nutrients getting into
[1580.48 - 1588.16] cells you need the sugar to get it into
[1585.00 - 1591.88] cells brain cells need sugar
[1588.16 - 1594.32] they do brain cells need sugar your
[1591.88 - 1599.64] brain right it's upside
[1594.32 - 1603.12] down your brain needs sugar critical to
[1599.64 - 1606.28] keep it alive it dies without
[1603.12 - 1607.92] sugar it needs it glucose without
[1606.28 - 1610.68] glucose going to the brain cells they
[1607.92 - 1613.16] die quickly neurons nerve cells
[1610.68 - 1614.76] neurotransmitter chemicals won't work
[1613.16 - 1617.64] yes you need trace minerals that's why I
[1614.76 - 1619.92] love the celery juice boom yes you need
[1617.64 - 1622.60] need oxygen that's why we breathe and we
[1619.92 - 1624.48] get oxygen but if you don't have the
[1622.60 - 1627.80] sugar that oxygen those trace minerals
[1624.48 - 1630.20] aren't going to get you far it has to be
[1627.80 - 1633.36] sugar which is glucose combined with
[1630.20 - 1634.88] those trace minerals boom medical medium
[1633.36 - 1637.76] information in the books the trace
[1634.88 - 1640.56] minerals the electrolytes with the
[1637.76 - 1642.96] sugar it's that combination that brings
[1640.56 - 1645.52] our brain to life and then if you want
[1642.96 - 1647.60] to get metals and junk and garbage out
[1645.52 - 1649.44] of the brain that's inhibiting creating
[1647.60 - 1651.04] OCD and bipolar and depression anxiety
[1649.44 - 1654.56] and all these problems you want to get
[1651.04 - 1657.52] those medals out then you need the tools

[1743.56 - 1748.24] combined with electrolytes and all that
[1745.36 - 1750.84] Dr fwn good to see you breast Dr fwn
[1748.24 - 1752.96] breast milk is mostly sugar that's why
[1750.84 - 1755.96] it's so sweet and is the best food for
[1752.96 - 1758.88] de developing human brains breast milk
[1755.96 - 1763.76] isn't made out of corn
[1758.88 - 1769.44] oil corn oil and soy oil breast milk
[1763.76 - 1771.72] isn't made out of GMO so soy and corn
[1769.44 - 1773.80] like the formula the baby formula I'm
[1771.72 - 1776.36] not harping on the baby formula if
[1773.80 - 1778.08] that's all you got if you're a mommy you
[1776.36 - 1779.96] can't breastfeed and you're in a
[1778.08 - 1782.56] situation where you don't know how to
[1779.96 - 1783.88] make your own breast milk no one taught
[1782.56 - 1785.24] you how to make like right the medical
[1783.88 - 1787.92] me and breast milk which is an
[1785.24 - 1789.52] incredible option for women that can't
[1787.92 - 1790.96] breastfeed if you haven't learned and
[1789.52 - 1794.52] you don't know about
[1790.96 - 1797.80] it and you see you got to use a can of
[1794.52 - 1803.04] baby formula and that formula is nothing
[1797.80 - 1805.00] but GMO corn GMO soy I understand but
[1803.04 - 1808.04] our breast milk isn't made out of that
[1805.00 - 1811.88] it's not made out of whey protein powder
[1808.04 - 1815.36] mixed with corn oil corn syrup corn
[1811.88 - 1818.60] sugar and soy oil that's not our breast
[1815.36 - 1821.28] milk our breast milk is made out of
[1818.60 - 1825.04] glucose from anywhere it can possibly
[1821.28 - 1827.92] your body can possibly get it from and
[1825.04 - 1831.24] then a small amount of protein and small
[1827.92 - 1832.76] a hyper small amount of fat a hyper
[1831.24 - 1836.08] small amount of
[1832.76 - 1839.64] fat breast milk isn't all this fat
[1836.08 - 1843.80] breast milk isn't butter in all this oil
[1839.64 - 1845.60] and all this grease breast milk isn't
[1843.80 - 1849.36] that it
[1845.60 - 1851.40] is primarily sugar and water and
[1849.36 - 1852.80] minerals women who don't get enough
[1851.40 - 1855.32] glucose they'll have trouble making
[1852.80 - 1857.68] breast milk for their
[1855.32 - 1859.44] babies I've helped people one one-onone
[1857.68 - 1861.64] for so many years you guys so many
[1859.44 - 1864.36] different people over the
[1861.64 - 1866.56] years and their breast milk would
[1864.36 - 1868.40] dwindle down no matter what they they'd
[1866.56 - 1869.84] be eating cheeseburgers they'd be eating
[1868.40 - 1872.72] whatever eggs and their breast milk
[1869.84 - 1874.44] would actually lessen and become weak
[1872.72 - 1875.88] with with a lot of women not all women
[1874.44 - 1877.28] but a lot of women won't have that
[1875.88 - 1879.40] glucose storage
[1877.28 - 1880.40] inside and so they're eating all these
[1879.40 - 1883.64] things and they're they're getting
[1880.40 - 1885.32] enough carbs but something's wrong and
[1883.64 - 1887.28] then you have to switch gears you got to
[1885.32 - 1889.20] remove the fats you got to get the fats
[1887.28 - 1892.40] down and then the breast milk gets all
[1889.20 - 1895.48] juicy and it starts to fill when there's
[1892.40 - 1898.12] enough carbohydrate and a little less
[1895.48 - 1900.84] fat it's critical for bringing breast
[1898.12 - 1904.16] milk back I didn't know I'd be talking
[1900.84 - 1906.64] about breast milk today thank you Dr
[1904.16 - 1908.24] Fawn for um putting that out there a
[1906.64 - 1909.72] good place to start is medical medium
[1908.24 - 1912.36] morning
[1909.72 - 1915.20] cleanse medical medium morning cleanse
[1912.36 - 1917.20] is a great place to start you can just
[1915.20 - 1919.56] start here cleanse the heel if you want
[1917.20 - 1922.64] want the medical me morning cleanse
[1919.56 - 1924.84] helps to clean up the liver helps to
[1922.64 - 1928.00] cleanse the liver helps to move it
[1924.84 - 1930.52] forward it's one thing on its own all
[1928.00 - 1932.68] right so let's move into white
[1930.52 - 1935.24] lung
[1932.68 - 1941.12] so
[1935.24 - 1943.80] look I'm just saying right that if I
[1941.12 - 1948.20] caught the mystery
[1943.80 - 1951.04] pneumonia that if I caught it
[1948.20 - 1953.68] I'll tell you what would not be in my
[1951.04 - 1956.84] diet I would not be eating
[1953.68 - 1959.92] eggs I would not be eating cheese I
[1956.84 - 1963.60] would not be eating milk I would not be
[1959.92 - 1966.24] eating those there's no way I would be
[1963.60 - 1968.48] eating those when there is something
[1966.24 - 1970.76] going around that's going around like it
[1968.48 - 1971.80] is right I would not be cracking the
[1970.76 - 1974.04] eggs
[1971.80 - 1977.56] open I would make eggs for a family
[1974.04 - 1980.08] member for a friend if they came over I
[1977.56 - 1982.96] would go and get some
[1980.08 - 1985.88] eggs if I had a guest that liked
[1982.96 - 1990.48] scrambled eggs and I would literally the
[1985.88 - 1993.36] medical medium okay has many times many
[1990.48 - 1996.92] times a guest coming over a family
[1993.36 - 2000.08] friend coming over medical medium has
[1996.92 - 2003.36] many times went out got the
[2000.08 - 2005.76] eggs got the eggs out cracked open the
[2003.36 - 2008.04] eggs medical medium didn't make them do
[2005.76 - 2010.56] celery juice and make them do the heavy
[2008.04 - 2013.04] metal detox smoothie and make them do
[2010.56 - 2015.28] the spinach soup and the healing broth
[2013.04 - 2016.80] no I got some eggs I cracked them open
[2015.28 - 2018.64] cooked them right in my pan right in the
[2016.80 - 2021.04] kitchen and fed everybody the best
[2018.64 - 2023.60] scrambled eggs you ever ever could
[2021.04 - 2025.12] eat the best stuff you could ever eat
[2023.60 - 2028.00] the best scrambled eggs you could ever
[2025.12 - 2032.52] eat it doesn't change the fact that the
[2028.00 - 2038.96] eggs are how the white lung pneumonia is
[2032.52 - 2038.96] even here is even here
[2040.00 - 2047.08] so the white lung
[2044.20 - 2050.16] pneumonia pathogen they're not calling
[2047.08 - 2052.32] it viral but it's viral it's
[2050.16 - 2054.20] viral they'll call it micoplasma
[2052.32 - 2057.28] bacteria but it's
[2054.20 - 2061.24] viral the white lung pneumonia that's
[2057.28 - 2063.88] here now was
[2061.24 - 2067.56] raised in
[2063.88 - 2070.72] those was raised in those and labs and
[2067.56 - 2074.20] then somehow got
[2070.72 - 2076.64] out that's why whether egg people and
[2074.20 - 2079.40] trainers and all the anti and all the
[2076.64 - 2080.80] dieticians on Tik Tok and anybody else
[2079.40 - 2082.44] who's talking to anybody else that's a
[2080.80 - 2085.56] hater of medical medium sitting there
[2082.44 - 2087.96] screaming about eggs and how I'm wrong
[2085.56 - 2090.48] and those morons don't realize that
[2087.96 - 2093.00] that's how these bugs got even here
[2090.48 - 2094.84] because what classified medical research
[2093.00 - 2096.20] and science did was they just opened up
[2094.84 - 2098.16] the top of the egg and they put the
[2096.20 - 2101.08] pathogens in and procreated them and
[2098.16 - 2102.00] that's how they make them that's why C
[2101.08 - 2105.20] is
[2102.00 - 2107.16] here that's why pneumonia that's why the
[2105.20 - 2108.88] flu that's why whatever colds are still
[2107.16 - 2110.44] around that you think are still around
[2108.88 - 2111.92] that's why anything and everything is
[2110.44 - 2112.92] still here that's why your herpes
[2111.92 - 2115.80] simplex
[2112.92 - 2119.00] one is even here to begin
[2115.80 - 2121.24] with that's why your epscene bar is even
[2119.00 - 2123.40] here to begin with it was raised in labs
[2121.24 - 2127.16] in eggs so what I'm trying to tell you
[2123.40 - 2129.92] is first thing I would do I would get
[2127.16 - 2131.52] the info know what I'm doing I would get
[2129.92 - 2134.52] the protocols take it to your doctor if
[2131.52 - 2137.52] you'd like okay stopped eating eggs for
[2134.52 - 2139.68] 3 Days drinking celery juice and feel so
[2137.52 - 2142.64] much better crazy to think I've been
[2139.68 - 2145.80] eating eggs every day I got mono in high
[2142.64 - 2150.16] school and searching for
[2145.80 - 2150.16] advice um grateful for medical
[2151.88 - 2158.80] medium yeah an
[2154.76 - 2158.80] Anique and K
[2160.12 - 2165.24] so when white lung is going on out
[2162.68 - 2166.48] there I would not eat an egg I don't eat
[2165.24 - 2168.92] eggs
[2166.48 - 2171.24] anyway but I would not eat an egg cuz I
[2168.92 - 2173.68] don't want this in my body feeding that
[2171.24 - 2176.68] bug that's going around cuz I don't want
[2173.68 - 2178.60] fluid in my lungs and I don't want pus
[2176.68 - 2181.20] in my lungs and I don't want my
[2178.60 - 2183.36] lymphatic system taken over by fluid and
[2181.20 - 2187.16] pus and I don't want my liver beaten
[2183.36 - 2188.28] down and so I'm not going to eat an egg
[2187.16 - 2190.48] I'm
[2188.28 - 2192.16] not another thing I'm not going to eat
[2190.48 - 2196.12] because of white lung going
[2192.16 - 2199.04] around see if I can find some right
[2196.12 - 2202.08] here another thing I would not
[2199.04 - 2203.96] eat since white L's going
[2202.08 - 2207.64] around
[2203.96 - 2210.32] cheese would not eat
[2207.64 - 2211.84] cheese you can eat what you want you got
[2210.32 - 2213.36] your own free will you got your own
[2211.84 - 2214.56] doctors you got your own whatever
[2213.36 - 2218.08] healthc care providers telling you what
[2214.56 - 2221.04] to do you listen to them right
[2218.08 - 2222.92] but I'm saying what I wouldn't do I
[2221.04 - 2225.56] would stay away from cheese with these
[2222.92 - 2228.16] bugs going around because then bugs they
[2225.56 - 2230.08] love to eat this and if this is in all
[2228.16 - 2232.16] tied up in your lymphatic system the
[2230.08 - 2234.16] mucus and the crud from this is all
[2232.16 - 2237.04] sitting your L lymphatic system your
[2234.16 - 2239.36] lymph it's all sitting in your liver
[2237.04 - 2241.12] what's going to happen is it's going to
[2239.36 - 2242.72] make it so when white lung comes around
[2241.12 - 2244.44] that virus that comes around is going to
[2242.72 - 2247.08] spew out so much mucus is going to
[2244.44 - 2249.24] produce so much mucus and and it's not
[2247.08 - 2251.52] going to have a place to go and that's
[2249.24 - 2253.20] why people's lungs fill up it's why
[2251.52 - 2254.96] kids' lungs are filling up and they're
[2253.20 - 2256.28] in the hospitals right now their lungs
[2254.96 - 2258.12] are filling up with fluid because
[2256.28 - 2260.08] they're on so many of these things of
[2258.12 - 2262.04] course their immune system is also low
[2260.08 - 2264.28] for a host of different reasons they
[2262.04 - 2265.76] don't know about the protocols you know
[2264.28 - 2267.64] you got all these people I see it every
[2265.76 - 2269.60] day I hear about I had a doctor friend
[2267.64 - 2272.24] tell me there's so many kids in the
[2269.60 - 2274.44] hospital with this white lung and the
[2272.24 - 2276.12] families don't know about protocols and
[2274.44 - 2279.00] what kids need and stuff they they don't
[2276.12 - 2279.00] bring these to their
[2279.36 - 2283.96] doctor and the kids are on cheese the
[2281.80 - 2286.84] kids are on
[2283.96 - 2288.72] eggs the adults are on cheese adults are
[2286.84 - 2291.24] on eggs and then it rips through the
[2288.72 - 2293.32] family and it knocks people down and
[2291.24 - 2294.96] knocks nurses down and knocks everybody
[2293.32 - 2298.08] down you
[2294.96 - 2301.16] know and then it's the craziest thing we
[2298.08 - 2303.00] go through life we go through life I
[2301.16 - 2305.56] going do it all over again if you
[2303.00 - 2308.24] believe that this isn't our only
[2305.56 - 2312.32] lifetime do you believe that this isn't
[2308.24 - 2314.24] our only lifetime tell me like it's okay
[2312.32 - 2316.24] if you believe this we got one shot and
[2314.24 - 2318.80] one shot only we never come back our
[2316.24 - 2320.68] soul is not even there we don't have a
[2318.80 - 2322.28] soul our soul doesn't come back into
[2320.68 - 2325.92] this lifetime our soul doesn't come back
[2322.28 - 2328.16] into another body there's no way aw it
[2325.92 - 2331.88] doesn't happen we die and that's it well
[2328.16 - 2335.52] okay okay you die you're gone that's it
[2331.88 - 2337.32] then but if you believe we come back
[2335.52 - 2340.00] here
[2337.32 - 2341.84] and we come back here again and we may
[2340.00 - 2343.56] come back here again if you believe that

[2660.04 - 2665.48] neumonia that's going around we need
[2662.64 - 2667.68] foods and options that are really
[2665.48 - 2669.40] helpful I mean I can go in here all day
[2667.68 - 2672.24] look at this this is what I'm making
[2669.40 - 2674.92] right here take a look you guys split
[2672.24 - 2678.52] screening that baby
[2674.92 - 2680.88] look that's what we're making today it's
[2678.52 - 2683.44] with chickpea flour now I want to tell
[2680.88 - 2686.48] you something I know I make some
[2683.44 - 2688.04] pretty pretty intense recipes sometimes
[2686.48 - 2689.48] overall and you might be somebody that's
[2688.04 - 2690.44] already on the medical medium monoc
[2689.48 - 2692.16] cleanse or you're somebody that's
[2690.44 - 2694.20] already on the you're on the morning
[2692.16 - 2695.64] cleanse then you do your hmds you do all
[2694.20 - 2696.56] this other stuff you do the 28 day
[2695.64 - 2698.00] cleanse
[2696.56 - 2699.24] and this might not be what you want
[2698.00 - 2700.72] right now but for the people who
[2699.24 - 2702.16] actually want something like this is an
[2700.72 - 2707.56] option we got
[2702.16 - 2713.24] them all right cheese stay away when the
[2707.56 - 2715.84] bugs are out to play okay eggs stay away
[2713.24 - 2718.48] when the bugs are out to play okay
[2715.84 - 2719.72] important to know if you can if it's the
[2718.48 - 2723.00] only food you have and you're going to
[2719.72 - 2724.68] starve eat the eggs then if it's the
[2723.00 - 2726.32] only food you have you have some
[2724.68 - 2728.08] chickens in the backyard you can't get
[2726.32 - 2731.04] to a store you're going to starve to
[2728.08 - 2732.52] death eat the eggs if you got nothing
[2731.04 - 2734.24] else but an old piece of cheese in the
[2732.52 - 2736.12] refrigerator and you got nothing to eat
[2734.24 - 2738.96] that day and it's the only thing that's
[2736.12 - 2740.64] going to keep you like stable meaning
[2738.96 - 2742.96] something in your body so you have some
[2740.64 - 2745.04] kind of substance something like that
[2742.96 - 2746.96] you can actually function with then eat
[2745.04 - 2751.40] the cheese but I'm saying if you have
[2746.96 - 2752.88] options stay away when you're up against
[2751.40 - 2754.48] the pathogens that are out there right
[2752.88 - 2756.64] now that are sweeping through like the
[2754.48 - 2759.16] white lung
[2756.64 - 2760.28] very important so I want to go into the
[2759.16 - 2764.08] Colden
[2760.28 - 2766.32] flu right here just for a little
[2764.08 - 2768.64] bit you'll see
[2766.32 - 2770.20] dosages and I'll show you on a closeup
[2768.64 - 2771.44] too we'll see if the close-up camera can

[2773.32 - 2777.44] incredible about this all right let me
[2775.32 - 2782.64] see if I can get in there yep there you
[2777.44 - 2786.64] are right voila focus focus

[2786.64 - 2793.24] and C right for
[2789.56 - 2794.96] children and then there's adults as well
[2793.24 - 2797.32] so it goes into that but it shows you
[2794.96 - 2798.76] dosages and you can just do maybe three
[2797.32 - 2800.44] of these things ask your doctor what's
[2798.76 - 2801.60] right for you but you can do three of
[2800.44 - 2804.04] these
[2801.60 - 2805.64] things five of these things you don't
[2804.04 - 2808.16] have to do everything if you don't want
[2805.64 - 2811.12] to but you'll see at the top of the list
[2808.16 - 2815.28] it'll say fresh celery juice that's not
[2811.12 - 2817.48] a supplement but if you can do it how
[2815.28 - 2819.56] incredible that is that like it says C
[2817.48 - 2822.48] fresh celery juice right there for Cold
[2819.56 - 2825.40] and Flu fresh celery juice right there

[2831.92 - 2837.20] this out time
[2833.88 - 2839.00] tea so time tea if that's all you can do
[2837.20 - 2840.44] then that's what you can do but at least
[2839.00 - 2844.00] you have
[2840.44 - 2846.44] options it's really an incredible

[2901.32 - 2906.48] celery juice I get bad stomach cramps
[2905.04 - 2909.96] when

[2909.96 - 2914.56] medical medium
[2911.40 - 2917.80] books okay I talk about you can start
[2914.56 - 2921.88] very very little very little if you have
[2917.80 - 2924.32] a lot of things pathogens bacteria yeast
[2921.88 - 2926.96] unproductive fungus mold a lot of people
[2924.32 - 2930.92] have all kinds of stuff right inside
[2926.96 - 2930.92] here okay and in their
[2931.08 - 2938.40] liver celery juice kills off
[2934.32 - 2943.52] unproductive yeast and mold celery juice
[2938.40 - 2947.24] strips down bad bacteria strep
[2943.52 - 2947.24] sea hpylori
[2947.44 - 2952.80] bacteria like eoli that actually develop
[2951.32 - 2955.64] people develop
[2952.80 - 2957.32] ulcers diverticulosis
[2955.64 - 2958.92] diverticulitis they have all these
[2957.32 - 2963.60] different little bit of bacteria like
[2958.92 - 2965.24] strep eoli sedith staff all sits in
[2963.60 - 2968.80] there in the little pockets inside their
[2965.24 - 2971.44] intes track you put the celery juice
[2968.80 - 2973.04] down if you're making it fresh that's
[2971.44 - 2975.00] best maybe you're buying some store
[2973.04 - 2976.96] bought one that's HPP and that one might
[2975.00 - 2978.16] be giving you cramps I don't know a lot
[2976.96 - 2979.52] of people do that well they'll tell me
[2978.16 - 2980.92] they're drinking celery juice and
[2979.52 - 2983.56] they're getting the store bought one
[2980.92 - 2987.72] it's got all this junk in there it's got
[2983.56 - 2990.24] different things mixed in it it's it's
[2987.72 - 2993.08] HPP high pressure pasteurization which
[2990.24 - 2994.16] is actually not it means it's not raw it
[2993.08 - 2996.64] means it's
[2994.16 - 2999.20] cooked with an an experimental way of
[2996.64 - 3000.44] cooking it which is actually scary if
[2999.20 - 3002.92] you're going to cook something i' rather
[3000.44 - 3004.44] have you put it to heat and cook it but
[3002.92 - 3006.96] whatever it is if you're doing if you're
[3004.44 - 3009.32] getting a little cramped up from celery
[3006.96 - 3011.88] juice are you straining it do you know
[3009.32 - 3014.48] the guidelines do you know the
[3011.88 - 3018.12] information are you straining the celery
[3014.48 - 3020.28] juice you got to strain it that bring
[3018.12 - 3021.92] dials that down right there that's one
[3020.28 - 3024.04] of the reasons why you have to strain it
[3021.92 - 3025.80] it's critical right and then the other
[3024.04 - 3027.64] thing is you do a little bit at a time
[3025.80 - 3029.44] if you could only do 2 O of celery juice
[3027.64 - 3032.04] run a few sticks through and do 2 oz you
[3029.44 - 3034.72] start with that and see how it rolls a
[3032.04 - 3037.16] lot of people have to acclimate they got
[3034.72 - 3037.16] to
[3037.96 - 3041.68] acclimate all right making a
[3044.64 - 3048.32] Kye and we're going to talk about white
[3046.68 - 3051.60] long where we're doing it we're not
[3048.32 - 3054.16] making a kiche where did I get that
[3051.60 - 3057.44] idea we're making a

[3243.60 - 3249.72] this in look at
[3246.12 - 3251.76] that I want to get this all nice in
[3249.72 - 3257.08] there and
[3251.76 - 3259.60] then o no
[3257.08 - 3261.68] no bigger mess for
[3259.60 - 3266.48] later
[3261.68 - 3268.76] okay that's mixed up let's get the
[3266.48 - 3270.76] carrot in there I'm going to start with
[3268.76 - 3272.92] some carrot so what I'm going to do is
[3270.76 - 3275.88] I'm just going to peel this carrot you
[3272.92 - 3278.52] can you don't have to peel a carrot I'm
[3275.88 - 3280.76] going to peel it because I want a
[3278.52 - 3285.24] certain look too when you open up that
[3280.76 - 3286.16] cooked beautiful cooked muffin right so
[3285.24 - 3289.04] I want
[3286.16 - 3291.64] to peel that carrot now what I'm going
[3289.04 - 3295.40] to do is I'm going to use the peeler to
[3291.64 - 3297.28] make the carrot like like nice and like
[3295.40 - 3302.60] thin pieces because I'm GNA chop those
[3297.28 - 3304.52] up I don't want hunks of Raw carrot in
[3302.60 - 3307.88] this
[3304.52 - 3310.40] fata so what I'm doing
[3307.88 - 3311.96] is I'm peeling the carrot back and I'm
[3310.40 - 3314.12] making this these strips and I'm going
[3311.96 - 3317.28] to cut those strips you see you guys
[3314.12 - 3319.44] right careful when you use one of these
[3317.28 - 3322.80] I mean you can catch your finger
[3319.44 - 3325.36] and that would not be good and I'm kind
[3322.80 - 3328.12] of like I'm kind of like I get a little
[3325.36 - 3329.48] intense right here so could easily
[3328.12 - 3332.16] happen all right that should be good
[3329.48 - 3334.92] right there you can do a whole carrot if
[3332.16 - 3336.92] you want but you'll have a carrot cake
[3334.92 - 3338.88] so you got to look out you don't want a
[3336.92 - 3341.68] carrot cake in this situation I think
[3338.88 - 3343.56] that's like a lot I think that's plenty
[3341.68 - 3346.28] okay so I'm going to do a little bit of
[3343.56 - 3346.28] chopping if you don't
[3347.00 - 3352.36] mind and you don't want the strands to
[3350.00 - 3354.00] be really long inside your muffins right
[3352.36 - 3357.00] there cuz I'm making
[3354.00 - 3357.00] muffins
[3357.12 - 3362.96] okay we want to chop these up pretty
[3360.44 - 3364.68] good if you guys are still on your

[3364.68 - 3368.36] couple of things if you like what I'm

[3396.84 - 3404.64] too all right look right there so what I
[3400.76 - 3407.24] did is I finally minced some carrot and
[3404.64 - 3408.92] then going to drop that carrot right
[3407.24 - 3411.44] into the
[3408.92 - 3413.08] mix like I said before you don't want so
[3411.44 - 3415.36] much carrot that you made yourself a
[3413.08 - 3416.64] carrot cake nothing wrong wrong with a
[3415.36 - 3420.44] carrot
[3416.64 - 3421.92] cake I mean a healthy carrot cake right
[3420.44 - 3423.80] I want people they're eating a carrot
[3421.92 - 3425.76] cake filled with all this junk on it in
[3423.80 - 3429.08] it and they're like I'm eating a carrot
[3425.76 - 3433.28] cake is that healthy I'm like uh all
[3429.08 - 3434.84] right zucchini right here let's go so
[3433.28 - 3437.04] I'm just going to cut off the ends of
[3434.84 - 3437.04] that
[3437.16 - 3441.96] zucchini now the same thing with
[3439.96 - 3443.80] zucchini okay I'm just going to cut off
[3441.96 - 3446.80] a couple little
[3443.80 - 3446.80] pieces
[3448.04 - 3451.92] all right just a couple little strange
[3449.76 - 3454.12] pieces you go to the store you buy
[3451.92 - 3455.40] zucchini you'll see that right there
[3454.12 - 3457.44] I'll show you in a
[3455.40 - 3460.08] closeup that's somebody's fingernail
[3457.44 - 3462.04] that went through there and it ain't
[3460.08 - 3465.20] mine
[3462.04 - 3468.24] so if I want to scare the crap out of
[3465.20 - 3470.48] myself I'll ask Spirit of
[3468.24 - 3472.32] compassion whose fingernail was that
[3470.48 - 3475.04] what was under that fingernail what
[3472.32 - 3476.64] could potentially be in that zucchini
[3475.04 - 3478.32] but I try not to ask Spirit of
[3476.64 - 3480.32] compassion those questions I just know
[3478.32 - 3481.96] that anything could be under somebody's
[3480.32 - 3485.16] fingernail
[3481.96 - 3488.12] from the's the strap to everything under
[3485.16 - 3491.04] the sun I've talked about this for years
[3488.12 - 3492.80] okay so let's chop this up here so not
[3491.04 - 3495.64] only do I wash stuff and I'm going to do
[3492.80 - 3498.24] like a whole show on washing produce for
[3495.64 - 3501.60] sure so I'm going to slice this in kind
[3498.24 - 3503.60] of like these kinds of slice pieces
[3501.60 - 3506.08] right here now you don't want these
[3503.60 - 3508.88] really big and hunky either in the
[3506.08 - 3511.28] mix okay so what I'm going to do is cut
[3508.88 - 3511.28] these
[3513.56 - 3518.04] small see
[3515.52 - 3519.84] guys so anyway I wanted to talk about
[3518.04 - 3521.72] this pneumonia that's that's rushing
[3519.84 - 3525.20] through the us right
[3521.72 - 3529.32] now I would say right around Christmas
[3525.20 - 3529.32] time it's going to be in the major
[3529.84 - 3534.52] cities a lot of people are going to be
[3531.84 - 3536.36] in the emergency room a lot of people
[3534.52 - 3539.64] take taking a lot of antibiotics and
[3536.36 - 3541.44] hopes to curve it I'm not trying to
[3539.64 - 3543.52] freak you out or anything it's just that
[3541.44 - 3545.88] if I don't say anything about it like
[3543.52 - 3547.68] when the next flu comes through or the
[3545.88 - 3549.56] next mysterious pneumonia comes through
[3547.68 - 3552.36] if I don't remind people to be a little
[3549.56 - 3554.84] more cautious like use a handy wipe at
[3552.36 - 3557.68] on the shopping carts on the carriage
[3554.84 - 3560.84] handle cuz all the Simplex on there and
[3557.68 - 3563.64] all the strap and all the the flu on
[3560.84 - 3565.84] there and the white lung flu will be on
[3563.64 - 3568.28] there
[3565.84 - 3569.76] so what I'm saying is there's different
[3568.28 - 3571.72] precautions you can take and then of
[3569.76 - 3573.68] course protocols right you want your
[3571.72 - 3575.92] time tea every day you want that cold
[3573.68 - 3579.76] and flu
[3575.92 - 3584.60] protocol okay guys getting this in
[3579.76 - 3584.60] here might be like pretty much all I
[3585.28 - 3590.12] need and once this is in the oven we'll
[3587.56 - 3593.64] talk about the white flu all
[3590.12 - 3596.28] right okay next on the list
[3593.64 - 3599.44] onion the only thing with the onion is
[3596.28 - 3602.32] I'm just not in the mood to like be all
[3599.44 - 3605.52] teared up from the onion and I'm not in
[3602.32 - 3607.12] the mood for that right now you know the
[3605.52 - 3609.92] watery
[3607.12 - 3611.76] eyes cuz this onion I noticed has been
[3609.92 - 3614.32] kind of sharp I've been using this onion
[3611.76 - 3616.68] lately this yellow onion it's been
[3614.32 - 3619.64] pretty darn
[3616.68 - 3621.60] sharp
[3619.64 - 3624.76] okay an
[3621.60 - 3627.04] anti-pathogenic power the onion has
[3624.76 - 3631.32] that's the kind of stuff you
[3627.04 - 3632.92] want okay you want that
[3631.32 - 3635.72] anti-pathogenic
[3632.92 - 3639.92] Powerhouse which is herbs like onions
[3635.72 - 3642.40] and garlic you want that you don't want
[3639.92 - 3646.20] you know cheese cheese is just going to
[3642.40 - 3648.40] gum up the works and feed a pathogen
[3646.20 - 3652.00] feed a virus that's going around making
[3648.40 - 3655.44] it worse then like cheese cheese is
[3652.00 - 3658.04] going to just tie up your lymphatic
[3655.44 - 3660.28] system I love it I love it when haters a
[3658.04 - 3662.20] medical medium like say like certain
[3660.28 - 3664.72] dietitians or something they're like
[3662.20 - 3666.24] he's starving people from cheese people
[3664.72 - 3668.40] need their protein they need their
[3666.24 - 3672.28] cheese I'm going to have Samantha
[3668.40 - 3674.08] eventually come um over and make an
[3672.28 - 3676.60] appearance and talk about cheese and
[3674.08 - 3680.20] protein and things like that but
[3676.60 - 3682.68] Sammy hasn't been feeling good lately
[3680.20 - 3684.60] she's been under the weather herself she
[3682.68 - 3689.56] caught a little something and Sam's been
[3684.60 - 3693.16] sick herself so yep she's been coughing
[3689.56 - 3697.40] she's got a UTI Sammy has a bad
[3693.16 - 3701.28] UTI um She's coughing a lot so Samy's
[3697.40 - 3704.12] doing that okay I'm put a little bit
[3701.28 - 3705.08] more onion in here can't help it and
[3704.12 - 3708.48] then we're going to do some fresh
[3705.08 - 3709.56] squeezed lemon boom might even do some
[3708.48 - 3711.56] other stuff too we're going to do some
[3709.56 - 3713.44] red bell
[3711.56 - 3716.44] pepper
[3713.44 - 3716.44] so
[3716.60 - 3719.64] so I noticed
[3719.68 - 3725.56] that Spirit of compassion was telling me
[3723.36 - 3727.76] that even though we just dealt with the
[3725.56 - 3729.16] whole issue we did with four years ago
[3727.76 - 3731.28] with the bugs going around and stuff
[3729.16 - 3734.68] Spirit of compassion has told me that
[3731.28 - 3736.28] we're due for a really bad one not not
[3734.68 - 3738.48] the one that's coming right now that's
[3736.28 - 3740.68] already landed in the
[3738.48 - 3743.36] US that one right
[3740.68 - 3746.36] now where is my hand
[3743.36 - 3746.36] tow
[3747.04 - 3754.12] that one's really annoying for sure but
[3751.08 - 3757.44] s so tells me that eventually there's
[3754.12 - 3761.48] going to be a really bad Bruiser of a
[3757.44 - 3761.48] brute that's going to be coming to
[3762.36 - 3767.88] town and so we want strong immune

[3767.88 - 3771.40] want to know what foods to eat we want
[3769.56 - 3775.68] to know how to take care of

[4706.44 - 4709.96] been around how many times are you told
[4708.40 - 4711.48] don't eat this don't eat that let's do
[4709.96 - 4713.56] an all cat let's check out your food
[4711.48 - 4715.36] allergy testing don't eat this don't eat
[4713.56 - 4717.48] this let's check your IGG don't eat that
[4715.36 - 4719.28] that that that that that that try the F
[4717.48 - 4721.04] map try this try eat right for this try
[4719.28 - 4722.76] to do that and it's like oh restrictive
[4721.04 - 4724.64] here restrictive here restrictive here
[4722.76 - 4727.20] it's just constantly like that all the
[4724.64 - 4729.08] time carnivore restrictive boom you name
[4727.20 - 4731.12] it even carnivore guys that were
[4729.08 - 4732.60] preaching carnivore they hit the wall
[4731.12 - 4734.92] their brain didn't work and they had to
[4732.60 - 4737.32] start bringing in fruit and honey and
[4734.92 - 4738.96] lemon because they were literally dying
[4737.32 - 4740.92] on straight carnivore they were so
[4738.96 - 4742.20] restricted and it's like now they're
[4740.92 - 4743.40] like you know all of a sudden like
[4742.20 - 4745.60] functioning again because they're
[4743.40 - 4748.60] getting some type of sugar in them I
[4745.60 - 4753.40] just had the pneumonia and almost died
[4748.60 - 4753.40] we need to stop World Travel for
[4754.16 - 4757.44] real for
[4759.24 - 4764.52] real all
[4761.84 - 4767.00] right
[4764.52 - 4767.00] dummy
[4767.40 - 4772.72] here pH crispy perspective oh my God
[4771.04 - 4773.92] been through that and done that so
[4772.72 - 4778.28] you've actually been through that you're
[4773.92 - 4779.88] seasoned you know what's up you do right
[4778.28 - 4781.96] now you guys are so much hate and attack
[4779.88 - 4784.72] on medical medium it's
[4781.96 - 4786.72] unbelievable out there and they're just
[4784.72 - 4788.36] so jealous and they're all trying to
[4786.72 - 4789.88] sell all their programs and they're
[4788.36 - 4791.88] trying to sell all their build their
[4789.88 - 4793.56] Empires and they're trying to do you
[4791.88 - 4794.96] name it and they're so pissed at Medical
[4793.56 - 4797.12] medium they're tired of hearing people
[4794.96 - 4799.52] say medical medium fixed me medical
[4797.12 - 4801.16] medium healed me medical medium
[4799.52 - 4802.56] literally changed my life and I got
[4801.16 - 4806.24] better I was bedridden they don't want
[4802.56 - 4807.36] to hear that they don't want to hear it
[4806.24 - 4810.16] people are
[4807.36 - 4813.36] asking and people ask about these bad
[4810.16 - 4815.12] bugs you know it's important to answer
[4813.36 - 4818.92] and talk about it a little bit so first
[4815.12 - 4820.32] of all first thing to know what is it
[4818.92 - 4823.44] what is this
[4820.32 - 4825.08] bug well
[4823.44 - 4828.92] the
[4825.08 - 4828.92] CBC see how I changed the
[4829.16 - 4836.80] acrom the
[4831.12 - 4841.56] CBC right says oh don't worry it's not a
[4836.80 - 4844.20] virus don't worry it is it's viral it's
[4841.56 - 4848.52] a virus yes it
[4844.20 - 4848.52] is okay it's
[4848.76 - 4855.36] another viral issue at hand
[4853.44 - 4856.40] but no one wants to talk about it
[4855.36 - 4859.44] because they think everybody's just
[4856.40 - 4862.24] burned out from the last virus so
[4859.44 - 4863.84] they're trying to say oh maybe it's it's
[4862.24 - 4866.72] myoplasmic
[4863.84 - 4869.16] maybe it's bacteria and that's what
[4866.72 - 4873.92] they're going by but it's viral very
[4869.16 - 4877.60] important to know okay so here's how it
[4873.92 - 4880.52] works when you catch a
[4877.60 - 4883.16] bacteria okay our body does not do the
[4880.52 - 4886.76] same thing it does
[4883.16 - 4890.96] with viruses so what people are getting
[4886.76 - 4893.84] is lung infections so
[4890.96 - 4899.28] rapid critical lung
[4893.84 - 4901.20] infections those are only caused by cyto
[4899.28 - 4903.56] storms
[4901.20 - 4905.32] cyto
[4903.56 - 4907.72] storms
[4905.32 - 4909.64] bacteria does not
[4907.72 - 4913.40] create a
[4909.64 - 4914.60] full-blown cyto storm
[4913.40 - 4915.88] it's one thing if I'm sitting here and
[4914.60 - 4918.32] I'm just going to talk to you guys about
[4915.88 - 4921.32] this and say wait long wait long wait
[4918.32 - 4923.32] long pneumonia ponia build your immune
[4921.32 - 4926.28] system it's another if I can at Le it's
[4923.32 - 4928.04] one thing to do that it's another so you
[4926.28 - 4930.40] guys know what's going on so you guys
[4928.04 - 4933.88] hear it here you hear it here first you
[4930.40 - 4936.72] know you learn about it you know the BS
[4933.88 - 4938.56] that's happening out there
[4936.72 - 4940.28] okay
[4938.56 - 4944.80] viruses
[4940.28 - 4947.64] Airborne like the flu and like C create
[4944.80 - 4952.40] cyto storms whether it's a small cyto
[4947.64 - 4956.60] storm or a large cyto storm the only way
[4952.40 - 4959.52] to get pneumatic fluid in the lungs to
[4956.60 - 4962.76] this degree is you have to be doing some
[4959.52 - 4965.64] type of cyto storm and the only way to
[4962.76 - 4968.32] do that cyto storm to this degree is it
[4965.64 - 4970.92] has to be a virus it can't be bacteria
[4968.32 - 4974.20] but see that's how you know how foul the
[4970.92 - 4977.08] game is played and how the game
[4974.20 - 4979.00] is played out there so just be like oh
[4977.08 - 4981.56] it's m
[4979.00 - 4985.60] micoplasma it's it's you know it's
[4981.56 - 4988.24] bacteria no no that that can already be
[4985.60 - 4991.56] in you and when your immune system gets
[4988.24 - 4995.04] knocked down by a cyto storm from a
[4991.56 - 4998.72] virus getting into the lungs then
[4995.04 - 5001.04] yeah other bacteria can Thrive and in
[4998.72 - 5003.12] some people can Thrive so much that you
[5001.04 - 5006.36] end up getting even more fluid in more
[5003.12 - 5008.64] problems and more issues another person
[5006.36 - 5010.24] they may not have that type of bacteria
[5008.64 - 5011.76] that's really in their system that can
[5010.24 - 5013.52] Elevate like they don't have enough
[5011.76 - 5015.52] strap and they don't have enough other
[5013.52 - 5017.36] varieties of bacteria so they don't get
[5015.52 - 5019.80] that elevation of bacteria but they
[5017.36 - 5022.92] still get the cyto storm and the fluid
[5019.80 - 5022.92] in the lungs and the
[5023.80 - 5028.32] mucus you guys I didn't listen I want
[5026.40 - 5030.56] you know I didn't say stop World Travel
[5028.32 - 5032.28] that was I was reading a comment of
[5030.56 - 5034.96] someone who said they almost died from
[5032.28 - 5038.48] the pneumonia and they said they would
[5034.96 - 5042.72] stop World Travel so that wasn't me
[5038.48 - 5044.60] saying it what I say is make sure you
[5042.72 - 5046.28] have information wherever you're
[5044.60 - 5047.80] traveling make sure you have protocols
[5046.28 - 5049.32] and understand what's going on so you
[5047.80 - 5052.12] can protect yourself and make sure you
[5049.32 - 5054.44] have that while you're traveling and
[5052.12 - 5057.72] that's what I
[5054.44 - 5060.16] say so the first lesson here in this
[5057.72 - 5061.92] exhibit is to know that when you see
[5060.16 - 5064.36] somebody going through white lung
[5061.92 - 5065.68] they're going through cyto storm now
[5064.36 - 5068.24] here's the next part that's really
[5065.68 - 5070.12] critical to know this tells you if it's
[5068.24 - 5075.28] virus get
[5070.12 - 5077.80] ready if it's titled white lung why
[5075.28 - 5081.76] they're titling it white lung because
[5077.80 - 5087.40] they're seeing scar tissue in the
[5081.76 - 5089.60] lung they're seeing scar tissue in the
[5087.40 - 5092.84] lung that's
[5089.60 - 5098.88] why why is there scar tissue in the lung
[5092.84 - 5104.32] because of a cyto storm only a cyto
[5098.88 - 5106.76] storm can create White Scar Tissue seen
[5104.32 - 5109.56] on the scans in the
[5106.76 - 5112.28] lung because of a
[5109.56 - 5114.60] virus that's Advanced information right
[5112.28 - 5116.00] there extremely Advanced information
[5114.60 - 5116.76] about what's going on out there and how
[5116.00 - 5119.76] it
[5116.76 - 5121.60] works this one thing to be like oh you
[5119.76 - 5123.16] know what is it out there what's going
[5121.60 - 5126.44] on
[5123.16 - 5129.84] oh it's another to actually know how it
[5126.44 - 5132.40] works virus enters in through your nose
[5129.84 - 5134.36] the virus enters in through your mouth
[5132.40 - 5136.32] you eat the virus if you're eating out
[5134.36 - 5138.08] you know somewhere out and and somebody
[5136.32 - 5140.16] coughed on the plate you're eating the
[5138.08 - 5142.16] virus you're breathing it in if
[5140.16 - 5143.76] somebody's sneezing if somebody's
[5142.16 - 5146.36] breathing you're breathing it in you get
[5143.76 - 5147.88] it in and when that virus gets in you
[5146.36 - 5151.36] goes down into the
[5147.88 - 5152.84] lung it gets in the lung and then
[5151.36 - 5154.48] there's a war
[5152.84 - 5157.08] a war that
[5154.48 - 5159.28] ensues so next
[5157.08 - 5161.40] piece next piece been critical
[5159.28 - 5165.56] information here it
[5161.40 - 5168.24] is right there your white blood cells
[5165.56 - 5171.16] your white blood cells
[5168.24 - 5174.64] and the virus that's going around right
[5171.16 - 5176.76] now they go into battle they fight and
[5174.64 - 5178.44] as they're fighting and totally just
[5176.76 - 5180.48] pissing each other off and they're after
[5178.44 - 5182.88] each other and and the virus is trying
[5180.48 - 5184.16] to kill the immune cell
[5182.88 - 5186.20] that's what the virus is doing he trying
[5184.16 - 5187.64] to destroy and kill your immune cells
[5186.20 - 5189.36] and your immune cell is trying to stay
[5187.64 - 5191.48] alive and it's sit you're trying to kill
[5189.36 - 5193.48] the virus it's trying to eat the virus
[5191.48 - 5196.36] and this war that's
[5193.48 - 5199.80] happening is the cyto
[5196.36 - 5204.40] storm and if the immune system is
[5199.80 - 5206.84] weakened and beat down then the virus
[5204.40 - 5209.32] can bypass it and get into lung tissue
[5206.84 - 5212.48] and start to eat up some of the lung
[5209.32 - 5213.72] tissue cells which creates a scar scar
[5212.48 - 5217.20] like
[5213.72 - 5219.64] tissue and that's what the cyto storm in
[5217.20 - 5221.80] white lung is and that's what's going
[5219.64 - 5224.72] out going around right now so all these
[5221.80 - 5227.40] kids and adults are getting these Scar
[5224.72 - 5228.80] Tissue markers in their lungs where they
[5227.40 - 5231.16] don't really know what it is well that's
[5228.80 - 5235.08] what it is it's scar
[5231.16 - 5237.52] tissue and that's what's going on there
[5235.08 - 5241.12] okay
[5237.52 - 5242.88] so a tremendous amount of
[5241.12 - 5245.44] lymphocytes
[5242.88 - 5249.12] and white blood cells and killer cells
[5245.44 - 5252.32] die from this cyto storm so you're in
[5249.12 - 5254.80] crisis with the cyto storm because your
[5252.32 - 5257.48] immune system is exploding just like
[5254.80 - 5260.32] this white blood cell just did so it
[5257.48 - 5262.08] fell apart it just boom exploded and
[5260.32 - 5264.08] that's what happens so when people are
[5262.08 - 5267.32] dealing with this they're actually
[5264.08 - 5269.84] losing white blood cells left and right
[5267.32 - 5272.16] thousands of them and then your bone
[5269.84 - 5274.04] marrows going into overdrive producing
[5272.16 - 5276.80] more white blood cells and more immune
[5274.04 - 5279.60] killer more immune cells and those are
[5276.80 - 5282.08] coming back up to the lungs and the war
[5279.60 - 5284.00] still goes on so finally after things
[5282.08 - 5287.72] dumb down a little bit you get a mucus
[5284.00 - 5289.88] an overload of mucus from this process
[5287.72 - 5292.00] it starts out where the mucus doesn't
[5289.88 - 5294.48] start the mucus starts out a little
[5292.00 - 5297.84] later so this whole white lung
[5294.48 - 5300.00] mysterious pneumonia syndrome is mucus
[5297.84 - 5303.44] that starts a little after a little
[5300.00 - 5307.28] later on after already The War Began
[5303.44 - 5309.24] with the cyto storm and as the War Began
[5307.28 - 5312.32] it started to the war started to die
[5309.24 - 5316.92] down and finish and what was left is now
[5312.32 - 5319.04] the mucus from the byproduct of all of
[5316.92 - 5322.64] the viruses that have been killed and
[5319.04 - 5326.24] destroyed by your immune system and that
[5322.64 - 5331.36] byproduct helps to produce a tremendous
[5326.24 - 5334.76] amount of mucus and pus and yellow mucus
[5331.36 - 5338.28] and clear mucus and all that mucus
[5334.76 - 5341.12] builds up in the lower sections of the
[5338.28 - 5344.12] lung because when it comes down to a bad
[5341.12 - 5346.68] virus those are the viruses the bad flu
[5344.12 - 5348.96] viruses the bad sea viruses the bad
[5346.68 - 5352.24] white lung
[5348.96 - 5355.16] viruses those are the viruses that
[5352.24 - 5357.60] actually trigger off lower lung issues
[5355.16 - 5361.16] they go deeper they just don't sit up
[5357.60 - 5364.52] here where you have postnasal drip and
[5361.16 - 5367.08] you get like cold in the head or a mild
[5364.52 - 5369.64] flu in the head and then the drip goes
[5367.08 - 5371.16] down into your lung no that's not what's
[5369.64 - 5374.92] Happening
[5371.16 - 5378.52] Here someone can get a flu the flu goes
[5374.92 - 5381.56] into their sinuses gets into their head
[5378.52 - 5383.84] it produces a tremendous amount of mucus
[5381.56 - 5386.00] the mucus and the sinuses drains down as
[5383.84 - 5387.72] you're sleeping into the night you're
[5386.00 - 5391.08] sleeping and it's draining down into
[5387.72 - 5392.84] your lungs but it's draining down into
[5391.08 - 5396.08] the upper lungs
[5392.84 - 5398.84] upper area of your respiratory and then
[5396.08 - 5401.52] that's the cough and the crack and the
[5398.84 - 5403.56] cough and the carak and that's what that
[5401.52 - 5405.80] is you're trying to expel you need the
[5403.56 - 5407.96] expectorant you need it to come out but
[5405.80 - 5410.56] the difference is when it's like the
[5407.96 - 5412.40] white lung the mysterious pneumonia bugs
[5410.56 - 5414.72] those viruses they go deeper into the
[5412.40 - 5416.68] lung they go into the lower
[5414.72 - 5418.64] lungs where they're sitting in there
[5416.68 - 5421.64] trying to do
[5418.64 - 5423.68] damage and that's the difference and now
[5421.64 - 5426.32] that's where you can't breathe good and
[5423.68 - 5429.08] you feel like you're drowning in mucus
[5426.32 - 5431.00] and pus and you're drowning in it and
[5429.08 - 5434.08] that's what it feels like you see you
[5431.00 - 5436.12] guys and when you're in that position
[5434.08 - 5438.60] you're kind of stuck where whoa do I go
[5436.12 - 5441.16] to the doctor do I go to the hospital I
[5438.60 - 5442.48] can't breathe good and they're now
[5441.16 - 5444.24] they're throwing everything at you
[5442.48 - 5446.04] they're throwing you know the seatbacks
[5444.24 - 5447.92] at you they're throwing the antibiotics
[5446.04 - 5449.64] they throwing you the the steroids the
[5447.92 - 5453.72] 5-day steroids they throwing everything
[5449.64 - 5456.68] they can at you to dumb went down but
[5453.72 - 5458.60] that's what's happening so right now on
[5456.68 - 5461.64] the rise is a
[5458.60 - 5464.76] virus tagged out there as white lung
[5461.64 - 5467.84] syndrome something like
[5464.76 - 5471.60] that and mysterious pneumonia and what
[5467.84 - 5474.00] it is is another pneumatic virus going
[5471.60 - 5476.92] in here creating a cyto storm by
[5474.00 - 5478.88] battling your white blood cells going
[5476.92 - 5480.04] deeper into the lungs the lower part of
[5478.88 - 5483.44] the
[5480.04 - 5487.40] lungs and how much mucus is produced
[5483.44 - 5487.40] also depends on what you're doing for
[5487.80 - 5492.48] Foods if you're coming down with that
[5490.24 - 5493.80] baby you don't want to be eating this
[5492.48 - 5495.32] when you're coming down with that
[5493.80 - 5497.56] pneumonia when you're coming down with
[5495.32 - 5499.68] any kind of bug flu virus you don't want
[5497.56 - 5502.04] to be eating all that cheese and all
[5499.68 - 5505.28] that fat you don't want to eat
[5502.04 - 5506.68] that and there's there's sea viruses
[5505.28 - 5509.04] going around right now there's flu
[5506.68 - 5511.40] viruses going around right now and then
[5509.04 - 5512.76] there's boom this virus going around
[5511.40 - 5514.32] right now they're going to name it
[5512.76 - 5515.84] anything they want to name it but right
[5514.32 - 5519.12] now they're keeping it everybody from
[5515.84 - 5520.44] knowing it's a virus but you never know
[5519.12 - 5523.68] maybe in a month they'll be like that
[5520.44 - 5526.92] was a virus that wasn't micoplasma that
[5523.68 - 5529.40] wasn't this we'll see what
[5526.92 - 5531.92] happens but you don't want to be eating
[5529.40 - 5535.12] this or too much of
[5531.92 - 5537.04] that when this stuff is going around you
[5535.12 - 5538.72] don't want to be eating too much cheese
[5537.04 - 5540.28] you don't want to be eating any cheese
[5538.72 - 5543.36] when this stuff is going
[5540.28 - 5546.16] around you don't want to be eating eggs
[5543.36 - 5547.88] especially eggs when this stuff is going
[5546.16 - 5550.76] around
[5547.88 - 5551.68] okay right you don't want to be eating
[5550.76 - 5555.60] those
[5551.68 - 5559.04] too because these feed the virus that's
[5555.60 - 5561.40] going around so what's happening here
[5559.04 - 5564.24] okay
[5561.40 - 5566.96] is these babies are
[5564.24 - 5570.56] feeding that virus that's getting into
[5566.96 - 5573.92] people's lungs it loves to eat this and
[5570.56 - 5576.80] when it eats this it get gets
[5573.92 - 5580.52] stronger more mucus is
[5576.80 - 5582.96] produced a virus going around flu virus
[5580.52 - 5585.44] C virus any kind of virus going
[5582.96 - 5587.36] around produces mucus all on its own
[5585.44 - 5589.40] because it's it's it's leaving all this
[5587.36 - 5592.08] byproduct talked about that for years
[5589.40 - 5594.16] the byproduct from pathogens all that
[5592.08 - 5596.56] byproduct that
[5594.16 - 5598.96] byproduct saturates the system the
[5596.56 - 5600.92] lymphatic system the liver the lungs and
[5598.96 - 5604.40] all that byproduct helps to build up all
[5600.92 - 5604.40] that mucus all that
[5604.52 - 5608.00] pneumonia yellow
[5608.80 - 5613.92] pus same with cheese you don't want to
[5610.80 - 5616.44] be doing cheese when these bugs are
[5613.92 - 5618.24] around you do the cheese it's the same
[5616.44 - 5619.24] thing you got to look out it's these
[5618.24 - 5622.40] things that
[5619.24 - 5624.12] matter if it was me and I was coming
[5622.40 - 5625.60] down with something or I knew somebody
[5624.12 - 5627.44] there had something I'd be cautious
[5625.60 - 5629.28] making sure there's no cheese there's no
[5627.44 - 5632.28] milk there's no dairy products there's
[5629.28 - 5633.92] no eggs I would keep corn out
[5632.28 - 5635.68] make sure there's no corn corn syrup I
[5633.92 - 5638.80] would keep the fats low make sure
[5635.68 - 5643.04] there's no pork if you're a meat eater
[5638.80 - 5645.20] right eat lighter if you're a meat eater
[5643.04 - 5647.96] and I would make sure I would have that
[5645.20 - 5650.64] protocols book right
[5647.96 - 5653.56] there I would make sure that's there

[5743.04 - 5745.60] bit and sugar
[5745.64 - 5749.44] fear got a comment to
[5750.40 - 5756.76] read so
[5753.48 - 5759.92] um how do we heal the scar
[5756.76 - 5759.92] tissue all
[5761.16 - 5765.80] right so our lungs like to regenerate
[5763.76 - 5769.16] they like to heal over time what I've
[5765.80 - 5774.08] noticed all these years is that the only
[5769.16 - 5776.20] way to heal scar tissue in lungs is
[5774.08 - 5779.20] antioxidants high amounts of
[5776.20 - 5782.36] antioxidants namely vitamin C is one of
[5779.20 - 5785.40] the best ones right there vitamin C is
[5782.36 - 5788.76] one of the big ones for healing Scar
[5785.40 - 5791.76] Tissue associated with viruses that are
[5788.76 - 5793.92] airborne they get into the lungs damag
[5791.76 - 5797.36] tissue damag
[5793.92 - 5800.12] cells vitamin C is a big one I'm just
[5797.36 - 5802.92] giving you one tool there's plenty of
[5800.12 - 5805.52] tools in the brain saver protocols but
[5802.92 - 5809.08] I'm giving you one powerful tool all in
[5805.52 - 5811.44] its own Michelle says B12 that's that's
[5809.08 - 5815.28] important too B12 is important for for
[5811.44 - 5818.28] every single cell in the body but if you
[5815.28 - 5820.44] can't do any of that make sure you're
[5818.28 - 5823.68] staying away from a lot of the foods
[5820.44 - 5829.20] that gum up the works and I'm just using
[5823.68 - 5833.04] that basic term gums up the works okay
[5829.20 - 5834.80] like foods that dog the liver foods that
[5833.04 - 5836.44] slow down the liver foods that actually
[5834.80 - 5838.76] create a problem with the liver where so
[5836.44 - 5841.52] much mucus is being produced in the
[5838.76 - 5845.04] liver that the lymphatic system is is
[5841.52 - 5847.80] getting the the like the load the excess
[5845.04 - 5850.36] mucus and lymphatic drainage isn't going
[5847.80 - 5853.52] to cut it if you keep on dumping all of
[5850.36 - 5855.36] this stuff these mucus forming Foods
[5853.52 - 5857.96] mucus forming Foods because pathogens
[5855.36 - 5859.92] are feeding on these
[5857.96 - 5861.48] foods and that's a big reason why
[5859.92 - 5863.64] they're mucus forming because pathogens
[5861.48 - 5865.04] feed on these Foods it's a big part of
[5863.64 - 5867.40] it and then the byproduct from the
[5865.04 - 5869.60] pathogens and man when this white lung
[5867.40 - 5871.88] comes through and it's it's hitting the
[5869.60 - 5873.68] cities now and everybody is coughing
[5871.88 - 5876.32] their chest is tight they're all walking
[5873.68 - 5878.08] around with walking pneumonia and then
[5876.32 - 5880.20] they go and they eat a slice of pizza
[5878.08 - 5883.04] they go and they eat two scrambled eggs
[5880.20 - 5884.16] they go and they have right some cheese
[5883.04 - 5886.28] on a
[5884.16 - 5887.84] burger if you want to be an animal
[5886.28 - 5891.24] animal protein
[5887.84 - 5894.24] person keep the dairy products
[5891.24 - 5896.48] out keep even the pork out way too high
[5894.24 - 5896.48] in
[5896.88 - 5902.12] fat
[5898.80 - 5905.00] right keep the eggs out keep the milks
[5902.12 - 5910.00] out keep the goat cheese out keep the
[5905.00 - 5912.36] kefir out all those things gone keep the
[5910.00 - 5914.52] way out keep just anything related keep
[5912.36 - 5917.84] the colostrum
[5914.52 - 5920.04] out yuck colostrum does nothing for our
[5917.84 - 5921.32] immune system by the way it's probably
[5920.04 - 5925.16] one of the biggest
[5921.32 - 5927.48] scams in on the market for 20 years now
[5925.16 - 5929.48] is colostrum how many people tried that
[5927.48 - 5931.60] and they didn't get out of bed how many
[5929.48 - 5932.84] people tried colostrum and they couldn't
[5931.60 - 5935.12] get out of bed and
[5932.84 - 5936.76] recover that's this doesn't work but you
[5935.12 - 5938.80] don't want to be doing
[5936.76 - 5941.04] classroom when that's happening right
[5938.80 - 5942.36] there so I see all kinds of comments
[5941.04 - 5944.64] right there right
[5942.36 - 5948.16] now
[5944.64 - 5948.16] um hold on you

[6078.20 - 6086.28] system so much that Epstein bar Rises up
[6082.32 - 6090.64] up when Epstein bar Rises
[6086.28 - 6093.72] up okay it rises up in our system and it
[6090.64 - 6097.76] beats us down and we end up in

[6778.72 - 6782.64] second you
[6780.48 - 6785.00] guys one of the most devastating things
[6782.64 - 6787.08] I've seen with multiple sclerosis is
[6785.00 - 6788.88] they push high
[6787.08 - 6792.00] fat
[6788.88 - 6794.48] awful lowers the immune system doesn't
[6792.00 - 6797.20] help somebody
[6794.48 - 6798.76] heal and then they push the worse fats
[6797.20 - 6801.36] I'm not like
[6798.76 - 6802.68] anti-fat
[6801.36 - 6804.24] I mean avocado if you want to eat

[6811.96 - 6816.28] butter do a Little Nut Butter but I'm
[6813.76 - 6818.20] not against fats that's not it it's just
[6816.28 - 6820.08] that when you're really sick the fats
[6818.20 - 6821.60] they load up on you especially with
[6820.08 - 6824.00] multiple sclerosis or anything or any
[6821.60 - 6826.76] kind of condition are the worst fats and
[6824.00 - 6830.48] they and they load up too much of

[7108.16 - 7110.36] really
[7111.16 - 7116.04] sick meanwhile some of those same
[7113.96 - 7117.92] influencers use the medical medium
[7116.04 - 7120.40] information and then talk about
[7117.92 - 7122.88] medical medium out there on social while
[7120.40 - 7124.20] they're stealing the information oh my

[7171.72 - 7177.68] to find peace
[7174.36 - 7179.76] with some type of situation when we're
[7177.68 - 7182.64] leaving this planet our soul has to say
[7179.76 - 7185.00] you dumbass the you did and led
[7182.64 - 7186.60] people down the wrong way by cheating

[7195.56 - 7199.52] years down the road you have to come to
[7197.36 - 7201.03] terms with that and then the Angels come
[7199.52 - 7202.64] and say you

[7209.72 - 7213.36] chronically ill out there from getting
[7211.08 - 7215.72] the answers they need it doesn't work
[7213.36 - 7215.72] like
[7215.84 - 7221.44] that or what works like that all
[7223.56 - 7230.48] right

[7230.48 - 7236.88] that all right
[7232.92 - 7236.88] guys on that frightful
[7238.56 - 7242.40] note meanwhile if they just told people
[7240.80 - 7244.80] where the information came
[7242.40 - 7246.44] from and weren't so just like trying to
[7244.80 - 7248.44] build their Empires every second or
[7246.44 - 7249.84] cheat cheat and this and do that and
[7248.44 - 7251.56] they just had some integrity and they
[7249.84 - 7254.64] said
[7251.56 - 7255.92] look you're on mattress Island because I
[7254.64 - 7257.80] read in the medical meeting book and
[7255.92 - 7260.00] heard from one of his podcast that you
[7257.80 - 7263.84] got the epen bar and that guy was known
[7260.00 - 7266.56] as the epen bar guy he's the one that
[7263.84 - 7269.04] published m is even caused by epine bark
[7266.56 - 7272.76] go check out his stuff and heal man and
[7269.04 - 7276.76] after you heal maybe check out my stuff
[7272.76 - 7276.76] after but no they won't do
[7278.04 - 7282.40] that
[7279.84 - 7282.40] because they're sick
[7289.60 - 7295.56] bastards
[7291.92 - 7295.56] mhm that's right Jenny
[7297.60 - 7304.40] mac oh you want to hear a
[7300.72 - 7304.40] story you guys want to hear a
[7308.04 - 7313.36] story
[7309.92 - 7315.16] okay I know somebody
[7313.36 - 7320.36] personally
[7315.16 - 7320.36] right that was bedridden back in
[7320.84 - 7327.48] 2011 okay
[7324.56 - 7330.56] 2011 and they couldn't find
[7327.48 - 7333.48] answers so they went to a
[7330.56 - 7337.80] chiropractor a chiropractor that knew a
[7333.48 - 7342.48] little bit about alternative medicine in
[7337.80 - 7342.48] 2011 that chiropractor mentioned to
[7342.52 - 7348.76] them could be upstein
[7345.04 - 7351.16] bar but the chiropractor never mentioned
[7348.76 - 7353.92] where the chiropractor got that
[7351.16 - 7357.32] information that chiropractor never
[7353.92 - 7360.16] said that they were a client of medical
[7357.32 - 7363.60] mediums in
[7360.16 - 7366.64] 2011 and that to get you out of bed off
[7363.60 - 7367.96] of mattress Island you need to get a
[7366.64 - 7369.48] hold of that
[7367.96 - 7372.80] guy
[7369.48 - 7376.80] and start learning how to do
[7372.80 - 7378.88] it and then that person stayed bedridden
[7376.80 - 7383.20] because that chiropractor wouldn't tell
[7378.88 - 7387.00] them that they found out about epine bar
[7383.20 - 7387.00] from being a client to Medical
[7387.12 - 7392.88] medium yeah so that chiropractor though
[7390.52 - 7396.20] didn't want to lose Pride
[7392.88 - 7397.96] or ego or whatever the heck it was
[7396.20 - 7399.52] however you want to say it and didn't
[7397.96 - 7403.36] want to say to the person who was
[7399.52 - 7404.84] bedridden look I talked to a guy he
[7403.36 - 7406.68] knows all about what's going on with
[7404.84 - 7408.68] your nervous system and he knows all
[7406.68 - 7410.96] about what's going on with epen bar you
[7408.68 - 7413.40] need to at least try to contact him and
[7410.96 - 7415.44] if not contact him maybe I will because
[7413.40 - 7417.20] I'm a client of his and I'll contact him
[7415.44 - 7419.16] and tell him about your situation and
[7417.20 - 7421.44] maybe get some tips or something so I
[7419.16 - 7422.72] can work through you through him but no
[7421.44 - 7425.52] he didn't do that because this
[7422.72 - 7427.08] chiropractor did not want to fess up
[7425.52 - 7429.12] that he didn't know anything about what
[7427.08 - 7430.92] he was saying but he knew just enough to
[7429.12 - 7433.48] make it look like he knew something so
[7430.92 - 7436.08] the person who was sick in bed dying had
[7433.48 - 7438.44] no way to heal but guess what years
[7436.08 - 7440.56] later that person found me years later
[7438.44 - 7442.68] and told me personally what happened and
[7440.56 - 7445.76] told me the chiropractor's name which
[7442.68 - 7447.64] was a client of mine and it was so sad
[7445.76 - 7450.68] because the woman went through years of
[7447.64 - 7453.20] suffering I'm talking years of suffering
[7450.68 - 7455.00] she asked him several times what more
[7453.20 - 7457.96] could she do and he withheld the
[7455.00 - 7459.92] information about me and epin bar and
[7457.96 - 7462.76] all that I knew and even working through
[7459.92 - 7464.72] me to help her and that is how it works
[7462.76 - 7466.40] and that's just one example of the
[7464.72 - 7468.40] thousands that's happening right now
[7466.40 - 7470.88] with medical medum information because
[7468.40 - 7473.20] yeah because it's dark and dirty and the
[7470.88 - 7475.48] health movement's dirty and nasty and
[7473.20 - 7476.92] stinky and slimy and you see it every
[7475.48 - 7478.72] day from the people running the ads to
[7476.92 - 7479.96] the medical me Community you see it
[7478.72 - 7481.68] every day with them stealing the heavy
[7479.96 - 7482.92] metal detox information and the heavy
[7481.68 - 7485.72] metal information they would have never
[7482.92 - 7488.60] known you see it every day it's a gnarly
[7485.72 - 7490.00] gnarly gross disgusting world out there
[7488.60 - 7491.92] and people don't give a about The
[7490.00 - 7493.72] Chronic leil but they give a about
[7491.92 - 7495.48] the bottom line the money they make and
[7493.72 - 7496.72] they want to reel in The Chronic leil so
[7495.48 - 7498.60] they could sell them all their and
[7496.72 - 7501.60] programs and garbage and
[7498.60 - 7501.60] everything
[7502.12 - 7505.28] anyway all
[7507.36 - 7512.76] right and Harry says that was very evil
[7511.40 - 7516.28] it was very
[7512.76 - 7519.08] evil it's sad and it's unfair and what
[7516.28 - 7523.92] happened was this person believes that
[7519.08 - 7523.92] God LED them to the first
[7524.08 - 7528.44] book because that chiropractor didn't
[7526.88 - 7530.32] and that person suffered on mattress
[7528.44 - 7533.20] Island for another four
[7530.32 - 7535.44] years and they believe that the angels
[7533.20 - 7539.40] and God LED them to the first book and
[7535.44 - 7542.12] by chance somehow
[7539.40 - 7544.56] someway the door opened
[7542.12 - 7547.64] up and they were able to tell me at a
[7544.56 - 7550.24] live event at a live event when I was
[7547.64 - 7553.36] walking through that that event at a
[7550.24 - 7553.36] live medical medium
[7553.52 - 7557.76] concert in
[7559.24 - 7564.40] 2015 they were able to tell me in the
[7562.28 - 7567.84] spring of
[7564.40 - 7570.52] 2015 when I was live in
[7567.84 - 7572.72] Colorado in
[7570.52 - 7576.32] Denver they were able to tell me and
[7572.72 - 7580.04] stop me and say Mr William and I said
[7576.32 - 7583.12] what what cuz I'll talk to anybody I
[7580.04 - 7584.92] said what and they said Mr William I
[7583.12 - 7587.60] have to tell you a story and I said okay
[7584.92 - 7591.12] tell me that story and I sat down I was
[7587.60 - 7593.72] supposed to go live in 10 minutes and
[7591.12 - 7596.08] there was 3,000 people in the audience
[7593.72 - 7598.72] just to see me in
[7596.08 - 7601.84] 2015 place was packed tickets were sold
[7598.72 - 7603.72] out and I sat down I pulled a chair to
[7601.84 - 7606.36] the corner and I sat down with that
[7603.72 - 7608.56] person before going live and I saw
[7606.36 - 7610.40] people freaking out I saw the producer
[7608.56 - 7612.04] users freaking out I saw everybody
[7610.40 - 7614.56] freaking out saying what the hell are
[7612.04 - 7616.60] you doing talking to that person and I
[7614.56 - 7619.32] said just calm down I said wait calm
[7616.60 - 7621.28] down I want to hear this story and I sat
[7619.32 - 7624.16] down and I heard that whole story right
[7621.28 - 7626.48] there right there about what happened
[7624.16 - 7628.16] and that's how screwed up our world is
[7626.48 - 7630.16] meanwhile that chiropractor had an
[7628.16 - 7632.08] opportunity to do the right thing that
[7630.16 - 7633.84] person was led to that chiropractor to
[7632.08 - 7636.12] be led back to Medical
[7633.84 - 7638.88] medium and the chiropractor made the
[7636.12 - 7642.20] wrong choice and that choice is is on
[7638.88 - 7644.00] their soul just like I see
[7642.20 - 7645.28] chiropractors constantly like
[7644.00 - 7646.76] advertising to the medical medium
[7645.28 - 7649.00] Community using medical medium
[7646.76 - 7649.92] information but leading them to a whole
[7649.00 - 7653.36] bunch of
