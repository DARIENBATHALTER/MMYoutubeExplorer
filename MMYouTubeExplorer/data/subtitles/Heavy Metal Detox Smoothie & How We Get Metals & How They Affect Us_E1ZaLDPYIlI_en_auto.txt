[68.72 - 71.52] people
[69.44 - 73.28] we're talking reversing serious

[83.36 - 87.76] about mild ocd
[85.44 - 89.44] where your thoughts are just compulsive
[87.76 - 91.04] and i'm talking about where you feel
[89.44 - 93.36] like you have to act on those
[91.04 - 95.92] compulsions to such an extreme
[93.36 - 96.96] it completely invades your life takes
[95.92 - 99.12] over your life
[96.96 - 101.28] and then you're trapped i'm talking
[99.12 - 104.40] about that kind of ocd the ocd that
[101.28 - 106.56] helped thousands over the years overcome
[104.40 - 108.32] the heavy metal detox smoothie is a big
[106.56 - 110.32] part of this right here including
[108.32 - 112.16] helping people with tourettes the
[110.32 - 113.28] medical medium heavy metal detox movie
[112.16 - 117.28] has reversed
[113.28 - 121.60] people's tourette's conditions autism
[117.28 - 125.04] um adhd esophagus
[121.60 - 128.56] spasms ticks spasms twitches
[125.04 - 131.28] sleeping disorders insomnia okay
[128.56 - 131.92] and schizophrenia i mean it's helped
[131.28 - 135.12] people
[131.92 - 137.16] on all levels ptsd not just anxiety
[135.12 - 138.48] depression but also ptsd
[137.16 - 141.84] depersonalization
[138.48 - 142.88] focus and concentration memory issues
[141.84 - 144.56] alzheimer's
[142.88 - 146.48] the medical medium heavy metal detox
[144.56 - 149.36] smoothie has reversed
[146.48 - 149.84] people's conditions such as alzheimer's
[149.36 - 152.48] bringing
[149.84 - 154.24] people back where people can actually
[152.48 - 157.28] know their name again
[154.24 - 160.24] that's the power this has and that's
[157.28 - 163.76] what this has a track record of doing
[160.24 - 164.08] and then the heavy metal detox smoothie
[163.76 - 168.00] has
[164.08 - 170.64] never been better it's at the point now
[168.00 - 172.08] where the ingredients are perfected what
[170.64 - 174.88] i mean by that
[172.08 - 175.84] is i haven't had a chance until pretty
[174.88 - 178.96] recently
[175.84 - 181.04] for the best spirulina and for the best
[178.96 - 181.44] barley grass juice powder that you can
[181.04 - 184.08] ever
[181.44 - 186.00] use in a heavy metal detox smoothie and
[184.08 - 188.24] that played a big role because
[186.00 - 189.44] over the years i've had to use inferior
[188.24 - 191.60] spirulinas
[189.44 - 193.04] i've had to use inferior barley grass
[191.60 - 195.76] juice powders
[193.04 - 197.44] and i even had to use barley grass
[195.76 - 198.00] before we can get a barley grass juice
[197.44 - 200.40] powder out
[198.00 - 201.76] there so the heavy so what happens is
[200.40 - 204.40] when i was younger
[201.76 - 204.96] spirit of compassion told me when i was
[204.40 - 207.20] seven
[204.96 - 208.88] eight years old nine years old about the
[207.20 - 209.68] medical medium heavy metal detox
[208.88 - 212.08] smoothie
[209.68 - 212.96] and what the ingredients were and how to
[212.08 - 215.84] use them
[212.96 - 217.92] but it was hard to get the ingredients
[215.84 - 218.80] it was hard to get the wild blueberry at
[217.92 - 221.04] that time
[218.80 - 222.96] it was hard to get a spirulina that was
[221.04 - 225.20] worthy it was hard to get
[222.96 - 227.28] a barley grass that was worthy it was
[225.20 - 230.48] hard to get anything really
[227.28 - 231.52] and so as the years gone by and i can
[230.48 - 234.08] get the best
[231.52 - 236.24] ingredients to actually make it work up
[234.08 - 239.12] to the standard of spirit and compassion
[236.24 - 240.64] where it originated and it started
[239.12 - 241.84] medical medium book one as far as
[240.64 - 243.52] published here
[241.84 - 246.16] even though i was using it years before
[243.52 - 248.16] this and this is the medical media book
[246.16 - 249.60] new edition revise and expand you guys
[248.16 - 250.32] got to check this book out your mind
[249.60 - 254.16] will be blown
[250.32 - 255.84] it's a whole new book in this um
[254.16 - 258.32] so i'm giving you a little bit of
[255.84 - 261.12] history of the heavy metal detox movie
[258.32 - 262.40] showing you the ropes about that how it
[261.12 - 263.60] works you're going to get the whole
[262.40 - 265.12] thing today about
[263.60 - 266.72] the power it has i'm going to make it
[265.12 - 268.00] for us right here i'm going to talk
[266.72 - 269.84] about things i don't normally talk
[268.00 - 272.32] about within the heavy metal detox
[269.84 - 274.72] smoothie too so that's exciting
[272.32 - 276.00] so right now the medical medium heavy
[274.72 - 280.00] metal detox smoothie
[276.00 - 281.84] is at its most powerful because
[280.00 - 283.44] i got the wild blueberries i use the
[281.84 - 285.84] weinman's wild blueberries
[283.44 - 288.00] but i got that right there and i got the
[285.84 - 288.64] vimergy spirulina barley grass juice
[288.00 - 292.40] powder
[288.64 - 293.60] so it's never been so powerful with the
[292.40 - 296.88] best ingredients
[293.60 - 299.52] there are to date and what that means is
[296.88 - 300.80] even speedier more speedier recoveries
[299.52 - 303.60] of anxiety
[300.80 - 304.84] speedier recoveries of depression
[303.60 - 307.84] bipolar
[304.84 - 311.28] depersonalization ocd okay
[307.84 - 314.80] ptsd alzheimer's dementia
[311.28 - 317.60] parkinson's disease speeder recoveries
[314.80 - 318.40] parkinson's and there's never been
[317.60 - 320.16] anything
[318.40 - 322.24] out there to reverse somebody's
[320.16 - 323.28] parkinson's to reverse somebody's
[322.24 - 325.76] alzheimer's
[323.28 - 326.96] to reverse somebody's memory loss to
[325.76 - 330.64] reverse somebody's
[326.96 - 332.16] ocd condition tourette's condition okay
[330.64 - 334.24] to reverse any of this there's never
[332.16 - 335.68] been anything out there okay you take a
[334.24 - 336.72] drug and you hope that it kind of
[335.68 - 339.36] minimizes it
[336.72 - 340.08] that's the best it does okay that's all
[339.36 - 342.80] you can do
[340.08 - 344.64] and even gastroparesis can be toxic
[342.80 - 347.28] heavy metals at times
[344.64 - 348.32] so and that has been reversed in a lot
[347.28 - 350.48] of different people
[348.32 - 352.48] over the years when doing the medical
[350.48 - 354.08] medium heavy metal detox smoothie
[352.48 - 356.32] because you're dealing with the nervous
[354.08 - 358.48] system versus a nervous system
[356.32 - 359.92] gastroparesis with toxic heavy metals
[358.48 - 363.28] affecting those nerves
[359.92 - 366.40] so we've never been in a place now
[363.28 - 368.48] where it's been so perfect and the
[366.40 - 371.68] opportunity to heal
[368.48 - 373.04] a condition and this is just
[371.68 - 374.80] the these are just some of the
[373.04 - 377.36] conditions i'm talking about
[374.80 - 378.64] this heavy metal detox smoothie is
[377.36 - 382.24] instrumental
[378.64 - 384.88] with chronic viral conditions you guys
[382.24 - 385.92] epstein-barr related and caused
[384.88 - 388.00] conditions
[385.92 - 389.84] hashimoto's thyroiditis heavy metal
[388.00 - 392.56] detox smoothie it's critical
[389.84 - 394.24] all right fibromyalgia critical pots
[392.56 - 397.52] critical renault syndrome
[394.24 - 397.84] critical okay and these are just some
[397.52 - 401.52] things
[397.84 - 403.44] eczema and psoriasis the reason people
[401.52 - 405.12] in the medical medium community all
[403.44 - 405.92] right are reversing their excellent
[405.12 - 408.40] psoriasis
[405.92 - 410.56] for decades now getting rid of just
[408.40 - 412.08] thousands and thousands of cases of
[410.56 - 414.56] excellent psoriasis
[412.08 - 416.32] and dermatitis and vitiligo and other
[414.56 - 418.00] conditions like that and rosacea
[416.32 - 419.68] is because they've used the medical
[418.00 - 422.32] medium heavy metal detox smoothie and
[419.68 - 425.28] they've gotten the metals out which
[422.32 - 427.04] took metals away from viruses and
[425.28 - 430.16] pathogens
[427.04 - 433.60] toxic heavy metals are in everybody they
[430.16 - 436.72] are the food that feeds the bugs
[433.60 - 440.24] see guys metals feed
[436.72 - 442.88] bugs that's how it works right and so
[440.24 - 444.00] to get the metals out and get large
[442.88 - 446.96] quantities of
[444.00 - 448.40] metals out of the body you need a
[446.96 - 451.12] powerful tool
[448.40 - 451.84] a powerful weapon and something that
[451.12 - 453.76] works
[451.84 - 455.52] now be different if i was sitting here
[453.76 - 456.56] saying well you know i don't know what
[455.52 - 458.24] science says
[456.56 - 460.00] and i don't know what works or doesn't
[458.24 - 460.64] maybe collagen could work maybe it
[460.00 - 462.80] doesn't
[460.64 - 464.00] maybe charcoal works and it doesn't
[462.80 - 465.68] maybe something else but
[464.00 - 467.68] here's the deal and here's the
[465.68 - 468.40] difference there's already a track
[467.68 - 471.52] record
[468.40 - 472.40] there's already a proven factual track
[471.52 - 475.52] record
[472.40 - 476.40] street cred that this heavy metal detox
[475.52 - 479.68] smoothie
[476.40 - 482.00] has reverse conditions even save lives
[479.68 - 485.08] got people's lives better and that right
[482.00 - 487.68] there is indisputable
[485.08 - 490.48] indisputable right there
[487.68 - 492.48] so i'm gonna make this for you i'm gonna
[490.48 - 494.16] talk about where we get our toxic heavy
[492.48 - 495.92] metals where do they come from
[494.16 - 497.44] how do we get them how do they enter the
[495.92 - 500.80] body what
[497.44 - 502.88] forms okay and i'm going to talk about
[500.80 - 505.20] the best way to make it using the best
[502.88 - 508.56] stuff that's the stuff i use
[505.20 - 510.88] now it matters if i'm using something
[508.56 - 512.80] because that means it's the best and
[510.88 - 513.84] that matters to the people who know me
[512.80 - 516.40] my friends
[513.84 - 517.76] my family anybody who knows of me and
[516.40 - 519.76] wants to try something
[517.76 - 521.76] knowing that i'm using something they're
[519.76 - 524.80] like okay well that's the best one
[521.76 - 528.24] why would he put something in him
[524.80 - 529.84] that's not the best and so
[528.24 - 531.28] and this medical medium heavy metal
[529.84 - 534.64] detox smoothie is
[531.28 - 536.32] at its epic height of perfection at this
[534.64 - 538.88] point in time in history
[536.32 - 539.84] because i've been blessed to discover
[538.88 - 542.40] and find
[539.84 - 543.36] products that actually take it to the
[542.40 - 546.56] next level
[543.36 - 547.52] because i've had to suffer with inferior
[546.56 - 549.60] products
[547.52 - 551.04] in spirit of compassion's heavy metal
[549.60 - 553.52] detox smoothie
[551.04 - 554.40] and that's been a problem so over the
[553.52 - 556.88] years
[554.40 - 558.24] i've had to use a pacific pacific
[556.88 - 561.28] spirulina
[558.24 - 564.00] and it was okay it was as good as you
[561.28 - 565.76] can get at the time many years ago right
[564.00 - 568.32] and then when something came along
[565.76 - 570.56] better i was able to dump that
[568.32 - 571.68] and move on to something that was so
[570.56 - 574.24] much better
[571.68 - 575.68] the same thing with dolls and the same
[574.24 - 576.00] thing with other things i was able to
[575.68 - 579.44] move
[576.00 - 582.56] on and get the best stuff out there
[579.44 - 586.16] that there is to make this that epic
[582.56 - 587.36] level of healing the taking it to its
[586.16 - 589.76] full capacity
[587.36 - 591.04] to get somebody better to get somebody
[589.76 - 593.12] out of bed
[591.04 - 595.12] to get them recovered to get them
[593.12 - 596.96] healing to get their life back
[595.12 - 598.96] to get rid of that crippling anxiety
[596.96 - 601.60] that severe depression
[598.96 - 603.44] and get their memory back get rid of
[601.60 - 604.00] that depersonalization and that's just
[603.44 - 605.84] some of the
[604.00 - 607.76] things the medical medium heavy metal
[605.84 - 610.88] detox smoothie has done
[607.76 - 613.28] and so it's come to a point now
[610.88 - 614.40] where unless something comes out there
[613.28 - 616.88] that's better
[614.40 - 618.56] than like what i'm holding in my hand as
[616.88 - 620.72] far as the ingredients you see
[618.56 - 622.00] as far as the beemergy spirulina and
[620.72 - 624.40] barley grass until
[622.00 - 625.84] something comes someday that would be a
[624.40 - 628.08] different story right now that's the
[625.84 - 629.36] best and this is at this epic place
[628.08 - 631.28] i see something right there from cheryl
[629.36 - 632.72] what would cause high level of arsenic
[631.28 - 635.04] other than rice
[632.72 - 636.80] apple was recently tested for heavy
[635.04 - 639.68] metals and arsenic was
[636.80 - 640.56] only one only one that was high please
[639.68 - 643.20] advise
[640.56 - 644.08] arsenic's in water so where's your water
[643.20 - 645.68] supply
[644.08 - 647.44] what's going on with that what's your
[645.68 - 649.60] water supply in your body
[647.44 - 650.56] keep that in mind arsenic can be in
[649.60 - 653.92] pipes
[650.56 - 656.96] so it's another thing too they have made
[653.92 - 659.60] uh solder in all the pipes that had
[656.96 - 660.56] arsenic in it so in all your plumbing
[659.60 - 662.48] pipes
[660.56 - 664.00] if you got a well your well pump can
[662.48 - 666.80] have arsenic in it
[664.00 - 668.64] there's arsenic in soil too and i'll
[666.80 - 671.12] talk about that in a little bit too
[668.64 - 672.40] so are you gardening in your garden are
[671.12 - 674.56] the farms you're eating
[672.40 - 676.24] local food that you're eating local
[674.56 - 678.00] because a lot of farms use water
[676.24 - 679.28] supplies that have arsenic in it and i'm
[678.00 - 680.56] not talking about conventional talk
[679.28 - 683.84] about organic
[680.56 - 684.48] so arsenic's high in all organic food
[683.84 - 687.20] out there
[684.48 - 688.48] so keep that in mind too so organic food
[687.20 - 691.04] has arsenic because
[688.48 - 693.20] organic all kinds of organic food grown
[691.04 - 695.20] they use water they have to pump in and
[693.20 - 697.68] they don't test that water
[695.20 - 699.76] and they pump that in and so and
[697.68 - 701.92] non-organic foods really high
[699.76 - 703.28] in arsenic so those are things there too
[701.92 - 705.52] we also breathe it in
[703.28 - 706.64] it drops out of the sky it comes from
[705.52 - 709.44] different areas
[706.64 - 710.88] and if you have farms conventional farms
[709.44 - 713.20] nearby
[710.88 - 714.24] arsenic is in pesticides herbicides
[713.20 - 715.84] fungicides
[714.24 - 717.52] so keep that in mind too it's in
[715.84 - 720.48] herbicides pesticides
[717.52 - 722.00] fungicides it's on new clothing so if
[720.48 - 724.72] you buy a new clothing
[722.00 - 726.24] it's fresh on the clothing arsenic's in
[724.72 - 728.56] grass-fed beef
[726.24 - 729.28] very high in grass-fed beef it's high in
[728.56 - 732.24] lamb
[729.28 - 732.88] it's high in and so it's out there and
[732.24 - 734.16] that
[732.88 - 736.32] that question is really important
[734.16 - 737.28] because it leads me to the part i want
[736.32 - 740.48] to talk about
[737.28 - 743.20] is we have toxic heavy metals everywhere
[740.48 - 744.32] and they have completely invaded our
[743.20 - 747.20] lives
[744.32 - 748.00] at this point in time so it's important
[747.20 - 750.16] to know
[748.00 - 751.20] like where they come from and how to
[750.16 - 754.08] defend ourselves
[751.20 - 755.04] and one way to defend ourselves is using
[754.08 - 758.96] a tool
[755.04 - 761.44] that has already worked for years
[758.96 - 762.48] tool that doctors have been using for
[761.44 - 764.08] their patients for
[762.48 - 766.08] decades when i've been teaching about
[764.08 - 768.40] the heavy metal detox smoothie
[766.08 - 770.24] and it's critical it's not just about
[768.40 - 771.12] hey have a little garlic that removes
[770.24 - 773.28] some metals or
[771.12 - 774.40] make something up like some people have
[773.28 - 775.68] out there that
[774.40 - 777.52] you know they'll say oh this helps
[775.68 - 780.88] remove metals apple cider vinegar
[777.52 - 781.52] can help move metals no it can't acv
[780.88 - 784.56] doesn't
[781.52 - 787.44] but it takes a combination
[784.56 - 788.40] that i've been given from my source
[787.44 - 791.60] starting
[788.40 - 794.88] as a child and then watching it
[791.60 - 797.92] bring lives back get people
[794.88 - 798.88] out of mattress island get people out of
[797.92 - 801.76] hell
[798.88 - 802.32] to get rise out of the ashes and it's
[801.76 - 805.52] not just
[802.32 - 808.80] one person it's not just my
[805.52 - 809.92] neighbor back 30 years ago who couldn't
[808.80 - 811.76] walk
[809.92 - 813.12] because of toxic heavy metal poisoning
[811.76 - 815.12] and nobody knew
[813.12 - 816.16] and then spirit of compassion knew and
[815.12 - 818.88] then had
[816.16 - 820.80] her do the heavy metal detox movie and
[818.88 - 821.36] she was walking fine and got her life
[820.80 - 824.72] back
[821.36 - 826.80] it goes back it's historic it's not like
[824.72 - 828.56] hey uh what's what what's this guy
[826.80 - 830.32] selling over here what's this apple
[828.56 - 833.04] cider vinegar chewie's now
[830.32 - 833.36] what is this a collagen powder now it's
[833.04 - 836.80] not
[833.36 - 837.20] bs that's just bs out there that clogs
[836.80 - 839.44] up
[837.20 - 840.24] the airways for everybody to get just in
[839.44 - 842.08] and out of and
[840.24 - 844.16] suck into and all that and get suckered
[842.08 - 848.00] into and
[844.16 - 851.28] this has historic history
[848.00 - 854.00] of working for doctors of
[851.28 - 855.52] getting alzheimer's patients walking and
[854.00 - 857.28] talking again
[855.52 - 859.60] getting people out of crippling
[857.28 - 860.40] depression where they were literally
[859.60 - 863.76] seized up
[860.40 - 867.12] in their bed rolling around and dying
[863.76 - 870.32] from depression and having them sip
[867.12 - 872.24] this and move out of it getting rid of
[870.32 - 874.16] debilitating migraines that were toxic
[872.24 - 876.48] heavy metal caused
[874.16 - 877.68] eyesight problems people that were
[876.48 - 880.56] half-blind
[877.68 - 881.68] for no reason three-quarters blind for
[880.56 - 885.04] no reason
[881.68 - 886.16] got their sight back because of this
[885.04 - 888.16] right here
[886.16 - 889.60] so it's not like oh what's anthony doing
[888.16 - 891.20] what's anthony william doing he's doing
[889.60 - 893.12] his heavy metal detox smoothie that's
[891.20 - 893.84] cool is that like the acv gummy bites
[893.12 - 895.92] out there
[893.84 - 897.60] or is that like you know something
[895.92 - 899.12] stupid like mushroom coffee where you're
[897.60 - 900.64] just you know that the drug dealers are
[899.12 - 902.08] selling every day now that just get
[900.64 - 903.12] people high in coffee and then throw
[902.08 - 905.44] something in there
[903.12 - 906.40] you know it's it's that's not it this is
[905.44 - 908.72] before
[906.40 - 910.08] people's time like people that got into
[908.72 - 912.64] health four years ago
[910.08 - 913.20] three years ago people that got into
[912.64 - 915.12] health
[913.20 - 917.60] 10 years ago this is way before that
[915.12 - 921.28] time this has more integrity
[917.60 - 924.48] more merit more historic
[921.28 - 925.28] truth of people crawling back from
[924.48 - 927.60] sickness
[925.28 - 930.40] than anything else out there that you
[927.60 - 934.40] can buy or find or do or what
[930.40 - 937.28] this is reverse epilepsy in children
[934.40 - 940.00] this has stopped many forms of seizures
[937.28 - 941.36] caused by toxic heavy metals now one
[940.00 - 944.48] thing i'm going to tell you
[941.36 - 945.68] is science research didn't know and
[944.48 - 947.20] still doesn't
[945.68 - 949.12] that all these conditions i mentioned to
[947.20 - 950.16] you guys just now are caused by toxic
[949.12 - 951.44] heavy metals
[950.16 - 953.20] but they're starting to figure out and
[951.44 - 954.56] they're starting to take it the
[953.20 - 956.32] information's starting to get out there
[954.56 - 958.24] because of the medical medium books
[956.32 - 959.36] one is the medical medium new edition
[958.24 - 960.72] but not the new addition but the
[959.36 - 962.80] original and this is the new edition you
[960.72 - 965.36] guys should check this out when you can
[962.80 - 966.16] um that's a question i love right there
[965.36 - 969.20] michaela says
[966.16 - 971.76] how come you need glasses just curious
[969.20 - 972.48] okay if you learn the history of medical
[971.76 - 974.96] medium
[972.48 - 976.24] you might want to get this right here
[974.96 - 978.56] okay
[976.24 - 980.48] the origins of a medical medium read
[978.56 - 982.48] this chapter out of the new edition
[980.48 - 983.76] so you can learn okay what happened
[982.48 - 985.84] since i was age four
[983.76 - 987.12] because of having to do readings on
[985.84 - 989.52] people having to
[987.12 - 991.36] see what's wrong inside their body i
[989.52 - 993.76] spent 30 years
[991.36 - 994.64] working with people one-on-one over 250
[993.76 - 996.88] 000 people
[994.64 - 998.40] over the last 30 years before publishing
[996.88 - 1001.20] the medical medium books
[998.40 - 1001.84] and with that comes a price the price is
[1001.20 - 1003.84] i get
[1001.84 - 1005.68] what's called snow blindness i've talked
[1003.84 - 1006.96] about in the books i've lectured about
[1005.68 - 1009.52] it for years
[1006.96 - 1011.20] it's what spirit of compassion does
[1009.52 - 1013.92] sends down a light
[1011.20 - 1016.48] makes it difficult for me to see in the
[1013.92 - 1018.32] moment because all i see is your organs
[1016.48 - 1020.24] i'll see your liver i'll see your
[1018.32 - 1021.44] pancreas i'll see your intestinal tract
[1020.24 - 1023.44] i'll see your brain
[1021.44 - 1025.28] i'll see your bloodstream i'll see
[1023.44 - 1027.52] viruses inside your body
[1025.28 - 1030.00] wherever spirit of compassion tea has
[1027.52 - 1030.56] has given me the gift and the sight to
[1030.00 - 1033.28] see
[1030.56 - 1035.52] but that white light is very blinding
[1033.28 - 1038.72] and what it does is it makes me squint
[1035.52 - 1039.84] now when i'm at home when i'm around
[1038.72 - 1042.40] some friends
[1039.84 - 1042.96] when i'm actually you know around uh you
[1042.40 - 1045.52] know maybe
[1042.96 - 1046.96] my family i don't use the glasses
[1045.52 - 1048.96] glasses just go away
[1046.96 - 1050.48] the reason why is because they know that
[1048.96 - 1052.16] if white light comes
[1050.48 - 1054.08] because i'm doing a read when i don't
[1052.16 - 1055.52] want to because information is coming
[1054.08 - 1057.76] down from spirit of compassion
[1055.52 - 1058.96] they know i'll squint one eye i'll start
[1057.76 - 1061.52] to squint one eye
[1058.96 - 1062.72] is what i'll do and when i do that
[1061.52 - 1064.80] they'll know what it is
[1062.72 - 1066.32] but you guys may not because when you're
[1064.80 - 1067.76] all here spirit of compassion is talking
[1066.32 - 1068.64] to me because i'm getting information
[1067.76 - 1071.28] about you guys
[1068.64 - 1071.84] all while we're doing this so anyway
[1071.28 - 1075.04] that's
[1071.84 - 1077.12] that's what it is right there um
[1075.04 - 1079.36] so you know so i can take off the
[1077.12 - 1081.60] glasses and see perfectly fine like i've
[1079.36 - 1083.76] done here on lives and so forth so
[1081.60 - 1085.60] but it's there so that you guys can't
[1083.76 - 1088.64] tell that i'm squinting
[1085.60 - 1091.28] after a while from the white light but
[1088.64 - 1091.92] either way i mean i don't know what else
[1091.28 - 1094.00] to say
[1091.92 - 1095.76] but other than that if you're not happy
[1094.00 - 1096.56] i wear glasses i don't know what to tell
[1095.76 - 1099.68] you guys
[1096.56 - 1100.64] i really don't know um so we'll go back
[1099.68 - 1103.60] to
[1100.64 - 1104.80] go back to what the heavy metal detox
[1103.60 - 1107.52] smoothie has done
[1104.80 - 1108.80] it has saved lives that's the key and it
[1107.52 - 1110.56] matters
[1108.80 - 1111.84] fern says i stopped coffee and have
[1110.56 - 1114.48] never felt
[1111.84 - 1114.96] better because of you i'm honored you
[1114.48 - 1117.28] did
[1114.96 - 1118.64] i'm proud of you it matters that's
[1117.28 - 1120.56] today's heroine
[1118.64 - 1122.40] so it's good that you stopped it because
[1120.56 - 1124.32] that's that's today's crack
[1122.40 - 1125.68] cocaine really the industry has
[1124.32 - 1128.00] everybody on it
[1125.68 - 1130.00] every single person uses it everything
[1128.00 - 1132.00] from trainers to nutritionists to
[1130.00 - 1132.80] healers to doctors whoever it is they're
[1132.00 - 1135.20] all high on
[1132.80 - 1136.96] high in caffeine everybody's jacked up
[1135.20 - 1138.96] on it and everybody's telling everybody
[1136.96 - 1140.56] it's okay to drink it and okay to eat it
[1138.96 - 1141.92] and okay to have it in your life and eat
[1140.56 - 1142.56] lots of chocolate i'll talk about that a
[1141.92 - 1144.88] little bit
[1142.56 - 1146.40] so i want to talk about where we get our
[1144.88 - 1147.60] battles before we start so you guys if
[1146.40 - 1150.64] you just got on here
[1147.60 - 1151.12] talking about how this heavy metal detox
[1150.64 - 1152.96] movie
[1151.12 - 1154.56] has been around for what quite a while
[1152.96 - 1157.68] now it's reversed
[1154.56 - 1159.04] tens of thousands hundreds of thousands
[1157.68 - 1162.40] of people's conditions
[1159.04 - 1164.64] got their lives back and that matters
[1162.40 - 1166.80] because nothing else did that out there
[1164.64 - 1168.56] butter in your coffee didn't and nothing
[1166.80 - 1170.96] else does out there so
[1168.56 - 1172.80] it's really the difference between when
[1170.96 - 1174.96] you're really sick versus
[1172.80 - 1176.40] you're not so sick and you're trying
[1174.96 - 1177.84] cute little things out there and you're
[1176.40 - 1179.44] hanging in there and you're trying a
[1177.84 - 1181.12] little stuff and your acne almost goes
[1179.44 - 1182.96] away it doesn't and things come back and
[1181.12 - 1185.76] you're feeling okay you're working out
[1182.96 - 1187.68] that's different than sick in bed you're
[1185.76 - 1190.88] shaking and tremoring
[1187.68 - 1192.24] okay you're you've got dizziness vertigo
[1190.88 - 1193.76] tinnitus
[1192.24 - 1195.36] you got fatigue with the point you can't
[1193.76 - 1196.56] take your kids to school
[1195.36 - 1198.88] and you're getting an autoimmune
[1196.56 - 1201.28] diagnosis left and right everywhere
[1198.88 - 1201.92] and no one even believes you're sick
[1201.28 - 1203.28] anymore
[1201.92 - 1204.72] because you've been sick so long and
[1203.28 - 1205.52] you're laying in bed they start thinking
[1204.72 - 1206.88] you're crazy
[1205.52 - 1208.96] i'm taking what people have been through
[1206.88 - 1212.16] hell and back that's what this
[1208.96 - 1214.88] has done is got people's lives back not
[1212.16 - 1216.40] the regular bs stuff or oh i went on a
[1214.88 - 1217.68] keto diet and it got me a little better
[1216.40 - 1220.72] and i lost a little weight
[1217.68 - 1222.80] now try being sick try being sick
[1220.72 - 1224.96] and going through something raging
[1222.80 - 1225.44] eczema taking over your body well guess
[1224.96 - 1228.00] what
[1225.44 - 1229.84] you're gonna need this ain't no keto
[1228.00 - 1230.88] diet out there gonna get rid of all that
[1229.84 - 1233.20] eczema
[1230.88 - 1235.36] and get rid of all that psoriasis and
[1233.20 - 1238.64] get you off all those steroids
[1235.36 - 1242.24] and it takes knowledge it takes
[1238.64 - 1245.60] tools and it takes a history of knowing
[1242.24 - 1249.20] it has worked already all of it together
[1245.60 - 1251.04] is good so um
[1249.20 - 1252.40] you guys keep in mind there's a lot of
[1251.04 - 1253.84] people out there with fake accounts that
[1252.40 - 1255.12] are pretending to be anthony williams
[1253.84 - 1256.88] pretending to be me
[1255.12 - 1258.72] so keep in mind they'll take a photo of
[1256.88 - 1260.16] me they'll take a screenshot or
[1258.72 - 1262.24] something like that and they'll
[1260.16 - 1263.92] they'll try to extort money out of you

[1317.44 - 1320.56] quality is is there's nothing like it
[1319.68 - 1322.56] and i got the one
[1320.56 - 1324.00] the spirulina not the hawaiian one i
[1322.56 - 1325.44] want to say that because people say well
[1324.00 - 1326.56] that must be the hawaiian one he talked
[1325.44 - 1329.36] about in his first book
[1326.56 - 1330.00] and like i said you know you can use
[1329.36 - 1331.92] that one
[1330.00 - 1334.16] you can use somebody else's spirulina
[1331.92 - 1334.96] you could use any spirulina you can find
[1334.16 - 1337.20] out there
[1334.96 - 1338.08] but this is the one i use and this is
[1337.20 - 1341.04] the best one
[1338.08 - 1343.04] out there to date very important and so
[1341.04 - 1344.72] when it comes down to removing toxic
[1343.04 - 1347.20] heavy metals
[1344.72 - 1349.44] you want to have the best stuff reason
[1347.20 - 1352.64] why i don't like pacific coast
[1349.44 - 1354.00] spirulina is because the ocean is
[1352.64 - 1357.12] polluted
[1354.00 - 1360.40] the highest heavy metals come from
[1357.12 - 1363.36] the west coast bottom line
[1360.40 - 1364.72] so the oceans in the west coast are
[1363.36 - 1366.80] polluted
[1364.72 - 1368.48] so if you're into surfing you're getting
[1366.80 - 1371.28] doused with toxic heavy metals
[1368.48 - 1372.80] on a high degree keep that in mind so
[1371.28 - 1374.72] you're getting doused with mercury
[1372.80 - 1375.92] getting dust with lead getting dust with
[1374.72 - 1379.20] aluminum can
[1375.92 - 1380.80] douse with arsenic so that's on the west
[1379.20 - 1383.92] coast in the west coast oceans
[1380.80 - 1386.64] so i don't like west coast derived
[1383.92 - 1387.12] products coming out of the ocean on any
[1386.64 - 1389.36] level
[1387.12 - 1391.76] it's why i don't like the pacific
[1389.36 - 1393.60] anymore like pacific spirulina
[1391.76 - 1395.68] i don't like any of that so that's
[1393.60 - 1398.64] number one right there you know
[1395.68 - 1399.12] at the time years and years ago the
[1398.64 - 1401.68] ocean
[1399.12 - 1402.64] on the west coast wasn't so bad it
[1401.68 - 1406.00] wasn't at
[1402.64 - 1409.04] this epic terrible pollution that
[1406.00 - 1410.64] it is today five years ago the west
[1409.04 - 1413.68] coast the ocean
[1410.64 - 1415.72] was less polluted than it is now right
[1413.68 - 1418.48] now it's
[1415.72 - 1421.60] historically dirty on a
[1418.48 - 1424.00] level no one can imagine the west coast
[1421.60 - 1424.64] so i'm letting you guys know five years
[1424.00 - 1428.16] ago
[1424.64 - 1428.56] seven years ago ten years ago it wasn't
[1428.16 - 1431.36] as
[1428.56 - 1432.48] bad and 15 years ago it wasn't that bad
[1431.36 - 1435.28] so as far as like
[1432.48 - 1435.92] a spirulina it's derived from the west
[1435.28 - 1437.44] coast
[1435.92 - 1439.20] it was the only thing out there at the
[1437.44 - 1442.40] time and it just
[1439.20 - 1444.24] did the job okay enough and then i had
[1442.40 - 1446.16] to wait for better ones to come along
[1444.24 - 1448.40] better ones so i would move to another
[1446.16 - 1450.40] one that was better than that one
[1448.40 - 1452.88] from you know a less polluted source and
[1450.40 - 1455.04] then another one and then finally
[1452.88 - 1457.20] i got the best one there ever was which
[1455.04 - 1458.00] is the vimergi spirulina so i'm giving
[1457.20 - 1460.32] you some history
[1458.00 - 1461.52] if you look back in my first book you'll
[1460.32 - 1464.96] see pacific
[1461.52 - 1468.64] spirulina but like i said the ocean
[1464.96 - 1469.36] was half as dirty as it is now now the
[1468.64 - 1472.24] west coast
[1469.36 - 1473.52] water is so bad people come out of there
[1472.24 - 1475.20] with infections
[1473.52 - 1477.60] they come out of there after swimming or
[1475.20 - 1479.36] surfing with infections
[1477.60 - 1480.96] whole another world it's changed in the
[1479.36 - 1482.40] last two three years letting you guys
[1480.96 - 1484.84] know
[1482.40 - 1486.16] uh let's see dr fonnemd good to see you
[1484.84 - 1489.60] here
[1486.16 - 1491.60] yep uh hawaii's in the pacific um
[1489.60 - 1493.28] so the spirulina is not as clean listen
[1491.60 - 1495.92] to what he's explaining
[1493.28 - 1497.28] so that's that's important to know right
[1495.92 - 1500.24] there all on its own
[1497.28 - 1500.88] and every little bit counts because it's
[1500.24 - 1503.36] death
[1500.88 - 1503.92] by a thousand cuts out there that's how
[1503.36 - 1507.76] it is
[1503.92 - 1509.36] so the goal for how how it works as far
[1507.76 - 1510.96] as the goal for darkness the goal for
[1509.36 - 1512.00] the industries the goal for chemical
[1510.96 - 1515.28] companies
[1512.00 - 1518.00] the goal for all of that is stab you
[1515.28 - 1519.92] a thousand times until finally
[1518.00 - 1523.12] everything goes wrong
[1519.92 - 1525.36] and medical medium information is about
[1523.12 - 1526.72] healing up every one of those stabs
[1525.36 - 1529.76] wherever we can
[1526.72 - 1532.80] it's about countering every little hit
[1529.76 - 1535.04] kick ding slash
[1532.80 - 1537.44] you know punch it's about countering
[1535.04 - 1539.20] every one of those so you have the tool
[1537.44 - 1540.72] to move forward you have the tool to
[1539.20 - 1542.24] heal and so
[1540.72 - 1544.96] let's talk about heavy metal exposure
[1542.24 - 1546.08] right now let's go in there a little bit
[1544.96 - 1547.60] and then we'll go into a couple other
[1546.08 - 1548.40] things too so you guys if you just got
[1547.60 - 1550.08] on here
[1548.40 - 1552.32] i'm talking about the vimergy which is
[1550.08 - 1554.00] the best products out to date right now
[1552.32 - 1555.44] talking about the frozen wild
[1554.00 - 1558.48] blueberries which is the best
[1555.44 - 1562.24] blueberries out there that's the wymans
[1558.48 - 1563.12] not sponsored and that's sponsored by
[1562.24 - 1564.96] vin
[1563.12 - 1566.64] got the cilantro right here got the
[1564.96 - 1568.48] bananas i actually want to eat a banana
[1566.64 - 1570.48] right now because i haven't eaten yet
[1568.48 - 1572.08] this afternoon i had some had some
[1570.48 - 1572.64] breakfast this morning i had the celery
[1572.08 - 1575.20] juice
[1572.64 - 1576.64] already had one of these but i haven't
[1575.20 - 1577.68] eaten anything for lunch today it's
[1576.64 - 1580.08] getting late
[1577.68 - 1581.20] so i'm hungry for this i can't wait um
[1580.08 - 1582.40] so let's talk about where we're gonna
[1581.20 - 1584.64] get toxic heavy metals
[1582.40 - 1586.24] all kinds of sources soda cans if you
[1584.64 - 1588.48] guys ever touched a soda can
[1586.24 - 1589.36] you don't have to drink soda all you
[1588.48 - 1590.96] need is
[1589.36 - 1592.56] a family member or a friend to be like
[1590.96 - 1594.72] hey can you grab me that soda
[1592.56 - 1597.36] and you just grab it and you bring it
[1594.72 - 1601.04] over you just got aluminum in your body
[1597.36 - 1604.24] the oil in your skin draws
[1601.04 - 1607.44] metals in that's all just
[1604.24 - 1611.04] touch metal with your hands
[1607.44 - 1613.20] and you now own it you own that metal
[1611.04 - 1614.56] bottom line that's okay we don't have to
[1613.20 - 1617.60] be afraid
[1614.56 - 1618.56] we just need to actually be able to get
[1617.60 - 1620.96] it out of us
[1618.56 - 1622.08] faster than it's coming in get the
[1620.96 - 1624.64] metals out
[1622.08 - 1626.64] faster than they come in that's the key
[1624.64 - 1629.76] alexandra sofia is here
[1626.64 - 1631.12] please have a banana she said so um we
[1629.76 - 1634.16] breathe in metals
[1631.12 - 1636.64] too every day every minute
[1634.16 - 1638.16] and every hour they come off of your
[1636.64 - 1640.24] couches
[1638.16 - 1641.92] they come out of the formaldehyde that's
[1640.24 - 1645.20] on your furniture
[1641.92 - 1646.80] they come out of your bed toxic heavy
[1645.20 - 1649.84] and metals
[1646.80 - 1654.32] come out of our mattresses
[1649.84 - 1657.28] okay they come out of everything we use
[1654.32 - 1658.00] i use metal utensils i also use wood one
[1657.28 - 1660.48] too woods
[1658.00 - 1661.04] wood ones too but i use metal ones but i
[1660.48 - 1663.76] know
[1661.04 - 1665.84] that i'm getting that out of me easily
[1663.76 - 1668.32] with the heavy metal detox smoothie
[1665.84 - 1670.08] i know i'm getting rid of more than
[1668.32 - 1672.32] what's coming in
[1670.08 - 1674.16] porn to know pots and pans i use
[1672.32 - 1676.48] stainless steel uh cookware
[1674.16 - 1678.48] i do sometimes i do i've got this really
[1676.48 - 1679.12] killer stainless steel soup pot it's
[1678.48 - 1681.28] really big
[1679.12 - 1682.72] i like to use it it fills up really high
[1681.28 - 1685.92] could feed my whole family
[1682.72 - 1687.04] can make a big suit but we can get metal
[1685.92 - 1690.96] out of us
[1687.04 - 1694.56] more and faster than any coming in
[1690.96 - 1696.16] see how it works and that matters
[1694.56 - 1698.24] okay fluoride treatments did you guys
[1696.16 - 1700.88] ever have a fluoride treatment
[1698.24 - 1701.76] because guess what that aluminum never
[1700.88 - 1704.88] left
[1701.76 - 1706.56] it's in you if you're not doing the
[1704.88 - 1709.36] heavy metal detox smoothie
[1706.56 - 1710.00] you're not getting it out there's toxic
[1709.36 - 1713.28] heavy metals
[1710.00 - 1716.32] in the soil every carrot you eat
[1713.28 - 1717.28] every organic carrot every organic
[1716.32 - 1719.76] broccoli
[1717.28 - 1721.12] every organic cauliflower every organic
[1719.76 - 1724.88] green bean
[1721.12 - 1728.32] every organic fruit every organic herb
[1724.88 - 1731.36] all your grass-fed meat all has
[1728.32 - 1734.72] toxic heavy metals in it you hear that
[1731.36 - 1737.28] organic organic everybody
[1734.72 - 1738.96] has toxic heavy metals in it it's got
[1737.28 - 1743.12] arsenic lead aluminum
[1738.96 - 1746.64] mercury cadmium nickel copper
[1743.12 - 1749.84] because it comes from the water supply
[1746.64 - 1750.48] that feeds the organic crops that you
[1749.84 - 1752.80] buy
[1750.48 - 1754.24] at the food stores so when you go into
[1752.80 - 1755.68] the food stores
[1754.24 - 1757.44] and you're buying your organic
[1755.68 - 1758.80] vegetables i got to load up on my
[1757.44 - 1761.04] organic vegetables
[1758.80 - 1762.64] i got to get this i got to get that
[1761.04 - 1765.76] there's toxic heavy metals
[1762.64 - 1767.84] all in the compens composition of all
[1765.76 - 1770.32] those fruits and vegetables
[1767.84 - 1771.44] yeah if you do conventional produce
[1770.32 - 1774.64] right not organic
[1771.44 - 1778.56] there's more there's more
[1774.64 - 1783.04] and so you have to know that every
[1778.56 - 1786.56] single thing you literally consume
[1783.04 - 1789.52] i don't care what food you eat
[1786.56 - 1790.16] has a degree of toxic heavy metals in it
[1789.52 - 1793.04] because
[1790.16 - 1793.44] it's coming from the water supply pumped
[1793.04 - 1795.52] in
[1793.44 - 1796.80] or coming out of wells to take care of
[1795.52 - 1800.32] all the farmlands
[1796.80 - 1802.72] and those have metals in it okay
[1800.32 - 1803.52] it's also dropping out of the sky toxic
[1802.72 - 1806.88] heavy metals
[1803.52 - 1808.56] drop out of the sky from chemtrails
[1806.88 - 1810.80] they drop out of the sky you guys should
[1808.56 - 1812.72] listen to the
[1810.80 - 1814.00] medical medium podcast at apple podcast
[1812.72 - 1815.84] the chem show episode
[1814.00 - 1817.76] they drop out with the chemtrails they
[1815.84 - 1821.20] drop out from plain fuel
[1817.76 - 1823.04] too all that plain fuel that you see
[1821.20 - 1825.60] that's just coming out
[1823.04 - 1826.16] metal that's in that petroleum they blow
[1825.60 - 1829.28] around
[1826.16 - 1831.84] but not just that pesticides ddt
[1829.28 - 1832.72] herbicides blow around all around the
[1831.84 - 1834.96] world
[1832.72 - 1836.24] in the air in the air streams fill the
[1834.96 - 1839.12] toxic heavy metals
[1836.24 - 1839.92] perfume has toxic heavy metal in it
[1839.12 - 1842.16] perfume
[1839.92 - 1843.12] there's copper in it okay sometimes
[1842.16 - 1846.56] mercury in it
[1843.12 - 1848.40] okay cologne that also has
[1846.56 - 1850.00] nickel in it cologne has nickel in it it
[1848.40 - 1851.76] has copper in it got a little bit of
[1850.00 - 1854.48] mercury some colognes
[1851.76 - 1855.36] they have metals in them scented candles
[1854.48 - 1856.80] air fresheners
[1855.36 - 1859.04] loaded with toxic heavy metals you
[1856.80 - 1860.88] breathe them in wherever you are
[1859.04 - 1862.48] you walk into a doctor's office and they
[1860.88 - 1864.64] got it going on you breathe in that
[1862.48 - 1866.64] scented candle you bring it breathe in
[1864.64 - 1868.56] some guys cologne next to you in the
[1866.64 - 1869.68] doctor's office you breathe in somebody
[1868.56 - 1871.12] else's aftershave
[1869.68 - 1872.96] you're getting toxic heavy metals and
[1871.12 - 1874.32] then you're sitting on somebody's
[1872.96 - 1875.84] furniture whether it's in a doctor's
[1874.32 - 1877.12] office or an appointment or maybe you're
[1875.84 - 1878.80] getting your nails done
[1877.12 - 1881.04] there's toxic heavy metals all in the
[1878.80 - 1882.72] nail salons toxic heavy metals all in
[1881.04 - 1885.04] the hair salons
[1882.72 - 1886.32] it's everywhere and we breathe them in
[1885.04 - 1888.44] and then
[1886.32 - 1890.08] there's toxic heavy metals in the
[1888.44 - 1893.28] pharmaceuticals
[1890.08 - 1896.64] all in big pharma titanium in
[1893.28 - 1899.84] almost every single drug antibiotics
[1896.64 - 1901.60] are petroleum-based loaded with metals
[1899.84 - 1904.08] if you had an antibiotic you've had
[1901.60 - 1907.76] toxic heavy metals enter into you
[1904.08 - 1909.68] so the bottom line is toxic heavy metals
[1907.76 - 1910.88] are everywhere we get them there we get
[1909.68 - 1912.08] them at the gas station when we're
[1910.88 - 1914.32] pumping gas
[1912.08 - 1916.80] we get them when we spray some kind of
[1914.32 - 1919.36] spray or cleaner that's conventional
[1916.80 - 1920.08] we get them when we spray some oil spray
[1919.36 - 1922.24] on the door
[1920.08 - 1923.84] to stop it from creaking we breathe it
[1922.24 - 1925.76] right in we get it on our fingers we
[1923.84 - 1926.32] just got contaminated with toxic heavy
[1925.76 - 1928.48] metals
[1926.32 - 1929.52] and we get toxic heavy metals from car
[1928.48 - 1932.08] exhaust
[1929.52 - 1933.28] you just got to breathe in one fume one
[1932.08 - 1935.28] car exhaust fume
[1933.28 - 1937.20] one truck fume all you gotta drip
[1935.28 - 1939.44] breathe in is maybe the delivery truck
[1937.20 - 1941.44] that came by breathe that in and you got
[1939.44 - 1945.44] toxic heavy metals
[1941.44 - 1949.12] all right dr fonz says titanium ox
[1945.44 - 1951.04] dioxide in pills yes lots of it too
[1949.12 - 1952.24] and then you're trying to take care of
[1951.04 - 1954.16] yourself and do better
[1952.24 - 1955.84] and someone tries to sell you an
[1954.16 - 1958.16] alkaline ionizer water machine
[1955.84 - 1959.92] which has metal plates that corrode in
[1958.16 - 1961.68] every last one of them i don't care what
[1959.92 - 1963.20] brand you throw up on the screen
[1961.68 - 1965.84] i don't care what brand you think you
[1963.20 - 1969.04] have that doesn't every last
[1965.84 - 1969.36] alkaline ionizer water machine leeches
[1969.04 - 1972.08] out
[1969.36 - 1972.72] toxic heavy metals because the plates
[1972.08 - 1975.44] corrode
[1972.72 - 1976.72] whether you see it or you don't and then
[1975.44 - 1977.20] you think you're doing something good
[1976.72 - 1978.96] for you
[1977.20 - 1982.80] and you're taking more toxic heavy
[1978.96 - 1986.24] metals than you ever did before
[1982.80 - 1987.92] that's just life well that's just a bad
[1986.24 - 1989.44] product but also everything else i'm
[1987.92 - 1993.04] telling you is life
[1989.44 - 1994.56] so what are we going to do okay
[1993.04 - 1996.08] toxic heavy metals are everywhere i'm
[1994.56 - 1996.64] reading the comments you guys were doing
[1996.08 - 2000.16] this
[1996.64 - 2003.04] and so it's about countering that
[2000.16 - 2004.00] the heavy metal detox smoothie has done
[2003.04 - 2005.76] that
[2004.00 - 2007.12] and you can't test for toxic heavy
[2005.76 - 2008.96] metals you guys you know why
[2007.12 - 2010.32] you can't test for toxic heavy metals
[2008.96 - 2013.20] because they sit
[2010.32 - 2014.00] deep within your organs toxic heavy
[2013.20 - 2016.64] metals
[2014.00 - 2018.08] sit deep within your brain your liver
[2016.64 - 2022.40] your pancreas your spleen
[2018.08 - 2025.76] your bones metals go in your bones
[2022.40 - 2028.72] and the only thing i've ever trusted
[2025.76 - 2029.84] to get the metals out of my body that
[2028.72 - 2033.12] enter in
[2029.84 - 2035.04] okay is the medical medium heavy metal
[2033.12 - 2038.16] detox smoothie
[2035.04 - 2041.44] and that's what i've always entrusted in
[2038.16 - 2044.64] the five ingredients
[2041.44 - 2045.04] that are critical for getting metals out
[2044.64 - 2047.52] of
[2045.04 - 2049.12] my bones your bones you know what
[2047.52 - 2050.64] osteopenia is called caused by
[2049.12 - 2054.16] osteopenia
[2050.64 - 2058.84] toxic heavy metals osteopenia
[2054.16 - 2062.00] toxic heavy metals degenerative spine
[2058.84 - 2065.20] scoliosis toxic heavy
[2062.00 - 2066.88] metals degenerative disc disease toxic
[2065.20 - 2070.64] heavy metals
[2066.88 - 2074.00] how about that bones getting brittle
[2070.64 - 2077.92] bones getting weakened as you age
[2074.00 - 2080.64] toxic heavy metals so
[2077.92 - 2081.84] do we just kind of leave them in us or
[2080.64 - 2084.96] do we work on
[2081.84 - 2087.28] getting them out what do you want to do
[2084.96 - 2088.00] you know because i'd rather get them i
[2087.28 - 2089.68] would rather get
[2088.00 - 2091.84] them out is what i would rather do and
[2089.68 - 2095.52] that's what i've done
[2091.84 - 2098.00] so toxic heavy metals are in our way
[2095.52 - 2099.28] christian marie you're here and that's
[2098.00 - 2102.64] been a problem
[2099.28 - 2105.84] for everybody so taking control
[2102.64 - 2109.52] empowering ourselves learning to do what
[2105.84 - 2113.68] works matters you know
[2109.52 - 2115.76] um aaron iv collation
[2113.68 - 2118.08] mercury goes into tissue and lead in
[2115.76 - 2120.48] bones
[2118.08 - 2123.12] can't test for those can't test for
[2120.48 - 2125.12] those unless you do a biopsy of a bone
[2123.12 - 2126.56] you can't unless you're doing a biopsy
[2125.12 - 2128.84] of your brain
[2126.56 - 2132.80] unless someone drills a hole in your
[2128.84 - 2134.56] skull and does a brain biopsy
[2132.80 - 2136.64] you're not going to know you're not
[2134.56 - 2139.76] going to know because blood testing
[2136.64 - 2141.28] only tests new exposure
[2139.76 - 2143.60] so if you're breathing in some air
[2141.28 - 2144.64] fresheners that's only new exposure
[2143.60 - 2146.40] you're gonna pick up
[2144.64 - 2149.12] you're drinking your water from your
[2146.40 - 2150.80] ionizer it's gonna be new exposure
[2149.12 - 2152.48] okay from the toxic ionizer that's
[2150.80 - 2153.52] leaching metals it's gonna be new
[2152.48 - 2156.40] exposure
[2153.52 - 2157.84] whatever that is it's all new exposure
[2156.40 - 2159.04] that's what you're to find in the blood
[2157.84 - 2161.84] test
[2159.04 - 2162.24] but it's in our organs and it's in there
[2161.84 - 2163.92] deep
[2162.24 - 2165.92] and it's going to wreak havoc it gets
[2163.92 - 2168.48] you a fatty liver down the road
[2165.92 - 2170.80] and here's what really really really is
[2168.48 - 2174.56] hard about toxic heavy metals you guys
[2170.80 - 2178.16] what's really hard is they oxidize
[2174.56 - 2179.76] wreak havoc and leech they rust
[2178.16 - 2182.24] do you guys ever see anything rust
[2179.76 - 2183.04] before have you ever seen anything
[2182.24 - 2185.60] corrode
[2183.04 - 2186.72] and rust i'm just wondering you know
[2185.60 - 2189.68] because
[2186.72 - 2190.88] anything that corrodes and rusts leaves
[2189.68 - 2193.04] a stain
[2190.88 - 2194.88] right have you ever seen that
[2193.04 - 2196.56] something's rusting somewhere
[2194.88 - 2198.16] you pick it up maybe you got an old
[2196.56 - 2198.96] screwdriver that's sitting outside in
[2198.16 - 2200.56] the rain
[2198.96 - 2202.16] it's been there for a month and you grab
[2200.56 - 2203.76] it and you see a little rust mark
[2202.16 - 2206.00] starting to develop
[2203.76 - 2207.60] whatever it is that rust you see whether
[2206.00 - 2210.72] it's rust on a car
[2207.60 - 2213.92] rust on some kind of door rust on metal
[2210.72 - 2216.24] whatever it is that rust occurs because
[2213.92 - 2219.04] that metal is oxidizing
[2216.24 - 2220.56] and when your metals sit inside your
[2219.04 - 2222.96] brain
[2220.56 - 2224.32] and they sit inside your liver and they
[2222.96 - 2226.96] sit inside your bones
[2224.32 - 2228.48] they start to rust and they start to
[2226.96 - 2230.16] oxidize
[2228.48 - 2231.44] and then we do the high fat diets and
[2230.16 - 2233.68] we're doing more high fat and we're
[2231.44 - 2234.40] doing more high fat and we're oxidizing
[2233.68 - 2237.76] them more
[2234.40 - 2240.24] because fat and oil makes metals
[2237.76 - 2242.00] bleed just hear me on a second you guys
[2240.24 - 2245.92] hear me out
[2242.00 - 2249.20] fats and oils make
[2245.92 - 2251.92] metals bleed and corrode
[2249.20 - 2253.44] so the more fat you dump in your body
[2251.92 - 2253.92] and i get it everybody's on high fat
[2253.44 - 2255.20] diets
[2253.92 - 2256.72] they can't help it they're told it's
[2255.20 - 2258.24] perfect to do they're never taught how
[2256.72 - 2259.84] not to do it they're never taught how to
[2258.24 - 2262.32] minimize them
[2259.84 - 2263.44] and the more fats we bring into our body
[2262.32 - 2266.56] the more and more we
[2263.44 - 2268.56] oxidize that metal and that metal rusts
[2266.56 - 2270.80] and rusts and rusts
[2268.56 - 2272.48] and that's what happens and when it
[2270.80 - 2274.88] rusts inside your brain
[2272.48 - 2275.84] it leaches and moves over to glial cells
[2274.88 - 2277.36] it moves over to
[2275.84 - 2278.72] more neurons and then all of a sudden
[2277.36 - 2279.52] you're getting some bad anxiety it's
[2278.72 - 2281.84] getting worse
[2279.52 - 2283.28] you're getting some bad ocd the ocd is
[2281.84 - 2285.84] now level
[2283.28 - 2286.80] three it's level four ocd now you're
[2285.84 - 2288.16] getting depression
[2286.80 - 2290.72] like oh my god now you're getting
[2288.16 - 2293.12] depersonalization now you're bipolar
[2290.72 - 2294.56] okay which is ridiculous because that
[2293.12 - 2298.00] diagnosis is so
[2294.56 - 2300.00] it's so backwards because really it's
[2298.00 - 2301.68] just no diagnosis it's like hey you're
[2300.00 - 2303.36] either up or down so let's just diagnose
[2301.68 - 2305.20] you a bipolar let's create a word that
[2303.36 - 2305.52] means up or down how stupid is that
[2305.20 - 2306.72] right
[2305.52 - 2308.48] terrible that's what medical research
[2306.72 - 2309.92] and science does trillions of dollars
[2308.48 - 2311.60] later medical research and science
[2309.92 - 2313.28] doesn't know what causes
[2311.60 - 2315.20] that symptom of feeling up and down so
[2313.28 - 2318.72] they just name it bipolar
[2315.20 - 2320.08] it's actually disturbing so metals are a
[2318.72 - 2323.12] neuroantagonist
[2320.08 - 2324.80] they disrupt your neurons they explode
[2323.12 - 2325.68] neurotransmitters as if they were light
[2324.80 - 2328.00] bulbs
[2325.68 - 2329.12] so all your neurotransmitters all those
[2328.00 - 2329.76] neurotransmitters are making you
[2329.12 - 2331.28] communicate
[2329.76 - 2332.80] they're making you talk they're making
[2331.28 - 2334.08] you walk they're making you think you
[2332.80 - 2335.36] can have a conversation with somebody
[2334.08 - 2336.24] because all those neurotransmitters are
[2335.36 - 2338.32] like
[2336.24 - 2341.76] right well they explode they explode
[2338.32 - 2343.52] like light bulbs like
[2341.76 - 2345.84] that's what neurotransmitters do and
[2343.52 - 2348.36] toxic heavy metals in our brain do that
[2345.84 - 2350.08] and everybody has them and we're losing
[2348.36 - 2351.36] neurotransmitters all the time
[2350.08 - 2353.12] and then when you're 50 years old you're
[2351.36 - 2356.08] like what huh
[2353.12 - 2357.60] what's my name i don't i can't remember
[2356.08 - 2360.24] my date of birth
[2357.60 - 2361.20] i can't remember my name that starts
[2360.24 - 2363.04] happening or
[2361.20 - 2364.56] or i don't know i'm just forgetting
[2363.04 - 2366.24] things who did i have to call i had to
[2364.56 - 2368.24] make what appointment today oh
[2366.24 - 2370.00] i forgot i have to write that down you
[2368.24 - 2373.68] just forget everything
[2370.00 - 2374.88] forget everything um courtney says hey
[2373.68 - 2376.56] courtney glad you're here how do i get
[2374.88 - 2381.36] my kids to drink the smoothie
[2376.56 - 2384.80] popsicles i'm working on a popsicle
[2381.36 - 2387.92] meaning like a recipe now because
[2384.80 - 2391.04] um people have
[2387.92 - 2392.72] people have electricity in their brain
[2391.04 - 2395.04] because that's what we do we all have
[2392.72 - 2396.80] electricity in our brain you got it
[2395.04 - 2399.20] electricity's running around in your
[2396.80 - 2400.80] brain it's running around on neurons
[2399.20 - 2401.92] electrical impulses are swimming around
[2400.80 - 2402.40] they're riding through all your brain
[2401.92 - 2404.56] tissue
[2402.40 - 2406.00] you've got thoughts emotions whoa i've
[2404.56 - 2408.16] been betrayed boom
[2406.00 - 2410.08] your electricity is unbelievable
[2408.16 - 2411.20] somebody just broke my trust electricity
[2410.08 - 2413.44] is unbelievable
[2411.20 - 2414.56] all this electricity going on right i'm
[2413.44 - 2416.32] happy i'm happy
[2414.56 - 2418.08] i'm happy for a minute i'm happy for 10
[2416.32 - 2419.20] seconds that's electricity going on
[2418.08 - 2421.20] right
[2419.20 - 2422.56] and that electricity the sad thing is
[2421.20 - 2424.40] caffeine caffeine
[2422.56 - 2426.00] burns out that electricity it robs it
[2424.40 - 2427.20] from you it's like you take caffeine
[2426.00 - 2428.56] chocolate whatever it is you're happy
[2427.20 - 2430.96] for a moment but that's a
[2428.56 - 2432.40] that's a drug induced happy so your your
[2430.96 - 2434.96] neurotransmitters are getting eaten up
[2432.40 - 2436.80] by caffeine it's destroying your brain
[2434.96 - 2438.64] and all this happening there's metals in
[2436.80 - 2440.88] our brain and that electricity is
[2438.64 - 2443.68] running into that metal
[2440.88 - 2444.72] and it's having spark attacks sparks are
[2443.68 - 2446.32] flying
[2444.72 - 2448.16] it's like putting a screwdriver in a
[2446.32 - 2449.12] socket which i don't want you to do god
[2448.16 - 2450.96] for a bit
[2449.12 - 2452.48] but it's like literally short circuits
[2450.96 - 2453.76] and that's the short circuit so
[2452.48 - 2454.96] you're getting sick you're starting to
[2453.76 - 2455.84] get depression you're starting to get
[2454.96 - 2456.64] some ocd
[2455.84 - 2458.24] you're starting to get some
[2456.64 - 2459.04] depersonalization starting to get
[2458.24 - 2460.40] anxiety
[2459.04 - 2462.40] you're starting to get all of that and
[2460.40 - 2465.60] what's happening is
[2462.40 - 2468.24] with all that um
[2465.60 - 2469.84] with all that's happening all these
[2468.24 - 2472.88] conditions are starting
[2469.84 - 2476.32] and that spark is dying out
[2472.88 - 2479.52] because those metals they actually
[2476.32 - 2481.92] collide with that electricity so
[2479.52 - 2484.40] electrical impulses hit the metal inside
[2481.92 - 2486.24] your brain and boom you got ocd cooking
[2484.40 - 2487.60] and that ocd can get carried on and
[2486.24 - 2489.92] become something else and become
[2487.60 - 2494.32] something else
[2489.92 - 2496.16] so okay you guys
[2494.32 - 2499.04] your brain lights up like a christmas
[2496.16 - 2500.64] tree when i look at it
[2499.04 - 2502.80] you know when i was younger spirit of
[2500.64 - 2504.08] compassion taught me to look inside
[2502.80 - 2506.40] people's brains
[2504.08 - 2508.00] he would give me the vision he would
[2506.40 - 2510.16] show me with the light
[2508.00 - 2512.56] and then he would show me that if
[2510.16 - 2515.12] someone was high in toxic heavy metals
[2512.56 - 2516.24] in their brain it would light up like a
[2515.12 - 2518.96] christmas tree
[2516.24 - 2519.84] in the vision the vision field he would
[2518.96 - 2523.44] give me
[2519.84 - 2525.76] and i remember as a kid
[2523.44 - 2527.60] walking around in crowds of people and i
[2525.76 - 2529.60] would see so many christmas trees
[2527.60 - 2530.72] so many people's brains lit up left and
[2529.60 - 2532.96] right just
[2530.72 - 2534.08] lit up and i'm like whoa that person's
[2532.96 - 2535.84] got a lot of mercury
[2534.08 - 2538.08] that person's got a lot of aluminum that
[2535.84 - 2540.48] person's got a lot of everything
[2538.08 - 2542.24] you know question is where do brain
[2540.48 - 2544.16] lesions come from
[2542.24 - 2545.76] combination of toxic heavy metals and
[2544.16 - 2547.84] viruses such as epstein-barr
[2545.76 - 2550.16] neurotoxins too can do it so
[2547.84 - 2552.72] epstein-barr neurotoxins are really
[2550.16 - 2553.92] really responsible for a lot of brain
[2552.72 - 2555.76] lesions that's one thing
[2553.92 - 2557.60] toxic heavy metals are responsible for a
[2555.76 - 2559.04] lot of them too
[2557.60 - 2560.72] i've helped a lot of doctors with that
[2559.04 - 2562.24] very thing with brain lesions taught a
[2560.72 - 2563.52] lot of doctors about how toxic head
[2562.24 - 2565.12] metals work with brain
[2563.52 - 2566.56] lesions brain lesions or toxic heavy
[2565.12 - 2567.92] metals that start to corrode
[2566.56 - 2570.40] and they crystallize the corrosion
[2567.92 - 2572.80] crystallizes did you ever see
[2570.40 - 2575.12] like a battery that gets too old you
[2572.80 - 2577.68] guys a battery gets too old
[2575.12 - 2579.20] and it starts to corrode well that's
[2577.68 - 2579.92] what happens in the brain with these
[2579.20 - 2580.96] metals
[2579.92 - 2583.44] when these metals are hitting
[2580.96 - 2586.08] electricity
[2583.44 - 2586.48] mark says my memory was was in a bad way
[2586.08 - 2588.48] after
[2586.48 - 2590.96] two years of the heavy metal detox
[2588.48 - 2593.12] smoothie i have my memory back
[2590.96 - 2594.80] thank you so much anthony it matters to
[2593.12 - 2597.28] me that you got your memory back
[2594.80 - 2598.72] see do i go to bed at night and that's
[2597.28 - 2600.88] what i think about right there

[2605.36 - 2610.48] your memory back

[2643.36 - 2646.96] before i go to bed
[2644.32 - 2648.88] i think about you mark i think about you
[2646.96 - 2651.20] getting your memory back
[2648.88 - 2652.56] and i think about every one of you
[2651.20 - 2654.24] getting something
[2652.56 - 2655.76] back that's the bottom line so let's
[2654.24 - 2659.04] make the smoothie
[2655.76 - 2662.80] um so
[2659.04 - 2665.84] let's do this
[2662.80 - 2668.00] put this over here okay
[2665.84 - 2669.12] so i'm gonna put some wild blueberries
[2668.00 - 2670.48] in here but first i'm gonna drop some
[2669.12 - 2672.56] bananas in let me do that
[2670.48 - 2675.12] you guys don't be afraid of bananas
[2672.56 - 2677.52] whatever you do
[2675.12 - 2678.56] you know putting two bananas in you
[2677.52 - 2681.20] could put more
[2678.56 - 2683.04] if you want to put more you can put more
[2681.20 - 2684.96] you can some days i will put more
[2683.04 - 2686.80] what is in the heavy metal detox
[2684.96 - 2690.00] smoothie sharon asks
[2686.80 - 2694.56] i'm gonna put the help of these
[2690.00 - 2694.56] bananas i'm gonna put that in there
[2697.12 - 2703.52] and i'm gonna put um
[2700.72 - 2706.16] with the help of some wild blueberries
[2703.52 - 2708.56] we're gonna make this thing
[2706.16 - 2710.40] i'm excited so we're gonna put bananas
[2708.56 - 2713.12] in there we're gonna put some frozen
[2710.40 - 2716.08] wild blueberries in here about two cups
[2713.12 - 2718.32] i'm just showing you guys right here
[2716.08 - 2720.72] these little guys are miracles is what
[2718.32 - 2724.56] they are
[2720.72 - 2727.84] so now i'm going to talk about the power
[2724.56 - 2730.64] of the wild blueberry did you know
[2727.84 - 2731.52] that you can't kill the wild blueberry
[2730.64 - 2733.44] plant
[2731.52 - 2736.72] do you know that do you know it's
[2733.44 - 2738.56] impossible to kill them
[2736.72 - 2740.16] do you know it's the only food on the
[2738.56 - 2742.48] planet you can't
[2740.16 - 2746.00] kill isn't it interesting put a little
[2742.48 - 2750.00] bit more in here you guys
[2746.00 - 2754.24] it's the only food on the planet
[2750.00 - 2757.36] you can't destroy and stomp out
[2754.24 - 2759.68] you can kill all our food
[2757.36 - 2762.00] you can kill every cow on the planet and
[2759.68 - 2764.80] they'll be gone forever
[2762.00 - 2765.60] you can kill every strawberry patch on
[2764.80 - 2769.44] the planet
[2765.60 - 2772.56] and they'll be gone forever you can kill
[2769.44 - 2775.28] every single chicken
[2772.56 - 2776.24] on the planet and they'll be gone
[2775.28 - 2777.68] forever
[2776.24 - 2780.24] there was this one chicken though you
[2777.68 - 2782.24] guys remember the story a long time ago
[2780.24 - 2783.28] had his head chopped off and was still
[2782.24 - 2786.00] alive
[2783.28 - 2787.20] and then he would eat through his neck
[2786.00 - 2789.36] so
[2787.20 - 2791.04] i've asked spirit of compassion how that
[2789.36 - 2792.72] happened and how it was even possible
[2791.04 - 2795.44] because it was an absolute mystery
[2792.72 - 2796.80] mystery to science and i got the answer
[2795.44 - 2797.44] but i'm just not going to tell you right
[2796.80 - 2800.88] now
[2797.44 - 2804.96] i'll tell you maybe on a podcast um
[2800.88 - 2807.52] so anyway the bottom line is
[2804.96 - 2808.16] you can't kill the wild blueberry plant
[2807.52 - 2811.20] you can
[2808.16 - 2813.68] burn it to the ground in the fields
[2811.20 - 2814.32] and they'll come back up but you burn an
[2813.68 - 2818.08] oak tree
[2814.32 - 2819.68] and it's not coming back up an oak tree
[2818.08 - 2821.92] you can kill every oak tree on this
[2819.68 - 2824.00] planet and it'll be gone for good
[2821.92 - 2825.28] you can't kill the wild blueberry and
[2824.00 - 2828.64] guess what it's
[2825.28 - 2832.64] that power it has
[2828.64 - 2835.44] that makes this that makes this heavy
[2832.64 - 2839.04] metal detox movie what it is
[2835.44 - 2840.88] it's it's the basis it's the core
[2839.04 - 2842.32] but you got to have everything else but
[2840.88 - 2846.16] it's the core
[2842.32 - 2847.60] and that matters so noelle shepard says
[2846.16 - 2850.88] tell hey noelle
[2847.60 - 2851.84] phillip k says i thought i just said i
[2850.88 - 2853.68] missed the comment but
[2851.84 - 2854.88] glad you're here phillip k appreciate it
[2853.68 - 2858.16] um
[2854.88 - 2859.68] so yeah the bottom line is it's michelle
[2858.16 - 2861.84] l i just saw that alien chicken it's
[2859.68 - 2865.60] funny
[2861.84 - 2868.64] this is the core fundamental basis
[2865.60 - 2869.52] the epicenter the powers in that wild
[2868.64 - 2871.76] blueberry
[2869.52 - 2873.52] but you gotta have the rest and let's go
[2871.76 - 2874.88] into it let's talk about it first of all
[2873.52 - 2876.64] i just put the wild blueberries in here
[2874.88 - 2879.68] you guys all right
[2876.64 - 2880.88] just saying you see it right and the
[2879.68 - 2884.80] wild blueberry
[2880.88 - 2888.24] has reaching powers into your brain
[2884.80 - 2891.52] into your brain stem it's got reaching
[2888.24 - 2892.24] powers it can overreach and that's what
[2891.52 - 2893.44] you want
[2892.24 - 2895.44] in the wild blueberry can do that
[2893.44 - 2896.80] anthocyanins undiscovered by research
[2895.44 - 2898.08] and science sit in wild blueberries
[2896.80 - 2899.68] because guess what science won't take
[2898.08 - 2900.00] their time out to study it because like
[2899.68 - 2902.00] i told
[2900.00 - 2903.44] you before to actually fix things on
[2902.00 - 2905.60] this planet chronic illness
[2903.44 - 2906.64] you would need true science that's
[2905.60 - 2909.84] actually
[2906.64 - 2912.88] working for the people and not for
[2909.84 - 2915.28] somebody's pocket and so what's
[2912.88 - 2917.20] in this right here is undiscovered by
[2915.28 - 2918.96] research and science anthocyanins that
[2917.20 - 2920.80] are undiscovered
[2918.96 - 2922.64] that's one of the key tickets another
[2920.80 - 2925.44] key ticket is it's
[2922.64 - 2926.32] it literally stops the metals from
[2925.44 - 2928.56] rusting
[2926.32 - 2929.36] in the brain so those frozen wild
[2928.56 - 2931.12] blueberries
[2929.36 - 2932.48] stop metals from rusting so that's the
[2931.12 - 2933.68] thing right there i'm giving you some
[2932.48 - 2935.92] powerful tidbits
[2933.68 - 2937.44] on each one of these if i can let's keep
[2935.92 - 2939.60] on going
[2937.44 - 2941.36] let's put um let's just put some some
[2939.60 - 2942.32] oranges in here let's get some oranges
[2941.36 - 2943.60] in here
[2942.32 - 2945.68] let's do that you guys i'm going to cut
[2943.60 - 2947.84] some orange these are small oranges so
[2945.68 - 2951.12] i'm going to pop in two
[2947.84 - 2951.12] but they're small oranges
[2953.68 - 2960.32] i like small oranges
[2957.76 - 2961.60] i got a little straightener right here
[2960.32 - 2964.64] and you'll see here
[2961.60 - 2966.24] it's a metal strainer what do we have
[2964.64 - 2969.36] here
[2966.24 - 2970.88] okay it's a metal strainer but i don't
[2969.36 - 2973.44] care
[2970.88 - 2975.76] because whatever little leeches out of
[2973.44 - 2978.00] the strainer over the years
[2975.76 - 2980.24] this smoothie is going to remove it
[2978.00 - 2983.20] times a thousand
[2980.24 - 2984.00] and that's why so you know there's
[2983.20 - 2987.28] something about
[2984.00 - 2989.68] insurance right you know you're happy
[2987.28 - 2991.76] when you got car insurance because
[2989.68 - 2994.56] if you didn't have car insurance right
[2991.76 - 2998.00] that would be a problem okay
[2994.56 - 3001.44] um but the heavy metal
[2998.00 - 3003.76] detox smoothie is insurance
[3001.44 - 3005.28] it's an important insurance policy in
[3003.76 - 3008.16] your life
[3005.28 - 3010.56] and it's one that gives something back
[3008.16 - 3012.64] to you no matter what
[3010.56 - 3014.24] and that's what i love about it that's
[3012.64 - 3015.60] how i see it too it's an important
[3014.24 - 3018.08] insurance policy
[3015.60 - 3018.08] it's like
[3019.68 - 3023.28] so i'm popping in some orange here
[3022.08 - 3024.48] alexandra said aw
[3023.28 - 3025.92] is it okay to put the juice of three
[3024.48 - 3027.84] oranges in your heavy metal detox
[3025.92 - 3030.96] smoothie yes
[3027.84 - 3032.24] it is just saw a question on millet yeah
[3030.96 - 3034.48] no it's great but don't put in your
[3032.24 - 3037.92] heavy metal detox smoothie montana
[3034.48 - 3037.92] i know you're not talking about that
[3038.48 - 3040.64] all right i got a little juice let me
[3039.68 - 3043.20] put a little more because these are
[3040.64 - 3043.20] really small
[3044.56 - 3048.32] put a little bit more in here i squeeze
[3046.24 - 3052.56] them with my hand that's what i do
[3048.32 - 3056.48] can we use the whole orange cindy says
[3052.56 - 3058.40] can we use the whole orange yes
[3056.48 - 3060.08] all right so i get a little bit in there
[3058.40 - 3062.16] there we go i got the orange in there
[3060.08 - 3063.44] happy i'm gonna put a little bit of
[3062.16 - 3065.44] dolls
[3063.44 - 3066.96] put a tablespoon a few strips in it you
[3065.44 - 3067.60] could put a teaspoon if you really want
[3066.96 - 3072.64] to
[3067.60 - 3072.64] it's fine but i'm putting that in here
[3073.84 - 3076.40] a little bit
[3077.36 - 3080.40] and then let's go into the rest of this
[3079.44 - 3082.16] stuff
[3080.40 - 3084.56] i got some cilantro to put in but i'm
[3082.16 - 3087.44] gonna the barley grass juice powder so
[3084.56 - 3089.44] that's the vimergy one right there
[3087.44 - 3091.68] now here's an important critical thing
[3089.44 - 3094.32] to know all right
[3091.68 - 3095.44] you don't want to use barley grass that
[3094.32 - 3098.72] you don't want to do
[3095.44 - 3099.52] don't use barley grass that's important
[3098.72 - 3101.44] okay
[3099.52 - 3103.36] um it has to be barley grass juice
[3101.44 - 3106.56] powder the vimergy one
[3103.36 - 3107.60] is the best there is hands down it's the
[3106.56 - 3111.12] purest
[3107.60 - 3114.64] it is the best and
[3111.12 - 3118.40] what i love about it is it has
[3114.64 - 3118.80] a heavy metal detoxifying structure to
[3118.40 - 3122.40] it
[3118.80 - 3125.36] it's built it's created
[3122.40 - 3126.08] the way it's created it can absorb
[3125.36 - 3127.76] metals
[3126.08 - 3130.16] hold on to them pull them out of the
[3127.76 - 3133.20] body so it has a magnetic
[3130.16 - 3135.36] effect to grab onto metal
[3133.20 - 3136.64] in the body and that's what i love about
[3135.36 - 3140.08] it
[3136.64 - 3141.04] because it's not just about removing
[3140.08 - 3143.92] metals
[3141.04 - 3145.04] it grabs on to them as it runs into them
[3143.92 - 3147.12] floating around
[3145.04 - 3148.56] and the reason why you got to have the
[3147.12 - 3150.00] barley grass juice powder you got to
[3148.56 - 3151.28] have the spirulina you got to have the
[3150.00 - 3152.64] wild blueberries you gotta have the
[3151.28 - 3155.60] dulce and the cilantro
[3152.64 - 3157.68] they work off each other they're a team
[3155.60 - 3159.20] that's how you get something done
[3157.68 - 3160.80] you need a team of people to get
[3159.20 - 3162.72] something done sometimes right you guys
[3160.80 - 3166.80] will you need a team
[3162.72 - 3170.32] of heavy metal grabbers detoxifiers
[3166.80 - 3171.52] pullers um you know and dislodgers
[3170.32 - 3172.96] that's what you need so we'll go on
[3171.52 - 3174.48] we'll keep on moving on i just put the
[3172.96 - 3176.40] dolls in here now what i love about the
[3174.48 - 3178.80] dolls is
[3176.40 - 3181.68] it's incredible for grabbing toxic heavy
[3178.80 - 3183.12] metals out of your intestinal tract
[3181.68 - 3186.08] we have toxic heavy metals in our
[3183.12 - 3189.12] stomachs everybody's stomach
[3186.08 - 3191.68] has got metals in the linings stuck
[3189.12 - 3192.40] in the linings what i love about the
[3191.68 - 3195.60] dolls
[3192.40 - 3199.20] okay the atlantic dolls is
[3195.60 - 3203.68] it removes metals out of the lining
[3199.20 - 3206.80] of the stomach it removes easy to find
[3203.68 - 3208.72] metals not deep seated metals
[3206.80 - 3210.56] the barley grass juice powder the
[3208.72 - 3213.76] spirulina the blueberries
[3210.56 - 3217.60] get the deep seeded metals
[3213.76 - 3219.36] the dulce it gets perimeter metals
[3217.60 - 3221.28] that are important to get your small
[3219.36 - 3223.44] intestinal tract your colon
[3221.28 - 3224.96] metals that are feeding bacteria metals
[3223.44 - 3227.60] that are feeding viruses
[3224.96 - 3228.64] it's getting it out so that's important
[3227.60 - 3231.60] there so i just did
[3228.64 - 3234.40] a little bit of dolson there let's put
[3231.60 - 3234.40] some spirulina
[3234.84 - 3238.72] so
[3237.28 - 3241.52] that one's a favorite of mine right
[3238.72 - 3245.12] there this is the best stuff
[3241.52 - 3248.64] on the market today hands down
[3245.12 - 3252.16] could bet my life on it i know
[3248.64 - 3255.28] what it's comprised of i've seen
[3252.16 - 3256.72] every single one out there i've picked
[3255.28 - 3259.04] through them
[3256.72 - 3260.32] tooth and nail all the stuff i've talked
[3259.04 - 3263.68] to all the companies
[3260.32 - 3265.60] all through the years by far best one
[3263.68 - 3268.00] and it matters because if you put a
[3265.60 - 3271.44] crappier one in which you can
[3268.00 - 3274.00] you get maybe some metal out but
[3271.44 - 3275.92] not as much as you could have or if it's
[3274.00 - 3279.84] a really bad spirulina you get
[3275.92 - 3284.40] no metal out and these foods
[3279.84 - 3286.80] have the power of absorbing metals
[3284.40 - 3288.24] lots of metal wherever it can find it
[3286.80 - 3289.52] and that's what i love about it so the
[3288.24 - 3291.12] spirulina
[3289.52 - 3292.72] so here's the thing here's something
[3291.12 - 3293.68] that's very important i'm still making
[3292.72 - 3295.36] this smoothie
[3293.68 - 3298.40] when you remove toxic heavy metals you
[3295.36 - 3298.40] got an empty space
[3298.56 - 3305.36] you got an empty space think about that
[3302.88 - 3308.16] toxic heavy metals make a divot and a
[3305.36 - 3310.40] pit inside your brain
[3308.16 - 3311.20] and the more they oxidize the bigger the
[3310.40 - 3314.40] divot
[3311.20 - 3315.60] when you have alzheimer's that pit is
[3314.40 - 3317.36] getting big
[3315.60 - 3319.28] when you gotta focus on concentration
[3317.36 - 3322.08] issues when you got
[3319.28 - 3323.28] ocd really bad the pits and the nooks
[3322.08 - 3326.32] and crannies get
[3323.28 - 3327.52] big so what happens is in your brain
[3326.32 - 3330.80] tissue
[3327.52 - 3334.88] metals start to actually
[3330.80 - 3337.52] burn a hole in your brain
[3334.88 - 3338.64] electrical impulses are slamming into
[3337.52 - 3341.12] those metals
[3338.64 - 3342.00] and those metals are getting hot and
[3341.12 - 3345.44] they're burning
[3342.00 - 3348.16] into your brain tissue
[3345.44 - 3349.60] as that happens over time you got now a
[3348.16 - 3353.36] pocket
[3349.60 - 3357.04] you got tiny microscopic pockets
[3353.36 - 3357.04] inside your brain tissue
[3357.28 - 3364.08] and that's there when you remove metals
[3361.52 - 3365.44] you still got those pockets you still
[3364.08 - 3369.12] got those microscopic
[3365.44 - 3372.16] issues and that's why this is a miracle
[3369.12 - 3373.92] from what i've seen in the last 35 plus
[3372.16 - 3377.20] years even longer
[3373.92 - 3380.96] the reason why it's a miracle is because
[3377.20 - 3385.60] it doesn't just take the metals out
[3380.96 - 3388.32] it fixes and repairs the hole
[3385.60 - 3389.20] and that's the key right there it's not
[3388.32 - 3391.68] just taking
[3389.20 - 3392.24] something out it's putting something
[3391.68 - 3395.36] back
[3392.24 - 3398.48] in and that's what it's doing
[3395.36 - 3401.28] i'm gonna put some cilantro here um
[3398.48 - 3402.96] i love cilantro as a leafy green there's
[3401.28 - 3405.20] a question right there from donna is
[3402.96 - 3407.20] carella okay no it's not
[3405.20 - 3408.80] no i've seen a lot of people bent over
[3407.20 - 3410.88] the sides of their bed
[3408.80 - 3413.20] barfing for days and days because of
[3410.88 - 3415.36] corella i've seen lots of people
[3413.20 - 3417.20] holding onto the toilet so tight where
[3415.36 - 3418.16] they lived in the bath on the bathroom
[3417.20 - 3421.28] floor for days
[3418.16 - 3424.56] puking their guts out because of corella
[3421.28 - 3426.40] cruella has microorganisms
[3424.56 - 3428.00] and microorganisms in it that are not
[3426.40 - 3431.60] supposed to be there
[3428.00 - 3434.08] okay and bacteria bad bacteria
[3431.60 - 3436.32] i wouldn't trust corella someone handed
[3434.08 - 3438.88] to me i'd smack it out of their hand
[3436.32 - 3439.52] because i wouldn't even want it near me
[3438.88 - 3441.44] and
[3439.52 - 3443.36] corella doesn't remove metals i don't
[3441.44 - 3445.12] know where that farce came from and if
[3443.36 - 3447.44] it ever did remove a little bit of metal
[3445.12 - 3450.48] it would drop it immediately
[3447.44 - 3451.68] so to this day i still can't believe
[3450.48 - 3453.28] it's just out there
[3451.68 - 3455.20] i can't tell you how many people have
[3453.28 - 3458.48] barfed their guts out because of
[3455.20 - 3460.00] basically food poisoning and um so no
[3458.48 - 3463.84] i'm just not a fan
[3460.00 - 3465.44] not a fan there's somebody up there uh
[3463.84 - 3470.40] roberta says no wait let's see
[3465.44 - 3470.40] sorry um they're going up so quick
[3473.12 - 3480.16] anna anna says cruella made me so sick
[3476.96 - 3482.56] god bless you i hope you got through it
[3480.16 - 3483.76] i've known people i've known people that
[3482.56 - 3486.08] have literally been
[3483.76 - 3487.68] holding onto their toilet on the
[3486.08 - 3491.04] bathroom floor
[3487.68 - 3492.32] and and and like for days until they
[3491.04 - 3495.52] ended up in the hospital
[3492.32 - 3498.16] many didn't many did just awful
[3495.52 - 3498.96] but you know what i could say it all day
[3498.16 - 3500.32] long and it's
[3498.96 - 3501.84] still out there and people are still
[3500.32 - 3503.36] gonna take it and some influence are
[3501.84 - 3504.08] still gonna be like i'm putting cruella
[3503.36 - 3507.12] in my
[3504.08 - 3509.04] acai bowl and i'm putting corelli in my
[3507.12 - 3511.44] peanut butter smoothie and it's like
[3509.04 - 3511.44] what
[3511.84 - 3514.96] it's just like you can't you can't fix
[3513.84 - 3516.48] everything
[3514.96 - 3518.24] you can't fix everything out there i
[3516.48 - 3518.80] mean i've been doing this third 35 years
[3518.24 - 3521.44] and
[3518.80 - 3523.36] i just can't fix everything um and all
[3521.44 - 3527.84] the mess-ups so
[3523.36 - 3531.44] if someone's high in metals
[3527.84 - 3533.04] they'll have an aversion to cilantro
[3531.44 - 3534.88] so you're not going to want cilantro i
[3533.04 - 3536.16] put cilantro in here you guys because
[3534.88 - 3539.36] you're high in metals you're not even
[3536.16 - 3541.60] going to want cilantro keep that in mind
[3539.36 - 3542.80] if it gives you a bad bad taste that
[3541.60 - 3544.32] means you're really high in heavy metals
[3542.80 - 3545.76] if you needed to keep the cilantro out
[3544.32 - 3549.68] keep it out
[3545.76 - 3550.48] okay keep it out three out of five ain't
[3549.68 - 3552.96] bad
[3550.48 - 3554.24] four out of five ain't bad if you gotta
[3552.96 - 3556.56] do it that way
[3554.24 - 3558.56] so if you gotta do the spirulina wild
[3556.56 - 3560.72] blueberry powder
[3558.56 - 3562.32] uh look got it if you can't get wild
[3560.72 - 3564.08] blueberries do the wild blueberry powder
[3562.32 - 3566.32] i forgot to put that in you gotta do the
[3564.08 - 3568.64] spirulina the wild blueberry powder
[3566.32 - 3570.40] the barley grass juice powder wild
[3568.64 - 3571.04] blueberries bananas if you can get stuff
[3570.40 - 3574.64] like that
[3571.04 - 3576.00] but if you if you have to keep out
[3574.64 - 3577.92] if you have to keep something out like
[3576.00 - 3580.32] the cilantro then keep that out and do
[3577.92 - 3582.40] four out of five
[3580.32 - 3583.60] and you're still gonna get the metals
[3582.40 - 3585.52] out but
[3583.60 - 3587.84] there's gonna be an imbalance but you
[3585.52 - 3589.76] live with it until you can handle your
[3587.84 - 3591.12] cilantro someday
[3589.76 - 3593.92] if you don't have wild frozen wild
[3591.12 - 3597.28] blueberries the
[3593.92 - 3597.28] bimmerjee wild blueberry powder
[3598.00 - 3602.48] anyway still working on this
[3603.84 - 3607.12] yeah corella seriously i just saw that
[3605.84 - 3610.16] comment right there come up or
[3607.12 - 3612.32] someone was laughing let's blend this
[3610.16 - 3612.32] up
[3613.60 - 3615.84] so
[3619.84 - 3629.84] reading some comments
[3632.96 - 3636.88] what's my opinion on cmos i think it's
[3640.84 - 3643.84] fine
[3647.44 - 3657.84] the cmos isn't going to replace dolls
[3671.28 - 3676.72] there we go i think i've made this a lot
[3673.76 - 3676.72] of times i'll tell you
[3680.32 - 3685.84] let's get one going here
[3691.28 - 3699.84] and then you could get a spoon and kind
[3692.80 - 3699.84] of get the rest out
[3707.04 - 3714.64] if you can see that
[3712.16 - 3716.08] heavy metal detox smoothie right there
[3714.64 - 3716.40] there's a question right there i have
[3716.08 - 3718.96] got
[3716.40 - 3721.04] extreme so anna says i've got extreme
[3718.96 - 3723.36] eczema on my hands and arms
[3721.04 - 3724.84] don't understand why i am doing
[3723.36 - 3728.08] everything right
[3724.84 - 3731.44] detox how many fats are in the diet
[3728.08 - 3733.36] because the fats can get in the way
[3731.44 - 3735.52] did you do a new pharmaceutical lately
[3733.36 - 3736.88] at all is there a new pharmaceutical in
[3735.52 - 3738.64] your life
[3736.88 - 3739.92] something new that you might have got or
[3738.64 - 3743.44] received
[3739.92 - 3743.44] because there's a lot of metals in there
[3743.76 - 3747.60] eczema is caused by copper and the
[3745.68 - 3749.68] epstein-barr virus inside the liver so
[3747.60 - 3752.00] i've talked about that in the books
[3749.68 - 3752.00] and
[3753.36 - 3756.48] are you doing the antiviral protocol you
[3755.12 - 3758.16] can take the book to your doctor or
[3756.48 - 3759.84] health care provider somebody that might
[3758.16 - 3760.72] might help you with the protocol if you
[3759.84 - 3763.44] want
[3760.72 - 3763.84] and there's a protocol on here antiviral
[3763.44 - 3767.28] for
[3763.84 - 3768.24] eczema answer is this have you embarked
[3767.28 - 3770.88] on it yet
[3768.24 - 3772.00] how far are you going because you can go
[3770.88 - 3774.16] really far
[3772.00 - 3775.60] really far to the finish line with the
[3774.16 - 3779.28] medical medium tools
[3775.60 - 3782.48] and are you using the right ingredients
[3779.28 - 3783.84] another thing too to consider are you
[3782.48 - 3785.44] doing any nutritional yeast
[3783.84 - 3787.12] get rid of it are you doing apple cider
[3785.44 - 3788.40] vinegar get rid of it
[3787.12 - 3790.72] you might not be doing any of those i
[3788.40 - 3792.16] totally get it um what are you doing
[3790.72 - 3793.60] caffeine are you doing chocolate all you
[3792.16 - 3795.52] need is chocolate once a month the
[3793.60 - 3798.08] eczema is going to stick around
[3795.52 - 3799.36] and is the diet too high in fat because
[3798.08 - 3803.28] it doesn't allow the
[3799.36 - 3804.88] copper to leave so the higher fat your
[3803.28 - 3807.92] diet is
[3804.88 - 3810.00] the harder it is to get that metal out
[3807.92 - 3812.08] to get the virus out so keep
[3810.00 - 3814.56] them there's a lot of place to go don't
[3812.08 - 3818.00] do any eggs don't do milk cheese butter
[3814.56 - 3821.60] don't do any anything like that and um
[3818.00 - 3823.04] have you done the 369 cleanse advance
