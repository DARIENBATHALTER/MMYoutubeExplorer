40
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,840
about poop what's good about poop and

41
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,560
what's crazy is you know you put some

42
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,240
information out there right everybody's

43
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,320
all throwing at you they're

44
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,240

45
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,600

46
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,240
and they all think their don't

47
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,720
stink that's what's incredible every

48
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,240
single person health professional i'm

49
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,240
i've been a health professional for many

50
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,600
years and that's opposite of what we

51
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:38,000
have learned in medical school uh

52
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,200
am i missing something because

53
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,439
i thought

54
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,119
it was well known by now

55
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,200
that all the medical doctors that

56
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,840
graduate from medical school never

57
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,920
taught anything about like poop and food

58
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,520
and things like that or anything about

59
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,960
nutrition or anything isn't that what

60
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,320
everybody knew all these years because i

61
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,799
talked to a lot of doctors and everybody

62
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,920
knows that so why is all of a sudden

63
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,680
medical school the expert about poop

64
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,119
it just doesn't make any sense so we're

65
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,719
just going to cover a lot of little

66
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,079
pieces about this this is going to be a

67
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,280
good talk and probably really

68
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,599
educational

69
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,800
maybe fun hopefully

70
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:12,640
but you know

71
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,680
yeah everybody's an expert they just

72
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,920
google

73
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,400

74
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,599

excited about this

131
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:17,280
i was told by my doctor

132
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,359
because doctors know everything right

133
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,160
that's why people are dying people are

134
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,680
sick

135
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,440
people are bedridden

136
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,120
right people have chronic illness a

137
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,400
whole lifetime because doctors know

138
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,320
everything right

139
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,080
oh google knows everything just google

140
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,000
it you could be fixed that's a good

141
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,240
thing you could do if you're bedridden

142
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,759
with a disease and you're suffering and

143
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,000
no one can help you why don't you just

144
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,000
google you'll be fixed tomorrow google

145
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,440
will fix everything

146
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,919
okay

147
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,639
i was told by my doctor

148
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,639
the absolute opposite statement with

149
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,680
matter what medical medium said

150
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,759
floating stool is a sign of not properly

151
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,520
digesting fats

152
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,000
think about the drops of oil in the

153
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:01,120
water well

154
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,400
here's how it works okay

155
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:07,600
you want a little bit of almond butter

156
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,479
which is a lot of fat in there right a

157
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,840
lot of fat in that almond butter okay

158
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,120
so let's get a little bit of almond

159
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,280
butter here

160
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,280
that almond butter should just float

161
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,080
shouldn't it so let's get some water up

162
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,919
here

163
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,080
well that almond butter just should

164
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,960
float to the top of the water shouldn't

165
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,039
it

166
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,479
right probably should float right to oh

167
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,919
it sunk

168
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,120
it's sunk

169
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,720
huh

170
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,639
seems like everybody knows what they're

171
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,160
talking about including every single

172
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,680
doctor i guess

173
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,160
because they're saying it's supposed to

174
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,160
float fat is supposed to float i'm

175
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,320
scratching my head right now that's

176
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,639
interesting why did that almond butter

177
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:47,600
sink like lead huh

178
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,520
all right let me put that away here

179
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,639
let's take some peanut butter how about

180
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,440
that

181
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,240
peanut butter really high in fat that's

182
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,639
right

183
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,560
you eat a tub of peanut butter every day

184
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,800
you're going to get fat you're going to

185
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,479
get fat real fast right

186
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,000
so i'm going to get some peanut butter

187
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,319
here right

188
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,520
let's get a little peanut butter here i

189
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,360
got some water in this cup okay

190
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,919
so let's put some peanut butter in here

191
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,360
now that peanut butter should float

192
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,199
right

193
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,560
why that peanut butter sink

194
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,440
i am so

195
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,319
darn confused everybody's telling me

196
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,680
that

197
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,800
wait a minute everybody's telling me

198
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,440
that

199
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,440
a poop

200
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,880
that floats

201
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:33,680
or mid-floats

202
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,039
means it's all fat and that's why it's

203
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,440
floating

204
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,680
scratching my head right here let me do

205
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,240
some tahini how about that

206
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,039
uh-huh let's do that

207
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,880
and this is why you shouldn't talk to aw

208
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,240
or you shouldn't listen to aw just

209
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,919
because millions of people have healed

210
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,560
with his books that never had a chance

211
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:54,880
to heal oh don't listen to him listen to

212
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,199
some dietitian right listen to a

213
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,039
dietitian about poop right dietitian

214
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,199

215
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,800
tahini here right

216
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,960
tahini

217
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,960
with a lot of oil on it

218
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,680
whoa

219
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:12,400
that tahini had so much oil it was

220
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,479
soaking in oil

221
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:18,400
that's what that tahini was doing but

222
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:20,400
why did it sink i'm really confused here

223
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,479
this is really interesting so let me put

224
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,759
this tahini back right

225
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,240
let me put this

226
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,919
almonds are high in fat too

227
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,360
i think i'm going to do something else

228
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:34,319
here let me get some water here

229
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,319
get a little bit of this

230
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,240
and

231
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,639
i'm going to put some water right here

232
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,840
so you guys don't mind

233
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,960
okay

234
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,720
and

235
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,000
oh chocolate

236
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,120
cacao

237
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,520
cacao butter cacao fat

238
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,960
it's a lot of fat in there

239
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,879
what the hell

240
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,199
how did chocolate sink

241
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,680
how's that possible how's chocolate

242
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:03,199
sinking i thought everybody was telling

243
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,960
me that it's going to float to the top

244
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,759
so that means if your poop is filled

245
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,199
with

246
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,039
with anything

247
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,639
like any kind of fat it's going to float

248
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,720
to the top well that's funny because

249
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:15,520
guess what i talked to a lot of doctors

250
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,759
that actually test fat levels in poop

251
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,160
and they're all sinking poops

252
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,800
yes because everybody's beat up

253
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,960
digestion track screwed up digestive

254
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,120
system weak livers wheat pancreases and

255
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,879
everything else they can't break down

256
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,879
all their fats

257
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,039
so their fats end up in their stools

258
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,719
every day everybody out there on keto

259
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,839
diets or anywhere else and when they do

260
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,839
an actual fat exam on that stool they

261
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,919
find a lot of fat in that stool that's

262
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,919
undigested that's actually in the stool

263
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,920
and guess where that stool is it's sunk

264
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,480
at the bottom of the damn toilet and

265
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,279
there it is the cacao sinks just like

266
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,040
that

267
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:54,240
cacao did right there hey let's do

268
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,240
another one

269
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,720
let's do another one right here okay

270
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,519
because everybody's so smart out there

271
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,279
everybody's so smart oh

272
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,360
why are these almonds why are they

273
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,040
sinking to the bottom of that bowl well

274
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,480
almonds are sinking down to the bottom

275
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,720
of that bowl right there

276
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,320
right there they are sinking down to the

277
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,240
bottom of that bowl

278
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,000
right there all sitting at the bottom

279
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,800
right now there you go

280
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,320
right

281
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,320
all those almonds are sitting down at

282
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,279
the bottom of that bowl so let's put

283
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:26,800
that there now wait a minute let me get

284
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,920
some cashews in here you like cashews

285
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,200

the cashews coming

290
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,600
see what happens is our broken digestive

291
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:42,399
tracts don't break down the fats and

292
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,080
proteins and so our sinks to the

293
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,000
bottom you see

294
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,519

00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,880
so

331
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,839
there are people

332
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,079
sick

333
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,760
and dying

334
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,360
hospital beds

335
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:17,120
are filled

336
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:19,839
all around the world with dying people

337
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,800
they're dying of all kinds of diseases

338
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,640
across the gamma

339
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,120
and their

340
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,120
sinks

341
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,279
are you telling me they have a healthy

342
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,760
even though they're dying

343
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,480
their shit's healthy but they're dying

344
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:41,959
i'm confused

345
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,959
there are nurses

346
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:47,360
helping patients go to bathroom every

347
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,440
single day in every hospital around this

348
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:53,680
country and globe and their is

349
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,560
sinking to the bottom of that toilet

350
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,120
so

351
00:11:54,560 --> 00:12:00,639
their stool is healthy

352
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:04,000
so that dying person stools perfectly

353
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:06,880
healthy because it's sunk to the bottom

354
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,320
but they're going to be dead in 10 days

355
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,399
from some kind of disease in the

356
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,279
hospital

357
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:15,040
that person's stool is so healthy at the

358
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,720
bottom of their toilet let me just get

359
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,639
their stool out of the bottom of that

360
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,720
sick person's toilet that's dying in the

361
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,000
hospital it's the healthiest stool there

362
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,000
is

363
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,440
and the person's got three four diseases

364
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,480
and they're dying in the hospital right

365
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:31,800
now across the world

366
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,519
do you see how disturbingly

367
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,959
ironically

368
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,600
deranged

369
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:39,360
people are in the health movement

370
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,800
because they'll tell you

371
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,440
i'm wrong

372
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,959
because i'm saying a really healthy poop

373
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,680
should mid float and i'm going to tell

374
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:49,600
you why it should mid-float

375
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,760
or even float

376
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,959
yes you can have an unhealthy poop still

377
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,800
float

378

431
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,959
for a lot of different reasons you got

432
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,639
functional medicine doctors all around

433
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,320
the world now convincing everybody that

434
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,320
their guts are a mess completely they

435
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,959
got sibo they got celiac they got all

436
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,880
kinds of intestinal tract disorders and

437
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,880
they're telling them right their

438
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,240
microbiomes off every bit about their

439
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,000
gut is off every part of their

440
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,000
intestinal tract is off every part of

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,600
their intestinal tract's messed up right

442
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,880
with all kinds of different microbiome

443
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:07,199
problems but they're sinking

444
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,480
and that's that's just perfect that's

445
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,079
just great

446
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,000
see

447
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,519
that's that that right so it's important

448
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,079
to know how it works so let me tell you

449
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:18,639
a little bathroom story right

450
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:20,160
i had to use a public bathroom

451
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,760
a while back

452
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,680
it was right before the whole thing of

453
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:26,000

so it was a bathroom that didn't have

457
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,480
more than one toilet so the bathroom the

458
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,880
public bathroom only had one toilet

459
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,440
it was a small bathroom

460
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:43,199
okay it was in a restaurant

461
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:45,360
and it had one toilet and a sink

462
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:48,320

was time for him to go to bathroom and

475
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,560

the guy

491
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:49,600
i hear him wash his hands in the sink

492
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,680
but i don't hear the toilet bowl flush

493
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,680
and then the guy comes out

494
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,480
and the smell that came out with it was

495
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,959
oh

496
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,079

but i had to go in

500
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:07,280
i had to go into the bathroom so i went

501
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,280
into the bathroom to urinate

502
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,600
and there was a really big turd sitting

503
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,959
in that toilet

504
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,919
okay

505
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:18,480
and that turd was sunk to the bottom

506
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:21,679
and he forgot to flush the toilet

507
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:24,000
and that thing sunk to the bottom

508
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:28,400
and spirit of compassion said to me that

509
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,320
guy has more wrong with him

510
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,120
his guts are a mess

511
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:35,360
all kinds of bacteria his microbes

512
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,360
totally all twisted backwards fungus

513
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,200
yeast mold in his gut

514
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,280
he had gallbladder problems he had

515
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,799
pancreatic problems he had liver

516
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,679
problems he had gastrointestinal

517
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:46,799
problems from his mouth to his butt hole

518
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,000
and

519
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,919
his

520
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,200
looked fine by any standard it was just

521
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,080
sitting there and it was sunk to the

522
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,080
bottom of the toilet

523
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,160
you know

524
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,760
it's unbelievable when people just pick

525
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,440
things up from google so if i say

526
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,600
something it's always against the grain

527
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,760
i always say something against the grain

528
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,240
and i'm always proven like right later

529
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,760
in a couple of years you're gonna hear

530
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,200
you're gonna see it somewhere else

531
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,960
you're gonna see somebody come out like

532
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,400
i'm doctor so doctor is blue

533
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,480
and i'm just gonna tell you we have

534
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,080
found out that stools are healthier when

535
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,840
they're mid-floating you'll see that in

536
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,200
two years just like i told you that

537
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,000
multiple sclerosis was caused by

538
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,960
epstein-barr 35 years of teaching people

539
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,280
that

540
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,039
and publishing it right and then science

541
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,880
says oh wait we think we know the

542
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:36,720
finally we think we know the cause it's

543
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,679
epstein-barr okay nice try he came way

544
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,200
too late

545
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,160
to the party

546
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,760
just like

547
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:45,919
the shingles virus is not the chickenpox

548
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,160
virus but you guys are all told as you

549
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,080
google every single day and you google

550
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,000
and everybody says it doctors say the

551
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,080
chickenpox viruses the shingles are no

552
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,760
they're not they're two separate viruses

553
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,440
and now i've been saying that for over

554
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:00,160
35 years and now

555
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,840
doctors are starting to say that

556
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,000
just like the blood draw problem right

557
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:07,039
remember the blood draw problem

558
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,360
aw you're wrong you're wrong don't trust

559
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:11,919

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:14,240
from aw whatever you do take advice from

561
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,160
a licensed health professional

562
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,840
remember when i told you they're drawing

563
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,360
the blood and they're killing everybody

564
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,720
by over drawing the blood they're

565
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,400
throwing the blood out or doing

566
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,240
something worse with the blood when you

567
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,080
can ask for half files or quarter vials

568
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,600
and guess what now

569
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,000
it's getting out there

570
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,720
i'm always proven right

571
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,360
always so when i talk about poop oh i

572
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:38,720
can't trust jw anymore i'm not gonna i'm

574
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,400
because it says here on google

575
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,960
it says right here on google that aw is

576
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:50,320
wrong because google has all the answers

577
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,520
so let's go over some of the questions

578
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,760
we're talking about poop we're going to

579
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,600
do celery too if anybody just came on

580
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,520
here

581
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,559
i can't say enough about the machine you

582
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,440
guys know the machine the mm-900 it's at

583
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:02,799
omegajuicers.com right

584
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,559
and

585
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:06,159
it's a killer machine

586
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,600
right it's a medical device it's an

587
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,919
herbal extractor

588
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,440
and the price of food like i said six

589
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,000
months ago and i said a year ago you're

590
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,840
the price of food's gonna go up and

591
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,840
right got the inflation got the price of

592
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,559
food going up and every time i run a

593
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,840
celery stick through my mm-900 i'm

594
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:24,480
saving money

595
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,400
because it's squeezing more juice out of

596
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,240
the celery and i'm saving i'm buying

597
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,480
less celery and i told you guys about

598
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,480
this with the mm-900 how much i love it

599
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,159
it doesn't have the metal gears you know

600
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,080
the metal gears that are grinding

601
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,240
against each other so you get bits of

602
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,840
metal and you know what

603
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,039
when juicer companies with the metal

604
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,120
gears

605
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:45,200
try to do their like cleanup you know

606
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,919
like fire control like fire damage

607
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,400
control because it gets out about it and

608
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:52,720
they say no our metal gears never touch

609
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,880
each other that's insanity not only do

610
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,400
they touch each other they're grinding

611
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,320
against each other

612
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,919
as they're as they're grinding the food

613
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,360
they're also rubbing and grinding

614
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,120
against each other

615
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,679
i love how people like to do like you

616
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:08,159
know they like to do clean up like dying

617
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:10,240
out fires like that the truth is you

618
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,159
don't have metal gears grinding against

619
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,880
each other it's an incredible machine

620
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:18,080
and it's 72 dollars basically for 72 off

621
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:20,799
off omegajuicers.com

622
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:23,200
i was told by my doctor right the apple

623
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:25,200
absolute uh opposite statement floating

624
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,600
stool is a sign of not properly

625
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,520
digesting fats think about the drops of

626
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:32,880
oil in the water right

627
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:36,159
yes if you put straight oil on water it

628
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:39,200
will surface to the top

629
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:42,240
but our stools when our digestive system

630
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:45,520
isn't working has fat that's gone rancid

631
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,799
mixed in with protein and it sits like

632
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,880
lead

633
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:50,880
it sits like lead

634
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,080
that's what happens okay now what you'll

635
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,159
see is

636
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,640
cashews have air in them you have to

637
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,159
know that so there's a pocket inside a

638
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,840
cashew and i want to show you something

639
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:03,600
about a cashew right you see cashews

640
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,720
have an air pocket

641
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,039
air

642
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:10,480
floats the cashew you actually have to

643
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:12,000
open the cashew to let the air out

644
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,440
and that's that's important to know

645
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,640
right there

646
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,159
now what happens here okay

647
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,520
all right when you have a nut butter and

648
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:22,240
it's down here at the bottom you got all

649
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:25,120
that protein and you got all that fat

650
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,360
and that protein and fat is intertwined

651
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:30,000
with itself and it doesn't digest and

652
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:32,159
break down thoroughly and it sinks the

653
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,720
stool down to the bottom same thing with

654
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:37,440
chicken fat chicken fat

655
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:40,080
is mixed in with the protein so it's

656
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,000
protein and fat both combined protein

657
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,159
and fat goes rancid it's both combined

658
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,400
inside your gut and wonder each cl is

659
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:49,440
low and their digestive strength is weak

660
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:52,000
and your bile reserves are low

661
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,480
your food ferments

662
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,120
and it doesn't totally break down and

663
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:00,159
everything sinks to the bottom

664
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:02,559
that's what happens your stools sink

665
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:05,280
very important to know protein and fat

666
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:06,559
sinks to the bottom of the toilet bowl

667
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,840
now there's a question here that's

668
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,120
pretty funny right here and i just want

669
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,039
to make sure

670
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,640
i clear this up okay

671
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:15,200
all right and this is this is

672
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,120
interesting right here okay

673
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,520
so

674
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:22,799
someone says right here

675
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:24,480
floating and feeling fabulous

676
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,760
they feel incredible and they got a

677
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,840
floating stool

678
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:30,320
keep that in mind right that's something

679
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,159
that's very interesting all right

680
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,880
here's a question right here what if it

681
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,720
piles up so what if our poop piles up

682
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,760
out of the water

683
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,120
i'm just asking for a friend

684
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,320
first of all i think it's kind of funny

685
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,960
because

686
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,960
sure you're asking for a friend

687
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,480
no you probably are asking for a friend

688
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,480
uh-huh

689
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,960
yeah no sure you're asking for a friend

690
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,880
i believe that no no you probably are

691
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,760
asking for a friend right

692
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,799
sure

693
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,400
no yeah

694
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:00,559
no i don't know i don't know if you're

695
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,159
asking for a friend you probably are

696
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:04,080
what if it piles up out of the water

697
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,919
what happens is a lot of times people

698
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,240
have so much poop in them

699
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,520
that it's it's piling on top of each

700
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,520
other so

701
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,559
the poop will go down into the into the

702
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,320
toilet bowl right it'll be lodged up

703
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:19,600
maybe it'll be a hard poop and it'll be

704
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:21,679
lodged up right so the poople large will

705
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,440
lodge up right you'll get some poops to

706
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:25,600
lodge up or whatever and start building

707
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,720
up they're going to bypass the water to

708
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,400
the point where you're going to have

709
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,760
you might even have something where

710
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,600
you've got the tail end of the poop

711
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:37,279
which is softer

712
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:39,360
so the softer poop is higher up

713
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:40,480
okay and your intestinal tract and your

714
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,039
colon

715
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,279
so your descending colon

716
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:48,080
has softer poop in it so if you do a

717
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:49,679
really big poop or a long poop

718
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,600
you're gonna have softer so you might

719
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,760
even get a swirl on top so you might get

720
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,440
the harder poop is at the bottom so

721
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,600
that's at the bottom of your colon right

722
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,240
ready to come out so that actually comes

723
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,000
out right so you can pile that up in

724
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,240
your toilet to the point where your

725
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,640
water might only be this high

726
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,000
or your water might be only this high so

727
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,480
what's happening is your shit's just

728
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,559
piling up until you're out of the water

729
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,960
that's not floating that's just a lot of

730
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:18,720
 in a toilet bowl not enough water

731
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:20,400
and it's all kind of it's basically

732
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:23,039
showing itself above the water because

733
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,720
it's piled up above the water right

734
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:26,320
so that's that answers that question

735
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,320
which is really important

736
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,320
okay

737
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,600
so someone said floating poop is not a

738
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,880
good poop please don't listen to this

739
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,320
guy

740
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,120
all right

741
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,000
well that's a funny one really okay

742
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,600
because

743
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,200
what happens is that

744
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:46,480
there are people

745
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:48,240
who get their colons cut out every day

746
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,480
they get six inches of colon cut out and

747
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,640
then they get 20 inches of colon cut out

748
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,320
now they get more inches of colon in in

749
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,480
small intestinal then they get their

750
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,080
elio sql removed right

751
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,440
now they've got the colostomy back now

752
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,880
they're in really big trouble now

753
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,159
they're getting connected now they're

754
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,600
they're take some people are getting

755
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:06,320
their small intestinal tract and it's

756
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,919
being pulled on down and they remove

757
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,520
their colon altogether and their

758
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:11,840
intestinal tract is being pulled already

759
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,440
down right to the rectum right and now

760
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,880
now it's just their small intestinal

761
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,880
tract attached to the rectum

762
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,080
you have to understand something this is

763
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:23,919
important

764
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:27,600
all the while all that's been happening

765
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:27,600
all those years their poop was sinking

766
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:34,000
and don't listen to me

767
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:36,720
when science of research all they got

768
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,640
is snip and cut snip and cut

769
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,440
so when you got intestinal problems

770
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,279
right

771
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,799
when you have intestinal problems

772
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:46,559
because everything just falls right out

773
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:46,559
of here let me take a look here right

774
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:52,640
all they can do is give you steroids

775
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,760
anti-inflammatory

776
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:57,279
dangerous pharmaceutical

777
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,279
anti-inflammatory steroids

778
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,799
antibiotics

779
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,440
so they can give you and then they have

780
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:05,600
to cut you then they have to remove your

781
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,440
intestinal tract and colon

782
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,279
that's all medical science and research

783
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,000
has for intestinal tract problems now

784
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:13,679
functional medicine doctors they they'll

785
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,799
they'll just say you got some microbiome

786
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,240
that's off

787
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,679
right they'll study your poop but

788
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,600
they'll never measure how much fats in

789
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,880
your poop they don't look at that

790
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,399
they're just looking for different

791
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,159
things like they're looking for mold or

792
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:27,039
something they're testing for mold right

793
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:29,440
they're testing for yeast or mold

794
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:31,600
they're looking for those things

795
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,640
they're trying to actually look right

796
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:37,200
so sharon says former colostomy rn here

797
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:40,480
so many people getting colostomies

798
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,159
saddest job i've ever had and sharon

799
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,960
all those people

800
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:44,799
their

801
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,559
 was sinking to the bottom of the

802
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:48,720
toilet now let's get something straight

803
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:51,039
so nobody's having poop fear i don't

804
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,640
want poop fear happening here it's okay

805
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:54,480
if your poop sits at the bottom of the

806
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,360
toilet i never said it was a terrible

807
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,120
thing

808
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,960
you can be eating the healthiest diet

809
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,840
and it'll sit at the bottom for a while

810
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:04,640
until someday it'll take a mid-flight

811
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:06,240
because everybody has compacted rancid

812
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,240
fat and protein still lining their

813
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:11,200
intestinal tracts so even when you're

814
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:13,679
eating healthy for a long time

815
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,240
you're going to be now breaking off

816
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:19,200
little pieces that start to wrap around

817
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:21,039
the stool little pieces of rancid fat

818
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,720
and protein that are intertwined all on

819
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:24,080
the inside of the intestinal tract and

820
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,000
it's going to wrap around it and

821
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,080
actually get caught up

822
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,399
and it's going to sink

823
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,799
it's not a bad thing if your poop is

824
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:34,240
sinking so that's not the big thing here

825
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:37,760
i'm not trying to say that i'm saying

826
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:40,240
but for the healthiest poops there are

827
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,840
keeping fats out of the diet

828
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:45,200
right

829
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:47,600
like eating all raw right

830
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:50,399
raw fruits and vegetables raw oranges

831
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:52,240
raw berries raw spinach and as you're

832
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:54,080
cleaning up your intestinal tract long

833
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,240
term and bananas and you're cleaning out

834
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,720
your intestinal tract

835
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,240
the stools will start to mid-float

836
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,799
because you've cleaned out that

837
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,559
intestinal tract to such a degree

838
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:07,200
and you're not bombarding your liver

839
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:08,880
with so much fat you're not overdoing it

840
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,399
with the avocado you're not over doing

841
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,520
it with the nut butters you're not over

842
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,960
doing it

843
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,039
with all the nut butters and everything

844
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,399
else in the tahini right and what's

845
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:19,200
happening is you're giving your liver a

846
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:20,880
break so when you go raw

847
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,720
and you could do it cook too it's

848
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,559
steamed vegetables but if you go raw and

849
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,440
you keep the fats out

850
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:31,200
you get cleaned out over time where now

851
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:35,279
your poops are the healthiest poops ever

852
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:38,399
because they'll start to mid-float

853
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:40,720
the mid-float and they won't smell your

854
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:42,799
poops won't smell

855
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,720
people's poops smell because it's

856
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:48,320
ammonia

857
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:51,279
and it's rotting putrefying protein and

858
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:54,000
rotting rancid putrefied fat and that

859
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:57,679
rotting rancid putrified fat and protein

860
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,600
sits and it makes a streak in the toilet

861
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:00,960
you guys know about the streak

862
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,880
does anybody know about the toilet

863
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,360
streak

864
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,360
you know that toilet streak

865
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:11,039
that gets in there where the turd goes

866
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:12,720
down in there and then it just streaks

867
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:17,039
and you're like whoa that's a streak at

868
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,039
the bottom of my toilet that's fat

869
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:21,200
and that's protein

870
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,760
protein sticky

871
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:26,000
and fat becomes sticky with it and

872
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,679
they're both sticky

873
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,520
so what you're seeing when you eat a

874
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:31,200
whole bunch of nut butter and it hasn't

875
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,480
been digested

876
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,480
you've eaten a whole you've eaten a

877
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:37,840
whole bunch of nut butter

878
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,840
and it hasn't been digested

879
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,919
it creates a streak at the bottom of the

880
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,159
toilet

881
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:45,600
not only does your poop

882
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:47,679
sink

883
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,960
but you left a streak

884
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,399
as well

885
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,240
same thing with avocado

886
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:54,000
have a avocado

887
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,159
the fat

888
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,760
gets trapped inside the rest of the

889
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:01,919
debris in the stool

890
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,799
yes you you do absorb some of the

891
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:07,200
avocado yes you absorb some of the nut

892
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:09,120
butters and yes you absorb some of the

893
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,279
tahini and yes you absorb some of the

894
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,440
peanut butter and yes you do

895
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:16,240
but a lot of it you don't

896
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,760
because everybody has weak digestion

897
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,440
weak livers

898
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,799
all kinds of different food allergies

899
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,480
all kinds of different problems all

900
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:24,720
kinds of different issues

901
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,279
and their hdl is really low and what

902
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,760
happens is the streaks in the toilet

903
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:31,679
from their is from fat that's a fat

904
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,840
streak

905
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:36,399
if you took that streak in the toilet

906
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,760
and actually cleaned it out and ran a

907
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:41,360
test on it

908
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:43,760
it would be mostly fat and protein

909
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,760
and it's undigested it's not digested

910
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,600
it's not broken down properly it's all

911
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:50,159
rancid and that's the streak in your

912
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:52,159
toilet bowl

913
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:54,080
if you read the comments you'll see that

914
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:56,720
people had a field day on that one and

915
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,960
they were trying to rip me apart

916
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,799
and i thought it was you know

917
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,200
i thought it was fine i thought it was

918
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:05,200
great i want people to actually be i

919
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,159
want them to be challenged

920
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,600
right

921
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:09,200
in the sense where they so they could

922
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,279
learn right

923
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,799
and but you don't see really people say

924
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:14,480
you know what he could be right because

925
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:16,880
you're right because all they do is cut

926
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,559
people's guts right out all they do is

927
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,640
just remove everybody's colons and

928
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:22,799
everything i never thought about it you

929
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:25,440
know you know aw you might be right that

930
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:27,360
people with colitis crohn's ibs people

931
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,200
with sibo all their sinks to the

932
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,039
bottom so why am i saying it's a healthy

933
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,960
 when literally these people are

934
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:34,320
suffering i know people that literally

935
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,919
all these years they're walking around

936
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,760
like this they're hurting they're

937
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:42,120
bloating and distention and their poop

00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:42,120
sink down to the bottom of the toilet

939
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,200
but google's right

940
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:48,399
so let's talk about you know let's talk

941
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,360
about how it works a little bit more

942
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:53,600
we're going into this you guys

943
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,799
this is a fun show for me because i

944
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,320
haven't seen you guys in a while and

945
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:57,519
it's really great to see you guys i'm

946
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,720
glad i'm here

947
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:00,159
right

948
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,000
listen from natasha says this

949
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:03,600
information is golden helping so many

950
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,440
people thank you so much for you in

951
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,640
spirit of compassion i'm honored you're

952
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,080
here

953
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,519
truly

954
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,640
you know and i was looking at some of

955
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:12,159
these other

956
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,519
other questions which is interesting

957
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:15,360
someone said i thought it could also

958
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:17,600
mean you have a lot of gas in your bm

959
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:21,039
for it to float like all the gas in your

960
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:22,720
digestion is causing it to float right

961
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:24,559
so here's how it works

962
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,960
when you truly

963
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:28,720
absorb all the fat out of your food and

964
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,799
you truly absorb

965
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,840
all of it out of your food and your

966
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:36,640
protein you absorb and utilize when you

967
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:38,720
absorb and utilize your protein and fat

968
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,640
your stool

969
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,320
is light

970
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:45,840
it's light

971
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:47,679
it's just fiber

972
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,840
and fiber

973
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:52,080
will float

974
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:54,159
so when you have such a sharp digestive

975
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,640
tract it is so strong it's lightening

976
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:58,480
fast strong too the fats get totally

977
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,399
used immediately

978
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,399
the proteins get utilized and broken

979
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:04,559
down immediately

980
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:06,399
the rest of that stool is going to be

981
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:08,320
fiber and that fiber is going to come

982
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:10,639
out in a stool form and it's going to be

983
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:13,119
light and it's not going to have smell

984
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:15,760
so it'll float because it's light

985
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:15,760
it's light

986
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,679
it's a really important thing to know

987
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,359
somebody could have really bad gas and

988
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:25,520
they could have so much problem they

989
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:28,320
could sit like rotting like everything's

990
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:30,800
rotting inside of them to such a degree

991
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,839
that they can have an ammonia gas filled

992
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:37,919
stool that does float

993
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:40,159
right but most everybody most everybody

994
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:43,520
the ship sinks

995
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:45,839
the ship sinks in that toilet

996
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:48,240
billions of people on this planet every

997
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:50,720
morning go to bathroom and they look in

998
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:53,040
their toilet and their sinks

999
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:55,200
and they're dropping like flies they're

1000
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:57,520
dying like flies right now we have

1001
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:59,760
people dying like flies in the united

1002
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:02,160
states everywhere and their was

1003
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,320
thinking we have people dying everywhere

1004
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:07,920
around the planet in hospitals dying at

1005
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,920
home and their is sinking

1006
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,240
it's really sad

1007
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:17,359
right

1008
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:19,599
so someone said i came to the comments

1009
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:20,720
just to see if anyone else had the same

1010
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,960
thoughts

1011
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,320
totally backwards from what i was taught

1012
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,920
in college

1013
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,119
so i'm scratching my head on that one

1014
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,560
because

1015
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,520
what you're taught in college is all

1016
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,520
right

1017
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,040
all that's like

1018
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:35,520
all that's correct

1019
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:38,079
because that's that's a funny one there

1020
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:40,320
so everything you learn in college

1021
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:41,760
is ironclad

1022
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,280
correct

1023
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,520
everything you if you learn in college

1024
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,200
that shingles is the is the chickenpox

1025
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,960
virus like they'll teach in medical

1026
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,480
college

1027
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,160
but yet it's not they're two different

1028
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,359
viruses and nephrologists actually are

1029
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,640
starting to they're starting to talk

1030
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,560
about that now two different viruses

1031
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:59,040
i've been talking about 35 years how'd

1032
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,720
that one escape it's like they're wrong

1033
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,880
in college all the time they're wrong in

1034
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,720
universities all the time university

1035
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:08,400
studies are all hypotheses and they

1036
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:11,119
change by the month and by the year

1037
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,400
yes you were taught wrong in college

1038
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:14,640
absolutely

1039
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:17,040
everything

1040
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,800
and here's what's funny

1041
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,640
everything i teach

1042
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,000
has been the opposite of what anybody's

1043
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:24,400
known in health

1044
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:27,200
and if you hear something out there that

1045
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,640
is the same it came from medical medium

1046
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,160
information i know you guys don't like

1047
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,599
to hear that i know some people just

1048
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,040
hate hearing that

1049
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:35,200
but it's true

1050
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,079
but what am i going to do

1051
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,240
not

1052
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:40,560
say what it is i've been teaching this

1053
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,960
stuff for 35 years

1054
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:45,200
and have paved the way

1055
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:47,280
like on the frontier of health all these

1056
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,640
years with so many things it's it's

1057
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,320
actually couldn't count them there's so

1058
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:52,400
many now and i was going to do a podcast

1059
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:54,560
someday and show you all the things that

1060
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,079
were published by medical medium or are

1061
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,520
you know released by medical medium and

1062
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:59,359
how they get figured out later and

1063
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:01,599
proven right we're gonna do one of those

1064
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:02,400
that'll be fun

1065
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,760
but

1066
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,119
i can't cover everything today because

1067
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,400
we're gonna do a series on the poop

1068
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:08,079
because there's so much we're gonna be

1069
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,599
covering and talking about we're going

1070
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:11,440
to cover all these questions we're going

1071
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:13,599
to go into details about these questions

1072
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:16,240
too

1073
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:16,240
so and

1074
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,560
very important so someone was worried

1075
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,079
and they say great there goes my life

1076
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,599
i'm a sinker so someone was worried

1077
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:25,040
because their was sinking right so

1078
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:27,359
they were like great there goes my life

1079
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,640
no not at all it's okay if your poops

1080
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:29,760
are sinking and it's okay if you're

1081
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,040
eating healthy and your poops are

1082
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,880
sinking

1083
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,000
everybody on a keto diet their poops are

1084
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,200
sinking

1085
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,359
because it's filled with all that fat

1086
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:40,160
and protein poops are sinking right so

1087
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:41,920
it's okay if your poops are sinking it's

1088
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,280
not something to fear it's not something

1089
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,839
to be worried about it's not something

1090
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:48,000
to be scared about or scared over so all

1091
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:49,680
that's important to know too so let's

1092
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,960
use some celery and that's then that's

1093
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:53,359
where we're heading now it just means

1094
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:56,240
you're in a work in progress your

1095
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:59,200
intestinal tract is still trying to heal

1096
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:01,280
your liver is still trying to heal it's

1097
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,880
all in the process of healing and we

1098
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,880
need to understand that that's a big

1099
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,320
part of it all if it's in the process of

1100
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,200
healing

1101
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,680
then

1102
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,680
you got to be open to that right look

1103
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:14,320
someone with colitis

1104
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:15,839
their poop is thinking

1105
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:18,880
someone with

1106
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:21,680
ibs their poop is sinking this is the

1107
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:24,079
way it is right caroline barrett says

1108
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:26,800

it's helped so many people

1117
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:49,280
gastrointestinal problems

1118
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:51,040
it's it's

1119
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,680
it's

1120
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:56,079
crazy at this point how many people are

1121
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:59,040
getting better from it

1122
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:59,040
it's really amazing

1123
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:03,839
are you making celery juice motivation

1124
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:05,920
right here oh that's incredible this

1125
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:09,119
strengthens the hydrochloric acid so we

1126
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,119
have to understand what that is

1127
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,400
so your stomach

1128
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,160
right

1129
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,160
your stomach

1130
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:19,040
that's where your hcl is produced right

1131
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:21,040
there everybody has a stomach you guys

1132
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:23,599
you have a stomach

1133
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:25,680
just so you know

1134
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:28,880
you have a stomach

1135
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:31,520
that stomach has stomach glands

1136
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:34,079
so there's tiny stomach lands inside

1137
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:36,400
here that's what proves produces your

1138
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:38,880
hcl is those stomach glands that's

1139
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,839
really important to know right

1140
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,160
because

1141
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:44,079
your stomach lands

1142
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,040
they weaken over the years and they get

1143
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:47,280
shot

1144
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:49,520
everybody walks around and their stomach

1145
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,960
glands are just obliterated they're like

1146
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,359
they're damaged

1147
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,280
people have annihilated stomach glands

1148
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:58,640
where they're not even working anymore

1149
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:00,400
their hydrochloric acid is non-existent

1150
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:02,160
they're not digesting their proteins

1151
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,400
they're not digesting their fats and

1152
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:06,720
their poops are sinking to the bottom of

1153
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:08,800
the toilet it's fine but you can start

1154
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:10,319
getting your hcl stronger and you can

1155
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,000
start getting your liver stronger you

1156
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:14,960
can start getting your stomach land

1157
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,359
stronger and your poops can still sink

1158
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:19,119
because you're not all the way there yet

1159
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:20,319
but you're gonna get all the way there

1160
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:21,440
yet

1161
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:22,800
right

1162
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:26,480
celery juice

1163
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:28,319
kills the bad bacteria

1164
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:30,319
that's another thing too

1165
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:31,760
right the reason why people have all

1166
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:33,599
this bad bacteria thriving in their

1167
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:37,599
intestinal tract it's feeding off of

1168
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:40,079
rotting protein and rotting rancid fat

1169
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:41,920
that's what it's feeding off of

1170
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:43,119
keep that in mind it's really important

1171
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,040
too right

1172
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:47,280
the juicer link is in the bio you got

1173
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:50,000
bio you guys in the bile the juicer link

1174
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,599

1175
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,200
it's it's in the bio right there you

1176
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:57,599
guys the mm-900 hds

1177

what i love about the hds you guys know

1178
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:01,920
right you guys have it is you squeeze

1179
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,800
more celery juice

1180
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,960
out

1181
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:08,720
you squeeze more celery juice you have a

1182
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:10,480
smaller food bill right

1183
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:13,280
you have a smaller food bill and that's

1184
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:15,119
what's really cool about it juicing is

1185
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,839
not a joke

1186
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:20,240
it literally is a life-saving tool a

1187
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:22,960
life-saving tool

1188
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:24,880
i can't tell you how many times a

1189
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:27,599
cucumber juice which you can juice in

1190
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:30,240
here a cucumber juice has brought a

1191
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:31,200
fever down for children all through the

1192
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,520
years

1193
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:36,000
i can't tell you how many times a celery

1194
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:38,960
juice has neutralized acids and has

1195
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,040
stopped somebody from aging and is made

1196
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,119
so their cramping and their gas problems

1197
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,560
went away right i work with omega you

it doesn't look like that it's probably

1233
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:05,240
not the mm-900

1234
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:08,660

out like educating people about medical

1253
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:56,000
medium information

1254
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:58,000
i really appreciate it

1255
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,000
thank you uma

1256
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,040
so i got some celery juice right here so

1257
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,040
i like to strain it

1258
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,319
right

1259
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:08,400
you got to think about it right

1260
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:10,640
now remember i mean when we eat food we

1261
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,560
just forget we have the stomach even

1262
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:14,640
though we know it's there but we don't

1263
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:16,400
know what's there you can't see it you

1264
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:18,960
just eat and you're like okay let's just

1265
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,800
move on but inside that stomach the

1266
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,480
minute something falls in that stomach

1267
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,079
so let's get some nuts or something so

1268
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:26,000
let's do that

1269
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:28,319
let's get some almonds

1270
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,520
the minute you eat something and those

1271
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:31,520
almonds

1272
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,720
end up in the stomach right so they go

1273
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,160
down and they end up in the stomach so

1274
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:36,960
i'm putting some almonds in the stomach

1275
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:38,640
right here see so the minute that

1276
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,240
happens

1277
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,839
okay

1278
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,960
these little stomach lands inside the

1279
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:44,960
stomach

1280
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:47,440
these little stomach glands

1281
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:50,560
release gastric juice

1282
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:52,400
hcl hydrochloric acid medical medium

1283
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:55,359
information

1284
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:57,200
says that hcl is not one acid it's seven

1285
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:59,280
different assets so it's a blend science

1286
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,720
research doesn't know that yet but just

1287
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,720
like it always happens science of

1288
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:04,560
research ends up either poaching medical

1289
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:06,480
media information or discovering

1290
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:08,240
something later on this medical medium

1291
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,800
and they're going to say how hcl isn't

1292
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:12,960
one acid and how it's very complex so

1293
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:14,720
gastric acid that comes out of the the

1294
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,920
glands here stomach lens is really

1295
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,680
complex

1296
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,520
and when that gastric acid comes out

1297
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:21,200
it's supposed to break down the protein

1298
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:23,680
inside that nut

1299
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:25,280
so when you eat the job there for those

1300
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:27,920
glands is to break down the protein but

1301
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,880
it doesn't break it down so now these

1302
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,680
nuts

1303
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,720
right

1304
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:34,560
start to

1305
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:34,560
leave your intestinal tract

1306
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:38,480
that nut just sunk down to the bottom of

1307
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,680
the water there

1308
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,440
look at that

1309
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:43,440
interesting right

1310
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,640
those nuts are high in fat i wonder why

1311
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,720
they're sinking

1312
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,160
just sinking down to the bottom you know

1313
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:51,040
like

1314
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:52,319
it's nuts just sink down to the bottom

1315
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,760
unbelievable

1316
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:55,440
so

1317
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:57,280
we're back here

1318
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:59,520
when you drink that celery juice you're

1319
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:02,240
restoring those stomach glands

1320
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:04,079
it strengthens that hcl and here's the

1321
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:06,319
thing people don't know no one knows

1322
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:06,319
this

1323
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:13,200
you kill off those viruses and bacteria

1324
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:16,960
each pylori gets killed off

1325
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:19,359
right you kill off h pylori

1326
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:23,040
so what you're doing is your hcl is your

1327
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:24,880
weapon that is your anti-bug weapon

1328
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:28,400
that's your critter weapon

1329
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:30,319
that's your anti-critter weapon

1330
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,839
i hear because i was using critter as

1331
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:33,760
bugs i hear a bunch of people now out

1332
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:36,000
there using the word critter right but

1333
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:38,880
they don't say they got it from aw they

1334
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,480
just start using it whatever

1335
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:43,040
bottom line is

1336
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:45,119
here it is the critters and that hcl is

1337
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:46,880
your critter destroyer right there it

1338
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:49,200
kills the critters

1339
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:50,720
your hydrochloric acid has to rebuild

1340
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:53,520
and celery juice rebuilds your

1341
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:56,880
hydrochloric acid hydrochloric acid so

1342
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:58,640
you can destroy the bad guys those evil

1343
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:03,280
ugly critters that in your gut each

1344
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:04,160
pylori e coli c diff staff streptococcus

1345
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:07,040
right

1346
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:08,960
food poisoning bugs salmonella

1347
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:10,880
so what happens is that your hdl

1348
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:12,480
destroys that so when you eat some

1349
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:14,400
undercooked chicken in some restaurant

1350
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:17,359
that you don't die that night instead

1351
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:19,280
you just throw up and vomit and diarrhea

1352
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:20,640
right you can do all three at once i

1353
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,000
don't know throw up and vomit i guess

1354
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:23,760
you can do just

1355
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,040
one sometimes you throw up sometimes

1356
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,559
your vomiting whatever you're hugging

1357
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:28,800
the toilet

1358
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:31,119
but the whole point is is that when your

1359
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,800
hcl is strong it might be that brinker

1360
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:34,800
it might stop you from getting that food

1361
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,640
poisoning really bad that day it might

1362
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,480
stop your h pylori from creating an

1363
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:40,960
ulcer it might stop the e coli from

1364
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,640
creating an ulcer it does even more than

1365
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,400
that it even helps you in so many ways

1366
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:46,880
when your heat shield breaks down

1367
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:48,480
everything and that's important

1368
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:50,800
so what i love about the

1369
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:53,760
mm-900

1370
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:55,520
the containers much drier

1371
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:57,040
than any of the other juicers out there

1372
00:47:55,520 --> 00:48:00,160
that i've ever used

1373
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:02,240
so that means the juice was squeezed out

1374
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:03,760
the pulp is drier

1375
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:05,599
and that's the whole point right so

1376
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,880
you're just getting more out of what

1377
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:08,400
you're juicing and that's what i love

1378
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:11,040
about the 900

1379
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:13,200
carly says juicer is the best one i ever

1380
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:15,599
used it's worth the money

1381
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:18,839
you use less celery and get more juice

1382
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:22,160
aw is a godsend

1383
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:24,240
incredible i love that

1384
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:26,079
all right so let's strain it gotta

1385
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:28,079
strain it

1386
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:29,200
because it's herbal medicine

1387
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:30,319
you don't

1388
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:32,480
eat

1389
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:35,040
the tea bag right

1390
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:38,400
you don't eat the tea you don't open up

1391
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:40,960
the tea is what you don't do right

1392
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:43,440
so keep that in mind

1393
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:45,040
so when you have your lemon balm tea or

1394
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:47,040

1395
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:49,040

wrong this and that google this and

1452
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:49,119
they'll tell you differently right and

1453
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,720
then people are like oh i'm gonna

1454
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:52,640
unfollow medical medium he was always

1455
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:55,680
right before but now it takes the cakes

1456
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:58,800
he's wrong

1457
00:50:55,680 --> 00:51:00,640
all right let's strain this celery juice

1458
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:03,359
i'm not trying to crack myself up here

1459
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:06,079
for some reason i do a little

1460
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:08,079
hello anthony i don't have a gallbladder

1461
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:10,720
how celery juice affect digestion well

1462
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:12,319
there's no fat in the celery juice it's

1463
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:14,000
not an overt fat

1464
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:16,240
it's a herbal medicine

1465
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,559
i i've always used that for people

1466
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:20,079
without gallbladders it's very helpful

1467
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:21,839
because every time i drink celery juice

1468
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:23,440
i get cramps and diarrhea but i feel

1469
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:24,880
better next day you feel better next day

1470
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:27,520
what that is

1471
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:29,760
is you're killing off these

1472
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:31,359
you're killing off these guys

1473
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:33,680
because there's a good chance you lost

1474
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:34,800
your gallbladder because something got

1475
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:37,119
in there

1476
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:39,200
and created a problem like some of these

1477
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:40,880
guys got in there and now you're killing

1478
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:42,800
these guys you're knocking them out and

1479
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:44,400
killing them off you might cramp up for

1480
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:46,000
a minute because when one of these guys

1481
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:47,280
dies right here one of these critters

1482
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,680
dies inside of you because everybody's

1483

effective good question sarah

1561
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:37,119
if it's juiced fresh

1562
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:38,960
did someone juice it in the store did

1563
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:40,720
they actually run it through a juicer at

1564
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,319
one point and put it on the shelf saying

1565
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:44,559
only good for like one day because it's

1566
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:47,200
freshly juiced or

1567
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:49,280
is it in a bottle saying it's fresh and

1568
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,640
they're lying to you

1569
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:52,559
they're lying

1570
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:54,799
it's in a bottle and it's called high

1571
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:57,760
pressure pasteurization high pressure

1572
00:54:54,799 --> 00:55:00,319
pasteurization and what that is hpp is

1573
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:02,640
that is screwing people over so when you

1574
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:04,240
buy hpp and you go up there like i want

1575
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:06,880
to buy that celery juice oh that looks

1576
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:10,240
like fresh raw celery juice let me buy

1577
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:11,920
that off the shelf and it's hpp

1578
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:14,319
you just got ripped off it's not going

1579
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:16,240
to work as good not even a fraction is

1580
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:18,480
good with celery juice it can't be

1581
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:20,240
pasteurized and it'll say raw and it

1582
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:23,440
will say unpasteurized but that's not

1583
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:25,359
true hpp's high pressure pasteurization

1584
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:27,760
that's important to know everybody ask

1585
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:30,880
about that all the time

1586
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:33,520
