all right so supplement section

140
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,840
on page 57 of this book so i want to get

141
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,800
to there right now

142
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,080
right so when someone has autoimmune

143
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,000
because that's what's going to happen

144
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,280
you're going to everybody maybe you

145
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,360
maybe your friend maybe your family

146
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,080
member can be diagnosed with autoimmune

147
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,120
okay you may not be told it's autoimmune

148
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,600
right away

149
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,199
but you you'll be given a diagnosis

150
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,320
because that's what happens and here's

151
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,120
the direction

152
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,000
of medical research and science right

153
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,440
now okay

154
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,160
the direction is for everybody

155
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,000
to get a diagnosis that ends up falling

156
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,759
in the category of autoimmune

157
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,360
so that's the direction like that's

158
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,440
their goal and

159
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,240
their goal is to make sure that

160
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:25,280
everybody is in the direction of

161
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,160
the of autoimmune their goal is to be in

162
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,720
that direction

163
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,560
because it takes the blame off of

164
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,520
medical research and science

165
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,919
that's what the autoimmune tag is about

166
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,000
so

167
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,320
you can get a name you can get a brand

168
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,880
new name for your illness

169
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,479
this year coming on and the year after

170
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,919
this year and the year after this year

171
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,560
next few years there's going to be a lot

172
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:50,479
of new diagnoses coming on

173
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,919
a lot of new names developing

174
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,880
because a lot of people are going to

175
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:56,960

176
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:58,960

so what happens is they need to funnel

190
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,280
the medical industry needs the funnel

191
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,120
your aches and pains your tingles and

192
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,800

your body's symptoms are gonna get

200
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,600
funneled into autoimmune that's where

201
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,000
they're gonna get funneled into so i'm

202
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:54,560
just letting you know

203
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,560
and and

204
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,720
most all of these diseases and symptoms

205
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:02,400
are going to

206
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:04,880
end up being neurological okay

207
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,319
that's what they are and so there's

208
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,599
going to be coming like

209
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,440
so many people already dealing with

210
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,039

00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,800
already out there dealing with symptoms

219
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,800
right

220
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,639
250 million americans alone

221
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,199
in the u.s have symptoms that are

222
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:36,720
neurological 250

223
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:39,280
million have neurological symptoms right

224
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,400
even if they're mild to really mild just

225
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:44,080
headaches

226
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:46,400
okay maybe some tingles once in a while

227
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,440
but they got them right they got them

228
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,160
but

229
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,800
coming pretty soon in these next few

230
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,879
years

231
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,280
is going to be neurological symptoms and

232
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,759
an epic proportion

233
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,599
never seen before in our history all

234
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:04,080
right that's what's coming

235
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:05,199
and so um

236
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,120
and i you know and i've got to be

237
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,560
careful to what degree and what i say

238
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,759
about this so i won't go into

239
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:14,080
those details but they're coming

240
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,000
anyway so medical medium information is

241
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,120
going to be needed more than ever before

242
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,440
in history it already

243
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,720
is and it's being used but man what's

244
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,840
coming it's going to be

245
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:26,000
really on a level no one's ever seen

246
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,360
but all these symptoms that people are

247
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,160
going to be getting

248
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,919
are all going to be lumped into

249
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,519
autoimmune they're going to be packaged

250
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,200
up they'll come up with new names but

251
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,360
they're going to be packaged up to

252
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,479
autoimmune right so what the medical

253
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,120
industry is going to do is they're going

254
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,880
to funnel all of that to autoimmune

255
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,720
and send it all the way into the

256
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,399
autoimmune basket

257
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,000
autoimmune autoimmune it's just going to

258
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,360
go all the way in there and the reason

259
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,120
why is it protects

260
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,200
medical research and science because

261
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,000
it's put on you so now it's all your

262
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,120
fault

263
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,200
it's all your body's fault and and we we

264
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,240
we can easily get sucked into that one

265
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,560
i'm sick

266
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,000
i got some fatigue i can't explain it i

267
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,440
got brain fog

268
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,160
i got flashing lights in my eyes i can't

269
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,640
see i'm

270
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,680
dizzy all the time i'm in i can't find

271
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,880
my balance

272
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,720
i'm not feeling good it is my fault it

273
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,720
is because my doctor says

274
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,880
i got autoimmune and so if i got

275
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,640
autoimmune that means that my body is

276
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:26,080
attacking itself

277
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:28,000
so that's where it goes so um

278
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,760
anyway and the reason why it goes into

279
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,680
autoimmune like i said is to protect the

280
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,839
medical industry that's one of the big

281
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,080
reasons and autoimmune means cause

282
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,240
unknown

283
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,240
that's what it means so they say well

284
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,399
it's your body turning against itself

285
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,680
it's your body's immune system attacking

286
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,720
your glands

287
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:50,160
and your organs but still

288
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,839
cause unknown they don't know why

289
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,360
your immune system is attacking your

290
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,040
organs but your

291
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,880
immune system isn't attacking its organs

292
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,880
that's just the theory that's just their

293
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,839
theory their excuse if that's what it

294
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,320
might be

295
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,000
that's what it must be because here at

296
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,839
medical research and science we know

297
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,680
everything and when medical research

298
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,680
decides knows everything then

299
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,519
you're the one that's got the problem

300
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,000
it's your body's faulty and that's how

301
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,480
it works

302
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
anyway um and i want to talk about

303
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,959
neurological symptoms a little bit so i

304
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,320
got the brain

305
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:23,360
in there too so

306
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,600
when medical medium books are

307
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,880
fairly easy to use you just have to

308
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,760
spend a little energy

309
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,760
and get familiar with them right so

310
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:35,120
that's medical medium new edition i also

311
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,120
have cleanse the heel right here too

312
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,440
on page 57 it says supplements for

313
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,399
autoimmune disorders

314
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,959
and diseases okay later stage

315
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,680
epstein-barr because

316
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,640
medical median books has revealed the

317
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,440
truth about

318
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,839
autoimmune diseases being viral so

319
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:59,839
that's epstein-barr

320
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:01,760
so it says including lupus and r.a

321
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,720
rheumatoid arthritis right

322
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,320
um and if you look here it says if you

323
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,079
have a condition

324
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,600

they're herbs yes fruits and vegetables

387
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,160
too

388
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,440
and medical medium protocols are

389
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,839

disease if you guys are dealing with

398
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,560

404
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,800
says

405
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,680
work up to 32 ounces twice a day if

406
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,440

muffs

510
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,439

looking for options because their

567
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,799
situations are perplexing to them

568
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,919

569
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,919
that's you

then delve into the treasure trove of

571
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,120
options in the form of specialized

572
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,960
supplement lists for individual symptoms

and conditions in this book so you

574
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,880
can delve into that specialization

575
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,720
that's in here

576
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,559
okay it's important to know that our

577
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,280
deficiencies are a big part of why we're

578
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,760
sick so

579
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,640
deficiencies a big part of why we're

580
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,760
sick

581
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,799
zinc for example is practically

582
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,320
non-existent

583
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:41,600
in our food today so zinc

584
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:44,960
is non-existent in our food today

585
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:46,960
animal proteins all of it alike

586
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,280
all right some in secrets behind chronic

587
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,280
mystery illness and how to finally heal

588
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,679
and then do addition critical

589
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:56,960
information for people that need to heal

590
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:59,760
need to move forward so zinc

591
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,640
is a deficiency everybody has so the

592
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,039
reason why

593
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,720
people don't move forward in many

594
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,679
situations is because they're zinc

595
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,280
deficient

596
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:11,520
so this is an example right here

597
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,720
a zinc deficiency lowers the immune

598
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,880
system

599
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,480
so we're always in need of it so a zinc

600
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,520
deficiency

601
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,600
lowers our immune system

602
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,919
so then we become more susceptible

603
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:28,240
austin good to see you tonight

604
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:30,240
all right um just so important

605
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,760
we also have a lot of toxic heavy metals

606
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,120
in us and

607
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,760
spirulina spirulina is critical for

608
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,559
removing

609
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,760
the toxic heavy metals so you guys see

610
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,600
where it's going

611
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,360
you see where you got different options

612
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,480
you can start with hey i'll start with a

613
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,559
little celery juice

614
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,520
let me remove a few foods that's fine

615
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,200
too right

616
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,200
what kind of foods well he talks about

617
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,760
in here let's remove some foods

618
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,919
okay so that's right there and then it's

619
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,679
like well i want to move along quicker i

620
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,039
want to get this further along i want to

621
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,320
make this happen so let's

622
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,080
get into some of the supplements he's

623
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,840
saying everybody's got zinc deficiencies

624
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:06,480
so i'm showing you guys how this works

625
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,080
everybody's got zinc deficiencies so and

626
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,760
that's why it's important

627
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,200
so that's a zinc right there so that's

628
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,120
the vimergy zinc right

629
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,480
and that's the one i use for my friends

630
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,679
and family and

631
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,000
there's a supplement directory at

632
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,960
medicalmedium.com so you know the safest

633
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,039
stuff

634
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,799
more effective stuff without the alcohol

635
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,559
and the natural flavors and the msg and

636
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:27,360
everything else that goes wrong

637
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:29,360
and so the point is is like just the

638
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,960
zinc deficiency alone can move

639
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,039
someone forward so if someone's got the

640
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,400
tinnitus they got the vertigo

641
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,159
they got the burning skin they got the

642
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,919
aches and pains they got the fatigue

643
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:40,480
they get their autoimmune diagnosis if

644
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:43,039
someone has that autoimmune diagnosis

645
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,799
whatever it is you can look up your your

646
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:46,559
diagnosis to see if it's listed under

647
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,360
autoimmune right you can look that up

648
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:50,480
out there

649
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:53,919
but if you have an autoimmune condition

650
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:55,120
you'll see zinc inside the book right

651
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:58,320
here and then you'll see

652
00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:01,200
dosages okay and a zinc deficiency

653
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,919
is a big one for people that's a huge

654
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,400
one it's a

655
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:06,159
zinc up to two dropper fulls twice a day

656
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,679
so someone with autoimmune it gives you

657
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:11,280
the dosages right here

658
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:15,520
up to two dropper fulls twice a day

659
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:18,320
of zinc so i'm giving you guys a window

00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,360
what did he do he gave you a whole bunch

721
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,720

722
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:36,240
probiotics did it help it didn't

723
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:39,200
all right he said that you had parasites

724
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,159
okay well did it did it fix it what did

725
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,559
he do

726
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:44,240
all right it didn't fix it what did your

727
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:46,159
last doctor do though didn't you have a

728
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,640
pretty good doctor before that

729
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,279
that doctor got you on a keto diet

730
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,960
really

731
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:53,039
it kind of helped a little bit because

732
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,559
he got you off of oh got you off of

733
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,720
those processed foods

734
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,320
okay all right well that's good at least

735
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:01,360
he got you off some processed foods

736
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:03,679
right what did he say your problem was

737
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,559
he said that your body was attacking

738
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:06,640
itself

739
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:08,799
so you had like an autoimmune and your

740
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:11,520
body was attacking itself all right

741
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:13,760
what did your doctor say before that so

742
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:16,799
you had a doctor before that he said

743
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:18,799
he said that you you it was idiopathic

744
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:20,080
all your symptoms just they weren't

745
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,279
really real because you couldn't find

746
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,400
anything wrong

747
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:27,440
that's your fourth doctor really

748
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,880
well all right well look all i know is

749
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,720
if you take a look at the book you'll

750

juice that's one option right there you

786
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,960
can take away the no foods you can take

787
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,919
away the foods that are troublemaker

788
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,679

okay so i'm in here

790
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:54,080
critical critical tips all right so

791
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,520
where to start

792
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,200
once you've found your symptom or

793
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,720
condition okay

794
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,039
remember that once you've found your

795
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,919
symptom or condition in the books

796
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:04,400
and you learn about what is wrong like

797
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,000
why

798
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,840
am i dealing with the symptom or

799
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,760
condition all right

800
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,039
you don't need to take every supplement

801
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:14,240
listed in here

802
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:15,600
for it if you're sensitive you can try

803
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,520
one supplement a day

804
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,960
if not you can put them all together as

805
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,640
your daily regimen

806
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,640
as a middle ground you can choose a

807
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,760
couple to start with and then take it

808
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,000
from there

809
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,720
celery juice is always a good place to

810
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,159
begin beyond that vitamin b12 is another

811
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,679
place

812
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,080
so that's the b12 right there that's the

813
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:35,120
beemer's eb12 can ask your doctor what's

814
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,559
right for you

815
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,559
perfectly fine you can take this to your

816
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:39,279
doctor see if your doctor agrees with it

817
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,640
or not

818
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:43,039
i want you guys to do whatever you feel

819
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,399
like you know you need to do

820
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:46,640
i recommend family and friends like

821
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:48,799
that's the b12 so that's an example

822
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,720
zinc is another another one too so a

823
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:53,760
good place to start is the zinc

824
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:56,720
the b12 the vitamin c

825
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:58,399
so vitamin c is the the microc is the

826
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,880
one i use right there so that's the one

827
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:01,039
i use

828
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,159
you guys can use what you want to use

829
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:04,399
but there's reason why

830
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,159
i like the better stuff because the

831
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:09,440
details matter because you

832
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:12,720
you move forward so much better okay

833
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,760
and lemon balm so it's it's that's a

834
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,360
place to start

835
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,919
when you're when you're dealing with a

836
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:20,399
problem it's like you got the b12 you

837
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:23,039
got the vitamin c you got the lemon balm

838
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:25,120
you got the zinc that's a great place to

839
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,720
start okay

840
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,200
bring in those then if you're ready to

841
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:33,360
move forward and your list contains

842
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:35,520
spirulina curcumin cat's claw or lysine

843
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,120
those are the next ones in so there's

844
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,840
the spirulina right

845
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:41,440
and then there's the cat's claw right

846
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,320
and then there's the lysine

847
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,600
right here okay and and you can bring

848
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,320
those in next

849
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:50,159
and add those in later on if you're not

850
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,200
experiencing what you want from these

851
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:53,120
supplements

852
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,039
you can add a few more from your list

853
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,559
and you can always take smaller amounts

854
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:57,520
than the listed dosages if you're

855
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,440
sensitive

856
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,799
right you also have the option to enter

857
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,559
mixed supplements from the different

858
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:03,279
lists in the book any supplement from

859
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:12,799
this book

860
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:18,159
is an option to use

861
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:18,159
so um sun moon you got a question

862
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,360
it's do we take the supplements with

863
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:26,000
food or without food

864
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:27,360
okay the book sun sun moon good question

865
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,840
sun moon love that's a really cool

866
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,520
handle

867
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:34,240
it's an awesome handle um yeah you can

868
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:36,159
you can you got to read the book right

869
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:39,360
and you'll find it in there

870
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:41,520
so the answer will be in there okay um

871
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,799
you don't have to take supplements with

872
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,600
food

873
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:46,240
or without food okay you can go either

874
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,320
or

875
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,080
and that's important to know because

876
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:53,760
here's how it works it's like

877
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,080
people will people will take supplements

878
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,840
with

879
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:58,000
no food at all so they'll just take the

880
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,440
supplements and no food

881
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,279
and when people just take the

882
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,760
supplements and no food

883
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,880
okay they don't have enough glucose in

884
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,480
their bloodstream so

885
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:10,399
glucose is really important so eating

886
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,159
some time before supplements or eating

887
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:13,600
sometime after supplements is always a

888
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:14,880
good idea that's what i that's what i've

889
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,159
always told doctors to tell their

890
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,640
patients

891
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:20,240
you can do what your doctor wants you to

892
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,799
do in the whole bid and whatever feels

893
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,600
good

894
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:24,320
but i like having some kind of glucose

895
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,720
present

896
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,320
with supplements for myself when i take

897
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,520
them so when i take supplements and this

898
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,640
is for everybody here

899
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:35,279
too i'll take my supplements with like

900
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,200
uh my shot glass of wild blueberry juice

901
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:38,799
i'll take my supplements with because

902
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,080
there's a glucose in there

903
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:42,640
i'll take my supplements with some

904
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,200
coconut water i'll take my supplements

905
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,720
i'll have an

906
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,559
apple after i've had my supplements i'll

907
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,080
have the medical medium smoothie of

908
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:49,600
course the smoothies that i do all the

909
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:52,320
time for myself

910
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,960
lemon water with honey in it is a great

911
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,559
one too

912
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,399
like that's a great one but i like

913
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:58,000
having a little glucose a really good

914
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:59,440
question but you can you can do it you

915
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,279
can do it without food and you can do it

916
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,440
with food i like having a little bit of

917
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:06,399
glucose that's what i like

918
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:08,799
definitely if you're sensitive food is

919
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:10,480
actually always a great way to go

920
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:12,640
so as i was saying like a great place to

921
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,000
start is some of the basic supplements

922
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,720
that are really important

923
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,159
and i've seen in so many situations

924
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,320
people dealing with symptoms

925
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:21,600
where they just use a handful of medical

926
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,559
medium tools

927
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,360
and they'll use the troublemaker foods

928
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:27,360
they'll get out

929
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,919
they're like okay aw i got rid of the

930
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:32,240
milk cheese the butter the pork i went a

931
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:34,240
little further i got rid of the corn

932
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,600
i got rid of the you know of that right

933
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,120
there so they move that out

934
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,960
i got rid of the gluten so they move

935
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,480
that out of the way and then

really critical to know that's why i

1123
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,520

people go backwards and they go

1155
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:58,160
backwards and they go backwards because

1156
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,599
they're losing their immune system as

1157
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,880
all that blood's being taken and they

1158
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:02,400

00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:09,280
i'll just give you the quick rundown i

1163
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:12,560
talk about the only need

1164
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:15,359
i only need that much

1165
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,000
for like a gamma of tests i mean that

1166
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:18,720
much

1167
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,920
they only need that much like boom you

1168
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,280
wouldn't believe

1169
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,119
how much they can get out of there but

1170
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,640
they take all of our bond they they

1171
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:26,880
basically do over time

1172
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,079
and they just chalk it up to like you

1173
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,079
just create your

1174
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:31,280

system problem can feel impossible and

1219
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,560
this really helps clear that

1220
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,720
field that playing field so you can

1221
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,800

00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,560
undiagnosed gut problems if you're in

1223
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,839
that like

1224
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,280
what's going to happen here's the gut

1225
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:08,319
health world the gut health world is

1226
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,960
going to be like

1227
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:12,240
all-encompassing right every single

1228
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,160
functional medicine doctor

1229
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:16,079
every single doctor you guys go to every

1230
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,440
single doctor everybody goes to it's all

1231
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:18,560
going to be about gut health take these

1232
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,480
probiotics

1233
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,839
let's do some stool samples let's look

1234
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,520
for parasites let's

1235
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:25,280
look for this let's look for that so

1236
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:27,200
it's all going to be about gut health

1237
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:30,000
from here on out right

1238
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,960
but it doesn't mean that's the answer or

1239
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,520
it doesn't mean

1240
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,079
the remedies are going to be the answers

1241
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,760
because

1242
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:37,680
they've been focused on gut health

1243
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,280
anyway alternative medicine's been

1244
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:41,599
focused on gut health going back now

1245
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:44,480
decades with the whole candida

1246
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:46,079
farce so we're kind of still stuck in

1247
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,520
that gut health world which is gut

1248
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:48,000
health gut health gut health and that's

1249
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,800
the problem

1250
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,240
and it's got health um and so yeah and

1251
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:55,040
guess what our guts become

1252
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:56,000
a mess absolutely a hundred percent and

1253
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,680
there's no doubt

1254
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,960
we get bacteria in our gut we get

1255
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,640
inflammation in our gut because of

1256
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,000
bacteria and viruses in our gut we get

1257
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,520
all kinds of problems in our gut medical

1258
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,240
medium information's always been about

1259
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,640
that right

1260
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,760
but how do we really fix it so you're

1261
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:10,880
not doing harsh

1262
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:13,920
gut cleansers and gut tonics

1263
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:16,560
and gut powders and

1264
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:18,240
probiotic you know probiotics and

1265
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,160
everything else and not still

1266
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,920
moving forward to where you need to go

1267
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:24,160
like how do we address that

1268
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:26,000
so the mono eating cleanse is a great

1269
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:28,720
way to do it for gastroparesis

1270
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,520
undiagnosed gut problems even diagnose

1271
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:35,200
gut problems crohn's colitis

1272
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:36,000
um elevated histamines in people's

1273
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,800
systems

1274
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,920
food sensitivities food allergies all of

1275
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:43,040
that ibs

1276
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:46,240
right celiac and and

1277
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:50,160
digest the bloating pain gastritis

1278
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:53,839
okay yep yep that one so all of them

1279
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:55,760
and this is a way a technique to work on

1280
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:57,280
how to heal and it talks about how to do

1281
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:00,160
that and i'll give you a quick run down

1282
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:01,680
like when it comes down to bananas right

1283
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,640
one thing you'll be told in alternate

1284
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:05,520
medicine

1285
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,960
is you know stay away from bananas too

1286
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:09,680
much sugar and that's an

1287
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,000
epic disaster because i've seen bananas

1288
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:13,119
take

1289
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,119
people from the worst conditions

00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:30,000
someone to the finish line of their

1298
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,760
healing

1299
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,359
where and i talk about that in the mono

1300
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:35,280
eating section of the book

1301
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:36,720
and in the moderating section the book

about mono eating and how helpful that

1377
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,960

1378
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:28,000

00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:31,280
like really

1380

powerful information here um

1381
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:35,359
and this is why it's important about the

1382
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:38,079
details

1383
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:38,800
everybody's they're just lost out there

1384
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:41,119
they'll

1385
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,640
be doing something that's partially good

1386
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:44,079
for them but then they'll be

1387
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:46,160
mixing it up with something that's bad

1388
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:47,520
for them they'll talk about getting

1389
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:49,440
metals out of them

1390
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:51,200
but they'll be using corella to get the

1391
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,760
metals out which doesn't get the metals

1392
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,520
out

1393
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:55,599
they'll try to get their gut health

1394
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,319
better and then they'll get rid of

1395
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:58,240
gluten

1396
00:46:56,319 --> 00:47:00,000
but they'll be using apple cider vinegar

1397
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:01,599
which destroys your gut

1398
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,359
see see where it goes this is just

1399
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:07,119
little examples okay

1400
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:10,800
right and fixing things takes

1401
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:12,640
the details all the details matter

1402
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,720
it all matters so it's all about the

1403
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:16,720
details so important to know and

1404
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:18,560
what a lot of people do is they'll get

1405
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:21,200
stuck with something

1406
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:22,880
that's going around and they won't know

1407
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,319
that it's not a good thing so they'll

1408
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,920
have the natural flavors they'll have

1409
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:27,520
the msg they'll be doing chocolate

1410
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,119
they'll be doing their nutritional yeast

1411
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:31,359
they'll be doing too many things

1412
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:32,880
and they add up and when they add up it

1413
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:33,839
stops you from healing so the good

1414
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:36,319
things you're doing

1415
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:36,880
are battling the bad things you're doing

1416
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:39,280
see

1417
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,920
so it's like good versus bad good versus

1418
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:42,559
evil it's

1419
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:44,400
constantly good versus evil in the diet

1420
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:45,440
good versus evil even in the supplement

1421
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,200
world right

1422
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:48,640
and that's what everybody gets up

1423
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,319
against and it makes it even harder and

1424
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:52,720
harder to work with as far as for your

1425
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:54,079
healing let's talk about the recipe

1426
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,680

1440
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:25,839
so i'm going to get a little bit more in

1441
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:25,839
here

1442
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:36,160
move this aside for a second

1443
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,920
a little bit more right we got that

1444
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:41,040

1445
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:43,680
a little bit of cilantro in this salad

1446
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:45,119
you guys don't mind look i'm using this

1447
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:48,160
as a leafy green

1448
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:49,680
i'm not using that much right and

1449
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,960
putting it on top of a piece of fish

1450
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:54,319
actually what people do

1451
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:56,480
with fish is they'll put this much

1452
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:58,559
that's your cilantro cilantro in a

1453
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:00,640
guacamole people use that much

1454
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:02,559
cilantro and guacamole right they use

1455
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:04,400
that much that's all they'll use

1456
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:05,680
look at that right or on a piece of fish

1457
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,119
they'll chop up that much if you're

1458
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:08,079
lucky and put it on top of a piece of

1459
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:10,319
salmon right

1460
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:11,119
we're using a leafy green medical medium

1461
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:12,640
tulle

1462
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:15,359
and i don't care what anybody says you

1463
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:17,520
guys no one used

1464
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:18,880
leafy greens until they learn the

1465
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:20,160
medical medium information out there and

1466
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:22,160
if you learned about leafy greens

1467
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:24,319
through some other source it came it was

1468
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,760
osmosis through another source that

1469
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:27,520
learned it from medical medium

1470
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:30,720
35 years of teaching people about leafy

1471
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:34,240
greens people just used iceberg lettuce

1472
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:36,720
in the health realm vegan realm

1473
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:38,960
iceberg lettuce vegan realm it was

1474
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:40,240
iceberg lettuce

1475
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:43,520
yeah that was it you know the vegan

1476
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:45,359
realm was it was gluten bread

1477
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:46,720
it was bread with gluten in it and

1478
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:48,240
iceberg lettuce

1479
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:50,160
i mean that's what it was and then when

1480
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,800
someone got sick it was some wheatgrass

1481
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,880
juice

1482
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:55,040
that was it i mean it was literally just

1483
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:56,319
down to that little batch of things the

1484
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:58,079

1509
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:50,480
it because i'm a genius or something

1510
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:51,760

00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,280
about the blood draw problem

1512
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:55,440
that's knocking people back left and

1513
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:57,280
right how come i'm the only one when the

1514
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,880
plague just came out recently

1515
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:01,359
to talk about the after effects before

1516
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:04,559
anybody uttered a word about it like

1517
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:07,359
how come i'm the only one that said

1518
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:08,720
no you use the lemon water to flush your

1519
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:10,880
liver

1520
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:12,160
flush your liver it's not because i'm a

1521
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:14,559
genius that's

1522
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:15,760
spirit of compassion right but either

1523
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:18,960
way

1524
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:21,280
you know all these tools right but

1525
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:23,839
and then they get out there and they get

1526
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,839
passed around

1527
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:30,160
and people just forget you know it's

1528
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:33,440
like oh

1529
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:35,119
i mean there's premier medical clinics

1530
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:36,240
using medical medium information right

1531
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:37,839
now

1532
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:39,440
no science behind it it's just coming

1533
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:42,960
from medical media

1534
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:45,119
elizabeth hey truth i see so many people

1535
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:46,960
now using a bunch of cilantro in their

1536
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:48,800
smoothies yeah but they're not saying

1537
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:50,880
medical medium right liz

1538
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:53,359
they're not saying medical medium but it

1539
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:55,839
comes from medical medium information

1540
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:57,440
it only only comes from medical medium

1541
00:51:55,839 --> 00:51:59,280
information

1542
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:01,119
but then it gets it gets passed around

1543
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:03,200
right and here's the thing

1544
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:04,880
when medical medium tools get out there

1545
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:07,040
people use them and it's protecting them

1546
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:08,640
against all the bad stuff they're doing

1547
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,599
so there's there's this thing happening

1548
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,280
where they're getting some of the

1549
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:13,200
medical medium tools whatever they are

1550
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:15,119
and then they're they're battling the

1551
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,760
bad stuff they're doing that's out there

1552
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:18,000
right

1553
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:19,200
and you know this is how it works okay

1554
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,880
so let's go in just a little bit of

1555
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:23,040

1625
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:13,200
you'll see in the book and

1626
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:15,359
um two tablespoons of lemon juice let me

1627
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:17,680
get my strainer over here

1628
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:19,359
my strainer's got a little bit of celery

1629
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:21,839
pulp in there

1630
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:21,839
there we go

1631
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:26,960
let's get some lemon going

1632
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,760
there you go

1633
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:36,559
one and a half i mean sorry two

1634
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:39,839
tablespoons of lemon juice can go in

1635
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:39,839
here but you can do a lot less

1636
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,280
you can do a lot less you can do

1637
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:44,559
everybody's different they'll be like

1638
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,839
hey i only feel like using a half a

1639
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:47,119
lemon right now only feeling

1640
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:49,359
i feel like using a whole lemon i'm

1641
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:52,240
using a whole lemon so i'm getting up to

1642
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:54,079
that tablespoon easy

1643
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:55,680
see more than that that was actually a

1644
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:57,440
real juicy lemon

1645
00:55:55,680 --> 00:56:02,480
okay so here's what you're getting out

1646
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:05,040
of this

1647
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:05,680
so you're getting glucose from your

1648
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,359
apples

1649
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:09,119
but you're getting a blend of the

1650
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:10,480
glucose from your apples

1651
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:12,160
and then you're getting the mineral

1652
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:13,520
salts from your leafy greens

1653
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:16,480
so you got your cilantro you got your

1654
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:18,960
parsley okay you got your your

1655
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:21,200
lettuce okay and when you get your

1656
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:24,000
electrolytes and mineral salts

1657
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:24,400
and your glucose combined all at once

1658
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,680
all right

1659
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:28,240
because you got your raisins in there

1660
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:31,920
too for that glucose

1661
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:32,880
this is the basically what this is is

1662
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:34,799
like one of those

1663
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:37,280
healing tools for the brain because it's

1664
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:40,319
glucose mineral salts electrolytes

1665
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:41,920
and you do this on a regular basis

1666
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:44,079
