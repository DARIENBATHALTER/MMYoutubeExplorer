[22.96 - 26.88] meeting morning cleanse challenge we're
[24.56 - 28.56] doing it okay i'm excited you guys this
[26.88 - 30.32] is really great and i'll tell you why
[28.56 - 32.72] it's great because everything everything
[30.32 - 35.04] you do for your body
[32.72 - 36.56] it pays off and it pays off in an
[35.04 - 38.48] incredible way you know everybody's
[36.56 - 40.72] worried about maxing out the credit card
[38.48 - 42.16] i get it you run your credit card you
[40.72 - 43.76] push your credit card you run your
[42.16 - 45.12] credit card go into the gas pump you're
[43.76 - 47.60] sticking your credit card in there well
[45.12 - 50.48] your pancreas is your credit card your
[47.60 - 52.40] adrenals are your credit card your liver
[50.48 - 54.96] is your credit card right
[52.40 - 57.04] you can burn those babies out and
[54.96 - 59.84] eventually that liver
[57.04 - 62.80] that spleen that pancreas right just
[59.84 - 65.20] says okay i'm done i'm done you maxed me
[62.80 - 66.88] out you maxed me out and that's it i'm
[65.20 - 69.20] done and that's what happens all the
[66.88 - 72.24] time so you have to understand that
[69.20 - 74.72] so what we need to do is we need to now
[72.24 - 76.88] figure out a way of getting savings into
[74.72 - 79.28] your liver savings into your pancreas
[76.88 - 81.68] savings into your kidney savings into
[79.28 - 82.88] your adrenals this is how you do it
[81.68 - 85.20] right here
[82.88 - 87.76] because no matter what you do and how
[85.20 - 90.48] you go through life no matter if you get
[87.76 - 92.56] times of trouble and times are good and
[90.48 - 94.80] times are trouble and times are good and
[92.56 - 96.80] something happens here in the world you
[94.80 - 99.44] know is about to blow up
[96.80 - 100.40] volcanoes about to explode something's
[99.44 - 102.80] gonna happen

[102.80 - 107.44] healthy your organs have to be strong
[105.60 - 109.12] that's the key right there so no matter
[107.44 - 110.96] what happens in the world no matter how
[109.12 - 112.80] bad the world gets if it's screwed up
[110.96 - 115.52] right now and it's just like okay the
[112.80 - 117.20] world's all screwed up right now
[115.52 - 118.88] are the all the angels come in here
[117.20 - 120.48] because it's like was this the ending
[118.88 - 122.40] times right now or what is this the
[120.48 - 124.72] ending times no no it's not the ending

[343.04 - 346.96] tick tock 11 telegram you guys rumble
[345.20 - 348.64] facebook youtube
[346.96 - 351.12] so check this out okay
[348.64 - 352.88] eggs are radical fat
[351.12 - 354.72] they're high in fat people don't realize
[352.88 - 356.24] that but they're high in fat
[354.72 - 358.80] why do you think there was this fear
[356.24 - 360.56] about eggs years ago where doctors
[358.80 - 362.16] actually had it right
[360.56 - 364.00] where if you eat too many eggs you're
[362.16 - 365.52] basically going to have a heart stopping
[364.00 - 366.88] effect and you're just going to die of a
[365.52 - 368.32] heart disease or something like that
[366.88 - 369.44] well they're still right about well they
[368.32 - 371.04] don't believe that now because they
[369.44 - 372.88] don't know what they believe
[371.04 - 374.96] because you know propaganda just
[372.88 - 376.72] switches gears every la every minute but
[374.96 - 377.92] there was a one time where conventional
[376.72 - 379.36] doctors
[377.92 - 380.56] they were saying hey you got to worry
[379.36 - 383.20] about eggs well guess what you still got
[380.56 - 385.60] to worry about eggs that's a radical fat
[383.20 - 387.92] and then that sausage right there
[385.60 - 390.08] radical fat maybe you juice meatless
[387.92 - 392.08] sausage you guys do meatless sausage
[390.08 - 393.68] because those are filled with radical
[392.08 - 394.72] fat too
[393.68 - 396.48] yeah
[394.72 - 398.08] they are and then you got the bacon
[396.48 - 400.32] right you got the pork right there
[398.08 - 402.72] that's a radical fat
[400.32 - 404.64] and then you got that lump of butter
[402.72 - 406.16] right there
[404.64 - 408.32] till this day
[406.16 - 410.48] anybody that thinks butter in their
[408.32 - 412.40] coffee is a good thing
[410.48 - 413.68] they're just misled
[412.40 - 415.84] and
[413.68 - 418.16] whoever propelled that butter in your
[415.84 - 420.32] coffee thing out there in the world is a
[418.16 - 422.72] complete and an idiot and has led
[420.32 - 424.96] people astray in a bad way
[422.72 - 426.16] a real idiot that did the butter in the
[424.96 - 427.20] coffee thing
[426.16 - 429.84] that guy
[427.20 - 431.44] i think his name is
[429.84 - 432.72] i think his name i can't remember his
[431.44 - 436.00] name
[432.72 - 438.56] anyway the point is is all that does is
[436.00 - 441.92] lead people to heart surgeries artery
[438.56 - 444.48] surgeries like with vein surgeries
[441.92 - 446.08] getting getting valves replaced so you
[444.48 - 447.68] got to be careful that's a radical fat
[446.08 - 449.20] right there so then you've got your
[447.68 - 451.52] pancakes
[449.20 - 452.72] there could be oil in that batter or
[451.52 - 455.92] there could be other things in that
[452.72 - 458.40] batter too so this is just a radical
[455.92 - 463.12] fat meal right here so i'm just letting

[563.04 - 567.04] cleansing when you eat them before noon
[565.12 - 568.80] when you eat a radical fat before noon
[567.04 - 570.48] your body does not cleanse that's it no
[568.80 - 571.60] cleansing cleansing doesn't happen
[570.48 - 574.08] whatsoever
[571.60 - 576.08] what's another healthy fat peanut butter
[574.08 - 577.92] is a healthy fat i've always said that
[576.08 - 579.20] i've said that since i was like six
[577.92 - 580.88] years old
[579.20 - 583.68] that it's a healthy fat
[580.88 - 584.96] six years old it's a healthy fat it is
[583.68 - 586.56] spirit of compassion was saying yeah
[584.96 - 588.96] that's a healthy fat
[586.56 - 590.88] it is and guess what when i was six year
[588.96 - 592.88] old six years old peanut butter wasn't
[590.88 - 594.96] considered a healthy fat it was
[592.88 - 597.28] considered a terrible
[594.96 - 598.56] horrible fat that can kill your heart
[597.28 - 601.52] did you know that
[598.56 - 603.12] mainstream medicine believed peanut
[601.52 - 605.44] butter
[603.12 - 606.24] would kill you
[605.44 - 608.48] back
[606.24 - 610.96] when i was six years old
[608.48 - 613.28] and at six years old spirit of
[610.96 - 615.28] compassion would say no tell people it's
[613.28 - 617.92] healthy but it's a healthy fat but you
[615.28 - 619.60] don't want the healthy fats before noon
[617.92 - 620.96] is what i'm trying to say
[619.60 - 622.48] you don't want to do that here's a
[620.96 - 623.92] healthy fat right now
[622.48 - 625.92] in my hand
[623.92 - 629.12] avocados
[625.92 - 630.72] avocado toast save it till noon and
[629.12 - 632.56] after if that's what you're going to eat
[630.72 - 634.00] is a healthy fat
[632.56 - 635.60] okay that's important power of
[634.00 - 637.84] compassion said i used to eat high-fat
[635.60 - 640.32] breakfast it totally destroyed me
[637.84 - 642.16] the high-fat breakfast
[640.32 - 644.08] definitely does some damage to people
[642.16 - 646.40] especially if they got autoimmune eczema
[644.08 - 648.16] psoriasis especially if they have lupus
[646.40 - 650.80] multiple sclerosis any kind of condition
[648.16 - 654.40] whatsoever including acne anything
[650.80 - 655.68] vitiligo it's dermatitis
[654.40 - 658.56] so
[655.68 - 662.00] what you get when you keep on having
[658.56 - 665.36] radical fats in the morning
[662.00 - 667.04] what you get is dirty blood thick dirty
[665.36 - 668.48] blood that's a healthy fat right there
[667.04 - 670.72] got some almonds right there i got some
[668.48 - 671.84] cashews right there that's healthy fat
[670.72 - 674.56] too
[671.84 - 680.00] but you get thick dirty blood and your
[674.56 - 680.00] liver stops cleansing is what happens
[680.56 - 684.00] when our liver stop cleansing
[683.12 - 686.56] right
[684.00 - 688.56] we build up toxins over time more and
[686.56 - 691.52] more toxins build up and more and more
[688.56 - 693.12] toxins build up and then one day
[691.52 - 694.24] you're going along
[693.12 - 696.08] and now
[694.24 - 698.96] you wake up one morning
[696.08 - 701.12] and it's time to call the doctor
[698.96 - 703.52] and now you're a new patient

[740.96 - 745.12] get sick as time goes on rob said the
[743.20 - 746.24] keto diet wrecked me
[745.12 - 748.64] rob
[746.24 - 751.04] the keto diet
[748.64 - 753.20] killed the people years ago
[751.04 - 755.28] they changed the keto diet now where it
[753.20 - 757.60] still will wreck people the keto diet
[755.28 - 760.32] will still wreck people
[757.60 - 762.32] but they brought in fruits
[760.32 - 764.72] they brought in vegetables
[762.32 - 767.44] they brought in a few greens
[764.72 - 768.40] they brought these things in right
[767.44 - 770.80] and so
[768.40 - 773.52] and and but the keto diet when you're
[770.80 - 775.36] sick will still wreck and destroy but
[773.52 - 777.04] people don't know that sure if you've
[775.36 - 779.12] never been sick before and you go on a
[777.04 - 781.68] keto diet a new keto diet of the day
[779.12 - 784.16] which allows a green juice it allows
[781.68 - 786.16] sugar it allows avocado right you go on
[784.16 - 788.24] a new type of keto diet of the day right
[786.16 - 790.40] now which isn't a keto diet but you go
[788.24 - 791.68] on to the new keto diets you might get
[790.40 - 792.80] some results you might get a little
[791.68 - 794.24] weight loss because you got off of
[792.80 - 796.88] processed foods but if you're really

[1090.00 - 1094.72] tip you guys very important
[1092.24 - 1097.04] if the lime is green you can still use
[1094.72 - 1098.24] it but it's not ripe but you can still
[1097.04 - 1101.04] use it
[1098.24 - 1104.16] you want the limes that have some color
[1101.04 - 1105.12] to them the color changed so that's a
[1104.16 - 1107.84] lime
[1105.12 - 1110.72] you know tip right there okay
[1107.84 - 1113.20] when you let the lime ripen or you find
[1110.72 - 1115.04] that lime that's more ripe you'll get
[1113.20 - 1116.56] more juice out of it so i'm going to
[1115.04 - 1118.08] squeeze a little lime in here i know i
[1116.56 - 1119.04] mixed it and if you want to mix it you
[1118.08 - 1120.40] could too

[1120.40 - 1126.48] little bit of lime in there as well
[1123.60 - 1129.20] so the first thing is 16 to 32 ounces of
[1126.48 - 1130.80] lemon water or lime water first thing in
[1129.20 - 1133.44] the morning
[1130.80 - 1136.32] and you start out your day you start

[1138.48 - 1140.88] there it is
[1140.08 - 1144.48] so
[1140.88 - 1147.20] what you can do is you can pay the bank
[1144.48 - 1150.80] by flushing that liver out you're
[1147.20 - 1152.72] building your liver reserves back up
[1150.80 - 1154.72] right there that's what you're doing
[1152.72 - 1156.88] you're building it back up

[1205.52 - 1210.40] do the lemon water 16 to 32 ounces to
[1208.00 - 1212.88] flush out your liver before you shut
[1210.40 - 1214.40] your liver down with caffeine and
[1212.88 - 1216.32] adrenaline

[1218.48 - 1221.68] you know you can take the caffeine out
[1220.16 - 1224.32] in the morning that's a troublemaker you
[1221.68 - 1226.08] can take out which is really great
[1224.32 - 1227.60] but keep that in mind
[1226.08 - 1230.40] flush the liver
[1227.60 - 1232.40] before you poison it
[1230.40 - 1233.84] really important and i talk about that
[1232.40 - 1236.64] in the medical medium cleanse the heel
[1233.84 - 1238.16] book so i mean look i can't stop anybody
[1236.64 - 1240.16] from drinking their caffeine and this
[1238.16 - 1241.04] isn't an anti-caffeine
[1240.16 - 1242.48] you know
[1241.04 - 1245.20] talk today
[1242.48 - 1246.96] but i'm saying the details are in here
[1245.20 - 1249.68] if you are going to drink the coffee
[1246.96 - 1252.24] which people do every single day
[1249.68 - 1255.52] then do that coffee
[1252.24 - 1257.84] after you've flushed out that liver
[1255.52 - 1260.88] important tory sue says could i juice my
[1257.84 - 1262.80] lemons and freeze the juice in ice trays
[1260.88 - 1265.36] so as to store them up if you have to
[1262.80 - 1268.80] absolutely then put a cube in a glass to
[1265.36 - 1270.40] dissolve it in the am uh yes you can
[1268.80 - 1272.72] is it ideal
[1270.40 - 1275.92] no but it's still doable that's doable
[1272.72 - 1277.68] that's better than putting that lemon in
[1275.92 - 1279.04] the hot water so i want to answer more
[1277.68 - 1280.96] questions to you guys i want to be
[1279.04 - 1282.56] really helpful i want to tell you how to
[1280.96 - 1284.96] do this cleanse
[1282.56 - 1287.28] this free cleanse
[1284.96 - 1288.88] free okay
[1287.28 - 1291.44] john morris hey
[1288.88 - 1293.44] i don't think coffee is bad as long as
[1291.44 - 1295.76] you don't add a lot of sweetener but i
[1293.44 - 1297.28] agree you should flush the liver first
[1295.76 - 1299.36] because the first thing you consume is
[1297.28 - 1300.80] what your body takes in the most of well
[1299.36 - 1302.96] first of all thanks for agreeing with
[1300.80 - 1305.20] that flushing the liver first is great
[1302.96 - 1307.36] i'm glad you don't think coffee is not
[1305.20 - 1309.04] bad you know that's that's that's fine
[1307.36 - 1311.12] i'm glad the caffeine companies taught
[1309.04 - 1312.72] you that and i'm glad the caffeine
[1311.12 - 1314.88] propaganda and the caffeine industry
[1312.72 - 1317.12] taught you that too the coffee's not bad
[1314.88 - 1318.40] and but i'm just going to tell you right
[1317.12 - 1321.84] now
[1318.40 - 1324.00] okay sure john john morris right i
[1321.84 - 1326.80] respect what you say of course right
[1324.00 - 1328.56] you're a guy but women's health suffers
[1326.80 - 1330.40] from caffeine
[1328.56 - 1331.44] women's health suffers greatly from
[1330.40 - 1333.12] caffeine
[1331.44 - 1334.64] i'm just going to let you know right now
[1333.12 - 1336.40] women have to
[1334.64 - 1339.20] birth children
[1336.40 - 1340.88] and it takes adrenal strength to do that
[1339.20 - 1343.36] a difficult birth
[1340.88 - 1344.56] can happen for women because they toast
[1343.36 - 1346.16] out their adrenals from all that
[1344.56 - 1347.68] caffeine
[1346.16 - 1348.96] so that's one thing important another
[1347.68 - 1350.32] thing too
[1348.96 - 1352.56] women are being thrown on these
[1350.32 - 1354.72] intermittent fasting diets
[1352.56 - 1356.96] and they run on caffeine and adrenaline
[1354.72 - 1358.96] all day and eventually by the time
[1356.96 - 1361.04] they're 40 they're burnt out they're
[1358.96 - 1362.96] fried they can't think they got brain
[1361.04 - 1365.60] frog
[1362.96 - 1366.64] their adrenals are totally toasted
[1365.60 - 1368.48] and
[1366.64 - 1370.00] and what happens is they've also gone
[1368.48 - 1371.60] through maybe one or two really
[1370.00 - 1373.60] difficult births
[1371.60 - 1376.72] and maybe you've even had c-sections
[1373.60 - 1378.16] because of it the adrenals get burnt and
[1376.72 - 1381.12] fried out
[1378.16 - 1384.40] pain tolerance goes you know down really
[1381.12 - 1385.92] fast and caffeine causes a lot of this
[1384.40 - 1388.16] another thing that happens with women
[1385.92 - 1390.16] too is your skin gets all choppy they
[1388.16 - 1392.56] get all the they get all of the brown
[1390.16 - 1395.12] spots all over their face that happens
[1392.56 - 1396.08] all over their skin that's from caffeine
[1395.12 - 1399.12] so
[1396.08 - 1400.16] john i get it you think caffeine's fine
[1399.12 - 1404.16] and
[1400.16 - 1405.68] as a guy sure can drink the caffeine but
[1404.16 - 1407.52] for women's health it's actually
[1405.68 - 1409.52] terrible the caffeine industry knows
[1407.52 - 1412.40] this behind the scenes
[1409.52 - 1414.56] and their mantra is get pregnant women
[1412.40 - 1417.12] on caffeine
[1414.56 - 1418.88] so that their babies will be caffeine
[1417.12 - 1421.28] addicts when they're born
[1418.88 - 1422.48] and get pregnant women on caffeine so
[1421.28 - 1424.88] their breast milk is filled with
[1422.48 - 1427.28] caffeine so their babies are caffeine
[1424.88 - 1429.68] addicts when they're breastfeeding and
[1427.28 - 1432.40] this what this does is it ensures the
[1429.68 - 1434.16] caffeine industry banks and banks and
[1432.40 - 1436.48] banks and banks
[1434.16 - 1437.36] and never stops banking
[1436.48 - 1439.52] all right

[1528.80 - 1532.72] we're doing the medical medium cleanse
[1530.16 - 1535.92] challenge let's get into it so after
[1532.72 - 1538.48] your celery juice 16 to 32 ounces
[1535.92 - 1540.72] okay we move into
[1538.48 - 1543.28] our the lemon water we move into the
[1540.72 - 1545.20] celery juice next so that's the next
[1543.28 - 1547.52] phase of it so we run some celery
[1545.20 - 1548.40] through here's what we do okay
[1547.52 - 1551.12] so
[1548.40 - 1553.84] if you guys don't have a juicer use a
[1551.12 - 1556.24] blender that's okay if you don't have a
[1553.84 - 1557.28] juicer use a blender and that's what you
[1556.24 - 1559.60] do
[1557.28 - 1562.00] there's ways of doing things that are
[1559.60 - 1564.40] different if you need to
[1562.00 - 1566.80] if you have an old blender take your
[1564.40 - 1569.68] celery chop it up throw it into the
[1566.80 - 1570.48] blender that's perfectly fine you can do
[1569.68 - 1571.11] it
[1570.48 - 1572.48] right
[1571.11 - 1574.96] [Music]
[1572.48 - 1576.72] so we're going to do
[1574.96 - 1577.84] is i'm going to run some celery through
[1576.72 - 1580.72] here
[1577.84 - 1582.40] now if you're somebody that's sensitive
[1580.72 - 1584.56] okay
[1582.40 - 1589.12] somebody that's sensitive
[1584.56 - 1591.44] you can do less four ounces two ounces
[1589.12 - 1593.68] if you're somebody that's sensitive do
[1591.44 - 1595.12] less celery juice
[1593.68 - 1597.20] all right
[1595.12 - 1599.04] and that's perfectly fine if you're
[1597.20 - 1601.60] somebody that's sensitive in this
[1599.04 - 1604.72] situation where your blood is thick and
[1601.60 - 1608.00] dirty you've never cleansed before
[1604.72 - 1610.16] you're eating radical fats all the time
[1608.00 - 1612.56] you're highly toxic
[1610.16 - 1614.88] you've got pathogens but don't even know
[1612.56 - 1617.36] it you got streptococcus in your
[1614.88 - 1618.64] intestinal tract you don't even know it
[1617.36 - 1621.12] right
[1618.64 - 1624.16] and you got symptoms conditions you have
[1621.12 - 1627.28] no idea what they're from
[1624.16 - 1628.96] they're from pathogens and toxins
[1627.28 - 1630.88] so if you're somebody that's highly
[1628.96 - 1633.12] toxic and you're doing the medical
[1630.88 - 1636.72] medium morning cleanse you don't have to
[1633.12 - 1638.64] do 16 to 32 ounces of celery juice you
[1636.72 - 1640.64] can start out with four ounces you can
[1638.64 - 1643.36] start out with eight ounces
[1640.64 - 1646.24] keep in mind you haven't had radical
[1643.36 - 1649.92] fats yet kathleen has a question can you
[1646.24 - 1651.52] use powdered celery juice no you cannot
[1649.92 - 1653.52] i can't tell you what to do you have
[1651.52 - 1655.52] your own free well you can do whatever
[1653.52 - 1657.92] you want right of course
[1655.52 - 1660.64] my recommendation is don't do it it
[1657.92 - 1663.36] won't fix you it doesn't have the
[1660.64 - 1666.16] ability to fix anybody it doesn't have
[1663.36 - 1669.04] that healing ability it's dehydrated
[1666.16 - 1671.76] it's lost what it needs to help heal
[1669.04 - 1673.84] someone and clean somebody up keep that
[1671.76 - 1675.12] in mind if you guys just came on here
[1673.84 - 1677.36] we're doing the medical medium morning
[1675.12 - 1679.84] cleanse challenge we're heading into the
[1677.36 - 1682.64] section of juicing celery you can do
[1679.84 - 1685.04] four ounces six ounces 8 ounces whatever
[1682.64 - 1687.76] you would like you don't have to do 16
[1685.04 - 1690.00] to 32 ounces i prefer 32 ounces that
[1687.76 - 1690.88] would be fantastic
[1690.00 - 1691.92] okay
[1690.88 - 1694.48] so
[1691.92 - 1696.24] the reason why some people get benefits
[1694.48 - 1697.84] from intermittent fasting is because
[1696.24 - 1699.76] they remove fats in the morning but they
[1697.84 - 1702.80] don't know that's why
[1699.76 - 1706.08] they actually don't know why
[1702.80 - 1709.68] they're getting some type of result
[1706.08 - 1712.64] it's because they're moving fats out of
[1709.68 - 1714.16] their morning regime they're keeping the
[1712.64 - 1716.16] fats out
[1714.16 - 1719.04] and that's why
[1716.16 - 1720.80] okay so it's important to know
[1719.04 - 1723.76] but the problem with intermittent
[1720.80 - 1724.64] fasting is you will burn your adrenals
[1723.76 - 1727.28] out
[1724.64 - 1730.48] with intermittent fasting because you
[1727.28 - 1734.48] have to get trace mineral salts and you
[1730.48 - 1736.56] have to get sugar in your bloodstream
[1734.48 - 1739.12] if anybody's anti-sugar like
[1736.56 - 1741.68] anti-glucose
[1739.12 - 1744.00] then you're they're illey misinformed
[1741.68 - 1746.16] because
[1744.00 - 1748.48] what happens is if you don't get glucose
[1746.16 - 1750.16] to your brain in the morning
[1748.48 - 1752.88] you're starving your brain of what it
[1750.16 - 1755.28] needs glucose is why we function
[1752.88 - 1757.92] so the critical aspect of intermittent
[1755.28 - 1760.56] fasting the critical aspect of it
[1757.92 - 1762.72] working to some degree is you keep fats
[1760.56 - 1763.76] out but you have to have something in
[1762.72 - 1766.64] there
[1763.76 - 1768.80] that actually feeds your brain
[1766.64 - 1770.88] to keep that in mind
[1768.80 - 1773.60] so when you remove
[1770.88 - 1776.16] sugar from your morning you don't need a
[1773.60 - 1779.44] piece of fruit you don't have lemon
[1776.16 - 1781.92] water okay when you remove sugar from
[1779.44 - 1782.72] your breakfast in the morning and you
[1781.92 - 1785.12] just
[1782.72 - 1787.60] intermittent fast you're you're now
[1785.12 - 1788.88] running on adrenaline and caffeine if
[1787.60 - 1791.52] you're somebody that's intermittent
[1788.88 - 1794.24] fasting on caffeine right these are ways
[1791.52 - 1796.88] that age you faster and they don't help
[1794.24 - 1798.56] you cleanse
[1796.88 - 1800.00] so right now we're making some celery
[1798.56 - 1801.28] juice
[1800.00 - 1803.84] if you're somebody that's doing the
[1801.28 - 1805.68] medical medium morning cleanse challenge
[1803.84 - 1807.20] and you had your celery juice already in
[1805.68 - 1808.64] the morning hang on we're still going to
[1807.20 - 1810.56] do some other stuff so this is going to
[1808.64 - 1813.12] be fun okay
[1810.56 - 1815.76] so right now i'm running some juice i'm
[1813.12 - 1817.92] already past 8 10 ounces easy i'm
[1815.76 - 1819.84] probably going into like 16 ounces easy
[1817.92 - 1823.20] i'm going to go a little bit more too so
[1819.84 - 1825.12] we'll run some more
[1823.20 - 1827.20] this is the omega for the people asking
[1825.12 - 1830.08] about the juicer right now the juicer
[1827.20 - 1831.20] sale ends i think tomorrow this is the
[1830.08 - 1832.24] omega
[1831.20 - 1835.60] mm
[1832.24 - 1837.92] 900 hds so one that saves money you see
[1835.60 - 1839.52] this right here this is coming out dry
[1837.92 - 1840.96] just so you know you guys
[1839.52 - 1842.64] i'm just showing you guys on tick tock
[1840.96 - 1843.52] can you see that right there on the
[1842.64 - 1846.08] screen
[1843.52 - 1848.16] so that's coming out dry right
[1846.08 - 1849.44] the reason why this pulp is dryer it's
[1848.16 - 1851.28] this machine
[1849.44 - 1853.36] and so you're saving money so you're
[1851.28 - 1855.12] you're getting a lot more juice right
[1853.36 - 1857.84] there just so you know
[1855.12 - 1859.68] i've endorsed this this this company and
[1857.84 - 1862.16] machine
[1859.68 - 1864.40] i've endorsed them because of what they
[1862.16 - 1867.36] what they offer with this because this
[1864.40 - 1868.72] is insane really is it just is
[1867.36 - 1870.56] so i'm going to run one more stick
[1868.72 - 1872.96] through here
[1870.56 - 1875.28] susie newton says
[1872.96 - 1877.20] can i do celery juice first then lemon
[1875.28 - 1880.32] water yes
[1877.20 - 1882.80] yes you can you can flip it
[1880.32 - 1884.72] go backwards
[1882.80 - 1886.48] go backwards in a good way
[1884.72 - 1888.32] i'm actually fine with that are you
[1886.48 - 1891.20] kidding if i can keep you off the fax
[1888.32 - 1893.12] until noon and you just want to switch
[1891.20 - 1895.68] you just want to switch that off like
[1893.12 - 1899.35] boom silvery juice and
[1895.68 - 1902.48] and lemon water definitely let's do it
[1899.35 - 1904.40] [Laughter]
[1902.48 - 1906.32] all right
[1904.40 - 1909.36] we got some celery juice going right now
[1906.32 - 1910.72] i'm excited about this okay
[1909.36 - 1912.88] so just letting you know before i put
[1910.72 - 1914.96] the machine away over here

[1920.08 - 1924.80] that saves people money
[1922.08 - 1924.80] is what it is
[1925.68 - 1930.48] which is incredible
[1928.40 - 1932.00] so you've got to strain your celery
[1930.48 - 1934.56] juice you guys on tick tock if you're
[1932.00 - 1936.72] ever going to do celery juice to get the
[1934.56 - 1939.20] maximum benefits out of this herbal
[1936.72 - 1940.88] extraction you have to strain it keep
[1939.20 - 1944.40] that in mind
[1940.88 - 1947.12] you want it pure liquid that's where the
[1944.40 - 1949.28] gold is at

[1949.28 - 1953.84] is at right there okay
[1952.56 - 1955.52] there you go
[1953.84 - 1957.68] somebody asked me on tick tock just now
[1955.52 - 1960.16] what do adrenals do
[1957.68 - 1962.16] what do they do
[1960.16 - 1963.84] if you're talking that's because of
[1962.16 - 1966.88] adrenaline
[1963.84 - 1967.92] if you're walking that's from adrenaline
[1966.88 - 1969.92] right
[1967.92 - 1971.28] anything you do did you take a shower
[1969.92 - 1973.44] this morning
[1971.28 - 1974.84] that's from your adrenals your adrenals
[1973.44 - 1977.28] gave you that
[1974.84 - 1978.80] blessing that's why people that they
[1977.28 - 1980.08] lose their adrenals they can't get up
[1978.80 - 1982.32] they can't shower
[1980.08 - 1985.04] okay
[1982.32 - 1987.44] adrenals do all of that for you right
[1985.04 - 1989.36] that's what they do okay they make it so
[1987.44 - 1991.52] you can exercise
[1989.36 - 1993.28] they make it so you can play
[1991.52 - 1994.64] they make it so you can partake in
[1993.28 - 1997.36] things that aren't good for you like
[1994.64 - 1999.04] alcohol and caffeine and all kinds of
[1997.36 - 2001.44] stuff which is terrible for you but your
[1999.04 - 2004.48] adrenals allow you to survive through
[2001.44 - 2007.20] all that and partake in anything okay so
[2004.48 - 2009.44] adrenals do everything for you we have
[2007.20 - 2011.04] to protect them we can't burn them out
[2009.44 - 2013.20] the medical medium warning funds

[2057.44 - 2060.72] talk look at that like just toss that
[2059.20 - 2063.12] out
[2060.72 - 2065.20] all right
[2063.12 - 2066.80] what happens is your adrenals are there
[2065.20 - 2068.56] for fight or flight they're there when
[2066.80 - 2069.68] you have a broken relationship they're
[2068.56 - 2071.28] there when

[2086.88 - 2090.80] member or a friend and it gets you
[2088.80 - 2092.88] jazzed up and now you're shaking like

[2460.64 - 2464.00] the banana is definitely helpful but
[2462.32 - 2465.92] we're going to put a lot of things in
[2464.00 - 2468.08] here that are really helpful this is
[2465.92 - 2470.40] what we're going to do
[2468.08 - 2473.28] we're going to put the magic
[2470.40 - 2475.84] ingredients in here that make the heavy
[2473.28 - 2477.84] metal detox movie that's the next part
[2475.84 - 2480.00] so let's go into it
[2477.84 - 2482.16] wild blueberries these are frozen wild
[2480.00 - 2483.92] blueberries right here
[2482.16 - 2486.48] wild blueberries

[2486.48 - 2491.04] smoothie right here okay
[2488.64 - 2493.52] two cups of frozen
[2491.04 - 2495.84] wild blueberries watch those babies go

[2508.00 - 2514.32] let's get one cup of cilantro in there
[2511.04 - 2516.88] critical to go in here now the reason
[2514.32 - 2518.32] why this works
[2516.88 - 2521.12] is because
[2518.32 - 2522.80] of the blend of what's going in here
[2521.12 - 2526.16] keep that in mind
[2522.80 - 2527.28] the blueberry doesn't remove toxic heavy
[2526.16 - 2530.32] metals
[2527.28 - 2531.28] but the wild blueberry does
[2530.32 - 2532.40] that's
[2531.28 - 2534.72] right there
[2532.40 - 2537.04] the secret ingredient one of them now
[2534.72 - 2538.96] we're gonna do the cilantro that's in
[2537.04 - 2540.08] there another ingredient
[2538.96 - 2542.56] incredible
[2540.08 - 2544.56] now we're gonna do two other secret
[2542.56 - 2548.16] ingredients right
[2544.56 - 2551.04] we're gonna do the spirulina okay
[2548.16 - 2553.36] that's the one i trust i'm not sponsored
[2551.04 - 2556.64] okay and i don't own the company
[2553.36 - 2558.80] but that's the spirulina okay so that's
[2556.64 - 2562.24] the vimergy visa and victor i m as in
[2558.80 - 2563.92] mary ergy dot com if you want to know
[2562.24 - 2565.84] about that one right there and that's
[2563.92 - 2568.32] the best one on the market
[2565.84 - 2570.16] when you use a high quality product like
[2568.32 - 2572.72] this it takes
[2570.16 - 2574.08] the removal of metals to an entirely
[2572.72 - 2575.60] different level and that's what i love
[2574.08 - 2579.36] about it so you put a teaspoon of that
[2575.60 - 2581.52] spirulina in there
[2579.36 - 2584.08] remember
[2581.52 - 2586.32] if you did your your lemon water
[2584.08 - 2587.92] you did your celery juice
[2586.32 - 2589.68] and now you're getting the heavy metal
[2587.92 - 2591.52] detox smoothie in you

[2591.52 - 2596.08] really cleansing and detoxing into what
[2593.52 - 2597.52] degree into what level
[2596.08 - 2599.12] it's it's actually incredible what's
[2597.52 - 2600.88] happening
[2599.12 - 2603.60] in your body
[2600.88 - 2604.72] you're getting rid of what needs to go

[2618.48 - 2624.80] keep that in mind people who don't like
[2620.88 - 2626.72] the taste of cilantro are high in metals
[2624.80 - 2628.80] they're high in metals

[2670.64 - 2675.36] you do the metal detox if you have metal
[2672.64 - 2677.20] in your mouth yes you can
[2675.36 - 2679.44] people do it all the time absolutely
[2677.20 - 2682.48] sets of energy dolls right there
[2679.44 - 2684.40] visa victor i am ergy dot com i'm not
[2682.48 - 2686.72] sponsored it's just incredible stuff we
[2684.40 - 2688.16] got the dolls in there so we're building
[2686.72 - 2690.16] these things up now i'm gonna put a
[2688.16 - 2691.84] little bit of wild blueberry juice now i
[2690.16 - 2692.72] do work with wyman's
[2691.84 - 2695.28] okay
[2692.72 - 2698.08] i do do work with them
[2695.28 - 2700.40] i endorse this product 100
[2698.08 - 2701.52] and i do work with them because what
[2700.40 - 2703.52] they do
[2701.52 - 2704.40] is they take the wild blueberry out of
[2703.52 - 2706.40] the field
[2704.40 - 2708.48] they harvest it out of the field right
[2706.40 - 2710.40] which is a process all on its own that's
[2708.48 - 2711.44] unbelievable because it's really hard to
[2710.40 - 2713.04] do
[2711.44 - 2714.56] and what they do is
[2713.04 - 2717.68] they press it
[2714.56 - 2720.40] okay so what this is right here is a
[2717.68 - 2722.64] wild blueberry juice
[2720.40 - 2724.72] okay that's pressed i never want this
[2722.64 - 2725.60] stuff to disappear in the world
[2724.72 - 2727.76] because
[2725.60 - 2729.52] it it's an unbelievable process to even
[2727.76 - 2732.00] make it happen and the antioxidant
[2729.52 - 2733.36] levels off the chart so what i do is i
[2732.00 - 2735.52] put a little bit of that too so i have
[2733.36 - 2737.36] not only have the the blueberries in
[2735.52 - 2738.96] there frozen wild blueberries in there
[2737.36 - 2740.56] but i put that in there too so that's
[2738.96 - 2742.76] something i do that's the wyman's right
[2740.56 - 2746.08] there okay

[2746.08 - 2752.00] what you see in here
[2748.64 - 2754.16] is the cilantro the wild blueberries

[3137.04 - 3142.16] it really is
[3138.88 - 3144.16] what you don't do is you don't put the
[3142.16 - 3146.80] butter in here

[3192.64 - 3196.16] some wild blueberries on your millet in
[3194.32 - 3197.52] the morning you can do that to your
[3196.16 - 3200.08] oatmeal too
[3197.52 - 3202.48] right look at this
[3200.08 - 3204.72] if you want to put more you can put more
[3202.48 - 3208.60] you want to put less you can be you just
[3204.72 - 3208.60] do you with this okay
[3208.88 - 3212.96] check this out
[3210.96 - 3214.32] ready now i'm going to put either one or
[3212.96 - 3216.96] two options you could do this i could
[3214.32 - 3218.00] put maple syrup on it i can put honey on
[3216.96 - 3220.24] this
[3218.00 - 3220.24] right
[3220.32 - 3224.16] we got maple syrup right here
[3224.80 - 3228.08] put a little maple syrup on here guess
[3227.20 - 3231.28] what
[3228.08 - 3233.60] you're still cleansing
[3231.28 - 3235.60] you're still cleansing
[3233.60 - 3239.28] i just put maple syrup on here you can
[3235.60 - 3242.00] put honey on here too if you want
[3239.28 - 3243.52] but i just put maple syrup on there
[3242.00 - 3244.72] wild blueberries they're frozen wild
[3243.52 - 3248.16] blueberries
[3244.72 - 3249.60] i have them on top of that hot steamy
[3248.16 - 3251.28] millet
[3249.60 - 3253.92] gluten free
[3251.28 - 3256.08] i put a little bit of maple syrup on top
[3253.92 - 3259.20] and that's allowed in the medical medium
[3256.08 - 3259.20] morning cleanse challenge
[3259.36 - 3265.20] fats are what stops you
[3262.16 - 3269.52] from cleansing in the morning keep that
[3265.20 - 3272.00] in mind fats also block
[3269.52 - 3273.52] the sugar from entering your cells and
[3272.00 - 3274.88] you get insulin resistance in the
[3273.52 - 3276.64] morning everybody gets insulin
[3274.88 - 3279.36] resistance in the morning
[3276.64 - 3280.80] because they're on so many fats
[3279.36 - 3282.72] and they end up getting sugar in them at
[3280.80 - 3284.64] the same time mixing it so let's get
[3282.72 - 3286.48] some oatmeal going so here we go we got
[3284.64 - 3288.80] the pan ready
[3286.48 - 3290.72] the pot ready right here let's get a
[3288.80 - 3294.32] little bit of oatmeal in here
[3290.72 - 3297.36] so this is exciting okay
[3294.32 - 3300.00] can you add oil free oat milk i wouldn't
[3297.36 - 3303.04] because i don't think it's fat free oat
[3300.00 - 3304.88] milk oat milk gets pretty high in fat so
[3303.04 - 3307.28] you're pushing it on that one it's so
[3304.88 - 3309.92] concentrated that oatmeal so that
[3307.28 - 3312.08] oatmeal gets pretty high in fat keep
[3309.92 - 3315.12] that in mind right so i'm gonna pop some
[3312.08 - 3316.32] oatmeal in here that oh milk
[3315.12 - 3317.84] does
[3316.32 - 3321.36] oatmeal doesn't
[3317.84 - 3324.16] oatmeal is not high in fat okay
[3321.36 - 3326.80] it's not high in fat it's not an overt
[3324.16 - 3329.52] fat but when you concentrate that oat
[3326.80 - 3332.80] milk it almost crosses it does it
[3329.52 - 3334.40] crosses the line kind of into overt fat
[3332.80 - 3336.72] world is what it does
[3334.40 - 3338.56] and then over fat is it the radical fat
[3336.72 - 3339.84] world right and that's going to stop you
[3338.56 - 3342.96] from doing what you need to do so let's
[3339.84 - 3342.96] get some water in here
[3344.40 - 3347.36] right
[3346.08 - 3350.88] and i'll put a little bit more water in
[3347.36 - 3350.88] there we're cooking this right now
[3351.12 - 3354.16] you guys if you just got on here this is
[3352.80 - 3356.40] the medical medium morning cleanse
[3354.16 - 3358.88] challenge
[3356.40 - 3358.88] there we go
[3360.16 - 3364.00] i got some oatmeal on right here if you
[3362.16 - 3365.92] guys want to see i don't know if you can
[3364.00 - 3367.28] see this right there see this on tick
[3365.92 - 3370.24] tock you get a better view or so you
[3367.28 - 3373.44] guys get a better view on telegram too
[3370.24 - 3377.84] why does oak meal hurt my stomach makes
[3373.44 - 3377.84] me bloated i get dizzy eating it too
[3378.40 - 3382.32] here's how it works oatmeal is not a
[3380.08 - 3383.04] healing food
[3382.32 - 3385.28] so
[3383.04 - 3386.24] stephanie doyle oatmeal is not a healing
[3385.28 - 3388.88] food
[3386.24 - 3390.96] but it's not a food that feeds viruses
[3388.88 - 3393.36] and pathogens but if you've got other
[3390.96 - 3395.36] stuff going on other sensitivities and
[3393.36 - 3397.68] other things going on it might not be
[3395.36 - 3400.00] the best option for you something else
[3397.68 - 3402.16] could be the best option for you see
[3400.00 - 3404.00] it whether it's millet becomes a better
[3402.16 - 3406.48] option whether it's steamed potatoes
[3404.00 - 3408.88] becomes a better option for you you see
[3406.48 - 3410.64] so steamed potatoes could actually be a
[3408.88 - 3412.88] good option right there for you keep
[3410.64 - 3416.40] that in mind it could be just bananas
[3412.88 - 3418.16] too also what do you put in your oatmeal
[3416.40 - 3420.24] that could be actually making you
[3418.16 - 3422.00] bloated getting you dizzy and hurting
[3420.24 - 3423.12] your stomach so keep in mind be your own
[3422.00 - 3424.80] detective

[3678.96 - 3683.20] so that's something to keep in mind like
[3680.72 - 3687.12] why do we need to be doing it what's the
[3683.20 - 3688.48] point why do we have to do it
[3687.12 - 3690.40] and you can do so much with steamed
[3688.48 - 3692.24] potato you can make potato waffles you
[3690.40 - 3693.92] can put maple syrup on it you can do it
[3692.24 - 3696.32] all right if you if you follow medical
[3693.92 - 3699.20] medium information and recipes you can
[3696.32 - 3701.20] see we can do everything with a potato
[3699.20 - 3704.64] so the goal you guys
[3701.20 - 3704.64] is not to bombard
[3704.72 - 3709.44] your
[3705.60 - 3711.28] liver and organs with fat in the morning
[3709.44 - 3713.28] you want to be
[3711.28 - 3714.88] fat free is what you want i got the
[3713.28 - 3717.28] oatmeal just heating up and cooking
[3714.88 - 3719.36] right there you want to be fat free in
[3717.28 - 3721.68] the morning keep that in mind that's a
[3719.36 - 3723.28] big way to cleanse
[3721.68 - 3726.40] if you have fats in the morning you
[3723.28 - 3728.48] can't cleanse so nothing cleanses just
[3726.40 - 3731.04] keep that in mind you want to stay
[3728.48 - 3733.12] hydrated in the morning so what happens
[3731.04 - 3735.44] is when you do your lemon water first
[3733.12 - 3737.20] thing in the morning 16 to 32 ounces and
[3735.44 - 3739.28] then you wait 15 to 30 minutes you do
[3737.20 - 3741.12] your celery juice 16 to 32 ounces of
[3739.28 - 3743.52] celery juice right and then you have
[3741.12 - 3745.76] your heavy metal detox smoothie
[3743.52 - 3747.36] if you want if that's one option or you
[3745.76 - 3749.28] don't need anything and you just want
[3747.36 - 3752.16] you know an orange or something right
[3749.28 - 3754.72] that's something whatever it is
[3752.16 - 3756.16] you're allowing yourself to cleanse
[3754.72 - 3758.08] is what's happening you can drink
[3756.16 - 3760.08] coconut water sometime in the morning
[3758.08 - 3762.72] which would be really smart 16 extra
[3760.08 - 3763.76] ounces of coconut water 16x extra ounces
[3762.72 - 3765.52] of water
[3763.76 - 3767.20] those are important too you want to make
[3765.52 - 3769.52] sure you're hydrated all morning so
[3767.20 - 3771.44] you're finishing your cleanse

[3776.48 - 3779.20] days because we're doing it for two days

[3997.60 - 4002.24] about quinoa the question was can i do
[3999.92 - 4004.48] quinoa
[4002.24 - 4007.44] the reason why quinoa is not a highly
[4004.48 - 4010.08] recommended medical medium food
[4007.44 - 4012.16] is because it's scratchy
[4010.08 - 4013.92] it's scratchy
[4012.16 - 4014.59] so many people come to medical medium
[4013.92 - 4015.68] information
[4014.59 - 4016.56] [Music]
[4015.68 - 4019.60] to be
[4016.56 - 4021.52] taken away from pain to come out and
[4019.60 - 4023.20] rise above their illness and symptom and
[4021.52 - 4025.92] condition
[4023.20 - 4027.36] quinoa is not a guarantee
[4025.92 - 4029.20] that's going to happen for somebody with
[4027.36 - 4030.96] intestinal tract disorders
[4029.20 - 4032.68] it's scratchy
[4030.96 - 4034.56] people have diverticulitis
[4032.68 - 4036.56] diverticulosis right
[4034.56 - 4038.72] it's a different scratchy it's not like
[4036.56 - 4040.28] when you have some lettuce and you have
[4038.72 - 4042.32] diverticulitis that's good for
[4040.28 - 4044.56] diverticulitis right
[4042.32 - 4048.08] it's not like that it's a different kind
[4044.56 - 4051.60] of abrasive scratch quinoa causes so
[4048.08 - 4054.40] when you have crohn's colitis ibs other
[4051.60 - 4056.56] intestinal tract disorders gastroparesis
[4054.40 - 4058.16] other problems in the intestinal tract
[4056.56 - 4060.40] inflammation in the intestinal tract
[4058.16 - 4062.80] quinoa is not the best bet
[4060.40 - 4064.08] yeah i like quinoa it's not the best bet
[4062.80 - 4065.68] though for somebody with all kinds of
[4064.08 - 4068.32] other conditions
[4065.68 - 4069.92] that's why it's not recommended very
[4068.32 - 4071.76] important to know cold white spring good
[4069.92 - 4073.92] to see you may good to see you yeah it's
[4071.76 - 4074.72] because it's scratchy
[4073.92 - 4076.80] so
[4074.72 - 4078.56] so and people don't realize this so you
[4076.80 - 4080.32] have somebody and they got all these
[4078.56 - 4081.92] kinds of issues they got celiac they got
[4080.32 - 4083.20] sibo they got all these other conditions
[4081.92 - 4084.40] and they're still having problems and
[4083.20 - 4085.92] they don't know what the problem is
[4084.40 - 4087.68] they're just like oh my god i just went
[4085.92 - 4089.84] to the bathroom i don't know what's
[4087.68 - 4092.16] going on here and they don't realize it
[4089.84 - 4094.72] but the quinoa is causing an aggravated
[4092.16 - 4096.80] issue inside it's not it's not that
[4094.72 - 4098.48] quinoa feeds bugs it doesn't quinoa
[4096.80 - 4100.48] doesn't feed pathogens it doesn't feed
[4098.48 - 4102.00] epstein-barr it doesn't feed it doesn't
[4100.48 - 4103.92] feed streptococcus all the medical
[4102.00 - 4105.28] medium information about epsine bar and
[4103.92 - 4107.76] all those other different pathogens
[4105.28 - 4110.32] right it doesn't feed those
[4107.76 - 4112.16] right oatmeal doesn't feed pathogens
[4110.32 - 4114.88] millet doesn't feed pathogens but what
[4112.16 - 4118.88] you have to understand is the quinoa has
[4114.88 - 4121.60] a scratch to it then that scratchiness
[4118.88 - 4124.24] because quinoa doesn't break down
[4121.60 - 4126.40] and it goes through you like sandpaper
[4124.24 - 4127.84] and that's why it's not recommended but
[4126.40 - 4130.56] but but yet
[4127.84 - 4132.40] i've said you can eat it sure and it's
[4130.56 - 4133.92] something that's still
