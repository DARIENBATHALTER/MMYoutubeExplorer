[638.40 - 643.12] will be all 50 states there it's very
[640.92 - 646.40] possible there will be because what
[643.12 - 650.28] we're hearing and what little birdies
[646.40 - 651.84] are telling us is some people are coming
[650.28 - 654.60] it's not going to just be a hundred
[651.84 - 657.64] people there and so this thing is

[673.60 - 677.28] to be thirsty I'm going to be thirsty
[675.64 - 680.00] I'm going to probably grab a few of them
[677.28 - 681.36] and tank them down and I'll just tank
[680.00 - 682.36] them down in front of you guys because
[681.36 - 684.12] that's probably what's going to happen
[682.36 - 686.24] is you'll be seeing me tank them down
[684.12 - 688.32] I'll show you how I drink them in person
[686.24 - 689.80] in like real time in person I'll show
[688.32 - 691.72] you how I drink them down
[689.80 - 693.68] it's probably not the best way to do it
[691.72 - 696.60] you know cuz I don't take my time I just

[711.28 - 714.52] so let's get on with it I want to talk
[712.96 - 716.96] about some metals a little bit if you
[714.52 - 718.80] guys don't mind it's critical to get
[716.96 - 721.24] toxic heavy metals out of the body
[718.80 - 723.16] that's why the heavy metal detox has
[721.24 - 725.96] been so powerful and has helped people
[723.16 - 727.16] move forward to such a degree and you
[725.96 - 731.12] know it's
[727.16 - 733.36] critical to remove metals because bugs
[731.12 - 736.04] love Metals we're going to go into that
[733.36 - 738.80] a little bit sound exciting it is
[736.04 - 741.24] exciting understanding how it works like
[738.80 - 743.52] when metals are in our body and they
[741.24 - 746.00] enter our body every single day when
[743.52 - 750.20] you're pumping gas at the at the gas
[746.00 - 752.68] station metals are entering our lungs
[750.20 - 756.16] and in our body you can smell them at
[752.68 - 759.92] the gas station if you're driving an EV
[756.16 - 763.04] uhhuh metals leeching from the battery
[759.92 - 766.68] the 600 lb battery sitting underneath
[763.04 - 768.60] your butt so metals are everywhere
[766.68 - 770.00] doesn't matter if you got an EV it
[768.60 - 773.16] doesn't matter if you're breathing in
[770.00 - 775.68] the smog that's choking out of a car we
[773.16 - 778.48] bring breathe in metals all the time we
[775.68 - 781.04] inherit them from generations and
[778.48 - 784.12] generations a people so we inherit these
[781.04 - 786.32] Metals all the time and then we also
[784.12 - 788.48] inherit pathogens as well we inherit
[786.32 - 791.04] those that's a virus right there and
[788.48 - 792.68] viruses love to eat metal so we're going
[791.04 - 795.64] to go into that a little bit the whole
[792.68 - 797.92] thing so let's cut into it and then when
[795.64 - 800.00] that happens our immune system gets
[797.92 - 801.44] burdened our immune system that's an
[800.00 - 804.64] immune cell right there our immune
[801.44 - 806.92] system gets burdened when we have too
[804.64 - 809.76] many metals in us and pathogens are
[806.92 - 812.12] feeding off of those metals so let's get
[809.76 - 815.68] into it a little bit okay so let's
[812.12 - 818.08] create a nice toxic heavy metal patch
[815.68 - 820.56] right here a nice toxic heavy metal
[818.08 - 822.32] patch right here one here okay we'll put
[820.56 - 824.60] a few different ones around if you guys
[822.32 - 825.44] don't mind all right you guys can see
[824.60 - 828.16] that
[825.44 - 829.04] right there we go and then we're going
[828.16 - 834.08] to
[829.04 - 835.68] put a pathogen a pathogen here we go
[834.08 - 837.88] look we're going to put some spikes on
[835.68 - 839.76] this pathogen how about that put some
[837.88 - 841.84] spikes on this one too
[839.76 - 843.80] all right we got some pathogens in the
[841.84 - 846.16] bloodstream we got pathogens in the
[843.80 - 848.76] organs we got them in the liver how
[846.16 - 850.52] about that so we got some viruses right
[848.76 - 853.08] here and then we also have different
[850.52 - 855.56] kinds of pathogens too so let's do a
[853.08 - 858.68] little bit of that here's a different
[855.56 - 860.08] one okay all kinds of different bugs are
[858.68 - 863.20] inside of everybody you want to know why
[860.08 - 865.28] everybody's sick bugs and toxins what
[863.20 - 868.64] are some of the toxins toxic heavy
[865.28 - 873.84] metals bugs and toxins are why people
[868.64 - 875.68] are sick it's bugs and toxins okay so we
[873.84 - 877.28] got the pathogens we got all that these
[875.68 - 878.72] are the toxic heavy metals I'm just
[877.28 - 882.72] going to kind of circle them a little
[878.72 - 886.00] bit okay lead Mercury aluminum cadmium
[882.72 - 888.08] toxic Metals not even just heavy I call
[886.00 - 891.64] them all Heavy because they do serious
[888.08 - 893.48] damage on the body all right so we we
[891.64 - 895.68] have that right there so what you're
[893.48 - 897.84] looking at is a whole bunch of circles
[895.68 - 900.20] whole bunch of different spots okay but
[897.84 - 903.16] this is your body this whole thing is
[900.20 - 905.88] your body right here okay your body is
[903.16 - 908.28] this right here and inside your body you
[905.88 - 910.44] got your organs and you can you got your
[908.28 - 915.08] bloodstream you got your brain you got
[910.44 - 918.00] everything so what happens all right so
[915.08 - 921.08] toxic heavy metals break down over time
[918.00 - 925.04] keep that in mind they break down over
[921.08 - 927.28] time Metals shed so what you're seeing
[925.04 - 930.92] right here coming out of deposits of
[927.28 - 934.92] metals right what what you're seeing is
[930.92 - 937.92] out gassing you're seeing oxidation some
[934.92 - 941.16] metals oxidate in your brain and body
[937.92 - 943.44] keep that in mind they oxidize in your
[941.16 - 944.72] liver oxidize in your pancreas you know
[943.44 - 947.88] how many people are getting pancreatic
[944.72 - 949.88] cancer right now it's insane it's every
[947.88 - 951.92] single day this person is diagnosed with
[949.88 - 953.84] panc pancreatic cancer this person is
[951.92 - 956.28] pancreatic cancer this person has a
[953.84 - 959.32] pancreatic tumor this person has this
[956.28 - 961.08] and that it's crazy to the to the degree
[959.32 - 963.72] that is happening right now out there
[961.08 - 966.44] okay this person is liver cancer this
[963.72 - 969.84] person is colon cancer this person is
[966.44 - 974.52] this and that and you guys know
[969.84 - 978.88] pathogens are those cancer cells right
[974.52 - 983.00] viral cells turn into cancer cells
[978.88 - 987.32] that's how it works viral cells need
[983.00 - 991.32] fuel to turn into cancer cells to turn
[987.32 - 996.44] into disease creating cells just so you
[991.32 - 999.28] know so Metals start to out gas out
[996.44 - 1000.80] pocket they start to oxidize so that's
[999.28 - 1002.48] what these Metals do so I'm putting a
[1000.80 - 1004.76] little bit of a butterfly around all
[1002.48 - 1006.36] these metal all these Metals right here
[1004.76 - 1008.00] okay and you'll see you see that
[1006.36 - 1011.20] butterfly around them that's what we
[1008.00 - 1013.88] want to call it okay I'm putting a
[1011.20 - 1017.36] little all of this is Metals breaking
[1013.88 - 1019.68] down so we live our life we don't get
[1017.36 - 1022.84] enough antioxidants that's right we
[1019.68 - 1026.40] start to oxidize we get really acidic
[1022.84 - 1029.72] and the acid starts to break down the
[1026.40 - 1032.56] metals they start to outp poet they
[1029.72 - 1035.32] start to break down those are the metals
[1032.56 - 1038.88] right there and when they do that
[1035.32 - 1042.92] they're leeching and when they're
[1038.88 - 1046.56] leeching that junk and toxic crap coming
[1042.92 - 1049.44] off of them are leeching into your
[1046.56 - 1052.68] bloodstream and into organ tissue is if
[1049.44 - 1055.44] it's your brain they're leeching into
[1052.68 - 1057.52] your brain tissue right just keep that
[1055.44 - 1058.88] in mind okay so that's your brain right
[1057.52 - 1061.52] there if it's your brain they're
[1058.88 - 1065.04] leeching into brain tissue if it's your
[1061.52 - 1068.12] organs like your liver they're leeching
[1065.04 - 1071.04] into liver tissue okay so there's liver
[1068.12 - 1072.88] there's the brain right there so keep
[1071.04 - 1077.00] your eye on those because they're all
[1072.88 - 1080.92] part of it okay so now we got the bugs
[1077.00 - 1084.20] we got the pathogens we got the viruses
[1080.92 - 1087.92] the viruses that create cancer the
[1084.20 - 1091.88] viruses that create all kinds of
[1087.92 - 1094.88] inflammation takes a pathogen to create
[1091.88 - 1096.84] inflammation critical to understand but
[1094.88 - 1099.60] a pathogen needs to stay alive and a
[1096.84 - 1102.48] pathogen needs to eat it has to eat to
[1099.60 - 1105.00] stay it can't just
[1102.48 - 1107.80] exist classified medical research and
[1105.00 - 1110.32] science keeps pathogens alive in their
[1107.80 - 1112.68] labs using
[1110.32 - 1114.72] mercury classified medical research and
[1112.68 - 1117.48] science uses Mercury to keep pathogens
[1114.72 - 1119.48] alive it's a preservative to keep
[1117.48 - 1121.56] pathogens nice and fat and happy and
[1119.48 - 1125.56] alive so the
[1121.56 - 1128.12] pathogen the pathogen can Thrive because
[1125.56 - 1129.72] pathogens feed off of mercury public
[1128.12 - 1132.12] medical research and science doesn't
[1129.72 - 1134.96] know that Medical in medical medium
[1132.12 - 1136.80] information published all the stuff on
[1134.96 - 1139.64] how Mercury feeds pathogens feeds
[1136.80 - 1141.96] viruses and so forth what happens is
[1139.64 - 1145.24] pathogens eat the Mercury then they
[1141.96 - 1148.60] release neurotoxins neurotoxins give you
[1145.24 - 1150.20] all your different Vegas nerve symptoms
[1148.60 - 1152.08] all your different cranial nerve
[1150.20 - 1155.80] symptoms it makes you get ticks and
[1152.08 - 1157.76] spasms aches and pains fatigue fatigue
[1155.80 - 1159.80] where your legs are like sandbags your
[1157.76 - 1162.24] arms are like sandbags you can't
[1159.80 - 1164.28] function you get the brain fog you get
[1162.24 - 1166.88] all kinds of bizarre depression you get
[1164.28 - 1169.36] all kinds of bizarre sadness anxiety
[1166.88 - 1171.48] through the roof panic attacks heart
[1169.36 - 1173.64] arrhythmias that aren't heart problems
[1171.48 - 1176.72] but instead they're like mysterious aibs
[1173.64 - 1180.52] and everything all these toxins related
[1176.72 - 1182.76] to pathogens from Metals right so
[1180.52 - 1186.56] classified medical research and science
[1182.76 - 1188.88] uses Mercury as a preservative to keep a
[1186.56 - 1191.20] pathogen alive so they could study it
[1188.88 - 1193.64] mess with it put it back out into the
[1191.20 - 1195.52] environment in people some way some
[1193.64 - 1197.44] shape some form so we can just kind of
[1195.52 - 1199.12] all pass around every single bug
[1197.44 - 1203.44] everybody could even imagine like the
[1199.12 - 1204.92] herpes family simplex one Simplex 2 um
[1203.44 - 1208.40] all the different herpes viruses
[1204.92 - 1210.80] shingles Epstein bar hhv6 hhv7
[1208.40 - 1213.24] undiscovered 10 through 16 and so forth
[1210.80 - 1216.40] all this medical medum information you
[1213.24 - 1219.28] guys know so here's how it works right
[1216.40 - 1222.48] you got your Metals that's this right
[1219.28 - 1224.88] here your metal Pockets they're
[1222.48 - 1227.64] expanding they're in your liver they're
[1224.88 - 1230.56] in your brain these metal pockets are
[1227.64 - 1233.44] expanding they're in your liver in your
[1230.56 - 1236.92] brain they're in your pancreas they're
[1233.44 - 1240.20] in your spleen yep they are they're in
[1236.92 - 1244.32] your colon lining how about that in your
[1240.20 - 1247.00] colon lining right so these are pockets
[1244.32 - 1249.68] of metal they're expanding and
[1247.00 - 1250.64] outgassing let's go to viruses now let's
[1249.68 - 1256.12] go to
[1250.64 - 1259.48] bugs everybody has a virus in them
[1256.12 - 1261.92] everybody has one if they're the one
[1259.48 - 1264.36] person at this point on the planet that
[1261.92 - 1266.68] doesn't have an Epstein
[1264.36 - 1268.96] bar then they have a
[1266.68 - 1270.96] shingles if it's the one person on this
[1268.96 - 1273.96] planet that doesn't have a shingles
[1270.96 - 1276.28] variety right then they have an
[1273.96 - 1278.80] hhv6 if it's the one person that doesn't
[1276.28 - 1281.60] have an hhv6 they got an
[1278.80 - 1283.16] hsv1 they got the Simplex cold sore
[1281.60 - 1287.36] fever blister
[1283.16 - 1289.88] virus goes on and on and on everyone has
[1287.36 - 1291.96] a bug in them
[1289.88 - 1294.36] the key is how many bugs do they have in
[1291.96 - 1295.96] them okay do they have three or four
[1294.36 - 1298.16] varieties of epine bar that they picked
[1295.96 - 1300.44] up along the way because they just did
[1298.16 - 1302.60] do they have five Epstein bars do they
[1300.44 - 1304.40] have three shingles do they have hhv6
[1302.60 - 1305.88] ceglar virus what do they have in them
[1304.40 - 1307.56] do they have three varieties of cold
[1305.88 - 1309.24] sore viruses because a lot of people
[1307.56 - 1310.64] they don't just have one cold sore virus
[1309.24 - 1312.28] they don't know it but they have three
[1310.64 - 1314.44] and then they'll have a canker sore
[1312.28 - 1315.92] virus too which is also herpetic from
[1314.44 - 1317.76] the herpetic family but it's not the
[1315.92 - 1320.12] cold sore virus but they'll have the
[1317.76 - 1321.88] canker sore kker stores will come out
[1320.12 - 1325.72] all the time and so forth
[1321.88 - 1329.40] right everyone has a bug I'm sorry to
[1325.72 - 1331.48] say that it's just how many do they have
[1329.40 - 1333.56] and which varieties do they have do they
[1331.48 - 1334.84] have two shingles in an epscene bar do
[1333.56 - 1337.72] they not have a shingles but they have
[1334.84 - 1341.48] an hhv7 what do they have do they have
[1337.72 - 1343.44] hsv1 okay so we're establishing that are
[1341.48 - 1345.60] there bugs causing problems are there
[1343.44 - 1347.04] bugs giving them aches and pains fatigue
[1345.60 - 1348.92] all kinds of different brain fog all
[1347.04 - 1350.32] kinds of different anxiety depression
[1348.92 - 1352.84] are the bugs creating all these
[1350.32 - 1355.32] different numbness feelings and tingles
[1352.84 - 1357.16] is it giving them um ttis and ringing
[1355.32 - 1358.80] the ears whooing in the ears popping in
[1357.16 - 1361.00] the ears is it giving them tightness of
[1358.80 - 1363.24] the chest tightness of the jaw pain in
[1361.00 - 1364.92] the back of their head what is it doing
[1363.24 - 1366.88] is it giving them vertigo and dizzy
[1364.92 - 1368.36] balance issues are they dizzy are they
[1366.88 - 1371.08] having problems did they have a bad
[1368.36 - 1373.44] vertigo last year that is Epstein bar by
[1371.08 - 1375.88] the way what are they having what are
[1373.44 - 1379.36] they dealing with so that's the next
[1375.88 - 1382.40] level and then we got
[1379.36 - 1383.40] Metals metals and I'm not talking about
[1382.40 - 1386.52] heavy
[1383.40 - 1389.24] metal the music I'm talking about toxic
[1386.52 - 1391.20] heavy metals and toxic Metals which
[1389.24 - 1393.64] people also have they inherit it from
[1391.20 - 1395.60] the family line Mercury all the way down
[1393.64 - 1397.92] and so forth and we collect more and
[1395.60 - 1399.92] more metal every single day like I said
[1397.92 - 1402.64] you just go to the gas station stick the
[1399.92 - 1403.60] gas pump in I took celery Force by the
[1402.64 - 1406.76] way is it
[1403.60 - 1408.92] showing is it showing cuz I'm like you
[1406.76 - 1412.12] stick the gas pump in you breathe in
[1408.92 - 1414.96] those gas fumes and those gas fumes have
[1412.12 - 1416.84] metal in them you drive your EV around
[1414.96 - 1418.72] you're like hey I don't have gas in the
[1416.84 - 1420.56] car I'm doing good this way too and
[1418.72 - 1423.20] you're breathing in and out gas over
[1420.56 - 1426.04] time it's coming off the battery in the
[1423.20 - 1428.68] car right regardless we're getting
[1426.04 - 1430.64] Metals out of the sky in all of the sea
[1428.68 - 1431.96] Trails we're getting Metals in
[1430.64 - 1433.92] Pharmaceuticals that a lot of people
[1431.96 - 1435.56] take I mean they take Pharmaceuticals
[1433.92 - 1437.04] prescribed by their doctors for
[1435.56 - 1439.00] different things they're getting metals
[1437.04 - 1440.52] from there too it's just all part of
[1439.00 - 1443.48] life here and then we get metals from
[1440.52 - 1445.56] our food supply we get metals from all
[1443.48 - 1448.00] kinds of different things and those
[1445.56 - 1450.00] Metals sit inside of our organs they sit
[1448.00 - 1452.16] inside of our liver they sit inside of
[1450.00 - 1454.28] our brain that's where the metals sit
[1452.16 - 1457.84] and then they pocket out they out gas
[1454.28 - 1460.56] and eventually they spread now you can
[1457.84 - 1463.40] get new metal exposures just say at the
[1460.56 - 1466.88] gas pump or breathing in breathing in
[1463.40 - 1469.60] fragrances colog perfumes you like the
[1466.88 - 1472.92] smell smells so pretty it smells like
[1469.60 - 1475.16] beautiful wild flowers in this beautiful
[1472.92 - 1477.36] place I love the smell of this perfume
[1475.16 - 1479.68] cologne and this air freshener that I
[1477.36 - 1482.72] just sprayed on my couch filled with
[1479.68 - 1484.24] Metals we breathe it in we smell it
[1482.72 - 1486.64] we're smelling metals and they're
[1484.24 - 1489.20] entering into our body we can't run from
[1486.64 - 1490.72] it we can't hide it's everywhere right
[1489.20 - 1492.64] of course we can pull our air freshener
[1490.72 - 1494.04] out of the wall and toss it of course we
[1492.64 - 1495.84] can pull something out of the wall and
[1494.04 - 1498.60] toss it like that we can throw
[1495.84 - 1500.28] detergents out and bring in you know
[1498.60 - 1502.64] fragrance-free detergents in hopes that
[1500.28 - 1505.32] we're actually bypassing a lot of them
[1502.64 - 1506.88] we can do a lot of things we can avoid
[1505.32 - 1508.84] fluoride at the
[1506.88 - 1511.00] dentist we can avoid which is a
[1508.84 - 1513.12] neurotoxin byproduct of aluminum we
[1511.00 - 1514.64] could avoid that we can do some things
[1513.12 - 1516.92] but either way we've had fluoride
[1514.64 - 1519.96] treatments in the past maybe when you
[1516.92 - 1525.60] were younger either way those Metals
[1519.96 - 1525.60] build up and they out poock and then
[1528.88 - 1533.88] Metals meet the road they meet the
[1531.88 - 1537.48] pavement right here the metals meet the
[1533.88 - 1539.04] virus see this Metals meet the virus now
[1537.48 - 1542.04] here's what happens with viruses and
[1539.04 - 1544.92] here's what goes on with viruses okay
[1542.04 - 1544.92] Metals meet the
[1545.68 - 1549.64] virus viruses are on the same frequency
[1548.28 - 1552.96] as toxic heavy
[1549.64 - 1556.20] metals same
[1552.96 - 1559.64] frequency they're not
[1556.20 - 1563.60] opposites okay pathogens like viruses
[1559.64 - 1567.40] are on the same frequency as toxic heavy
[1563.60 - 1570.96] metals they morph together is what they
[1567.40 - 1573.40] do they bond so that's what they do they
[1570.96 - 1578.68] bond and that's important to know the
[1573.40 - 1581.56] metals Bond there's a b o n
[1578.68 - 1586.24] d hope that's how you spell it Metals
[1581.56 - 1589.96] bond together with pathogens they make a
[1586.24 - 1593.20] connection So eventually pathogen gets
[1589.96 - 1595.88] hungry it's looking for food and then it
[1593.20 - 1598.20] finds it it starts to Feast on the toxic
[1595.88 - 1600.84] heavy metal because we're all loaded
[1598.20 - 1603.20] with Metals but how loaded are you how
[1600.84 - 1605.72] loaded I get Metals in me every
[1603.20 - 1608.08] day if I get Metals in me every day you
[1605.72 - 1609.64] get Metals in you every day if I walk
[1608.08 - 1611.44] outside and I'm breathing in a Sea Trail
[1609.64 - 1612.92] and I'm getting Metals in how much crap
[1611.44 - 1615.64] they're dumping on the out of the sky on
[1612.92 - 1617.40] us every single day right now and then
[1615.64 - 1619.64] you got you got regular crap being
[1617.40 - 1621.84] dumped on us just just that alone from
[1619.64 - 1623.36] all the all the fuel that's coming off
[1621.84 - 1626.28] of planes I'm not even talking about sea
[1623.36 - 1627.76] Trails just the fuel alone right so you
[1626.28 - 1629.24] walk outside I'm walking outside I'm
[1627.76 - 1630.76] breathing in toxic heavy metals you're
[1629.24 - 1633.44] breathing in toxic heavy metals are you
[1630.76 - 1635.16] in town are you breathing in that stuff
[1633.44 - 1637.36] coming out of the trucks and everything
[1635.16 - 1639.64] else when you're on the street did you
[1637.36 - 1641.32] smell all that diesel fuel and you're
[1639.64 - 1643.72] like whoa what is that I'm breathing in
[1641.32 - 1647.60] metals you're breathing in metals that's
[1643.72 - 1649.08] right but how many metals do you have do
[1647.60 - 1651.04] you got multip sceris do you have
[1649.08 - 1652.40] fibromyalgia do you have ra do you have
[1651.04 - 1653.48] autoimmune disease do you have some

[1655.08 - 1661.76] have what are you what's ailing you

[1679.24 - 1685.28] is metals are
[1682.08 - 1687.36] involved metals and the metals are
[1685.28 - 1689.40] meeting the pavement baby the pavement
[1687.36 - 1691.32] is the pathogen right they're meeting
[1689.40 - 1693.16] the road they're meeting together
[1691.32 - 1695.36] they're running into each other is
[1693.16 - 1698.00] what's happening pathogens and metals
[1695.36 - 1701.08] are running into each other so you got
[1698.00 - 1703.44] Boom the pathogen sorry the metals Boom
[1701.08 - 1705.48] the pathogen and they're doing this
[1703.44 - 1707.48] they're meeting and when they're meeting
[1705.48 - 1709.96] the pathogen is feasting so let's go
[1707.48 - 1712.24] into that next next right and that's
[1709.96 - 1715.72] what's happening here we're going to go

[1980.68 - 1985.32] Metals pathogens are on the same
[1982.72 - 1986.96] frequency as mercury and the metals
[1985.32 - 1990.12] classified medical research and science
[1986.96 - 1992.16] uses Mercury to preserve pathogens and
[1990.12 - 1993.56] keep them alive by feeding the pathogen
[1992.16 - 1995.84] while it's sitting there in the in the
[1993.56 - 1998.48] lab so they can study it work on it and
[1995.84 - 2000.48] everything else pathogens are inside our
[1998.48 - 2002.44] body everybody's got viruses in them
[2000.48 - 2004.12] it's all about killing them off learning
[2002.44 - 2006.48] how to do that through medical medium
[2004.12 - 2008.52] information killing your viruses off
[2006.48 - 2010.84] getting rid of them and so forth forth
[2008.52 - 2012.44] knocking them back but everybody's got
[2010.84 - 2014.16] bugs that they're that they're dealing
[2012.44 - 2017.36] with keeping them sick giving them all
[2014.16 - 2020.04] these problems and what you do is you
[2017.36 - 2022.36] actually have to take food away from
[2020.04 - 2025.92] those bugs you have to take Metals away
[2022.36 - 2028.96] from those bugs okay are you coming to
[2025.92 - 2031.24] Los Angeles I'm coming to Los Angeles
[2028.96 - 2032.96] I'm going to be there in Culver City
[2031.24 - 2035.60] somebody just ask that on IG I'm going
[2032.96 - 2038.04] to be in Culver City in Los Angeles yes
[2035.60 - 2040.24] myself personally there and I'm going to

[2057.00 - 2063.64] you never never know who knows all right
[2061.36 - 2065.08] so you guys let's keep on going with
[2063.64 - 2066.48] this a little bit so why do we have to
[2065.08 - 2067.96] remove these metals because we have to
[2066.48 - 2069.92] take away the food from the past
[2067.96 - 2072.76] pathogens and if you don't know why
[2069.92 - 2074.40] you're sick how are you going to heal
[2072.76 - 2076.24] you can do hit or miss out there I'll
[2074.40 - 2077.88] try some intermittent fasting I'll try a
[2076.24 - 2079.64] little bit of this I'll try a little bit
[2077.88 - 2081.64] of that I'm feeling a little better but
[2079.64 - 2083.72] not okay I did good for like a little
[2081.64 - 2085.56] bit now I'm not I'll try this supplement

[2085.56 - 2089.44] try the cold Pune I'll try that I'll try
[2087.56 - 2091.84] this I'll try and that's what people do
[2089.44 - 2094.04] out there but in the end do they really
[2091.84 - 2096.12] know why they're sick and what are they
[2094.04 - 2098.24] really shooting for what are they trying
[2096.12 - 2099.92] to do well I got deficiency and this
[2098.24 - 2101.60] doctor told me this and this this health
[2099.92 - 2103.28] coach told me that now I'm staying away
[2101.60 - 2106.80] from this now I'm doing that but do you
[2103.28 - 2108.52] know why you're sick how are you sick
[2106.80 - 2110.52] because somebody else out there who
[2108.52 - 2112.12] aren't sick yet they're doing whatever
[2110.52 - 2114.32] they want they can go sit out in the sun
[2112.12 - 2116.44] for you know hours with slathered with
[2114.32 - 2118.28] lotion on they can do whatever they want
[2116.44 - 2119.76] to do they're not tired they get up
[2118.28 - 2122.12] every single morning they eat a loaf of
[2119.76 - 2123.60] bread when they want they'll eat bacon
[2122.12 - 2125.60] and eggs and a loaf of bread they'll
[2123.60 - 2127.16] have an egg cheese sandwich from some
[2125.60 - 2129.32] you know chain restaurant they'll do
[2127.16 - 2130.72] whatever they're living their life sure
[2129.32 - 2132.56] there's complications that could happen
[2130.72 - 2134.84] either way but they're not sick yet but
[2132.56 - 2136.44] then there's somebody who's really sick
[2134.84 - 2137.72] and they're doing good stuff they're
[2136.44 - 2140.04] trying this and they're trying that but
[2137.72 - 2144.32] they're really sick and suffering but
[2140.04 - 2146.96] why are you sick critical to know Metals
[2144.32 - 2148.92] play a massive role to why people are
[2146.96 - 2150.60] struggling why they're suffering and why
[2148.92 - 2152.28] they're sick with MS and all kinds of
[2150.60 - 2155.12] different symptoms and conditions just
[2152.28 - 2157.64] one condition Lyme disease fibromyalgia
[2155.12 - 2160.16] chronic fatig syndrome and so forth and
[2157.64 - 2162.44] and then on top of that it's the metals
[2160.16 - 2165.04] and the pathogens Right medical mean
[2162.44 - 2166.72] information look people can do whatever
[2165.04 - 2169.48] floats your boat you can do what you
[2166.72 - 2171.84] want out there you can eat this way you
[2169.48 - 2173.08] can go do this you can try this but if

[2192.56 - 2196.04] that's what matters that's the heavy
[2194.00 - 2199.08] metal detox and that's what we're
[2196.04 - 2202.64] talking about okay pathogens and toxins
[2199.08 - 2206.68] so we have we have pathogens we have the
[2202.64 - 2208.36] bugs we have the metals and right there
[2206.68 - 2211.08] it's that combination so what does the
[2208.36 - 2214.24] pathogen do what does the virus do the
[2211.08 - 2217.08] virus clings onto the metal the metal
[2214.24 - 2220.72] clings onto the virus the metal sits on
[2217.08 - 2221.92] the virus virus like this so the metal
[2220.72 - 2225.64] sits on the
[2221.92 - 2230.40] virus particles of the oxidation sit on
[2225.64 - 2232.68] the virus just like this okay and then
[2230.40 - 2235.16] the virus dissolves the particles
[2232.68 - 2239.84] dissolves it absorbs it through the
[2235.16 - 2242.08] membrane and feeds on it once a virus
[2239.84 - 2244.72] has Metals in it and it's been feeding
[2242.08 - 2247.32] on those metals and it's
[2244.72 - 2249.24] absorbing those metals and bringing them
[2247.32 - 2251.32] into into the virus you see this right
[2249.24 - 2252.28] here the metals are clinging onto the
[2251.32 - 2255.60] viral
[2252.28 - 2257.92] wall a cell wall and they're being
[2255.60 - 2260.12] absorbed right into the virus you see
[2257.92 - 2263.84] that you guys once that
[2260.12 - 2267.16] happens the virus gets fueled it gets
[2263.84 - 2269.68] strength it awakens when it awakens it
[2267.16 - 2273.28] becomes a beast depending on what kind
[2269.68 - 2275.20] of virus you have it becomes a beast so
[2273.28 - 2277.52] once those get in there the metals go in
[2275.20 - 2279.80] it now the virus is awake and it's Fe
[2277.52 - 2283.72] feeding once it's feeding it has to go
[2279.80 - 2286.52] to the bathroom it has to go to the
[2283.72 - 2289.36] bathroom it has to eliminate the virus
[2286.52 - 2293.40] has to eliminate toxins now the more
[2289.36 - 2295.16] fuel the virus gets which is the metals
[2293.40 - 2299.20] the more fuel the virus gets which is
[2295.16 - 2301.32] all those Metals the more bathroom is
[2299.20 - 2304.36] produced the more
[2301.32 - 2307.96] elimination is produced and when that
[2304.36 - 2309.56] elimination leaves the virus now that
[2307.96 - 2312.44] mercury that aluminum especially that
[2309.56 - 2314.96] mercury aluminum the copper right the
[2312.44 - 2318.20] lead the cadmium the
[2314.96 - 2321.12] Arsenic right once that metal
[2318.20 - 2324.72] leaves in a different form out of the
[2321.12 - 2328.20] virus here it goes now those are
[2324.72 - 2331.24] neurotoxins neurotoxic waste coming out
[2328.20 - 2334.72] of those viruses epine bar herplex one
[2331.24 - 2340.32] herp Simplex 2 cytomegalo virus shingles
[2334.72 - 2342.92] herpes hhv6 hhv7 this is all particles
[2340.32 - 2344.96] being excreted from the virus now you
[2342.92 - 2347.28] see this stuff right here it's coming
[2344.96 - 2349.12] out and when that comes out it's going
[2347.28 - 2351.12] into your bloodstream now now you're
[2349.12 - 2353.16] getting aches and pains tingles and
[2351.12 - 2355.28] numbness now you're getting vertigo now
[2353.16 - 2357.84] you're getting more ttis now you're
[2355.28 - 2359.52] getting more problems here it is the
[2357.84 - 2362.28] elimination is
[2359.52 - 2364.60] neurotoxins being eliminated from the
[2362.28 - 2368.48] pathogen because the pathogen fed off of
[2364.60 - 2372.12] the metals so what you have here now
[2368.48 - 2375.76] is toxic waste coming from the pathogen
[2372.12 - 2378.60] the virus that toxic waste is now
[2375.76 - 2382.32] trouble what that toxic waste
[2378.60 - 2384.36] is okay that's your headache that's your
[2382.32 - 2386.04] tingles and numbness that's your ex and
[2384.36 - 2387.40] pains if it's been ruled out that they
[2386.04 - 2389.68] don't know why you have any of that at
[2387.40 - 2391.84] the doctor's office if they find an
[2389.68 - 2393.84] answer it's obvious but if you're
[2391.84 - 2396.00] somebody that like really doesn't know
[2393.84 - 2398.00] no one really has an answer mystery
[2396.00 - 2400.16] chronic illness for many years
[2398.00 - 2402.72] you're dealing with the metals and the
[2400.16 - 2405.64] viruses the metals and the
[2402.72 - 2409.88] viruses and those viruses are leeching
[2405.64 - 2412.28] out all of that now it's spewing out all
[2409.88 - 2414.24] that neurotoxin when that neurotoxin
[2412.28 - 2416.28] comes out goes into your bloodstream and
[2414.24 - 2419.04] guess where it ends up it ends up in
[2416.28 - 2421.76] here that's right it ends up in your
[2419.04 - 2425.00] liver guess where else it ends up as
[2421.76 - 2427.32] brain fog in your brain it ends up in
[2425.00 - 2429.52] your brain as brain fog start getting
[2427.32 - 2431.68] getting symptoms why do I have brain fog
[2429.52 - 2433.56] how come I'm losing my memory how come I
[2431.68 - 2436.76] actually can't think anymore how come
[2433.56 - 2439.40] I'm like so fogged out that's the
[2436.76 - 2442.68] neurotoxins leaving the pathogens the
[2439.40 - 2445.64] viruses after the pathogens just
[2442.68 - 2448.56] absorbed literally absorbed heavy metal
[2445.64 - 2451.04] runoff in heavy metal particles right
[2448.56 - 2454.00] here from all of this metal outgassing
[2451.04 - 2456.24] and oxidizing you see it all all of that
[2454.00 - 2458.04] and then the pathogen fed off of that
[2456.24 - 2459.32] and it's releasing all those neurotoxins
[2458.04 - 2461.64] those neurotoxins end up in the
[2459.32 - 2464.32] bloodstream and here we go in your
[2461.64 - 2466.72] bloodstream there it is right there in
[2464.32 - 2470.04] your organs in your bloodstream all of
[2466.72 - 2474.32] that neurotoxin and you're sick you got
[2470.04 - 2476.12] me cff you got chronic fatigue syndrome
[2474.32 - 2480.16] you got all kinds of different
[2476.12 - 2481.96] conditions you got pots right you got
[2480.16 - 2484.64] just so many different conditions that
[2481.96 - 2488.52] you can have ra and so forth and that's
[2484.64 - 2491.68] how it works okay all right
[2488.52 - 2494.88] see uh Mela over there on IG these
[2491.68 - 2498.80] changes have changed my life I was so
[2494.88 - 2502.64] sick I was very close to Suicide Anthony

[2543.16 - 2548.00] okay the heavy metal detox the medical
[2546.52 - 2550.80] medium heavy metal
[2548.00 - 2553.40] detox it's been life-saving for so many
[2550.80 - 2557.20] people for so many years there was
[2553.40 - 2560.80] nothing out there when that was out
[2557.20 - 2563.40] there saving lives there was nothing out
[2560.80 - 2565.84] there the whole term heavy metal detox
[2563.40 - 2568.28] now is because of the medical medium
[2565.84 - 2570.80] information out there all these years
[2568.28 - 2574.24] putting heavy metals on the map and
[2570.80 - 2577.16] heavy metal detox on the map five key
[2574.24 - 2578.48] ingredients is the heavy metal detox you
[2577.16 - 2580.56] you can essentially have those in
[2578.48 - 2583.52] anything you want you can have those in
[2580.56 - 2585.80] a salad you can have those in some other
[2583.52 - 2588.60] in a smoothie Bowl you can have those
[2585.80 - 2590.52] five key ingredients in some other form
[2588.60 - 2591.60] or some other way throughout the course
[2590.52 - 2594.08] of the
[2591.60 - 2597.96] day but you got to have those five key
[2594.08 - 2600.76] ingredients I like them any way possible
[2597.96 - 2603.40] okay but Awan medical medium
[2600.76 - 2605.12] collaboration June 15th they're putting
[2603.40 - 2607.68] the heavy metal detox smoothie on the
[2605.12 - 2610.24] menu there which is insane
[2607.68 - 2613.36] I'm so excited about it in all 10 of
[2610.24 - 2615.88] their stores how incredible any proceeds
[2613.36 - 2618.52] that go to me go directly to charity
[2615.88 - 2620.36] back to the medical medum community all
[2618.52 - 2623.40] right and you have to understand
[2620.36 - 2625.48] something kation was dangerous years ago
[2623.40 - 2627.32] the one thing about Spirit of compassion
[2625.48 - 2629.00] about putting the heavy metal detox the
[2627.32 - 2631.52] five key ingredients to get Metals out
[2629.00 - 2634.56] of us so we can heal and move forward is
[2631.52 - 2636.80] because there were dangerous cation
[2634.56 - 2638.56] techniques and the information wasn't
[2636.80 - 2640.28] because they knew Metals caused any
[2638.56 - 2642.40] conditions they didn't think Metals
[2640.28 - 2644.44] caused conditions they didn't think they
[2642.40 - 2646.04] caused this or this or psoriasis or
[2644.44 - 2648.64] eczema or anything like that this
[2646.04 - 2650.96] medical medium information but they use
[2648.64 - 2653.40] cation for like when you drank lead
[2650.96 - 2655.84] water you know like lead water like
[2653.40 - 2658.36] you're you're drinking tap water and
[2655.84 - 2660.68] then the city declared an emergency and
[2658.36 - 2661.84] that tap water was loaded with lead and
[2660.68 - 2665.36] then what they would do is they would
[2661.84 - 2667.56] try to do kelation on the person and it
[2665.36 - 2668.96] was like that's all they had but I'm
[2667.56 - 2670.52] talking about mystery chronic illness
[2668.96 - 2672.40] and people suffering and struggling and
[2670.52 - 2674.12] heavy metals that whole thing people
[2672.40 - 2676.48] didn't know anything about that they
[2674.12 - 2678.00] just didn't and spirit of compassion put
[2676.48 - 2680.48] the heavy metal detox out there all
[2678.00 - 2683.20] these years saved so many lives it's an
[2680.48 - 2685.84] incredible incredible thing so I'm just
[2683.20 - 2687.08] saying um but anyway you guys just want
[2685.84 - 2690.80] to tell
[2687.08 - 2692.00] you getting rid of metals is key if
[2690.80 - 2693.96] you're not going to get rid of the
[2692.00 - 2694.88] pathogens get rid of the metals if
[2693.96 - 2697.68] you're not going to get rid of the
[2694.88 - 2699.64] metals get rid of the pathogens
[2697.68 - 2701.88] medical medium information allows you to
[2699.64 - 2704.24] do both getting rid of pathogens and
[2701.88 - 2706.68] metals it's
[2704.24 - 2708.40] critical Mayan's over there and IG says
[2706.68 - 2712.48] what are the five
[2708.40 - 2714.88] ingredients well um five ingredients
