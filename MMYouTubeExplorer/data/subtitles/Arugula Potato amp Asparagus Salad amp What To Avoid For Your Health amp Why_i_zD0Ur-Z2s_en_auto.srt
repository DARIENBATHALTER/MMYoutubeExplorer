but i know that a lot of people do i

149
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,320
mean think about what everybody's eating

150
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,000
and maybe as

151
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,600

152
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,479

153
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,160
butter

they'll throw it on their acai bowl

156
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,039

161
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,680
i'm not gonna be able to stop you guys

162
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,600
from eating fats every day you just guys

163
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,039
most of you guys are just gonna do it

164
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,479
and you're gonna do it continuously

165
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,000
every single day and there's there's no

166
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:21,120
stopping you it's not like

167
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,759
i'm not trying to be like you know

168
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,960
a problem and be hey you shouldn't be

169
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,919
doing that shouldn't be doing that it's

170
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,080
not it it's just that

171
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,320
it's good to take a break when you can

172
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,400
maybe take a day off

173
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,919

174
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,919

arteries all that fat builds up in the

181
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,479
veins and that's what happens there

182
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,759

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,360
fats every day when you do the pork when

189
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,720
you do the bacon when you do the milk

190
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,280
cheese butter when you do

191
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,919
the nut butter cisco is plant-based too

192
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,360
this isn't

193
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,600
you know just because we say we're

194
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,479
plant-based say we're

281
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:33,200
also can come

282
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,560
side by side with chronic illness any

283
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,839
kind of chronic illness you know when

284
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,080
when you're healing that chronic

285
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,440
illness you start healing everything and

286
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,519
you just really

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,800

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,880
i really am so you guys let's talk about

290
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,440
foods

291
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,360
not to eat so joanne says i love all

292
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,920
these foods but hard to

293
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,000
hard for me to eat so look you take one

294
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,600
day at a time you eat what you can

295
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,519
you feel like leslie says five to six

296
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,720
years following no no foods but

297
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,920
digestion

298
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,959
has tanked why will this be hard to

299
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,640
digest

300
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,839
so what's going on in your life are you

301
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,079
really stressed out and know that if

302
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:15,040
we're really stressed out our guts

303
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:16,880
don't want to digest properly i mean if

304
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,800
anything's happening any kind of stress

305
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,000
any kind of financial stress any kind of

306
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,120
other stress

307
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,560
anything like that and our digestive

308
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,600
system gets really

309
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,920
really um exhausted from that you know

310
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,200
our nerves our vagus nerve gets affected

311
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,480
so a lot of times when we go through

312
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,720
anything in life

313
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,680
any kind of any kind of trauma any kind

314
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,800
of struggle our

315
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,959
vagus nerve tightens up it tightens up

316
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,320
and our digestive system just has a

317
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:45,760
difficult time

318
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:48,399
um are you eating a lot of grains those

319
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,920
are little actually you know a lot more

320
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,760
difficult to digest

321
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,959
are you eating a lot of meat are you

322
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,600
eating a lot of fat

323
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,720
all that's difficult to digest so is

324
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,839
your

325
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,640
digestive system tanking

326
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,680
because there's any milk cheese butter

327
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,680
ice cream

328
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:11,680
eggs bacon too much chicken too much

329
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:13,600
beef any processed foods at all

330
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,600
any any of that maybe you're eating

331
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,480
really good but you're

332
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,000
you're eating too much avocado um think

333
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,839
you know just i'm trying to help you be

334
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,839
your own detective here

335
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,440
and are you doing chocolate nutritional

336
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,800
yeast are you doing vinegar you're doing

337
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,440
apple cider vinegar are you doing

338
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,120
caffeine

339
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,560
all these things can really tank the

340
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,800
digestive system

341
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,000
and they can tank them over time they

342
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,160
can do that they can

343
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,839
they can tank the digestive tract over

344
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,600
time so if you're doing any kind of

345
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,600
caffeine or chocolate you can tank your

346
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,839
digestive tract because

347
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,800
not only does the chocolate is at high

348
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,640
in fat but

349
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,320
what happens is the caffeine hits the

350
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,680
adrenals really hard and once your

351
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,680
adrenals start to weaken

352
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,839
start to weaken start to weaken

353
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,120
digestion starts to weaken the liver

354
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,040
starts to weaken

355
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,760
because when our adrenals are really

356
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,440
overrun and overtaxed by caffeine

357
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,200
our liver just starts to get overburden

358
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,880
overburden overburden so then the

359
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,160
digestion eventually starts to fall

360
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,760
apart

361
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,480
but really i mean have you tried the

362
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,000
monoeating cleanse

363
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,839
have you tried the mono eating cleanse

364
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,399
have you tried the potato monolithic

365
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,800
cleanse

366
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,240
the banana papaya monolining cleanse

367
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,760
have you tried any of that so that's

368
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,399
what i've always recommended other

369
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,240

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,839
doing it it's starting to work

376
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,600
and and what happens is it's easy on the

377
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,440
digestion it helps you restore your

378
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,360
adrenals back it helps to restore your

379
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,760
digestion

380
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,639
but you might want to consider you might

381
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,720
want to think about

382
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,480
what are you doing like are you doing a

383
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:48,000
lot of fats is that happening

384
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:50,480
are you doing is that going on um

385
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,079
and it's not just the fats it's even

386
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,360
more than that is there vinegar in there

387
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,560
kills the gastric

388
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,000
gastric glands so when we do acetic acid

389
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,680
like apple cider vinegar

390
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,200
even if we do it once every couple of

391
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,639
weeks we basically

392
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:07,760
wipe our stomach lands clean

393
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,800
in a negative way we just we just bash

394
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,880
them we just

395
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,639
wipe them out so they're they're exhaust

396
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,360
they don't have any more gastric juice

397
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,680
because they

398
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,800
they lost it all from the acetic acid so

399
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,680
when we drop down a little bit of

400
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,760
vinegar

401
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,040
a little bit acetic acid our stomach

402
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,279
glands they just

403
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,480
spill their guts they smell everything

404
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,880
they have left

405
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,639
and and then they're just done that's

406
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,079
acetic acid it does say i'll just have

407
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,040
some apple cider vinegar here let me

408
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,279
just

409
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,959
let me just do some apple cider vinegar

410
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,720
and meanwhile

411
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,480
the stomach glands they're just these

412
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,240
tiny little glands

413
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,920
that produce your stomach acid your

414
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,560
gastric acid these

415
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,160
tiny little glands and when you throw in

416
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,519
that apple cider vinegar

417
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:51,279
they almost explode i mean literally

418
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,440
did not literally almost explode but

419
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:55,600
they do explode every gastric juice they

420
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,600
can possibly muster it up and they just

421
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,120
spill it all out and then they're just

422
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,000
white they're wiped out

423
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,320
and and they sit there wiped out and

424
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,560
then

425
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,399
it takes days to restore and then we do

426
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,440
apple cider vinegar again or vinegar

427
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,480
again

428
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,320
and and it takes a lot of mineral salts

429
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,079
are you doing enough celery juice

430
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,079
are you doing celery juice every single

431
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:18,000
day are you restoring

432
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:20,880
those stomach lands and getting them

433
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,959
back so yeah our digestion can get wiped

434
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,680
out it can get wiped out easy if we've

435
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,639
already had

436
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,639
years and years of high fat years and

437
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,600
years of vinegar

438
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:33,279
years and years of caffeine if you did

439
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,360
caffeine 10 years ago

440
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:37,680
and you don't do it anymore and you did

441
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,079
alcohol it's 15 years ago

442
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,440
and you did nutritional yeast that you

443
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,920
did apple cider vinegar

444
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,440
10 years ago and you know and you've

445
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,079
already been on the high fat

446
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,920
year after year who hasn't everybody is

447
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:52,000
the digestive system is going to get rot

448
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,079
wonky wonky wonky wonky and then when

449
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,760
you try to heal it you try to heal it

450
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:57,760
a lot of fats are being used it's like

451
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,800
hey avocado's healthy let me eat that

452
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,880
every single day

453
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,320
let me make avocado toast hey nut

454
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,320
butters are healthy let me do

455
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,079
lots of nut butter let me do almond milk

456
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,199
all that almond milk all the oat milk

457
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,760
right

458
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:11,440
and then our finally everything just

459
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,000
goes

460
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,240
done everybody's like done just

461
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,800
exhausted your liver is exhausted

462
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:21,839
adrenals are exhausted stomach glands

463
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:25,199
are exhausted and everything's just

464
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,880
done and that's what happens and then

465
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:30,480
you might have some pathogens going on

466
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,480
you might have some streptococcus

467
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,560
might have a little bit of strep like my

468
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:37,839
little strep

469
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:40,399
model right here there it is

470
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,519
what people don't realize and science

471
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:45,120
research doesn't know

472
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:48,160
is bacteria and viruses

473
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:51,040
there's a little virus right here okay

474
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:54,160
bacteria and viruses eat food so when

475
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,519
you're doing some gluten

476
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,560
when you're doing a little gluten this

477
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:00,399
is a piece of lettuce it's not gluten so

478
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,720
i don't have any gluten in this in this

479
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,000
house but say this is a piece of gluten

480
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,800
right here

481
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
right so it's floating around floating

482
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,480
around it's in your liver

483
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,480
or it's in your bloodstream and you got

484
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,040
that streptococcus oh you don't have

485
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,480
strep

486
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,639
i heard somebody just say they don't

487
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,079
have strep i did

488
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,600
and i didn't hear it myself through my

489
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,880
own ear i heard it from spirit of

490
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,560
compassion

491
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,399
somebody just said spirit of compassion

492
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,720
said that

493
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,680
they don't have strep so this is a waste

494
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,160
of their time

495
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,519
that's what spirit just said to me um i

496
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,360
should probably tell you guys more about

497
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,639
what spirit says to me as i got to do

498
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,639
all these lives it's actually really

499
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:39,199
hard um

500
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,519
but guess what you do have strep if you

501
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:44,320
had strep throat when you were a kid

502
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,480
you got strep got acne you got strep if

503
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,720
you ever had a uti

504
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,560
yeast infection you got strep any kind

505
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,079
of chronic sinusitis you got strep

506
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,000
everybody's got strep even if the

507
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:56,399
symptoms don't come out

508
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,279
uh bladder infection kidney infection

509
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,160
whatever

510
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,480
and is that gluten swimming around in

511
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,600
you

512
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,000
right that strep bacteria likes to

513
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,160
gobble

514
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,480
it up i don't know if this can actually

515
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:11,120
and it just it absorbs it right up

516
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,400
it absorbs it through the membrane the

517
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,360
gluten went right in there how do you

518
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,880
like that

519
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,559
the strep bacteria just absorb the

520
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,120
gluten wow

521
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,559
and munching that right up munching that

522
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,280
right up right and then all of a sudden

523
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:25,280
that streptococcus gets nice and strong

524
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,199
nice and strong and then it goes up into

525
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,200
the derma a little bit higher and all of

526
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,960
a sudden whoa i got cystic acne now

527
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,520
i just broke out with a little cystic

528
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,080
acne here a little cystic acne here acne

529
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,600
here

530
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,039
and that's because of strep but guess

531
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,720
what the doctor's going to tell you

532
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,360
you're hormonal and that's why you broke

533
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,600
out with your

534
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,200
with your acne because they don't know

535
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,120
it's streptococcus they'll think it's

536
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,559
hormones because they blame everybody on

537
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,200
hormones everything's on hormones

538
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:51,120
hormones hormones

539
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,880
and but what happens is if you're going

540
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,440
through a period of time where you're

541
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,360
actually

542
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,240
are hormonal in a sense for your cycle

543
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,400
or menstruation or anything like that

544
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,840
you your immune systems drop so when

545
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,720
your immune systems drop the strep can

546
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,160
get stronger

547
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,240
that does happen but it's not the

548
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,600
hormones causing it it's not how it

549
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,919
works

550
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,960
cystic acne isn't something that for

551
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,000
centuries

552
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:17,360
women had this is new acne

553
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,160
is actually new so you mean to tell me

554
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,200
all those hundreds of years women didn't

555
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,960
have hormones

556
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,120
did women just develop hormones in the

557
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,240
last 60 years because i'm confused about

558
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,919
that one

559
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,360
did women just develop hormones in the

560
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:33,280
last 80 years

561
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:37,760

that bacteria loves to eat

566
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,840
viruses love to eat got a little bit of

there's over 30 there's over 30

570
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,760
varieties of shingles there's over 60

571
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:04,480
varieties of epstein barr

00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,640
and there's and there's over 50 groups

00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,840
and everybody's passing them around

576
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,600

579
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,120
sore

580
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,720
i said what you've been doing i don't

581
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,840
know i don't know why i have this i

582
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,440
don't know what's going on and

583
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,720
what's happening did you meet anybody

584
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:31,039
yeah i'm dating this new person

585
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,520
i said you are yeah dating this new

586
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:36,000
person and

587
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,039
doing a lot of kissing i'm like okay

588
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,760
well

589
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:41,120
did it come on after that yeah it did

590
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,240
well i think you need to clean up that

591
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,039
strap

592
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,880
i think you picked up a new strip you

593
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:48,320
know um

594
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,760
you can pick them up from the public

595
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,520
bathrooms you can pick them up from the

596
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,880
public toilets you can pick them up from

597
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,960
restaurants

598
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,720
i mean people get more probably the most

599
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,559
strep comes from

600
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,760
relationships and the and then i'd

601
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:02,799
probably say the second

602
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:06,320
is public places like restaurants

603
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:08,559
people prepping your food um

604
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,919
just strap just go strap just drips off

605
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:12,720
of people's heads

606
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,559
chefs in the kitchen they're just the

607
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,080
kitchens are 100 degrees in a lot of

608
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:19,039
these restaurants and

609
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:21,120
sweat is dripping off their temples with

610
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,600
strep in it and dropping in everybody's

611
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,200
food

612
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,640
here you go you got your you got your

613
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,480
salad here it is

614
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,960
get it to the table as fast as possible

615
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,320
ring that bell

616
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:34,720
are you guys i'm steaming up some

617
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:37,360
asparagus and brussels sprouts

618
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,600
jennifer can you tell me about oxalates

619
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:43,039
my friend says they are in plants

620
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:45,919
fruit that makes her sick

621
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:47,360
well may as well just quit all fruits

622
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,440
and vegetables

623
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,559
never eat any fruits and vegetables ever

624
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,080
again and then you'll end up on the

625
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:56,159
carnivore diet where it's just

626
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:58,080
meat and uh my god

627
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,600
then you'll just age really fast because

628
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,799
there's no antioxidants there's no

629
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,080
anything

630
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,559
so i'll give you a little rundown on

631
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:06,960
oxalates oxalates is a theory

632
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,840
it's a theory with no science behind it

633
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,440
so

634
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,120
that's one of the problems with all the

635
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,480
theories

636
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:17,120
is they get everybody in trouble um

637
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,720
there's no real scientific study since

638
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,320
everybody wants a study hey everybody

639
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,159
wants to study here study there's no

640
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,880
scientific study that actually has shown

641
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,799
or proven

642
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:28,960
in any way on any level that an oxalate

643
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,960
causes any kind of issues with someone's

644
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,440
health not even possible

645
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,799
they haven't even found a link they

646
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,919
haven't even found

647
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:40,320
once there's not one study that can show

648
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,080
someone getting oxalates from some kind

649
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,880
of food and having a problem it doesn't

650
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,720
exist

651
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:48,880
so it's a theory number one number two

652
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,840
um oxalates yeah they don't cause a

653
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:54,080
problem

654
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:55,919
um but and it oxalates and fruits and

655
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,520
vegetables don't cause a problem

656
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,960
but you know what happens is when you're

657
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,360
really sick or you're you're

658
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,039
you're you you're really toxic and you

659
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,960
eat some fruits you eat some

660
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,720
leafy greens you eat some vegetables

661
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,080
you're gonna start cleansing possibly if

662
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,120
you're really toxic and your liver is

663
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,640
really toxic

664
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,600
and you might experience something but

665
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:16,240
yet if you gobble down some eggs

666
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,760
the eggs just turn to glue and they seem

667
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,760
like they go fine they seem like they

668
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,840
work fine you eat some eggs it's like

669
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,440
it's just turns into this gluey glop

670
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,400
that sits in the middle of your stomach

671
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,760
and

672
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,400
sits in the middle of your digestive

673
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:31,600
system and finds its way down over time

674
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,760
and that gluey glop feels kind of easy

675
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,760
and comforting and feels all right but

676
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,240
when you're really toxic

677
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,760
and you're you're you know you're eating

678
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,120
you're eating arugula look at this

679
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,679
beautiful arugula right here you're

680
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,840
eating

681
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,679
butter leaf lettuce every day and you're

682
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:49,440
really toxic and you're eating

683
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:50,960
you're eating basil it's antiviral

684
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,919
antibacterial compounds you're eating

685
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,440
basil

686
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:56,720
you're going to start cleaning some

687
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:59,039
stuff up you you have some onion which

688
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,080
you're gonna get that sulfur that kills

689
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,640
bugs

690
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,159
and you're doing your lemons right and

691
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,840
you're cleansing your liver

692
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:07,440
you're gonna start feeling something if

693
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,760
you're really really toxic and you know

694
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,320
what if somebody put a spook in your

695
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,880
head

696
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,080
like oh it's oxalates that's what's

697
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,720
going on

698
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:19,200
meanwhile the funniest thing is the

699
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,400
oxalate theory comes from people

700
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,520
that the people they don't even know

701
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,799
what's wrong with people they don't even

702
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,159
know why people are sick they don't know

703
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,600
why people have hashimoto's they don't

704
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,960
know why people are sick with anything

705
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,640
they don't know why people have any

706
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,679
conditions

707
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,520
and so why is everybody an expert

708
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:36,799
why is everybody an expert about things

709
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:39,679
like oxalates and leptins

710
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:41,039
come on you're an expert you don't know

711
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,400
why people are sick

712
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:45,520
oh they're sick because of processed

713
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:47,039
foods oh that's that's that's

714
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,720
sick from processed foods that's why

715
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,159
they're sick

716
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,600
there's a lot of 80 year olds eating

717
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,640
processed foods their whole life they

718
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,120
ain't sick

719
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,400
somehow there's 85 year olds 89 year

720
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,919
olds eating gluten their whole life

721
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,279
they're not sick you know why

722
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,640
gluten makes somebody else sick and

723
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,360
doesn't make somebody else sick it's

724
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,200
because

725
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,279
the 89 year old didn't have all those

726
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,679
bugs all the streps and all the epstein

727
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:11,200
bars and all the shingles and hhv-6s and

728
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:14,799
h8v7s and simplex ones and simplex twos

729
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:16,960
they didn't have all those so

730
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:18,799
it's not lectins it's not oxalates

731
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,559
there's real reasons why people are sick

732
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,640
i love these theories that just co

733
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:24,080
i don't know it's just incredible really

734
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,440
i guess everybody has to play guessing

735
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,919
games when they don't know why anybody's

736
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,919
sick

737
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:29,840
so it just goes around and then they'll

738
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,760
blame it on jeans

739
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,440
blame it on jeans blame it on the body

740
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,760
attacking itself so all our genes went

741
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,760
bad

742
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,840
or your jeans are bad now your child's

743
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,320
jeans are bad now your kids jeans are

744
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,420
bad

745
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:45,360
all our genes went bad in 20 years

746
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:46,880
[Laughter]

747
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,679
thousands of years ago by it all our

748
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,679
genes went bad

749
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,200
it's unbelievable

750
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,760
i think i just saw a question was it a

751
00:24:55,279 --> 00:25:00,880
bone marrow question

752
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:04,240
what about bone marrow failure

753
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:06,000
amanda you know i've given a lot of

754
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,080
information about that too

755
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,679
a couple of different a couple of

756
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,600
different clinics medical clinics over

757
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:13,200
the years i used to lecture a lot

758
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,880
and see a lot of doctor friends and

759
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,080
medical clinics and stuff and

760
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,240
and i used to tell them it's always the

761
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:21,279
toxic heavy metals so

762
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:24,400
uh bone marrow failure is

763
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:26,640
it's mercury it's aluminum inside

764
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,440
the bones a lot of mercury inside the

765
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,279
bones

766
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,279
a little bit of lead inside the bones

767
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,440
that's where we get in trouble a lot of

768
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:38,400
fluoride inside the bones a lot of

769
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:43,840
fluoride inside the bones

770
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,840
all right so i'm steaming these up

771
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,480
anyway so you guys what to avoid well

772
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:50,799
i'd stay away from gluten

773
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,640
right some of you guys are probably like

774
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,559
that's a no-brainer

775
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,080
you know but everybody just seems to run

776
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,600
back to it they're back on it

777
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,520
one way or another they're doing gluten

778
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,960
again and the reason why i think is

779
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,600
because they just don't know really what

780
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,039
happens and

781
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,880
like i was showing you before gluten

782
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:06,159
feeds every bug there is inside of her

783
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,360
body

784
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:13,120
esther says why do younger

785
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,120
people have these bugs

786
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:20,480
there's a lot more aggressive bugs than

787
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:22,480
ever before mutated strains

788
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,039
they get passed around a lot more now

789
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:28,320
than they ever did in the past

790
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:30,000
um you know that that's

791
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,360
that's that's how it goes the bugs have

792
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,440
mutated

793
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:37,520
they're more they're more uh virulent

794
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,840
so that's another thing too spreads so

795
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,840
much easier

796
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,600
years and years and years ago the first

797
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,360
couple of epstein bars the first few

798
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,840
epstein bars over the years didn't

799
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:50,400
really spread so easy

800
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:52,480
but they also manufactured a lot of new

801
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,120
bugs so they manufactured a lot of new

802
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:57,279
bugs

803
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,279
so the private medical system

804
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,120
um it's a little virus right here a

805
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,000
little little epstein-barr to show you

806
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,159
guys

807
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,640
the private medical industry

808
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:09,440
manufactured a lot of new bugs

809
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,120
and they've been released and these new

810
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:15,039
bugs have been released

811
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:18,480
in the last probably 40 years

812
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:21,200
they've been raised on eggs so

813
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,120
pretend this is an egg when you got a

814
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,000
little bit of egg matter floating around

815
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,520
in your body

816
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,039
and you got the epstein-barr virus

817
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,200
especially a mutated one

818
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:30,880
one of the newer strains you're gonna go

819
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,200
in and eat that egg

820
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,480
there you go and the egg's gone it's in

821
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,279
the virus

822
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,919
the virus multiplies easier so why are

823
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,000
people

824
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:41,120
why are younger people sicker now with

825
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,039
pathogens

826
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:46,799
is because just in the last 30 40 years

827
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:48,320
they really let out a lot of them the

828
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,919
private medical industry really let out

829
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,080
a lot of new epstein bars a lot of

830
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,760
mutated versions also

831
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,760
when they go from person to person to

832
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,600
person as the years go by

833
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,440
they mutate and they become a little bit

834
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,720
more virulent a little bit more virulent

835
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,440
a little more virulent

836
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,120
they spread easy too in restaurants not

837
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,720
as easy as they did years ago i mean

838
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,399
much more easier than they did years ago

839
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,919
in restaurants

840
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:11,520
there's a lot of reasons these are just

841
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,200
some of them

842
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,360
now we have toxins like we never had

843
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,960
before we have so many toxins and

844
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,120
chemicals and pollutions and

845
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,200
we got not just pollution we're talking

846
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,960
about air fresheners and

847
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,399
and scented candles drop the immune

848
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,679
system so we're losing our immune

849
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:28,000
systems now too

850
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:30,240
so the younger people are sicker than

851
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,240
ever before with viruses and bacteria

852
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,880
epstein bars and shingles because their

853
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:38,559
immune systems are dropping

854
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,559
more so than ever before in our history

855
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,679
because they've never been exposed to

856
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,880
the chemical companies to the degree

857
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:46,399
they are so

858
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:48,240
children now are eating chemicals 24 7.

859
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:49,600
they're they're eating scented candles

860
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,880
it's just breathing it in it's going in

861
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,760
their mouth they're eating air

862
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,320
fresheners

863
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,120
colognes perfumes aftershaves the worst

864
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,640
thing to have

865
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:01,919
in the house dad throws on some

866
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:04,000
aftershave and hugs hugs his child and

867
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,360
that aftershave is so toxic and immune

868
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,039
system lowering

869
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,960
so these this is just this you know we

870
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:10,399
have the toxins we have now and the

871
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,080
heavy metals now too

872
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:13,279
that are in all of this and in the

873
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,760
pesticides the herbicides they're

874
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:17,360
spraying

875
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:21,200
more mosquito spray for no reason

876
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:23,679
more mosquito spray more um

877
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,720
west nile spray more fungicide on

878
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:28,159
highways

879
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,600
more herbicide in parks than ever before

880
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:31,440
in our history

881
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,880
it's fire retardant all over people's

882
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,919
beds all over clothing

883
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,600
fire retardant on couches it's all about

884
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:39,039
killing our immune system so chemical

885
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,120
companies want to destroy our immune

886
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:44,000
systems apparently

887
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:45,840
and then you have more violent strains

888
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,520
of epstein-barr more mutated versions

889
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,080
more mutated versions of shingles more

890
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:53,200
mutated versions of hhv-6 h827

891
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,080
off the chart the simplex simplex won

892
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,120
the cold sore

893
00:29:54,080 --> 00:30:00,159
everybody has that there's like

894
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:02,159
there's a dozen of those now easy dozen

895
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:05,360
of those mutated now not everybody's

896
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:08,640
simplex is the same simplex i remember

897
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:10,159
i remember uh years ago somebody come in

898
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,520
to me for help

899
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:15,120
and they had a simplex they they went on

900
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,600
a date and

901
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,399
you know after the date they had a

902
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,440
simplex

903
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:24,000
on their tongue and

904
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:26,480
it never went away it just it was a

905
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,919
mutated version it stayed there

906
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:32,640
it stayed there for like ever and they

907
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:34,000
asked the other person did they have

908
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,600
anything like that because they were

909
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,520
like where did this and the other person

910
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,960
said yeah i didn't disclose it to you

911
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,960
and i didn't tell you but

912
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:44,080
i've had that on my tongue too for like

913
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,080
the last 20 years

914
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:49,360
anyway and those cold sores when they do

915
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,720
go away on people

916
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,000
they're still in your system they go in

917
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,520
the trigeminal nerve they cause

918
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,440
trigeminal neuralgia a little bit

919
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,880
shingles does too but it causes problems

920
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,840
what i'm saying is we need to do things

921
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,600
about it we can

922
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:03,200
we can clean this stuff up it's nothing

923
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,480
it's not about being you know you don't

924
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,159
you don't have to be afraid of bugs

925
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,000
that's not it you just you just clean

926
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:10,720
them up and you don't feed them

927
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,120
you don't feed them eggs that's an egg

928
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,880
yolk

929
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,880
it's not an egg yolk but you don't feed

930
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,039
them you don't feed them eggs you don't

931
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:20,159
feed them gluten you don't feed them

932
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:23,600
milk cheese and butter

933
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:25,279
and you can you can clean them up

934
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,640
some are harder to deal with some are a

935
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:28,240
little bit stronger some have

936
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,600
a little bit more mutated some are a

937
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,120
little bit more aggressive some people

938
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,880
have more toxic heavy metals in their

939
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,559
system some people have more

940
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,240
toxins in their system some people have

941
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,120
lowered immune systems because of these

942
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,080
things

943
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:41,600
and it's a little bit harder but yes you

944
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,480
don't have to fear anything you just

945
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,720
have to get better

946
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,080
do the right stuff and get it out of

947
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,559
your system clean up

948
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,679
knock the stuff out kill it off is what

949
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:51,200
you do

950
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,880
and you kill it off you knock it out of

951
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,200
your system and you move forward and you

952
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,200
heal

953
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,840
um

954
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,000

sprouts

964
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:24,320
they're just about done i'm making a

965
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,720
salad i'm gonna cut up some potatoes now

966
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,720
i'm gonna do that

967
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,480
i'm doing the arugula potato asparagus

968
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:34,640
salad if you guys just came on

969
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:37,679
um is it right there

970
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:40,840
medical medium new addition

971
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:43,200
and that's that's what i'm making right

972
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:45,679
now

973
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,640
incredible having you guys here now what

974
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:48,880
i'm doing is

975
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,399
when i'm what i like to do in a pan is i

976
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,320
like to steam these up in a pan

977
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:54,240
and only put a little bit of water so

978
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,440
the water eventually goes away

979
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,360
and then they kind of get a little

980
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,120
toasty in here so that when they go on

981
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,880
the salad they're not going on the salad

982
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:03,360
dripping wet with water

983
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,880
right that's the way i like to do it

984
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,880
instead they're like getting nice and

985
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,640
toasty now i got the pan on high

986
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,000
the water's already been evaporated

987
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:13,039
they've already done some

988
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,640
steaming in the pan

989
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:15,919
and now they're getting a little toasty

990
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,559
there's still some moisture in the pan

991
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:20,559
so i really like it that way

992
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:25,840
so let me start making a salad let me

993
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:25,840
get some greens together in a bowl

994
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,120
i'm going to chop up some butter leaf

995
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:31,120
lettuce let me show you what i got you

996
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:33,679
guys

997
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:35,200
some butter leaf right here on the other

998
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:39,840
side i have arugula

999
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,840
i'm going to chop up a little bit

1000
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:52,320
i see my neighbors spraying the local

1001
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,840
council spraying around parks and rivers

1002
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,679
and they aren't even wearing mask or

1003
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,519
gloves people children and animals are

1004
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:58,640
all around them it makes me so angry

1005
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:02,480
yeah

1006
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:04,159
did you know and i've seen this

1007
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:07,919
did you know what's on the barrels of

1008
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:10,000
that stuff it's a skull and crossbones

1009
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:13,440
skull and crossbones did you know the

1010
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,599
guys that handle the barrels of chemical

1011
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,520
that actually eventually gets diluted

1012
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:19,119
and put into you know sprayed and put

1013
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:22,720
into parks and all that

1014
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:24,720
that same chemical they die really young

1015
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,839
it's a job you only have for like 20

1016
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:29,760
years and then you're done

1017
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:29,760
you're done it's horrible

1018
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,720
you know i i've seen photographs of

1019
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:37,919
those barrels

1020
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:37,919
skull and crossbones

1021
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,839
i mean seriously skull crossbones on

1022
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:46,079
those barrels

1023
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:47,679
i'm not kidding and guess what

1024
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:49,839
chemical companies want your babies to

1025
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:52,000
have it all over them in the park

1026
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:54,159
they want your babies to have it all

1027
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,440
children

1028
00:34:54,159 --> 00:35:01,520
chemical companies i truly believe

1029
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,000
want people poisoned why else would they

1030
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,920
put their

1031
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:10,240
deadly chemicals in parks and why

1032
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:12,400
would counties and states and

1033
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:14,560
villages and wherever you live around

1034
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:17,520
the world

1035
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:20,240
why would they let that happen can

1036
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,240
someone tell me

1037
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:25,440
[Music]

1038
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,440
because i've always said it's a sick

1039
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:34,800
world

1040
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:36,880
see money says viruses can't live in

1041
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:40,240
carnivore blood that's why the carnivore

1042
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,240
diet works for autoimmune

1043
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:51,359
well so if you're on a carnivore diet

1044
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:53,680
wait viruses can't live in carnivore

1045
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:55,680
blood does that mean that okay so while

1046
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:59,839
you're on the carnivore diet i get it

1047
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:59,839
i get it um

1048
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,560
this is not true viruses feed off of

1049
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,520
toxic heavy metals and when you're a

1050
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,040
carnivore

1051
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,400
you're not eating any foods when you're

1052
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,680
doing the carnivore diet you're not any

1053
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,040
eating any of the foods to get the

1054
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,800
metals out

1055
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,640
so all your metals are sitting inside of

1056
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,839
you and the viruses will feed on the

1057
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,560
metals

1058
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:19,200
yeah i i give you this though i give you

1059
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,560
this

1060
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,280
you're not eating well you might be

1061
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:25,040
eating eggs if you're doing eggs on a

1062
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,400
carnivore diet you're feeding the heck

1063
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:30,880
out of those viruses

1064
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:32,560
big time if you're doing raw cheese on

1065
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,240
that carnivore diet you're feeding those

1066
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,440
viruses

1067
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,760
just say if you're doing eggs you're

1068
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:42,400
feeding the viruses okay

1069
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:45,040
right there now if your carnivore diet

1070
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:47,760
is corn fed

1071
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:49,440
it's corn fed you're feeding the viruses

1072
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,800
with the meat you're eating

1073
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,200
make sure none of your meat you're

1074
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:56,800
eating in a carnivore diet is corn fed

1075
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:58,560
okay and um but yeah i get it you

1076
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,160
removed your gluten you removed your

1077
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,680
milk cheese butter probably

1078
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,280
uh if you're doing the butter you're

1079
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,800
feeding your viruses so you

1080
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,400
i know people on a carnivore diet

1081
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,520
they're doing butter you're feeding the

1082
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,359
viruses they're doing eggs

1083
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,440
feeding viruses if you're only doing

1084
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:14,400
meat and meat only and you're eating

1085
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,680
just the animal flesh and that's it

1086
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:19,280
you're still going to have toxic heavy

1087
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,280
metals feeding the viruses in there

1088
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:22,320
and then you end up getting symptoms

1089
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,599
later so you can be on your carnivore

1090
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,520
diet doing okay and then you get

1091
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:27,520
symptoms later it happens all the time

1092
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,960
because eventually the viruses will

1093
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,240
still feed

1094
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,839
and here's the other thing too if you're

1095
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,119
on a carnivore diet and you're not doing

1096
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:34,400
any fruits and vegetables

1097
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:35,599
and you're not cleaning up the liver

1098
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,440
your liver is just going to get more

1099
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:38,960
beaten down more beating down more fatty

1100
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,160
more fatty and then more fat building up

1101
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,160
in your liver and

1102
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,839
your fat the fat builds so much in your

1103
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,280
liver that you end up having a problem

1104
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:46,720
and then boom you're

1105
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:50,560
you're sick anyway with other problems

1106
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:52,079
you got gout

1107
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,280
and then if you're on a high fat diet

1108
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:54,000
non-stop because you're just on

1109
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,280
carnivore

1110
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,119
so you're eating the high-fat diet

1111
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,079
non-stop you're burning out the adrenals

1112
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:59,520
over time you're going to get some

1113
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,800
adrenal fatigue and you're going to

1114
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:03,440
end up binging on some kind of

1115
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,200
carbohydrate

1116
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,359
i'm not ranking on the carnivore diet

1117
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,880
i'm just saying that

1118
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:10,720
you don't have a free pass on a

1119
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:13,359
carnivore diet

1120
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:14,480
i look you don't have a free pass on a

1121
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:17,200
vegan diet

1122
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,960
plant-based diet animal protein diet

1123
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,880
there's no free pass on any of it

1124
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,640
because if you're doing all these fats

1125
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,760
on a plant-based diet here so you don't

1126
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,880
have a free ticket if you're doing all

1127
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,760
this vinegar you don't have a free

1128
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,880
ticket

1129
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,760
if you're doing all this nutritional

1130
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,880
yeast you don't have a free ticket if

1131
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,160
you're doing all this caffeine you don't

1132
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,359
have a free ticket no one has a free

1133
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,160
ticket and they realize they really

1134
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:34,240
really

1135
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:37,040
really avoid everything and then clean

1136
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,040
up what's happening

1137
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:43,760
chopped up some arugula right here you

1138
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:46,800

1139
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:48,400
but i i want to

1140
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,480
i don't care what diet you're on i don't

1141
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,640
care if a martian

1142
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,000
arrived on your back porch on a little

1143
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,160
spaceship

1144
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,560
and gave you a brand new diet from outer

1145
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,560
space

1146
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,760
if you don't know why you're sick or

1148
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,920
it's not going to be enough it's just

1149
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,359
not going to be enough you have to know

1150
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,160
what the cause of your problem is your

1151
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:10,320

why you're sick you have to that's a big

1153
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,280
part of it

um so i'm gonna start putting some other

1157
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:24,000
i'm gonna start cutting an onion

1158
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,560
let's do that bev asked what oils do you

1159
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,240
cook with

1160
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:28,240
none nada

1161
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:33,119
[Music]

1162
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:36,079
don't need to just a little bit of water

1163
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:38,000
you don't have to cook in oils

1164
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:39,520
you know that whole rule of cooking with

1165
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,240
oils

1166
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:44,000
is really not necessary these are fat

1167
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,520
free meals so that you can get a break

1168
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,880
and your liver can get a break once in a

1169
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:50,480
while so you can just take a break i'm

1170
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,480
gonna slice up this onion right here

1171
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:58,240
um you can do white onion

1172
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:00,079
i like red onion too so i'll do red

1173
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:06,000
here's a white one right here too

1174
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:06,000
um but i'm gonna cut these nice and thin

1175
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:12,960
so i like keeping these fat free

1176
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,800
that's what i like to do because there's

1177
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,280
but there's fats like i said earlier i

1178
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,800
said i

1179
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,240
think i said earlier there's fats in

1180
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,680

1181
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:21,920

i'm gonna cut these up

1190
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:53,760
is there a test for viral issues

1191
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:55,520
mean there's some basic tests you can

1192
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,680
see if you have a

1193
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:59,839
infection of epstein-barr see if you

1194
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:02,960
have some epstein-barr titers

1195
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:06,160
but to be honest

1196
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:07,760
they don't know what viruses do

1197
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,280
and just so you know there before

1198
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:12,000
medical medium books were published and

1199
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:14,480
medical medium information came out

1200
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,079
um they didn't even know epstein-barr

1201
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,640
had a afterlife

1202
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:20,319
epstein barr has an afterlife causes

1203
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:23,839

1205
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:30,079
uh lupus causes lyme disease

1206
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:34,160
they didn't know that you know

1207
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:36,400
epstein-barr had an afterlife

1208
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,359
and the publication of this book the

1209
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,960
first edition

1210
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:41,040
the publication is first edition that

1211
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,359
came out years ago

1212
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:45,200
uh busted out the truth about what

1213
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:46,240
epstein-barr does and everything and how

1214
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,400
you can get the

1215
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,760
reactivation you can get you know the

1216
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,560
virus comes back

1217
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:54,000
comes out of dormancy again and sits

1218
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,520
inside your liver and all this stuff now

1219
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,359
science research is actually taking it

1220
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:59,200
seriously years later after i've already

1221
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:03,040
published the information

1222
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:05,520
and so it's interesting

1223
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:06,800
but they didn't even know they had no

1224
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,480
clue

1225
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,400
you know they thought epstein-barr was

1226
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,560
just mono when it went away and that's

1227
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,560
it

1228
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:18,240

so you adrenal surges all day long right

1297
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,359
you bump your head on the cupboard and

1298
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,079
you're like oh my god is this a

1299
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:54,079
concussion

1300
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:56,000
this really hurts i feel an egg growing

1301
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:57,520
on my head i got to get some ice

1302
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,040
should i run to the doctor should i call

1303
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,319
the emergency room you get your adrenals

1304
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:02,800
are surging

1305
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:04,079
it's just it's non-stop right so i'm

1306
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,839
just saying so and then

1307
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:07,920
the caffeine that's a big one right

1308
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:08,960
there that's that's every time you do

1309
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,760
caffeine

1310
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:13,680
you just put caffeine in your system and

1311
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:16,240
the surges don't stop

1312
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,960
they don't stop you guys you eat some

1313
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,359
chocolate

1314
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,800
those surges don't stop that's like you

1315
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:22,800
know if your package

1316
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:24,400
wasn't stolen or you've lost your wallet

1317
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,920
for five minutes and you found it your

1318
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:29,520
surges stop

1319
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:30,720
right but man caffeine it's got this

1320
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,400
evil twist to it

1321
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:34,160
once you get it in your system your

1322
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,119
adrenals have no choice they're sitting

1323
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,640
there panting

1324
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:38,319
they're panting they're surging they're

1325
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,960
surging they're surging you can't stop

1326
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:42,000
it

1327
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:43,920
it's just it'll surge for a day if

1328
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,119
caffeine will make them search for three

1329
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,800
days

1330
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:49,359
it just it'll make them search a little

1331
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:51,359
less when you're when it's wearing out

1332
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:52,720
but they'll still be surging it's like

1333
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:54,400
people live their life with their

1334
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:57,839
adrenal surging

1335
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:59,280
forced by caffeine and i think they're

1336
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:00,319
getting energy from caffeine i'm gonna

1337
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:02,240
put some um

1338
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:04,000
basil on here i got this beautiful basil

1339
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:06,000
leaves right here

1340
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,760
and what's really happening though is

1341
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,280
their adrenals are just

1342
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:14,800
just getting beat to crap really are

1343
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:17,040
from from from the caffeine

1344
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:19,440
so that surges them right there that's a

1345
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:23,040
big deal and then the high fat diets

1346
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:26,160
this meal right here won't surge

1347
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:29,200
it won't surge cause adrenal surge

1348
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:31,440
this meal won't it just can't there's

1349
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:32,960
if you dropped two tablespoons of olive

1350
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:36,000
oil on here

1351
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:37,599
and threw some pine nuts on here right

1352
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,280
tastes amazing probably right threw some

1353
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:41,200
tahini on here

1354
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:43,440
all that fat would then start thickening

1355
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:44,960
your blood right when it gets to what

1356
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,800
right when you eat it it gets down in

1357
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,400
here and now it starts to surge

1358
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:50,240
the adrenals start to surge because the

1359
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,920
fat is starting to absorb into your

1360
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:53,359
bloodstream and once the fat starts to

1361
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,880
absorb into your bloodstream

1362
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:56,560
your adrenals have to release all this

1363
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:59,200
epinephrine to thin out your blood so

1364
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:59,200
your heart

1365
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:02,480
so your heart doesn't have to pump so

1366
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:05,119
hard

1367
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:06,240
all that fat you put in it just makes

1368
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:09,119
your heart pump so

1369
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,680
i get it it's okay to have some tahini

1370
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:12,000
i'm not

1371
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:14,079
anti-tahini i'm not anti-hemp seeds

1372
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:17,280
anti-peanut buttery anti

1373
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:20,480
almond butter i'm not anti pine nuts

1374
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:22,319
i'm not anti avocado i'm not anti oils

1375
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:23,920
and if you love animal protein

1376
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:26,079
i support you but what what i'm trying

1377
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:29,200
to say is we don't stop

1378
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:31,760
no one gets a break it's 24

1379
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:34,240
7 it's fats fats fats fats fats every

1380
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,520
single day and no one gets a day off

1381
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:37,280
your liver doesn't get a day off your

1382
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:40,319
adrenals don't get your day off

1383
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:42,319
your heart doesn't get a day off i mean

1384
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:44,880
i mean seriously your heart is up

1385
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:48,400
against that non-stop

1386
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:51,040
so nothing gets a break so it's like

1387
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:53,119
more fat hey more avocado oh the next

1388
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:55,359
day comes peanut butter and my oatmeal

1389
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:56,319
next day comes olive oil on my salad

1390
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:58,800
next day comes

1391
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:59,839
lots of chicken at night it's it doesn't

1392
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,880
stop

1393
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:03,520
pork chicken beef milk cheese butter

1394
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,520
eggs

1395
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:07,280
let me have an egg well there we go lots

1396
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:10,319
of fat again it just doesn't stop

1397
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:12,720
so then your heart is like it just

1398
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:15,119
doesn't stop and your heart has to pump

1399
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:16,880
it has to literally pump all that fat

1400
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:17,680
through and your adrenals have to thin

1401
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:20,319
out the blood

1402
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:21,040
it's just and then the plaque builds up

1403
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:22,559
the plaque

1404
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:24,319
all that plaque later on you're seven

1405
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:26,640
years old you got plaque on the arteries

1406
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:30,160
the veins

1407
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:32,559
veins start collapsing let me put some

1408
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:33,839

00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:35,760

asparagus on here and then the other

1411
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:39,040
thing is toxins absorb in all that fat

1412
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:44,160
every time

1413
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:44,160
uh fat toxins fat soluble

1414
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:49,599

1415
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,440

they don't even know what causes

1442
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:50,800
sickness they're too busy reading matcha

1443
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:52,880
tea studies

1444
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:54,400

paid for by the caffeine industry and

1447
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:00,000

1448
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:01,440
your genes anyway that's why you're sick

1449
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,040

out if they are they're trying to do it

1451
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:06,400

is that they're healing foods but

1471
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:03,200
when you combine healing foods with the

1472
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,240
fact that you remove the foods that are

1473
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:08,800
troublesome

1474
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:11,119

1477
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:17,920
so basically i'm going to use a strainer

1478
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:23,839
so the seeds aren't going in here

1479
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:31,280
a couple tables a tablespoon of lemon is

1480
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:31,280
fine on here

1481
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:37,839
i can't wait to eat this thing

1482
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:40,880
here's the other thing about all the

1483
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:41,920
fats you keep on doing all the fats

1484
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:43,599
every day

1485
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,800
all you do is cause corrosion with the

1486
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:48,000
toxic heavy metals that are in your

1487
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:48,000
brain so let me show you this

1488
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:54,240
so metals are heavy

1489
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:56,160
and they don't just stay in the

1490
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:57,680
bloodstream that's why they can't find

1491
00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:00,480
them no one can really find them

1492
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:02,000
and you get blood tests for it and but

1493
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:03,680
metals are heavy so they sit inside

1494
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,200
organs so they go deep inside organ

1495
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:07,040
tissue this they go deep inside your

1496
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:09,280
brain and that's when the ocd starts the

1497
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:11,119
bipolar starts anxiety depression starts

1498
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:14,559
the personalization starts

1499
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:17,119
schizophrenia starts whatever starts and

1500
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:18,000
um emotional ups and downs that can't be

1501
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:20,160
explained

1502
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,400
all of it so you get the toxic heavy

1503
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:25,200
metals and they sit inside the brain

1504
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:27,119
and um and then you eat all the fat so

1505
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:28,960
gobble down all the pork and the chicken

1506
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:31,280
milk cheese and the butter and the eggs

1507
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:32,240
and the almond butter and all the seeds

1508
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:34,640
and nuts

1509
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:36,640
and the peanut butter and oils and the

1510
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:39,839
coconut oil and what happens is

1511
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:41,760
all that all that fat in the bloodstream

1512
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:43,680
goes around the metal it starts to hit

1513
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:46,720
the metal and then the metal

1514
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:48,480
oxidizes fat causes the metal to oxidize

1515
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:49,680
and then it bleeds over into different

1516
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,559
parts of the brain and different

1517
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,079
different tissue and then your

1518
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:53,200
conditions get worse over time worse

1519
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:54,960
over time

1520
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:56,240
and electrical impulses have a hard time

1521
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:58,839
getting through the metal so it starts

1522
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:01,839
to get shocked in there

1523
00:52:58,839 --> 00:53:01,839
and

1524
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:07,119
so so here's a half a brain

1525
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,240
so on this half of brain you got little

1526
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:14,079
metal deposits see i put these little

1527
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:15,680
deposits here these are big ones so this

1528
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:16,480
is just a demo that's not what it looks

1529
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:18,160
like

1530
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,680
you can't see the microscopic metal in

1531
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,839
brain in the brain

1532
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:23,440
unless it causes so much corrosion over

1533
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:25,359
time or it's a large enough deposit and

1534
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,240
then it causes a gray area gray spot

1535
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:28,240
dark spot

1536
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:30,000
or or some type of crystallization on

1537
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,880
the mri eventually as you as you get

1538
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,319
older

1539
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:34,800
and blood tests aren't accurate for

1540
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:36,559
finding metals and

1541
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,760
here they are so electrical impulses are

1542
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:40,000
firing through your brain they're

1543
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:42,160
hitting the metal deposits and it's like

1544
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,680
it's like what's wrong with you are you

1545
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:45,040
okay today honey

1546
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:47,599
i don't know what's wrong with me i'm

1547
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:49,760
just really pissed off i'm angry and

1548
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:51,440
i don't know i feel really emotional and

1549
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:53,119
is your bipolar back

1550
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,880
uh i don't i don't know i just gotta

1551
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:57,359
leave i gotta get out of here

1552
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:58,960
and what happens is electrical impulses

1553
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:00,559
are just go they're hitting the toxic

1554
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:02,800
heavy metal deposits

1555
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:03,599
and it's like oh my depression is so bad

1556
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,920
today it's

1557
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:07,760
so bad i don't know what it is and

1558
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:09,040
that's corrosion from the toxic heavy

1559
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:11,920
metals moving into

1560
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:13,599
other tissue and my anxiety is through

1561
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:15,359
the roof i feel like it's going to like

1562
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:18,319
give me a panic attack and it's

1563
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:20,240
got me in my gut and it's and i'm

1564
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:22,319
freaking out inside and my anxiety is

1565
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:24,000
out of control and i can't breathe that

1566
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:25,920
my chest is tight

1567
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,319
well that's electrical impulses hitting

1568
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:30,720
all those those metal deposits right

1569
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:32,240
and and alternative medicine they only

1570
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:33,599
know how to get toxic metals out of

1571
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:36,000
people they're just sending people on

1572
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:38,319
wild goose chase with charcoal and

1573
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,599
and collagen and matcha tea i mean it's

1574
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:43,040
it's unbelievable

1575
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:44,559
um and you know and and with with

1576
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,760
anxiety you can have low-grade viral

1577
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:47,200
stuff depression low-grade

1578
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:49,760
vital stuff you gotta have metals it's

1579
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:51,839
always metals metals are always involved

1580
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:53,359
and so and that's that's a problem right

1581
00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:54,799

00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,400
are walking around with all kinds of

1614
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:11,680
different

1615
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:15,200
um issues left and right emotionally
