[213.32 - 218.40] response to it so I'm giving you the
[216.16 - 221.00] prediction right now so it's going to
[218.40 - 222.88] happen there's going to be a huge flip
[221.00 - 225.00] might take a year or two maybe a little
[222.88 - 228.96] longer but a huge flip where people are
[225.00 - 231.16] going to be sick to death of it they are
[228.96 - 234.32] they're going to be sick of it but right
[231.16 - 235.80] now people are getting a high off of it

[235.80 - 239.08] minute like you got to worry about
[237.80 - 240.40] Metals you got to worry about this you
[239.08 - 243.60] got to sound
[240.40 - 245.40] familiar but when medical medium broke
[243.60 - 247.12] all this stuff out there and put this
[245.40 - 248.76] information out there many many years
[247.12 - 250.68] ago and for years I've been fighting for
[248.76 - 252.72] it I was called crazy I was called no
[250.68 - 254.60] way this is lunacy I was called this
[252.72 - 256.16] can't be true how can you be talking
[254.60 - 257.88] about this how is this even possible
[256.16 - 259.52] clones aren't bad for you perfumes

[276.60 - 282.56] running with it but they're leaving out
[278.88 - 284.40] how to protect yourself and how to heal
[282.56 - 286.44] that's what's happening now they leave
[284.40 - 288.64] out how to protect yourself for the most
[286.44 - 290.92] part outside of things they poached but
[288.64 - 292.92] they leave out how to protect yourself

[338.64 - 349.60] good so right now the big thing is Scare
[343.12 - 352.96] Tactics scare people into what what what
[349.60 - 355.92] oh my God I'm GNA die what the sky's
[352.96 - 357.92] falling where where's the fire that is
[355.92 - 360.48] the scare tactic now it's on every
[357.92 - 363.64] Health podcast it's in every article
[360.48 - 365.52] it's every influencer that's the new
[363.64 - 370.68] tactic with
[365.52 - 374.96] no ways of helping people get through it
[370.68 - 376.76] no good answers on how to heal no
[374.96 - 378.00] answers on how to defend yourself
[376.76 - 381.12] protect your family protect your
[378.00 - 383.32] children none of that is there it's just
[381.12 - 385.96] caffeine's bad caffeine's going to kill
[383.32 - 388.08] you medical mem information but you so
[385.96 - 390.20] so many Trends and traps out there
[388.08 - 393.16] instead they throw you in
[390.20 - 396.52] it's like caffeine's bad do this and
[393.16 - 400.76] what they give you sucks this is bad do
[396.52 - 404.04] salt and water that sucks this is this
[400.76 - 407.60] is bad do my do my carnivore packet of
[404.04 - 410.08] protein it's got junk and [ __ ] in it do
[407.60 - 413.60] this is bad then do this it's so that's
[410.08 - 416.68] what's happening right now it's all a
[413.60 - 421.00] method methodology on scaring the [ __ ]
[416.68 - 423.20] out of people scaring them to death then
[421.00 - 426.12] getting them to buy whatever it is
[423.20 - 428.32] they're selling that's the tactic and
[426.12 - 432.36] guess what it's going to get old pretty
[428.32 - 434.96] quick it's already starting to get old
[432.36 - 437.24] but that's the tactic by my program
[434.96 - 438.40] because guess what this is going to
[437.24 - 441.12] happen to you that's going to happen to
[438.40 - 443.12] you so buy my program that's the game
[441.12 - 444.92] the name of the game so I'm letting you
[443.12 - 448.08] guys know that's what's going on out
[444.92 - 451.04] there there's no responsibility to
[448.08 - 453.24] helping a person to actually telling a
[451.04 - 454.96] person here's how you get this out of
[453.24 - 457.64] your body here's how you can protect
[454.96 - 459.92] your child here's how you can help
[457.64 - 462.60] yourself here's what you do to avoid
[459.92 - 464.48] this problem that's not there it's just
[462.60 - 466.92] screaming so right now it's all about
[464.48 - 470.64] screaming as if they all woke up and
[466.92 - 472.88] that's what happened so bottom line is
[470.64 - 475.92] influencers podcast people people in
[472.88 - 478.88] health just woke up the other day that's
[475.92 - 480.96] what happened they woke up they realize
[478.88 - 484.76] the air fresheners that they were just
[480.96 - 487.32] using a year ago just using a year ago
[484.76 - 489.56] is bad so you got these podcast doctors
[487.32 - 491.48] now you got these podcast influencers
[489.56 - 494.64] now in the health movement they were
[491.48 - 498.08] lighting all the scented candles during
[494.64 - 500.68] covid yes during the pandemic they were
[498.08 - 502.24] lighting all the scented candles they
[500.68 - 504.56] were that's what they were doing now
[502.24 - 506.52] they're screaming how bad they are but
[504.56 - 508.32] they were using them they were lighting
[506.52 - 509.88] them they had their air fresheners and
[508.32 - 512.28] all their apartments and all their
[509.88 - 515.80] houses they were cranking the caffeine
[512.28 - 519.00] and the espressos up to here they were
[515.80 - 520.72] they were doing all of this and guess
[519.00 - 524.68] what they were newbies in the health
[520.72 - 527.72] movement just starting just in on with
[524.68 - 529.72] their training wheels brand new they
[527.72 - 531.36] were just basically learning just the
[529.72 - 533.28] other day you don't have those air
[531.36 - 536.88] fresheners they were learning just the
[533.28 - 539.44] other day like last year perfumes might
[536.88 - 541.88] not be good but they were using perfum
[539.44 - 544.80] per fumes 3 years ago 2 years ago 4
[541.88 - 548.28] years ago in
[544.80 - 551.24] fact and in truth if you enter a home of

[558.88 - 563.40] their air freshener I can guarantee you
[561.24 - 565.44] all you smell is air freshener and
[563.40 - 568.16] perfume all in their clothing in their

[816.04 - 821.20] who have given it all way people have
[818.84 - 823.28] done what they could to try to survive
[821.20 - 825.80] they've been to 20 doctors they've tried
[823.28 - 828.68] to heal and they just need to be taught
[825.80 - 830.64] real things that move them forward like
[828.68 - 835.32] a vitamin C shock therapy which is
[830.64 - 837.36] critical or a nerve gut acid stabilizer

[1056.88 - 1061.72] nerve gut acid stabilizer I am have you
[1059.96 - 1062.92] actually tried the nerve gut acid
[1061.72 - 1066.80] stabilizer
[1062.92 - 1069.64] because it's a needle mover I mean it's
[1066.80 - 1074.04] a needle mover man it moves a needle
[1069.64 - 1076.76] it's like the gas moves man it does it's
[1074.04 - 1079.92] like stepping on the gas in your car and
[1076.76 - 1083.80] that thing moves h
[1079.92 - 1085.96] and gas that's stuck in people and and
[1083.80 - 1088.48] people are constipated and problematic
[1085.96 - 1090.76] and their gut is so off the amount of
[1088.48 - 1093.92] microbiome [ __ ] that's for sale out
[1090.76 - 1098.12] there the amount of people selling their
[1093.92 - 1100.32] own microbiome crap stuff just thrown
[1098.12 - 1103.08] together with crap you don't even know
[1100.32 - 1105.64] how it's made unbelievable and all you
[1103.08 - 1107.08] need is the nerve gut stabilizer A's
[1105.64 - 1108.80] having major issues right now A lot of
[1107.08 - 1110.60] people are reporting getting kicked off
[1108.80 - 1112.36] the live streams they won't let people
[1110.60 - 1114.92] on the screen and it's
[1112.36 - 1118.60] freezing and that's what they've done to
[1114.92 - 1120.68] Medical medium we have reached out to ig
[1118.60 - 1122.92] for that and they turn off sound as well
[1120.68 - 1125.00] so if you're even hearing me on IG
[1122.92 - 1126.44] because they've really just I can see
[1125.00 - 1129.12] they kicked at
[1126.44 - 1130.92] least they kicked at least a th000
[1129.12 - 1133.24] people off for sure so they're keeping
[1130.92 - 1134.36] the number somewhere around 400 and
[1133.24 - 1135.32] everybody's reporting how they're
[1134.36 - 1138.36] getting kicked off if you're
[1135.32 - 1142.68] experiencing this please report it to us
[1138.36 - 1146.40] in the D Ms okay so we can use that data
[1142.68 - 1148.80] we can use that data um to help defend
[1146.40 - 1149.56] ourselves from the IG kickoff today
[1148.80 - 1152.00] because that's what they're doing
[1149.56 - 1153.88] they're kicking people off and you know
[1152.00 - 1156.40] it makes sense because somebody you know
[1153.88 - 1158.36] working there probably is really jealous
[1156.40 - 1161.08] as hell about the Cafe Gratitude and
[1158.36 - 1163.16] medical Med medium collaboration and you
[1161.08 - 1165.88] better believe it's happening you know
[1163.16 - 1167.84] or actually um you know leave the
[1165.88 - 1169.84] information if you got any if you if you
[1167.84 - 1171.40] screenshoot it and so forth leave it at
[1169.84 - 1173.88] Medical mem safes
[1171.40 - 1176.76] space.com go to Medical m.com all right
[1173.88 - 1179.64] all right well listen you can go to
[1176.76 - 1181.72] rumble I'm on YouTube live right now
[1179.64 - 1184.16] okay and Rumble all right also
[1181.72 - 1189.44] telegram's happening right now and I got
[1184.16 - 1189.44] Tik Tock up as we speak
[1190.24 - 1195.72] so the amount of
[1192.80 - 1200.48] might might of the amount of microbiome
[1195.72 - 1202.44] stuff is crazy you got like fulvic
[1200.48 - 1205.72] minerals which never fixed anybody I'm
[1202.44 - 1209.32] just going to be honest you got
[1205.72 - 1212.00] sh never fixed anybody it doesn't people
[1209.32 - 1214.96] are chronically ill and they go on that
[1212.00 - 1217.44] they don't get better their skin doesn't
[1214.96 - 1220.64] get better their exan orasis doesn't get
[1217.44 - 1222.36] better when you're on shil it doesn't
[1220.64 - 1224.24] your neurological symptoms tix and

[1231.64 - 1237.68] and ankles and swelling and doesn't get
[1234.64 - 1239.00] better okay your tingles and numbness

[1239.00 - 1242.36] vertigo doesn't get better your
[1240.60 - 1245.76] depression and anxiety don't get better
[1242.36 - 1247.76] you can buy a $50 bottle of chillogy and
[1245.76 - 1249.56] your depression is not going away it's
[1247.76 - 1251.04] not going anywhere and that's how it
[1249.56 - 1254.00] always was
[1251.04 - 1256.44] right and same thing with a
[1254.00 - 1258.68] probiotic your tingles and numbness your
[1256.44 - 1261.48] nerve pain your fatigue your neur
[1258.68 - 1263.84] ological fatigue your dizziness all this
[1261.48 - 1265.52] different stuff doesn't go away doesn't
[1263.84 - 1267.76] go away with a probiotic either I'm
[1265.52 - 1270.24] sorry but it doesn't but what happens is
[1267.76 - 1272.72] in the microbiome world all this stuff
[1270.24 - 1275.84] is thrown together all this different
[1272.72 - 1277.88] stuff you know including like ACV
[1275.84 - 1279.72] gummies and things like that it's all
[1277.88 - 1281.44] just slapped together with a bunch of
[1279.72 - 1284.20] crap in it and there's so many things
[1281.44 - 1287.32] out there for the microbiome world and
[1284.20 - 1290.36] people are still stuck they're stuck so
[1287.32 - 1292.60] stuck so bad that all these dudes tried
[1290.36 - 1294.12] all that and then they went to carnivore
[1292.60 - 1295.52] and I'll talk about that another day and
[1294.12 - 1297.16] then they go to carnivore because it's
[1295.52 - 1298.64] called process elimination where they're
[1297.16 - 1300.56] totally screwed and they don't know what
[1298.64 - 1301.96] to eat anymore they're afraid of this
[1300.56 - 1304.28] afraid of that and they start narrowing
[1301.96 - 1305.92] it down to just meat and meat only they
[1304.28 - 1307.36] tried all the microbiome products they
[1305.92 - 1310.20] tried all the different protein patterns
[1307.36 - 1312.24] they tried everything to do to help
[1310.20 - 1314.64] their gut in some way some fashion some
[1312.24 - 1315.88] shape some form goes nowhere and now
[1314.64 - 1317.28] they're just stuck with a piece of meat
[1315.88 - 1318.64] they realize they're bumping against the
[1317.28 - 1320.08] wall they got nowhere to go with this
[1318.64 - 1322.12] process elimination so now they're
[1320.08 - 1323.72] adding fruit and they're adding honey
[1322.12 - 1325.64] and adding lemon and stuff like that to
[1323.72 - 1329.72] try to crawl out of it so they're just
[1325.64 - 1331.04] going back to a keto diet basically with
[1329.72 - 1334.12] with fruit and
[1331.04 - 1335.84] meat so what I'm trying to say overall
[1334.12 - 1337.76] that's just one example so many other
[1335.84 - 1340.28] examples of people losing their ability
[1337.76 - 1341.44] to eat the things that they want to eat
[1340.28 - 1343.24] and they're stuck they don't know where
[1341.44 - 1345.24] to go they can't eat this lettuce they
[1343.24 - 1346.48] can't eat that they can't eat this herb
[1345.24 - 1349.44] they can't and they're just getting
[1346.48 - 1350.80] knocked down to just basically
[1349.44 - 1353.48] oatmeal all of a sudden they're on
[1350.80 - 1355.48] oatmeal and oatmeal only I'm saying this
[1353.48 - 1357.80] because there are people out there and I
[1355.48 - 1359.60] see that there young influencers out
[1357.80 - 1361.36] there that people bring to my attention
[1359.60 - 1363.48] and say look at this person this
[1361.36 - 1365.76] person's really suffering they're just
[1363.48 - 1368.16] on oatmeal like that's the saddest thing
[1365.76 - 1369.60] I've ever seen only on oatmeal because
[1368.16 - 1372.88] they don't know what to eat know what to
[1369.60 - 1374.52] do know how to heal know how to recover
[1372.88 - 1375.92] and it just gets all taken away from
[1374.52 - 1379.00] them and they don't know what they're
[1375.92 - 1380.84] reacting to and it just goes Boop Bo
[1379.00 - 1383.36] Boop and now they're just on oatmeal and
[1380.84 - 1385.52] that's it plus a microbiome product and
[1383.36 - 1388.28] so forth and everything there's a ton of
[1385.52 - 1389.96] this kind of stuff going on out there
[1388.28 - 1391.96] meanwhile if they only knew medical
[1389.96 - 1395.84] medium information and they knew about
[1391.96 - 1398.32] the nerve gut acid stabilizer okay then
[1395.84 - 1400.32] things can change so what I have in
[1398.32 - 1401.92] front of me right here is nerve gut acid
[1400.32 - 1404.48] stabilizer so I'm going to show you
[1401.92 - 1407.80] right here if they only knew about these
[1404.48 - 1409.92] things life could be so different when
[1407.80 - 1413.04] you use the nerve good acid stabilizer
[1409.92 - 1416.48] on a on a regular basis Miracles
[1413.04 - 1419.20] actually happen for so many people it's
[1416.48 - 1421.16] really a very special special thing and
[1419.20 - 1423.80] that's a medical medium brain shot
[1421.16 - 1425.36] therapy which is the brainsaver protocol
[1423.80 - 1428.44] book and
[1425.36 - 1430.44] then people are sick because of
[1428.44 - 1432.16] something people are struggling because
[1430.44 - 1435.28] of something they're struggling because
[1432.16 - 1437.00] they're immune system is struggling I
[1435.28 - 1439.76] talked about this in some of the immune
[1437.00 - 1442.56] system shows right that we've done
[1439.76 - 1446.52] if you're sick your immune system is
[1442.56 - 1449.04] sick it is so simplified so simplified
[1446.52 - 1451.40] you're sick your immune system's down
[1449.04 - 1454.04] it's sick you got something wrong with
[1451.40 - 1456.12] you your immune system's struggling you

[1488.84 - 1494.20] one thing at a time whatever you got
[1491.00 - 1497.12] going your immune system is struggling
[1494.20 - 1501.48] struggling what does your immune system
[1497.12 - 1505.16] need what what does it need right
[1501.48 - 1511.20] vitamin C vitamin C is critical for the
[1505.16 - 1514.28] immune system it just is so critical
[1511.20 - 1518.68] that if you were on a ship out in the
[1514.28 - 1521.60] ocean for a long time
[1518.68 - 1525.80] eating beef
[1521.60 - 1528.64] jerky you will fall apart fall apart
[1525.80 - 1532.76] it's why carnivore people can't eat meat
[1528.64 - 1534.16] there's no vitamin C no vitamin C it's
[1532.76 - 1536.72] why if you're actually eating meat for
[1534.16 - 1538.60] two years your Skin's going to look like
[1536.72 - 1540.68] crap in five
[1538.60 - 1542.08] years that's why the carnivore diet
[1540.68 - 1544.16] isn't the carnivore diet anymore they
[1542.08 - 1547.44] just try to use the name carnivore diet
[1544.16 - 1550.92] is just a keto diet with fruit it's meat
[1547.44 - 1552.40] and fruit now I'm saying this because if
[1550.92 - 1554.88] you don't put the fruit in there and get
[1552.40 - 1558.36] any vitamin C you're screwed you're
[1554.88 - 1561.28] screwed you will fall apart your body
[1558.36 - 1563.04] your connective tissue you can't just be
[1561.28 - 1564.76] on meat and this isn't coming from a
[1563.04 - 1566.28] plant-based situation I'm not saying
[1564.76 - 1568.88] that you got to be all plant-based you
[1566.28 - 1572.72] can't eat meat that's not it at all I'm
[1568.88 - 1576.12] saying you will be so totally
[1572.72 - 1579.48] screwed your body will fall apart your
[1576.12 - 1581.36] collagen will fall apart yes doesn't
[1579.48 - 1584.20] matter how much protein you think you're
[1581.36 - 1588.92] getting everything's going to fall
[1584.20 - 1591.92] apart you have to have vitamin C
[1588.92 - 1591.92] vitamin
[1593.20 - 1599.44] C gotta contain
[1596.20 - 1601.96] myself because the amount of stupidity
[1599.44 - 1604.00] in the health realm is so bad and it's
[1601.96 - 1607.64] never ending I've been watching it for
[1604.00 - 1610.28] decades it's never ending Lauren moch
[1607.64 - 1612.80] over there yes I was in the hospital
[1610.28 - 1615.40] from gastritis they sent me home with
[1612.80 - 1617.72] medicine took one pill and then
[1615.40 - 1621.24] discovered the nerve gut stabilizer shot
[1617.72 - 1623.76] worked better didn't have to take my any
[1621.24 - 1628.00] more medicine after that's incredible
[1623.76 - 1632.20] Lauren it is and I think what happens
[1628.00 - 1633.72] with people okay is there's a lot of
[1632.20 - 1635.48] people in the health movement they they
[1633.72 - 1638.44] they lack the experience because they
[1635.48 - 1640.16] haven't been truly that sick yet so
[1638.44 - 1641.76] their influencers built on health
[1640.16 - 1643.48] because they have an interest in it but
[1641.76 - 1646.40] they haven't been that sick yet they
[1643.48 - 1648.68] will down the road I know one who's a
[1646.40 - 1651.28] podcast person right now
[1648.68 - 1654.20] it's a pretty well-known podcast to a
[1651.28 - 1656.16] degree and they're just eating meat
[1654.20 - 1658.32] right now they're in the process or
[1656.16 - 1661.44] she's just eating meat yeah because
[1658.32 - 1663.28] she's getting sick getting desperate had
[1661.44 - 1665.20] to do the elimination process and get
[1663.28 - 1667.80] down to just meat because she heard
[1665.20 - 1669.16] about you she carnivore people on there
[1667.80 - 1671.04] and then she's going to have to go from
[1669.16 - 1674.60] there and eventually add fruit something
[1671.04 - 1677.56] she was afraid of all these years the
[1674.60 - 1679.08] point is is no matter what if you're a
[1677.56 - 1680.72] health person influencer health
[1679.08 - 1682.48] podcaster or whoever it is and you
[1680.72 - 1683.68] haven't been sick enough you lack a
[1682.48 - 1685.36] tremendous amount of experience you
[1683.68 - 1687.28] might say you were sick but you might
[1685.36 - 1689.64] not have been that sick you really
[1687.28 - 1693.92] weren't that
[1689.64 - 1695.92] sick and so what happens is people
[1693.92 - 1698.08] with less
[1695.92 - 1700.68] experience about what's going on with
[1698.08 - 1703.60] the chronic Leo and being sick are out
[1700.68 - 1706.72] there running the scene I call them the
[1703.60 - 1708.52] health slum Lords they run the scene
[1706.72 - 1711.24] they dominate the scene they take take
[1708.52 - 1714.08] over they got a lot of money they can
[1711.24 - 1717.40] throw the money around they can throw it
[1714.08 - 1719.80] into teams of people doing a ton of work
[1717.40 - 1721.04] and then they haven't been sick enough
[1719.80 - 1722.60] they don't know the experience with
[1721.04 - 1724.56] chronic illness they don't understand
[1722.60 - 1730.08] and then they sit there just throwing
[1724.56 - 1733.24] out stuff like feal matter implant
[1730.08 - 1734.60] disastrous yeah disastrous like other
[1733.24 - 1736.92] things
[1734.60 - 1738.96] too like running your blood through the
[1736.92 - 1741.00] machines and running it back into your
[1738.96 - 1743.32] body
[1741.00 - 1745.88] disastrous so many different you know
[1743.32 - 1747.96] things out there ACV
[1745.88 - 1749.28] disastrous all kinds of stuff right
[1747.96 - 1752.16] these are just the name of few I mean
[1749.28 - 1753.60] there's tons and tons of stuff but they
[1752.16 - 1755.76] don't know because they haven't been
[1753.60 - 1758.88] truly that sick yet and if they get sick
[1755.76 - 1760.92] and when they really really get sick ah
[1758.88 - 1763.04] man they're going to be swimming in that
[1760.92 - 1765.60] what do I do now what do I what kind of
[1763.04 - 1767.12] water do I drink let me try this let me
[1765.60 - 1768.60] try that they're going to be in that
[1767.12 - 1771.56] place where they're drowning
[1768.60 - 1773.32] ing drowning in
[1771.56 - 1775.44] misinformation and they may have an
[1773.32 - 1777.92] Awakening one day and realize that
[1775.44 - 1782.00] medical medium people have
[1777.92 - 1784.08] healed dasty chronic illness just real
[1782.00 - 1785.96] real serious chronic illness and have
[1784.08 - 1788.08] come out of that risen out of the ashes
[1785.96 - 1790.36] and come out of that you know medical
[1788.08 - 1793.52] mean people know they know the
[1790.36 - 1795.32] communities know that what it's like to
[1793.52 - 1797.12] be on couch Island and Mattress Island
[1795.32 - 1799.44] for years and then to come out of it and
[1797.12 - 1800.88] rise out of that
[1799.44 - 1805.24] okay just like what Lauren said about
[1800.88 - 1808.36] her stomach and use the nerve gut acid
[1805.24 - 1813.60] stabilizer all this is important and
[1808.36 - 1816.12] once again why do I care why do I care
[1813.60 - 1818.92] you know I care because I see The
[1816.12 - 1821.96] Chronic Ill get affected and get stomped
[1818.92 - 1825.16] on constantly out there it's pain
[1821.96 - 1826.92] staking I see them get tricked I see
[1825.16 - 1829.12] them swimming in all kinds of trends
[1826.92 - 1831.56] that don't work
[1829.12 - 1834.48] it's every day out there and they're
[1831.56 - 1837.80] getting lured in by microbiome talk
[1834.48 - 1841.04] they're getting lured in by
[1837.80 - 1844.32] flash shiny things and shiny
[1841.04 - 1846.84] objects and they don't
[1844.32 - 1848.88] realize about like something like the
[1846.84 - 1851.72] vitamin C shock
[1848.88 - 1853.32] therapy if you're somebody who's got any
[1851.72 - 1855.92] kind of symptom any kind of problem
[1853.32 - 1858.52] whatever it is your immune system needs
[1855.92 - 1861.80] help bottom line
[1858.52 - 1863.72] your immune system needs assistance now
[1861.80 - 1865.84] we have like assistance to destroy our
[1863.72 - 1868.00] immune systems it's everywhere we're up
[1865.84 - 1870.56] against all kinds of stuff that's what
[1868.00 - 1872.76] we do on planet Earth and there's plenty
[1870.56 - 1874.84] of assistance to that like we can just
[1872.76 - 1878.48] annihilate our immune system in so many
[1874.84 - 1881.56] different ways very simply just caffeine
[1878.48 - 1884.76] alone is an immune system Destroyer
[1881.56 - 1888.00] caffeine alone okay that's an immune
[1884.76 - 1891.72] system Destroyer just like when a mom is
[1888.00 - 1894.16] on caffeine while pregnant and the
[1891.72 - 1895.28] baby's immune system gets compromised
[1894.16 - 1897.84] from that
[1895.28 - 1899.52] caffeine but there's an answer to that
[1897.84 - 1902.68] moms have to look out and become aware
[1899.52 - 1905.44] and not do caffeine on any level moms
[1902.68 - 1909.00] should not be eating
[1905.44 - 1911.32] chocolate chocolate is harmful for the
[1909.00 - 1912.84] baby extremely harmful for the baby I
[1911.32 - 1915.40] talked about this for years you guys
[1912.84 - 1919.04] might remember maybe some of you don't
[1915.40 - 1921.08] but chocolate is really bad during a
[1919.04 - 1922.60] pregnancy and I look if somebody just
[1921.08 - 1925.56] asked a book on in I just saw right
[1922.60 - 1926.96] there brain saver protocols there it is
[1925.56 - 1930.80] okay all
[1926.96 - 1933.64] right immune system problems are rampant
[1930.80 - 1935.92] immune cells are actually struggling in
[1933.64 - 1938.76] human kind right now it's it's actually
[1935.92 - 1940.56] the biggest thing happening you don't
[1938.76 - 1942.52] hear it as the biggest thing happening
[1940.56 - 1944.36] you don't you hear other things like
[1942.52 - 1946.96] processed foods are the biggest problem
[1944.36 - 1949.40] on planet Earth processed foods aren't
[1946.96 - 1951.56] the biggest problem on planet Earth and
[1949.40 - 1953.56] like I said before you take processed
[1951.56 - 1956.32] foods away from people they will find it
[1953.56 - 1958.20] one way or another just like moonshine
[1956.32 - 1961.16] just like prohibition just like when
[1958.20 - 1964.40] they removed alcohol out of people's
[1961.16 - 1966.28] hands back in the 20s and 30s just like
[1964.40 - 1968.96] when they did that people were just
[1966.28 - 1970.84] brewing their own moonshine in the woods
[1968.96 - 1972.60] and that's what they did they consumed
[1970.84 - 1975.08] it that way because they're going to
[1972.60 - 1978.04] find it no matter what if they want it
[1975.08 - 1980.76] lra 144 Anthony I did the nerve gut ask
[1978.04 - 1983.00] stabilizer today to strength me
[1980.76 - 1986.36] strengthen me for my flight to LA
[1983.00 - 1989.40] tomorrow lar 144 where are you flying LA
[1986.36 - 1992.48] tomorrow where you
[1989.40 - 1996.28] going are you going to Cafe
[1992.48 - 1998.88] Gratitude October 21st 22nd 23rd 24th
[1996.28 - 1999.80] which night do you have it's going to be
[1998.88 - 2002.40] really
[1999.80 - 2004.16] fun so I want to make the vitamin C
[2002.40 - 2006.60] shock therapy
[2004.16 - 2009.76] critical for so many people I want to
[2006.60 - 2009.76] read about it a little bit too
[2010.28 - 2015.84] okay over there
[2012.20 - 2021.00] [ __ ] um still freezing up over
[2015.84 - 2023.36] there keeps on freezing up the screen
[2021.00 - 2025.92] okay all right so we're talking about
[2023.36 - 2028.60] medical medium vitamin C shock
[2025.92 - 2031.16] therapy why does medical medium vitamin
[2028.60 - 2033.88] C shock therapy bring healing to a new
[2031.16 - 2036.40] level because it takes a a specific type
[2033.88 - 2037.88] of glucose attached to that vitamin C so
[2036.40 - 2040.40] here's another thing that's important
[2037.88 - 2043.04] right here nutrients
[2040.40 - 2046.60] antioxidants they need a
[2043.04 - 2049.96] sugar to travel far they need a sugar to
[2046.60 - 2053.92] travel far that's part of the healing
[2049.96 - 2057.08] that is part of the healing they need
[2053.92 - 2059.96] glucose to enter cells so when you're
[2057.08 - 2063.28] using something to beat something and to
[2059.96 - 2066.28] heal and recover and move past illness
[2063.28 - 2069.72] and you need something like that making
[2066.28 - 2071.88] that work is is even part of how you
[2069.72 - 2073.88] heal how do you make that even work when
[2071.88 - 2076.44] you need something and you can get a
[2073.88 - 2079.28] hold of it you can take it to another
[2076.44 - 2081.40] level to make it work so the vitamin C
[2079.28 - 2084.32] shock therapy and I have the vimergy
[2081.40 - 2086.52] micro C powder right here by the way
[2084.32 - 2087.68] this in combination of the MSM I don't

[2111.56 - 2117.72] that I can't say that that's something
[2114.76 - 2119.56] dangerous to say if it wasn't true
[2117.72 - 2121.48] because guess what wherever I got that

[2288.08 - 2293.04] liver to fix your liver you can't you
[2290.84 - 2295.44] got liver problems that cow's liver is
[2293.04 - 2300.16] going to make your liver worse keep that
[2295.44 - 2303.28] in mind it just is and you can't consume
[2300.16 - 2305.40] collagen thinking that that's going to
[2303.28 - 2306.92] produce collagen somehow in you but
[2305.40 - 2309.80] guess what the health industry made that
[2306.92 - 2312.04] massive mistake I mean I was laughing at
[2309.80 - 2314.80] that for years it's painful because the
[2312.04 - 2316.40] amount of collagen people purchased and
[2314.80 - 2318.80] thought they were doing something for
[2316.40 - 2320.72] themselves and the amount of like super
[2318.80 - 2322.64] models out there talking about how their
[2320.72 - 2324.84] collagen all that collagen is helping
[2322.64 - 2326.36] them and everything you know meanwhile
[2324.84 - 2328.84] they're getting you know they're getting
[2326.36 - 2331.72] exfoliations and facials day in and day
[2328.84 - 2334.08] out and day in and day out the point is
[2331.72 - 2336.16] is collagen doesn't build collagen and
[2334.08 - 2339.12] no disrespect to supermodels of course
[2336.16 - 2342.00] but but collagen doesn't build collagen
[2339.12 - 2343.80] it doesn't you need building blocks so
[2342.00 - 2346.00] medical beam information was about the
[2343.80 - 2348.84] building blocks to collagen that was the
[2346.00 - 2351.08] whole point there about putting that
[2348.84 - 2354.24] information out first and one of those
[2351.08 - 2358.20] building blocks is Vitamin C you care
[2354.24 - 2360.56] about your skin than vitamin C now you
[2358.20 - 2363.48] may not care about your skin and that's
[2360.56 - 2365.00] fine so care about your immune system
[2363.48 - 2366.48] though especially when there's all kinds
[2365.00 - 2368.88] of stuff going around especially when
[2366.48 - 2371.28] you got symptoms and conditions you got
[2368.88 - 2374.08] symptoms you're struggling you got a
[2371.28 - 2375.84] condition your immune system struggling
[2374.08 - 2378.52] that's how it works immune system
[2375.84 - 2381.76] struggles when you don't feel good and
[2378.52 - 2384.84] that's What vitamin C really is for you
[2381.76 - 2387.84] can be on a ship with beef beef jerky if
[2384.84 - 2391.68] you're on that ship too long out in Sea
[2387.84 - 2395.60] you will get scurvy your bones will fall
[2391.68 - 2399.44] apart you will get rickets rickets will
[2395.60 - 2403.44] eat your bones they will drill through
[2399.44 - 2407.80] your bones like rickets
[2403.44 - 2410.88] will will burrow through your skin it's
[2407.80 - 2414.16] critical to know if you're on a ship
[2410.88 - 2416.76] okay I I mean look now that carnivore
[2414.16 - 2418.64] dudes on social know that you need to
[2416.76 - 2420.56] eat some fruit at least to keep yourself
[2418.64 - 2422.20] alive now they know you need a little
[2420.56 - 2423.48] lemon and you need some fruit to keep
[2422.20 - 2424.88] the themselves can you imagine a whole
[2423.48 - 2426.96] bunch of carnivore dudes before they
[2424.88 - 2429.00] knew that and they were just packing
[2426.96 - 2431.56] beef jerky on their little trip on a
[2429.00 - 2433.20] boat and if they were on that boat for a
[2431.56 - 2435.88] year can you imagine what they would
[2433.20 - 2439.80] look like when they came back riddled in
[2435.88 - 2442.40] rickets riddled and scurvy they would be
[2439.80 - 2444.68] a mess they wouldn't have a muscle on
[2442.40 - 2447.28] them they would just be literally
[2444.68 - 2449.68] skeletons of themselves they would be
[2447.28 - 2453.12] shadows of themselves that's how
[2449.68 - 2456.68] ridiculous that is because there's a
[2453.12 - 2459.68] reason why you take a lime tree on a
[2456.68 - 2462.48] ship that's going to be out in Sea for a
[2459.68 - 2466.12] long time because the lime will save
[2462.48 - 2469.12] your life it will save your life the
[2466.12 - 2474.12] orange will save your
[2469.12 - 2476.04] life it just will vitamin C and then you
[2474.12 - 2479.88] take like a pure vitamin C like this
[2476.04 - 2482.60] like a pure form of vitamin C right here
[2479.88 - 2486.52] like the vimergy one which isn't all
[2482.60 - 2488.08] ascorbic acid it's not ascorbic acid I'm
[2486.52 - 2490.60] saying this cuz this is important to
[2488.08 - 2493.60] know because people burn holes in their
[2490.60 - 2496.64] guts with ascorbic acid they get all the
[2493.60 - 2498.44] vitamin C packets straight ascorbic acid
[2496.64 - 2500.44] they think they're doing their body good
[2498.44 - 2501.88] they're pouring that in stuff here let
[2500.44 - 2504.04] me just open up another one of these
[2501.88 - 2505.64] packets and pour it in here it's
[2504.04 - 2509.88] straight ascorbic
[2505.64 - 2513.08] acid it's too harsh on the stomach
[2509.88 - 2516.72] lining too harsh to the gastric glands
[2513.08 - 2521.24] too harsh to the dadum to the intestinal
[2516.72 - 2524.04] lining too harsh and people just eat up
[2521.24 - 2527.36] their lining with that ascorbic acid and
[2524.04 - 2530.08] that's what people do right and then the
[2527.36 - 2532.88] viy right here so if you don't know the
[2530.08 - 2536.60] stuff V is in viictor i m is a Mary E RG
[2532.88 - 2539.72] y.com you can go to vimergy.com
[2536.60 - 2543.72] vimergy that micro C right there is
[2539.72 - 2546.64] buffered truly buffered it's not a scorc
[2543.72 - 2548.92] acid and it's buffered so that's a whole
[2546.64 - 2550.64] game danger right there I can't talk
[2548.92 - 2552.20] about it enough and I don't talk about
[2550.64 - 2555.64] it enough I should be talking about this
[2552.20 - 2557.68] stuff every hour every day because it's
[2555.64 - 2559.52] that important for chronic illness it's
[2557.68 - 2561.40] that important for the immune system
[2559.52 - 2564.32] because hey that's what everybody's
[2561.40 - 2567.00] dealing with they're dealing with maxed
[2564.32 - 2571.32] out immune systems burnt out immune
[2567.00 - 2574.52] systems okay low immune systems damaged
[2571.32 - 2577.28] immune systems and the scare and the
[2574.52 - 2579.32] fear tactics out there to get people
[2577.28 - 2582.00] interested in stuff so they buy their
[2579.32 - 2584.92] stuff that scare and fear tactic doesn't
[2582.00 - 2586.88] come with help and answers and options
[2584.92 - 2589.76] doesn't come with stuff if they say
[2586.88 - 2591.80] vitamin C it's ascorbic acid great got a
[2589.76 - 2594.08] new problem now you're just you're
[2591.80 - 2597.60] ripping up your

[2681.64 - 2685.44] in
[2683.76 - 2689.04] here all
[2685.44 - 2689.04] right just like
[2691.92 - 2697.16] that I'm going to put a little bit of
[2693.84 - 2699.40] honey in here too remember the glucose
[2697.16 - 2702.88] Honey's got its own
[2699.40 - 2706.08] powers a little bit of honey in
[2702.88 - 2708.32] there okay that's the
[2706.08 - 2710.16] glucose vitamin C shock therapy is
[2708.32 - 2713.96] really incredible because you're you're
[2710.16 - 2716.24] actually bonding that antioxidant into
[2713.96 - 2719.40] the glucose of Honey which already has
[2716.24 - 2721.12] phytochemical compounds which is a
[2719.40 - 2724.44] wonderful thing all on its own let's get
[2721.12 - 2727.84] an orange here okay the Orange is
[2724.44 - 2729.28] dropping everywhere
[2727.84 - 2732.52] you can put a whole Orange in there you
[2729.28 - 2736.80] can put a half an orange in there that's
[2732.52 - 2736.80] okay so I'm squeezing right
[2738.28 - 2744.40] now half an orange I'm going to squeeze
[2740.76 - 2745.72] a little bit more this orange here so if
[2744.40 - 2748.40] you guys just came on here this is the
[2745.72 - 2750.28] medical medium vitamin C shock therapy
[2748.40 - 2751.84] man the bugs going around and everything
[2750.28 - 2755.28] else out there and everybody's immune
[2751.84 - 2757.60] system is always under attack fight or
[2755.28 - 2760.36] flight and that's the problem too a lot
[2757.60 - 2762.80] of people's immune system immune systems
[2760.36 - 2764.52] are under adrenaline attack from all the
[2762.80 - 2766.92] fight or flight they got stress they got
[2764.52 - 2770.16] all these things going on and that
[2766.92 - 2772.24] stress really affects the immune system
[2770.16 - 2774.24] but people don't know why or how well
[2772.24 - 2777.40] it's affecting it because adrenaline
[2774.24 - 2780.52] shocks immune cells adrenaline from
[2777.40 - 2782.24] stress so it hits the immune system so
[2780.52 - 2785.72] I'm going to stir this
[2782.24 - 2787.48] up okay repeat this every two hours
[2785.72 - 2790.08] every two waking
[2787.48 - 2792.04] hours ask your doctor what's right for
[2790.08 - 2794.76] you ask your doctor if you can do the
[2792.04 - 2796.92] vitamin C shock
[2794.76 - 2799.28] therapy that's what I would do go to
[2796.92 - 2803.52] your doctor go to your doctor today call
[2799.28 - 2807.76] them up give them a call call the office
[2803.52 - 2809.92] hello Dr job's office how can I help you
[2807.76 - 2812.92] yeah can you ask him if I can do the
[2809.92 - 2815.04] medical medium vitamin C shock therapy
[2812.92 - 2819.52] uh hold
[2815.04 - 2821.24] on okay okay you know what happens is
[2819.52 - 2822.88] the vitamin C shock therapies you can do
[2821.24 - 2825.64] it in different ways
[2822.88 - 2828.44] look when any anything that's immune
[2825.64 - 2829.64] system related okay I tell family and
[2828.44 - 2833.92] friends
[2829.64 - 2837.60] UTI kidney infections bladder infections
[2833.92 - 2840.60] okay boom sore throats you don't feel
[2837.60 - 2842.52] good earaches different things happening
[2840.60 - 2844.28] you think you're getting some congestion
[2842.52 - 2847.12] maybe starting a cough maybe you're
[2844.28 - 2848.84] starting a flu maybe you're starting SE
[2847.12 - 2850.56] maybe you got something else going on
[2848.84 - 2853.20] right maybe you just feel like you're
[2850.56 - 2855.36] run down maybe you've been doing a lot
[2853.20 - 2857.04] not sleeping as much not taking care of
[2855.36 - 2860.04] yourself because you can't because
[2857.04 - 2863.24] you're working really hard something I
[2860.04 - 2866.84] am guilty of very very
[2863.24 - 2869.36] guilty I'm guilty of the crime of
[2866.84 - 2871.68] working a lot of hours trying to get
[2869.36 - 2874.08] these books done and everything else and
[2871.68 - 2877.28] not getting enough
[2874.08 - 2879.40] sleep so this is something that that is
[2877.28 - 2882.64] is just really powerful that for that
[2879.40 - 2885.28] how is hot water is it hot water it's
[2882.64 - 2889.24] warm water you can do it in hot I like
[2885.28 - 2890.76] warm water for this okay so how hot is
[2889.24 - 2893.56] the water is the question mark on IG I
[2890.76 - 2896.72] just saw it's not that hot watch you
[2893.56 - 2896.72] don't even need to blow on
[2896.92 - 2901.52] it little edgy but it's not hot you can
[2900.04 - 2903.00] definitely do that it's like the perfect
[2901.52 - 2905.92] temperature right
[2903.00 - 2908.32] there so that is the medical me and vit
[2905.92 - 2911.20] vitamin C shock
[2908.32 - 2912.80] therapy so sh so I'm going to read a
[2911.20 - 2914.36] little bit of this too you don't want to
[2912.80 - 2916.72] Scorch it you don't want it boiling you
[2914.36 - 2917.92] don't want to put boiling water in there
[2916.72 - 2920.56] you
[2917.92 - 2923.88] don't
[2920.56 - 2926.08] so um I'm almost out of this one I've
[2923.88 - 2928.92] really knocked it I've knocked it down
[2926.08 - 2931.56] I'm just saying pretty much there isn't
[2928.92 - 2933.52] much left at the bottom of there Janine
[2931.56 - 2936.88] says does the powder have stronger
[2933.52 - 2940.08] powers than the micro C tablets you can
[2936.88 - 2943.28] do the micro tablets they're also really
[2940.08 - 2947.04] powerful too it's okay this one right
[2943.28 - 2950.80] here has a little bit added things for
[2947.04 - 2955.04] skin keep that in mind right but it's
[2950.80 - 2955.04] more convenient that's the key it's more
[2956.76 - 2960.80] convenient I love the the capsules I
[2959.16 - 2963.20] take them all the time I'll take eight
[2960.80 - 2965.44] capsules so when I do the vitamin C
[2963.20 - 2968.76] capsules the micro C I'll do like eight
[2965.44 - 2972.76] capsules boom I want to get vitamin C in
[2968.76 - 2975.32] me I do I want my skin looking good I
[2972.76 - 2977.36] don't want my skin to fall apart I don't
[2975.32 - 2982.68] want my skin to start getting all like
[2977.36 - 2986.56] nasty and stuff I don't and I I want it
[2982.68 - 2988.56] to look good I want it to Glow so yeah I
[2986.56 - 2990.24] take a lot of vitamin C but I don't take
[2988.56 - 2992.20] ascorbic acid I don't take somebody
[2990.24 - 2994.56] else's vitamin C I take the vimergy
[2992.20 - 2997.48] vitamin C for the Vitamin C shock
[2994.56 - 2999.52] therapy powder it's not nice because you
[2997.48 - 3001.56] don't have to open up the capsules it's
[2999.52 - 3003.76] easy you scoop it you put it in you mix
[3001.56 - 3005.04] it up I like it for that reason right
[3003.76 - 3007.32] there but of course you can open up the
[3005.04 - 3009.24] capsules vitam medical me and vitamin C
[3007.32 - 3010.68] shock therapy is set up where you can
[3009.24 - 3014.00] just open up the capsules and put it in
[3010.68 - 3016.16] there it says that but I use both I do I
[3014.00 - 3018.64] do I'll do it this way and pop some
[3016.16 - 3021.28] capsules of
[3018.64 - 3023.32] course so why does the medical me
[3021.28 - 3024.56] vitamin C shock therapy bring healing to
[3023.32 - 3026.96] a new
[3024.56 - 3029.28] level because it takes specific kind of
[3026.96 - 3032.72] glucose you'll find mainly in raw
[3029.28 - 3036.08] honey so it's not even just you got one
[3032.72 - 3038.92] thing you got the power of the micro se
[3036.08 - 3041.08] but when you put it with honey something
[3038.92 - 3042.76] happens and that was something Spirit of
[3041.08 - 3045.00] compassion taught me all these years so
[3042.76 - 3046.92] it's like well I I need to make sure
[3045.00 - 3051.12] this gets out there and message this
[3046.92 - 3054.64] information when you add that raw honey
[3051.12 - 3058.12] or a raw honey to that
[3054.64 - 3060.76] antioxidant and that buffer antioxidant
[3058.12 - 3063.64] what could happen is another
[3060.76 - 3067.52] level so and what you do is you freshly
[3063.64 - 3070.32] squeeze the vitamin C from an orange in
[3067.52 - 3073.36] here too which is another type of
[3070.32 - 3075.60] vitamin C from an orange so what you're
[3073.36 - 3078.40] doing is you're doing two kinds of
[3075.60 - 3081.44] vitamin C right there vitamin C from
[3078.40 - 3084.28] Citrus from the orange coupled with the
[3081.44 - 3087.04] micro C from vimergy and you're doing
[3084.28 - 3089.04] that with the glucose from the Raw honey
[3087.04 - 3091.52] and you have
[3089.04 - 3093.48] yourself something that's
[3091.52 - 3096.32] incredible I'm reading right here if you
[3093.48 - 3099.36] guys don't mind
[3096.32 - 3102.40] right you need the right kind of non
[3099.36 - 3105.32] ascorbic acid vitamin C non ascorbic
[3102.40 - 3108.88] acid vitamin C please know
[3105.32 - 3110.68] that so important if you guys know all
[3108.88 - 3112.36] this already just hang in there I'm
[3110.68 - 3114.84] going to be going to be doing some other
[3112.36 - 3117.00] stuff today so hang in there if you're
[3114.84 - 3119.88] an expert at this the medical me
[3117.00 - 3122.36] information but non ascorbic
[3119.88 - 3123.68] acid and to this day you see it every
[3122.36 - 3126.36] day out there you see an influence out
[3123.68 - 3128.20] there like I'm taking my vitamin C and
[3126.36 - 3131.80] it's just straight of Scorpi acid I'm
[3128.20 - 3134.60] like you're you're lighting your guts on
[3131.80 - 3137.04] fire during the medical medium broadcast
[3134.60 - 3140.00] channel I will share the recipes there
[3137.04 - 3141.88] after this live on
[3140.00 - 3144.68] IG all
[3141.88 - 3146.12] right so it drives the vitamin C into
[3144.68 - 3151.20] the cell so I want to go into that you
[3146.12 - 3154.36] need a sugar to drive a nutrient into a
[3151.20 - 3156.88] cell there are billions of dollars of
[3154.36 - 3161.04] nutraceutical that were sold through the
[3156.88 - 3162.72] last 25 30 years and because people had
[3161.04 - 3166.36] a fear of
[3162.72 - 3169.76] fruit none of that stuff got driven into
[3166.36 - 3173.96] cells even if those neutraceuticals
[3169.76 - 3176.92] worked I take vitamin E I take vitamin A
[3173.96 - 3178.32] I take a probiotic well that's still I
[3176.92 - 3180.44] take well all these nutrients they put
[3178.32 - 3182.92] in probiotic now none of them go into
[3180.44 - 3187.04] anything I take you know I take this I
[3182.92 - 3190.52] take that I take vitamin B I take a b
[3187.04 - 3193.36] complex I take methola right it doesn't
[3190.52 - 3196.80] go into the cells it doesn't enter it if
[3193.36 - 3199.64] you're afraid of something that you need
[3196.80 - 3202.28] a special glucose one that's really
[3199.64 - 3204.40] bioidentical to our bodies which is like
[3202.28 - 3207.32] a glucose from
[3204.40 - 3208.68] honey so when you do this vitamin C
[3207.32 - 3210.68] shock therapy what you're doing is
[3208.68 - 3213.20] you're bringing the vitamin C deeper
[3210.68 - 3215.32] into the cells so when you do this every
[3213.20 - 3217.64] two hours because you think something's
[3215.32 - 3219.80] coming on you think something's wrong
[3217.64 - 3222.00] and you're doing this every two hours
[3219.80 - 3225.64] you're infusing your cells you're
[3222.00 - 3228.96] entering into those cells non ascorbic
[3225.64 - 3232.56] acid vitamin C directly into the cells
[3228.96 - 3235.12] like that you're mainlining it into the
[3232.56 - 3238.00] liver and into the liver cells the liver
[3235.12 - 3240.40] has its own immune system
[3238.00 - 3242.68] and so that vitamin C is being driven to
[3240.40 - 3245.68] those immune cells now immune cells feed
[3242.68 - 3248.92] off of vitamin C it is a food for immune
[3245.68 - 3251.32] cells immune cells need the vitamin C
[3248.92 - 3254.56] they utilize they consume and they need
[3251.32 - 3256.48] the vitamin C and so when you put it in
[3254.56 - 3259.08] here mix them just like this with the
[3256.48 - 3261.68] raw honey and then you're adding in the
[3259.08 - 3264.24] orange you're mainlining those nutrients
[3261.68 - 3268.68] that vitamin C and in this case a non-
[3264.24 - 3272.84] ascorbic acid one directly into your C
[3268.68 - 3275.36] that's one of those keys it's a
[3272.84 - 3278.64] key to the
[3275.36 - 3281.08] engine Fox over there [ __ ] what books
[3278.64 - 3283.64] what book is this please the 1w is
[3281.08 - 3287.28] reading from
[3283.64 - 3287.28] protocols brains saer
[3289.76 - 3297.64] protocols bugs don't like vitamin C
[3293.52 - 3301.16] toxins don't like vitamin C
[3297.64 - 3304.88] free radicals don't like vitamin C
[3301.16 - 3309.24] people get filled up with free radicals
[3304.88 - 3310.20] free radicals help you oxidize our body
[3309.24 - 3314.12] is
[3310.20 - 3317.92] oxidizing vitamin C slows down the
[3314.12 - 3320.76] oxidizing process it is an antioxidant
[3317.92 - 3324.12] that slows down the oxidation process of
[3320.76 - 3326.00] our cells dying then if everybody has
[3324.12 - 3328.48] all these different toxins in them and
[3326.00 - 3332.84] poison poisons those free radicals
[3328.48 - 3335.40] oxidize cells faster vitamin C is doing
[3332.84 - 3339.60] a job by stopping those cells from
[3335.40 - 3342.88] oxidizing faster hence saving your
[3339.60 - 3344.80] skin helping to protect your skin
[3342.88 - 3347.28] because your skin is a sign that there's
[3344.80 - 3349.72] serious oxidation process going on
[3347.28 - 3351.64] there's all kinds of things going on too
[3349.72 - 3353.36] and you lose that collagen in your skin
[3351.64 - 3354.56] by eating collagen and that's what
[3353.36 - 3356.44] people do they're eating all this
[3354.56 - 3357.76] collagen
[3356.44 - 3359.68] it's really sad out there and I see
[3357.76 - 3361.56] influencers out there too talking like
[3359.68 - 3363.72] you know they're doing raw dairy they're
[3361.56 - 3365.44] they're doing raw milk they're doing
[3363.72 - 3367.20] like the raw cheese they're doing
[3365.44 - 3368.28] they're doing their raw dairy products
[3367.20 - 3371.40] and I'm like and they're just like
[3368.28 - 3373.76] talking about collagen and I'm
[3371.40 - 3376.04] like no no you're not going to get any
[3373.76 - 3378.60] collagen from that but you better be
[3376.04 - 3380.60] taking a vitamin C and if you take an
[3378.60 - 3383.16] ascorbic acid vitamin C over time you're
[3380.60 - 3385.04] just going to start giving your
[3383.16 - 3387.48] intestine and your lining to your
[3385.04 - 3389.68] stomach and dadum with lash when you
[3387.48 - 3393.72] give it Whiplash it starts to get
[3389.68 - 3393.72] sensitive so what happens with the
[3401.40 - 3406.72] scorpicol acid it can up that game for
[3404.52 - 3409.84] those sensitivities because that scorc
[3406.72 - 3412.72] acid is so acidic it's like battery
[3409.84 - 3415.44] acid on the intestinal track it's
[3412.72 - 3419.32] battery acid on the Linings it's battery
[3415.44 - 3421.68] acid on the dadum the stomach lining the
[3419.32 - 3423.88] esophagus escorp acid becomes like
[3421.68 - 3425.92] battery acid on the
[3423.88 - 3427.56] esophagus and so they're doing all this
[3425.92 - 3428.96] ascorbic acid every day and they think
[3427.56 - 3430.40] they're doing their body good when
[3428.96 - 3432.68] they're putting practically what feels
[3430.40 - 3435.80] like battery acid on their Linings and
[3432.68 - 3439.92] then their nerves are on those Linings
[3435.80 - 3441.04] inside those Linings their vagus nerves
[3439.92 - 3444.44] are
[3441.04 - 3447.36] inside those Linings and once those
[3444.44 - 3450.24] Vegas nerves the bell rings too much the
[3447.36 - 3451.76] bell rings once once the bell rings too
[3450.24 - 3454.40] much with those Vegas
[3451.76 - 3455.88] nerves then boom I don't know what I'm
[3454.40 - 3457.80] sensitive to I don't know what food I'm
[3455.88 - 3459.88] sensitive to nothing's digesting I don't
[3457.80 - 3462.72] feel good everything kind of
[3459.88 - 3464.60] hurts and people are like lost let me go
[3462.72 - 3466.80] to the next food allergy doctor let me
[3464.60 - 3468.20] get you know let me get an all cat let
[3466.80 - 3470.40] me get this let me get that and they're

[3536.40 - 3540.68] through that too yes when I did an
[3537.96 - 3543.04] allergy test yes
[3540.68 - 3546.24] exactly and so you got nowhere to go
[3543.04 - 3549.40] what do I eat you can eat raw cheese
[3546.24 - 3551.28] okay great thank you Doctor that's so
[3549.40 - 3552.84] great I'm scared to death of every
[3551.28 - 3557.28] single fruit and vegetable in the fruit
[3552.84 - 3561.52] and vegetable Kingdom but but I can eat
[3557.28 - 3563.28] meat great and raw dairy
[3561.52 - 3564.64] wonderful and meanwhile they're
[3563.28 - 3566.12] suffering they're struggling they don't
[3564.64 - 3570.92] feel well they got all these symptoms
[3566.12 - 3573.00] and conditions great maybe I can eat ve
[3570.92 - 3575.56] you know and this what happens people
[3573.00 - 3576.76] are like eating ve now the only thing
[3575.56 - 3579.48] they're eating is
[3576.76 - 3581.56] VE you're allergic to this fish but you
[3579.48 - 3583.64] can have this fish it's the stupidest
[3581.56 - 3585.56] thing I've ever seen and it always has
[3583.64 - 3588.64] been the stupidest thing I've ever seen
[3585.56 - 3593.16] and it's another musical cheer game
[3588.64 - 3597.28] right musical chair game yeah the
[3593.16 - 3597.28] allergy test right Tara
[3597.36 - 3602.32] terat over there in IG I think so it's
[3600.00 - 3604.36] crazy how it works and that's what
[3602.32 - 3608.92] people go through and the same thing
[3604.36 - 3611.76] back to scorc acid it lights the nerves
[3608.92 - 3615.44] on fire over time people get hypers
[3611.76 - 3618.32] sensitive it becomes an acidy burning
[3615.44 - 3620.36] mechanism that makes nerve sensitive so
[3618.32 - 3623.04] when you're doing ascorbic acid this is
[3620.36 - 3625.28] not ascorbic acid it's non ascorbic when
[3623.04 - 3627.72] you're doing ascorbic acid your Vegas
[3625.28 - 3630.56] nerves get hypers
[3627.72 - 3634.28] sensitive they can because the Linings
[3630.56 - 3636.64] of your intestine the lining of your
[3634.28 - 3640.48] dadum your
[3636.64 - 3644.32] stomach gets lit up from what feels like
[3640.48 - 3644.32] that battery acid
[3656.24 - 3660.96] so different because I can say that 20
[3659.36 - 3662.84] times and somebody will still just go
[3660.96 - 3664.60] and like get a vitamin C out there and
[3662.84 - 3666.80] they don't know it it's like
[3664.60 - 3669.20] huh and you know what's a trick out
[3666.80 - 3672.08] there now too there's some ascorbic acid
[3669.20 - 3674.56] vitamin C's that say buffer it's a
[3672.08 - 3676.36] Scorpi acid but it's buffered so they
[3674.56 - 3678.28] try to throw something in there to mix
[3676.36 - 3681.88] with these Scorpi acid to buffer it it's
[3678.28 - 3686.60] still the same it's a Scorpi acid it's
[3681.88 - 3689.04] still going to be a fire pit in the gut
[3686.60 - 3691.72] and that is not a scor Bic so medical
[3689.04 - 3694.32] medium vitamin C shock
[3691.72 - 3696.84] therapy right here there's a couple of
[3694.32 - 3699.52] little pieces of orange in
[3696.84 - 3703.24] there that's so good put the raw honey
[3699.52 - 3705.32] in there now remember every two hours
[3703.24 - 3706.52] every two waking hours if you think
[3705.32 - 3708.00] something's going on you think
[3706.52 - 3709.56] something's wrong and if you don't have
[3708.00 - 3713.00] anything going
[3709.56 - 3716.48] on what you do is you do one of these a
[3713.00 - 3718.68] day or two of these a day
[3716.48 - 3720.52] but ask your doctor what's right for you
[3718.68 - 3723.64] that's what I would do take the book to
[3720.52 - 3725.76] the doctor ask your doctor can I do the
[3723.64 - 3728.80] medical Bei and vitamin C shock therapy
[3725.76 - 3731.60] see what your doctor says that's
[3728.80 - 3735.44] all and do what your doctor tells you
[3731.60 - 3737.68] all right if you
[3735.44 - 3741.24] want all right so that's that let's go
[3737.68 - 3743.12] into um let's do the nerve gut acid
[3741.24 - 3746.52] stabilizer I'm going to move the micro
[3743.12 - 3750.24] over and if you guys want to know vimer
[3746.52 - 3752.52] V is inv Victor i m is the Mary E RG y
[3750.24 - 3755.04] them.com okay you guys know I endorse
[3752.52 - 3757.68] these guys and you know why cuz where
[3755.04 - 3761.08] can you get that you can't sorry you
[3757.68 - 3763.72] can't get micro anywhere it just doesn't
[3761.08 - 3766.28] exist and people got broken broken
[3763.72 - 3769.44] immune systems nobody gets it vimergy is
[3766.28 - 3772.44] now available in the EU
[3769.44 - 3772.44] vi.
[3773.36 - 3779.56] vi. and that can help a lot of people
[3776.00 - 3780.80] because vimergy is now out there in the
[3779.56 - 3783.28] EU
[3780.80 - 3785.48] amazing game changer for the people in
[3783.28 - 3788.32] the
[3785.48 - 3790.88] EU
[3788.32 - 3793.44] EU all
[3790.88 - 3796.24] right
[3793.44 - 3798.88] let's let's look for that
[3796.24 - 3802.60] asset stabilizer right
[3798.88 - 3805.32] there see where it is looking looking
[3802.60 - 3810.12] looking whoa burnout stabilizer that's a
[3805.32 - 3810.12] good one to so I'm in the book right
[3810.24 - 3814.36] now cuz I want to read about
[3816.57 - 3822.12] [Music]
[3818.40 - 3824.60] it you know I love these you guys do the
[3822.12 - 3824.60] brain shot
[3826.64 - 3831.72] therapies you ever get a chance to do
[3828.72 - 3831.72] these
[3832.75 - 3835.93] [Music]
[3836.52 - 3841.52] I just love looking at these the craving
[3838.88 - 3843.52] shifter anger shifter guilt and shame
[3841.52 - 3846.36] shifter so many people are riddled in
[3843.52 - 3848.28] guilt and shouldn't be riddled in guilt
[3846.36 - 3850.36] they think everything is their fault
[3848.28 - 3852.88] they think every problem that happens is
[3850.36 - 3854.80] because they they you know created it a
[3852.88 - 3857.20] lot of people believe they created their
[3854.80 - 3859.48] problems all their problems it's all
[3857.20 - 3860.80] because they're a bad person and that's
[3859.48 - 3863.88] sad all on its
[3860.80 - 3865.40] own so the nerve gut asset stabilizer is

[4138.48 - 4143.72] and on and
[4140.80 - 4146.44] on and you can
[4143.72 - 4149.08] strengthen the list goes on and you
[4146.44 - 4152.72] can't strengthen the Vegas nerves with
[4149.08 - 4154.52] exercises that is I want you exercising
[4152.72 - 4157.24] but you're not strengthening the Vagas
[4154.52 - 4159.80] nerves with exercises that I just blow
[4157.24 - 4164.16] the roof off of that one there are no
[4159.80 - 4167.76] such thing as a Vegas nerve exercise I'm
[4164.16 - 4169.88] very sorry but there isn't if a Vegas
[4167.76 - 4172.48] nerve is
[4169.88 - 4175.88] inflamed and you want to exercise your
[4172.48 - 4179.76] Vegas nerves they will get
[4175.88 - 4181.60] worse it's why people can't exercise
[4179.76 - 4184.68] they get chronically sick because your
[4181.60 - 4188.28] Vegas nerves are inflamed and if you try
[4184.68 - 4189.88] to exercise a Vegas nerve you're screwed
[4188.28 - 4192.84] you're going to be in bed
[4189.88 - 4195.40] longer you don't want to jab at your
[4192.84 - 4199.40] Vegas nerves in any way shape or form
[4195.40 - 4202.60] form or try to pull any crazy man-made
[4199.40 - 4203.68] thought up exercises to Vegas nerves
[4202.60 - 4206.00] that people don't even know where
[4203.68 - 4209.44] they're even situated
[4206.00 - 4211.52] perfectly in fact people called it Vegas
[4209.44 - 4214.24] nerve but there's
[4211.52 - 4216.52] two so it's like let me go get my Vegas
[4214.24 - 4219.68] nerves exercised let me pull all these
[4216.52 - 4220.96] exercises on my Vegas nerve oh the Vegas
[4219.68 - 4223.48] nerve expert didn't even know there's
[4220.96 - 4223.48] two Vegas
[4223.80 - 4229.20] nerves I mean I can't can't even I can't
[4225.92 - 4231.16] even I can't even I can't I can't read
[4229.20 - 4234.08] brain saver I have a whole section on
[4231.16 - 4236.24] the Vegas nerves so read the Brain saer
[4234.08 - 4237.88] book to learn about the Vegas nerves
[4236.24 - 4239.12] strengthen the Vegas nerves with
[4237.88 - 4240.72] cleaning out and killing what's
[4239.12 - 4243.76] inflaming the Vegas nerves that's how
[4240.72 - 4249.76] you strengthen them you have to kill the
[4243.76 - 4252.44] pathogens that are hurting your Vegas
[4249.76 - 4254.84] nerves and then you got to know what to
[4252.44 - 4257.56] take to rebuild your Vegas nerves that's
[4254.84 - 4260.04] how you k your Vegas nerves Vegas nerve
[4257.56 - 4261.56] exercises do not work if you're getting
[4260.04 - 4263.08] improvements then you never had a Vegas
[4261.56 - 4266.28] nerve problem you had some other problem
[4263.08 - 4268.28] where exercise is helping you if you're
[4266.28 - 4271.32] if you're improving from somebody's
[4268.28 - 4272.52] Vagas nerve exercise that means whatever
[4271.32 - 4275.64] exercise you're
[4272.52 - 4278.28] doing is good for you in other ways
[4275.64 - 4280.84] improving other problems that aren't
[4278.28 - 4282.88] Vegas nerve related because when you
[4280.84 - 4284.64] have true Vegas nerve problems you can't
[4282.88 - 4286.60] play with them you can't toy with them
[4284.64 - 4289.40] you can't mess with them they will get
[4286.60 - 4291.48] worse aggravated they will light on fire
[4289.40 - 4293.00] and your butt is going to be in trouble
[4291.48 - 4294.60] and that's what happens every day out
[4293.00 - 4296.36] there it's why somebody with chronic
[4294.60 - 4298.12] fatigue syndrome and neurological
[4296.36 - 4300.36] fatigue who's got all kinds of different
[4298.12 - 4303.04] body symptoms starts doing something
[4300.36 - 4305.00] like Vegas nerve exercises they end up
[4303.04 - 4307.48] seizuring practically they end up
[4305.00 - 4309.92] shutting down totally tired and have to
[4307.48 - 4311.36] lay down there's a reason and another
[4309.92 - 4314.00] thing too there's a reason why they
[4311.36 - 4315.36] can't exercise do you you don't think
[4314.00 - 4318.40] that the chronic leil wouldn't go go
[4315.36 - 4320.72] into a gym and exercise 4 hours a
[4318.40 - 4322.20] day like people who haven't experienced
[4320.72 - 4325.24] a health problem yet and they're 22
[4322.20 - 4326.84] years old you don't think a 40-year-old
[4325.24 - 4328.44] who's suffering from chronic illness
[4326.84 - 4329.56] every day neurological problems you
[4328.44 - 4331.88] don't think the

[4331.88 - 4336.72] gym and work
[4333.32 - 4337.96] out and not be sick in bed you don't
[4336.72 - 4339.68] think that you you don't think they want
[4337.96 - 4342.24] to get into a gym and work out they
[4339.68 - 4343.48] can't get into a gym and work out
[4342.24 - 4345.40] because they're struggling with all
[4343.48 - 4346.84] kinds of neurological problems cranial

[5172.64 - 5178.56] stabilizer use it if you have body odor
[5176.24 - 5181.40] and you're confused by it more

[5185.28 - 5190.48] if you're dealing with chronic nausea or
[5187.44 - 5192.64] chronic bloating use the nerve gut acid
[5190.48 - 5195.80] stabilizer if you're trying to repair

[5205.56 - 5212.60] difference between am I getting drunk on
[5208.76 - 5212.60] these what's the difference
[5212.64 - 5217.08] between this right here here the nerve
[5215.48 - 5219.32] gut acid stabilizer for getting you
[5217.08 - 5222.44] alkaline or alkaline ionizer water
[5219.32 - 5224.16] machines the difference is the alkaline
[5222.44 - 5226.88] ionizer water machines I don't care what
[5224.16 - 5229.60] brand it is leeches
[5226.88 - 5231.40] Metals uh-huh uh-huh that's right
[5229.60 - 5234.12] because the plates that have electricity
[5231.40 - 5236.60] to them end up corroding over time you
[5234.12 - 5239.44] don't see it at first but it's corroding
[5236.60 - 5241.88] but it happens all the time when you're
[5239.44 - 5243.48] using those machines so you think you're
[5241.88 - 5245.16] getting alkaline with alkaline water and
[5243.48 - 5246.92] you're filling yourself with free
[5245.16 - 5248.56] radicals filling yourself up with free
[5246.92 - 5251.80] radicals that's the difference between
[5248.56 - 5253.00] that getting you alkaline and that
