the fruit fear episode and then the

11
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,560
brain meditation

12
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,480
so i'll answer any questions regarding

13
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,560
those on the chemtrails the

14
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,080
fruit fear and brain meditation the

15
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,239
brain meditation is

16
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,079
really really healing people right now i

17
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:35,360
hope you guys experience that or have

18
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,120
experienced that

19
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,800
um you know did you do the brain

20
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,320
meditation did you do it twice

21
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,600
did you do it three times some people

22
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,000
are doing it more you can do it every

23
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,120
night

24
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,440
every day it's life changing

25
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,120
the difference between a meditation

26
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,920
that's not man-made

27
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,280
means it really works now i know that

28
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,320
sounds kind of confusing like what does

29
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,160
that mean it means that

30
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,440
when meditations are man-made it's hit

31
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,160
or miss

32
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,079
when a meditation comes from above it

33
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,760
really works so i'm preparing you so

34
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,640
when you try the meditation the brain

35
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,760
meditation

36
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,400
i'm preparing you with the power it has

37
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,439
and how it really works so just keep

38
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,600
that in mind because

39
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,000
there could be some tears there could

40
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,759
there's going to be an emotional release

41
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,880
a powerful emotional release so

42
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,799
what happens is when we have um losses

43
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,640
in our life and betrayals and broken

44
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,920
trust and we get hurt

45
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,560
we have fear we have shame we have guilt

46
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,119
we've been judged we've been

47
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:37,520
misunderstood

48
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:40,400
and we've when we lose friendships

49
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,119
when betrayal happens people cheat on us

50
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,840
or we get

51
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:44,560
hurt or harmed in any way emotionally

52
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,119
mentally

53
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,920
all of that those wounds stay there

54
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,759
because fear

55
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,200
kind of fills in the gap so in the brain

56
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,399
meditation

57
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,759
it's it's a way to rid fear in a really

58
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,119
powerful powerful way

59
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,000
i'm wondering wondering if you

60
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,680
experienced it yet um celia says

61
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,360
how do i get a link to this brain

62
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,280
meditation so the link is in the

63
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,320
description so the description look for

64
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,319
that okay

65
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,920
uh the description on facebook

66
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,480
description on youtube

67
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,920
so make sure you look for that link and

68
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,160
so you could get there so

69
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,959
it's medical meeting podcast at apple

70
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,599
podcast so that's the official platform

71
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,720
it's uncensored any other platform i

72
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,640
can't guarantee that

73
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,480
i'm censored everywhere else pretty much

74
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,319
so um

75
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,760
yeah so apple podcast is where you want

76
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,280
to listen to it it's why i launched it

77
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,360
on apple podcast so

78
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,959
the brain meditation is really powerful

79
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,120
you can use it to fall asleep

80
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,800
and it can still work on healing you it

81
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,080
still pulls fear out and you're going to

82
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,000
feel much lighter you're going to feel

83
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,640
like a weight's been lifted off of you

84
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,120
you're going to feel the change the

85
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:51,599
brain meditation

86
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:54,720
not only works but it's life-changing

87
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,640
look out for that danielle says

88
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,840
i always had trouble doing meditations

89
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,760
before but i love this one it's so good

90
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,280
well danielle what happens with this one

91
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,040
because it's above

92
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,040
it it's not going to be difficult

93
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,599
because when the meditation comes from

94
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,519
above

95
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:14,319
and it's not man-made then it's it's

96
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,720
it's made it's made for your soul it's

97
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:19,680
made for our souls to really do

98
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,599
so there's no struggle in it versus some

99
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,239
guy making up a meditation somewhere you

100
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,680
know what i mean

101
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,080
because that's what happened some guy in

102
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,000
the 1960s making up a meditation

103
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,360
and then it kind of like passing around

104
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,959
and someone else kind of adding

105
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,760
something to it another person adding a

106
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,680
twist to it

107
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,200
and then in the 1980s then you got

108
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,959
somebody else is doing a meditation and

109
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,640
adds a twist to it's all man-made it's

110
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,040
everybody throwing in you know their

111
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,519
their their their thoughts and ideas of

112
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,920
what a meditation could be or should be

113
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,400
well this isn't any of that so the

114
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,879
medical media meditations are from above

115
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,760
they're really really powerful and easy

116
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:56,400
to do they're supposed to be easy to do

117
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,439
a meditation is not supposed to be hard

118
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,959
to do

119
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,439
this is life changing so what's going to

120
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:04,959
happen when you do the brain meditation

121
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:06,879
it's gonna work and um and be prepared

122
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,439

123
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:11,599

124
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:14,000

191
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,639
needed

192
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,759
and i have meditations in the medical

193
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,080
meeting books

194
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,280
and they're powerful and i'm gonna even

195
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,840

196
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,680

but there's some i haven't put in the

200
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,280
medical medium book and

201
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,840
this is one of them the brain meditation

202
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,639
so this is one that i've been coveting

203
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,000
all these years one reason is it's so

204
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,840
powerful

205
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,479
and that that it's really intense

206
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:55,039
too for a lot of people but so worth it

207
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,800
to heal

208
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:59,280
jody says feeling better every day from

209
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,919
brain meditation i feel calmer and more

210
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,479
at peace

211
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,720
sleeping better after weeks of insomnia

212
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,639
what happens is when that fear builds up

213
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,400
so check this out you guys when we go

214
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,039
through life and we get bad news

215
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,520
it's like whoa what what just happened

216
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,080
you know

217
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,599
um what do you mean are friendships not

218
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,479
working out what do you need what do you

219
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,479
mean

220
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,080
um you cheated on me what do you mean

221
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,039
it's time for a divorce or what do you

222
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,080
mean for

223
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,840
you know some loss or some great great

224
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,440
uh disappointment in life

225
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,039
something that hurts us in a way

226
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,120
emotionally breaks our heart broken

227
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:34,240
trust or we get judged or

228
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,080
or we or there's an injustice and you

229
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,080
know that we feel or we're not

230
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,759
hurt and we're just feeling we're

231
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,599
feeling like you know we've been through

232
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,720
so much where we feel shame and guilt

233
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,319
and fear

234
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,000
what happens is that we have these

235
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,360
out-of-body experiences where our soul

236
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,280
leaves our body for a moment

237
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,960
because the shock is so great to the

238
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,039
emotional center of the brain where the

239
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,560
electrical impulses are going in the

240
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:58,400
emotional sense so when you get that

241
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:01,599
news like that bad news and

242
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,240
that news it's a shocker the you get a

243
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,800
charge

244
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,479
an electrical charge like a fire bolt

245
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,560
like a lightning bolt

246
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,160
firestorm a lightning storm in the

247
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,440
emotional center of your brain

248
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,039
and that shock throws the soul out of

249
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,879
your body for a moment so you get the

250
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:20,000
out-of-body experience

251
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:22,319
so it's like what what just happened

252
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,919
oh my god like you know and and when

253
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,199
those losses and

254
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:30,400
that hurt comes and we've been harmed or

255
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:33,519
we've had an injustice or a betrayal

256
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:36,399
broken trust anything that electrical

257
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,039
shock blows up in the emotional center

258
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,719
of the brain

259
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,800
and when it blows up in the emotional

260
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,599
center of the brain your soul gets

261
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,839
propelled

262
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,360
out you get this out-of-body experience

263
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,839
for a minute and when that happens

264
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,200
there's a distance between your soul and

265
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,760
your physical body

266
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,640
the brain meditation brings that

267
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,480
together

268
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,399
and as we go through life it keeps on

269
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,240
happening with more news or

270
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,600
more hardships or another struggle

271
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,920
emotional struggle

272
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,200
more fear and pain and maybe something

273
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,600
we don't even realize

274
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,560
that happened but it still sits with us

275
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,240
even if it was

276
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,080
kind of seemingly small and not

277
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,440
bothersome it was

278
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,320
it was hurtful in the moment so our soul

279
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,000
then

280
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,240
then takes on a distance from our

281
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,839
physical brain when that shock happens

282
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,120
in the emotional center of the brain

283
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,519
so in the emotional center of the brain

284
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,440
that shock occurs in there

285
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,279
then you get the out-of-body experience

286
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,360
and then fear fills the gap what the

287
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:33,040
brain meditation does

288
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:36,399
is it takes you on its guided journey

289
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:38,000
to mend the bridge that's been injured

290
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,240
the bridge in the neurons that's been

291
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,200
injured and to bring the soul back to

292
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,160
the body

293
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,440
and back to the brain and it's critical

294
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,839
back to the emotional side of the brain

295
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,320
so

296
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,560
the soul comes back all the way and the

297
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,920
fear gets removed in the center

298
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:56,160
so the power of that is just unlike any

299
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,160
it's unlike any other so um you could

300
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,839
use it to use it as a sleep meditation

301
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:03,200
you can use it every night before bed

302
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,640
share it with everybody you can so the

303
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,160

409
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,320
it's amazing fruit fear because the

410
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,399
chemtrail

411
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,880
not it's not for the faint of heart the

412
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:43,279
chemtrail episode it's mind-blowing

413
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,279
just absolutely mind-blowing maura says

414
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,000
i lost my husband to a car accident

415
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,800
years ago

416
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,079
oh my god my baby was just nine weeks

417
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,279
old at the time

418
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:54,399
i felt so disconnected since then and if

419
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,560
people ask me about

420
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,000
it it's like i'm outside my body

421
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,000
exposing it to them

422
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,360
will the brain meditation help me yes it

423
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,279
will that's that's

424
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,160
what it's for that's why i released it

425
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,760
because

426
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:12,560
with devastating news where there's just

427
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,519
no word no words can describe what

428
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,880
you're going through

429
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,440
i can't even attempt it it's just to go

430
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,399
through that

431
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,920
it's unimaginable and um just know i'm

432
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,720
truly deeply sorry

433
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,360
and yes the brain meditation is there to

434
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,040
help

435
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,680
because that's the out-of-body

436
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:33,279
experience it just it it just

437
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:35,920
it pushes it literally that shock

438
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:37,519
puts puts your soul out of body it's a

439
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,920
survival method

440
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,720
for the moment that's how we work so

441
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,480
that we don't

442
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:46,959
stroke out during severe news

443
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,800
and to get the soul to come back and

444
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:51,760
bring the fear and broken trust

445
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:54,399
of life out the brain meditation is

446
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,399

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:54,799

creatures and what's really sad is

those are the ones you see but then

586
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,080

587
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,600

00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,120

614
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,360
that

615
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:54,480

617
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:01,039
thanks to you anthony oh my god ocd

00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:03,520
so glad you got that better so happy

619
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:05,840
i've talked about ocd for years i like

620
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,600
the brain meditation for ocd too

621
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:11,360
i've talked about it for years and it's

622
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,360
just so important to get that better

623
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,320
what's my bridge joe grumman says what's

624
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,679
my bridge look like anthony

625
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:24,960
yeah i know the bridge that you

626
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:26,640
envision in the meditation is

627
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,159
could look different than the bridge

628
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,720
that i envision or the bridge that

629
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:34,000
somebody else envisions and

630
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,280
when i do it i see this bridge when i do

631
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,080
it i see

632
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,919
a fairly big bridge not a massive bridge

633
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,960
but a fairly big bridge

634
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:45,120
enough that more than a couple of

635
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,000
like two cars can at least two lanes for

636
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,520
sure

637
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,320
so it's a bridge that could have two

638
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:53,600
lanes for for for the cars okay to go

639
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:57,679
one way the other that size and it's

640
00:21:53,600 --> 00:22:00,880
it's over it's high so it is high up

641
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:02,159
so that's for sure too so i see it that

642
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,640
way as well

643
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,080
and it's a fairly large bridge where

644
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:13,120
cars are on it

645
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:16,720
and it's high up above water

646
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:18,559
um i've completed the brain meditation

647
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,799
twice and cried so much i felt such

648
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:23,760
tremendous fear when i had to step

649
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:26,000
off the edge into the hole once i was

650
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:29,200
safe i felt such a release

651
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,320
it's really i mean and

652
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,320
what happens is that

653
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:38,000
you're re-directing the neurons you're

654
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:40,159
healing you're bringing your soul back

655
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,840
but you're repairing neurons in between

656
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,039
so the emotional center of our brain our

657
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,960
neurons get damaged

658
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:47,360
when we get bad news and hurt and broken

659
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,640
trust and all these things in betrayal

660
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,840
the neurons in our brain and the

661
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,640
emotional center of the brain they get

662
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,960
injured

663
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,760
they fry and what happens is that you're

664
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,120
doing the

665
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,600
brain meditation and you're on the

666
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,360
bridge and you're walking

667
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,640
those neurons are starting to heal

668
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,720
you're getting electricity throughout

669
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,720
those neurons and it's starting to heal

670
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,200
because it's getting them prepared for

671
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,840
the soul coming back and the fear to get

672
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,679
leave to exit it's really unlike

673
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:14,080
anything that's out there it's just

674
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:16,400

heal your ptsd

715
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,360
that's the whole point when we get bad

716
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,919
news and betrayal broken trust and hurt

717
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,039
harm we break up relationship breakups

718
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,200
we get cheated on

719
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,480
divorces whatever happens throughout our

720
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,720
life we get this

721
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,960
out of body experience we get shocked

722
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,000
and the ptsd can occur from it and fear

723
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,000
fills in

724
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,360
and the brain meditation is there to

725
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,679
really restore that now

726
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,440

what is in the air we breathe i have

741
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:43,120
been expressing how unhealthy air

742
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,480
freshener scented candles perfumes are

743
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,559

744
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:50,000

00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:51,600
more than unhealthy and so when you hear

746
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,400

747
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,640

uh i have a caffeine episode coming out

833
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,679

pretty soon

836
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:06,240
and um it might be more shocking than

837
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,840
chemtrails

838
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,320
i'm letting you know the caffeine

839
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:12,640
episode that i'm going to be releasing

840
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,000
is probably more shocking than

841
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:17,520
chemtrails

842
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:21,600
i'm actually afraid to release it

843
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:24,240
but i'm gonna i'm gonna

844
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,279
anyway it's a free resource you guys

845
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,799
make sure you listen to it on the

846
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:28,080
platform that i launched it on which is

847
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,919
apple podcast

848
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,600
look if you guys have an apple device

849
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:32,640
and you're not listening to it on apple

850
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,679
podcast can you

851
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,559
please switch over to listen to it on

852
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:38,240
apple podcast

853
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:39,840
one reason because you're not listening

854
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,840
to the full episode without realizing it

855
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:45,039
even if the minutes are the same

856
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:47,840
second reason it's going to be censored

857
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:48,720
third reason i didn't launch it on any

858
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,000
other platform

859
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,799
even though it might be found on other

860
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,880
platforms i launched it on apple podcast

861
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:57,760
so please just if you have an apple

862
00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:00,159
device listen to it on apple podcast

863
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,120
leave the leave the the platform that

864
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,880
you're listening to

865
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,880
and bring it over didn't you know to

866
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,480
apple podcast and then share it and tell

867
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,399
people they could hear it there

868
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,000
please do me that favor because when you

869
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:12,080
do me that favor then i know

870
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,520
the person you share it with is getting

871
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,600
the uncensored version

872
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,559
because there's nothing more annoying

873
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,480
than

874
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,760
thinking that the per that when you're

875
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,000
sharing it

876
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,200
and you're telling people to go at a

877
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,600
different platform that i

878
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,640
didn't do the official launch at then

879
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,360
they're not going to hear the full

880
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,360
episode

881
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,039
even though you may think they are and

882
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:33,760
it's really annoying because then

883
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:35,520
i'm like why am i doing all this work if

884
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,159
everybody's sharing it and no one's

885
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,480
hearing

886
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:42,320
really what it is it's just kind of it's

887
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:44,559
really hard so please do that if you can

888
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:47,279
joe grumman says first we do the podcast

889
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:50,159
then the meditation to calm us back down

890
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:51,279
yeah the podcasts are really intense but

891
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:52,960
like i said

892
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:54,320

894
00:30:54,320 --> 00:31:00,320
fairly soon and

895
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:02,159
it's probably more shocking in many ways

896
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:04,240
than chemtrails that's how

897
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:05,600
that's how intense it is but tomorrow's

898
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,840

the air fresheners to send to candles

900
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,480
how we really have to be careful with

901
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:12,240
that

902
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,519
