[1.28 - 7.72] how many people do you know who struggle
[4.32 - 10.24] with their health chances are whether
[7.72 - 14.48] they show it or not most of the people
[10.24 - 17.56] in your life do and chances are you're
[14.48 - 21.40] one of them whether you're dealing with
[17.56 - 25.88] anxiety depression endometriosis acne
[21.40 - 28.44] eczema autoimmune thyroid lime brain fog
[25.88 - 31.24] fatigue or any other symptom or
[28.44 - 34.52] condition you're far from from
[31.24 - 38.64] alone living with symptoms has become
[34.52 - 41.72] The New Normal so no more guessing games
[38.64 - 44.76] it's time to get answers welcome to the
[41.72 - 48.76] medical medium podcast I'm Anthony
[44.76 - 52.20] William we're talking about sodium salt
[48.76 - 55.00] do you like salt do you eat salt do you
[52.20 - 58.52] drink salt are you adding salt to your
[55.00 - 61.24] water because the trend tells you so and
[58.52 - 63.76] what about a sodium deficient iy we're
[61.24 - 67.08] talking about that too it takes some
[63.76 - 71.24] serious bravery learning salt truth but
[67.08 - 74.32] it never goes well everyone usually just
[71.24 - 77.76] freaks out the addiction is stronger
[74.32 - 81.32] than people believe the salt demon
[77.76 - 84.28] almost always wins hang on for this ride
[81.32 - 87.04] and get yourself comfy because we are on
[84.28 - 87.04] the salt
[87.92 - 94.64] Express so I've been putting Salt in My
[91.32 - 97.16] Water yeah you should do it too I saw
[94.64 - 99.36] this like scientific study online that
[97.16 - 102.08] says like you need the sodium especially
[99.36 - 104.36] if you're working out yeah even my
[102.08 - 107.28] trainer who's like really
[104.36 - 109.48] hot he said it should be in your water
[107.28 - 112.32] every time you drink especially since we
[109.48 - 114.60] work out so much yeah so I thought I
[112.32 - 116.24] would just try it and I really like it I
[114.60 - 120.40] feel so much
[116.24 - 122.96] better the sodium in your water trend
[120.40 - 126.44] a trend that you would think is so
[122.96 - 128.92] backed by science and so important for
[126.44 - 132.16] us but all it's really doing is just
[128.92 - 134.64] adding salt to already a high salt diet
[132.16 - 137.32] because that's what our society does
[134.64 - 140.40] salts everything and we get salted
[137.32 - 143.36] practically to death so first let's
[140.40 - 145.92] address the salt in the water trick it's
[143.36 - 148.16] a dangerous trick no one would believe
[145.92 - 149.96] it it's almost
[148.16 - 152.96] unbelievable but here's what happen
[149.96 - 155.72] happens when you put salt in water and
[152.96 - 158.96] send it down on an empty stomach and you
[155.72 - 162.68] may not have had food before or shortly
[158.96 - 164.92] after then that salt that salt water
[162.68 - 168.20] goes directly into the liver not to
[164.92 - 171.52] detoxify it not to help it but to pickle
[168.20 - 176.48] it to actually pickle it the last thing
[171.52 - 178.48] our livers want is salt shock salt shock
[176.48 - 180.08] it's what happens when it mainlines
[178.48 - 182.84] right to the liver with nothing thing
[180.08 - 185.04] buffering it you ever see what happens
[182.84 - 188.00] when a body part is
[185.04 - 193.60] salted you know like a pig
[188.00 - 197.24] rump or some type of meat and it's
[193.60 - 199.92] salted a salt rub and then it sits there
[197.24 - 202.72] and ferments the salt just sucks the
[199.92 - 205.52] juice out of it over time if you salt a
[202.72 - 208.60] human being while they're alive they'll
[205.52 - 211.76] die if you pack somebody's body with
[208.60 - 213.72] salt like like pack them with salt where
[211.76 - 215.72] their whole body's covered in salt and
[213.72 - 218.76] then wrap them up with foil make sure
[215.72 - 222.48] they're nice and packed nice and tight
[218.76 - 225.76] and neat over time their skin would
[222.48 - 228.84] practically melt off their
[225.76 - 231.96] juices would leave their body they would
[228.84 - 234.92] get severely dehydrated their tissue
[231.96 - 237.96] their muscle meat would get
[234.92 - 241.76] dehydrated their blood would turn into a
[237.96 - 244.76] salty soup they would die we're told out
[241.76 - 248.08] there all the time by people in the
[244.76 - 250.52] trainer world the exercise world the
[248.08 - 253.68] Science World that were made of salt the
[250.52 - 257.68] medical world that were made of salt not
[253.68 - 259.92] true yes sodium's a critical mineral yes
[257.68 - 263.76] we have it in our bloodstream and in our
[259.92 - 266.20] organs yes we need it yes it's the
[263.76 - 268.24] foundation of a building block an
[266.20 - 270.24] electrolyte yes we need it for
[268.24 - 273.12] neurotransmitters
[270.24 - 275.56] but too much of a good thing goes bad
[273.12 - 278.56] too much of the wrong good thing goes
[275.56 - 282.40] worse there's two worlds of thought out
[278.56 - 285.88] there one is the old standard American
[282.40 - 288.48] Medical model which is you got to watch
[285.88 - 290.56] out for sodium too much sodium not good
[288.48 - 293.76] for your heart not good for your blood
[290.56 - 297.40] pressure stay away from salt do a no
[293.76 - 299.72] salt diet that was the old standard
[297.40 - 302.44] medical model and then the new
[299.72 - 305.52] Alternative Health SL conventional
[302.44 - 308.52] medical model SL health model which is
[305.52 - 311.08] you need sodium you need salt and they
[308.52 - 314.60] believe the old conventional model of
[311.08 - 318.44] being salt-free as wrong they think it's
[314.60 - 322.28] wrong information outdated bad and so
[318.44 - 326.52] forth but both worlds are wrong we do
[322.28 - 328.64] need salt our bloodstream needs salt but
[326.52 - 331.96] the right kind of salt our bloodstream
[328.64 - 334.92] doesn't need a teaspoon of salt or huge
[331.96 - 337.28] pinch of salt in a glass of water our
[334.92 - 339.12] bloodstream our organs don't need a
[337.28 - 341.48] glass of water every few hours with a
[339.12 - 344.20] pinch of salt in it either we don't need
[341.48 - 347.20] direct hits of salt like this if someone
[344.20 - 349.96] has a liver disease sosis of liver
[347.20 - 353.08] hepatitis C or a liver that's on the
[349.96 - 355.44] edge of failing and you do a whole glass
[353.08 - 357.28] of water and you put a nice hunk of salt
[355.44 - 360.96] in there or a pinch of salt you're
[357.28 - 363.48] risking a liver shut down you're risking
[360.96 - 365.60] a liver failure because your liver is
[363.48 - 367.92] going to uptake that sodium it's going
[365.60 - 371.16] to shock it and it doesn't shock it to
[367.92 - 374.56] cleanse it the shock instead paralyzes
[371.16 - 378.96] it puts it in a different motion shuts
[374.56 - 381.56] it down slows it down hard salt is toxic
[378.96 - 383.68] toxic to the body but yet we're being
[381.56 - 386.00] told and conditioned every day in the
[383.68 - 390.56] health movement that salt is healthy for
[386.00 - 393.04] the body so much so it's actually scary
[390.56 - 395.56] everybody's pushing sodium pushing salt
[393.04 - 397.28] of course they're pushing the good salt
[395.56 - 399.76] and they're standing behind that
[397.28 - 403.56] rightfully so good salt is good salt if
[399.76 - 407.04] you're going to use it but salt is still
[403.56 - 410.44] toxic highly toxic on the body in large
[407.04 - 412.12] quantities in large quantities and
[410.44 - 413.72] that's what's happening now it's
[412.12 - 416.04] different if you have a little bit going
[413.72 - 418.12] on your food you have a buffer the
[416.04 - 420.12] liver's buffered it can actually
[418.12 - 422.20] disperse differently it gets into the
[420.12 - 424.44] bloodstream differently but when it's in
[422.20 - 426.76] the glasses of water and thrown in there
[424.44 - 430.44] like that straight empty stomach most of
[426.76 - 433.40] the time it shock toxic shock syndrome
[430.44 - 436.16] to the liver through Salt and when high
[433.40 - 439.12] quality sodium high quality salt is on
[436.16 - 442.44] food it has a different delivery system
[439.12 - 444.88] it can Bond onto something hopefully
[442.44 - 447.84] Bond onto something temporarily maybe
[444.88 - 450.00] not longterm but temporarily all these
[447.84 - 452.40] different nutrients you have have in all
[450.00 - 455.24] your different foods antioxidants and
[452.40 - 456.44] phyton nutrients of all kinds sitting
[455.24 - 458.80] there right in front of you on your
[456.44 - 461.80] plate the salt gets put on there there's
[458.80 - 464.60] a chance it's going to bond to something
[461.80 - 466.52] at least temporarily you have a better
[464.60 - 468.36] chance when it's like that when it's
[466.52 - 470.80] with food a better chance you won't get
[468.36 - 473.20] a shutdown a better chance the salt will
[470.80 - 475.68] be bonded now remember if you're on a
[473.20 - 477.68] ship and you're thirsty and you're out
[475.68 - 479.20] there on the ocean for a long time and
[477.68 - 482.76] you start drinking that salt water guess
[479.20 - 485.84] what happens you die you get dehydrated
[482.76 - 488.32] you get pickled and you die and guess
[485.84 - 490.64] what it happened over and over again out
[488.32 - 493.16] there people got desperate they were in
[490.64 - 495.48] the ocean on the ocean maybe they were
[493.16 - 498.96] stranded somewhere and they drank and
[495.48 - 501.60] consumed salt water if it was okay to
[498.96 - 503.64] stick salt and water every single day
[501.60 - 506.12] while you're training or exercising or
[503.64 - 508.32] living your life just doing it every day
[506.12 - 510.04] if it was okay then it would be okay to
[508.32 - 512.28] drink it in a glass
[510.04 - 515.16] right out of the ocean on a ship every
[512.28 - 517.08] day but what saves somebody to do it now
[515.16 - 518.64] out of a glass and a pinch is they end
[517.08 - 521.56] up doing something else a little later
[518.64 - 524.04] they drink coffee they have a snack they
[521.56 - 526.68] have a shake they have some food they
[524.04 - 529.12] have dinner and it keeps them in the
[526.68 - 530.84] okay enough Zone they're still damaging
[529.12 - 533.92] themselves they're still damaging their
[530.84 - 536.44] liver but it keeps them in a safety zone
[533.92 - 540.84] enough to not notice it now you would
[536.44 - 542.92] think the brain it runs on electrolyt
[540.84 - 545.84] neurotransmitters need
[542.92 - 548.64] electrolytes sodium is something the
[545.84 - 551.60] brain needs then you would think
[548.64 - 554.88] drinking seawater every day on a
[551.60 - 556.96] stranded ship would feed the brain you
[554.88 - 559.08] would do pretty good but instead it
[556.96 - 560.72] pickles the brain and that's what
[559.08 - 563.40] happens it's not just the liver that
[560.72 - 565.76] goes into shock the brain goes into
[563.40 - 568.88] shock over time you end up pickling the
[565.76 - 571.36] brain your brain starts to die you would
[568.88 - 574.04] think this would be known or common
[571.36 - 576.48] sense would happen with someone you
[574.04 - 579.64] can't drink ocean water because of the
[576.48 - 583.24] salt the sodium you end up with a tragic
[579.64 - 584.84] fate if you do so why is it good now why
[583.24 - 587.08] is it good to take a glass of water and
[584.84 - 590.56] add salt to it and drink it and promote
[587.08 - 592.52] it like a health thing same as a lot of
[590.56 - 594.84] things in alternative medicine and
[592.52 - 597.44] conventional they're just wrong they
[594.84 - 600.32] don't know it's the wild west mistakes
[597.44 - 602.36] are made people suffer for it over time
[600.32 - 604.88] nobody really talks about it it's swept
[602.36 - 608.04] under the carpet but it becomes one big
[604.88 - 610.48] great mistake if it was a good idea if
[608.04 - 613.60] it was smart I would have talked about
[610.48 - 615.36] it long time ago if it was intelligent
[613.60 - 618.20] something to do something that was good
[615.36 - 620.84] for us I would have been promoting it
[618.20 - 625.56] and talking about it as a healing tool a
[620.84 - 629.40] long time ago but instead s so told me
[625.56 - 630.84] lemon water squeeze lemon in water flush
[629.40 - 632.72] is the liver of all these poisons and
[630.84 - 636.44] toxins first thing in the morning
[632.72 - 639.92] flushes the body of toxins it provides
[636.44 - 644.48] calcium provides vitamin C antioxidants
[639.92 - 647.40] trace minerals it's a key way to heal
[644.48 - 649.92] it's a very important aspect of healing
[647.40 - 652.68] and don't think it's smart now adding
[649.92 - 654.84] lemon to your salt water don't think
[652.68 - 656.64] that's a great idea either where you put
[654.84 - 659.32] a pinch of salt in your water then
[656.64 - 662.00] squeeze lemon into it you're not
[659.32 - 663.64] outsmarting the fox the Fox is still
[662.00 - 665.48] going to break into the property and the
[663.64 - 668.32] hen house it's still going to kill all
[665.48 - 670.84] the chickens and then leave a scat and
[668.32 - 673.20] laugh on its way out you're not going to
[670.84 - 675.68] fix a problem by altering the problem
[673.20 - 678.56] but keeping the problem still there
[675.68 - 680.60] instead by adding the sodium the salt to
[678.56 - 683.40] your lemon water if you're somebody that
[680.60 - 686.12] does that you just threw off the balance
[683.40 - 688.52] of what the lemon can do the lemon water
[686.12 - 690.36] can't do the flushing action it once did
[688.52 - 693.36] it can't be that cleanser for the liver
[690.36 - 696.24] anymore it's been altered the salt
[693.36 - 698.20] changed the chemistry and when the salt
[696.24 - 700.04] changes the chemistry someone is not
[698.20 - 702.08] going to get the results they need or
[700.04 - 703.84] what they're looking for so when they're
[702.08 - 706.12] drinking the lemon water because they
[703.84 - 707.92] hear great things about it but they're
[706.12 - 710.04] not getting results that they're
[707.92 - 712.28] supposed to get from the lemon water
[710.04 - 714.60] they're going to think something's wrong
[712.28 - 716.72] and yes something is wrong they don't
[714.60 - 719.60] know it it's the salt they added to the
[716.72 - 722.72] lemon water if the lemon tree thought it
[719.60 - 725.28] would be really smart to pull up all the
[722.72 - 728.20] sodium from the earth and fill the lemon
[725.28 - 730.76] with it and make it one big salt ball
[728.20 - 733.68] one big salty lemon than it would have
[730.76 - 736.40] happened in nature the lemon tree would
[733.68 - 740.28] have drawn up sodium from the earth just
[736.40 - 742.52] like celery does or spinach and it would
[740.28 - 746.12] have been salty lemons would have been
[742.52 - 749.40] really salty now lemons have a tiny bit
[746.12 - 752.84] of sodium in it not harsh sodium not har
[749.40 - 757.68] sodium not sea salt not Himalayan rock
[752.84 - 760.68] salt but a tiny bit of Trace sodium if
[757.68 - 763.32] there was supposed to be grams of sodium
[760.68 - 765.92] in a lemon then there would be there's a
[763.32 - 767.96] reason why there's not it throws off the
[765.92 - 770.96] balance of what the lemon is there for
[767.96 - 775.60] and what it does for us same thing as a
[770.96 - 780.20] tomato Trace levels of sodium but the
[775.60 - 783.80] tomato plant isn't producing nor driving
[780.20 - 787.28] up sodium from the soil into the Tomato
[783.80 - 790.16] to make it super salty if a farmer or
[787.28 - 793.24] Gardener Waters their crops with salt
[790.16 - 794.92] water guess what happens you would think
[793.24 - 797.80] maybe the salt water would just get
[794.92 - 801.32] sucked up the sodium would get sucked up
[797.80 - 804.40] everything maybe be saltier the sodium
[801.32 - 808.32] would get into all the plants but no
[804.40 - 811.56] everything dies you can't water a lemon
[808.32 - 815.32] tree with so sodium based water salt
[811.56 - 818.04] water you can't even have a portion of
[815.32 - 820.80] that water to be saturated in sodium the
[818.04 - 823.12] tree dies you can use a trace Mineral
[820.80 - 825.60] Solution you can do that and feed your
[823.12 - 828.20] garden beds feed your plants your
[825.60 - 832.72] flowers and your fruit trees you can do
[828.20 - 836.12] it with a trace mineral complex fluid or
[832.72 - 838.76] liquid that's designed to dilute and
[836.12 - 841.44] nourish your plants but you can't just
[838.76 - 844.48] take salt water and feed your plants
[841.44 - 847.36] with it everything dies because that's
[844.48 - 851.08] what happens we're like a plant in some
[847.36 - 853.88] ways you can't just pack us with salt
[851.08 - 856.24] like a salted fish will die and you
[853.88 - 860.04] can't just fill us up with salt water
[856.24 - 863.88] either cuz we will die as well but yet
[860.04 - 866.08] we need sodium we need that mineral we
[863.88 - 868.36] need it for our brains we need it for
[866.08 - 872.68] our bloodstream we need it for our
[868.36 - 875.28] tissue in organs and muscle in the 1970s
[872.68 - 878.44] during heat waves science came up with
[875.28 - 880.72] some information a lot of people were
[878.44 - 883.44] drinking a lot of water during a heat
[880.72 - 885.88] wave they were just guzzling gallons of
[883.44 - 888.52] water throughout the day because it was
[885.88 - 891.28] about staying hydrated it was really hot
[888.52 - 893.56] it was sunny maybe they were in an area
[891.28 - 895.72] without air conditioning a lot of people
[893.56 - 897.96] back in the 70s did not have air
[895.72 - 900.24] conditioning and during heat waves
[897.96 - 902.96] people would eat less l so they wouldn't
[900.24 - 905.76] eat some big old steak dinner with a
[902.96 - 907.72] bunch of salt on it they wouldn't eat
[905.76 - 910.00] some kind of food they wouldn't have
[907.72 - 912.80] pancakes it wouldn't really have much of
[910.00 - 914.88] anything the heat waves rolled in nobody
[912.80 - 917.48] had air conditioning everybody was
[914.88 - 920.20] trying to put ice on themselves from the
[917.48 - 922.72] refrigerator and everybody was drinking
[920.20 - 925.52] lots and lots of water and if somebody
[922.72 - 928.60] didn't drown themselves where they drank
[925.52 - 931.52] way too much more water than their
[928.60 - 934.24] kidney can process more water than their
[931.52 - 936.76] bloodstream can contain and hold and
[934.24 - 938.72] they diluted themselves to such a degree
[936.76 - 940.84] where their lungs filled with water and
[938.72 - 942.92] they drowned if they didn't have that
[940.84 - 945.40] happen and they were able to process
[942.92 - 948.16] that water their kidneys were able to
[945.40 - 950.24] excrete it and they were able to drink
[948.16 - 953.28] couple of gallons a day a few gallons a
[950.24 - 955.96] day during a heat wave then science of
[953.28 - 958.48] research would say you're not retaining
[955.96 - 959.44] the water during a heat wave it's
[958.48 - 962.28] dangerous
[959.44 - 964.32] there's no sodium people are just peeing
[962.28 - 967.12] the water out as it's going in and
[964.32 - 968.60] they're not getting hydrated so science
[967.12 - 971.00] and conventional medicine had two
[968.60 - 973.40] schools of thoughts you need to drink a
[971.00 - 975.68] lot of water when there's a heat wave
[973.40 - 978.48] and you can't drink a lot of water
[975.68 - 981.28] during a heat wave cuz there's no sodium
[978.48 - 983.60] reminds me of sugar we need blood sugar
[981.28 - 985.16] to survive we have to have a certain
[983.60 - 989.00] amount of blood sugar or we can't
[985.16 - 993.08] function or live our brain needs glucose
[989.00 - 995.08] Co sugar within 10 seconds 5 Seconds
[993.08 - 997.96] actually before it starts to die if it
[995.08 - 1001.40] doesn't have it sugar is what makes our
[997.96 - 1004.08] bodies go around but yet there's a
[1001.40 - 1006.52] massive war against sugar this is why
[1004.08 - 1009.64] fruit was under attack for so long
[1006.52 - 1012.24] natural sugar and fruit was under attack
[1009.64 - 1014.96] Fruit fear I talked about it for many
[1012.24 - 1018.92] many years everybody in Alternative
[1014.96 - 1021.12] Health was against fruit they just were
[1018.92 - 1023.80] they called it all sugar and told people
[1021.12 - 1025.88] to stay away from it but if people don't
[1023.80 - 1028.20] eat fruit of any kind where are they
[1025.88 - 1033.40] going to get their glucose what other
[1028.20 - 1036.64] sources lactose from dairy what else
[1033.40 - 1038.68] corn different grains where are they
[1036.64 - 1041.00] getting their sugar they have to get it
[1038.68 - 1043.52] somewhere we have to survive we have to
[1041.00 - 1045.72] live on it we have to have it in our
[1043.52 - 1048.20] bloodstream but the details and the
[1045.72 - 1049.88] nuances are critical in this because
[1048.20 - 1053.08] there's healthy sugars that are
[1049.88 - 1055.44] naturally derived from an apple and then
[1053.08 - 1058.76] there's corn syrup high fructose corn
[1055.44 - 1060.52] syrup there's also other sugars too
[1058.76 - 1062.92] there's honey which is a very healthy
[1060.52 - 1066.20] sugar and then at the same time there's
[1062.92 - 1068.28] lactose Dairy which is not a good sugar
[1066.20 - 1070.32] all these Details Matter for somebody to
[1068.28 - 1072.64] be healthy and to protect your health
[1070.32 - 1074.88] and give them what they need same thing
[1072.64 - 1078.16] with sodium we need it in our
[1074.88 - 1079.96] bloodstream in our organs in our brain
[1078.16 - 1082.40] the details matter there's a big
[1079.96 - 1085.28] difference from coconut water which has
[1082.40 - 1088.12] sodium in it and celery juice which has
[1085.28 - 1092.04] sodium in it and spinach which has
[1088.12 - 1094.12] sodium in it versus road salt or a
[1092.04 - 1096.88] healthier salt like a good Himalayan
[1094.12 - 1098.96] rock salt or a good sea salt there's a
[1096.88 - 1101.28] big difference plus when you drink
[1098.96 - 1103.52] coconut water you can't control the
[1101.28 - 1108.00] amount of sodium in there unless you add
[1103.52 - 1111.00] it to it it's naturally balanced just
[1108.00 - 1114.76] right The Human Condition but when you
[1111.00 - 1117.72] farm salt and you hold on to it in your
[1114.76 - 1120.00] hand you have your free will and control
[1117.72 - 1122.40] you're the one taking it throwing it in
[1120.00 - 1125.68] water you see it's not like cooking a
[1122.40 - 1128.08] water that's nature doing it somebody's
[1125.68 - 1129.84] hand isn't going and throwing salt up on
[1128.08 - 1133.20] the tree and it somehow gets inside that
[1129.84 - 1135.52] coconut it's not it's sealed but we take
[1133.20 - 1137.24] it in our hand our shaker we pinch it
[1135.52 - 1139.76] whatever we want and we throw it right
[1137.24 - 1142.48] into that water it's different than
[1139.76 - 1145.04] adding some sodium to your food the
[1142.48 - 1147.08] sodium going into food gets buffered it
[1145.04 - 1149.96] may not be the best thing you don't want
[1147.08 - 1152.52] a lot of it on there but at the same
[1149.96 - 1155.72] time it is getting buffered to a safety
[1152.52 - 1158.00] zone unless it's so much salt it makes
[1155.72 - 1160.68] things complicated now if you take honey
[1158.00 - 1162.48] for example do a tablespoon of honey
[1160.68 - 1164.56] because you got your free will you got
[1162.48 - 1166.52] the jar of honey you're not just doing a
[1164.56 - 1168.88] teaspoon you're digging in and doing a
[1166.52 - 1170.52] big old tablespoon in your cup of tea
[1168.88 - 1173.56] that's your free will doing it or you're
[1170.52 - 1176.24] going to get in trouble not like salt
[1173.56 - 1179.16] take a tablespoon of salt dump it in
[1176.24 - 1181.04] that glass of water and send it down
[1179.16 - 1183.40] there's a huge difference take a
[1181.04 - 1187.48] tablespoon of honey put it in your mouth
[1183.40 - 1190.28] Chomp on it swallow it eat it it's
[1187.48 - 1192.84] different you take a tablespoon of salt
[1190.28 - 1194.48] put it in your mouth and sit there and
[1192.84 - 1197.68] Chomp on it and Chomp on it and then
[1194.48 - 1199.88] swallow it and eat it you'll see two
[1197.68 - 1202.16] different beasts but let's talk about
[1199.88 - 1204.36] saltwater gargling that's a different
[1202.16 - 1206.36] thing all on its own I like it for
[1204.36 - 1208.48] certain things somebody has something
[1206.36 - 1211.04] like an ulcer in their mouth they can do
[1208.48 - 1213.68] some saltwater gargling but understand
[1211.04 - 1216.80] this if you make it nice and thick with
[1213.68 - 1219.88] salt little glass of warm water you put
[1216.80 - 1222.76] a good tablespoon or more salt in there
[1219.88 - 1225.12] you mix it up until it disappears and
[1222.76 - 1227.00] then you gargle with it you're not going
[1225.12 - 1228.84] to want to swallow all of that you're
[1227.00 - 1230.52] not going to want to drink that with all
[1228.84 - 1233.12] the salt in there because there's a good
[1230.52 - 1235.48] chance you're going to vomit it back up
[1233.12 - 1238.24] because your body has a mechanism it
[1235.48 - 1240.20] knows it's trouble it knows it's
[1238.24 - 1242.76] problematic and it doesn't want it going
[1240.20 - 1245.84] down and you end up getting a
[1242.76 - 1247.88] reflex your brain gets a message sends
[1245.84 - 1250.68] it right down to the Vegas nerves your
[1247.88 - 1253.36] Vegas nerves say no and that stuff comes
[1250.68 - 1255.24] right back up but when you're gargling
[1253.36 - 1257.56] you're really not supposed to swallow it
[1255.24 - 1259.88] you're not you're supposed to spit it
[1257.56 - 1261.92] back out and rinse your mouth out just
[1259.88 - 1264.12] like when you're on a ship floating Out
[1261.92 - 1266.08] on the Ocean and you ran out of your
[1264.12 - 1269.60] water supply you're not supposed to be
[1266.08 - 1272.08] sitting there drinking flasks of water
[1269.60 - 1275.12] that came out of the ocean salt water
[1272.08 - 1277.44] you can garl it but you can't swallow it
[1275.12 - 1281.48] but yet once again our bodies need
[1277.44 - 1284.60] sodium they do and some people they
[1281.48 - 1287.40] fight an addiction because of it because
[1284.60 - 1290.52] yeah we do need it but yet we get
[1287.40 - 1294.88] addicted to it and our favorite way to
[1290.52 - 1301.28] eat salt is with oil especially on chips
[1294.88 - 1303.60] salty oily salty greasy salt and fat
[1301.28 - 1305.76] it's our favorite combination and what
[1303.60 - 1310.20] happens is the fat cuts the
[1305.76 - 1315.44] salt that's right the fat cuts the salt
[1310.20 - 1319.60] hides it just enough we love that fatty
[1315.44 - 1322.92] salty crunchy taste we're the only
[1319.60 - 1324.96] creature on the planet that adds salt to
[1322.92 - 1327.56] everything all the other creatures on
[1324.96 - 1329.72] the planet they're not doing that you
[1327.56 - 1332.56] think a family of bunny rabbits are
[1329.72 - 1335.08] sitting there saying pass the salt hey
[1332.56 - 1337.92] let me have those few Blades of grass
[1335.08 - 1340.64] get some salt on this thing it's bland
[1337.92 - 1343.76] what about a lion lion wants some animal
[1340.64 - 1345.96] meat is that lion saying Oo we need some
[1343.76 - 1348.88] salt cracked on top of this meat right
[1345.96 - 1351.44] here it's not salty enough I want to
[1348.88 - 1353.48] have my meat salt to taste and what
[1351.44 - 1356.16] about a monkey that likes to eat wild
[1353.48 - 1359.04] figs is that monkey saying this fig
[1356.16 - 1361.44] needs salt whoa I'm eating a bunch of
[1359.04 - 1364.00] figs I feel like I need some salt here
[1361.44 - 1367.32] please pass the salt somebody what about
[1364.00 - 1369.44] a bear bears eat some meat too they're
[1367.32 - 1372.72] not asking for the salt they're not
[1369.44 - 1374.92] craving the salt they're not saying hey
[1372.72 - 1377.00] this piece of meat that I just killed
[1374.92 - 1380.44] this animal that I just killed needs a
[1377.00 - 1383.08] whole bunch of salt it's too land jucky
[1380.44 - 1386.20] don't get mistaken when you hear
[1383.08 - 1389.48] something about a rock salt deposit
[1386.20 - 1392.32] somewhere on a Mountaintop that an
[1389.48 - 1395.40] animal went up to and licked and that
[1392.32 - 1397.64] was all of a sudden the answer to it all
[1395.40 - 1400.68] first of all it's a big planet there's
[1397.64 - 1403.48] not a lot of options for that salt just
[1400.68 - 1405.96] isn't everywhere laying everywhere
[1403.48 - 1409.44] totally exposed ready for every animal
[1405.96 - 1412.44] to lick it very few Wild animals on this
[1409.44 - 1415.36] planet have access to a salt deposit on
[1412.44 - 1417.96] a Mountaintop somewhere on this planet
[1415.36 - 1420.56] and when it comes to a when it comes to
[1417.96 - 1424.52] raising animals for Slaughter or raising
[1420.56 - 1427.68] animals in general for sale and so forth
[1424.52 - 1429.20] what happens is they do the salt thing
[1427.68 - 1432.08] for salt
[1429.20 - 1434.88] addiction they salt up the pigs so pigs
[1432.08 - 1438.52] eat more and more the fatter the bigger
[1434.88 - 1441.84] the pig can win an award the same thing
[1438.52 - 1445.44] thing with anything cows and so forth
[1441.84 - 1447.92] fatten up the cows sell more meat
[1445.44 - 1451.08] thicken up the steers then you can sell
[1447.92 - 1454.72] them price per pound get them addicted
[1451.08 - 1457.48] to sodium they sell salt blocks blocks
[1454.72 - 1460.48] of salt they want animals to take a lick
[1457.48 - 1463.20] if possible because steers can get fussy
[1460.48 - 1467.52] with their food if the steer gets too
[1463.20 - 1469.84] lean it's not good farmer is mad they
[1467.52 - 1472.40] salt the food they want them to lick the
[1469.84 - 1474.84] salt blocks it makes them hungry gets
[1472.40 - 1477.56] them addicted to more food then they can
[1474.84 - 1481.24] feed them more thicken them up and sell
[1477.56 - 1484.12] them package food companies for humans
[1481.24 - 1487.12] put a lot of salt in there plus MSG
[1484.12 - 1490.40] people like it they eat more they get
[1487.12 - 1492.96] addicted they fatten up they want to eat
[1490.40 - 1496.08] more they buy it again and again and
[1492.96 - 1498.84] again same old trick restaurants put the
[1496.08 - 1501.24] salt in the food people love it
[1498.84 - 1504.12] they come in more and more they eat more
[1501.24 - 1506.52] of it they go to a big old open Buffet
[1504.12 - 1509.16] they eat all they can eat the salt makes
[1506.52 - 1512.00] them nice and hungry everybody's happy
[1509.16 - 1514.68] that's how it rolls back centuries ago
[1512.00 - 1517.72] when salt was for sale and it was a big
[1514.68 - 1520.12] deal it was for preserving because
[1517.72 - 1523.08] people didn't have a way to preserve the
[1520.12 - 1525.48] either fermented food or salted things
[1523.08 - 1529.24] fermented things or salted things or
[1525.48 - 1531.88] dried things fermented salted dried it
[1529.24 - 1534.84] was a survival tactic doesn't mean it's
[1531.88 - 1538.16] great doesn't mean it's good but it was
[1534.84 - 1542.40] a survival method and it became a
[1538.16 - 1545.88] commodity on sale for sale for centuries
[1542.40 - 1548.32] and an addiction people got addicted to
[1545.88 - 1550.92] their sodium to their salt and people
[1548.32 - 1553.36] still are now every day it's even in
[1550.92 - 1556.52] coffee people don't realize it but they
[1553.36 - 1558.72] put a little salt in coffee shops now
[1556.52 - 1561.44] you don't know it it's in the machine be
[1558.72 - 1564.60] in some places it's in the water in some
[1561.44 - 1568.48] places it's there to make the cup of
[1564.60 - 1570.56] coffee little salty it all makes it
[1568.48 - 1573.00] better but it keeps people addicted and
[1570.56 - 1575.92] they go back to their coffee shops there
[1573.00 - 1578.32] are people out there that try unsalted
[1575.92 - 1581.44] butter but let's face it how good is
[1578.32 - 1583.32] that have you had unsalted butter at all
[1581.44 - 1585.20] did you ever take a piece of toast take
[1583.32 - 1587.84] unsalted butter put it on that piece of
[1585.20 - 1590.24] toast and eat it what did it taste like
[1587.84 - 1591.84] not as good as the salted butter now
[1590.24 - 1594.36] there's people out there that are back
[1591.84 - 1598.12] to the land they're actually churning
[1594.36 - 1600.68] their own butter they're raising animals
[1598.12 - 1603.52] they're doing it all but guess what they
[1600.68 - 1605.24] also have a bag of salt in the kitchen
[1603.52 - 1607.68] and they're adding it to their food for
[1605.24 - 1609.64] their children and for their husbands
[1607.68 - 1613.40] and for their families they're still
[1609.64 - 1616.40] using salt every single day even if
[1613.40 - 1619.88] they're not making salted butter the
[1616.40 - 1622.48] salt addiction is real but it's okay to
[1619.88 - 1623.92] have a little bit of a high quality salt
[1622.48 - 1626.76] it's okay to put a little bit on your
[1623.92 - 1629.60] food it dilutes it enough it buffers it
[1626.76 - 1633.24] enough it's not liver shock like when
[1629.60 - 1635.76] you're dumping it in water so people
[1633.24 - 1637.80] love their sodium they love their salt
[1635.76 - 1640.04] and our bloodstream needs it but what
[1637.80 - 1643.96] our bloodstream and our organs really
[1640.04 - 1647.56] cry for is sodium that's naturally
[1643.96 - 1649.68] derived in something like an herb
[1647.56 - 1654.80] there's a little bit of sodium in fresh
[1649.68 - 1658.16] herbs cilantro Parsley Sage thyme just a
[1654.80 - 1660.44] little bit of sodium in
[1658.16 - 1662.56] spirina that's one all on its own
[1660.44 - 1665.08] there's a little bit of sodium in barley
[1662.56 - 1670.20] grass juice powder there's a little bit
[1665.08 - 1672.72] of sodium in tomatoes in lemons and
[1670.20 - 1676.04] there's a decent amount of sodium in
[1672.72 - 1679.16] celery and coconut water when you use
[1676.04 - 1683.04] these forms of sodium they're bonded
[1679.16 - 1685.28] bonded trace minerals that hold out they
[1683.04 - 1687.36] become hold outs what does that mean
[1685.28 - 1689.88] they stay in the blood stream and they
