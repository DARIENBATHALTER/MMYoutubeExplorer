[1.28 - 7.76] How many people do you know who struggle
[4.32 - 10.24] with their health? Chances are, whether
[7.76 - 14.56] they show it or not, most of the people
[10.24 - 17.64] in your life do. And chances are, you're
[14.56 - 20.80] one of them. Whether you're dealing with
[17.64 - 25.04] anxiety, depression, endometriosis,
[20.80 - 28.00] acne, eczema, autoimmune, thyroid, lime,
[25.04 - 31.32] brain fog, fatigue, or any other symptom
[28.00 - 34.48] or condition, you're far from
[31.32 - 37.76] alone. Living with symptoms has become
[34.48 - 41.44] the new normal. So, no more guessing
[37.76 - 43.84] games. It's time to get answers. Welcome
[41.44 - 45.68] to the Medical Medium Podcast. I'm
[43.84 - 48.04] Anthony William.
[45.68 - 51.44] We're talking about geoengineering,
[48.04 - 53.84] chemtrails, weather modification, or all
[51.44 - 56.88] of the above. Cuz guess what? They're
[53.84 - 59.52] all connected. And they work handinand
[56.88 - 62.64] with each other. And the great powers
[59.52 - 65.60] that run this world are weaponizing all
[62.64 - 69.12] of those. The umbrella gets bigger and
[65.60 - 71.76] bigger. Carbon dioxide removal, solar
[69.12 - 74.80] radiation modification, reflecting
[71.76 - 77.56] sunlight to try to cool down the planet.
[74.80 - 79.92] since we have something called global
[77.56 - 82.40] warming. Or so they think we have
[79.92 - 84.56] something called global warming, but now
[82.40 - 87.36] it's called climate change. Climate
[84.56 - 89.76] change. Climate change. Meanwhile, these
[87.36 - 91.52] are just distractions. So, we look over
[89.76 - 94.80] there when they're doing something
[91.52 - 95.64] really evil over there. Call it what you
[94.80 - 98.16] want.
[95.64 - 101.52] Geoengineering, climate engineering,
[98.16 - 103.60] weather modification, cloud seeding. But
[101.52 - 107.44] in the end, there's something dirty
[103.60 - 110.72] going on and evil and nasty. There are
[107.44 - 113.68] secret missions. Military jets spraying
[110.72 - 116.32] metals bury them. All kinds of trails,
[113.68 - 118.48] chemtrails everywhere, different planes,
[116.32 - 121.12] different jets spraying chemtrails
[118.48 - 124.32] everywhere. It's all up in the sky. It's
[121.12 - 127.20] every day, every hour, every minute, all
[124.32 - 130.24] around the globe. The truth is, nobody
[127.20 - 133.12] really knows what's going on. No body of
[130.24 - 135.68] government, no official seems to
[133.12 - 138.56] understand what's being sprayed, what
[135.68 - 140.36] the purpose is. Is it geoengineering? Is
[138.56 - 143.04] it something else? Is it weather
[140.36 - 145.20] modification? Are military jets really
[143.04 - 147.36] spraying things? Are other jets really
[145.20 - 150.08] spraying things? Is it contrails? Is it
[147.36 - 153.12] all a conspiracy? Is it all just under
[150.08 - 155.84] one big huge geoengineering umbrella?
[153.12 - 157.60] Nobody really knows. In this episode,
[155.84 - 159.44] we're getting down to the nitty-gritty,
[157.60 - 160.88] the bottom of it. We're going to make
[159.44 - 162.56] sense out of what you're seeing in the
[160.88 - 165.12] sky. And you're going to see the
[162.56 - 167.68] connection between geoengineering and
[165.12 - 169.52] military jets dropping barium and other
[167.68 - 171.92] planes out there spraying all kinds of
[169.52 - 173.52] trails and helicopters spraying all
[171.92 - 175.76] kinds of spray. We're going to talk
[173.52 - 177.76] about it all. Get ready for the ride.
[175.76 - 182.44] Fasten your seat belts on this one.
[177.76 - 182.44] We're taking a chemtrail flight.
[207.20 - 214.40] They keep on spraying every day. They
[210.48 - 217.60] never stop. And who's they? Nobody
[214.40 - 220.44] really knows. Is it the military? Nobody
[217.60 - 224.40] really knows. Is it private military
[220.44 - 225.72] contractors? Nobody really knows. Is it
[224.40 - 228.24] Is it private
[225.72 - 230.40] organizations? Nobody really knows. But
[228.24 - 234.24] what's really obvious at this point in
[230.40 - 238.72] time is there are airplanes, jets in the
[234.24 - 241.12] sky way up there spraying something,
[238.72 - 242.72] releasing something. So there's a lot of
[241.12 - 245.60] guessing out there to what they're
[242.72 - 247.16] releasing to what they're spraying. Some
[245.60 - 249.20] say it's weather
[247.16 - 251.92] modification. A lot of people think it's
[249.20 - 253.76] part of a program geoengineering where
[251.92 - 257.20] different metals are being released in
[253.76 - 259.72] the sky, for example, barerium. So, it
[257.20 - 262.96] reflects the sunlight, alters the
[259.72 - 264.48] weather, alters the atmosphere. It's set
[262.96 - 266.96] up to begin with where no one is
[264.48 - 268.56] supposed to notice it. No one is
[266.96 - 270.16] supposed to know what's happening.
[268.56 - 273.44] Everybody is supposed to believe that
[270.16 - 275.92] it's just contrails. Yeah, contrails.
[273.44 - 278.32] Moisture in the engine, the plane or the
[275.92 - 281.76] jet is going up. It's going up and up
[278.32 - 284.00] and up. It's colder up there in the sky.
[281.76 - 286.72] The moisture in the engine and the heat
[284.00 - 288.64] leaves a trail, condensation, and
[286.72 - 290.00] nobody's supposed to know about it. No
[288.64 - 291.84] one is supposed to believe it's
[290.00 - 294.80] anything. It's just supposed to happen
[291.84 - 297.60] day in and day out. Not just every day,
[294.80 - 300.88] not just every month, not just every
[297.60 - 302.56] year, but how about since the 60s?
[300.88 - 305.28] Everybody's supposed to be going about
[302.56 - 307.04] their business and not seeing it, not
[305.28 - 309.20] knowing what's going on, but it's
[307.04 - 311.72] happening above them. That's the goal
[309.20 - 314.48] anyway. But over the years, people have
[311.72 - 316.88] noticed. And now with the internet,
[314.48 - 319.20] social media, and then the fact that
[316.88 - 323.04] everybody has cameras in their hands,
[319.20 - 326.32] and there are more trails in the sky,
[323.04 - 329.12] more spray trails, more chemtrails than
[326.32 - 332.16] ever before since the ' 60s, '7s, 80s,
[329.12 - 334.56] and '90s. More than ever now. It's
[332.16 - 336.96] become quite obvious something's wrong.
[334.56 - 339.76] I've been talking about it for decades.
[336.96 - 342.16] I did a podcast about it years ago. I
[339.76 - 344.48] dedicated a chapter into one of my books
[342.16 - 347.04] and I've been one of the voices that's
[344.48 - 348.48] made a contribution in getting the
[347.04 - 351.28] information out there of what's going
[348.48 - 353.68] on. Even if it meant more censorship
[351.28 - 356.96] because of it. So the talk of the town
[353.68 - 358.80] isn't chemtrails, it's geoengineering.
[356.96 - 363.40] Chemtrails is supposed to be all
[358.80 - 365.36] conspiracy, a theory, all fake. And even
[363.40 - 368.56] geoengineering is supposed to be a
[365.36 - 370.72] conspiracy, a theory, and all fake. But
[368.56 - 373.28] yet it's more acceptable to believe that
[370.72 - 376.08] they're doing geoengineering because
[373.28 - 379.80] there is such a thing as geoengineering
[376.08 - 381.68] and climate engineering and weather
[379.80 - 383.48] modification. And even though it's a
[381.68 - 387.12] real thing, it's supposed to be
[383.48 - 389.12] offlimits private classified. So much
[387.12 - 392.00] so, no one really knows where the
[389.12 - 394.80] funding to create it goes. Nobody knows
[392.00 - 396.84] who's being funded. In reality, nobody
[394.80 - 399.60] knows who's really doing it, who's
[396.84 - 402.08] responsible, who's behind it. It's all
[399.60 - 404.80] kind of up in the air. But what public
[402.08 - 407.12] authorities are learning is that
[404.80 - 411.04] something's being sprayed out of jets up
[407.12 - 413.84] in the sky above the states, above towns
[411.04 - 416.16] and cities. And it's under the guise of
[413.84 - 419.04] weather modification. It's under the
[416.16 - 421.52] guise of geoengineering. In America,
[419.04 - 424.00] some states are trying to pass laws.
[421.52 - 426.88] They're passing laws so that weather
[424.00 - 429.92] modification can't occur above their
[426.88 - 431.84] sky, above their state. Public
[429.92 - 434.00] authorities are trying to stop the
[431.84 - 436.48] spraying. They're sick of seeing it
[434.00 - 439.28] happen day in and day out up there.
[436.48 - 441.28] They're sick of having a cookout or a
[439.28 - 444.80] birthday party for their child and
[441.28 - 447.92] looking up in the sky and seeing 30, 40,
[444.80 - 450.64] to even 100 strips across the sky that
[447.92 - 453.24] are unnatural. They're not clouds.
[450.64 - 455.68] They're coming from jets and public
[453.24 - 457.64] officials don't want this stuff dumped
[455.68 - 460.12] on their children and on their families
[457.64 - 462.96] anymore. They don't want these unknown
[460.12 - 465.28] chemicals falling out of the sky on
[462.96 - 467.52] their families. So, some public
[465.28 - 471.12] officials in the United States are
[467.52 - 472.76] trying to alter the law in the states,
[471.12 - 475.72] saying it can't be done in their
[472.76 - 478.08] airspace. Passing new laws to stop
[475.72 - 480.56] geoengineering. Passing new laws to stop
[478.08 - 483.12] weather modification, trying to change
[480.56 - 485.32] the course of history, trying to stop
[483.12 - 488.24] chemicals from pouring out of planes
[485.32 - 490.16] purposely to alter the weather or for
[488.24 - 492.48] any other reason. But it's not going to
[490.16 - 494.64] be an easy task even though it's a noble
[492.48 - 497.00] one because there's a lot of problems
[494.64 - 499.24] involved with chemtrails. That's right,
[497.00 - 501.92] chemtrails. It's not just weather
[499.24 - 504.88] modification. And who's doing it? Is it
[501.92 - 507.56] the military? That's who's doing it? Is
[504.88 - 510.52] it private contractors? Is it a private
[507.56 - 513.36] organization? And where are the planes
[510.52 - 516.72] landing? Where are they landing? It
[513.36 - 518.92] takes us to another talk all about how
[516.72 - 521.60] many planes there are. And are
[518.92 - 525.12] geoengineering planes different than
[521.60 - 526.80] chemtrail planes? The truth is there's
[525.12 - 529.04] more planes up there doing different
[526.80 - 532.32] things. There's more organizations
[529.04 - 534.72] behind it. Geoengineering could be one.
[532.32 - 537.44] Regular chemtrails could be another.
[534.72 - 540.24] Massive insecticide campaigns going on
[537.44 - 542.64] with helicopters flying at night,
[540.24 - 545.52] dumping it all over villages, towns,
[542.64 - 548.56] cities, states, and of course,
[545.52 - 550.40] mysterious drones that are up in the sky
[548.56 - 552.56] releasing something out of little tanks
[550.40 - 554.88] attached to the drones. Let's just put
[552.56 - 557.20] it this way. There are a lot of things
[554.88 - 560.08] flying in the air that are spraying
[557.20 - 563.04] stuff on everybody. really simplifying
[560.08 - 565.44] it. is falling out of the sky and
[563.04 - 568.52] evil people are doing it. So, let's talk
[565.44 - 572.00] about the planes, the jets. There are
[568.52 - 574.48] thousands, not just 10 or 20 of them or
[572.00 - 577.44] hundreds of them, but thousands and not
[574.48 - 580.80] just thousands, tens of thousands of
[577.44 - 583.64] jets and planes in the sky that have no
[580.80 - 587.20] passengers on there. Meaning, they got
[583.64 - 589.28] pilots but no passengers. They're not
[587.20 - 592.00] commercial flights. They're not filled
[589.28 - 595.92] with 100 people, 50 people, or two, 300
[592.00 - 597.96] people. They are empty. They're empty,
[595.92 - 601.68] but yet filled. They're filled with
[597.96 - 604.56] tanks. The tanks are in place of the
[601.68 - 608.08] seats of people. Sometimes it's just two
[604.56 - 611.12] or three extremely large tanks on a jet.
[608.08 - 613.68] And sometimes it's a lot of small tanks.
[611.12 - 615.60] And the seats have all been ripped out.
[613.68 - 617.84] They've all been ripped out. And in
[615.60 - 620.24] place of the seats are the tanks. And
[617.84 - 622.48] the tanks are bolted into the jet. And
[620.24 - 624.96] then the tanks are filled up. They're
[622.48 - 628.48] filled up every day. They're filled up
[624.96 - 632.48] every hour, every minute, because there
[628.48 - 635.20] are tens of thousands and hundreds of
[632.48 - 637.36] thousands and millions of these planes
[635.20 - 639.76] all around the world, these jets all
[637.36 - 642.64] around the world. And the tanks inside
[639.76 - 645.52] of these planes and jets are tanks full
[642.64 - 647.92] of chemicals. And get ready for this
[645.52 - 649.84] unknown chemicals. It's not that
[647.92 - 652.32] anybody's getting informed about what's
[649.84 - 654.48] being dumped on them. It's not that you
[652.32 - 657.04] go to school or you go to university,
[654.48 - 659.04] you go to college and you learn, okay,
[657.04 - 661.04] here's the chemtrail program. Here's
[659.04 - 663.36] what they're putting into the tanks.
[661.04 - 665.64] Here's what they're dumping on you.
[663.36 - 668.56] Check it out. Here's the patented
[665.64 - 670.24] chemicals. This is the ones we're using.
[668.56 - 673.20] None of that. We're not supposed to know
[670.24 - 675.68] anything. And if anybody questions it,
[673.20 - 678.88] it's a conspiracy theory. You got a
[675.68 - 680.84] tinfoil hat. You're a nut. Something's
[678.88 - 682.80] wrong with you. You're just making up
[680.84 - 685.36] stories. What you're talking about
[682.80 - 688.64] doesn't really exist. Or you're just a
[685.36 - 690.32] paranoid crazy prepper. Meanwhile, what
[688.64 - 692.16] they're doing and what they're doing up
[690.32 - 693.84] in the sky and the chemicals that
[692.16 - 697.28] they're dropping on everybody is a
[693.84 - 699.68] crime. It's a crime on humanity. It's a
[697.28 - 703.28] crime to humanity. And it's a crime
[699.68 - 705.36] against humanity, an evil, evil one. And
[703.28 - 707.20] it happens like clockwork every single
[705.36 - 708.88] hour, every single day. What's
[707.20 - 710.88] interesting is you have all these tens
[708.88 - 713.36] of thousands of planes doing it all day
[710.88 - 715.68] long up in the sky, every minute and
[713.36 - 718.88] every hour. But yet, not one of those
[715.68 - 721.44] jets, not one of those planes lands in a
[718.88 - 723.68] commercial airport. Yet, they have to
[721.44 - 725.68] land somewhere. Where are they landing?
[723.68 - 728.56] They're not landing in any commercial
[725.68 - 731.44] airport anywhere in the United States.
[728.56 - 733.52] There's tens of thousands of them, even
[731.44 - 735.92] hundreds of thousands of them up in the
[733.52 - 738.00] sky. Where are they going? Where are
[735.92 - 740.48] they landing? They have to be landing
[738.00 - 745.52] somewhere. And they are. They're landing
[740.48 - 747.92] on private land or governmentowned land,
[745.52 - 751.44] federal land. And we're not just talking
[747.92 - 753.68] about one airport or two airports or
[751.44 - 756.08] three airports. We're talking about
[753.68 - 759.12] hundreds of them all around the United
[756.08 - 761.76] States. and thousands of them all around
[759.12 - 763.68] the globe. All top secret, all
[761.76 - 766.80] classified. So, let's talk about the
[763.68 - 770.24] money it must cost to actually pilot
[766.80 - 773.32] those planes. The money it must cost to
[770.24 - 776.56] fuel those planes and to keep the upkeep
[773.32 - 779.28] going, to maintain those planes, house
[776.56 - 782.24] them, store them. And think about the
[779.28 - 785.88] money involved in the chemicals to
[782.24 - 789.12] loading them up, trucking them to the
[785.88 - 791.52] airports, filling the planes. How many
[789.12 - 793.68] people are employed? We're not talking
[791.52 - 795.44] about millions of dollars. And we're not
[793.68 - 797.68] talking about billions of dollars
[795.44 - 800.32] either. We're talking about in the
[797.68 - 802.64] trillions and how many years, how many
[800.32 - 804.96] decades, all the way going to the 1960s
[802.64 - 808.04] when it started. And where were these
[804.96 - 811.52] jets and planes manufactured? Who made
[808.04 - 814.00] them? Who manufactured them? What kind
[811.52 - 817.04] are they? What do they all cost? Because
[814.00 - 819.36] it's not 10 planes. It's not 10 jets.
[817.04 - 822.08] It's not a 100 jets. It's not a thousand
[819.36 - 824.04] jets. It's tens of thousands. It's
[822.08 - 826.96] hundreds of thousands. It's millions
[824.04 - 829.88] worldwide. What did that cost? And what
[826.96 - 832.40] about the airports, the air control
[829.88 - 834.40] towers? What about each one having its
[832.40 - 836.40] own air control tower? What did that
[834.40 - 838.48] cost? because it's not the same thing
[836.40 - 840.64] with commercial airports and commercial
[838.48 - 843.68] planes. The other thing that's really
[840.64 - 845.60] interesting is chemtrail planes. Yes,
[843.68 - 847.28] chemtrail planes, you can call them
[845.60 - 848.72] geoengineering as well. And we'll kind
[847.28 - 851.72] of talk about the difference between
[848.72 - 854.88] them, but chemtrail planes and
[851.72 - 858.28] geoengineering planes that are spraying
[854.88 - 863.12] every day out there, they're at a lower
[858.28 - 866.32] altitude. They fly at about 20,000 ft.
[863.12 - 869.84] It's interesting. Commercial airliners
[866.32 - 873.04] fly roughly around 30,000 and private
[869.84 - 877.28] jets, small private jets fly roughly
[873.04 - 879.76] around 40 to 45,000 ft. Chemtrol planes
[877.28 - 882.08] are the lowest ones. They're the ones
[879.76 - 884.08] flying low and they're dumping the
[882.08 - 886.16] chemicals. So, the chemicals fall on
[884.08 - 888.72] everybody. I've been on commercial
[886.16 - 891.88] airline planes and I've watched through
[888.72 - 894.72] the window as the plane is
[891.88 - 897.60] descending going right into a chemtrail
[894.72 - 899.36] that was somewhere around 20,000 ft. No
[897.60 - 901.56] matter how you slice the pie, they're
[899.36 - 904.04] all chemtrails.
[901.56 - 907.12] Geoengineering is supposed to be
[904.04 - 909.32] barerium, reflective metal. When dropped
[907.12 - 912.48] out of the sky, it's supposed to reflect
[909.32 - 915.84] sunlight, cool down the planet, stop
[912.48 - 917.80] global warming. That's the goal anyway.
[915.84 - 919.68] Climate engineering,
[917.80 - 922.00] geoengineering. But really, it's more
[919.68 - 925.84] than that. And nobody knows because no
[922.00 - 927.60] one's ever got their hands on a batch of
[925.84 - 931.28] this stuff that's being dropped out of
[927.60 - 933.60] the sky, being shot out of the planes.
[931.28 - 936.40] It's not like anyone has access to any
[933.60 - 939.60] of it. It's not like there's a container
[936.40 - 941.68] you can buy and study it or some kind of
[939.60 - 944.24] public authority can look at it and see
[941.68 - 946.24] what it is. It's all mystery. It's all
[944.24 - 948.64] top secret. It's all classified. You
[946.24 - 951.20] can't just walk into a store, a hardware
[948.64 - 954.64] store, or go into some other type of
[951.20 - 957.12] construction store and say, "Can you
[954.64 - 959.92] direct me to the aisle where you can get
[957.12 - 962.40] a container of what they're dropping out
[959.92 - 964.48] of the planes on us every single day?" I
[962.40 - 965.92] think it's maybe barerium. I really
[964.48 - 967.20] don't know what it is. Is there any
[965.92 - 970.48] containers? Oh, here they are right
[967.20 - 972.88] here. Let's see. for chemtrails for
[970.48 - 975.28] classified use. Let me turn this bottle
[972.88 - 979.96] around and look at the ingredient list.
[975.28 - 982.32] H bar berium, mercury, lead, arsenic,
[979.96 - 984.88] aluminum. It's just not going to happen.
[982.32 - 987.36] It doesn't exist. Nobody knows what it
[984.88 - 989.76] is that they're dropping on people or
[987.36 - 992.64] really what it is. Let's talk about
[989.76 - 994.88] geoengineering versus chemtrails. Well,
[992.64 - 996.48] for one, it's all chemtrail because it's
[994.88 - 999.12] all being dropped out of planes, shot
[996.48 - 1001.68] out of planes, injected out of planes,
[999.12 - 1004.64] out of jets on everybody. But there is a
[1001.68 - 1007.36] slight difference. Geoengineering is
[1004.64 - 1008.96] supposed to be militarybased. And maybe
[1007.36 - 1010.56] it's not because guess what? People
[1008.96 - 1012.96] still don't know the definitive answers
[1010.56 - 1014.72] to that either. Not even public
[1012.96 - 1017.00] authorities really have direct answers
[1014.72 - 1020.56] on that. But it's supposed to be
[1017.00 - 1022.72] military military jets releasing some
[1020.56 - 1025.44] kind of mystery chemicals that are
[1022.72 - 1028.16] somewhat saving the planet somehow
[1025.44 - 1030.48] involved with weather modification,
[1028.16 - 1033.04] changing the weather, altering it so
[1030.48 - 1035.68] crops can get better so rain can be
[1033.04 - 1037.96] dispersed in other areas so it helps
[1035.68 - 1040.00] protect the planet. But that's not
[1037.96 - 1043.16] truth. That's not what's really
[1040.00 - 1045.44] happening. It's way more sinister.
[1043.16 - 1047.76] geoengineering, the release of dangerous
[1045.44 - 1050.56] chemicals out of planes every single day
[1047.76 - 1053.92] are for other reasons, for destructive
[1050.56 - 1055.60] reasons, for despicable evil reasons.
[1053.92 - 1057.96] Has nothing to do with saving the
[1055.60 - 1060.32] planet. And it's its own
[1057.96 - 1062.24] organization. And with geoengineering,
[1060.32 - 1064.96] the planes are usually different. The
[1062.24 - 1069.52] jets are usually different. They're more
[1064.96 - 1072.88] cargo style, military style, cargo jets,
[1069.52 - 1075.36] cargo planes. Different than rogue
[1072.88 - 1080.52] chemtrail planes. What are rogue
[1075.36 - 1084.56] chemtrail planes? TWWA planes. Panam
[1080.52 - 1085.56] planes. Old retired beat up old
[1084.56 - 1088.08] commercial
[1085.56 - 1090.96] airliners that aren't supposed to even
[1088.08 - 1094.76] be flying anymore. even as old as the '
[1090.96 - 1098.08] 50s, the 1960s, the 1970s,
[1094.76 - 1100.96] 80s,9s. Many of them refurbished. Many
[1098.08 - 1103.76] of them just were purchased in auction
[1100.96 - 1106.24] or privately purchased. And also new
[1103.76 - 1109.20] planes, too, brand new ones being
[1106.24 - 1111.84] manufactured for purposes of chemtrails.
[1109.20 - 1116.00] And who's manufacturing them at that
[1111.84 - 1119.04] level? How many? How's it possible? And
[1116.00 - 1121.16] how much money are we talking about? And
[1119.04 - 1123.84] how huge, how big are these
[1121.16 - 1126.32] organizations? They're massive. Now,
[1123.84 - 1128.88] this geoengineering chemtrail episode is
[1126.32 - 1130.96] going to be one of many in a series
[1128.88 - 1134.24] because there's lots of ground to cover,
[1130.96 - 1136.40] lots of information, a lot of details,
[1134.24 - 1139.20] including information on how to protect
[1136.40 - 1142.08] yourself and your families, and how to
[1139.20 - 1144.16] cleanse and eliminate the metals and
[1142.08 - 1147.20] toxins that they're dumping out of the
[1144.16 - 1149.76] planes onto everyone. along with how to
[1147.20 - 1152.08] keep the immune system strong and how to
[1149.76 - 1154.40] keep emotionally strong while
[1152.08 - 1156.40] understanding and being aware of what
[1154.40 - 1158.76] they're doing and what's happening up in
[1156.40 - 1162.16] the sky. So stay tuned for the next

[1193.04 - 1200.96] old are you? 25. Yeah, I'm 24. We
[1196.56 - 1203.68] partied last night like it was 1999.
[1200.96 - 1208.72] Yeah, that was crazy. Let's sit out on
[1203.68 - 1211.28] the porch, get some air. Ah, chemtrails.
[1208.72 - 1212.96] Oh, look at that one. Oh, those are
[1211.28 - 1215.32] beautiful, aren't they? Oh, look.
[1212.96 - 1217.84] Rainbow colored chemtrails. Ooh, purple
[1215.32 - 1219.92] chemtrails. Oh, they're so great. You
[1217.84 - 1221.84] know what I love about these chemtrails?
[1219.92 - 1225.04] The world governments are really looking
[1221.84 - 1227.84] out for us. No, I know. Because those
[1225.04 - 1230.80] chemtrails, they're saving the planet.
[1227.84 - 1232.88] Yeah. Isn't that amazing? They're saving
[1230.80 - 1235.28] climate change. Yeah, they're fixing our
[1232.88 - 1236.88] climate problems. I know. Oh, that's a
[1235.28 - 1240.16] pretty one there. Oh, don't you love
[1236.88 - 1244.08] when they're X's? X. Look, another X.
[1240.16 - 1247.84] Ooh, another X. X X X in the sky. Kind
[1244.08 - 1250.00] of like 666, right? Oh, I don't know.
[1247.84 - 1252.96] Hey, remember the old ban many, many
[1250.00 - 1254.88] years ago when states try to stop it? Oh
[1252.96 - 1257.36] my god, we're taught in schools. Did you
[1254.88 - 1258.88] hear that your university? That that was
[1257.36 - 1261.44] terrible that time when they're trying
[1258.88 - 1264.24] to ban him over all those years ago. I
[1261.44 - 1266.96] know. I know. Now we know better. Thank
[1264.24 - 1268.56] God. We know. We know that this is
[1266.96 - 1270.24] saving us. Hey, I'm going to make a
[1268.56 - 1273.60] Bloody Mary. All right, you watch those
[1270.24 - 1273.60] chemtrails. I'll be right
[1273.64 - 1281.00] back. Fill it up. Get it on the runway.
[1278.08 - 1283.68] Tanks are filled with skull and
[1281.00 - 1286.40] crossbones. Stamp of approval. The boss
[1283.68 - 1289.68] will be thrilled. There it goes. Up in
[1286.40 - 1293.12] the sky, a private radio guy making sure
[1289.68 - 1296.80] the path is clear. Get that plane safely
[1293.12 - 1299.52] in the atmosphere in the sky. The pilot
[1296.80 - 1302.68] was trained, told when to flick the
[1299.52 - 1306.40] switch or die. Pull it off without a
[1302.68 - 1308.48] glitch. This is flight 666 reporting
[1306.40 - 1311.28] back to the base that sits out there in
[1308.48 - 1314.08] the sticks. This is the base. Did you
[1311.28 - 1317.84] empty the tanks? Did you unload the
[1314.08 - 1320.40] poison all over the place? Flight 666,
[1317.84 - 1322.72] you know the drill. What's your ETA
[1320.40 - 1326.32] after you dumped the spell? This is
[1322.72 - 1328.88] flight 666 to the base. I flicked the
[1326.32 - 1331.84] switch, left a trail a mile long, all
[1328.88 - 1334.72] over the place. Base, can I ask a
[1331.84 - 1336.40] personal question? What do you think all
[1334.72 - 1338.88] this poison's going to do to our own
[1336.40 - 1342.32] families down there? This is the base
[1338.88 - 1344.16] fight 666. Don't be thinking about that.
[1342.32 - 1346.56] Pull yourself together. You got a
[1344.16 - 1350.08] mission to finish. What you're doing is
[1346.56 - 1355.08] to help humanity. Get back to the base.
[1350.08 - 1355.08] Do everything you can. Keep your sanity.

[1439.52 - 1443.20] the conventional and alternative health
[1441.20 - 1445.20] communities. Medical medium information
[1443.20 - 1446.72] continually sets the stage for medical

[1446.72 - 1450.64] better. If you choose to share or use

[1484.56 - 1488.40] chronic illness is exploding like never
[1486.48 - 1490.24] before in our modern-day history, it
[1488.40 - 1492.08] takes a greater force than us down here.
[1490.24 - 1493.84] It takes a helping hand from above.
[1492.08 - 1495.52] Medical medium information has street

[1496.72 - 1500.32] healing more healing stories of real
[1498.48 - 1502.48] people not being paid to tell their
[1500.32 - 1504.08] life-changing experiences of rising out
[1502.48 - 1506.16] of the ashes of sickness and entering
[1504.08 - 1507.84] into the light of full recovery, getting
[1506.16 - 1509.44] their lives back and finally healing
[1507.84 - 1510.80] when nothing else in the world of health
