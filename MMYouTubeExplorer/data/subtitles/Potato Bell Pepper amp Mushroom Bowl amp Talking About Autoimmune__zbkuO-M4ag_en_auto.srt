chicken pumpkin seeds right but still

63
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,600
it's a lot of fat so then the blood

64
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,599
stays thick and if you're

65
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:13,440
sick if you're sick and you're doing

66
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,319
all this fat it's almost impossible to

67
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,280
heal

68
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,879
i'm going to say it again if you're sick

69
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,000
and you're doing all this fat

70
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:24,800
it's almost impossible to

71
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,200
heal and i mean heal i mean heal down to

72
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,720
the

73
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,200
bone i'm talking healing all the way

74
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,879
down

75
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:36,000
to the root all the way down

76
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:40,080
to the ground like right there

77
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
and healing deep deep deep

78
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,760
in order to heal that deep you can't

79
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,160
have the fats high

80
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,640
so that means if you're animal protein

81
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,800
person time to lower it and take a break

82
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,160
if you're a plant-based person time to

83
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,120

193
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,000
big time

194
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,000

olive oil is a great oil

202
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:28,160
right but it's really it's what happens

203
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:31,199
is our we lose our oxygen in our body

204
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,840
when we're sick or but oxygen helps us

205
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:36,319
heal it actually helps to kill it keeps

206
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,360
microorganisms like viruses and bacteria

207
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,880
down

208
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,880
and when we fill our bloodstream with

209
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,440
all that fat every day and day out day

210
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,960
day day and day out and our liver starts

211
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,720
getting congested everything starts

212
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,319
getting congested

213
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,400

214
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,319

215
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,759
it gets gets fatty liver and we don't

216
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,120

217
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,800
immune system drops

218
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,479
we have too much fat in our bloodstream

219
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,160
all the time and the fat starts

220
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,759
collecting everywhere that doctors can't

221
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,280

rushes you to alzheimer's

376
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,600
it rushes you to dementia is what it

377
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,600
does

378
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,360
you see that spec that i put on there do

379
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,519
you see that spec

380
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,199
right aluminum right here do you see

381
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,880
that

382
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,959
do you know why we get alzheimer's and

383
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,680
dementia

384
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:41,600
because of aluminum and mercury

385
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,240
predominantly mercury

386
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,920
in our brain this is the best lesson you

387
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,800
can ever learn right now about this this

388
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:51,839
is really important

389
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:54,959
ready metal

390
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:58,320
rusts and oxidizes

391
00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:02,240
and bleeds and corrodes

392
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:05,440
and out pockets when oil

393
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:08,160
is around it oil

394
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,120
is around it keep that in mind keep that

395
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,880
in mind

396
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:16,160
oil makes the metal corrode

397
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:19,440
faster and it

398
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:21,519
makes it move into adjacent tissue

399
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,920
everybody has aluminum and mercury

400
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,959
inside their brain

401
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,600
the higher the fat diet whether good fat

402
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,639
or bad

403
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,759
fat the quicker you go to alzheimer's

404
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:35,680
dementia depression

405
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:37,440
anxiety depersonalization bipolar ocd

406
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,600
i don't know did i miss a bunch i bet

407
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,720
you i did schizophrenia whatever i miss

408
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:45,440
probably missed a bunch right and

409
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,079
what happened ptsd too a little bit of

410
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,440
that

411
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:52,639
okay so what happens is oil

412
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:56,000
right oil

413
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:58,079
will make the metal out out pocket

414
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,160
so you got the metal in there but the

415
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:03,600
metal will expand

416
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:06,639
it will run and bleed from the

417
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,160
oil so whether it's mct or coconut oil

418
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,279
what nobody's telling you

419
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:13,040
is they don't no one took a bunch of

420
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:15,440
people with alzheimer's

421
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,399
right and a bunch of people dementia and

422
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,000
just gave them

423
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:23,120
mct their all their diets

424
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,399
changed other supplements were brought

425
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,839
in

426
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:30,639
okay fast food was removed

427
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,560
from from people and that's something to

428
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,920
understand how it works right

429
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,920
it's not like you got somebody with

430
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,480
alzheimer's and dementia nothing's

431
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,480
changing

432
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,839
they're still doing everything they do

433
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,040
nothing changes and all of a sudden let

434
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,399
me give them a little coconut oil and

435
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,959
their alzheimer's got better no

436
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,440
ah never happened never happened never

437
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:49,040
will

438
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:52,560
never did so just know that right

439
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,440
plus it's a theory that it's helpful the

440
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,240
theory

441
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,240
is built on this preface it's built on

442
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,759
this foundation of

443
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:04,160
our brain needs fat give our brain

444
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,280
healthy fat and we get better

445
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,799
alzheimer's

446
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:11,360
is the brain give our brain healthy fat

447
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:13,439
then alzheimer's gets better this is a

448
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:16,079
massive mistake in the industry

449
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,839
it's an embarrassing mistake because the

450
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:20,400
brain

451
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:23,120
dies without glucose fast

452
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,679
in five seconds if your brain doesn't

453
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:28,720
have glucose it starts to die

454
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:32,400
it starts to die die

455
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:35,440
die say it again die yeah your brain

456
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:38,480
starts to die without glucose

457
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:41,679
in five seconds

458
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,640
it starts to die okay that's what

459
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,760
happens

460
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:48,880
in 10 seconds it's dying

461
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:50,000
without glucose right your brain doesn't

462
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,480
start dying

463
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,480
because it's without fat in your

464
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,640
bloodstream

465
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,039

great word anna is it true that women

516
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,720
need more protein during pregnancy

517
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,679
it's what's being pushed by the national

518
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,400
health guidelines

519
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:50,000
huh interesting of course it's pushed

520
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,679
that's what i was talking about before

521
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,840
about protein is the protein

522
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:56,400
brainwashing scheme of a lifetime was a

523
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,919
deal brokered in 1933.

524
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,559
so it's important to know what happened

525
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:05,120
is protein was

526
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:08,159
was used as a weapon in 1933 big pharma

527
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,919
and the academic world both combined

528
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,679
to make sure that you would think

529
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,600
protein is the answer

530
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,679
it's it's one of the biggest scams of

531
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,360
our lifetime it's so sad one day i'll do

532
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,600
a whole protein show because there's so

533
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:22,159
much information involved with it

534
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,960
but yeah that's how it works what you

535
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:26,000
need

536
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:28,240
is mineral salts and glucose you need

537
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,720
calories when you're pregnant but proper

538
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,760
calories mineral salts and glucose right

539

565
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,520
does that make a lot of sense to you

566
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,679
think about that one

567
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,799
that is a head scratcher times a

568
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,120
thousand for me

569
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,840
that's a head scratcher times a million

570
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,400
so okay

571
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,440

how come you guys don't have one single

577
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,200
valid

00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,760
answer for why 250 million americans

579
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,000

580
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,520

perspective when you place

606
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:52,640
that into perspective you you're already

607
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,799
like wait a minute

608
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,320
right i mean it's beyond common sense

609
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:59,760
like beyond

610
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:01,200
amy gallbladder inflammation help

611
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,520
yeah the you know like if i had

612
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,520
gallbladder inflammation if i did

613
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,280
keeping the fats down is critical right

614
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,120
steaming up some keeping the fats down

615
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:12,480
is critical that's part one

616
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:15,600
the more fat you eat

617
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,960
okay whether it's healthy fat or fat

618
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,240
that's not healthy

619
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:22,159
the more bile has to be produced

620
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,919
so your liver is killing itself to

621
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,400
produce that vial right

622
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,039
so your liver is just killing itself to

623
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,960
produce

624
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:34,400
bile right okay so your liver is it's

625
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:36,559
it's over working right so it's gotta

626
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,679
spew out all this bile you keep on

627
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,120
putting fat in

628
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,400
you just keep on dumping in and you

629
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,880
might be like what is he talking about

630
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,039
fat

631
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,080
you know chicken fish beef milk cheese

632
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:47,440
eggs butter

633
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:51,039
bacon pork pork chops whatever right ham

634
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,880
okay nuts seeds oils coconut oil right

635
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:55,279
sesame seeds whatever it is right all

636
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,799
that fat right olive oil

637
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:58,480
your liver has to kill itself so now you

638
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:00,640
got an inflamed gallbladder

639
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,760
the gallbladder is inflamed right it's a

640
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,360
little gallbladder

641
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:08,240
your gallbladder's inflamed and we're

642
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,120
we're now overworking the liver and the

643
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,960
liver has to

644
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,559
produce all this bile and shove it up

645
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,360
the gallbladder like send it up the

646
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,200
gallbladder

647
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,640
now the gallbladder is over stressed it

648
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,960
has to work hard

649
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,480
to even sustain itself when you got a

650
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,240
gallbladder infection of any kind which

651
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,360
is usually streptococcus

652
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,440
when you have a streptococcus

653
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,039
gallbladder infection and you got all

654
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,840
that bile spewing up

655
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:32,080
and it's overburdening that gallbladder

656
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,880
that's one reason why we can't heal we

657
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,760
can't heal it

658
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,600
another reason the more fat you dump in

659
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,200
the less oxygen in your bloodstream the

660
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,120
less oxygen in your bloodstream

661
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,559
the more pathogens like streptococcus

662
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,039
can take over

663
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:46,480
and create that inflamed gallbladder so

664
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:48,000
you got that streptococcus

665
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,120
inflaming the gallbladder right and a

666
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,120
lot of people's gallbladder it's

667
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,400
inflamed by streptococcus bacteria

668
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,320
and then all of a sudden we're dumping

669
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,000
in fats left and right and streptococcus

670
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,480
is like woohoo there's no oxygen in our

671
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,240
blood

672
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,000
there's very little oxygen in our blood

673
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,520
now we roll the roost let's keep on

674
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,640
going with this infection let's keep on

675
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,520
going with this infection here's the

676
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,360
other problem

677
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,520
the more fat in your bloodstream the

678
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,279
less the nutrients

679
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,960
the less phytochemical compounds that

680
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,320
are antibacterial can get to your

681
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,159
gallbladder so now

682
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,600
if you eat a red bell pepper which

683
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,240
happens to have vitamin c

684
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,400
which is a phytochemical compound which

685
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,080
helps destroy pathogens right

686
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,600
like your streptococcus and you're

687
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,400
trying to eat all these and you want

688
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,559
your onion

689
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,000
you get your onion that can help you

690
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,679
fight infections right

691
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,320
you get your garlic that can help you

692
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:35,120
it's anti-viral antibacterial right

693
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,320
but those phytochemical compounds can't

694
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,760
get to the organ

695
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,360
because there's so much fat in the

696
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,679
bloodstream blocking

697
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,559
glucose sugar from taking those

698
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,960
nutrients

699
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:47,440
into your organ now we're not even

700
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,120
getting the fighting power we need

701
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,880
there's a lot of information right here

702
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,039
just letting you guys know

703
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,039

00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,679
they didn't heal my genes are still bad

751
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,399
but when i go into remission

752
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,440
i'm in remission so okay so if i get

753
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:14,240
better

754
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:16,240
my genes are still bad that just doesn't

755
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:19,440
make any sense

756
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:23,360
um this is confusing me

757
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,360
all right is everybody's genes going bad

758
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,279
i hung up on the doctor i had an

759
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,720
appointment with the doctor today just

760
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:32,159
hung up on him

761
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:34,480
i'm making hot sauce this is steaming up

762
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:34,480
nice

763
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:40,320
actually that's cooking up really good

764
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:45,840
that's almost done

765
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:45,840
um i'm gonna take the lid off

766
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,039
evaporate some of that juice

767
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,559
um

768
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:04,000
you know it's like when babies are born

769
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:05,600
with cancer that's not genes

770
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,520
that's that's an immune system

771
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,360
deficiency off the running

772
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:11,440
and it's important to know how this

773
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,919
works right they just want to pinpoint

774
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,600
everything with genes if a baby's born

775
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:18,640
with cancer

776
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:21,360
that's a viral infection because because

777
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:23,840
cancer is caused by viruses unless you

778
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:26,960
get asbestos or you get

779
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:28,720
you get unless it's a lethal solvent

780
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,320
and you know that you know that's a

781
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,559
different story right but outside of

782
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:35,679
those very rare cases

783
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:39,039
cancer is viral right viral

784
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:39,679
cells going awry but you have to but but

785
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:42,000
you can't

786
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:43,840
just get cancer from viruses viruses

787
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
need toxins so they need

788
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,840
a certain amount of a toxic slop and

789
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,159
brew to feed off of right

790
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,960
so viruses have to feed off of a lot of

791
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,720
metals

792
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,000
and a lot of other toxins that's what

793
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,080
viruses have to do

794
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,760
and then the virus feeds off all these

795
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,679
toxins

796
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,039
and then gets stronger and starts to

797
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:03,279
mutate

798
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:05,679
and as it starts to mutate we have a

799
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:09,520
different viral cell

800
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:11,440
doctors um and sophie

801
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,640
doctors are telling me they can't help

802
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,640
me out because

803
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:20,559
i am adopted they say it's genetic

804
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:22,399
that's it's real oh my god i'm s

805
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:24,080

00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,360
i i would be yeah i would be upset

812
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:37,679
because

813
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,720
you know if that was me and that's what

814
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,480
i was told

they tell us that

821
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:56,480
adhd and autism they'll say adhd and

822
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,960
autism is genetic no it's not

823
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,039
it's toxic heavy metals that's what it

824
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:04,080
is there's answers to why we have

you sure you're super sensitive

868
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:36,720
to a nightshade so if you took a fresh

869
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,039
delicious

870
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,480
heirloom tomato and you cut that tomato

871
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:42,559
in half and you had a piece of that

872
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:46,159
fresh tomato

873
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:48,399
you sure that's causing the trouble

874
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:50,640
um there's no cheese you sure there's no

875
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:56,159
cheese in there there's no oil in there

876
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:59,840
see because um

877
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:59,840
i'm gonna grab something right here

878
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:05,600
where'd you guys go where'd you go so

879
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,799
you see like

880
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,200
okay i can't tell you how many times i

881
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:12,480
heard

882
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:14,159
in 35 years right i'm sensitive to

883
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,200
tomatoes

884
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:19,039
and they had pizza and they're saying

885
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,760
it's the tomato sauce and the pizza

886
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:22,240
right

887
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:24,320
when really we're talking about the

888
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,880
cheese and the oil

889
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:28,480
and the gluten right that's an example

890
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,720
all on its own it's really important to

891
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,720
know

892
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,519
i'm gonna put that nice pizza over there

893
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:42,559
you know if you're mono eating

894
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:44,080
and you keep out the oils and you keep

895
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,840
out the bad stuff and you keep out the

896
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,480
milk cheese butter and you keep all that

897
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,399
out

898
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,480
and you're and you can determine really

899
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:52,240
what am i sensitive to and even in that

900
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:54,159
situation if you're cleansing a lot of

901
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,080
poisons out you may not know

902
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,519
you know you may actually be like whoa

903
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,039
i'm actually doing some cleansing and

904
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:00,799
detoxing you know there's a whole thing

905
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:02,559
about detoxing where people are like i

906
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:04,080
heard that word before it's

907
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:05,840
whatever but you know when you do it

908
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,440
right and you're healing yeah you will

909
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,240
be cleansing and a lot of poisons will

910
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,720
be going out

911
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:12,320
a lot of people do fake detoxes they

912
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,839
take a bunch of toxic products they get

913
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,440
sick from the toxic products and then

914
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:17,760
they call it detoxing when really

915
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:21,280
they're just sick from toxic products

916
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:23,040
um so keep that in mind right there

917
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,280
a lot of people drown there they have

918
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,760
tomato and ketchup with all the vinegar

919
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,280
right

920
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,839
that's a problem all on its own all the

921
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:33,679
vinegar the vinegar is making them sick

922
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:35,040
um by the way people make mistakes i'm

923
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:36,240
going to talk about this let's i'll talk

924
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,679

925
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,599

936
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,560
on it right

937
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,920
these things you know it's baked potato

938
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,560
with sour cream

939
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,160
and butter and your mashed potatoes it's

940
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,079
just combinations

941
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:18,880
a lot of that's what's happening right

942
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:22,000
but a steamed potato doesn't cause a

943
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,000
problem with someone

944
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,040
um a lot of people make mistakes with

945
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,480
with i'm gonna give you some tips right

946
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,880
now if you have digestive

947
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,640
issues of any kind like you're sensitive

948
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,920
you're inflamed in your digestive tract

949
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,240
because a lot of people are inflamed in

950
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,599
their digestive tract

951
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,680
and when they're inflamed in their

952
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:42,160
intestinal lining because they got

953
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,800
streptococcus they got inflammation

954
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,560
caused by

955
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,920
pathogens and they're inflamed they

956
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:48,320
don't feel like they're digesting

957
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,640
anything and so when you eat like

958
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,480
when you eat like raw spinach or raw

959
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,640
lettuce or raw red bell pepper

960
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,480
like i can't eat that red bell pepper i

961
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,680
can't eat a raw piece of onion i can't

962
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,160
digest it but what's

963
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,040
happening is they're digesting it but

964
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,560
it's actually

965
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,240
touching everything because you're in

966
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:06,640
flames so you feel it right

967
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:09,280
so then when they eat an egg right so

968
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:11,760
then when they eat an egg

969
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,960
okay and they have that egg they don't

970
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,560
feel it because it's not touching

971
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,240
anything it turns into glue and it's

972
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:19,359
just moving through here into

973
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:21,359
its glue it's not rubbing right

974
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:22,960
but when we eat our lettuces and our

975
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:25,599
spinach right raw

976
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,480
it's rubbing it's moving through us

977
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:28,320
right you guys

978
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,480
okay so you feel it if you're in flame

979
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:33,800
doesn't mean you're not digesting it see

980
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:37,280
but here's the funny thing you take

981
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:40,960
vegetables right vegetables

982
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:42,640
and you don't steam them long enough

983
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,640
till they're soft

984
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,920
you're gonna feel those rub everything

985
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,320
too so

986
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:50,079
the difference is here is when you steam

987
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:52,720
a vegetable or cook a vegetable

988
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:53,440
you kill it right yeah you kill it yeah

989
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,560
it's not raw

990
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,599
you kill it you cook it right but when

991
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,280
you do that

992
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:01,680
you get the nutrients and all that but

993
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,040
what happens is that

994
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,400
this is done right here i'm going to put

995
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,119
some potatoes in here what happens is

996
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,240
that

997
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:10,720
it's not cooked vegetables

998
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:12,640
are easy to digest when they're soft

999
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:16,720
when you cook them

1000
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:18,720
raw vegetables many of like lettuces and

1001
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,839
and spinach and all that are easy to

1002
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:23,839
digest

1003
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:26,960
right when when they're raw

1004
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:29,680
right but when you cook green beans and

1005
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:31,040
cook carrots but you don't steam them

1006
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,520
until they're soft

1007
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:35,680
in any and anything like red bell pepper

1008
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:39,359
anything you don't steam them

1009
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:42,720
until they're soft what happens

1010
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:43,119
is that they they tend to they tend to

1011
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,240
rub

1012
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,720
things along the way not break down as

1013
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:49,119
easy

1014
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,800
right you've got to steam them soft if

1015
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:52,960
you're sensitive you're not sensitive

1016
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:55,040
with any kind of digestive sensitivities

1017
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,560
you can just steam them lightly i do it

1018
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,440
all the time i steam my stuff really

1019
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,560
lightly right

1020
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:02,079
but i like steaming them more more with

1021
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,720
you guys because i know a lot of you

1022
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:05,599

1024
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:09,760
our vegetables

1025
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:13,680

now i'm gonna start working on the

1032
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:29,599
potatoes i'm gonna just take some of

1033
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,599

handy right you guys

1038
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:47,839
and i'm gonna cut up some nice pieces

1039
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,839
right here

1040
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:56,560
okay in the pan nice hot pan i cook cook

1041
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,560
them ahead i keep them in the fridge

1042
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,160
covering a lot covering a lot of cool

1043
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,200
topics that

1044
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:05,440
count back to alzheimer's and dementia

1045
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:07,040
no the more fat you do the quicker you

1046
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,880
get there

1047
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,640
the more fat you do the quicker you get

1048
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,160
there the more protein you do the

1049
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,000
quicker you get there

1050
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:16,160
yeah the more protein you do the quicker

1051
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,240
you get to alzheimer's and dementia

1052
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,440
reason why most proteins have a lot of

1053
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:22,480
fat in there

1054
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:24,800
keep that in mind so um

1055
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:26,079
you know that's important to know so i

1056
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:29,839
got some potato in here i'm gonna do

1057
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:29,839

00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:25,760
this

1269
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:28,240
diane i just have to say i am a chronic

1270
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:30,160
migraine sufferer and i spent years

1271
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:32,160
trying various different meds

1272
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:33,200
but since i've started the celery juice

1273
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:36,160
i've had an incredible

1274
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:37,280
improvement in overall health the needle

1275
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:41,040
moved

1276
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:45,040
you moved diane you moved the needle

1277
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:48,240
you did it you moved the needle

1278
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:50,319
right right that's what that is and

1279
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:52,160
the disrespect out there towards celery

1280
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:54,160
juice the disrespect

1281
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:55,359
out there towards the chronically ill

1282
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,720
right

1283
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:59,280
and it's kind they're constantly

1284
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:00,800
insulting chronically ill 24 7 out there

1285
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:02,240
but yet you've got the health scene

1286
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,280
pretending they actually care about the

1287
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:05,520
chronicle when

1288
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:06,800
i've seen leaders in the health scene

1289
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,160
they don't really care they care about

1290
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,160
their pocket their dollars

1291
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:11,599
they care about their fame they care

1292
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:13,200
about their empires they're all building

1293
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:16,240
on their podcast they care about

1294
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:17,680
their empires right and then they dangle

1295
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:19,839
carrots in front of everybody

1296
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:21,599
you know like as if they're doing like

1297
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:23,680
enough right

1298
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:25,280
and then they tear apart celery juice at

1299
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,559
the same time seen that over and over

1300
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:29,200
right because

1301
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:30,720
why build celery juice up and make it

1302
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,839
into something big when no one can make

1303
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:33,359
money off of it and

1304
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:34,720
all it's going to do is get anthony

1305
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:36,559
william the medical media more

1306
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:38,480
well-known so let's keep the down low on

1307
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:40,800
the celery juice but make sure

1308
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:41,599
we're drinking it and the meanwhile the

1309
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,880
sad thing is

1310
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:44,319
if we cared about the chronically ill

1311
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,960
and we cared about people suffering like

1312
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:47,680
diane

1313
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:50,000
you with your migraines then we would be

1314
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:51,680
we would be really really making sure

1315
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,040
everybody knew about how this needle

1316
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:56,480
could be moved and

1317
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:58,160
and we'd have uh two billion people

1318
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:01,680
drinking celery juice right

1319
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:01,680
got a migraine chapter in the book

1320
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:06,400
and new edition migraine chapter so

1321
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:09,359
everybody knows okay

1322
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:11,200
there it is and um it's the revised

1323
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:12,720
expanded new edition

1324
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:15,040
so i made this incredible dish right

1325
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:17,760
here i'm heading to ig

1326
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:19,200
and tic toc fasten your seat belts i

1327
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,559
don't know what kind of mood i'm in

1328
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:24,800
tonight

1329
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:26,880
but um we'll see

1330
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,920
because we're going to be doing ig in a

1331
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,839
little while i don't know if it's going

1332
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:31,119
to be 10 minutes or something like that

1333
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:33,040
i'll probably clean up a little bit

1334
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:35,760
straighten out just for a couple of

1335
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:38,960
minutes i might take a quick jab at this

1336
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:40,319
dish right here but the suffering has

1337
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:42,880
just begun

1338
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:43,680
chronically ill or as far as what's

1339
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:46,240

1340
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:47,760
