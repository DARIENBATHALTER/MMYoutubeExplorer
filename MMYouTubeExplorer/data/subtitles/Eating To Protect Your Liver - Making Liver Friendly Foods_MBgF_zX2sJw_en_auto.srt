1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,759
weaker than people's livers already are

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,799
out there so we're making two kinds of

3
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:08,920
guacamole two kinds of guacamole

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,559
interesting not so bad on the liver

5
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,840
compared to what people are Downing

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,920
right now at this time of year and we're

7
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,440
making hummuses we might make three

8
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,440
kinds of

9
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:24,840
hummus

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,039
crazy making ice cream mango ice cream

11
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,960
is the one I'm choosing to do I'm pumped

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,439
about that okay what else am I making

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,760
what else got a cre T I got the

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,480
guacamole I got that I got oh Walnut

15
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,079
butter don't miss out on that and I'm

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,160
going to hide the label right here just

17
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:43,320
like I do and that is a very popular

18
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,800
brand what you see here is an inch of

19
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,199
oil on top of a very popular Nut Butter

20
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,320
that's out there that people eat every

21
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:52,480
single day and people don't leave me

22
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:55,440
some of them but just so you know oil is

23
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,960
added to the nut Butters the really good

24
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,559
nut Butters the seed Butters all of it

25
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,600
out there oil hidden oil is at it that's

26
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:03,680
what they do people don't realize that

27
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,640
and we're going to make a walnut butter

28
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,280
without that and this is what it's going

29
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,000
to end up kind of looking like you ready

30
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,880
I made this Nut Butter months ago I'm

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,200
pretty sure it was months ago and do you

32
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,960
see the oil spilling out no you see

33
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,400
actually nut butter in here but not oil

34
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,720
spilling out how do you like that

35
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,200
there's another one too check this out I

36
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,439
made this one

37
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,479
too right take a look take a look take a

38
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:31,920
look take a look look look look and what

39
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:34,159
you see is how come where's all the oil

40
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,840
where's the oil no oil and I make nut

41
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,880
Butters almond almond butter peanut

42
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,880
butter you name it and that's the key

43
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:42,680
because everybody buys oil added in

44
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,320
their nut Butters and they don't realize

45
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,479
it and it's really sad so we're going to

46
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,200
talk about that all that oil on top of

47
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,000
that nut butter right there and when you

48
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,479
get nut butter and it doesn't look it

49
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,119
was freshly made pretty recently by a

50
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,920
company and then they put it out there

51
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:58,119
and then over time though as the thing

52
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,640
settle a few months later the cupboard

53
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:02,119
all that oil Rises right there that's

54
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,479
the that's the whole thing I want to

55
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:06,079
talk about too but anyway it's not about

56
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:09,039
that entirely because we're making all

57
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:13,800
that with the mm 1500 right there best

58
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:16,239
sale ever in the mm500 $140 off

59
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,959
$140 off get it for somebody for

60
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:21,280
Christmas if you waited all year and you

61
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:24,640
don't have the MN 1500 hands down the MN

62
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,000
1500 saves people money I'm watching out

63
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,200
there all the time I'm just going to say

64
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,160
this I'm just going to say this but the

65
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,560
users that are getting popular because

66
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,519
they got money behind them and

67
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,920
advertising and influencers behind them

68
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,920
those juicers spinning baskets and

69
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,040
everything else they don't squeeze

70
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,080
enough juice out of the produce and so

71
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,680
essentially you're throwing away money

72
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,720
and people who are chronically sick are

73
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,239
trying to juice every day people in the

74
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:50,560
medical mem Community who juice a ton of

75
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,440
stuff they can't just be buying cases

76
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,400
and cases of produce juicing it and

77
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,080
having not the results because you're

78
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,080
not getting enough nutrients extracted

79
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:01,280
from the juice it's not actually doing

80
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,599
its job get the juice out and they're

81
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,959
throwing away produce all that leftover

82
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,480
pulp is getting thrown away so if you're

83
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:09,560
somebody that's really wealthy and you

84
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,200
don't care and you just you you want to

85
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,760
use the juicers that actually only

86
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,200
extract some juice but not a lot you're

87
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,519
running lots and lots of prod then fine

88
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,480
that's fine but a lot of people want to

89
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,640
save money and a lot of people want to

90
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:24,040
be able to actually juice like celery

91
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:26,920
and everything else without actually

92
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:29,319
spending a ton of money saving thousands

93
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:31,959
over the time so that's what I love

94
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:33,640
about the M 1500 the 900 this is the mm

95
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:35,480
1500 right here you guys know I work

96
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,840
with the mega link is in the description

97
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:41,840
link is in the profile but we're talking

98
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:44,640
today about eating to protect your liver

99
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,360
so eating foods to protect your liver

100
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,680
because what people don't realize they

101
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:53,560
have overburdened stagnant sluggish hot

102
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:55,079
livers that are filled with fat the

103
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,319
liers get dysfunctional and then your

104
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:59,280
cholesterol gets out of whack everything

105
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:00,920
else gets out of whack deficiencies

106
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,920
start to happen because your liver is

107
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,200
the great converter let's talk about

108
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,400
that for a minute if you just got on

109
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,480

bunch of people getting kicked off of IG

113
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,920
so it looks like IG is definitely going

114
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,720

on medicalmedium.com right now so you

129
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:51,320
guys we're going to make some food we're

130
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:53,000
going to talk about the liver a little

131
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:56,280
bit too so what happens with people's

132
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,919
livers is that they actually burden them

133
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,840
and they don't realize they burden them

134
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,520
so they overburden livers every single

135
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,080
day and that's what we're kind of taught

136
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,520
we're not taught how to protect our

137
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,120
liver how to look after our liver how to

138
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,880
get our liver in a better place and then

139
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,000
over time our liver stops working the

140
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:14,039
way it should work it doesn't produce

141
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,320
enough bile and when that bile isn't

142
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:18,960
produced we get in trouble and all that

143
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,120
fat sits around it doesn't break down

144
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,800
good enough it sits around in our

145
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,560
bloodstream then it eventually collects

146
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,120
in Our arteries then it collects in our

147
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:29,000
veins and over time we get problems

148
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,840
where we have all this plaque jacked up

149
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,160
all around around our blood vessels

150
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,800
veins arteries our liver gets sluggish

151
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,000
another thing too you go to the doctor

152
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,639
doctor takes blood work the blood work

153
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,720
comes back you're deficient in this

154
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,400
you're deficient in that you're

155
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,759
deficient in this and all these

156
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,440
deficiencies over time partly happen

157
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:48,960
because your liver is the great

158
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,600
converter what it does is it actually

159
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:54,000
converts the

160
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:55,960
nutrients and we don't have good livers

161
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,840
these days so we don't get good

162
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,759
conversion because you want good

163
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,840
conversion every single nutrient you eat

164
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:05,520
almost every single nutrient you eat

165
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,000
nutrients that come from your leafy

166
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,479
greens nutrients that come from your

167
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,520
onions your broccoli your radishes your

168
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:13,599
carrots everything your lemons your

169
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,199
limes your Tomatoes your avocados all

170
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:17,919
those nutrients have to be converted

171
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:20,759
they go into the liver boom they go up

172
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:23,560
the hepatic portal highway right into

173
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:25,520
the liver here and when that happens

174
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:28,080
your liver says whoa It's conversion

175
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,800
time so your liver has to anoint and

176
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,800
bless the nutrients is what it has to do

177
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,319
and people don't realize this they think

178
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,919
that if you take a whole bunch of

179
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,800
supplements the supplements are going to

180
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,919
work for you you take a whole bunch of

181
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,759
different things are going to work for

182
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:43,520
you and partially that partially that's

183
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:46,759
true but your liver still has to

184
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:50,199
methylate it still has to convert it

185
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:52,479
still has to anoint and turn and change

186
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:54,759
the nutrients around around a little bit

187
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:57,560
it has to bless them enzymes from the

188
00:06:54,759 --> 00:07:00,840
liver attach to the nutrients carry the

189
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:02,319
nutrients along change the nutrients too

190
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,199
and then the liver has to store the

191
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,879
nutrients at the same time but if we

192
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:08,840
overburden we beat down our livers we

193
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:11,360
drink alcohol we do all kinds of stuff

194
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:14,840
we eat really greasy food fried foods we

195
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:17,599
eat too much oil in everything we get in

196
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:20,560
trouble the liver ends up weakening and

197
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:24,039
when it weakens it can't convert it will

198
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,919
not do that conversion that we need so

199
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:28,160
we walk around our liver is getting

200
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,919
tired it's getting stagnant it's getting

201
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,160
sluggish and then it's not doing its job

202
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:36,160
every day and then we go to bed at night

203
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:39,120
and our liver is tired it's too tired to

204
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,560
work hard for us all night long so what

205
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,639
happens when you go to bed at night your

206
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:48,120
liver starts to work that's when it

207
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:50,680
clocks in mainly clocks in in the middle

208
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:53,400
of the night that's where it starts to

209
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:55,639
bag up all the garbage all the junk all

210
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:58,400
the toxins all the poisons they get

211
00:07:55,639 --> 00:08:00,199
bagged up in the middle of the night and

212
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,319
you got to keep that in mind right so

213
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:04,759
when we sleep our liver working while

214
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:07,400
we're resting that's how it works our

215
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:09,000
liver working while we're resting think

216
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,560
about a whole bunch of elves inside your

217
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,479
liver and they're making all kinds of

218
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,000
toys and they're doing all kinds of

219
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:17,440
stuff and they're using Hammers and saws

220
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,080
they're working all night long while

221
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:23,840
you're sleeping and resting but when our

222
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,720
livers get tired and they get beat up

223
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,520
and they get overburdened and they get

224
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:30,840
fatty and they start to get sluggish and

225
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:33,320
stagnant when they work in the middle of

226
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:36,959
the night they're not as efficient our

227
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:38,800
livers are not as working as they should

228
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,519
or efficient as they should so in the

229
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,240
middle of the night we sit there and

230
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:44,680
sometimes people toss in turns some

231
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,760
sometimes people have more gas sometimes

232
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:48,320
people have they're waking up in the

233
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,600
middle of the night sometimes people

234
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,200
don't feel good when they're trying to

235
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,480
sleep they're tossing and turning and a

236
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,680
lot of that is liver spasming out the

237
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:59,680
liver the liver being stressed out

238
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:01,760
overburdened stagnant and struggling so

239
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:05,320
people get liver spasms they don't even

240
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:07,320
know it a lot of people live with liver

241
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:09,920
spasms have no idea that's what's

242
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,959
happening and inside their body they got

243
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:15,360
an unhappy liver every single day that

244
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:18,040
wants to perform that wants to move

245
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:21,480
forward that wants to heal that wants to

246
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:23,320
get better but it just can't do what it

247
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:26,279
needs to do and every single day it's

248
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:29,360
repeat right we then overburden it again

249
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:32,000
we do alcohol we overburden it with two

250
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,560
much fat we end up eating too many

251
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,600
treats and when we do that our liver is

252
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,240
like oh here it goes again so let's talk

253
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:43,320
about bio reserves most people walking

254
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:45,680
around have low bile reserves what that

255
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,399
means is their liver is not producing

256
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,880
enough bile to break down the fats now

257
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,440
bile does more than break down fats bile

258
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,320
breaks down a lot of different aspects

259
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:58,279
of the food but fat is one of the number

260
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:01,560
one things that the bile actually does

261
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:04,079
but our bile is low for most people

262
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:06,800
walking around we have low bile and what

263
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:10,360
happens is food rots in the gut when you

264
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:12,880
have reduced bile levels inside your

265
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:15,240
liver bile that's not potent it's not

266
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,640
strong one problem that happens when

267
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:20,360
your bile is not potent and strong is

268
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:23,560
that it's not doing its job when it goes

269
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:25,680
up the bile duck when it gets into the

270
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,720
gallbladder our gallbladder start

271
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,880
getting wasted they start becoming a

272
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,320
trash compound they start start becoming

273
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:35,440
a trash dump and when our gallbladder

274
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:38,000
becomes a trash dump okay and it can't

275
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,880
be cleaned out we get in trouble then we

276
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,399
get the gall stones then we get the sand

277
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:43,279
in the gallbladder then we get all the

278
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:44,839
different gallbladder spasms and

279
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:48,240
problems a lot of people have to have

280
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:53,079
their gallbladders removed but when your

281
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:55,639
B is strong and potent and really

282
00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:58,360
aggressive you can't collect a lot of

283
00:10:55,639 --> 00:11:01,000
sediment inside the gallbladder you

284
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,720
can't collect a lot of Sandy sediment

285
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,639
stones and so forth inside the

286
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,160
gallbladder when the bile is really

287
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:10,600
vibrant it has vitality and it's strong

288
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:12,560
and it actually is Gusto what happens is

289
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,480
if it's not doesn't have that Gusto if

290
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,639
it's not that strong if your bile is

291
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,920
weak and you're producing less bile like

292
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:22,160
most people are the sludge builds up

293
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,120
inside the gallbladder the gallbladder

294
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:27,600
needs to be awaken it needs to be

295
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:30,320
shocked it needs to be pushed hard and

296
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:33,200
if our bile reserves are our gallbladder

297
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,680
is going to get stagnant too so boom we

298
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,600
got the liver that's stagnant and

299
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:39,639
sluggish and then boom we got the

300
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,040
gallbladder that's stagnant and sluggish

301
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:43,279
you see how it works that's what happens

302
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,839
there's people out there that're like I

303
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,560
want to do gallbladder flush I want to

304
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:48,399
take care of my gallbladder I got gall

305
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,079
stones I'm worried about gallbladder

306
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,760
problems and then what they don't

307
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:56,560
realize is they got liver problems they

308
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:59,160
had liver problems first not Gall

309
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,760
gallbladder problems first had liver

310
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:04,680
problems first so what happens is when

311
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:07,760
your bile is your bile reserves are low

312
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:11,040
stagnant sluggish and dirty and fill the

313
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:13,600
trash and garbage and then weak it goes

314
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:16,240
into the gallbladder and doesn't come

315
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:19,199
out easy and then the gallbladder gets

316
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,680
fatter and fatter and fatter and fatter

317
00:12:19,199 --> 00:12:24,800
the gallbladder gets heavier and heavier

318
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:28,920
and becomes a sack of mud a sack of

319
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:31,240
stones a sack of sand so a lot of people

320
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:33,560
walk around and they got basically a

321
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:36,320
sack of stones and sand inside their

322
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:38,839
gallbladder it's just this little sack

323
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:42,959
that's filled up and how did it get like

324
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:46,760
that because bile was weak for a long

325
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:49,800
time bile reserves were low for a long

326
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:51,839
time and because of that all that trash

327
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,680
and garbage and poisons and toxins that

328
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,800
came out of the liver as the liver got

329
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,800
stagnant and sluggish they all landed

330
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:00,519
inside the gallbladder and there wasn't

331
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:04,000
enough body bile to go in there and

332
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:06,800
flush and push and flush and the potency

333
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:11,760
of the bile wasn't strong enough to

334
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:15,079
dissolve dissolve bile is extremely

335
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:18,480
powerful it's a dissolvent it's supposed

336
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:21,079
to break down fats and dissolve them

337
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:24,399
that's what bile does but when it

338
00:13:21,079 --> 00:13:27,000
weakens it can't go and do that as much

339
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:29,279
so it enters into the gallbladder and it

340
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,160
can't do its job it's weak

341
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:35,079
it's lost its viscosity it's lost its

342
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:38,440
power it's not as powerful as it needs

343
00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:41,240
to be it's not as stringent and that AR

344
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:42,760
stringency is gone away from the bile

345
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:45,519
and when it's gone and away from the

346
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:48,040
bile we get in trouble the gallbladder

347
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:50,759
starts to get Gnarly nasty filled with

348
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:52,920
junk garbage and sand and becomes a sack

349
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:54,440
of mud and that's what happens and

350
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,720
people walk around it could take years

351
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:58,880
you could be walking around through your

352
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:00,440
life and it could take years and your go

353
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,639
bladder just builds up and builds up

354
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:05,160
more slug you know more sludge in there

355
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,440
more problems inside there and then boom

356
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,399
it hits us we have the spasms we have a

357
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,199
problem we're having a we're putting

358
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:14,560
castor oil packs on our gallbladder we

359
00:14:12,199 --> 00:14:17,040
live like that and that's a it's not a

360
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,519
fun place to be it's taking casserole

361
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,360
packs and you're looking up things and

362
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:22,040
you're using all kinds of stuff you're

363
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,240
on the internet what can I do for

364
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,480
gallbladder what can I do for

365
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:27,120
gallbladder then we're in that hell

366
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,279
which is oh my God I don't want to get

367
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,320
this gallbladder out the doctor says

368
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,759
it's going to turn Gang Green they did

369
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,800
an M they did a CAT scan they think my

370
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:38,440
gall bladder's got a problem what am I

371
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:40,199
going to do what's going to happen and

372
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,720
then you're back into the emergency room

373
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:43,600
then you're back in the doctor's office

374
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:45,320
and your gallbladder is becoming a

375
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,680
problem it's getting heavier it's

376
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:51,199
getting the sand it's getting the slug

377
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:53,839
the sludge in there and meanwhile how

378
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:56,560
did that even happen it happened because

379
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:59,480
the liver wasn't taken care of the liver

380
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:01,839
wasn't nurtured there wasn't enough Good

381
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:04,160
Foods going into the liver there wasn't

382
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:06,040
enough nutrients going into the liver to

383
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:09,440
shake it up to wake it up to keep it

384
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:11,880
going it wasn't there we starved our

385
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,000
liver of nutrients we starved our liver

386
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,759
of the things it needs like the glucose

387
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,399
and the nutrients and the trace mineral

388
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:21,079
salts and everything that the liver

389
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:22,800
needs we starved it we didn't do it on

390
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:25,279
purpose it's not your fault it's

391
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,320
nobody's fault it happened it just

392
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,360
happened and that's how it works we're

393
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,600
not taught we don't know what to do a

394
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,040
lot of us don't have the access to do so

395
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,920
or the resources and we just go through

396
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:39,160
life and our liver gets stagnant and

397
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:41,160
sluggish and eventually the gallbladder

398
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,880
pays the price and so many people get

399
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,440
their gallbladder out later you know if

400
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,199
you can do like a

401
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:50,000
futuristic futuristic history with

402
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:52,079
people okay you look at a person you see

403
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,199
them now like they are hey they're doing

404
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:55,199
good they're out in the street they're

405
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:57,040
doing stuff they're playing pickle ball

406
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,759
they're having fun or they're out there

407
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,319
playing tennis and they're having fun or

408
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:02,319
they're swimming or on their be on the

409
00:16:00,319 --> 00:16:03,639
beach they're paddle boarding they're

410
00:16:02,319 --> 00:16:05,360
doing what they want they're biking

411
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:07,199
they're having a good time you're like

412
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,360
okay that's great right they look like

413
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,959
they're in good shape they look like

414
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:12,480
they're taking care of themselves or

415
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:15,680
they're just living their life and then

416
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:18,040
go go 40 years ahead of time and you see

417
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:21,360
and it's like a war zone right people's

418
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:24,319
lives change things happen I had a penic

419
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,560
out I had you know pentis I had a

420
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:28,120
gallbladder out I had that I had this

421
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,920
other problem here I got this other

422
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,319
problem here here you know I got four

423
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:35,079
nodules on my thyroid I had a thyroid

424
00:16:32,319 --> 00:16:37,560
surgery I had this times change and life

425
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:40,040
changes as the years go on but how do we

426
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:43,880
get to that point when it comes down to

427
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:46,120
gallbladders okay that is Cash Cow for

428
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:48,319
the hospitals Cash Cow for big Pharma

429
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,120
Cash Cow for the industry the medical

430
00:16:48,319 --> 00:16:52,240
industry it's the gallbladder business

431
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:56,600
and a big part of that is because the

432
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:59,079
liver has lost its Gusto it's been

433
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,839
nutrient deficient over time it's not

434
00:16:59,079 --> 00:17:04,679
converting the bow weakened it's not

435
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:06,720
strong it's not potent it's not going

436
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:08,880
right up into the gallbladder it's not

437
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,679
driving deep into the gallbladder and

438
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,079
pushing out the sludge and pushing out

439
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:16,039
the garbage instead we get in trouble

440
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:18,160
right Ron says cast oil packs can help

441
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:20,520
break up gall stones and kidney stones

442
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:23,799
as well I've never seen them break them

443
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:26,480
up I like CER oil packs I like them for

444
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:28,480
pain relief for people I do kind of acts

445
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,000
like an outside it's kind of acts like

446
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,559
an anti-inflammatory like a quick relief

447
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,400
anti-inflammatory so I'm not against

448
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,799
castor oil packs I think they're great

449
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,400
but I don't see them actually break up

450
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:41,640
kidney stones in people it's you know

451
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,000
but I see them give people relief though

452
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,880
when they got the kidney stones and the

453
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,840
gallbladder stones it gives them that

454
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,919
relief that I've seen for sure all the

455
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,000
35 years I've been doing this I see it

456
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,240
give people relief but they still end up

457
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,840
if they're you know if they if their

458
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,679
gallbladder gets all filled up with that

459
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,919
sand and that garbage and they don't

460
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:02,600
have enough of that liver power to do

461
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:05,039
what it needs to do to help get that

462
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:08,760
bile up there to break it up that's how

463
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:10,799
we get in trouble so our bile duck boom

464
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:13,640
as the bile is going up there it's weak

465
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:16,159
it's not as strong and it doesn't have

466
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,919
that strength in the stringency and if

467
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:20,880
it doesn't have that astringency it's

468
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:23,280
not going to actually dissolve what it

469
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:27,080
needs to dissolve and then sediment

470
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:29,640
turns into mud that mud forms into

471
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:32,240
Stones periodically depending on what's

472
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,559
really in there and then boom you know

473
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,320
that's where we get in trouble and

474
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:37,720
that's what happens very important

475
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:39,880
information if you're into gallbladders

476
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,559
if you're into livers we're talking

477
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,799
today about how to eat a little better

478
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:44,919
especially during the holidays when

479
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,480
we're dealing with anything in our life

480
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:48,039
chronic illness any kind of issues and

481
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,960
if we don't have chronic illness how do

482
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:51,919
we stay healthier during the holidays

483
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,520
talking about that too and one way is to

484
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:56,400
treat your liver right take care of your

485
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:58,760
liver make sure your liver is in good

486
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,320
shape you can do that while while going

487
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:02,600
through Christmas while going through

488
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,880
the holidays while going through New

489
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:07,240
Year you can take care of your liver

490
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,760
there's ways of doing it and that's what

491
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,520
we're going into now so let's go into

492
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,480
liver a little bit more which is really

493
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:14,000
important so our liver is the sponge

494
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,200
it's the filter I've been saying this

495
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
for years it's the very thing that's

496
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,559
holding all the toxins all the poisons

497
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,880
right all the different things that

498
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:25,600
we're up against viruses pathogens

499
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:28,840
bacteria all inside the liver the liver

500
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:31,159
becomes that sack right there that sack

501
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:32,520
that filter do you ever see a fish tank

502
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:34,000
you ever see that little carbon filter

503
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,480
in the fish tank it's sitting in there

504
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,360
in the fish tank that carbon filter it's

505
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,200
bubbling out right and the filter is

506
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:45,200
supposed to be actually keeping the tank

507
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:46,679
water cleaner for the fish and all that

508
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,320
all the different toxins that are in

509
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:50,720
that water it's supposed to go into the

510
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,840
carbon filter that's what your liver is

511
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:56,400
it's like you're the fish tank you're

512
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:58,600
the water tank right here and your liver

513
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,159
is the filter in that fish tank right

514
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:02,440
there so that is your filter now what

515
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:05,880
you don't want is you don't want your

516
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:08,600
filter getting old and nasty and gnarly

517
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:12,400
and fill the junk in garbage you don't

518
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:14,960
want that River being filled up with all

519
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,840
of that okay when it's getting nasty and

520
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,000
early and getting filled up with garbage

521
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:20,480
we get in trouble because the garbage

522
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,760
has to go somewhere else so where does

523
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,400
it go your lymphatic system so the more

524
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:27,480
your liver is stagnant and sluggish the

525
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:30,919
more your lymphatic system gets stagnant

526
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:32,960
and sluggish lymphatic system is the

527
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:34,320
Overflow so let's go into lymphatic

528
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,039
system a little bit I know a lot of you

529
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,679
guys love lymphatic system I hear a lot

530
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,039
of people talking about the lymphatic

531
00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:42,559
system everybody's going for the

532
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:44,159
drainage right you lay on the table and

533
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,480
they're like okay here you go and

534
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,440
they're rubbing everything and they're

535
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,960
working on your your lymph right they're

536
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,799
doing the whole thing you're like whoa I

537
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,480
feel better now then they're working on

538
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:54,679
your abdomen they're pushing down in

539
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,360
your abdomen and you're like okay I'm

540
00:20:54,679 --> 00:20:58,919
less bloated they're squeezing

541
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:01,840
everything out but what people have to

542
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:04,679
realize is it fills back up fills right

543
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,240
back up the next day fills right back up

544
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:08,880
the next week fills right back up it's

545
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:11,720
your overflow if your liver is nasty and

546
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,799
gnarly it dumps everything boom over

547
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,840
into your lymphatic system that's how it

548
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:18,159
works right I see people out there they

549
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:21,559
want to do lymphatic cleanup but they're

550
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:24,200
not doing liver cleanup they're doing

551
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:26,559
lymphatic cleanup but they're not doing

552
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,159
liver cleanup and that's where people

553
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,080
get in trouble it's like they're focused

554
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:32,400
seeing on their eyes on the wrong ball

555
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,799
they're lymphatic lymphatic lymphatic

556
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,600
lymphatic meanwhile it's the liver it's

557
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,919
the liver it's the liver that you have

558
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,960
to work on so your lymphatic system

559
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:43,400
doesn't become the garbage dump and the

560
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,400
garbage pit for when your liver is

561
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:47,720
completely stagnant sluggish and

562
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,360
overloaded very important to know right

563
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,760
there so if you guys are into lymphatic

564
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,080
systems and you want to take care of

565
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:55,120
your lymphatic system you want it

566
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:58,120
healthy you want your lymphatic system

567
00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:01,320
clean you want the color of the fluid

568
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:02,760
and your lymphatic system clear because

569
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,880
right there people don't know it but

570
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:07,320
they got the pus they got the yellow pus

571
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,799
inside their lymphatic system and that

572
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:12,320
yellow pus is because of the Overflow

573
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:14,760
from the liver pouring into the

574
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,880
lymphatic system that's what it is Li

575
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:18,559
liver gets overloaded your liver gets

576
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,279
burdened over burdened and stagnant and

577
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:23,960
sluggish all that overflow gets pushed

578
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:26,400
Boop into your lymphatic system and here

579
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:28,600
we are we're in lymphatic hell we're

580
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,039
getting the lymphatic drainage we don't

581
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:33,120
feel good our lym we're swelling we're

582
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:35,080
get the lymphodema we're not doing so

583
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,120
good we're always a little extra swollen

584
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:40,120
than we should and people get worried

585
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:42,200
about that and what's happening is our

586
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:44,039
livers are overburdened and let's go

587
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:47,360
into night time a little bit when we go

588
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:49,200
and sleep at night going ready for bed

589
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,840
and that's it it's time to go to bed we

590
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,520
click off the light and as the we hours

591
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,080
of the morning start kicking in your

592
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,320
liver is working it's working overtime

593
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,600
and that's what it's doing it's trying

594
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:01,679
to take the junk up and clean it up and

595
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,600
bag it up and get ready so it wants to

596
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,960
be flushed out in the morning we wake up

597
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,440
in the morning and we don't flush it out

598
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:09,240
that's what happens we wake up in the

599
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,120
morning and we're not doing our celery

600
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:13,080
juice we're not doing our lemon water we

601
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:16,000
end up doing something else wake up in

602
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:19,480
the morning and we end up putting fat in

603
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,320
our diet right fat in our breakfast and

604
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:24,600
when we do that we overload the liver

605
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:27,080
again we don't give our liver a chance

606
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:29,159
to recoup flush out the poisons and

607
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,960
toxins the liver stays stagnant and

608
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:34,919
sluggish and

609
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:39,919
then the liver can't push all that

610
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:42,760
garbage in the right spots the B's weak

611
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:44,880
the bile is actually lost its strength

612
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:47,520
the bile pushes up into the

613
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,840
gallbladder it takes some junk up with

614
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,279
it it doesn't get dispersed it's not

615
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:54,240
astringent enough our gallbladder starts

616
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:56,159
getting sicker our lymphatic system

617
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:59,559
starts getting mucker and yellow and

618
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:02,960
mucus and pus and every day we walk

619
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:04,600
around swollen we walk around with all

620
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,360
this junk in our liver and a stagnant

621
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:09,039
sluggish liver and then the holidays

622
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:12,039
come so that's the next thing too and

623
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:13,520
all of a sudden the holidays come along

624
00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:15,159
and we're just like eating whatever

625
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,200
we're eating we're over this person's

626
00:24:15,159 --> 00:24:18,440
house family's house friends's house

627
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,760
we're at the

628
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:22,520
office we're seeing everybody eat what

629
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:24,120
they want there's cakes there's cookies

630
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:26,679
there's treats there's Donuts there's

631
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:28,279
Bagels there's everything under the sun

632
00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:30,200
there's the cookies with Christ tree

633
00:24:28,279 --> 00:24:33,640
designs on it there's cookies with like

634
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:35,480
Rudolph on there and we're eating it all

635
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,159
and we're thinking too much sugar too

636
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:39,279
much sugar when really there's a lot of

637
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:41,279
fat in there and that fat starts to

638
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:44,279
burden in the liver starts to drag it

639
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:46,960
down and in the holidays we're like no

640
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:50,039
no it's New Year's Eve is coming I'm

641
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:52,320
gonna make a pledge I'm gonna commit I'm

642
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:54,240
gonna start January 1 I'm going to get

643
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:57,159
this weight off of me I'm going to do

644
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,360
everything I can and we're back to that

645
00:24:57,159 --> 00:25:00,320
again

646
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:03,000
so let's talk about like another thing

647
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:06,159
that takes a hit at this time of year so

648
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,720
what am I even talking about your liver

649
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:11,880
takes a hit at this time of year big

650
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:15,559
time your gallbladder takes a hit big

651
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:20,720
time this time of year your pancreas

652
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:22,080
takes a hit big time this year any year

653
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,320
this time of

654
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:28,559
year so what happens is that this time

655
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:31,679
of year those three things take a huge

656
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:33,720
hit right there and guess what our

657
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,640
stomach takes a hit too unfortunately

658
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:38,200
when all that's taking a hit let's go

659
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:41,440
into that a little bit so a lot of

660
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:45,480
people have gut rot in their intestinal

661
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:47,559
tract in their colon gut rot why do they

662
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:49,480
have the gut rot because their food's

663
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:50,919
not breaking down one of the reasons

664
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:55,000
their food's not breaking down is their

665
00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:57,120
HCL is low their HCL is low their little

666
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,440
gastric glands these tiny little glands

667
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,679
inside their stomach get weak and beat

668
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,000
up over

669
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:06,279
time and we end up

670
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,799
killing those little gastric glands they

671
00:26:06,279 --> 00:26:11,760
don't work as good we don't produce the

672
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:14,679
HCL we need that hydrochloric acid isn't

673
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:17,360
breaking down the protein we're dumping

674
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:19,960
protein in we're dumping all kinds of

675
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:22,399
stuff in and our HCL is not breaking it

676
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:24,720
down and that protein goes down into the

677
00:26:22,399 --> 00:26:28,799
gut and it starts to

678
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:31,159
rot and then your liver is like I don't

679
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:33,240
have enough bio I can't break down the

680
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:35,360
fat I can't break down some of the other

681
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:39,399
nutrients I can't break down some of the

682
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:42,120
other particles and boom now we have

683
00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:44,679
that problem too you got rotting fat

684
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:47,799
going rancid you got rotting protein

685
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:49,720
going bad everything's going sour it's

686
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:52,360
fermenting did you ever run into that

687
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:54,840
with people at all where you smell it on

688
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:59,000
their breath do you get a breath test

689
00:26:54,840 --> 00:27:01,679
from them get the breath test right

690
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,600
you smell it on the breath right did you

691
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:06,760
ever get that with someone where it's

692
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:09,840
like you just smell it it's fermented

693
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:11,440
it's sour it smells like sourdough it's

694
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,640
like hey man did you just have sour

695
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,480
dough

696
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:17,279
bread dude did did you just have sour

697
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:20,279
dough bread or

698
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:23,039
what is that what you had because guess

699
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:26,159
what that stuff stinks it's fermenting

700
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:27,919
you got a soup in here stuff is rotting

701
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:30,840
you got all kinds of different protein

702
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:33,799
and fat down in the bowels and they're

703
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:35,640
rotting yeah all that ammonia is being

704
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:36,960
produced the ammonia is actually going

705
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:39,120
through your body it's coming out of

706
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,919
your skin it's coming out of your

707
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,919
armpits it's coming out of everywhere

708
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:46,519
it's coming out of your ass it's coming

709
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:50,120
out of your mouth it just stinks the

710
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:53,080
ammonia and then all that broken down

711
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:55,799
ammonia that's just rising and floating

712
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:57,519
everywhere is lifting off taking off

713
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:59,760
getting stronger and stronger and your

714
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:02,120
your proteins are not breaking down and

715
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:04,039
more fermentation is happening and more

716
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:06,039
rotting is happening it's called gut rot

717
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:07,519
so people walk around with gut rot

718
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:12,600
that's what they

719
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:15,919
do heavy fatty meals hit the pancreas

720
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:18,720
hard and the pancreas has to pump out

721
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:20,960
insulin that hormone has to be pumping

722
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,159
out and when it's pumping out that's

723
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,320
another thing let's go into that a

724
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,399
little bit so we talked about the

725
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:28,039
stomach people's stomach gastric glands

726
00:28:25,399 --> 00:28:29,919
don't produce HCL

727
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:32,120
they can't break down the proteins their

728
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:34,679
liver can't break down the fats as good

729
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:36,880
so the liver right the bile weakens

730
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:41,200
we're in that your gallbladder gets

731
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:42,720
sluggish fill the junk sediment sand all

732
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,600
kinds of different rocks start to

733
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:48,559
actually get produced in there and then

734
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:51,880
your pancreas has to produce lots of

735
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:54,240
insulin because we're eating so many

736
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:57,200
Abominations we're eating so much stuff

737
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:59,720
that's fun we're having too much sugar

738
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,240
and fat combined we're having it

739
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:03,480
combined and when we do that we're

740
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:05,000
getting insulin resistance so

741
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:07,679
everybody's walking around at this time

742
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,120
of year like on the edge your A1C is

743
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,760
about to go up they're they're about to

744
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:14,240
get a piece of plaque broken in an

745
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,120
artery going up to their brain or lung

746
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,760
they're about to get something else

747
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:19,519
happened have a heart attack people

748
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,519
stroke out this time of year A lot of

749
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:23,679
times because they're dehydrated their

750
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:26,320
body's filled sluggish filled with all

751
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:28,760
that dirty blood syndrome their pancreas

752
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:31,120
too much insulin so much insulin

753
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:33,440
resistance it's out of control and then

754
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:35,000
their liver is so sluggish and stagnant

755
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,039
the food's not breaking down and

756
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,679
digesting good doesn't it sound like a

757
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:41,399
nightmare yeah it doesn't seem like a

758
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:43,120
nightmare but it is for so many people

759
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:45,120
the thing is with sugar just so we don't

760
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,320
confuse things you need sugar to survive

761
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:51,000
but when we eat a lot of sugar and then

762
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:52,919
fat combined together the pancreas has

763
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,279
to work even harder and produce more

764
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:56,919
insulin and then boom we're blocking the

765
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:58,760
sugar from getting into the cells

766
00:29:56,919 --> 00:30:00,320
because of all that fat that's there and

767
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:02,000
then we get nutrient deficient from that

768
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:04,000
all on itself it's a whole another story

769
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,440
in insulin resistance and diabetes and

770
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,320
everything but we don't need to go there

771
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,159
right now let's start making some food

772
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:12,559

pepper hot peppers almost anything the

932
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,560
only thing is you might get somebody

933
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:26,160
like a family member or a friend and

934
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:29,160
they're just they're not into the

935
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:31,880
they're not into the hot

936
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:33,960
pepper it's a little too much for

937
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:36,440
them I'm going to make two kinds of

938
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:38,839
guacamole this is the basic one right up

939
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,839
front

little

950
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:12,079
bit I'm excited about that this is

951
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,920

952
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:16,839

lime in there and a hot pepper cayenne

955
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:24,200

1190
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:20,280
guacamole right here so I'm going to

1191
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,880
take it apart for you is what I'm going

1192
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:25,880
to do about

1193
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:27,559

00:49:27,559 --> 00:49:35,839
guys and that's the piece right

1196
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:38,400
there all right that is the same system

1197
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:38,400
as the other

1198
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:46,839
one all right I'm going to make some

1199
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:46,839
hummus let's go let's get going on

1200
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:57,319
this let's make some garbanzo bean

1201
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:59,319
hummus

1202
00:49:57,319 --> 00:50:02,040
is what we're going to

1203
00:49:59,319 --> 00:50:04,040
do all right and let's get a bowl out

1204
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:06,440
for

1205
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:08,000
that could be a little bit of avocado

1206
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:09,960
left over in this hummus but I don't

1207
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,920
care you can rinse it out you can clean

1208
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:14,119
it out really quick I got the sink right

1209
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:15,319
here I can take this rinse it right out

1210
00:50:14,119 --> 00:50:17,240
but I'm going to leave it in because

1211
00:50:15,319 --> 00:50:19,000
there's no really worry about it there's

1212
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:21,720
no need if a little bit of guacamole

1213
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,079
ends up in my hummus that's fine but if

1214
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:26,000
you're somebody that wants to just give

1215
00:50:23,079 --> 00:50:28,119
it a quick rinse easy to do you can put

1216
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,520
it back on you can make other stuff so

1217
00:50:28,119 --> 00:50:31,920
what I have right here is a bowl of

1218
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:34,920
chickpeas garbanza

1219
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:40,680
beans you guys can

1220
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:40,680
see and I'm going to make hummus get

1221
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:45,760
this I'm GNA make it without using

1222
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:47,960
Sesame tahini I'm not going to use a

1223
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:49,760
whole bunch of tahini in here I'm not

1224
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:52,599
not going to dump a whole bunch of olive

1225
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:55,200
oil in here either this is easier food

1226
00:50:52,599 --> 00:50:55,960
on the liver that's what this is keep in

1227
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,480
mind

1228
00:50:55,960 --> 00:51:00,280
it's easier food on the liver so what

1229
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:05,240
you see is sesame seeds take a look you

1230
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:08,839
can get the flavor of Sesame in your

1231
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:10,400
hummus without burdening the liver with

1232
00:51:08,839 --> 00:51:13,520
too much

1233
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:16,400
oil too much tahini you don't need to do

1234
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:19,559
that you can make a hummus and just use

1235
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:21,400
some sesame seeds in here get it ground

1236
00:51:19,559 --> 00:51:23,920
up all the same in there that's that's

1237
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:26,440
the difference so let's

1238
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:28,160
go let's drop some of these garbanzo

1239
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:31,079
beans in here right

1240
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:35,079
here you can make hummus without olive

1241
00:51:31,079 --> 00:51:38,480
oil without tahini check this out right

1242
00:51:35,079 --> 00:51:41,960
I got some I got some garbanzos coming

1243
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:42,720
through you guys look this is easier on

1244
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:46,559
the

1245
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:50,359
liver you realize like how very little

1246
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:52,960
this is a handful of sesame seeds much

1247
00:51:50,359 --> 00:51:55,400
different than a tablespoon of tahini in

1248
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:58,040
somebody's Hest right look at this see

1249
00:51:55,400 --> 00:52:01,119
have the seeds going there so very

1250
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:05,760
little but yet the flavor is knock your

1251
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:08,640
socks off flavor is insane like it's so

1252
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:11,400
good look dropping that in here this is

1253
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:14,240
a basic hummus you don't have to go too

1254
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:16,559
crazy Mary says best thing is that

1255
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:18,280
juicer takes less than five minutes to

1256
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:19,760
clean it's so quick I could have

1257
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:21,559
actually cleaned this whole part right

1258
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:24,280
here had you guys wait probably would

1259
00:52:21,559 --> 00:52:26,440
have done it in a minute and a half

1260
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:28,280
right

1261
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:32,280
all right so what you're seeing right

1262
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:35,599
here is hummus being made do you like

1263
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:38,240
it's spicy do you like your hummus hot

1264
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:41,599

why this is liver friendly that amount

1278
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:20,640
of sesame seed is nothing compared to a

1279
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:23,559
tablespoon of Sesame butter it's nothing

1280
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:26,839
compared to that like seriously you can

1281
00:53:23,559 --> 00:53:30,200

1282
00:53:26,839 --> 00:53:32,760

right and there isn't a tablespoon of

1318
00:55:05,799 --> 00:55:11,440
oil there's not a tablespoon of olive

1319
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:14,720
oil there isn't a tablespoon of tahini

1320
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:16,920
in here it's easy on the liver easy on

1321
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,920
the

1322
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:21,359
bile bile production in the liver

1323
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:23,079
people's livers can't break down enough

1324
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:25,440
fat then it sits in their colon their

1325
00:55:23,079 --> 00:55:28,160
small intestinal tract it goes r it and

1326
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:30,880
it feeds everything that shouldn't

1327
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:33,480
feed so I'm just mixing this

you I read your

1573
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:36,880
comments All

1574
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:38,680

that I am going to

1577
01:07:40,359 --> 01:07:46,079
do now you can do the sesame seeds and

1578
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:48,640
it doesn't burden down the liver because

1579
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:51,599
think about you're only using this much

1580
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:53,119
even if you used a lot of sesame seeds

1581
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:55,400
it's not going to equate to even a

1582
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:58,200
tablespoon of Sesame butter you can use

1583
01:07:55,400 --> 01:08:02,880

1662
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:03,280
here is I

1663
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:06,360
got the pan

1664
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:08,040

1665
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:10,679
PE hummus in a second but we're going to

1666
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:12,159
talk about the liver for a moment now if

1667
01:12:10,679 --> 01:12:14,159
you got just got on here just so you

1668
01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:15,520
know like what am I doing like what is

1669
01:12:14,159 --> 01:12:17,760
going on we're talking about easy

1670
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:19,840
recipes on the liver we're talking about

1671
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:22,480
stagnant sluggish liver how people walk

1672
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:24,760
around with that they have a fatty liver

1673
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:26,280
bioproduction is minimal and so many

1674
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:27,520
people they can't break down their fats

1675
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:31,480
their fats go

1676
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:33,960
rancid food rots in their gut intestinal

1677
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:35,440
track and ferments and feeds everything

1678
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:38,880
in there that shouldn't be in there

1679
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:41,040
pathogens bacteria viruses and so

1680
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:42,360
forth and we're talking about how

1681
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:44,080
there's so much sludge in people's

1682
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:46,920
gallbladders that sits there because the

1683
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:49,960
bile reserves are so low the bile can't

1684
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:51,560
get to this the gallbladder it's not

1685
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:53,080
astringent enough it gets into the

1686
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:54,719
gallbladder but it's fill the sludge

1687
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:56,159
it's weak weak it's not potent and then

1688
01:12:54,719 --> 01:12:58,320
all that junk builds up in your

1689
01:12:56,159 --> 01:13:00,760
gallbladder like I was talking about

1690
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:03,440
earlier and then people's stomach glands

1691
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:06,000
are weak they can't actually break down

1692
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:08,080
their proteins properly their HCL is low

1693
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:10,560
then all you got all this putrifying

1694
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:11,920
protein with gut rot right we talked

1695
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:13,800
about that I'm giving everybody a little

1696
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:16,600
quick

1697
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:18,920
rundown but even with all of that I'm

1698
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:21,400
talking about how we can do things for

1699
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:23,880
ourselves that are easy on the system I

1700
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:26,880
just made some killer recipes

1701
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:29,080
that are easier on the system than

1702
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:30,880
anybody's like stuff that they're eating

1703
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:33,600
these days with all the different fats

1704
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:36,199
in there all the different combinations

1705
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:38,080
people are eating way way too much fat

1706
01:13:36,199 --> 01:13:40,679
in their diet at this time of year they

1707
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:43,400
mix fat and sugar together they get

1708
01:13:40,679 --> 01:13:46,080
insulin resistance their blood sugar is

1709
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:47,719
totally out of whack right their livers

1710
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:49,840
are burning down more than ever they

1711
01:13:47,719 --> 01:13:52,040
start gaining a little bit of weight I

1712
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:55,199
made some incredible guacamole just like

1713
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:57,440
that that quick we made hummuses we made

1714
01:13:55,199 --> 01:14:00,400
guacamole we're not even

1715
01:13:57,440 --> 01:14:02,920
done and we got some other stuff I got

1716
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:05,360
this pan on so here's what I'm going to

1717
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:11,440
do this next thing I'm

1718
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:13,800
making you guys is a pea

1719
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:16,120
hummus so let's go into that a little

1720
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:19,760
bit I got some peas right

1721
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:22,400
here think look frozen

1722
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:25,600
peas pan getting hot yep it's getting

1723
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:27,280
hot frozen peas are and then you put you

1724
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:29,920
don't put water in your pan you don't

1725
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:31,840
add water you just keep it just frozen

1726
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:34,320
peas if you have fresh peas that's a

1727
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:35,560
miracle if you actually have fresh peas

1728
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:38,360
that's actually

1729
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:41,440
incredible but I'm using frozen

1730
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:43,320
peas get them right out of your freezer

1731
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:45,040
dropping them right down in here just

1732
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:49,159
like

1733
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:49,159
this right in the pan can you see

1734
01:14:49,639 --> 01:14:56,400
that all

1735
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:58,400
right okay now that pan is getting hot

1736
01:14:56,400 --> 01:15:01,679
so the goal is you make them

1737
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:04,320
toasty you actually don't add water you

1738
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:07,920
don't add oil so you don't want to add

1739
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:10,880
any kind of oil to that pea hummus you

1740
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:13,280
can add sesame seeds to your P hummus

1741
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:16,159
later which we're going to do but you

1742
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:17,880
don't have to add oil so this is so cool

1743
01:15:16,159 --> 01:15:20,840
so on the pan right

1744
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:23,639
there they're going to get hot now I put

1745
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:27,000
the I put the heat up high but you got

1746
01:15:23,639 --> 01:15:29,120
to watch them so once they start popping

1747
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:30,280
they kind of like popcorn you need to

1748
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:32,800
keep an eye on them you don't want to

1749
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:35,040
burn your pan you don't want to burn

1750
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:37,120
them or overcook them but you want to

1751
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:39,840
get them toasty enough that's what makes

1752
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:42,280
this hummus so incredible if you can't

1753
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:44,239
do beans or lentils this is another

1754
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:45,880
option how many people they just won't

1755
01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:48,159
do beans completely understand there's a

1756
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:49,639
lot of people that don't do them not

1757
01:15:48,159 --> 01:15:51,280
judging you at all I think that's great

1758
01:15:49,639 --> 01:15:53,199
if you don't do them it's great for what

1759
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:55,520
you're doing and then but the peun

1760
01:15:53,199 --> 01:15:56,880
hummus is that other option for so many

1761
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:58,600
people that don't have hummus but one

1762
01:15:56,880 --> 01:16:01,480
and Colleen says I avoided peas for

1763
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:04,520
years thinking they were carbs so they

1764
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:07,639
were bad for me same with potatoes I'm

1765
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:09,719
so thrilled to have them both back in my

1766
01:16:07,639 --> 01:16:11,800
life thank you for doing that for

1767
01:16:09,719 --> 01:16:13,040
yourself Colleen that is really special

1768
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:15,960
and really

1769
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:17,840
great all right let these babies cook up

1770
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:19,440
a little bit let's get that Heat going

1771
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:21,840
there I might even throw a lid on it for

1772
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:26,000
a few minutes so let me find that lid

1773
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:26,000
where are you what's going

1774
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:31,050
on

1775
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:33,400
aw's kitchen

1776
01:16:31,050 --> 01:16:36,480
[Music]

1777
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:39,560
here we might have something down

1778
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:42,040
here we got a

1779
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:43,000
lid the chances of that so get that

1780
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:45,440
cooking and we're going to talk about

1781
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:47,679
the liver a little bit

1782
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:50,440
more all

1783
01:16:47,679 --> 01:16:52,920
right and I'm going to make some Nut

1784
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:54,080
Butter I'm going to show you some nut

1785
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:57,000
butter butter that's what I'm going to

1786
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:59,679
do let me do

1787
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:02,560
that all right you guys take a look at

1788
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:04,920
this for a second I want to show you

1789
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:07,400
something I made

1790
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:09,120
these I don't know is it months ago how

1791
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:12,560
long was it you guys remember when I

1792
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:15,560
made these take a

1793
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:15,560
look

1794
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:22,639
okay do you see any oil come

1795
01:17:19,159 --> 01:17:26,239
out you didn't see oil come out right

1796
01:17:22,639 --> 01:17:29,520
it's not pouring out this has been

1797
01:17:26,239 --> 01:17:32,840
sitting for quite a while I don't know

1798
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:35,320
two three months maybe it's four months

1799
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:37,360
now I mean don't quote me on the exact

1800
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:41,080
time but it's been a while at least it

1801
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:42,560
feels like a long time right take a look

1802
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:44,400
this is what I'm talking about about

1803
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:47,199
being easier on the liver do you guys

1804
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:48,840
catch my drift right now it's another

1805
01:17:47,199 --> 01:17:55,000
one right there it's N A different kind

1806
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:56,719

01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:33,720

1818
01:18:30,340 --> 01:18:33,720
[Music]

1819
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:39,520
something show you something little

1820
01:18:37,199 --> 01:18:39,520
magic

1821
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:45,280
[Music]

1822
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:50,960
trick I got a popular Nut Butter

1823
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:50,960
brand that just says it only has

1824
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:54,920
nuts

1825
01:19:03,639 --> 01:19:08,719
take a

1826
01:19:05,239 --> 01:19:08,719
look did you see

1827
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:15,280
that

1828
01:19:12,679 --> 01:19:19,480
okay that is not a

1829
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:24,880
trick that is not a

1830
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:28,360
prank you're looking at a of oil they

1831
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:31,920
came off the top of that jar of nut

1832
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:36,520
butter that is not a

1833
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:39,199
hoax no it's not see

1834
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:43,120
because most of all the nut Butters out

1835
01:19:39,199 --> 01:19:47,360
there oil is added and mixed into it it

1836
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:49,360
reduces the cost to use cheaper bulk oil

1837
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:51,280
even if it's the same oil as the peanut

1838
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:55,080
meaning the same type right peanut then

1839
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:58,360
peanut oil almond an almond oil Sesame

1840
01:19:55,080 --> 01:20:01,199
Sesame oil right but they add more a lot

1841
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:04,600
of times it's not even the same oil but

1842
01:20:01,199 --> 01:20:06,520
they add more and then the oil comes

1843
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:08,320
from a different part of the world it's

1844
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:10,639
comes in bulk it arrives at the nut

1845
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:12,320
putter companies and then they have all

1846
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:16,480
that oil that's bulk and then they have

1847
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:20,320
all the nuts and they do a mix they do a

1848
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:20,320
mix there's a reason for

1849
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:27,840
that and so I wanted to show you why is

1850
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:31,320
it important because it's hard on the

1851
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:32,600
liver so we're making recipes that are

1852
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:34,639
easy on the

1853
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:37,280
liver is what we're

1854
01:20:34,639 --> 01:20:39,159
doing so we're making a nut butter but

1855
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:41,440
first of all I have peas cooking right

1856
01:20:39,159 --> 01:20:43,400
here I'm going to move this oil over

1857
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:44,639
here for a little bit bring these over

1858
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:47,239
here

1859
01:20:44,639 --> 01:20:49,040
too all right I just wanted to show you

1860
01:20:47,239 --> 01:20:52,239
that that's really important and that's

1861
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:54,360
just one right here I mean I got a whole

1862
01:20:52,239 --> 01:20:56,600
bunch of jars in the back of different

1863
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:58,920
brands that I purchased a couple of

1864
01:20:56,600 --> 01:21:01,239
months ago like two three months ago and

1865
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:02,880
they sat and then they all have that

1866
01:21:01,239 --> 01:21:08,440
much oil at the

1867
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:08,440
top but mine can sit and not have

1868
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:13,520
that the ones that I'm talking about in

1869
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:15,760

1870
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:19,960
