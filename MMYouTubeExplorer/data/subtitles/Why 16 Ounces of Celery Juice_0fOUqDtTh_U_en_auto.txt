[0.18 - 4.35] the greatest mistake you can make is
[2.16 - 7.16] mixing things in your celery juice it's
[4.35 - 9.66] critical you don't mix water ice cubes
[7.16 - 11.91] lemon-lime other fruits and vegetables
[9.66 - 14.22] collagen apple cider vinegar charcoal
[11.91 - 16.38] protein powder or anything in your
[14.22 - 18.09] celery juice this is how it works when
[16.38 - 20.40] you add those things in you dilute that
[18.09 - 22.29] chemical compounds so when you drink
[20.40 - 24.30] your celery juice it doesn't do what
[22.29 - 26.67] it's supposed to do I was suffering with
[24.30 - 29.16] like really difficult to digestive
[26.67 - 31.35] problems like constipation lots of gas
[29.16 - 35.25] and bloating celery juice is the newest
[31.35 - 37.14] thing out there medical medium cures
[35.25 - 39.33] everything I started noticing my body
[37.14 - 41.28] coming back to life right away when you
[39.33 - 43.32] drink 16 ounces of solar juice on an
[41.28 - 45.48] empty stomach that's where the magic is
[43.32 - 47.58] that's where the miracle powers are it
[45.48 - 49.53] enters into your gastric glands it
[47.58 - 52.29] rebuilds them so they can produce
[49.53 - 54.48] hydrochloric acid to break down proteins
[52.29 - 56.46] so proteins don't rot in your gut and
[54.48 - 58.56] then it goes into your small intestinal
[56.46 - 59.94] tract where it runs into food that you
[58.56 - 61.86] might have in there from the dinner
[59.94 - 65.25] before then it has to kill off pathogens
[61.86 - 67.47] bacteria viruses yeast mold unproductive
[65.25 - 69.33] fungus then it travels down it has to
[67.47 - 71.22] eventually get into the liver through
[69.33 - 72.81] the paddock portal vein once it's in
[71.22 - 74.52] your liver it builds up your bio
[72.81 - 76.95] reserves helping to improve your
[74.52 - 78.54] digestion by breaking down fats then
[76.95 - 80.49] after that it heads to the gallbladder
[78.54 - 83.16] and starts to dissolve the gall stones
[80.49 - 85.41] and that's why it has to be at least 16
[83.16 - 87.27] ounces to have enough liquid to get
[85.41 - 89.37] through the entire obstacle course that
[87.27 - 91.32] you have in your body so you can heal
[89.37 - 93.30] and move forward one of the first things
[91.32 - 96.03] that I started doing that I read from
[93.30 - 97.92] his book was the 16 ounces of celery
[96.03 - 99.87] juice in the morning on an empty
[97.92 - 102.27] stomach I remember just feeling like ah
[99.87 - 104.43] yes this is what I needed and it
[102.27 - 106.56] instantly clicked for me the reason why
[104.43 - 108.84] you have to juice celery is because if
[106.56 - 111.36] you leave the pulp or the fiber in there
[108.84 - 113.19] it won't work when you leave the fiber
[111.36 - 115.77] and the pulp you're trapping the
[113.19 - 117.99] medicine slowing it down stopping your
[115.77 - 120.69] digestion so you can't get the medicine
[117.99 - 123.12] to work if you drink tea you don't eat
[120.69 - 125.16] the teabags you have to extract the
[123.12 - 126.69] medicine out of it and consume it
[125.16 - 129.66] without the pulp in the fiber it's the
[126.69 - 142.37] only way it's going to help you heal
[129.66 - 144.43] [Music]
[142.37 - 144.43] you
