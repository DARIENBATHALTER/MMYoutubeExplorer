82
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:20,640

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,080
top which is so Savory and spicy and

84
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,720
yummy it's like barbecue beef ribs the

85
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,840
things everybody loves to eat and

86
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,879
remembers eating sucking on those ribs

87
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,959
in those restaurants where at a cookout

88
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:33,560
right all that fat around the rib and

89
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:35,879
they're just devouring it and they got

90
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,159
all that kind of like what is that sauce

91
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:40,319
on top that rib sauce all over it and

92
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,519
their face it's all sweet and hot and

93
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,280
syrupy and they're like tearing into

94
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:46,879
those ribs and pull the meat off those

95
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,720
pork ribs those cow ribs we're not doing

96
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:52,000
that we're using eggplant which is so

97
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:54,760
much better for you you don't need pork

98
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,720
fat in your bloodstream people don't

99
00:03:54,760 --> 00:04:00,519
really need that but eggplant really

100
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,840
exciting great food to work with

101
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:04,519
all right so let's get into it a little

102
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,280
bit and just so you know I hear a noise

103
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:09,519
in the distance it is my steamer and my

104
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,319
steamer is bubbling up

105
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,680
going and what it's doing is it's got

106
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,160
carrots in there because we're making

107
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:19,440
the nacho cheese correct we're using

108
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,600
cheese that's not the fake garbage vegan

109
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,440
cheese that's out there in the store

110
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,199
that's got natural flavors in it citric

111
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,560
acid and all this junk and all this

112
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,440
hidden stuff in there cuz they're

113
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,400
allowed to put up up to 10% ingredients

114
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,199
in into those vegan cheeses that are not

115
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,960
listed on the label so you're sitting

116
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,440
with those vegan cheeses at the store

117
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,919
and you're like this is great a vegan

118
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,160
cheese and it's loaded with all kinds of

119
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:42,240
different garbage and junk and

120
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,280
everything we're going to make our own

121
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,039
nacho cheese baby we're going to make

122
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,560
our own cheese and it's got carrots in

123
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:49,960
there and so forth so I'm excited about

124
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,960
that so don't worry about the steamer

125
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,880
you hear in the distance cuz I hear it

126
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:56,199
and I love hearing that sound when I

127
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:58,440
hear that sound it's like a beautiful

128
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:01,680
sound in the distance saying healthy

129
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:05,720
food is in inside that steamer and it's

130
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:08,840
sitting there percolating just right

131
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,720
anyway um I think we should get down to

132
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,800
it is what I think we should

133
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,759
do see guys if you just rolled in we're

134
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,960
going to talk about hot packs cold packs

135
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,560
you name it and I'm going to make a be

136
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:23,520
line really quick to the freezer and I'm

137
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:26,280
going to get an icy icy cold cold pack

138
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,639
out which is really important for this

139
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,720
demonstration so over here in my freezer

140
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,880
I'm opening it up right now I got two in

141
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,039
my

142
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:36,680
freezer because if you ever get an

143
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:39,000
injury or you need a cold pack for

144
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:41,919
somebody in the family or a friend or

145
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,080
anything it's good to have two because

146
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,560
one will eventually not be cold anymore

147
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,680
so when you're using it for a knee

148
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,000
injury or you're twist your ankle or you

149
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,400
sprain your ankle or you're somebody

150
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,400
with chronic illness that's just having

151
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,840
that unknown chronic inflammation and

152
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:00,080
aches and pains in the body that is

153
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,280
mysterious where you just feel like

154
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,680
you're 100 years old you wake up in the

155
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:07,120
morning you get out of bed and you feel

156
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,560
like you're 80 years old and you're like

157
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,759
why do I feel this way everything hurts

158
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,039
and aches and you're somebody like that

159
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:17,160
and you rely on cold

160
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:19,120
packs okay and when you rely on them you

161
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,800
usually need two so that's one tip all

162
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,440
on its own one doesn't really cut it

163
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,960
especially if you want to get a good

164
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:29,479
half an hour or 40 minutes into cooling

165
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,680
something down getting inflammation down

166
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:33,319
now I know some of you guys do ice baths

167
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,039
and stuff like that it's a trendy thing

168
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:37,160
but it I'm going to talk about how that

169
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,960
doesn't cut the mustard because it's

170
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:42,680
your entire body going into the cold so

171
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,560
it can't localize the area and get the

172
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:47,520
inflammation down that's important to

173
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,280
know athletes athletes actually can do

174
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,319
ice baths and stuff like that to cool

175
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,919
the body temp down if they're really

176
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:56,080
revved up and heated up like seriously

177
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:58,039
they were on the field and they go

178
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,440
straight from there or straight from a

179
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:02,599
workout practice and they go right into

180
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,199
a cold bath I mean that that's what

181
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:06,800
people do and of course there's other

182
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:08,960
therapies that require cold but when

183
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,639
you're chronically sick or you got an

184
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:14,879
injury that's in a certain area you

185
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:16,639
can't do the ice bath and medical mem

186
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:18,720
information I don't recommend the ice

187
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,800
baths because what happens is it drives

188
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,039
your adrenals into chaos so that's

189
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,120
something to know right there now I do

190
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:27,639
see un social a lot of people they're

191
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,400
trying out like ice baths and they do

192
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:31,000
the D they dip into it and they get

193
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,240
ready they get their suit on or they go

194
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
in their tub is filled with ice and what

195
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,120
they're doing is they're trashing their

196
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,639
adrenals and they don't know this I want

197
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,280
to go into that a little bit before we

198
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,400
go into localizing with cold packs and

199
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,319
so forth Uma says I hope you have these

200
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:48,479
listed on your website you can find a

201
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:50,800
link in the description and profile okay

202
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,440
at medicalmedium.com that's where you go

203
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,520
and you'll find the link that takes you

204
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:57,159
right to the directory area where you'll

205
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:59,319
see things like the the heating pad the

206
00:07:57,159 --> 00:08:02,599
hot water bottle and the cold pack of

207
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:04,759
and all that so first all I just want to

208
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:07,199
just go into right away about the ice

209
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:09,520
baths that people are doing okay one

210
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:12,560
thing I don't like about the ice bats is

211
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:15,319
the body thinks it's in danger when you

212
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,520
submerge yourself in icy cold water so

213
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:20,240
your body goes into the chaos moment

214
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,800
fight or flight and as it goes into

215
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,560
fight ORF flight your adrenals are

216
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,199
totally just blowing out adrenaline

217
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:28,240
epinephrine everywhere because the

218
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:31,519
adrenaline is rushing through your veins

219
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:34,279
to try to stop you from going into

220
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:37,680
hypothermia keep that in mind so when we

221
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:41,200
do ice bath dips and we do them for

222
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:44,279
quite some time our body goes into

223
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:47,240
urgent urgent emergency

224
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:49,519
emergency something's wrong you have to

225
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:53,240
protect the brain the brain has to be

226
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:55,920
protected so then your adrenals flood

227
00:08:53,240 --> 00:09:00,399
literally a big portion of your

228
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:04,000
adrenaline out at once a big portion 85

229
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:06,160
to 90% of adrenaline gets released and

230
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,760
spewed out of your adrenals that

231
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,399
adrenaline is circulating through your

232
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:13,200
body because it's there to try to keep

233
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:15,839
your blood circulating to try to

234
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,040
increase your heart rate so that your

235
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,079
heart rate doesn't go down as you go

236
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:22,720
into hypothermia so keep that in mind

237
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:25,920
when we do ice baths this is not an ice

238
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,240
bath demonstration or talk but I'm going

239
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,800
into that because so many people are

240
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:33,399
going to say whoa if cold p are really

241
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,560
good for me if localizing cold packs are

242
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:36,320
really good for me and they're good for

243
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,680
my AES and pains let me go do what

244
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,920
people are doing out there and let me go

245
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,480
hop into a tub with ice and water in

246
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,160
there but no that actually lowers the

247
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,160
immune system with someone with chronic

248
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:49,320
illness so anyone who's struggling with

249
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,320
any kind of condition the Deep ice bath

250
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,480
time you know that 5 minutes in the ice

251
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,279
bath that 3 minutes that's 10 minutes

252
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,120
that 15 minutes people do in the ice

253
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,800
bath is actually the worst thing they

254
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,640
can do with chronic illness because it

255
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,480
it hinders the immune system because

256
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:06,120
when all that adrenaline is released for

257
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,640
that figh ORF flate Mo moment when all

258
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,120
that adrenaline and epinephrine is just

259
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,839
coursing through the veins that wears

260
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,200
down your white blood count your killer

261
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,600
cells it wears down your lymphocytes it

262
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,440
breaks down your immune system and

263
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,240
that's what occurs when you do those ice

264
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,519
baths so I just want everybody to know

265
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,560
that there's a white blood cell right

266
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:27,959
there so when we go and do those ice

267
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:30,480
baths okay it's different when you're

268
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:32,959
someone and you got a raging fever

269
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:36,079
you're somebody that you have a raging

270
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:38,240
fever you can't get it under control

271
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:41,079
you're cooking at a 1004

272
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,480
105 and yes you get into the tub for a

273
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:45,240
little bit to try to drive that

274
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,000
temperature down but I'm talking about

275
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,720
therape you're talking to your doctor

276
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,760
and the whole bit about it I'm talking

277
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,279
about

278
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,519
therapeutically the ice baths create a

279
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:57,079
lot of Chaos in the body jack up the

280
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:58,560
adrenaline lower the white blood cell

281
00:10:57,079 --> 00:11:00,760
count if you're somebody with chronic

282
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,200
illness that that is not going to fix a

283
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:05,600
problem it's going to set somebody back

284
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,440
it'll if they do it regularly it's going

285
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,040
to give them adrenal fatigue over time

286
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,480
so you know it's interesting you'll see

287
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,720
people out there you're like yeah my

288
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,399
adrenals aren't good and I got to do

289
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,720
things that protect my adrenals and

290
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:20,279
they'll jump into a cold bath they'll

291
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:22,320
sit there in icy water and they're going

292
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:23,720
to be hindering and damaging their

293
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,680
adrenals and they're going to set

294
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,639
themselves up for adrenal fatigue over

295
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,839
time so it's number one right there to

296
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:32,600
talk about when you're chronic sick and

297
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:35,320
chronically ill very important to know

298
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:39,360
so back to now cold packs and so

299
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:41,320
forth all right B vova says but how are

300
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,560
so many folks healing themselves with

301
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:45,680
the ice baths really they're healing

302
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,480
themselves with the ice baths I mean

303
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,200
that's not really what I've seen out

304
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,560
there so much and I've seen the ice

305
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,720
baths out there for many years that's

306
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:56,399
been going on like cold baths and and

307
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:58,240
Ice baths have been going on for decades

308
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,839
and people with chronic illness their

309
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,320
thyroid disorder order isn't healed so

310
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,320
you mean they do an ice bath and their

311
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,880
thyroid disorder goes away their

312
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,680
hashimotos thy thyroiditis goes away

313
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,240
their ra that they're suffering with and

314
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,440
they're on drugs for goes away when they

315
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,880
hop in an ice bath um their Lyme disease

316
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,839
goes away cuz I'm trying to figure this

317
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:17,920
out no disrespect seriously so when

318
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,920
someone's got lime disease and they've

319
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,440
they're pounding the antibiotics and

320
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,160
they're going to their 10th lime doctor

321
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,079
you mean an ice bath fixes it they're

322
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,680
all done boom you know and so what

323
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,720
you're hearing from people like that

324
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,880
you're hearing people who aren't sick

325
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,360
they haven't been sick sick they're

326
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,839
called not so sick very little things

327
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,560
going on with them maybe they got a

328
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,639
sinus infection they get periodically

329
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:42,160
maybe they don't feel good in other ways

330
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:44,199
but it's the they're The Not So Sick and

331
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,440
some of them with with a strong

332
00:12:44,199 --> 00:12:47,360
Constitution because they've never

333
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,240
gotten sick yet hasn't broken down their

334
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,920
constitution they can hop into an ice

335
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,399
bath and they can get quick relief for

336
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,600
the moment but they get quick relief for

337
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:56,120
the moment cuz they're high on

338
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,560
adrenaline and that's what's happening

339
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:00,680
so here's what's going on when you're

340
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,399
not that sick of a person or not sick at

341
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:05,959
all and you want to do the ice bath okay

342
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:07,240
you're going to be on an adrenaline High

343
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:09,600
because your body is going to be

344
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,079
coursing coursing through adrenaline

345
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:15,000
when a plane

346
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:17,480
crashes in the Alps all right and

347
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,800
everybody's on that plane and the snow

348
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:23,320
is just coming down and they're their

349
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,160
way up in the mountains and the snow is

350
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:28,959
blowing and the wind is blowing and

351
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:31,639
they're in that plane and that plane is

352
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,720
crashed but they're still alive and

353
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:36,240
there's no heaters and they're not

354
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:39,720
dressed warm enough and they can't start

355
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,800
a fire and they start getting cold

356
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:44,639
that's fight ORF flight the body goes

357
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:46,600
into that crazy land of coldness right

358
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,880
adrenaline starts coursing through them

359
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:51,279
to keep them alive well when you hop

360
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,519
into an ice tub a tub filled with ice

361
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:55,680
and you hop right in your body thinks

362
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,560
it's the same thing it thinks that

363
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:01,160
something's wrong you've been left out

364
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:04,199
in the cold and you're in trouble and so

365
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:07,120
the body then supersedes and tries to

366
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:09,600
supersede by by launching and releasing

367
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,160
a tremendous amount of adrenaline that

368
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,360
adrenaline is to try to keep your

369
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:15,639
heartbeat going to try to keep you

370
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,920
moving it's the fight or flight

371
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:19,920
adrenaline so when you hop in the icy

372
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,720
cold bathtub and you submerge yourself

373
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:25,120
in you're like your adrenals are just

374
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,519
like flooding when you come out of there

375
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,600
you're high you like oh my God I can't

376
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:32,240
believe woo I can't believe I came out

377
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,480
of that oh my God that was an

378
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,800
experience oh my God I feel it I feel

379
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,399
really good I came out of the ice bath

380
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,120
oh my God right that's the adrenaline

381
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:42,560
surge that's what that is and when

382
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,920
you're not so sick and you don't have

383
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,560
chronic illness and you don't have Lyme

384
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,000
disease and every other condition out

385
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,160
there and you don't have Epstein bar

386
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,800
related conditions and cause conditions

387
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,160
you don't have all these other problems

388
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,720
and you come out of that ice bath you

389
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,320
like I'll do that again you know I'll

390
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,040
get working out next week or the other

391
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,320
day I'll do another ice bath it's

392
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,240
feeling good

393
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:04,399
The Not So Sick will swear by it you

394
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:08,079
stick somebody sick in those ice baths

395
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:10,079
and they're screwed they are screwed

396
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:13,160
it's going to tank them over time it's

397
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:14,800
going to waste what what adrenal like

398
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:17,240
adrenal strength they have left it's

399
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:20,519
going to waste it it's going to throw

400
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:23,120
away whatever adrenaline they have left

401
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:25,720
in reserves adrenal reserves right is

402
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,880
going to throw that away and over time

403
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:30,560
you're chronically sick that is going to

404
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:32,560
break you down knock you down and your

405
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:35,040
immune system is going to lower and

406
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,199
weaken because of it so your white blood

407
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,279
cells are going to start falling apart

408
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,480
because of it that's what's going to

409
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:43,880
happen they're going to explode and open

410
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,880
up so keep that in

411
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:49,279
mind Christen Burton says are cold packs

412
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,279
bad for adrenals no they aren't and I'll

413
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:53,560
talk about ways of using them they're

414
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:57,480
not because they're not putting your

415
00:15:53,560 --> 00:16:00,120
body into hypothermic state if you're

416
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:04,120
being careful you're localizing with

417
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:07,279
cold packs you're not doing the ice bath

418
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:09,279
dip and you got to be careful there's a

419
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:11,079
huge difference between someone who is

420
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:13,079
struggling and sick with chronic

421
00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:15,319
sickness and illness versus someone

422
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:17,519
who's not so sick or not sick at all you

423
00:16:15,319 --> 00:16:19,759
see someone on social saying I'm doing

424
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:22,160
the ice bath again wow it's making me

425
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:24,560
feel good and you're somebody that's

426
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,360
sick and you've had fibro chronic

427
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,720
fatigue Lyme disease multiple sclerosis

428
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,480
you don't know what you got going going

429
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,560
on maybe you don't have any diagnosis

430
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,959
you're just fatigued really bad you got

431
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,839
aches and pains everywhere you don't

432
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:38,040
feel good you got brain fog that's

433
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:40,519
totally messing you up and making you

434
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:42,399
take a whole bunch of Aderall like crazy

435
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:43,800
because you got so much brain fog you're

436
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,319
trying to survive you're trying to get

437
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,959
back by you're on coffee you're on

438
00:16:46,319 --> 00:16:49,920
chocolate you're trying to just keep

439
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:52,800
yourself going and push through the day

440
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:56,040
you go into the ice baths and do them

441
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:58,519
regularly it's a shock to the body

442
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:01,560
systems all of them because your body

443
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:04,439
says fight or flight Red Alert fight or

444
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:06,760
flight something's wrong something's

445
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:09,600
going wrong because your brain is

446
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:12,199
starting to get cold your whole body is

447
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,760
starting to get cold the adrenals are

448
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:15,679
just like fight our flight we're in

449
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,319
trouble oh my God your adrenals are just

450
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:21,400
going nuts like that's what they're

451
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:23,720
doing because they're saying don't go

452
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:26,559
into hypothermia something's wrong are

453
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,760
you in a plane did you crash in the Alps

454
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:30,200
what's going on is there a wind blowing

455
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:32,880
and you don't have a fire keeping you

456
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:35,200
warm you're not indoors you're not by a

457
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,880
fireplace you're where are you trapped

458
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,039
in Z degree weather out somewhere and

459
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:43,320
that's what your adrenals are telling

460
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:45,799
your brain your adrenals are telling

461
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:48,360
your brain your brain is communicating

462
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:50,440
with your adrenals saying I don't know

463
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:52,280
what this fool is doing your brain is

464
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:54,240
saying I don't know what this person's

465
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,080
doing I don't know what this person

466
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,080
who's got misinformation wrong

467
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,400
information is doing but I'm starting to

468
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,840
get cold in here and I need some

469
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:05,720
adrenaline fast and you better send that

470
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:07,280
stuff up and pile that stuff in because

471
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:10,039
guess what if we stay in this tub a

472
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:12,600
little too long that person's in trouble

473
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:14,480
you come out and you have a high now

474
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,600
you're jacked up instead of on chocolate

475
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,240
and coffee and caffeine and espressos

476
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:21,000
and green tea and matcha tea and energy

477
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,919
drinks instead of that you're jacked up

478
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,440
on

479
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:27,480
adrenaline that's how it

480
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:28,880
works big difference between not so sick

481
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:31,760
and chronically sick

482
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,000
big difference don't forget that one

483
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,400
very important critical I talk about it

484
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,400
in the books you should have the medical

485
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:41,080
medium books learn about the difference

486
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:44,440
between the not so sick and the sick

487
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:46,240
okay the rules change but what happens

488
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,559
is that not so sick they don't know what

489
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,320
it's like to be really sick they have no

490
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:53,679
idea so they'll tell you to jump into an

491
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:56,200
ice bath that's how it

492
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:58,440
works all right let's get into cold

493
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:01,880
packs right here woohoo these are are

494
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:04,760
getting nice and cold right now okay

495
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:07,600
different size cold packs I like this

496
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:09,640
size but you may have look at it Frosty

497
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:13,880
Frosty cold I like this size you may

498
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:16,039
like smaller sizes okay here's how it

499
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:20,679
works when you

500
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:22,280
localize cold to an area in the body

501
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:26,720
healing

502
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:30,360
stimulates the healing process kicks in

503
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:33,440
inflammation starts to go down if you

504
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:36,240
have somebody and you have knee problems

505
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:39,360
or a shoulder problem and it's

506
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:42,159
inflamed and you do say the ice bath

507
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,840
where it's whole body cold it's not

508
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:46,760
localized anymore so your body is not

509
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:49,520
going to look for the

510
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:51,240
problem critical piece of information

511
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:54,799
right there so let's go to it a little

512
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:56,520
bit my shoulders killing me right here

513
00:19:54,799 --> 00:20:00,919
it's really hurting

514
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:03,200
bad I got a badge shoulder you know

515
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:06,000
something's really hurting in there been

516
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:08,840
to a lot of doctors he's saying maybe I

517
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,640
got tennis shoulder

518
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:15,280
whatever right what do I do right here

519
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,280
well let me do an ice pack and localize

520
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:20,760
it on the shoulder or around the

521
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:23,440
shoulder when you do that your immune

522
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:27,320
system does something

523
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:29,520
interesting it senses the cold in a

524
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:32,799
certain area of the body

525
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:37,120
it senses it it heads to that

526
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:40,760
area interesting it seeks it out it

527
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:44,240
seeks out the area you're identifying

528
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:46,320
your injury or your spasm or your

529
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,880
chronic mystery inflammation you're

530
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:54,200
identifying it you're helping your body

531
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:55,159
even locate it isn't that crazy and

532
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,840
that's what's

533
00:20:55,159 --> 00:20:59,320
amazing when you do full body cold from

534
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,120
head to down to your toe there ain't no

535
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:03,320
finding nothing there ain't no

536
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:06,440
localizing there's no looking for

537
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:08,679
anything it's chaos adrenaline flooding

538
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:11,000
your bloodstream trying to stop you from

539
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:14,200
going to hypothermic your immune system

540
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,960
is lowering because it's dying off from

541
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,840
the adrenaline surge keep that in mind

542
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:22,559
adrenaline is

543
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:24,880
purging immune cells are dying that's

544
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:29,039
how it works adrenaline is surging

545
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:32,039
immune cells are dying when you localize

546
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:33,480
right cold pack on the shoulder say cuz

547
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:37,480
you got a shoulder

548
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:41,039
injury immune system is not

549
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:43,840
dying you have localized the area your

550
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:45,640
body isn't under a threat it's not under

551
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:48,400
a fight or flight

552
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:51,240
threat this means your brain is not

553
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:54,240
sending messages to your adrenals saying

554
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:57,240
save me I'm getting too cold too fast

555
00:21:54,240 --> 00:22:01,039
something is wrong help help help send

556
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:03,799
adrenaline out out that's not happening

557
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:05,960
as you're getting your therapy your cold

558
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:09,600
therapy on your shoulder

559
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:11,159
area inflammation will drop

560
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,360
quickly

561
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:18,640
inflammation will reduce your body will

562
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:21,039
respond the cold will really help with

563
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,159
the area that you're localizing it to

564
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:25,240
and your immune system will find its way

565
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:28,919
to that area

566
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:32,640
after you remove the cold pack as

567
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:34,600

568
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,240

immune

571
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:47,440
system goes rapidly to the area that the

572
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:50,520
cold pack was on your immune cells run

573
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:54,600

00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,039
day and you really don't need it

644
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:58,000

just calm nerves down you want to keep

650
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:15,039
warm you want to make sure you have a

651
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:18,240
blanket and if you have to use cold

652
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:21,320
packs for even a bigger length of time

653
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,640
you may even want a heating pad involved

654
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:26,600
so right here I got a heating

655
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:28,240
pad okay here's

656
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,080
one

657
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,880
so I'm going to go into some different

658
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:35,640
tips and some different things and ways

659
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,559
to use heating pads that are important

660
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:40,880
so if you're doing cold packs on you you

661
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:43,159
can always lay a heating pad over

662
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,960
you you don't have to be laying on the

663
00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:49,520
heating pad you can even have your

664
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:53,559
heating pad over the blanket that's over

665
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:56,559
you just keeping warm down into you as

666
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:59,760
you're using ice packs what this does is

667
00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:03,120
it ensures that your body is

668
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:06,559
warm while the area that you're trying

669
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:10,159
to ice is cool and

670
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:11,960
cold okay and why is that important once

671
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:14,640
again you're

672
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:17,559
localizing if you're warm everywhere

673
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:20,760
else in your body and the cold is in an

674
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:22,399
area you're trying to really Precision

675
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:26,480
wise

676
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:28,679
get like on a Precision level then more

677
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,720
healing occurs

678
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:34,559
it's different if you're

679
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:38,240
freezing totally freezing you got the

680
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:41,320
shakes your jaws like quivering you're

681
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:43,679
cold and you have the ice pack on you

682
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:45,000
that doesn't help as much cuz now your

683
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:47,600
body is just

684
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,640
cold and now your body is going into a

685
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,320
different situation you want to keep

686
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:53,000
your body warm you want to be

687
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,840
comfortable and then you want to take

688
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,519
the cold pack and use it in the

689
00:27:54,840 --> 00:28:00,039
locations you need to use it in

690
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:01,919
got a comment right here does it work

691
00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:03,840
for nerve pain let's head into there

692
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:06,679
yeah it does work for nerve pain for a

693
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:09,320
lot of people it can put the heating pad

694
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:09,320
over here for a

695
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:13,679
second well I do want before I answer

696
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,760
that I do want to actually talk about

697
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:19,120
one

698
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:21,159
thing I never put heating pads High I

699
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:24,440
never click the button and put them

700
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:27,960
really really high something to know

701
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:31,159
it's an important tip keep in mind

702
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:32,720
I never fall asleep on heating pads you

703
00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:35,519
never want to fall asleep on a heating

704
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:39,519
pad that's jacked up really

705
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:41,880
high I like heating pads being down

706
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:43,720
low I've talked to a lot of people over

707
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:46,000
the years a lot of doctors and

708
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:48,720
practitioners giving advice to doctors

709
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,360
and practitioners and healers when it

710
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,080
comes down to heating pads and one of

711
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,640
the pieces of advice one of the

712
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:58,159
important factors is you don't ever need

713
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:01,519
to have it so high you don't want to

714
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:03,799
cook or bake yourself you don't want it

715
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:06,480
cranking in an area too

716
00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:10,240
long you don't want to do that you want

717
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,919
to keep it low you can drape it over you

718
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:15,480
you can drape it over you under a

719
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:18,320
blanket on low you can drape it on top

720
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:20,480
of the blanket un low the goal is to

721
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:23,360
send some warmth

722
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:26,480
in while you're actually using any kind

723
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:28,159
of cold or ice pack unless you're in a

724
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:31,559
situation where you feel comfortable you

725
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:32,919
feel warm and you don't need to right

726
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:35,000
now if you want to go a little higher on

727
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:37,080
your heating pad you can't many people

728
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,240
do that and that's what they like they

729
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:41,159
put it up a little bit higher and they

730
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:43,519
get a little bit of warmth and heat into

731
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:47,399
the area like a strained muscle or some

732
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:50,120
body aches and pains and the heat feels

733
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:52,440
good so people may do that but I'm just

734
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:53,760
giving some tips on heating pads now if

735
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,159
you're somebody that just won't go near

736
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:58,200
a heating pad you don't like heating

737
00:29:55,159 --> 00:30:00,679
pads you don't like the electricity

738
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:04,279
factor I find that the electricity

739
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:08,120
Factor does not affect people it does

740
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:10,279
more good than bad for people when they

741
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:12,480
need that warmth it actually does more

742
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:14,399
good when you're chronically sick than

743
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,080
bad because I know people like heating

744
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:17,559
pads what's he talk what is he talking

745
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,760
about now you can use different hot

746
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:21,360
packs that you might like I'm not saying

747
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,440
you can't look for the hot packs you

748
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,799
want or anything of the sort so let's go

749
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:28,720
into the next thing right

750
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:32,480
here what's this

751
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:34,840
hot water bottle right here so somebody

752
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:38,360
who doesn't like heating pads can find

753
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:40,320
warmth with the hot water bottle so

754
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,760
that's an option all on its own now I'm

755
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,440
going to fill this hot water bottle

756
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,200
right here with my sink I want to give

757
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,559
you some different tips on

758
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:52,399
that one

759
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:56,000
is I don't like filling a tea kettle

760
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:58,080
with boiling scolding hot water and then

761
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,679
filling my hot water water bottle with

762
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,679
that this is something I don't like to

763
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:11,440
do okay got your tea kettle filled it's

764
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:13,559
scolding scolding hot water and you're

765
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,840
pouring it into your hot water bottle

766
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:16,080
reason why I don't like that is there's

767
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,480
a good chance you're going to burn

768
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:20,559
yourself and you're going to get thir

769
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:24,200
Dee burns on your hands your thumb your

770
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:26,840
fingers and even your arm okay so if

771
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:29,600
you're going to heat up your water to

772
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:32,519
put in inside the water bottle don't let

773
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:34,840
it get to that crazy hot temperature

774
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:37,960
where it's boiling and bubbling over and

775
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:40,600
it's at that crazy scolding level don't

776
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:43,240
let it get to that you can do it where

777
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:45,840
it's just you know it's hot like hot

778
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:48,919
where if you did it did hit you it's not

779
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:50,840
going to be a tragic burn it might be

780
00:31:48,919 --> 00:31:53,559
you know hot too hot to touch but you

781
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:55,760
know what I mean that is what I would

782
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:59,480
recommend now what I like to do is take

783
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:01,039
sink water and put sink water that's hot

784
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,760
into my hot water bottle so I'm going to

785
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:05,600
do that now some of you guys might not

786
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:07,399
be able to see me over there on IG and

00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,640
neurological symptoms and so forth a lot

856
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:05,800
of people have chest

857
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:08,520
pain a lot of people have abdomen

858
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:11,560
pain people don't know why maybe they do

859
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:14,400
know why but either way any kind of

860
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:18,839
nerve related pain throughout the body a

861
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:21,520
little bit of cold on it can do wonders

862
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:22,960
calms things down now you might be

863
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,280
really sensitive and you're sensitive

864
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,040
with your nerves you got a lot of

865
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:28,400
neurological symptoms and put in hold

866
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:32,160
this too

867
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:35,640
much that's why you can do

868
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:38,400
this okay just see is a

869
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:40,960
towel I'm going to open this hollow

870
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,240
up going to do a magic trick for you

871
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,240
right

872
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:47,000
now no I'm

873
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:50,560
not

874
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:54,280
and I have a cold pack right here in

875
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:57,880
this towel now what I recommend is not

876
00:35:54,280 --> 00:36:00,359
going from cold pack out of the freezer

877
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,359
to

878
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:07,160
skin I do not recommend going from cold

879
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:10,440
pack to

880
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:14,520
skin no no no no no

881
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:17,200
no not a good idea way too cold it's

882
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:19,640
going to hit the skin really

883
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:23,200
cold you might feel even like a little

884
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:24,960
freezer burn touch not good so when you

885
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:28,319
pull your cold packs out of the

886
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:30,680
freezer I like to put put them in a

887
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:32,480
towel now you can do a thinner towel you

888
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:35,319
can do a thicker

889
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:37,839
towel maybe you're somebody that does

890
00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:39,800
the thinner one but I like one that's

891
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:42,480
got a little meat to it it's a little

892
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:45,560
thick you can even go thicker than this

893
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:47,960
and then if you got the Vegas nerve

894
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:49,440
issues the frenic nerve issues if you

895
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,920
got all the different nerve pain

896
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,040
throughout your body your neck your

897
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:56,160
trigeminal nerve that's another thing

898
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:59,319
right here okay a lot of people have

899
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:03,000
that jaw pain they have that pain on the

900
00:36:59,319 --> 00:37:03,000
side of their face their teeth

901
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:08,240
hurt what maybe it's a maybe it's a

902
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,839
Dentistry issue maybe it's actually a

903
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:12,400
problem with the tooth maybe it's an

904
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:16,000
abscess can put a cold pack on an

905
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:18,200
abscess not inside your mouth but you

906
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,440
can take the cold pack and you can put

907
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:24,640
it on the side of your

908
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:26,119
jaw that's a great place for relief for

909
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,560
so many people that have trigeminal

910
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:29,079
neuralgia

911
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:32,280
they have different pain in their neck

912
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:33,960
and face Facial Pain facial nerves

913
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,599
actually calm down when you put a little

914
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,839
cold to them now here's the thing you

915
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:38,280
want to be careful if you're somebody

916
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:40,319
who's chronically sick and you got a lot

917
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:44,960
of different pain throughout the body

918
00:37:40,319 --> 00:37:48,440
I'm talking about just lightly touching

919
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:51,319
and not for a long time nice towel on it

920
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:52,920
and it's just getting some cold in here

921
00:37:51,319 --> 00:37:55,040
you don't have to be on there for more

922
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:57,400
than sometimes 30

923
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:59,400
seconds 30 seconds

924
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:01,760
seconds so you're dealing with some kind

925
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:03,839
of trigeminal neuralgia jaw pain nerve

926
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,400
pain maybe you're somebody that just

927
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:09,480
grinds your

928
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:11,119
teethed real like stiff jaw maybe you're

929
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:13,040
somebody that has different pain in

930
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:15,599
different areas of the neck I'm just

931
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:18,240
talking about a little bit even if it's

932
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:21,480
30 seconds so when you're chronically

933
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:24,839
sick and you do 30 seconds of this it

934
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:26,720
can actually assist in healing and help

935
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:29,160
to drive down some of that mystery

936
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:30,960
chronic

937
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:34,000
inflammation same thing with headaches

938
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:36,040
and migraines just touching the forehead

939
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,359
with a cold pack with the towel on it

940
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,119
you don't want to sit there with a

941
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:40,599
freezer pack right out of the freezer

942
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,880
and you just shove it on your head and

943
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:44,960
you're like okay I'm going to leave this

944
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:46,880
on here don't don't do that but you can

945
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,280
just do little bits at a time in areas

946
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,119
that are hypers sensitive like the

947
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:52,599
cranial nerve areas so I want to get my

948
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:57,560
little thing

949
00:38:52,599 --> 00:39:00,240
here okay so cranial nerves

950
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:02,760
do a little demo so many people have

951
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:05,119
cranial nerve issues all the different

952
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:08,280
nerves coming out of their brain stem

953
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:11,280
are inflamed so they're having facial

954
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:14,400
problems they're having teeth problems

955
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:17,560
and jaw problems and a little bit of

956
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:21,000
coldness to it can be wonderful just in

957
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:22,560
those areas the back of the head cranial

958
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,000
nerves in the back of the head cranial

959
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:29,000
nerves on the face with a towel over it

960
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I'm just you Gentle quick ways you can

961
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:34,720
do this someone said there gerbon said

962
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,760
for me the ice baths made me sicker and

963
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:40,560
sicker glad mm told me the truth about

964
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:42,720
this so I finally started healing I've

965
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,240
seen this before in the past when

966
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,200
someone's sick and they're chronically

967
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:50,040
sick chronically

968
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:54,640
ill the ice baths aren't the answer and

969
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:58,800
either is a sweat tent that's not the

970
00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:01,520
answer either either is hot yoga that's

971
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:04,319
not the answer extreme

972
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:07,040
temperatures that engulf the

973
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:09,960
body is something you want to stay away

974
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:12,280
from when you're chronically sick

975
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:14,599
chronically ill or you're just out of

976
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:16,200
the category of just being little bit

977
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:19,400
sick or something like

978
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:22,920
that the hot and cold

979
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:25,760
packs assist healing while you work on

980
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:27,400
the medical medium tools and you work on

981
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:30,040
the medical medium information so you

982
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:31,440
know what's wrong you know how to heal

983
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:35,280
and you have all those other tools but

984
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:37,560
this is a great way it's like a gateway

985
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:41,040
to healing for so many people right

986
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:43,440
there on IG how does this compare to

987
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,560
infrared sauna I like infrared SAA but

988
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,599
if you're chronically sick you don't

989
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:48,800
want to sit in there with the

990
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:52,319
temperature jacked up really

991
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:53,760
high you don't want to do that I give

992
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:55,000
direction about things like this in the

993
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,440
medical medium

994
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,440
books Medical medium new addition check

995
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:02,440
it

996
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:05,079
out you don't want to be in

997
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:08,680
there and just doing that way now I like

998
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:11,000
infrared saas but remember it doesn't

999
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:12,440
isolate so it's not like you want to use

1000
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,280
it where you sit in there you bake

1001
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:15,839
yourself all the time you got it really

1002
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:18,240
high when someone's chronically sick

1003
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:18,240
that's too

1004
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:22,319
much and the same thing with a cold

1005
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:24,560
shower I want to talk about like a cold

1006
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:25,880
shower some people would say well take a

1007
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,560
really cold shower that's going to help

1008
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:29,560
me you can take a cold shower but

1009
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:33,160
remember it's not isolating or it's not

1010
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:36,040
localizing the area it's full body when

1011
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:37,920
you do infrared sauna it's full body I

1012
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:39,720
don't mind cool showers for some people

1013
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:42,480
that's different than an ice ice bath if

1014
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:44,359
someone wants to turn it cold and just

1015
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:47,480
get a rush of cold water right out of

1016
00:41:44,359 --> 00:41:49,240
the tab and then shake it off I'm not

1017
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:51,720
against that at all that's hydrotherapy

1018
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:53,520
I'm not against

1019
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:55,480
hydrotherapy someone wants to get into

1020
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:58,240
an infrared sauna and they want to warm

1021
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:59,520
up and they have that temp on just right

1022
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:02,079
for their needs and they're not in it

1023
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:03,520
for 45 minutes an hour or 2 hours you

1024
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:04,760
can get in there for 5 minutes 10

1025
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,960
minutes because if you're chronically

1026
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:09,240
sick that may be all you need to do you

1027
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:11,079
don't want to push yourself you want to

1028
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:12,359
keep it very low for 20 minutes no more

1029
00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:16,040
than 20

1030
00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:18,280
minutes but you want to also brace

1031
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:20,599
yourself be cautious and mindful that

1032
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:23,319
you're not baking yourself like a

1033
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:25,280
cupcake in the oven for like an hour

1034
00:42:23,319 --> 00:42:26,839
with a really high heat when you're

1035
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:29,640
chronically sick and so forth and

1036
00:42:26,839 --> 00:42:29,640
honestly for just

1037
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:34,520
anyone so cranial nerves get inflamed

1038
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,440
and it gives everybody with cranial

1039
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:38,400
nerve inflammation issues lots of

1040
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:40,240
different symptoms ticks and spasms

1041
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,760
aches and pains all kinds of different

1042
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:45,000
problems why are the nerves inflamed

1043
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:47,000
viruses toxic heavy metals it's medical

1044
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:50,200
medum inflamation talked about that for

1045
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,079
years and years so all the different

1046
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:54,839
viruses and bugs along with toxic heavy

1047
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:56,160
metals inflame the brain stem people get

1048
00:42:54,839 --> 00:42:57,760
all the different problems every

1049
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,359
everywhere they get the Vegas nerve

1050
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,920
problems going through their body they

1051
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:02,640
have all this different like they feel

1052
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:05,319
like they're vibrating they feel like

1053
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,839
their frequency is off they feel tired

1054
00:43:05,319 --> 00:43:08,720
when they're not supposed to be tired

1055
00:43:06,839 --> 00:43:10,559
that's the neurological fatigue and they

1056
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:12,599
have all the ticks and spasms and

1057
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:14,559
twitches and then with that they might

1058
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:16,319
even get some OCD and some other things

1059
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:18,319
involved which are all neurological they

1060
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:20,280
might get some blurry vision for no

1061
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:23,000
reason whatsoever which is the optic

1062
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:24,200
neuritis or optic nerve inflammation and

1063
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,400
all of this

1064
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:28,280
combined I talk about in all the books

1065
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:30,480
so people have answers I'm just bringing

1066
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:32,599
in though something that's really

1067
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:35,720
powerful which is hot cold packs

1068
00:43:32,599 --> 00:43:38,119
different tips about

1069
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:41,000
it and there we are all right you guys

going to make some crinkle fries and I'm

1073
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:50,440
going get rid of this hot water bottle

1074
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:53,000
right here feels so good feels like a

1075
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:55,079

right so what you want to do is I have

1080
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:05,839
steamed potatoes here now you can make

1081
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:07,359
crinkle fries with potatoes that are raw

1082
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:11,160
put them in the oven you can do it that

1083
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:14,520
way I have them steamed right here so

1084
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:16,760
I'm making my crinkle fries steamed so

1085
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:19,240
I'm going to make a whole bunch of them

1086
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:22,240
so let's see got a little window into

1087
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:24,760
what we're doing here so let's start

1088
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:28,000
here now these might crumble a little

1089
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:28,000
bit these potatoes

1090
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:32,160
you can make them as thick as you want

1091
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:34,599
you can make them as thin as you want

1092
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:36,880
it's up to

1093
00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:39,760
you some potatoes

1094
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:42,040
might work a little better this one was

1095
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:45,200
really flaky and dry but we might get

1096
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:47,880
some nice fries out of that one there

1097
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:49,319
there we go you guys see that I'm going

1098
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:51,319
to move these over I'm going to make a

1099
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:55,200
whole

1100
00:44:51,319 --> 00:44:56,960
bunch of fries here those are some nice

1101
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:59,200
fries here's a another thing to know

1102
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:01,920
which is really fun if your

1103
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:03,559
fries come from a large potato you get

1104
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,800
these large crinkle fries which are so

1105
00:45:03,559 --> 00:45:10,359
great if it comes from a small potato

1106
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:12,559
like this you get small crinkle fries

1107
00:45:10,359 --> 00:45:14,839
how do you like that then I'm going to

1108
00:45:12,559 --> 00:45:16,559
do this maybe try to get one more out of

1109
00:45:14,839 --> 00:45:19,599
this we'll

1110
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:22,040
see yep some of them are going to break

1111
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:24,599
apart some of them will be just fine but

1112
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:26,400
that's all right let's just do it here

1113
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:28,400
we go

1114
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:30,760
now I want them a little thick I want

1115
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,760
some

1116
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:35,720
thickness here we

1117
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:42,079
are if you make them too small too

1118
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:44,680
skinny there we go you might run into

1119
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:48,760
problems now remember these are steamed

1120
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:48,760
already these aren't the raw

1121
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:54,000
potato I chose to steam them to make it

1122
00:45:51,319 --> 00:45:57,880
nice just so we can actually bake them

1123
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,880
and make them nice and crunchy

1124
00:45:58,119 --> 00:46:02,440
I also chose to steam them so they don't

1125
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:05,079
have as much cooking time in the oven

1126
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:07,599
that's a big deal and I also like the

1127
00:46:05,079 --> 00:46:10,200
inside of the potato

1128
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:13,280
soft I like the inside of the potato

1129
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:16,200
soft so here we go let's get some good

1130
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:19,680
ones here this a very large

1131
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:21,559
potato and the inside has like a little

1132
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:24,160
bit of space in there so these might

1133
00:46:21,559 --> 00:46:27,800
fall apart a little

1134
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:27,800
bit there we go

1135
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,520
there we

1136
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:35,240
go they're coming out good I might have

1137
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:38,960
more than my pan can hold but we are

1138
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:38,960
doing it let's go there's another

1139
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:48,160
one there a lot of information when it

1140
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:48,160
comes down to hot and cold

1141
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:55,440
packs information people don't realize

1142
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:57,160
you can really get cold with a cold pack

1143
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:00,839
where your whole body just gets really

1144
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:00,839
cold and you want to keep yourself

1145
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:07,880
warm another thing too if you're

1146
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:10,319
somebody that has back problems hip

1147
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:13,480
problems and you know you pushed it too

1148
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:15,119
far you had a big day like say you

1149
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:17,359
exercised and worked out a little bit

1150
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:19,800
more than normal say you took a walk

1151
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:21,559
that's longer than normal say something

1152
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:23,280
else happened where you were you know

1153
00:47:21,559 --> 00:47:25,160
doing something and loading some garbage

1154
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:27,280
out of the house say you were lifting

1155
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:29,520
things bending down more than normal and

1156
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,920
you're in your recovery and you know

1157
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:32,599
you're not quite there yet but you're

1158
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:35,760
getting better you might want to get

1159
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:38,440
that cold pack on

1160
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:40,880
there and you can C you can totally

1161
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:44,280
Stave off an

1162
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:47,040
issue you can actually save off an issue

1163
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:50,760
from becoming something give yourself a

1164
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:53,280
break the next day get that cold pack on

1165
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:55,359
and you can save off an actual problem

1166
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:58,319
that would have developed that's what I

1167
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:58,319
like about about cold

1168
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:06,599
packs okay this one's a little crumbly

1169
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:09,040
and a little weird might not use much

1170
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:11,359
out of that one and you could still eat

1171
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:15,880
it it's all great all right let's get a

1172
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:15,880
pan going let's see what we can

1173
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:24,640
do all right I got a parchment paper

1174
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:25,800
sheet laying it in the pan right here

1175
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:27,160
now I'm going to start taking my my

1176
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:29,680

1177
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:31,240

1178
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:33,319
them in there really

1179
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:35,200
good some are a little bigger than

1180
00:48:33,319 --> 00:48:37,400
others I just like that you don't want

1181
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:39,440
them all exactly the same size it's no

1182
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:41,640

1183
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:44,280
you know how you like choose the fry you

dish you're looking for the French fry

1186
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:51,359

food restaurant and they get a box of

1188
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:56,799
fries they start eating certain ones

1189
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:58,599
they'll grab the little ones right

1190
00:48:56,799 --> 00:48:59,680
or they'll go for just the big ones and

1191
00:48:58,599 --> 00:49:02,760
they'll wait for all those little ones

1192
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,760

1193
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:07,760

1270
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:46,200
AA no actually no we're going to go with

1271
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:48,520
some oregano let's find that oregano

1272
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:51,079
let's do garlic powder I have to find

1273
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:55,240
the oregano

1274
00:52:51,079 --> 00:52:56,720
powder my bad I think I forgot that one

1275
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:58,680
let's get some garlic powder on here you

1276
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:01,559
don't have to do so much garlic powder

1277
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:04,760
you don't want that exactly like so

1278
00:53:01,559 --> 00:53:05,640
crazy all right now I'm going to season

1279
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:08,319
both

1280
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:11,520
sides I'll probably do that by just

1281
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:11,520
moving these around a little

1282
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:15,720
bit I could take it out of the oven flip

1283
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:17,480
them around then too but I'm going to

1284
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:19,400
move some of these

1285
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:24,119
around here we

1286
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:24,119
go going to flip them over

1287
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:28,280
nice

1288
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:32,960
let's get both sides of many of these as

1289
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:32,960
many as we can there we go

1290
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:39,920
nice when you steam the potatoes and you

1291
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:41,280
throw them in a bowl see I have to

1292
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:43,200
season them on the plate right here

1293
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:44,400
because they're steamed potatoes cuz

1294
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:46,200
what happens is if you just throw them

1295
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:48,160
in a big old bowl and you toss it around

1296
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:50,200
with all the with all the seasonings

1297
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:53,520
you're just going to bust them

1298
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:56,240
up but when you cook them raw you just

1299
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:57,640
don't end up into that kind of situation

1300
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:58,520
so that's why I'm just playing with it

1301
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:03,040
right here I'm going to do some more

1302
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:03,040
onion powder on the other side

1303
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:08,480
nice I think I'm going to sneeze I'm

1304
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:08,480
going to

1305
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:15,680
sneeze hold on I'm trying to hold in the

1306
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:15,680
sneeze

1307
00:54:17,799 --> 00:54:24,440
on just kidding I'm kidding kidding let

1308
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:27,079
me just get some oregano um it's nice we

1309
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:27,079
have oregano

1310
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:37,920
all

1311
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:40,160
right little bit of oregano in here too

1312
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,160
you

1313
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:46,480
guys now I have fresh oregano in the

1314
00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:48,880
garden you can go as far as

1315
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:52,040
that little bit of oregano on there it's

1316
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:57,079
hard to come out all

1317
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:57,079
right putting them in the oven

1318
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:00,240
going to pop them in here I got the oven

1319
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:02,359
at

1320
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:04,599
400 let's get them

1321
00:55:02,359 --> 00:55:07,559
in

1322
00:55:04,599 --> 00:55:09,960
boom looking pretty

1323
00:55:07,559 --> 00:55:11,760
good crinkle fries are in the oven so

1324
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:13,720
let's start making some of the fixings

1325
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:16,200
let's go I'm going to chop up some

1326
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:17,040
Tomatoes that's going to go into this

1327
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:21,720
all

1328
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:21,720
right clear out the deck let's go

1329
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,839
here now now when it comes down heat

1330
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:29,559
packs and stuff like that I want to go

1331
00:55:26,839 --> 00:55:31,359
into that a little bit um and talk about

1332
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:33,559
the timing and and the order and

1333
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:35,480
everything about hot packs cold packs

1334
00:55:33,559 --> 00:55:37,200
how to use them so we're going to go

1335
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:39,280
head into there as well so let's do that

1336
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:41,039
before we start chopping some stuff up

1337
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:44,160
okay so let's get the hot and cold packs

1338
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:46,119
out again you might have a different hot

1339
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:48,680
pack I'm using a hot water ptle that's

1340
00:55:46,119 --> 00:55:52,599
what I'm using for this I'm also using a

1341
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:54,640
heating pad too also now you can

1342
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:55,960
localize areas with a heating pad if you

1343
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:57,680
really want want just be careful and

1344
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:59,440
don't have it on full blast like I said

1345
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:01,000
earlier you want it on a lower

1346
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:03,680
temperature so if you're going to use a

1347
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,799
heating pad to localize an injury

1348
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:07,720
localize just body pain and aches to

1349
00:56:05,799 --> 00:56:10,920
localize nerve problems whatever you're

1350
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:13,640
dealing with just don't have it on full

1351
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:15,240
blast and don't keep it on too too long

1352
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:17,720
you don't want to cook yourself you

1353
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:19,079
don't want to cook your organs you don't

1354
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:22,000
want to cook yourself you don't want to

1355
00:56:19,079 --> 00:56:23,799
go into that hypothermic place so you

1356
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,520
just want to be careful to I've seen

1357
00:56:23,799 --> 00:56:27,760
people where boom they have heating

1358
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:29,880
blankets they got them on full blast you

1359
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:34,680
know sometimes it's just way too much

1360
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:34,680
all right so let me get a cold pack out

1361
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:42,920
here okay what I like is warmth in the

1362
00:56:41,039 --> 00:56:45,160
morning if you're somebody dealing with

1363
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:47,079
chronic illness on in any way shape or

1364
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:49,839
form where you're having chronic aches

1365
00:56:47,079 --> 00:56:52,200
and pains you feel like you need

1366
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:54,079
something you feel like you need warmth

1367
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:57,160
if you want to therapeutically use it

1368
00:56:54,079 --> 00:57:00,319
the right way it would be heat in the

1369
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:02,319
morning warmth in the morning now that

1370
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:04,319
doesn't mean it's warmth in the morning

1371
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:06,960
and then you have to wait all day long

1372
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:10,280
to do cold at

1373
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:13,039
night it's just that first thing first

1374
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:15,319
like right away warmth in the morning

1375
00:57:13,039 --> 00:57:19,359
very helpful very healing the body

1376
00:57:15,319 --> 00:57:20,599
responds to it differently so that means

1377
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:22,799
if you're dealing with some aches and

1378
00:57:20,599 --> 00:57:25,039
pains you got a sore back you got a sore

1379
00:57:22,799 --> 00:57:26,640
shoulder you're feeling problems all

1380
00:57:25,039 --> 00:57:29,119
over the place your neck and so forth

1381
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:30,200
you bring warmth to it in the morning

1382
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:34,400
that's what you

1383
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:37,240
do okay now TimeWise totally up to you 5

1384
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:39,559
minutes 10 minutes 15 minutes 20 minutes

1385
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:41,559
anything like that an hour so you can

1386
00:57:39,559 --> 00:57:43,960
have a hot water bottle and leave it on

1387
00:57:41,559 --> 00:57:45,640
an area in the morning where you're

1388
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:49,440
leaned up against a couch or you're in

1389
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:51,039
bed with it and it eventually gets cool

1390
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:53,200
because you've had it for an

1391
00:57:51,039 --> 00:57:55,839
hour and so you've been using it for an

1392
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:59,240
hour and that's fine you can do that

1393
00:57:55,839 --> 00:58:01,359
if it's the same spot you want to use

1394
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:04,480
other things therapeutically on like

1395
00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:08,200
cold for instance if it's the same

1396
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:09,880
spot the cold can come after after

1397
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:13,000
you've done warmth and you done warmth

1398
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:14,839
in the area it can come directly after

1399
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:17,960
if you really wanted to or you can give

1400
00:58:14,839 --> 00:58:21,000
it some time you let the warmth in that

1401
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:23,079
area kind of seep in and then over time

1402
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:25,720
whether it's an hour later half an hour

1403
00:58:23,079 --> 00:58:27,520
later 20 minutes later ler 3 hours later

1404
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:29,319
you bring the cold pack into that area

1405
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:31,839
and that's fine too and you can do it

1406
00:58:29,319 --> 00:58:33,160
even right after if you really wanted to

1407
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:34,680
but you want to start with warmth in the

1408
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:38,880
morning when you're dealing with hip

1409
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:40,760
pain back pain leg pain leg spasms

1410
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:44,200
cramps whatever it is that you're

1411
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:46,960
dealing with nerve pain different ticks

1412
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:50,240
and spasms and issues knee

1413
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:55,079
pain am I missing anything arm pain

1414
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:55,960
elbow pain right you do the warmth for

1415
00:58:55,079 --> 00:58:59,599
in the

1416
00:58:55,960 --> 00:59:03,960
morning cold can come later late morning

1417
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:05,640
is fine midday later in the afternoon at

1418
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:07,520
night and so forth now here's the thing

1419
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:10,240
it doesn't mean you can't do warmth

1420
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:12,119
again if you want to go to cold and you

1421
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:16,720
go to cold an hour later and you're

1422
00:59:12,119 --> 00:59:19,200
doing a 20 minute half an hour cold

1423
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:20,799
pack right here in this towel and you're

1424
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:23,280
doing this in your back or any of that

1425
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:27,480
other place places talking about hip leg

1426
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:30,319
knee shoulder you can do that and

1427
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:32,480
then afterwards you can do warmth again

1428
00:59:30,319 --> 00:59:34,400
you can switch off on and off all day

1429
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:36,839
you can go one and the other one and the

1430
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:38,119
other all day long if you'd like but you

1431
00:59:36,839 --> 00:59:40,000
want to start out with the warmth in the

1432
00:59:38,119 --> 00:59:43,079
morning if you

1433
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,760
can and then you bring in the cold layer

1434
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:47,920
now a lot of people get knee swelling

1435
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:50,799
their knees swell up they get ankle

1436
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:52,920
swelling knee swelling and that's what's

1437
00:59:50,799 --> 00:59:55,599
great about the cold packs localizing on

1438
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:57,440
the areas much different than if if you

1439
00:59:55,599 --> 00:59:59,200
cool down the entire body like I was

1440
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:01,440
talking about

1441
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:03,440
earlier much different when you localize

1442
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:05,440
it and you hit those areas so if you're

1443
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:07,559
dealing with some kind of knee

1444
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:10,839
pain and you

1445
01:00:07,559 --> 01:00:12,520
got the cold pack right there on there

1446
01:00:10,839 --> 01:00:13,839

that's how powerful the simple little

1528
01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:34,640
therapeutic option is that's so helpful

1529
01:03:33,319 --> 01:03:38,000
that people who are dealing with I've

1530
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:39,599
seen people in the past totally manic

1531
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,799
they're they have they're actually

1532
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:45,039
engulfed in

1533
01:03:41,799 --> 01:03:48,599
Mania where they're about to just hop in

1534
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:51,520
a car and just drive off a bridge

1535
01:03:48,599 --> 01:03:53,839
somewhere and you put a cold pack on

1536
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:55,359
their neck and what happens is the

1537
01:03:53,839 --> 01:03:58,160
neurons

1538
01:03:55,359 --> 01:04:01,559
start to shift the electricity through

1539
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:04,240
the brain starts to

1540
01:04:01,559 --> 01:04:06,680
shift and literally I've seen people

1541
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:09,079
come out of manic

1542
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:15,359
moments I've seen people that were just

1543
01:04:09,079 --> 01:04:17,520
like so up so up where they were losing

1544
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:19,720
it I've talked to a lot of doctors and

1545
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:21,359
practitioners and heers over the years

1546
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:23,960
and I've had a lot of

1547
01:04:21,359 --> 01:04:25,680
doctors ask me questions about this

1548
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:27,880
about patients that had mental health

1549
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:32,359
issues emotional

1550
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:35,279
struggles and I would say do hot and

1551
01:04:32,359 --> 01:04:38,279
cold have it on hand make sure they have

1552
01:04:35,279 --> 01:04:41,119
it on hand since someone's dealing with

1553
01:04:38,279 --> 01:04:43,720
any kind of like struggle emotionally

1554
01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:46,119
and mentally if you bring in a cold pack

1555
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:47,760
and you just rest it on the abdomen

1556
01:04:46,119 --> 01:04:50,359
something starts to

1557
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:52,920
shift you rest it in the lower back

1558
01:04:50,359 --> 01:04:55,279
something starts to shift you put it on

1559
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:57,359
your thighs a cold back on your thighs

1560
01:04:55,279 --> 01:05:00,520
and something starts to

1561
01:04:57,359 --> 01:05:04,520
shift because what happens

1562
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:06,640
is your neurons start to

1563
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:09,279
reroute electricity that's going to

1564
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:10,599
neurons to neurons start to redirect and

1565
01:05:09,279 --> 01:05:13,279
it heads into different parts of the

1566
01:05:10,599 --> 01:05:17,119
brain that it wasn't heading

1567
01:05:13,279 --> 01:05:19,880
into and so it's shifting that pathway

1568
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:22,520
that electrical grid sending it into

1569
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:26,079
different neurons it's not normally

1570
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:26,079
headed for

1571
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:29,319
and so when we're dealing with things

1572
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:31,240
emotionally emotional struggles we're

1573
01:05:29,319 --> 01:05:34,079
dealing with mental

1574
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:36,119
stress you come home from a really bad

1575
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:38,319
day or you've been home and you got some

1576
01:05:36,119 --> 01:05:40,279
bad news or you've had a struggle and

1577
01:05:38,319 --> 01:05:43,079
you bring out a cold

1578
01:05:40,279 --> 01:05:45,039
pack it can help alleviate and even

1579
01:05:43,079 --> 01:05:47,520
shift that of how you're feeling in that

1580
01:05:45,039 --> 01:05:49,720
moment so things calm down or maybe

1581
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:51,880
you're like a hot head and you get some

1582
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:53,440
bad news and you just want to explode on

1583
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:55,599
someone a friend or something and you

1584
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:57,720
want to hit them with all kinds of texts

1585
01:05:55,599 --> 01:06:01,000
and tell them how they did you wrong if

1586
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:02,880
you stop for a moment and you get a cold

1587
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:05,559
pack out of the

1588
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:08,520
freezer and you start putting a cold

1589
01:06:05,559 --> 01:06:10,160
pack on the top of your head on the side

1590
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:12,039
of your neck for a little bit on your

1591
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:14,960
chest for a little bit watch the

1592
01:06:12,039 --> 01:06:16,319
difference 10 minutes 15 minutes later

1593
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:18,440
you're going to take your phone and

1594
01:06:16,319 --> 01:06:20,200

1595
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:22,599

up inside of you because you've been

actually

1627
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:34,440
avoid and the anger is not like tearing

1628
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:36,920
into you and tearing you apart you can

1629
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:39,440
actually avoid it that cold pack can

1630
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:41,319
shift you into a different direction

1631
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:43,720

betrayed them or something happened and

1649

the cold packs out and they started

1651
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:35,319
putting another body and it shifted him

1652
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:37,400

01:25:21,119 --> 01:25:25,360
lot of people leave comments on there

1988
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:28,280
you know I read

1989
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:30,159
them so that that I mean I want you to

1990
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:32,239
know I can't read every comment in the

1991
01:25:30,159 --> 01:25:34,159
world on all the platforms I'm just

1992
01:25:32,239 --> 01:25:36,840
letting you know but on YouTube for sure

1993
01:25:34,159 --> 01:25:39,400
I've I read every single one of

1994
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:41,239
them so if you want to say something

1995
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:43,440
terrible to me that's a great place to

1996
01:25:41,239 --> 01:25:46,760
do

1997
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:46,760
it e

1998
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:55,920
w why do you do this why do you do that

1999
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:59,040
I'll read it I'll have my cold packs

2000
01:25:55,920 --> 01:26:01,719
ready all right so my crinkle fries are

2001
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:04,920
cooking once they're cooked making the

2002
01:26:01,719 --> 01:26:07,920
cheese sauce putting on the fixings and

2003
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:10,159
we're going nacho crazy

2004
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:11,719
um now I want to bring out one of the

2005
01:26:10,159 --> 01:26:15,320
books

2006
01:26:11,719 --> 01:26:18,080
here do you have brain saver protocols

2007
01:26:15,320 --> 01:26:20,760
the amount of symptoms and conditions in

2008
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:23,639
here really really incredible and

2009
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:26,320
helpful and the Protocols are in here

2010
01:26:23,639 --> 01:26:29,040
too I see a lot of

2011
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:30,840
people they look at a protocol and

2012
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:32,639
they're like what do I do and there's a

2013
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:35,520
chapter in here that covers that where

2014
01:26:32,639 --> 01:26:36,400
you can start out with just one thing or

2015
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:39,920
two

2016
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:42,960
things or three things and you can start

2017
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:45,800
out small and just keep it to that you

2018
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:48,080
can also go as far as you need to go and

2019
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:49,760
that's in here too sometimes some people

2020
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:52,239
be like whoa wait a minute he's got a

2021
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:54,639
protocol in there there's a lot going

2022
01:26:52,239 --> 01:26:56,560
going on how do I do that what do I do

2023
01:26:54,639 --> 01:26:58,639
and what people don't realize is if you

2024
01:26:56,560 --> 01:27:01,199
read the instructions in the book If you

2025
01:26:58,639 --> 01:27:03,280
read the chapter about supplementation

2026
01:27:01,199 --> 01:27:05,760
and protocols for symptoms and

2027
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:08,600
conditions what you'll find is that you

2028
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:10,199
can start just with some of the key

2029
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:14,360
foundational

2030
01:27:10,199 --> 01:27:16,679
tools key foundational supplements and

2031
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:18,520
you can start there and see how you feel

2032
01:27:16,679 --> 01:27:20,639
along the way but you know you can go

2033
01:27:18,520 --> 01:27:22,639
further and further the thing about

2034
01:27:20,639 --> 01:27:24,800
medical medium information is you can

2035
01:27:22,639 --> 01:27:27,600
take it as far as you need to go but a

2036
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:29,320
lot of people don't do that so a lot of

2037
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:31,159
people will do some celery juice for

2038
01:27:29,320 --> 01:27:33,320
like two weeks and then they'll claim

2039
01:27:31,159 --> 01:27:35,800
they did medical medium especially if

2040
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:38,119
they're a hater so you got to keep in

2041
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:40,920
mind is you'll see out there people

2042
01:27:38,119 --> 01:27:42,440
scream I did medical medium and this

2043
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:45,119
terrible thing happened to me it's like

2044
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:48,440
you did do med you did medical medium

2045
01:27:45,119 --> 01:27:50,880
really or did you do a whole bunch of

2046
01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:53,600
other stuff you mean you weren't eating

2047
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:55,920
chocolate you you mean you weren't doing

2048
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:58,560
this you weren't doing that and so

2049
01:27:55,920 --> 01:28:01,040
people just they will just scream at if

2050
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:03,080
they're a hater like if they if for some

2051
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:05,719
reason someone convinces them I'm a bad

2052
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:08,320
guy or something they like okay and they

2053
01:28:05,719 --> 01:28:10,880
did celery juice for like a week or

2054
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:12,920
every other day for a month and they're

2055
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:14,880
doing all this other stuff right and

2056
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:17,320
they just like I did medical medium and

2057
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:19,840
it doesn't work he did this he did this

2058
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:22,840
it did this look out for that because

2059
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:24,520
it's ridiculous and people don't realize

2060
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:25,840
that there's a lot of exposures people

2061
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:28,360
are up against

2062
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:31,199
too so every day we have all these

2063
01:28:28,360 --> 01:28:32,960
exposures that we're up against and

2064
01:28:31,199 --> 01:28:34,360
every day we also have things inside of

2065
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:37,159
our body that have been sitting there

2066
01:28:34,360 --> 01:28:39,639
for like 20 30 40 years wreaking havoc

2067
01:28:37,159 --> 01:28:41,480
on our body that people haven't gotten

2068
01:28:39,639 --> 01:28:43,360
out of their body because they're not

2069
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:45,520
doing the right stuff to get the junk

2070
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:47,199
and garbage out so they have a drain on

2071
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:49,760
them of what's inside their body that's

2072
01:28:47,199 --> 01:28:53,679
toxic and then they're getting outside

2073
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:56,719
exposures on a regular basis

2074
01:28:53,679 --> 01:28:59,679
I've seen over the years like doctors

2075
01:28:56,719 --> 01:29:01,800
tell me I thought my patient was doing

2076
01:28:59,679 --> 01:29:03,119
medical medium and it turns out they

2077
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:04,760
were drinking on the weekends every

2078
01:29:03,119 --> 01:29:07,040
single

2079
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:09,840
weekend I

2080
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:12,679
had a feather for every time I heard

2081
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:15,719
that I'd be like flying

2082
01:29:12,679 --> 01:29:19,480
away to a tropical

2083
01:29:15,719 --> 01:29:21,639
island and never coming back again like

2084
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:23,000
seriously and I mean this like I can't

2085
01:29:21,639 --> 01:29:25,199
tell you how many practitioners I've

2086
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:26,800
talked to where they're like I thought

2087
01:29:25,199 --> 01:29:28,800
they were doing medical medium but when

2088
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:31,320
I really asked them and I really went

2089
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:33,400
into it cuz I thought they were doing

2090
01:29:31,320 --> 01:29:36,320
what they were supposed to do that the

2091
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:38,760
doctor was guiding them on and they

2092
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:39,880
weren't they were doing so many other

2093
01:29:38,760 --> 01:29:42,320
different

2094
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:45,639
things and it was affecting

2095
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:46,960
them so what you'll see is a bunch of

2096
01:29:45,639 --> 01:29:52,360
situations that are occurring in the

2097
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:54,080
medical M community and one of them is

2098
01:29:52,360 --> 01:29:57,000
like I tried medical medium and it

2099
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:59,040
didn't work but yet the person didn't

2100
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:01,000
try they didn't do the monoc cleanse for

2101
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:03,000
their digestive problems they didn't do

2102
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:05,239
the 28 day cleanse and they just stay

2103
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:07,199
off all the heavy fats they were eating

2104
01:30:05,239 --> 01:30:09,400
they were on fat all the time and

2105
01:30:07,199 --> 01:30:11,679
there's nothing wrong with that there's

2106
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:14,199
nothing wrong with trying something and

2107
01:30:11,679 --> 01:30:16,040
not doing all of it there's nothing

2108
01:30:14,199 --> 01:30:19,000
wrong with trying one or two medical

2109
01:30:16,040 --> 01:30:22,520
medium tools and then keeping the others

2110
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:25,679
out what's wrong is screaming

2111
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:29,080
that I did medical medium when you

2112
01:30:25,679 --> 01:30:32,000
didn't that's wrong and I see that a lot

2113
01:30:29,080 --> 01:30:33,800
out there and it's sad because you might

2114
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:36,840
be this other person that's like a new

2115
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:38,400
person that just came in like I heard a

2116
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:40,760
whole bunch of people healed on medical

2117
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:42,600
medium they got the most healing stories

2118
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:44,760
in the world out of any

2119
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:47,440
single you know whatever out there in

2120
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:48,320
the health world so let me try something

2121
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:50,840
and then all of a sudden they get

2122
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:52,480
bombarded with someone that's like

2123
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:53,960
trolling

2124
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:56,199
I tried medical medium it didn't work

2125
01:30:53,960 --> 01:30:58,960
for me my whatever got worse than I

2126
01:30:56,199 --> 01:31:01,600
would ever I go and try this and this

2127
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:03,679
helped me over here and then they're

2128
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:05,360
screwed they're like they don't try

2129
01:31:03,679 --> 01:31:07,040
medical medium they're off to doing the

2130
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:09,600
same old stuff that everybody's ever

2131
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:12,800
done and whatnot hopefully they find

2132
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:14,920
their way back but that doesn't always

2133
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:17,760
happen so there's nothing wrong with

2134
01:31:14,920 --> 01:31:19,440
trying one thing and there's nothing

2135
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:20,800
wrong with also dabbling and other

2136
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:23,520
things out there but when it's not

2137
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:26,119
working for you don't blame what you're

2138
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:28,199
dabbling in on medical medium so if

2139
01:31:26,119 --> 01:31:31,280
you're doing bad zeyt cuz they're all

2140
01:31:28,199 --> 01:31:33,159
bad now don't blame medical medium when

2141
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:34,760
something's not working for you if

2142
01:31:33,159 --> 01:31:37,159
you're doing the Pearl powder the bad

2143
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:39,719
zeits the charcoal ingesting it the

2144
01:31:37,159 --> 01:31:41,920
Bentonite Clays you're doing all that

2145
01:31:39,719 --> 01:31:45,040
plus 100 sodium

2146
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:47,800
bicarbonate don't blame medical medium a

2147
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:49,480
year later after you did all the stuff

2148
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:52,560
that damaged your health that medical

2149
01:31:49,480 --> 01:31:54,800
medum doesn't doesn't recommend that's

2150
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:56,159
wrong and that's what people are doing

2151
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:57,480
if you're eating a chocolate bar every

2152
01:31:56,159 --> 01:31:59,520
week and another chocolate bar every

2153
01:31:57,480 --> 01:32:01,920
week don't say you did medical medium

2154
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:04,040
when you're sick and the chocolate bar

2155
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:06,400
got you more viral cuz it just blew up

2156
01:32:04,040 --> 01:32:09,520
your immune system and nervous

2157
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:12,760
system don't then say it was medical

2158
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:14,639
medium that did it that's what's wrong

2159
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:16,360
same thing with Medical Treatments if

2160
01:32:14,639 --> 01:32:18,600
you go and try a medical treatment cuz

2161
01:32:16,360 --> 01:32:21,239
that's up to you I believe in doctors I

2162
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:22,320
recommend doctors all the time I love

2163
01:32:21,239 --> 01:32:24,360
doctors

2164
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:26,040
everybody should have one but what

2165
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:28,600
happens is if you're doing a medical

2166
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:31,119
treatment that went wrong don't blame

2167
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:33,560
medical medium and the celery juice

2168
01:32:31,119 --> 01:32:35,600
that's where that's just and

2169
01:32:33,560 --> 01:32:38,480
the same thing if you got into a new

2170
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:39,920
relationship and you caught 10 new bugs

2171
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:43,000
and now you have a new bat of chronic

2172
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:45,480
fatigue syndrome and a new UTI don't

2173
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:47,760
blame medical medium that's just

2174
01:32:45,480 --> 01:32:49,719
 just keep that in mind I know

2175
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:51,719
you guys don't do it I know you guys

2176
01:32:49,719 --> 01:32:53,920
aren't doing that I'm just saying that

2177
01:32:51,719 --> 01:32:55,920
and then it's not you guys but it's

2178
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:58,520
people out there that are that are you

2179
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:59,960
know that do that okay they'll get into

2180
01:32:58,520 --> 01:33:04,040
a new relationship but they won't be

2181
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:05,800
honest about it you know and which is

2182
01:33:04,040 --> 01:33:07,080
fine we we should be able to get into

2183
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:10,560
relationships if we want to get into

2184
01:33:07,080 --> 01:33:12,760
relationships but if you do if you do

2185
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:14,440
get two or three more viruses and three

2186
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:16,400
varieties of strep and you all of a

2187
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:19,440
sudden got UTI and sinus infections

2188
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:19,440
again don't blame medical

2189
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:23,560
media if you're somebody that's doing

2190
01:33:21,719 --> 01:33:25,480
ice baths all the time then 6 months

2191
01:33:23,560 --> 01:33:27,080
later you get into adrenal fatigue

2192
01:33:25,480 --> 01:33:30,320
because your adrenals just got drained

2193
01:33:27,080 --> 01:33:32,639
from the ice baths don't blame medical

2194
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:34,600
medium if you're using the alkaline

2195
01:33:32,639 --> 01:33:36,639
ionizer water machines the ones that

2196
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:40,440

2197
01:33:36,639 --> 01:33:40,440
kangaroo the ones that sound like

2198
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:45,440
kangaroo if you do those and you're

2199
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:47,239

01:40:48,239 --> 01:40:52,440
there let's go with a tablespoon of some

2345
01:40:50,239 --> 01:40:55,080
squeezed lime

2346
01:40:52,440 --> 01:40:58,880
lime nice it's

2347
01:40:55,080 --> 01:40:58,880
easy these limes are

2348
01:41:06,119 --> 01:41:12,040
ripe and need one more I want to make

2349
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:12,040
sure we get a tablespoon

2350
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:16,920
there

2351
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:22,040
cool

2352
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:23,920
yep

2353
01:41:22,040 --> 01:41:24,960
one tablespoon of freshly squeezed lime

2354
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:27,239
or

2355
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:30,520
lemon but we're going to do two cuz I'm

2356
01:41:27,239 --> 01:41:30,520
making a bigger batch of

2357
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:34,520
course that's what it

2358
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:46,480
is yeah nothing like a good lime maxwood

2359
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:49,400
good job it's true so

2360
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:51,719
true now listen I like my fries a little

2361
01:41:49,400 --> 01:41:54,239
extra crunchy I I like them like a

2362
01:41:51,719 --> 01:41:55,280
little bit you know browned nice right

2363
01:41:54,239 --> 01:41:57,960
okay there we

2364
01:41:55,280 --> 01:42:01,560
go that's how I like my

2365
01:41:57,960 --> 01:42:03,960
fries all right what else is in here

2366
01:42:01,560 --> 01:42:06,080
little bit of water if we need it so I'm

2367
01:42:03,960 --> 01:42:07,960
going to I'm going to be careful with

2368
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:10,400
this

2369
01:42:07,960 --> 01:42:13,960
because you put too much water in there

2370
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:18,040
then you got a cheese that you may not

2371
01:42:13,960 --> 01:42:18,040
want boom

2372
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:23,040
boom

2373
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:25,400
we're going to add some water in

2374
01:42:23,040 --> 01:42:26,599
now guess what we're not using

2375
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:28,440
nutritional

2376
01:42:26,599 --> 01:42:30,320
yeast you know many people do

2377
01:42:28,440 --> 01:42:32,360
nutritional yeast and they mess up their

2378
01:42:30,320 --> 01:42:35,440
health because of

2379
01:42:32,360 --> 01:42:37,080
it I'm doing medical medium but they're

2380
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:38,520
taking down all that nutritional yeast

2381
01:42:37,080 --> 01:42:40,280
it's on everything they're buying stuff

2382
01:42:38,520 --> 01:42:42,000
with nutritional yeast in it but I'm

2383
01:42:40,280 --> 01:42:45,239
doing medical medium and it hurt me but

2384
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:45,239
they're doing all this nutritional

2385
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:52,119
yeast it's okay to actually do one

2386
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:54,119
medical medium thing and only one

2387
01:42:52,119 --> 01:42:56,599
medical medium thing there's nothing

2388
01:42:54,119 --> 01:42:56,599
wrong with

2389
01:42:58,360 --> 01:43:03,880
that you can do one or two medical

2390
01:43:01,400 --> 01:43:03,880
medium

2391
01:43:07,119 --> 01:43:13,280
things like I challenge people to do one

2392
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:13,280
medical medium thing it's

2393
01:43:14,440 --> 01:43:19,840
fine but if something's not working for

2394
01:43:17,719 --> 01:43:22,560
you look at everything else you're doing

2395
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:25,000
or you did look at everything before you

2396
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:28,920
start screaming from the roof

2397
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:31,159
rooftop about like celery juice giving

2398
01:43:28,920 --> 01:43:31,159
you the

2399
01:43:32,520 --> 01:43:37,119
runs anyway it's just something to think

2400
01:43:35,119 --> 01:43:39,239
about I keep on for forgetting to bring

2401
01:43:37,119 --> 01:43:39,239
it

2402
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:45,440
up let's take a look at this I want to

2403
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:47,360
see the

2404
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:48,880
consistency it's actually a good

2405
01:43:47,360 --> 01:43:52,679
consistency right there I actually

2406
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:52,679
really like that let's give it another

2407
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:57,000
run

2408
01:43:58,520 --> 01:44:03,840
okay and what I'm going to do is is sprp

2409
01:44:01,639 --> 01:44:03,840
the

2410
01:44:17,080 --> 01:44:22,159
sides and I might put a little bit more

2411
01:44:19,719 --> 01:44:24,320
potato in this one which I like I think

2412
01:44:22,159 --> 01:44:25,920
it's a good idea I put a little extra

2413
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:28,159
carrot in there versus

2414
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:31,000
potato look you can have the cheddar

2415
01:44:28,159 --> 01:44:33,239
cheese look right there where it's that

2416
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:35,320
like but what I'm going to do is just

2417
01:44:33,239 --> 01:44:39,040
lighten it up a little

2418
01:44:35,320 --> 01:44:39,040
bit with another

2419
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:46,440
potato and I hear my crinkle fries are

2420
01:44:47,719 --> 01:44:52,560
calling well there we go

2421
01:44:54,639 --> 01:44:57,159
that should do

2422
01:44:57,840 --> 01:45:01,239
it bigger

2423
01:45:02,679 --> 01:45:06,360
batch a little bit

2424
01:45:13,639 --> 01:45:20,280
water I'm so

2425
01:45:16,440 --> 01:45:23,800
hungry I am excited I am like psyched

2426
01:45:20,280 --> 01:45:23,800
and pumped about eating

2427
01:45:33,960 --> 01:45:38,880
this let's see the consistency that I

2428
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:38,880
want for

2429
01:45:40,320 --> 01:45:45,800
cheese I don't want

2430
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:45,800
it

2431
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:49,040
that's all

2432
01:45:49,480 --> 01:45:52,480
right

2433
01:45:54,400 --> 01:45:58,360
you want to do is put the cheese on

2434
01:45:55,760 --> 01:46:00,840
First on top of the crinkle fries before

2435
01:45:58,360 --> 01:46:00,840

2436
01:46:03,880 --> 01:46:09,440
