[290.82 - 295.26] like that for a second too all right
[293.04 - 296.40] pathogen exposure shot like I said
[295.26 - 297.84] because I see a bunch of people coming
[296.40 - 300.06] on right now you feel you've been around
[297.84 - 302.28] others who've been contagious they have
[300.06 - 304.38] something they're saying it's their

[307.74 - 310.62] somebody that says it you got the
[309.00 - 312.78] allergies like allergies every three
[310.62 - 315.42] months but yet you're catching a flu
[312.78 - 317.28] every three months I know people out
[315.42 - 319.32] there I've seen it for years they're
[317.28 - 321.12] catching the flu every two to three
[319.32 - 323.10] months but they think it's allergies
[321.12 - 324.48] then they got the bronchitis then they
[323.10 - 326.64] got the coughing then they're coughing
[324.48 - 329.34] up the green phlegm then they're blowing
[326.64 - 331.26] out the green phlegm right and they
[329.34 - 332.76] think it's allergies that's not
[331.26 - 336.24] allergies
[332.76 - 339.72] okay that's not what allergies is
[336.24 - 342.30] Stephen sin says since he says this book

[342.30 - 345.66] of long covet finally going away thanks
[344.40 - 347.22] to following the medical medium

[362.64 - 367.02] so during the holidays when people get
[365.28 - 369.42] together there's always somebody that's
[367.02 - 371.46] coughing or sneezing and then forget it
[369.42 - 374.66] five days later
[371.46 - 377.40] everybody who is there most everybody
[374.66 - 379.44] comes down with something that's usually
[377.40 - 383.04] how it works okay so what I like about
[379.44 - 384.54] the pathogen exposure shot I'm taking it
[383.04 - 386.16] when I'm around people during the
[384.54 - 388.44] holidays right so that's what I'm doing
[386.16 - 389.88] I'm making that shot and I'm taking it
[388.44 - 392.04] that's the whole point I'm also doing
[389.88 - 393.90] I'm also doing the micro C I'm also
[392.04 - 396.00] doing the propolis pure I'm also doing
[393.90 - 398.40] the zinc right so I'm doing that too
[396.00 - 401.88] which is incredible all on its own but
[398.40 - 403.68] but I I just love having these tools it
[401.88 - 405.00] just makes you feel good when these
[403.68 - 407.04] tools are here
[405.00 - 409.62] okay
[407.04 - 411.84] so you're concerned about having shared
[409.62 - 413.28] bodily fluids through public restrooms
[411.84 - 415.50] during the holidays
[413.28 - 417.06] you're in a public restroom how many
[415.50 - 418.92] people went into that public restroom
[417.06 - 420.24] that have RSV they have the flu they
[418.92 - 423.90] have a cold that have something right
[420.24 - 425.64] going around how many people are using
[423.90 - 428.82] those toilets and so forth and
[425.64 - 431.04] everything else at public restrooms
[428.82 - 432.90] um you're concerned about shared bodily
[431.04 - 435.00] fluids with sexual activity or something
[432.90 - 437.10] and you're concerned or something and
[435.00 - 438.84] I've always talked to doctors about that
[437.10 - 440.64] and said get them get them doing stuff
[438.84 - 444.12] for their immune system so they don't
[440.64 - 446.40] have to be so scared and stuff you
[444.12 - 449.16] believe you might have been exposed to
[446.40 - 451.32] foodborne pathogens and you can you're
[449.16 - 452.88] concerned about getting food poisoning
[451.32 - 456.18] and that's what I love about the
[452.88 - 458.46] pathogen exposure shot it has all these
[456.18 - 461.04] options right here built into it which
[458.46 - 462.48] is incredible right there right
[461.04 - 463.74] but right now
[462.48 - 466.08] really
[463.74 - 468.42] everybody's coughing everybody's sick
[466.08 - 471.48] everybody's got the bronchitis everybody
[468.42 - 474.36] has the sniffles the fevers and all that
[471.48 - 477.84] and it's just rampant right now and
[474.36 - 480.54] there's a cold and flu protocol even for
[477.84 - 483.48] children in this book right here so
[480.54 - 485.94] there's protocols for cold and flu
[483.48 - 487.56] it's in the book so we're doing a few
[485.94 - 490.80] things we're gonna do pathogen exposure
[487.56 - 493.10] shot let's get started on it let's get
[490.80 - 493.10] working
[493.62 - 498.84] all right let's make the shot so I'll
[496.98 - 501.18] just grab if you got a juicer you just
[498.84 - 503.10] make the shot with the juicer that's
[501.18 - 505.52] the best way to do it I'm gonna put this
[503.10 - 508.62] here I'm gonna put this here
[505.52 - 510.72] so all right
[508.62 - 512.10] I got my celery I got everything here
[510.72 - 516.48] that I need so I'm going to start out
[512.10 - 519.96] with six sprigs of thyme so let me get
[516.48 - 521.76] some sprigs of thyme right here
[519.96 - 525.42] so
[521.76 - 527.64] I love thyme we're gonna do time T shock
[525.42 - 530.46] therapy which I'm excited about let me
[527.64 - 533.04] get some nice sprigs I can I can choose
[530.46 - 535.62] the sprigs I want because I have a big
[533.04 - 537.60] pile of time right here
[535.62 - 539.46] from the garden which is really cool
[537.60 - 541.80] right Garden time so I can choose all
[539.46 - 543.78] these nice little sprigs here
[541.80 - 545.70] amazing
[543.78 - 548.52] all right so that's the first ingredient
[545.70 - 551.16] I have right there sprigs of Rosemary is
[548.52 - 553.70] the next one so let me throw this down
[551.16 - 553.70] the chute
[557.10 - 563.34] I'm doing the pathogen exposure shot
[561.24 - 566.16] every day right now
[563.34 - 568.62] I'm also doing the propolis every day I
[566.16 - 571.44] don't have the flu
[568.62 - 574.14] I don't have a cold
[571.44 - 576.66] but I'm still doing
[574.14 - 578.82] the zinc and the propolis right I'm
[576.66 - 580.62] still doing that
[578.82 - 582.90] so I put a little time in there let me
[580.62 - 586.28] put a little bit of Rosemary now too two
[582.90 - 586.28] sprigs of fresh Rosemary
[587.64 - 592.46] news flash
[589.50 - 592.46] forewarning
[592.98 - 597.62] this shot has got a bite to it
[598.32 - 603.66] okay I put I put roughly around six
[601.44 - 606.72] sprigs of thyme in there there we go
[603.66 - 609.54] that that pretty much gives us about six
[606.72 - 612.54] one small quote a clove of garlic right
[609.54 - 615.00] here boom so here's the thing with this
[612.54 - 617.70] if you use a really big clove of garlic
[615.00 - 620.94] in the pathogen exposure shot
[617.70 - 625.68] it's gonna be really bitey
[620.94 - 628.38] okay so that's a medium clove so small
[625.68 - 632.04] to medium is what's really
[628.38 - 635.28] directed for that too raw
[632.04 - 638.18] medium asparagus
[635.28 - 638.18] stocks
[638.88 - 644.12] and you go
[641.22 - 644.12] there you go
[646.86 - 652.26] to Rob brussels sprouts
[649.50 - 654.96] I'm looking for a Brussels sprout is
[652.26 - 658.80] what I'm looking for and I have them I'm
[654.96 - 660.78] also gonna find a knife really quick
[658.80 - 662.76] so I'm going to cut them in half if you
[660.78 - 665.22] guys just got on here we're dealing with
[662.76 - 666.78] cold and flu tools is what we're working
[665.22 - 669.00] with right here
[666.78 - 670.56] mm info we're doing the pathogen
[669.00 - 674.04] exposure shot we're also going to be
[670.56 - 676.98] doing time T shock therapy
[674.04 - 679.56] we're also going to be doing
[676.98 - 680.94] a little bit of zinc some propolis
[679.56 - 683.88] propolis
[680.94 - 685.14] I don't know what
[683.88 - 686.64] what
[685.14 - 689.28] the world
[686.64 - 692.10] is missing out when they don't have
[689.28 - 695.40] propolis is so important all right
[692.10 - 698.18] two stalks of celery now
[695.40 - 698.18] got one
[700.98 - 704.52] I gave this a really thorough rinse you
[703.62 - 706.44] guys
[704.52 - 709.88] so if you're like wait a minute he
[706.44 - 709.88] didn't wash it what is he doing
[721.32 - 724.16] there you go
[730.08 - 733.46] so it's all washed
[738.00 - 741.02] picking up messages
[743.36 - 749.06] all right
[746.22 - 749.06] there we go
[750.54 - 755.46] so I have the pathogen exposure shot
[753.48 - 757.70] right here I'm very excited about this
[755.46 - 757.70] actually
[771.78 - 774.62] there we go
[775.98 - 780.86] so I'm doing this every single day right
[778.68 - 780.86] now
[780.90 - 785.22] worried about any exposures around
[782.82 - 788.06] anybody it's an important one to do so
[785.22 - 788.06] I'm going to take a shot now
[789.42 - 792.42] just keep in mind it's got a little bit
[790.98 - 794.22] of a bite to it
[792.42 - 797.28] but we're talking about antibacterial
[794.22 - 799.68] we're talking about antiviral
[797.28 - 801.54] talking about anti-pathogen that's what
[799.68 - 803.34] this is right here so when you have this
[801.54 - 805.80] going through the bloodstream now
[803.34 - 810.48] medical medium information talks about
[805.80 - 813.24] time staying longer in the bloodstream
[810.48 - 816.18] so that's really a powerful aspect of
[813.24 - 818.88] time but when the time is mixed with
[816.18 - 821.64] these ingredients it UPS the game so
[818.88 - 823.98] this is information from above
[821.64 - 825.48] this isn't concocted by me saying hey I
[823.98 - 827.64] feel like putting some time in Rosemary
[825.48 - 829.80] together and a little bit asparagus and
[827.64 - 831.96] everything else let me just make a drink
[829.80 - 833.84] it might be supportive for my immune
[831.96 - 836.82] system this was explicit directions
[833.84 - 840.26] details that came from above for this
[836.82 - 840.26] pathogen exposure shot
[842.10 - 848.16] it just feels really good too going down
[845.24 - 850.50] I feel like I'm arming my immune system
[848.16 - 852.96] what I like to do is I like to focus on
[850.50 - 855.54] that too and focus on my immune cells
[852.96 - 857.70] eating this up because this is fuel for
[855.54 - 859.26] the for your immune system right and
[857.70 - 861.06] then I'm thinking about phytochemical
[859.26 - 862.50] compounds that are in the time and
[861.06 - 864.90] everything else
[862.50 - 869.16] in this shot in this phytochemical
[864.90 - 872.10] compounds are injuring and damaging not
[869.16 - 875.64] you but the pathogen
[872.10 - 878.64] so what's in this pathogen exposure shot
[875.64 - 880.86] or weaponized phytochemical compounds
[878.64 - 884.66] through nature that are going towards
[880.86 - 884.66] those bugs so
[885.48 - 889.68] boom
[887.82 - 890.70] feels so good it really does so you guys
[889.68 - 893.28] I don't know if you're doing the
[890.70 - 894.90] pathogen exposure shot but
[893.28 - 897.50] you might want to consider it if you
[894.90 - 897.50] haven't done it
[903.24 - 906.02] all right so
[906.24 - 909.90] do you know anybody who said anybody
[908.16 - 911.46] who's got the flu anybody who's coughing
[909.90 - 913.20] it's running through a lot of households
[911.46 - 914.52] right now it's all I hear about out
[913.20 - 916.68] there it's all is that what you're
[914.52 - 919.08] hearing about too
[916.68 - 920.28] all right so let's keep it going here's
[919.08 - 922.02] the question right can you talk about
[920.28 - 923.94] how we are taught that the more
[922.02 - 927.90] exposures we have the stronger immune
[923.94 - 929.70] system gets and why that this is false
[927.90 - 932.76] it's very false
[929.70 - 935.10] okay so what you'll hear out there
[932.76 - 938.52] is you'll hear
[935.10 - 939.96] germs make your make you stronger
[938.52 - 942.30] and that's what you'll hear out there
[939.96 - 943.16] right but that's information that comes
[942.30 - 945.42] from
[943.16 - 947.46] authorities in health
[945.42 - 949.62] that don't know why people are sick to
[947.46 - 951.66] begin with so you have to keep that in
[949.62 - 952.86] mind most important part of that
[951.66 - 954.96] question
[952.86 - 956.94] the most important part of the answer to
[954.96 - 959.94] that question is this
[956.94 - 961.98] that's information coming from the
[959.94 - 964.68] health world that doesn't know why
[961.98 - 966.90] someone has fibro MS
[964.68 - 969.24] any kind of neurological condition or
[966.90 - 971.10] symptom neurological fatigue tingles
[969.24 - 973.56] numbness burning aches and pains skin
[971.10 - 975.78] problems all the different things that
[973.56 - 977.28] people are suffering with migraines that
[975.78 - 979.62] are mysterious all the mysterious
[977.28 - 982.74] symptoms trigeminal neuralgia burning
[979.62 - 985.14] skin burning mouth burning tongue
[982.74 - 987.06] oh that's a mystery to medical research
[985.14 - 988.50] and science alternative medical research
[987.06 - 990.78] and science too
[988.50 - 992.10] all of that is a mystery unless they
[990.78 - 994.50] have the books right unless they have
[992.10 - 997.20] brain saver brain saving protocols so
[994.50 - 999.48] your question already
[997.20 - 1001.52] kind of falls into the place where okay
[999.48 - 1004.22] so whoever's saying that in the health
[1001.52 - 1006.08] world that that what you get exposed to
[1004.22 - 1009.98] makes you stronger
[1006.08 - 1012.62] how are we even able to trust that
[1009.98 - 1015.08] when they don't even know why someone's
[1012.62 - 1016.82] in a wheelchair with MS someone doesn't
[1015.08 - 1020.00] feel good and they got fibro lupus
[1016.82 - 1021.74] someone has pots someone has decided to
[1020.00 - 1023.60] know me so how come how come they don't
[1021.74 - 1025.46] know any answers to anything about why
[1023.60 - 1028.04] people are sick they don't know why
[1025.46 - 1029.96] people have aches and pains and tingles
[1028.04 - 1032.48] and numbness and vertigo and dizziness
[1029.96 - 1036.32] and balance issues so
[1032.48 - 1038.66] it's like oh I'm Authority in health
[1036.32 - 1040.28] and what doesn't kill you makes you
[1038.66 - 1042.38] stronger
[1040.28 - 1045.20] I'm an authority in health and what what
[1042.38 - 1047.60] what doesn't kill you makes you stronger
[1045.20 - 1051.02] the more you get exposed to
[1047.60 - 1052.82] the healthier and stronger you are okay
[1051.02 - 1054.62] well then tell me why everybody's sick
[1052.82 - 1057.38] with chronic illness we don't know why
[1054.62 - 1059.42] everybody's sick we have no idea is it
[1057.38 - 1062.66] the genes is it everybody's genes think
[1059.42 - 1064.64] about how ridiculous it is
[1062.66 - 1066.14] so the health authorities in Alternative
[1064.64 - 1067.76] Health or whatever conventional Health
[1066.14 - 1070.52] that are saying that you get stronger
[1067.76 - 1072.98] from getting exposed when they don't
[1070.52 - 1074.48] even know why anyone is sick why moms
[1072.98 - 1076.28] can't get out of bed why people are
[1074.48 - 1078.26] struggling with severe crippling anxiety
[1076.28 - 1079.82] and depression
[1078.26 - 1081.86] if you don't know why people go into
[1079.82 - 1083.66] fitsamania and they're living with
[1081.86 - 1086.54] bipolar syndrome and they're not and
[1083.66 - 1088.46] they're suffering and struggling or they
[1086.54 - 1089.78] can't even walk they're so inflamed
[1088.46 - 1092.06] throughout their whole body they have no
[1089.78 - 1093.98] idea why but they have the answer that
[1092.06 - 1096.32] more exposure helps you
[1093.98 - 1097.52] think about that
[1096.32 - 1101.78] okay
[1097.52 - 1104.78] our immune system is already Under Siege
[1101.78 - 1107.12] so if we get more problems with their
[1104.78 - 1110.54] immune system more challenges with their
[1107.12 - 1114.02] immune system it can tank it
[1110.54 - 1116.60] so it's not it doesn't make you stronger
[1114.02 - 1119.06] it can finally finish somebody off
[1116.60 - 1121.40] that's how it works our bone marrow has
[1119.06 - 1124.16] to go into overdrive to produce immune
[1121.40 - 1126.68] cells to try to protect you so exposing
[1124.16 - 1129.02] you more is good for your bone marrow to
[1126.68 - 1131.42] produce all those immune cells explosion
[1129.02 - 1132.68] someone with lupus is already so exposed
[1131.42 - 1134.84] already their immune system is
[1132.68 - 1136.82] struggling left and right every day so
[1134.84 - 1138.62] okay let's expose that person to more
[1136.82 - 1141.26] stuff because some health authority
[1138.62 - 1144.68] alternatively or conventionally says
[1141.26 - 1146.00] that it's good for it it's good for your
[1144.68 - 1148.10] immune system when they don't know why
[1146.00 - 1149.72] you have Lupus okay so if I was somebody
[1148.10 - 1153.26] then check this out because if you like
[1149.72 - 1154.82] it give me a second if I had lupus
[1153.26 - 1156.92] and I've been to all the different
[1154.82 - 1158.42] doctors functional medicine doctors
[1156.92 - 1160.34] don't know why people have Lupus they
[1158.42 - 1161.48] don't unless they use mm info we know
[1160.34 - 1163.82] that
[1161.48 - 1165.92] but if no one if I had lupus and I went
[1163.82 - 1167.90] to 10 Specialists and they didn't know
[1165.92 - 1170.06] why I had lupus and then they told me
[1167.90 - 1171.74] but more exposure is good for you how do
[1170.06 - 1175.06] you even trust or believe that when they
[1171.74 - 1175.06] don't even know why I have lupus
[1175.88 - 1180.20] if more exposures
[1178.10 - 1182.84] help someone then how come when an
[1180.20 - 1184.10] elderly person whose immune system is
[1182.84 - 1186.74] lowered
[1184.10 - 1188.78] because they're elderly they're already
[1186.74 - 1189.70] struggling how come they're worried
[1188.78 - 1192.68] about
[1189.70 - 1194.42] exposing them you get ammonia you die as
[1192.68 - 1197.96] an elderly person
[1194.42 - 1199.28] an older person is more the morbidity
[1197.96 - 1202.52] rate
[1199.28 - 1205.10] it's more exposure is the scarier part
[1202.52 - 1206.48] about older people that's why people
[1205.10 - 1210.14] when they're all in the nursing homes
[1206.48 - 1212.48] during the whole covid blow up
[1210.14 - 1214.64] lost their lives
[1212.48 - 1215.72] did it make them stronger they were
[1214.64 - 1217.16] already sensitive they're already
[1215.72 - 1219.80] bedridden some of them they were already
[1217.16 - 1222.44] struggling how is it possible on any
[1219.80 - 1223.94] level that more exposure of anything is
[1222.44 - 1225.50] good for someone who's already sick and
[1223.94 - 1229.40] struggling
[1225.50 - 1231.38] so if I have Lupus if I had fibro and I
[1229.40 - 1232.94] asked my doctor why do I have fibro and
[1231.38 - 1235.88] lupus and they said well we don't really
[1232.94 - 1239.60] know studies suggest what we don't know
[1235.88 - 1241.40] anything it could be autoimmune okay so
[1239.60 - 1242.96] is it better that I should get lots of
[1241.40 - 1244.64] exposures doctor and the doctor could be
[1242.96 - 1246.50] like oh yes but exposures are really
[1244.64 - 1248.54] good I'm a functional medicine MD and
[1246.50 - 1249.86] I'm telling you that
[1248.54 - 1251.66] that thought more can really make you
[1249.86 - 1253.64] stronger and it's good for you I'd be
[1251.66 - 1255.26] like you're insane
[1253.64 - 1256.46] you're telling me you don't know why I'm
[1255.26 - 1257.96] sick and then all of a sudden you're
[1256.46 - 1259.58] saying it's good for me to get exposures
[1257.96 - 1261.02] okay let me keep on drinking out of
[1259.58 - 1263.54] everybody's glass because that will make
[1261.02 - 1265.58] me stronger oh what herpes simplex one
[1263.54 - 1268.28] oh so you're you have a herpes simplex
[1265.58 - 1271.10] one breakout okay let me have your share
[1268.28 - 1273.14] your glass too oh okay great oh there's
[1271.10 - 1275.54] herpes on the edge of the glass it's
[1273.14 - 1277.22] gonna make me stronger so let me just do
[1275.54 - 1280.46] it it's going to make me more stronger
[1277.22 - 1281.90] having this so oh oh oh a year later and
[1280.46 - 1283.88] now I'm breaking out all my lips with
[1281.90 - 1285.38] herpes simplex one it sure as hell
[1283.88 - 1287.30] didn't make me stronger how about
[1285.38 - 1289.76] chlamydia
[1287.30 - 1292.46] how about chlamydia how about that one
[1289.76 - 1294.86] let me just get exposed and catch
[1292.46 - 1297.02] Chlamydia somewhere because it's gonna
[1294.86 - 1298.64] make me stronger meanwhile the UTIs are
[1297.02 - 1301.10] giving me the worst UTI on the planet
[1298.64 - 1302.36] and then another UTI and then I have to
[1301.10 - 1305.90] take all these antibiotics and another
[1302.36 - 1308.12] UTI let me go let me go and jump into
[1305.90 - 1309.56] some like crazy stuff and pick up a
[1308.12 - 1312.26] whole bunch of chlamydia
[1309.56 - 1313.76] and then okay uh doctor give me a bunch
[1312.26 - 1316.78] of antibiotics because that chlamydia is
[1313.76 - 1316.78] sure making me stronger
[1317.72 - 1322.46] next thing you know you're getting UTI
[1319.52 - 1324.08] after UTI after UTI after UTI and now
[1322.46 - 1326.18] you're getting streptococcus all the
[1324.08 - 1328.58] time immune system's breaking down oh it
[1326.18 - 1329.42] makes you stronger though
[1328.58 - 1332.30] foreign
[1329.42 - 1334.76] it doesn't make you stronger
[1332.30 - 1336.80] you don't want more exposure you want
[1334.76 - 1338.06] less exposure but what's happening out
[1336.80 - 1339.80] there is the reason why I'm talking
[1338.06 - 1342.14] about this a little more I was gonna do
[1339.80 - 1343.76] cold and flu tips but the reason why I'm
[1342.14 - 1347.24] talking about this a little bit is
[1343.76 - 1349.28] because oh my God I have seen so many
[1347.24 - 1350.84] like idiot professionals and I'm not
[1349.28 - 1352.76] trying to judge them or anything but
[1350.84 - 1355.88] there's so many professionals now health
[1352.76 - 1358.58] coaches uh naturopaths chiropractors
[1355.88 - 1361.76] Do's functional medicine doctors mvs
[1358.58 - 1365.96] right saying more exposures better for
[1361.76 - 1367.70] you now are you freaking kidding me
[1365.96 - 1369.14] you don't even know why anybody's sick
[1367.70 - 1371.36] you think more exposure is a good thing
[1369.14 - 1373.22] for them oh let me just get exposed to
[1371.36 - 1375.44] five more simplexes how about that and
[1373.22 - 1377.72] maybe herpes simplex too too get getting
[1375.44 - 1381.64] exposure to that is real great or how
[1377.72 - 1381.64] about the flu I don't want the flu
[1384.74 - 1388.94] and I'm not judging anybody you guys I'm
[1386.90 - 1390.20] just saying that more exposure weakens
[1388.94 - 1392.18] the immune system there's enough
[1390.20 - 1394.04] problems already with people suffering
[1392.18 - 1396.02] and struggling right now you guys have
[1394.04 - 1398.54] to know this like people are sick with
[1396.02 - 1400.82] neurological problems for real their
[1398.54 - 1402.50] vagus nerves are all chewed up they get
[1400.82 - 1404.30] all kinds of problems their immune
[1402.50 - 1406.88] systems are damaged and weakened they
[1404.30 - 1408.68] got lupus they got fibro they got ra
[1406.88 - 1411.14] they got neurological fatigue they got
[1408.68 - 1413.84] mecfs right they have everything plus
[1411.14 - 1415.76] all the symptoms going on
[1413.84 - 1417.98] people have a hundred symptoms out there
[1415.76 - 1420.62] they have 50 symptoms out there so let's
[1417.98 - 1424.10] expose them to more does that make any
[1420.62 - 1427.40] sense to you let's expose them to more
[1424.10 - 1430.90] it's absurd it's insane it's ridic it's
[1427.40 - 1430.90] completely ridiculous
[1431.12 - 1435.14] all right we got to keep on moving we
[1433.22 - 1436.64] gotta keep on moving forward we got we
[1435.14 - 1439.46] gotta show to deal with a lot of good
[1436.64 - 1442.22] cool tips and and stuff and all that
[1439.46 - 1443.30] okay because I want to help you guys but
[1442.22 - 1444.80] listen thank you for that question
[1443.30 - 1446.48] because it's been meaning to talk about
[1444.80 - 1449.00] it I wanted to do a podcast episode
[1446.48 - 1451.28] about it eventually oh my God the
[1449.00 - 1453.14] podcast episode list is like this and
[1451.28 - 1455.54] I'm trying to chip away at it to release
[1453.14 - 1457.94] some podcast episodes but
[1455.54 - 1461.54] but what happens is it weakens us and
[1457.94 - 1464.66] and it exposures weaken us so that bugs
[1461.54 - 1467.48] that we have inside of us rise up and
[1464.66 - 1469.04] that's mm info by the way a bunch of
[1467.48 - 1471.20] doctors put put some kind of article
[1469.04 - 1473.78] about that like oh yeah you have these
[1471.20 - 1476.18] dormant viruses that are coming up
[1473.78 - 1479.08] when you get the flu Oh I talked about
[1476.18 - 1479.08] that years ago
[1479.84 - 1484.46] I published it years ago what am I
[1481.82 - 1485.54] saying too so what happens is that some
[1484.46 - 1487.70] of you guys that have been with medical
[1485.54 - 1489.44] medium information for now years know
[1487.70 - 1492.02] I've talked about that how many times
[1489.44 - 1493.88] and we get broken down and then our
[1492.02 - 1497.42] immune systems get broken down and then
[1493.88 - 1500.06] bugs rise up right they rise up and so
[1497.42 - 1502.46] exposures knock are already weakened
[1500.06 - 1504.92] immune system down and then the bugs
[1502.46 - 1506.72] rise up and so what happens is when you
[1504.92 - 1508.22] hear a doctor practitioner and listen do
[1506.72 - 1511.16] what your doctor says and tells you to
[1508.22 - 1513.02] do do what your doctor recommends in all
[1511.16 - 1514.82] of that right I want you to do whatever
[1513.02 - 1516.32] your actors are recommending you your
[1514.82 - 1517.82] doctor what you feel good about whatever
[1516.32 - 1520.36] with your what you're doing your doctor
[1517.82 - 1522.98] but when I hear health professionals say
[1520.36 - 1525.38] exposure is good it'll build up your
[1522.98 - 1526.40] immune system that germs are your immune
[1525.38 - 1529.04] system
[1526.40 - 1532.22] I'm like you don't know anything I'm
[1529.04 - 1534.32] sorry you might have a degree but that
[1532.22 - 1536.84] degree is no better than a piece of
[1534.32 - 1538.16] cheese sitting on a countertop because
[1536.84 - 1540.32] honestly
[1538.16 - 1542.06] if you don't know if you don't know why
[1540.32 - 1544.04] people are sick and you're telling
[1542.06 - 1545.60] people they need germs and germs are
[1544.04 - 1547.64] their immune system
[1545.60 - 1549.68] I'm sorry but take that degree and throw
[1547.64 - 1551.60] it in the trash can just take it off the
[1549.68 - 1552.80] wall and put it in the trash can like
[1551.60 - 1555.46] that
[1552.80 - 1555.46] all right
[1556.28 - 1560.48] but do what your doctor says though if
[1557.96 - 1563.60] you know whatever feels good whatever
[1560.48 - 1565.82] your doctor recommends okay you guys I
[1563.60 - 1567.92] am Gonna Keep On Moving on let's go into
[1565.82 - 1569.06] it so I'm talking about zinc for a
[1567.92 - 1571.22] little bit
[1569.06 - 1573.56] so I take zinc all the time now you guys
[1571.22 - 1575.08] know if you know the medical medium info
[1573.56 - 1577.46] if you know what I've talked about
[1575.08 - 1579.98] quality matters
[1577.46 - 1581.90] the quality is not all the same the
[1579.98 - 1583.16] reason why I actually endorsed Bemidji
[1581.90 - 1585.20] and I said you know what you guys need
[1583.16 - 1587.42] you guys need my official endorsement
[1585.20 - 1589.28] official endorsement I need this stuff
[1587.42 - 1592.28] to stay around for people I don't want
[1589.28 - 1594.74] it to disappear I need it for myself I
[1592.28 - 1597.02] take this stuff for myself and my family
[1594.74 - 1599.06] I don't want it going anywhere so I
[1597.02 - 1600.92] fully endorse them right
[1599.06 - 1602.36] but why would I even do that why would I
[1600.92 - 1603.86] fully endorse them
[1602.36 - 1606.80] because
[1603.86 - 1609.08] they actually don't hide anything in
[1606.80 - 1611.30] their products because the law requires
[1609.08 - 1613.40] that you can hide a certain percentage
[1611.30 - 1615.38] in supplements so supplement companies
[1613.40 - 1618.68] out there they're allowed to actually
[1615.38 - 1622.34] hide a certain percentage of undisclosed
[1618.68 - 1624.98] stuff inside their products femergy said
[1622.34 - 1626.90] no I'm not we're not doing it and I'm
[1624.98 - 1629.78] like okay then that's the best it gets
[1626.90 - 1632.06] I'm sorry that's the best it gets that's
[1629.78 - 1633.32] incredible so that's the first thing the
[1632.06 - 1635.30] other thing qualities here is they
[1633.32 - 1637.58] choose the highest quality stuff there
[1635.30 - 1639.08] is they don't choose the lower quality
[1637.58 - 1640.88] stuff like all the companies do for
[1639.08 - 1643.64] Price Point advantage to try to make
[1640.88 - 1644.84] more money on a product right so if you
[1643.64 - 1646.04] want to start a supplement company
[1644.84 - 1648.44] tomorrow
[1646.04 - 1650.72] and you want to do it you'll go chances
[1648.44 - 1652.58] are you'll get talked in to the lowest
[1650.72 - 1654.20] quality of the quality stuff so you have
[1652.58 - 1656.12] a bigger price point Advantage so you
[1654.20 - 1658.82] can make more money remember she says no
[1656.12 - 1661.58] we won't do that we want the highest we
[1658.82 - 1663.68] can find and I've never seen that before
[1661.58 - 1666.08] the other thing third party third party
[1663.68 - 1668.72] independently test it boom
[1666.08 - 1672.40] and the other thing no alcohol no citric
[1668.72 - 1675.02] acid no soy no gluten no
[1672.40 - 1677.18] maltodextrin no natural flavors no
[1675.02 - 1680.66] artificial flavors the titanium dioxide
[1677.18 - 1683.30] no caffeine no alcohol ever they know
[1680.66 - 1685.94] better no natural flavors they know
[1683.30 - 1687.50] better no citric acid they know better I
[1685.94 - 1689.72] don't even know what to say about that
[1687.50 - 1691.46] besides that's mind-blowing to me
[1689.72 - 1693.80] and supplement companies have their own
[1691.46 - 1696.14] free will and they change what they're
[1693.80 - 1698.66] doing they're like oh this this time
[1696.14 - 1701.60] we're gonna change it up you know we
[1698.66 - 1703.82] sold that line of product let's redesign
[1701.60 - 1707.06] you know no one even knows what they do
[1703.82 - 1708.92] they don't disclose things like the
[1707.06 - 1710.42] hidden little percentage in there that
[1708.92 - 1712.34] they're illegal that they're legally
[1710.42 - 1713.96] allowed to not disclose remember she
[1712.34 - 1716.18] says no anyway
[1713.96 - 1719.24] that's why I endorse them
[1716.18 - 1722.30] and I'll endorse them 100 times over
[1719.24 - 1724.10] I I don't even know what to say okay so
[1722.30 - 1725.54] you guys we're doing cold and flu tips
[1724.10 - 1727.28] the whole bit today I just made the
[1725.54 - 1728.66] exposure shot if you just got here if
[1727.28 - 1729.98] you you should watch this from the
[1728.66 - 1733.52] beginning too if you just rolled in
[1729.98 - 1735.44] because we're doing some good stuff and
[1733.52 - 1737.90] what I love about these three is they
[1735.44 - 1739.76] work good together
[1737.90 - 1741.68] so to ask your doctor what's right for
[1739.76 - 1742.76] you right you know because you might be
[1741.68 - 1744.86] doing something entirely different
[1742.76 - 1746.96] whatever it is so to use the stuff ask
[1744.86 - 1750.20] your doc what you feel is right what
[1746.96 - 1753.38] they feel but for immune system helping
[1750.20 - 1755.84] this is what I do for myself I need my
[1753.38 - 1759.74] immune system strong it has to be Rock
[1755.84 - 1762.74] Solid I am up against levels of insanity
[1759.74 - 1764.90] stress I'm up against all kinds of stuff
[1762.74 - 1766.70] I'm battling stuff out there in the
[1764.90 - 1768.92] world like I got all kinds of I don't
[1766.70 - 1771.20] have time to be down I can't just say
[1768.92 - 1774.38] I'm gonna be sick for three weeks with
[1771.20 - 1776.18] the flu and cough in my guts out and I'm
[1774.38 - 1777.68] just gonna have to be just I'm gonna
[1776.18 - 1779.78] have to check out no more podcast
[1777.68 - 1781.70] episodes no more free information no
[1779.78 - 1784.82] more reconstructing the website to give
[1781.70 - 1787.76] people more free stuff it all shuts down
[1784.82 - 1789.98] and no more writing the next book with
[1787.76 - 1791.96] Spirit of compassion I can't have down
[1789.98 - 1794.06] time like I can't
[1791.96 - 1795.80] like I gotta be on and I see people
[1794.06 - 1798.02] they're like they're out there like boom
[1795.80 - 1799.70] boom this person's got this boom coffin
[1798.02 - 1800.90] sneezing this person's got this and I'm
[1799.70 - 1803.18] like oh
[1800.90 - 1807.08] immune system man
[1803.18 - 1810.62] but I can't I can't go down and then be
[1807.08 - 1813.14] in bed for a week and then slow recovery
[1810.62 - 1815.60] where you're like you're you're slow as
[1813.14 - 1817.82] a snail recovery it's hell you know and
[1815.60 - 1820.46] you're like oh I just had the flu beat
[1817.82 - 1822.62] the crap out of me I've been in bed for
[1820.46 - 1824.60] a week I can't really function I could
[1822.62 - 1826.40] just barely just get into my kitchen and
[1824.60 - 1829.04] take care of myself I'm dizzy I don't
[1826.40 - 1830.30] feel good I had a fever for three days I
[1829.04 - 1833.18] can't do that
[1830.30 - 1836.78] I gotta be like and I'm not gonna take
[1833.18 - 1838.88] no no like health professional coach's
[1836.78 - 1841.52] advice and say that germs will make me
[1838.88 - 1843.02] stronger and I should get exposure well
[1841.52 - 1844.58] that's the last thing I want I don't
[1843.02 - 1846.32] want to get exposure right now unless I
[1844.58 - 1847.70] have no choice and I'm with family or
[1846.32 - 1849.26] I'm with friends and they all they're
[1847.70 - 1851.48] sneezing or something or somebody's
[1849.26 - 1855.44] coughing and then then it's like ooh
[1851.48 - 1858.20] yeah I'm doing this I'm doing this you
[1855.44 - 1861.08] know so anyway this is the liquid zinc
[1858.20 - 1862.52] sulfate and you'll notice out there
[1861.08 - 1864.26] that
[1862.52 - 1866.42] you'll see it out there influencers be
[1864.26 - 1867.92] like yeah it's the liquid zinc sulfate
[1866.42 - 1870.32] and I'm like oh yeah but you don't know
[1867.92 - 1872.48] the right one the one that you can trust
[1870.32 - 1874.72] that isn't gonna have anything hidden in
[1872.48 - 1877.22] there anyway
[1874.72 - 1879.08] Erica says without beverages supplements
[1877.22 - 1881.00] I wouldn't have been able to heal the
[1879.08 - 1882.80] way I have I completely understand
[1881.00 - 1885.32] without memory supplements I couldn't
[1882.80 - 1887.18] keep myself as strong as I've been to to
[1885.32 - 1889.70] fight the battles for the chronically
[1887.18 - 1891.86] ill to be a voice for The Chronic Leo to
[1889.70 - 1894.68] help The Chronic Leo like I do Monica
[1891.86 - 1897.38] says memory amazing products
[1894.68 - 1900.26] but I I share the same same feeling
[1897.38 - 1902.96] without a doubt you know so all that
[1900.26 - 1904.76] matters it's like everything like all
[1902.96 - 1906.20] these little details matter if we're
[1904.76 - 1907.76] trying to take care of ourselves Tara
[1906.20 - 1909.74] Appleman good to see you remember she
[1907.76 - 1912.14] has the highest Integrity they really do
[1909.74 - 1914.24] it doesn't exist out there otherwise I
[1912.14 - 1916.76] haven't seen it I'm not just saying that
[1914.24 - 1919.34] I know this as a fact
[1916.76 - 1922.22] I really do the progress I like it's
[1919.34 - 1924.26] consistently contains over 50 percent of
[1922.22 - 1927.08] the polyphenols which is incredible so
[1924.26 - 1930.02] that's one of the differences right
[1927.08 - 1931.46] there that like they can hang their hat
[1930.02 - 1934.64] on
[1931.46 - 1938.72] like the propolis literally contains
[1934.64 - 1940.10] over 50 of active polytheanols they can
[1938.72 - 1942.50] hang their hat on that with that because
[1940.10 - 1945.94] that's incredible
[1942.50 - 1948.56] and it it matters which is amazing right
[1945.94 - 1951.38] and I don't personally like taking Dead
[1948.56 - 1952.94] quercetin Like Me personally I don't
[1951.38 - 1954.50] like taking course within that's a dead
[1952.94 - 1957.92] course at him right the polytheon of
[1954.50 - 1959.54] course did I like knowing it's active in
[1957.92 - 1961.16] like the propolis right here and I got
[1959.54 - 1962.38] to show you the stuff it's like it's
[1961.16 - 1966.86] like just
[1962.38 - 1966.86] Liquid Gold insane
[1967.04 - 1972.80] so why am I even doing this today
[1968.96 - 1975.38] because all I see out there is everybody
[1972.80 - 1977.90] coughing and sneezing and coughing and
[1975.38 - 1978.98] sneezing and that's why and it's just
[1977.90 - 1981.68] like
[1978.98 - 1983.18] and I and I feel bad it's like I feel
[1981.68 - 1984.98] bad for people that are getting knocked
[1983.18 - 1986.90] down by the flu and they're sick for two
[1984.98 - 1989.66] weeks a week three weeks six months
[1986.90 - 1991.64] because it just it it lowered their
[1989.66 - 1993.38] immune system then the Ebbs and
[1991.64 - 1994.94] everything came up and then they're
[1993.38 - 1996.02] having it really hard like that breaks
[1994.94 - 1998.24] my heart
[1996.02 - 2001.12] because I know that so many people have
[1998.24 - 2003.04] it so hard already
[2001.12 - 2004.24] you know so I just feel bad that's
[2003.04 - 2005.20] that's the bottom line check this out
[2004.24 - 2007.24] though
[2005.20 - 2008.14] I want to show you how incredible this
[2007.24 - 2011.14] is
[2008.14 - 2012.40] The Taste the difference is unreal with
[2011.14 - 2015.28] the propolis
[2012.40 - 2017.62] from very G it doesn't have alcohol in
[2015.28 - 2019.12] it even non-alcohol provolift is out
[2017.62 - 2021.04] there I can't trust because they have
[2019.12 - 2023.56] some form of alcohol they have some type
[2021.04 - 2025.78] of poly you know uh some different type
[2023.56 - 2027.70] of ethanol or alcohol of some kind and
[2025.78 - 2029.62] you can you that's what it tastes like
[2027.70 - 2032.32] this doesn't

[2032.32 - 2038.80] don't have this this Bernie alcohol
[2035.68 - 2040.60] thing that goes down feels like it burns
[2038.80 - 2042.34] a hole in the stomach feels like it
[2040.60 - 2044.32] burns a hole in your liver you don't get
[2042.34 - 2046.42] that like and that's incredible right
[2044.32 - 2048.10] the stuff is just like liquid gold check

[2155.86 - 2159.46] difference in the world the caffeine
[2157.96 - 2161.80] thing though I'm of a little kind of
[2159.46 - 2163.18] like I'm imagining where I don't think
[2161.80 - 2164.86] that makes a difference in the world it
[2163.18 - 2165.94] gets everybody addicted whatever but the
[2164.86 - 2168.40] point is

[2168.40 - 2171.58] caffeine anyway be on the best one right
[2170.02 - 2172.78] if you're going to be on it and no one
[2171.58 - 2174.16] can tell you different then be on the
[2172.78 - 2176.02] best one but either way you know how
[2174.16 - 2177.58] there's people out there the guy run
[2176.02 - 2181.96] into and people reach out to me and
[2177.58 - 2184.72] they're like aw I want to I want to make
[2181.96 - 2187.54] the best baby strollers ever were the
[2184.72 - 2189.34] wheels on the baby strollers
[2187.54 - 2191.56] they don't do this thing because there's
[2189.34 - 2194.14] bearings so you see moms of their baby
[2191.56 - 2196.00] strollers right well there's wheels on
[2194.14 - 2197.44] those strollers obviously and moms like
[2196.00 - 2200.56] they like to push their babies along
[2197.44 - 2202.90] with jog or or you know exercise
[2200.56 - 2204.16] and so companies out there be like I
[2202.90 - 2205.54] want to do something good in the world I
[2204.16 - 2207.04] want to make sure the wheels on the baby
[2205.54 - 2208.66] strollers give the baby the best ride
[2207.04 - 2211.00] ever so the baby's not bouncing around
[2208.66 - 2213.10] as the mom's pushing the stroller
[2211.00 - 2215.50] there's so many people out there that
[2213.10 - 2218.10] just that just they want to do good
[2215.50 - 2218.10] things right
[2219.16 - 2222.34] well
[2220.30 - 2225.46] I want the best propolis that's ever
[2222.34 - 2228.10] been out there anywhere here so when
[2225.46 - 2230.20] someone actually needs that best
[2228.10 - 2233.08] propolis that doesn't exist out there in
[2230.20 - 2235.24] the world and vimergy can create it I
[2233.08 - 2238.06] want that and that feels good to me
[2235.24 - 2239.68] to me that feels good to me you know
[2238.06 - 2241.72] it's it's those kinds of things I want
[2239.68 - 2243.88] the best zinc there ever was and I want
[2241.72 - 2245.92] the best vitamin C there ever was and
[2243.88 - 2248.80] these are the things right there that
[2245.92 - 2250.18] matter to me you know it's like you know
[2248.80 - 2252.16] because everybody wants to do something
[2250.18 - 2255.40] good you know
[2252.16 - 2258.10] anyway so all right look
[2255.40 - 2259.36] so I just put the the propolis in here
[2258.10 - 2260.68] so I showed you it's got the golden
[2259.36 - 2262.90] color and everything so now I'm going to
[2260.68 - 2264.52] do the zinc right here too and I can put
[2262.90 - 2266.08] the zinc
[2264.52 - 2267.88] I'm gonna put a little water in this
[2266.08 - 2270.28] shot with another shot that I have so I
[2267.88 - 2272.26] got some water in here with the propolis
[2270.28 - 2273.46] okay and I'm going to put some zinc in
[2272.26 - 2275.26] there too
[2273.46 - 2277.42] so
[2275.26 - 2279.94] things with zinc is when you when you
[2277.42 - 2282.16] hear the word zinc think immune system
[2279.94 - 2284.26] right so I talk to people and it's like
[2282.16 - 2286.06] you hear the word zinc you you think of
[2284.26 - 2287.62] Yoon system
[2286.06 - 2289.12] that's what I tell people they're like
[2287.62 - 2291.46] zinc what do you do with zinc on my
[2289.12 - 2293.62] immune system like whoa and you just you
[2291.46 - 2297.34] you have that the reason why I'm saying
[2293.62 - 2299.20] that is because every time your mind
[2297.34 - 2303.00] your consciousness
[2299.20 - 2303.00] sees z-i-n-c
[2304.12 - 2309.94] okay every time your Consciousness sees
[2306.88 - 2312.70] that z-i-n-c that's zinc
[2309.94 - 2315.76] okay something starts Computing in here
[2312.70 - 2319.20] right in the neurons in your brain
[2315.76 - 2319.20] so I like to do this
[2320.50 - 2325.36] because zinc is good for the immune
[2322.72 - 2327.10] system that means your immune cells what
[2325.36 - 2330.04] I do is I Envision my immune cells
[2327.10 - 2333.52] gobbling up all that zinc
[2330.04 - 2335.32] and then every time I even see zinc I
[2333.52 - 2337.18] want my immune cells already getting
[2335.32 - 2338.98] hungry
[2337.18 - 2341.68] to receive it
[2338.98 - 2343.12] I want that correlation I want that
[2341.68 - 2345.04] connection right there and you guys know
[2343.12 - 2346.78] I do the continuity thing right I'll do
[2345.04 - 2348.58] a whole thing on that eventually too I
[2346.78 - 2350.20] got other stuff I just got to talk about
[2348.58 - 2353.08] so much
[2350.20 - 2356.86] but I want that register right there
[2353.08 - 2357.82] because you get your immune cells hungry
[2356.86 - 2359.74] right
[2357.82 - 2361.48] it's like you're getting hungry for your
[2359.74 - 2362.92] meal so say you're eating three meals a
[2361.48 - 2364.30] day two meals a day whatever you do
[2362.92 - 2366.58] maybe you're in your mid fast and you're
[2364.30 - 2369.28] doing one meal a day whatever it is your
[2366.58 - 2371.92] juices your gastric juices they start to
[2369.28 - 2374.62] get hungry if someone says food you're
[2371.92 - 2376.84] just like yeah I'm hungry someone says
[2374.62 - 2378.76] food your mouth starts drooling someone
[2376.84 - 2382.44] shows you a slice of pizza and your
[2378.76 - 2382.44] mouth is starting to drool right
[2383.32 - 2387.00] someone says zinc
[2387.40 - 2392.32] and you really put that connection and
[2389.92 - 2393.88] you're taking the highest quality zinc I
[2392.32 - 2395.62] feel my opinion is the highest quality
[2393.88 - 2397.54] zinc there is and you're taking that
[2395.62 - 2399.64] high quality zinc your immune cells are
[2397.54 - 2402.76] gobbling up and eating that high quality
[2399.64 - 2405.52] zinc think about that
[2402.76 - 2408.10] so all someone has to do is say zinc or
[2405.52 - 2410.44] you see zinc and your immune cells they
[2408.10 - 2412.84] want to do good things your immune cells
[2410.44 - 2416.80] want you gobble up that zinc your immune
[2412.84 - 2419.80] cells want to do good things right
[2416.80 - 2422.26] so I like making that connection
[2419.80 - 2424.78] because that matters that matters to me
[2422.26 - 2426.52] Spirit of compassion always told me that
[2424.78 - 2428.98] when you're giving yourself something
[2426.52 - 2431.38] like a high quality zinc
[2428.98 - 2433.12] and your immune cells are using that
[2431.38 - 2435.28] high quality zinc
[2433.12 - 2438.28] to battle
[2435.28 - 2438.28] exposures
[2439.66 - 2443.74] what happens is there's this connection
[2441.34 - 2445.30] that actually is made between your
[2443.74 - 2448.00] central nervous system your brain your
[2445.30 - 2450.04] neurons to your immune cells your immune
[2448.00 - 2452.38] system your bones everything in your
[2450.04 - 2454.98] body and so it's like whoa I'm getting
[2452.38 - 2457.96] my zinc out I see the label I see
[2454.98 - 2459.64] z-i-n-c I'm taking it out right here I
[2457.96 - 2461.98] just put it in here and already my
[2459.64 - 2463.36] immune system is saying give me that
[2461.98 - 2467.14] zinc
[2463.36 - 2470.28] because I'm ready for it
[2467.14 - 2470.28] it's really cool
[2470.56 - 2475.06] it's actually really powerful Cool's not
[2473.26 - 2477.82] the word for it it's actually really
[2475.06 - 2480.04] really powerful all right
[2477.82 - 2483.40] so I just made myself a propolis shot
[2480.04 - 2484.96] and a sync shot I put them both together
[2483.40 - 2488.26] that's what I like to do ask your doctor
[2484.96 - 2491.32] what's fine you know what you can do
[2488.26 - 2493.36] but that's what I do
[2491.32 - 2495.94] okay I'm gonna put my brain away over
[2493.36 - 2498.16] here you guys
[2495.94 - 2499.54] all right so I want to talk about a
[2498.16 - 2501.70] couple of things I want to talk about

[2777.88 - 2782.34] medical medium time T shock therapy
[2782.98 - 2785.88] you know what's crazy
[2786.10 - 2790.60] because time existed before medical
[2789.40 - 2792.40] medium
[2790.60 - 2794.92] talked about
[2792.40 - 2797.20] to time shock therapy
[2794.92 - 2799.54] it discounts it as if it's not a tool or
[2797.20 - 2802.36] something right it's like oh no no time
[2799.54 - 2805.18] existed before him
[2802.36 - 2809.08] but did medical medium time shock
[2805.18 - 2811.48] therapy T exist before
[2809.08 - 2814.00] because I want to know
[2811.48 - 2815.68] truth is it didn't
[2814.00 - 2818.02] the reason why I say this it's an
[2815.68 - 2819.88] incredible powerful tool don't get
[2818.02 - 2823.36] thrown off when someone says oh he knows
[2819.88 - 2828.22] nothing about time T time has been
[2823.36 - 2829.96] around for years the Romans used time
[2828.22 - 2832.78] so he doesn't he's not bringing anything
[2829.96 - 2834.94] new right uh really
[2832.78 - 2837.16] because this is an incredible therapy
[2834.94 - 2840.70] right here so this shock therapy is
[2837.16 - 2842.68] amazing every three waking hours
[2840.70 - 2845.62] right
[2842.68 - 2848.02] 12 Sprigs
[2845.62 - 2851.86] no one knew how to use time like this
[2848.02 - 2854.74] for cold and flu cold flu RSV
[2851.86 - 2857.02] nobody knew how to use time like this so
[2854.74 - 2858.76] it's okay I get it you know that time
[2857.02 - 2860.68] exists you see it in the grocery store
[2858.76 - 2862.60] so then you discredit medical medium
[2860.68 - 2864.22] really quick and say oh yeah I saw a
[2862.60 - 2865.72] post from an influencer out there that
[2864.22 - 2867.52] said medical medium doesn't know
[2865.72 - 2869.92] anything because he didn't invent for
[2867.52 - 2871.42] invent fruits and vegetables and herbs
[2869.92 - 2873.46] and stuff
[2871.42 - 2875.50] meanwhile
[2873.46 - 2878.56] sort of compassion and a messaging the
[2875.50 - 2882.10] information has invented or created
[2878.56 - 2883.36] incredible combinations and tools and
[2882.10 - 2885.94] information
[2883.36 - 2887.50] that is unique and original
[2885.94 - 2890.74] it doesn't matter if time has been
[2887.50 - 2892.90] growing in Italy for 2000 years
[2890.74 - 2895.06] it doesn't mean they used
[2892.90 - 2896.56] the time T shock therapy for cold and
[2895.06 - 2899.68] fluent to what we're dealing with now
[2896.56 - 2902.92] and it's how you're applying them and
[2899.68 - 2905.26] for what if that's all unique and so

[3221.40 - 3226.08] can use it more efficiently the sun has
[3224.04 - 3230.30] been around for millions of years too
[3226.08 - 3230.30] solar panels not so long
[3230.52 - 3235.62] spot on
[3232.20 - 3238.08] very very spot on
[3235.62 - 3240.72] okay as Darkness tries to destroy all
[3238.08 - 3241.98] that's good because that's what Darkness
[3240.72 - 3244.80] does out there
[3241.98 - 3246.36] okay I'm reading just reading some
[3244.80 - 3248.40] comments see you guys
[3246.36 - 3251.28] nature heal says one of my clients
[3248.40 - 3253.56] couldn't get rid of her cough I told her
[3251.28 - 3256.68] about time medical medium information
[3253.56 - 3259.50] and she went out that day and texted me
[3256.68 - 3262.50] that her cough was gone in a day
[3259.50 - 3264.24] and that information did not exist in
[3262.50 - 3265.86] the health Realm
[3264.24 - 3268.50] so I love what people are doing now
[3265.86 - 3270.42] they're taking like an aloe leaf
[3268.50 - 3272.28] and they're saying medical medium didn't
[3270.42 - 3273.54] grow an aloe leaf for the first time on
[3272.28 - 3275.94] this planet
[3273.54 - 3277.32] it's ancient medicine well then how come
[3275.94 - 3278.58] ancient medicine didn't know what to do
[3277.32 - 3280.32] with it
[3278.58 - 3282.18] how come ancient medicine doesn't know
[3280.32 - 3284.46] what to do with time in the way that
[3282.18 - 3286.08] Spirit of compassion has brought to us I
[3284.46 - 3286.98] don't understand what people want from
[3286.08 - 3289.68] me
[3286.98 - 3292.20] it's Unique these are protocols that are
[3289.68 - 3294.30] unique therapies that are unique and
[3292.20 - 3296.70] they're helping people
[3294.30 - 3298.92] nobody knew about them all in the last
[3296.70 - 3301.14] 20 30 years or whatever
[3298.92 - 3303.36] whoops
[3301.14 - 3305.46] as Darkness tries to destroy all that's
[3303.36 - 3308.52] good we Rise Against Darkness using
[3305.46 - 3312.00] light-created health weapons to regain
[3308.52 - 3315.84] empowerment you put alcohol in this and
[3312.00 - 3318.00] you just you just destroyed the light
[3315.84 - 3319.68] you put all the tincture companies out
[3318.00 - 3321.42] there you want to put alcohol in all
[3319.68 - 3323.72] your supplements then you're destroying
[3321.42 - 3323.72] the light
[3323.94 - 3327.18] you want to put citric acid in all your
[3325.92 - 3328.50] supplements you're destroying the light
[3327.18 - 3329.76] you want to put natural flavors in all
[3328.50 - 3331.62] your supplements you're destroying the
[3329.76 - 3333.90] light
[3331.62 - 3336.36] the greatest stuff on the planet right
[3333.90 - 3338.46] now in my opinion by far is is the
[3336.36 - 3340.32] Bemidji line
[3338.46 - 3342.36] you don't think I can't create my own
[3340.32 - 3346.02] line of supplements
[3342.36 - 3348.12] and call it medical medium
[3346.02 - 3350.94] I mean people are like it's unbelievable

[3350.94 - 3354.24] the greatest stuff there is that's out

[3363.00 - 3365.48] book for free
[3366.54 - 3371.04] okay as Darkness tries to destroy all
[3369.48 - 3372.18] that's good we rise above the darkness
[3371.04 - 3373.26] and I say that over and over again
[3372.18 - 3376.50] because I'll tell you why because
[3373.26 - 3379.62] there's good things that we have at our
[3376.50 - 3380.76] fingertips and I see how it works out
[3379.62 - 3382.32] there

[3393.24 - 3395.66] for everybody

[3401.76 - 3406.26] stress Upon Us humankind goes into a
[3404.22 - 3408.42] deeper Health deficit than during
[3406.26 - 3410.40] previous decades I can tell you this
[3408.42 - 3412.62] that the health and wellness of people

[3416.28 - 3420.36] conventional medicine there's more sick
[3418.20 - 3422.40] people now today than there ever was 10
[3420.36 - 3424.62] years ago more sick people now today
[3422.40 - 3428.10] than there ever was 20 years ago I can
[3424.62 - 3432.84] definitely say that 100 true
[3428.10 - 3436.68] and it's not my truth it's the truth
[3432.84 - 3439.44] Lila Collins says unbelievable amount of
[3436.68 - 3441.12] stolen information from mm I totally get
[3439.44 - 3442.92] his frustration because they're
[3441.12 - 3445.02] spreading half truths
[3442.92 - 3447.72] they are stealing so much medical medium
[3445.02 - 3449.82] info between influencers that don't care
[3447.72 - 3451.80] about People's Health between other
[3449.82 - 3453.30] health people between all that other
[3451.80 - 3456.24] stuff out there and conventional
[3453.30 - 3458.16] medicine it's just a poached their
[3456.24 - 3461.10] basically rating it
[3458.16 - 3463.14] they're taking they're poaching they're
[3461.10 - 3465.48] raping the information and that's what
[3463.14 - 3467.40] they do and then they mix it up with a
[3465.48 - 3468.90] bunch of crap that doesn't work someone
[3467.40 - 3471.12] can kind of hang in there because they
[3468.90 - 3473.28] get one of the tools by accident it's
[3471.12 - 3474.84] not cited back to mm and then they're
[3473.28 - 3476.82] kind of hanging in there but it's not
[3474.84 - 3479.16] good because it's really really sad
[3476.82 - 3481.68] house of Liz says thank you for calling

[3508.38 - 3513.96] Industries are playing dirty against
[3510.18 - 3515.70] humankind so here's what it is MM info
[3513.96 - 3518.10] medical medium shock therapies are here
[3515.70 - 3520.26] to level the playing field that is why
[3518.10 - 3522.30] they were created by SOC that's why

[3522.30 - 3527.78] that's why they're available
[3524.70 - 3527.78] for free
[3530.22 - 3534.86] get the information
[3532.14 - 3534.86] it's free
[3534.90 - 3540.38] so anyway let me make some vitamin C
[3537.42 - 3540.38] shock therapy
[3543.48 - 3549.30] and some fun sorry about the
[3546.36 - 3551.64] tangent about the germs build your build
[3549.30 - 3553.98] you and make you stronger they don't we
[3551.64 - 3555.66] have to get stronger to beat down and
[3553.98 - 3557.76] Crush germs
[3555.66 - 3561.08] that's how it works all right let's do
[3557.76 - 3561.08] this now you guys
[3561.72 - 3568.40] here we are
[3564.18 - 3568.40] so I'm going to take this right here
[3568.64 - 3574.74] okay I think my time T is coming along
[3572.28 - 3577.46] quite well
[3574.74 - 3577.46] so good
[3577.86 - 3582.24] time T shock therapy right there's more
[3580.08 - 3584.76] details in the book about it you can use
[3582.24 - 3586.50] dry time if you really had to you can
[3584.76 - 3588.24] use fresh thyme it's in the book I was
[3586.50 - 3590.94] just reading from so there's more
[3588.24 - 3591.96] information in brand saver protocols all
[3590.94 - 3597.02] right
[3591.96 - 3597.02] so let me get some water in here
[3598.56 - 3602.12] some vitamin C shock therapy
[3606.06 - 3611.76] okay so what I do is
[3609.54 - 3614.64] take two capsules
[3611.76 - 3616.14] this is the micro C
[3614.64 - 3619.32] so what I recommend this to a family
[3616.14 - 3621.12] member or a friend I'm not worried about
[3619.32 - 3622.86] their stomach
[3621.12 - 3624.12] and that's that's what I do ask your
[3622.86 - 3625.50] doctor was right for you but when I
[3624.12 - 3627.36] recommend this I'm not worried because
[3625.50 - 3629.22] it's so buffered it's not straight
[3627.36 - 3631.26] ascorbic acid
[3629.22 - 3633.48] so it's not just straight ascorbic acid
[3631.26 - 3636.36] that's important to know
[3633.48 - 3640.74] and it makes it so it can be used as a
[3636.36 - 3644.10] really good tool these Details Matter I
[3640.74 - 3645.48] can't even say it enough right
[3644.10 - 3646.98] but I get it you know people on the
[3645.48 - 3648.42] internet though all you have to do is
[3646.98 - 3650.72] shout out one thing and everybody's like
[3648.42 - 3650.72] oh
[3651.24 - 3655.68] vimergy never uses tablets because they
[3653.46 - 3658.08] don't want all those fillers they want
[3655.68 - 3660.60] they don't want the glazes they don't
[3658.08 - 3662.40] use tablets they don't want titanium
[3660.60 - 3663.72] dioxide they don't want colors they
[3662.40 - 3665.70] don't want glazes they don't want
[3663.72 - 3667.68] fillers and that's the difference so
[3665.70 - 3669.66] what you're noticing is you're noticing
[3667.68 - 3672.42] a capsule so that's what I took out of
[3669.66 - 3676.14] here and that's what I opened right
[3672.42 - 3677.70] so I have the two capsules in there now
[3676.14 - 3679.80] and then I'm going to put a little bit
[3677.70 - 3682.52] of honey in there too
[3679.80 - 3682.52] like this
[3682.62 - 3685.80] I'm gonna put a little bit more in there
[3684.18 - 3687.24] if you want a little bit more you can
[3685.80 - 3690.48] put a little bit less in there if you
[3687.24 - 3692.82] want to now I'm going to cut an orange
[3690.48 - 3694.68] right here
[3692.82 - 3697.62] and I'm going to squeeze some orange in
[3694.68 - 3700.32] there it's a nice orange too
[3697.62 - 3702.60] now two teaspoons is what I did
[3700.32 - 3704.28] two teaspoons of raw honey
[3702.60 - 3705.54] if you go a little bit over two
[3704.28 - 3706.98] teaspoons is what I was trying to say
[3705.54 - 3709.92] that's okay if you go a little bit under
[3706.98 - 3712.08] that's okay right so I did two teaspoons
[3709.92 - 3714.48] of raw honey and then I did Squeeze I
[3712.08 - 3715.86] squeezed juice from an orange in here so
[3714.48 - 3717.84] you can see
[3715.86 - 3719.70] there you go you can use this is a very
[3717.84 - 3721.74] big orange I'm squeezing juice from a
[3719.70 - 3724.58] half an orange right here there we go
[3721.74 - 3724.58] amazing
[3725.82 - 3731.06] now I'm going to mix this
[3727.92 - 3731.06] you guys don't mind
[3732.54 - 3737.00] maybe we can get a close-up on this one
[3734.10 - 3737.00] too this is really cool
[3737.58 - 3743.06] so we got a little close up there it is
[3740.28 - 3743.06] right there
[3743.22 - 3746.78] and I shall sip it
[3747.00 - 3751.62] amazing
[3749.10 - 3753.84] I love it
[3751.62 - 3756.00] when I tell family and friends you feel
[3753.84 - 3759.08] like you got a bug coming on you feel
[3756.00 - 3759.08] like you got something coming on
[3766.50 - 3772.56] make sure you got that going on
[3770.10 - 3773.94] it's so great okay
[3772.56 - 3775.98] so
[3773.94 - 3778.80] I love the shock therapies I'm just
[3775.98 - 3780.54] looking through them now
[3778.80 - 3783.06] what you'll notice in the shock
[3780.54 - 3785.52] therapies too
[3783.06 - 3787.74] you'll see different ages in here but
[3785.52 - 3790.02] bring it to your pediatrician

[3792.06 - 3794.54] okay
[3794.82 - 3797.82] amazing
[3798.54 - 3803.34] yep
[3800.70 - 3806.46] okay time contains a phytochemical
[3803.34 - 3808.74] compound that is antiviral antibacterial
[3806.46 - 3811.14] anti-mold
[3808.74 - 3814.74] anti yeast
[3811.14 - 3816.78] and anti-unproductive fungus
[3814.74 - 3818.94] that stays circulating inside the
[3816.78 - 3821.52] bloodstream long after nutrients from
[3818.94 - 3823.86] other foods have either been utilized
[3821.52 - 3825.30] dissipated or eliminated out of the body
[3823.86 - 3828.12] so I want to show you this piece of
[3825.30 - 3830.22] information it's critical
[3828.12 - 3832.02] that's from above there is no science
[3830.22 - 3833.58] research that knows what time does in
[3832.02 - 3835.98] the body besides research doesn't know
[3833.58 - 3839.70] what other things do in the body
[3835.98 - 3843.12] this is information from above that time
[3839.70 - 3846.12] stays circulating in the bloodstream
[3843.12 - 3848.40] long after nutrients from other foods
[3846.12 - 3849.90] have either been utilized or dissipated
[3848.40 - 3852.24] that's an incredible piece of
[3849.90 - 3855.24] information right there
[3852.24 - 3856.56] to teach us in and arm us for our immune
[3855.24 - 3858.30] system health
[3856.56 - 3860.04] that's not known out there in the world
[3858.30 - 3862.38] sure it'll be poached and someone will
[3860.04 - 3864.54] talk about it any day now right
[3862.38 - 3866.64] and not cite back where it comes from
[3864.54 - 3868.26] but it's an important piece of
[3866.64 - 3870.96] information
[3868.26 - 3872.37] so this is a phytochemical compound
[3870.96 - 3873.48] inside the time
[3872.37 - 3876.48] [Music]
[3873.48 - 3879.18] that actually stays in the bloodstream
[3876.48 - 3881.04] fighting crime
[3879.18 - 3884.22] time lingers
[3881.04 - 3888.66] ready creating a Time released
[3884.22 - 3888.66] protective barrier against pathogens
[3888.96 - 3894.06] the time has an ability to release a
[3891.42 - 3897.12] protective barrier
[3894.06 - 3899.58] times phytochemical compounds enter
[3897.12 - 3901.98] every organ inside the body not every
[3899.58 - 3904.92] phytochemical compound you guys reaches
[3901.98 - 3906.96] every organ inside our body
[3904.92 - 3908.58] that's the difference right there all on
[3906.96 - 3911.34] its own
[3908.58 - 3914.28] ready times phytochemical compounds
[3911.34 - 3916.68] enter every organ inside the body versus
[3914.28 - 3918.60] other herbs that only enter certain
[3916.68 - 3920.70] organs in the body so think about this
[3918.60 - 3924.24] for a second
[3920.70 - 3926.76] time enters every single part of your
[3924.24 - 3929.46] body there's no place it doesn't enter
[3926.76 - 3931.82] from the skin to every single organ you

[3931.86 - 3935.42] other incredible herbs
[3936.90 - 3942.56] only reach certain organs depending on

[4084.02 - 4089.12] water like I did you guys if you only
[4086.60 - 4091.94] have access to dry time use two
[4089.12 - 4094.10] tablespoons of dried herb per cup of hot
[4091.94 - 4096.68] water let's steep for at least 15
[4094.10 - 4098.78] minutes remove the thyme sprigs or
[4096.68 - 4101.12] strain the tea especially if you're
[4098.78 - 4104.66] using dried thyme so if you're using dry
[4101.12 - 4107.00] thyme strain it is what I would do fresh
[4104.66 - 4109.04] thyme you can just literally sip out of
[4107.00 - 4110.90] here like this
[4109.04 - 4113.36] but if sprig of time might go up your

[4248.54 - 4251.54] to try to knock down medical medium
[4249.80 - 4253.58] credibility they'll say
[4251.54 - 4255.14] I did medical medium to the letter and

[4368.60 - 4374.48] read medical medium
[4371.12 - 4377.30] book one revised and expanded so you can
[4374.48 - 4381.14] read where I don't talk to a ghost thank
[4377.30 - 4383.00] you so get this book when you can right
[4381.14 - 4384.26] it's got some Origins about medical
[4383.00 - 4386.92] medium
[4384.26 - 4386.92] foreign
[4388.78 - 4395.84] okay oh Aubry Audrey says be happy with
[4393.68 - 4398.36] the people who are following you dot dot
[4395.84 - 4400.10] you have thousands and thousands not
[4398.36 - 4402.50] everyone is going to listen to you dot
[4400.10 - 4404.96] dot dot but when someone is someone new
[4402.50 - 4407.60] finding you they get kind of turned off
[4404.96 - 4410.48] with the whining about who's not giving
[4407.60 - 4413.06] you credit I love what I've learned from
[4410.48 - 4416.36] you but when I try to turn others onto
[4413.06 - 4419.60] you that's the feedback I get of why
[4416.36 - 4421.28] they don't want to follow like I do just
[4419.60 - 4423.02] passing that on I appreciate you passing
[4421.28 - 4424.82] that on but
[4423.02 - 4426.62] but here's the point that I think you're
[4424.82 - 4429.44] missing okay
[4426.62 - 4431.56] if no one knows where the info comes
[4429.44 - 4431.56] from
[4431.78 - 4435.68] then how are they going to heal
[4434.00 - 4437.50] do you know how many people that are
[4435.68 - 4439.88] bedridden that are on mattress Island
[4437.50 - 4442.16] they can't even function
[4439.88 - 4443.66] and they get lost they'll end up putting
[4442.16 - 4445.52] charcoal they'll dump charcoal in their
[4443.66 - 4447.14] system or tons of sodium bicarbonate and
[4445.52 - 4448.10] now they're in the hospital for the 20th
[4447.14 - 4449.66] time
[4448.10 - 4451.76] do you know how many people like feel
[4449.66 - 4453.62] like there's no hope and they're like
[4451.76 - 4456.32] there's no hope to heal and they've been
[4453.62 - 4458.60] to 10 neurologists and specialists
[4456.32 - 4460.22] I mean do you know how many moms can't
[4458.60 - 4462.68] get out of bed and feed their kids and
[4460.22 - 4464.60] did you know that when they get derailed
[4462.68 - 4467.06] it's another year that their kids are
[4464.60 - 4469.58] not going to see a happy mommy
[4467.06 - 4472.10] did you know that like when a mom gets
[4469.58 - 4473.78] derailed and loses two more years their
[4472.10 - 4475.58] child goes from four years old to six
[4473.78 - 4477.74] years old and in those two years their
[4475.58 - 4479.96] child is between four and six their mom
[4477.74 - 4481.76] was freaking miserable because she was
[4479.96 - 4483.92] sick and went to every doctor Under the
[4481.76 - 4485.08] Sun and then she was tricked by Fork
[4483.92 - 4487.52] tongue out there
[4485.08 - 4490.16] derailing her because they didn't give
[4487.52 - 4491.48] medical medium info credit and cited it
[4490.16 - 4492.86] and cited the medical medium information
[4491.48 - 4494.30] back
[4492.86 - 4496.46] do you know how much Fork tongue out
[4494.30 - 4498.86] there is totally tricking people think
[4496.46 - 4502.46] about it I've seen moms out there where
[4498.86 - 4505.52] their kids were were raised during the
[4502.46 - 4507.56] the most vulnerable years between ages
[4505.52 - 4509.06] like two and ten years old and it took
[4507.56 - 4510.80] eight years for the mom to find medical
[4509.06 - 4512.54] medium info and guess why she didn't
[4510.80 - 4515.96] find it she was derailed over and over
[4512.54 - 4518.30] again told that I was whining about
[4515.96 - 4521.72] getting all the credit
[4518.30 - 4524.24] I'm such a great guy and are told that
[4521.72 - 4526.46] it's all a farce or told that whatever
[4524.24 - 4528.02] but I appreciate that you that you know
[4526.46 - 4529.70] the information and you follow it and
[4528.02 - 4531.38] you listen to it I do Audrey and I
[4529.70 - 4533.90] appreciate that but I'm just trying to
[4531.38 - 4535.88] let you know that
[4533.90 - 4537.74] that and listen I know that you're cute
[4535.88 - 4539.54] I know that if we had a conversation you
[4537.74 - 4540.98] could say a lot more and you can talk to
[4539.54 - 4542.60] me about it and I know that in comments
[4540.98 - 4544.34] just know I have respect for the fact
[4542.60 - 4545.90] that you can only say so much in a
[4544.34 - 4548.60] comments right and I'm reading that
[4545.90 - 4550.46] comment so I respect that
[4548.60 - 4551.84] right but if you can't listen to the
[4550.46 - 4553.82] telegram messages I've been leaving
[4551.84 - 4556.12] about this kind of thing I left two last
[4553.82 - 4556.12] night
[4556.52 - 4561.68] I think the hardest hardest part too is
[4559.46 - 4563.66] like when a mom's driving home from the
[4561.68 - 4565.22] doctor's office with her teenager their
[4563.66 - 4568.10] teenage son
[4565.22 - 4570.14] or teenage daughter and the doctor said
[4568.10 - 4571.82] that you have autoimmune and the
[4570.14 - 4574.70] teenager
[4571.82 - 4576.68] is in the car with their phone
[4574.70 - 4578.54] and they're looking up and they're
[4576.68 - 4579.62] looking up autoimmune right so they got
[4578.54 - 4581.78] their phone and they're looking up
[4579.62 - 4583.52] autoimmune and they're in the car and
[4581.78 - 4585.56] they're like mommy it says here that my
[4583.52 - 4587.12] body is destroying itself it's attacking
[4585.56 - 4589.40] itself
[4587.12 - 4591.68] how am I going to heal I heard this so
[4589.40 - 4593.96] much kids telling their moms moms have
[4591.68 - 4596.60] told me this the moms are like I don't
[4593.96 - 4598.46] know sweetie I don't know why your your
[4596.60 - 4600.08] body is destroying itself and that's
[4598.46 - 4602.06] what they lead the doctor's office is
[4600.08 - 4603.68] hearing that their immune systems are
[4602.06 - 4605.96] attacking itself that's one of the
[4603.68 - 4607.76] reasons why it's critical to get people
[4605.96 - 4609.26] to know where the information comes from
[4607.76 - 4612.32] to help Free People of that
[4609.26 - 4613.94] misinformation so it all counts
[4612.32 - 4615.74] it just does
[4613.94 - 4618.62] if I don't whine
[4615.74 - 4620.30] and moan and groan about it how am I
[4618.62 - 4622.28] going to protect the chronically ill and
[4620.30 - 4625.04] the information at hand
[4622.28 - 4626.84] so that people have a Fighting Chance
[4625.04 - 4628.22] and I get it there's a few different
[4626.84 - 4629.84] types of people that come to Medical
[4628.22 - 4631.64] medium some people they're not sick
[4629.84 - 4634.58] they're just partially
[4631.64 - 4636.68] sick a little bit and they get annoyed
[4634.58 - 4638.18] because they're still able to play those
[4636.68 - 4639.50] reindeer games out there and try
[4638.18 - 4640.70] different things everywhere but if
[4639.50 - 4642.80] you're somebody that comes to medical
[4640.70 - 4644.60] medium and you're literally
[4642.80 - 4646.82] on mattress Island and you got nothing
[4644.60 - 4648.50] left in you
[4646.82 - 4652.04] and
[4648.50 - 4653.54] every my whining counts
[4652.04 - 4656.50] does it ever
[4653.54 - 4656.50] anyway you guys
[4657.98 - 4661.58] um but thank you Audrey I do appreciate
[4660.32 - 4664.16] it there's so much Fork tongue out there
[4661.58 - 4666.02] Audrey that's a problem and and there's
[4664.16 - 4668.00] so many hate campaigns against medical
[4666.02 - 4669.62] media and there's so much research
[4668.00 - 4671.72] inside stealing medical media
[4669.62 - 4673.46] information and never crediting and
[4671.72 - 4676.04] still crapping on it where they get it
[4673.46 - 4679.04] from which is me
[4676.04 - 4681.32] you know so
[4679.04 - 4683.24] I have to stay ahead of it all I have to
[4681.32 - 4684.98] protect people as much as I can
[4683.24 - 4687.20] if I don't
[4684.98 - 4689.30] help people
[4687.20 - 4691.70] steer clear from all the traps they can
[4689.30 - 4694.46] lose years
[4691.70 - 4696.50] in their healing process or sick process
[4694.46 - 4699.86] sickening process or healing process
[4696.50 - 4701.72] they can lose years like for real
[4699.86 - 4703.46] I mean you could lose 10 20 years you
[4701.72 - 4704.54] know what I used to say years ago in the
[4703.46 - 4707.06] first book and even before that
[4704.54 - 4708.86] published and also lectured about you
[4707.06 - 4711.02] can lose 10 20 30 years of your life
