completely disconnected from their

143
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,160

159
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,840
don't know their

160
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:17,479
surroundings there was a story out there

161
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,319
some guy just ran through naked through

162
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:22,400
an airport whatever he ended up dying

163
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,400
inside of some kind of jet airplane

164
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,720
engine or something and there's you see

165
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,800
this stuff out there all the time where

166
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,840
they just all of a sudden something like

167
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:35,759
goes on in the brain and boom they're

168
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:37,919
just blasting off so and I'm not talking

169
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,479
about like mind altering drugs and stuff

170
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,800
like that and I'm talking about

171
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:42,400
pharmaceuticals and stuff like that I'm

172
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,680
not talking about I'm talking about

173
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,160
where they're just living their life

174
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,880
everything seems to be going okay and

175
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:52,199
then pop something goes off like pop

176
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:55,120
something just happens

177
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:57,720
internally and they're into a bout of

178
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,039
psychosis now doesn't always happen like

179
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,520
that where you're living your life and

180
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,440
you're going along and everything's fine

181
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:05,080
and everything's Dandy and then boom

182
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:09,280
right it doesn't always do that it also

183
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:11,000
has a slow buildup slow buildup where

184
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,840

feeling no one understands what they

198
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,240
nobody understands what they're going

199
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,440
through and they're seeing their

struggling I got so much going on and

207
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,159
then the OCD can kick in and then back

208
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:58,400
to depression then back to anxiety then

209
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:00,159
it's up it's down and then they're

210
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,159
struggling then they're level just for a

211
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:04,080
little bit and then boom a panic attack

212
00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:05,759
comes and then they're just level a

213
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,879
little bit and then they lose a complete

214
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,479
night's sleep and now they don't even

215
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:12,080

it in the morning because I got a trust

228
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,919

on social media whatever not talking

233
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,600
about that I'm talking about people who

234
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,880
are actually getting four hours of sleep

235
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,320
3 hours of sleep 5 hours of sleep people

236
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,360

239
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,519
and they're stuck with this psychosis

240
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:04,600
they're stuck with

241
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:06,600
Neurosis they get blamed for being

242
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,800
neurotic they get blamed for being extra

243
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,040
sensitive they get called terrible names

244
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,959
they struggle you guys happens all the

245
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,519
time I see it out there so many

246
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,600
emotional struggles you guys know what

247
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:19,320
I'm talking about so much is happening

248
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:21,680
out there okay yeah I got the Whiteboard

249
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:24,600
let's see if I can make a mess on the

250
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,320
Whiteboard let's see if I can if we're

251
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,000
keeping drugs out of the equation to

252
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,320
explain this whole thing whether they're

253
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,880
prescribed Pharmaceutical right or not

254
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,760
the other explanation is developing

255
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,760
illness inside so I wanted to talk about

256
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:39,120
a couple of things people are developing

257
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:41,279
problems inside an illness inside is

258
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,519
developing that's what leads us to so

259
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:49,800
many emotional struggles it's an illness

260
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:52,120
developing in the mind the brain in here

261
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:55,680
okay really in the brain tissue then

262
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:57,440
from there it transfers to the ghost it

263
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,360
transfers to the ghost so I want to just

264
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,079
do a little bit here all right

265
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:05,360
so you got your hopefully you can see

266
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:08,880
this I got new markers okay so you got

267
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,480
your brain right there's your brain your

268
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,560
squiggly

269
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,680
brain all

270
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:18,000
right so that's your

271
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:20,440
brain can you see that all right that's

272
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,399
your physical brain and what happens is

273
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:25,240
we get an illness internally in that

274
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:27,000
physical brain we get an illness

275
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:29,480
developing something's wrong with that

276
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,200
brain something's developing in there

277
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:34,519
okay and as we do that we're now we now

278
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:37,600

279
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:39,600

talk about the different

354
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,720
things

00:13:59,079 --> 00:14:04,040
when we have problems emotionally that

358
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,360
are also problems physically there's an

359
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:09,519
interaction that occurs this is where

360
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:11,480
the lines are so crossed or blurred or

361
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,880
however you want to say it or see it

362
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,920
this is why people struggle forever for

363
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:17,560
years they're like they're working on

364
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,759

366
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:22,519
to these programs here for their mental

367
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,120

here online there you're finding all

383
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:54,040
this information you're like I could

384
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:56,079

385
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,680
getting a little better again I'm I'm

386
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,959
changing my life a little bit I'm

387
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,600
starting to spend more time time quality

388
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:05,160
time with myself I'm doing all this and

389
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:08,480

you got triggered into it all over again

392
00:15:12,199 --> 00:15:16,279
and so what happens is people don't

393
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,639
realize this because something's

394
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:19,639
happening in here

395
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:23,040
physically inside the

396
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:25,320
brain and then we go along and we're

397
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:29,279
trying to remedy it

398
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:31,920
here we're trying to fix the ghost we're

399
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:34,600
trying to fix the soul we're trying to

400
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:38,519
fix our spirit we're trying to fix our

401
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:42,720
emotional aspect of us the ghost that

402
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:45,199
lives in here and they live together see

403
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:48,720
this right here okay I'm putting the

404
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:51,120
ghost in here too right guess that's

405
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,839
what happens and something I want to

406
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,639
bring up which is really really

407
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:58,160
incredible mm information all right when

408
00:15:55,639 --> 00:16:00,959
you go through a trauma or a struggle it

409
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:03,639
could be small to someone large to you

410
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:06,160
or you go through some kind of

411
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:08,920
emotional bad news or you've been

412
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:11,360
betrayed really bad or maybe some abuse

413
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:13,639
happened or whatever it is maybe

414
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,680
psychological warfare maybe psychic

415
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:18,880
attacks whatever it is what happens is

416
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,880
maybe just something occurred like a car

417
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,720
accident maybe it's something like that

418
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:27,600
where it's black and white in the moment

419
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:29,480
what happens is your soul exits your

420
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,399
physical brain

421
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,240
it exits your physical brain that's why

422
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:36,160
you'll hear people say I've talked about

423
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,880
this before where I was looking at

424
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,160
myself why that was happening in that

425
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:44,000
moment I got that bad news and it was

426
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:47,399
like I was out of body I was out of my

427
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,680
body yeah because you

428
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:51,560
were it felt like an out of- body

429
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,480
experience it really did it felt like I

430
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:55,480
was out of body man I was looking down

431
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,040
at myself I was looking at myself I

432
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:59,920
didn't even know where I was who I just

433
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,000
saw myself I was knocked out of myself

434
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,160
because what happened while you were

435
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,679
struggling why that struggle happened

436
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:07,039
why something occurred while you got

437
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:08,799
that bad news while you were traumatized

438
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,640
where you had that betrayal while

439
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,640
something happened to you I hear it when

440
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,000
people cheat on people when

441
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:18,039
relationships it's that moment you find

442
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:22,280
out you've been cheated on it's that

443
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:25,319
moment you found out you were

444
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:28,480
betrayed so many people what happens is

445
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:31,640
instantly in that moment their soul

446
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:34,320
leaves their physical brain it goes boom

447
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:38,840
and it's out of body it's over here on

448
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:41,080
the side it's over here it's over here

449
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:43,799
it's over here it gets knocked out of

450
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:47,160
you your soul gets knocked out of you

451
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:50,640
that's what how how it works bad news

452
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:52,880
boom Oh out of body there's a reason for

453
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,600
that because what happens right here in

454
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,520
your physical brain is stuff starts to

455
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:59,840
heat up and burn up the emotional

456
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,080
centers of the brain bra start to get

457
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,360
heated up and burn up see the emotional

458
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:08,720
centers of the brain right here they

459
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:11,480
start to get heat up and burn up and the

460
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,280
Soul has to leave so you don't get Soul

461
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:15,159
damage severe Soul damage and that's

462
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,159
what happens to so many people they get

463
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:19,120
Soul

464
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:22,440
injuries but they go out of body to try

465
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:25,400
to prevent severe Soul injuries right so

466
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:27,320
their soul the ghost pops right out it

467
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:30,240
gets knocked right

468
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:33,400
out you just found out you got cheated

469
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:36,159
on someone just told a huge lie about

470
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:39,039
you you were

471
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:41,559
betrayed someone abused you out of

472
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:44,159
nowhere maybe it's long-term abuse and

473
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:47,039
you're so allergic you're so allergic to

474
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:49,640
the bad people you're so allergic to the

475
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:51,640
bad situation that literally your soul

476
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:53,159
lives outside of your body and now you

477
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:56,080
got

478
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:58,360
depersonalization that's actually not

479
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,400
necessarily physical anymore you got

480
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:02,240
that dep personalization your soul is

481
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,799
living outside of your body and most

482
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:07,039
people are walking around while their

483
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:09,760
soul is outside of their

484
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:12,080
body and that's the ghost and it sits

485
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:15,120
outside of the

486
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,760
body and say you didn't have a really

487
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,360
difficult situation something didn't

488
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:20,960
really happen that's really grave or bad

489
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,559
didn't get that bad news or that bad

490
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:26,960
betrayal or whatever it is and you're

491
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:29,720
struggling because your brain is dirty

492
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:32,960
it's got junk and garbage in it your

493
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:34,520
brain has got junk and garbage in it

494
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,679
solvents

495
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:38,799
petrochemicals toxic heavy metals so

496
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,320
it's got

497
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:43,559
solvents

498
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,440
chemicals toxic heavy metals in here

499
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:50,080
right I'm putting little markers

500
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:51,919
deposits of toxic heavy metals okay some

501
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,960
solvents in here too let's see what we

502
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:57,559
can do with that maybe we get red for

503
00:19:53,960 --> 00:20:00,440
solvents let's do that solvents are in

504
00:19:57,559 --> 00:20:02,520
here as well we got the red we got the

505
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,280
black right the toxic heavy metals the

506
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:07,280
red the

507
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,280
solvents

508
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:14,200
okay what happens is we got something

509
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:16,559
physical Brewing something physical

510
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,640
wrong we got the anxiety we got the

511
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,200
depression we got the dep

512
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,720
personalization that's physical we got

513
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:24,400
the bipolar we got the Mania we got the

514
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:26,760
OCD we got the ADHD With It All We Got

515
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,559
the brain severe brain fog we got the

516
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,440
memory loss we can even move into

517
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,880
dementia whatever we got all that and

518
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:34,880
then we got the Neurosis then we got the

519
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,880
psychosis then we got the

520
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Mania

521
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:43,559
yep Lisa that's a really funny comment

522
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,760
um

523
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:48,880
yeah we got something physically going

524
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:51,400
on physically wrong in there we do let's

525
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,880
go into it a little deeper

526
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:57,760
Now problem is that our soul lives

527
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,919
inside our physical brain and so you

528
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,880
have the ghost in here and the ghost

529
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:05,880
doesn't always live outside of our

530
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:09,400
physical brain our ghost doesn't always

531
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:11,760
live outside of our physical brain keep

532
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:16,360
that in mind

533
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:16,360
okay it doesn't normally live

534
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:22,440
outside playing with all my new colors

535
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,799
over

536
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:26,880
here so what happens is we go to the

537
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:29,200
psychiatrist we go to the counselor we

538
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,520
go to the psychotherapist we go to the

539
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,039
therapist psychoanalyst we go to try to

540
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,480
find help we look for coaches we're

541
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:37,640
looking for answers we want to be

542
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:39,840
coached we want to be taught we want to

543
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:42,120
be taught tools so we can somehow

544
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,080
navigate with this depression and this

545
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:46,400
anxiety and all our struggles and

546
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,559
everything but for some reason we just

547
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,279
can't get rid of it all together and

548
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,240
even when we start doing some things for

549
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:53,559
ourselves like physically we're taking

550
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,679
care of ourselves better we're eating

551
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:56,520
better and all these things and it's

552
00:21:54,679 --> 00:22:00,240
improving and it's improving all it

553
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:02,640
takes is one Nast NY thing to occur one

554
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,320
nasty thing to happen and then boom

555
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,720
we're triggered in right back in the

556
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,200
saddle again and now we're doing it all

557
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:14,000
over

558
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:14,000
again the goal is to heal our brains

559
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,440
physically and then when something

560
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,279
happens and we're triggered back into it

561
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:23,200
we start to doubt ourselves we start to

562
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:25,600
feel like we're faulty we start to lose

563
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,440
Faith and Hope in ourselves we start

564
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,559
thinking that it's us it's our fault

565
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,400
it's your fault

566
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,679
we start thinking that maybe I am a bad

567
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,640
person because everybody else seems to

568
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,640
be living their life look at the person

569
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:37,039
driving in the car next to me I bet you

570
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,720
they got a good life I bet you they're

571
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,240
okay I bet you they're not struggling

572
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,840
hey look at on television right there

573
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,000
those people seem like they got it all

574
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,880
together hey look at those people they

575
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,080
got it good too I must have something

576
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,559
wrong with me I can't pull it together I

577
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:54,080
can't get past this I can't get out of

578
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:56,080
this quick sand and I'm stuck in it and

579
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,799
then you doubt yourself and you judge

580
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,799
yourself and then others tend to judge

581
00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:01,520
you because you're there again you're

582
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:03,799
back to being sick again you're back to

583
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:08,039
struggling again but not your

584
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:10,240
fault it is not your fault it is not

585
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:12,159
your fault you're not a bad person you

586
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,480
didn't create your emotional struggle

587
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:17,279
it's not because you want to be

588
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,919
emotional it's not because you want to

589
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:20,440
have an emotional struggle or a mental

590
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:22,799
struggle it's not because you're looking

591
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:24,520
for attention that's not it at all

592
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,960
because that gets thrown on everybody

593
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:29,799
you're just looking for attention you

594
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:33,039
just want that attention you just you're

595
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:35,080
doing this on purpose you have a

596
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,919
pattern and the psychoanalyst

597
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,559
psychotherapist like you got a pattern

598
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:40,039
this is because you want this to be and

599
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:41,520
then then you know some of the new age

600
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:43,720
people will be like you came into this

601
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:46,200

684
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,880
burned at the Stak because you were a

685
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,360
witch and the 1600s in Salem

686
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:59,039
Massachusetts yes that's why Spirit of

687
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:02,279
compassion never ever ever ever said

688
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:04,480
that to anyone

689
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:06,440
anywhere about why they're suffering

690
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,360
struggling

691
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:10,440
emotionally because there's other

692
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:14,120
reasons there's other things going on

693
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:16,960
physical things that are going on let's

694
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:18,200
go into it a little bit St Su says aw

695
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,000
I'm Holding

696
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:24,200
On by a thread using trauma shock and

697
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:28,039
lost brain shot my daddy passed from

698
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:29,279
dementia last night oh my God It's a

699
00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:32,200
cruel

700
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:34,559
disease it truly is I'm protecting my

701
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:36,159
brain with mm info the best I can right

702
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:39,559
now just know that my heart's with you

703
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:42,120
truly okay my heart is really with you

704
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:44,559
um I understand the nuances I understand

705
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:46,039
the details and I think a lot of people

706
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:50,360
don't know that what happens when you

707
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:54,000
lose lose a loved one uh from dementia

708
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:57,159
um Alzheimer's and it's not as simple

709
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,760
and it's not just you know it's not so

710
00:27:57,159 --> 00:28:03,159
cut and clear it's an agonizing process

711
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:06,440
and there's there's so much to it

712
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:08,000
there's so much to it um so back to this

713
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,880
physically we got things wrong with the

714
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,159
brain let's go into it a little bit now

715
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:16,640
okay you guys all

716
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:18,760
right it usually takes something like

717
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,320
toxic heavy metals but not just toxic

718
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:23,960
heavy metals in the brain not just

719
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:25,279
Metals in the brain that can cause

720
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,480
problems with

721
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:32,159
psychosis it takes also

722
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:34,320
solvents chemicals and

723
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:36,200
solvents what happens is a chemical

724
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,240
interaction can happen inside the brain

725
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,799
with toxic heavy metals and a chemical

726
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,760
reaction can happen inside the brain

727
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:45,120
with lots of different things but metals

728
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:47,519
react to solvents and other chemicals

729
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:49,279
and petrochemicals and so what happens

730
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:51,240
is when we get exposed to something so

731
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:52,320
say somebody has some metals inside

732
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,080
their brain and they're already

733
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,399
struggling they already have problems

734
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:59,320
and then they get their carpets

735
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:03,080
cleaned and the cleaning service comes

736
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:06,440
in and literally dumps solvents inside

737
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:08,559
their floors from the machines solvents

738
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:10,840
that are sitting in the floor in the

739
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:13,760
carpet underneath the floorboard and

740
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:15,320
those solvents are in the air they're on

741
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,679
your skin you're breathing them in

742
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:20,200
they're the carpet cleaning chemicals

743
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,880
that I've seen trigger people for years

744
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:24,240
and the carpet cleaning chemicals are

745
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:26,480
solvents that when they get in your

746
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,640
sinuses and find their way into the

747
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,720
bloodstream to your brain they can

748
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:33,640
interact with the toxic heavy metals

749
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:36,760
causing a chemical reaction that can

750
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:39,640
throw somebody from a very mild mild

751
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:41,600
case of something into boom some kind of

752
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:44,200
psychosis or really some type of

753
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:46,480
neurosis that's out of control or

754
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:48,720
seemingly out of control it's one

755
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:53,279
example right there on its

756
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:57,960

00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:14,760
year the fake logs that are completely

762
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:18,919
soaked and saturated with chemicals like

763
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:22,480
fragrances and petrochemicals and

764
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:25,240
solvents right there anything that

765
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:27,559
someone is smoking on top of that along

766
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:29,640
with breathing in smoke that's burning

767
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:32,000
in a fire pit a lot of people burn

768
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:35,080
treated wood in fire pits and the

769
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,880
treated wood has solvents on it it's

770
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,559
saturated solvents you ever see a piece

771
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:42,559
of trated wood piece of trated wood is

772
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:44,840
actually has all it actually has green

773
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:47,559
you know the green color that's on the

774
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:50,320
wood get a 2x4

775
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:53,360
2x6 right whatever it is that you're

776
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:56,080
getting treated wood a lot of people

777
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,639
take treated wood and they burn it in

778
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:01,639
their backyard they burn it in their

779
00:30:57,639 --> 00:31:04,679
fire pits they burn it in Posh areas

780
00:31:01,639 --> 00:31:07,000
that are really expensive to live where

781
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:08,960
rich people live and they burn it where

782
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
people that don't have resources and

783
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:14,039
don't have a lot of money live they burn

784
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,039
it there too they burn it everywhere and

785
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:18,240
that's a massive trigger for a lot of

786
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:19,679
people where you breathe in that smoke

787
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,960
could be anything something you're

788
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:24,360
smoking something you're breathing in

789
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:26,440
big trigger for all kinds of levels of

790
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:29,880
anxiety and depression but to up it to

791
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:32,080
up it into yosis eventually Christine

792
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:35,799
says o says please talk about the

793
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:38,480
laundry scense they are out of

794
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:40,039
control I I broke the the news to the

795
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,600
world about the fragrances and the

796
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:45,360
laundry detergents and the fabric

logs burn burning they're loaded with

817
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:32,559
perfume which is all that toxic metal

818
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:34,480
and everything else and then they're

819
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:36,840
burning scented candles and then they

820
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,840
got the the worst conventional

821
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:41,320
detergents petrochemicals and solvents

822
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:44,760
all in it and they're just one big stink

823
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:46,039
one big stink bomb getting into sinuses

824
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:48,559
getting into the

825
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:50,440
bloodstream yeah and that stuff just

826
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:53,440
boom just sits inside our liver and it

827
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:56,679
torments us too which could be a trigger

828
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,919
as well so so going into like say you're

829
00:32:56,679 --> 00:33:00,880
say you're

830
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:03,200
struggling and you're suffering in some

831
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,240
way depression anxiety dep

832
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,960
personalization deep sadness you can't

833
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:10,159
explain ups and downs anger and

834
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,679
frustration sadness said it already and

835
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:13,799
then maybe even something more serious

836
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:16,919
like you got some manic stuff going on

837
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:19,679
some Mania you got some serious OCD got

838
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:21,240
some serious brain fog got the bipolar

839
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:22,720
diagnosis or something that someone

840
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,679
might have given you and you're doing

841
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,679
all

842
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:28,399
that and then it can get triggered it's

843
00:33:26,679 --> 00:33:30,320
all you're already struggling you

844
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:32,080
already have something going on inside

845
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,399
the brain itself and I'm going to go

846
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,960
into something what happens when these

847
00:33:33,399 --> 00:33:38,519
two start to melt together right here

848
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:40,720
the ghost your soul your spirit whatever

849
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:42,440
you want to call it and your physical

850
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:45,799
brain and then you got all these things

851
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:48,200
going on and then boom you get triggered

852
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:50,720
by solvents and petrochemicals and yeah

853
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:54,320
la laundry detergents and plugins and

854
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,960
sented candles and yes and clones and

855
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:58,159
perfumes and it gets into the

856
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:00,240
bloodstream fast because these are like

857
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:02,600
these are solvents they go through the

858
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:05,519
brain they go through the body into the

859
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:08,200
organs and then they go and they touch

860
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:12,359
sensitive brain tissue that's what they

861
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:16,320
do they touch sensitive brain

862
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:19,960
tissue okay so you got your

863
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:22,040
brain right and in your brain are is all

864
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:23,560
this sensitive tissue when you're sick

865
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:26,079
and you don't feel

866
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:28,879
good when you're sick and you don't feel

867
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:28,879
good

868
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:37,520
okay you got all this sensitive

869
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:40,919
tissue gets triggered really easy it

870
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:42,839
does so much so that you can get

871
00:34:40,919 --> 00:34:44,560
triggered emotionally really easy too

872
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:46,720
because physically you're struggling

873
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:49,119
inside because you got physical stuff

874
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:51,079
happening you got petrochemicals you've

875
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:52,919
got all the different fragrances in here

876
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:55,760
you got the MSG in here you got a build

877
00:34:52,919 --> 00:34:59,440
up of the toxic salts if I hear one more

878
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:03,280
time somebody in help try to recycle the

879
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:07,320
same old BS and pretend it's new quality

880
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:09,920
salts you need plenty of fats plenty of

881
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:13,160
quality salts stay away from this stay

882
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:15,040
away from that right the good fish oil

883
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:16,760
do the krill oil don't do the fish if I

884
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:20,480
hear that one more time that same old

885
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:23,000
Spiel out there this same old stick

886
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:25,359
right when people don't even realize why

887
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,119
people are sick or what's going on in

888
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:29,280
there the reason why you'll see medical

889
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:33,280
medium

890
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:34,640
doesn't obsess about salt make sure you

891
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,040
have all the salt in your water make

892
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,000
sure you put salt in your water make

893
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:39,760
sure you put salt on your food good

894
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,040
salts are good they're supportive for

895
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,480
this they're supportive for that the

896
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:45,400
reason why you don't hear that the

897
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:48,760
spirit of compassion says too much salt

898
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:51,400
builds up in the brain and it

899
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:53,400
crystallizes it crystallizes inside the

900
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:55,520
brain because it's got nowhere to go

901
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:57,800
because you're not peeing it out in time

902
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,319
it's build more salt is coming in and

903
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:02,400
going out more salt is coming in and

904
00:35:59,319 --> 00:36:05,160
going out you can still get a blood test

905
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:07,920
and be low on sodium in your bloodstream

906
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:10,040
and have salt deposits inside the

907
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:13,800
brain that are

908
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:16,280
crystallized and no longer are they

909
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,960
liquifying people have MSG deposits they

910
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:20,240
have salt deposits they have calcium

911
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:22,280
deposits from being so acidic all the

912
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:23,640
time then they have toxic heavy metals

913
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,800
then they have all the fragrances and

914
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:28,000
chemicals they got all of that inside

915
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:30,599
their brain

916
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,640
and it's making them feel like they're

917
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:36,119
crazy when they're not it's making them

918
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:38,480
feel like they're losing their mind when

919
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:40,839
they're not they're struggling

920
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:43,599
physically it's not their fault they

921
00:36:40,839 --> 00:36:45,400
didn't cause it they didn't create it

922
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:46,920
and then they get

923
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,440
triggered

924
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:51,640
triggered

925
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:54,640
easily but what happens

926
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:56,440
is Anna says over there on YouTube what

927
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:58,520
should you do if you have to work in

928
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:00,319
that

929
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:02,480
environment well that's what I love

930
00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:04,200
about medical medium information okay go

934
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:13,359
sell anything it's the books you can get

935
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:16,440
free in the library okay there's no

936
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:19,480
subscription fees on my website we can't

937
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:20,720
avoid every we can't avoid everything

938
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,880
we're going to have to live with it

939
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,319
we're going to have to live with

940
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:25,920
something some fragrance or something or

941
00:37:24,319 --> 00:37:28,720
some colog something's going to happen

942
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:30,599
in our life something around us we're

943
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:32,160
going to have to be in work work

944
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:33,880
environment and that's when we do we

945
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:36,359
take care of ourselves we get the medals

946
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:37,839
out we get the chemicals out we learn

947
00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:39,680
how to do it through the information

948
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:41,400
that s so has given us and we learn how

949
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:43,200
to get that out and we get our lives

950
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:46,400
back we take control of our lives so

951
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:49,920
that when we walk into an area that has

952
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:52,319
all of that we're strong we walk into an

953
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:57,839
area we don't get triggered

954
00:37:52,319 --> 00:38:00,119
anymore we move forward and we heal

955
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:02,440
salt is overdone in Foods it's not that

956
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:06,119
I don't like salt to some degree I'm not

957
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:08,319
anti sodium look at the celery juice

958
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:10,160
I've been screaming celery juice over

959
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:13,000
and over and over and over again I'm not

960
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:14,680
anti salt can use a little bit here and

961
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,920
there you just don't want to rely on it

962
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:20,680
because it's overdone people pile it on

963
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:23,839
leafy greens have sodium content in it

964
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:27,200
all the herbs leafy green herbs cilantro

965
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:29,440
parsley right kale spinach especially

966
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:31,560
they all have sodium in them right

967
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,440
tomatoes got sodium in them lemons got

968
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:35,200
sodium in them right but I'm talking

969
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,800
about like restaurant food and packaged

970
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:40,280
Foods is so overs salted and we get so

971
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:42,359
used to that salt you've heard that you

972
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:44,880
get so used to it you're acclimating to

973
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:46,520
that salt and then what happens is

974
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,480
you're dumping so much salt in you don't

975
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:49,920
even realize how much Salt's going in

976
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,760
and it never stops because you're so

977
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,480
used to it every day and that builds up

978
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:56,280
and crystallizes a lot of people need

979
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:57,599
breakes from Salt so they can also do

980
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:01,040
some

981
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:04,800
healing all right the problem

982
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:04,800
is you're struggling

983
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:11,040
emotionally because you're struggling

984
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:15,920
physically your

985
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:17,560
soul is being challenged in a brain

986
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,839
that's being

987
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:21,400
challenged you're being challenged visic

988
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:23,400
in your brain you're being challenged

989
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:25,920
emotionally in your brain through your

990
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:28,800
soul cuz that's being challenged and

991
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:31,480
you're strong struggling you're

992
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:33,920
struggling and it becomes a vicious

993
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:36,440
cycle and a vicious circle is what it

994
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:38,680
becomes and it's hard to break out of it

995
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:41,200
and it just seems to just get tougher

996
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:43,040
and tougher and tougher and tougher and

997
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:45,040
the circle and the cycle doesn't get

998
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,319
broken easy it's back to suffering and

999
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,160
struggling you're feeling a little

1000
00:39:46,319 --> 00:39:50,280
better back to it again and no one

1001
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:53,160
realizes we got to get the brain the

1002
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:56,160

1003
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:58,400
