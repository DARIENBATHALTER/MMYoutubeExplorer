yeah

8
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,399
yeah thank you for taking your time out

9
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,960
for your busy day i know you got

10
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:53,520
hundreds of patients yeah

11
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,440
so when i left your office i didn't know

12
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,840
exactly what you meant

13
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,239
what yeah the chocolate cake how much

14
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,160
chocolate cake can i have

15
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,760
yeah was it

16
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,040
a slice a day you said moderation and

17
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,560
i'm trying to figure this out like the

18
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,640
moderation thing

19
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,360
yeah because my moderation's different

20
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,759
than your moderation possibly

21
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,200
because it sounded like to me you have

22
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,119
chocolate cake

23
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,280
on the weekends i think you were telling

24
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:23,119
me and then i realized when i came back

25
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,880
home that i i'm not having chocolate

26
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:28,560
cake on the weekends i'm having

27
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,960
chocolate cake tuesday night

28
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,040
yeah thursday night

29
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,200
and friday night

30
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,560
and i think if there's leftover

31
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,799
chocolate cake i'm gonna have it on

32
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,399
sunday night too

33
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,640
and then if there's a little left over

34
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,159
i'm gonna have some for monday morning

35
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,680
with my coffee

36
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,360
is that okay

37
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,479
the thing is i don't want to waste the

38
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:55,040
cake when i buy a chocolate cake

39
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:57,920
i have a lot of leftover cake and i

40
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,920
can't afford to keep on i can't throw

41
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,479
away the cake

42
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,079
so how do i freeze it

43
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,079
okay i could freeze the chocolate cake

44
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,680
that's why that's why

45
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,039
it's amazing i got such an incredible

46
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,640
doctor

47
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:13,440
you're no no you're welcome you're

48
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,480
welcome you are that amazing of a doctor

49
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,480
dr

50
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,560
dr joni

51
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,160
yeah i got another question too so

52
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,599
so then

53
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,440
so that takes care of the chocolate cake

54
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:27,360
so i also like to have some popcorn

55
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,360
movie theater popcorn yeah my friend

56
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,920
goes to see the movies and then brings

57
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,239
me back a whole bunch of it

58
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,040
when do i do the popcorn

59
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,800
in between a chocolate cake okay so this

60
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,480
this moderation thing i'm really liking

61
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,920
this moderation

62
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,920
so i can have

63
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,200
can i have the whole thing you don't

64
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,599
know what i have in my hand you can't

65
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,720
see it okay i have a really big thing of

66
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,560
popcorn right here so do half of this is

67
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,120
that what you're saying a quarter

68
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,120
i could do a quarter of this popcorn

69
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,920
three times a week

70
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,760
okay

71
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,920
okay i could do that but there's going

72
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,400
to be a leftover quarter

73
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,360
because that's three times a week four

74
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,280
times a week is four quarters

75
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,040
yeah so i could do four times a week

76
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,720

77
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,560

215

important live i wonder yeah

216
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,160
i

217
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,240
i think we have a delayed audience

218
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,240
laughter response but we're we're going

219
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,639
to find out where it went you know the

220
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,759
thing is you guys on this is that

221
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:12,879
when it comes down to moderation right

222
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:15,440
it it's it's rampant because we're

223
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,680
talking about autoimmune and moderation

224
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,000
they don't fit in they don't work

225
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,919
together they don't fit in together

226
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,800
they don't work together still waiting

227
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:27,199
for that delay and the thing is is like

228
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,400
when it comes down to

229
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:32,240
if you say moderation's okay

230
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,560
then

231
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,000
someone with autoimmune there it is you

232
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,959
guys there it is

233
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,360
all right all right

234
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:42,800
there we are

235
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,080
it's how things work here they work

236
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,360
really good

237
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,680
so

238
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,120
so the whole thing is so let's talk

239
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,880
let's take this serious though we got to

240
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,040
take the series we're talking about

241
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,839
autoimmune in moderation why they don't

242
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,399
blend why they don't mix they just don't

243
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,480
mix they just don't blend and this is an

244
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,680
important talk because

245
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,560
i can tell you right now if you're

246
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,399
somebody that's trying to heal if you're

247
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,760
somebody that wants to get your life

248
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:13,279
back moderation does not fit into the

249
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:15,120
equation it doesn't it just doesn't fit

250
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,160
into the equation

251
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,600
because

252
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,720
if you have to heal

253
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,760
because

254
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:27,279
everything in your body and your mind

255
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:30,320
and your soul wants to heal

256
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:32,279
wants to heal so bad

257
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,880
but then you get given

258
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:37,200
misinformation about how you can have a

259
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,519
little bit of this and a little bit of

260
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,519
that and a little bit of this and a

261
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,600
little bit of that

262
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,360
that's how we just get in trouble we

263
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,600
truly get in trouble

264
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,120
and we don't realize it we don't realize

265
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,959
how that works

266
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,360
because it's like the

267
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:56,800
stopper to us healing that's what it is

268
00:09:53,360 --> 00:10:00,160
moderation is like a

269
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:02,640
obstacle right it's like an obstacle

270
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,279
that gets in everybody's way and

271
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:08,160
everybody in the health care world and

272
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:11,920
the health care providers in the health

273
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:14,640
world and the health and fitness world

274
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,480
all say moderation is okay have some

275

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,279
we're live on facebook i don't know

285
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,839
where we're live right now because we

286
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,120
got a lot of platforms up right now

287
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,360
so

288
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,800
anyway

289
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,399
we're um

290
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,920
so let's let's go into this a little bit

291
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,120
about moderation and where we're at

292
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,200
where we're all right we're live on

293
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,800
telegram right now too i know that

294
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,480
we're live on youtube so i'm excited

295
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,360
about today

296
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,519
so

297
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:01,760
do you ever

298
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:03,040
do you ever wonder why moderation is so

299
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,120
easy

300
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,640
to get permission for by every single

301
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,720
doctor and healthcare practitioner i

302
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,640
hear it every single day

303
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,720
that's why i'm bringing it up i'm

304
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:16,000
bringing it up because i hear it all the

305
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,880
time it's like aw i just got permission

306
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
to do this is that okay i'm like what

307
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,519
and you know what you don't need

308
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,440
permission from me you can do what you

309
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,959
want your life your choice but what i am

310
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,279
going to do is lay out what gets in the

311
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:30,320
way of our health and how we can heal

312
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:33,839
right but moderation can add

313
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:36,640
it can add years missing off your life

314
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,480
not adding years to your life too that's

315
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,800
another thing because moderation is like

316
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,360
that chipper away where it chips away

317
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,440
years off your life is what it does

318
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,240
and it depends on how far you go into

319
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,160
moderation how much into moderation do

320
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,720
you do do you drink in moderation like

321
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,120
what's drinking in moderation right

322
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:58,320
do you smoke in moderation what do you

323
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,600
eat in moderation right all these things

324
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,760
that we do

325
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,000
and it just it basically becomes a

326
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,839
snowball like this moderation snowball

327
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,040
and everybody's all trapped in it and

328
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,320
their legs are sticking out of that

329
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,200
snowball and their arms are sticking out

330
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,959
their heads are sticking out the

331
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,880
snowball and it's going down the

332
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:15,920
mountain is what it's doing it's like

333
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:17,920
this gigantic moderation snowball

334
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,279
if you got autoimmune

335
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,000
if you got

336
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:24,000
anxiety depression severe depression

337
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,959
if you got any kind of neurological

338
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,480
symptom

339
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:29,279
whatever that may be

340
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,920
moderation becomes a trap it becomes

341
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,839
your enemy it becomes

342
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,639
something that really gets in our way

343
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:39,279
and i see it happen all the time it's

344
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:41,440
like we want we're desperate for

345
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:44,160
permission we're desperate for

346
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,639
validation we're desperate for somebody

347
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,959
to say yeah you can have that

348
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,920
yeah you can have a little bit of that

349
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:53,279
you know yeah why not it's good for the

350
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,880
soul right

351
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,040
well you know i think about what's good

352
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:00,079
for the soul i think about staying here

353
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,360
longer staying here not sick

354
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:05,680
staying here

355
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:08,000
feeling good staying here you know

356
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,320
an optimum level right or just staying

357
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,560
here and functioning on a decent enough

358
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,079
level whatever it takes right but

359
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,600
staying here you know that's good for

360
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:19,279
the soul i see that as good for the soul

361
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,519
and at the same time

362
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:25,920
it's all about

363
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:27,040
how we perceive stuff to you guys right

364
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,760
i know

365
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,519
people that have had to heal

366
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,000
their gastrointestinal tract because it

367
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,800
was so bad off and so inflamed and

368
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,680
colitis and crohn's and celiac right and

369
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,360
ibs and they had to heal it by scaling

370
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,040
back on their foods

371
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,320
and all of a sudden doing like mono

372
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,480
eating right where they're doing

373
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,560
potatoes and lettuce or they're doing

374
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,240
celery juice and bananas and papaya

375
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,040
right and then

376
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,600
they

377
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,120
healed and they got nice and strong and

378
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,800
their intestinal tract got nice and

379
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,480
strong and then they can bring in more

380
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,160
things then they'll say they're bringing

381
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,079
in more things

382
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,760
now they're bringing in some avocado now

383
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,760
they're bringing in some you know some

384
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,959
more different dishes and every single

385
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,160
kind of vegetable and then they're

386
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,000
bringing some more things and if they're

387
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,279
an animal protein person now they're

388
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,560
bringing in a little bit of animal

389
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,800
protein

390
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,720
and they're and they're able to now eat

391
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,600
more of what they feel

392
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,680
is like an incredible moderation so

393
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,480
moderation can like it could be like one

394
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:27,680
to a hundred to have the worst level of

395
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,959
moderation there ever was at hunt at a

396
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,040
hundred

397
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,320
and you can have like the best level of

398
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:36,480
moderation

399
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:39,680
at like one and two and three the 97 98

400
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,920
99 100 the worst level of moderation

401
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,680
and people don't realize that it can get

402
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,519
like it can snowball it's like you know

403
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,959
what i can do this now i could do a

404
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,240
little bit of this let me have a little

405
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,000
bit of this i could have a cheeseburger

406
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,000
twice a week and now i can have you know

407
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,600
pancakes this day and now on sunday i'll

408
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,320
just have a little bit more and it just

409
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,079
takes over and then we're trapped in it

410
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,920
and when we get trapped in it it's hard

411
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:03,279
to get out of it especially when we're

412
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,079
sick so it's the kind of thing where

413
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,000
it's

414
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,519
everybody wants to heal they all want to

415
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,920
get better they all want to get their

416
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,560
lives back

417
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,160
but the moderation trap is real and we

418
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,920
have to be really careful you see it in

419
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,160
every article out there you see people

420
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,680
say no i can eat what i want it's cheat

421
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,160
day right

422
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,160
and so everybody does their cheat days

423
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,160
too so they think they can do their

424
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,680
cheat day in moderation so everybody

425
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,240
still has their moderation now at the

426
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,160

the whole thing about food is one thing

468
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,320
about medical medium

469
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,240
is my mechanism information right

470
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,000
it's never about shaming

471
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,720
or judging

472
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,240
it's always being about being supportive

473
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,079
with someone wherever they are with

474
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,759
their foods because i know

475
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,919
it is hard

476
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,919
it is hard when you're living with

477
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,919
family that are eating certain foods

478
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,520
like i know so many of you guys are so

479
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,520
you're you're in a situation where you

480
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,360
got family members right loved ones

481
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,880
they're eating a certain way

482
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,439
they're doing what they want to do with

483
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,039
foods and it's really hard for you

484
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,559
and i completely understand that when

485
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,640
it's really hard

486
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,919
that makes it very difficult and one

487
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,120
that makes it very difficult that i

488
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,640
understand so there's that alone right

489
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,480
so you guys so that's a whole other

490
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,400
thing and i know that

491
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,640
that it's different

492
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,240
when you you're alone if you're somebody

493
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,000
that lives alone then you could be like

494
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,840
okay wait a minute i don't have the peer

495
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,160
pressure someone's not bringing in

496
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,880
pizzas someone's not bringing but at the

497
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:49,039
same time it's easy to just say you know

498
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,760
what this is what i want or this is what

499
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:54,160
i want right so i get it you know and

500
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,080
it's not an easy road when it comes down

501
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,919
to food so

502
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,520
yeah it's really difficult out there

503
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,919
when you see somebody and they're so

504
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,760
good with their foods right really like

505
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,320
great with their foods and then you

506
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,840
think that they are kind of harping on

507
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,960
you because you're not that good with

508
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,600
your foods

509
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,360
it's it's difficult all around and i've

510
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,960
seen all the different scenarios out

511
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,679
there right but you got to keep one

512
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,840
thing in your in your mind one thing you

513
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,360
do a little bit out of time a little bit

514
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:24,480
at a time

515
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:26,240
so i like to kind of reframe moderation

516
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,559
it's not about

517
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,799
i could have this in moderation wow what

518
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,320
a relief right i can have a little bit

519
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,760
of this in moderation i could have a

520
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,919
slice of this in moderation i'll have

521
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:39,360
some popcorn today not about that

522
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:42,000
it's about bringing in the other foods

523
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,160
it's about bringing in more fruit it's

524
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,480
about bringing in right

525
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,640
more brussels sprouts more artichokes

526
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,760
right more asparagus it's about bringing

527
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,760
those in until you weed out until you

528
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,799
push out

529
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,799
like the moderation foods that's a way

530
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:00,960
of doing it that's a great way of doing

531
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,640
it it's a way you bring in more apples

532
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,320
and you bring in more oranges and you

533
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,000
bring in medical medium tools if you can

534
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,679
like the heavy metal detox smoothies you

535
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,840
bring in your celery juice and when you

536
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,880
start bringing all this in it actually

537
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:14,000
pushes

538
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,760
the moderation foods away

539
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,840
and you start getting stronger and you

540
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,840
start feeling like better willpower more

541
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,720
well strong willpower starts to take

542
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,200
over

543
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,960
and you can actually push those

544
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,559
moderation foods away so when someone

545
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,559
says no you can have that moderation

546
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,720
you're always like no no you can start

547
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:33,520
to feel strength coming up from the

548
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,280
inner core and you can get that strength

549
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,760
building up strong in the inner core

550
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:40,559
like your soul gets stronger

551
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:43,520
your ability to defend yourself

552
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:46,240
against the the moderation foods

553
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,720
starts to get stronger right you get

554
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,880
that inner strength and it gets better

555
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,320
that's because when you bring in more

556
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,679
things so when you start bringing in

557
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,280
things like

558
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,280
tomatoes and you're bringing more of

559
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,280
these and you're snacking on these

560
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,679
tomatoes something changes when you

561
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,320
start doing your lemon and lime water

562
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:06,640
every single day something starts to

563
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,720
change right this is when what happens

564
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,679
so when you're bringing in these foods

565
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,600
it starts to push away those moderation

566
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,600
traps right and you're bringing in more

567
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,440
onions and these are just a few things

568
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,039
right you're bringing in some onions

569
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,320
which you can't see right there and

570
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,320
you're bringing other things when you

571
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,000
start to bring in

572
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,240
other foods look at these tomatoes right

573
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,120
here look how incredible these are right

574
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,679
and

575
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,520
it starts to change the game the playing

576
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,679
field gets different

577
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,440
you can strengthen in a way because

578
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:38,080
you're bringing all these different

579
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,440
pieces right so what i recommend

580
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,679
for anybody who's struggling with the

581
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,440
moderation traps because i know so many

582
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,679
people are i'm sure you guys are i'm

583
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,600
sure maybe maybe some of you guys are

584
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,720
you guys are solid right through the

585
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,720
moderation

586
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,600
has it the moderation isn't tempting you

587
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:56,720
or the moderation trap isn't in your way

588
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,320
but if it is in your way okay

589
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,039
don't think about

590
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,880
the

591
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,559
food the unproductive foods and the bad

592
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,559
foods in the troublemaker foods don't

593
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:06,720
think about those as being like oh can i

594
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,559
eat those think about what can i eat

595
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,960
that's not these

596
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,720
and you bring in these other foods you

597
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:16,320
bring in the bananas

598
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:18,080
right you pick up some cantaloupe okay

599
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,320
things like you pick up some berries you

600
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:23,200
get your frozen wild blueberries and the

601
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:25,200
more and more things you bring in

602
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,600
every even avocado if you gotta bring an

603
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:30,559
avocado you bring the avocado in you

604
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:32,799
bring that one in right there absolutely

605
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:34,880
and then you bring in your leafy greens

606
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:37,120
now one of the ways to beat the

607
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,039
moderation food game

608
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,120
is get the leafy greens in the trace

609
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,799
mineral salts to get the celery juice in

610
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,960
which is the trace mineral salts and to

611
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:46,880
get the glucose which is the sugar you

612
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,400
can get the sugar in because if you

613
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,919
don't get the good sugar in you're going

614
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,200
to be getting this sugar right here

615
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,799
you're going to be looking for this

616
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,720
sugar this is the one you're going to be

617
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:57,039
looking for if you don't get the good

618
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,760
sugar in if you don't get the good sugar

619
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:01,919
in you're going to be trying to get this

620
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,120
sugar in right here this is

621
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,559
the sugar

622
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,799
that's what you're looking for can be

623
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:08,320
looking for this if you don't get

624
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,679
the good sugar if you don't get the good

625
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,799
sugar in

626
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,960
you're going to be looking for this

627
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:15,760
sugar right here all right that's how it

628
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:18,159
works so if you don't get the good stuff

629
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,240
in like the bananas okay

630
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:22,480
you gotta have the stuff around so it's

631
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,520
critical to have it around you don't

632
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,919
have

633
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,440
the trace mineral salt and the glucose

634
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:30,480
then you're gonna be just eating

635
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,400
whatever anything that comes your way

636
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,080
any friend any neighbor any family

637
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,360
member that's making something someone

638
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,280
scooping some ice cream out of the

639
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,360
freezer you're gonna eat it nothing's

640
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,039
gonna stop a lot of people from grabbing

641
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,039
a slice of pizza and then you're going

642
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:44,880
to be thinking like well wait i had it

643
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:47,919
last week or i had four days ago it's

644
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,679
moderation i'll i should get by

645
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:51,760
and the moderation is just going to beat

646
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,600
us down it's going to beat us down and

647
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,559
keep us down

648
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,960
so

649
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:58,640
one of the key things one of the key

650
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,000
things to remember is you gotta have

651
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,240
your trace mineral salts you gotta have

652
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,159
your celery juice you gotta have your

653
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,159
spinach and leafy greens

654
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:07,760
if you can just bring in spinach salads

655
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:10,320
every single day with tomatoes and put

656
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:13,200
avocado on them just put avocado on them

657
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:15,600
have a avocado tomato onion spinach

658
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,200
salad if you can do your celery juice

659
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,159
you could do the heavy metal detox

660
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,080
smoothie

661
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:22,000
if you can do the lemon water if you can

662
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,679
get your trace mineral salts and lots of

663
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,520
your glucose

664
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,840
right there you're going to be beating

665
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:30,000
the moderation trap you're going to be

666
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,840
winning if you can get those in because

667
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,159
you're going to be less

668
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,480
less apt to actually eating the bad

669
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:38,240
stuff when it comes your way so it's

670
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,320
really about bringing the good stuff in

671
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,880
and then you push away the bad stuff it

672
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,640
becomes a natural push off is what

673
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,559
you're doing a natural way of getting

674
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,240
those things pushed away and getting

675
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:50,880
them out of your life but you got to

676
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:53,440
worry about the permission granters

677
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,279
right got to worry about yeah health

678
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,960
care providers that say you can have a

679
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:59,120
little of this and you can have a little

680
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,520
of that you can have some of that

681
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:04,720
because they're doing it so they're

682
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:06,159
doing it and maybe they're not sick yet

683
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,600
but you could be somebody that's sick

684
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,799
you're struggling with anxiety you're

685
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,640
struggling with autoimmune you're

686
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:11,919
struggling with neurological symptoms

687
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,520
and then

688
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,039
the people that are supposed to be

689
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,520
watching your back

690
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:19,039
because they do the moderation thing and

691
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,159
eat whatever when they want they're

692
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,360
going to give you little bits of

693
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,960
permission and you're going to take

694
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,559
those bits of permission

695
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,640
and you're going to take that advice and

696
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:28,960
it's going to slow you down

697
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,080
so we got to remember that we got to

698
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,440
look out for that of course i always

699
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,840
want you listening to your doctors and

700
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,520
practitioners 100 but i also want you to

701
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,679
be able to protect yourself in any way

702
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:40,240
you possibly can and maybe you find a

703
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:41,919
doctor that doesn't offer all this other

704
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,559
foods i'm going off to ig you guys i

705
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,320
just want to give you a quick moderation

706
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,520
talk because it's really hitting people

707
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,640
hard right now

708
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,480
