111
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:58,160
what is a soul

112
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,160
do you know

113
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:05,060
does our soul even exist

114
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,060
does it

115
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,139
is their soul just air

116
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,800
that floats away

117
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,800
and that's just our soul

118
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:22,860
was having a soul all along created by

119
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:25,080
our imagination

120
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,820
is it your imagination that created a

121
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,520
soul all long

122
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:31,320
it never existed

123
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,460
it's just air

124
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,460
it's thin air

125
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:41,100
let me just say this

126
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,900
let me make this clear your soul does

127
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:46,620
exist

128
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:51,539
everyone has a soul

129
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:55,080
it is the voice of your entire existence

130
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:57,840
this isn't just our existence here

131
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:00,240
physically here now

132
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,479
our existence just isn't what's on

133
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,479
social

134
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:08,360
it isn't you just

135
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,360
hopping in your car and driving

136
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:15,320
it isn't just us communicating now

137
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,320
that's not just our existence

138
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,639
your soul is the voice of your entire

139
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:22,620
existence think about that for a moment

140
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:27,800
entire existence means

141
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:27,800
way before now and way in the future

142
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:35,539
your soul retains knowledge of all the

143
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,539
events that have occurred in your life

144
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:41,340
your soul holds a record retains

145
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:45,300
knowledge of everything that's ever

146
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:47,360
happened in your life here

147
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:49,860
foreign

148
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,539
that contains the meaning of your

149
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:53,580
physical existence if your physical

150
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:57,139
existence has any meaning at all your

151
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,139
soul contains that record of it

152
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:02,520
if being here physically right now has

153
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,560
any meaning me standing here in the

154
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,539
moment talking to you you being right

155
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,300
there commenting

156
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:11,520
and watching this

157
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,919
if there's any physical existence right

158
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,199
there your soul contains the meaning of

159
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,419
it

160
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:21,180
your soul harnesses every Journey you

161
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:22,740
have chosen or experienced and not

162
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:27,120
chosen

163
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:29,280
in a physical living form every single

164
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,759
experience you have chosen in this

165
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,759
lifetime

166
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:36,960
your soul harnesses every Journey that

167
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,599
you have had and if it's an experience

168
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,720
that you did not want to partake in if

169
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:46,620
it's an experience that somehow you were

170
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:48,979
in your soul still harnesses that

171
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,979
Journey

172
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,919
your soul sustains itself and lives

173
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,919
forever

174
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:03,599
that means that when we leave here

175
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:06,259
you're not

176
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,259
gone

177
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:15,919
your soul sustains itself and lives

178
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,919
forever long past being here

179
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:24,620
long after the physical part of us has

180
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,620
perished so if we perish

181
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,460
your soul lives on

182
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,360
it never dies

183
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:40,140
it doesn't matter if you like your soul

184
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:42,659
you don't have to like your soul

185
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:46,580
you can hate your soul

186
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:46,580
it doesn't matter if you love your soul

187
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,899
doesn't matter if you hate your soul it

188
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:54,000
doesn't matter if you don't believe in

189
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:56,760
the Soul's existence

190
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,100
or believe you have a soul you don't

191
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:01,080
have to believe you have a soul you do

192
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:03,560
not have to believe in your Soul's

193
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,560
existence

194
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,440
you can be somebody that doesn't believe

195
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:09,600
you have a soul and there is a soul or

196
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,779
Souls don't exist they do exist or not

197
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,640
you don't believe it on any level

198
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:17,040
it doesn't matter because your soul is

199
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:20,899
more powerful than what you believe your

200
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,899
soul is more powerful than you

201
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:27,480
your soul

202
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:29,399
is more powerful than you

203
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,080
you can hate your soul and that doesn't

204
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:33,120
matter your soul is more powerful than

205
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,560
that you can love your soul sure your

206
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,320
Soul's more powerful than that believe

207
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,820
it or not you cannot even believe your

208
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,760
soul exists and your soul is more

209
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:45,680
powerful than that I'm on page 552.

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,680

your soul is more powerful than you

214
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:07,500
your soul is more powerful than your

215
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:09,800
Consciousness in your present state of

216
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,800
being

217
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:12,839
you wake up in the morning and you're

218
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,600
conscious

219
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:18,000
consciousness

220
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,839
is in gear

221
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,839
you're thinking

222
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:26,040
you're living your life

223
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,720
but your soul is more powerful than your

224
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,399
Consciousness in the present state of

225
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,100
being right now your soul is more

226
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:34,800
powerful than the brainwashing you have

227
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:36,180
been conditioned with here on Earth did

228
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,740
you know that that your soul is more

229
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:40,580
powerful than the brainwashing that

230
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,580
happens here on Earth

231
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:44,640
there is a tremendous amount of

232
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:48,680
conditioning in brainwashing here on

233
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,680
Earth right now happening to everybody

234
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:53,399
and guess what no matter how brainwashed

235
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,959
you get down here no matter how

236
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:56,760
conditioned you get down here your soul

237
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:59,100
overrides that it's way more more

238
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:01,680
powerful than all of that

239
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:04,680

brain shot therapy cleanse challenge

244
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:18,180
your soul is more powerful than the

245
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:21,240
brainwashing and the conditioned

246
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:24,720
that we go through here on Earth because

247
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:27,860
your soul has been far away from Earth

248
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,860
at one point

249
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:34,019
conditioning and brainwashing cannot

250
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:38,360
hold your soul down because your soul

251
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:38,360
hasn't just been here on Earth

252
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:45,300
your Soul's not governed

253
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:49,620
in this earth-bound bubble

254
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:51,600
of our human created environment

255
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:54,420
so whatever happens

256
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:57,480
in this environment

257
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:59,880
this human conditioned brainwashed

258
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:03,000
creative created environment whatever

259
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:05,160
happens does not govern your soul

260
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,620
because your soul has been somewhere

261
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,620
else before it's not EarthBound

262
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,700
it's not governed by this Earthbound

263
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,860
bubble we live in this bubble so many

264
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:19,019
people are in of our human created

265
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:22,320
environment

266
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:25,700
your soul is more than you

267
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,700
it is your light

268
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:30,540
your soul

269
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:33,380
is a light

270
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:33,380
shines bright

271
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:38,760
your soul is a light that did not start

272
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:41,160
here on Earth but started above and you

273
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:44,000
have to remember that our soul did not

274
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,000
start here

275
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:48,500
our soul started above

276
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:58,620
your soul is much older than your

277
00:12:54,899 --> 00:13:00,839
physical body how old are you

278
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:03,899
20 years old

279
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:05,940
30 years old 40.

280
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:09,060
are you 50

281
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:11,940
60 70 80 90.

282
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:15,380
how old are you your soul is much older

283
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:15,380
than your physical body

284
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:22,320
and get ready for this

285
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:24,300
fasten your seatbelts

286
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,120
your soul is much older than your

287
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:31,019
physical body and has memories and

288
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:35,540
information from the past to which you

289
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:35,540
don't have conscious access to

290
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:45,060
your soul has the power to lead you on

291
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:47,760
your way even when it's under fed and

292
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:49,620
broken by the people around you or the

293
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,899
world we live in

294
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:54,899
your soul is a light that can help you

295
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:59,779
lead the way even with all of the crap

296
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:59,779
we are faced with down here on Earth

297
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:05,760
your Soul's leftover fragments still

298
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:08,160
hold the power and the glory that

299
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,200
brighten the way on the darkest path it

300
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:16,040
can't be stomped out

301
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:16,040
your soul cannot be stomped out

302
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:22,860
when we voice ourselves here on Earth

303
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:25,260
sometimes we find moments when we

304
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:27,180
transcend the confusion here

305
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:29,579
and what we're speaking is more than

306
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:32,700
just our own truth

307
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:35,639
it is a common truth that unites us with

308
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:39,000
others one that may even go beyond words

309
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:41,639
this can be our true powerful voice it's

310
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,220
a soul voice that's different

311
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:46,920
your Soul's voice

312
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:50,180
is much more powerful

313
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,180
than any other voice

314
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:55,160
reading out of protocols by the way

315
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,160
someone asked

316
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:08,300
many times the truth spoken on planet

317
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,300
Earth could be flawed

318
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:12,360
is that true

319
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:16,500
can I ask you guys is that true at all

320
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:19,380
many times the truth spoken on planet

321
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:22,680
Earth could be flawed

322
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:26,160
because human nature tends to bend the

323
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:28,380
truth to provide a game and a ledge to

324
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:31,980
hold on to

325
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:33,360
so truth is manipulated and spoiled with

326
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:36,199
deception

327
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,199
is that true

328
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:42,180
many times the truth spoken on this

329
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:44,459
planet Earth could be flawed because of

330
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:45,899
human nature tends to bend the truth to

331
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:48,360
provide a game

332
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:51,000
do people play games

333
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,740
I want to know

334
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,260
are there people out there that love to

335
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:56,699
play games with people's lives or

336
00:15:55,260 --> 00:16:00,199
they're they're people out there that

337
00:15:56,699 --> 00:16:00,199
love to play games in general

338
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:10,320
do people manipulate the truth use it as

339
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:13,380
alleged to hold on to

340
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:15,180
and use truth as deception sure

341
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:18,980
evil

342
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:18,980
takes the term truth

343
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,000
shapeshifts it

344
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:27,380
and uses it as a weapon

345
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:35,760
because that truth is spoiled and filled

346
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:39,120
with deception

347
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:41,399
this is a survival mechanism used by all

348
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,740
walks of life

349
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:46,019
from the bottom tier to the top of the

350
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:49,680
hierarchy

351
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:51,540
your soul holds authentic truth

352
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:54,420
untainted

353
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:56,699
pure regardless of whatever survival

354
00:16:54,420 --> 00:17:00,120
mechanisms we tend to adapt here on

355
00:16:56,699 --> 00:17:03,680
Earth your soul holds the truth

356
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,680
and carries it on

357
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:10,559
your soul holds authentic truth that's

358
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:12,660
the difference all of your souls hold

359
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:16,140
authentic truth that's the difference

360
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:19,620
right there there's no games

361
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:22,860
your soul doesn't play games

362
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:25,079
and your soul doesn't play Truth games

363
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:28,679
your soul

364
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:32,280
has authentic truth

365
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:35,640
pure regardless of whatever survival

366
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:39,059
mechanism she knows survival we tend to

367
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:41,820
adapt to here on Earth your soul

368
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:44,940
knows better

369
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:47,400
your true Soul always knows better and

370
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:51,000
is wiser than the truth games played

371
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:53,760
here on Earth your soul is wiser

372
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,880
than the truth games played here on

373
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,880
Earth

374
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,179
how many times have you heard well no

375
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:02,280
it's truth but it's really just a game

376
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:04,679
and it's not totally true how many times

377
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:07,820
have you heard that out there

378
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:11,880
but your soul

379
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:15,600
supersedes the games in your soul

380
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:18,059
is a light that's more powerful

381
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:21,200
than the games and the deception played

382
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:21,200
here on Earth

383
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:32,520
your true Soul always knows better and

384
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:34,700
is wiser than the truth games played on

385
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,700
Earth

386
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:40,980
inside each of us is this even truer

387
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:44,820
more potent voice than our Earthly voice

388
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:48,539
so inside of us our soul is a more truer

389
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:51,480
and potent voice than her own voice

390
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:53,520
inside of our soul it's much more

391
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:57,840
profound

392
00:18:53,520 --> 00:19:00,059
the true truer voice is elevated above

393
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,220
the voice we know to come from a deep

394
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:05,039
place within

395
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:07,740
because as strong

396
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:11,039
and is important as our true deep

397
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:16,100
Earthly voices because it is important

398
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:16,100
our Earthly voice is important

399
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,039
it can also be mixed with hurt and

400
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:22,919
sorrow

401
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:24,240
and distrust and confusion and

402
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:27,120
misinformation

403
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:30,299
we could have a strong voice down here

404
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:32,940
on planet Earth I see it out there but

405
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:35,640
it could be a strong voice projecting

406
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:38,460
misinformation we can have a strong

407
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:41,039
voice here on planet Earth and we can

408
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:44,400
actually project a strong voice that's

409
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:46,380
of hurt and that's of sorrow and

410
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,360
distrust and confusion and

411
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:49,620
misinformation

412
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:53,460
together

413
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:55,679
the truest voice we possess can never be

414
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:58,140
swayed by trickery and you know what I'm

415
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:01,320
talking about our soul that's different

416
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:04,080
that's an entirely different voice

417
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:07,080
our Soul's voice it can't be persuaded

418
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:10,260
persuaded by misinformation it can't be

419
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:12,660
tricked by misinformation are true true

420
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:16,080
Soul's voice can't be

421
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:19,760
tricked by deceit it resides in all of

422
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,760
us it is your soul

423
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:24,000
and it can't be tampered with by

424
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:26,400
conditioning brainwashing and it can't

425
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,100
be tricked by the sea in misinformation

426
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,080
that's your true soul

427
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:34,080
you can hear somebody's true voice

428
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:36,660
spoken but that doesn't mean it's their

429
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,860
true soul but their true voices is

430
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:40,860
spoken

431
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:43,080
and they could be saying something

432
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:44,520
but it could have misinformation in it

433
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:47,039
of course

434
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:48,900
the games that we're up against and the

435
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:51,419
brainwashing is insane down here in

436
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:54,660
planet Earth but our soul is immune from

437
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:57,919
that completely it's immune from the BS

438
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,919
that we have down here

439
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:05,299
our soul has a sound

440
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:05,299
nobody knew that

441
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:11,220
Spirit of compassion

442
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:13,200
gave me those words when I was in my

443
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:15,120
office

444
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,299
I think it was like three o'clock in the

445
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,299
morning

446
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:25,280
and Spirit of compassion said write this

447
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,280
down

448
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:29,720
I said I'm getting kind of tired

449
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:35,700
I haven't slept

450
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:37,320
I've been writing for hours

451
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:39,980
I said the spirit of compassion it

452
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,980
better be good

453
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:43,740
because I need to go to sleep soon and

454
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:45,000
spirit of compassion said write this

455
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:48,600
down

456
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:53,360
our soul has a sound I wrote that our

457
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:53,360
soul has a sound and then I woke up

458
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:00,720
from a tiredness and I sparked up and I

459
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:04,799
was like what do you mean our soul has a

460
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:07,559
sound what are you talking about

461
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:10,620
his spirit said our soul has a sound a

462
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:13,559
sound we can't hear

463
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:16,140
with our physical ears

464
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:17,940
I was hooked when I heard that

465
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:21,600
an IG

466
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:24,559
sgm [ __ ] says wow I am feeling what you

467
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,559
are saying thank you

468
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:31,200
I sparked up

469
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:34,620
when I heard that

470
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:38,340
my mind was blown

471
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:40,740
that three o'clock early morning

472
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:42,179
when spirit said our soul has a sound a

473
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:45,240
sound we can't hear with their physical

474
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:48,299
ears I was just completely intrigued

475
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:50,700
Beyond and then spirit said a sound that

476
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:53,640
Rings true through time and space and

477
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:57,299
then I realized are you kidding me a

478
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:59,520
sound or Soul has a sound that Rings

479
00:22:57,299 --> 00:23:01,799
through time and space does that have

480
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,539
something to do with the traveling does

481
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:06,179
that have something to do when we die

482
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:10,200
our soul travels through time and space

483
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:14,720
when we die our soul Rises up out of us

484
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,720
and travels through time and space

485
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:23,280
when our soul leaves our physical

486
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:26,900
body and transcends upward

487
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,900
a noise is made

488
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,280
when we die

489
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:36,380
we no longer talk

490
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:44,059
but as our soul leaves our physical body

491
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:44,059
and transcends upward a noise is made

492
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:48,260
a sound

493
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:55,080
the sound is energy

494
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:58,940
and the energy of the soul is powerful

495
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:58,940
a fireball of light

496
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:06,960
as the soul travels the noise is the

497
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:10,940
sound of the Soul

498
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,940
piercing time itself

499
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:20,960
time changes

500
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:20,960
when we pass and our soul leaves us

501
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:29,700
our soul is no longer in the normal

502
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:32,760
time that we know exists

503
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:35,280
and our soul makes noise as its piercing

504
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:38,460
time itself

505
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:42,080
for time no longer exists for the soul

506
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:42,080
once a soul has left the body

507
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:46,799
somebody on IG

508
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:49,820
cat attack says this is so beautiful I'm

509
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,820
getting so emotional

510
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,740
thank you for being here

511
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:57,600
celery Cindy says incredible information

512
00:24:54,740 --> 00:25:00,380
Alexandra says love this thanks for all

513
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,380
this powerful information

514
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:08,700
where our soul goes there is no clock

515
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:11,179
when I heard that from Spirit of

516
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,179
compassion

517
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:17,900
I just couldn't believe it

518
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:17,900
it was so incredible

519
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:24,740
I was ready to write down every word

520
00:25:21,799 --> 00:25:28,919
where our soul goes there is no clock

521
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:31,620
the home our soul goes back to can't be

522
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:34,820
governed by time because time is

523
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,820
different for every planet

524
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:42,419
time is different for every solar system

525
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:46,140
time is different for every Galaxy

526
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:49,320
and if one planet or solar system ceases

527
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:53,220
to exist then time stops for that planet

528
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:57,440
or solar system yet our soul cannot

529
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:57,440
cease to exist is that insane

530
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:05,580
I just want to read that again I when I

531
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:09,059
I have read this not only written the

532
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:12,659
words down but I have read this

533
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:14,760
not only through the editing process

534
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:17,279
of putting the book together

535
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:19,799
I have read that so many times and I

536
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:21,900
still I'm still Blown Away

537
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:24,480
where our soul goes there is no clock

538
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:26,159
the home our soul goes back to can't be

539
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,080
governed by time because time is

540
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:30,480
different for every planet every solar

541
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,820
system and every Galaxy and if one

542
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,559
planet or solar system ceases to exist

543
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:37,320
Does that mean their soul ceases to

544
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:39,960
exist no of course not then time stops

545
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:42,840
for that planet or solar system yet our

546
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:45,779
soul cannot cease to exist this Earth

547
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:47,100
can blow up this solar system can get

548
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:50,760
trashed

549
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:53,520
by a massive meteorite or asteroid

550
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:57,240
heading our way it could annihilate the

551
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:59,580
entire solar system there are asteroids

552
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:02,039
out there that are bigger than the Sun

553
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:04,440
that could actually drive through a

554
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:06,299
solar system and destroy it and break it

555
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,919
apart and crush it and the solar system

556
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:10,679
won't exist anymore

557
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:15,000
time stops in that solar system the

558
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:17,640
minute the sun explodes or dies out and

559
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,919
all the planets break apart you have to

560
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:23,299
know that there is no planets going

561
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:23,299
around the Sun anymore

562
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:30,360
that is what time is

563
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:32,580
the planet circling around the Sun

564
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:34,500
if an asteroid came through the solar

565
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:36,840
system and destroyed every planet there

566
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:38,940
is no time anymore in that solar system

567
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:41,460
but yet if you are on the planet Earth

568
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:43,679
when that solar when that asteroid came

569
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:45,900
through and destroyed the planet your

570
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:48,720
soul your physical body would die but

571
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:51,059
your soul would not die that means your

572
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,400
soul isn't governed by time do you know

573
00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:55,080
what I mean like when when I heard that

574
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:57,000
information from Spirit of compassion it

575
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:59,159
was mind-blowing your Soul's got

576
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,559
governed by time

577
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:03,480
that means if the solar system is

578
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:06,440
crushed

579
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,440
by anything

580
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:12,120
our soul is in governed by time in that

581
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:14,520
solar system because it never was

582
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:16,919
governed by time anyway that means we're

583
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:18,840
governed by the clock every day I had to

584
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:21,960
come on here at certain time of day to

585
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:24,779
talk to you guys we're governed by time

586
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:27,440
but our soul isn't completely off the

587
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:27,440
time scale

588
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:34,860
our soul needs to live on and it does

589
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:36,360
without the constraints of time

590
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:39,360
time

591
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:43,100
has no bearing upon our souls

592
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:43,100
our souls are that powerful

593
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:48,179
I don't think anybody realizes how

594
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,640
powerful their soul really is if time

595
00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:52,880
itself has no constraints against our

596
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,880
soul

597
00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:59,100
so then Spirit of compassion went on and

598
00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:03,260
said our soul is an energy force that

599
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:03,260
isn't conquered by what's here on Earth

600
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,900
it's all about conquering on planet

601
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:09,720
Earth

602
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:11,580
it's like that on social media one one

603
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:15,120
influencer wants to conquer the other

604
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:17,159
one one uh one Health Guru wants to

605
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:21,380
conquer the other

606
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:21,380
one company wants to conquer the other

607
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,960
right

608
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:27,000
everybody wants to conquer something

609
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,399
here on Earth

610
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,620
one evil government wants to conquer

611
00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:33,600
another evil government what every

612
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:36,240
single thing is about conquering on

613
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:38,779
planet Earth that's all it is conquer

614
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,779
conquer

615
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:43,559
our soul is an energy force that isn't

616
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:46,919
conquered by what happens here on Earth

617
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:49,320
how do you like that our soul

618
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:52,440
can't get conquered

619
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:55,380
by all of the competition and games

620
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:57,659
played here on planet Earth your soul is

621
00:29:55,380 --> 00:30:00,080
free from that it can't be conquered on

622
00:29:57,659 --> 00:30:00,080
any level

623
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:06,840
it is a universal

624
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:09,899
oh this is incredible right here the

625
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:12,020
spirit Spirit of compassion just

626
00:30:09,899 --> 00:30:15,120
foreign

627
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:18,140
compassion always

628
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,140
says God

629
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:22,279
and mentions God

630
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:27,240
it is a universal

631
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:29,940
god-conceived law

632
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:31,860
that her soul has it right and safely

633
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:35,460
right even if our Consciousness

634
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:38,399
connected to our brain has it wrong

635
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:41,480
when Spirit of compassion told me that

636
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:41,480
line itself

637
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:46,740
I mean how

638
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:48,600
our soul is an energy force that isn't

639
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:51,779
conquered by what happens here on Earth

640
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:54,360
it is a universal God conceived the law

641
00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:57,000
that our soul has

642
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:58,980
it right and safely right even if our

643
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Consciousness connected to our brain has

644
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:02,000
it completely wrong

645
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:07,740
and here's one of my favorite parts

646
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:10,679
of this scripture

647
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:12,960
because Spirit of compassion

648
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:16,700
doesn't write Health books

649
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,700
Spirit of compassion writes scripture

650
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:23,120
wrong cannot enter and destroy a soul

651
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:32,340
that means if a missile blows

652
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:36,779
people up

653
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:38,340
it still cannot enter and destroy a soul

654
00:31:36,779 --> 00:31:41,279
that means if you've been hurt or

655
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:42,720
betrayed it still cannot destroy your

656
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:45,240
soul

657
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:48,779
what really matters in the end

658
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:52,200
is the truth of our soul

659
00:31:48,779 --> 00:31:54,419
because it is our forever existence

660
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,860
forever

661
00:31:54,419 --> 00:31:57,960
ever

662
00:31:55,860 --> 00:32:00,620
amen

663
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,620
forever

664
00:32:00,659 --> 00:32:07,020
because it is our forever existence and

665
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:10,919
overrides what we are

666
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:12,960
and we're here in life on Earth so

667
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:15,659
whatever we were here

668
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:18,360
in life here on Earth whatever we were

669
00:32:15,659 --> 00:32:21,240
it doesn't matter

670
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:26,720
the soul overrides that

671
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:26,720
and continues to exist no matter what

672
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:33,120
and I got a quote in here our soul has a

673
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:35,580
sound a sound we can't hear with our

674
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:38,760
physical ears sound that Rings true

675
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:40,500
through time and space

676
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:44,640
we're doing the wisdom and intuition

677
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:49,919

678
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:52,140
feels they have something special

679
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:53,880
if you don't feel that way you should

680
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:55,260
that you have something special inside

681
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:57,179
of you

682
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:58,799
if you're someone that doesn't feel like

683
00:32:57,179 --> 00:33:03,679
you have

684
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:06,000

meditations if you're somebody and

762
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,700
you're actually meditating you're

763
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:17,339
practicing meditation and you want the

764
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:20,040
most out of that meditation this is the

765
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:22,020
shot you should make every single day if

766
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:23,640
you meditate every single day you should

767
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:26,460
be using the wisdom and intuition

768
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:29,220
stabilizer every single day to help you

769
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:31,400
with your meditations

770
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,400
foreign

771
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:37,560
I don't own all the grocery stores in

772
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,960
this in this country

773
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:41,460
and around the world so when you go by

774
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,900
stage at the grocery store I don't get a

775
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:44,880
cut

776
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:46,079
if you buy yellow squash and some

777
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,359
blackberries at the grocery store I

778
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:50,400
don't get a cut

779
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:53,660
it's important to know like this is a

780
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,660
tool that's there for you

781
00:36:55,980 --> 00:37:02,359
Laura says we Are Spiritual Beings

782
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:02,359
having a physical experience

783
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:09,420
Lana says would that mean that even

784
00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:11,579
Hitler's Soul has is right

785
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:13,859
I'll do if you know what I hear so much

786
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:15,540
stuff about Hitler on and off throughout

787
00:37:13,859 --> 00:37:17,880
the years of course

788
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:19,680
a lot of people say that Hitler's Hitler

789
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:21,079
wasn't a bad person

790
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,940
they're wrong

791
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:25,980
a lot of people say he was just he was

792
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:28,619
just kind of staring you know you know

793
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:30,960
he's in the wrong course his journey was

794
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:32,700
not right things like that you know

795
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,380
people but there's a lot of

796
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:37,859
misinformation about Hitler out there

797
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:39,420
people say that he was good he was not

798
00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:41,820
who's evil

799
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:43,980
but I'm gonna do a podcast eventually

800
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:45,720
talking about like good and evil and how

801
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:48,800
that works and how that works with with

802
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,800
souls and everything else

803
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:56,940
okay and then

804
00:37:52,859 --> 00:37:58,920
use the wisdom and intuition stabilizer

805
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:01,859
if you're trying to gain sight and

806
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:04,619
vision through your third eye

807
00:38:01,859 --> 00:38:06,000
to see what others cannot see now you

808
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:07,980

809
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,960
have to call it your third eye

810
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:11,960
you can call it anything you want

811
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:16,920
it's just that people recognize it as

812
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,839
the third eye right that's what they

813
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:20,700
recognize

814
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:23,240
that they feel their Consciousness is

815
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,240
here right

816
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:28,980

instead of yellow squash please can we

864
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:34,880
use green zucchini yellow squash in

865
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:34,880
Europe is not easy to get

866
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:41,520
you can try a um a green one it's not

867
00:40:38,579 --> 00:40:42,960

specifically in the yellow squash

877
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:12,320
that helps

878
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:12,320

00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:06,300
mistake in my life I'm having problems

901
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:08,940
trusting I've been injured before with

902
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:10,680
trusting so what do I do and then so

903
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:13,320
that's when the wisdom and intuition

904
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:15,839

down and take because it can help give

906
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:20,040
you some clarity before you're going

907
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:22,460
into something or before you're doing

908
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,460
something

909
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,820
foreign

910
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:32,940
says no you can get Frozen yellow squash

911
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:35,099
in Europe

912
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:38,220
oh sir you can't get Frozen yellow

913
00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:41,040
squash in Europe you're saying

914
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:42,300
I would try the green one

915
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,760
I would

916
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:46,980
and then keep everything up Joe what I

917
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:48,720
would do though if you do the green

918
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:50,640
squash

919
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,839
but you can't find blackberries and then

920
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,280
now you're trying to use raspberries

921
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:54,480
then that that's getting too far off

922
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:58,380
course

923
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:59,819
or if you can't find Oregano

924
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:02,099
um but you're using Rosemary or

925
00:42:59,819 --> 00:43:04,740
something you just you can't really go

926
00:43:02,099 --> 00:43:06,720
off course too much

927
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:08,040
you have to it just has to be that day

928
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,960
where

929
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:12,180
you know and the wheatgrass can be

930
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:15,060
frozen I have a frozen option right here

931
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:17,819
it's on medicalmedium.com's directory

932
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:19,440
supplement directory magaloon.com that's

933
00:43:17,819 --> 00:43:21,720
the Frozen one right there that I'm

934
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:25,380
using because I don't have any of the

935
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:28,859
fresh grass in the moment

936
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:31,440
Iona says I buy my yellow squash online

937
00:43:28,859 --> 00:43:34,160

all right guys

940
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:41,359
I think we can start making this shot

941
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,359
that's what I think

942
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:49,220
I'm gonna move things over a little bit

943
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:49,220
here

944
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:57,300
will it still work if you're missing

945
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:01,800
ingredients

946
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:03,720
the question is is it s like ingredients

947
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:05,339
because if you're missing ingredients

948
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:08,280
then no it won't work

949
00:44:05,339 --> 00:44:09,780
it won't work I just won't so we're

950
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:12,180
gonna come back says it won't work if

951
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:14,220
you're missing ingredients maybe if you

952
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:15,420
switch out like an ingredient to

953
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:18,000
something that's still in the same

954
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:20,520
family we might be able to skate by like

955
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,800
a green squash on this one but if you're

956
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:24,800
missing ingredients in these Branch out

957
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:27,119
therapies and you're doing plural

958
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,319
ingredients then no it's not going to

959
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:30,720
work

960
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:33,180
it might partially work

961
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:35,099
it might work a little bit but it's not

962
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:37,260
going to work work like the kind of

963
00:44:35,099 --> 00:44:40,020
effects people are getting like the

964
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:42,000
miraculous stuff that's happening that

965
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:44,819
is that is really specific to what's

966
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,400
going on with what you need I mean I

967
00:44:44,819 --> 00:44:49,920
wish it was more versatile but that's

968
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:51,660
not how this medicine works

969
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:54,359
foreign

970
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:56,520
can the wheatgrass be powder and the

971
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:59,240
Doom says nope it can't has to be frozen

972
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:59,240
or fresh

973
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,880
and

974
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:08,480
um but yeah it would have to be frozen

975
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:08,480
or fresh

976
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:14,280

fire up the machine let's see if we can

980
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,599
do this

981
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:25,160
let's go

982
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:25,160
Soul talks really deep

983
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:29,099
God blows my mind I mean I'm still I

984
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:31,200
don't know about you guys but I'm still

985
00:45:29,099 --> 00:45:32,700
kind of like mind blown from that

986
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:35,640
information

987
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:37,560
I mean I was just like you feel it

988
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:39,240
through your whole body and my mind just

989
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:42,420
is like what

990
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:44,460
it's incredible all right

991
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:46,260
let's start out

992
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:48,119
um

993
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:50,099
I'm gonna I'm gonna add the wild

994
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:52,140
blueberry juice

995
00:45:50,099 --> 00:45:54,060
probably a little later it says start

996
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:56,400
out with one tablespoon of fresher

997
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:58,319
thawed frozen wild blueberries you can

998
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,180
do a powder or you can do the juice I

999
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:02,220
have the juice handy which is which is

1000
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:04,319
really fun

1001
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:07,260
says one teaspoon of wild blueberry

1002
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:09,720
juice okay now I could drop it into the

1003
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:11,040
my juicer here I could drop it in it'll

1004
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:12,780
go right through the screen so that's

1005
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:14,700
fine you might have a juicer it doesn't

1006
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:16,579
work that way so you might want to put

1007
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:19,680
it into your container instead

1008
00:46:16,579 --> 00:46:21,240
fairytales.com says is wheatgrass okay

1009
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:23,220
for people

1010
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:25,140
who are many years ago diagnosed with a

1011
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:28,380
wheat allergy before gluten-free

1012
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:30,119
movement yes it's it that's what's right

1013
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:32,700
for your doctor but I've recommend it to

1014
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:34,619
family friends and and other doctor

1015
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:38,000
friends that I know that it's okay

1016
00:46:34,619 --> 00:46:38,000
because it is gluten free

1017
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:46,020
so I'm adding a little bit of that

1018
00:46:43,579 --> 00:46:47,760
down in there you don't have to put it

1019
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:49,079
in here you can add it to your container

1020
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,119
I'm just putting it right through

1021
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:52,500
because this kind of tissue you can do

1022
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:56,040
that

1023
00:46:52,500 --> 00:47:00,440
all right next one is quarter cup fresh

1024
00:46:56,040 --> 00:47:00,440
or thawed frozen blackberries

1025
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:09,599
these are frozen and they picked them a

1026
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:12,240
little early but they still work

1027
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:15,119
so the company that froze these

1028
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:19,560
blackberries did pick them

1029
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:24,420
what seems to be about a week too early

1030
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:26,760
for my berry picking expertise

1031
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:29,119
so I'm dropping in a quarter of a cup of

1032
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,119
these

1033
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:33,180
you guys don't mind

1034
00:47:31,619 --> 00:47:34,859
nice

1035
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:38,060
all right so after that quarter cup

1036
00:47:34,859 --> 00:47:38,060
tightly packed Sage

1037
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:48,740
Sage is so strong I'll tell you so I'm

1038
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:48,740
making sure I get this in here

1039
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:52,339
it is so strong

1040
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:02,960
so I'm dropping in a quarter cup in

1041
00:47:59,819 --> 00:48:02,960
there should be about that

1042
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:12,740
pretty incredible really all of it is

1043
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:12,740
quarter cup tightly packed oregano

1044
00:48:12,839 --> 00:48:15,980
here's my oregano

1045
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:21,480
now there's some big stems on here I'm

1046
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:23,460
trying to get the big stems kind of away

1047
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:25,760
a little bit they're really strong these

1048
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:25,760
stems

1049
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:35,940
you can get the leaves off the stems if

1050
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:39,260
you want

1051
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:39,260
um if the stems are too thick

1052
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:47,180
okay

1053
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:50,720
it's really potent stuff

1054
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:56,760
the mm-1500 is incredible it's just

1055
00:48:54,180 --> 00:49:00,240
coming out like so it's coming out dry

1056
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:02,220
right that drive hope look at that

1057
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:03,720
other juicers don't do that that's how

1058
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:05,520
you save money with the food costs going

1059
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:09,180
up you guys know you know how the mm

1060
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:11,640
1500 works it's only the 1500 and 900.

1061
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:13,619
okay that's why I've endorsed these guys

1062
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:15,300
because it's saving people money if I

1063
00:49:13,619 --> 00:49:18,420
can save people money every day while

1064
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:20,819
they're juicing then I endorse it 100

1065
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:24,000
and you know it's it's incredible

1066
00:49:20,819 --> 00:49:25,560
and it's 20 off right now it's insane

1067
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,420
just letting you guys know all right so

1068
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:30,240
I got the oregano in there

1069
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:32,520
now I'm gonna go with the wheatgrass

1070
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:36,200
two teaspoons

1071
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:36,200
some wheatgrass juice in there

1072
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:43,319
you can add it at the end

1073
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,940
I think I'm supposed to add it in the

1074
00:49:43,319 --> 00:49:48,800
end but I threw it in there all right

1075
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:48,800
let's go and then half cup

1076
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:52,040

00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,440
gonna put in at the end

1084
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:44,460

00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:05,040
been trying this one at all in general

1091
00:51:02,339 --> 00:51:08,579
not outside of the of the brain shot

1092
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:11,540

00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:24,680

00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:31,740
how's that possible

1099
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:35,819

where I forgot to have my

1101
00:51:35,819 --> 00:51:40,859

I have a voice that tells me

1140
00:53:24,119 --> 00:53:29,060

have you guys

1154
00:54:14,099 --> 00:54:18,660
have you guys done this one before I

1155
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:20,839
noticed that

1156
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:20,839
foreign

1157
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:27,780
I noticed that

1158
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,460
it hits me after the fact the hardest I

1159
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:32,400
feel a little something during it but it

1160
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:34,920
hits me after the fact the hardest

1161
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:36,180
like after taking it after administering

1162
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:38,460
it

1163
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:40,319
so with me every time I do the wisdom

1164
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:41,940
and intuition

1165
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:46,020
brain shot

1166
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:48,240
it hits me like 10 minutes later

1167
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:50,700
5-10 minutes later

1168
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:52,380
and as each minute goes on it starts

1169
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:55,740
coming over me it starts coming over me

00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:57,599

and see I would love to share it if we

00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:16,800
can incredible but it comes over me

1180
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:18,059
so if you're gonna do a meditation if

1181
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:19,500
you're gonna do yoga if you're going to

1182
00:55:18,059 --> 00:55:21,540
do any kind of spiritual practice or

1183
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:22,500
whatever it is make sure when you take

1184
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:25,140
this

1185
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:26,819
that you wait a few minutes before you

1186
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:28,740
start that yoga before you start that

1187
00:55:26,819 --> 00:55:31,859
meditation just wait a few minutes let

1188
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:35,300
it just ride in and just and and take

1189
00:55:31,859 --> 00:55:35,300
over like that's what I would do

1190
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:41,460
how much is that juicer Brooklyn asks

1191
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:47,599
what's the name this is the mm-1500 from

1192
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:49,380
Omega so Omega o-m-e-g-a this is the m

1193
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:50,640
1500

1194
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:53,040
right

1195
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:55,380
and it saves it saves people money which

1196
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:57,300
is incredible

1197
00:55:55,380 --> 00:56:00,180
um Priya says you're such a good guy

1198
00:55:57,300 --> 00:56:02,180
with a heart they don't make M like you

1199
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:04,980
anymore they don't make me like anymore

1200
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:07,380
what you notice about what the juicer

1201
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:08,819
saving money is critical with food right

1202
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:10,680
now so what you're going to notice that

1203
00:56:08,819 --> 00:56:12,500
you won't see with the basket juicers

1204
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:15,359
and the centrifuge juicers and all those

1205
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:17,460
those are those you just pour money away

1206
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:19,800
you just throw money away you just burn

1207
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:23,400
you burn your dollars away

1208
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:25,140
this right here you buy less produce

1209
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:27,059
so it's a cold masticating juicer but

1210
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:29,460
that's not the key right that's part of

1211
00:56:27,059 --> 00:56:31,500
the key so your nutrients are definitely

1212
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:33,300
preserved which is incredible but the

1213
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:35,700
difference here is the high compression

1214
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:36,960
so what you're noticing right there with

1215
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:39,240
the pull

1216
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:41,760
is you're noticing it's dry you see that

1217
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:43,680
if you've ever Juiced before just before

1218
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:45,540
you'll notice that you you'll never

1219
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:47,400
there's no juicer like those basket

1220
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:49,680
juicers it's just like you got to be

1221
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:51,240
rich to be running those at the rate of

1222
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:53,339
juicing every day that's just for

1223
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:54,480
someone who juices like once every six

1224
00:56:53,339 --> 00:56:55,319
months and pulls it out of their

1225
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:57,240
cupboard

1226
00:56:55,319 --> 00:56:59,880
but if you're going to juice for like

1227
00:56:57,240 --> 00:57:01,980
medically reasons medical reasons you

1228
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:03,180
need something to save money and the

1229
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:05,579
warranty

1230
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:09,300
the warranty is insane this is why I

1231
00:57:05,579 --> 00:57:12,480
endorse these guys 15 years on Parts in

1232
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:15,119
powertrain plus okay there's a hotline

1233
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:17,720
an mm hotline 2 at Omega so I'm just

1234
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:21,059
letting you know what's up

1235
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:23,640
I'm gonna send this one down now I'm I'm

1236
00:57:21,059 --> 00:57:25,440
feeling all kinds of funny feelings

1237
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:27,119
and and you know what's we know what's

1238
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,380
crazy is that in the medical medium

1239
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:32,220
community

1240
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:34,440
people juice like no one has ever Juiced

1241
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:37,020
like no one has ever Juiced in any

1242
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:39,240
communities and these are the juicers I

1243
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:41,280
can endorse because they can take a

1244
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:44,640
beating not cut if you put a spinning

1245
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:46,140
basket juicer or a centrifuge juicer or

1246
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:47,819
those other juicers through the kind of

1247
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:49,500
abuse that the medical medium Community

1248
00:57:47,819 --> 00:57:51,119
creates on the juicers they wouldn't

1249
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:53,400
survive and they don't have the

1250
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:56,780
warranties after two years

1251
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:58,859
and um and so it's it's not just juicing

1252
00:57:56,780 --> 00:58:00,660
once a day in the medical medium

1253
00:57:58,859 --> 00:58:03,960
Community introduces like all day long

1254
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:05,460
many people so it's not just juice right

1255
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:06,839
um it's not just like juicing for a week

1256
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:08,339
and then you put your juicer on the

1257
00:58:06,839 --> 00:58:10,740
Shelf somewhere it's not just you juice

1258
00:58:08,339 --> 00:58:13,500
for a month the medical meme Community

1259
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:16,079
juices constantly and there's a big

1260
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:17,940
difference huge difference right so

1261
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:20,280
people get sold into juicing for a

1262
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:22,380
minute hey it's January it's like New

1263
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:24,420
Year's resolutions I'm gonna do some

1264
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:26,700
juicing they go and buy something that

1265
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:28,800
looks fun and easy to use that you know

1266
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:29,760
whatever affiliate program crap or

1267
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:31,260
whatever it is and they get those

1268
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:32,460
spinning basket juicers and what happens

1269
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:34,140
is

1270
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:37,619
they just use it for a little while and

1271
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:39,900
put it away and when you're using it for

1272
00:58:37,619 --> 00:58:42,180
medical medicinal reasons

1273
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:45,180
and you're dumping in a lot of money

1274
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:47,160
into your produce you want to save money

1275
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:49,200
and what this machine does in the 900s

1276
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:50,940
it pays for itself over and over again I

1277
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:53,460
have to say it because it's still so

1278
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:55,260
cool it's just like a car

1279
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:56,700
you put wear and tear and miles on the

1280
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:59,700
car you're going to break apart once in

1281
00:58:56,700 --> 00:59:02,640
a while but the difference is the parts

1282
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:06,059
are warranted for 15 years on the

1283
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:08,819
mm-1500 and mm-900 which is insane and

1284
00:59:06,059 --> 00:59:10,619
look at this take a loose that's your

1285
00:59:08,819 --> 00:59:12,900
pulp

1286
00:59:10,619 --> 00:59:14,819
I saw the spinning basket juicer thing I

1287
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:16,680
saw one online people using it and I've

1288
00:59:14,819 --> 00:59:17,460
even used it just to just to test for

1289
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:19,920
fun

1290
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:21,900
and all it does is spit out wet pulp

1291
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:23,400
everywhere you throw away money you got

1292
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:25,260
to be rich to do that every single day

1293
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:27,359
you're gonna need like

1294
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:28,799
I don't know 200 in produce a day or

1295
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:30,359
something sick or something you want to

1296
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:32,280
juice that much you'll be just putting

1297
00:59:30,359 --> 00:59:34,680
everything in like blah blah blah it's

1298
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:36,720
like a monster just feeding a money

1299
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:38,700
Monster look at this

1300
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:41,040
that's insane

1301
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:43,319
Huntress Divine says aw I went through a

1302
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:45,200
rough time in the last five weeks and

1303
00:59:43,319 --> 00:59:48,299
all of the brain shots helped me through

1304
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:50,520
yeah but this shot is my favorite of

1305
00:59:48,299 --> 00:59:53,040
them all this shot

1306
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:54,599
is one of my favorites too

1307
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:56,400
this shot is definitely one of my

1308
00:59:54,599 --> 00:59:57,359
favorites by far incredible and by the

1309
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:59,819
way

1366
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:17,460
um but

1367
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:20,640
that's what I would recommend a friend

1368
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:22,500
ask your doctor what's right for you

1369
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:24,720
see what your doctor says if he says

1370
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:28,140
it's okay then you can do it Alexandra

feel my brain calming more and more I

1377
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:44,579
have to tell you and the thing is is

1378
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:45,780
when I when I get more than one shot out

1379
01:02:44,579 --> 01:02:48,599
of it

1380
01:02:45,780 --> 01:02:50,400
right and and it's like I wait a little

1381
01:02:48,599 --> 01:02:51,839
while and it's coming over me and

1382
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:54,619
everything and then I say you know what

1383
01:02:51,839 --> 01:02:54,619
I'm gonna do it again

1384
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:59,540
bartender give me another

1385
01:02:59,819 --> 01:03:04,500
and then it actually compiles on itself

1386
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:08,460
and all of a sudden it's like a whole

1387
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:10,799
nother ride a whole nother ride

1388
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:13,079
it's just incredible

1389
01:03:10,799 --> 01:03:14,280
can you guys feel that are you doing the

1390
01:03:13,079 --> 01:03:16,140
shot right now

1391
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:18,660
did you just do it right are you feeling

1392
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:20,579
that like

1393
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:22,140
I never felt like that from anything

1394
01:03:20,579 --> 01:03:24,619
like these brain shots this is

1395
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:24,619
unbelievable

1396
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:31,319
Amy Teeter says

1397
01:03:28,619 --> 01:03:33,299
I keep blowing out the green washer on

1398
01:03:31,319 --> 01:03:35,700
my G screen I've replaced it 30 times

1399
01:03:33,299 --> 01:03:37,980
how do we avoid doing this I wonder why

1400
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:40,680
because I've never blown mine out once

1401
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:42,660
so what I would do is

1402
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:45,000
Amy so what I would do is I would call

1403
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:47,099
them on the mm hotline and ask them

1404
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,420
maybe there's another part they need to

1405
01:03:47,099 --> 01:03:50,099
replace

1406
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:51,960
that maybe there's another part they

1407
01:03:50,099 --> 01:03:53,579
need to replace in here that they

1408
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:55,380
because it's warrantied

1409
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:57,720
and that might take care of it because

1410
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:59,160
I've never blocked I mean I've I've beat

1411
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:01,319
the crap

1412
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:04,140
out of my MMS

1413
01:04:01,319 --> 01:04:06,480
I mean I've I actually feel bad I've

1414
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:08,160
I've totally

1415
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:11,940
totally just

1416
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:14,819
beat these to death these MMS and

1417
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:17,220
and I never had the green the green

1418
01:04:14,819 --> 01:04:20,160
washer pop out so what I'm thinking is

1419
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:23,400
talk to them and say look is it another

1420
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:27,839
part that might be doing that

1421
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:31,799
so and it just needs to be fixed

1422
01:04:27,839 --> 01:04:33,660
Reggie Natura says I burned down

1423
01:04:31,799 --> 01:04:36,119
what

1424
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:38,760
Reggie says I burned down four juicers

1425
01:04:36,119 --> 01:04:41,520
before my medical medium 900. oh yeah

1426
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:44,819
let me tell you something okay

1427
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:47,220
before the mm 900 and 1500 I had to use

1428
01:04:44,819 --> 01:04:49,319
all the crappy juicers like everybody

1429
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:51,680
has to had to right

1430
01:04:49,319 --> 01:04:54,660
and I

1431
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:57,660
destroyed those juicers

1432
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:59,880
I I mean every brand you name it every

1433
01:04:57,660 --> 01:05:02,700
brand I destroyed annihilated they

1434
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:05,099
cannot hold up to it plus the cost of

1435
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:07,220
juicing was insane

1436
01:05:05,099 --> 01:05:07,220
um

1437
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:10,920
so that's important to know that that

1438
01:05:09,299 --> 01:05:12,780
the difference has been going on one

1439
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:14,819

1492
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:32,579

1501

01:07:57,599 --> 01:08:03,900
the stubborn colds and flus RSV and C

1503
01:08:01,079 --> 01:08:06,920
and flu and everything else make sure

1504
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:09,839
you have your cold and flu tool kit

1505
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:11,839
seriously I'm seeing people suffer out

1506
01:08:09,839 --> 01:08:14,400
there it's sad they're suffering

1507
01:08:11,839 --> 01:08:17,100
unnecessarily it's awful make sure you

1508
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:20,100
download this at medicalmedium.com

1509
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:21,540
it's so important to make sure you do

1510
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:23,279
that

1511
01:08:21,540 --> 01:08:25,679
Sherry Weaver says I had the green

1512
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:26,880
washer pop out before then I looked at

1513
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:31,020
it

1514
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:32,880
I looked at it a shade put it back in

1515
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:35,279
backwards so you're putting that a lot

1516
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:37,500
of people put it in backwards

1517
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:39,540
a lot of people pop it put it in

1518
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:41,640
backwards and that's why it pops out too

1519
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:43,620
so that that maybe that's what it is

1520
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:48,960
because I never had to pop out on me

1521
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:51,420
make sure you have this in your pantry

1522
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:52,380
because it's worth it every time a

1523
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:55,259
friend

1524
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:57,060
gives me a text reaches out to me and

1525
01:08:55,259 --> 01:08:59,279
says I caught the flu

1526
01:08:57,060 --> 01:09:02,100
I go okay well you got all your stuff

1527
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:05,160
right and they're like no

1528
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:07,319
I'm like okay well great because now

1529
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:09,719
you're sick and you have to you have to

1530
01:09:07,319 --> 01:09:11,339
get your stuff maytal says how do I

1531
01:09:09,719 --> 01:09:13,380
convince one of my family members to

1532
01:09:11,339 --> 01:09:15,600
keep the 900 juicer

1533
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:17,339
they don't get the idea that it works

1534
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:19,199
slower purposely because it's cold

1535
01:09:17,339 --> 01:09:21,960
pressed masticating juicer to preserve

1536
01:09:19,199 --> 01:09:23,580
nutrients that's why we have done celery

1537
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:25,980
juice over the last four years what

1538
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:27,540
happens is the ones that go quicker are

1539
01:09:25,980 --> 01:09:28,980
throwing out all the juice so it's

1540
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:31,259
costing more that's number one number

1541
01:09:28,980 --> 01:09:33,540
two it's scorching the juice you're

1542
01:09:31,259 --> 01:09:35,699
losing nutrients with the other juicers

1543
01:09:33,540 --> 01:09:38,040
that's how it works you lose the

1544
01:09:35,699 --> 01:09:39,719
nutrients with the other juicers

1545
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:41,759
right someone just said what's that

1546
01:09:39,719 --> 01:09:43,920
Anatomy dummy back there

1547
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:45,420
okay

1548
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:47,520
um make sure for cold and flu and

1549
01:09:45,420 --> 01:09:49,920
everything you are prepared because

1550
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:52,020
another round comes around and comes

1551
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:55,679
around there's going to be easy two more

1552
01:09:52,020 --> 01:09:57,600

1553
01:09:55,679 --> 01:09:59,460
flu coming around
