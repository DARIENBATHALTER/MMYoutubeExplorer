[0.20 - 5.76] and then never been right since you know
[3.44 - 8.44] dizziness balance issues even like
[5.76 - 10.24] ringing in the ears ttis have you ever
[8.44 - 13.28] bumped your head really hard getting
[10.24 - 15.16] into your car boom or getting out of
[13.28 - 17.20] your car boom or cleaning your car and
[15.16 - 20.08] you're get the back of your head even if
[17.20 - 22.52] it's a small hit right or say in the
[20.08 - 25.72] kitchen somewhere or you slip boom bang
[22.52 - 27.36] the back of your head or something just
[25.72 - 29.16] happens where something whaps you in the
[27.36 - 31.28] head who knows what it is that just
[29.16 - 33.20] something waps you in the head right how
[31.28 - 36.76] many people have had concussions mild
[33.20 - 38.96] concussions super uber Uber Uber mild
[36.76 - 41.96] concussions where they're so mild they
[38.96 - 43.48] don't even know it and then it lingers
[41.96 - 45.16] and lingers and lingers and lingers and
[43.48 - 47.88] lingers we're talking about headbanging
[45.16 - 50.24] that's right we're doing that today why
[47.88 - 52.28] because there's a crap ton of people
[50.24 - 55.08] walking into walls bumping their heads
[52.28 - 56.60] everywhere and for years I've always
[55.08 - 57.76] gotten calls like I just bang my head
[56.60 - 60.04] really hard do I need to go to the
[57.76 - 61.92] hospital I just bang my head really hard
[60.04 - 63.64] I'm scared I can't fall asleep at night
[61.92 - 66.40] if I fall asleep I'll never wake up I'll
[63.64 - 68.44] die I bang my head so hard I got an egg
[66.40 - 70.72] on there it's like a pounding egg on
[68.44 - 73.00] there what do I do oh my child banged
[70.72 - 75.16] their head my my daughter slipped on the
[73.00 - 76.96] floor banged her head my son banged his
[75.16 - 79.24] head on the table like I've heard it all
[76.96 - 81.36] forever for years and years and years so
[79.24 - 83.64] what are we talking about headbanging
[81.36 - 85.00] we're talking about concussions too like
[83.64 - 88.72] what about the concussion you get into a
[85.00 - 90.88] car accident and then you are struggling
[88.72 - 92.52] and suffering with like chronic illness
[90.88 - 94.64] for the rest of your life when you were
[92.52 - 96.08] fine like you were fine now you're
[94.64 - 97.12] diagnosed with fibromyalgia you're
[96.08 - 98.80] diagnosed with this and then you're
[97.12 - 99.80] diagnosed with lime and then you're
[98.80 - 102.60] diagnosed with that and then you're
[99.80 - 105.68] diagn it's just crazy how it works and
[102.60 - 108.08] then there's so much more to it than
[105.68 - 110.80] just this as well there's a lot more but
[108.08 - 113.40] so many people
[110.80 - 114.56] struggle and they struggle what H they
[113.40 - 116.04] struggle when they go through some kind
[114.56 - 118.04] of Crisis what about sports injuries
[116.04 - 120.28] that's another thing well I was playing
[118.04 - 122.36] High School football and gotten to a
[120.28 - 124.68] concussion issue boom and it was just
[122.36 - 126.52] lingering and lingering there's a lot of
[124.68 - 127.52] people who have struggled so many times
[126.52 - 130.40] and then we're going to talk about like
[127.52 - 131.92] good things for it good things for it
[130.40 - 133.20] you Bang Your Head okay you're somebody
[131.92 - 136.16] like I'm not going to get a concussion
[133.20 - 138.76] don't say that don't say that might be
[136.16 - 141.28] somebody that's like I don't remember
[138.76 - 142.64] the last time I banged my head but
[141.28 - 143.64] people do and they do it all the time
[142.64 - 146.80] another thing we're talking about is
[143.64 - 147.84] white lung white lung again a little bit
[146.80 - 150.72] right
[147.84 - 154.48] pneumonia I'm trying to l everybody know
[150.72 - 157.00] that is coming to town and it's a
[154.48 - 158.48] it's a wave where everybody in the
[157.00 - 161.36] family is going to be coughing their
[158.48 - 166.04] guts out I've been trying to tell you
[161.36 - 167.72] the media is keeping it quiet under WPS
[166.04 - 170.48] right cuz right now what's happening
[167.72 - 173.88] there's the flu that's going around SE
[170.48 - 175.68] is going around too right so that's
[173.88 - 177.76] going around right now already so people
[175.68 - 180.32] already caught their so-called colds
[177.76 - 181.84] they already caught their so-called flu
[180.32 - 184.24] depending on what was happening maybe it
[181.84 - 185.84] was C maybe it was flu maybe it was C
[184.24 - 187.80] maybe it was flu maybe they got tested
[185.84 - 190.00] and it didn't come up a c but then it
[187.80 - 192.76] did later like whatever's going on the
[190.00 - 197.08] point I'm trying to say is on top of all
[192.76 - 199.24] the so-called colds flu RSV right and
[197.08 - 200.84] all of that right now white lungs coming
[199.24 - 203.20] into the town on top of it and it's
[200.84 - 203.20] going to be
[203.48 - 208.52] like right over all that stuff that's
[206.28 - 210.80] what it's going to do so that means you
[208.52 - 212.72] know people I I got over my flu I got
[210.80 - 214.52] over the cold I had two weeks ago that
[212.72 - 217.52] wasn't the white lung pneumonia going
[214.52 - 220.08] around that is coming to

[321.76 - 325.28] pan and get this kind of toasty and use
[324.20 - 328.84] those
[325.28 - 331.72] instead Tomatoes red bell peppers I got

[333.92 - 337.12] different spices I got maple syrup I got
[335.72 - 338.48] some tomato paste we're going to use for
[337.12 - 343.44] this recipe

[343.44 - 349.16] with French
[345.12 - 351.44] dressing we wee all right I think I
[349.16 - 353.40] pretty much covered it let's talk about
[351.44 - 355.64] headbanging stuff right let's get the
[353.40 - 358.16] old board out for a second I don't know
[355.64 - 361.16] maybe we can have fun with this yes we
[358.16 - 364.12] might yes we we can let me draw
[361.16 - 367.00] somebody's head right there okay let's
[364.12 - 370.28] do that someone's not going to be happy
[367.00 - 371.84] though if they bang their head really
[370.28 - 374.20] hard I can tell you
[371.84 - 376.76] that and I'm
[374.20 - 381.12] also
[376.76 - 383.04] going to get Samantha's head model out
[381.12 - 385.48] that's Samantha's head model and she
[383.04 - 387.52] will be coming someday just things have
[385.48 - 389.16] been crazy she said she's been so busy
[387.52 - 391.64] talking about protein and helping people
[389.16 - 395.56] about with their protein needs that she
[391.64 - 400.08] said that she could not come yet um but
[395.56 - 402.88] anyway the point is is we're going into
[400.08 - 406.28] little bit of the head stuff why not
[402.88 - 408.28] where have you banged your head right
[406.28 - 410.32] was it the front really bad so we're
[408.28 - 412.76] going to go into sharp objects so you
[410.32 - 414.48] bang into something really sharp right
[412.76 - 417.04] like something sharp like the corner of
[414.48 - 420.60] a table versus something that's not
[417.04 - 422.28] sharp and your head hits it really hard
[420.60 - 424.44] and your whole head shakes so we're
[422.28 - 428.08] going to go into those details too okay
[424.44 - 431.08] so that'll be good
[428.08 - 431.08] so
[431.20 - 437.96] anyway let's get that up there
[434.88 - 439.48] ready so I want to talk about this topic
[437.96 - 443.52] because I think it's
[439.48 - 445.80] under understood it's under understood
[443.52 - 447.84] it's misunderstood it's not talked about
[445.80 - 449.80] nobody really cares about it there a lot
[447.84 - 452.08] of tortured people though chronically
[449.80 - 454.20] suffering because they banged her head
[452.08 - 457.08] lots of them out there life was never
[454.20 - 459.20] the same anymore and then no one knew
[457.08 - 461.76] why how come it happened and what's
[459.20 - 464.24] going on and they went and got a bunch
[461.76 - 466.40] of MRIs and a whole bunch of different
[464.24 - 468.68] CAT scans and they're taking you know
[466.40 - 470.64] getting scans of their brain and they're
[468.68 - 471.88] looking for that hollowed out section in
[470.64 - 474.76] the middle of the brain is what they're
[471.88 - 476.64] looking for maybe you have that disease
[474.76 - 478.56] where you're missing the middle of your
[476.64 - 480.08] brain and it's starting to hollow out
[478.56 - 482.04] and people are looking for that they're
[480.08 - 483.60] looking for a gap in their brain because
[482.04 - 486.28] so when people have headaches and
[483.60 - 487.88] problems and injuries the doctor might
[486.28 - 490.16] say well you know you had those old
[487.88 - 492.92] sports injuries you had all those
[490.16 - 495.00] problems you had that car accident so
[492.92 - 497.04] maybe you've got that missing piece of
[495.00 - 498.88] brain that develops right where it
[497.04 - 501.40] atrophies is in the center of the brain
[498.88 - 504.60] and so forth right above the brain stem
[501.40 - 506.84] so um but let's go into it some Basics
[504.60 - 508.52] first besides like heavy concussions
[506.84 - 511.60] injuries and so forth let's go into
[508.52 - 514.20] Basics right you bend your head on
[511.60 - 517.52] something sharp something that has a
[514.20 - 522.00] point to it right so something that's
[517.52 - 524.08] Jagged hits your head okay and it hurts
[522.00 - 526.60] maybe a piece of metal sticking out of
[524.08 - 528.00] some porch on your house and you're not
[526.60 - 530.52] you you're in the area and you just
[528.00 - 533.28] banged your head on it maybe you banged
[530.52 - 535.68] your head on something else but either
[533.28 - 537.84] way the injury happens and it's the
[535.68 - 539.92] frontal lobe area right you bang your
[537.84 - 541.76] head here it's a sharp
[539.92 - 544.28] object
[541.76 - 546.56] okay first thing that happens here is
[544.28 - 550.48] you don't have to bend your head that
[546.56 - 552.60] hard to get this type of injury but when
[550.48 - 555.56] you get this type of injury it's a
[552.60 - 557.88] pinpoint injury it's where it's a direct
[555.56 - 559.88] pinpoint now I don't like those you can
[557.88 - 561.72] get a you can get a hematoma from those
[559.88 - 564.28] you can get problems with those but what
[561.72 - 568.28] happens here is if you don't ice this
[564.28 - 570.64] fast if you don't get the ice out quick
[568.28 - 572.40] right this can be become a problem this
[570.64 - 574.96] can turn into a storm for so many
[572.40 - 577.24] different people so you have to know
[574.96 - 580.52] what to do when you do when you actually
[577.24 - 582.64] bang your head and it's a sharp object
[580.52 - 585.56] so with this kind of bump on your head
[582.64 - 587.20] you'll get an egg that egg will start to
[585.56 - 589.24] occur that's the body's defense
[587.20 - 592.48] mechanism right there where the body's
[589.24 - 595.44] like the body's actually reacting that's
[592.48 - 598.16] the reaction that's reaction you get to
[595.44 - 600.44] actually protect your brain so the egg
[598.16 - 603.92] the bump on the SK skull that starts to
[600.44 - 607.28] occur is a mechanism to protect your
[603.92 - 611.36] brain that's what that's for it's like a
[607.28 - 614.72] sealant it's trying to seal the
[611.36 - 618.12] potential fracture or hole in your skull
[614.72 - 620.56] but that doesn't happen with 99% or 98%
[618.12 - 622.04] or whatever 90% of people just banging
[620.56 - 623.76] their head they're not going to get a
[622.04 - 626.60] fracture in that moment they're not
[623.76 - 628.84] going to get a hole in their skull but
[626.60 - 629.88] there's this defense mechanism our body
[628.84 - 633.08] has
[629.88 - 636.00] where it it this inflammation occurs
[633.08 - 639.08] instantly around the bone around the
[636.00 - 642.16] skull and right right inside so then you
[639.08 - 644.40] get this egg that egg is to
[642.16 - 647.84] seal it's to
[644.40 - 650.00] seal any kind of imped Ms anything
[647.84 - 653.08] that's been opened any kind of access or
[650.00 - 655.32] open ways right but yeah even though you
[653.08 - 657.88] get an egg when nothing happened
[655.32 - 659.72] terribly and you get that sharp egg on
[657.88 - 663.40] your head when nothing went terribly
[659.72 - 665.68] wrong your body still gets that egg it
[663.40 - 668.92] still gets that crazy
[665.68 - 670.84] inflammatory development where boom it
[668.92 - 673.28] rises really quick and it starts to
[670.84 - 675.40] pound and then you feel it it's sharp as
[673.28 - 679.28] heck and you feel that pain radiating
[675.40 - 682.52] around it right but it's sharp and it
[679.28 - 684.96] was a small hit so something like you
[682.52 - 687.20] know something sticking out of a wall or
[684.96 - 689.68] something and you walk by and you Peg
[687.20 - 691.88] yourself and you're like wow that really
[689.68 - 694.60] hurt and then you're kind of like oh my
[691.88 - 697.60] God and you're feeling that little spot
[694.60 - 699.40] it's critical to get ice on that spot
[697.60 - 701.84] quick so you don't want to be like well
[699.40 - 703.56] you know what I'll deal with this later
[701.84 - 707.36] I'll just rub it for a second and I'll
[703.56 - 709.16] deal with this later you want to deal
[707.36 - 712.44] with it in the moment you want to get
[709.16 - 715.28] cold compress you want to get some ice
[712.44 - 718.12] in a bag you want something like that
[715.28 - 719.76] and you want to press it on the spot but
[718.12 - 721.60] keep in mind there this is really
[719.76 - 723.44] important to know I mean maybe you don't
[721.60 - 725.96] care about this information but I think
[723.44 - 729.96] it's really important you don't want to
[725.96 - 732.80] ice your whole head around the spot when
[729.96 - 735.32] it's like a pinpoint hit where you hook
[732.80 - 738.56] it into something sharp something
[735.32 - 741.80] meaning something pointy the corner of a
[738.56 - 743.60] counter okay maybe the hood of your car
[741.80 - 746.88] like some pointy thing sticking out of
[743.60 - 749.88] the hood of your car whatever it is you
[746.88 - 752.84] don't want to just ice the entire area
[749.88 - 755.72] you want to pinpoint that ice on the
[752.84 - 757.76] spot that's what you want to do and
[755.72 - 762.36] that's very important so here's the next
[757.76 - 765.04] part too if you hit your head here on
[762.36 - 767.56] this side say your right side on that
[765.04 - 770.24] spot there you want to ice the front
[767.56 - 772.96] right here okay and you want to pinpoint
[770.24 - 774.92] the ice right on top of it and you want
[772.96 - 776.80] to do that for whatever 5 10 minutes you
[774.92 - 778.52] can back off the ice you can put it back
[776.80 - 780.08] on you can back off the ice you can put
[778.52 - 782.60] it back back on by the way call your
[780.08 - 784.32] doctor go to the hospital whatever
[782.60 - 786.64] anybody needs of course but I'm just
[784.32 - 790.40] saying that this is stuff I would do if
[786.64 - 792.80] I happen to me or my family and so forth
[790.40 - 795.24] but you you put the ice on the spot you
[792.80 - 797.48] back the ice off you put it back on it's
[795.24 - 800.00] going to hurt you back it off you do
[797.48 - 802.20] this put it on for another minute or two
[800.00 - 803.96] 3 four minutes right directly on here it
[802.20 - 805.84] could be a cloth wrapped around the ice
[803.96 - 809.48] could be just a cloth and then you back
[805.84 - 812.28] it off okay what you're doing here is
[809.48 - 815.28] you're applying cold super cold for
[812.28 - 817.56] moments and then backing off the cold
[815.28 - 819.68] for for a moment when you back off the
[817.56 - 822.32] cold you give your body a chance to
[819.68 - 825.20] recalibrate and heal so you give this
[822.32 - 827.48] area a chance to actually heal faster
[825.20 - 829.72] then you put the ice back on and you
[827.48 - 831.64] give it a few minutes and if you can't
[829.72 - 834.08] stand it anymore and it hurts you back
[831.64 - 836.36] the ice off right and you do this where
[834.08 - 838.08] you you on and off you take the ice off
[836.36 - 841.28] you put the ice on that little
[838.08 - 845.56] pinpointed egg that egg spot what
[841.28 - 847.40] happens is it's this intermittent icing
[845.56 - 849.92] that allows the body to respond
[847.40 - 853.24] different differently it takes the body
[849.92 - 856.84] out of crisis mode and puts it more into
[853.24 - 859.64] healing mode so that's important to know
[856.84 - 862.00] so say you get a bigger bump you bump
[859.64 - 864.08] the front of your head and it's a bigger
[862.00 - 865.64] bump okay so I'm going to do a little
[864.08 - 868.12] bit of a bigger bump if you guys don't
[865.64 - 869.60] mind I hope this is interesting I find
[868.12 - 871.72] it quite
[869.60 - 874.84] interesting um
[871.72 - 877.48] okay so what you have right there sure I
[874.84 - 879.92] got that ink on my cutting board so I
[877.48 - 881.92] can eat it later so what you have right
[879.92 - 884.48] here is a larger bump it's not so much
[881.92 - 886.68] as a pinpoint it's a little bigger of a
[884.48 - 889.80] bump it's a little bigger of a hit the
[886.68 - 893.08] egg is bigger the egg is
[889.80 - 894.96] bigger this kind of bump you want to do
[893.08 - 896.48] similar you want to get ice onto it
[894.96 - 899.20] immediately you don't want to let this
[896.48 - 902.08] sit you don't want the inflammation
[899.20 - 905.08] to get out of control you don't want it
[902.08 - 907.64] just taking over you want to get that
[905.08 - 909.92] cold compress on here quick very
[907.64 - 912.76] important to know get the cold compress
[909.92 - 915.96] on there quick and when it's a bigger
[912.76 - 918.24] bump and it's a bigger egg okay you do
[915.96 - 920.20] the same thing you hold the compress on
[918.24 - 922.24] there you back off after a few minutes
[920.20 - 924.12] or even five minutes if it if it feels
[922.24 - 925.92] good enough right you can do this thing
[924.12 - 927.64] where you're intermittent you're on
[925.92 - 931.48] you're off you're on you're off but the
[927.64 - 933.44] difference is with this bump here being
[931.48 - 935.76] that it's a larger egg and you feel it's
[933.44 - 938.12] a larger egg and it feels like you're
[935.76 - 940.32] feeling pain in other areas you want to
[938.12 - 943.56] put an ice pack you want to take your
[940.32 - 945.44] ice pack off of that bump and then you
[943.56 - 947.88] want to put the ice pack on the back of
[945.44 - 950.48] your head you want to put it on the back
[947.88 - 952.72] of your head where that side of the bump
[950.48 - 955.16] is so here's the bump right here okay
[952.72 - 958.68] that's your bigger bump right there all
[955.16 - 961.84] right now you want to put the ice pad
[958.68 - 964.56] back on the back of the head just like
[961.84 - 967.64] this you see this there's the bump right
[964.56 - 969.64] here it's a good size egg it's larger
[967.64 - 972.44] than this little pinpoint
[969.64 - 976.08] bump and then but you want to get the
[972.44 - 978.76] cold pack on the back of the head you
[976.08 - 982.08] want to do that for a couple of minutes
[978.76 - 985.80] that's not where the bump is no it's not
[982.08 - 990.00] what this does is this actually slows
[985.80 - 993.52] down the body's mechanism of Crisis
[990.00 - 997.36] State because you got a bigger egg
[993.52 - 1000.36] bigger bump it's a bigger problem and so
[997.36 - 1001.64] you want to get cold compress on the
[1000.36 - 1004.68] back of your
[1001.64 - 1006.08] head instead for a moment and then when
[1004.68 - 1008.12] you do that for a couple of minutes you
[1006.08 - 1010.68] switch back up and you get the bump
[1008.12 - 1011.96] right here what this does is it calms
[1010.68 - 1015.08] the body
[1011.96 - 1018.52] down so that you don't have a storm
[1015.08 - 1022.04] going on because when we bang our head
[1018.52 - 1026.16] heads weird stuff happens blood vessels
[1022.04 - 1029.08] start to pop and break we get
[1026.16 - 1032.12] bleeders we get
[1029.08 - 1035.72] hematomas we get blood clots we get
[1032.12 - 1036.96] blood pooling so blood pulling where it
[1035.72 - 1040.32] pulls in
[1036.96 - 1042.28] Eddies okay different things happen when
[1040.32 - 1047.40] we bang our head and so what you're
[1042.28 - 1051.88] doing is this bigger hit right here
[1047.40 - 1056.28] means most likely your head moved your
[1051.88 - 1059.52] brain moved apologize your brain moved
[1056.28 - 1061.04] this one here this pinpoint one sharp
[1059.52 - 1062.28] object I mean not razor sharp where
[1061.04 - 1063.68] you'd be bleeding everywhere and you
[1062.28 - 1065.76] need stitches you got to go to the
[1063.68 - 1068.60] hospital and get stitched up right but
[1065.76 - 1070.76] this sharp one right here this pinpoint
[1068.60 - 1074.44] one where oh it's an egg and it hurts
[1070.76 - 1076.16] and you feel it chances are that your
[1074.44 - 1079.76] brain didn't
[1076.16 - 1081.24] SLO you didn't have any slashing effects
[1079.76 - 1083.92] with your brain I'm going to go into
[1081.24 - 1088.24] that in a little bit too okay this one
[1083.92 - 1092.36] here is a bigger egg you bend your head
[1088.24 - 1095.88] you might have even seen a star R2 or
[1092.36 - 1098.00] some type of maybe like some weird
[1095.88 - 1100.96] squiggly things going across when you
[1098.00 - 1102.80] hit maybe you you saw something when you
[1100.96 - 1105.40] hit maybe you just saw black when you
[1102.80 - 1107.88] hit but either way this bigger bump
[1105.40 - 1110.56] right here you want to ice the front
[1107.88 - 1112.40] with the C pack you know comfortably
[1110.56 - 1115.16] comfortably I mean if it's killing you
[1112.40 - 1118.28] or it's too cold you know back off and
[1115.16 - 1122.08] you can go back and forth but with this
[1118.28 - 1124.48] one you want to get the cold compress on
[1122.08 - 1126.40] the other side after a few minutes so
[1124.48 - 1129.04] here you are you're applying your ice
[1126.40 - 1131.44] pack right here you're putting it on the
[1129.04 - 1134.16] spot and then after a few minutes or 3
[1131.44 - 1137.32] to five minutes you flip
[1134.16 - 1139.12] it and you put it in the same
[1137.32 - 1142.24] hemisphere
[1139.12 - 1145.28] same hemisphere but on the
[1142.24 - 1148.52] back that's what you do you don't put it
[1145.28 - 1150.84] on the other
[1148.52 - 1153.60] Hemisphere and then the back of it you
[1150.84 - 1156.48] put the same hemisphere as the big bump
[1153.60 - 1159.52] went there's the big bump okay see the
[1156.48 - 1161.40] midline canal right right hemisphere
[1159.52 - 1162.80] left hemisphere you see the midline
[1161.40 - 1165.40] midline
[1162.80 - 1166.60] canal well what you want to do is you
[1165.40 - 1170.60] want to make
[1166.60 - 1172.92] sure you get the right hemisphere so on
[1170.60 - 1175.88] this bump you got to get the cold p on
[1172.92 - 1179.04] the other side what this can do is
[1175.88 - 1182.20] literally halt
[1179.04 - 1185.60] hematomas blood vessel
[1182.20 - 1187.64] breakage weird blood
[1185.60 - 1191.84] clots
[1187.64 - 1194.84] contusions it can halt those bring those
[1191.84 - 1197.00] down okay because your head your brain
[1194.84 - 1200.00] moved a little bit probably on the
[1197.00 - 1203.24] bigger bump your brain moved a little
[1200.00 - 1206.80] bit and if your brain moves a little
[1203.24 - 1209.36] bit you want to get the cold pack on the
[1206.80 - 1212.76] back right there now let's do another
[1209.36 - 1216.04] hit now you just freaking hit your head
[1212.76 - 1218.92] now you boom you hit it you're walking
[1216.04 - 1222.24] on a sidewalk you trip you got your
[1218.92 - 1224.72] sandals on you stub your toe you get
[1222.24 - 1227.68] caught on something and you go down and
[1224.72 - 1232.64] you bang your forehead really hard on a
[1227.68 - 1236.16] metal bicycle on a park bench on a
[1232.64 - 1237.16] whatever some front door on the cement
[1236.16 - 1241.56] on the
[1237.16 - 1244.72] curb on a car you bang the crap out of
[1241.56 - 1248.12] the front of your head where you just
[1244.72 - 1248.12] boom in this
[1250.32 - 1258.32] situation you may not get an egg you may
[1254.24 - 1262.12] not get a bump you may not get this huge
[1258.32 - 1265.80] bump or egg on your head you might get a
[1262.12 - 1268.48] little one but the hit was much harder
[1265.80 - 1272.12] than what the bump shows keep that in
[1268.48 - 1275.04] mind you're a hit really hard but you
[1272.12 - 1279.20] don't have an egg you don't have really
[1275.04 - 1281.32] a bump but you're hit hard frontal lobe
[1279.20 - 1284.04] you hit it boom really
[1281.32 - 1286.80] hard so in this
[1284.04 - 1288.60] situation obviously you know you call
[1286.80 - 1290.88] your doctor and so forth see what your
[1288.60 - 1294.20] doctor wants to do but in this situation
[1290.88 - 1296.64] what I would do okay is I would get ice
[1294.20 - 1298.92] pack right on the frontal lobe right on
[1296.64 - 1301.88] the front and I would do a couple of
[1298.92 - 1306.12] different things I would ice the front
[1301.88 - 1309.60] of my head where it hit okay but when
[1306.12 - 1312.92] you hit your brain slashed
[1309.60 - 1316.20] forward so your brain went forward is
[1312.92 - 1318.60] what it did it went that way so you went
[1316.20 - 1322.16] like this boom
[1318.60 - 1324.48] and your brain then went boom it's kind
[1322.16 - 1327.04] of like an elevator the elevator's going
[1324.48 - 1329.96] down you're on an elevator and the cord
[1327.04 - 1332.44] was cut or the elevator broke and you're
[1329.96 - 1334.32] going down in that elevator the elevator
[1332.44 - 1337.96] hits and then you
[1334.32 - 1339.76] go right same thing you're walking along
[1337.96 - 1342.64] you trip
[1339.76 - 1344.28] boom your head hits something and your
[1342.64 - 1347.52] brain slashes
[1344.28 - 1350.16] forward and when that happens you will
[1347.52 - 1351.96] have to first and foremost you have to
[1350.16 - 1354.24] ice the front for a little bit but now
[1351.96 - 1356.28] you got to do the back of the head you
[1354.24 - 1357.72] have to ice the back of the head so
[1356.28 - 1360.44] that's the next thing so you got to
[1357.72 - 1363.48] definitely ice behind Okay the back of
[1360.44 - 1366.88] the head not just the front of the head
[1363.48 - 1371.12] the reason why is because your brain
[1366.88 - 1374.00] shook from its cage connective tissue
[1371.12 - 1377.20] the spider web of nerves and connected
[1374.00 - 1380.00] tissue between the skull and the Brain
[1377.20 - 1380.92] okay your brain moved away from the back
[1380.00 - 1383.24] of your
[1380.92 - 1385.52] skull and was
[1383.24 - 1388.44] shooken it was
[1385.52 - 1390.92] shaken and because of that inflammation
[1388.44 - 1394.12] is going to start occurring in the back
[1390.92 - 1396.00] of the brain if you don't do the quick
[1394.12 - 1398.08] icing on the back of the brain and you
[1396.00 - 1400.48] only ice the front of the brain the
[1398.08 - 1402.60] frontal lobe in that situation it's not
[1400.48 - 1404.44] going to be enough to protect you to
[1402.60 - 1406.88] give you a fighting chance so your
[1404.44 - 1409.96] concussion is
[1406.88 - 1411.68] less so your concussion is less so you
[1409.96 - 1412.88] don't have all the after effects you're
[1411.68 - 1416.24] not
[1412.88 - 1418.92] suffering so you have to do a front cold
[1416.24 - 1421.24] pack then you got to go around the back
[1418.92 - 1423.80] leave the front alone and you got to do
[1421.24 - 1425.92] the back yeah you didn't hit the back of
[1423.80 - 1428.40] your head you didn't hit the back there
[1425.92 - 1430.24] no you didn't do that see but you still
[1428.40 - 1434.84] got to get the cold pack on the back of
[1430.24 - 1436.24] the head because that brain of yours
[1434.84 - 1439.24] left that
[1436.24 - 1441.80] area and It Slam into the front of your
[1439.24 - 1443.92] skull and the back now is going to get
[1441.80 - 1446.12] in inflamed and
[1443.92 - 1447.92] swollen kind of similar to a car
[1446.12 - 1450.44] accident car accident you ban your head
[1447.92 - 1452.36] on the steering wheel some people an
[1450.44 - 1454.60] airbag can literally give them a
[1452.36 - 1456.08] concussion not some people half the
[1454.60 - 1458.72] people out there that get into car
[1456.08 - 1460.76] accidents the airbag itself gives them a
[1458.72 - 1462.56] concussion so it's like oh I got my
[1460.76 - 1464.88] airbags I'll be fine I get into a car
[1462.56 - 1468.40] accident I got my airbags and all be
[1464.88 - 1471.20] what oh you boom
[1468.40 - 1473.16] and that airbag just knocks you silly
[1471.20 - 1474.92] gives most people or not most but I'd
[1473.16 - 1476.80] say 50% of the people that get into car
[1474.92 - 1479.08] accidents and that airbag goes off boom
[1476.80 - 1481.24] right in their face 50% get a mild
[1479.08 - 1484.00] concussion some get severe
[1481.24 - 1486.12] concussions so in this situation you
[1484.00 - 1488.00] bang your head in the front really hard
[1486.12 - 1490.48] you got to get some ice on there quick
[1488.00 - 1493.40] because you're stopping a
[1490.48 - 1496.08] storm you're stopping a reaction a
[1493.40 - 1498.56] crisis State reaction you have to slow
[1496.08 - 1502.52] that crisis State reaction
[1498.56 - 1504.84] down reminds me of a story a long time
[1502.52 - 1509.40] ago where this guy was driving a
[1504.84 - 1512.52] motorcycle and he had his helmet on okay
[1509.40 - 1515.36] he got into a crash on the
[1512.52 - 1519.00] highway his bike went down he was going
[1515.36 - 1521.92] 80 90 M an hour something happened
[1519.00 - 1528.24] another car and so forth and he went
[1521.92 - 1530.32] down and then he got up from the ground
[1528.24 - 1534.84] and was walking
[1530.32 - 1537.56] around cops got there Medics got there
[1534.84 - 1540.48] fire department got there everybody got
[1537.56 - 1542.12] there the ambulances got there the other
[1540.48 - 1545.20] people were being addressed and taking
[1542.12 - 1549.12] care of they were taking care of him
[1545.20 - 1552.04] too and the guy was told by someone not
[1549.12 - 1555.00] to remove his helmet not to remove his
[1552.04 - 1557.36] helmet he had his helmet on and what was
[1555.00 - 1560.40] happening was there was a crisis The
[1557.36 - 1563.16] Happening inside his head inside his
[1560.40 - 1567.12] brain he was walking around
[1563.16 - 1570.36] fine the police department was there the
[1567.12 - 1572.40] Medics were there right paramedics were
[1570.36 - 1575.24] there the EMTs were there everybody was
[1572.40 - 1578.48] there the state police were there and he
[1575.24 - 1582.36] took off his helmet and he
[1578.48 - 1585.84] died his helmet was on but he wasn't
[1582.36 - 1588.12] getting care for a long time because
[1585.84 - 1590.36] there was confusion because even though
[1588.12 - 1592.20] he wiped out he was walking around fine
[1590.36 - 1594.32] and talking perfectly fine he was like
[1592.20 - 1597.28] yeah know I'm all right yeah that's my
[1594.32 - 1599.60] motorcycle it's 100 yards down that way
[1597.28 - 1601.92] I got a bad scratch on my leg but I
[1599.60 - 1603.84] don't need a stretcher I don't need
[1601.92 - 1604.92] anything I don't have to worry about
[1603.84 - 1606.60] nothing I don't need to go into the
[1604.92 - 1608.72] ambulance and they sat him down and
[1606.60 - 1610.56] they're like okay he's talking fine they
[1608.72 - 1612.36] did a little check on his eyes his
[1610.56 - 1613.76] helmet was still on he did a little
[1612.36 - 1615.88] check on his eyes right little
[1613.76 - 1619.16] flashlight in there dilation pupils and
[1615.88 - 1621.40] all that and it was going on too long it
[1619.16 - 1623.68] was like 45 minutes because the accident
[1621.40 - 1625.56] report was being filled out people were
[1623.68 - 1628.40] being taken care of tow trucks were
[1625.56 - 1631.88] coming and grabbing grabbing things but
[1628.40 - 1634.92] it went so long without something to
[1631.88 - 1636.72] slow down the crisis that the minute the
[1634.92 - 1638.84] guy took off his helmet and one
[1636.72 - 1641.72] paramedic was like hey wait a minute you
[1638.84 - 1643.76] were in that accident don't take off sir
[1641.72 - 1646.16] don't take off your helmet sir don't
[1643.76 - 1648.56] take off your helmet stop stop right now
[1646.16 - 1651.60] the guy took off his helmet
[1648.56 - 1654.76] and he died right there hit the ground
[1651.60 - 1658.08] and died everything came
[1654.76 - 1660.28] apart because in that 45 minutes of that
[1658.08 - 1663.52] head injury they didn't have they didn't
[1660.28 - 1666.48] cold pack him they didn't ice him they
[1663.52 - 1669.00] didn't ice his head and at least slow
[1666.48 - 1672.16] that progression down of that storm
[1669.00 - 1675.28] before they can get him to the hospital
[1672.16 - 1677.64] get him into Imaging and see where the
[1675.28 - 1680.64] bleeders are and see where the
[1677.64 - 1682.60] inflammation was really compounding see
[1680.64 - 1686.16] if the skull was
[1682.60 - 1688.00] fractured but it never got to that point
[1686.16 - 1689.52] and never got to that point so we're
[1688.00 - 1691.56] talking about mild stuff right here
[1689.52 - 1693.04] though in the whole bit head injuries
[1691.56 - 1694.80] can be huge triggers let's go into head
[1693.04 - 1696.44] injuries can be a huge trigger but
[1694.80 - 1698.12] before I go into that I just want to say
[1696.44 - 1700.60] so you bump your head in the front and
[1698.12 - 1702.80] it's a pretty good bump and you know it
[1700.60 - 1705.28] because you felt it you saw
[1702.80 - 1707.04] Stars you want to not just put a cold
[1705.28 - 1708.88] compress on the front you want to switch
[1707.04 - 1710.60] and put on the back you want to slow
[1708.88 - 1711.76] down the inflammation that occurs from
[1710.60 - 1716.60] the brain
[1711.76 - 1721.40] leaving the cockpit and moving forward
[1716.60 - 1724.40] okay so now what happens when it's the
[1721.40 - 1726.80] back of your head let's do that really
[1724.40 - 1730.64] quick how many people have bang their
[1726.80 - 1734.72] head the back of their head
[1730.64 - 1734.72] right how many people have done
[1734.88 - 1742.32] that you bumped your head you slipped
[1737.60 - 1745.32] you fell down now it's the back of
[1742.32 - 1745.32] that
[1746.80 - 1753.92] okay all right that's the front again
[1751.84 - 1757.76] what am I
[1753.92 - 1757.76] doing there's nothing like
[1760.00 - 1766.68] alive so that's the back of the head
[1763.24 - 1768.88] here we go so now you fall and you bang
[1766.68 - 1772.32] the back of your head head really hard
[1768.88 - 1775.24] you see stars you almost black out most
[1772.32 - 1777.80] guaranteed to have a mild concussion
[1775.24 - 1780.28] coming right first thing you got to do
[1777.80 - 1781.84] is compress cold compress again but
[1780.28 - 1783.56] starting on the back of the head you
[1781.84 - 1785.08] want to pinpoint not pinpoint but you
[1783.56 - 1786.48] want to generalize it to the back of the
[1785.08 - 1788.64] head because you won't know really where
[1786.48 - 1790.04] you hit it when you slipped and fell and
[1788.64 - 1791.88] the back of your head hit the ground you
[1790.04 - 1794.48] won't really know
[1791.88 - 1796.20] where you might have pain you might feel
[1794.48 - 1797.96] it you might kind of know where but you
[1796.20 - 1799.56] kind of won't know where so you put that
[1797.96 - 1802.52] cold pack on the back of the head right
[1799.56 - 1804.52] here you do that for what few minutes at
[1802.52 - 1806.00] a time too cold you can back it off a
[1804.52 - 1807.40] little bit then put it back on you can
[1806.00 - 1811.36] back it off a little bit then put it
[1807.40 - 1813.76] back on right can do that but you also
[1811.36 - 1814.92] then want to switch it to the front now
[1813.76 - 1816.16] yeah you didn't hit the front of your
[1814.92 - 1818.64] face and you didn't hit the front of
[1816.16 - 1821.28] your head but you want to get the front
[1818.64 - 1824.24] you want to make sure you hit the ice on
[1821.28 - 1826.44] the front give it some time few minutes
[1824.24 - 1828.00] and so forth then flip it on the back
[1826.44 - 1829.60] what you're doing is slowing down the
[1828.00 - 1831.84] storm you're going to have a milder
[1829.60 - 1834.00] concussion because of this this is
[1831.84 - 1836.16] important information you're going to
[1834.00 - 1838.84] have a milder
[1836.16 - 1842.36] concussion because of this move right
[1838.84 - 1844.52] here right here so you bend your head
[1842.36 - 1847.12] really bad on the back oh you slipped
[1844.52 - 1848.60] boom slipped on some ice boom right you
[1847.12 - 1850.76] got the ice back here you're cold
[1848.60 - 1853.32] compressing and then after a few minutes
[1850.76 - 1854.60] or sometime you flip it you put it on
[1853.32 - 1857.72] the
[1854.60 - 1859.72] front put it on the front the only
[1857.72 - 1861.96] difference here when it comes down to
[1859.72 - 1864.96] hitting the back of your
[1861.96 - 1866.96] head is you want to put ice on the back
[1864.96 - 1869.96] and then you want to
[1866.96 - 1874.52] then you want to put it on the top you
[1869.96 - 1877.36] want to go front back top front back top
[1874.52 - 1879.44] whatever Back front top do that few
[1877.36 - 1880.72] minutes on the top few minutes on the
[1879.44 - 1882.80] back but you don't want to put your
[1880.72 - 1885.04] whole head in ice you don't want to go
[1882.80 - 1888.24] into an ice bath you want you don't want
[1885.04 - 1889.76] to submerge your body into an ice bath
[1888.24 - 1892.80] if you banged your head that's not what
[1889.76 - 1894.48] you do you don't want ice everywhere on
[1892.80 - 1896.60] your head this is critical to know
[1894.48 - 1898.60] because if you put it everywhere you're
[1896.60 - 1901.76] slowing down the healing
[1898.60 - 1903.20] process it has to be localized boom
[1901.76 - 1905.20] right in the back where you hit it you
[1903.20 - 1907.40] wait a few minutes or or you know four
[1905.20 - 1910.04] five minutes or three minutes and then
[1907.40 - 1913.76] it's on top 3 four minutes and then it's
[1910.04 - 1916.32] in the front that's how you prevent
[1913.76 - 1919.20] concussions that are going to spiral out
[1916.32 - 1921.92] of control and become someone's bane of
[1919.20 - 1923.96] their existence I heard it so many times
[1921.92 - 1927.20] over and over and over again I heard
[1923.96 - 1929.32] people you know what a w the reason why
[1927.20 - 1931.52] I came to see you is because I had a car
[1929.32 - 1933.80] accident 20 years ago and I'm still not
[1931.52 - 1936.08] right something's still terribly wrong
[1933.80 - 1938.52] I'm sick with all these problems my head
[1936.08 - 1941.24] my eyes I got this I got that the whole
[1938.52 - 1944.36] bit I know you're not lying so caramel
[1941.24 - 1946.92] says I know you're not lying I've been
[1944.36 - 1950.16] several car in several car accidents and
[1946.92 - 1953.16] they sent me into a very deep depression
[1950.16 - 1954.60] I was diagnosed with TMJ all kind of
[1953.16 - 1957.04] weird symptoms developed you can get
[1954.60 - 1959.24] diagnosed with TMJ from that you can get
[1957.04 - 1964.00] diagnosed with a lot of different things
[1959.24 - 1966.00] um so many different things fibro TMJ ra
[1964.00 - 1967.00] you can just get literally diagnosed
[1966.00 - 1969.76] with
[1967.00 - 1972.08] everything and so that's what can happen
[1969.76 - 1974.44] right so
[1972.08 - 1978.12] um so I just want to tell you something
[1974.44 - 1979.80] about you know C right
[1978.12 - 1981.24] that's going around and stuff like that
[1979.80 - 1983.76] and all that you know how there's After
[1981.24 - 1986.36] Effects there's Long Haul C you know how
[1983.76 - 1989.28] long haul SE what's a medical medium
[1986.36 - 1992.52] thing to start with I published it first
[1989.28 - 1996.68] talked about it first Long Haul flu
[1992.52 - 1998.76] right so um I've done lives on it years
[1996.68 - 2001.52] ago I've done lectures on it what
[1998.76 - 2003.28] happens when you catch the flu and then
[2001.52 - 2005.32] you're not the same after you catch a
[2003.28 - 2007.24] bad flu and you're beaten down and it's
[2005.32 - 2009.72] and you're just you're you're tired got
[2007.24 - 2013.36] fatigued got symptoms well the same
[2009.72 - 2014.76] thing can happen with concussion so like
[2013.36 - 2017.12] Long Haul
[2014.76 - 2019.72] concussion same thing happens with those
[2017.12 - 2021.84] concussions where they last for a long
[2019.72 - 2024.48] time they can last forever for people
[2021.84 - 2026.20] they can last for 10 years 5 years this
[2024.48 - 2028.80] is a serious problem when it comes down
[2026.20 - 2030.28] to the chronically ill and so many
[2028.80 - 2032.52] people with chronic illnesses don't
[2030.28 - 2034.44] realize they've been triggered because
[2032.52 - 2036.20] they banged their head and they don't
[2034.44 - 2038.28] realize that they've been set back
[2036.20 - 2040.32] because they Bang hang their head
[2038.28 - 2043.52] they've had a car accident they've had
[2040.32 - 2045.80] an injury with their head sosed
[2043.52 - 2047.76] around and so they've got into these
[2045.80 - 2050.44] situations but what's really more
[2047.76 - 2052.44] annoying is that someone who's stuck
[2050.44 - 2055.12] with some type of situation where
[2052.44 - 2057.24] they're head was injured whether a car
[2055.12 - 2058.84] accident or something else and then
[2057.24 - 2060.72] they're sick for years they got the
[2058.84 - 2062.08] symptoms like TMJ like all these other
[2060.72 - 2065.08] different symptoms you can have like
[2062.08 - 2067.96] neck pain migraines head pain dizziness
[2065.08 - 2069.40] vertigo ringing in the ear tontis all
[2067.96 - 2073.24] that's happening and then you bang your
[2069.40 - 2074.84] head again and then you bang your head
[2073.24 - 2077.84] again
[2074.84 - 2079.60] darn you get into a little fender bender
[2077.84 - 2081.72] and your head gets jostled you get a
[2079.60 - 2085.00] little Whiplash and your head slams the
[2081.72 - 2088.00] back of your seat and then you bang it
[2085.00 - 2090.28] again that's what happens to everybody
[2088.00 - 2092.16] they bang their head again they slip
[2090.28 - 2095.44] they fall boom they bang their head
[2092.16 - 2096.96] again it happens all over again so
[2095.44 - 2098.24] that's why this is important right here
[2096.96 - 2100.20] so anybody who's chronically ill
[2098.24 - 2102.60] chronically sick so let's go into that a
[2100.20 - 2105.72] little bit so in the brainsaver
[2102.60 - 2107.92] protocols there is concussion in here in
[2105.72 - 2110.56] the brain saver protocols let's go find
[2107.92 - 2113.56] it here it
[2110.56 - 2113.56] is
[2113.80 - 2121.12] so um aha concussion recovery side
[2118.16 - 2122.56] effects so what you'll see right here I
[2121.12 - 2125.12] know it's hard to see I'm just showing
[2122.56 - 2127.20] you this is in brain saver protocols
[2125.12 - 2129.52] okay it says concussion recover recy
[2127.20 - 2132.36] side effects all
[2129.52 - 2134.24] right there's a a list of things you can
[2132.36 - 2137.04] do so I want to read off some of these
[2134.24 - 2138.72] some of these things if you're
[2137.04 - 2141.72] going
[2138.72 - 2144.64] somewhere and you're out and about and
[2141.72 - 2147.48] you bang your head you injure your head
[2144.64 - 2150.68] you get into an accident or you just
[2147.48 - 2152.36] simply bang it in the car door somewhere
[2150.68 - 2155.40] how many people get out of their car
[2152.36 - 2158.16] bang it on the top of their door jam or
[2155.40 - 2159.80] whatever I mean so many things happen
[2158.16 - 2162.52] there's a list of things to do right
[2159.80 - 2164.76] away first first thing you might want to
[2162.52 - 2166.44] do is you might want to get some
[2164.76 - 2169.88] cucumber juice in
[2166.44 - 2173.08] you right away celery juice in you right
[2169.88 - 2177.12] away these are options freshly squeezed
[2173.08 - 2178.76] orange juice in you right away okay even
[2177.12 - 2182.44] if it's just that even if you just
[2178.76 - 2184.52] choose one of these things so here you
[2182.44 - 2186.36] go you bend your head not even
[2184.52 - 2188.40] concussion level I'm just talking about
[2186.36 - 2190.60] like an egg just like I was showing you
[2188.40 - 2193.28] before you Bang Your Head freshly
[2190.60 - 2195.00] squeezed orange juice right away if
[2193.28 - 2199.24] that's what you have a bunch of oranges
[2195.00 - 2200.52] then that's what you do okay all right
[2199.24 - 2204.60] cucumber juice if you got a bunch of
[2200.52 - 2205.88] cucumbers cucumber juice right away okay
[2204.60 - 2208.16] another thing you can do is a heavy
[2205.88 - 2209.76] metal detox smoothie if you already do
[2208.16 - 2213.24] it here's one right here the spinach
[2209.76 - 2215.36] soup that's in the medical medium books
[2213.24 - 2217.88] get on the spinach soup that day doesn't
[2215.36 - 2221.00] have to be in that moment but the same
[2217.88 - 2223.16] day you injure your head it's important
[2221.00 - 2225.48] right there okay okay so let's talk
[2223.16 - 2225.48] about
[2225.68 - 2231.96] supplementation if this if it's just one
[2228.00 - 2234.40] thing you do like I tell family friends
[2231.96 - 2236.64] after a like a head injury a headbang or
[2234.40 - 2239.96] something happened an accident get on
[2236.64 - 2242.92] curcumin right away just and whatever
[2239.96 - 2244.56] curcumin you have just get on it right
[2242.92 - 2247.92] away that's the vimergy one but I'm just
[2244.56 - 2249.92] saying make sure you get human and get
[2247.92 - 2253.76] on it so it's one thing right there
[2249.92 - 2256.20] important vitamin C B12 B12 you get a
[2253.76 - 2257.08] head injury B12 right away and I'll tell
[2256.20 - 2258.92] you
[2257.08 - 2262.36] why
[2258.92 - 2263.96] nerves very important to know nerves
[2262.36 - 2267.16] nerve
[2263.96 - 2271.20] inflammation your brain slashes around
[2267.16 - 2272.52] the demand for B12 is going to be off
[2271.20 - 2276.72] the
[2272.52 - 2279.48] chart the you will eat up your B12 like
[2276.72 - 2283.52] nobody's business you bang your
[2279.48 - 2286.76] head you eat up the B12 your head shakes
[2283.52 - 2291.00] around a little you burn through your
[2286.76 - 2295.04] B12 reserves every cell in your brain
[2291.00 - 2298.44] every single cell in your skull is going
[2295.04 - 2302.28] to be requiring B12 in that moment in
[2298.44 - 2304.16] that crisis so B12 is critical for any
[2302.28 - 2305.68] kind of stuff with head injuries any
[2304.16 - 2308.48] kind of problems where you actually hurt
[2305.68 - 2310.32] your head neck too included because
[2308.48 - 2312.24] we're talking about the brain stem as
[2310.32 - 2314.88] well even
[2312.24 - 2317.48] neck because it can ring right up there
[2314.88 - 2319.52] and get up there curcumin so what I like
[2317.48 - 2323.12] about curcumin for any kind of head
[2319.52 - 2325.60] injury any kind of bump on the Noggin is
[2323.12 - 2327.68] it helps to get inflammation down it
[2325.60 - 2329.60] helps to push it down so not only are
[2327.68 - 2332.16] doing the ice and the ice packs and any
[2329.60 - 2334.28] kind of bumps and bruises on your head
[2332.16 - 2336.04] but you're doing the curcumin to help
[2334.28 - 2337.76] bring that down and that's one of the
[2336.04 - 2340.92] things that's in the protocol right
[2337.76 - 2343.12] there cumin B12 is in there zinc's
[2340.92 - 2346.64] another one so what I love about zinc is
[2343.12 - 2349.88] it dumbs down the cyto storm right zinc
[2346.64 - 2353.68] dumbs down the reaction that happens
[2349.88 - 2356.76] when your body's in crisis you bang your
[2353.68 - 2357.76] head I tell family and friends get on a
[2356.76 - 2360.16] little bit of
[2357.76 - 2361.68] zinc you Bang Your Head get on a little
[2360.16 - 2363.44] bit of Z so that's right there something
[2361.68 - 2365.20] that's really important to know vitamin
[2363.44 - 2367.56] C is another one if it's only one thing
[2365.20 - 2370.48] you have you only have beads 12 that's
[2367.56 - 2373.16] when you use it right there one thing
[2370.48 - 2375.88] you have vitamin C is another one too so
[2373.16 - 2378.12] that's a great one because vitamin C
[2375.88 - 2382.28] that high antioxidant level helps to
[2378.12 - 2384.24] bring down that pre radical crap that
[2382.28 - 2387.60] happens when your body goes into a
[2384.24 - 2390.92] crisis State and all this junk is
[2387.60 - 2392.76] produced from it that's another one too
[2390.92 - 2396.04] all on its own and
[2392.76 - 2398.32] then um check the book out when you can
[2396.04 - 2400.92] there's other also other information in
[2398.32 - 2403.76] there about that so that's brain saer
[2400.92 - 2406.60] protocols I didn't kill myself on that
[2403.76 - 2408.68] book so I can't you know so that people
[2406.60 - 2411.04] you know don't have options I want to
[2408.68 - 2412.16] make sure they have options they have a
[2411.04 - 2414.80] chance to
[2412.16 - 2416.76] heal and so there we go all right so
[2414.80 - 2420.04] let's just make some food you guys I'm
[2416.76 - 2422.60] into it um I got some mango right
[2420.04 - 2423.48] here so I'm just draining a little bit
[2422.60 - 2426.72] of the
[2423.48 - 2428.36] water out of this mango Bowl so I'm
[2426.72 - 2432.64] going to put this
[2428.36 - 2434.44] here all right I got the pan hot I'm
[2432.64 - 2435.76] going to chop up some potatoes but first

[2438.40 - 2443.04] let's make some food you guys there's so
[2441.00 - 2445.04] much more to talk about with that I'm
[2443.04 - 2446.76] just giving you as much as I can in the
[2445.04 - 2449.48] a lot of time I
[2446.76 - 2452.04] have so I'm going to cut an
[2449.48 - 2455.00] onion get it in the
[2452.04 - 2457.24] pan that pan should be
[2455.00 - 2458.64] hot but I want to also talk about
[2457.24 - 2461.32] pneumonia a lot of people are getting
[2458.64 - 2463.24] pneumonia right now their lungs are
[2461.32 - 2466.36] getting filled with
[2463.24 - 2469.20] mucus there's some places in the United
[2466.36 - 2473.04] States right now where hospitals are
[2469.20 - 2475.96] overrun from this whole white lung thing
[2473.04 - 2478.84] basically it's just a crappy
[2475.96 - 2481.80] crappy bronchitis that instantly turns
[2478.84 - 2484.48] into pneumonia for a lot of people it's
[2481.80 - 2486.72] really gnarly gives you a fever in the
[2484.48 - 2490.44] whole bit but I'd like to let people
[2486.72 - 2494.24] know that you know you should be
[2490.44 - 2496.36] prepared do you have the cold and flu
[2494.24 - 2499.36] kit you

[2523.96 - 2528.40] there it's already
[2526.04 - 2530.00] sizzling now it says about a half a cup
[2528.40 - 2532.00] of onion but I'm telling you I'm partial
[2530.00 - 2535.48] to onion so I put a little bit more in
[2532.00 - 2539.04] there because I really really like it I
[2535.48 - 2539.04] don't know about you guys but I love
[2539.12 - 2543.80] onion

[2715.92 - 2719.76] guys have been through a head injury
[2720.40 - 2726.52] before it's a it's a trigger that tends
[2723.72 - 2729.00] to lower the immune system
[2726.52 - 2730.76] allowing Epstein bar to rise up in a lot
[2729.00 - 2732.20] of people so they end up with so many
[2730.76 - 2733.80] different diagnoses because they're
[2732.20 - 2737.84] dealing with
[2733.80 - 2741.56] problems okay CH

[2747.88 - 2753.84] I'm going to cut it up in pieces these
[2750.88 - 2753.84] potatoes are kind of
[2754.88 - 2759.64] crumbly there's a there's one person can
[2757.60 - 2762.32] bang their head one person can bang
[2759.64 - 2762.32] their head really
[2763.24 - 2769.88] hard another person can bang their head
[2766.08 - 2771.28] just as hard and have less issues
[2769.88 - 2773.24] another person can literally get
[2771.28 - 2776.60] triggered into chronic sickness for
[2773.24 - 2780.52] years happens all the time to
[2776.60 - 2782.24] people so I cubed this up and I'm going
[2780.52 - 2785.08] to put a bunch more in here I want to
[2782.24 - 2786.40] make a little bit of a bigger one grab
[2785.08 - 2788.60] another potato right here that's a
[2786.40 - 2791.28] steamed
[2788.60 - 2793.72] potato that's a really good one too by
[2791.28 - 2797.32] the way it's a
[2793.72 - 2797.32] beauty the steamed
[2797.48 - 2802.68] russet this is like a a a pleaser for a
[2800.84 - 2805.60] lot of people Crow pleaser believe it or
[2802.68 - 2808.00] not it feels really hearty it feels
[2805.60 - 2808.00] really
[2809.84 - 2816.20] good take a look nice here we
[2813.72 - 2818.64] go I'm kind of like putting these big
[2816.20 - 2821.68] like cubes and rectangles and stuff in
[2818.64 - 2823.64] here I don't want it to
[2821.68 - 2826.32] um there we
[2823.64 - 2827.84] go all right I'm going to put one more
[2826.32 - 2830.28] that was two potatoes but I got these
[2827.84 - 2832.28] really nice big ones so what I'm going
[2830.28 - 2835.60] to do is take this potato here let's go
[2832.28 - 2835.60] with one more if you guys don't
[2838.04 - 2842.68] mind someone might say why is he talking
[2840.68 - 2844.24] about like you know head injuries and
[2842.68 - 2847.36] stuff I'll tell you
[2844.24 - 2849.00] why so many people with chronic illness
[2847.36 - 2850.80] their lives have changed because they
[2849.00 - 2854.72] banged their head they had a head injury
[2850.80 - 2857.84] of some kind and and it wasn't addressed
[2854.72 - 2859.80] properly and their nerves became frayed
[2857.84 - 2862.76] in in different areas and their brain
[2859.80 - 2864.52] stem and their cranial nerve became
[2862.76 - 2867.12] inflamed because of because of say
[2864.52 - 2868.48] Epstein bar and the shingles rising up
[2867.12 - 2870.68] because their immune system was knocked
[2868.48 - 2872.92] down so when we go through something
[2870.68 - 2876.04] like some kind of trauma our immune
[2872.92 - 2877.48] system drops we have an adrenaline surge
[2876.04 - 2879.60] when we go through some kind of trauma
[2877.48 - 2881.64] or adrenaline is just pouring pouring
[2879.60 - 2883.48] into our bloodstream from our adrenals
[2881.64 - 2885.68] pumping and pouring in and then our
[2883.48 - 2887.80] immune system starts to drop through the
[2885.68 - 2891.24] crisis right and then if someone's just
[2887.80 - 2892.96] on the edge of that that um Epstein bar
[2891.24 - 2895.24] breakout they're just on the edge of
[2892.96 - 2898.00] that simplex one breakout or that
[2895.24 - 2900.08] shingles breakout they get in trouble
[2898.00 - 2902.72] because some of those viruses like the
[2900.08 - 2905.20] obscene bar can cling to the nerves the
[2902.72 - 2906.60] root hairs from these nerves and then
[2905.20 - 2909.28] they're at the doctor's office like I
[2906.60 - 2911.24] got fibromyalgia now I got problems I
[2909.28 - 2914.60] never had before and they're just
[2911.24 - 2914.60] dealing with all all this
[2914.80 - 2917.80] stuff
[2918.80 - 2924.36] okay so I got some frozen peas over here
[2921.28 - 2927.16] I'm going to pop in a little bit I also
[2924.36 - 2928.40] have um some steam peas too I just
[2927.16 - 2930.72] thought I would have both some people
[2928.40 - 2933.20] steam them where they're soft like this
[2930.72 - 2935.48] I do love them like this I like them
[2933.20 - 2938.52] when they got this like really soft kind
[2935.48 - 2941.44] of kind of you know they're they lose
[2938.52 - 2945.16] some of that green color but they're so
[2941.44 - 2948.88] good though right and then you can have
[2945.16 - 2951.68] them differently too where kind of
[2948.88 - 2952.96] popping you can make them toasty but
[2951.68 - 2956.64] they're not as
[2952.96 - 2956.64] soft these are frozen
[2956.80 - 2961.28] peas
[2958.40 - 2963.52] okay want to show you guys over here on

[3037.04 - 3042.24] concussion I'm so going through flare up
[3040.48 - 3044.84] yeah I feel so bad for you the
[3042.24 - 3047.16] concussions are just so annoying and
[3044.84 - 3048.68] they can really linger and it's
[3047.16 - 3051.32] important to kind
[3048.68 - 3054.40] of know what you can do for it like for
[3051.32 - 3056.12] instance the concussion protocol has a
[3054.40 - 3059.32] lot of different things in here to work
[3056.12 - 3062.40] with but there's a reason for it because
[3059.32 - 3065.76] we get these viral flares on top of
[3062.40 - 3065.76] concussion issues
[3065.92 - 3071.00] right I'm going to put some tomato in
[3068.20 - 3074.40] here not a lot I'm just going to put
[3071.00 - 3076.48] some it's kind of like this the
[3074.40 - 3078.92] concussion can be a problem all on its
[3076.48 - 3082.00] own because your head was shook your
[3078.92 - 3083.52] brain was shook but it also can trigger
[3082.00 - 3086.12] off other things that are inside of our
[3083.52 - 3088.84] body immune system drops
[3086.12 - 3092.16] lot of people suffer from concussion
[3088.84 - 3096.28] issues a year if you're young sometimes
[3092.16 - 3098.44] it takes a year to power through it I
[3096.28 - 3100.64] mean it just
[3098.44 - 3102.60] can depending on how bad look
[3100.64 - 3106.32] everybody's concussion is different but
[3102.60 - 3110.24] still cold white spring I saw they just
[3106.32 - 3114.36] recognized Long Haul flu
[3110.24 - 3118.72] oh they didn't recognize it they stole

[3140.68 - 3147.72] information right there and I did it
[3143.52 - 3149.24] before the pandemic so I published
[3147.72 - 3154.08] multiple
[3149.24 - 3158.60] Avenues of that but I was talking to
[3154.08 - 3160.36] somebody who um is scientist guy who's
[3158.60 - 3162.36] interested in medical medium books and
[3160.36 - 3164.32] he says like why don't we do a whole
[3162.36 - 3166.52] bunch of studies on this I'm like hey

[3903.36 - 3908.56] complain about Doc's benefit from your
[3906.00 - 3911.28] information didn't you write books for
[3908.56 - 3914.92] everyone and why do you care if they
[3911.28 - 3917.20] attribute you or not amazing amazing
[3914.92 - 3920.00] I'll tell you why because they can tell
[3917.20 - 3923.44] somebody they got long haul
[3920.00 - 3924.80] flu but that's all they can do doesn't
[3923.44 - 3927.36] that suck
[3924.80 - 3929.60] that sucks so if I had long haul flu and

[3936.56 - 3941.32] now and I'm not getting out of it and I
[3939.16 - 3943.12] go and find some article somewhere or
[3941.32 - 3944.72] somebody you know they they took a grab
[3943.12 - 3945.92] they grabbed the medical M information
[3944.72 - 3948.60] and they grabbed it and they said you
[3945.92 - 3950.76] have long haul flu here's what you know
[3948.60 - 3953.52] here's how it works you catch the flu
[3950.76 - 3955.80] and you don't get better they don't give
[3953.52 - 3959.80] you the answer answers they don't give
[3955.80 - 3963.00] you the answers they don't say hey
[3959.80 - 3965.12] look we know now that this exists we
[3963.00 - 3966.36] took it from medical medium books it was
[3965.12 - 3969.32] published in his New York Times
[3966.36 - 3974.00] best-selling books we took
[3969.32 - 3976.44] it but we really can't help you but then
[3974.00 - 3978.56] in the medical medium books the answers
[3976.44 - 3981.56] to because that's where it originates it
[3978.56 - 3983.56] originates from there you know about
[3981.56 - 3985.16] they know about the long ha flu because
[3983.56 - 3988.00] it origin Ates from the medical medium
[3985.16 - 3990.88] books so that's where the answers to how
[3988.00 - 3992.56] to heal it also the answers to why you
[3990.88 - 3994.40] even have it the best they can do is
[3992.56 - 3996.36] they steal the concept and they say you
[3994.40 - 3999.20] got long haul flu but they don't tell
[3996.36 - 4001.84] you how it really happens like the real

[4006.84 - 4010.28] tell you where it originated it
[4008.44 - 4013.00] originated
[4010.28 - 4014.28] here and then on top of it they tell you

[4351.76 - 4356.56] just going to say it right there's a
[4354.84 - 4360.68] campaign going on right
[4356.56 - 4363.84] now okay a campaign that it's
[4360.68 - 4365.36] multifaceted right it's to shame anybody
[4363.84 - 4367.32] who's following medical
[4365.36 - 4369.12] medium to shame everybody who's
[4367.32 - 4371.36] following medical medium
[4369.12 - 4373.72] right and then at the same time steal
[4371.36 - 4375.44] the medical medium information at the
[4373.72 - 4376.72] same time try to convince people who
[4375.44 - 4379.32] follow medical medium that the
[4376.72 - 4382.44] information isn't original and it's not
[4379.32 - 4383.80] from my books or from the medical medium
[4382.44 - 4385.60] at the same time trying to say medical
[4383.80 - 4389.72] meds of
[4385.60 - 4392.08] fraud like a campaign at the same
[4389.72 - 4393.60] time the medical establishment in the
[4392.08 - 4394.72] medical world and the medical system is
[4393.60 - 4397.48] stealing all the medical medium
[4394.72 - 4399.96] information and they're putting it
[4397.48 - 4401.76] online they have nothing to back it up
[4399.96 - 4403.52] we know we we've done the research and
[4401.76 - 4405.00] we've actually caught them in like
[4403.52 - 4406.88] hundreds of different places where they
[4405.00 - 4410.08] actually take it right out of the book
[4406.88 - 4413.08] right out of the books at the same time
[4410.08 - 4415.20] all of this is happening mm's being
[4413.08 - 4416.48] censored at the same time all that's
[4415.20 - 4419.96] happening
[4416.48 - 4422.56] like you know they must really fear me
[4419.96 - 4424.24] must really really fear me and then
[4422.56 - 4427.48] there's different levels of it like
[4424.24 - 4428.84] these campaigns and then there's the and
[4427.48 - 4432.44] then this the crazy thing is we have all
[4428.84 - 4434.96] the factual data to prove it's happening
[4432.44 - 4439.52] we have all of it because it's happening
[4434.96 - 4442.80] it's crazy how it works just nuts

[4484.92 - 4490.32] really have to be made of something
[4487.08 - 4490.32] strong to withstand some of
[4490.48 - 4494.40] it years ago you know what they said
[4492.60 - 4496.20] about medical Med you're monopolizing
[4494.40 - 4497.52] the entire Health movement that's what
[4496.20 - 4500.16] they
[4497.52 - 4503.32] said they said you're
[4500.16 - 4506.52] monopolizing the entire Health movement
[4503.32 - 4508.32] and what I said was no it's just that
[4506.52 - 4510.60] millions are healing worldwide that no
[4508.32 - 4512.00] one has ever seen before no one has ever
[4510.60 - 4514.08] seen this kind of healing with people
[4512.00 - 4515.32] with real chronic illness bedridden and
[4514.08 - 4516.80] getting out of their wheelchairs no

[4805.12 - 4807.96] there want to sell all their stuff now
[4806.48 - 4810.00] so what they do is they say about
[4807.96 - 4811.28] medical medium then it brings in a crowd
[4810.00 - 4813.44] because anything medical medium just
[4811.28 - 4815.56] brings people in right and they say
[4813.44 - 4817.08] about medical medium then people come in
[4815.56 - 4819.04] and then they do that so they can sell

[4827.96 - 4834.00] have to just ride through it and we'll
[4830.56 - 4835.96] get to the other side of it meanwhile
[4834.00 - 4838.84] science research is taking medical M
