[11.04 - 14.72] there
[11.84 - 15.84] and got some lemons here too look at
[14.72 - 17.36] these tomatoes huh
[15.84 - 19.12] you guys are afraid of tomatoes i mean
[17.36 - 19.92] so many of you are told tomatoes aren't
[19.12 - 21.92] good
[19.92 - 24.32] i'd like to talk about that a little bit
[21.92 - 26.48] on how good for you they are
[24.32 - 27.84] and how that's misinformation the word
[26.48 - 30.24] misinformation
[27.84 - 32.32] no one was using it when it came down to
[30.24 - 35.12] foods and chronic illness
[32.32 - 36.64] published it originally in here talked
[35.12 - 37.92] about misinformation
[36.64 - 39.68] out there in the medical field
[37.92 - 41.84] misinformation and alternative medicine
[39.68 - 44.72] conventional medicine misinformation
[41.84 - 45.52] about all the trends out there and now
[44.72 - 47.52] the word is
[45.52 - 49.60] used against a medical medium
[47.52 - 50.16] misinformation where's your scientific
[49.60 - 51.76] study
[50.16 - 54.16] well how about millions healed around
[51.76 - 57.04] the world devastating illnesses
[54.16 - 59.68] and healed how about that anyway medical
[57.04 - 62.00] medium new edition check it out you guys

[86.08 - 89.52] come out too can't wait i'm excited you
[88.08 - 90.48] guys we're youtube live and we're
[89.52 - 91.92] facebook live
[90.48 - 94.08] i'm going to start preparing food right
[91.92 - 96.40] now
[94.08 - 98.56] and i'm going to answer questions too so
[96.40 - 100.48] i want to be helpful the best i can
[98.56 - 102.24] what can you do to help with crohn's
[100.48 - 103.60] disease when it comes down luanne when
[102.24 - 106.88] it comes down to crohn's
[103.60 - 110.16] um you got inflammation okay that's
[106.88 - 111.68] inflammation inflammation is a mystery
[110.16 - 113.20] to medical research in science they
[111.68 - 115.84] don't know what causes it
[113.20 - 116.96] so being that you know so anything they
[115.84 - 120.48] label like crohn's
[116.96 - 122.32] colitis ibs they they don't know what
[120.48 - 124.08] causes it so that's one of the reasons
[122.32 - 126.24] why it's so difficult to fix anything so
[124.08 - 127.60] then everybody's playing guessing games
[126.24 - 129.20] everybody's out there looking for
[127.60 - 131.12] answers and they're like well how can i
[129.20 - 132.48] fix this what can i do and then
[131.12 - 134.72] and then they'll tell you hey it's your
[132.48 - 136.24] genes they'll say luanne it's your genes
[134.72 - 136.96] you just it's your bad genes that's why
[136.24 - 138.48] you have
[136.96 - 140.24] crohn's and then they'll come up with a
[138.48 - 141.76] name like crohn's and
[140.24 - 144.88] meanwhile they still don't know what the
[141.76 - 147.84] inflammation is and then what happens is
[144.88 - 149.92] you get the inflammation um and they get
[147.84 - 151.92] narrowing of the intestinal tract
[149.92 - 153.44] you can get it could bellow out you get
[151.92 - 155.36] pockets you get narrowing and you just
[153.44 - 156.00] get this chronic inflammatory condition
[155.36 - 158.64] going on there
[156.00 - 160.40] and so what i've always done teaching
[158.64 - 161.84] doctors how to heal crohn's so they can
[160.40 - 162.80] help their patients what i've always
[161.84 - 165.68] done is
[162.80 - 166.16] is the first things first is what foods
[165.68 - 168.96] can be
[166.16 - 170.64] trouble like what food can be causing a
[168.96 - 173.60] problem with crohn's you know
[170.64 - 174.16] and that's the first thing but the other
[173.60 - 175.68] thing is
[174.16 - 177.12] knowing the true cause of crohn's so
[175.68 - 179.04] that's that's the other thing too so
[177.12 - 181.76] it's knowing the true cause but
[179.04 - 183.52] in order to know the true cause you know
[181.76 - 185.60] that's one thing there you got to know
[183.52 - 187.52] also like what to avoid
[185.60 - 189.52] that's actually behind the true cause so
[187.52 - 192.40] it's kind of like a combination right
[189.52 - 193.20] and so when it comes down to crohn's
[192.40 - 195.92] it's
[193.20 - 197.36] what can we avoid the true cause
[195.92 - 199.68] pathogens
[197.36 - 201.68] toxic heavy metals do play a role okay
[199.68 - 202.96] they do play a role toxic heavy metals
[201.68 - 204.72] i'm peeling a cucumber right now because
[202.96 - 208.16] i'm going to make some cucumber noodles
[204.72 - 209.76] got this little tool right here and
[208.16 - 211.52] you get a whole bunch of pathogens they
[209.76 - 213.28] get inside the intestinal tract and they
[211.52 - 215.68] start to weaken the lining
[213.28 - 217.44] they start to inflame the lining you can
[215.68 - 220.96] get streptococcus in there
[217.44 - 222.72] e coli and they cause a lot of issues
[220.96 - 224.32] they attach themselves to the lining of
[222.72 - 226.00] the colon and you start getting little
[224.32 - 227.92] pockets and little divots and that
[226.00 - 230.40] happens to a lot of people
[227.92 - 231.12] then the other thing is viruses too you
[230.40 - 232.56] know a lot of
[231.12 - 234.32] viruses create problems in the
[232.56 - 237.28] intestinal tract lining
[234.32 - 237.84] um so the combination of both of these
[237.28 - 240.96] is really
[237.84 - 243.36] is really contributing and then and then
[240.96 - 245.60] you know um foods that aren't good that
[243.36 - 247.04] keep on feeding these pathogens you know
[245.60 - 249.12] like for instance i got something right
[247.04 - 251.68] here
[249.12 - 252.64] like this is not a good food right here
[251.68 - 254.96] um
[252.64 - 256.08] we're dealing with crohn's or colitis or
[254.96 - 257.76] ibs or
[256.08 - 259.12] digestive issues or intestinal tract
[257.76 - 261.04] disorders
[259.12 - 262.80] this is not a great food right here
[261.04 - 264.32] these beautiful eggs right here aren't
[262.80 - 266.48] they pretty right
[264.32 - 268.08] and terrible food for any kind of
[266.48 - 270.40] condition but i'll talk about those in a
[268.08 - 270.40] little bit
[270.96 - 275.28] um the thing is is the intestinal tract
[273.76 - 277.04] gets so sensitive i hear those eggs
[275.28 - 280.00] rolling around on the plate right now
[277.04 - 281.52] tesla track gets so sensitive too
[280.00 - 282.00] because the nerve endings start to get
[281.52 - 284.72] sensitive
[282.00 - 286.24] because you get in that inflammation so
[284.72 - 288.00] all the nerve endings in the intestinal
[286.24 - 289.52] tract are really get they really get
[288.00 - 291.04] sensitive so when you're eating foods
[289.52 - 291.92] you don't know what's helping or what's
[291.04 - 293.36] not
[291.92 - 295.28] and that's something that gets becomes
[293.36 - 298.72] very difficult um
[295.28 - 301.92] what i like to do with with crohn's is
[298.72 - 303.60] um steamed potatoes are really gentle
[301.92 - 305.84] really easy on the system but they're
[303.60 - 308.24] also anti-pathogen
[305.84 - 310.32] so um that's one food right there that i
[308.24 - 311.84] like to i like to teach doctors to use
[310.32 - 314.40] for their patients
[311.84 - 316.24] papaya banana that's a big one right
[314.40 - 317.92] there so papaya banana do i have any
[316.24 - 318.64] bananas back here i don't have either or
[317.92 - 322.08] i thought i
[318.64 - 325.12] thought i had some bananas back there um
[322.08 - 326.48] and and also there's protocols in the
[325.12 - 327.84] medical meeting books you can take to
[326.48 - 329.60] your doctor and all that
[327.84 - 330.56] you know and have them have them look at
[329.60 - 332.80] it right there you guys are making
[330.56 - 335.84] cucumber noodles
[332.80 - 336.80] but papayas bananas are really good for
[335.84 - 339.28] crohn's
[336.80 - 340.00] that one's very helpful soothing it
[339.28 - 342.08] helps to
[340.00 - 343.04] push past some of those narrowings so
[342.08 - 344.96] that
[343.04 - 346.64] people with crohn's can can go to
[344.96 - 348.16] bathroom easy because that's a problem
[346.64 - 349.44] you get lots of different constipation a
[348.16 - 353.44] lot of pain
[349.44 - 354.64] and all that stuff but what to avoid is
[353.44 - 357.20] a critical thing
[354.64 - 358.48] milk cheese butter eggs the very eggs i
[357.20 - 361.28] was just showing you
[358.48 - 362.96] definitely avoid those eggs and gluten
[361.28 - 364.40] because all those will feed bugs so what
[362.96 - 367.68] happens is
[364.40 - 369.68] if you got the strep bacteria
[367.68 - 371.68] and you're eating the eggs because now i
[369.68 - 373.28] got a real egg here in front of me
[371.68 - 375.04] and you know the strep bacteria is
[373.28 - 375.36] sitting inside the intestinal tract and
[375.04 - 377.52] it's
[375.36 - 379.04] it's camped there there's colonies of it
[377.52 - 380.56] and that that goes for people with a lot
[379.04 - 381.44] of digestive tract disorders that aren't
[380.56 - 383.52] even diagnosed
[381.44 - 384.72] properly or not where it's mystery it's
[383.52 - 386.72] like okay what's going on you got
[384.72 - 389.04] cramping bloating all of that
[386.72 - 390.56] and what happens is that bacteria just
[389.04 - 392.64] loves to feed on eggs so we're eating
[390.56 - 394.00] eggs thinking that's a great food and
[392.64 - 395.92] then all of a sudden you know that's
[394.00 - 398.00] that's that's the food it's eating
[395.92 - 399.84] and then it proliferates two weeks later
[398.00 - 400.24] conditions are worse but yet the egg
[399.84 - 403.20] felt
[400.24 - 404.88] so good it felt so good it went down it
[403.20 - 406.72] was easy on the system
[404.88 - 408.32] it didn't rub on any of the lining it
[406.72 - 409.04] didn't trigger off any of the nerve
[408.32 - 412.00] endings
[409.04 - 414.16] the egg was just it was just so easy it
[412.00 - 416.00] turned just into a glue that goes into
[414.16 - 417.52] down the patch like a glue that just
[416.00 - 419.44] sits in the center of the intestinal
[417.52 - 421.84] tract and works its way down right
[419.44 - 424.08] and it doesn't trigger any kind of like
[421.84 - 426.16] pain or any kind of discomfort
[424.08 - 428.24] so we think the eggs are probably a safe
[426.16 - 430.00] bet but what the egg does is it keeps on
[428.24 - 431.68] feeding all the bugs and the bugs create
[430.00 - 433.20] more inflammation and then we get more
[431.68 - 434.24] problems and then we're sensitive to
[433.20 - 435.52] lettuce
[434.24 - 436.96] meaning in the sense that because you
[435.52 - 438.72] feel the lettuce going down and then
[436.96 - 441.76] we're sensitive to other things and
[438.72 - 446.64] there's a lot of confusion but
[441.76 - 446.64] that's what happens there um
[446.80 - 449.68] okay so i'm just get i'm just preparing
[448.48 - 450.00] some cucumbers here i'm going to turn
[449.68 - 451.28] them into
[450.00 - 453.04] noodles in a little bit i'm going to
[451.28 - 453.84] make the sauce with the brisket on top
[453.04 - 456.24] of it
[453.84 - 457.76] um bruschetta you can call it bruschetta
[456.24 - 459.52] some people call it bruschetta
[457.76 - 461.60] some people call it bruschetta some
[459.52 - 465.04] people call it something different
[461.60 - 468.08] um i'm going to cut these ends off right
[465.04 - 468.08] here this cucumber
[468.80 - 473.20] insulin resistance lori insulin
[471.76 - 477.12] resistance
[473.20 - 480.40] okay fat equals
[477.12 - 483.84] insulin resistance right there okay fats
[480.40 - 486.64] and i mean milk cheese butter eggs
[483.84 - 488.72] chicken beef i'm not going in i'm not
[486.64 - 492.72] going against animal protein
[488.72 - 496.16] nut butters okay nut butters nut milks
[492.72 - 499.20] all right avocado oils coconut oil
[496.16 - 503.12] even healthy fats right all fats
[499.20 - 505.52] lead to insulin resistance so it's about
[503.12 - 507.12] how much fats in your diet like how much
[505.52 - 508.56] fat is in your diet you know like are
[507.12 - 510.64] you guys
[508.56 - 511.68] like how much fats in your diet are you
[510.64 - 514.72] guys doing like
[511.68 - 516.56] a lot of fat in your diet because that
[514.72 - 518.32] this is insulin resistance right here
[516.56 - 520.72] i'm showing you insulin resistance
[518.32 - 522.48] that's what this is okay so here's how
[520.72 - 525.20] it works okay even somebody
[522.48 - 526.64] that doesn't have real real high insulin
[525.20 - 528.48] resistance like it's not off the chart
[526.64 - 529.28] yet it's always there for everybody no
[528.48 - 530.88] matter what
[529.28 - 533.68] so you got all your fats right there you
[530.88 - 534.16] got your burger and that's a beef burger
[533.68 - 535.92] okay
[534.16 - 537.76] that's not a vegan burger that's a beef
[535.92 - 540.56] burger and
[537.76 - 541.68] all that fat in there okay what that
[540.56 - 544.56] does is it blocks
[541.68 - 546.08] sugar from entering your cells so you
[544.56 - 548.00] have to basically produce a lot of
[546.08 - 550.16] insulin but the fat stops the insulin
[548.00 - 551.20] from taking sugar into cells and then
[550.16 - 553.20] you got the cheese
[551.20 - 554.96] more fat right there and cheese has got
[553.20 - 556.40] sugar in it too which makes it even
[554.96 - 557.12] worse because you got fat and sugar
[556.40 - 559.04] combined
[557.12 - 560.32] right you got more sugar which is the
[559.04 - 563.84] bun
[560.32 - 565.52] okay and then you got fried potatoes
[563.84 - 567.84] fried french fries right
[565.52 - 569.04] see those fried french fries those are
[567.84 - 571.28] fried in oil
[569.04 - 573.44] so when they're fried in oil what do you
[571.28 - 573.92] have you have insulin resistance because
[573.44 - 576.40] you got
[573.92 - 577.12] sugar and fat sugar and fat you see the
[576.40 - 579.60] burger
[577.12 - 580.72] the burger is sugar and fat that's what
[579.60 - 583.36] the burger is
[580.72 - 584.40] what's the best thing on this plate well
[583.36 - 587.52] the potato
[584.40 - 590.32] is one of the best things but the
[587.52 - 591.92] potatoes been crucified it's been
[590.32 - 592.40] annihilated i don't know it's been just
[591.92 - 595.84] it's been
[592.40 - 597.20] injured because and or sacrificed
[595.84 - 599.76] whatever it is because it's been fried
[597.20 - 602.16] in oil so the potatoes been hindered
[599.76 - 604.16] right and but what's the best thing here
[602.16 - 605.84] well these pickles well that's that's
[604.16 - 607.52] vinegar so these pickles aren't that
[605.84 - 608.72] great you see that because these pickles
[607.52 - 610.96] are vinegar right
[608.72 - 612.64] tomatoes the best thing the onion's the
[610.96 - 615.52] best thing and the lettuce is best thing
[612.64 - 617.04] in this whole setup right if the
[615.52 - 620.16] potatoes weren't
[617.04 - 623.36] fried in oil that would be
[620.16 - 624.96] one of the best things too so anyway
[623.36 - 628.16] watch i don't spill this off the this
[624.96 - 633.84] thing doesn't pop off the plate
[628.16 - 633.84] i don't want that popping off the plate
[634.32 - 636.80] and then
[638.64 - 642.80] um the plate was greasy there's so much
[641.12 - 645.76] fat in that food
[642.80 - 646.64] so much that that's from a restaurant
[645.76 - 648.48] around the corner
[646.64 - 649.84] there's so much fat in that food that
[648.48 - 652.08] that like the grease
[649.84 - 653.68] on the plate it just found its way on
[652.08 - 655.60] the plate it's all over my hands and i
[653.68 - 658.96] really don't want grease
[655.60 - 661.52] on my bruschetta and cucumber noodles
[658.96 - 663.04] all right let's get going let's talk
[661.52 - 664.08] about insulin resistance okay how about
[663.04 - 667.20] we do that
[664.08 - 668.00] what happens is fat fills up in your
[667.20 - 670.24] bloodstream
[668.00 - 671.52] when you have that cheeseburger or the
[670.24 - 672.72] peanut butter smoothie
[671.52 - 675.12] because you're putting peanut butter in
[672.72 - 676.24] your smoothie or peanut butter on your
[675.12 - 678.88] oatmeal
[676.24 - 680.32] oatmeal has enough fat in it by itself
[678.88 - 683.28] naturally right
[680.32 - 684.16] but that's okay that's all right that's
[683.28 - 686.24] right but when you
[684.16 - 687.28] add fat to your oatmeal like all that
[686.24 - 689.68] peanut butter
[687.28 - 690.64] you get yourself in trouble because the
[689.68 - 692.88] sugar in that
[690.64 - 694.48] oatmeal the sugar the carbohydrate and
[692.88 - 695.12] that oatmeal can't find its way into
[694.48 - 698.80] your cells
[695.12 - 701.36] so your pancreas has to whoo has to
[698.80 - 702.96] pedal to the metal man that pancreas has
[701.36 - 706.48] to pedal to the metal
[702.96 - 709.44] if your pancreas could talk it would say
[706.48 - 709.44] it would say oh no
[709.52 - 712.96] why did that person just put all that
[711.76 - 715.28] fat with that sugar
[712.96 - 716.40] that carbohydrate because now i'm going
[715.28 - 718.80] to have to produce
[716.40 - 720.48] way more insulin and burn my pancreas
[718.80 - 722.16] out so by the time they're 40 years old
[720.48 - 724.24] they got type 2 diabetes
[722.16 - 726.08] by the time they're 45 they got type 2
[724.24 - 728.48] diabetes
[726.08 - 730.80] even type 1 diabetes whatever i mean and
[728.48 - 734.40] so your pancreas just has to spill out
[730.80 - 736.40] all of that insulin to try to get that
[734.40 - 739.36] carbohydrate into cells
[736.40 - 740.24] because guess what we run on sugar news
[739.36 - 741.84] flash
[740.24 - 743.44] not to you guys you guys know this stuff
[741.84 - 746.00] by now because you've been watching
[743.44 - 748.16] uh you know the medical medium books and
[746.00 - 751.68] and podcasts and everything else right
[748.16 - 754.48] but news flash to anybody else all right
[751.68 - 756.16] your body has to run on sugar you can't
[754.48 - 756.64] function you can't do nothing i can't do
[756.16 - 759.68] this
[756.64 - 760.32] without sugar that's it sugar takes care
[759.68 - 762.72] of it
[760.32 - 764.32] and if you don't have sugar which is
[762.72 - 767.04] hence your blood sugar which
[764.32 - 768.24] is glucose which runs at your brain it
[767.04 - 771.12] runs your thoughts
[768.24 - 772.80] people say you know what he talks so
[771.12 - 774.16] fast you know
[772.80 - 776.32] i got friends that say you know what why
[774.16 - 777.12] don't you talk slower on all your videos
[776.32 - 778.96] and all your
[777.12 - 780.48] podcasts and i'm like i have to force
[778.96 - 783.60] myself to talk slow
[780.48 - 785.28] i have to force myself and and they're
[783.60 - 786.00] like well he must be jacked up on tons
[785.28 - 790.08] of caffeine
[786.00 - 794.32] no i'm not that's sugar that's glucose
[790.08 - 797.20] that's natural carbohydrate in a potato
[794.32 - 799.28] that's sugar from a lemon that's sugar
[797.20 - 801.52] from a tomato
[799.28 - 804.56] that's where it comes from but guess
[801.52 - 806.48] what that sugar is not blocked by fat
[804.56 - 807.84] so yeah i could have a little avocado i
[806.48 - 809.28] love avocado
[807.84 - 810.88] yeah i could have a little bit of tahini
[809.28 - 813.92] i love tahini
[810.88 - 814.64] sure you can have that i love hemp seeds
[813.92 - 818.24] hemp seeds
[814.64 - 820.56] amazing food but you know i'm cautious
[818.24 - 821.76] i'm not gonna sit there and and and do
[820.56 - 823.36] it all day long
[821.76 - 824.88] i'm not gonna be doing hemp seeds on and
[823.36 - 826.48] off and then throw some nut butters in
[824.88 - 827.44] there and then have chicken at night and
[826.48 - 830.56] then
[827.44 - 832.32] and then to do a guacamole and then what
[830.56 - 833.60] happens is you just do too much fat
[832.32 - 835.84] too much fat too much for that too much
[833.60 - 838.40] fat and it stops the sugar
[835.84 - 840.16] from going into your cells because
[838.40 - 841.68] insulin has to be produced and then the
[840.16 - 843.84] fat blocks it now you got insulin
[841.68 - 843.84] resistance
[844.96 - 848.08] tomatoes really good that's going to
[847.04 - 851.84] make a great
[848.08 - 854.00] bruschetta so let's do one more cucumber
[851.84 - 854.00] here
[855.28 - 858.80] type 2 diabetes is such an easy fix it's
[857.52 - 863.44] ridiculous
[858.80 - 867.12] easiest fix there is so easy
[863.44 - 868.64] um science and research never knew
[867.12 - 871.12] still doesn't know how to get rid of
[868.64 - 872.16] type 2 diabetes so you got all that
[871.12 - 873.76] money
[872.16 - 875.84] millions and millions of dollars going
[873.76 - 878.80] into the medical industry
[875.84 - 879.28] billions of dollars big pharma and all
[878.80 - 881.44] all their
[879.28 - 883.44] paid for studies and they still can't
[881.44 - 886.56] fix type 2 diabetes
[883.44 - 888.56] it's such an easy fix it's such an easy
[886.56 - 890.40] fix
[888.56 - 892.24] get your liver better lower your fats
[890.40 - 894.80] get your liver stronger okay
[892.24 - 895.36] you learn how to eat right okay then you
[894.80 - 896.96] can heal
[895.36 - 898.48] that insulin resistance your pancreas
[896.96 - 900.48] builds up and boom you're out of it you
[898.48 - 904.40] don't even need insulin anymore
[900.48 - 904.40] um so
[907.52 - 913.84] wait let me just get this one going here
[909.20 - 913.84] because i want to still talk about that
[914.88 - 920.72] so what happens is when someone stops
[918.32 - 921.76] sugar okay so check this out you guys
[920.72 - 924.96] all right
[921.76 - 928.08] when someone stops sugar okay
[924.96 - 931.36] and they start to improve
[928.08 - 932.16] they're only improving because they're
[931.36 - 935.12] taking
[932.16 - 936.72] the critical piece away that you need to
[935.12 - 938.84] get into yourselves but they only
[936.72 - 941.36] improve
[938.84 - 944.08] because they took one
[941.36 - 945.36] of the very things out see it's it's fat
[944.08 - 948.08] and sugar
[945.36 - 949.04] combined that causes insulin resistance
[948.08 - 951.68] but it's fat
[949.04 - 952.72] that's the troublemaker and that's the
[951.68 - 955.68] big causer right
[952.72 - 957.04] but when you remove sugar then you have
[955.68 - 958.00] all this fat floating around in your
[957.04 - 961.52] bloodstream
[958.00 - 963.44] and less insulin is produced because
[961.52 - 964.80] there's not enough sugar floating around
[963.44 - 967.44] in your bloodstream
[964.80 - 969.12] so less insulin is produced so there's
[967.44 - 970.32] just it's just like okay but that's not
[969.12 - 972.00] the fix that's not
[970.32 - 973.28] how to fix it that's not how it works
[972.00 - 974.88] because guess what your diabetes is
[973.28 - 976.40] still there and it's not going away
[974.88 - 978.48] it's never going away because then all
[976.40 - 981.12] of a sudden you're gonna eat some sugar
[978.48 - 982.96] wow i've been on this diet for a long
[981.12 - 983.52] time i'm keeping all my carbohydrates
[982.96 - 985.84] away
[983.52 - 986.96] my doctor says my a1c is getting better
[985.84 - 988.96] it's dropping
[986.96 - 990.80] but yet i'm just dying for a
[988.96 - 991.68] carbohydrate i'm dying for a little bit
[990.80 - 994.40] of sugar
[991.68 - 996.32] let me eat this candy oh my god my a1c
[994.40 - 998.64] oh my god my sugar's off the chart
[996.32 - 1001.20] oh my god something's wrong and and what
[998.64 - 1002.08] happens is my type 2 diabetes is back in
[1001.20 - 1005.12] full force
[1002.08 - 1007.52] i had an orange i had a piece of bread
[1005.12 - 1008.72] but what the reality is the truth is if
[1007.52 - 1010.72] you take out the fats
[1008.72 - 1013.20] you can eat a piece of bread you can eat
[1010.72 - 1015.12] an orange you can eat a piece of candy
[1013.20 - 1016.56] and guess what you're not going to have
[1015.12 - 1017.60] any insulin resistance you're not going
[1016.56 - 1020.96] to have any type 2
[1017.60 - 1025.36] diabetes it's not even going to be there
[1020.96 - 1027.92] that's how it works anyway
[1025.36 - 1029.68] lucas thanks for the tip with the high
[1027.92 - 1031.84] uh quality spirulina
[1029.68 - 1033.52] it made almost all the difference to me
[1031.84 - 1037.12] lucas
[1033.52 - 1038.56] supplements being the highest quality
[1037.12 - 1040.40] or the best for a whole bunch of
[1038.56 - 1042.40] different reasons is critical for
[1040.40 - 1045.44] healing i've been saying this for years
[1042.40 - 1048.40] years ago years ago
[1045.44 - 1049.12] there was crap out for supplements crap
[1048.40 - 1051.12] right
[1049.12 - 1053.44] so it was really hard to get people
[1051.12 - 1056.96] better even if spirit of compassion said
[1053.44 - 1057.76] this person needs nettle leaf to get a
[1056.96 - 1060.72] nettle leaf
[1057.76 - 1061.28] product to do its job to take somebody
[1060.72 - 1064.08] to the
[1061.28 - 1065.52] finish line was hard right same thing
[1064.08 - 1067.28] spirit of compassion said this person
[1065.52 - 1068.56] needs spirulina to get toxic heavy
[1067.28 - 1070.24] metals out right like you're talking
[1068.56 - 1073.28] about lucas the spirulina
[1070.24 - 1075.52] then it's got to be the right kind and
[1073.28 - 1076.40] that's always been the problem out there
[1075.52 - 1078.08] you know always
[1076.40 - 1079.52] and this is the kind i use you guys know
[1078.08 - 1082.88] that the vimorgy
[1079.52 - 1085.44] uh v as in victor i am as in mary ergy
[1082.88 - 1086.56] dot com spin rg but and i'm not
[1085.44 - 1089.12] sponsored but it's
[1086.56 - 1091.28] it means everything the higher quality
[1089.12 - 1093.20] means everything to getting better
[1091.28 - 1094.64] and i that's been the fight all these
[1093.20 - 1097.52] years it's been like okay
[1094.64 - 1097.92] i can work with foods with people right
[1097.52 - 1101.36] but
[1097.92 - 1103.68] if they have these these epstein bars
[1101.36 - 1105.60] these shingles these the streptococcus
[1103.68 - 1108.64] they have these toxic heavy metals
[1105.60 - 1108.96] i need more than just just the foods you
[1108.64 - 1110.48] know
[1108.96 - 1112.16] spirit of compassion told me for years
[1110.48 - 1113.20] you need more than that it's like you
[1112.16 - 1116.72] have to have the best
[1113.20 - 1118.16] quality of of supplementation
[1116.72 - 1119.52] and so the vimraj is the best quality
[1118.16 - 1121.12] and they have a whole line of stuff
[1119.52 - 1122.08] that's incredible i got me and i got it
[1121.12 - 1123.52] here
[1122.08 - 1125.84] because it's what i take it's a
[1123.52 - 1127.12] magnesium i take it's vitamin c i take
[1125.84 - 1128.56] the micro state
[1127.12 - 1132.08] but anyway it does make a difference
[1128.56 - 1135.04] lucas and i'm glad you found that out
[1132.08 - 1136.08] rita says i just got out of my third

[1224.40 - 1230.32] radical fats are are fats that are
[1228.00 - 1232.00] see all foods have fats in them all
[1230.32 - 1235.20] foods all right
[1232.00 - 1236.96] and keep that in mind this cucumber
[1235.20 - 1238.00] right here this english cucumber i'm
[1236.96 - 1241.12] actually julianne
[1238.00 - 1243.20] right it has fat in it every single
[1241.12 - 1244.24] thing has fat in it those tomatoes have
[1243.20 - 1247.12] fat in it
[1244.24 - 1250.08] that basil has fat in it that onion has

[1250.08 - 1254.32] so so keep that in mind that's important
[1252.56 - 1257.44] to know right and then
[1254.32 - 1260.40] there's there's foods that have more fat
[1257.44 - 1262.00] they're made of fat mostly and i call
[1260.40 - 1265.36] those radical fats
[1262.00 - 1268.72] and there's a lot of healthy ones tahini
[1265.36 - 1270.80] sesame seeds sunflower seeds right
[1268.72 - 1272.16] hemp seeds these are healthy fats
[1270.80 - 1275.84] coconut
[1272.16 - 1276.64] right coconut oil these are healthy fats
[1275.84 - 1280.32] olive oil
[1276.64 - 1281.76] yeah healthy fat right so it's not like
[1280.32 - 1283.60] i don't know that people
[1281.76 - 1285.44] people pretend i don't know that or
[1283.60 - 1287.68] something it's actually really funny
[1285.44 - 1289.52] he doesn't know he doesn't know about
[1287.68 - 1291.28] fats he's against bats he doesn't know
[1289.52 - 1293.04] about what everybody's talking about in
[1291.28 - 1293.76] the trendy health world about healthy
[1293.04 - 1296.32] fats
[1293.76 - 1298.00] he's not aware of that oh really because
[1296.32 - 1299.36] i got everybody eating avocado
[1298.00 - 1301.68] because guess what it was considered to
[1299.36 - 1305.04] be poisonous 35 years ago
[1301.68 - 1307.28] the health scene was against avocado
[1305.04 - 1308.16] you were you were laughed off a lecture
[1307.28 - 1310.16] stage
[1308.16 - 1311.36] if you said an avocado was healthy fat
[1310.16 - 1313.36] did you know that
[1311.36 - 1314.64] you were laughed off of a health lecture
[1313.36 - 1318.08] stage
[1314.64 - 1320.48] and um and so i got avocado really
[1318.08 - 1322.24] really out there i mean i spent years
[1320.48 - 1327.20] teaching doctors teaching people
[1322.24 - 1327.20] teaching everybody about that and so
[1327.60 - 1332.00] um and it's a it's a better fat because
[1330.48 - 1333.68] all those years ago i was trying to get
[1332.00 - 1336.00] people off of the bad fats
[1333.68 - 1337.68] i was trying to get people off of this
[1336.00 - 1339.68] so i spent a lifetime trying to get
[1337.68 - 1343.36] people off of that right there
[1339.68 - 1345.84] okay to onto avocado years ago
[1343.36 - 1348.08] but here's the thing when you're
[1345.84 - 1350.72] chronically ill
[1348.08 - 1351.36] when that plate's greasy the plate's
[1350.72 - 1354.80] really greasy
[1351.36 - 1357.84] when you're chronically ill okay
[1354.80 - 1358.72] you need you need a step above that you
[1357.84 - 1361.36] need a step
[1358.72 - 1363.12] further than just the avocado the
[1361.36 - 1364.72] healthy nuts and seeds the almonds the
[1363.12 - 1365.52] almond butter right the peanuts the
[1364.72 - 1368.08] peanut butter
[1365.52 - 1369.52] the hemp seeds the coconut oil you need
[1368.08 - 1371.04] to step further than that
[1369.52 - 1372.96] if you're really sick you're really
[1371.04 - 1375.60] struggling you're really viral lupus
[1372.96 - 1377.52] multiple sclerosis um you know chronic
[1375.60 - 1378.56] fatigue syndrome me chronic fatigue
[1377.52 - 1380.08] syndrome different
[1378.56 - 1381.52] trigeminal neurology whatever it is
[1380.08 - 1382.88] right there's there's hundreds of
[1381.52 - 1386.24] conditions
[1382.88 - 1387.92] and you need more more than just
[1386.24 - 1389.52] it's not just good enough to be like i'm
[1387.92 - 1390.24] going to go keto and still have some
[1389.52 - 1391.76] avocado
[1390.24 - 1393.28] i'm going to be plant-based keto and
[1391.76 - 1394.24] still have my nuts and seeds every day
[1393.28 - 1396.56] and my cacao
[1394.24 - 1397.52] it's not enough if you want to go to the
[1396.56 - 1399.52] finish line
[1397.52 - 1402.08] and i've always taught that for 35 plus
[1399.52 - 1403.92] years it takes more than that
[1402.08 - 1406.08] it takes it takes much more than that
[1403.92 - 1406.80] you know and and that's really important
[1406.08 - 1409.44] to know
[1406.80 - 1409.44] it really is
[1410.48 - 1412.72] so
[1415.60 - 1418.88] erica what about type one
[1419.60 - 1422.88] um when it comes down to type one type
[1422.40 - 1425.28] one is
[1422.88 - 1426.80] is a is a pancreas injury science
[1425.28 - 1429.28] research doesn't know that but
[1426.80 - 1430.64] food poisoning um creates a lot of
[1429.28 - 1432.64] situations where people go
[1430.64 - 1434.32] they become type one they have that
[1432.64 - 1436.00] condition because of food poisoning
[1434.32 - 1437.52] you could have food poisoning and be
[1436.00 - 1439.60] type one a week later
[1437.52 - 1441.68] you get out food poisoning and be type
[1439.60 - 1442.80] one a year later two years later from
[1441.68 - 1445.44] food poisoning right
[1442.80 - 1447.28] right and also pathogens you know
[1445.44 - 1450.16] viruses get into the pancreas and they
[1447.28 - 1450.16] create type 1
[1450.56 - 1457.12] and and even with
[1454.16 - 1459.36] delayed type 1 where it's like a slow
[1457.12 - 1462.24] progression of type one
[1459.36 - 1463.20] um late in type one so even with that so
[1462.24 - 1466.48] um
[1463.20 - 1468.80] and and look there's there's a there's
[1466.48 - 1470.48] you always have to keep it in your heart
[1468.80 - 1471.44] and soul that there's always hope to
[1470.48 - 1473.68] heal
[1471.44 - 1475.36] it's just about doing doing enough of
[1473.68 - 1477.84] the right things to get there
[1475.36 - 1478.40] and that's what it is um i would take i
[1477.84 - 1480.96] would take
[1478.40 - 1481.52] uh i would take the medical medium books
[1480.96 - 1484.24] to
[1481.52 - 1486.48] to your doctor healer or whoever is in
[1484.24 - 1488.48] charge of your health care and
[1486.48 - 1490.00] and read the diabetes section take a
[1488.48 - 1492.48] look i offer a lot of things
[1490.00 - 1494.00] for type one and type do and you can see
[1492.48 - 1494.40] what's right for you with your doctor so
[1494.00 - 1495.92] you've got
[1494.40 - 1497.60] you've got that forward movement the
[1495.92 - 1500.72] most important thing with type one
[1497.60 - 1503.84] the most important thing is to
[1500.72 - 1506.08] make sure it's not getting worse
[1503.84 - 1507.36] okay even improving you can improve type
[1506.08 - 1509.76] one you can take
[1507.36 - 1511.36] type one a lot get it a lot better and a
[1509.76 - 1514.32] lot better and a lot better
[1511.36 - 1515.76] and not only that it's also about making
[1514.32 - 1516.72] sure type 1 doesn't get worse worse
[1515.76 - 1518.64] worse worse
[1516.72 - 1519.84] so it's doing the right things to keep
[1518.64 - 1521.44] type 1 stable
[1519.84 - 1523.28] so your pancreas doesn't get a further
[1521.44 - 1524.96] injury so it doesn't um
[1523.28 - 1526.56] doesn't become more problematic more
[1524.96 - 1528.48] inflamed and
[1526.56 - 1530.24] that's the key it's about hey i want my
[1528.48 - 1530.80] type 1 to be here for the rest of my
[1530.24 - 1533.12] life
[1530.80 - 1535.20] and not all of a sudden worse and that's
[1533.12 - 1537.12] the key or i want my type 1 not only
[1535.20 - 1538.56] here but i want my type 1 a lot better
[1537.12 - 1541.44] than what it is and that's the key
[1538.56 - 1542.96] too and ask your doctor if you can do 32
[1541.44 - 1544.88] ounces of celery juice
[1542.96 - 1546.08] ask your doctor if you can do that ask
[1544.88 - 1547.52] your doctor
[1546.08 - 1549.76] if you can do any of the protocols
[1547.52 - 1552.32] medical media protocols
[1549.76 - 1552.32] but anyway
[1554.84 - 1557.84] so
[1561.04 - 1564.88] i'm getting these cucumber noodles over
[1562.64 - 1564.88] here
[1565.92 - 1570.08] getting them in the bowl so right now
[1567.12 - 1574.32] this is what we're doing
[1570.08 - 1574.32] so there's my cucumber noodles
[1577.52 - 1581.68] still some more work to do still making
[1579.28 - 1584.56] some more noodles here you guys
[1581.68 - 1586.08] marianna there are people on natural
[1584.56 - 1588.40] health group in natural health groups
[1586.08 - 1591.76] spreading rumors about you anthony
[1588.40 - 1593.28] a friend told me this always oh my god
[1591.76 - 1594.88] of course
[1593.28 - 1596.56] there always is a lot of hate groups i
[1594.88 - 1598.96] think right
[1596.56 - 1599.84] um you know there's there's always that
[1598.96 - 1601.44] happening
[1599.84 - 1603.20] i think i'm an easy target because of
[1601.44 - 1606.80] discrimination
[1603.20 - 1609.36] and there's a ton of lies and
[1606.80 - 1610.64] i mean that's just how it's always been
[1609.36 - 1612.32] what happens is
[1610.64 - 1614.08] you know you get discriminated against
[1612.32 - 1616.40] when you hear a voice
[1614.08 - 1617.60] spirit of compassion since age four and
[1616.40 - 1619.68] you get discriminated
[1617.60 - 1621.36] against when you get too many people
[1619.68 - 1622.56] better because a lot of people get
[1621.36 - 1624.00] jealous in the health field in the
[1622.56 - 1626.32] health industry
[1624.00 - 1628.72] they get jealous they're like why does
[1626.32 - 1630.80] he have millions and millions of people
[1628.72 - 1632.24] following his information you know they
[1630.80 - 1633.68] just can't wrap their heads around it a
[1632.24 - 1634.64] lot of people they're either jealous or
[1633.68 - 1636.56] they're just
[1634.64 - 1638.16] psycho about it or something i mean it's
[1636.56 - 1639.92] really weird i think
[1638.16 - 1641.52] what happens is like why is he the
[1639.92 - 1644.88] number one health author
[1641.52 - 1648.16] in the world for seven years running why
[1644.88 - 1651.20] i mean and just so you know um
[1648.16 - 1652.72] the medical medium book series okay is
[1651.20 - 1653.52] the number one health series in the
[1652.72 - 1655.92] world
[1653.52 - 1657.84] right so keep that in mind because it
[1655.92 - 1659.60] works not because of promotion or money
[1657.84 - 1660.96] or marketing because i didn't use any pr
[1659.60 - 1662.72] marketing so
[1660.96 - 1664.24] there's a lot of lies i'll give you a
[1662.72 - 1665.28] whole rundown of just a few of them
[1664.24 - 1668.56] right now
[1665.28 - 1670.48] a number one lie he must have serious
[1668.56 - 1673.60] money behind his
[1670.48 - 1675.04] marketing and pr firms and how else did
[1673.60 - 1678.24] he get to where he is
[1675.04 - 1681.28] and 100 inaccurate all right
[1678.24 - 1684.64] no pr firms no publicists
[1681.28 - 1686.08] uh no money into pr and all that okay so
[1684.64 - 1686.96] that's number one that's a lie that's
[1686.08 - 1688.88] been out there
[1686.96 - 1690.80] a simple lie is everybody thought i was
[1688.88 - 1692.16] 27 years old for the longest time
[1690.80 - 1694.16] so every time i said i've been in this
[1692.16 - 1695.20] for 30 years everybody would go bananas
[1694.16 - 1696.72] and berserk
[1695.20 - 1698.40] and they'd be like that's impossible
[1696.72 - 1700.96] okay obviously you know
[1698.40 - 1703.04] i'm much much older than that and that's
[1700.96 - 1704.88] just one all on its own okay
[1703.04 - 1706.72] other lies too there's lots of them i
[1704.88 - 1707.60] mean it's just the list goes on and on
[1706.72 - 1709.36] and on but
[1707.60 - 1710.64] but i think what happens is for because
[1709.36 - 1711.84] i've talked to
[1710.64 - 1713.92] a couple of my friends about this
[1711.84 - 1716.24] doctors and stuff they're like look
[1713.92 - 1717.52] 500 million people in the world know who
[1716.24 - 1719.84] you are and
[1717.52 - 1720.72] medical medium information has spread
[1719.84 - 1722.48] beyond
[1720.72 - 1724.16] and around the world because it's the
[1722.48 - 1725.92] number one health selling
[1724.16 - 1728.32] series and health books there are on the
[1725.92 - 1730.40] planet and that's going to lead to
[1728.32 - 1732.24] a lot of discrimination especially where
[1730.40 - 1734.24] your source is coming from above
[1732.24 - 1736.84] since age four so there's gonna be lots
[1734.24 - 1738.88] of all that it's just just tons of that
[1736.84 - 1741.20] stuff
[1738.88 - 1741.20] um
[1744.72 - 1747.04] i mean
[1748.16 - 1753.84] but you gotta be careful you know with
[1749.92 - 1753.84] that and just you know
[1754.88 - 1759.20] there's so many lies it's just it's over
[1757.12 - 1760.88] it's it's over the chart i mean it's
[1759.20 - 1761.52] it's off the chart there's so many so
[1760.88 - 1763.28] many lies
[1761.52 - 1767.84] so i got my noodles going here i'm gonna

[1796.80 - 1799.76] just peeling this cucumber i'm trying to
[1798.16 - 1800.72] pay attention to this so i don't cut my
[1799.76 - 1804.48] hand

[1819.92 - 1824.48] than that
[1820.88 - 1826.00] um but anyway so you know the whole
[1824.48 - 1827.36] thing is so what you'll find in a lot of
[1826.00 - 1828.00] groups there's a lot of hate groups and
[1827.36 - 1831.92] stuff
[1828.00 - 1833.60] a lot of rumors were made up and spread
[1831.92 - 1835.52] and then of course people try to cancel
[1833.60 - 1836.00] me constantly so i'm always trying to be
[1835.52 - 1837.52] can't like
[1836.00 - 1839.44] always just trying to like cancel

[1845.52 - 1849.28] all of it i like laughing all the
[1847.36 - 1850.80] the stories and the fake stories and the
[1849.28 - 1854.72] lies and stuff like that
[1850.80 - 1857.52] did you know two women um came to me
[1854.72 - 1858.56] back last spring about a year ago and
[1857.52 - 1862.00] told me
[1858.56 - 1864.96] that an organization was paying
[1862.00 - 1866.08] was paying people to spread rumors and
[1864.96 - 1869.52] lies
[1866.08 - 1873.12] and so both these women were enter
[1869.52 - 1875.44] what they were they were approached and
[1873.12 - 1877.36] offered money but what they did instead
[1875.44 - 1878.00] of taking the money like so many do in
[1877.36 - 1880.00] the hate groups
[1878.00 - 1881.76] and stuff instead of taking the money
[1880.00 - 1885.04] these two women
[1881.76 - 1889.04] contacted medical media and
[1885.04 - 1891.36] let us know okay let us know
[1889.04 - 1893.68] about this thing that was happening
[1891.36 - 1897.60] where they were offering money
[1893.68 - 1900.32] to write stories claim things
[1897.60 - 1903.12] to try to take down the mm so that
[1900.32 - 1905.12] everybody stops healing around the world
[1903.12 - 1906.24] i'll tell you right now and it was the
[1905.12 - 1908.96] people you least
[1906.24 - 1910.40] expected that were actually spreading
[1908.96 - 1913.04] the lies and stories people that you
[1910.40 - 1914.00] would never think that seemed so sincere
[1913.04 - 1917.12] and so
[1914.00 - 1920.24] oh yeah you know medical medium and
[1917.12 - 1922.08] i'm just living my life and you know
[1920.24 - 1923.84] with my cute little family and whatever

[1926.32 - 1932.48] people you would never even believe
[1928.72 - 1932.48] so it's it's crazy how it works
[1933.28 - 1937.36] and they approached a lot of people they
[1935.36 - 1939.44] approached it's it's really
[1937.36 - 1940.80] it was so sinister and they could still
[1939.44 - 1944.16] be doing it

[1986.24 - 1989.04] information when you apply it right and
[1987.76 - 1990.80] you want to lose weight you can lose
[1989.04 - 1994.08] weight you get your liver healthy
[1990.80 - 1994.40] you lose all this unwanted weight and if
[1994.08 - 1996.32] you're
[1994.40 - 1998.32] underweight medical medium information
[1996.32 - 2001.20] can bring healthy weight back
[1998.32 - 2005.84] on when it's done correctly and people
[2001.20 - 2005.84] are using it correctly
[2007.52 - 2019.84] i'm chopping up some tomatoes right now
[2018.56 - 2022.88] i'm gonna read some more comments and
[2019.84 - 2022.88] help out the best i can
[2031.68 - 2034.40] so um
[2038.80 - 2042.00] because i'm gonna get a couple more
[2044.84 - 2047.84] things
[2056.00 - 2061.84] this is
[2072.84 - 2075.84] because
[2076.80 - 2080.64] see guys um if you just got on here
[2079.28 - 2083.12] making the bruschetta
[2080.64 - 2089.84] just some tomatoes got some noodles
[2083.12 - 2089.84] right here
[2098.56 - 2101.36] got it you know what happens with these
[2099.84 - 2102.96] little tomatoes if you're chopping them
[2101.36 - 2104.16] you can put them in a food processor and
[2102.96 - 2108.96] give it a pulse
[2104.16 - 2108.96] you can do that dr font
[2112.00 - 2118.24] good to see you on here great md
[2114.64 - 2118.24] patricia marie good to see you
[2119.36 - 2123.52] and you can you know one of the things
[2121.92 - 2124.24] is you could put i wouldn't put these in
[2123.52 - 2127.60] a blender
[2124.24 - 2130.08] i wouldn't do that i wouldn't put
[2127.60 - 2132.64] i wouldn't put um these cherry tomatoes
[2130.08 - 2132.64] in a blender
[2133.04 - 2137.12] because if you put them in a blender
[2134.88 - 2138.88] they're just going to turn into a soup
[2137.12 - 2140.32] and you don't want this soup you want
[2138.88 - 2142.64] this kind of choppy
[2140.32 - 2144.48] and cut in pieces okay that's how you
[2142.64 - 2147.76] want it
[2144.48 - 2150.64] that's the best way of doing it and
[2147.76 - 2151.84] if you do i have a garden yeah i love to
[2150.64 - 2153.60] grow stuff
[2151.84 - 2155.44] it's not a big garden or anything but i
[2153.60 - 2156.48] love to grow stuff whenever i can grow
[2155.44 - 2160.64] tomatoes
[2156.48 - 2160.64] grow cucumbers love to do it
[2165.20 - 2173.84] but yeah you want to
[2187.52 - 2191.20] so i'm gonna answer more questions for
[2188.88 - 2191.20] you guys
[2193.52 - 2196.40] ashley kevin
[2196.64 - 2201.84] good to see you
[2202.80 - 2205.76] love your videos
[2209.92 - 2214.56] these tomatoes are a little extra ripe
[2211.76 - 2215.60] which makes them um which makes them
[2214.56 - 2217.84] even really nice
[2215.60 - 2219.36] they're not over ripe because you know
[2217.84 - 2220.80] over ripe tomatoes are the worst you
[2219.36 - 2221.84] don't want overripe tomatoes you want to
[2220.80 - 2224.48] overripe anything
[2221.84 - 2229.60] where it's like it's going bad but um
[2224.48 - 2232.00] these tomatoes here are actually
[2229.60 - 2233.60] anne says what juicer do i use for
[2232.00 - 2236.72] celery juice
[2233.60 - 2240.84] i use the mm-900
[2236.72 - 2243.84] hds so it's by omega
[2240.84 - 2244.64] megajuicers.com omega that's the one i
[2243.84 - 2246.16] use
[2244.64 - 2249.28] it's an incredible juicer it's my
[2246.16 - 2253.44] favorite one um
[2249.28 - 2253.44] and uh company's great
[2253.68 - 2259.68] i love the juicer it really squeak it
[2257.36 - 2260.96] it just saves you so much money and
[2259.68 - 2263.52] that's the whole point
[2260.96 - 2265.28] um you can cut these in four but these
[2263.52 - 2265.92] are so extra ripe i'm cutting them in
[2265.28 - 2268.24] twos
[2265.92 - 2269.60] because they're so they're so ripe which
[2268.24 - 2270.96] is gonna make them really good it's
[2269.60 - 2272.32] going to make the sauce really good
[2270.96 - 2273.60] because what happens is with tomatoes
[2272.32 - 2275.12] you might get some cherry tomatoes that
[2273.60 - 2276.40] aren't really fully ripe and
[2275.12 - 2278.24] you buy them and they're really hard
[2276.40 - 2279.60] then you cut them in fours
[2278.24 - 2282.88] and that's what you do i'm cutting these
[2279.60 - 2284.96] in twos right now so if you guys
[2282.88 - 2287.52] you guys want to know because these are
[2284.96 - 2289.44] really nice and soft
[2287.52 - 2292.16] but they're juicy as heck which is going
[2289.44 - 2292.16] to be really good
[2293.20 - 2300.08] why do tomato skins not digest
[2296.64 - 2302.72] i see that question don't digest no they
[2300.08 - 2302.72] they digest
[2303.12 - 2309.68] they do they do your body will it's
[2306.56 - 2310.72] tomato skins are fibrous fiber doesn't
[2309.68 - 2313.60] digest
[2310.72 - 2314.56] but any nutrients around and in the
[2313.60 - 2316.96] fiber
[2314.56 - 2318.32] digests you just don't know that so when
[2316.96 - 2319.52] it comes out the other end and you're
[2318.32 - 2320.96] like wait a minute why didn't that
[2319.52 - 2323.36] tomato skin digest
[2320.96 - 2325.12] how come i see that tomato skin in the
[2323.36 - 2327.52] bathroom
[2325.12 - 2328.80] right how come i see that tomato skin in
[2327.52 - 2330.80] the toilet it's like
[2328.80 - 2332.96] well first of all everything that needed
[2330.80 - 2334.56] to be extracted from that tomato skin
[2332.96 - 2336.88] has been extracted
[2334.56 - 2338.40] the rest of that tomato skin which you
[2336.88 - 2341.44] can't tell
[2338.40 - 2342.24] is actually the the the useless part
[2341.44 - 2343.92] well it's just
[2342.24 - 2346.96] fiber like i said you always get plenty
[2343.92 - 2346.96] of fiber in all your foods
[2347.12 - 2350.64] much light in love says love you mmm can
[2349.04 - 2353.20] you talk about ocd
[2350.64 - 2355.84] yeah definitely run that by you a little
[2353.20 - 2355.84] bit so
[2356.16 - 2362.08] with ocd okay it's all about metals
[2359.28 - 2362.64] but it's all about metal deposits being
[2362.08 - 2364.64] rather
[2362.64 - 2366.72] larger that's the other thing on top of
[2364.64 - 2369.04] neurons so it's metal deposits being
[2366.72 - 2370.64] rather larger on top of neurons and
[2369.04 - 2371.28] they'll sit inside neurons and that's
[2370.64 - 2374.72] and i'll
[2371.28 - 2376.48] show you what happens is that um
[2374.72 - 2378.32] see these little metal deposits right
[2376.48 - 2380.08] here i have on the side of the brain so
[2378.32 - 2380.40] these shiny little aluminum pieces here
[2380.08 - 2382.48] right
[2380.40 - 2384.88] the deposits aren't that big big this is
[2382.48 - 2387.28] just a demonstration model right
[2384.88 - 2388.88] and so what happens is as aluminum
[2387.28 - 2391.44] collects and mercury collects
[2388.88 - 2392.16] on top of neurons it's kind of magnetic
[2391.44 - 2395.20] the more
[2392.16 - 2397.12] aluminum you get in your body the more
[2395.20 - 2398.72] aluminum goes to the brain to the very
[2397.12 - 2400.16] spots that have the aluminum to begin
[2398.72 - 2401.28] with same thing with mercury the more
[2400.16 - 2403.84] mercury you have in
[2401.28 - 2406.00] deposits on the neurons the more mercury
[2403.84 - 2408.32] like if you're eating tuna fish
[2406.00 - 2410.00] if you're doing um maybe some
[2408.32 - 2412.72] pharmaceuticals have mercury in it
[2410.00 - 2413.76] whatever it is you get more mercury
[2412.72 - 2415.68] added to
[2413.76 - 2417.44] the neurons to those little deposits
[2415.68 - 2419.04] right and then it depends on where the
[2417.44 - 2419.92] deposits are sitting that creates the
[2419.04 - 2422.00] ocd
[2419.92 - 2423.36] so deposits are sitting in the emotional
[2422.00 - 2425.92] center of the brain
[2423.36 - 2427.84] in those neurons that can be really
[2425.92 - 2429.60] intense that ocd could be much more
[2427.84 - 2431.44] intense versus sitting say somewhere in
[2429.60 - 2434.00] the left hemisphere right hemisphere
[2431.44 - 2434.80] somewhere else off the cuff somewhere uh
[2434.00 - 2436.88] you know
[2434.80 - 2438.00] somewhere in the distance depending on
[2436.88 - 2439.76] where in the tissue
[2438.00 - 2441.20] in the glial cells and so forth but what
[2439.76 - 2442.80] happens is
[2441.20 - 2444.56] you have an electrical impulse and that
[2442.80 - 2445.76] electricity is running so it's running
[2444.56 - 2447.92] through the brain right
[2445.76 - 2449.20] so you got that all that electricity is
[2447.92 - 2451.84] running through that brain
[2449.20 - 2453.52] when you think your thoughts okay so
[2451.84 - 2455.68] what happens is that's electricity and
[2453.52 - 2458.32] guess what that's metal
[2455.68 - 2461.36] electricity metal what happens when
[2458.32 - 2463.28] electricity meets metal
[2461.36 - 2464.88] okay think about that okay when
[2463.28 - 2466.48] electricity hits
[2464.88 - 2467.76] metal you don't want to during a
[2466.48 - 2469.52] lightning storm you don't want to go out
[2467.76 - 2471.36] there with like a golf club or something
[2469.52 - 2473.04] and stick it up in the air
[2471.36 - 2474.64] or you don't want to go out there with
[2473.04 - 2475.92] even an umbrella you don't want to go
[2474.64 - 2477.20] out there with anything
[2475.92 - 2479.28] you don't want you don't want to be out
[2477.20 - 2480.96] there with an antenna when there's a
[2479.28 - 2483.36] lightning storm
[2480.96 - 2484.08] you don't want electricity being drawn
[2483.36 - 2487.28] to metal
[2484.08 - 2489.12] so what ocd is is electrical impulses
[2487.28 - 2490.72] traveling through neurons and it hits a
[2489.12 - 2493.20] pocket of metal
[2490.72 - 2494.88] and when it hits pressing print said
[2493.20 - 2496.40] your kitchen is so inviting i'm honored
[2494.88 - 2499.36] hey glad to have you here
[2496.40 - 2501.36] um so when that me when that electricity
[2499.36 - 2504.64] hits the metal
[2501.36 - 2505.76] it then goes back up the neuron the
[2504.64 - 2508.56] other direction
[2505.76 - 2509.84] while another but while another
[2508.56 - 2512.56] electrical impulse
[2509.84 - 2514.32] is coming down that same neuron they hit
[2512.56 - 2515.84] each other so what happens is
[2514.32 - 2517.20] your electrical impulse is hitting the
[2515.84 - 2518.64] deposits of metal it's hitting the
[2517.20 - 2519.76] aluminum it's hitting the mercury it's
[2518.64 - 2521.76] hitting the copper
[2519.76 - 2522.88] mostly aluminum and mercury it comes
[2521.76 - 2525.20] down to ocd
[2522.88 - 2526.00] and then it hits it and then bounces
[2525.20 - 2527.76] back
[2526.00 - 2529.36] another another electrical impulse is
[2527.76 - 2530.88] coming down the same channel
[2529.36 - 2532.64] and it's hitting it too it's hitting the
[2530.88 - 2535.04] electrical impulse trying to go back up
[2532.64 - 2537.20] it's exploding you just got this repeat
[2535.04 - 2538.96] we constant repeat it's these electrical
[2537.20 - 2540.40] impulses hitting the metal and bouncing
[2538.96 - 2542.00] back up hitting the metal
[2540.40 - 2544.00] and that's when the obsessive thoughts
[2542.00 - 2545.60] come in it's like oh my god
[2544.00 - 2548.00] i can't break these thoughts i can't
[2545.60 - 2548.72] fall asleep my mind is racing it won't
[2548.00 - 2550.72] stop
[2548.72 - 2552.16] all this obsessive thoughts just and
[2550.72 - 2553.60] then those obsessive thoughts can
[2552.16 - 2555.84] actually lead to
[2553.60 - 2557.68] taking action you know what i mean like
[2555.84 - 2559.20] it makes you jump out of bed you get up
[2557.68 - 2560.00] upset you get frustrated now you're
[2559.20 - 2561.52] pacing
[2560.00 - 2562.80] now you're on a phone with a friend now
[2561.52 - 2564.56] you're on the phone with a family member
[2562.80 - 2566.48] and you're telling them your obsessive
[2564.56 - 2568.72] thoughts and you can't break it
[2566.48 - 2570.16] and it gets really difficult and it's
[2568.72 - 2573.92] hard to break that
[2570.16 - 2576.96] whole frequency um and
[2573.92 - 2578.72] it's like it's like i mean i've seen so
[2576.96 - 2581.76] many different cases of ocd
[2578.72 - 2582.56] and really bad ones terrible ones for so
[2581.76 - 2584.72] many years
[2582.56 - 2586.56] and one of the worst ones i've seen i've
[2584.72 - 2588.00] seen a lot of bad ones over the last 35
[2586.56 - 2591.92] years helping people
[2588.00 - 2593.92] is this woman who she needed to check
[2591.92 - 2595.84] her body to make sure her head was on
[2593.92 - 2597.28] her body it was an obsessive thought she
[2595.84 - 2600.56] was perfectly sane
[2597.28 - 2601.36] she's a great person and um but she had
[2600.56 - 2603.20] she's been
[2601.36 - 2605.52] she was at the time she went to like 20
[2603.20 - 2608.56] psychiatrists
[2605.52 - 2608.88] hundred doctors and it was in and she
[2608.56 - 2611.60] was
[2608.88 - 2613.12] really tortured by it and what happened
[2611.60 - 2614.72] was she would have to run into him she'd
[2613.12 - 2616.16] have to keep a mirror with her 24
[2614.72 - 2617.60] 7. she'd have to go somewhere with a
[2616.16 - 2618.24] mirror she'd have to go in her car with
[2617.60 - 2619.52] the mirror
[2618.24 - 2620.88] she'd have to see the mirror because she
[2619.52 - 2622.24] had to make sure her head was attached
[2620.88 - 2624.32] to her body
[2622.24 - 2626.32] and it became an obsessive thought she
[2624.32 - 2628.72] knew her head was attached to her body
[2626.32 - 2629.84] she knew of course she did she totally
[2628.72 - 2633.52] knew perfectly sane
[2629.84 - 2634.72] totally new and but that's not how it
[2633.52 - 2638.00] works with ocd
[2634.72 - 2638.56] you can know your door is locked you can
[2638.00 - 2640.40] know you
[2638.56 - 2641.84] check the stove i know those are the the
[2640.40 - 2643.92] basic versions of it
[2641.84 - 2645.60] but you you can know your you check the
[2643.92 - 2647.44] stove and drive away
[2645.60 - 2648.88] and still have to come back and check it
[2647.44 - 2651.68] one more time
[2648.88 - 2652.80] and i've seen people couldn't even leave
[2651.68 - 2654.48] their house they have to
[2652.80 - 2655.60] walk back into the house a hundred times
[2654.48 - 2657.52] to check their stove because they're
[2655.60 - 2659.52] scared to death it's on right
[2657.52 - 2661.44] but that's just those versions this is
[2659.52 - 2663.04] another type it's like she had to have a
[2661.44 - 2664.00] mirror with her all the time a compact
[2663.04 - 2667.28] she had a
[2664.00 - 2668.96] everywhere she went she had a mirror and
[2667.28 - 2670.56] and then there's people who go through
[2668.96 - 2672.08] they go through uh
[2670.56 - 2673.44] ocd where they just think something bad
[2672.08 - 2674.64] is gonna happen to a loved one something
[2673.44 - 2675.84] bad is gonna happen to a friend
[2674.64 - 2676.80] something bad is going to happen to
[2675.84 - 2678.08] somebody else
[2676.80 - 2679.36] something bad is going to happen to them
[2678.08 - 2681.20] and they can't shake it and they can't
[2679.36 - 2681.68] shake it becomes obsessive it devours
[2681.20 - 2684.08] them
[2681.68 - 2685.36] right there's so many versions of ocd
[2684.08 - 2687.12] that i've had to help people with and
[2685.36 - 2689.12] everything and it's it's all about what
[2687.12 - 2690.00] kind of metal how much metal where it is
[2689.12 - 2691.60] in the brain
[2690.00 - 2693.12] how the electrical impulses are hitting
[2691.60 - 2694.64] it are they traveling around it are they
[2693.12 - 2695.92] hitting it direct are they
[2694.64 - 2697.68] bouncing off the other electro
[2695.92 - 2699.52] electrical impulses
[2697.68 - 2701.44] and that's what ocd is so it's all about
[2699.52 - 2702.64] getting the metals out and that's
[2701.44 - 2704.56] that's why i've always said you know
[2702.64 - 2705.68] it's about the barley grass juice powder
[2704.56 - 2707.12] the spirulina
[2705.68 - 2708.32] you know the vimergy spirulina of
[2707.12 - 2709.44] emergency barley grass juice powder it's
[2708.32 - 2711.28] the one i use

[2711.28 - 2714.48] blueberries and dulce the heavy metal
[2712.80 - 2716.48] detox smoothie
[2714.48 - 2718.96] about getting those metals out so that
[2716.48 - 2721.92] you're free from that
[2718.96 - 2725.44] and that's important all right just
[2721.92 - 2725.44] going to cut up a few more tomatoes here
[2726.40 - 2729.60] this is such a great dish and it's so
[2728.88 - 2732.24] easy
[2729.60 - 2732.88] to make i'm just taking my time i mean
[2732.24 - 2734.48] honestly
[2732.88 - 2747.84] could put these in a food processor and
[2734.48 - 2747.84] pulse it but i like chopping them
[2749.36 - 2753.04] so i see a question by karen i want to
[2751.12 - 2754.32] gain weight as well potatoes don't make
[2753.04 - 2756.88] me gain
[2754.32 - 2758.24] because there's no fat on them are you
[2756.88 - 2760.00] eating enough of them
[2758.24 - 2762.08] if you want like if you want to gain
[2760.00 - 2766.48] weight
[2762.08 - 2768.32] um i mean i have athletes
[2766.48 - 2769.52] on potatoes they're they don't do any
[2768.32 - 2772.32] fats and they're
[2769.52 - 2774.16] they're stoking with muscles all of that
[2772.32 - 2776.32] are you are you using your muscles
[2774.16 - 2777.52] so you can gain weight by building a
[2776.32 - 2780.48] little bit of muscle
[2777.52 - 2782.32] intraskeletal muscles muscles all around
[2780.48 - 2783.28] your body you can gain five pounds of
[2782.32 - 2785.44] weight
[2783.28 - 2788.40] um using those muscles are you doing
[2785.44 - 2791.52] resistance training are you taking walks
[2788.40 - 2792.64] are you swimming are you riding a
[2791.52 - 2794.40] bicycle

[2794.40 - 2797.60] you building a little muscle
[2795.92 - 2799.68] that will put on a little weight just
[2797.60 - 2802.72] that alone and potatoes build muscle
[2799.68 - 2805.84] so also are you eating enough
[2802.72 - 2807.28] uh potatoes are you hungry not hungry
[2805.84 - 2809.04] are you only eating one potato two
[2807.28 - 2810.64] potato three potato four
[2809.04 - 2811.84] like what are you doing and that's one
[2810.64 - 2813.28] thing too these are i'm trying to help
[2811.84 - 2815.68] you be your own detective
[2813.28 - 2817.28] okay are you doing more bananas bring in
[2815.68 - 2819.04] some more bananas bring in some more
[2817.28 - 2820.64] dates get some more calories and you
[2819.04 - 2822.00] might be low calorie
[2820.64 - 2824.48] to what you're doing you might be an
[2822.00 - 2827.04] active person a really active person
[2824.48 - 2828.08] but your calories are low but your
[2827.04 - 2830.00] calories are low
[2828.08 - 2831.84] you're not eating enough just not a lot
[2830.00 - 2833.52] of calories in a potato right
[2831.84 - 2835.04] not and it's not like it's not a
[2833.52 - 2837.60] chocolate cake
[2835.04 - 2839.04] um you know unless it's those french
[2837.60 - 2840.48] fries i showed you earlier it's just
[2839.04 - 2842.80] french fries you know that's a different
[2840.48 - 2845.04] story all that oil right
[2842.80 - 2847.20] but plus what happens is when you get
[2845.04 - 2849.60] healthy and you start to clean
[2847.20 - 2851.20] house and you start you start to clean
[2849.60 - 2852.80] up those fats and you start to clean up
[2851.20 - 2854.96] the processed foods and
[2852.80 - 2856.72] you're doing the low fat what happens is
[2854.96 - 2858.32] you're losing all toxic swelling you're
[2856.72 - 2861.44] not swelling anymore
[2858.32 - 2863.28] a lot of the guys and and women too that
[2861.44 - 2864.80] i see out there that even fitness and
[2863.28 - 2865.76] everything you can see where they're
[2864.80 - 2867.52] swelling
[2865.76 - 2869.28] where they're swollen there's a lot of
[2867.52 - 2869.60] dudes out there that are you know that
[2869.28 - 2872.00] are
[2869.60 - 2873.84] stoking some muscles but they're also
[2872.00 - 2876.88] they're also got a layer
[2873.84 - 2877.92] a layer of fat and swelling a layer of
[2876.88 - 2879.84] water
[2877.92 - 2881.52] over their muscles so it makes them even
[2879.84 - 2883.44] look bigger they got a layer
[2881.52 - 2885.36] they got that bulk and it's a lot of
[2883.44 - 2886.00] swelling and when that swell lets the
[2885.36 - 2887.52] liver not
[2886.00 - 2889.60] working good you know when you get rid
[2887.52 - 2892.00] of that swelling and you just have the
[2889.60 - 2893.36] muscle by itself boom you just lost 15
[2892.00 - 2895.20] pounds it's like what happened but
[2893.36 - 2897.20] meanwhile you're all muscle
[2895.20 - 2898.64] but but but as far as going on i'm just
[2897.20 - 2899.92] giving you different examples out there
[2898.64 - 2901.52] in case anybody's going through any of
[2899.92 - 2904.72] that i'm trying to help everybody
[2901.52 - 2906.00] but keep in mind that are you doing
[2904.72 - 2908.32] enough calories are you doing enough
[2906.00 - 2909.84] potato you might be an active person
[2908.32 - 2912.08] and another thing too are you doing
[2909.84 - 2913.44] anything to use your muscles to build
[2912.08 - 2915.52] some muscle right
[2913.44 - 2917.36] um that's that's a whole thing on its
[2915.52 - 2919.92] own too so you're using enough muscle to
[2917.36 - 2922.56] build your muscle
[2919.92 - 2924.72] um little muscles count you can get five
[2922.56 - 2926.40] pounds all in its own right there

[2928.80 - 2932.40] and i can't even ride my bike i can't
[2930.48 - 2933.44] even take walks because i'm doing 18

[2941.60 - 2945.36] i know that if i'm not running for a
[2943.28 - 2947.12] while and i'm not biking for a while and
[2945.36 - 2950.56] i'm just working and it goes on for
[2947.12 - 2952.00] months and and i know that i'll lose a
[2950.56 - 2954.24] few pounds
[2952.00 - 2956.00] of of you know lose it like a couple of
[2954.24 - 2957.84] pounds and be like hey i think that
[2956.00 - 2959.92] couple and then you got hop back on the
[2957.84 - 2961.92] bicycle and you do bite the bike
[2959.92 - 2963.92] three times a week and all of a sudden
[2961.92 - 2966.32] all that muscle comes back and boom
[2963.92 - 2967.20] you're all of a sudden five pounds
[2966.32 - 2969.12] heavier
[2967.20 - 2970.88] you're also five pounds of muscle seven
[2969.12 - 2971.76] pounds of muscle and then you go and you

[3007.04 - 3011.84] um and um
[3010.16 - 3013.68] and and also you know it's a personal
[3011.84 - 3014.08] preference to where someone wants to be
[3013.68 - 3015.44] too
[3014.08 - 3017.28] someone might look at you and be like
[3015.44 - 3018.96] hey you look really amazing
[3017.28 - 3021.52] and you know another person might be
[3018.96 - 3024.00] like you need to put on weight it's like

[3047.60 - 3055.84] weight what is your recommendation
[3050.88 - 3055.84] first thing i would do is um
[3057.28 - 3062.88] checking to make sure i don't have a bad
[3058.56 - 3062.88] onion here the first thing i would do
[3064.08 - 3069.52] is is get the liver in a better place
[3067.28 - 3071.12] and that's about lowering fats what's
[3069.52 - 3072.16] your diet like how many fats are you
[3071.12 - 3074.56] eating
[3072.16 - 3076.88] are you eating too much oils are you
[3074.56 - 3080.48] eating
[3076.88 - 3082.72] are you eating too much too much avocado
[3080.48 - 3083.92] too much oil too much chicken too much
[3082.72 - 3085.44] beef too much
[3083.92 - 3088.64] you know too much of all that kind of
[3085.44 - 3091.36] fat is is that what is that going on
[3088.64 - 3094.24] or are you doing something different
[3091.36 - 3095.76] guys i'm going to grab another onion
[3094.24 - 3111.84] that onion was a little tricky i'll be
[3095.76 - 3111.84] right there
[3122.84 - 3125.92] so
[3124.64 - 3128.08] so i would try to get the liver
[3125.92 - 3128.80] healthier take the fats away for a
[3128.08 - 3130.40] little while
[3128.80 - 3132.40] how about do the medical meeting morning
[3130.40 - 3133.36] cleanse have you done the medical medium
[3132.40 - 3135.20] morning cleanse
[3133.36 - 3137.20] do some lemon water first thing in the
[3135.20 - 3138.88] morning flush out that liver
[3137.20 - 3140.56] then move on to celery juice a half an
[3138.88 - 3141.92] hour later got a nice onion right here
[3140.56 - 3145.52] you guys
[3141.92 - 3148.56] and take out the radical fats
[3145.52 - 3149.76] no fats at least till noon at least
[3148.56 - 3152.40] until noon
[3149.76 - 3153.92] no nut butters no oils no olives not
[3152.40 - 3157.20] that people eat a lot of olives they
[3153.92 - 3159.12] don't but they do a lot of olive oil
[3157.20 - 3162.16] that's what i would do there is i would
[3159.12 - 3164.96] i would at least have the fats out
[3162.16 - 3166.48] until noon right i would keep it fats
[3164.96 - 3168.32] once a day if you're somebody used to
[3166.48 - 3171.68] eating fats like chicken
[3168.32 - 3173.28] beef uh fish avocados nuts and seeds
[3171.68 - 3176.32] pick the one you want
[3173.28 - 3178.64] and make that the only one if it's beef
[3176.32 - 3180.48] then you have beef for dinner right if
[3178.64 - 3182.00] it's chicken have chicken for dinner if
[3180.48 - 3183.44] it's nuts and seeds or nut butters
[3182.00 - 3186.08] have it later on in the afternoon or
[3183.44 - 3187.60] dinner um if it's avocado have your
[3186.08 - 3188.48] guacamole at night for dinner start with
[3187.60 - 3190.08] that now
[3188.48 - 3193.04] if that doesn't cut it your liver is
[3190.08 - 3195.60] definitely stagnant and sluggish
[3193.04 - 3196.32] so then i would go days without fats i
[3195.60 - 3198.64] would go
[3196.32 - 3199.52] just complete days with no radical fats
[3198.64 - 3202.56] on any level
[3199.52 - 3205.52] take radical fats away i would do maybe
[3202.56 - 3209.04] the 369 advanced cleanse
[3205.52 - 3210.08] 369 advanced cleanse or 369 original
[3209.04 - 3211.84] cleanse
[3210.08 - 3213.84] and i would repeat it pick the one you
[3211.84 - 3214.96] want to do the but you can take it as
[3213.84 - 3216.40] far as you want to go there's no reason
[3214.96 - 3218.32] why you can't lose weight
[3216.40 - 3219.36] everybody and anybody can lose unwanted
[3218.32 - 3223.60] weight with the medical medium
[3219.36 - 3226.16] information if they actually apply it
[3223.60 - 3227.60] i wouldn't do these you're not you're
[3226.16 - 3228.08] not going to lose weight easy with these
[3227.60 - 3230.72] unless
[3228.08 - 3233.04] you've already been eating really bad
[3230.72 - 3234.08] processed foods really bad greasy fried
[3233.04 - 3235.28] foods or just
[3234.08 - 3237.04] chunk of cake or whatever you're eating

[3418.48 - 3422.96] far as this recipe
[3419.76 - 3423.44] so chopped garlic i got a mincer right
[3422.96 - 3425.44] here
[3423.44 - 3426.96] i was gonna mince it you can do chopped

[3450.72 - 3454.88] because of you
[3452.00 - 3455.92] how can i get rid of lipomas sending
[3454.88 - 3461.28] lots of love
[3455.92 - 3466.00] thank you for my family
[3461.28 - 3469.12] lipomas lipomas have a little
[3466.00 - 3474.24] tentacle on them so they have a little
[3469.12 - 3476.40] um lipomas actually have a little
[3474.24 - 3479.52] those onions are really powerful that
[3476.40 - 3479.52] onion i brought in here
[3479.68 - 3487.12] god that's a really good one
[3484.88 - 3488.64] the power those onions have for actually
[3487.12 - 3491.84] killing pathogens
[3488.64 - 3493.52] it's a powerful herb really is
[3491.84 - 3495.76] i'm going to put a little bit of garlic
[3493.52 - 3499.04] in here lipomas have a little
[3495.76 - 3503.84] um blood vessel
[3499.04 - 3503.84] that comes off of it that blood vessel
[3504.80 - 3511.04] that blood vessel is its feeding
[3508.24 - 3514.48] tube so that blood vessel coming off of
[3511.04 - 3516.88] its feeding tube so say this is a lipoma
[3514.48 - 3517.68] say this egg is a lipoma right and it's
[3516.88 - 3519.44] inside of you
[3517.68 - 3521.52] people get lipomas in their arms they
[3519.44 - 3523.36] get lipomas in their chest
[3521.52 - 3525.28] they get them in their stomach they get
[3523.36 - 3526.48] them everywhere i mean they get them in
[3525.28 - 3528.40] their legs
[3526.48 - 3530.64] they get them on the back of their head
[3528.40 - 3533.28] i mean they just get lipomas everywhere
[3530.64 - 3535.12] and then there's this little tentacle
[3533.28 - 3538.32] that hangs off of light lipoma
[3535.12 - 3540.72] and it looks like this okay
[3538.32 - 3541.76] so you got a lipoma in you and it's got
[3540.72 - 3544.32] a little tentacle
[3541.76 - 3545.36] coming off of it right and the tentacle
[3544.32 - 3548.00] is a blood vessel
[3545.36 - 3548.96] okay angiogenesis right a little blood
[3548.00 - 3552.48] vessel
[3548.96 - 3552.48] and all of a sudden
[3553.28 - 3558.08] you eat a food it really likes like an
[3556.00 - 3560.00] egg now that's a lipoma i'm pretending
[3558.08 - 3561.44] it's a lipoma okay not an egg all of a
[3560.00 - 3563.28] sudden you eat an egg
[3561.44 - 3564.80] and that egg material finds its way
[3563.28 - 3565.84] through the bloodstream stream all the
[3564.80 - 3567.52] hormones in the egg
[3565.84 - 3569.12] whether it's organic or not or free
[3567.52 - 3570.64] range they find their way in the
[3569.12 - 3572.16] bloodstream and the proteins and eggs
[3570.64 - 3574.00] find their way and they go up they get
[3572.16 - 3575.28] drawn up into that tentacle
[3574.00 - 3577.12] and they go right into the lipoma and
[3575.28 - 3579.76] the lipoma goes whoa we just
[3577.12 - 3581.44] cash we just cashed in some good food we
[3579.76 - 3583.44] just got some good food
[3581.44 - 3585.12] and that's what they do so then over
[3583.44 - 3587.12] time
[3585.12 - 3588.64] over time the lipoma grows becomes
[3587.12 - 3591.28] bigger and then you can get multiple
[3588.64 - 3592.96] but all of a sudden boom you got two
[3591.28 - 3595.20] lipomas
[3592.96 - 3597.44] next to each other and one is growing
[3595.20 - 3599.52] another tentacle off the other one
[3597.44 - 3600.88] the other lipomas actually attached the
[3599.52 - 3603.12] other one with a blood vessel
[3600.88 - 3604.88] now you got two and they're all nice and
[3603.12 - 3605.92] happy and they're waiting for gluten
[3604.88 - 3607.52] they're waiting for eggs
[3605.92 - 3609.20] milk cheese butter they're waiting for
[3607.52 - 3615.84] toxic heavy metals
[3609.20 - 3615.84] they're waiting for anything
[3617.68 - 3622.08] some eggs over there okay let's go with
[3619.44 - 3622.08] some lemon
[3623.36 - 3627.76] um ask your doctor if you're okay with
[3626.00 - 3630.24] higher melatonin higher
[3627.76 - 3631.84] higher dosage of melatonin um let me
[3630.24 - 3634.40] grab one i think i don't have it right
[3631.84 - 3634.40] here actually
[3635.52 - 3639.76] all right well i usually have the
[3637.84 - 3640.80] vimergy melatonin in my cabinet but i
[3639.76 - 3643.04] don't right now
[3640.80 - 3644.72] i must have finished it up because it's
[3643.04 - 3647.68] it's such a great
[3644.72 - 3648.80] great sup incredible quality but anyway
[3647.68 - 3651.20] melatonin
[3648.80 - 3653.84] ask your doctor if he's okay or she's
[3651.20 - 3656.96] okay if you start doing melatonin
[3653.84 - 3658.48] or melatonin at a high dosage like ask
[3656.96 - 3659.36] your doctor if 20 milligrams of
[3658.48 - 3661.84] melatonin
[3659.36 - 3663.76] is right for you because or 10
[3661.84 - 3666.48] milligrams or
[3663.76 - 3667.68] 5 milligrams or more and what melatonin
[3666.48 - 3671.12] does
[3667.68 - 3674.32] is it inhibits lipomas from growing
[3671.12 - 3676.24] so it's phytochemical compounds in
[3674.32 - 3677.28] melatonin that end up going into the
[3676.24 - 3679.92] lipoma
[3677.28 - 3682.72] right they go into the lipoma and then
[3679.92 - 3684.56] the lipoma can't grow
[3682.72 - 3686.00] it doesn't have the ability to grow so
[3684.56 - 3688.08] it stays the size because that's the key
[3686.00 - 3690.80] i've always told people with lipomas
[3688.08 - 3692.40] you want them to stay the size they are
[3690.80 - 3694.88] or shrink
[3692.40 - 3697.28] and you can you can get lipomas down if
[3694.88 - 3698.00] you really keep that diet clean and
[3697.28 - 3699.60] you're doing the right
[3698.00 - 3701.20] supps and you get metals out of your
[3699.60 - 3703.76] lipoma because what happens is when your
[3701.20 - 3706.48] lipoma
[3703.76 - 3708.40] when your lipomas starts to absorb
[3706.48 - 3710.56] things like spirulina
[3708.40 - 3712.40] barley grass juice powder the wild
[3710.56 - 3714.32] blueberries when it starts to absorb the
[3712.40 - 3716.72] heavy metal detox smoothie
[3714.32 - 3718.56] and it goes into the lipoma then that
[3716.72 - 3721.12] heavy metal detox movie starts to grab
[3718.56 - 3723.44] onto metals in that lipoma
[3721.12 - 3725.60] and draws them out and so your lipoma
[3723.44 - 3727.28] doesn't have metals in it anymore
[3725.60 - 3731.84] because metals help life homeless to
[3727.28 - 3731.84] grow too what is the 369 cleanse
[3732.32 - 3736.64] medical medium cleanse the heal

[3747.12 - 3751.52] cleanse is so i'm going to do a little
[3750.32 - 3754.08] bit of lemon
[3751.52 - 3756.24] and teaspoon of raw honey do a little
[3754.08 - 3758.48] bit of raw honey here
[3756.24 - 3761.12] and i'm going to mix this a little bit
[3758.48 - 3761.12] of raw honey
[3763.04 - 3770.80] like that and i'm going to do
[3767.52 - 3770.80] i'm gonna squeeze some lemon in this
[3780.32 - 3783.84] squeeze a little lemon
[3785.28 - 3791.76] fat doesn't make you fat it does brianna
[3788.72 - 3792.80] it does when your liver says i had
[3791.76 - 3797.84] enough
[3792.80 - 3797.84] fat will make you fat
[3798.08 - 3801.68] that's what happens that's why people
[3800.08 - 3804.80] who go keto gain weight
[3801.68 - 3806.40] later because their liver had enough i'm
[3804.80 - 3807.44] not saying keto is the worst thing to do
[3806.40 - 3808.96] it's actually a good
[3807.44 - 3810.48] it's a good starting point for a lot of
[3808.96 - 3811.20] people because it gets you off processed
[3810.48 - 3813.36] food i'm not
[3811.20 - 3814.24] ripping into it like it's bad or
[3813.36 - 3816.64] something
[3814.24 - 3818.32] you can be plant-based in keto okay you
[3816.64 - 3820.00] can be plant-based in keto you can be
[3818.32 - 3821.68] animal protein in keto and it gets you
[3820.00 - 3823.84] at least off of processed foods and
[3821.68 - 3825.44] gluten and all that and you can start
[3823.84 - 3826.16] even losing some weight for a lot of
[3825.44 - 3827.60] people
[3826.16 - 3831.52] but it but there's a lot of people that
[3827.60 - 3833.92] can't so what happens is that
[3831.52 - 3835.28] fat made me fat and kept me fat alison
[3833.92 - 3838.56] says yeah
[3835.28 - 3839.20] fat makes you fat radical fats make you
[3838.56 - 3841.20] fat
[3839.20 - 3842.80] it just depends are you young if you're
[3841.20 - 3846.00] really young and your liver isn't
[3842.80 - 3847.68] toasted yet then you know if you're
[3846.00 - 3849.68] really young and your liver isn't
[3847.68 - 3851.76] burnt out yet you're not going to get
[3849.68 - 3852.00] fat eating fat yet but you're gonna get
[3851.76 - 3853.92] fat
[3852.00 - 3855.60] eating fat eventually no matter what it
[3853.92 - 3857.36] gets everybody okay
[3855.60 - 3858.96] so if you're 21 years old you're 22
[3857.36 - 3860.08] years old and fat hasn't made you fat
[3858.96 - 3861.76] yet it's going to make you fat when
[3860.08 - 3863.36] you're 45 years old
[3861.76 - 3865.12] and doesn't rely doesn't your doesn't
[3863.36 - 3866.24] your life matter doesn't your life count
[3865.12 - 3867.52] it's going to make you fat when you're
[3866.24 - 3868.80] 52 years old
[3867.52 - 3870.16] it's gonna make you fat when you're 60
[3868.80 - 3871.20] years old it's gonna make you fat
[3870.16 - 3872.40] someday and it's gonna
[3871.20 - 3875.12] somewhere along the line you're gonna
[3872.40 - 3876.80] get fat from fat
[3875.12 - 3878.08] the question is that everybody always
[3876.80 - 3879.28] says which i just saw the question here
[3878.08 - 3882.56] doesn't your fat
[3879.28 - 3883.60] doesn't your brain need fat um that's
[3882.56 - 3886.00] interesting because your brain's not
[3883.60 - 3889.04] made out of fat
[3886.00 - 3890.72] your brain is made out of glycogen and
[3889.04 - 3892.64] the more fat you eat and the less
[3890.72 - 3894.80] carbohydrate you eat
[3892.64 - 3896.16] and the less fruits and the less and the
[3894.80 - 3898.64] less um
[3896.16 - 3899.60] potatoes and and sweet potatoes and
[3898.64 - 3902.96] winter squash
[3899.60 - 3905.68] and the less of those things you eat um
[3902.96 - 3906.72] your your brain starts to starve starve
[3905.68 - 3908.96] with glycogen
[3906.72 - 3911.84] and then your brain shrinks everybody's
[3908.96 - 3913.68] brain shrinks
[3911.84 - 3915.92] everybody i was talking to a
[3913.68 - 3919.12] neurosurgeon last month about this
[3915.92 - 3922.80] he says he says he's seen it his whole
[3919.12 - 3927.44] life as a neurosurgeon everybody's
[3922.80 - 3927.44] brain everybody's brain shrinks
[3929.20 - 3934.32] he was asking me why
[3932.48 - 3936.72] he was asking me why does everybody's
[3934.32 - 3940.32] brain shrink
[3936.72 - 3942.96] i said because it's a glucose glycogen
[3940.32 - 3944.24] deprivation for too many years and you
[3942.96 - 3946.72] get older and your brain starts to
[3944.24 - 3948.24] atrophy it's called brain atrophy
[3946.72 - 3949.84] and just so you know your brain is not
[3948.24 - 3951.60] made out of fat it's made out of sugar
[3949.84 - 3952.80] it's made out of storage glycogen which
[3951.60 - 3954.40] is sugar okay
[3952.80 - 3955.92] that's what your brain's made out of is
[3954.40 - 3956.88] there fat in your brain yeah but there's
[3955.92 - 3959.68] traces of fat
[3956.88 - 3961.28] throughout your entire body everywhere
[3959.68 - 3963.04] in your body there's there's a trace of
[3961.28 - 3964.40] fat in every part of your body omega-3
[3963.04 - 3967.84] and squalene and all that
[3964.40 - 3970.88] it's everywhere in the body right but
[3967.84 - 3972.72] um then there's traces of fat in every
[3970.88 - 3974.16] single food and these cucumber noodles
[3972.72 - 3976.32] right here and that basil sitting in
[3974.16 - 3978.16] front of me and these tomatoes right
[3976.32 - 3979.76] and i'm not against healthy fats if you
[3978.16 - 3981.20] want healthy fats but the point is is
[3979.76 - 3984.32] your brain
[3981.20 - 3985.44] doesn't need fat it needs sugar you run
[3984.32 - 3988.40] on sugar your brain
[3985.44 - 3989.12] thinks with sugar glucose is how this
[3988.40 - 3992.88] runs
[3989.12 - 3995.52] it's glucose take your sugar okay
[3992.88 - 3997.04] this is funny okay when you go to the
[3995.52 - 4000.16] doctor for a checkup
[3997.04 - 4003.84] are they checking your blood fat
[4000.16 - 4005.68] no they're not if that was so important
[4003.84 - 4007.12] i'm scratching my head here
[4005.68 - 4008.72] if that was so important wouldn't they
[4007.12 - 4011.12] be checking your blood fat
[4008.72 - 4012.88] they don't care about that they just
[4011.12 - 4014.80] care about your blood sugar
[4012.88 - 4016.80] because guess what happens without blood
[4014.80 - 4018.84] sugar guess what happens without glucose
[4016.80 - 4023.52] to your cells you die
[4018.84 - 4026.40] yeah we we as a human race human species
[4023.52 - 4027.44] sugar's so critical your brain won't run
[4026.40 - 4030.00] it won't even
[4027.44 - 4030.72] it won't run it won't even work without
[4030.00 - 4032.64] sugar
[4030.72 - 4035.84] does your brain need fat no it needs
[4032.64 - 4035.84] sugar or you're dead
[4035.92 - 4040.56] if your brain doesn't get sugar your
[4038.08 - 4044.72] brain can't exist anymore
[4040.56 - 4047.76] if your brain doesn't get fat it exists
[4044.72 - 4049.44] you can live without radical fat
[4047.76 - 4051.04] overt fat whatever you want to call it
[4049.44 - 4052.24] you can live without fats your whole
[4051.04 - 4053.68] life
[4052.24 - 4056.16] because there's fats in everything you
[4053.68 - 4057.52] eat anyway and your brain doesn't rely
[4056.16 - 4061.20] on fat
[4057.52 - 4063.44] you can't live without sugar
[4061.20 - 4065.28] in some form shape or some way even if
[4063.44 - 4066.40] you eat red meat there's sugar in the
[4065.28 - 4068.00] blood of the meat
[4066.40 - 4070.64] and it's caramelized when you cook it
[4068.00 - 4072.40] it's in there blood sugar animals blood
[4070.64 - 4073.36] sugar animals blood inside the meat is
[4072.40 - 4076.08] blood sugar
[4073.36 - 4077.28] and no matter what your brain has to
[4076.08 - 4079.44] have sugar or
[4077.28 - 4080.48] you don't exist anymore and that's why
[4079.44 - 4082.72] blood sugar is so
[4080.48 - 4083.92] critical that's why they've been testing
[4082.72 - 4087.12] it checking for it's
[4083.92 - 4089.44] all of this so
[4087.12 - 4090.40] and everyone's on caffeine which is fake
[4089.44 - 4092.16] energy
[4090.40 - 4093.44] to keep them energetic while they're on
[4092.16 - 4095.52] their high fat diets
[4093.44 - 4097.76] it's like stay on your high fat diet
[4095.52 - 4098.88] avoid all sugars avoid all fruit avoid
[4097.76 - 4100.96] all potatoes
[4098.88 - 4102.72] stay on your high fat diet and then use
[4100.96 - 4104.24] caffeine for fake energy i mean that's
[4102.72 - 4106.08] what people do when really
[4104.24 - 4107.68] the brain starts to atrophy caffeine
[4106.08 - 4109.04] causes atrophy in everybody's brain it's
[4107.68 - 4110.64] like
[4109.04 - 4112.40] got all these people all these elders
[4110.64 - 4113.60] all these people that are getting older
[4112.40 - 4115.44] their brain's atrophying they're
[4113.60 - 4116.72] drinking caffeine their whole life
[4115.44 - 4118.64] they're not getting enough sugar to
[4116.72 - 4120.24] their brain they're getting insulin
[4118.64 - 4121.68] resistant so they can't even get sugar
[4120.24 - 4123.36] to the brain and they're just wasting
[4121.68 - 4125.44] away and you just age fast and
[4123.36 - 4133.84] everything else
[4125.44 - 4133.84] you know i mean
[4135.92 - 4141.04] and a lot of people crave sugar because
[4139.44 - 4143.76] they're really craving like
[4141.04 - 4145.28] glucose that's what it is their brains
[4143.76 - 4146.00] craving glucose and a lot of people
[4145.28 - 4148.48] crave salt
[4146.00 - 4149.12] because they're craving trace minerals
[4148.48 - 4152.24] which is
[4149.12 - 4152.24] trace mineral salts
[4152.56 - 4156.72] smells so good right here you've got the
[4154.08 - 4158.16] garlic in here got the basil
[4156.72 - 4160.24] you don't need a lot of basil i mean
[4158.16 - 4162.48] basil's anti-pathogen which is
[4160.24 - 4165.60] incredible but
[4162.48 - 4166.48] it's so good and i'm gonna put this on
[4165.60 - 4169.28] top
[4166.48 - 4169.28] of the noodles
[4170.72 - 4173.36] but you know what you guys you're gonna
[4171.92 - 4175.28] get a lot of misinformation out there
[4173.36 - 4176.72] and it's painstaking because yeah you
[4175.28 - 4178.24] might be somebody that it really doesn't
[4176.72 - 4179.84] affect right now but
[4178.24 - 4181.68] you can take that misinformation and be
[4179.84 - 4183.20] like your brain needs fat let me just go
[4181.68 - 4184.88] with that because every single podcast
[4183.20 - 4185.92] doctor's saying your brain needs fat
[4184.88 - 4187.68] because everybody's saying your brain
[4185.92 - 4191.28] needs fat they don't they don't they're
[4187.68 - 4192.96] wrong i mean it's not how it works
[4191.28 - 4194.72] your brain actually runs on sugar it's
[4192.96 - 4196.00] made out of glycogen and it needs sugar
[4194.72 - 4197.76] you can't make a thought together put a
[4196.00 - 4199.36] thought together
[4197.76 - 4200.88] glucose is part of how your electrical
[4199.36 - 4202.64] activity even works how
[4200.88 - 4204.24] electrical activity in the brain all
[4202.64 - 4207.68] that neurotransmitters even work it's
[4204.24 - 4207.68] all it's all glucose based
[4211.92 - 4218.00] that onion was so strong that onion was
[4214.84 - 4218.00] strong um
[4218.88 - 4224.48] grabbing a fork here so i'm just going
[4221.36 - 4224.48] to mix this up a little bit
[4226.24 - 4231.44] so i got the cucumber noodles i got the
[4228.96 - 4234.80] tomato bruschetta on top here
[4231.44 - 4235.12] okay that's what i have now yeah i mean
[4234.80 - 4236.88] look
[4235.12 - 4238.40] if you if you're into fat and that's all
[4236.88 - 4239.76] you want to eat or something like that i
[4238.40 - 4241.12] still want you to make these healthy
[4239.76 - 4242.56] meals if you needed to put a little
[4241.12 - 4244.08] avocado on it because you're not going
[4242.56 - 4245.60] to have it any other way
[4244.08 - 4247.44] at least i know you got something really
[4245.60 - 4249.28] healthy in in you with that
[4247.44 - 4250.72] but i would try to keep a fat free meal
[4249.28 - 4255.44] once in a while in your life maybe
[4250.72 - 4257.28] in a day or something when you're sick
[4255.44 - 4258.88] you'll feel how fat doesn't help you
[4257.28 - 4261.20] when you're really sick
[4258.88 - 4262.00] that's when the line is is crossed or
[4261.20 - 4264.88] that's when you
[4262.00 - 4266.00] figure it out it's like it's like why do
[4264.88 - 4266.64] you think everybody's intermittent
[4266.00 - 4267.84] fasting
[4266.64 - 4270.32] they're intermittent fasting because
[4267.84 - 4271.92] they they didn't know it
[4270.32 - 4273.52] no one knows it not even so-called
[4271.92 - 4275.76] intermittent fasting experts whatever
[4273.52 - 4278.16] you call that or whoever
[4275.76 - 4279.68] it they didn't know that you're taking
[4278.16 - 4281.20] fats out of your diet in the morning
[4279.68 - 4282.72] that's why but they don't say that
[4281.20 - 4284.40] because they think fats mean everything
[4282.72 - 4286.24] it's like you need fats
[4284.40 - 4287.44] but they but when you take your fats out
[4286.24 - 4289.04] in the morning
[4287.44 - 4290.80] you just gave your liver a break you
[4289.04 - 4292.56] just gave your blood system a break you
[4290.80 - 4294.56] just gave everything a break
[4292.56 - 4296.00] because the fats in the morning that
[4294.56 - 4298.72] actually they kill you
[4296.00 - 4300.16] faster and age you faster and and stop
[4298.72 - 4301.44] your brain from working what do you
[4300.16 - 4302.32] think of res intermittent fasting
[4301.44 - 4303.36] they're trying to get their brain
[4302.32 - 4304.32] working for
[4303.36 - 4305.60] for once in their life and they're
[4304.32 - 4306.80] trying to get and then they're jacked up
[4305.60 - 4308.40] on caffeine to be
[4306.80 - 4311.20] high on adrenaline to get their brain
[4308.40 - 4312.32] working it's you know and
[4311.20 - 4313.68] so what you do in the morning is you
[4312.32 - 4315.20] keep your fats out and you do natural
[4313.68 - 4316.64] glucose you do your lemon water in the
[4315.20 - 4318.32] morning right
[4316.64 - 4320.56] you do that you do lemon water in the
[4318.32 - 4321.44] morning that's what you do you do the
[4320.56 - 4322.72] celery juice
[4321.44 - 4324.40] you do the fruit smoothie you do the
[4322.72 - 4325.92] heavy metal detox movie medical meme
[4324.40 - 4327.20] heavy duty
[4325.92 - 4329.04] medical medium heavy metal detox
[4327.20 - 4330.32] smoothie and you stay away from these
[4329.04 - 4331.84] fats in the morning
[4330.32 - 4334.40] i mean if you want to have bacons and
[4331.84 - 4336.56] bacon and eggs and toast in the morning
[4334.40 - 4338.24] and butter on everything i mean that's
[4336.56 - 4340.32] that's what takes you down
[4338.24 - 4341.84] fast the bad road because you're killing
[4340.32 - 4343.28] your liver and over time everything just
[4341.84 - 4345.04] falls apart and this stuff
[4343.28 - 4346.64] sits in the heart then there's no
[4345.04 - 4348.32] glucose getting there's no natural
