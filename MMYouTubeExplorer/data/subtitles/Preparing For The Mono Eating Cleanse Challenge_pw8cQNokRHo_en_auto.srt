so you guys can do a couple of different

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,400
options in here there's

86
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,160
and i'm going to give you just the

87
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,879
rundown right here right off the running

88
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,840
okay

89
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,319
you can do a banana mono eating cleanse

90
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,040
with

91
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,800
optional lettuce because lettuce should

92
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,400
be in there and banana and i'll talk

93
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,840
about what else we can do

94
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,200
papaya is a moderating cleanse too if

95
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,720
you can get a hold of papayas then you

96
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,840
could just do papaya

97
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:04,400
banana and papaya is optional

98
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,599
so both so if you want to do banana and

99
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,200
papaya

100
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,720
and then you have your lettuce that's

101
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,239
the other option there

102
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:15,440
steamed potatoes is an option

103
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:18,000
with lettuce okay steamed

104
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,360
peas is another option so steamed peas a

105
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,879
lot of people they can't get a hold of

106
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,560
potatoes or they can't get a hold of

107
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,480
papaya they can't get all the banana

108
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,040
then you got the steamed peas

109
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,239
right then there's an option where you

110
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,480
do steamed

111
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,560
winter squash you guys see the butternut

112
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,120
squash right here

113
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,920
but you can do the steamed winter squash

114
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,080
and then

115
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,760
pick some green beans or some brussels

116
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,760
sprouts or some asparagus

117
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,040
for the end of the day as well and have

118
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,120
that with your lettuce so

119
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,400
that's another option there too so you

120
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,920
have all these now there's people that

121
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,519
are saying well hey can i do watermelon

122
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,599
yeah you can do watermelon

123
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,519
but the whole thing with watermelon is

124
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,799
you better be doing your celery juice

125
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,640
you can't just say hey

126
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,920
i'm gonna do watermelon for the next

127
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,920
three days

128
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,840
and not do your celery juice you need

129
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,519
those mineral salts or you're gonna just

130
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,760
you're gonna hit that place where

131
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,680
boom you're basically just doing a juice

132
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,319
fast that's all that is

133
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,000
because watermelon doesn't have enough

134
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,400
calories

135
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,560
to sustain without all of a sudden

136
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,160
making it where you want to break or

137
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,160
you've got to have the celery juice in

138
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,160
there if you go that route

139
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,360
and so and if you're doing the

140
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,440
watermelon

141
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,479
version right that's the one you pick

142
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,320
because some people are like i love

143
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,040
watermelon it's watermelon season where

144
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,720
i am

145
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,400
let me do that you've got to be doing

146
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,400
your celery juice

147
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,000
you should be bringing in some lettuce

148
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,080
okay so

149
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,520
if you don't mind some lettuce in there

150
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,680
bring in some lettuce

151
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,440
okay and you don't want to do it term

152
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,199
the mono eating cleanse

153
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,720
has been designed from spirit of

154
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,919
compassion to do long

155
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,880
term if you would like long term if you

156
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,880
want

157
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:58,080
and that long term is to heal things

158
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:01,360

a lot of people use the mono-eating

257
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,000
cleanse to save their butt

258
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:43,919
to heal and recover they're kind of

259
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,760
sensitive so they're not doing much of

260
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,640
anything else so they just keep it the

261
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,959
monolith

262
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,200

for a few days

267
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,800

268
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,279
the mud if you don't really don't want

269
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,519

271
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,040

going to do

290
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,279
but depending on the person what's going

291
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,800
on you know you may get different

292
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,880
results that's why the monoleading

294
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,279
certain gut

00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,720
problems but yes you could do the heavy

296
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,600
metal detox smoothie question

297
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,519
answered yes yes yes another question

298
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,200
was the watermelon answer that one yes

299
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,040
you can do that that's going to be a nut

300
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,200
you're doing a medical medium tool

301
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,320
and a medical medium tool you know and

302
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,920
that's what you're doing

303
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,040
you're doing the celery juice you got to

304
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,079
do the celery juice you're going to play

305
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,320
with watermelon

306
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,680
for those few days you got to do the

307
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,560
celery just while you're playing with

308
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,279
watermelon

309
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,680
and you might want to think about still

310
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,680
having some butter leaf lettuce

311
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,680
instead of just doing all watermelon all

312
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,920
watermelon all watermelon

313
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,680
okay you've got to have enough of the

314
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,560
mineral salts

315
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:31,040
with that watermelon keep that in mind

316
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,160
you have to have the mineral salts with

317
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,040
that watermelon if you're going to go

318
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,000
that route

319
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:38,240
okay so the bananas look a little

320
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,120
browner than normal right but

321
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,680
they're not that right they're ripe

322
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,839
enough

323
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,959
just right what happened is i wash my

324
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,920
bananas

325
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:49,360
they just come from the store i'll just

326
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,240
oh i'll just wash them

327
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,640
is what i do so when you wash bananas

328
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,000
the skins on the outsides do this

329
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,839
so that's what happens when you wash

330
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,480
them i know people they buy them in the

331
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,600
store

332
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,600
they grab them they crack one open and

333
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,839
eat one with their hands

334
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,200
and what they don't realize that a whole

335
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,640
bunch of people are going through these

336
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,000

338
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,920
that back i don't know if i want that

339
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,760
bunch

340
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,120
they're grabbing the carriage there's

341
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,920
all kinds of strep and

342
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,240
e coli on their hands and all kinds of

343
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,600
herpes simplex one on their hands

344
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,680
you know for playing with their cold

345
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,480
sores or something and there's all kinds

346
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,000
of different stuff

347
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,000
on their hands all over the place

348
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,760
there's feces on shopping carts

349
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,279
there's always feces on the handles of

350
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,279
shopping carts just you know there's

351
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:36,160
there's always feces on that

352
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,200
so when i so so what if i get bananas

353
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,000
from the store

354
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,800
right and it's not in a case because i

355
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,519
like to get a case of bananas this time

356
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,920
i didn't get a case of bananas so i got

357
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,200
like

358
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,639
single bunches so i just gave it a wash

359
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,839
that's all so i'm using it because i

360
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,399
don't want to put this on my cutting

361
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,320
board

362
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,399
just right it comes out of the store you

363
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,160
put it right on your cutting board

364
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,920
i don't want to do that it's not a smart

365
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,680
move that's why it's why people just

366
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,120
they're like hey i'm doing your stuff

367
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,920
and all of a sudden i'll feel good with

368
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,519
something i remember over the years but

369
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,120
spirit of compassion would be spirit of

370
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,600
compassion be like yeah because they

371
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,040

that right

426
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,560
there's a question that comes up all the

427
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,920
time in sweet potatoes can i use sweet

428
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,720
potatoes for the money and cleanse

429
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,920
yeah you can you can but there's a

430
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,560
reason why

431
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,000
when you open the book and you read in

432
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,680
here

433
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,160
there's a reason why life-saving

434
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,800
information is set up in this book like

435
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,959
it is

436
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,880
and how it heals people the reason why

437
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,600
it's not there's all this this stuff

438
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,760
isn't like

439
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,720
it doesn't say in here mono eating

440
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,360
options

441
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,720
okay make sure you use sweet potato for

442
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,800
a mono eating option

443
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,959
doesn't say that doesn't say make sure

444
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,399
you eat sweet potato it doesn't say that

445
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:29,760
because i'll tell you why

446
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:32,560
sweet potatoes are a little bit more

447
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,600
or a lot more fibrous they have strings

448
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,760
in them

449
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,199
so sweet potatoes have strings in them

450
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,000
so here's the thing

451
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:41,519
say you're somebody with crohn's colitis

452
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,079
say you're somebody that's got a lot of

453
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,160
gastric

454
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:46,000
problems where you can't even eat

455
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,199
anything like you can't even eat

456
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,880
anything i have to look out for

457
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,480
everybody right look at a lookout for

458
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:53,920
people who are in that condition

459
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:56,240
right and their gut their guts inflamed

460
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,839
they got pockets and narrowing in here

461
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,959
so they got narrowing problems inside

462
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,839
their gut they got

463
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:03,920
pockets inside their gut right sweet

464
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,920
potatoes are fine to eat

465
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,680
but if you're going to eat large amounts

466
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,600
of them or more of them and just eat

467
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,279
them every day mono eating

468
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,360
they have a lot of strings they have

469
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,959
fibrous strings in there you ever see

470
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,880
those before in the sweet potatoes

471
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,000
when you cut a sweet potato there's

472
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,600
there's it's like

473
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,440
it's like there's arteries in them you

474
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,279
can't see them a lot of them are small

475
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,720
you can't see those passageways in the

476
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,959
sweet potato

477
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,839
well those you know they're they get

478

bulky

479
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,519
they get bulky inside the tummy so

480
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,800
you've got somebody that can barely eat

481
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,600

482
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,199

562
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:22,000
the peels uh it's not a great

563
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,919
thing to do there's a tannin in the

564
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,760
banana peel

565
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:28,080
so there's a certain tannin in there and

566
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,320
you don't want to eat the banana peels

567
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,200
they don't do a whole lot for us and

568
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,760
it's something that's

569
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,919
irritating on the lining really

570
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:39,840
irritating on the lining

571
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:41,760
and so the whole point is

572
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,360
you love the robot well you know the

573
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,840
thing is everybody becomes a protein

574
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,440
robot

575
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,880
it's like where do you get your protein

576
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,240
that's what people are going to be like

577
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,280
they're like where's your protein though

578
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,919
so they're like where do you get your

579
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,200
protein

580
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,720
where's your protein where's your

581
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,280
protein where do you get your protein

582
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,880
protein

583
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,120
everybody's like the protein robots is

584
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,160
what they are and uh that's the mini

585
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,280
robot

586
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,080
the point is is that everybody's going

587
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,240
to be like well

588
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,360
where's mono eating cleanse where's my

589
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,559
protein that's one thing we're going to

590
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,080
talk about we'll talk about something

591
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:13,679
else as well

592
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:17,200
yeah the whole the whole thing is

593
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:19,440
about healing some important

594
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,600
organs in everybody so let's go into

595
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,919
that for a couple of seconds all right

596
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,240
let's do that i'm also going to run some

597
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:28,240
celery juice i need some for today

598
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,400
myself let me push this forward a little

599
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,400
bit

600
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,600
my buddy here all right

601
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:41,760
so here's what happens

602
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,799
your liver gets dirty it gets stagnant

603
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,679
it gets

604
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:47,760
abused by the industries not by you by

605
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:49,360
the industries we get taught to just

606
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,799
destroy your liver that's what we get

607
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:54,320
taught to do

608
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:55,360
we get taught to eat so much protein and

609
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,240
fat

610
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:00,320
that we just kill our livers that's what

611
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:03,039
we get taught isn't that great

612
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,320
we're taught that that that's just what

613
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:06,240
what happens

614
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,600
and so the liver gets stagnant sluggish

615
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,039
it starts to break down

616
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,600
and then it can't produce the bile it

617
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:15,679
needs to produce so the bile reserves

618
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:18,640
drop gallbladders get all skanky and bad

619
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,880
and problematic they get all they get

620
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,400
all

621
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:26,159
toxic the gallbladder gets all toxic

622
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:30,000
all filled up with junk right and so

623
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:33,360
we start to get like minor versions of

624
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:37,679
organ failure as the years go on yeah

625
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:39,679
you can have organ failure for 50 years

626
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,840
you can have organ failure so when

627
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,679
someone's heart is failing

628
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,280
they try to keep you alive as long as

629
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:48,559
possible they try to keep your heart

630
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:50,320
working as long as possible right and

631
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,720
and you can have you can have heart

632
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,799
failure for years

633
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,159
but what people don't realize is organ

634
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,960
failure is something that just

635
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,840
lasts for decades and so many people

636
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,000
it's a liver

637
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,200
failure that's the organ that that goes

638
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,600
into this place

639
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,320
gallbladder failure for years you just

640
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,640
it's it's

641
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,960
what's happening is your liver is

642
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,240
failing to produce the amount of bile it

643
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,360
needs to break down

644
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:18,640
fats your stomach

645
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,520
is failing to produce the gastric acid

646
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,679
the hcl

647
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,679
to break down your proteins and then we

648
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,840
just fat ourselves to death

649
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,520
fat ourselves to death protein ourselves

650
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,600
to death that's what we do

651
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,360
that's what we do we fat ourselves to

652
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,799
death and we protein ourselves to death

653
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,320
hopefully this doesn't fall off right

654
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:36,720
now

655
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,880
so we end up eating all the fat we have

656
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,360
our fat we fry our eggs in butter

657
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,919
we do our scrambled eggs and oil

658
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,039
whatever

659
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,559
i know that many of you guys are like

660
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,280
why use coconut oil for my eggs you're

661
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,000
not

662
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,919
you're not full in your body man it's

663
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,280
all the same when it comes down to fat

664
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,320
even though it's a better fat than

665
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,720
butter

666
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,559
and so we just keep on we just fat

667
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,840
ourselves for years and years and years

668
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:00,320
and that's what happens

669
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,440
you know we have the bagels how many

670
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,200
guys do bagels

671
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,600
like how many guys do the bagels cream

672
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,640
cheese the bagels and different things

673
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:10,880
right

674
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:12,559
and we do that and overall over time

675
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,240
we get ourselves in trouble i mean how

676
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,520
many burgers have you guys had over the

677
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,960
years right

678
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:20,559
okay so we break down our gut we break

679
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,559
down our gastric system

680
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:24,000
we break everything down how many of you

681
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,360
guys got this in the house right now you

682
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,159
know what i love about the mono eating

683
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,799
cleanse

684
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,159
it's not going to be mono eating eggs

685
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,640
every now and then somebody like

686
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:34,640
well i only eat cheese i only eat eggs

687
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,159
and i only eat meat so i'm model eating

688
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,960
cheese eggs and meat and i'm like oh my

689
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,240
god

690
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,240
what you're doing is you're killing your

691
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,919
liver you're killing your

692
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,360
stomach glands you're killing your

693
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,840
pancreas

694
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,640
you're just you're feeding all the bugs

695
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,760
so

696
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:52,640
the point is is that we got some

697
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,400
things to repair over time and i'm not

698
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,640
going into all the details

699
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,919
man i'm not going into all the details

700
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,720
you guys

701
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,600
i'm not like the amount of stuff we do

702
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,039
and take

703
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:06,799
that just rips us down inside right

704
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:09,440
so the moderating cleanse is a chance to

705
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:12,559
recover a chance to come back

706
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:14,640
even if you don't know you're down in

707
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:16,640
that place where you're hurting

708
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,000
because you can't sense it yet or feel

709
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,679
it yet you don't know your liver

710
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,880
stagnant sluggish yet you don't know

711
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,080
you're hurting you don't know you got

712
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,200
problems yet

713
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:27,360
right you don't know and so let's talk

714
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,600
about what the mono eating cleanse does

715
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,559
one of the things is okay it provides

716
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,880
protein

717
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:37,520
yes bio available protein

718
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,880
that's what it provides so keep that off

719
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,480
your worry list

720
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,000
because people will have that as a worry

721
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,840
right provides

722
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:48,000
omegas yes it does it provides

723
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,080
phytochemical compounds antioxidants

724
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,600
antiviral compounds anti-bacterial

725
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,720
compounds glucose

726
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:57,679
mineral salts and that's just

727
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,640
some of the things it provides important

728
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,400
to know

729
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,320
so i want to tell you guys something and

730
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,120
we get turned into this like protein

731
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,880
robot

732
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:10,000
and we do and here's the funny thing

733
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:12,480
protein doesn't kill viruses

734
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,760
it doesn't kill bacteria and everybody's

735
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,240
sick because of pro

736
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:18,000
because of bacteria and viruses right

737
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,880
protein doesn't take out toxic heavy

738
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
metals so we can do all protein protein

739
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,400
shakes protein everything

740
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,320
it doesn't take out toxic heavy metals

741
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,080
it doesn't kill bugs

742
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,840
protein doesn't get rid of yeast and

743
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:34,360
mold and unproductive dangerous

744
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:36,960
fungus protein doesn't get rid of

745
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:40,240
petrochemicals and plastics

746
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:43,279
it doesn't get rid of radiation

747
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,960
it doesn't do any of this stuff so

748
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:48,240
interesting right

749
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:50,960
so we got to do other things to get your

750
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,159
organs repaired and get the bad stuff

751
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,880
out

752
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,960
everybody's eating everybody's eating a

753
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,679
ton of protein

754
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,559
everybody's eating a ton of protein and

755
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,640
they're sick

756
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:04,880
and they stay sick and they stay sick or

757
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,480
they wave back and forth from being sick

758
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,240
to a little better being sick to a

759
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,000
little bit better

760
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,000
and they but they get in trouble either

761
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,840
way keep that in mind

762
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,679
so ask what your protein is doing for

763
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,279
you because apparently

764
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,880
medical research and science doesn't

765
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:20,159
know what protein does for us

766
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,840
they don't know because they don't know

767
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,600
why we're sick but they tell you to keep

768
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,559
on taking the protein right

769
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,679
i'm talking about plant-based vegetarian

770
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:30,080
i don't care what

771
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,679
side of the aisle you're on okay animal

772
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,520
protein diets keto

773
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,120
paleo whatever you choose or do whatever

774
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,640
fancy name comes around the corner for

775
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,240
diets

776
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,840
protein doesn't get rid of the toxic

777
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,600
heavy metals protein doesn't get rid of

778
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,039
pesticides or besides fungicides protein

779
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,760
doesn't get rid of petrochemicals in the

780
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:45,120
solvents

781
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,360

00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,919
candle chemicals and the air freshener

783
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,840
chemicals

784
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:51,760
protein doesn't get rid of the bugs the

785

viruses the bacteria the mold the yeast

786
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,039
the fungus

787
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,000
protein doesn't do any of that so you

788
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,320
eat your protein all

789
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,840

root canals you'll still get that you'll

796
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,600
still get your gallbladders removed just

797
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,320
to get your appendix removed you'll

798
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,919

00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,080
it can be done long term it could be

809
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,799
done a year

810
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,360
it could be done two years it can be

814
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:06,640
long term short term we're doing a three

815
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,880
day mono cleanse challenge i'm pumped up

816
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,760
i'm excited

817
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,600
intestinal tracts get inflamed with bugs

818
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:16,159
that's what they get inflamed with

819
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:18,000
so our guts get inflamed with bugs

820
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:21,600
that's that's what happens okay

821
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,600
and um they lose all the body parts they

822
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:26,960
just fall apart there on the ground

823
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:28,640
so what happens is that everybody's got

824
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,640
little buggies inside their gut

825
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,200
they got inside their colon they got

826
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:35,200
inside their small intestinal tract

827
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,440
and you can take all the probiotics you

828
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,120
want you can take all the microflora

829
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,120
products you want you can do all the

830
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,039
microorganism products

831
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,240
you can do the fecal matter implant

832
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:47,360
which is insane

833
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:49,440
which is absolutely insanity you can do

834
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,520
anything you want with your gut

835
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,039
do your coffee enemas if you want to

836
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,279
which is insane

837
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,799
just terrible you can do all these

838
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:59,520
different things

839
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:01,679
you can add all the fermented foods you

840
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,240
want with all the fermented

841
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,440
the fermented probiotics and all you

842
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,440
want there

843
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,440
and all that's going to do is nothing

844
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,520
because your bad bugs

845
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,600
don't battle the good bugs your good

846
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,440
bugs don't battle the bad bugs

847
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,880
to put all the good stuff you want

848
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,159
you're still going to be inflamed

849
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,399
you're still going to have problems you

850
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:22,640

00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,799
book

969
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:43,840

973
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:56,960
you need the mineral salts you need the

974
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:58,799
trace minerals

975
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,720

feeling a little better

979
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:07,440
for five seconds but it's a matter of

980
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,240
time

981
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:12,320
before you just run out of everything

982
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:15,519
your body needs

983
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:17,760

00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,279
from doing that

988
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,519

989
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:29,679
have the mineral salts

990
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:31,679
when someone adds celery juice to

991
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:33,840
whatever mistakes they're making

992
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:35,519

sameel says can i do supplements

1052
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:05,839
now here's the thing that's a really

1053
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,880
good question too can i do supplements

1054
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:09,119
right

1055
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:11,280
well what supplements are we talking

1056
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:13,359
about we talk about charcoal

1057
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,119
probably like some bad probiotic blend

1058
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:16,960
are we talking about

1059
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:19,119
a protein powder are we talking about

1060
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,240
some big multivitamin powder it's got

1061
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:22,400
garbage and junk in it

1062
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:24,400
msg are you talking about stuff with

1063
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,079
citric acid in it are you talking about

1064
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,560
whey protein powder are you talking

1065
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:28,960
about

1066
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,599
bentonite clay are you talking about

1067
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,240
zeolite

1068
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:33,200
are you talking about chlorella what are

1069
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,680
you talking about

1070
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,800
because all these things are irritants

1071
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,960
and problems

1072
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,800
to the intestinal tract they're all

1073
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,599
irritants and problems the intestinal

1074
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,040
tract

1075
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:46,400
so you know when someone's like yeah can

1076
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,920
i still do my supplements

1077
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,839
well you could be doing stuff that's

1078
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,359
really irritating really problematic but

1079
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:53,359
i'm not telling you not to do them

1080
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:54,800
you do what your doctor wants you to do

1081
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:57,040
i'm just telling that that's what i

1082
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,720
would be asking myself right there okay

1083
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,320
and i cover this in the medical medium

1084
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,720
cleanse the heel book so

1085
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:04,400
it's like there's a difference between

1086
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,240
doing supplements

1087
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,520
and there's a difference between doing

1088
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,359
irritants and

1089
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,040
and supplements that actually cause

1090
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:12,720
problems that don't do anything for you

1091
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,960
and you don't realize it

1092
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,400
it's all of that so here's what can

1093
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,000
happen you're doing the medical media

1094
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,960
monocles and that's actually bringing

1095
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,240
your liver back

1096
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,640
and you're taking all these garbage

1097
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:24,560
supplements you know and

1098
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,240
just that could happen too i'm not

1099
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,720
saying you're doing that i'm just saying

1100
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:34,640
people do that

1101
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:35,920

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,440
it's the only juicer that does that i

1120
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:22,720
love it

1121
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,160
it's going to strain this you got to

1122
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,720
strain your celery juice the reason why

1123
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:29,920
i'm actually juicing celery right now

1124
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:31,920
is not just because i want some myself

1125
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,359
but because i want to remind you guys

1126
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:36,320
you have to strain

1127
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:36,320
your celery juice

1128
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:40,400
you have to celery juice shouldn't have

1129
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:42,800
any fiber or pulp in it

1130
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,240
or it's not going to work to its maximum

1131
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,599
level

1132
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,359
and if you're going to be doing the mono

1133
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,920
eating cleanse cause i'm gonna be doing

1134
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:51,200
that

1135
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,880
then you want that maximum right

1136
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,880
if you can't do lemon water and you

1137
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,880
can't do lemon or you don't have a lemon

1138
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,800
do water in the morning first thing

1139
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,480
okay it's it read about it in the

1140
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,440
substitute section in the cleansing heal

1141
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,119
book

1142
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,480
you can do that to read about it in the

1143
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:06,720
cleanse of heal

1144
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:09,680
so we'll run over some stuff janet says

1145
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:12,320
do you need to eat the same thing

1146
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,839
all three days or can you do papaya one

1147
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,560
day squash the next day okay good

1148
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:17,680
question

1149
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:20,000
look if you do papaya one day

1150
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:21,520
banana the next you do papaya one day

1151
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,640
steamed potatoes the next if you do

1152
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,839
papaya one day

1153
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,000
whatever and you're doing you know

1154
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:27,280
winter squash next don't want to lose

1155
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,880
that one

1156
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:32,880
if you do that you're you're you're

1157
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,560
basically customizing medical medium

1158
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,160
tools that's what you're doing

1159
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:39,200
so you're customizing medical medium

1160
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:41,839
tools it's not meant to be like that

1161
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:43,520
yeah you can do it but you're but you're

1162
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:45,599
customizing you're kind of

1163
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:47,760
you're you're changing up medical medium

1164
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:51,200
tools right that's what you're doing

1165
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:53,760
so there's no law against it right

1166
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,960
you can do banana one day you can do

1167
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,520
papaya the next

1168
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,280
steamed potatoes the next so you mono

1169
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,599
eat one thing one day you might wait one

1170
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,520
thing

1171
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:02,960
no another day you model it because you

1172
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,480
basically do what you did basically

1173
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,920
you're doing mono eating for one day

1174
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,760
model eating for another day just

1175
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,920
changing it up right that's what your

1176
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,520
heart desires that's what you want to do

1177
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,280
something you can do

1178
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,280
is it meant to be like that it's not

1179
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,800
meant to be like that but if you find

1180
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,440
but at the same time and i talk about

1181
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:22,160
this in cleansing heal just so you know

1182
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:24,319
if there's something that you're not

1183
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,599
jiving with something you're feeling

1184
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:29,119
like you're not

1185
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:30,480
gelling with right and if you're not

1186
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:31,839
jelly you don't want to do the steamed

1187
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,880
potato one and that's what you're doing

1188
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:35,680
for a day or two

1189
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:38,400
you can switch it up 100 you can and

1190
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:42,000
then start doing papaya but the goal

1191
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,640
is to be on one of them eventually for a

1192
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,400
while

1193
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,680
that's the goal you know you want to be

1194
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,160
on one of them that that

1195
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,880
feels good to you so if steam peas feel

1196
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,119
good to you

1197
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,800
every day so you do your lemon water you

1198
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:54,800
do your celery juice

1199
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,240
you do your steamed peas you do your

1200
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,720
lettuce and steamed peas

1201
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,599
you do it twice during the day right

1202
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,599
then do some

1203
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:02,640
then do some more water throughout the

1204
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:04,640
day

1205
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:06,640
and your day is done and you did one day

1206
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,160
of a mono-eating cleanse

1207
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,920
try to do the steamed peas again the

1208
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:12,560
next day if it's gelling

1209
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,760
if it feels good if it's you feel you're

1210
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:17,119
happy about it right

1211
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:19,680
do it the next day you could

1212
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:20,720
recommend a juicer yeah melanie the

1213
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:25,119
juicer is

1214
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:28,960
this one right here okay it's the omega

1215
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:32,000
mm-900 hds but just just so you know

1216
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:34,000
it's the mm-900 hds

1217
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,839
so it's not any other omega juicer this

1218
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,280
is the one that's the celery juicer but

1219
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:39,280
it does other things too

1220
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:41,760
it's a celery juicer where the pulp just

1221
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:45,359
comes out bone dry

1222
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:48,400
right apollo says so stay with

1223
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:48,880
one for three days that's what i'm gonna

1224
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,800
do

1225
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,319
i'm gonna stay with one for three days

1226
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,800
that's what i'm gonna do

1227
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:56,400
yeah so anyway that's the juice right

1228
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,720
there mm-900 hgs

1229
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,960
there's a sale coming up on that juicer

1230
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:02,319
in like a few days or something i'm not

1231
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,599
sure what day it is but there's a sale

1232
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:05,839
coming up where it's 20

1233
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:07,520
off so if you wait till then that's a

1234
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:10,480
good idea

1235
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:11,200
but reading the book is important as i

1236
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,680
said

1237
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:15,520
multiple times already that it's really

1238
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,880
that important to understand what's

1239
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:20,160
happening in the book like

1240
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:21,839
because if you do change it up you know

1241
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,839
if you do change it up it talks about

1242
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:25,440
what you know what how it works

1243
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:27,119
read the book for details that answers

1244
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,240
hundreds of questions with the minor

1245
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:30,240

here because all you're going to feel is

1341
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,800

1351
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:24,800

all going to get worse over time from

1356
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:36,800
eating eggs

1357
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:40,000
the mono eating cleanse

1358
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:40,000
and cleanse the heal

1359
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:46,400
right the mono-eating cleanse and

1360

cleanse the heel

1361
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:50,319
is gentle enough

1362
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:55,200
but also starves the very bugs that are

1363
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,079
inside your gut that are keeping you

1364
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:59,040

so that you can heal over time that's

1366
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:02,079
what it's about adele says no eggs ever

1367
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,440
again

1368
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:04,560
when it comes down to watermelon if you

1369
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,319
guys want to do if you're going to

1370
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,280
choose watermelon to mono eat

1371
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:09,359
i'm just going to give you a couple of

1372
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:11,119
tips you better be doing celery juice

1373
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:12,880
or you're going to hit the wall you're

1374
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:15,040
going to hit the watermelon wall

1375
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:17,119
because there's not enough calories or

1376
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:18,400
mineral salts in watermelon

1377
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:20,000
because basically if you're just doing

1378
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,760
watermelon by itself and watermelon's

1379
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,200
great i mean i've done long-term

1380
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,720
stents of eating watermelon but i've

1381
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:27,040
known how to balance it where you've got

1382
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:30,319
to have some lettuce

1383
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:33,040
you got to have some celery juice

1384
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:34,640
okay the reason why watermelon's not

1385
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,800
this 100 like

1386
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:38,880
perfect option in the cleansing heel

1387
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:41,119
book in the monocline section

1388
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,079
is because there's not enough calories

1389
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:43,359
in the watermelon

1390
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:45,119
and you end up doing kind of like a

1391
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:46,240
watermelon juice fast right that's what

1392
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:49,760
you're doing

1393
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:50,559
but doing you can't do a watermelon

1394
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:54,400
juice fast

1395
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:56,000
long term so how are you going to then

1396
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,440
heal your guts if you need to do the

1397
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,280
monoclines long term

1398
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,880
so the mono cleanse is designed where

1399
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,800
you can actually do it long term

1400
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:04,400
to get to the finish line and get rid of

1401
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,680
your problems and start healing things

1402
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,400
that are deep within that's the whole

1403
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,160
point

1404
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,440
but absolutely you can do a three-day

1405
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:11,119
watermelon version

1406
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:13,280
you're using a medical medium tool right

1407
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:13,680
the watermelon juice the medical medium

1408
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:17,040
tool

1409
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:19,520
that's fine you're using that and

1410
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:21,200
you're customizing for yourself to do

1411
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,480
some to do some mono eating cleanse

1412
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,000
right it's fine

1413
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,520
but make sure you got some butter leaf

1414
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,720

1596
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:59,200
papaya

1597
00:54:55,599 --> 00:55:01,599
a day said i would do for sure cut the

1598
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:03,520
papaya in half this is a large papaya if

1599
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:05,920
you got small papayas do more of them

1600
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:07,839
right i i mean me i would do a papaya

1601
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,920

1602
00:55:07,839 --> 00:55:11,520
in a day doing my celery juice well

1603
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:12,400
lemon water papaya and a half that's

1604
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:16,000
what i would do

1605
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:18,079
right if you're just doing papaya okay

1606
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:21,280
you may not want to do that much papaya

1607
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:23,280
if you're doing bananas

1608
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:24,559
because if you can choose the papaya and

1609
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,880
banana version

1610
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:28,000
and cleanse the heal so you can choose

1611
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:29,599
that one you guys

00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,160
the papaya and banana version and

1613
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:35,200
cleanse the heel so keep that in mind

1614
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:36,640
right so you can do like you can do a

1615
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:38,799

00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:40,799
during lunch a couple bananas later if

1617
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:41,280

1618
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:43,280

1623
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:51,520
option of doing cucumber juice in the

afternoon too you can do cucumber juice

1625
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:54,960

00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:56,240
mono cleanse

that's my that the one i want steamed

1632
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:07,200
peas is another one read the chapter

1633
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:08,720
chapter several times it's pretty easy

1634
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,160
to do just read the chapter several

1635
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:13,200
times

1636
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:17,040
the steam p version is amazing too

1637
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:20,319
okay you guys so you got that

1638
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:24,640
as an option so i am totally

1639
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:28,000
totally totally down totally psyched

1640
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:31,680
totally pumped big time

1641
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,240
because so uh teresa says add lime with

1642
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:37,200
papaya

1643
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:39,680
yes you can you can boiled potatoes okay

1644
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:41,280
that's a really good question steamed

1645
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:43,440
potatoes

1646
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:45,359
boiling them does something different

1647
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:48,240
really important to know okay

1648
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:51,119
when you boil potatoes you boil a lot of

1649
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:54,640
the carbohydrate out of the potato

1650
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:57,359
so if you boil a potato okay

1651
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:58,720
you lose a lot of the glucose that

1652
00:56:57,359 --> 00:57:00,640
you're going to need

1653
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:03,920
when you boil potatoes you might need to

1654
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:05,920
eat more potatoes because you boil them

1655
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:07,040
they end up because the glucose gets

1656
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:09,040
boiled not

1657
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:10,799
all of it but the glucose gets boiled

1658
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:13,760
out of the potato

1659
00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:15,839
and then those natural sugars end up in

1660
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:18,000
your broth they end up in your

1661
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:20,240
like the liquid you're dumping out

1662
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:22,079
that's such an important question

1663
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:24,559
can you blend both pie and banana yeah

1664
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:25,599
