108
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,680
here a little bit

109
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,440
glad you guys are here might even talk

110
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,680
about eggs a little bit

111
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,280
because can't get enough of it there's a

112
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,959
lot of confusion people say well if you

113
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,560
cook the egg

114
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,080
if you cook the egg then you don't have

115
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,959
to worry you can eat all the eggs you

116
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,319
want

117
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:45,440
no that's not how it works cooked raw

118
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,640
the bacteria the viruses they're not in

119
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,720
the egg

120
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,000
they're not in this egg no they're not

121
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,120
in the eggs

122
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,959
they're not see they raise pathogens in

123
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,120
the egg they take the top off the egg

124
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,959
like in the video on tick-tock they take

125
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,080
the top off the egg

126
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:04,159
and they and they they place

127
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,120
the pathogen inside the egg they grow it

128
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,640
and so forth that's what they've been

129
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,840
doing for 100 years right

130
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:12,480
but when you eat the egg you feed your

131
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,319
epstein bar you feed people are like

132
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,680
reactivated epstein-barr my doctor's

133
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,199
looking for reactivated epstein-barr

134
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,479
yeah medical medium information that's

135
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,120
the only reason why they're looking for

136
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,720
it right

137
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:25,840
but what they don't know details matter

138
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,199
details matter when you eat the egg you

139
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,520

nobody wants to be sick

239
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,240
do you want to be sick do you guys want

240
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,000

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,879
sick or do you want to be sick you want

243
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,440
to be sick because that's what they

244
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,919
think

245
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,120
they think we want to be sick do you

246
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,240
want to be sick

247
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:22,080
let's make it crystal clear nobody

248
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:25,199
wants to be sick or compromised nobody

249
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,479
has a fear of healing

250
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,199
do you have a fear of healing do you

251
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:31,440

into it a little deeper

256
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,279

257
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,800
for 20 30 years

258
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,120

260
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,240

349
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,959
bodies are

350
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,600
doing yeah it's great it gives the

351
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:52,720
doctor who doesn't know why you're sick

352
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,839
a window into hopefully guessing more to

353
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,839
what's going on

354
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,880
because that's how it works people with

355
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,800
chronic illness

356
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,160
they go they go they go they go they go

357
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,639
to the doctor they don't know what's

358
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,160
wrong

359
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,680
they have all the dizziness tingles

360
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,040
numbness chest tightness and now they're

361
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,000
going to a specialist another

362
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,600
neurologist

363
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,120
and they get all this blood taken right

364
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,279
linda totally

365
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,120
and yeah to try to get a window and i

366
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,639
believe in blood tests i want people to

367
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,560
go get a blood test but there's a way to

368
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,920
do it that can protect you and save your

369
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,680
life because they take

370
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,519
too much blood and you lose your immune

371
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,040
system listen to the episode linda

372
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,959
that's what you should do right there

373
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,120
it's important so

374
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,320
when they take your blood you lose your

375
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,440
cbc

376
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,920
cbc you were good to me now you're going

377
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,480
off

378
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,000
bye bye you know you know that's how it

379
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,000
works because they take your your

380
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,399
complete blood count right a piece of

381
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,519
it a piece of it you lose your white

382
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,320
blood cells they take

383
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,760
20 vials 30 vials they'll take 24 vials

384
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,920
they'll take 14 vials

385
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,680
and you just lose lose lose and the

386
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,320
whole 7 vials

387
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,440
5 full vials but complete vials right

388
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,839
full vials

389
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,760
and we lose our immune system and it

390
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,399
takes months to get our immune system

391
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,959
back but

392
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,519
while that's happening a little buggy is

393
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,160
coming up

394
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,279
reactivated epstein-barr that now signs

395
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,360
research takes

396
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,440
by information and they're using it now

397
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,160
right i published it first

398
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,279
but anyway reactivated epstein-barr and

399
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,519
what happens is

400
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,959
that reactivated epstein-barr comes out

401
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,279
because you're losing your immune system

402
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,360
from

403
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,880
all the blood draws right and then in

404
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,480
the end sure

405
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,079
the doctor might see something in your

406
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,120
blood draw but

407
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:30,320
also when they keep on taking blood

408
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,200
they keep on making you deficient so now

409
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,720
it's like

410
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,880
if now it's like this whole thing really

411
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,680
the last blood test i had i'm more

412
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,760
deficient than i was before

413
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,360
my my nutritional my nutritional

414
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,560

better i am eating better

417
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,320
what it is is they start removing

418
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:55,600
everything from you from all that

419
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:58,240
deb scott surprised to find find you

420
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:01,440
making fun of spiritual advisors

421
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,279
and all that airy fairy stuff you know

422
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,160
like when spirit told you to tell your

423
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:09,040
grandmother she had lung cancer i think

424
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,519
we've been duped you come a long way you

425
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,680
know

426
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,600
deb what happens with me okay just so

427
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,720
you know is i've had to undo

428
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:20,000
a lot of spiritually damaged

429
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:22,399
people through 35 years of work okay

430
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,839
so people who are chronically ill and

431
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,560
really sick

432
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,199
come pouring into my office okay

433
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,360
including

434
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,040
patients that doctors would send right

435
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:35,040
pouring into my office

436
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:36,720
and people were so mind damaged

437
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,560
they were told they had a fear of

438
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,279
healing they were told they manifested

439
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,839
their sickness

440
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:43,040
can you imagine you're being told that

441
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,079
so i created it

442
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:48,079
like i created my sickness and then they

443
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:50,160
they do that right they've also told

444
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:53,279
people it's all because you didn't

445
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,720
solve something in a past life right so

446
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,920
that's another thing too

447
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,040
i've had people just so head screwed so

448
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:02,800
duped

449
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,920
so fooled okay and we're really hurt and

450
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,839
bad because of it

451
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,199
because if yeah i'm not saying spiritual

452
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,279
advisors are bad

453
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:11,199
i'm just saying i've seen some damaged

454
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:14,240
people being told

455
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,959
some crazy stuff and they walked into my

456
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,120
office

457
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:19,199
and guess what spirit of compassion did

458
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,600
told them what was wrong

459
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,199
so their doctor can help them uh spirit

460
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,600
of compassion didn't say

461
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:28,240
that they had their they were beheaded

462
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,079
okay in 1645

463
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,240
the spirit of compassion didn't say they

464
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,120
manifested it spirit of compassion never

465
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,199
said to anyone you

466
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,440
created it spirit of compassion never

467
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:39,680
said you got a fear of healing

468
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,759
and spirit of compassion never said your

469
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,560
body is attacking itself like medical

470
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,079
science

471
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,920
and they never said anything else like

472
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,880
that he never said anything else like

473
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,600
that but they

474
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,279
always tell people that it's your body

475
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,920
attacking itself that's what they say

476
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,320
so what that's the difference right

477
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,639
there

478
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,600
and i have respect for any spiritual

479
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,120
advisor

480
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,600
even when they're making massive

481
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,240
mistakes like i've seen along the way

482
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,759

528
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,120
seaweed hero says seaweed hero good to

529
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,080
see you why does facebook always say

530
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,760
content can't be played right now so

531
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,200
glad i can see you on youtube the reason

532
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,160
why is because they're kicking everybody

533
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,760
off of facebook

534
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,440
facebook's supposed to have probably up

535
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,360
to 10 000 people on there

536
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,720
live and they kick them all off while

537
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,720
you're trying to come on

538
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,080
um so we only have like a few people

539
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,280
they're only allowing a few people

540
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,880
tonight that's what they do

541
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:06,559
same thing on instagram um margot so

542
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,679
getting viruses is completely

543
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:11,039
random no no karma at all and there's no

544
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,280
karma involved

545
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:15,360
absolutely not absolutely not we come

546
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,880
into this world of viruses we come into

547
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,520
this world with ebv

548
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,679
and shingles that we get from utero we

549
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,559
get passed down from our parents we come

550
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,960
into this world like that we easily can

551
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,640
get

552
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,520
viruses here i'll talk about that too

553
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:32,400
relationships

554
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,280
friendships drinking off of somebody's

555
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,799
glass

556
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:39,440
you can just it's easy to get pathogens

557
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,840
you didn't ask to be sick like there's

558
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,559
no

559
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,160
karma involved that's not you're not

560
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,559
paying back

561
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,440
you're not paying back on the karmic

562
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,360
channel

563
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,760
you know so that's important too you

564
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:54,840
know bugs were

565
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,160
created by well they were they were

566
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,799
manipulated

567
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,919
bugs were manipulated a hundred years

568
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:03,280
ago

569
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:06,000
by some mad men okay in the industry

570
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,520
they were manipulated they were raised

571
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,919
propagated

572
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:12,240
they were proliferated they were put

573
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:14,320
into the system along the way

574
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,600
and that's how it works darkness and bad

575
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:19,039
people okay

576
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:22,720
darkest bad people um

577
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:24,480
your spiritual advisor so there's no bad

578
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,080
people in the world

579
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,600
what do you mean there's no bad people

580
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:32,960
in the world you mean everybody's good

581
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:36,880
so there's people aren't bad

582
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:39,039
really that's hard to believe though

583
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,720
because what about the six million jews

584
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:44,240
that were gassed

585
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:46,799
and murdered that there wasn't a

586
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:49,360
bad thing or something well the people

587
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:51,600
weren't bad that did it to them

588
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,480
um so there's no bad people out there so

589
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,760
what about

590
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,320
all the viruses that they raised in all

591
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,799
the

592
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,400
eggs and stuff and then somehow escaped

593
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:03,919
the labs

594
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:06,240
bad people weren't creating bad bugs

595
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:08,159
okay then how did it happen and that's

596
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,480
how it works it's really kind of

597
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:13,360
strange i'm gonna make some food can't

598
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,360
fool around all night

599
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,480
and um so

600
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,120
so anyway i'm going to move the eggs and

601
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,520
i'm also going to wash my

602
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,600
hands really quick okay you guys bear

603
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,679
with me please

604
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,640
um i got a sink right here i don't know

605
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,640
if you can see it you're probably

606
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,679
catching a little bit of it there

607
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,880
um touching eggs and i don't think it's

608
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,280
a smart move to touch

609
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,200
eggs and to be making minority rolls to

610
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,400
start making normal let me get the blood

611
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,039
off of the

612
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:48,480
counter too if that's okay maybe even

613
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:50,400
get my phone over here

614
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,520
terry went against medical advice

615
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,240

639
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,159
right here

640
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,679
the thing is with the vagus nerve it's

641
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,600
always been a mystery

642
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,919
no one knew it had anything to do with

643
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,679
these symptoms before medical medium

644
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:52,559
put the information out there so medical

645
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:54,720
medium information was the vagus nerve

646
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,159
becomes inflamed and you get the tingles

647
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,640
and numbness and the tightness of the

648
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:01,520
chest this 35 years of work

649
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,280
and now the vagus nerve has seemed to

650
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,799
get popular because just like medical

651
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,240
medium information getting out there

652
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,640
people pick up on it

653
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,559
you guys can't even imagine or maybe you

654
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,760
can't imagine how many practitioners and

655
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,679
how many doctors

656
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,200
have read the medical medium books never

657
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,120
mind how many i've talked to before the

658
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,640
medical meeting books came out

659
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:24,320
and how medical immune information has

660
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,600
has renovated the medical world or the

661
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:29,280
holistic world too

662
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:32,880
renovated refurbished

663
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:36,320
because um no one knew what did what

664
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,320
with all these mystery symptoms

665
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:41,280
linda says so nobody's ever known what

666
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:43,280
to do with the vagus nerve until the

667
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:45,440
medical medium has

668
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,679
spoken okay that's a bunch of charlton

669
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,679
talk

670
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:56,559
that's a good one there linda

671
00:22:52,799 --> 00:23:00,000
hey linda linda linda

672
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:03,039
um just so you know

673
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:08,799
medical medium book was published

674
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:11,919
six and a half years ago yeah yeah and

675
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:16,240
it was all unique and original

676
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:19,600
fact yeah and then science and research

677
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,320
took the information and published it

678
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,400
later

679
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,000
but you don't like that right so linda

680
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,880
you don't like that

681
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,600
okay so someone's not allowed to

682
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,400
actually

683
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,919
start something original and unique and

684
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,799
take any credit

685
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,000
okay okay so let me just bow down i

686
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:39,039
can't take any credit

687
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,039
ever i started all this new information

688
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:43,919
that never was out there in the world

689
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,559
published first by medical medium so i

690
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,840
guess

691
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:51,200
is it because i have a big ego linda and

692
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:52,880
the ego needs to be fed it's not because

693
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,400
i need people to heal so they could find

694
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,760
out where it originated so they have

695
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,960
answers

696
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:02,080
uh okay all right i will bow down

697
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:04,559
um i i didn't start anything new

698
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,880
okay all right i i don't want to get you

699
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:09,200
upset linda i know it's too much for you

700
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,919
okay i'm gonna go i gotta go you're

701
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,080
you're just

702
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,400
you're really hard to talk to you guys

703
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,240
have to understand this that

704
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,720
what linda doesn't understand and it's

705
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:21,760
really hard for her is that medical

706
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,480
medium information started a tremendous

707
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,159
amount

708
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,000
of original and unique information

709
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:28,159
that's in our system today yeah we knew

710
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:32,080
about the vagus nerve of course we did

711
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:33,279
we did not know that it gets inflamed we

712
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,440
did not know

713
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,480
that the epstein-barr inflames it we did

714
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,320
not know

715
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,240
that the vagus nerve causes tingles and

716
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,960
numbness okay

717
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,840
nausea we didn't know that tightness in

718
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,960
chest

719
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,840
alright anxiety we did not know of any

720
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,039
of this information

721
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,799
35 years of work just like the blood

722
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:55,120
draw information okay

723
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:57,039
medical medium is the first to put out

724
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,360
the information

725
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:01,120
that they're removing too much blood

726
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,400
removing your immune system and people

727
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,039
are going backwards with

728
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,400
their health that is unique and original

729
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,559
medical mean information

730
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,159
so why is it that i got to keep on

731
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:11,360
coming out with unique original

732
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,799
information that's never been heard

733
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,320
anywhere else

734
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,840
and then doctors take the information

735
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:18,240
and then it goes around and goes around

736
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,480
and then somebody named linda just

737
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,320
doesn't want to hear it

738
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,240
just doesn't even believe it and doesn't

739
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:27,200
want to hear it when it's

740
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,720
fact including other public publishing

741
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,960
too

742
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,880
linda says neurologist do you know that

743
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,440
why are you acting like

744
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,200
nobody knew that see this is arrogance

745
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,000
right there and it's an appropriate

746
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,279
neurologist

747
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:44,400
know that that's possible and noted its

748
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:46,799
medical journals really because

749
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,480
millions of people went to neurologists

750
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,279
and they didn't know their tingles and

751
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,440
numbness

752
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:56,880
came from their vagus nerve you are 100

753
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,919
wrong they didn't know the nausea that

754
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,919
was mysterious

755
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,039
came from the vagus nerve they didn't

756
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,799
know the vertigo

757
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:05,039
ever came from the vagus nerve guess

758
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:06,400
what they still don't

759
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,159
medical research and science doesn't

760
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,240
know any of this doctors are

761
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,240
using the information now for medical

762
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:15,600
media anxiety

763
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:17,200
vertigo mysterious nausea is all from

764
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,200
the vagus nerve that's medical medium

765
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,400
information i'm really sorry but you're

766
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,279
a hundred percent

767
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,480
wrong call it arrogance call it what you

00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,640
michelle l my neurologist never told me

772
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,799
that

773
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,919
no neurologist has ever told anybody

774
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:39,760
that not

775
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:42,159
one neurologist pre-medical medium books

776
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:44,080
probably don't even tell people that now

777
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:46,880
and so i'm just saying but not one

778
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,840

not one person found a neurologist that

787
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,760
knew the vagus nerve

788
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,159
did any of those symptoms including

789
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:09,200

many thousands and thousands of women

800
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:35,679
walked into the neurologist's office

801
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:38,720
and never got told any of that exactly

802
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:40,640

to that either they told me

806
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,159
they told me my post-concussion vertigo

807
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,200
five months

808
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:55,440
sorry five months on was all in my head

809
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,559

00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,600
head they thought you were making it up

811
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:59,440
each other and that was

812
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,360
that was many neurologists you went to

813
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:04,640

uh ud says bs we all know what the vagus

816
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,640
nerve does

817
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,760
oh you do it came from medical medium

818
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,799

this is how it's done like i noticed

823
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,039
that

824
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:27,919

828
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,840
make stuff

829
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:39,919
up monica i went to a neurologist

830
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,120
vanderbilt could not tell me what was

831
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,279
going on

832
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,880
yeah incredible neurologist right could

833
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:47,279
not tell anybody

834
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,200
a marjorie i would have never known the

835
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:50,640
reason why i was losing my voice it was

836
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,679
the vagus nerve

837
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:56,559
yeah exactly um

838
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:57,279
sandra so the vagus nerve is inflamed by

839
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,679
the ebv

840
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,799
yes the shingles can inflame it too and

841
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,159
i'm gonna cover that

842
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:04,000
gotta make some food though we're having

843
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,360
a good time tonight it's great

844
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,520
jennifer it's frozen shoulder

845
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:10,559
neurological if it's not an

846
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:13,200
injury if it's not a bad injury

847
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:13,919
my neurologist diagnosed me with it and

848
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,159
can't

849
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,760
sorry and believes it to be viral it's

850
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:20,799
medical medium information

851
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:23,760
so the shingles

852
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:24,960
is the virus this is that's medical

853
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:28,480
medium information

854
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:31,440
originates from here not one doctor

855
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,760
on the planet knew that frozen shoulder

856
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,640
was

857
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,360
viral this is you got to remember

858
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,840
millions

859
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:40,240
of this first edition went around the

860
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:42,159
world

861
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,679
patients brought their books into

862
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:46,640
doctors there's not a doctor

863
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:48,399
out there that a patient didn't bring in

864
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,039
a medical medium book to them

865
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:51,760
there's not one out there and so the

866
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,000
shingles

867
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,679
i released to the world how the shingles

868
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,960
is behind frozen shoulder

869
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:01,440
so yeah you guys i mean

870
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,240
i don't need the credit for an ego thing

871
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,559
just so you know

872
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,320
okay so i know that someone might think

873
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:08,159
that i don't need the credit for these

874
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,880
incredible discoveries of

875
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:12,640
medicine right that are being used right

876
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,159
why everybody just dumps on me you know

877
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,080
what i mean and says that where's my

878
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:18,000
research papers where's my studies

879
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,480
how come i'm not a doctor right and

880
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,120
again i get peed on constantly all the

881
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,880
time

882
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,279
and i don't want credit because i got

883
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,320
this

884
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:29,840
like it's got to feed my ego i want

885
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,840
people to be able to find out where they

886
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,480
can hear how they can heal it it's one

887
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,080
thing when

888
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,799
a neurologist picks up the medical

889
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:40,320
medium information tells a patient

890
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:41,840
hey this is what's going on it's another

891
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,480
for the patient to be able to actually

892
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:46,480
find information and get and get better

893
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,480
they they project their own darkness

894
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,799
michelle ell says

895
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,720
constant my dog constance my doctor

896
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,440
looked at me like i had a third eye

897
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,440
growing

898
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,200
when i mentioned my vagus nerve was

899
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:00,159
irritated and taking

900
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,960
and and taking lemon balm helped relax

901
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:04,000
it

902
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:06,720
exactly but uh but

903
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,240
constance i thought everybody knew about

904
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,840
what the vagus nerve does i thought

905
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,880
every single doctor knew what the vagus

906
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:14,159
nerve does

907
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:16,399
you know exactly luno

908
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:18,080
it's frustrating the thing is is yeah it

909
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:19,919
is lunalle says it must be so

910
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,679
frustrating to share the info first and

911
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,360
then so many plagiarizing and signs

912
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,679
catching up with the mm info

913
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,399
and still mm info gets dragged in the

914
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:29,600
mud

915
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:30,960
it's part of i guess the you know the

916
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,279
entire

917
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,799
journey exactly it's just it's

918
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:37,120
incredible road let's make some noise

919
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:39,200
rules let's get going on this

920
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,640
but you know what i don't lose sleep

921
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:45,039
over it

922
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:47,760
because i figure it this way that

923
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:48,159
look the information's getting out there

924
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,159
okay

925
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:51,679
people won't heal if they don't get the

926
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:54,799
rest of the information

927
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:57,840
right or if some of these some of these

928
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:59,200
doctors or practitioners or health gurus

929
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,519
take some of the information it look

930
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:04,000
like heroes themselves fine

931
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:05,760
i'm all right with that i just want

932
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,399
people though to be able to get back to

933
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:10,159
all the info to heal that's what gets my

934
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:14,159
goat right there

935
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:15,600
uh rachel paid 1 000 for the doctor

936
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:18,080
and they couldn't explain my heart

937
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:21,440
flutters took your microc

938
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:24,799
no flutterings heart fluttering that's

939
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,440
topic ectopic heart flutters that are a

940
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:29,519
topic

941
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:30,960
um uh mystery heart palpitations which

942
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,640
i'm going to talk about medical medium

943
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,000
it's the epstein-barr virus it's low

944
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:38,240
grade viral right

945
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:41,120
so um let's do like a little heart thing

946
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,480
really quick we got a bigger heart

947
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,200
you guys okay i'm taking a little food

948
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:47,279
break but i'm gonna make the food so

949
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,039
what happens with the valves right

950
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:51,440
there's this sticky stuff

951
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:52,159
that gets created by the epstein-barr

952
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,799
virus

953
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:56,080
okay advanced information the head of

954
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:58,159
science and research of course

955
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,919
and they're going to steal this too so

956
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,559
they'll steal everything from me down

957
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:02,559
the road

958
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:03,760
which i don't care but people won't be

959
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:05,279
able to find their way back

960
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,039
to get all the information to heal all

961
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:10,559
the way and that's what's scary to me

962
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:13,360
so the virus sits inside the liver okay

963
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:14,880
and it releases all of this byproduct

964
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,600
and i'm talking about information right

965
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,600
out of here

966
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,720
new addition it releases all this

967
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,799
byproduct

968
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,480
the byproduct builds up in your liver

969
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,399
and builds up in your liver and builds

970
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:27,279
up in your liver this is the sludge

971
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:28,640
and it builds up in your liver right and

972
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:31,760
then eventually

973
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:34,720
it puffs out of the liver and

974
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,679
heads up the highway highway is your

975
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,799
bloodstream

976
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:42,480
heading directly to the heart

977
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:43,679
that junk sticky jelly starts to build

978
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,840
up in the valves

979
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:47,760
becomes a mystery to the doctor it

980
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:51,360
builds up in the mitral valve

981
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:53,840
okay uh tricuspid valve it

982
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:56,000
bicuspid valve if you're somebody with a

983
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:59,200
bicuspid valve right

984
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:02,320
and um aortic valve right

985
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:06,559
so it gets in there okay and it and

986
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:09,280
and then it sticks and all of a sudden

987
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:10,399
it sticks for like like less than a

988
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,520
millisecond

989
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:13,520
and when it does that because the

990
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,320
jelly's in there you get the heart

991
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,679
flutters

992
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,000
so when you start taking care of

993
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:20,560
yourself like medical beam information

994
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,079
the celery juice and everything else

995
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,560
you're cleaning up your liver

996
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:27,359
you're cleaning up that gunk all right

997
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:30,399
and the heart palpitations go away or

998
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:31,440
topic heartbeat or flutters they go away

999
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:33,839
right

1000
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,440
there's a heart palpitation protocol in

1001
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:38,399
medical medium new addition too

1002
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,639
just just so you know right so let's go

1003
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:41,040
and

1004
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:42,159
just just cover one last thing with it

1005
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:46,839
but

1006
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:49,599
vagus nerve can also cause the problem

1007
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:53,359
electrically electrical

1008
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:56,879
your vagus nerve nerve nerves nerve

1009
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:57,920
signaling to the heart from toxic heavy

1010
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:01,520
metals

1011
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:03,599
and viruses inflaming the vagus nerve

1012
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,680
it could go that way or the junk in the

1013
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:07,760
heart it could go either or

1014
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,800
and then you got it right advanced

1015
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,440
medical information

1016
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,560
linda how do you like that just

1017
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,079
wondering

1018
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:17,440
um are you gone yet so let's think about

1019
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:22,079
vertigo in a second

1020
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:24,720
um okay right to vertigo

1021
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:27,520
natalie so what what do we do now vagus

1022
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:30,560
nerve exercises i want my life back

1023
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:33,920
from vertigo okay so

1024
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:36,640
if i had vertigo like what what um

1025
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,760
i was just talking about i mean for

1026
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,720
family members

1027
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,599
friends if i had vertigo i'd be on the

1028
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,599
micro sea

1029
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,119
and the microc was helping the other

1030
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:47,839
person with

1031
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:50,160
her vertigo because it was cleaning up

1032
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:52,320
the viral junk so that epstein-barr

1033
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,359
viral junk was getting cleaned up it was

1034
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:57,839
getting cleaned up

1035
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:59,599
out of the liver plus the vitamin c

1036
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:02,000
it does is it supports the immune system

1037
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,960
so your immune systems eat eating up the

1038
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,800
vitamin c

1039
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,800
your immune system your white blood

1040
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,400
cells they're there those are the things

1041
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:12,079
that actually fight the virus

1042
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:15,440
right so when you give your white

1043
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:16,960
blood cells vitamin c okay

1044
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,320
and you can get any vitamin c you want

1045
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,440
to get out there this is just the one i

1046
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,640
use for my for me

1047
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,040
my friends and family this is the

1048
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:24,800
vimergy microc and i'm not sponsored

1049
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:27,760
just letting you guys know which one i

1050
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:30,160
use and which one i give to my family

1051
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,119
so anyway the bottom line is your white

1052
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,760
count

1053
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:34,400
feeds off of vitamin c gets nice and

1054
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,960
strong

1055
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,480
then goes and kills off the epstein bar

1056
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,000
less epstein-barr

1057
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,680
heart flutters that are mystery

1058
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,160
mysterious from to the doctor

1059
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:45,280
start to go away that that's important

1060
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,119
right there okay

1061
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,320
um let's talk about vertigo a little bit

1062
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:51,599
too

1063
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:54,880
so okay let's go back to this so vertigo

1064
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:57,520
you got your epstein-barr virus okay

1065
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,560
the epstein-barr virus is releasing a

1066
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,800
neurotoxin

1067
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,640
it's feeding off of toxic heavy metals

1068
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,119
so say you're somebody that's

1069
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,960
into tuna you got all that mercury how

1070
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:07,760
much tuna have you had in your life

1071
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,520
right

1072
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,040
how much tuna have you eaten in your

1073
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,200
life so

1074
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:16,160
your epstein bars feeding off of all

1075
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:19,280
that mercury then it releases

1076
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:21,599
a neurotoxin the neurotoxin clings

1077
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,400
to the vagus nerve so it clings to the

1078
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:25,040
vagus nerve

1079
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:27,200
that's what the neurotoxin does and when

1080
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,760
it clings to the vagus nerve it inflames

1081
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:31,200
it

1082
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:33,839
and game on anything

1083
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:35,280
and everything can happen because that

1084
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:37,119
vagus nerve can inflame

1085
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,760
at the bottom it can inflame in the

1086
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:42,079
middle it can inflame at the top

1087
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,960
it can inflame even higher and when it

1088
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:44,720
gets inflamed

1089
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,400
you'll get the boat thing you're like

1090
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,119
rocking on the boat you're trying to

1091
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,960
walk

1092
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:50,800
you get the spins where you're just like

1093
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,720
this is going on and you're spinning

1094
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,880
you lay in the bed you're laying in your

1095
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:57,440
bed and you're at night and and the room

1096
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,440
is doing this

1097
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,599
like that you're not even spinning the

1098
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:04,480
room is going one way stopping

1099
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:06,079
going stopping like this and if anybody

1100
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:08,160
has vertigo now i'm really sorry that i

1101
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:09,839
hope i'm not creating a little bit of me

1102
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,880
not creating but i hope i'm not like

1103
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:12,400
tweaking you out

1104
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,920
that's how sensitive people get with

1105
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,400
vertigo where anything

1106
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,560
moving and if they can't watch

1107
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,800
television they can't watch a show

1108
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:22,880
they can't watch it's really hard right

1109
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,160
and protocols are in medical medium book

1110
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,240
one so

1111
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,079
i mean if you guys don't have this linda

1112
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:30,160
take the book to your doctor

1113
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:32,000
okay the the person that was hating on

1114
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:35,040
me take the book to your doctor ask

1115
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,520
your doctor what they think um

1116
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:39,760
candy says listen i get it but it's a

1117
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,640
little over the top today i think we

1118
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,920
have to hold

1119

it was really bad back years ago like

1194
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,400
if you got sick with anything that was

1195
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:34,960
mysterious

1196
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:37,040
families turned against you i've seen

1197
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,800
families turn against people i've seen

1198
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,800
friends turn against people

1199
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,319
i've seen doctors turn against people

1200
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:45,200
i've seen people lost

1201
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:46,480
no hope for years and years now it's a

1202
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,760
little better you can go to your

1203
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,520
functional medicine doctor and they'll

1204
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,720
be like hearing your symptoms now for

1205
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,599

them more and more

1207
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:55,040
and then they might have some respect

1208
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:57,839
but it wasn't like that

1209
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,079
kristin jay cohen he never said vitamin

1210
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:00,960

1211
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:00,960

1212
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:08,000
um that's just one thing first of all

1213
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:10,079

1214
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,400
very important to know that vitamin c

1215
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:18,160

1222
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,760

1258
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:47,119
if you work at 100 and study the info

1259
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:49,680

1350
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:06,319

1351
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:08,000
confuse medical medium people who are

1352

information

1361
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,119

1526
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,960
your doctor

1527
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:32,480
and ask your doctor to customize it for

1528
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:34,960
you if you want

1529
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:36,319
but epstein-barr is the cause of vertigo

1530
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,920
right

1531
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:39,359
and i'm gonna read about vertigo too a

1532
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:42,480
little bit um

1533
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:45,599
and i got that section right here

1534
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:47,440
but let me go and look into this book

1535
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:48,880
right here which is a new edition do you

1536
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,400
have the new edition

1537
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:52,000
god there's so much information in here

1538
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:55,200
it's incredible

1539
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:57,119
so ebv is is what

1540
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:58,880
just for the record is what is what's

1541
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:00,079
behind vertigo that's mysterious unless

1542
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:03,440
your vagus nerve was

1543
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:05,920
injured unless it was physically injured

1544
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:06,480
but if you look in here okay you guys

1545
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,960
you'll see

1546
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:10,640
supplements all right just look there we

1547
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:13,920
go supplements

1548
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:15,119
for vertigo and veneers right

1549
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:17,599
i guess you probably can't see it's

1550
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:19,200
probably whiting out okay

1551
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:20,480
and it teaches you how to use the

1552
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:22,400
supplements right you'll say fresh

1553
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:23,200
celery juice work up to 32 ounces daily

1554
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,880
now i'm just going to give you

1555
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,880
information here

1556
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:28,800
you don't have to do everything all at

1557
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:31,200
once like i tell family members and

1558
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:34,079
friends who ask me about this

1559
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:35,119
that they can start with a few things

1560
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:36,880
read the book

1561
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:39,440
though that's why it's so important to

1562
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:41,680
read the book and to read the chapter

1563
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:43,760
it's critical to to know what you can do

1564
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:45,280
or not do meaning what's easiest to do

1565
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:46,720
or what a great way to start

1566
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:48,400
but you'll see here fresh celery juice

1567
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:49,280
work up to 32 ounces if that's the only

1568
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,799
thing you do

1569
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:52,799
and that's how you start then that's how

1570
00:54:50,799 --> 00:54:56,240
you start right and you see how you go

1571
00:54:52,799 --> 00:54:58,559
now and then it says um

1572
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:59,440
celery force right so it's a celery

1573
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:01,359
force and that

1574
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:03,119
that is a great i don't even have it

1575
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:04,720
right here but celery force is an option

1576
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:07,920
for a lot of people it helps

1577
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:10,079
it is barley grass juice powder which um

1578
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:11,760
is the vimergy stuff that i use but you

1579
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:13,760
can if you want to use somebody else's

1580
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:15,119
barley grass use powder you can

1581
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:17,760
i'm just telling you the one i use that

1582
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:20,720
i trust the best and then it says b

1583
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:22,400
complex then it says cat's claw so

1584
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:24,240
here's a cat's claw here that

1585
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:26,319
i recommend for my family and friends

1586
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:29,520
that's the one i use right

1587
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:30,000
so it's cat's claw and it shows dosages

1588
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:32,400
in

1589
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,599
the book now you can ask your doctor any

1590
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,359
of this information you can take the

1591
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:37,359
book to your doctor

1592
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:39,280
i'm just telling you what i do for

1593
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:40,960
myself or for my family members i've

1594
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:43,440
never had vertigo

1595
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:45,280
but um but it doesn't mean i don't

1596
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,799
understand it and it doesn't mean i

1597
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,599
don't understand the pain and suffering

1598
00:55:46,799 --> 00:55:50,480
involved

1599
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:52,079
and the hell people go through that cat

1600
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,640
cat's claw doesn't have alcohol in it

1601
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:54,400
and that's

1602
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:56,160
one thing that goes wrong when people be

1603
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:57,599
like all right i'll go get a cat's claw

1604
00:55:56,160 --> 00:56:01,760
right that's the vimergy

1605
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:05,200
the uh v is victor i am as mary e r g y

1606
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:06,720
and um the there's no natural flavors

1607
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,920
there's no alcohol in here

1608
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,440
someone will get a cat's call and

1609
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:10,400
they'll just get one with alcohol and if

1610
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:12,880
this matters

1611
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,760
because someone could go out there buy a

1612
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:15,920
cat's claw

1613
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:17,280
anthony williams said do a cat squad and

1614
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:19,599
they go buy a cat's claw

1615
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:21,440
and i'm not getting better i'm getting

1616
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:24,400
worse or i'm not feeling good

1617
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:24,960
because the cat's got alcohol in it corn

1618
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:28,240
grain

1619
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:29,119
alcohol or natural flavors or citric

1620
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:31,520
acid

1621
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:32,799
right they had that in there so people

1622
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:34,160
got to understand like

1623
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:36,480
there's all these problems with

1624
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:38,319
supplements too so i have a directory at

1625
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:40,160
medical media.com for what i think is

1626
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:43,040
the safest and best right

1627
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:44,079
so cat's claws in here right there is an

1628
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:46,000
option um

1629
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:47,760
chaga mushroom that's a good mushroom

1630
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,000
for vertigo

1631
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:52,000
um curcumin that's one right there

1632
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,079
that's also a good option for

1633
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,160
don't have it right here but like i

1634
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:58,720
recommend the vimergy curcumin

1635
00:56:56,160 --> 00:57:01,119
so and then um and then it goes on and

1636
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:04,160
it talks about lysine now

1637
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:07,599
that's a critical one right there

1638
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:09,200
lysine is critical for vertigo

1639
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:10,799
critical because you're dealing with the

1640
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:14,319
epstein-barr virus right

1641
00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:15,920
so it's so important to know um

1642
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:18,160
these are these are the details that

1643
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:20,640
matter lemon balm

1644
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:22,319
right then it has the lemon balm there

1645
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:24,000
um there's a licorice root

1646
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:25,680
has the licorice root right there so

1647
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,160
there's a licorice root

1648
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:29,839
right and so you can just start out

1649
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:31,200
little at a time i talk about it in the

1650
00:57:29,839 --> 00:57:32,559
book where you can just start out with a

1651
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:35,200
little b12

1652
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:36,640
a little bit of lemon balm um some

1653
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:38,799
vitamin c

1654
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:40,559
but but you know you can do that but the

1655
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:42,000
point is is that

1656
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:44,079
these are the different these are the

1657
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,160
different supplements and dosages

1658
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:48,000
this is what i recommend for family and

1659
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:49,839
friends right like the bimraji

1660
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,520
but like i said take the book to your

1661
00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:52,880
doctor ask your doctor what's right for

1662
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:53,520
you maybe your doctor doesn't want you

1663
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,880
to use

1664
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:56,640
anything in the book and your worker

1665
00:57:54,880 --> 00:58:00,079
wants to go different direction

1666
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:03,200
for you you know um i know and so

1667
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:05,280
the bottom line is the information is

1668
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:07,359
there though for vertigo because vertigo

1669
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:09,520
is caused by epsine bar

1670
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:11,040
barr likes to feed off of foods we like

1671
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:12,079
stepsim bar likes to feed off the eggs

1672
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,440
that are right there which i don't want

1673
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:16,720
to touch right now

1674
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:17,680
um so anyway these nori sheets got

1675
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:18,960

1676
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:22,160

1689
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:56,960
i agree i know medical medium

1690
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:59,760
information has reversed

1691
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:01,520
so many people's vertigo conditions just

1706
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:46,799
sigridowski says evil people can be very

1707
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,520
covertly hostile and are always in bad

1708
00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:49,680
mood

1709
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:51,040
most people have a hard time to see what

1710
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:53,520
is true or not

1711
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:56,079
i know everything mm says is true i do

1712
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:57,040
health food since 40 years oh my god 40

1713
00:59:56,079 --> 01:00:00,079
years in it

1714
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:02,799
wow wow

1715
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:04,160
you got me beat been doing this for 35

1716
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:07,680
years yeah since age

1717
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:09,200
four i've been giving uh people advice

1718
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:10,079
with their health and spirit compassion

1719
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:11,680
talking to me

1720
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:13,599
so i guess you could say since age four

1721
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:17,280
so it's a lot more than 35 years

1722
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:19,839
but you know really hardcore

1723
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,839
is different

1724
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:24,799
so yeah okay guys i just made a few of

1725
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:29,280
these let me cut them for you too

1726
01:00:24,799 --> 01:00:30,799
okay let me move the cat's claw out okay

1727
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:32,640
did you guys get your wild blueberry

1728
01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:34,160
juice yet i'm so pumped up about this

1729
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:36,559
stuff it's so incredible

1730
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:36,559
um

1731
01:00:37,359 --> 01:00:40,559
so let's talk about titus in the chest

1732
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:42,240
what happens is when the vagus nerve

1733
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:45,760
gets inflamed okay

1734
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:48,559
see how i'm cutting these right

1735
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:49,200
i'm cutting them a little smaller so

1736
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:52,319
they're not

1737
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:54,000
huge pieces right when the vagus nerve

1738
01:00:52,319 --> 01:00:55,520
gets inflamed you can get the tightness

1739
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,319
in the chest which is really in

1740
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:58,880
a difficult one now the vagus nerve when

1741
01:00:58,319 --> 01:01:03,119
it gets it

1742
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:05,520
inflamed higher like higher up

1743
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:06,960
brain or down lower in the neck you can

1744
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:08,640
still get tightness to the chest you can

1745
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:11,200
still get tightness in the chest

1746
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:11,920
when the vagus nerve is inflamed at the

1747
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,599
bottom

1748
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:15,680
but what you usually get when the vagus

1749
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:16,480
nerve is inflamed at the bottom is a lot

1750
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:21,680
of

1751
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:22,799
nausea that's unexplainable right nausea

1752
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:25,760
so i'm going to start putting some of

1753
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:29,119
these here for you guys

1754
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:29,119
you can make a dipping sauce

1755
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:35,119

1756
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:35,119

1758
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:41,920

you know

1775
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:16,640
um because i want to help people so

1776
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:17,200
badly when they remove too much blood

1777
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:18,799
from you

1778
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:20,240
or remove blood from you they're

1779
01:02:18,799 --> 01:02:21,680
removing glucose

1780
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:23,039
and here's how it works and i want to

1781
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:26,079
give you that i want to give you a quick

1782
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:26,079
rundown on that okay

1783
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:30,000
when they remove your blood your glucose

1784
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:33,200
from blood draws

1785
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,240
right that glucose is what's keeping

1786
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:37,599
your brain

1787
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:39,680
strong so the minute that glucose

1788
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:41,839
get disappears from the blood draw your

1789
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:45,839
brain will know it's starving

1790
01:02:41,839 --> 01:02:47,359
it's starving um within five seconds of

1791
01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:48,319
not getting glucose your brain starts to

1792
01:02:47,359 --> 01:02:50,400
die

1793
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:52,240
i mean it's really five seconds it just

1794
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,680
starts it's like it needs glucose

1795
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:55,359
and you still have glucose that's why

1796
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:57,599
you're okay but

1797
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:59,839
even some taken out like on the blood

1798
01:02:57,599 --> 01:03:02,240
draw even with some taken out

1799
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:04,160
you can feel it and be just starving be

1800
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:05,760
hungry for a long time

1801
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:08,000
so that happens all the time to drop

1802
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:10,720
that that happens all the time

1803
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:12,880
um but anyway i'm gonna just cut these

1804
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:16,720

they get her up they get her ebv's they

1845
01:04:46,319 --> 01:04:48,960
get her simplexes they get her other

1846
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:52,880
viruses

1847
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:55,440
they get hhv sixes but

1848
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:56,079
but i mean this is life i mean it's it's

1849
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:58,640
either

1850
01:04:56,079 --> 01:04:59,119
the the thing is with blood donation is

1851
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:01,359
is

1852
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:02,960
we need blood donations right because we

1853
01:05:01,359 --> 01:05:03,680
need to save people's lives for

1854
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:07,599
surgeries

1855
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:09,200
life-saving medicine car accidents um

1856
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:10,960
all kinds of issues right with heart

1857
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:13,119
surgeries all of it so we need

1858
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:14,960
we need blood transfusions for a lot of

1859
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:15,599
different conditions so we need that so

1860
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:17,680
yeah

1861
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:18,640
people might pick up you know somebody

1862
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:22,000
else's ebv

1863
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:24,480
but ebv doesn't ebv is not really in the

1864
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,119
blood a lot so that's why it's it's okay

1865
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:26,880
because

1866
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:28,240
even though you could potentially

1867
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:30,000
somebody could get potentially get

1868
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:32,160
somebody's ebv but that's if it's more

1869
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:34,160
of an infectious stage in that moment

1870
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:36,000
but if it's not an infectious stage not

1871
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:38,000
reactivated or anything like that

1872
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:40,000
then they won't get it chances are they

1873
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,200
won't get it because ebv tends to stay

1874
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,960
in all the organs

1875
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:44,720
and it hides in all the organs but

1876
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:46,720
someone could potentially get one from

1877
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:48,000
somebody's shore through that it it does

1878
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:50,000
happen but that's

1879
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,440
not my concern is this is listen to the

1880
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,119
podcast though right the blood draw

1881
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:54,799
podcast my concern is

1882
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:56,400
and your number one question is does

1883
01:05:54,799 --> 01:05:59,599
blood draw does does

1884
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:02,799
donated blood hurt us and

1885
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:05,200
i talk about how it takes away our

1886
01:06:02,799 --> 01:06:06,559
immune system so that our ebvs can come

1887
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:09,039
out of dormancy

1888
01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:10,319
they can get reactivated we can have

1889
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:12,240
more problems with their health we can

1890
01:06:10,319 --> 01:06:14,400
go backwards with their symptoms

1891
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:16,319
so it's not it's not i don't want you to

1892
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:18,240
not donate blood but i talk about maybe

1893
01:06:16,319 --> 01:06:19,599
a better way of doing it like preparing

1894
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:20,640
yourself taking care of yourself

1895
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:23,680
beforehand

1896
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:24,480
i also recommend uh more men donating

1897
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:26,319
blood because

1898
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,920
it's just women that donate blood and i

1899
01:06:26,319 --> 01:06:29,599
know that's a pretty

1900
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:31,039
bold statement that it's just women

1901
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:33,280
donating blood

1902
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:34,079
because there are men donating blood yes

1903
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:36,480
but there's

1904
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:38,000
mostly women and mostly women that don't

1905
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:40,799
feel good donate blood

1906
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:42,640
women that uh there's this small

1907
01:06:40,799 --> 01:06:44,240
percentage of women that feel healthy

1908
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:45,680
and strong and don't have any symptoms

1909
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:48,000
that ever donate blood

1910
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:49,200
they're just but but what's interesting

1911
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,520
is it's like

1912
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:52,480
women that are living with symptoms and

1913
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:54,240
not feeling good

1914
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:55,760
and dealing with issues of all kinds

1915
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:57,119
they're the ones donating blood for the

1916
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:58,240
most part they make up the majority of

1917
01:06:57,119 --> 01:06:59,680
the blood donations which is

1918
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:00,400
unbelievable when you think about it

1919
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:03,760
right

1920
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:06,720
and those are the people that

1921
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:08,000
that need their reserves and need their

1922
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:09,680
immune system strong

1923
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,440
and then they're the ones giving out all

1924
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:12,960
the blood and weakening themselves more

1925
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:14,480
and more

1926
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:16,799
that's scary all in its own when i

1927
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:18,400
really think about it but

1928
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:19,920
the bottom line is you can protect

1929
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:21,520
yourself before a blood donation you

1930
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:23,039
protect yourself after a blood donation

1931
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:23,680
so i talk about that in the medical mean

1932
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:25,599
podcast

1933
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:27,680
at apple podcast link is in the

1934
01:07:25,599 --> 01:07:29,760
description the blood draw episode right

1935
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:31,680
and you can learn more about it and i

1936
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:32,400
believe we need to donate blood yeah but

1937
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:34,480
but there's

1938
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:35,920
ways to do it especially if you have a

1939
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:37,599
symptom or you have a condition that's

1940
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:38,400
when i tell people you know don't do it

1941
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:40,559
for now

1942
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:42,079
don't donate blood now when you're sick

1943
01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:43,440
because then you lose your immune system

1944
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:45,760
through the blood donation they take a

1945
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:47,039
pint of blood they take a large part of

1946
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:49,119
your immune system and then you can go

1947
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:49,440
backwards and even get so sick you might

1948
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:51,039
be

1949
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:52,400
ending up needing a blood transfusion

1950
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:52,720
down the road because sickness gets you

1951
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:54,880
know

1952
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:56,319
it takes over so but listen to the

1953
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:58,160
podcast episode

1954
01:07:56,319 --> 01:08:00,400
for sure it's it's all important

1955
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:02,640
information

1956
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:04,559
janelle i never seen a man donating

1957
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:08,160
blood at the blood bank

1958
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:11,520
um no it's rare it's rare

1959
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:13,599
so the system has and i'll tell you one

1960
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:16,640
of the reasons why this is interesting

1961
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:19,199
the system has trained women to do it

1962
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:20,480
you know and now the system works like

1963
01:08:19,199 --> 01:08:22,799
the medical system

1964
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:24,080
trains women they want to train women

1965
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:26,880
like dogs

1966
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:27,279
like like dogs that's what they do and

1967
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:29,120
it's

1968
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:31,440
higher up it's not the doctors but it's

1969
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:32,719
higher up and they train women to give

1970
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:35,359
out all their blood

1971
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:37,520
that's what they do they train women who

1972
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:39,199
are sick to give out all their blood

1973
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:40,880
okay is there something wrong with that

1974
01:08:39,199 --> 01:08:42,239
don't you think like is there something

1975
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:45,120
wrong with that or what

1976
01:08:42,239 --> 01:08:46,799
and and then this is like this is

1977
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:50,000
unbelievable when i think about it

1978
01:08:46,799 --> 01:08:50,640
right um and so this is just some of

1979
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
this stuff

1980
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:53,839
anyway you got to hear the podcast

1981
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,480
medically and podcasted apple podcast

1982
01:08:53,839 --> 01:08:57,199
and you're right

1983
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:58,319
no there's there's it's ever it's rare

1984
01:08:57,199 --> 01:08:59,759
oh here's another thing

1985
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:01,440
it's rare you're going to see women

1986
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:02,000
donating blood at the blood donation

1987
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:04,719
clinic

1988
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,000
that are strong healthy with no symptoms

1989
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:07,279
how's that

1990
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,319
women that are just out there living

1991
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:11,359
their life don't even know what it's

1992
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:13,279
like to be sick never had a symptom yet

1993
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:15,040
they're not donating blood ever they're

1994
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:16,799
just like it's they're not

1995
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:18,719
thinking about it i don't know i think

1996
01:09:16,799 --> 01:09:22,000
but for some reason

1997
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:23,759
women that are not well and struggling

1998
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,279
they're like for some reason they're

1999
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:28,159
hurting them in like

2000
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:29,920
cattle or something to just or sheep to

2001
01:09:28,159 --> 01:09:30,640
just get in to just dump all their blood

2002
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:34,159
out

2003
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:35,920
it's the most bizarre thing um

2004
01:09:34,159 --> 01:09:38,000
clearly nature what do you do for chest

2005
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:40,319
tightness so chest tightness is an

2006
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,279
eptine epstein-barr shingle so these are

2007
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:44,480
viral

2008
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:47,440
symptoms vagus nerve gets inflamed and

2009
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:48,319
look ask your doctor what he or she

2010
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:50,319
thinks okay

2011
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:52,000
you take the book to your doctor right

2012
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:53,359
but if it was me and i had chest

2013
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:56,080
tightness that was

2014
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:57,440
uh mysterious to the doctor if it was me

2015
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:58,960
i'd be going through here

2016
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:01,440
i'd be looking at the epstein-barr

2017
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:03,440
protocol that's what i would be doing

2018
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:05,600
i would discover it's the vagus nerve

2019
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:07,360
being inflamed that's what i would do

2020
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:09,280
if it was happening to a family member i

2021
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:12,400
would look in here and i'd be like okay

2022
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:14,400
well i want my uncle on the micro sea

2023
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:15,920
that's what i want my uncle on i mean

2024
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:17,440
you do what you need to do and you you

2025
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:18,719
talk to your doctor and do what he tells

2026
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:21,120
you to do but i'm just saying

2027
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:21,760
that i would have my uncle on some lemon

2028
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:24,159
balm

2029
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:25,280
i'd be like you know that's what i would

2030
01:10:24,159 --> 01:10:27,360
do is

2031
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:28,960
it and i'd be looking in here you know

2032
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:30,560
and saying okay well my uncle needs to

2033
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:32,640
beyond lysine

2034
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:34,719
and i'm looking at the dosages in here

2035
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:38,159
and it says dosages

2036
01:10:34,719 --> 01:10:40,400
and well you know let me ask my doctor

2037
01:10:38,159 --> 01:10:42,640
you know sure but i would just say to my

2038
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:44,320
uncle here it is

2039
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:45,840
gina says i had a doctor recommended i

2040
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:48,880
donate to to

2041
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:51,920
rid iron overload

2042
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:54,000
um that's

2043
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:55,920
modern day bloodletting just like blood

2044
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,480
draws in general are they take so much

2045
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:57,840
blood

2046
01:10:56,480 --> 01:11:00,320
they don't need to take this much blood

2047
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:03,360
i mean i look i talked about this before

2048
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:04,960
um so that's all the blood they need

2049
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:06,560
just for an a1c you guys probably can't

2050
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:08,239
even see it i got a lot of lights on me

2051
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:10,640
right now you see that little dot

2052
01:11:08,239 --> 01:11:12,320
that's all they need for just an a1c

2053
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:12,960
that's all they need for just a blood

2054
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:14,239
test

2055
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:17,040
but when you're talking about high in

2056
01:11:14,239 --> 01:11:18,960
iron and being like being high in iron

2057
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:20,800
instead of science research learning how

2058
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:22,320
to fix the problem learning how to work

2059
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:24,159
with the liver the spleen

2060
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:25,679
and and the bones and the toxic heavy

2061
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:28,080
metals that are inside

2062
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:30,080
a woman's body that are causing that and

2063
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:31,360
the viral issues that are causing high

2064
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:34,880
iron instead of

2065
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:37,199
signs of research trying to discover why

2066
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:38,560
someone has high iron right instead of

2067
01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:40,560
them doing that

2068
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:42,239
they just do the bloodletting so they

2069
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:44,640
just say hey dump your blood

2070
01:11:42,239 --> 01:11:46,640
you know let's let's you know let's take

2071
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:48,239
out your blood let's draw blood from you

2072
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:50,239
so they draw blood or they tell you to

2073
01:11:48,239 --> 01:11:52,000
donate blood right

2074
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:53,840
and instead of them trying to find out

2075
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,440
what's going on and with medical medium

2076
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:57,440
books you'll find out it's it's

2077
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:59,760
it's the low-grade viral issues it's the

2078
01:11:57,440 --> 01:12:00,640
toxic heavy metals mercury is a really

2079
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:02,960
big one for

2080
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:04,640
why iron goes all over the place so

2081
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:06,159
these just information that's really

2082
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:07,440
helpful i made some noise you guys i'm

2083
01:12:06,159 --> 01:12:10,000
heading off soon to

2084
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:11,920
on average they draw two tubes cbc and

2085
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:15,600
cmp

2086
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:19,440
on average um no

2087
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:22,640
it's not on average um diana

2088
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:23,440
average seven tubes seven tubes for

2089
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:25,600
anything

2090
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:27,199
seven tubes everybody goes to get blood

2091
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,760
work no matter what blood test the

2092
01:12:27,199 --> 01:12:31,280
doctor

2093
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:33,040
orders seven tubes five tubes is way too

2094
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:36,159
much and five tubes they do

2095
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:39,679
it a lot of times five tubes go out

2096
01:12:36,159 --> 01:12:41,840
right yeah if they just want a complete

2097
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:42,640
blood count and you lock your doctor

2098
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:45,840
down on that

2099
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:48,880
cbc and you hold your doctor to it

2100
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:50,280
then yes they may take two tubes but

2101
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:53,600
that's not how it works

2102
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:55,360
99.9 of everybody goes

2103
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:56,800
to their doctor their doctor orders the

2104
01:12:55,360 --> 01:13:00,320
blood tests and five

2105
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:02,960
tubes minimum they get they take minimum

2106
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:04,320
no matter what seven tubes 14 tubes 10

2107
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:06,640
tubes and that's not when you

2108
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:08,000
if you're getting sick so say you're

2109
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:09,440
somebody and you've never had a symptom

2110
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,800
in your life and you're at a checkup at

2111
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:12,880
your doctor's office and they just want

2112
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:14,800
to look at your cbc

2113
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:16,880
yeah you might get that one doctor that

2114
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:20,400
says just takes two tubes

2115
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:21,920
but i'm sorry 99.9 percent of them will

2116
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:23,440
take five

2117
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:25,040
tubes and they'll be like oh we're gonna

2118
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:26,239
check your vitamin d2 we're gonna check

2119
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:29,440
this yeah you gotta

2120
01:13:26,239 --> 01:13:31,199
hold your doctor down you gotta hold

2121
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:33,600
your doctor down

2122
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:36,320
but yeah i mean and right now people are

2123
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:38,320
going backwards fast right now because

2124
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:39,840
of new medical treatment so i'm just

2125
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:40,960
gonna do a whistle are you guys okay

2126
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:43,440
with the whistle right now

2127
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:43,440
are you ready

2128
01:13:44,159 --> 01:13:52,080
new medical treatment

2129
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:52,080
making people go downhill fast

2130
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:56,400
real fast give it six months to eight

2131
01:13:54,719 --> 01:14:01,840
months to a year

2132
01:13:56,400 --> 01:14:01,840
people are gonna be a real sick

2133
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:07,040
giving everybody like a little heads up

2134
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:08,480
there and

2135
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:10,080
that's why this is probably the most

2136
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:13,679
important book of the

2137
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:14,000
century because we're heading to a very

2138
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:17,440
bad

2139
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:19,920
place with a lot of sick people

2140
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:22,239
and um and they're gonna need to know

2141
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:23,760
why the reactivated epson bar

2142
01:14:22,239 --> 01:14:26,320
is reactivating and they're going

2143
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:29,120
downhill fast so we have to make sure

2144
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:30,400
they get the information there i think

2145
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:31,280
some of you guys know what that whistle

2146
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:33,199
means

2147
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:34,320
i have a feeling i think probably a

2148
01:14:33,199 --> 01:14:35,520
bunch of you are like why is he

2149
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:38,719
whistling

2150
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:38,719
