2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:15,760
find out what's making you sick and how

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:18,359
to heal Anthony William is the medical

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,160
medium hello I'm Anthony William you're

5
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:22,119
listening to the medical medium radio

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,240
show where each week I talk about the

7
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:26,039
most advanced healing information and

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,720
secrets about health much of which is

9
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,800
not found anywhere else and is decades

10
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:34,000
ahead of what's out there now now what

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,800
we're talking about today is more than

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,239
decades ahead of what's out there now

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,840
and it's unfortunate because we're

14
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:44,320
talking about trigeminal neuralgia and

15
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,399
here we are in this day and age in what

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,640
year we're in with the technology we

17
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,879
have and the so-called science to the

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,480
degree we have and I'm not mocking

19
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,760
science to the point where hey we don't

20
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,039
have the best technology for for you

21
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,239
know computers and everything else and

22
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,399
everything else that meaning it could

23
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:00,039
get better I'm sure and better and

24
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,320
better each year as the years go on of

25
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:04,760
course and but I'm trying to say

26
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,920
something about chronic illness it's

27
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,680
disastrous absolutely disastrous

28
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:12,280
trigeminal neuralgia is a prime example

29
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,680
of how we're helpless in chronic illness

30
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,280
without the right answers and and as far

31
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,600
as science and research goes forget it

32
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:22,600
with trigeminal neuralgia it's just you

33
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:25,920
know just offering a drug um and boom

34
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:27,560
that's about it maybe two drugs uh maybe

35
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,759
some sleeping pills for people who are

36
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,600
suffering from it that's it no answers

37
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:34,520
to what it is what causes it what's

38
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,439
going on there there is there is some

39
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,079
information going around now that's just

40
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:39,640
seeping in the medical communities

41
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,640
because of my information in medical

42
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,720
medium book one about trigeminal

43
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,439
neuralgia and so we're going to explore

44
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:48,000
that today so we've been able to help

45
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,680
spirit and eye and it's been a it's been

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,439
a big deal when you think about it we've

47
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,960
been able to crack the case of course

48
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,600
because you know I've always had answers

49
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,680
for people suffering with trinal

50
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,479
neuralgia I always have and so it's time

51
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,159
the whole world knows because there's

52
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:03,680
that many people suffering it's that

53
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:06,399
devastating it could be mild versions to

54
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,399
to really serious versions it's it's

55
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,000
unbelievable unbelievable what people go

56
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,480
through if you got it if you're dealing

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,239
with trinal neuralgia you know what I'm

58
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:16,040
talking about and we're not going to

59
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,080
take it lightly okay we're not going to

60
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,959
I'm going to try to keep a sense of

61
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:23,959
humor the best I can today but I get I

62
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:25,840
get upset when I know where science and

63
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:28,319
research is with chronic illness in

64
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,959
certain areas and so I have tolerance

65
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,680
for certain areas that it's that that

66
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:32,720
they're just they're backwards in or

67
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,640
they're going the wrong direction

68
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,640
there's tolerance you know blaming

69
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,560
everything now on genes when that's

70
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,440
actually not the not the problem with

71
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,599
with autoimmune disease you know things

72
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:46,000
like that I I have tolerance for that to

73
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:47,519
some degree but when mostly women who

74
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
are suffering with trigeminal neuralgia

75
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:54,159
plenty of men too it's it's it's like a

76
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,920
torture a torture you just no one

77
00:02:54,159 --> 00:03:00,360
understands no one gets it unless

78
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:03,560
they've had it unless they've had it no

79
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:06,560
one understands the torture that

80
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,159
trigeminal neuralia puts people into and

81
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,440
what's torturous about it a couple a

82
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,879
couple of things not only the pain and

83
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,480
the agony we're going to discuss all the

84
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,959
symptoms about it too not only all that

85
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,080
but also not knowing what it is what's

86
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,640
causing it just guessing games out there

87
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,959
and no real answers no remedies and and

88
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,440
that's what makes it really difficult we

89
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,519
got remedies we got answers we got them

90
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,480
here at this show and there's a reason

91
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,560
why we got him in this show because this

92
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:32,120
is the only show the only show where the

93
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,239
information here isn't repackaged or

94
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,799
recycled Theory that's been going around

95
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,799
out there among the medical communities

96
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:40,920
both alternative and conventional

97
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:42,799
recycled repackaged garbage over and

98
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,799
over and over again scrambled like

99
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,720
scrambled eggs on the internet and in

100
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,239
books it's ridiculous it really is this

101
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,159
is the only Health show where the

102
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:52,560
information is not tampered with it

103
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:54,159
doesn't come from interest groups

104
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,239
medical funding with strings attached

105
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,120
botch research lobbyists medical

106
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,319
lobbyists internal Kickbacks persuaded

107
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,680
belief systems private panel of

108
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:04,439
influence ERS health field health field

109
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,000
payoffs and or trendy traps I'm going to

110
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:08,000
say that in front of every show because

111
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,439
first of all you need to know this

112
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,519
information is clean it is clean it's

113
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:16,400
how you can heal when you know it's

114
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,160
clean it's important to understand that

115
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,479
it's important to know thumb hasn't been

116
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,759
on the scale of any of this information

117
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:25,800
to persuade it if you knew how much

118
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:27,479
money is invested it's investors and did

119
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,840
you ever make an investment into

120
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:32,840
anything at all did you invest into

121
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:36,520
anything I mean the simplest thing did

122
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:40,000
you ever invest into a used car did you

123
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:42,320
ever invest into something at all when

124
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,199
you invest in something you buy a used

125
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:47,600
car okay you're in you're you're you're

126
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,240
invested you paid money for that you

127
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:54,000
paid $5,000 or whatever it is for that

128
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,600
used car and it matters to you what the

129
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,199
outcome of that car is going to be

130
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,280
through its duration how it's how you're

131
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,160
driving it and everything else it

132
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,720
matters matters and what happens in the

133
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,960
medical field and alternative arts and

134
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,880
heal in in the conventional Arts there's

135
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,639
Investments going into into Endeavors

136
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:13,000
medical Endeavors and it has to come out

137
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,960
a certain way or they will never invest

138
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,240
again in that area or the lab

139
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:20,919
technicians or the doctors will never

140
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,199
receive a penny again for all their

141
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:26,039
life's work if something doesn't come

142
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,520
out even partially in somebody's favor

143
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:28,479
this is how it's done in alternative and

144
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,720
conventional

145
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,919
medicine and this is why the information

146
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,479
is skewed wrong backwards going in a

147
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:36,080
backwards Direction in every way

148
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,680
possible and guess who suffers people

149
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,560
with trigeminal neuralgia and guess who

150
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,319
else was suffers people with hashimotos

151
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,360
thyroiditis wrote a book about that plus

152
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:45,720
a whole bunch of other things if you

153
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,319
haven't gotten a thyroid book yet I I

154
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,199
don't know what to say just please

155
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:51,240
please please get it because it's not

156
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,120
just the thyroid there's over a hundred

157
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:56,080
symptoms and conditions I explain what

158
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,720
causes them and I go into more than

159
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,600
anybody knows about the thyroid and

160
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,280
everything else information is never

161
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,120
ever even been heard before out there so

162
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,720
it's important um and I don't even talk

163
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,560
about half of what's in there a fraction

164
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:11,039
of what's in there on the radio so

165
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,520
that's something to think about so you

166
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,240
have to understand one thing in order to

167
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,599
have answers for something like trinal

168
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:20,080
neuralgia it can't be contaminated it

169
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:21,400
can't be contaminated by all the groups

170
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,599
I just mentioned that run alternative

171
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,520
and conventional medicine and the

172
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:27,720
citations and the studies from all that

173
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,520
alternative and conventional medicine is

174
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:32,800
all contaminated it's skewed and

175
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,520
contaminate I'm sorry to say it it just

176
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,440
is I have to be straightforward about

177
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,520
this of I'm not you're not going to know

178
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,919
where to go and you be swimming around

179
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,919
in the merry around something I wrote

180
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:44,360
about musical chairs in the merry ground

181
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,199
in the health field and that is not fun

182
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,759
at all all the information here comes

183
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:50,360
from a pure untampered Advanced Clean

184
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:51,919
Source a higher source I was given the

185
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,080
gift for and you know some people don't

186
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:57,000
like the fact I was given a gift at the

187
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,879
beginning when I was a child I I I hated

188
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,440
the gift because because it wasn't for

189
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:05,080
me it wasn't for me cuz every time I'd

190
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,720
be like wow I got a gift I'm you know

191
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,800
and spirit be like it's not this gift

192
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,120
isn't for you this gift is for everybody

193
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,599
else this gift is for people who have

194
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,680
trinal neuralgia this gift is for people

195
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:15,160
who are dealing with all kinds of

196
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,360
autoimmune diseases this people that are

197
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,680
dealing with all kinds of mystery

198
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,639
symptoms and conditions which is every

199
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,479
autoimmune disease as far as Medical

200
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:23,160
Science understands it's all mystery I

201
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:25,039
don't care if they name it I don't care

202
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,960
what they say about it it's a mystery to

203
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,400
them 100% they make you think it's not a

204
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,960
mystery so you feel things are under

205
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:35,199
control but that's not how works it's a

206
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:38,680
demented system I'm sorry but it is and

207
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:40,759
it's really sad and I was given the gift

208
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,840
and when when I was a child and you know

209
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:44,840
as I was growing up you know I couldn't

210
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,479
say oh great I got this gift it's is so

211
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:49,280
great spirit said no it's for everybody

212
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:52,879
else the gift is for everybody else but

213
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:55,039
it makes it makes people in the in the

214
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,680
places certain places in the world that

215
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,159
believe in certain belief systems in the

216
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,960
medical Arena whether it's science

217
00:07:58,159 --> 00:08:03,280
research whether it's alter medicine

218
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:05,319
whatever it is it makes them angry it

219
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,599
makes them really angry to know I got an

220
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:10,720
in on something no one else

221
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:13,520
has so they they just you know they lash

222
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,280
they lash out they lash out been dealing

223
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,360
it with my whole life especially now

224
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,919
because especially now at this day and

225
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,639
age now because there's so many people

226
00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:22,479
healing there's so many thousands of

227
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,319
healing people healing not just the

228
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:27,879
thousands I've healed in personal

229
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:30,319
oneon-one for 30 years plus okay worked

230
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:32,719
on more people worked on more people

231
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,399
youever go to the doctor's office and

232
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:37,680
there'd be like a crowd of people in the

233
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,760
waiting room okay I did that from 6:00

234
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,279
in the

235
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,519
morning and you know if I was lucky 700

236
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,480
in the morning it would start but it did

237
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:47,279
at 6:00 in the morning till midnight

238
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,399
with that crowd in the in those rooms

239
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:53,320
seven days a week I went three four five

240
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:56,440
six years without even Christmas off or

241
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:59,360
a half a day off not even Christmas Eve

242
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:01,680
off and that's what I did for years and

243
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,279
years and years and years I've helped

244
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,600
more people and anybody has who's had

245
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:08,800
the length of career that I've had and

246
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,480
I'm saying this so you know where I come

247
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,760
from and where I'm coming from in half

248
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,279
those years I did it for nothing until I

249
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:17,760
almost died from it because I couldn't

250
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:20,839
even buy food and I couldn't even pay my

251
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,120
rent and I couldn't even keep a car even

252
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:25,000
though I couldn't drive I always had

253
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:27,839
somebody drive for me because you know

254
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,640
I'd be doing readings on the highway be

255
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,040
getting readings all the time and I got

256
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,680
to be careful because if I'm if you know

257
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,079
if I'm driving and stuff I'm at a stop

258
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,200
light I'll get readings from somebody on

259
00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:38,360
the right side of me readings from

260
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,480
somebody on the left side of me spirit

261
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,640
will be telling me what's wrong with

262
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,079
anybody and in the old days I'd be

263
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:46,200
tempted to wave them down and say hey

264
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:48,040
look did you ever get this checked out I

265
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,320
don't do that anymore you can't do that

266
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:54,000
anymore you could do that in the old

267
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:56,640
days you couldn't do it now so the deal

268
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,040
is sorry about the long-winded beginning

269
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,360
we're going to get the trial neuralia

270
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:02,519
trust me and we're going to really cook

271
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:06,160
into it I I promise we're going

272
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:07,720
to but the point is is that yeah is is

273
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,600
when you're given a gift and you guys

274
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,279
got gifts I'm sure you do and I'm sure

275
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,440
somebody's been jealous about your gift

276
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,680
too because everybody has a gift of

277
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,680
their own but when it comes down to

278
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,720
chronic illness and science and research

279
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,079
is lack of understanding of it and

280
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,920
doctors that actually spend all this

281
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:24,320
money and they go to school and I love

282
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,360
all doctors but they go to school they

283
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,920
spend all this money and they're not

284
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,000
given what they need for medical school

285
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,200
both alternative and Convention

286
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,600
we're in a bad place we're in a bad

287
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,440
place and tri neurologist sufferers it's

288
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:39,320
a prime example I'm saying this because

289
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:42,079
if you only knew if you're someone who

290
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:45,200
hasn't dealt with it if you only knew

291
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:47,040
what it's like you could not imagine why

292
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,320
something's not being done about it in

293
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,079
the field of medicine you could only you

294
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,600
could just you can't even

295
00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:55,720
imagine so when someone can't sleep for

296
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,680
4 days in a row and they got to be

297
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,320
drugged to go to sleep because they have

298
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,959
pain on the side of their face on the

299
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,760
side of their head they got burning on

300
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:05,480
their tongue and burning on their mouth

301
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:07,680
they got they got shooting stabbing

302
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:10,880
knives going into their

303
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:13,200
ears and they can't sleep for 3 4 days

304
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:17,000
and they're they literally have to be

305
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:20,079
drugged if you only knew what that was

306
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,360
like and I hope you never do and then o

307
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:27,639
only and then you'd say why on God's

308
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:29,920
Earth on God's green earth why the heck

309
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:31,519
is something not being done about this

310
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,680
plus a whole bunch of other diseases and

311
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:37,279
illnesses and symptoms and mysterious

312
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:39,360
conditions how come and I say to Spirit

313
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,839
still every day I say to Spirit why am I

314
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,959
half why am I the one that has to

315
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:47,160
deliver

316
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:49,519
this why am I the one that has to do

317
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:51,680
this and like I said I've helped people

318
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,320
for decades and did it for free for

319
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,680
decades and decades and then I had to

320
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:57,399
eventually charge to some degree and

321
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,519
then I had to get some donations through

322
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:03,240
the years when you know and just to stay

323
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:05,680
alive to help people 3:00 in the morning

324
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:09,399
mommies would be bringing their babies

325
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:12,320
knocking on the door for answers I'd

326
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:14,720
never even slept for years and years and

327
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,680
been through hell and helped a lot of

328
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,399
people and doing it and now I just got

329
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,399
to help in different ways I got to do it

330
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:21,320
through the books and I got to do it

331
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,440
through this way and do it through the

332
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,800
show that's what we're doing we're going

333
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,240
to talk about trinal neuralgia we're

334
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,320
only a few minutes in so bear with me

335
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,639
it's just that some of these things you

336
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,440
know I woke up this morning and I said

337
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:33,040
people need to know they just need to

338
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,880
know what what someone goes through with

339
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:38,560
trial neuralgia and they need to know

340
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:40,160
how how fault faulty and how faulted and

341
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,560
how demented the system is both

342
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,079
alternative and conventional they need

343
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,320
to know that someone said to me hey

344
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,560
you're just all about attacking

345
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,680
conventional

346
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,920
medicine and and it was like it's not

347
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:53,800
about attacking anything I mean if you

348
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:56,399
don't stand up for what's wrong

349
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:58,000
sometimes and it's both alternative and

350
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,639
conventional I said to this person no

351
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,560
it's alternative

352
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:04,480
too it's alternative to if you don't

353
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,920
stand up to try to correct what's going

354
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,920
wrong then how are you going to help the

355
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,760
children of the children to come of the

356
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,680
children to come of the children to come

357
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,600
how are you going to help how are you

358
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:17,680
going to do it if you don't stand up if

359
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:19,880
you don't do something about it so hey

360
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:24,519
look let's go into uh let's go into the

361
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:26,120
trinal neuralgia let's go into that so

362
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:27,600
what does it feel like to begin with I

363
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,839
explained a little bit about it some

364
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,800
people can have just a tingling

365
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:34,040
sensation constantly on one side of the

366
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:37,320
face Maybe back of the head on the other

367
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:38,560
side of the face and just keeping mind a

368
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,959
lot of these symptoms I'm going to tell

369
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,760
you aren't even diagnosed as as trial

370
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:45,040
neuralgia they're not even diagnosed

371
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:47,240
that way like a doctor would even know

372
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:51,440
that's even what that is they'll be

373
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:53,360
looking for something else so um so and

374
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,160
you and not to mention what people go

375
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,839
through just trying to get a diagnosis

376
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,839
or they go through they get MRIs they

377
00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:01,360
get CAT scans they get they're seeing

378
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:05,120
you know 10 neurologists they seeing

379
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:07,440
Specialists it is no picnic man it is no

380
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,079
picnic it's brutal it's brutal I'm I'm

381
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,759
just letting you know and so you can

382
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,440
have these tingle Sensations on the side

383
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:16,720
of the head you can have a weakness on

384
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:19,000
the side of the head a weakness where

385
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,560
you're like weak on one side of the head

386
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,600
some doctors be like oh that's that's

387
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:25,079
multiple sclerosis I mean just it's just

388
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:27,240
a crapfest out there it's like the wild

389
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:29,839
west still with no understanding about

390
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:32,240
what's going on and what causes anything

391
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:35,839
oh man it just gets me going it gets me

392
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,920
going so so you can have a few different

393
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,360
things going on when you have the

394
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,639
sensations you could have a burning on

395
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,199
the side of the face you could have a

396
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,160
burning in the jaw you could have a

397
00:14:42,199 --> 00:14:45,680
burning on all your gums these are all

398
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,440
different sometimes people have more

399
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,680
than one symptom but there's all

400
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,240
different varieties you get the burning

401
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:53,680
in the in all in the gums all in the

402
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:56,920
gums you could burning on one side of

403
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,360
the gums okay one side you could have a

404
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,680
burning on the upper side you could have

405
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,360
a burning burning at the bottom side of

406
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,600
the gums you could have a burning all

407
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,880
through your mouth you could have the

408
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:11,000
burning on your tongue

409
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:13,399
only and you can have all that plus pain

410
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,040
you can have all that no pain you can

411
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:16,519
have just the weakness on one side of

412
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,519
the head you can have the tingles on one

413
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:23,320
side of the head you can have

414
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:25,199
devastating pain in the ear okay and the

415
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:27,360
okay and you can also have and some of

416
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:29,319
you might have this pains in the corners

417
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,880
at the bottom of the ears

418
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:33,639
so right at the bottom of the ears I got

419
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,680
my fingers not in my ears but I get the

420
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:37,319
fingers underneath my ears you know in

421
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,000
the neck and those little delicate

422
00:15:37,319 --> 00:15:40,560
Corners there where we can push in and

423
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,120
you feel your Jawbone the back of your

424
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:46,160
Jawbone we're talking pain all shooting

425
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:48,920
down in there and that's brutal I've

426
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:51,880
seen people suffer for years with that

427
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:55,839
kind of Agony you can also have pain on

428
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:57,959
the jaw where it's just a a a sharp pain

429
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,480
like a toothache pain a toothache pain

430
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:02,079
you can also have have not toothache

431
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:03,279
pains but and that okay that leads to a

432
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,720
whole another thing I can't tell you how

433
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:07,600
many people had their teeth drilled

434
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,560
pulled with trinal analia they've had I

435
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,959
mean dentists you know have tried to

436
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:14,160
remedy these situations have drilled

437
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:15,680
through teeth good teeth bad teeth

438
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,600
looking for answers you name it have

439
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,000
seen that too many of you probably gone

440
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,000
through that they don't do that as much

441
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,560
anymore a lot of the dentists are

442
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,199
finally catching you know wind a little

443
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,839
bit they're catching catching a little

444
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:28,759
bit of knowledge where okay this didn't

445
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:29,600
work I'm not going to do it to this

446
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:31,959
person

447
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,959
now you can have a sensitivity with all

448
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:37,279
the teeth where hot cold and then Den is

449
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:38,600
like well it's kind of like a it's that

450
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,759
you're just a highly sensitive person

451
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,680
with your teeth you know maybe your

452
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:44,720
enamels weakening no the nerves it's

453
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:47,279
trial neuralgia it's just a different

454
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,959
variety and different kind a different

455
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:52,480
variety and different kind of trigeminal

456
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:53,880
neuralgia all right and so you can you

457
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,480
know so there's so many different it

458
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:59,519
could hit the eyes transanal neuralgia

459
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,519
can take out an eye hurt the eye make it

460
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,400
go you can't even open you're squinty

461
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:06,640
you can't even look through

462
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:08,720
it it's it's it's like that it's like

463
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:12,640
that it's like

464
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:14,319
that and you know I mean it go it just

465
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,400
just it goes to all kinds of different

466
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:18,760
levels all kinds of different levels

467
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,000
okay but here's the bottom line you have

468
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:24,959
to understand something with trigeminal

469
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:29,000
neuralgia it's it moves too it moves it

470
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:31,440
creeps it creeps that's a creeper

471
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,880
okay it could start out small get worse

472
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,640
worse worse worse it can start out

473
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,840
really bad then go down to like a

474
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,480
minimum kind of thing where you're

475
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,160
living with it living with it living

476
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:44,440
with it and then creep back up again it

477
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,120
could get triggered easy too easily

478
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:48,080
triggered with just aggravation an

479
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:51,120
argument with somebody

480
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:54,160
confrontation with someone can trigger

481
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:58,200
it and make it just spiral through the

482
00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:00,000
damn roof nobody knows that nobody knows

483
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,919
that they don't only the people that

484
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,360
suffer nobody knows that I don't even

485
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:07,960
think anybody even is even can register

486
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,520
that one you're you're going along okay

487
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,960
you got the triam neuraly you got the

488
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,240
nerve pain and you got you know whether

489
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,400
it's a side of the face or any of the

490
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,720
symptoms I just said and you're going

491
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,559
along and all of a sudden you got to

492
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,640
talk to somebody that's just they're

493
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:20,840
just

494
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,000
annoying they're annoying because

495
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,720
they're causing confrontation on purpose

496
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,360
or they're just it's somebody maybe it's

497
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,679
a family member that just has a bone to

498
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:32,320
pick with you in that moment maybe maybe

499
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:34,840
it's somebody at work and oh my God it

500
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:37,280
can just it can just literally pronounce

501
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:42,720
and bring out the worst of that Tri

502
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:42,720
germinal neuralgia within minutes within

503
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:49,400
minutes yeah I know I know it's

504
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:52,520
unbelievable and and it it's hard on

505
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:55,919
people it's hard on people I said I know

506
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:58,760
because Spirit was um tuning into to

507
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:01,320
somebody actually in the audience um

508
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:03,320
actually talking that second saying how

509
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:05,320
that's awful and how bad that is and and

510
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:09,280
and oh my God and everything and yeah I

511
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:12,679
know I know it's that bad um here's the

512
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,360
deal it it it not only creeps and moves

513
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:16,520
but it can get into like I said the eye

514
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,960
area it can get into the head it can get

515
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,360
in the side of the head it can go up to

516
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,280
the top of the head it can go to the

517
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,360
bottom of the head and here's the

518
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:24,480
problem with trigeminal neur neuralgia

519
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:27,799
it can run down the

520
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:30,919
shoulder it can run down the neck it can

521
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:34,960
run down the shoulder and

522
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:37,039
neck it can even run down the chest how

523
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,440
can it run down the chest because I'm

524
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,320
going to tell you why because when I

525
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,840
tell you what causes trigal neuralgia

526
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,080
when I tell you what causes it and how

527
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:47,120
that affects other nerves in the body

528
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:49,120
like your Vegas nerve that's the first

529
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,480
time I I mean the F first time I brought

530
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,880
the whole Vegas thing to the world

531
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,720
through the books through medical medium

532
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,320
book

533
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,760
one and um teaching people about the

534
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:59,840
Vagas nerve and how it gets affected by

535
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,280
viral issues you get where we're going

536
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,440
by viral

537
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,720
issues okay cuz we're going somewhere

538
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,320
with that we're heading somewhere with

539
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,080
the viral

540
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:11,960
issues so the tri the trial neuralgia

541
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:14,320
can reach the vagus nerve the frenic

542
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,640
nerves frenic nerves are the nerves that

543
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,880
run on each side of the chest and they

544
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,640
run through your chest and they go up

545
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,760
through your neck into your head the

546
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:24,720
sides of the heads they connect sides of

547
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:27,360
your head they connect to the trigeminal

548
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,039
nerves eventually find their way with

549
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,919
tiny nerve endings connecting into the

550
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:33,039
trigeminal

551
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:34,360
nerves and these frenic nerves run

552
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,840
through the chest and they can tighten

553
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:39,559
the chest they can cause problems in the

554
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:42,360
chest they can cause problems in the

555
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:44,640
shoulders they can cause problems in the

556
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,760
neck and they get in next thing you know

557
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,720
it you got somebody with the worst

558
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:50,000
trigeminal neuralgia that's getting into

559
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:51,880
other places like frenic nerve issues

560
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,919
vagus nerve issues and it's getting all

561
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:56,000
wound into all those

562
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:59,760
areas

563
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,640
right right I mean some of you I know go

564
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,280
through that there's no question there's

565
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:06,039
no doubt about

566
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:08,240
it and what does it do it keeps you at

567
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:10,480
home it makes it so you can't work some

568
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,520
people work with it on drugs some people

569
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,279
the drugs don't touch it on any level

570
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:19,200
and they just you know they're they're

571
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:20,440
they're just living with it every day

572
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,240
with no

573
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:25,159
answers what we got answers we got

574
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:27,159
answers today I'm excited about this we

575
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:29,159
got answers today so I just want to make

576
00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:31,039
sure I cover every symptom the trinal

577
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:32,760
neuralia can cause I mean it can get the

578
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,840
roof of somebody's mouth I've seen that

579
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:36,799
before it can get the roof it can get

580
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:39,600
the back of the tongue it can get the

581
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:41,400
back of the mullers in the jaw the back

582
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,840
of the jaw and the mullers sometimes

583
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,919
then somebody will say well that's just

584
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,480
you know that's just your mandal you

585
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:48,799
know your your your mandolin joint

586
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,159
that's just the mandible joint that's

587
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:53,880
just your mandible joint and there's

588
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:56,400
going to be like that and um um yeah

589
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:58,520
don't get that confused with with with a

590
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,080
little fruit the Mandarin orang little

591
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:03,000
fruit I said but it's the man yeah the

592
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,080
mandible joint there okay so they get

593
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,320
confused with that they say well your

594
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,120
joint's messed up you know you got this

595
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,000
joint and they're now sizing you up you

596
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,799
got the tri ginal neuralgia but they're

597
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,279
sizing up with all the gear all the

598
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:14,720
mouth gear they're trying to correct

599
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:15,919
your jawline they're trying to correct

600
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,919
everything you're trying to correct your

601
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:19,520
bite they got all this going on I've

602
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,240
seen people go through hell with all

603
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,960
that and still not fix it because what

604
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:25,559
they had was something else which was

605
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,600
viral and nobody knows it's viral they

606
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:30,080
starting to know now because I put it

607
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,880
out there there if you hear it out there

608
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,960
you're going to get it from thieves

609
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:36,640
that's stealing the night what I say by

610
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:39,120
that is it because they won't cite where

611
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,400
they got it from and they got it from me

612
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,760
it's important to cite where you get it

613
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:46,120
from when you have truthful information

614
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,799
like this in all the shows and all the

615
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:49,520
books it's important to cite it some

616
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:51,279
people do some people don't but it's

617
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,279
important it's done I'll tell you why so

618
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:55,320
the person who's getting help can get to

619
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:56,760
the source of where all the answers are

620
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,120
for these problems and not get it

621
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:00,320
confused with a mixed bag in nuts now

622
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,240
because someone's got a bunch of other

623
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,799
belief systems that has no idea about

624
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:07,159
how drinal NRA works but they're

625
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,640
starting to get wind of it they're

626
00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:11,400
starting to get wind of

627
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,679
it and they're starting to sense it's

628
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:15,559
viral some doctors are being like I

629
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,840
think this is

630
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:19,159
viral and it is viral and we're going to

631
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,400
cover which virus and we're going to go

632
00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:23,039
into it deep in the whole bit we're

633
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,840
going to do that now so let's cover into

634
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,840
that so what causes trigeminal neuralgia

635
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:29,960
it's a virus it's from the herpetic

636
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:32,360
family it's the only family that can

637
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:35,600
cause trigeminal neuralgia that can

638
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:39,440
affect a trigeminal nerve and can affect

639
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:41,760
Vagas nerves and can in in affect frenic

640
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:44,080
nerves and can cause the problems I'm

641
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,600
talking about it's the herpetic family

642
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,000
and only the herpetic family and guess

643
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,880
what science and research doesn't even

644
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,600
know any of that it's so important to

645
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,720
know because if you're a new listener

646
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,080
too you're going to be like well where's

647
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,080
he getting the information the internet

648
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:59,440
no never ever and any book I've ever

649
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:01,720
written so far you guys any book I've

650
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,279
ever written and I just finished one

651
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:06,120
that's going to come out later this year

652
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:08,120
any book I've ever written there's not

653
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:10,159
one word out of that book that comes

654
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:13,000
from an internet or another source it's

655
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:15,480
just from Spirit alone and spirit alone

656
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,400
only these medical books are written

657
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:19,799
from hearing Spirit speak and that's

658
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,000
what these these medical books are

659
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:24,039
written how they're

660
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
written and that's why we have anwers

661
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:28,559
for trial neuralia let me tell you some

662
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,279
of the flaws about also about the

663
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:33,360
industry with with not understanding

664
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:35,399
something about the herpetic family the

665
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:38,440
herpetic viruses the herpetic viruses

666
00:24:35,399 --> 00:24:40,679
are the ones that actually flare up

667
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:43,840
nerves they're also the ones responsible

668
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:45,360
for lime now if you're if you're angry

669
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,399
about what I just said because you're

670
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,320
saying how can that be bacteria whatever

671
00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:51,679
you don't even know the history of how

672
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:53,240
it really went from the beginning to

673
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,760
where it went where they decided to call

674
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:57,480
it bacteria the reason why they called

675
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:59,279
it bacteria the reason why they did that

676
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,720
because because it sold the treatment it

677
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:04,159
sold the antibiotics because when it was

678
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:05,919
diagnosed as viral back in 1973 Lyme

679
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:09,080
disease was diagnosed as viral back in

680
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:11,960
1972 and 3 when a whole bunch of the

681
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:14,799
best doctors knew it was viral 100%

682
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:17,039
there was no treatment so then nobody

683
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:20,120
could make any money it was called a

684
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:21,600
dead duck a dead duck illness that's

685
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:24,799
what it was called because there wasn't

686
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:28,320
a penny to be made off lime disease so

687
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:31,080
back the late 70s came early 80s someone

688
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:33,159
had to make the bucks so they they

689
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:34,960
called it bacterial for a reason because

690
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:38,440
the amount of antibiotics that have been

691
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:41,000
sold and used for Lyme disease is

692
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:44,200
unbelievably astronomic you could not

693
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,159
believe the multi multi multi

694
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:48,360
multi-billions almost touching a

695
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:51,880
trillion pretty soon on the antibiotic

696
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:54,279
sales for lime it was the Cash Cow and

697
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:56,120
it's still kept that way purposely the

698
00:25:54,279 --> 00:25:59,640
industry still keeps it that

699
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:01,480
way okay but even lime is viral I'm

700
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:03,520
sorry to say that if you're totally

701
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:06,440
angry about this right now go to go to

702
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:09,760
book one and read my lime chapter listen

703
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:11,640
to the lime show that I also have okay

704
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,640
I'm not saying bacteria aren't present

705
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,320
I'm not saying there isn't any bacteria

706
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:17,480
I'm not saying any of that I'm just

707
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:20,279
saying it's the herpetic family that

708
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:21,960
causes neurological problems please

709
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:24,360
understand that if you want any help and

710
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:26,159
you want to help your family and if you

711
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:28,399
knew how many people were wasted with

712
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:31,000
Lyme disease over the last 30 5 years

713
00:26:28,399 --> 00:26:32,799
their lives ruined wasted or killed off

714
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,840
themselves because of antibiotics and

715
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,880
the unknowing of the fact that it was

716
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,600
viral you wouldn't believe the disaster

717
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,440
and the wake and the hell that people

718
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:42,840
went through and the families that were

719
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:46,120
literally ruined dissembled just

720
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:48,000
destroyed over not understanding lime

721
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:50,919
was viral instead believing it was

722
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,279
bacterial greatest disaster in human

723
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:54,840
history and chronic medicine is that

724
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,720
alone but guess what the people that

725
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:59,240
came to me over the last 35 years all

726
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,039
got better with lme because it was viral

727
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:02,279
and spirit knew what to do and they live

728
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:04,159
their lives and they're happy and

729
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:05,720
they're still healthy now and that's the

730
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:07,360
difference and that's why with trial

731
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,480
neuralgia we have to think the same way

732
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,720
and do the same thing because when we

733
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,000
know what's wrong with it we have to

734
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,600
know what to do to heal and get it

735
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,559
better and move it forward and that's

736
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:17,840
the key and that's how you do it trinal

737
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:20,000
neuralgia is herpetic family viral

738
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:23,200
that's what it is it's the only virus

739
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,320
that creates treal neuralgia the Family

740
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,960
itself herpetic family it hits nerves

741
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,279
like frenic and Vegas nerves I said that

742
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,760
already but it's important to hear it

743
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:31,640
again because it can go right over a lot

744
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:34,039
of people's heads some people say you

745
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,320
repeat yourself and then some people

746
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:37,240
said well I didn't understand what you

747
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:40,080
said I needed you to say it again I

748
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:42,320
can't win I can't win but I try to

749
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,760
repeat myself where I can't important

750
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,080
places like this this is really

751
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,880
important so how does it work what virus

752
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,080
is it what virus in the herpetic family

753
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:53,640
it's the shingles virus 100% the

754
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:55,799
shingles virus now I don't have a lot of

755
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:58,240
faith in research and Science and

756
00:27:55,799 --> 00:28:00,799
chronic illness I I'll give you an

757
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,399
example research and science still says

758
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:04,360
out there and they teach all the doctors

759
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:05,600
this backwards wrong information they

760
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:08,720
teach the

761
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:11,000
doctors that the chickenpox is the

762
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,120
shingles so if you had the chickenpox

763
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,720
you got the shingles down the road

764
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,840
they're two different

765
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,279
viruses two different completely

766
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:22,480
different

767
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:24,919
viruses so just to think about that

768
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,519
blunder that serious medical blunder all

769
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:29,480
in its own think about that one right

770
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:32,799
there then where are we really

771
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:34,200
going that blunder is so big and it's

772
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:37,399
not being

773
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:40,760
corrected okay the chickenpox virus is

774
00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:44,039
one virus in the herpetic family it's

775
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:46,960
one out of hundreds and hundreds the

776
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:49,960
shingles is entirely different virus in

777
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:53,679
the herpetic family and in the shingles

778
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:55,559
group itself there are over 31 varieties

779
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:57,640
that I've been able to document with

780
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:59,840
spirit and help people heal over the

781
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:02,440
decades and one of those shingles

782
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:08,399
varieties one of those varieties causes

783
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:08,399
trigeminal neuralgia it causes the

784
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:13,080
problem and so here's how it goes you

785
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:15,519
don't have to have a breakout of

786
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:17,519
shingles in order to have trial

787
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:19,720
neuralgia you could have had a breakout

788
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:21,960
in shingles years ago didn't know little

789
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:24,480
patch on your leg maybe a little patch

790
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:26,640
on the arm maybe a little patch on the

791
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,880
breast maybe a little patch on the neck

792
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,880
maybe a little patch behind the ear

793
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,840
maybe a little patch on your back you

794
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,799
could had

795
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:37,799
that but most people will try geminal

796
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:39,679
neuralgia don't really get the shingles

797
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:42,480
breakout some a lot of people do some

798
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:45,880
people don't many most people

799
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:49,559
don't but it's a shingles virus that

800
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:51,760
actually gets to the nerves it's a non

801
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:54,120
rashing shingles virus that tends to

802
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:56,360
rash sometimes but I call it non-

803
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:58,720
rashing because it's not the big rashers

804
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:01,240
it's not the typical variety I talk

805
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,320
about in medical medium book one with

806
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:06,039
shingles itself where you get the herpes

807
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:08,320
zou ripping across your your side

808
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:10,559
ripping across your lower belly ripping

809
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:13,039
across your back or your your butt

810
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:15,360
ripping across there there different

811
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:17,880
varieties of shingles trino neuralgia is

812
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,919
a whole different variety research and

813
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:21,679
science doesn't even know about the

814
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:24,240
different varieties of shingles we're

815
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:29,440
not even there yet we're so not even

816
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:31,840
there yet 50 years 60 I'll dead gone you

817
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:37,080
know whatever and they're still not

818
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:41,120
going to know and maybe maybe somehow um

819
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:44,559
you know God God willing God loving God

820
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:46,360
knowing that the information spreads

821
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:48,840
that we're putting out there and

822
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:51,880
something gets done about it you know I

823
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:54,559
hope to God but anyway the bottom line

824
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:56,200
is with the trial neuralia VAR variety

825
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:58,679
of virus the shingles variety that

826
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,960
causes that when you know what's wrong

827
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:03,000
and you know what it is and you know

828
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:05,960
what kind of virus it is then you can go

829
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:09,399
after it then you can go after it it's

830
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:13,799
not the same virus that causes Bell's

831
00:31:09,399 --> 00:31:15,440
paly Bell's paly where the droop happens

832
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:17,039
whether the droop in the eye the droop

833
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,000
that's a shingles virus too but it's one

834
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:20,440
of the 31 varieties it's a different

835
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,480
varieties of shingles it's a different

836
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,559
variety of

837
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,840
shingles some people can have the bells

838
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:26,440
paly variety and they could have

839
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:28,200
trigeminal neuralia variety you can have

840
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:30,360
two some people people have the the

841
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,919
straight herpes Zer variety where that

842
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,760
just rips across their back and their

843
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:35,880
stomach and then they get trigeminal Nur

844
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,440
neuralgia also which is a different

845
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,720
variety because we can have multiple

846
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:42,880
varieties of shingles in our body we get

847
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:46,360
a multiple we can catch a variety of

848
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:48,480
shingles we can catch a variety of

849
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:50,279
shingles you know I was just I was

850
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,559
talking about how you know I'm always

851
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:54,399
I'm always yeah I'm paranoid about

852
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:56,159
catching things so be only because

853
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:58,559
Spirit has tortured me by telling me

854
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:01,039
about the tuberculosis on a plane seat

855
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:03,760
or the Mera on a plane seat or you know

856
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:06,159
whatever so I've always always I've

857
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:08,120
always been you know because it's there

858
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:10,519
and spirit knows it's there so I've

859
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:12,679
gotten really weird about stuff so when

860
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:14,960
I grab door handles in public places I

861
00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:17,399
take my pinky and I go underneath and I

862
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:20,240
grab it I know I talked about that

863
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:22,559
before but because yeah I don't want a

864
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:27,200
variety of Jingles that I don't

865
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:29,519
need right now I don't because I'm my

866
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:32,000
forget touch something in a certain way

867
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:33,760
and stick it in my eye rub my eye cuz

868
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,039
I'm tired all the time because I stay up

869
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,360
late writing the books with Spirit

870
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:39,720
sometimes when spirit's on a roll we

871
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:41,799
don't stop I don't care if that takes 30

872
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:44,039
hours straight of information coming

873
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:46,919
from Spirit I got to write down and

874
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:49,480
write down word for word with a pen and

875
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:52,320
a pencil here's the

876
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:53,799
deal so let's work on getting it better

877
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,000
and figure out how to get it better for

878
00:32:53,799 --> 00:32:57,120
everybody everybody's going to have a

879
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,559
different situation some shingles

880
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:01,120
viruses are going to be rooted in pretty

881
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:02,200
deep they're there a long time some

882
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,039
people have been through a lot of

883
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:06,320
standard Medical Treatments you know

884
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,720
been through the steroids been through

885
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,320
the different drugs and everything else

886
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:11,960
and they've gone through a lot so that

887
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,919
doesn't help the situation um that fills

888
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:16,559
the liver with a lot of medication so

889
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:18,600
and the shingles is M the shingles its

890
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:20,159
main home is the liver to start with so

891
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,519
it camps out there that's where it

892
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:23,360
starts that's where it grows that's

893
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,840
where it does its thing then it launches

894
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:27,760
off and gets to different areas of the

895
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:29,240
body and so some people have a track

896
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,000
record of a lot of medications they have

897
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,399
a track record of immune system not

898
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,600
doing good because of it all they got a

899
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:35,039
track record of a lot of other

900
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,519
situations involved so it takes a little

901
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:40,279
time to

902
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:43,200
heal some people it heals fast just a

903
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:46,200
few weeks some people it takes a couple

904
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,440
of years of being strong and diligent on

905
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:51,960
what you need to do and you can't lose

906
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:55,679
sight of what it is you lose sight of

907
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:58,559
what it is then you don't get better

908
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:00,600
because you got to know what it is I say

909
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:02,960
it every time I'm going to say it again

910
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:06,080
half the battle is knowing what's wrong

911
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:10,679
the other half is doing what's

912
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:12,159
right for it that's how you heal that is

913
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:15,800
how you

914
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:18,480
heal and so you just have to know that

915
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:20,560
it's so important and so what's the

916
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,440
first half it's knowing what is it's a

917
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,960
virus it's the hepatic virus it's in the

918
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:26,639
shingles family it's one of the

919
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:28,119
varieties of shingles out of the 31 that

920
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,599
caused the flare up can I tell you what

921
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:30,960
happens when you know the truth can I

922
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:33,000
tell you what happens your immune system

923
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:35,000
gets aligned because when there's

924
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,200
confusion in your brain and doubt and

925
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,720
confusion and and and mystery in your

926
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,359
brain and you've been through hell and

927
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,399
you've gone to 10 neurologists and

928
00:34:40,359 --> 00:34:43,879
nobody knows what's going on with you

929
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:45,560
guess what your immune system doesn't

930
00:34:43,879 --> 00:34:47,079
line up to what's really happening so

931
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:48,520
it's hard to figure out how to fix it

932
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:50,000
and you get into a jam and then you get

933
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:53,520
stuck that's how it

934
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,280
works but when you know you know I hope

935
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:57,800
you got all that I hope you guys got all

936
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,599
that when you know what what's causing

937
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:01,079
it your immune system kicks up a notch

938
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:03,320
because guess what messages get to your

939
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:04,920
immune system they get to your immune

940
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:07,400
system that you're in it now you're in

941
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:10,119
it you're in it to win it you actually

942
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:11,920
know the culprit you know the Invader

943
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:13,160
it's not autoimmune it's not your body

944
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,680
attacking itself that's what they're

945
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:17,040
going to say about trinal neuralgia

946
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:19,520
pretty soon they probably already do

947
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:21,000
they probably already do they already

948
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,680
say you know

949
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,920
it's it's the body attacking itself cuz

950
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,119
that's all they got that's all they got

951
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:28,000
in their bag we're this far along that's

952
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,560
all they

953
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,760
got you know and and and you know and I

954
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:36,040
believe it's on purpose just call me

955
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,839
call me a little you know funny about

956
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:39,960
that but I believe it's on purpose

957
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:41,760
because come on how can we be here this

958
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:43,359
day and age and have no answers for

959
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,599
autoimmune disease all in of the

960
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:47,720
hundreds and hundreds of autoimmune

961
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:50,200
diseases we got no answers for any of it

962
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:52,599
so you know so here here's the

963
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,880
deal here's the deal so let's let's get

964
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:55,240
into this and figure this out we're

965
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,839
going to go after the virus once your

966
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,280
mind knows you're going after the virus

967
00:35:56,839 --> 00:35:59,760
that's one big piece of it then we're

968
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:01,160
going to go after it we're going to use

969
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,359
things to go after it we're going to get

970
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,040
you on the right things you can go to

971
00:36:02,359 --> 00:36:04,960
your practitioner and say here here's

972
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:07,960
what I

973
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,400
heard here's what I heard I can take

974
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,720
this or do this and this and this is a

975
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,640
shingles virus and your practitioner

976
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:15,920
you'll find a practitioner that'll be on

977
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:17,359
board on board listen if you have a

978
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,640
doctor and you really like that doctor

979
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:19,760
and that doctor is a great doctor but

980
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,560
your doctor doesn't want to know

981
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,160
anything to do with this this shingles

982
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:26,440
virus and trigeminal neuralgia keep your

983
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:28,040
doctor keep on going because you know

984
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:29,560
because I'm sure he or she is really

985
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:31,200
helpful with all kinds of things but

986
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:33,280
make sure you go find another one too

987
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,319
and get another one and have two get one

988
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,480
that will understand and listen to

989
00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:39,040
you get one that will understand and

990
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,680
listen to you so you can get better and

991
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,640
then tell that one look this is what

992
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:44,359
I've heard this is what I know this is

993
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:46,319
what's going on this is what you know I

994
00:36:44,359 --> 00:36:48,040
need to do just help me with this you

995
00:36:46,319 --> 00:36:48,880
can do that if you if you don't like

996
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:51,599
being

997
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:53,880
alone and doing

998
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:55,839
things so what do we need to do we need

999
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:57,839
to kill off the virus knock its Army

1000
00:36:55,839 --> 00:37:00,040
down what your feeling with all the pain

1001
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:02,599
and everything else is a neurotoxin a

1002
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:05,119
neurotoxin it's a virus the shingles

1003
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:07,319
virus eating a food it likes and then

1004
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:10,000
when it eliminates it eliminates a toxic

1005
00:37:07,319 --> 00:37:11,720
poison I talk about in thyroid

1006
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,319
healing but I was talking about the

1007
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:18,240
Epstein bar because all herpetic viruses

1008
00:37:14,319 --> 00:37:20,079
leech they they they they eliminate a

1009
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,560
neurotoxin and they cause different

1010
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:23,160
symptoms different neurological

1011
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:25,280
conditions each each herpetic virus

1012
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:28,119
causes different neurological conditions

1013
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,599
the shingles herp virus causes one of

1014
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:30,960
the varieties causes the trinal

1015
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:32,359
neuralgia you're dealing with and when

1016
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:35,200
it releases this

1017
00:37:32,359 --> 00:37:38,359
neurotoxin into the bloodstream the

1018
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:39,560
neurotoxin goes to adjacent areas where

1019
00:37:38,359 --> 00:37:42,160
nerves

1020
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:44,280
are and the trigeminal neuralgia

1021
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:46,319
shingles virus leaves the liver it likes

1022
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:48,119
to go up into the jaw it likes to go up

1023
00:37:46,319 --> 00:37:50,240
into the dral nerves it likes to go into

1024
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:51,599
even the frenic and and and vas nerve

1025
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,640
sometimes up in those areas and it likes

1026
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:56,800
to get into the neck and other areas and

1027
00:37:53,640 --> 00:38:00,040
it then pees and poos it pees and and

1028
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:03,720
poos when it pees and poos it's peeing

1029
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:05,400
and pooing neurotoxins those neurotoxins

1030
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:10,839
are

1031
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:10,839
extremely allergenic to a

1032
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:15,079
nerve extremely

1033
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,920
allergenic and then if you've had an

1034
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:18,839
injury with the jaw or an injury with

1035
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:21,400
any of those nerves or if a dentist

1036
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:23,400
jammed a needle in and it it it it it

1037
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:25,800
really poked hard it went in some

1038
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:27,599
cockeyed way right in that jaw when

1039
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:29,760
you're getting d to work then if the

1040
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:31,839
shingles virus is present in that moment

1041
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:34,280
or kicking around it will find that

1042
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:37,560
little wound and go to it and then

1043
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:38,880
settle in nest in and start working its

1044
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:41,720
way in the nerves and releasing more

1045
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:45,000
neurotoxins flaring up the

1046
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:48,400
nerves this is what the virus

1047
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,280
does this is what it does Spirit has

1048
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:54,000
advanced information doesn't

1049
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:57,680
Spirit yeah for sure yeah I was telling

1050
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:01,160
people this when I was a kid and people

1051
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:02,440
their heads would spin all right so

1052
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:04,640
listen here's the

1053
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:06,160
deal we're going to go after the virus

1054
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,280
let's talk about what we can use to go

1055
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,720
after the virus so you're going to be

1056
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,079
slowly killing off the virus it's going

1057
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,640
to take time some people have more

1058
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:14,000
levels of the shiggles virus than them

1059
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:16,000
causing more pain some people have less

1060
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,760
levels some people have been through a

1061
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,960
lot some people have have like I said

1062
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:23,560
they got a lot of toxins in them and the

1063
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:25,760
food they're eating is feeding the virus

1064
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:27,400
okay so eggs I talk about that all the

1065
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,200
time how come I don't like eggs because

1066
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:31,119
they feed the shingles virus they feed

1067
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,040
every single bug in the body you don't

1068
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:35,680
want in the body especially the herpetic

1069
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:37,040
family get away get away from the dairy

1070
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,440
course the

1071
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:41,640
gluten you know what happens with people

1072
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,119
and experts in the field of autoimmune

1073
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,400
or in the field of alternative medicine

1074
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:45,880
and the book writers and all the other

1075
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,560
stuff that put the books out and they

1076
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:49,480
talk about gluten and they don't

1077
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:50,960
understand that your body's not

1078
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,839
attacking itself because you're eating

1079
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,960
gluten you got a virus that's feeding

1080
00:39:52,839 --> 00:39:56,599
off of gluten and then causing problems

1081
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,040
the virus is causing problems we're not

1082
00:39:56,599 --> 00:39:59,720
even there yet with the latest

1083
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:01,319
alternative experts that are on the

1084
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:03,359
doctor shows and they're doing whatever

1085
00:40:01,319 --> 00:40:06,160
they don't even have a clue that that's

1086
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:07,720
how it works to this point it's actually

1087
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:11,640
embarrassing at this

1088
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:12,960
point I just I just we're so far behind

1089
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:14,520
so what happens is when you're eating

1090
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,720
that gluten you're feeding the shingles

1091
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:18,680
virus and it's going to be eliminating

1092
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:20,520
more neurotoxins if you have a lot of

1093
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,960
heavy metals in your system if you have

1094
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:23,280
heavy metals in your jaw from dental

1095
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:25,359
work from years ago if you have all

1096
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,800
these things it can become food too so

1097
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:28,680
you want to be on the heavy metal detox

1098
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:33,480
smoothie so the medical medium heavy

1099
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:36,079
metal detox smoothie I don't trust any

1100
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:39,800
other heavy metal

1101
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:42,839
detoxification treatment on the planet

1102
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:45,599
except for Spirits the heavy metal detox

1103
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:46,960
smoothie I don't trust a single one of

1104
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:49,680
them first of all

1105
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:51,000
Corella which is which is supposedly

1106
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:53,960
supposed to be heral that is God for

1107
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:56,720
removing heavy metals it drops them

1108
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:59,960
nonstop it can't hold on to to heavy

1109
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:02,520
metals it if it even remotely

1110
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:06,160
removes some heavy metal it'll drop it

1111
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:09,119
in the wrongest place after it's grabbed

1112
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:10,720
it so I mean that alone other heavy

1113
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:13,760
metal treatments I don't trust any of

1114
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:16,200
them I'm sorry I only like the one I

1115
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:20,280
have because that one I trust because

1116
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:23,160
it's not a contaminated Source from some

1117
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:24,359
ridiculous belief system out there so

1118
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:26,599
make sure that you're doing the heavy

1119
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:27,960
metal detox smoothie because you want

1120
00:41:26,599 --> 00:41:29,520
the heavy metals out because they feed

1121
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:31,640
the shingles virus it's one of the

1122
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:34,440
things the shingles virus likes if

1123
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:36,160
you're big on animal protein minimize it

1124
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:37,200
I would even consider and it just this

1125
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,520
isn't

1126
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:41,760
because I want you to be plant-based you

1127
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:44,640
know someone said oh you just want

1128
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:46,480
everybody plant-based that's not true I

1129
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,440
just want while you're six something to

1130
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:50,680
be done right in the right way from the

1131
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:52,000
information I have and then you go on

1132
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:53,440
your Merry way you want to eat all the

1133
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,839
animal protein you want later on when

1134
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:58,760
you're better go do it have fun

1135
00:41:56,839 --> 00:42:00,480
and you know that's not it just I would

1136
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:01,960
with some real trienal neurologist

1137
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,200
sufferers I would just back off the

1138
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:06,079
animal protein altogether just just just

1139
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:09,440
just get rid of it you know it's not

1140
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:11,880
about becoming a vegan it's not about

1141
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:14,319
what it's just it's just get rid of it

1142
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:15,880
all get your trigeminal neurologia

1143
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:17,640
better get rid of all the different

1144
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:20,280
animal proteins the chicken the wood

1145
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:23,880
because what happens is is it's not that

1146
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:27,240
chicken feeds a shingles virus causing

1147
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:29,599
the trigeminal neuralgia is that chicken

1148
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:31,680
will just be a it it won't be doing it

1149
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:34,040
won't be helping to heal it so do you

1150
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:35,079
have time do you have time to waste

1151
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:37,160
you're dealing with your trigeminal

1152
00:42:35,079 --> 00:42:38,559
neuralgia for years or for six months or

1153
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,920
for a month do you have time to waste

1154
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:41,880
you want it to last another year or two

1155
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,880
or three keep on eating chicken because

1156
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:47,640
it takes the space of something else

1157
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:49,240
that can actually heal your problem

1158
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:50,400
because when it comes down to all the

1159
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:52,640
different fruits and vegetables

1160
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:56,319
including potatoes especially

1161
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:58,119
potatoes that's a great one for triin on

1162
00:42:56,319 --> 00:43:01,200
neuralgia potatoes it's an incredible

1163
00:42:58,119 --> 00:43:05,079
one credible food it's got a hell heck

1164
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:07,160
of a lot of line content extremely high

1165
00:43:05,079 --> 00:43:08,960
bioavailable line that you can't even

1166
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:11,200
get when you take line which you should

1167
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:13,680
take while you have trinal neuralgia too

1168
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:16,040
is lyine and in the potato it's got an

1169
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:18,520
answer for helping to stop the shingles

1170
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:20,800
virus so when you don't eat a potato

1171
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:22,559
because all these Trends these new

1172
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,559
trends are ripping apart nightshades

1173
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:26,880
again and ripping apart a

1174
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:29,559
potato when you don't eat that because

1175
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:32,240
of an an idiotic Trend that's out there

1176
00:43:29,559 --> 00:43:33,720
now because say like eltin Trend or

1177
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:36,480
whatever it is you're going to keep your

1178
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:38,200
trinal neurologia around that's how it

1179
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,400
works that's how Trends work that's why

1180
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,880
they're tricky remember at the beginning

1181
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,400
of the show you remember at the very

1182
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:45,680
beginning when I said at the very

1183
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:48,720
beginning I said trendy traps I said or

1184
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:51,359
trendy traps trendy traps prevent

1185
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:53,000
healing they come out constantly because

1186
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:55,240
it's something that someone can hang

1187
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,240
their hat on the the lectin guys are

1188
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:58,720
going to hang their hat hat on the the

1189
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:00,520
fructose intolerance guys are going to

1190
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:02,079
hang their hat on someone needs to hang

1191
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:04,920
their hat on a trend it doesn't matter

1192
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:06,240
if you suffer for the rest of your life

1193
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:08,240
they'll hang that

1194
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,200
hat as long as it's something to hang

1195
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:13,520
their hat

1196
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:15,359
on but so forget the potato thing being

1197
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:17,079
bad it's actually important for

1198
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:18,559
trigeminal neurologist sufferers because

1199
00:44:17,079 --> 00:44:21,119
it helps get rid of the shingles virus

1200
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:23,240
guess what if anybody knew if any trendy

1201
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:25,119
person knew expert out there knew what

1202
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:27,400
caused trigemino neuralgia that would

1203
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:29,720
just be the start a little inkling of

1204
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:32,160
what they would need to know but you got

1205
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:34,040
the information here I say this because

1206
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:37,359
I'm determined

1207
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:40,160
with spirit and me determined with the

1208
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:42,040
passion and the caring and the wanting

1209
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:44,440
you to heal determined for you to know

1210
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:46,960
that and I worry if you're going to get

1211
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:48,640
distracted instantly the minute you hop

1212
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,440
on the internet the minute you see some

1213
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:52,520
other book the minute you and then you

1214
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:54,880
get stuck with your trigeminal neuralgia

1215
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:55,800
for years back when in the old days I'm

1216
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,359
going to tell you right now in the old

1217
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:59,079
days and somebody came to me with trinal

1218
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:01,079
neurologia they weren't distracted they

1219
00:44:59,079 --> 00:45:03,240
were able to heal and able to heal fast

1220
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:05,480
because they weren't distracted Because

1221
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:07,599
the Internet wasn't even born yet

1222
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:09,559
because because literally there weren't

1223
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:12,240
any you know there weren't any health

1224
00:45:09,559 --> 00:45:13,680
books out there you couldn't get

1225
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,079
distracted I'm not saying everything's

1226
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,160
all bad and all Health books are bad I'm

1227
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:18,000
not saying that at all I'm just saying

1228
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:19,559
you couldn't get distracted from what

1229
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,440
you were

1230
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:24,640
doing and so it was hey this is what's

1231
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:27,280
going on here's the advanc information

1232
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:31,000
here it is the year 19 1990 whatever or

1233
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:33,240
19 1991 here it is the year 1994 the

1234
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,800
1997 here's what you need to do here's

1235
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:37,079
your protocol that's right get your

1236
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:40,040
tramal nervia better it's the shingles

1237
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:42,760
virus bam you're better done you're not

1238
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:44,760
distracted and now it's hard it's hard

1239
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:46,720
for people all they have to do is just

1240
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:49,760
turn the wrong way and someone's saying

1241
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:51,760
some some cockamamy thing and that's the

1242
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:53,480
problem so in order to heal trigeminal

1243
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:55,359
neuralgia you have to get that corrected

1244
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:57,040
too you have to stay on point and you

1245
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:59,640
have to stay diligent and you got to

1246
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:01,839
stay with it because you're going to get

1247
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:04,280
lost out there and it hurts me to know

1248
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:06,400
that because I know what it's like to

1249
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:08,760
suffer because I've been given the gift

1250
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:10,760
to actually tap into that with people

1251
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:13,040
and I know the with the compassion and

1252
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:15,000
everything else I'm not saying I'm the

1253
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:16,839
most compassionate person out there I'm

1254
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,880
not saying that at all it's just Spirit

1255
00:46:16,839 --> 00:46:22,319
has basically placed upon me throughout

1256
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:24,280
my life a little sensitivity extra

1257
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:27,200
sensitivity inside of me to actually

1258

somebody with trigeminal neuralgia the

1362
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:16,880
B12 the right kind of B12 it has to be

1363
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:18,920
adoil kabalin and methyl kabalin I was

00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:23,480
one on that whole thing it's the adino

1366

cell with the methal K balamin it's the

1367
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:27,559
only way to get the trigeminal nerve is

1368
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:29,440
better there the methylfolate you do the

1369
00:50:27,559 --> 00:50:32,079
methylfolate that's helpful for trial

1370
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:35,839

want cat's claw for trinal neuralgia

1377
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,839

00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:53,520

whole bit and so when you compile the

1386
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:08,880
trigeminal neuralgia the pain and the

1387
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:10,480
suffering and the agony that goes along

1388
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:12,599

mountain top and they got their hands

1408
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:54,400
folded and they're just you know and

1409
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:55,799

chronically suffered who have been

1414

through hell and back have gone through

1415
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:05,440
so

1416
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:07,319
much that's the kind of Enlightenment

1417
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:09,200
that supersedes all the mountain tops

1418
00:52:07,319 --> 00:52:11,599
anybody can go be marching on to and

1419
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:13,480
doing not saying don't do that I'm just

1420
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:14,400
saying for people I'm glad you're doing

1421
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:17,200
it I'm just

1422
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:19,480
saying talking about walking over coals

1423
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:20,640
talking about walking over hot coals I'm

1424
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:22,160
just going to tell you right now people

1425
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:23,720
who have actually suffered with real

1426
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:25,079
problems with real things going on with

1427
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:26,640
their health neurological problems with

1428
00:52:25,079 --> 00:52:28,280
things xiety and everything else which

1429
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:30,079
trigeminal neuralgia can create a lot of

1430
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:31,640
anxiety it can all be part of that

1431
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:33,680
because of the different frenic nerves

1432
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:37,440
involved in the Vegas nerves what people

1433
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:39,400
go through walking on coals is a joke

1434
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:41,359
it's a damn

1435
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:43,960
joke all

1436
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:47,160
right anyway the bottom line is so what

1437
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:49,000
else can we do for it um so we got we

1438
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:51,000
got some of the herbs we can do for it

1439
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:53,280
okay um licorice root for sure that's a

1440
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:55,480
secret weapon to it without a doubt for

1441
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:57,280
dral neuralgia turmeric that's a great

1442
00:52:55,480 --> 00:53:00,079
one too you want to consider that one to

1443
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:01,520
bring that one in and we're dealing with

1444
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:03,680
a virus so these are really good

1445
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:05,920
antivirals zinc zinc is a winner for

1446
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:08,040
trienal neuralgia it's a winner for this

1447
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:09,960
it's a winner because zinc deficiencies

1448
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:12,480
allow shingles to be rampant and go

1449
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:13,839
crazy in the whole bit make sure like I

1450
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:16,000
said you do the heavy metal detox

1451
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:19,319
smoothie that that's happening no matter

1452
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:21,559
what make sure some people they can put

1453
00:53:19,319 --> 00:53:23,240
cold on there and it and it works and

1454
00:53:21,559 --> 00:53:24,839
then some people can't even have to cold

1455
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:26,680
touch them some people can put warmth on

1456
00:53:24,839 --> 00:53:28,440
their face or their head or the side of

1457
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:30,760
their head or their neck and sometimes

1458
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:33,079
that can touch it and sometimes it can't

1459
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:36,040
people have gone through the gamma with

1460
00:53:33,079 --> 00:53:38,359
all this it's disheartening and and it's

1461
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:41,319
it's just unbelievable unbelievable what

1462
00:53:38,359 --> 00:53:42,520
people do um Elderberry syrup that's

1463
00:53:41,319 --> 00:53:45,040
helpful too you could take a little

1464
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:48,040
Elderberry syrup that's helpful okay

1465
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:50,559
Elder Elder flow tea can be helpful

1466
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:53,200
elderflower tea that can be helpful with

1467
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:55,599
trigeminal neuralgia so consider that

1468
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:58,200
one too listen I'm with you I wish these

1469
00:53:55,599 --> 00:54:00,240
