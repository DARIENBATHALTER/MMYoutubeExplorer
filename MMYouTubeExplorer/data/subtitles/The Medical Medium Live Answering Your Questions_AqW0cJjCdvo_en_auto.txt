[91.20 - 95.04] making myself
[92.16 - 96.40] food because i got to eat later so i'm
[95.04 - 98.08] not sure what i'm making yet
[96.40 - 100.08] not quite sure yesterday i did the
[98.08 - 103.68] cranberry water i made myself a big
[100.08 - 106.40] salad all of that so very vegan says
[103.68 - 109.44] what should i do for chronic hives
[106.40 - 111.20] um so for chronic hives you got to think
[109.44 - 113.68] about this okay so
[111.20 - 114.24] why is there is there this reaction in
[113.68 - 116.16] the body
[114.24 - 117.36] what's happening like why is the body
[116.16 - 119.68] reacting
[117.36 - 121.44] well what happens with hives is our body
[119.68 - 124.24] reacts to a toxin
[121.44 - 125.92] a toxin and then we get these hives a
[124.24 - 127.84] result from this toxin
[125.92 - 128.96] and the hives come and go they'll come
[127.84 - 130.96] up they'll go down
[128.96 - 132.16] they'll come up they'll go down and what
[130.96 - 134.88] happens is that
[132.16 - 136.72] there's a toxin coming from some place
[134.88 - 138.32] and it comes from the liver
[136.72 - 140.32] and so as blood's coming out of your
[138.32 - 142.40] liver it's going to take some of that
[140.32 - 144.16] toxin and sweep it out of the liver
[142.40 - 145.44] send it through your bloodstream send it
[144.16 - 147.28] to the skin and you're just going to
[145.44 - 148.16] react and react and react so what kind
[147.28 - 151.12] of toxin
[148.16 - 151.84] is it well a lot of little things can do
[151.12 - 153.84] that okay
[151.84 - 156.24] so a little bit of pathogen material
[153.84 - 158.48] like a byproduct from
[156.24 - 159.84] the old mono bug the epstein-barr bug
[158.48 - 161.68] that sits inside her liver
[159.84 - 164.48] for years and years and years that
[161.68 - 167.44] releases poisons those poisons go out
[164.48 - 168.80] we react we react and then streptococcus
[167.44 - 171.20] if you ever had strep throat when you
[168.80 - 171.84] were younger or a kid or ear infections
[171.20 - 175.12] or
[171.84 - 176.64] a stye or uti that strep is still in her
[175.12 - 178.48] system and once in a while a little
[176.64 - 179.28] pocket of that junk just swoops out of
[178.48 - 182.24] the liver
[179.28 - 183.36] and it causes a hive and then if you run
[182.24 - 186.88] into different other
[183.36 - 189.60] exposures and triggers like toxins like
[186.88 - 190.72] mold or air fresheners and scented
[189.60 - 192.56] candles
[190.72 - 194.56] that's going to really instigate it
[192.56 - 197.20] that's really going to instigate it or
[194.56 - 199.20] conventional cleaning supplies or bleach
[197.20 - 202.00] that's really going to instigate it so
[199.20 - 203.44] that's how it works so um you can clean
[202.00 - 204.88] that up you can clean the liver up you
[203.44 - 207.12] can work with your foods
[204.88 - 208.64] medical medium information you can you
[207.12 - 210.24] know do that because you can i would do
[208.64 - 212.32] just steamed potatoes celery juice and
[210.24 - 213.60] butter leaf lettuce for like a month and
[212.32 - 214.72] try to get rid of those hives that's
[213.60 - 216.88] what i would do
[214.72 - 218.40] um it would go with the mono eating i
[216.88 - 220.40] would do the moderating cleanse and
[218.40 - 222.48] cleanse the heal that's that's and just
[220.40 - 224.48] do the potato mono eating cleanse with
[222.48 - 226.72] you see since you're vegan you shouldn't
[224.48 - 230.00] have a problem doing steamed potatoes
[226.72 - 231.68] twice a day have salads with it lettuces
[230.00 - 234.08] romaine lettuce butter leaf lettuce red
[231.68 - 235.68] leaf lettuce and do your celery juice
[234.08 - 237.52] do your lemon water maybe the heavy
[235.68 - 239.04] metal detox smoothie and just do that
[237.52 - 240.56] every day that's what i would do i would
[239.04 - 242.48] do that every day for a month
[240.56 - 244.16] get rid of the hives clean up that liver
[242.48 - 245.28] and all of that hello yesterday's tick
[244.16 - 248.00] tock was great
[245.28 - 249.36] kesha wasn't it so cool my god i can't
[248.00 - 251.12] believe it you were there
[249.36 - 253.04] i can't believe it and you're gonna be
[251.12 - 254.24] there today because i'm doing today's
[253.04 - 255.52] tick tock and i'm going to answer
[254.24 - 257.36] questions
[255.52 - 258.96] i hope i see your comment come up
[257.36 - 260.08] because a lot of comments come up lately
[258.96 - 262.40] so i hope i see it
[260.08 - 264.48] and so i can answer your question um
[262.40 - 265.04] ruth says best foods and supplements
[264.48 - 268.08] from
[265.04 - 271.52] for rheumatoid arthritis so
[268.08 - 273.52] ra that's caused by ebv
[271.52 - 275.92] because that's what causes ra it causes
[273.52 - 277.44] hashimoto's it causes fibromyalgia
[275.92 - 278.64] that's what it causes it causes a lot of
[277.44 - 280.08] different conditions it causes the
[278.64 - 283.52] hashimoto's thyroiditis
[280.08 - 285.36] and so ra that is the true
[283.52 - 286.56] cause people don't know that it's it's
[285.36 - 287.92] ebv so
[286.56 - 288.96] if you're going to be eating foods or
[287.92 - 290.40] you're going to be taking care of
[288.96 - 291.60] yourself or supplements you want to be
[290.40 - 292.72] anti-viral

[292.72 - 295.12] always take that information to the
[294.00 - 296.64] doctor and learn about
[295.12 - 298.88] r.a and everything but i'm going to be

[461.68 - 464.24] condition
[462.72 - 465.92] if you're somebody that's living with
[464.24 - 467.44] something that you don't want to live
[465.92 - 469.04] with some kind of symptom
[467.44 - 471.52] some kind of condition i would keep the
[469.04 - 474.24] eggs out even in cooked food
[471.52 - 474.96] i would keep the eggs out even when it's
[474.24 - 476.88] in food
[474.96 - 478.48] it's in something else and it's mixed i
[476.88 - 479.44] would just keep it away if you can
[478.48 - 480.88] because
[479.44 - 483.28] that would that it could get us in
[480.88 - 486.72] trouble so what's your egg replacement
[483.28 - 488.80] avocado in a potato
[486.72 - 489.76] i would replace egg with avocado or
[488.80 - 492.88] potato
[489.76 - 494.24] or if you really want both you know

[494.24 - 498.64] with both of those things avocado and
[496.56 - 502.16] potato that's what i would do
[498.64 - 506.40] um i would consider that charo says yep

[513.68 - 517.36] chris says what is the best way to
[515.12 - 519.44] address multiple health diagnoses so you
[517.36 - 520.80] got multiple health diagnoses so what
[519.44 - 522.48] i've always said is
[520.80 - 524.32] which one here's the thing which one
[522.48 - 526.24] bothers you the most
[524.32 - 527.92] so that's what i've always said and you
[526.24 - 529.44] can go in here find out which one
[527.92 - 531.84] bothers you the most
[529.44 - 533.68] you can look into it and work that way
[531.84 - 535.44] if if you want you can maybe one that
[533.68 - 536.64] bothers you less that's okay too and
[535.44 - 537.84] start with that but what you're going to
[536.64 - 539.76] find out about is
[537.84 - 541.04] that if you address one of your
[539.76 - 541.84] conditions in here you're going to
[541.04 - 544.24] notice
[541.84 - 546.96] other things going away because they're
[544.24 - 548.72] all connected

[579.76 - 584.72] alexandra you're here the meditations
[582.56 - 585.76] are helping me process so much grief and
[584.72 - 589.12] let it go
[585.76 - 591.84] and surprising surprising how
[589.12 - 594.08] gentle the meditations make it that's
[591.84 - 597.12] the whole point the meditations are
[594.08 - 597.76] there to help you release things in a
[597.12 - 601.20] way that's
[597.76 - 602.40] healing and gentle and not hard work
[601.20 - 604.48] that's the point they're guided
[602.40 - 607.92] meditations you guys you guys know that
[604.48 - 609.68] deanna's here hi hi deanna deanna d
[607.92 - 611.12] deanna dia is that how you say your last
[609.68 - 613.84] name um
[611.12 - 615.44] elizabeth you're here too the half moon
[613.84 - 616.40] is coming up elizabeth the half moon is
[615.44 - 619.44] coming up
[616.40 - 622.24] yep and it is and the half moon's coming
[619.44 - 625.36] up it's moon meditation time you guys
[622.24 - 626.08] seriously it's moon meditation guys it's
[625.36 - 628.16] time
[626.08 - 630.16] i mean you do it in the full moon and
[628.16 - 632.32] you do it in the week of the half moon
[630.16 - 634.40] or three days around the half moon
[632.32 - 637.04] that's that's the powerhouse right there
[634.40 - 637.60] because the magnetic pull of a half moon
[637.04 - 639.60] does
[637.60 - 641.28] different things than the magnetic pull
[639.60 - 644.64] of a full moon
[641.28 - 647.20] take advantage of the moon meditation
[644.64 - 648.64] whatever you do take advantage of it
