[502.26 - 506.28] that's a cool handle I am not being
[504.36 - 509.10] taken seriously

[518.88 - 522.36] this and now this brain shot will take
[520.98 - 525.12] me to the next level and that's what I
[522.36 - 528.48] wanted to say the brain shot rewires the
[525.12 - 530.94] brain it de-brainwashes people we're
[528.48 - 535.02] beaten down so we can't speak up
[530.94 - 536.94] we're beaten down so we can't speak up

[536.94 - 542.82] decipher the truth too decipher the
[539.88 - 545.40] truth to see through it to be like an
[542.82 - 548.16] Oracle and see through it it helps us it
[545.40 - 550.38] rewires the brain it opens up a chamber
[548.16 - 552.60] a chamber of knowledge in and
[550.38 - 554.88] understanding inside of us so that we
[552.60 - 557.48] can hear and speak the truth and hear
[554.88 - 557.48] the truth
[557.64 - 562.80] it's really powerful
[559.80 - 565.68] herbal girl has a question how does this
[562.80 - 567.48] shot change others perception of us
[565.68 - 569.46] what's incredible about this the
[567.48 - 571.56] phytochemical compounds right that no
[569.46 - 576.20] one would know exists because they're
[571.56 - 576.20] not found anywhere in some science lab
[576.54 - 583.44] phytochemical compounds in our food
[580.26 - 586.86] has power that's unimaginable and
[583.44 - 589.16] untapped we just don't know what it is
[586.86 - 591.96] so this synergistic
[589.16 - 592.80] combination of what's sitting in front
[591.96 - 595.62] of me
[592.80 - 597.36] helps to unlock the emotional center of
[595.62 - 598.92] the brain that's been hindered and
[597.36 - 601.80] damaged
[598.92 - 604.32] should we get like a rewiring
[601.80 - 606.90] and that's what's incredible about it
[604.32 - 608.88] all the destruction on this planet all

[631.68 - 636.42] powerful
[633.44 - 639.24] magical medicine within the food on this
[636.42 - 642.18] planet if we have the power
[639.24 - 643.92] as men on this planet as mankind on this
[642.18 - 644.78] planet to corrupt and destroy this
[643.92 - 647.04] planet

[771.54 - 775.50] okay
[772.92 - 778.38] there's a lot of people that
[775.50 - 780.78] that know the truth about how bad that
[778.38 - 783.18] was in the last couple years but they
[780.78 - 785.28] just you they'll never ever no way
[783.18 - 787.74] that's not possible
[785.28 - 790.28] I'm fine it didn't bother me it didn't
[787.74 - 790.28] affect me
[790.92 - 794.24] code code code code
[796.38 - 800.58] how about this one learning about Hidden
[798.66 - 802.26] Truths for example when you want to
[800.58 - 803.64] expand your understanding and knowledge
[802.26 - 805.56] of what's happening with the world
[803.64 - 807.66] around you what I love about the
[805.56 - 810.54] speaking of Truth stabilizer is because
[807.66 - 812.40] it opens the door to understanding more
[810.54 - 815.22] around you like I said this guy I was
[812.40 - 818.54] talking about lives in a bubble man
[815.22 - 818.54] lives in a bubble
[818.94 - 823.92] this world was this big
[821.34 - 827.28] this big
[823.92 - 829.68] got up in the morning worked out
[827.28 - 832.88] had some eggs and some in a smoothie
[829.68 - 832.88] protein smoothie
[833.64 - 836.94] worked for a little bit on the computer
[835.20 - 838.68] or on his job
[836.94 - 841.02] met up with his friends at happy hour
[838.68 - 843.18] right at a bar
[841.02 - 844.98] went on a date with this girl came back
[843.18 - 846.66] home watched a Netflix movie that was
[844.98 - 849.24] his that's that's the bubble right there
[846.66 - 851.28] doesn't even know how bad the world is
[849.24 - 853.32] in so many ways and how much crap is
[851.28 - 857.22] going on
[853.32 - 859.62] and with and what is happening
[857.22 - 861.92] just bubble that's just one example
[859.62 - 861.92] right
[862.32 - 867.00] learning about Hidden Truths
[865.08 - 869.82] So speaking your truth stabilizer can
[867.00 - 871.98] open that Gateway open that door to
[869.82 - 874.08] hearing about Hidden Truths you want to
[871.98 - 875.82] learn how to read between the lines and
[874.08 - 877.20] see what others are not seeing how about
[875.82 - 879.18] that how about being able to read
[877.20 - 881.64] between the lines so what does this do
[879.18 - 884.04] this helps our intuition this helps our
[881.64 - 886.44] telepathic Powers this helps our
[884.04 - 890.40] spiritual psychic ability this helps our
[886.44 - 892.50] Clairvoyant skills this helps that you
[890.40 - 894.72] want to sharpen that you want to sharpen
[892.50 - 896.52] that like attack
[894.72 - 898.86] foreign
[896.52 - 901.62] about Hidden Truths for example when
[898.86 - 905.34] you're seeking out Hidden Truths
[901.62 - 909.72] when you are a truth Seeker
[905.34 - 912.00] a truth Seeker when you want to read
[909.72 - 914.28] between the lines
[912.00 - 916.32] you want to see the truth and read
[914.28 - 918.66] between the lines or you're a truth
[916.32 - 921.18] Seeker
[918.66 - 923.28] you want to expand your horizon your
[921.18 - 924.72] understanding of the truth about what's
[923.28 - 927.84] happening in the world you want to
[924.72 - 930.90] expand you don't want to be locked in a
[927.84 - 933.48] box you don't want when some truth does
[930.90 - 935.34] fall in your hands you can't see it
[933.48 - 936.72] because you're just you're stuck and
[935.34 - 938.76] you've got the brainwashing and
[936.72 - 940.68] conditioning if you want to break
[938.76 - 943.34] conditioning speaking your truth
[940.68 - 943.34] stabilizer
[943.56 - 949.08] when Spirit of compassion gave me this
[946.50 - 950.94] one right here this brain shot therapy
[949.08 - 954.00] right here at a brain saver when Spirit
[950.94 - 957.48] of compassion offered this
[954.00 - 960.42] from above I was like what
[957.48 - 962.82] what do you mean
[960.42 - 965.28] I was taking down the notes feverishly
[962.82 - 967.26] on this one Speaking of Truth stabilizer
[965.28 - 969.42] what are you talking about I was writing
[967.26 - 971.16] down the notes like this and spirit of
[969.42 - 973.10] compassion was it's for conditioning
[971.16 - 975.66] it's for brainwashing it's about
[973.10 - 977.52] unlocking that emotional center it's
[975.66 - 978.60] about if someone told you the truth you
[977.52 - 980.10] wouldn't even see it if you could
[978.60 - 982.80] because you're all locked up in here
[980.10 - 984.48] it's about opening that Gateway that
[982.80 - 986.70] door to hearing the truth do you hear
[984.48 - 988.68] how incredible this is my mind was
[986.70 - 990.84] completely blown when I was writing down
[988.68 - 992.70] these notes for this one right here
[990.84 - 994.44] it's when you want to read between the
[992.70 - 996.60] lines you want to build that telepathic
[994.44 - 998.22] power you want to build that Clairvoyant
[996.60 - 1000.56] skill you want to build that intuitive
[998.22 - 1002.18] nature inside of you you want to be able
[1000.56 - 1003.80] to read between the lines you want to
[1002.18 - 1006.44] know about Hidden Truths you want to
[1003.80 - 1008.48] seek the truth all of that and when I
[1006.44 - 1011.54] heard that I was like this is probably
[1008.48 - 1014.12] one of the most profound brain shot
[1011.54 - 1016.72] therapies that are in the brain saver
[1014.12 - 1016.72] books
[1020.30 - 1024.52] it can also help build a skin
[1025.16 - 1028.88] build a skin
[1027.50 - 1031.58] right
[1028.88 - 1034.66] so you're not afraid you're not afraid
[1031.58 - 1034.66] to hear a truth
[1036.08 - 1039.56] a truth that can better your life a
[1037.94 - 1041.48] truth that can move you forward a truth
[1039.56 - 1043.04] that can break conditioning move that
[1041.48 - 1046.82] out of the way the truth that can
[1043.04 - 1049.70] literally unlock and start
[1046.82 - 1052.82] breaking down that brainwashing that
[1049.70 - 1054.86] this world has done to so many people so
[1052.82 - 1056.60] the world is this big because they've
[1054.86 - 1058.58] been brainwashed
[1056.60 - 1060.44] foreign
[1058.58 - 1062.18] I want to read I want to read a little
[1060.44 - 1064.22] bit in brain saver if you guys got a
[1062.18 - 1066.32] minute
[1064.22 - 1067.94] I'm going to go to page 12 of brain
[1066.32 - 1070.58] saver you guys wanna
[1067.94 - 1073.76] this is kind of a little bit
[1070.58 - 1075.44] different but it's interesting I thought
[1073.76 - 1076.94] it would be just kind of really cool to
[1075.44 - 1080.80] read
[1076.94 - 1080.80] senso said this is so mind-blowing
[1081.92 - 1086.92] another thing too is they're weaponizing
[1085.16 - 1088.28] the truth
[1086.92 - 1091.40] [Music]
[1088.28 - 1093.62] you the term truth they're weaponizing
[1091.40 - 1095.84] it right you see that out there they're
[1093.62 - 1098.00] weaponizing my truth
[1095.84 - 1099.74] somebody might have an experience but
[1098.00 - 1101.96] it's not technically the truth it's an
[1099.74 - 1103.70] experience they had an opinion but what
[1101.96 - 1105.32] they're doing is they'll use that and
[1103.70 - 1107.72] they'll just weaponize it that's my
[1105.32 - 1111.40] truth right
[1107.72 - 1111.40] that's a new technique
[1114.26 - 1121.94] this actually helps to clean that up
[1118.64 - 1124.10] so that somebody's observation
[1121.94 - 1128.14] because here's what happens
[1124.10 - 1128.14] a car can be coming around the bend
[1129.02 - 1133.94] and run over somebody but one person
[1131.30 - 1136.82] doesn't even see it
[1133.94 - 1138.44] and another person does the person that
[1136.82 - 1139.82] didn't see that car run over the person
[1138.44 - 1143.74] is going to say I didn't see that car
[1139.82 - 1143.74] run over the person that was my truth
[1144.14 - 1150.98] the other person saw that car
[1147.62 - 1153.38] run that person over and that person
[1150.98 - 1156.98] said no
[1153.38 - 1160.28] the truth is the car ran over the person
[1156.98 - 1162.80] the other person saying I didn't see it
[1160.28 - 1165.40] so my truth is that car didn't run over
[1162.80 - 1165.40] that person
[1169.16 - 1172.94] the truth stabilizer helps us so we can
[1171.20 - 1174.56] see things more so we can understand
[1172.94 - 1176.18] them more
[1174.56 - 1178.96] we can understand if we've been hurt
[1176.18 - 1178.96] emotionally
[1180.26 - 1185.78] you might have been hurt emotionally
[1182.60 - 1187.82] and not even know it
[1185.78 - 1191.12] because we're conditioned
[1187.82 - 1192.86] not to talk about it not to
[1191.12 - 1194.36] feel it
[1192.86 - 1195.92] and you
[1194.36 - 1197.72] you shift something in the brain of
[1195.92 - 1198.74] rewiring an insults you know what I was
[1197.72 - 1202.10] hurt
[1198.74 - 1203.78] the truth comes out I was hurt
[1202.10 - 1205.46] somebody else with an observation be
[1203.78 - 1206.66] like you weren't hurt you weren't hurt
[1205.46 - 1209.24] at all
[1206.66 - 1213.52] my truth says you weren't hurt and the
[1209.24 - 1213.52] person's like no I actually was hurt
[1213.74 - 1219.10] somebody asked what book this is
[1215.78 - 1219.10] brain saver right here
[1221.12 - 1225.38] let me read a little something in here
[1223.28 - 1228.74] we're also going to make a really
[1225.38 - 1230.30] powerful brain shot therapy one that I
[1228.74 - 1231.86] am looking forward to and I just want to
[1230.30 - 1233.30] give everybody an introduction right
[1231.86 - 1234.68] here to what you just see in front of me
[1233.30 - 1236.60] just so we know what's going on if you
[1234.68 - 1238.64] don't have these ingredients right now
[1236.60 - 1241.04] and can't do this shot right now I'm
[1238.64 - 1242.96] perfectly fine and happy with that just
[1241.04 - 1245.78] hang out with us it's okay this is free
[1242.96 - 1247.82] this is free
[1245.78 - 1249.44] so I got some garlic right here I got a
[1247.82 - 1250.82] garlic clove I'm gonna dump in there a
[1249.44 - 1252.38] little later I want to show you this I
[1250.82 - 1253.94] got an orange I peeled it so that's
[1252.38 - 1255.50] ready too I got oranges right there I
[1253.94 - 1258.26] got turmeric I want to show you a little
[1255.50 - 1261.32] turmeric I got peeled man when you peel
[1258.26 - 1262.40] turmeric you know what happens if your
[1261.32 - 1264.14] injures your hands are going to be
[1262.40 - 1266.18] orange it's insane that kind of
[1264.14 - 1267.86] anthocyanin right that whole all of them
[1266.18 - 1270.32] those polyphenols everything that's in
[1267.86 - 1272.06] there right the antioxidants all of it
[1270.32 - 1274.94] anyway
[1272.06 - 1276.98] and then we got the ginger right I got
[1274.94 - 1280.22] the ginger ready for this I also have
[1276.98 - 1285.20] basil check that out too basil powerful
[1280.22 - 1287.90] herb arugula powerful herb that I use as
[1285.20 - 1289.40] a leafy green leafy greens and then of
[1287.90 - 1290.42] course lettuce I got a green leaf
[1289.40 - 1293.42] lettuce
[1290.42 - 1296.30] so these are the ingredients
[1293.42 - 1299.54] but we're gonna start reading
[1296.30 - 1302.60] all right I'm on page number 12.
[1299.54 - 1303.38] I'm in brain saver if you guys don't
[1302.60 - 1305.06] mind
[1303.38 - 1306.44] I just want to tell everybody who's here
[1305.06 - 1307.94] that doesn't have these books get the
[1306.44 - 1309.50] books when you can get them free at the
[1307.94 - 1313.10] library if you can but they're also like
[1309.50 - 1317.42] 50 50 off I know the brand protocols
[1313.10 - 1320.30] right 50 off amazon.com us okay over 600
[1317.42 - 1323.24] Pages they're they're just medical
[1320.30 - 1325.46] Bibles each is over 600 Pages it's
[1323.24 - 1327.98] insane let's get into it a little bit
[1325.46 - 1330.32] your sensory input isn't the only
[1327.98 - 1332.78] information your neurons decipher and
[1330.32 - 1335.48] pass along
[1332.78 - 1338.18] you smell
[1335.48 - 1341.02] you taste
[1338.18 - 1341.02] you hear
[1341.36 - 1345.62] that information comes in and goes
[1343.40 - 1348.20] through interior neurons right you smell
[1345.62 - 1350.78] something boom your cranial nerves are
[1348.20 - 1353.90] taking it in you hear something right
[1350.78 - 1355.64] you're you're taking it in you taste
[1353.90 - 1357.50] something you're taking it in your
[1355.64 - 1359.54] sensory input isn't the only information
[1357.50 - 1362.00] your neurons decipher and pass along
[1359.54 - 1365.18] they also translate information about
[1362.00 - 1367.34] your body processes neurons apply to
[1365.18 - 1368.36] every single function your body has so
[1367.34 - 1369.32] I'm talking about this for a minute
[1368.36 - 1371.72] because we're going to talk about what
[1369.32 - 1375.50] happens when neurons get all clogged up
[1371.72 - 1378.86] with toxins and then all of a sudden
[1375.50 - 1380.90] everything gets skewed in here
[1378.86 - 1382.94] and you might know somebody that's like
[1380.90 - 1384.98] wait a minute
[1382.94 - 1386.42] that person's got some serious toxins
[1384.98 - 1389.06] inside the neurons this is really
[1386.42 - 1391.70] incredible information right here
[1389.06 - 1393.50] neurons apply to every single function
[1391.70 - 1395.60] your body has
[1393.50 - 1397.52] so your brain your neurons apply to
[1395.60 - 1399.56] every function and how healthy your
[1397.52 - 1402.26] neurons are determines how comfortable
[1399.56 - 1405.92] you're going to be in your mind and body
[1402.26 - 1407.84] if you see somebody losing their mind
[1405.92 - 1410.78] like their manic
[1407.84 - 1412.34] they're running down the street naked
[1410.78 - 1414.56] but they're not running down the street
[1412.34 - 1416.12] naked because they made a decision to do
[1414.56 - 1419.24] a prank
[1416.12 - 1421.70] where they stripped off their clothes
[1419.24 - 1424.22] they jumped out of their car and they're
[1421.70 - 1426.74] running down the highway because they
[1424.22 - 1428.54] wanted to
[1426.74 - 1430.16] which I still think is probably
[1428.54 - 1432.08] something's going on there but if they
[1430.16 - 1434.06] but if they're but if it's somebody
[1432.08 - 1436.22] that's running down the street naked
[1434.06 - 1439.22] right
[1436.22 - 1440.54] so your neurons determine how
[1439.22 - 1442.28] comfortable you're going to be in your
[1440.54 - 1444.68] mind and body that is neurons are
[1442.28 - 1447.08] involved in both mental functioning and
[1444.68 - 1449.24] your state of health mental functioning
[1447.08 - 1451.70] your neurons are involved in that when
[1449.24 - 1453.86] you have brain related symptoms even on
[1451.70 - 1455.60] the milder scale such as a mild fatigue
[1453.86 - 1457.10] or mild brain fog It's really because
[1455.60 - 1459.74] neurons can't transfer information
[1457.10 - 1462.08] properly to the next group of neurons if
[1459.74 - 1463.46] anybody has fatigue now we're in the
[1462.08 - 1464.78] whole speaking or true thing but there's
[1463.46 - 1466.64] something in here that's interesting
[1464.78 - 1468.32] about this if you're dealing with
[1466.64 - 1471.14] fatigue if you're somebody with some
[1468.32 - 1473.90] type of fatigue and that fatigue is more
[1471.14 - 1476.18] than exhaustion
[1473.90 - 1478.34] that fatigue is more than exhaustion
[1476.18 - 1481.58] that means the neurons have something
[1478.34 - 1483.32] going on something wrong with them now
[1481.58 - 1485.30] of course we talk about what that is in
[1483.32 - 1488.30] the books but
[1485.30 - 1489.98] it's transferring information
[1488.30 - 1491.54] to the next group of neurons and if
[1489.98 - 1493.70] there's if there's something hindering
[1491.54 - 1495.86] this pathway in the electricity with the
[1493.70 - 1499.04] traveling of that information then you
[1495.86 - 1500.96] get fatigue you get it you get you get a
[1499.04 - 1503.42] problem you get a symptom
[1500.96 - 1506.12] something is blocking or otherwise
[1503.42 - 1508.52] impeding the pathway within the synapsis
[1506.12 - 1510.44] so the neurons sending out electrical
[1508.52 - 1511.82] impulses are not reaching other neurons
[1510.44 - 1513.50] that need the information or not
[1511.82 - 1515.12] reaching the neurons as intended so what
[1513.50 - 1516.56] I'm getting to right now if you have a
[1515.12 - 1518.84] physical symptom something's wrong
[1516.56 - 1521.12] neurons in the brain with information
[1518.84 - 1523.70] are trying to send that information to
[1521.12 - 1525.38] areas in your body if your fatigued
[1523.70 - 1529.12] something's going on with the central
[1525.38 - 1531.74] nervous system your neurons okay
[1529.12 - 1533.30] you can see this in everyday life when
[1531.74 - 1535.64] you're telling someone a story about
[1533.30 - 1537.08] apples and find out that the whole time
[1535.64 - 1539.72] they thought you were talking about
[1537.08 - 1542.90] oranges did you ever have that situation
[1539.72 - 1546.94] you're talking about apples and someone
[1542.90 - 1546.94] thinks you're talking about oranges
[1549.32 - 1553.22] any kind of impedement within a person's
[1551.60 - 1555.74] neurons can mean that the information
[1553.22 - 1558.02] their neurons process gets altered
[1555.74 - 1559.88] affecting that person's ability to focus
[1558.02 - 1561.80] listener properly properly receive
[1559.88 - 1563.84] information from a conversation or story
[1561.80 - 1565.82] what I'm trying to say is
[1563.84 - 1567.56] if something's going on in somebody's
[1565.82 - 1570.92] neurons
[1567.56 - 1574.10] and you're telling them a story
[1570.92 - 1575.66] this is what happened to me
[1574.10 - 1579.08] right
[1575.66 - 1582.74] I was walking along the sidewalk I
[1579.08 - 1587.08] tripped on a crack in the sidewalk
[1582.74 - 1587.08] I fell I banged my head
[1587.12 - 1592.34] and got up and then somebody on a
[1590.66 - 1594.62] bicycle hit me
[1592.34 - 1598.04] going by
[1594.62 - 1600.74] I went to the emergency room I thought I
[1598.04 - 1602.54] had a concussion
[1600.74 - 1605.00] and they're telling somebody this and
[1602.54 - 1608.96] this is what the person heard
[1605.00 - 1610.16] they were skipping along on the sidewalk
[1608.96 - 1612.74] and
[1610.16 - 1615.50] hit a guy on a bike and the guy in the
[1612.74 - 1619.36] bike went to the hospital
[1615.50 - 1619.36] that's the story they heard
[1622.34 - 1627.02] you're talking about apples somebody
[1623.84 - 1629.26] else is talking about oranges
[1627.02 - 1629.26] foreign
[1629.92 - 1634.34] is that when you're you're talking about
[1633.08 - 1635.48] a story that happened to you you're
[1634.34 - 1636.80] talking about experience that happened
[1635.48 - 1638.78] to you and you're telling the story to
[1636.80 - 1641.18] somebody else and they're not getting it
[1638.78 - 1643.46] they're like what happened to you what
[1641.18 - 1645.50] you tripped you fell where what what guy
[1643.46 - 1647.72] was on a bicycle is that guy okay you're
[1645.50 - 1649.94] like no I'm the one that got hurt I
[1647.72 - 1652.88] banged my head the guy hit me on the
[1649.94 - 1654.14] bicycle I went to the emergency room and
[1652.88 - 1655.94] you know you're trying to tell them the
[1654.14 - 1657.62] story but but they're not really getting
[1655.94 - 1659.48] it all so you have to tell the story
[1657.62 - 1660.98] over again I don't know if you've ever
[1659.48 - 1662.48] run into that have you ever had that
[1660.98 - 1664.22] situation you're trying to tell that
[1662.48 - 1666.44] story again
[1664.22 - 1669.16] and you you're trying to get them to
[1666.44 - 1669.16] understand you
[1672.20 - 1675.80] so that person may tell somebody else an
[1674.36 - 1677.54] entirely different version and so you
[1675.80 - 1679.46] tell somebody your story and that person
[1677.54 - 1681.68] tells somebody else a story that's not
[1679.46 - 1683.72] the same story
[1681.68 - 1685.40] because they're hearing it differently
[1683.72 - 1688.82] from you
[1685.40 - 1691.16] so you're telling the story to someone
[1688.82 - 1693.02] a story that may have meaning to you an
[1691.16 - 1694.94] experience that you had and the person
[1693.02 - 1697.88] you just told that story to is now
[1694.94 - 1700.40] telling a story to someone else
[1697.88 - 1703.84] but it's not coming out the same
[1700.40 - 1703.84] it's coming out differently
[1705.32 - 1708.76] and it wasn't correct
[1710.12 - 1713.90] then that person may tell someone else
[1712.04 - 1716.66] with an entirely different version of
[1713.90 - 1719.66] the original story that was told to them
[1716.66 - 1722.60] this is how gossip and rumors can be
[1719.66 - 1724.46] twisted and turned into hearsay as the
[1722.60 - 1726.28] story goes from person to person it goes
[1724.46 - 1729.38] through each person's contaminated
[1726.28 - 1731.96] impeded blocked or diminished neurons
[1729.38 - 1735.56] and the story changes
[1731.96 - 1738.56] this is how a story can go from person
[1735.56 - 1740.66] to person to person and the way the
[1738.56 - 1743.38] story started out is not the way the
[1740.66 - 1743.38] story ended
[1743.96 - 1748.94] so the original story somebody spoke of
[1747.32 - 1751.16] went through
[1748.94 - 1755.12] all these brains
[1751.16 - 1756.02] so the story you just had about your
[1755.12 - 1759.14] life
[1756.02 - 1762.32] went into somebody else's brain
[1759.14 - 1765.20] and when it came out of their mouth
[1762.32 - 1766.64] to someone else it went into that other
[1765.20 - 1770.72] person's brain
[1766.64 - 1772.82] and then it went from their brain out to
[1770.72 - 1774.38] somebody else and went into somebody
[1772.82 - 1777.38] else's brain
[1774.38 - 1780.38] the story's changing each each time as
[1777.38 - 1783.32] it's going along the story is not the
[1780.38 - 1785.48] same the story isn't the original story
[1783.32 - 1789.04] from where it started
[1785.48 - 1789.04] it has altered
[1789.08 - 1792.88] it's not the same story
[1794.00 - 1799.94] it reminds me of a person I know that
[1797.06 - 1801.68] worked on a cruise ship
[1799.94 - 1802.70] something happened to them on that
[1801.68 - 1805.76] cruise ship
[1802.70 - 1807.62] they told somebody that was also working
[1805.76 - 1810.32] on that cruise ship
[1807.62 - 1812.06] it went to that person and then that
[1810.32 - 1813.26] person told another person that was on
[1812.06 - 1815.78] that cruise ship
[1813.26 - 1818.72] and by the time it got around to all the
[1815.78 - 1821.72] people who worked on the cruise ship
[1818.72 - 1824.84] it got back to the original person and
[1821.72 - 1826.82] it was an entirely different story
[1824.84 - 1829.16] and there's a reason for this
[1826.82 - 1832.10] because people have brain problems
[1829.16 - 1833.12] because people have neurons that are
[1832.10 - 1834.80] toxic
[1833.12 - 1836.90] have all kinds of different short
[1834.80 - 1839.24] circuiting going on in their brain
[1836.90 - 1841.64] all kinds of different blocks in their
[1839.24 - 1843.62] emotional centers of the brain all kinds
[1841.64 - 1846.20] of different injuries in their brain
[1843.62 - 1848.66] they look fine they seem fine but this
[1846.20 - 1850.46] story changes as it goes along
[1848.66 - 1852.74] so it goes into this next part this is
[1850.46 - 1854.42] interesting though we're in brain saver
[1852.74 - 1856.04] right here if you guys gotta admit it'd
[1854.42 - 1858.02] love to read a little bit more as
[1856.04 - 1860.60] electricity travels through an impeded
[1858.02 - 1862.28] neuron system and this is this is really
[1860.60 - 1864.92] incredible in for info when you think
[1862.28 - 1868.22] about it it can become diminished so as
[1864.92 - 1870.68] electricity travels through
[1868.22 - 1872.72] people's neurons and people's neurons
[1870.68 - 1875.72] are dirty
[1872.72 - 1878.18] they get their toxic neurons
[1875.72 - 1880.28] it diminishes meaning that electricity
[1878.18 - 1882.92] within the brain is no longer traveling
[1880.28 - 1885.14] at its full capacity
[1882.92 - 1887.18] that is a group of neurons can receive a
[1885.14 - 1889.28] fully charged electrical impulse and and
[1887.18 - 1891.26] then in the process of assimilating and
[1889.28 - 1893.06] registering that electricity which is
[1891.26 - 1895.16] filled with information
[1893.06 - 1897.08] and sending it through the synapsis to
[1895.16 - 1899.42] another group of neurons electricity can
[1897.08 - 1901.40] be diminished when electricity is
[1899.42 - 1903.32] diminished the information within it can
[1901.40 - 1905.54] be skewed changed and altered so what
[1903.32 - 1906.98] happens is when you're someone's hearing
[1905.54 - 1909.56] something
[1906.98 - 1910.76] when they're hearing something
[1909.56 - 1912.80] okay
[1910.76 - 1914.78] what yeah
[1912.80 - 1916.28] what happened to that person
[1914.78 - 1918.80] all right
[1916.28 - 1920.54] all right you got it okay I'm gonna tell
[1918.80 - 1923.12] somebody else what
[1920.54 - 1925.16] they fell into the water
[1923.12 - 1926.78] somebody had to pull them out and save
[1925.16 - 1930.08] them all right
[1926.78 - 1933.02] yeah this person fell off a cliff
[1930.08 - 1935.30] yeah fell off a cliff
[1933.02 - 1937.16] yep I someone I don't know someone
[1935.30 - 1939.44] helped him
[1937.16 - 1941.42] really person fell off a cliff and
[1939.44 - 1943.70] somebody helped them all right let me go
[1941.42 - 1946.52] let me go tell somebody that
[1943.70 - 1949.52] hey this person was hanging off a cliff
[1946.52 - 1953.06] they were rock climbing I think and some
[1949.52 - 1955.52] helicopter had to come and get them
[1953.06 - 1956.90] oh really the helicopter had to come and
[1955.52 - 1960.02] get them they were hanging off the cliff
[1956.90 - 1962.66] okay let me tell somebody else about
[1960.02 - 1964.88] this this is unbelievable yeah that the
[1962.66 - 1967.52] Coast Guard had to come and help
[1964.88 - 1969.44] somebody that was like they fell off the
[1967.52 - 1971.30] cliff and they were they were at the
[1969.44 - 1976.10] rocks at the bottom of the cliff and the
[1971.30 - 1976.10] Coast Guard had to come yeah exactly
[1978.02 - 1982.94] and that's how it works
[1980.78 - 1985.10] Health list says the fact that we can
[1982.94 - 1986.84] have contamination is such Advanced
[1985.10 - 1988.52] information you won't find that in
[1986.84 - 1990.32] neuroscience
[1988.52 - 1992.36] I'll tell you what you find in
[1990.32 - 1994.94] neuroscience
[1992.36 - 1997.76] five top foods that are really helpful
[1994.94 - 1999.98] for the brain one is Cacao chocolate
[1997.76 - 2001.84] science is actually saying chocolate's
[1999.98 - 2004.54] getting better for the brain Than People
[2001.84 - 2006.22] another one is mushrooms you know the
[2004.54 - 2009.24] kind of mushrooms
[2006.22 - 2012.04] that's another one too psychedelics
[2009.24 - 2014.98] another one is something that helps your
[2012.04 - 2018.58] tear telomeres you're telomeres we're
[2014.98 - 2020.28] finding that genes are are a big role in
[2018.58 - 2022.90] our brains
[2020.28 - 2025.48] another food source for your brains is
[2022.90 - 2027.58] apple cider vinegar everybody should be
[2025.48 - 2030.12] on a shot of that a day
[2027.58 - 2032.56] and number five
[2030.12 - 2034.90] some red wine
[2032.56 - 2038.82] because red wine is the greatest of all
[2034.90 - 2038.82] I bought a Vineyard a matter of fact
[2039.54 - 2044.80] Melanie Belling says I am a teacher for
[2042.22 - 2048.04] communication and that makes many
[2044.80 - 2050.20] communication problems so clear
[2048.04 - 2053.62] I am at your service I'm trying my best
[2050.20 - 2056.20] to message the information from above so
[2053.62 - 2057.76] that teachers like you can teach
[2056.20 - 2060.10] incredible and I'm sure you're an
[2057.76 - 2061.54] amazing teacher Beverly Harvey says how
[2060.10 - 2064.78] can you tell the difference between
[2061.54 - 2066.82] someone who is an evil soul and someone
[2064.78 - 2068.98] who acts badly because of toxins and
[2066.82 - 2071.08] metals in their brain oh my God that's
[2068.98 - 2073.30] an incredible question and I'm going to
[2071.08 - 2075.70] screen sheet that question because I
[2073.30 - 2076.78] want to do a podcast episode on that
[2075.70 - 2078.46] question
[2076.78 - 2082.50] and then have Spirit of compassion
[2078.46 - 2082.50] answer it because that's going to be fun
[2083.68 - 2091.62] okay okay okay I lost my spot
[2087.58 - 2091.62] I lost my spot sorry about all this
[2092.50 - 2095.86] all right electricity can carry
[2094.06 - 2097.36] tremendous amount tremendous amounts of
[2095.86 - 2099.70] information
[2097.36 - 2101.68] electricity you guys that's your
[2099.70 - 2103.24] thoughts electricity in your brain
[2101.68 - 2105.28] carries a thought
[2103.24 - 2107.68] it travels
[2105.28 - 2111.52] through your brain that electricity
[2107.68 - 2113.38] electrical impulse has information in it
[2111.52 - 2115.72] so the electricity running through the
[2113.38 - 2118.78] brain is more than just a hot wire it's
[2115.72 - 2121.30] not just life-giving vitalization hot
[2118.78 - 2124.12] wires keeping us alive electrical
[2121.30 - 2126.40] currents no it's not just that it's
[2124.12 - 2128.56] information that's in the electricity
[2126.40 - 2130.84] itself and then information has to
[2128.56 - 2132.28] travel from neuron to neuron so that
[2130.84 - 2133.66] information goes from one part of the
[2132.28 - 2136.12] brain to another part of the brain and
[2133.66 - 2138.04] if you got toxins in there that's when
[2136.12 - 2139.96] that information go to one part of the
[2138.04 - 2142.20] brain goes the other part of brain gets
[2139.96 - 2145.24] skewed up you're talking too fast now
[2142.20 - 2147.88] electricity traveling through your brain
[2145.24 - 2149.56] can even carry information you won't or
[2147.88 - 2151.60] don't use
[2149.56 - 2153.52] that's interesting right there
[2151.60 - 2155.26] electricity traveling through your brain
[2153.52 - 2156.64] can carry information you're not even
[2155.26 - 2158.98] going to use
[2156.64 - 2161.68] it's there it's there for the taking
[2158.98 - 2163.30] with the electricity and we let it slip
[2161.68 - 2165.94] by because we're focused on another
[2163.30 - 2168.40] piece of information I'm focused on this
[2165.94 - 2171.10] candy bar I want to eat
[2168.40 - 2173.02] but in that same piece of information I
[2171.10 - 2176.26] I see a candy bar
[2173.02 - 2178.18] I'm at Whole Foods I don't want that
[2176.26 - 2179.62] candy bar right there it's it's a
[2178.18 - 2181.24] healthy one it says it's healthy it
[2179.62 - 2182.38] doesn't have any added sugar or anything
[2181.24 - 2185.50] like that
[2182.38 - 2187.78] I want to grab that candy bar
[2185.50 - 2191.92] but in that same moment you're you're
[2187.78 - 2193.12] thinking that that Pete that wire that
[2191.92 - 2195.70] hot wire
[2193.12 - 2197.14] that let's glimpulse has something else
[2195.70 - 2199.84] in there
[2197.14 - 2203.02] something else is in there you ready
[2199.84 - 2205.24] what's in there is that candy bar I
[2203.02 - 2207.64] don't think is good for me
[2205.24 - 2209.80] because I heard somewhere maybe even
[2207.64 - 2212.44] from the medical medium
[2209.80 - 2214.42] the chocolate is actually really toxic
[2212.44 - 2217.12] but nobody knows that
[2214.42 - 2220.42] but yet they're not accessing that piece
[2217.12 - 2222.88] of information they're only accessing
[2220.42 - 2224.98] I really want that candy bar and that's
[2222.88 - 2228.12] the only part they access within that
[2224.98 - 2228.12] information on that neuron
[2228.28 - 2231.78] we're trying to tell someone something
[2229.84 - 2234.28] that we're getting from that electricity
[2231.78 - 2236.20] and at the same time leaving out
[2234.28 - 2238.54] information that's within that
[2236.20 - 2240.16] electricity as well I'm only going to
[2238.54 - 2242.38] tell you the parts of the story that I
[2240.16 - 2244.62] want to tell you I'm kind of leaving the
[2242.38 - 2244.62] rest
[2245.14 - 2248.98] I'm going to tell you what happened the
[2247.66 - 2252.10] pickup truck
[2248.98 - 2254.14] rolled into town
[2252.10 - 2256.24] and the tire blew out of that pickup
[2254.14 - 2258.22] truck
[2256.24 - 2261.28] but I'm gonna leave out the rest of that
[2258.22 - 2263.02] information you know the truck ran over
[2261.28 - 2265.42] some nails
[2263.02 - 2266.74] it's so strange how our brains work it's
[2265.42 - 2268.24] insane
[2266.74 - 2269.92] we're trying to tell someone something
[2268.24 - 2271.72] that we're getting from that electricity
[2269.92 - 2273.76] at the same time leaving out information
[2271.72 - 2275.56] that's within that same electricity as
[2273.76 - 2277.06] well we may feel there was something
[2275.56 - 2278.38] more to say oh my God here's what
[2277.06 - 2280.60] happens if you ever have something on
[2278.38 - 2282.52] the tip of your tongue
[2280.60 - 2285.54] we call it on the tip of your tongue
[2282.52 - 2289.24] right it's on the tip of my tongue
[2285.54 - 2291.22] what the heck was it gotta tell you
[2289.24 - 2293.32] something I gotta tell you something
[2291.22 - 2295.60] yeah yeah no no I already told you that
[2293.32 - 2298.66] no no I already told you that
[2295.60 - 2302.56] I told you about that this is something
[2298.66 - 2305.62] else what is it what is it
[2302.56 - 2307.72] what am I thinking right now
[2305.62 - 2310.74] do you ever have something on the tip of
[2307.72 - 2312.94] your tongue right
[2310.74 - 2314.32] it's on the top of my head somewhere
[2312.94 - 2318.22] it's in the tip of my tongue somewhere
[2314.32 - 2321.28] it's somewhere what was it
[2318.22 - 2323.44] we may feel there was something more to
[2321.28 - 2326.02] say yet we don't know what it really was
[2323.44 - 2328.96] because it has already passed us by the
[2326.02 - 2330.82] reason why we actually don't know what
[2328.96 - 2332.50] it is in that moment it's on the tip of
[2330.82 - 2335.44] our tongue it's because it passed by
[2332.50 - 2340.24] already in that electricity through that
[2335.44 - 2343.66] neuron and we didn't grab it as it was
[2340.24 - 2346.06] passing by we did not access what that
[2343.66 - 2348.94] was it was on the tip of my tongue man
[2346.06 - 2351.40] and I didn't access it is what happened
[2348.94 - 2354.70] we did not grab it out of that
[2351.40 - 2356.86] electrical grid that it was passing
[2354.70 - 2359.20] through that neuron it passed it was
[2356.86 - 2360.10] there you knew it was there you know it
[2359.20 - 2363.24] was there
[2360.10 - 2363.24] what was it
[2368.20 - 2374.92] were you going to say something else
[2370.84 - 2378.10] your partner or companion or friend says
[2374.92 - 2379.78] and we may reply yeah I was so busy with
[2378.10 - 2383.08] other thoughts I can't remember what it
[2379.78 - 2385.60] was we're not having a memory lapse I
[2383.08 - 2388.24] just don't have a good memory I can't
[2385.60 - 2390.94] remember what it was I was saying what
[2388.24 - 2393.16] the hell was I thinking or saying I was
[2390.94 - 2395.38] saying something I know where it was it
[2393.16 - 2397.30] was on the tip of my tongue my memory
[2395.38 - 2399.88] must be going I'm losing my memories
[2397.30 - 2402.04] what was happening
[2399.88 - 2405.24] you weren't losing your memory you
[2402.04 - 2405.24] didn't have the memory laughs
[2407.68 - 2414.34] it's like medical medium said this
[2411.40 - 2416.32] that's not what medical medium said
[2414.34 - 2417.40] do you guys see that out there wait I
[2416.32 - 2419.14] want to ask you guys this do you guys
[2417.40 - 2422.02] see this out there
[2419.14 - 2424.66] medical medium said this
[2422.02 - 2427.60] but medical medium didn't say that right
[2424.66 - 2429.64] it happens too
[2427.60 - 2431.94] I did everything medical medium and
[2429.64 - 2435.28] didn't work it did not work for me
[2431.94 - 2437.14] you didn't do everything medical medium
[2435.28 - 2438.64] I did everything medical medium it
[2437.14 - 2441.34] didn't work
[2438.64 - 2444.04] I mean if I only was a fly on the wall
[2441.34 - 2445.84] the I would see with people who
[2444.04 - 2447.88] have said that that evolved that like
[2445.84 - 2451.36] there's people on there that are paid to
[2447.88 - 2453.58] say that all over Instagram they're paid
[2451.36 - 2456.22] to go on there and say that and they
[2453.58 - 2457.90] don't even do anything medical medium
[2456.22 - 2459.70] and if I was to fly on the wall for the
[2457.90 - 2461.50] people that do do some medical medium
[2459.70 - 2463.30] stuff a little bit of stuff and they say
[2461.50 - 2465.40] I tried everything medical medium I did
[2463.30 - 2467.02] that it didn't work and here flying the
[2465.40 - 2468.82] wall and you see what they eat and you
[2467.02 - 2470.44] see what they do I'm not judging them
[2468.82 - 2472.00] but if you see what they eat and what
[2470.44 - 2475.00] they do
[2472.00 - 2478.20] uh they had everything happen they've
[2475.00 - 2481.30] went and gone they've also gone
[2478.20 - 2483.52] we've also done this they've also done
[2481.30 - 2485.80] that
[2483.52 - 2488.44] they've eaten this
[2485.80 - 2490.48] they've gone here they've gone there
[2488.44 - 2493.02] I've tried everything medical medium and
[2490.48 - 2493.02] it didn't work
[2495.82 - 2499.78] you know
[2498.22 - 2501.90] okay I just want to read a little bit of
[2499.78 - 2501.90] this
[2502.54 - 2508.24] it's crazy some of the stuff
[2505.96 - 2510.40] you didn't have the memory lapse that
[2508.24 - 2511.36] was what I was talking about okay you
[2510.40 - 2514.66] just
[2511.36 - 2516.70] did not access or couldn't access that
[2514.66 - 2519.48] information that was passing by and
[2516.70 - 2519.48] there might be a reason
[2520.66 - 2524.44] those same people that say I tried ever
[2522.52 - 2526.30] here's what's crazy here's a funny thing
[2524.44 - 2527.62] right here okay I know I go off topic
[2526.30 - 2529.78] sometimes I can't help it it's not
[2527.62 - 2531.16] really off topic it's on topic you ready
[2529.78 - 2533.62] there's some people out there that'll
[2531.16 - 2534.64] say I tried medical medium and it didn't
[2533.62 - 2537.40] work
[2534.64 - 2539.68] those are the same people I find out put
[2537.40 - 2543.28] lemon juice in their celery juice
[2539.68 - 2546.36] those are but they think
[2543.28 - 2546.36] they did it right
[2547.06 - 2552.10] or those are people that like put water
[2549.34 - 2553.84] in their celery juice or
[2552.10 - 2556.96] we're only drinking four ounces of
[2553.84 - 2558.10] celery juice a day a cup of celery juice
[2556.96 - 2560.20] a day
[2558.10 - 2561.82] eight ounces or something you know what
[2560.20 - 2564.30] I mean and they say I tried all medical
[2561.82 - 2564.30] medium
[2565.12 - 2570.28] brain neuron problems
[2567.82 - 2571.66] you know can also make it like that a
[2570.28 - 2573.22] lot of people they're sick they don't
[2571.66 - 2574.30] have look a lot of people are struggling
[2573.22 - 2577.06] and this is
[2574.30 - 2578.74] this is why like when people
[2577.06 - 2581.08] say things
[2578.74 - 2584.32] like that and it's not really accurate
[2581.08 - 2586.54] to what's happening I never freak out I
[2584.32 - 2588.88] just feel bad I feel bad because I know
[2586.54 - 2591.58] the person if they're not a paid troll I
[2588.88 - 2593.92] know the person actually thinks they are
[2591.58 - 2596.50] doing everything medical medium so I'm
[2593.92 - 2597.82] not judging them I mean yeah fly in the
[2596.50 - 2600.64] wall sure and you'll see what they're
[2597.82 - 2603.04] doing and it's like oh dear lord what
[2600.64 - 2605.32] like what do they you know what I mean
[2603.04 - 2607.24] you see that right and it's like oh no
[2605.32 - 2608.44] they're not doing medical medium and
[2607.24 - 2609.58] then or all of a sudden they'll do a
[2608.44 - 2611.08] post out there or something and you'll
[2609.58 - 2613.38] see you'll see it that way too and
[2611.08 - 2613.38] you're like
[2614.40 - 2619.48] so what happens is that but they think
[2617.02 - 2621.82] they are they think they did they think
[2619.48 - 2624.22] they did the medical medium stuff
[2621.82 - 2627.10] they like got rid of like
[2624.22 - 2629.38] dairy products for like a month and
[2627.10 - 2631.96] they're like I did medical medium
[2629.38 - 2633.88] but their brain neuron problem kind of
[2631.96 - 2635.50] like falls into it whether they then
[2633.88 - 2637.12] they convince themselves I did medical
[2635.50 - 2640.12] medium and then they go on social media
[2637.12 - 2641.86] like no I did medical medium
[2640.12 - 2644.86] yep I did not mean it didn't work for me
[2641.86 - 2646.60] don't do it it's bad it doesn't work
[2644.86 - 2647.80] because they weren't underst they
[2646.60 - 2650.50] weren't able to even understand the
[2647.80 - 2652.36] information I mean honestly
[2650.50 - 2655.12] I'm gonna tell you this right because
[2652.36 - 2658.54] I'm not a rocket scientist
[2655.12 - 2661.78] I'm not an educated medical doctor
[2658.54 - 2665.62] I'm not a um whatever
[2661.78 - 2667.84] this is this is a lot of information
[2665.62 - 2670.06] so I can't judge people if they can't
[2667.84 - 2671.14] really like uneven understand what
[2670.06 - 2672.34] they're reading there's people out there
[2671.14 - 2674.52] that said they read the book and I'm
[2672.34 - 2677.26] like what
[2674.52 - 2678.34] and they're eating an egg sandwich
[2677.26 - 2680.02] see
[2678.34 - 2681.64] no no I read the book and they're eating
[2680.02 - 2683.50] an egg sandwich I said you know that you
[2681.64 - 2685.96] know I talk about why you shouldn't eat
[2683.50 - 2687.28] eggs in in the books like you did what
[2685.96 - 2689.46] do you mean I didn't even I missed that
[2687.28 - 2689.46] part
[2690.10 - 2694.90] okay damaged neurons can change thoughts
[2693.10 - 2697.38] altering how someone perceives
[2694.90 - 2697.38] information
[2699.46 - 2702.46] damaged neurons
[2701.32 - 2705.64] can
[2702.46 - 2708.34] change thoughts so that someone's
[2705.64 - 2710.50] perception of what they're hearing is
[2708.34 - 2712.54] like right
[2710.50 - 2714.28] that's because damaged neurons mean
[2712.54 - 2716.86] altered disorganized and poorly
[2714.28 - 2719.88] reorganized electricity so here's what
[2716.86 - 2722.88] I'm saying it's electricity that's all
[2719.88 - 2725.98] kind of like
[2722.88 - 2729.34] all distorted it's electricity
[2725.98 - 2732.10] that's disorganized then reorganized
[2729.34 - 2733.96] then altered
[2732.10 - 2736.42] as that electricity travels through
[2733.96 - 2738.46] synapsis and heads to another group of
[2736.42 - 2740.62] neurons
[2738.46 - 2742.42] information in that electricity could
[2740.62 - 2745.78] become disorganized before it enters a
[2742.42 - 2748.38] new group of neurons information
[2745.78 - 2748.38] right
[2749.14 - 2754.36] can like get reorganized and go to
[2751.72 - 2757.00] another group of neurons
[2754.36 - 2758.32] Vegeta says a lot of people think their
[2757.00 - 2760.30] symptoms
[2758.32 - 2764.38] sorry I'll start this again a lot of
[2760.30 - 2768.16] people think their symptoms are detox
[2764.38 - 2770.04] symptoms when that isn't the case
[2768.16 - 2773.44] correct
[2770.04 - 2776.14] whoa like this is a hot spot right here
[2773.44 - 2780.16] this is no joke I'm actually working on
[2776.14 - 2782.50] a detox podcast right now I'm working on
[2780.16 - 2786.64] one it's not for the faint of heart it
[2782.50 - 2789.10] is a serious episode and it's kicking my
[2786.64 - 2791.92] ass right now because there's so much
[2789.10 - 2793.60] information in this episode that I'm
[2791.92 - 2795.58] just like oh
[2793.60 - 2797.74] a lot of people think their symptoms are
[2795.58 - 2800.50] detox says
[2797.74 - 2802.48] on YouTube symptoms when that isn't the
[2800.50 - 2804.88] case if you are doing what medical
[2802.48 - 2807.46] medium recommends then anything beyond
[2804.88 - 2808.66] very mild symptoms are from something
[2807.46 - 2811.38] else
[2808.66 - 2811.38] it's very wise
[2813.16 - 2816.94] okay
[2814.90 - 2818.86] check this out too and if any of the
[2816.94 - 2820.48] neurons in that new group are damaged
[2818.86 - 2822.40] hindered or injured when the information
[2820.48 - 2825.64] gathered by that electricity gets
[2822.40 - 2827.62] disorganized once again and it leaves
[2825.64 - 2829.48] another group of neuron so okay let me
[2827.62 - 2831.58] just say this
[2829.48 - 2833.32] the information is traveling through
[2831.58 - 2836.50] electricity it hits a group of neurons
[2833.32 - 2839.08] that are all clouded up with toxins then
[2836.50 - 2840.70] get scrambled and then leaves that group
[2839.08 - 2842.44] of neurons and enters another group of
[2840.70 - 2844.12] neurons
[2842.44 - 2846.52] so it's not just brain tissue that
[2844.12 - 2848.20] Harbors thoughts and controls controls
[2846.52 - 2850.30] how we feel and how we physically
[2848.20 - 2852.46] function electricity itself has also the
[2850.30 - 2855.34] power over our thoughts and physical
[2852.46 - 2856.90] control it's not medical research and
[2855.34 - 2859.74] science has no idea the electricity
[2856.90 - 2859.74] Harbors a thought
[2860.74 - 2865.62] they think it's the thought it's just in
[2862.84 - 2865.62] the brain tissue
[2866.62 - 2870.88] one job of neurons is to eventually pass
[2869.26 - 2872.32] along information to the brain's
[2870.88 - 2874.18] billions of glial cells where
[2872.32 - 2876.16] information stays stored cataloged and
[2874.18 - 2878.14] organized if glial cells are clogged
[2876.16 - 2880.24] contaminated saturated distorted or even
[2878.14 - 2882.04] mutated from poisons and toxins that
[2880.24 - 2883.48] disconnect and break down can occur
[2882.04 - 2885.64] between your neuron system and your
[2883.48 - 2887.02] glial cell system glial cells can lose
[2885.64 - 2888.94] their ability to properly store
[2887.02 - 2891.52] information so basically your glial
[2888.94 - 2893.74] stores storage glial cell storage can
[2891.52 - 2897.16] get all contaminated
[2893.74 - 2899.44] and really toxic and when thoughts are
[2897.16 - 2902.14] stored in that contaminated toxic Arena
[2899.44 - 2904.42] that's another problem all on its own
[2902.14 - 2905.80] some neurons in the brain not all have
[2904.42 - 2907.60] the ability to spot check and
[2905.80 - 2909.34] cross-reference new information with old
[2907.60 - 2911.04] information so we do have a safe fault
[2909.34 - 2914.80] in here where some neurons are like
[2911.04 - 2916.36] correct corrected corrected correct it
[2914.80 - 2917.98] correct it there's neurons in our brain
[2916.36 - 2920.56] they're like no we're here to correct
[2917.98 - 2922.18] all that skewed information it's amazing
[2920.56 - 2923.86] Who would know this
[2922.18 - 2926.38] Who would know this
[2923.86 - 2928.14] if you have a hard time I'm hearing this
[2926.38 - 2931.78] more and more if you have a hard time
[2928.14 - 2934.48] thinking or believing
[2931.78 - 2935.62] that these eight incredible books of
[2934.48 - 2938.44] information
[2935.62 - 2940.78] life-saving information came from above
[2938.44 - 2943.30] if you have a hard time believing that
[2940.78 - 2946.54] and that's in your way like you you're
[2943.30 - 2947.62] just like this guy's hearing a
[2946.54 - 2949.72] voice
[2947.62 - 2951.82] right if you're having a hard time and
[2949.72 - 2953.38] you believe that
[2951.82 - 2955.36] if it makes you feel better just think
[2953.38 - 2956.92] I'm a genius
[2955.36 - 2958.90] it's not a voice
[2956.92 - 2961.30] and I'm a genius
[2958.90 - 2963.82] anything to make sure you get the
[2961.30 - 2965.26] information in this resource so you can
[2963.82 - 2968.14] protect yourself your family friends and
[2965.26 - 2970.72] heal so just you can be like
[2968.14 - 2974.50] he doesn't hear a voice he's just a
[2970.72 - 2978.78] genius then find whatever it takes
[2974.50 - 2978.78] I can promise you this I'm not a genius
[2979.00 - 2986.88] definitely not a genius
[2982.42 - 2986.88] I wish I was that would be pretty cool
[2988.54 - 2991.54] some neurons in the brain not all have
[2990.28 - 2993.16] the ability to spot check and
[2991.54 - 2997.00] cross-reference the information like I
[2993.16 - 2999.94] said when healthy when okay when healthy
[2997.00 - 3001.92] these neurons have infinite access to
[2999.94 - 3004.02] glial storage so here's there's neurons
[3001.92 - 3007.56] in our brain that have access to our
[3004.02 - 3009.30] memories in the gliobank electricity
[3007.56 - 3010.98] shoots out or waves from these neurons
[3009.30 - 3012.42] rolling along real cells to gather
[3010.98 - 3014.52] information and then the electricity
[3012.42 - 3016.92] filled that real cell information rolls
[3014.52 - 3019.92] back to the neurons that is utterly
[3016.92 - 3019.92] insane
[3020.70 - 3026.40] get ready for this when electricity hits
[3023.28 - 3029.10] a damaged neuron on the other hand small
[3026.40 - 3031.38] outward explosions occur off the neuron
[3029.10 - 3034.86] kind of like salt kind of like solar
[3031.38 - 3037.58] flares off the sun these flares enter
[3034.86 - 3041.16] adjacent brain tissue and glial cells
[3037.58 - 3043.02] Gathering bits and pieces of information
[3041.16 - 3046.26] and then subside and re-enter the
[3043.02 - 3049.80] neurons okay that is like what the heck
[3046.26 - 3053.52] when that information came down
[3049.80 - 3056.66] from above I was just like how do I even
[3053.52 - 3056.66] talk about this
[3058.86 - 3063.78] so when electricity hits damaged neurons
[3061.38 - 3066.48] it explodes
[3063.78 - 3068.16] and small explosions occur and
[3066.48 - 3069.84] leave
[3068.16 - 3073.02] and enter
[3069.84 - 3074.70] into uh into the glial cells Gathering
[3073.02 - 3077.00] bits a piece of information and coming
[3074.70 - 3077.00] back
[3077.70 - 3082.26] since the neurons by the way
[3080.34 - 3084.36] 20 years from now whatever it is or
[3082.26 - 3086.28] maybe even tomorrow a podcast doctor
[3084.36 - 3087.90] will be talking about this this they
[3086.28 - 3089.88] won't have a study that actually shows
[3087.90 - 3092.40] anything they'll say they do or
[3089.88 - 3094.86] something or not even they'll just use
[3092.40 - 3096.96] this 20 years from now this is just
[3094.86 - 3099.42] going to be literally the Forefront of
[3096.96 - 3101.40] brain inflammation
[3099.42 - 3103.80] we're we're at a really difficult
[3101.40 - 3105.54] situation now medical medium and our
[3103.80 - 3107.88] team and everything else
[3105.54 - 3109.56] cooling Spirit of compassion where the
[3107.88 - 3112.28] thefting and poaching of medical medium
[3109.56 - 3115.20] information for Sciences use is utterly
[3112.28 - 3116.58] at an unbelievable level right now
[3115.20 - 3118.26] including
[3116.58 - 3119.46] people in Alternative Health in every
[3118.26 - 3121.62] world
[3119.46 - 3123.78] and the poaching and not citing has
[3121.62 - 3126.00] become actually disgusting it is at a
[3123.78 - 3127.80] point where
[3126.00 - 3130.92] you guys
[3127.80 - 3133.44] I can't even go there right
[3130.92 - 3135.30] anyway there's so much information here
[3133.44 - 3138.12] I'm just going through it a little bit
[3135.30 - 3139.62] so I'm on page 14 of brain saver
[3138.12 - 3141.42] so maybe let's cut through a little bit
[3139.62 - 3143.52] more if you guys have have you know it
[3141.42 - 3145.50] in you
[3143.52 - 3147.84] meaning like all of us here because we
[3145.50 - 3149.10] want to make the shot we want to make
[3147.84 - 3151.50] the shot
[3149.10 - 3153.54] the reason we can each experience the
[3151.50 - 3155.40] same event so differently from each
[3153.54 - 3157.62] other is because of our damaged neurons
[3155.40 - 3161.52] leading to disorganized information
[3157.62 - 3164.16] someone can say no I
[3161.52 - 3168.36] saw a spaceship
[3164.16 - 3170.64] it landed behind those woods
[3168.36 - 3172.44] and another person would be like that
[3170.64 - 3174.66] wasn't a spaceship
[3172.44 - 3176.88] that was car lights
[3174.66 - 3177.84] coming off the highway the distant
[3176.88 - 3180.84] Highway
[3177.84 - 3183.78] another person's like no I saw a
[3180.84 - 3186.00] spaceship you don't get it it really did
[3183.78 - 3188.04] land I saw what happened it had lights
[3186.00 - 3190.28] on it and that spaceship came down it
[3188.04 - 3190.28] was like
[3191.64 - 3195.60] and landed behind those woods and then
[3194.10 - 3198.18] this other person who saw the same thing
[3195.60 - 3199.08] is like no I didn't see a spaceship yeah
[3198.18 - 3201.36] but
[3199.08 - 3203.64] yeah but it was there no I saw
[3201.36 - 3205.02] headlights you know the truck was
[3203.64 - 3206.40] getting off the highway way in the
[3205.02 - 3207.90] distance down there and I saw flashing
[3206.40 - 3209.64] lights from it you know that's your
[3207.90 - 3211.62] perception that's what you think you saw
[3209.64 - 3213.60] but there was a spaceship that landed
[3211.62 - 3217.22] behind the woods and there really was a
[3213.60 - 3217.22] spaceship that landed behind the woods
[3219.36 - 3223.02] so the reason we can each experience the
[3221.52 - 3224.82] same event so differently from each
[3223.02 - 3227.16] other is because of our damaged neurons
[3224.82 - 3229.32] leading to disorganized information in
[3227.16 - 3231.18] the end we may not all give an accurate
[3229.32 - 3232.98] account of what happens so that person's
[3231.18 - 3234.48] like no there was no spaceship that was
[3232.98 - 3236.40] car had lights another person's like I
[3234.48 - 3238.74] promise you behind that behind that
[3236.40 - 3241.02] small mountain is the spaceship that
[3238.74 - 3243.84] landed in those woods Carrie Pearson
[3241.02 - 3245.64] said it's so us exclamation point I just
[3243.84 - 3248.58] saw another big article
[3245.64 - 3251.28] sitting citing your information and not
[3248.58 - 3254.76] crediting you but citing Stanford oh I
[3251.28 - 3258.06] got it citing my information to Stanford
[3254.76 - 3259.50] and it was word for word your info yeah
[3258.06 - 3261.48] they're doing that all the time right
[3259.50 - 3263.16] now it's so sad because that means no
[3261.48 - 3264.90] citing means no one will know where it
[3263.16 - 3266.04] came from but they'll think that they're
[3264.90 - 3267.42] smart
[3266.04 - 3268.86] and then when someone mentions that
[3267.42 - 3272.06] mentions mm they'll be like oh that
[3268.86 - 3272.06] Medium God he's not smart
[3272.16 - 3275.60] it's actually really bad
[3276.18 - 3279.48] and then that person will go off and do
[3277.92 - 3280.74] bad stuff to hurt themselves and they're
[3279.48 - 3282.12] sick for another 10 years because
[3280.74 - 3283.56] they'll never trust the medical medium
[3282.12 - 3286.14] in a million years because they heard so
[3283.56 - 3287.40] much bad stuff by the way you guys the
[3286.14 - 3289.08] hit piece is coming out of me
[3287.40 - 3291.18] periodically over the years and the hit
[3289.08 - 3292.92] pieces that are on their way because
[3291.18 - 3295.26] that's what's just always happening to
[3292.92 - 3297.36] me with all the just stories
[3295.26 - 3300.30] and lies is unbelievable the media has
[3297.36 - 3301.98] never ever represented well actually no
[3300.30 - 3304.26] that's not true there has been some
[3301.98 - 3306.90] media Outlets that have that have had my
[3304.26 - 3308.40] back but for the most part most all
[3306.90 - 3312.62] don't
[3308.40 - 3312.62] you know and definitely not fully
[3313.26 - 3317.40] say we were camping out by a lake with
[3315.36 - 3320.46] friends in a flashing light flew through
[3317.40 - 3322.92] the sky one person may say I was there
[3320.46 - 3324.96] and it was a firefly
[3322.92 - 3327.84] someone else may say
[3324.96 - 3330.54] I was there too it was a falling star
[3327.84 - 3332.70] someone else believed it was a distant
[3330.54 - 3335.40] headlight from a truck farther off
[3332.70 - 3337.98] toward the horizon
[3335.40 - 3340.20] one person thought it was a firefly
[3337.98 - 3341.76] another person's you know thought it was
[3340.20 - 3344.04] a falling star and somebody else thought
[3341.76 - 3345.78] it was a truck it's a different thing
[3344.04 - 3347.70] one than the spaceship thing I was
[3345.78 - 3349.38] saying but all the same
[3347.70 - 3351.30] this understanding of our neurons
[3349.38 - 3352.98] impeded functioning is why when we ask
[3351.30 - 3354.96] if someone's feeling okay we should
[3352.98 - 3357.24] really ask how's the electricity in your
[3354.96 - 3359.22] brain it's like are you okay today how
[3357.24 - 3361.44] you feeling today it's more like
[3359.22 - 3364.34] how's the electricity going through your
[3361.44 - 3364.34] neurons today
[3365.76 - 3370.14] are they disorganized
[3368.16 - 3371.16] how are the neuro how are your neurons
[3370.14 - 3373.08] today
[3371.16 - 3375.36] have any of them repaired from your
[3373.08 - 3377.10] night's sleep have your neurons repaired
[3375.36 - 3379.14] from your night's sleep
[3377.10 - 3380.76] have your glial cells been heating up
[3379.14 - 3382.86] too much lately
[3380.76 - 3385.44] are your neurons saturated into toxins
[3382.86 - 3387.24] today communicating about our brains at
[3385.44 - 3389.52] this level would bring about a whole new
[3387.24 - 3391.32] understanding of our health conditions
[3389.52 - 3394.44] and well-being
[3391.32 - 3396.80] [Music]
[3394.44 - 3396.80] all right
[3397.50 - 3401.82] we're in this incredible speaking your
[3399.90 - 3403.38] truth stabilizer that was just really
[3401.82 - 3404.58] really incredible killer brain
[3403.38 - 3407.34] inflammation
[3404.58 - 3409.20] that you know that I want to show you
[3407.34 - 3410.88] from Spirit of compassion but we're
[3409.20 - 3412.74] doing speaking your treat stabilizer
[3410.88 - 3415.62] right now
[3412.74 - 3417.00] that information I just read you
[3415.62 - 3419.00] is
[3417.00 - 3422.16] really profound
[3419.00 - 3424.74] mind-blowing when I wrote that
[3422.16 - 3428.00] information down
[3424.74 - 3428.00] I was mind blown
[3429.06 - 3433.82] all right we're good speaking your truth
[3431.10 - 3433.82] stabilizer
[3435.30 - 3439.86] I'm gonna put the brain back together a
[3438.12 - 3442.40] little bit right there
[3439.86 - 3442.40] foreign
[3445.86 - 3450.98] all right
[3448.02 - 3450.98] let's do this
[3451.68 - 3455.18] I have my juicer in front of me
[3456.12 - 3460.20] look
[3457.62 - 3463.98] it's no secret
[3460.20 - 3466.32] I get asked about celery juice
[3463.98 - 3468.96] thousands upon thousands upon thousands
[3466.32 - 3470.88] of times it's a wonder I haven't lost my
[3468.96 - 3473.22] mind completely right
[3470.88 - 3475.98] because the questions are this
[3473.22 - 3479.16] can I I'm doing celery juice and I put
[3475.98 - 3480.84] lemon in it I doing celery juice from
[3479.16 - 3483.12] the store
[3480.84 - 3485.04] that was in a bottle you know what I
[3483.12 - 3486.72] mean whatever
[3485.04 - 3489.00] I'm doing this all these things and then
[3486.72 - 3491.88] what juicer do you use what juicer do
[3489.00 - 3494.40] you use and I get questions like that
[3491.88 - 3496.32] over and over and over again anyway this
[3494.40 - 3500.22] is the MN 1500 I'm using right now
[3496.32 - 3501.00] mm-900 is another incredible juicer
[3500.22 - 3503.82] um
[3501.00 - 3505.74] and so every day it's like when is the
[3503.82 - 3507.66] sale when is the sale when is the sale
[3505.74 - 3510.00] so there's a sale right now on the 1500
[3507.66 - 3511.56] 900 just letting everybody know if I
[3510.00 - 3514.26] don't say it what's going to happen is
[3511.56 - 3516.60] after the sale is over people are going
[3514.26 - 3519.12] to ask it's 20 off right now it's an
[3516.60 - 3520.86] opportunity for someone
[3519.12 - 3523.56] you know to actually get an incredible G
[3520.86 - 3525.42] sure so why is it a great User it's cold
[3523.56 - 3526.58] press masticating juicer which is
[3525.42 - 3529.62] incredible
[3526.58 - 3530.88] it's saves people money the food costs
[3529.62 - 3534.30] are rising
[3530.88 - 3535.68] they're Rising now here's something I
[3534.30 - 3537.12] wanted to say real quick before we make
[3535.68 - 3540.08] this job
[3537.12 - 3543.54] I could have started a medical medium
[3540.08 - 3547.62] juicing company 20 years ago
[3543.54 - 3550.02] okay and been asked to do so and
[3547.62 - 3552.96] literally I could be known as the juicer
[3550.02 - 3554.76] guy and that's not what I did and we
[3552.96 - 3557.88] don't want to do that
[3554.76 - 3560.82] but food costs were rising and I noticed
[3557.88 - 3563.64] the juicers out there
[3560.82 - 3567.36] we're not squeezing enough juice out of
[3563.64 - 3570.42] the out of the produce and people who
[3567.36 - 3572.88] need to use these medical machines to
[3570.42 - 3577.08] heal and get better
[3572.88 - 3579.72] don't have a lot of money
[3577.08 - 3582.90] sure rich people get sick too
[3579.72 - 3585.48] okay and I get it and it probably rich
[3582.90 - 3587.52] people who have a billion dollars can
[3585.48 - 3588.90] buy all the produce they want and it
[3587.52 - 3589.98] doesn't matter what juicer they use I
[3588.90 - 3592.92] guess
[3589.98 - 3596.10] but the point is
[3592.92 - 3598.44] is that the prices Sonia said celery
[3596.10 - 3600.12] prices went up too like the food costs
[3598.44 - 3602.34] are insane right
[3600.12 - 3605.88] but I don't want people to lose chances
[3602.34 - 3609.48] of using medicinal tools that can help
[3605.88 - 3613.74] them heal so I got involved with the mm
[3609.48 - 3616.02] 1500 mm-900 for a reason because I knew
[3613.74 - 3618.78] through Spirit of compassion that we
[3616.02 - 3621.54] were again gonna get a huge food cost
[3618.78 - 3624.54] increase in the world and that's meat
[3621.54 - 3626.88] that's beef that's grass-fed beef that's
[3624.54 - 3629.76] Dairy that's eggs that's wheat that's
[3626.88 - 3632.04] fruits that's vegetables that's nuts
[3629.76 - 3633.96] that's seeds whatever it is
[3632.04 - 3638.28] whatever anybody eats on this planet
[3633.96 - 3641.46] rice beans whatever it's up boots McGee
[3638.28 - 3643.38] says aw is it's totally true I even had
[3641.46 - 3646.02] rose-colored glasses thinking I did all
[3643.38 - 3648.00] medical medium my first years and looked
[3646.02 - 3650.04] back and I was eating dairy and gluten
[3648.00 - 3652.32] all the time it boots McGee thank you
[3650.04 - 3654.12] for saying that you're so awesome
[3652.32 - 3655.26] and I really appreciate it seriously
[3654.12 - 3658.32] you're on YouTube
[3655.26 - 3660.66] and thank you it means it means more to
[3658.32 - 3661.44] to me than anybody knows thank you for
[3660.66 - 3663.48] that
[3661.44 - 3664.92] and by the way I'm proud of you very
[3663.48 - 3667.38] proud of you
[3664.92 - 3669.30] so anyway
[3667.38 - 3671.04] Spirit of compassion predicted that food
[3669.30 - 3672.60] costs were going to go up and if you're
[3671.04 - 3673.86] like oh well then I won't get the juicer
[3672.60 - 3676.26] because I don't want to spend money on
[3673.86 - 3680.58] produce no food costs are going up for
[3676.26 - 3685.40] all food everything beans rice peas
[3680.58 - 3688.08] grains Dairy meat fish it's all going up
[3685.40 - 3689.52] eggs whatever here in egg eater it's all
[3688.08 - 3691.68] going up Carrie pierce it says the Omega
[3689.52 - 3694.32] mm is saving me so much money I bought
[3691.68 - 3696.72] it on payments and it is paying for
[3694.32 - 3699.06] itself every month in the dollars I save
[3696.72 - 3701.76] I swear to God
[3699.06 - 3703.26] I'm saving money when I use the mm 1500
[3701.76 - 3705.48] and mm-900
[3703.26 - 3708.18] I know because I've used all the other
[3705.48 - 3711.84] juicers and I had to buy more heads of
[3708.18 - 3713.58] celery more things and More Produce and
[3711.84 - 3715.50] I got less juice so there's these
[3713.58 - 3716.88] spinning basket juices out there and
[3715.50 - 3719.82] everybody's like oh those are the ones
[3716.88 - 3722.58] to get don't get the mm juicers get
[3719.82 - 3724.14] these spinning baskets that are
[3722.58 - 3725.64] you know promoted by whatever
[3724.14 - 3728.34] influencers involved whatever the
[3725.64 - 3730.20] whatever it is right and
[3728.34 - 3731.58] but what people don't realize is you got
[3730.20 - 3734.64] to be rich
[3731.58 - 3737.76] in my opinion you gotta be
[3734.64 - 3739.44] freaking rich because those just you got
[3737.76 - 3741.18] to put a lot more produce in those
[3739.44 - 3742.62] juicers sure it may feel like it's
[3741.18 - 3744.30] easier and you got your basket of juice
[3742.62 - 3746.58] but you have to put a lot more produce
[3744.30 - 3748.26] that's what I've learned in all the
[3746.58 - 3749.34] different juicer centrifuge ones and
[3748.26 - 3753.02] everything
[3749.34 - 3753.02] I'm only talking about this because
[3753.06 - 3758.40] food costs are actually going up higher
[3756.42 - 3760.74] and higher
[3758.40 - 3763.08] if they're not coming down
[3760.74 - 3765.66] so it's like but we need ways to heal
[3763.08 - 3769.08] ourselves we need medicine makers and
[3765.66 - 3772.26] Medicine machines if I if I ignore the
[3769.08 - 3775.14] food costs going up then I'm actually
[3772.26 - 3776.52] being a jerk
[3775.14 - 3778.02] because
[3776.52 - 3780.18] it's like
[3778.02 - 3782.58] we heal ourselves through our food right
[3780.18 - 3784.86] we heal ourselves through the foods we
[3782.58 - 3788.04] eat that's one of the ways we heal
[3784.86 - 3791.94] ourselves and if I pretend
[3788.04 - 3795.12] that food costs aren't going up
[3791.94 - 3796.98] and never talk about it that's
[3795.12 - 3799.02] because I'm noticing that with the
[3796.98 - 3800.16] podcast doctors out there a lot of
[3799.02 - 3801.54] people in alternative world they're not
[3800.16 - 3803.46] talking about that
[3801.54 - 3805.92] like the influencers who have money
[3803.46 - 3807.54] they're not talking about that because
[3805.92 - 3809.82] it's not hurting them
[3807.54 - 3811.98] when they buy their produce and whatever
[3809.82 - 3814.88] no one's talking about it it's like what
[3811.98 - 3814.88] are we trying to hide it
[3815.34 - 3823.32] it's like it's like demented the mm9 900
[3819.72 - 3825.96] and 1500 are in the description and the
[3823.32 - 3828.00] uh bio
[3825.96 - 3829.86] too so just letting you guys know anyway
[3828.00 - 3832.38] I just thought that this was something
[3829.86 - 3833.94] that we shouldn't like pretend doesn't
[3832.38 - 3835.38] exist so noticing that people
[3833.94 - 3836.94] influencers of people want to help
[3835.38 - 3839.22] move-in podcast doctors so they're just
[3836.94 - 3840.36] not even talking about it's like what oh
[3839.22 - 3842.40] that's right because it doesn't affect
[3840.36 - 3845.10] you you got money for all the proofs you
[3842.40 - 3846.78] want by the way there's a new omega this
[3845.10 - 3848.58] is an Omega Juicer
[3846.78 - 3850.38] Omega juicers.com right the link is in
[3848.58 - 3852.84] the description they have and plus
[3850.38 - 3856.14] there's a hotline now for this juicer
[3852.84 - 3859.44] for customer service so it's a new omega
[3856.14 - 3862.56] medical medium support line
[3859.44 - 3865.68] okay it's in the description
[3862.56 - 3867.50] it's just so you know and if you have
[3865.68 - 3869.82] these juicers and you need a part
[3867.50 - 3872.28] something's wrong whatever it is because
[3869.82 - 3874.08] we juice like nobody's business like the
[3872.28 - 3876.96] medical medium Community juices like no
[3874.08 - 3878.76] one's ever seen I'm talking about holy
[3876.96 - 3881.76] crap the kind of juicing
[3878.76 - 3883.62] no here's what juicing used to be it
[3881.76 - 3885.12] used to be someone just buying a juicer
[3883.62 - 3886.68] it sits in the kitchen goes in the
[3885.12 - 3889.20] closet they take it out once a month
[3886.68 - 3890.58] that like we use these machines like no
[3889.20 - 3892.50] other people in the medical medium
[3890.58 - 3894.48] Community use juicers daily sometimes
[3892.50 - 3897.24] three times a day usually for their
[3894.48 - 3899.04] families they're juicing all day long
[3897.24 - 3901.20] and they don't
[3899.04 - 3901.98] they don't just use a juicer once a
[3901.20 - 3905.28] month
[3901.98 - 3907.94] or once a week or once in a while
[3905.28 - 3907.94] all right
[3908.40 - 3914.10] but I just don't think it's right
[3910.32 - 3916.92] because I notice that
[3914.10 - 3920.04] no one's talking about the produce and
[3916.92 - 3921.96] the meat and the whatever industry going
[3920.04 - 3923.46] up in price in the health realm and
[3921.96 - 3925.74] health world no one's talking about it
[3923.46 - 3926.82] and I'm like why why are you not talking
[3925.74 - 3929.04] about it
[3926.82 - 3930.66] it's like a car when a car you use a car
[3929.04 - 3932.40] and you beat the hell out of a car and
[3930.66 - 3935.58] you use that car and you drive you get
[3932.40 - 3937.26] 200 000 miles on that car it's gonna
[3935.58 - 3940.68] need some parts changed every now and
[3937.26 - 3943.92] then and we beat these juicers to a pulp
[3940.68 - 3945.24] and so there's a 15-year warranty on
[3943.92 - 3948.54] this juicer
[3945.24 - 3952.68] the powertrain the engine and there's a
[3948.54 - 3954.66] 15 year warranty on the parts
[3952.68 - 3956.16] other juicers usually only have a two
[3954.66 - 3958.14] year warranty on the parts especially
[3956.16 - 3960.12] the ones the spinning baskets and all
[3958.14 - 3961.26] that crap right anyway I wanted to tell
[3960.12 - 3963.42] you guys
[3961.26 - 3965.22] that's what I noticed I was like I know
[3963.42 - 3967.50] this is like a kind of a moment where
[3965.22 - 3970.02] we're talking about this but I know this
[3967.50 - 3972.18] nobody else in health like all the big
[3970.02 - 3976.02] gurus out there the health gurus out
[3972.18 - 3978.00] there and the YouTube doctors and all
[3976.02 - 3980.16] that they're not talking about like the
[3978.00 - 3981.72] food prices going up it doesn't have to
[3980.16 - 3984.66] affect them they got plenty of money
[3981.72 - 3988.28] they buy what they want to eat
[3984.66 - 3988.28] but all I can tell you is
[3988.38 - 3991.76] it affects the chronic wheel
[3992.76 - 3996.60] all right right we're going to make the
[3995.22 - 3999.54] hey
[3996.60 - 4002.24] what's am I speaking am I speaking the
[3999.54 - 4006.64] truth stabilizer now before I'm even

[4013.28 - 4016.16] morning
[4014.00 - 4018.08] Lynn Western says we have used the
[4016.16 - 4020.42] warranty several times and they take
[4018.08 - 4022.88] care of us every time the warranty is
[4020.42 - 4024.98] awesome the new hotline for the medical
[4022.88 - 4026.12] median juicers is a great benefit to all
[4024.98 - 4029.78] of us

[4037.70 - 4043.04] say when I actually get this in me right
[4039.74 - 4046.76] now within the moment
[4043.04 - 4048.14] oh my God I might say all kinds of crap
[4046.76 - 4051.34] all right

[4055.52 - 4059.96] I'm a little nervous I got some ginger
[4058.22 - 4064.54] right here
[4059.96 - 4064.54] one inch piece Ginger coming right up
[4067.94 - 4073.22] right there dropping it down to shoot

[4081.56 - 4087.74] boom dropping it down to shoot
[4085.22 - 4090.94] a little nervous one small clove of
[4087.74 - 4090.94] garlic going down the chute
[4092.60 - 4096.26] boom
[4094.46 - 4099.32] garlic down the chute
[4096.26 - 4102.02] half cup tightly packed fresh basil that
[4099.32 - 4106.18] basil is really potent stuff
[4102.02 - 4106.18] half cup tightly packed
[4106.40 - 4111.64] oh man we're gonna run some basil
[4108.14 - 4111.64] through here this is no joke actually
[4112.46 - 4114.64] foreign
[4121.70 - 4127.54] okay
[4123.26 - 4127.54] half cup tightly packed arugula
[4138.68 - 4146.86] one cup roughly chopped lettuce
[4142.40 - 4146.86] such as green leaf or butter leaf
[4148.40 - 4155.06] why am I yelling the juicer is quiet
[4152.24 - 4156.98] this isn't those loud juicers if you're
[4155.06 - 4158.18] if you're juicing for your family this
[4156.98 - 4160.16] thing is so quiet it doesn't wake
[4158.18 - 4163.04] anybody up in the household you can
[4160.16 - 4165.26] whisper and still use this juicer why am
[4163.04 - 4168.34] I yelling
[4165.26 - 4168.34] getting the lettuce in
[4170.18 - 4173.08] one more
[4174.80 - 4181.24] another piece here okay and then one
[4178.28 - 4181.24] orange peel
[4183.32 - 4190.04] where's my fuel door there's my peeled
[4185.66 - 4192.02] Orange right there already peeled
[4190.04 - 4194.06] I'm going to send this orange down if
[4192.02 - 4195.20] you guys don't mind I'm just cutting it
[4194.06 - 4198.04] up a little bit
[4195.20 - 4198.04] some pieces
[4198.62 - 4201.70] so one orange
[4202.52 - 4205.36] peeled here
[4205.46 - 4208.18] nice
[4210.92 - 4214.36] there we go incredible
[4218.48 - 4223.34] amazing what you're gonna find with this
[4221.60 - 4225.98] you'll see
[4223.34 - 4228.46] the pull okay as it comes out of this
[4225.98 - 4228.46] juicer
[4229.28 - 4233.74] okay
[4231.02 - 4233.74] stride
[4233.84 - 4236.80] much drier
[4237.08 - 4242.18] than the other juicers right
[4240.14 - 4245.62] that's where the money's at
[4242.18 - 4249.02] you would need three oranges
[4245.62 - 4251.66] to get the same amount maybe even less
[4249.02 - 4252.92] three oranges with the other juicers now
[4251.66 - 4255.92] you can take your time you might have
[4252.92 - 4257.36] some pulp when softer fruits go in with
[4255.92 - 4259.16] this high compression you might have the
[4257.36 - 4260.84] pulp come up here for a little bit you
[4259.16 - 4262.82] can take your time and turn it on a
[4260.84 - 4264.68] couple of times and it'll actually suck
[4262.82 - 4266.30] it down eventually and you can add other
[4264.68 - 4267.92] stuff too you know through it and it'll
[4266.30 - 4271.10] just clean it right through
[4267.92 - 4273.02] but but the amount saved is unbelievable
[4271.10 - 4275.30] from this process
[4273.02 - 4277.10] I'm not kidding like it's incredible
[4275.30 - 4278.30] actually
[4277.10 - 4281.36] foreign
[4278.30 - 4283.34] like it's a lot more juice
[4281.36 - 4287.06] that's the other thing too if you're
[4283.34 - 4288.38] using the mm1500 the mm-900 you're going
[4287.06 - 4290.78] to get more
[4288.38 - 4292.40] from the ingredients that you're putting
[4290.78 - 4293.90] in for these brain shots or any kind of
[4292.40 - 4296.12] juicing you do
[4293.90 - 4297.92] I actually saw there was someone who
[4296.12 - 4299.66] showed me um something that was on
[4297.92 - 4300.98] television one of the main networks and
[4299.66 - 4301.76] they were doing a little juicing on
[4300.98 - 4305.12] there
[4301.76 - 4307.52] and the amount of produce they threw
[4305.12 - 4310.04] through their juicer
[4307.52 - 4312.02] one of the you know whatever thing which
[4310.04 - 4313.64] is the amount of carrots everything it
[4312.02 - 4315.80] was a joke what they got in the end and
[4313.64 - 4316.94] I was like sitting there like oh my God

[4349.22 - 4353.00] got enough for the easy couple okay
[4351.44 - 4355.28] people ask what the difference is
[4353.00 - 4357.47] between the 900 and the 1500 that's the
[4355.28 - 4361.35] difference right there

[4381.56 - 4386.30] brain really fast right to the emotional
[4383.84 - 4388.82] center of the brain and it just blows it
[4386.30 - 4392.06] up because what it's doing is it's
[4388.82 - 4395.12] releasing stuff so you can think clearer
