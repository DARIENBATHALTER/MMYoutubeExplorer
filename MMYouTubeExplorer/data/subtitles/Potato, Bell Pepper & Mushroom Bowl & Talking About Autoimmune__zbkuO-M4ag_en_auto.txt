[73.92 - 78.40] or trying to lose weight or trying to
[75.92 - 80.48] get yourself to a better place
[78.40 - 82.08] it's the fats get in the way right so
[80.48 - 84.08] these meals are all no fat because i
[82.08 - 85.76] know you guys are on the fat you're just
[84.08 - 87.44] and i get it you're on the fat whether
[85.76 - 91.36] it's milk cheese butter eggs
[87.44 - 93.60] chicken meat you know uh fish
[91.36 - 94.80] right you just got the fats going all

[105.28 - 108.72] these different seeds pumpkin seeds
[107.20 - 111.12] now i see people walking around i got my
[108.72 - 112.64] pumpkin seeds i got my pumpkin seeds i'm
[111.12 - 114.96] doing my pumpkin seeds yeah
[112.64 - 116.32] yeah pumpkin seeds are amazing way
[114.96 - 119.28] better for you than chicken
[116.32 - 119.60] no that's true right way better for you
[119.28 - 122.40] than
[119.60 - 124.08] chicken pumpkin seeds right but still
[122.40 - 125.60] it's a lot of fat so then the blood
[124.08 - 129.60] stays thick and if you're
[125.60 - 133.44] sick if you're sick and you're doing
[129.60 - 134.32] all this fat it's almost impossible to
[133.44 - 137.28] heal
[134.32 - 138.88] i'm going to say it again if you're sick
[137.28 - 142.00] and you're doing all this fat
[138.88 - 144.80] it's almost impossible to
[142.00 - 145.20] heal and i mean heal i mean heal down to
[144.80 - 148.72] the
[145.20 - 149.20] bone i'm talking healing all the way
[148.72 - 152.88] down
[149.20 - 156.00] to the root all the way down
[152.88 - 160.08] to the ground like right there
[156.00 - 162.00] and healing deep deep deep
[160.08 - 163.76] in order to heal that deep you can't
[162.00 - 166.16] have the fats high
[163.76 - 168.64] so that means if you're animal protein
[166.16 - 170.80] person time to lower it and take a break
[168.64 - 172.16] if you're a plant-based person time to
[170.80 - 175.12] lower it and take
[172.16 - 176.16] a break colleen mcgraw says what about
[175.12 - 178.96] protein

[409.36 - 414.16] avocado oil incredible what happens is
[411.60 - 418.80] when you take those oils down
[414.16 - 422.16] oils are so acidic so acidic
[418.80 - 424.72] fatty acid fatty
[422.16 - 425.76] acid i see we're being censored tonight
[424.72 - 428.00] big time

[441.60 - 445.84] olive oil is a great oil
[443.04 - 448.16] right but it's really it's what happens
[445.84 - 451.20] is our we lose our oxygen in our body
[448.16 - 453.84] when we're sick or but oxygen helps us
[451.20 - 456.32] heal it actually helps to kill it keeps
[453.84 - 457.36] microorganisms like viruses and bacteria
[456.32 - 458.88] down
[457.36 - 460.88] and when we fill our bloodstream with
[458.88 - 463.44] all that fat every day and day out day
[460.88 - 464.96] day day and day out and our liver starts
[463.44 - 466.72] getting congested everything starts
[464.96 - 468.32] getting congested
[466.72 - 470.40] and our liver starts getting all
[468.32 - 472.32] congested our liver right here
[470.40 - 473.76] it gets gets fatty liver and we don't
[472.32 - 475.12] even know it fatty liver and then our
[473.76 - 476.80] immune system drops
[475.12 - 478.48] we have too much fat in our bloodstream
[476.80 - 480.16] all the time and the fat starts
[478.48 - 481.76] collecting everywhere that doctors can't
[480.16 - 483.28] see they can't see until you're yeah 80
[481.76 - 484.08] years old 60 years old but they start
[483.28 - 486.24] seeing it then
[484.08 - 487.68] we just start we but we break down from
[486.24 - 490.24] all that fat right

[806.56 - 814.08] uh oh the onion
[811.04 - 816.24] mct oil coconut oil good for alzheimer's

[817.28 - 823.20] tell you why it's not and i'll tell you
[820.40 - 825.04] why you're bamboozled
[823.20 - 827.20] with that information tell you why we
[825.04 - 829.76] get bamboozled with that info
[827.20 - 830.80] it's actually sad let's do a half an
[829.76 - 833.92] onion here
[830.80 - 833.92] put this onion over here
[836.24 - 840.24] i don't want the onion diced too small i
[838.80 - 843.84] still want them kind of hunky
[840.24 - 846.56] let's get the onions in here
[843.84 - 849.28] it's a great dish we're making let's get
[846.56 - 849.28] these steaming
[852.48 - 855.76] let's hit the oils really quick here's
[854.00 - 858.40] what happens when you
[855.76 - 860.72] when you're consuming oils right it
[858.40 - 863.36] rushes you to alzheimer's
[860.72 - 865.60] it rushes you to dementia is what it
[863.36 - 865.60] does
[865.92 - 869.36] you see that spec that i put on there do
[868.32 - 871.52] you see that spec
[869.36 - 873.20] right aluminum right here do you see
[871.52 - 874.88] that
[873.20 - 876.96] do you know why we get alzheimer's and
[874.88 - 879.68] dementia
[876.96 - 881.60] because of aluminum and mercury
[879.68 - 884.24] predominantly mercury
[881.60 - 885.92] in our brain this is the best lesson you
[884.24 - 888.80] can ever learn right now about this this
[885.92 - 891.84] is really important
[888.80 - 894.96] ready metal
[891.84 - 898.32] rusts and oxidizes
[894.96 - 902.24] and bleeds and corrodes
[898.32 - 905.44] and out pockets when oil
[902.24 - 908.16] is around it oil
[905.44 - 909.12] is around it keep that in mind keep that
[908.16 - 912.88] in mind
[909.12 - 916.16] oil makes the metal corrode
[912.88 - 919.44] faster and it
[916.16 - 921.52] makes it move into adjacent tissue
[919.44 - 923.92] everybody has aluminum and mercury
[921.52 - 926.96] inside their brain
[923.92 - 927.60] the higher the fat diet whether good fat
[926.96 - 930.64] or bad
[927.60 - 931.76] fat the quicker you go to alzheimer's
[930.64 - 935.68] dementia depression
[931.76 - 937.44] anxiety depersonalization bipolar ocd
[935.68 - 939.60] i don't know did i miss a bunch i bet
[937.44 - 942.72] you i did schizophrenia whatever i miss
[939.60 - 945.44] probably missed a bunch right and
[942.72 - 946.08] what happened ptsd too a little bit of
[945.44 - 949.44] that
[946.08 - 952.64] okay so what happens is oil
[949.44 - 956.00] right oil
[952.64 - 958.08] will make the metal out out pocket
[956.00 - 960.16] so you got the metal in there but the
[958.08 - 963.60] metal will expand
[960.16 - 966.64] it will run and bleed from the
[963.60 - 968.16] oil so whether it's mct or coconut oil
[966.64 - 971.28] what nobody's telling you
[968.16 - 973.04] is they don't no one took a bunch of
[971.28 - 975.44] people with alzheimer's
[973.04 - 976.40] right and a bunch of people dementia and
[975.44 - 980.00] just gave them
[976.40 - 983.12] mct their all their diets
[980.00 - 984.40] changed other supplements were brought
[983.12 - 987.84] in
[984.40 - 990.64] okay fast food was removed
[987.84 - 992.56] from from people and that's something to
[990.64 - 993.92] understand how it works right
[992.56 - 995.92] it's not like you got somebody with
[993.92 - 996.48] alzheimer's and dementia nothing's
[995.92 - 998.48] changing
[996.48 - 999.84] they're still doing everything they do
[998.48 - 1001.04] nothing changes and all of a sudden let
[999.84 - 1002.40] me give them a little coconut oil and
[1001.04 - 1004.96] their alzheimer's got better no
[1002.40 - 1005.44] ah never happened never happened never
[1004.96 - 1009.04] will
[1005.44 - 1012.56] never did so just know that right
[1009.04 - 1013.44] plus it's a theory that it's helpful the
[1012.56 - 1016.24] theory
[1013.44 - 1018.24] is built on this preface it's built on
[1016.24 - 1021.76] this foundation of
[1018.24 - 1024.16] our brain needs fat give our brain
[1021.76 - 1025.28] healthy fat and we get better
[1024.16 - 1028.80] alzheimer's
[1025.28 - 1031.36] is the brain give our brain healthy fat
[1028.80 - 1033.44] then alzheimer's gets better this is a
[1031.36 - 1036.08] massive mistake in the industry
[1033.44 - 1036.84] it's an embarrassing mistake because the
[1036.08 - 1040.40] brain
[1036.84 - 1043.12] dies without glucose fast
[1040.40 - 1045.68] in five seconds if your brain doesn't
[1043.12 - 1048.72] have glucose it starts to die
[1045.68 - 1052.40] it starts to die die
[1048.72 - 1055.44] die say it again die yeah your brain
[1052.40 - 1058.48] starts to die without glucose
[1055.44 - 1061.68] in five seconds
[1058.48 - 1062.64] it starts to die okay that's what
[1061.68 - 1065.76] happens
[1062.64 - 1068.88] in 10 seconds it's dying
[1065.76 - 1070.00] without glucose right your brain doesn't
[1068.88 - 1072.48] start dying
[1070.00 - 1074.48] because it's without fat in your
[1072.48 - 1076.64] bloodstream
[1074.48 - 1079.04] you can have no fat in your bloodstream
[1076.64 - 1081.44] your brain doesn't die
[1079.04 - 1083.76] you take out the glucose your brain
[1081.44 - 1085.92] starts to die
[1083.76 - 1087.68] linda i just joined this video do you

[1179.36 - 1184.72] need more protein during pregnancy
[1182.24 - 1185.68] it's what's being pushed by the national
[1184.72 - 1188.40] health guidelines
[1185.68 - 1190.00] huh interesting of course it's pushed
[1188.40 - 1191.68] that's what i was talking about before
[1190.00 - 1193.84] about protein is the protein
[1191.68 - 1196.40] brainwashing scheme of a lifetime was a
[1193.84 - 1197.92] deal brokered in 1933.
[1196.40 - 1200.56] so it's important to know what happened
[1197.92 - 1205.12] is protein was
[1200.56 - 1208.16] was used as a weapon in 1933 big pharma
[1205.12 - 1209.92] and the academic world both combined
[1208.16 - 1211.68] to make sure that you would think
[1209.92 - 1213.60] protein is the answer
[1211.68 - 1215.68] it's it's one of the biggest scams of
[1213.60 - 1217.36] our lifetime it's so sad one day i'll do
[1215.68 - 1219.60] a whole protein show because there's so
[1217.36 - 1222.16] much information involved with it
[1219.60 - 1222.96] but yeah that's how it works what you
[1222.16 - 1226.00] need
[1222.96 - 1228.24] is mineral salts and glucose you need
[1226.00 - 1230.72] calories when you're pregnant but proper
[1228.24 - 1233.76] calories mineral salts and glucose right
[1230.72 - 1234.80] that's what you need protein isn't it
[1233.76 - 1238.08] isn't what your
[1234.80 - 1240.24] baby is is utilizing right it's not what
[1238.08 - 1242.56] mommy's utilizing in order to create a
[1240.24 - 1243.12] healthy baby and that's that's a massive
[1242.56 - 1245.76] scam
[1243.12 - 1247.20] i mean it just is um and yeah they're
[1245.76 - 1248.08] pushing that information but they push
[1247.20 - 1250.64] misinformation
[1248.08 - 1251.36] every day in every way out there right
[1250.64 - 1252.96] and you know what
[1251.36 - 1254.48] here's the best part about it i'm going
[1252.96 - 1256.24] to tell you right now
[1254.48 - 1259.04] the misinformation pushers don't know
[1256.24 - 1262.24] why anybody's sick so if mommy gets sick
[1259.04 - 1263.36] check this out when mommy gets sick with

[1286.08 - 1290.08] don't know why you're sick
[1287.76 - 1291.52] does that make a lot of sense to you
[1290.08 - 1293.68] think about that one

[1293.68 - 1297.12] thousand for me

[1328.00 - 1331.76] we don't know why mom mommy has
[1329.60 - 1333.92] postpartum depression postpartum fatigue
[1331.76 - 1335.52] postpartum sickness thyroid disease
[1333.92 - 1337.60] we don't know why mommy has breast
[1335.52 - 1339.76] cancer we don't know down the road we
[1337.60 - 1341.92] don't know why mommy has anything
[1339.76 - 1343.52] anything at all but we're experts to
[1341.92 - 1345.68] what mommy needs
[1343.52 - 1348.16] mommy needs her protein for her baby
[1345.68 - 1348.88] right we don't know why mommy's ever
[1348.16 - 1350.88] been sick
[1348.88 - 1352.16] any mommy's been sick in decade after
[1350.88 - 1353.76] decade after decade
[1352.16 - 1355.44] we don't know why any mommy's been sick
[1353.76 - 1356.32] for the whole century for the last
[1355.44 - 1358.72] century
[1356.32 - 1361.28] and this century already but we're
[1358.72 - 1364.72] experts at what mommy needs
[1361.28 - 1366.08] we're total experts right
[1364.72 - 1368.08] when you think when you put it in
[1366.08 - 1371.36] perspective when you place
[1368.08 - 1372.64] that into perspective you you're already
[1371.36 - 1374.80] like wait a minute
[1372.64 - 1376.32] right i mean it's beyond common sense
[1374.80 - 1379.76] like beyond
[1376.32 - 1381.20] amy gallbladder inflammation help
[1379.76 - 1383.52] yeah the you know like if i had
[1381.20 - 1385.52] gallbladder inflammation if i did
[1383.52 - 1387.28] keeping the fats down is critical right
[1385.52 - 1389.12] steaming up some keeping the fats down
[1387.28 - 1392.48] is critical that's part one
[1389.12 - 1395.60] the more fat you eat
[1392.48 - 1396.96] okay whether it's healthy fat or fat
[1395.60 - 1400.24] that's not healthy
[1396.96 - 1402.16] the more bile has to be produced
[1400.24 - 1403.92] so your liver is killing itself to
[1402.16 - 1406.40] produce that vial right
[1403.92 - 1407.04] so your liver is just killing itself to
[1406.40 - 1410.96] produce
[1407.04 - 1414.40] bile right okay so your liver is it's
[1410.96 - 1416.56] it's over working right so it's gotta
[1414.40 - 1417.68] spew out all this bile you keep on
[1416.56 - 1419.12] putting fat in
[1417.68 - 1420.40] you just keep on dumping in and you
[1419.12 - 1420.88] might be like what is he talking about
[1420.40 - 1423.04] fat
[1420.88 - 1424.08] you know chicken fish beef milk cheese
[1423.04 - 1427.44] eggs butter
[1424.08 - 1431.04] bacon pork pork chops whatever right ham
[1427.44 - 1432.88] okay nuts seeds oils coconut oil right
[1431.04 - 1435.28] sesame seeds whatever it is right all
[1432.88 - 1436.80] that fat right olive oil
[1435.28 - 1438.48] your liver has to kill itself so now you
[1436.80 - 1440.64] got an inflamed gallbladder
[1438.48 - 1441.76] the gallbladder is inflamed right it's a
[1440.64 - 1445.36] little gallbladder
[1441.76 - 1448.24] your gallbladder's inflamed and we're
[1445.36 - 1449.12] we're now overworking the liver and the
[1448.24 - 1450.96] liver has to
[1449.12 - 1452.56] produce all this bile and shove it up
[1450.96 - 1453.36] the gallbladder like send it up the
[1452.56 - 1455.20] gallbladder
[1453.36 - 1456.64] now the gallbladder is over stressed it
[1455.20 - 1458.96] has to work hard
[1456.64 - 1460.48] to even sustain itself when you got a
[1458.96 - 1462.24] gallbladder infection of any kind which
[1460.48 - 1463.36] is usually streptococcus
[1462.24 - 1465.44] when you have a streptococcus
[1463.36 - 1467.04] gallbladder infection and you got all
[1465.44 - 1469.84] that bile spewing up
[1467.04 - 1472.08] and it's overburdening that gallbladder
[1469.84 - 1472.88] that's one reason why we can't heal we
[1472.08 - 1475.76] can't heal it
[1472.88 - 1477.60] another reason the more fat you dump in
[1475.76 - 1479.20] the less oxygen in your bloodstream the
[1477.60 - 1481.12] less oxygen in your bloodstream
[1479.20 - 1482.56] the more pathogens like streptococcus
[1481.12 - 1485.04] can take over
[1482.56 - 1486.48] and create that inflamed gallbladder so
[1485.04 - 1488.00] you got that streptococcus
[1486.48 - 1489.12] inflaming the gallbladder right and a
[1488.00 - 1491.12] lot of people's gallbladder it's
[1489.12 - 1492.40] inflamed by streptococcus bacteria
[1491.12 - 1494.32] and then all of a sudden we're dumping
[1492.40 - 1496.00] in fats left and right and streptococcus
[1494.32 - 1496.48] is like woohoo there's no oxygen in our
[1496.00 - 1498.24] blood
[1496.48 - 1500.00] there's very little oxygen in our blood
[1498.24 - 1501.52] now we roll the roost let's keep on
[1500.00 - 1502.64] going with this infection let's keep on
[1501.52 - 1503.52] going with this infection here's the
[1502.64 - 1505.36] other problem
[1503.52 - 1507.52] the more fat in your bloodstream the
[1505.36 - 1509.28] less the nutrients
[1507.52 - 1510.96] the less phytochemical compounds that
[1509.28 - 1512.32] are antibacterial can get to your
[1510.96 - 1514.16] gallbladder so now
[1512.32 - 1515.60] if you eat a red bell pepper which
[1514.16 - 1518.24] happens to have vitamin c
[1515.60 - 1520.40] which is a phytochemical compound which
[1518.24 - 1522.08] helps destroy pathogens right
[1520.40 - 1523.60] like your streptococcus and you're
[1522.08 - 1524.40] trying to eat all these and you want
[1523.60 - 1526.56] your onion
[1524.40 - 1528.00] you get your onion that can help you
[1526.56 - 1529.68] fight infections right
[1528.00 - 1532.32] you get your garlic that can help you
[1529.68 - 1535.12] it's anti-viral antibacterial right
[1532.32 - 1536.32] but those phytochemical compounds can't
[1535.12 - 1537.76] get to the organ
[1536.32 - 1539.36] because there's so much fat in the
[1537.76 - 1541.68] bloodstream blocking
[1539.36 - 1542.56] glucose sugar from taking those
[1541.68 - 1544.96] nutrients
[1542.56 - 1547.44] into your organ now we're not even
[1544.96 - 1549.12] getting the fighting power we need
[1547.44 - 1550.88] there's a lot of information right here
[1549.12 - 1553.04] just letting you guys know
[1550.88 - 1555.04] i mean it's intense and i'm rolling it
[1553.04 - 1558.32] fast
[1555.04 - 1559.92] genetic disease sadie bear genetic
[1558.32 - 1561.36] disease okay so
[1559.92 - 1562.96] uh i'll answer that in a second i think
[1561.36 - 1564.24] a phone call was coming through that i
[1562.96 - 1571.84] had an appointment
[1564.24 - 1571.84] had an appointment with my doctor
[1573.28 - 1581.20] hey dr joby thanks for calling
[1577.36 - 1581.20] phew so what was my diagnosis
[1581.36 - 1588.40] you're my 10th doctor it's genetic
[1586.16 - 1590.24] what do you mean what do you mean
[1588.40 - 1593.28] genetic
[1590.24 - 1596.64] i was fine years ago
[1593.28 - 1596.64] so when did my genes go bad
[1596.88 - 1601.36] dr joby so you mean to tell me
[1601.44 - 1609.20] all right i'm in my i'm in my 40s
[1605.12 - 1613.20] yeah i'm 41 years old uh-huh
[1609.20 - 1616.40] and i've been fine up until i was 39
[1613.20 - 1620.16] and now my genes just went bad
[1616.40 - 1622.96] so now this this disease this disease
[1620.16 - 1626.00] i'm getting is genes
[1622.96 - 1630.08] okay so everybody who's getting sick
[1626.00 - 1633.28] it's their genes everybody
[1630.08 - 1634.96] um oh what about people who are born
[1633.28 - 1638.64] with problems that's genes
[1634.96 - 1641.84] well wait a minute why that's genes too
[1638.64 - 1641.84] i don't get it because
[1642.08 - 1645.12] so wait a minute okay if you don't have
[1643.92 - 1646.56] problems your whole life and then you
[1645.12 - 1650.08] get a problem that's genes if you're
[1646.56 - 1650.08] born with a problem that's genes
[1650.32 - 1654.00] what so everything's just genes okay so
[1653.12 - 1656.32] dr joby so
[1654.00 - 1658.08] what's my what do we do we can't do
[1656.32 - 1661.20] anything really because it's jeans
[1658.08 - 1661.84] rest okay so get some rest all right
[1661.20 - 1663.92] what else
[1661.84 - 1664.96] um stay out of trouble keep the stress
[1663.92 - 1668.80] down
[1664.96 - 1672.08] uh okay well what if i get
[1668.80 - 1674.24] better it's remission so if i get better
[1672.08 - 1675.60] my genetic disease is in remission but
[1674.24 - 1678.56] wait a minute i thought
[1675.60 - 1680.24] genes when they're bad they're bad so
[1678.56 - 1683.36] you mean my genes completely
[1680.24 - 1685.76] healed when i'm in remission no
[1683.36 - 1687.68] they didn't heal my genes are still bad
[1685.76 - 1690.40] but when i go into remission
[1687.68 - 1691.44] i'm in remission so okay so if i get
[1690.40 - 1694.24] better
[1691.44 - 1696.24] my genes are still bad that just doesn't
[1694.24 - 1699.44] make any sense
[1696.24 - 1703.36] um this is confusing me
[1699.44 - 1703.36] all right is everybody's genes going bad
[1703.84 - 1707.28] i hung up on the doctor i had an
[1705.84 - 1708.72] appointment with the doctor today just
[1707.28 - 1712.16] hung up on him
[1708.72 - 1714.48] i'm making hot sauce this is steaming up
[1712.16 - 1714.48] nice
[1716.08 - 1720.32] actually that's cooking up really good
[1717.84 - 1725.84] that's almost done
[1720.32 - 1725.84] um i'm gonna take the lid off
[1726.72 - 1731.04] evaporate some of that juice
[1736.84 - 1740.56] um
[1739.04 - 1744.00] you know it's like when babies are born
[1740.56 - 1745.60] with cancer that's not genes
[1744.00 - 1747.52] that's that's an immune system
[1745.60 - 1749.36] deficiency off the running
[1747.52 - 1751.44] and it's important to know how this
[1749.36 - 1753.92] works right they just want to pinpoint
[1751.44 - 1755.60] everything with genes if a baby's born
[1753.92 - 1758.64] with cancer
[1755.60 - 1761.36] that's a viral infection because because
[1758.64 - 1763.84] cancer is caused by viruses unless you
[1761.36 - 1766.96] get asbestos or you get
[1763.84 - 1768.72] you get unless it's a lethal solvent
[1766.96 - 1770.32] and you know that you know that's a
[1768.72 - 1772.56] different story right but outside of
[1770.32 - 1775.68] those very rare cases
[1772.56 - 1779.04] cancer is viral right viral
[1775.68 - 1779.68] cells going awry but you have to but but
[1779.04 - 1782.00] you can't
[1779.68 - 1783.84] just get cancer from viruses viruses
[1782.00 - 1786.00] need toxins so they need
[1783.84 - 1787.84] a certain amount of a toxic slop and
[1786.00 - 1790.16] brew to feed off of right
[1787.84 - 1790.96] so viruses have to feed off of a lot of
[1790.16 - 1792.72] metals
[1790.96 - 1794.00] and a lot of other toxins that's what
[1792.72 - 1796.08] viruses have to do
[1794.00 - 1797.76] and then the virus feeds off all these
[1796.08 - 1799.68] toxins
[1797.76 - 1801.04] and then gets stronger and starts to
[1799.68 - 1803.28] mutate
[1801.04 - 1805.68] and as it starts to mutate we have a
[1803.28 - 1809.52] different viral cell
[1805.68 - 1811.44] doctors um and sophie
[1809.52 - 1812.64] doctors are telling me they can't help
[1811.44 - 1816.64] me out because
[1812.64 - 1820.56] i am adopted they say it's genetic
[1816.64 - 1822.40] that's it's real oh my god i'm s
[1820.56 - 1824.08] and sophie this breaks my heart that you
[1822.40 - 1827.04] have to hear that
[1824.08 - 1828.64] um look i want you to listen to your
[1827.04 - 1830.24] doctor i want you to go see your doctor
[1828.64 - 1830.96] of course and all that but but if that
[1830.24 - 1833.04] was me
[1830.96 - 1835.36] i i would be yeah i would be upset
[1833.04 - 1837.68] because
[1835.36 - 1838.72] you know if that was me and that's what
[1837.68 - 1840.48] i was told
[1838.72 - 1842.48] i just i would just i wouldn't even by
[1840.48 - 1845.20] being disbelieved
[1842.48 - 1846.40] so we're making some hot hot sauce here
[1845.20 - 1848.24] well that's what they'll tell you
[1846.40 - 1851.52] that's so sad really it's so sad that
[1848.24 - 1854.24] they tell us that
[1851.52 - 1856.48] adhd and autism they'll say adhd and
[1854.24 - 1858.96] autism is genetic no it's not
[1856.48 - 1861.04] it's toxic heavy metals that's what it
[1858.96 - 1864.08] is there's answers to why we have
[1861.04 - 1865.52] problems there's actual answers i'm
[1864.08 - 1865.92] making some hot sauce i'm going to do a
[1865.52 - 1869.12] half
[1865.92 - 1870.64] a half cup of chopped red bell pepper
[1869.12 - 1872.16] which is the rest of this pepper right

[1872.16 - 1875.20] quick
[1873.44 - 1878.40] i'm going to use the rest of this pepper
[1875.20 - 1880.56] for this hot sauce
[1878.40 - 1882.32] i'm using a food processor i'm trying
[1880.56 - 1884.88] that out i've done that a lot with
[1882.32 - 1887.12] sauces and stuff so i do like it that
[1884.88 - 1887.12] way
[1887.76 - 1892.72] get some pepper in here let's get some
[1890.72 - 1894.08] cherry tomatoes in here too we don't
[1892.72 - 1895.44] need a ton of them about a third of a
[1894.08 - 1898.56] cup but i'm gonna throw
[1895.44 - 1902.16] a few of these in here
[1898.56 - 1904.96] cherry tomatoes so
[1902.16 - 1906.80] um fresh red cayenne pepper if you don't
[1904.96 - 1908.32] have that use some chili pepper flakes
[1906.80 - 1911.44] right here
[1908.32 - 1913.04] got the chili pepper flakes right i'm
[1911.44 - 1913.68] glad you guys could be on here today
[1913.04 - 1915.84] with me
[1913.68 - 1918.40] we're live facebook or live youtube but
[1915.84 - 1921.68] i'm going to throw one of these
[1918.40 - 1924.64] really hot peppers in here
[1921.68 - 1926.72] i don't know how much kind of pepper
[1924.64 - 1928.48] torture i want to be in tonight so maybe
[1926.72 - 1931.12] i'll use
[1928.48 - 1932.96] a smaller one these are really hot and
[1931.12 - 1934.00] when they get blended these are super
[1932.96 - 1935.52] chilies right
[1934.00 - 1937.92] cayenne is what you use super chill
[1935.52 - 1940.88] these are super chilis right there
[1937.92 - 1941.36] that's going to be hot that's going to
[1940.88 - 1943.28] be hot
[1941.36 - 1944.48] i'm going to put that in there don't
[1943.28 - 1948.00] fall for the nightshade
[1944.48 - 1951.04] bs very important
[1948.00 - 1952.80] if super sensitive it's like well are
[1951.04 - 1955.44] you sure you're super sensitive
[1952.80 - 1956.72] to a nightshade so if you took a fresh
[1955.44 - 1959.04] delicious
[1956.72 - 1960.48] heirloom tomato and you cut that tomato
[1959.04 - 1962.56] in half and you had a piece of that
[1960.48 - 1966.16] fresh tomato
[1962.56 - 1968.40] you sure that's causing the trouble
[1966.16 - 1970.64] um there's no cheese you sure there's no
[1968.40 - 1976.16] cheese in there there's no oil in there
[1970.64 - 1979.84] see because um
[1976.16 - 1979.84] i'm gonna grab something right here
[1981.92 - 1985.60] where'd you guys go where'd you go so
[1984.72 - 1988.80] you see like
[1985.60 - 1989.20] okay i can't tell you how many times i
[1988.80 - 1992.48] heard
[1989.20 - 1994.16] in 35 years right i'm sensitive to
[1992.48 - 1997.20] tomatoes
[1994.16 - 1999.04] and they had pizza and they're saying
[1997.20 - 1999.76] it's the tomato sauce and the pizza
[1999.04 - 2002.24] right
[1999.76 - 2004.32] when really we're talking about the
[2002.24 - 2006.88] cheese and the oil
[2004.32 - 2008.48] and the gluten right that's an example
[2006.88 - 2010.72] all on its own it's really important to
[2008.48 - 2010.72] know
[2011.60 - 2015.52] i'm gonna put that nice pizza over there
[2017.28 - 2022.56] you know if you're mono eating
[2020.56 - 2024.08] and you keep out the oils and you keep
[2022.56 - 2025.84] out the bad stuff and you keep out the
[2024.08 - 2026.48] milk cheese butter and you keep all that
[2025.84 - 2028.40] out
[2026.48 - 2030.48] and you're and you can determine really
[2028.40 - 2032.24] what am i sensitive to and even in that
[2030.48 - 2034.16] situation if you're cleansing a lot of
[2032.24 - 2036.08] poisons out you may not know
[2034.16 - 2037.52] you know you may actually be like whoa
[2036.08 - 2039.04] i'm actually doing some cleansing and
[2037.52 - 2040.80] detoxing you know there's a whole thing
[2039.04 - 2042.56] about detoxing where people are like i
[2040.80 - 2044.08] heard that word before it's
[2042.56 - 2045.84] whatever but you know when you do it
[2044.08 - 2047.44] right and you're healing yeah you will
[2045.84 - 2048.24] be cleansing and a lot of poisons will
[2047.44 - 2050.72] be going out
[2048.24 - 2052.32] a lot of people do fake detoxes they
[2050.72 - 2053.84] take a bunch of toxic products they get
[2052.32 - 2055.44] sick from the toxic products and then
[2053.84 - 2057.76] they call it detoxing when really
[2055.44 - 2061.28] they're just sick from toxic products
[2057.76 - 2063.04] um so keep that in mind right there
[2061.28 - 2065.28] a lot of people drown there they have
[2063.04 - 2065.76] tomato and ketchup with all the vinegar
[2065.28 - 2067.28] right
[2065.76 - 2069.84] that's a problem all on its own all the
[2067.28 - 2073.68] vinegar the vinegar is making them sick
[2069.84 - 2075.04] um by the way people make mistakes i'm
[2073.68 - 2076.24] going to talk about this let's i'll talk
[2075.04 - 2077.68] about this in a second but i want to
[2076.24 - 2079.60] finish this up
[2077.68 - 2081.60] what happens with potato as being a
[2079.60 - 2085.76] nightshade family right or
[2081.60 - 2088.80] eggplant eggplant parmesan
[2085.76 - 2089.76] right eggplant parmesan right the
[2088.80 - 2093.44] parmesan
[2089.76 - 2095.84] right fried eggplant in oil the fried
[2093.44 - 2098.48] oil makes people get all like feeling
[2095.84 - 2102.88] like they're busted up right
[2098.48 - 2104.96] it's tomato sauce with cheese in it
[2102.88 - 2106.00] and all kinds of stuff pasta with cheese
[2104.96 - 2108.56] on it right
[2106.00 - 2109.92] these things you know it's baked potato
[2108.56 - 2112.56] with sour cream
[2109.92 - 2114.16] and butter and your mashed potatoes it's
[2112.56 - 2116.08] just combinations
[2114.16 - 2118.88] a lot of that's what's happening right
[2116.08 - 2122.00] but a steamed potato doesn't cause a
[2118.88 - 2122.00] problem with someone
[2123.76 - 2127.04] um a lot of people make mistakes with
[2125.52 - 2128.48] with i'm gonna give you some tips right
[2127.04 - 2130.88] now if you have digestive
[2128.48 - 2132.64] issues of any kind like you're sensitive
[2130.88 - 2133.92] you're inflamed in your digestive tract
[2132.64 - 2136.24] because a lot of people are inflamed in
[2133.92 - 2137.60] their digestive tract
[2136.24 - 2139.68] and when they're inflamed in their
[2137.60 - 2142.16] intestinal lining because they got
[2139.68 - 2142.80] streptococcus they got inflammation
[2142.16 - 2144.56] caused by
[2142.80 - 2145.92] pathogens and they're inflamed they
[2144.56 - 2148.32] don't feel like they're digesting
[2145.92 - 2150.64] anything and so when you eat like
[2148.32 - 2152.48] when you eat like raw spinach or raw
[2150.64 - 2154.64] lettuce or raw red bell pepper
[2152.48 - 2156.48] like i can't eat that red bell pepper i
[2154.64 - 2157.68] can't eat a raw piece of onion i can't
[2156.48 - 2160.16] digest it but what's
[2157.68 - 2161.04] happening is they're digesting it but
[2160.16 - 2162.56] it's actually
[2161.04 - 2164.24] touching everything because you're in
[2162.56 - 2166.64] flames so you feel it right
[2164.24 - 2169.28] so then when they eat an egg right so
[2166.64 - 2171.76] then when they eat an egg
[2169.28 - 2172.96] okay and they have that egg they don't
[2171.76 - 2174.56] feel it because it's not touching
[2172.96 - 2176.24] anything it turns into glue and it's
[2174.56 - 2179.36] just moving through here into
[2176.24 - 2181.36] its glue it's not rubbing right
[2179.36 - 2182.96] but when we eat our lettuces and our
[2181.36 - 2185.60] spinach right raw
[2182.96 - 2186.48] it's rubbing it's moving through us
[2185.60 - 2188.32] right you guys
[2186.48 - 2190.48] okay so you feel it if you're in flame
[2188.32 - 2193.80] doesn't mean you're not digesting it see
[2190.48 - 2197.28] but here's the funny thing you take
[2193.80 - 2200.96] vegetables right vegetables
[2197.28 - 2202.64] and you don't steam them long enough
[2200.96 - 2204.64] till they're soft
[2202.64 - 2205.92] you're gonna feel those rub everything
[2204.64 - 2208.32] too so
[2205.92 - 2210.08] the difference is here is when you steam
[2208.32 - 2212.72] a vegetable or cook a vegetable
[2210.08 - 2213.44] you kill it right yeah you kill it yeah
[2212.72 - 2216.56] it's not raw
[2213.44 - 2217.60] you kill it you cook it right but when
[2216.56 - 2219.28] you do that
[2217.60 - 2221.68] you get the nutrients and all that but
[2219.28 - 2223.04] what happens is that
[2221.68 - 2224.40] this is done right here i'm going to put
[2223.04 - 2225.12] some potatoes in here what happens is
[2224.40 - 2228.24] that
[2225.12 - 2230.72] it's not cooked vegetables
[2228.24 - 2232.64] are easy to digest when they're soft
[2230.72 - 2236.72] when you cook them
[2232.64 - 2238.72] raw vegetables many of like lettuces and
[2236.72 - 2239.84] and spinach and all that are easy to
[2238.72 - 2243.84] digest
[2239.84 - 2246.96] right when when they're raw
[2243.84 - 2249.68] right but when you cook green beans and
[2246.96 - 2251.04] cook carrots but you don't steam them
[2249.68 - 2253.52] until they're soft
[2251.04 - 2255.68] in any and anything like red bell pepper
[2253.52 - 2259.36] anything you don't steam them
[2255.68 - 2262.72] until they're soft what happens
[2259.36 - 2263.12] is that they they tend to they tend to
[2262.72 - 2266.24] rub
[2263.12 - 2266.72] things along the way not break down as
[2266.24 - 2269.12] easy
[2266.72 - 2270.80] right you've got to steam them soft if
[2269.12 - 2272.96] you're sensitive you're not sensitive
[2270.80 - 2275.04] with any kind of digestive sensitivities
[2272.96 - 2276.56] you can just steam them lightly i do it
[2275.04 - 2277.44] all the time i steam my stuff really
[2276.56 - 2280.56] lightly right
[2277.44 - 2282.08] but i like steaming them more more with
[2280.56 - 2282.72] you guys because i know a lot of you
[2282.08 - 2285.60] guys
[2282.72 - 2286.72] have a lot of sensitivities but we need
[2285.60 - 2289.76] our vegetables
[2286.72 - 2293.68] um so what i just did is i just put
[2289.76 - 2296.80] in here i got some onion in this bowl
[2293.68 - 2299.04] i got some uh red bell pepper in here
[2296.80 - 2300.48] right okay now i'm gonna do now i'm
[2299.04 - 2303.36] gonna start working on
[2300.48 - 2303.36] some potatoes
[2303.92 - 2306.88] now i'm gonna start working on the
[2305.36 - 2309.60] potatoes i'm gonna just take some of
[2306.88 - 2309.60] this out here
[2310.24 - 2315.44] there we go all right
[2313.76 - 2317.52] and i'm gonna i got steamed potatoes
[2315.44 - 2320.96] right here remember i keep a whole bunch
[2317.52 - 2320.96] handy right you guys
[2321.44 - 2327.84] and i'm gonna cut up some nice pieces
[2324.80 - 2327.84] right here
[2329.44 - 2336.56] okay in the pan nice hot pan i cook cook
[2333.04 - 2336.56] them ahead i keep them in the fridge
[2337.12 - 2340.16] covering a lot covering a lot of cool
[2339.28 - 2343.20] topics that
[2340.16 - 2345.44] count back to alzheimer's and dementia
[2343.20 - 2347.04] no the more fat you do the quicker you
[2345.44 - 2348.88] get there
[2347.04 - 2350.64] the more fat you do the quicker you get
[2348.88 - 2352.16] there the more protein you do the
[2350.64 - 2354.00] quicker you get there
[2352.16 - 2356.16] yeah the more protein you do the quicker
[2354.00 - 2358.24] you get to alzheimer's and dementia
[2356.16 - 2359.44] reason why most proteins have a lot of
[2358.24 - 2362.48] fat in there
[2359.44 - 2364.80] keep that in mind so um
[2362.48 - 2366.08] you know that's important to know so i
[2364.80 - 2369.84] got some potato in here i'm gonna do

[2928.96 - 2933.04] get a little lemon slice on the side
[2933.52 - 2936.80] you can do a lemon slice in different
[2935.28 - 2940.84] ways um
[2936.80 - 2943.84] i'm going to do it this way here here we
[2940.84 - 2943.84] go
[2944.72 - 2947.36] sometimes i like doing the lemon slice
[2946.24 - 2948.80] like that look at that i don't know if
[2947.36 - 2950.40] you guys can see it so easy i'm gonna
[2948.80 - 2951.92] put it on the side
[2950.40 - 2954.32] like this put it right on the side in
[2951.92 - 2956.08] here when i got that
[2954.32 - 2958.08] so it's incredible the potatoes here i
[2956.08 - 2958.88] got the mushrooms red bell peppers all
[2958.08 - 2961.12] of it
[2958.88 - 2962.16] the sauce on top i'm so excited about
[2961.12 - 2965.76] this
[2962.16 - 2968.24] diane i just have to say i am a chronic
[2965.76 - 2970.16] migraine sufferer and i spent years
[2968.24 - 2972.16] trying various different meds
[2970.16 - 2973.20] but since i've started the celery juice
[2972.16 - 2976.16] i've had an incredible
[2973.20 - 2977.28] improvement in overall health the needle
[2976.16 - 2981.04] moved
[2977.28 - 2985.04] you moved diane you moved the needle
[2981.04 - 2988.24] you did it you moved the needle
[2985.04 - 2990.32] right right that's what that is and
[2988.24 - 2992.16] the disrespect out there towards celery
[2990.32 - 2994.16] juice the disrespect
[2992.16 - 2995.36] out there towards the chronically ill
[2994.16 - 2996.72] right
[2995.36 - 2999.28] and it's kind they're constantly
[2996.72 - 3000.80] insulting chronically ill 24 7 out there
[2999.28 - 3002.24] but yet you've got the health scene
[3000.80 - 3003.28] pretending they actually care about the
[3002.24 - 3005.52] chronicle when
[3003.28 - 3006.80] i've seen leaders in the health scene
[3005.52 - 3008.16] they don't really care they care about
[3006.80 - 3010.16] their pocket their dollars
[3008.16 - 3011.60] they care about their fame they care
[3010.16 - 3013.20] about their empires they're all building
[3011.60 - 3016.24] on their podcast they care about
[3013.20 - 3017.68] their empires right and then they dangle
[3016.24 - 3019.84] carrots in front of everybody
[3017.68 - 3021.60] you know like as if they're doing like
[3019.84 - 3023.68] enough right
[3021.60 - 3025.28] and then they tear apart celery juice at
[3023.68 - 3026.56] the same time seen that over and over
[3025.28 - 3029.20] right because
[3026.56 - 3030.72] why build celery juice up and make it
[3029.20 - 3031.84] into something big when no one can make
[3030.72 - 3033.36] money off of it and
[3031.84 - 3034.72] all it's going to do is get anthony
[3033.36 - 3036.56] william the medical media more
[3034.72 - 3038.48] well-known so let's keep the down low on
[3036.56 - 3040.80] the celery juice but make sure
[3038.48 - 3041.60] we're drinking it and the meanwhile the
[3040.80 - 3042.88] sad thing is
[3041.60 - 3044.32] if we cared about the chronically ill
[3042.88 - 3044.96] and we cared about people suffering like
[3044.32 - 3047.68] diane
[3044.96 - 3050.00] you with your migraines then we would be
[3047.68 - 3051.68] we would be really really making sure
[3050.00 - 3053.04] everybody knew about how this needle
[3051.68 - 3056.48] could be moved and
[3053.04 - 3058.16] and we'd have uh two billion people
[3056.48 - 3061.68] drinking celery juice right
[3058.16 - 3061.68] got a migraine chapter in the book
[3062.48 - 3066.40] and new edition migraine chapter so
[3064.56 - 3069.36] everybody knows okay
[3066.40 - 3071.20] there it is and um it's the revised
[3069.36 - 3072.72] expanded new edition
[3071.20 - 3075.04] so i made this incredible dish right

[3077.76 - 3080.56] don't know what kind of mood i'm in

[3089.84 - 3093.04] i'll probably clean up a little bit
[3091.12 - 3095.76] straighten out just for a couple of
[3093.04 - 3098.96] minutes i might take a quick jab at this
[3095.76 - 3100.32] dish right here but the suffering has
