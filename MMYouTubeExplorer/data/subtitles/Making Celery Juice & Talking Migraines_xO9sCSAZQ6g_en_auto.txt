[117.68 - 120.08] own detective and i want that for
[119.12 - 121.84] everybody i want them
[120.08 - 123.28] to everybody to be their own detective
[121.84 - 125.28] on something like that
[123.28 - 127.04] um do you have nutritional yeast in your
[125.28 - 128.16] diet do you have eggs in your diet and
[127.04 - 129.76] you probably don't have any of that
[128.16 - 131.68] right do you have caffeine in your diet

[387.52 - 390.16] juice has
[388.32 - 391.60] what it's doing i know it's doing so
[390.16 - 393.68] much for you guys but why
[391.60 - 395.44] is it helping why is it clearing up
[393.68 - 396.32] migraines how come it's helping with so
[395.44 - 398.40] many issues
[396.32 - 399.36] like what does it do i don't talk about

[406.56 - 408.88] juice
[407.28 - 410.32] you know even though celery juice is one
[408.88 - 413.20] medical medium tool
[410.32 - 414.72] but why is that tool so powerful just as
[413.20 - 416.48] i was gonna go into detail about the
[414.72 - 416.80] power it has and why it's so powerful i
[416.48 - 418.48] think
[416.80 - 420.56] it's important to know really because i
[418.48 - 422.48] i kind of brush by it a lot
[420.56 - 424.72] and it's easy to kind of just be like oh
[422.48 - 426.32] my god celery juice okay and i and i
[424.72 - 429.92] brush by it and i don't talk
[426.32 - 430.88] about the power it holds and the details
[429.92 - 434.08] and that
[430.88 - 436.24] um simply some simple healing
[434.08 - 439.76] uh i did but then got too much detox
[436.24 - 441.60] doing that every day so i did 16 ounces
[439.76 - 443.12] um every other day and worked my way up
[441.60 - 444.08] so that's to elena that's that's
[443.12 - 446.40] incredible
[444.08 - 448.32] that's actually a perfect idea and it
[446.40 - 451.44] really does work
[448.32 - 453.84] so great so great just reading the

[488.80 - 492.64] right here and it's at the bottom
[490.40 - 494.48] of the skull and that's really difficult
[492.64 - 495.36] for so many people that's one place some
[494.48 - 496.96] people get it
[495.36 - 499.84] up here in the back of the head right
[496.96 - 502.00] here some people get it um

[674.56 - 677.60] and that's it that's you just stayed
[676.24 - 679.04] sick and you tried things and if a
[677.60 - 679.92] doctor got someone better with the
[679.04 - 681.60] chronic illness
[679.92 - 683.52] one person a year was a miracle back
[681.60 - 685.28] then and so the medical medium
[683.52 - 688.32] information kind of blew the roof
[685.28 - 690.16] off of everybody being sick and
[688.32 - 691.92] this is this great opportunity for
[690.16 - 692.24] people to heal celery juice was one of
[691.92 - 694.24] those
[692.24 - 695.36] powerful tools that moved people forward
[694.24 - 697.68] and got them better
[695.36 - 699.44] and so the medical beam community
[697.68 - 701.76] actually is the community that people
[699.44 - 703.52] heal in and then the other communities
[701.76 - 705.04] started taking cues they started taking
[703.52 - 707.36] little pieces of it like
[705.04 - 708.96] they take the celery juice and they try
[707.36 - 710.00] not to talk about it too much because
[708.96 - 711.20] medical medium
[710.00 - 713.04] or they because they want their
[711.20 - 714.08] community to you know shine or whatever
[713.04 - 715.68] it is and they
[714.08 - 718.16] and they take the little tidbits that
[715.68 - 718.80] medical medium was teaching all these
[718.16 - 720.64] years
[718.80 - 722.16] third person right there teaching all
[720.64 - 723.12] these years going back for decades and
[722.16 - 725.44] decades
[723.12 - 727.60] and it's really amazing how far we've
[725.44 - 730.00] come because of mm info
[727.60 - 731.76] um fact i know everybody's like fact
[730.00 - 734.88] fact checking yeah fact
[731.76 - 737.76] fact uh fact that science research
[734.88 - 739.44] are taking information on adhd and
[737.76 - 743.28] autism from here and now
[739.44 - 746.24] uh releasing studies from the post
[743.28 - 747.76] this published material and including
[746.24 - 749.44] all kinds of other information
[747.76 - 750.96] more and more stuff comes out every day
[749.44 - 753.44] from science and research that
[750.96 - 754.80] is literally straight taken out of the
[753.44 - 757.84] medical medium book
[754.80 - 759.44] out of his book anyway so the medical
[757.84 - 761.76] medium communities are healing

[880.56 - 884.88] i'm just the
[881.52 - 887.36] messenger that gets the crap being
[884.88 - 889.60] kicked out of them
[887.36 - 890.40] for getting too many people better
[889.60 - 892.48] because you're not
[890.40 - 893.92] allowed to actually get people better
[892.48 - 895.44] you can talk
[893.92 - 897.12] about it getting people better the
[895.44 - 898.24] communities can talk about it everybody
[897.12 - 899.68] can stay sick
[898.24 - 901.28] doctors can talk about but when you
[899.68 - 902.16] start getting millions better around the
[901.28 - 905.28] world
[902.16 - 906.40] it's attention you don't want because
[905.28 - 909.44] that's against
[906.40 - 910.56] the rules baby against the rules they
[909.44 - 912.64] want people sick
[910.56 - 914.24] they want them to stay sick they don't
[912.64 - 916.48] want celery juice changing the world
[914.24 - 918.08] that's why the media wasn't kind to me
[916.48 - 918.80] over and over and over again with celery
[918.08 - 922.56] juice
[918.80 - 924.88] and other stuff okay so look if you got
[922.56 - 926.48] flashes of light you got nausea you got
[924.88 - 929.44] vomiting
[926.48 - 930.48] you know difficult speaking these are
[929.44 - 932.00] all things that
[930.48 - 934.64] which is incredible about medical medium

[938.64 - 941.76] that have gotten better they've gotten

[1320.24 - 1325.84] differently you guys different triggers
[1323.52 - 1328.16] different migraines people have
[1325.84 - 1330.16] different problems inside their body
[1328.16 - 1331.60] different toxins different issues of all
[1330.16 - 1332.88] kinds so i'm going to talk about that
[1331.60 - 1336.08] for a minute
[1332.88 - 1340.72] um doctors try to treat migraines with
[1336.08 - 1341.36] drug cocktails try this benzodiazepine
[1340.72 - 1344.16] here
[1341.36 - 1345.76] that might help try this antidepressant
[1344.16 - 1348.32] the present that might help
[1345.76 - 1349.80] try this anti-anxiety med that might
[1348.32 - 1352.80] help try this
[1349.80 - 1355.60] anti-inflammatory that could help
[1352.80 - 1356.64] let's try a combination of all of it
[1355.60 - 1360.16] let's try this
[1356.64 - 1364.24] you know serotonin inhibitor
[1360.16 - 1366.88] anyway let's try this biologic
[1364.24 - 1368.32] whatever okay people just they get
[1366.88 - 1370.08] thrown all these cocktails because the
[1368.32 - 1372.84] migraines get so bad so your doctor's
[1370.08 - 1376.48] throwing all this stuff
[1372.84 - 1379.28] okay if one group of drugs doesn't work
[1376.48 - 1379.84] your doctor will put you on another and
[1379.28 - 1381.36] another
[1379.84 - 1382.88] until you start to experience some
[1381.36 - 1386.64] symptom relief if you
[1382.88 - 1388.96] do however side effects of the drugs can
[1386.64 - 1392.24] create entirely new problems
[1388.96 - 1395.12] and they do benzodiazepines you've got a
[1392.24 - 1398.88] whole another host of crap going down
[1395.12 - 1402.08] all bunch of problems right um
[1398.88 - 1403.76] plus they might work only temporarily
[1402.08 - 1406.24] in some cases the body can develop
[1403.76 - 1408.16] resistance to a drug over time
[1406.24 - 1411.04] yet weaning yourself off the medication
[1408.16 - 1413.84] can trigger migraines too
[1411.04 - 1415.52] weaning off the medication can trigger
[1413.84 - 1416.08] migraines too if you guys just came on
[1415.52 - 1417.68] here
[1416.08 - 1419.84] i got to take things seriously i'm just

[1481.68 - 1488.40] let's go let's go let's do let's do it
[1486.56 - 1490.80] migraine triggers okay medical
[1488.40 - 1491.84] communities don't know what causes most
[1490.80 - 1494.96] migraines
[1491.84 - 1496.64] they don't it's a mystery see
[1494.96 - 1498.64] medical research and science doesn't
[1496.64 - 1501.04] know they'll take the information
[1498.64 - 1502.64] from this book though it's coming see
[1501.04 - 1504.40] they take the information from this book
[1502.64 - 1506.00] that the science research does
[1504.40 - 1507.36] right and then all the doctors
[1506.00 - 1509.36] practitioners take a little bit of the
[1507.36 - 1510.88] information from the books too that's
[1509.36 - 1512.32] out there but it's all published here
[1510.88 - 1515.84] first
[1512.32 - 1519.84] right um gianna
[1515.84 - 1522.16] anthony i did your 20-day cleanse uh
[1519.84 - 1525.12] but up leveled it by doing three
[1522.16 - 1528.88] back-to-back rounds of the advanced 369
[1525.12 - 1531.12] whoa i feel incredible
[1528.88 - 1532.40] thank you so much healing my acne and
[1531.12 - 1533.92] eye floaters slowly
[1532.40 - 1534.96] heal those eye floaters they take a
[1533.92 - 1536.72] little time because those are
[1534.96 - 1537.52] neurotoxins right the eye floaters you
[1536.72 - 1539.20] know about that
[1537.52 - 1541.68] neurotoxins do that so you're cleaning
[1539.20 - 1543.60] it up getting it better
[1541.68 - 1545.20] all right medical communities don't know
[1543.60 - 1547.60] what causes most migraines that's in
[1545.20 - 1548.56] part why they have a haphazard approach
[1547.60 - 1553.68] to treating them
[1548.56 - 1553.68] haphazard medical communities are
[1554.84 - 1559.52] haphazardous so far the big theory is
[1557.36 - 1561.04] that a neuropeptide released in the
[1559.52 - 1563.76] trigeminal system
[1561.04 - 1565.28] cranial nerves results in head pain for
[1563.76 - 1565.92] people particularly sensitive to the
[1565.28 - 1567.68] compound
[1565.92 - 1569.12] that would be great if that theory was
[1567.68 - 1571.20] real
[1569.12 - 1573.04] but that's a theory and that's all they
[1571.20 - 1574.32] got did you hear that you guys that's
[1573.04 - 1576.56] all they have
[1574.32 - 1578.08] they think it's a theory by the way the
[1576.56 - 1581.04] big theory
[1578.08 - 1582.32] that's a theory they don't have any
[1581.04 - 1584.24] thoughts or answers i mean they don't
[1582.32 - 1585.20] have any facts it's a theory no study
[1584.24 - 1587.12] shows it
[1585.20 - 1589.44] the big theory is that a neuropeptide
[1587.12 - 1591.92] released in the trigeminal system
[1589.44 - 1594.08] results in a headache that's the theory
[1591.92 - 1597.20] they've never seen that neuropeptide
[1594.08 - 1599.60] doesn't exist but some brainiac
[1597.20 - 1600.32] person from some institute or some
[1599.60 - 1602.16] whatever
[1600.32 - 1603.44] came up with the thought that that might
[1602.16 - 1606.88] be it and
[1603.44 - 1608.16] that's all they got billions of dollars
[1606.88 - 1609.60] in research that's all they got but i
[1608.16 - 1611.76] forgot that's right
[1609.60 - 1613.04] they just care about the next matcha tea
[1611.76 - 1614.56] study right
[1613.04 - 1616.64] they don't care about all the migraine
[1614.56 - 1618.32] sufferers and people literally
[1616.64 - 1619.68] losing their lives over migraines or
[1618.32 - 1622.08] living a life that's just
[1619.68 - 1624.00] you know really really hard they just
[1622.08 - 1626.40] want that next matcha tea
[1624.00 - 1627.20] discovery of an antioxidant that does
[1626.40 - 1629.36] nothing
[1627.20 - 1632.00] so that people will get more addicted to
[1629.36 - 1635.76] caffeine more and more and more
[1632.00 - 1638.48] all right the sarcasm is a little
[1635.76 - 1639.60] out there right today so far okay we got
[1638.48 - 1641.36] that
[1639.60 - 1642.88] all right let's keep on going other
[1641.36 - 1643.52] theories include that it's all in your

[1741.12 - 1744.24] all in your gut great one we don't know
[1743.76 - 1746.24] why
[1744.24 - 1747.68] and you're sick conventional medicine
[1746.24 - 1748.88] alternative medicine now but it's all in
[1747.68 - 1751.36] your gut
[1748.88 - 1753.12] oh it's the microorganism theory first
[1751.36 - 1755.68] of all the microorganism thing came from
[1753.12 - 1757.84] medical meetings worked for 35 years
[1755.68 - 1759.68] and they took it they took it they took
[1757.84 - 1761.20] it i lectured about it taught stores
[1759.68 - 1762.24] about it like health food stores all
[1761.20 - 1764.00] around the country
[1762.24 - 1765.28] i taught about lecture circuits i taught
[1764.00 - 1767.36] about in churches
[1765.28 - 1769.04] i was in church basements in front of
[1767.36 - 1772.80] 500 700 800
[1769.04 - 1775.20] 000 people all through the 1990s
[1772.80 - 1776.56] and teaching about microorganisms and
[1775.20 - 1777.52] everything and then all of a sudden
[1776.56 - 1779.44] years later oh
[1777.52 - 1781.76] no it's microorganisms it's all in your
[1779.44 - 1783.44] gut we don't see those microorganisms
[1781.76 - 1784.88] really we don't know what they do we
[1783.44 - 1785.92] don't know anything but your migraines
[1784.88 - 1789.12] are from your gut
[1785.92 - 1791.84] everything's from your gut now like what
[1789.12 - 1793.68] what a what what a ridiculous you know
[1791.84 - 1794.32] statement really it's not that's not an
[1793.68 - 1797.44] answer
[1794.32 - 1798.16] it's not an answer because people can
[1797.44 - 1800.32] hear that
[1798.16 - 1802.08] take all the probiotics and gut health
[1800.32 - 1803.44] products they want their migraines to be
[1802.08 - 1805.20] killing them you know
[1803.44 - 1806.48] flashes in the eyes migraines in the
[1805.20 - 1808.72] back of their head
[1806.48 - 1810.64] temples killing them can't function
[1808.72 - 1812.08] can't even speak or talk but no it's all
[1810.64 - 1816.08] in your gut i mean it's not an
[1812.08 - 1818.16] answer oh my doctor was injecting botox
[1816.08 - 1819.76] into my skull to stop my migraines i
[1818.16 - 1821.68] didn't even talk about that
[1819.76 - 1823.20] meaning like i know i've seen that out
[1821.68 - 1825.36] there sick
[1823.20 - 1826.88] right yeah sick right 20 years of
[1825.36 - 1827.52] debilitating migraines you have healed
[1826.88 - 1830.24] me
[1827.52 - 1832.16] so that's what they do they have they
[1830.24 - 1836.16] inject botox in the back
[1832.16 - 1838.64] of people's skulls the temples it's so

[1847.52 - 1854.48] all right let's go a little bit more
[1850.56 - 1854.48] there's more stuff to go so uh
[1856.88 - 1860.16] so and with women they usually just say
[1858.80 - 1861.44] it's hormones that's another thing so
[1860.16 - 1863.52] i'm reading the book right now medical
[1861.44 - 1865.20] medium new edition of just got on here
[1863.52 - 1866.72] and they'll just think it's hormones
[1865.20 - 1868.08] that's what they'll think it's that's
[1866.72 - 1869.44] just everything's hormones that's your
[1868.08 - 1870.16] hormones you're sick well that's your
[1869.44 - 1871.68] hormones
[1870.16 - 1873.36] you're a woman you're it's your hormones
[1871.68 - 1873.76] that's why you're sick you don't feel
[1873.36 - 1875.68] good

[1875.68 - 1878.08] depression that's your hormones what you
[1877.44 - 1880.00] got anxiety

[1881.84 - 1885.20] syndrome it's your hormones
[1883.36 - 1886.80] that's what it is it's like hormones
[1885.20 - 1889.44] hormones and hormone playing that blame
[1886.80 - 1893.12] that was since 1950 and that that was
[1889.44 - 1896.48] really difficult on so many women um
[1893.12 - 1898.96] so yeah anyway okay
[1896.48 - 1900.72] in fact it's often not just one thing
[1898.96 - 1902.40] but a combination of issues that trigger
[1900.72 - 1903.76] a migraine it's a combination of issues
[1902.40 - 1904.88] for so many people that trigger a
[1903.76 - 1907.20] migraine below
[1904.88 - 1908.80] i'll lay out the most common triggers
[1907.20 - 1910.56] read through the descriptions
[1908.80 - 1912.00] and do your best to identify the ones

[1920.08 - 1924.32] looking after you identify a single
[1922.56 - 1925.60] cause migraines often result from a
[1924.32 - 1929.36] cluster of causes two
[1925.60 - 1931.92] three four collectively act as a trigger
[1929.36 - 1933.52] cologne's perfumes air fresheners
[1931.92 - 1935.12] scented candles you guys if you guys are
[1933.52 - 1938.08] dealing with any problems

[1948.08 - 1951.28] if you're under chronic stress something
[1949.60 - 1953.60] but otherwise you're healthy you
[1951.28 - 1955.76] probably won't get migraines but if you
[1953.60 - 1957.20] also have toxic heavy metal exposure
[1955.76 - 1959.68] such as mercury aluminum
[1957.20 - 1961.28] and on top of that you're eating eggs
[1959.68 - 1963.76] and dairy products
[1961.28 - 1966.24] mucous forms because of the epstein-barr
[1963.76 - 1968.72] virus and streptococcus bacteria
[1966.24 - 1969.84] this can lead to a migraine right there
[1968.72 - 1971.84] on its own

[2170.56 - 2173.60] you won't be disappointed with that book
[2173.20 - 2176.40] don't
[2173.60 - 2178.08] get the old one make sure it's the new
[2176.40 - 2179.36] edition so let me talk about celery's
[2178.08 - 2181.28] for a second
[2179.36 - 2183.44] don't add anything to your celery juice
[2181.28 - 2184.24] if you want it to work it has to be
[2183.44 - 2186.80] straight
[2184.24 - 2187.84] celery if you want it to work i'm just
[2186.80 - 2191.12] telling you guys
[2187.84 - 2193.76] has to be straight celery okay
[2191.12 - 2194.56] if you want it to work it's so important
[2193.76 - 2200.32] to know
[2194.56 - 2202.00] right so important to know gonna get
[2200.32 - 2204.48] this stick right these sticks are
[2202.00 - 2206.64] crazy big this is the biggest sticks
[2204.48 - 2209.92] i've seen in a long time
[2206.64 - 2213.04] don't add water don't add ice
[2209.92 - 2214.80] dilutes the sodium cluster salt that is
[2213.04 - 2217.12] saving everybody's butt because the
[2214.80 - 2220.08] sodium cluster salt
[2217.12 - 2222.24] actually destroys pathogens so what
[2220.08 - 2223.92] everybody does is they have some gluten
[2222.24 - 2226.80] and they feed pathogen
[2223.92 - 2228.24] they have gluten they feed the pathogens
[2226.80 - 2230.64] they have eggs
[2228.24 - 2232.64] they feed the pathogens they spray
[2230.64 - 2235.68] perfume on themselves which is toxic
[2232.64 - 2237.28] heavy metals which feeds the pathogens
[2235.68 - 2239.04] and everybody's just feeding their
[2237.28 - 2240.80] pathogens and then what happens is when
[2239.04 - 2242.48] you do your celery juice you're killing
[2240.80 - 2245.28] off your packages
[2242.48 - 2245.28] see how that works
[2250.56 - 2254.40] ruth moore following mm protocols healed
[2253.28 - 2257.28] my hashimoto's
[2254.40 - 2259.68] ashimoto's thyroiditis you know what's
[2257.28 - 2263.44] really crazy about hashimoto's
[2259.68 - 2265.92] all these years all it means is just
[2263.44 - 2267.52] inflamed thyroid nobody knows why
[2265.92 - 2268.48] science research has a theory that your
[2267.52 - 2270.24] body's attacking
[2268.48 - 2271.60] your thyroid your body's immune system
[2270.24 - 2273.60] is attacking your thyroid
[2271.60 - 2275.20] wrong it's just a theory never they
[2273.60 - 2279.20] never saw it they never proved it
[2275.20 - 2280.80] theory it's not the immune system
[2279.20 - 2282.88] attacking the thyroid it's epstein-barr
[2280.80 - 2284.80] virus which now
[2282.88 - 2286.96] they're they're linking up steam bar
[2284.80 - 2288.96] they they took it post medical medium
[2286.96 - 2293.52] book this new edition
[2288.96 - 2293.52] so they're starting to look at that
[2294.16 - 2298.48] rob says i am a naturopath a
[2296.08 - 2300.88] nutritionist and a big fan honored
[2298.48 - 2302.96] truly honored rob seriously doesn't
[2300.88 - 2305.76] matter where the information comes from
[2302.96 - 2307.36] it works and i have tried it how many
[2305.76 - 2310.40] times do you need to do
[2307.36 - 2313.84] a liver cleanse to get better
[2310.40 - 2317.20] depends on each person are they viral
[2313.84 - 2319.84] are we talking about low-grade viruses
[2317.20 - 2321.52] are we talking about i've seen bars
[2319.84 - 2323.84] shingles hhv-6
[2321.52 - 2325.84] cytomegalovirus do they have cold sores
[2323.84 - 2326.96] ask your patient do you had get cold
[2325.84 - 2328.56] sores
[2326.96 - 2330.00] ask them if they ever had a cold sore
[2328.56 - 2331.52] that means they got the simplex one
[2330.00 - 2332.24] inside their liver so you got to kind of
[2331.52 - 2335.28] say well
[2332.24 - 2336.32] how many pathogens bugs are inside the
[2335.28 - 2338.08] liver that's one thing
[2336.32 - 2340.32] too do they have any symptoms are they
[2338.08 - 2341.92] fatigued do they have an aches and pains
[2340.32 - 2344.72] any neurological symptoms
[2341.92 - 2346.16] um that's something to us to consider of
[2344.72 - 2347.76] neurological symptoms
[2346.16 - 2349.68] and if they have neurological symptoms
[2347.76 - 2351.60] then we're dealing with definitely an
[2349.68 - 2352.24] epstein-barr we're dealing with probably
[2351.60 - 2353.92] one or
[2352.24 - 2355.60] two varieties epstein-barr this is how i
[2353.92 - 2359.36] help doctors
[2355.60 - 2360.88] and and so those are some things right
[2359.36 - 2362.00] there do they have metals
[2360.88 - 2363.44] if they're sick with a lot of
[2362.00 - 2365.52] neurological symptoms then they'll be
[2363.44 - 2367.44] viral with metals so they'll have
[2365.52 - 2369.60] viruses with metals that means the
[2367.44 - 2371.44] epstein bar the shingles is feeding off
[2369.60 - 2373.28] of toxic heavy metals
[2371.44 - 2374.72] and then releasing the neurotoxin so if
[2373.28 - 2376.16] you get people with fibro you get them
[2374.72 - 2378.08] with lupus you get them with multiple
[2376.16 - 2380.96] sclerosis you get them with cfs
[2378.08 - 2382.72] me you're dealing with viruses with
[2380.96 - 2384.32] toxic heavy metals mercury being
[2382.72 - 2385.76] predominant so then the viruses are
[2384.32 - 2388.16] feeding off of mercury then
[2385.76 - 2389.28] releasing the neurotoxin that neurotoxin
[2388.16 - 2390.80] inflames the nerves are they getting
[2389.28 - 2392.32] vertigo tinnitus are they getting
[2390.80 - 2394.32] dizziness are they getting focused
[2392.32 - 2397.04] concentration brain fog
[2394.32 - 2398.64] then you got more metals you got more
[2397.04 - 2400.16] you know stuff and then
[2398.64 - 2401.92] what kind of food are they on are they
[2400.16 - 2403.60] on nutritional yeast are they on the
[2401.92 - 2406.08] number one food group in the world
[2403.60 - 2408.24] caffeine okay just got to try to chip
[2406.08 - 2409.68] them away off that get them off the cafe
[2408.24 - 2411.04] are they on the gluten are they on the
[2409.68 - 2412.16] eggs these are all the things checked
[2411.04 - 2412.56] onto your patients see what they're
[2412.16 - 2414.24] doing
[2412.56 - 2415.76] and always know your patient might not
[2414.24 - 2416.64] be ready and you know this your seasoned
[2415.76 - 2418.16] doctor
[2416.64 - 2419.92] you you know that your patient might not
[2418.16 - 2421.52] be ready to drop the gluten or your
[2419.92 - 2424.56] patient might not be ready to
[2421.52 - 2427.52] drop the eggs or
[2424.56 - 2428.80] drop the dairy or drop the caffeine so
[2427.52 - 2430.40] then you're like whoa we got to make
[2428.80 - 2431.92] sure you do more of a liver cleanse or
[2430.40 - 2434.32] an additional liver cleanse
[2431.92 - 2436.08] so these are the variables right there
[2434.32 - 2437.60] these are just some of the variables
[2436.08 - 2440.00] you know there's a lot more variables to
[2437.60 - 2442.96] actually work with that's just some
[2440.00 - 2444.56] and the new edition really talks about
[2442.96 - 2448.24] the variables and explains it in
[2444.56 - 2450.56] in depth um too so that counts as well
[2448.24 - 2454.08] um cleans the heel is a great book as
[2450.56 - 2454.08] well so let me pour this right here
[2454.72 - 2457.60] still going to talk about celery just a
[2456.00 - 2458.72] little bit and the power celery juice
[2457.60 - 2460.96] has
[2458.72 - 2460.96] okay
[2464.24 - 2467.76] just gonna someone said he's using a
[2466.32 - 2469.60] metal strainer he's using a metal
[2467.76 - 2472.08] strainer i saw that the other day
[2469.60 - 2473.52] isn't he worried no i do a heavy metal
[2472.08 - 2475.20] detox smoothie every single day you
[2473.52 - 2478.64] can't avoid metal you're gonna you're
[2475.20 - 2481.52] not it's hard to avoid metal everywhere
[2478.64 - 2482.72] in your life it's falling out of the sky
[2481.52 - 2486.88] metal is falling
[2482.72 - 2488.48] out of the sky you're breathing it in
[2486.88 - 2490.48] you have to keep that in mind that
[2488.48 - 2494.16] you're breathing your metal
[2490.48 - 2495.52] in so you know
[2494.16 - 2497.84] that that's what people are doing
[2495.52 - 2499.36] they're breathing their metals in
[2497.84 - 2502.64] that's just some place that's just one
[2499.36 - 2504.24] place hilly says i'm so hungry when
[2502.64 - 2505.84] i do the cleanses are you getting enough
[2504.24 - 2507.52] calories which cleanse are you doing
[2505.84 - 2509.28] you're doing the 369 advance you might
[2507.52 - 2510.32] get hungry on that one that one's pretty
[2509.28 - 2513.28] strict
[2510.32 - 2514.16] and but you can increase some of the
[2513.28 - 2516.40] different fruits
[2514.16 - 2517.84] maybe add a little bit more smoothie as
[2516.40 - 2519.28] you kept more calories you're doing the
[2517.84 - 2520.80] mono eating cleanse you can increase
[2519.28 - 2522.88] more potato in there
[2520.80 - 2524.08] you can get more calories to offset
[2522.88 - 2525.52] being so hungry
[2524.08 - 2527.36] that's an option right there that's what
[2525.52 - 2527.68] i would do that's what i would do that's
[2527.36 - 2531.12] all
[2527.68 - 2532.88] um so i just juiced this beautiful
[2531.12 - 2536.08] celery juice right here
[2532.88 - 2539.60] so rano sir anthony
[2536.08 - 2543.12] can you explain to us what happens
[2539.60 - 2546.16] in the body during a migraine attack
[2543.12 - 2548.84] yeah definitely all right so um
[2546.16 - 2550.16] i wish i had some nerves and hey i got a
[2548.84 - 2554.00] brain
[2550.16 - 2556.56] got a brain here somewhere so i got this
[2554.00 - 2557.84] additional brain see so well those are
[2556.56 - 2559.12] metals right there right i got the
[2557.84 - 2560.56] little metal
[2559.12 - 2563.12] demo you see them they're shining a
[2560.56 - 2564.56] little bit okay so here's one reason why
[2563.12 - 2566.48] we get migraine attacks
[2564.56 - 2568.56] overheating of the brain so you got this
[2566.48 - 2571.04] electricity swimming around your brain
[2568.56 - 2572.40] swimming around electrical current right
[2571.04 - 2573.92] it's running through synapsis
[2572.40 - 2575.44] it's uh it's riding on neurons
[2573.92 - 2578.56] electrical currents
[2575.44 - 2579.84] and what happens is when you get toxic
[2578.56 - 2582.56] heavy metal issues
[2579.84 - 2584.16] that's a big one a big one for migraines
[2582.56 - 2585.68] and i'll talk about it in the book right
[2584.16 - 2587.92] there
[2585.68 - 2590.16] your brain overheats because the
[2587.92 - 2591.68] electricity is ricocheting off a metal
[2590.16 - 2594.80] it's riding on metal
[2591.68 - 2596.48] it's it's it's being interfered with so
[2594.80 - 2599.44] electricity running through
[2596.48 - 2601.04] your neurons neurotransmitters start to
[2599.44 - 2602.24] burn out when metals are in there
[2601.04 - 2603.68] because you're overheating so it's a
[2602.24 - 2606.00] constant overheating in the brain so the
[2603.68 - 2607.20] migraines come on easy just thoughts can
[2606.00 - 2610.40] bring on migrants just
[2607.20 - 2612.08] because if it takes electricity to think
[2610.40 - 2614.56] and then if you're under stress
[2612.08 - 2616.56] it takes that then you're actually
[2614.56 - 2618.32] really pumping that electricity and if
[2616.56 - 2618.96] you ever anybody ever gets angry if you
[2618.32 - 2621.76] ever get
[2618.96 - 2623.20] angry or upset you get hot headed right
[2621.76 - 2625.04] get the hot headed
[2623.20 - 2626.88] you know when you blow a cork in your
[2625.04 - 2628.64] hot headed no there's a tremendous
[2626.88 - 2630.80] amount of heat generated
[2628.64 - 2632.08] electricity and if you got them if you
[2630.80 - 2633.52] got the the metals
[2632.08 - 2635.12] you don't even have to get hot-headed
[2633.52 - 2637.84] you don't even have to get
[2635.12 - 2638.32] angry to get the migraines i mean it can
[2637.84 - 2639.92] happen
[2638.32 - 2641.52] just from the mercury just from the
[2639.92 - 2643.20] aluminum deposits to the mercury
[2641.52 - 2645.28] aluminum different parts of the brain
[2643.20 - 2646.56] that's just on the midline canal i mean
[2645.28 - 2647.52] just putting them in different spots
[2646.56 - 2651.04] right here
[2647.52 - 2652.80] so you know but yeah perfumes colognes
[2651.04 - 2655.52] is a great trigger perfumes and clones
[2652.80 - 2658.64] is a toxic it's basically toxic waste
[2655.52 - 2662.00] so perfumes and clones after
[2658.64 - 2665.76] shaves all of that are triggers
[2662.00 - 2667.04] because they're chemical poisons
[2665.76 - 2668.56] okay i'm going to read a couple of the
[2667.04 - 2669.60] triggers right here that's just i just
[2668.56 - 2671.60] given you one
[2669.60 - 2673.28] variety one reason another thing is if
[2671.60 - 2675.20] you have a viral headache
[2673.28 - 2676.72] like the epstein-barr headaches or the
[2675.20 - 2677.20] shingles headaches that's the other one
[2676.72 - 2679.92] too
[2677.20 - 2680.32] so you've got all these cranial nerves
[2679.92 - 2681.68] okay
[2680.32 - 2683.44] running across the face you got all
[2681.68 - 2684.96] these cranial nerves that's another
[2683.44 - 2686.40] thing too
[2684.96 - 2688.80] so you got these cranial nerves got the
[2686.40 - 2691.04] trigeminal nerve right you got the
[2688.80 - 2692.56] facial nerve so you've got these cranial
[2691.04 - 2694.56] nerves cranial nerves get
[2692.56 - 2696.32] lit up by neurotoxin so if you're
[2694.56 - 2698.24] somebody that deals with simplex one and
[2696.32 - 2700.08] you get a cold sore once a year
[2698.24 - 2701.76] that virus sits inside the trigeminal
[2700.08 - 2704.08] nerve um
[2701.76 - 2705.28] and it sits inside cranial nerves so
[2704.08 - 2707.20] you'll end up getting headaches from
[2705.28 - 2709.04] that virus you can also have shingles
[2707.20 - 2710.64] the neurotoxin from shingles
[2709.04 - 2712.24] creates all kinds of head pain
[2710.64 - 2713.52] periodically all through somebody's life
[2712.24 - 2716.00] in migraines
[2713.52 - 2718.32] um epstein-barr can release a lot of
[2716.00 - 2720.72] neurotoxins those neurotoxins inflame
[2718.32 - 2722.48] nerves too and they inflame cranial
[2720.72 - 2723.68] nerves and that's another reason why you
[2722.48 - 2724.32] get headaches i'm just giving you as
[2723.68 - 2727.44] many
[2724.32 - 2729.84] different migraines and i already told
[2727.44 - 2733.60] you guys about the simplexes right
[2729.84 - 2736.72] right so uh the usual suspects right
[2733.60 - 2738.96] are concussion meningitis
[2736.72 - 2740.40] stroke those are suspects so it's like
[2738.96 - 2742.08] well if you had a stroke
[2740.40 - 2744.24] and then you get headaches after a
[2742.08 - 2745.52] stroke doctor's gonna be like whoa you
[2744.24 - 2746.40] got your headaches because you're
[2745.52 - 2749.20] post-stroke
[2746.40 - 2750.88] right if you have meningitis in the
[2749.20 - 2752.16] moment and you have a headache because
[2750.88 - 2753.20] you have meningitis
[2752.16 - 2754.80] doctors gonna be like well your
[2753.20 - 2756.72] meningitis is actually giving you the
[2754.80 - 2757.20] headaches right usual suspects that are
[2756.72 - 2758.96] obvious
[2757.20 - 2760.56] concussion you bang your head get into
[2758.96 - 2762.00] an accident you're riding your bicycle
[2760.56 - 2764.00] you fall off your bicycle you bang your
[2762.00 - 2765.12] head you bang your head how many people
[2764.00 - 2767.84] bang their head
[2765.12 - 2769.52] going into their car right like opening
[2767.84 - 2772.80] the car door and banging it
[2769.52 - 2775.52] on the door jam well i banged my head
[2772.80 - 2776.00] enough times on the door jambs of cars
[2775.52 - 2778.48] where i
[2776.00 - 2780.08] jump in or something and you bang your
[2778.48 - 2781.44] head and you're just like oh my god what
[2780.08 - 2784.16] did i just do
[2781.44 - 2785.84] um renee i listened to the chemtrail

[2812.88 - 2816.64] this week i'm releasing the blood draw
[2815.36 - 2819.52] podcast episode
[2816.64 - 2820.88] share it with every single body you know
[2819.52 - 2823.04] everybody you know okay
[2820.88 - 2824.56] you've got a pet turtle send the link to
[2823.04 - 2828.96] your pet turtle's iphone
[2824.56 - 2828.96] okay we're in the trigger still um
[2829.60 - 2834.40] tia transient ischemic attack ischemic
[2832.96 - 2836.24] attacks are actually
[2834.40 - 2837.84] you know that could give you a migraine
[2836.24 - 2841.12] if you're having that blood
[2837.84 - 2844.80] vessel break or that blood vessel
[2841.12 - 2846.64] um tiny ischemic stroke right um
[2844.80 - 2848.08] brain aneurysm this is these are just
[2846.64 - 2849.84] obvious migraine stuff but this is the
[2848.08 - 2851.68] obvious stuff right
[2849.84 - 2853.04] brain tumor obvious but i told you
[2851.68 - 2855.04] people can have brain tumors and not
[2853.04 - 2857.04] have uh the migraine brain cyst
[2855.04 - 2859.60] microcyst that can do it repeated
[2857.04 - 2862.80] cervical nerves okay so here we go
[2859.60 - 2864.72] um let's go into a little bit more
[2862.80 - 2866.00] there's so many things there's there's
[2864.72 - 2867.60] the stress trigger
[2866.00 - 2869.60] okay i told you about the overheating
[2867.60 - 2871.44] that's one menstrual cycle
[2869.60 - 2873.36] trigger so let's read a little bit of
[2871.44 - 2875.44] that right there it's going to
[2873.36 - 2876.96] many female migraine sufferers notice
[2875.44 - 2878.64] that their migraines come on right
[2876.96 - 2879.36] before during or after the menstrual
[2878.64 - 2881.52] cycle right
[2879.36 - 2883.12] i mean that's really common it's like
[2881.52 - 2885.52] during the menstrual cycle i got my
[2883.12 - 2887.44] migraine coming on i got it coming on
[2885.52 - 2888.96] okay this is because when a woman is
[2887.44 - 2889.92] menstruating her reproductive system
[2888.96 - 2891.44] requires 80
[2889.92 - 2893.20] of her body's immune system so here's
[2891.44 - 2893.68] how it works when you go into your cycle
[2893.20 - 2894.72] 80
[2893.68 - 2897.44] of your immune system goes to your
[2894.72 - 2899.76] reproductive system 20
[2897.44 - 2901.36] is now just what's going on through your
[2899.76 - 2902.08] body right to cover the rest of your
[2901.36 - 2905.84] body
[2902.08 - 2906.16] and when that happens it you you could
[2905.84 - 2907.84] be
[2906.16 - 2910.88] fending off other things you could be
[2907.84 - 2913.44] fending off heavy metal toxicity
[2910.88 - 2915.52] epstein-barr strep all these different
[2913.44 - 2918.48] things your immune system is now
[2915.52 - 2919.68] occupied on menstruation and so
[2918.48 - 2921.52] therefore
[2919.68 - 2923.52] everything else is fair game now it's
[2921.52 - 2924.08] like epstein-barr can creep up and cause
[2923.52 - 2926.16] a problem
[2924.08 - 2927.20] your strep that causes acne can cause
[2926.16 - 2929.68] problems and now you're getting more
[2927.20 - 2930.64] acne you get migraines too from all
[2929.68 - 2933.44] these things
[2930.64 - 2935.60] um and so that's that's this is a this
[2933.44 - 2937.92] is the reason for a large
[2935.60 - 2938.88] amount a large proportion of women that
[2937.92 - 2942.24] are suffering
[2938.88 - 2943.76] okay and the book lists all the triggers
[2942.24 - 2945.20] this is the medical medium new edition
[2943.76 - 2946.32] i'm reading all the triggers right here
[2945.20 - 2947.68] i have it i don't know if you guys can
[2946.32 - 2950.80] see it see all my post-it notes
[2947.68 - 2952.80] all around the triggers okay
[2950.80 - 2954.80] so um heavy metals and other
[2952.80 - 2956.88] environmental toxic triggers so
[2954.80 - 2958.64] perfumes cologne said to candles other
[2956.88 - 2961.12] toxins laundry detergents
[2958.64 - 2961.92] major trigger right there fabric
[2961.12 - 2964.40] softeners
[2961.92 - 2966.08] boom major trigger on its own pesticides
[2964.40 - 2967.68] herbicides around a building an
[2966.08 - 2969.92] apartment building or in
[2967.68 - 2970.72] the yard or anything like that that's
[2969.92 - 2973.12] another one too
[2970.72 - 2974.96] sinus related migraines streptococcus
[2973.12 - 2976.56] causes chronic sinusitis
[2974.96 - 2978.72] and now you're in this whole thing where
[2976.56 - 2980.40] you're getting chronic sinusitis
[2978.72 - 2981.52] migraines that's another trigger all in
[2980.40 - 2983.28] it so i'm giving you guys
[2981.52 - 2985.60] whatever i can here there's so many of
[2983.28 - 2988.88] them okay
[2985.60 - 2990.48] caffeine caffeine yep
[2988.88 - 2992.96] we try to treat our migraines with
[2990.48 - 2994.88] caffeine seems to give us some relief
[2992.96 - 2996.32] but then that migraine comes back worse
[2994.88 - 2997.20] than ever because that's what caffeine
[2996.32 - 2999.20] does
[2997.20 - 3001.28] it's what goes up must come down what
[2999.20 - 3003.28] goes up must come down it's the caffeine
[3001.28 - 3005.76] nightmare okay so coffee drinks matcha
[3003.28 - 3008.00] tea chocolate cacao and other caffeine
[3005.76 - 3009.60] over stimulating and hot and highly
[3008.00 - 3011.44] aggressive to the central nervous system
[3009.60 - 3013.60] caffeine acts as a neurotoxin that can
[3011.44 - 3014.96] trigger migraines
[3013.60 - 3016.48] some people claim that chocolate and
[3014.96 - 3018.16] other forms of caffeine can help a
[3016.48 - 3018.56] migraine because the truth is these
[3018.16 - 3021.44] people
[3018.56 - 3022.16] are in and out of withdrawal you're in
[3021.44 - 3024.88] you're out
[3022.16 - 3026.00] got one step and one step out we're
[3024.88 - 3028.96] gonna do a little dance
[3026.00 - 3029.36] right that's it you're in in you're in
[3028.96 - 3031.44] or
[3029.36 - 3033.20] and out of withdrawal so you're back and
[3031.44 - 3034.88] forth back and forth
[3033.20 - 3036.72] that's what's going on there they've
[3034.88 - 3038.40] experienced that effect because caffeine
[3036.72 - 3040.32] triggers the adrenals to flood the body
[3038.40 - 3041.52] with adrenaline which acts as a steroid
[3040.32 - 3042.64] for the inflammation that causes
[3041.52 - 3045.68] migraine so what you do
[3042.64 - 3046.72] you get high in the caffeine and then it
[3045.68 - 3048.16] acts as a steroid
[3046.72 - 3049.52] because it's triggering your adrenals
[3048.16 - 3050.96] your adrenals are flooding all this
[3049.52 - 3052.40] epinephrine and now you're getting the
[3050.96 - 3054.32] epinephrine effect it's like the bee
[3052.40 - 3055.60] stinging treatment right you know the
[3054.32 - 3058.00] bee sting treatment
[3055.60 - 3058.88] okay that people do that bee stinging
[3058.00 - 3061.20] treatment
[3058.88 - 3063.12] gives you the ultimate adrenaline high
[3061.20 - 3066.64] because you just got stung
[3063.12 - 3068.80] by a bee it's not getting you better
[3066.64 - 3070.88] it's not going to heal you because the
[3068.80 - 3072.08] bee sting treatment can't heal you but
[3070.88 - 3074.48] what it does
[3072.08 - 3076.24] is it causes your adrenals to flood a
[3074.48 - 3077.68] tremendous amount of epinephrine because
[3076.24 - 3080.32] you're stung by a bee
[3077.68 - 3081.36] that epinephrine is self-steroidal
[3080.32 - 3083.28] treatment so you're
[3081.36 - 3084.80] treating with self steroids that's what
[3083.28 - 3087.84] the bee sting therapy is
[3084.80 - 3089.36] it's you're using your own adrenaline to
[3087.84 - 3092.40] and that's medical medium information
[3089.36 - 3095.20] nobody knows why the bees things work or
[3092.40 - 3095.84] band-aid that's the point they don't fix
[3095.20 - 3098.32] a disease
[3095.84 - 3099.76] condition they band-aid things for the
[3098.32 - 3102.00] moment right
[3099.76 - 3103.84] and so the bee sting therapy is band-aid
[3102.00 - 3105.36] nobody knew why they band-aid
[3103.84 - 3107.20] but i've been teaching why they band-aid
[3105.36 - 3108.72] for years it's because once you get
[3107.20 - 3109.36] stung by the bees so you put the bee in
[3108.72 - 3111.04] the cup
[3109.36 - 3112.32] you stick don't do this i'm not saying
[3111.04 - 3113.68] do this do not do this i'm not
[3112.32 - 3115.76] recommending this but you put the b
[3113.68 - 3117.28] they put the b in the cup they stick the
[3115.76 - 3119.04] beat the cup on their leg
[3117.28 - 3120.56] the b kind of swims around in the cup
[3119.04 - 3122.24] for a little bit and then it goes down
[3120.56 - 3122.80] to the leg and then goes boom and you're
[3122.24 - 3124.64] stung
[3122.80 - 3126.08] and then your adrenals are flooding
[3124.64 - 3128.40] flooding flooding flooding
[3126.08 - 3129.36] and now you're being self-treated with
[3128.40 - 3130.72] adrenaline
[3129.36 - 3133.04] you got a steroid you're being
[3130.72 - 3135.44] self-treated see how it works
[3133.04 - 3137.44] well same thing with caffeine with
[3135.44 - 3140.56] migraines in other conditions
[3137.44 - 3141.44] it's self treating that's what you're
[3140.56 - 3142.96] doing you're self
[3141.44 - 3144.88] treating with adrenaline so i'm gonna
[3142.96 - 3146.48] get jacked up and high on caffeine
[3144.88 - 3147.84] i'm gonna do it now that everybody keeps
[3146.48 - 3149.44] on saying it's good for you i really
[3147.84 - 3151.60] feel like i can do it it's freaky
[3149.44 - 3152.96] for you know fair game i could do it
[3151.60 - 3154.56] free game let's do it
[3152.96 - 3155.84] and you're doing all the caffeine and
[3154.56 - 3156.96] you're you're feeling like you're
[3155.84 - 3158.72] self-treating
[3156.96 - 3160.48] and then all that adrenaline is doing
[3158.72 - 3162.00] that it's trying to get the inflammation
[3160.48 - 3162.40] down and then when that adrenaline wears
[3162.00 - 3165.36] off
[3162.40 - 3166.00] caffeine wears off boom you're back to
[3165.36 - 3169.04] square one
[3166.00 - 3169.92] you're in you're out of withdrawal all
[3169.04 - 3171.28] right so
[3169.92 - 3173.92] a couple of different things there
[3171.28 - 3175.20] there's gluten is a trigger eggs are a
[3173.92 - 3177.36] trigger

[3288.16 - 3292.00] helpful all on its own right there it's
[3289.68 - 3294.72] one of the healing tools i got the
[3292.00 - 3295.76] celery juice right here i just made but
[3294.72 - 3297.28] it's there's there's
[3295.76 - 3298.88] medical meaning protocols are not just
[3297.28 - 3300.40] celery juice just got to know that
[3298.88 - 3302.00] medical mean protocols are more than
[3300.40 - 3303.36] just celery juice oil this is one of the
[3302.00 - 3307.44] healing tools
[3303.36 - 3310.56] this is the mm-900 hds 50 off right now
[3307.44 - 3314.08] mm-900 hds this is the juicer i use
[3310.56 - 3316.72] i told you guys so many times um
[3314.08 - 3317.52] so it's it's a powerhouse for making
[3316.72 - 3320.40] sure that you're
[3317.52 - 3323.12] you're here's what happens right your
[3320.40 - 3325.04] pulp comes out dry
[3323.12 - 3326.72] and that's what counts when it comes out
[3325.04 - 3328.08] dry okay
[3326.72 - 3330.48] then you're saving all this money you're
[3328.08 - 3333.68] squeezing every last drop out of your
[3330.48 - 3336.00] celery that's the mm-900 hds it's the
[3333.68 - 3338.36] one i use it's incredible so i just use
[3336.00 - 3341.12] the celery with this okay
[3338.36 - 3343.60] megajuicers.com it's the celery juicer
[3341.12 - 3347.20] it's the only model that does the celery
[3343.60 - 3347.20] juice and it does everything else too
[3347.68 - 3351.84] yeah that's funny margaret been
[3350.16 - 3353.92] educating myself no one
[3351.84 - 3355.04] no one putting butter in your coffee
[3353.92 - 3357.12] yeah the
[3355.04 - 3358.96] butter in your coffee is bad idea it's a
[3357.12 - 3361.12] bad idea for so many reasons
[3358.96 - 3362.32] i mean look i'm not trying to you know
[3361.12 - 3364.16] harp on anybody
[3362.32 - 3366.24] out there but i'm just saying that i i
[3364.16 - 3367.76] think that that's probably one of the
[3366.24 - 3369.60] worst you may as well have the eggs in
[3367.76 - 3370.96] the bacon and the toast with it with the
[3369.60 - 3373.76] butter and the coffee
[3370.96 - 3376.08] and um getting jacked up on caffeine all
[3373.76 - 3377.52] on its own is terrible for people just
[3376.08 - 3380.64] terrible
[3377.52 - 3384.08] anyway not organic celery is okay
[3380.64 - 3386.96] so celery that's not organic is okay
[3384.08 - 3387.84] so that's what celery that's not organic
[3386.96 - 3391.68] is okay
[3387.84 - 3393.60] um just try to wash it good the benefits
[3391.68 - 3397.36] of non-organic celery
[3393.60 - 3398.48] outweighs the bad that's how incredible
[3397.36 - 3400.16] it is and you're still going to get
[3398.48 - 3401.84] pesticide exposure anyway
[3400.16 - 3403.36] you're going to get pesticide herbicide
[3401.84 - 3404.48] fungicide exposure all the time
[3403.36 - 3406.00] everybody does
[3404.48 - 3407.68] they get it on their clothes they get it
[3406.00 - 3408.88] on there to get it on their furniture
[3407.68 - 3410.24] coming out of the furniture
[3408.88 - 3411.60] they get it from you know sprays
[3410.24 - 3412.96] floating in the air every day they're
[3411.60 - 3414.64] just getting it so
[3412.96 - 3416.48] so yeah you want your celery no matter
[3414.64 - 3419.84] what okay
[3416.48 - 3422.32] and um different farms
[3419.84 - 3423.52] you know plus celery i mean they grow
[3422.32 - 3425.20] different types of celery different
[3423.52 - 3425.92] farms it doesn't always look the same
[3425.20 - 3427.28] it's different
[3425.92 - 3429.12] the way it grows and everything and it
[3427.28 - 3430.64] tastes different so this one happens
[3429.12 - 3431.76] tastes really good look at these big
[3430.64 - 3433.44] juicy stalks

[3433.44 - 3437.36] stuck with the more the leafy
[3435.28 - 3439.04] spindly green kind that's really
[3437.36 - 3440.64] astringent still healing
[3439.04 - 3442.72] but really astringent so giving you a
[3440.64 - 3445.92] little tips on celery on that level
[3442.72 - 3447.52] okay they taste different but the leaves
[3445.92 - 3448.96] are okay if you don't want to take them
[3447.52 - 3451.28] off you don't have to take the leaves
[3448.96 - 3453.60] off you can keep them on
[3451.28 - 3455.04] so yeah any tips i can give you but but
[3453.60 - 3456.48] you guys um
[3455.04 - 3458.24] i just want to run one more thing down
[3456.48 - 3460.16] about celery juice what it does is it
[3458.24 - 3461.68] goes through your intestinal tract right
[3460.16 - 3464.40] it starts to clean up old
[3461.68 - 3465.36] debris shouldn't be there petrified
[3464.40 - 3467.28] proteins attach
[3465.36 - 3469.28] the linings rancid fats attach to the
[3467.28 - 3472.00] linings of your intestinal walls
[3469.28 - 3472.32] it starts to cleanse that stuff out it
[3472.00 - 3473.84] goes
[3472.32 - 3475.36] up into your liver so i just want to
[3473.84 - 3475.76] give you this one quick run down right
[3475.36 - 3477.92] here
[3475.76 - 3479.52] okay that's your liver right there when
[3477.92 - 3482.96] you're drinking your celery
[3479.52 - 3485.36] juice okay all right hepatic portal
[3482.96 - 3486.40] highway which is your veins going into
[3485.36 - 3488.32] your liver
[3486.40 - 3489.84] that stem off of your intestinal tract
[3488.32 - 3492.08] so here it is so
[3489.84 - 3494.08] sending off of your intestinal tract all
[3492.08 - 3495.20] right right here so you drink your
[3494.08 - 3497.52] celery juice
[3495.20 - 3498.96] you know and it's going down going down
[3497.52 - 3500.72] now it's going into your intestinal
[3498.96 - 3502.56] tract your celery juice okay
[3500.72 - 3503.92] it ends up going into these tiny blood
[3502.56 - 3506.08] vessels in your
[3503.92 - 3507.68] small intestinal tract and it ends up
[3506.08 - 3509.76] all connecting to the paddock portal
[3507.68 - 3512.24] highway up into your liver
[3509.76 - 3514.80] is where it connects up into your liver
[3512.24 - 3516.32] and so when it gets up into your liver
[3514.80 - 3518.96] that's when the celery juice does its
[3516.32 - 3520.56] magic it starts to revitalize the liver
[3518.96 - 3522.64] sodium cluster salts start to kill off
[3520.56 - 3524.40] epstein-barr shingles other pathogens
[3522.64 - 3525.04] streptococcus you name it it starts to
[3524.40 - 3527.04] clean it all
[3525.04 - 3528.56] up that's one thing it does and guess
[3527.04 - 3531.92] what that celery juice
[3528.56 - 3532.80] finds itself up boop the duct into the
[3531.92 - 3534.80] gallbladder
[3532.80 - 3536.16] starts to loosen up some of that sludge
[3534.80 - 3538.96] and dissolve it
[3536.16 - 3540.72] dissolves gallstones it has a dissolving
[3538.96 - 3542.48] gallstone dissolving power that's what
[3540.72 - 3543.68] the celery juice has these are just some
[3542.48 - 3546.72] of the things it does
[3543.68 - 3548.56] and it's killing pathogens as
[3546.72 - 3550.16] its happenings pathogens that sit in
[3548.56 - 3551.60] people's gallbladders people got strep
[3550.16 - 3552.96] in their gallbladders they get strep
[3551.60 - 3555.28] infections in there
[3552.96 - 3556.00] they get all kinds of other stuff and
[3555.28 - 3558.40] it's the
[3556.00 - 3559.44] killer of the bugs that's what the
[3558.40 - 3561.52] celery juice does
[3559.44 - 3562.48] it's the killer of the bugs and that's
[3561.52 - 3564.24] why i love it
[3562.48 - 3566.24] and it's cleaning up the intestinal
[3564.24 - 3567.84] tract getting rid of old debris trapped
[3566.24 - 3569.28] in pockets slowly
[3567.84 - 3570.88] so when you're on your celery juice year
[3569.28 - 3572.48] after year you're really starting to
[3570.88 - 3574.00] clean everything out unless you keep on
[3572.48 - 3575.52] putting everything bad back in and
[3574.00 - 3578.56] that's a whole other story
[3575.52 - 3580.16] all right but i talk about in the books
