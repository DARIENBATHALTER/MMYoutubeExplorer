00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:16,439
these different things we go to the

34
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:18,159
doctor for and we can't get answers and

35
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:20,040
we go to Alternative doctors we can't

36
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,439
get answers too we it's well you go to

37
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,400
Alternative doctors usually just blamed

38
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:27,040
on candida we can't just do that because

39
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,640
a lot of what happens is with gut health

40
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,040
is a lot of people they can get better

41
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,119
from a little while then it all comes

42
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:37,240
back or they don't get better at all or

43
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:38,479
it gets worse over time or they do get

44
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,560
better because they you know there's

45
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,040
some people that get better and they

46
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,799
removed you know uh gluten out of their

47
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,840
diet and they removed a little dairy

48
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,399
products out of their diet or they

49
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,079
cleaned it up they got rid of pastries

50
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,439
cookies and cakes and they did get

51
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,520
better but there's a lot of people that

52
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:55,159
don't and they do everything and

53
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,840
everything and anything to actually try

54
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:59,880
to get their guts better and look I know

55
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,719
how frustrating is so today's show is

56
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,960
gut health and we're going to talk about

57
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:06,320
this poor absorption and tummy pains and

58
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,800
everything around it and it's just a

59
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,840
sign that our guts need attention and so

60
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,200
this is serious we're addressing this

61
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:16,000
today because who has 10 or 20 30 years

62
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,599
to wait for answers for the illnesses

63
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,480
I've said this before I say it again

64
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:21,280
that I've seen people wait a long time

65
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,440
for

66
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,920
answers and you know when it comes down

67
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,239
to gut health the reason why a lot of

68
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,959
people don't get better is because the

69
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:32,760
information out there the newest

70
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:36,400
information out there is is has dust on

71
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:38,080
it and it's old it's old information and

72
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,560
you know someone was telling me the

73
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,640
other day they said you know you got to

74
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,720
you think pretty big of yourself Mr

75
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,800
medical medium because you're talking

76
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,680
about how new information and you're

77
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,000
talking about how new books and new

78
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,280
things that are coming out about gut

79
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,560
health you're talking about how that's

80
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:56,000
old and outdated and I'm like yeah cuz

81
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,280
it is it is old and outdated it's not

82
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,800
about you know what I believe in what I

83
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,879
think what it's about somebody getting

84
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,680
better and having the right information

85
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:05,280
so yeah I might come across sounding a

86
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,720
little bit arrogant someone said oh you

87
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,280
seem like you might be arrogant because

88
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,680
you got all the answers that's not it at

89
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:14,840

00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,640
to heal and move forward because you can

93
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:24,159
you know and when I look into the latest

94
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,640
information it's even out there cuz

95
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,280
someone says hey look at this I'm like

96
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,360
whoo and I'm all excited and I look at

97
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,080
him I'm like look this stuff is ancient

98
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,640
history already ancient history before

99
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,200
it was even minted you know everything

100
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,480
about candida that's that's wrong

101
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,720
totally wrong and we're going to cover

102
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:44,200
cover candida a little bit today

103
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:46,799
everything about leaky gut totally wrong

104
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:49,239
I mean there's there's I mean I'm seeing

105
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,360
stuff on the scene right now about leaky

106
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:55,879
gut it was 20 years ago and it was wrong

107
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:58,400
20 years ago it was was misinformation

108
00:03:55,879 --> 00:04:01,239
20 years ago look I have to find this

109
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,519
humorous I have to make because it's sad

110
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:05,799
it's sad because that's 20 years of

111
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,799
someone not getting the information they

112
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:09,200
need to get their gut better to get

113
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:12,239
their health better because it affects

114
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,920
their families it affects their lives it

115
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,359
gets in the way of everything and the

116
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:19,519
suffering occurs I have to keep a sense

117
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,600
of humor about it because it kills me it

118
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,800
kills me to watch it I've watched it in

119
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,800
young people I've watched it in

120
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,080
teenagers I've watched it in kids I've

121
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,680
watched it in older people I've watched

122
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,800
people lose their jobs I've watched

123
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,360
people suffer I've watched people you

124
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,280
know have you know difficult lives they

125
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,199
get divorces over it because they can't

126
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,120
eat anything the other person can eat

127
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,280
and whatnot and it causes problems I've

128
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,000
seen it all and so when someone says hey

129
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:45,840
you seem to be pretty arrogant no what

130
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,400
it is what it is is is the crap coming

131
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,320
out in books and information and

132
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,960
literature and everything else in the

133
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,880
best sense meaning even including all

134
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,840
the alternative about gut health is so

135
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,720
way off it's ridiculous and it's not

136
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,000
about me being like hey I got all the

137
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,919
answers it's about the TR truth it's

138
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,039
about what's really happening in the gut

139
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,560
it's about what's wrong it's about what

140
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:07,320
spirit says and it's about you getting

141
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:10,000
better cuz and the bottom line is I

142
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:12,440
don't care I don't care whose feelings I

143
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,360
heard out there when it comes down to

144
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,919
you it's it's about getting you better

145
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,800
it's about you having the right

146
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:21,600
information so you know I don't care if

147
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,919
a brand new book comes off the running

148
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,800
and it's about leaky gut you know and

149
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:29,000
and meanwhile when you look in it and

150
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,120
it's literally 20 30 years old

151
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,560
information is even the new information

152
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,160
and it is wrong right off the press and

153
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,800
I'm like oh here we go again here we go

154
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,880
again how many people are going to be

155
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:43,199
led down a path for another 10 years oh

156
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,039
my God and you know what that's okay

157
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,440
that's okay if I didn't have to see the

158
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,600
suffering myself that's okay if I didn't

159
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,039
have to see it it being real but it's

160
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,600
real people are going through hell and

161
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:57,240
back with their guts in testinal tracks

162
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:01,280
no one's clearing the air about it no

163
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:03,000
one is I have to do that I have to do it

164
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,840
I need you feeling better you need to

165
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,039
know what's going on and we're covering

166
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:10,080
a couple of really cool things something

167
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:13,720
that nobody knows about nobody bottom

168
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:16,240

book is packed and I mean packed I mean

174
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:31,080
I I literally I basically thought I was

175
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:34,039
going to stroke out writing that book

176
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:37,039
okay right because I was taking so much

177
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:38,759
data from Spirit so much data and

178
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,840
information from Spirit that's never

179
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:43,199
been taught anywhere or learned or

180
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:45,800
anywhere it's not offered anywhere about

181
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,520
what over 50 fruits and vegetables what

247
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,760

248
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:23,200

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,880
Hashimoto's I bought everything and it

253
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:34,040
doesn't even tell you what causes it

254
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:37,720
exactly exactly because there's nothing

255
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:39,720
new out there and it has to change now

256
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:42,560
it has to change and you know and I've

257
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:45,320
had moms they're crying because their

258
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,399
15-year-old daughter is sick with things

259
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:50,279
that she was sick with and and still

260
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:53,760
nothing's done about it and and and it

261
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:55,640
goes on and it goes on and it goes on

262
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,640
and you know and and it's hitting young

263
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:02,279
people

264
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:06,040
177% 17 out of 100 college

265
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:09,120
students go home leave College in the

266
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:11,640
middle of college and don't go back and

267
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,440
don't go back it's not because they

268
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,800
couldn't do the studies meaning like

269
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:19,320
it's not because they weren't brilliant

270
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:22,600
they left because they were sick 17 out

271
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:25,000
of a 100 you do the math how many

272
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:28,440

00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,480
school every year okay across this

291
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,959
said I don't care if I'm on the edge of

292
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:15,720
stroking out getting that information

306
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:53,639

and and you know what's

311
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,800
interesting is back and I've said this

312
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,680
before I'm going to say it again back in

313
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:10,399
the in the80s what happened was when we

314
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:12,839
were at that crossroads where

315
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,519
conventional medicine was was just it

316
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:16,120
was just conventional medicine if you

317
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:19,000
were in naturopath you were just

318
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:22,279
completely thought of as just crap total

319
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,920
crap if you were an naturopath in 1980

320
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:27,040
okay and this was a really dangerous

321
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:30,000
time dangerous time for naturopaths

322
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:32,160
natural medicine hop you know home paths

323
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,760
chiropractors that thought beyond the

324
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,839
normal you you name it that was this was

325
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:39,760
a really bad time this was when we were

326
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,440
completely divided right now you have

327
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,680
clinics where there's conventional

328
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,120
doctors you got clinics where there's

329
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,440
natural doctors and they're all all

330
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:48,160
working together you even look at some

331
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,160
of the most popular clinics now it's

332
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,639
like they got they got a nutritionist in

333
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,519
there they got a naturopath in there

334
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:57,399
they they got a functional integrated a

335
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,440
functional medicine doctor in there and

336
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:01,120
then MDS are flipping over they're like

337
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,880
they're not MDS anymore they're MDS and

338
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,560
they're functional doctors right this

339
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,959
didn't exist back in the 80s it was the

340
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:09,760
Dark Ages and we might still be in the

341
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:11,440
dark ages of misinformation right now

342
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,959
but we're not in the dark ages of where

343
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:17,839
we were as far as collaborating and back

344
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:19,440
then I mean it was like it was insane it

345
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,720
was you went to the doctor you you were

346
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,079
told it was all in your head so if you

347
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,040
were a woman you went to the doctor you

348
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:26,639
told you were insane you told you were

349
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:29,120
lazy you're told you were crazy your

350
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,199
blood work checked out fine antiquated

351
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,959
antique blood work which we still use

352
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:37,040
now you told you were fine and that's it

353
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,440
you get you get sent home that was the

354
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:42,120
80s okay and but what happened was it

355
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,199
was happening in such a degree and so so

356
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:46,079
so much of that was happening the

357
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:47,760
naturopaths came on the scene I mean

358
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,519
they were always around but they were

359
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,360
really starting to come in and file out

360
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,959
of schools there was an explosion in

361
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,079
the80s and they they're filing you know

362
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:59,040
they're filing out where each state had

363
00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:01,279
a few met naturopaths now which was

364
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,560
which was which was unbelievable in some

365
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:05,360
states in the US think about it okay and

366
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:07,199
you know the first the first naturopath

367
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,279
in California which I actually know

368
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,920
personally the first first natural path

369
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:14,639
in California you know coming out in the

370
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:16,120
late 70s early 80s and California where

371
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,519
you know isn't that where everything

372
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,680
happens first

373
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,759
supposingly right and so the first you

374
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,839
know naturopath came out but what

375
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:26,480
happened was you know naturopaths and

376
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:28,160
natural medicine need some needed

377
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,480
something to hold on to something to

378
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,279
bite their teeth into because what was

379
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,720
happening is there was a flood of people

380
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:36,720
flood of women like I'm sick I'm sick

381
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,519
you know uh uh you know I went went to

382
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,279
10 conventional doctors no answers that

383
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:41,680
still happens today went to 20

384
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:43,800
conventional doctors still still no

385
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,079
answers that still happens today though

386
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,759
and what happened was the candida

387
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:49,639
diagnosis was born it exploded it was an

388
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:51,800
amazing diagnosis because it was like

389
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:54,600
whoa you got some you got candida you

390
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:56,720
got candida overgrowth in your gut

391
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,120
that's what's going on here and what it

392
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,320
did was it was like it was like uh an

393
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,399
Awakening it was like Angels came out of

394
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:07,199
the sky and like the heavens parted and

395
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:09,079
it was like and Jesus just baby Jesus

396
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:12,480
came down I mean it was like that kind

397
00:15:09,079 --> 00:15:14,839
of moment that was the kind of moment

398
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:18,759
where you know hey there is something

399
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:21,079
wrong with me and but it wasn't really

400
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:23,680
candida in the end that's why we've gone

401
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:25,079
from candida to today right now we're

402
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:28,920
going to

403
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:32,240
sibo sibo small intestinal bacteria over

404
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:35,120
sibo we're going into that land now you

405
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:37,000
know and that was the land that 30 years

406
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,800
ago when spirit said hey it's not

407
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,279
candida Spirit knew it was overgrowth of

408
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:44,360
different forms of bacteria and it

409
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:47,759
wasn't candida see Spirit was ahead of

410
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:50,519
its time 30 years so I've been able to

411
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:52,360
help people for 30 years who didn't have

412
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:54,880
to go through the candida ride which is

413
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:57,519
kill your candida kill your candida this

414
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,399
you know what I mean the whole bit so

415
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,120
and even sios miss misunderstood right

416
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:02,399
now because sio is still a

417
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,319
misunderstanding of what kind of

418
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,920
bacteria is in the gut that's causing

419
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:08,800
that over what oh what is the

420
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:11,440
proliferation of bacteria well it's

421
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:14,319
mostly strepa cacus and it's it's it's

422
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:17,240
antibiotic resistant strep sibo is a

423
00:16:14,319 --> 00:16:18,680
development of strep that's been in

424
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,240
someone's system and they've taken

425
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,959
antibiotics through childhood or any

426
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,880
other time in their life and they fed

427
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:26,360
the strep strep got stronger then it

428
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,759
overgrew later and when you get older

429
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,079
and your immune system starts breaking

430
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,759
down you're not taking care of yourself

431
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:32,319
and you're stressed out the strep grows

432
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:34,000
even more proliferates even more and

433
00:16:32,319 --> 00:16:36,639
that's what sibo is nobody even knows

434
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,880
that yet so I'm giving you Advanced

435
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:43,079
information right there all on its own

436
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,560
so you know the bottom line is this is

437
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:45,759
we're going to cover a few good things

438
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,519
we're going to talk about leaky gut

439
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,440
let's start with leaky gut okay we're

440
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,600
just going to have to do that someone

441
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,319
says you have leaky gut chances are you

442
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,000
don't have leaky gut leaky gut if you

443
00:16:54,319 --> 00:16:58,440
had leaky gut you'd be in the in the

444
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,079
hospital with 105 temperature which

445
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:02,800
accept this and dying so you don't have

446
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:03,839
leaky gut you have to understand that

447
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,679
something went wrong with the whole

448
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,880
leaky gut Concept in fact there's even

449
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:10,839
new new information new books out now

450
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:12,480
talking about leaky gut totally totally

451
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:14,000
Antiquated

452
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,760
information

453
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
unbelievable yeah I mean it's been

454
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:21,959
superseded it's it it's just

455
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,760
unbelievable and so leaky gut isn't just

456
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:25,959
this this whole thing where you got you

457
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,600
got this permeability happening where

458
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:31,480
where all this debris and stuff is going

459
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:33,120
through the intestinal lining and gases

460
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:36,160
are going through the intestinal lining

461
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:38,240
that's not really what it is first of

462
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,440
first of all if you had diverticulitis

463
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,720
diverticulosis and it got even to the

464
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:46,679
point where something escaped to the

465
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:49,520
other side we're talking 104 temperature

466
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:52,000
we're talking emergency

467
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,799
crisis so not even people that have

468
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,960
eruptions in their colon where they have

469
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:58,000
Diverticulitis and eruptions have leaky

470
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,000
gut it would have to go even past that

471
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,360
situation

472
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,200
ation see that's that's how it works

473
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,679
this is where it's so misinformed on

474
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,880
leaky gut I I I don't mean to be a pain

475
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:10,159
in the butt about at all I don't it's

476
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,720
just that what am I supposed to do just

477
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:13,600
go along with it and not give you guys

478
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:18,799
the right information to heal I I don't

479
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:20,960
get it so it's so the deal is look so if

480
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,960
you've been diagnosed with leaky gut

481
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,159
that chances are you don't have leaky

482
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,120
gut it's not what's happening do you

483
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:29,799
have problems in your intestinal tract

484
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,240
yeah you definitely could have problems

485
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:32,760
a lot of people don't have any problems

486
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,200
in their intestinal tract and they they

487
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,799
feel sick they got fatigue they got

488
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,880
Epstein bar they got shingles they got

489
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:39,559
other problems they got you know other

490
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,480
stuff going on and it's still blamed on

491
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:43,520
leaky gut cuz you know it's it's that

492
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,640
kind of thing you know so you go to a

493
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,480
gut health doctor you're going to get

494
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,799
leaky gut diagnosis go to Lyme doctor

495
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,200
you're going to get a lime do you know

496
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:51,799
diagnosis go to Multiple Sclerosis

497
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,400
doctor you're going to get an MS do you

498
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:58,679
know diagnosis I mean have I said enough

499
00:18:54,400 --> 00:19:01,679
does it go on and on and on so so um the

500
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:04,720
deal is with leaky gut that's not what's

501
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:08,320
happening what does happen though is our

502
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:11,200
liver okay produces less bile due to

503
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:12,880
stress due to Foods we're eating okay

504
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,679
especially if we're eating lots of high

505
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:18,039
fat densed foods or we're eating foods

506
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:19,559
that have lots of fat and sugar combined

507
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:22,400
like like a chocolate cake which has

508
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:24,720
tons of lard and then it has you know

509
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,400
some some it say tons of lard and then

510
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:30,480
has table sugar involved or corn syrup

511
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:33,480
involved but whatever it is that we're

512
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,840
eating over time it breaks down the it

513
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:37,000
breaks down the liver it gets the liver

514
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:39,280
to become more fatty more pre fatty and

515
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,840
it's usually due to real high intensity

516
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:45,520
of fats in in our diet for too many

517
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:47,400
years so our liver breaks down

518
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:50,440
bioproduction

519
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:53,880
minimizes okay so so that minimizes

520
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:55,640
hydrochloric acid minimizes hydrochloric

521
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,400
acid is a blend of seven acids

522
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:59,960
undiscovered by science today you want

523
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:02,080
to know you want to know the future I'm

524
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:05,360
going to tell you some of the future to

525
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:08,799
begin with like I said hydrochloric acid

526
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:11,039
isn't one acid that's not one acid in

527
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:13,000
the stomach it's a blend of seven they

528
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:15,320
just have not been able to single it out

529
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,080
yet and figure it out and like I've said

530
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:20,039
before we don't know what happens to

531
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,760
food when it drops into the stomach yeah

532
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:23,880
there's absorption yeah there's

533
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,760
digestion there's a simulation let me

534
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,280
tell you something God only knows what

535
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,320
happens the minute food enters that

536
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,080
stomach I promise see that that's a

537
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:34,720
thousand years from now we're going to

538
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:37,720
know exactly how everything works but

539
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,600
the bottom line is um the bile gets you

540
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:42,520
know less production of bile from the

541
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:46,799
liver liver gets pre- fatty liver as

542
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:49,080
time goes on okay and as all this is

543
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:52,919
happening your hydrochloric acid breaks

544
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:56,440
down so you get low HCL so that's

545
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:59,480
breaking down when that's breaking down

546
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:02,240
then um food doesn't digest well and it

547
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:04,520
starts to rot and it gets down into the

548
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,919
intestinal tract and it starts to rot

549
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:11,360
when it starts to rot it produces

550
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:14,520
ammonia ammonia ammonia is a is

551
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,960
basically an agent that can move through

552
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:19,279
any part of the

553
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:21,720
body it can move through muscle so it

554
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:23,559
has nothing to do with leaky gut it can

555
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:27,200
move through

556
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:29,919
organs ammonia can move through an organ

557
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,720
like a ghost moves through a house and

558
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:37,000
goes through the

559
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:39,440
wall okay you can have a perfectly sound

560
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,440
amazing intestinal

561
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:47,520
lining that doesn't have one callus on

562
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:50,080
it not one pup not one callus not one

563
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:53,919
hole from a bacterial infection from 30

564
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:56,640
years ago not one anything wrong with it

565
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:59,400
and ammonia will move through your

566
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:02,200
intestinal track just like a ghost moves

567
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:03,840
through a wall if you believe in ghosts

568
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,559
of course you know some somebody out

569
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,520
there might not believe in ghosts so I

570
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:08,960
don't want to you know insult anybody or

571
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,360
whatever I'm just

572
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:15,360
saying and and so it's the same kind of

573
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:17,600
thing that occurs so it and it moves

574
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,760
through organs that ammonia it moves

575
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,000
through

576
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:25,120
muscle it there's nothing that stops IT

577
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,559
from going right through the human

578
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:30,200
body and then out of the human body

579
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,880
ammonia just comes right through the

580
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,799
skin the skin doesn't even stop it it

581
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:36,440
just leaks right out of the skin has

582
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:39,400
nothing to do with leaky gut on any

583
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:41,640
level on any level it's called ammonia

584
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:43,760
permeability ammonia permability is a

585
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:47,240
word that's in my book that Spirit came

586
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:49,240
up with for me to teach people so it's

587
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,240
our word over here and it's called

588
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:54,240
ammonia permeability and it's from

589
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:56,960
ammonia leaking through the entire

590
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,679
body and and that's just the bottom line

591
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,919
that's how it works so that's that's

592
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:04,840
what occurs now that's not leaky gut on

593
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:07,080
any level on any way because this

594
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:08,120
doesn't mean you're going to feel sick

595
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,760
ammonia

596
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:12,320
permeability doesn't make you tired

597
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:16,400
doesn't make you

598
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:18,279
sick and it doesn't hurt you it's other

599
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,960
things that happen in the gut that have

600
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:24,279
nothing to do with candida or leaky gut

601
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:26,039
that end up hurting you it's that break

602
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:28,320
it's that breakdown of the liver meaning

603
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:29,919
the liver being stagnant sluggish it's

604
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,520
food not breaking

605
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:36,120
down okay it's food not breaking down

606
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:39,799
and rotting and then starting to feed

607
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:43,440
STP starting to feed eoli starting to

608
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:45,320
feed seiff starting to feed Mera I mean

609
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,640
we get exposed to all this stuff you

610
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:49,000
know you just visit a friend in a

611
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,760
hospital and and you know I mean

612
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:56,360
anything's possible it's like one two

613
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:57,960
three just like that and so that's what

614
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:00,960
happens is food just starts to feed

615
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:02,760
things now if the food is not good food

616
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,720
like it's food that I tell people to

617
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:09,559
avoid like eggs then it feeds something

618
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:12,000
worse feeds viruses such as like Epstein

619
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:14,600
bar shingles colitis is caused by the

620
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,360
shingles that's the shingles virus on

621
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:19,159
the inside of the lining of the the

622
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:21,360
intestinal tract causing colitis and it

623
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:22,840
feeds off of eggs it feeds off of dairy

624
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,840
products it feeds off of gluten one

625
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:26,360
thing you're going to get out of the

626
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:29,200
show is you're not going to get like oh

627
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:31,679
yeah like you know anti-inflam Foods um

628
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,320
you know autoimmune Foods yeah just stay

629
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,880
away from the gluten stay away from this

630
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:36,159
mot toxins and this and that you're

631
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,120
going to get you're going to get

632
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,520
information about what foods feeding

633
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,640
what causing what illness and what

634
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,679
disease that's what you're going to get

635
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,880
you're not going to get that anywhere

636
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:47,640
else unless they're listening to this

637
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:50,480
show and and and adopting it so the the

638
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:51,840
eggs will feed the shingles virus in the

639
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,000
intestinal tract you won't hear that

640
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,799
anybody anywhere else it'll feed the in

641
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,279
the shingles and intestinal tract cause

642
00:24:55,799 --> 00:25:01,159
an inflammation and eruption of blood

643
00:24:58,279 --> 00:25:03,159
vessels that's what's happening there so

644
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:04,720
it's it's other things that are you know

645
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:07,520
worse mean when you have when you have

646
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:10,080
viruses inside of us certain bacteria

647
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,840
inside of us never mind candida candida

648
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,240
is there to try to protect you it sits

649
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:17,840
there did you know this that without

650
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:19,600
candida we die how about that one

651
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:22,080
without having candida in our system we

652
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,880
actually die that's what happens an

653
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,360
overgrowth of candida is because it's

654
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:28,799
protecting you candida is literally

655
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:31,919
trying to absorb

656
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:34,880
absorb and eat stuff and eat food and

657
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:37,320
debris to take it away from something

658
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,679
worse in the body candida is trying to

659
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:42,000
save your life by gobbling up whatever

660
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:43,440
it can it gobble up that chocolate cake

661
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
because it does candida doesn't want

662
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,480
that chocolate cake getting to Coline

663
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,320
strepa cacus getting to you know getting

664
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:55,640
to the shingles getting to over 60 VAR

665
00:25:50,320 --> 00:26:00,039
of Zep bar hhb6 hhb1 hhv1 hhb2 I could

666
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:02,720
go on and on forever cyeg CMV and so

667
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:04,799
what happens is that candida is sitting

668
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,919
there protecting your life that's what

669
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:09,960
it does that's not even the issue so

670
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:12,440
these are such critical pieces of

671
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:15,080
information I forgot to tell you put on

672
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,600
your seat belts I forgot to tell you

673
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:20,360
guys you got to guys got to fasten your

674
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:22,960
seat belts so I'll even put mine on

675
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:25,200
okay right so we'll get the seat belts

676
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,039
on so anyway we got other things that's

677
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,520
a leaky gut confusion I'm talking about

678
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:31,200
Hydrochloric acid we we have

679
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:33,799
hydrochloric acid problems where they

680
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,480
break down the seven aets that are that

681
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:38,440
are just considered one because science

682
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:39,960
hasn't funded got the funds or or got to

683
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,640
the point of Medical Research Medical

684
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:43,600
Science to figure out the seven

685
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:45,640
different assets that are the blend in

686
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,840
there I'm going tell you one other thing

687
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:52,440
too the scien is not know we're born

688
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:54,039
with this like type of hair microscopic

689
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,919
furry hair on the inside of her

690
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:58,480
intestinal tracts and the inside of her

691
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,640
guts they're to Heart Harper good

692
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,640
bacteria like elevated biotics like

693
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,640
we're going to talk about in a little

694
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:08,360
while they're there to hold all the good

695
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:10,960
bacteria so that bad bacteria can't get

696
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:13,640
into Spate Linings and start creating

697
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:16,840
Diverticulitis and so forth and

698
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:19,679
everything but the problem is we lose

699
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:21,559
this hair really fast years ago hundreds

700
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,640
of years ago we didn't lose it fast it

701
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:26,320
stayed with us now because of

702
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:28,120
antibiotics it just burns right off of

703
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:31,360
the inside of the intestin track and

704
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:33,720
colon I mean kids are given antibiotics

705
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,720
with their first deer infection instead

706
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,919
of other things being figured out and

707
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:40,519
you know it just starts right from the

708
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:43,679
beginning lots of antibiotics it just

709
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:46,679
wipes out this intestinal tract lining

710
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:48,399
this this microscopic fur that's on the

711
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:50,000
lining of the intestinal tracts and by

712
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:51,799
the time we get into our teenager Years

713
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,399
and we're eating you know we're eating

714
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:55,799
all the fun stuff like Twinkies and

715
00:27:53,399 --> 00:27:57,399
everything else and you name it and it

716
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:59,480
just between that and antibiotics it

717
00:27:57,399 --> 00:28:01,440
just just wipes right out and now we

718
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:03,320
just basically have a bare colon and

719
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,559
bare intestinal

720
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:07,679
tract and that you know and that

721
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:09,880
information you can you can only find

722
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,360
here the problem is with that you get

723
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,720
calluses and then you got all these

724
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,600
other bacteria then you get more

725
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,679
antibiotics and then you get more

726
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:18,600
problems and you know then you're eating

727
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:20,320
poorly the liver breaks down you're

728
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,240
gaining weight all kinds of problems are

729
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,919
happening and this is what goes

730
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:27,440
wrong gastritis is

731
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:29,200
bacterial so when someone has gastritis

732
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,919
so they have a lot of gas that's not

733
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:34,960
fungus that's not yeast that's not

734
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:38,240
candida that's bacteria that's bacteria

735
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:40,039
overgrowth that's what that is um and so

736
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:44,200
that's what gastritis is so it's another

737
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:47,600
thing to understand so inflammation in

738
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:51,120
the intestinal tract inflammation like

739
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:53,399
IBS in irritable vowel syndrome okay

740
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:55,000
that's that's that's a another great one

741
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:56,640
because you know I talk about I laugh

742
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,720
about that it's like oh you got IBS well

743
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,440
what's IBS

744
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,039
you know and and so yeah we the whole

745
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,760
thing with that is inflammation is

746
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:07,799
caused by a lot of things it's caused

747
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:09,720
mostly by bacteria a breakdown of like I

748
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:12,840
said the liver the hydrochloric acid

749
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:15,000
food not breaking down okay and and it

750
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:17,360
rotting in the intestinal tract feeding

751
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,200
different types of bacteria we also pick

752
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,120
up a lot of different kinds of bacteria

753
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,679
chronically or constantly we're eating

754
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:25,120
in restaurants we get it everywhere so

755
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:29,320
we have to be careful in how we're

756
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:30,799
eating um you know a restaurant you know

757
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:33,080
I try to eat as many fresh fruits and

758
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:35,480
vegetables as I can you know that's what

759
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:37,480
I that's what I like to do because I got

760
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:40,000
spirit in my ear telling me that you

761
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:41,760
know we we we're only here so long you

762
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,039
got to get as many meals as you can in

763
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,399
you that are good and spirit's always

764
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:48,320
pushing me to do the fresh fruits fresh

765
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:51,200
vegetables that's what I'm always being

766
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:54,760
pushed to do uh but when I'm at a

767
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:58,480
restaurant you know what I do is I order

768
00:29:54,760 --> 00:30:01,039
cooked food that comes really hot like

769
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:03,279
like hot F you know fresh fruits and

770
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:06,559
vegetables that became hot like hot

771
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:08,000
vegetables that's what I order because

772
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:10,080
you know I don't want to get any

773
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,159
contamination I don't want to get

774
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:14,000
cross-contamination from you know

775
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,840
somebody at the sink in the kitchen so

776
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I'm careful because you can pick up a

777
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:20,440
whole multiple different varieties of

778
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,880
bacteria in your journey of eating out

779
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:23,559
and doing things I'm not trying to put

780
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:26,039
fear in you but make sure you're kind of

781
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:28,279
cautious make sure your food comes hot

782
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:30,480
that matters

783
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:32,360
um it matters greatly a lot of people

784
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,480
have a whole bunch of low levels of food

785
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:37,039
poisoning in their system all through

786
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,320
their life it builds up it reeks Havoc

787
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:40,320
it breaks down a lining of the

788
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,440
intestinal tract and so forth they have

789
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,840
antibiotics in and out of it all we get

790
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:46,519
a lot of gut

791
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:48,799
damage and this is what occurs creates a

792
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:50,279
lot of inflammation different pathogens

793
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:51,880
creates different inflammation we have

794
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:54,679
viruses in the intestinal tract causes

795
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:56,840
different inflammation and then then

796
00:30:54,679 --> 00:30:59,639
there's things like gin bar uh inflaming

797
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:01,760
the SP spleen and liver and then causing

798
00:30:59,639 --> 00:31:04,200
digestive trouble because your liver is

799
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:06,559
inflamed your spleen inflamed because

800
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:08,399
you have a little bit of epine bar and

801
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:11,039
so then it gets confused and we think

802
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:12,880
that's our intestinal track another

803
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:15,399
thing is there's viruses like the

804
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,799
shingles that make the nerve sensitive

805
00:31:15,399 --> 00:31:18,600
makes all the nerves in the body

806
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:20,919
sensitive so here's something here's a

807
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:22,639
nugget right here that's so important

808
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:23,960
there's people out there that think they

809
00:31:22,639 --> 00:31:26,080
can't digest

810
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:28,519
anything they think they can't digest

811
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,799
any food but that's not accurate that's

812
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:34,519
not true it's just that they're feeling

813
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:36,480
the food move through them are you one

814
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:38,519
of those people because you feel the

815
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:41,720
food moving through you because all your

816
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:43,760
nerve endings all your neurological all

817
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:45,880
the nervous central nervous system the

818
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:48,880
vagus nerve the frenic nerves they're

819
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:50,720
wired to your colon your dadum your

820
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:53,639
intestinal tract so your whole your

821
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,480
stomach all that has nerves going to it

822
00:31:53,639 --> 00:31:58,200
all these hot nerves and if you've been

823
00:31:55,480 --> 00:32:00,519
viral different varieties of Epstein bar

824
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:03,240
you've been viral with with different

825
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:06,399
varieties of shingles if you a sensitive

826
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:08,360
person from a lot of heavy metals from

827
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:10,080
um from your nervous system being

828
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:12,880
sensitive because of a lot of heavy

829
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:16,840
metals toxic heavy metals what's going

830
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:18,840
to happen is when you eat your the food

831
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,639
is going to rub the lining of your

832
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:23,600
intestinal tract and colon as

833
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:26,639
peristaltic action is happening and when

834
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:29,000
that happens you guys you're going to

835
00:32:26,639 --> 00:32:31,320
feel like oh I just I'm not digesting

836
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,039
this I don't know what I'm eating that's

837
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:35,320
you know feeling good and then what's

838
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:37,559
going to happen is you're going to stay

839
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:41,279
away from a salad you're going to stay

840
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:43,639
away from something like that that rubs

841
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,600
along the sides you're going to stay

842
00:32:43,639 --> 00:32:46,399
away from that and then you're just

843
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:49,399
going to have like oh the only thing I

844
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:51,840
can have is an egg an egg seems to work

845
00:32:49,399 --> 00:32:54,880
I don't feel any pain when I eat an egg

846
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:57,240
meanwhile the egg is feeding more

847
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:00,159
inflammation and more nerve problems and

848
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:01,440
more issues but yet it feels good going

849
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:02,559
down I had people telling me that

850
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,080
they'll be like well you know the only

851
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:05,960
thing I could eat is an egg the reason

852
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,080
why is the egg turns into a liquid like

853
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:10,320
a liquid glue that just sits in the

854
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:13,039
middle it doesn't rub the intestinal

855
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:15,159
walls or the Linings it doesn't rub the

856
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:17,360
sides so you don't feel it but if you

857
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:19,679
eat some butterleaf lettuce or you eat a

858
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:22,639
Roma piece of lettuce or you eat an

859
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:24,840
apple that pecon that that stuff is

860
00:33:22,639 --> 00:33:27,039
going to go and and start doing some

861
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:28,880
healing and it's going to rub the lining

862
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:30,880
of the intestinal tract it's going to

863
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,600
rub the lining of the stomach it's going

864
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,000
to rub everything and if you have

865
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,720
sensitive nervous system you're going to

866
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,760
be like oh I didn't digest this oh I

867
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:41,159
can't digest this that's how confusing

868
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:43,480
it is so if you're pushed into a corner

869
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:47,159
where you feel like you can only eat

870
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:48,639
like a piece of cheese and an egg or all

871
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:50,559
you can eat is just this one piece of

872
00:33:48,639 --> 00:33:52,200
chicken and you're one of those people

873
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:55,000
that I feel bad when you get pushed into

874
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:57,480
that try to try to break out of that box

875
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,279
have a little bit of avocado you know it

876
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:02,360
it will rub a little bit as it goes down

877
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:03,960
because it's got fiber in it and Pulp

878
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:06,279
but it's not going to it's not going to

879
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:08,560
you know rub all so much where it's it's

880
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:11,879
getting you upset try to do a little bit

881
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:13,520
of some you know some boiled potato and

882
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:15,159
try to get that in there you there's

883
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:17,960
different things you can do some sweet

884
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:20,159
potato some butternut squash um you can

885
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:22,520
try different things that won't be so

886
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:24,800
you know they won't rub as they go down

887
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:27,079
to try to graduate you out of that

888
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:30,639
sensitive nervous systems are a big part

889
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:32,359
of our digestive like cry out our

890
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:35,079
digestive pain and suffering that a lot

891
00:34:32,359 --> 00:34:36,960
of people have it's nerve sensitivities

892
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:39,839
it's vagus nerve sensitivities going

893
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,760
right to the intestinal tract it's

894
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:45,040
frenic nerve sensitivities going right

895
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:47,599
into the intestinal tract so much of

896
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:49,720
this is these nerve sensitive

897
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:51,679
sensitivities from being viral

898
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:54,720
neurological symptoms for being vibral

899
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:57,000
when someone someone has

900
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:58,440
fibromyalgia even they they with what

901
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,079
they don't know so if you have

902
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:03,720
fibromyalgia what you don't know if you

903
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:05,480
have a bad case of it the nerves are not

904
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:07,040
just in other parts of the joints or

905
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:09,800
other parts of your shoulders or your

906
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:12,160
arms these nerves they hurt in the

907
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:14,240
intestinal tract so when you eat you're

908
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,920
like I don't know what to eat I ate that

909
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:18,040
it doesn't feel good I had a date it

910
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,720
doesn't feel good I had this but I can

911
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:23,760
eat an egg and that feels

912
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:26,640
good so it's it's important to know and

913
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,359
fibro caused by Epstein bar of course um

914
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:31,280
my brought that to the world's attention

915
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:33,280
quite a while ago and and uh and it's

916
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:37,920
getting around so finally people are

917
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:39,760
learning um so look back to candida if

918
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,160
if you were diagnosed with candida don't

919
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:45,880
go hog while crazy trying to kill your

920
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:47,839
candida whatever you do instead take

921
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:50,000
Foods away from whatever bacteria is

922
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:52,119
causing your real inflammation that's

923
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,079
another thing too take Foods away take

924
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:55,880
the dairy take the eggs out take all the

925
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:57,480
gluten out I'm sure you've taken grains

926
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:59,720
out we're going to going to do a show

927
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:02,319
just on grains though we're going to do

928
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:04,319
a show just on grains that one will come

929
00:36:02,319 --> 00:36:06,640
up you guys got to hear that one it's

930
00:36:04,319 --> 00:36:09,240
really cool cuz I'm not against all

931
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,480
grains so um but when you're dealing

932
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:12,040
with you know intestinal INF

933
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,359
inflammation and you're worried you

934
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:16,000
think it's candida you got to bring in

935
00:36:14,359 --> 00:36:17,920
some fruit you got to bring in some

936
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,160
papaya we got to talk about all this so

937
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,000
we're going to we're going to go into a

938
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:24,400
lot of this

939
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,000
so key key things take-home things we

940
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,280
got to build up your hydrochloric acid

941
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,400
we got to get your liver stronger we got

942
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:34,240
to get your bioproduction up to par and

943
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:36,280
we got to get the right

944
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:38,560
probiotics the right probiotics I'm

945
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:40,119
going to offer later on in the show two

946
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,839
probiotic companies that I think are

947
00:36:40,119 --> 00:36:45,839
okay okay that I think are fine but what

948
00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:48,480
I really like I really like is elevated

949
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:51,000
biotics elevated biotics is a term from

950
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:53,599
Spirit um to help the world to help you

951
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,920
get better if there was a time in your

952
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:58,040
life where you actually ate a piece of

953
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,640
kale picked out of the garden it could

954
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:03,359
have been 20 years ago the bacteria on

955
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:06,040
that kale which is an elevated

956
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:07,319
microorganism is still in you today

957
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:11,560
keeping you

958
00:37:07,319 --> 00:37:13,599
alive okay it's not the microorganisms

959
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:15,520
that are in soil born microorganisms

960
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:17,119
those are weak those are weak that's

961
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:21,240
outdated

962
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:23,640
information I'm just for warning you it

963
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:25,960
look you don't want to live in the past

964
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:29,640
you don't want a car without the

965
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:31,319
headrest from 1950 so when someone Nails

you don't want a car without airbags

972
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:48,240
today driving around but that's what

973
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:50,240
it's like with this with with you know

974
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:52,079
with the information with microorganisms

975
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:56,079
right now the best newest stuff coming

976
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:59,119
out is is outdated was outdated to begin

977
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:03,079
with soil born microorganisms are not

978
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:05,599
the ones that give us what we need okay

979
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:07,000
they're helpful if they're not harmful

980
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:10,040
they're helpful because they keep the

981
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:13,079
plant healthy down below but they can't

982
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:15,680
handle the sun they can't handle the

983
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:17,680
wind they can't handle the rain they

984
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:20,480
can't handle anything they hide they

985
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:22,839
hide in the soil and they're not that

986
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:25,000
strong when we consume them if they

987
00:38:22,839 --> 00:38:27,319
happen to be on our produce and we

988
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,319
consume you know we consume a little bit

989
00:38:27,319 --> 00:38:31,720
of dirt it's not going to hurt us but it

990
00:38:29,319 --> 00:38:33,440
dies off quickly in the stomach with our

991
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:35,920
own hydrochloric acid there's a

992
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:38,480
microorganism called elevated biotic it

993
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:40,880
sits on the leaves it sits on the

994
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:43,160
raspberry you just picked it sits on the

995
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:45,240
strawberry you just picked it's loaded

996
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:47,280
on there and it handles the wind the

997
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:49,400
rain it handles the radiation falling

998
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,640
out of the sky it handles the chemicals

999
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:55,720
dropping out of the

1000
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:57,920
sky it handles you know pollution it

1001
00:38:55,720 --> 00:39:02,040
handles trucks with diesel fume spewing

1002
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:05,240
out of it driving by and it stays alive

1003
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:07,079
it sits there on a Raspberry someone

1004
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:08,640
told me hey I used to pick blackberries

1005
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:10,280
20 years ago I found them on the side of

1006
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,599
a road was that okay and I was picking

1007
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:14,680
black yeah elevated biotics are on there

1008
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:17,400
microor microorganisms that are sitting

1009
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:20,359
on that Berry they go deep down into the

1010
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:24,440
Elum they're the only bugs that go down

1011
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:26,960
into the Elum down in there and Nestle

1012
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:28,960
in there and create B12 and save our

1013
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,280
butts so when you go to the farmer

1014
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,319
market go to the organic you know

1015
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,720
Farmers Market you get some kale you

1016
00:39:32,319 --> 00:39:35,480
don't have to you just give it a gentle

1017
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:37,599
rinse if you see dirt on it you rinse

1018
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,960
off the dirt and you know the elevated

1019
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:40,480
biotics will be on there if you have a

1020
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,160
if you don't have a garden and you got a

1021
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,680
little pot and you got parsley and you

1022
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,359
stick it on the patio it'll collect

1023
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:48,760
elevated

1024
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:50,800
biotics apple apple from an orchard

1025
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:52,680
elevated biotics if you can only do it

1026
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:56,160
once a year it helps you do it twice a

1027
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:57,960
year helps more that's the probiotic

1028
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,560
that's a probiotic that keeps us alive

1029
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:02,000
that's Advanced

1030
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:03,640
information I have to I have to harp on

1031
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,720

together we grow grow move forward um so

1045
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,160
it's those elevated biotics that are

1046
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:36,400
amazing they will bottle these up down

1047
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:38,200
the road when they when they learn about

1048
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,359
them and they discover them so I don't

1049
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:44,640
know when that's going to be I don't

1050
00:40:40,359 --> 00:40:46,800
know but you can't wait those 30 years I

1051
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:49,280
can't wait okay so let's get the

1052
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:51,040
elevated biotics in us now those are the

1053
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,880
ones that stop disease those are the

1054
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,800
ones that stop cancers in our intestinal

1055
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,079
tracts those are the ones that stop scar

1056
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,280
tissue in our intestinal tract and

1057
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:59,240
that's another thing I want to talk

1058
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,319
about scar tissue is rampant in our

1059
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:04,040
intestinal tracts it's not leaky gut

1060
00:41:01,319 --> 00:41:05,800
syndrome it's Scar Tissue Scar Tissue

1061
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:09,119
caused by antibiotics burning our

1062
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:10,920
Linings Scar Tissue caused by bacteria

1063
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:13,119
Scar Tissue caused by pollutants and

1064
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:16,319
heavy metals toxic heavy metals and

1065
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:17,800
that's that's what it's about there

1066
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:20,040
that's what it's about let's talk about

1067
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:21,359
some things we can do for all this okay

1068
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:23,000
we're going to need another gut health

1069
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:25,240
show I can tell already because we're

1070
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:29,280
moving we're moving through this so

1071
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:31,200
far H foods for gut health celery juice

1072
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:33,079
just go to my Instagram you'll see

1073
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,319
people drinking celery juice you guys

1074
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:36,680
know you're probably listening that they

1075
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:38,040
in Instagram all the time you're doing

1076
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:40,079
the celery juice and you're rebuilding

1077
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:41,880
your hydrochloric acid you're rebuilding

1078
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:43,800
your gut health you're getting out of

1079
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:45,800
that whole fear of candida that

1080
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:48,520
misrepresentation of candida and

1081
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:52,880
misrepresentation of leaky gut I mean

1082
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:55,480
freedom is nice man freedom is nice and

1083
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:57,040
you know it's it's important it's

1084
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:58,839
important because when you start looking

1085
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,319
at some of that Antiquated information

1086
00:41:58,839 --> 00:42:02,640
out there and some of the antique stuff

1087
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:04,800
and you like oh my God I was there it's

1088
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:06,960
great to be here it feels good I feel

1089
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,359
the same way you guys do trust me I'm

1090
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,000
because I'm because I'm just glad I'm

1091
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:12,079
with spirit I feel the same way I'm

1092
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,079
honored and and I just I'm just great I

1093
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:16,680
meaning it feels great to have it the

1094
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:19,680
information for all of us me me included

1095
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:21,680
so celery juice 16 ounces of celery

1096
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:23,559
juice every morning once a day you can

1097
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:25,280
turn your gut problems around

1098
00:42:23,559 --> 00:42:26,680
hydrochloric acid builds up your liver

1099
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,920
starts to back down

1100
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:31,280
meaning it starts to calm down if it's

1101
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:32,760
overheated if it's inflamed it starts to

1102
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:35,319
get better if you're an acupuncturist

1103
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:36,960
and you just believe in in acupuncture

1104
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:39,119
you know I love all forms of medicine

1105
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,720
that are alternative and even

1106
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:41,880
conventional um many of them

1107
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,839
conventional but if you're an

1108
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:45,559
acupuncturist you you always find that

1109
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:48,000
liver heat in your patients I bet you

1110
00:42:45,559 --> 00:42:49,119
know what I mean so you probably see all

1111
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,040
that liver heat in them because you're

1112
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:52,760
using your intuition you're popping

1113
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:55,640
needles into them and you're like whoa

1114
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:57,359
this liver is a mess well the celery

1115
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:59,800
juice make sure your clients are on

1116
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:02,440
celery juice if it goes against a belief

1117
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:04,520
system just try to work it in somehow

1118
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:06,200
try to work it in but you'll get your

1119
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:07,559
your patients with all those liver

1120
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,079
problems better because I know

1121
00:43:07,559 --> 00:43:10,440
acupuncturist they talk to me all the

1122
00:43:09,079 --> 00:43:12,200
time about they say well you wouldn't

1123
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:16,319
believe the liver problems I see Anthony

1124
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:19,520
I go yeah use some celery juice aloe

1125
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:22,359
water aloe water that's a big deal so

1126
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:23,920
you blend aloe in a blender look for

1127
00:43:22,359 --> 00:43:25,359
different recipes I got them everywhere

1128
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:28,599
I think they're you know go to Medical

1129
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:30,839
medium.com go to my blog and you'll find

1130
00:43:28,599 --> 00:43:33,960
it it's really

1131
00:43:30,839 --> 00:43:36,640
important so aloe water Alo is an

1132
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:38,480
anti-inflammatory because it's antiviral

1133
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:41,319
antibacterial it goes into the

1134
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:44,319
intestinal lining and it only starts

1135
00:43:41,319 --> 00:43:48,680
going after that bad bacteria that sibo

1136
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:51,400
bacteria that IBS bacteria all of it so

1137
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:54,559
you want you want your Alo okay it

1138
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:58,720
lowers the bad acids acid

1139
00:43:54,559 --> 00:44:02,240
reflux is because hydrochloric acid one

1140
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:05,160
the seven blend is gone and what took

1141
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:08,160
over is acids produced by

1142
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:10,839
bacteria and viruses and that's what

1143
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:14,520
acid reflux is it's actually bacteria

1144
00:44:10,839 --> 00:44:17,880
produced I mean acids produced bad acids

1145
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:20,640
produced by bacteria and that's that's

1146
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:22,040
what it is so you want to get the celery

1147
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,200
juice in there you want to get the aloe

1148
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:26,119
water in there every day to start

1149
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:29,520
knocking down that bad bacteria you want

1150
00:44:26,119 --> 00:44:31,400
to get papaya in you papaya papaya it is

1151
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:33,800
it's a Saving Grace I've seen it save

1152
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:37,240
people's lives with colitis with Crohn

1153
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:39,760

bacteria it feeds off of that that's

1162
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:03,680
like that's like milk of the gods to the

1163
00:45:00,839 --> 00:45:05,680

that's bioidentical to us that our body

1168
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:19,240
uses to stop methylation problems to

1169
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:22,040
stop stop our methylation issues that we

00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:59,760
months and you're only going to hear it

1260
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:01,559
here I've been teaching about that for

1261
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:04,359
years that's the only one that matters

1262
00:49:01,559 --> 00:49:07,599
is that adoil methyl com combination so

1263
00:49:04,359 --> 00:49:10,799

it in the medical medium book if you

1271
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:29,640
want to know more about that that um I'm

1272
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:32,079
sure somebody's upset about that but the

1273
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:34,559
point is it's just it's not good it

1274
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:36,880
isn't uh with intestinal tracts it gets

1275
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:38,200
it's really hard on the lining so these

1276
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,240
are some of the things we're talking

1277
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:42,400
about um that are really important and

1278
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:44,040
you could do this every day lemon water

1288
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:07,640
Havoc totally does I just heard someone

1289
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:10,280
just told me the other day they've been

1290
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:12,839
listening to um this this new guy on the

1291
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:15,400
scene with um this new guy in the scene

1292
00:50:12,839 --> 00:50:17,760
with gut health and seem like it was

1293
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:19,040
Advanced information they got into it

1294
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:21,559
and then they the person was

1295
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:23,640
recommending canola oil they were saying

1296
00:50:21,559 --> 00:50:25,040
non GMO canol canola oil but they're

1297
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:27,240
recommending canola oil I couldn't

1298
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:30,960
believe my ears my ears

1299
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:33,920
exploded because canola oil feeds every

1300
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:35,880
manner of ill in the intestinal tract it

1301
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:38,119
WS Havoc it destroys children's

1302
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:41,799
intestinal tracts it feeds every type of

1303
00:50:38,119 --> 00:50:43,400

00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:54,040
just a hot mess so just stay away from
