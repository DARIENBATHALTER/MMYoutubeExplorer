The New Normal so no more guessing games

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,960
it's time to get answers welcome to the

medical medium podcast I'm Anthony

14
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,600
William we're talking about the 369

15
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,199
cleanse there's never been a more

16
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,960
important time in history to cleanse

17
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,600

00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:03,399
you've been struggling

21
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,840
you might want to think about cleansing

22
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:08,479
but not just cleansing cleansing with

23
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,799
something that has worked and has

24
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:14,439
already saved lives not just one life

25
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:16,600
but thousands of lives and let's be

26
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:19,360
clear about something this isn't a

27
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,720
 expensive program sales pitch a

28
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,799
nasty dirty pyramid scheme in health for

30
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:28,360
game to sell you a bunch of trendy

31
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,520

00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:41,280
this is the 369 cleanse you could walk

35
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:43,600
right into your local library and say

36
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,520
hey do you guys have a copy of cleanse

37
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,880
to heal that I could borrow the 369

38
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:52,280
cleanse has pulled people out of living

39
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,119
hell and back back to life from Lyme

to walk walk again and getting their

44
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:08,399
lives to where it used to be quality of

45
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,920
life and how does the 369 do this by

46
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,840
removing things out of our bodies that

47
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:17,319
should not be there toxins that thicken

48
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:20,560
our blood filled with modern day poisons

49
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:23,239
that never wash away until we do

50
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,239
something about

51
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,000
it yeah I'm in my favorite coffee shop

52
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,200
right now yeah yeah just chilling out

53
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,239
working trying to get some things done

54
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,480
God I'm looking outside right now in the

55
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:38,440
window I should take a video of this

56
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:41,159
this is crazy it's just endless streaks

57
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:45,159
in this guy like here I'll count for you

58
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:46,599
like it's crazy it's 1 two three 4 8 9

59
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:52,280
10 11

60
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:54,760
12 17 18 19 21 this there's got to be 50

61
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,720
or 60 of them up there why am I freaking

62
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:59,319
out I don't know but all I know is I see

63
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,120
them every now and then but this is like

64
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:03,120
getting out of control like why are they

65
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,959
doing this it's like planes I think it's

66
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,680
like planes yeah I'm just going to stand

67
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:09,280
by the door right here I need some fresh

68
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,239
air anyway I've been in the coffee shop

69
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,040
for a little bit let me just take a deep

70
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:17,480
breath out here it's a nice

71
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:19,519
day crisp air but I just can't get over

72
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:24,640
these Trails up there do you think that

73
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:28,760
stuff is like falling down on us I don't

74
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,360
know I remember at the beginning of Co

75
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:33,840
the streets were

76
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,159
quiet I was on the highway and there was

77
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,599
no

78
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:43,000
traffic in fact I drove two miles and

79
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:45,480
did not pass a car on the other side I

80
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,400
remember hearing and seeing information

81
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:54,079
out there streets were dead dead empty

82
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,640
streets in cities were dead empty people

83
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:57,720
were leaving their

84
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:00,360
houses they were trying to get to a

85
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,920
store then quickly back home

86
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,480
and not too many people were traveling

87
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:09,000
air traffic was minimal for commercial

88
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:11,959
flights but guess what there were

89
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,200
thousands of planes in the sky thousands

90
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:18,079
all around the planet millions of planes

91
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:21,199
in the sky you can look up in the sky

92
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,840
and you can see 10 20 planes but guess

93
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,720
what there weren't passengers on those

94
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:27,320
planes they were chemtrail

95
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,240
planes here the world seemed like it was

96
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:32,680
ending down on the street

97
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,720
it was ending in people's homes people

98
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,800
were in fear they were scared no one was

99
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,240
leaving their

100
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:43,080
houses and up in the sky they were

101
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,560
flying planes every single day every

102
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,240
minute you can look up and you'll see

103
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,080
them and the streaks were there the

104
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,639
Chemtrails were there it was like

105
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:54,960
nothing was stopping as far as

106
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:57,720
evildoers nothing was stopping as far as

107
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:01,360
the satanic cult behind the chemtrail

108
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:04,479
movement evil was up high in the sky

109
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,560
that's right evil was in the plains

110
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:09,120
that's right chemicals being dumped on

111
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:13,080
everybody day in and day out all night

112
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:15,120
long all day long it wasn't halting you

113
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:17,680
would think it would be nothing was

114
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,600
happening everything was basically at a

115
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,479
standstill the Chemtrails kept on coming

116
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:26,680
and coming and coming heavier than ever

117
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:29,759
before Darkness was above us dropping

118
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:33,160
stuff on us and darkness was around us

119
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:35,680
spreading stuff on us the manufacturing

120
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:39,240
of the viruses the lab

121
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,199
viruses the manufacturing engineering of

122
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,120
viruses something that's been happening

123
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,759
for over a hundred years classified

124
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,800
medical research and Science Why do you

125
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,319
think everybody's just sick out there

126
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,600
they're filled with viruses of all kinds

127
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:54,160
but during this time way up in the sky

128
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,960
they were assaulting

129
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,720
us who hired those millions of Pilots to

130
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,440
drop all that chem on us nobody know

131
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:04,400
knows interesting but they were

132
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,840
assaulting us up there while assaulting

133
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,360
us down here with engineered viruses

134
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:12,400
like Co and maybe you remember this

135
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:16,120
maybe you don't but right before Co

136
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:19,520
there was an engineered flu a flu virus

137
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:21,280
that ripped across the cities ripped

138
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,160
across the United States around the

139
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:27,120
world it injured a lot of people and a

140
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:30,080
lot of people died from it it was a bad

141
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:33,080
bad bad flu that was engineering

142
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,720
that was released even before Co only a

143
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:38,599
couple of months before Co so why am I

144
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:40,880
talking about this all of it project

145
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:44,120
Chemtrails started in the

146
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:46,560
1960s and it's still here today and

147
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,759
these Chemtrails are composed of every

148
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,840
toxin possible that the chemical

149
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:55,400
industry creates this includes toxic

150
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:58,120
heavy metals Mercury copper it's also

151
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:00,240
including outdated Antiquated chemical

152
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:03,560
storage bins that have been backlogged

153
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:07,840
in storage for decades chemical waste

154
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:11,039
that has sat in tanks for 50 60 70 or 80

155
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:14,199
in even 100 years it's a combination of

156
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:17,319
chemicals both old and new being placed

157
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:19,039
in planes and dumped out of the sky when

158
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:21,240
the Los Angeles fires were at their

159
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:23,240
height days ago because they're still

160
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,599
burning now when they were at their

161
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:28,000
height Chemtrails were being dropped

162
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:30,560
everywhere chemtrail planes were flying

163
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
above dropping chemtrails over Los

164
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:36,680
Angeles as the fires were raging the

165
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,560
people behind the Chemtrails are above

166
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:42,319
even the most powerful public figures

167
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:44,840
and above the people who seem to run

168
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:47,599
every country in the world the chemtrail

169
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:50,120
hierarchy are not on the Forbes list

170
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:52,280
it's the secret society of Doom they're

171
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,560
behind engineering the viruses that

172
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,639
spread around the world which there are

173
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,720
more to come and they're going to be

174
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,919
worse than the ones before and they're

175
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,400
also behind all the chemicals falling

176
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:06,120
out of the sky out of the Plains onto

177
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:09,360
everyone if someone was just to say give

178
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:12,479
me one good reason to cleanse I just

179
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:15,800
gave you two pathogens love toxins

180
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:17,639
pathogens eat and feed off of toxins the

181
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,120
more toxins and the chemicals and

182
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:22,319
everything else that we have inside of

183
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:25,560
our body the more these bugs that stay

184
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:28,840
dormant inside of us can wake up and

185
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:30,039
feed and grow into something and turn

186
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,680
into sick

187
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:35,000
turn our bodies into sickness we keep

188
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:37,880
the toxins away from the pathogens that

189
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,360
are inside of us and we Empower

190
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:43,000
ourselves if someone's battling

191
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:45,560
autoimmune they're battling toxins and

192
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,120
pathogens pathogens feeding off of

193
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,839
toxins or they're battling a small

194
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,440
amount of pathogens and a large amount

195
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:55,000
of toxins the more toxins inside our

196
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:58,279
body the more chances we can catch

197
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,120
something the second the minute a bug

198
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:02,640
enters us through exposure of some kind

199
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,600
whether it's on the handle of a shopping

200
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,480
cart Carriage whether it's in a bathroom

201
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,079
a public bathroom on a toilet seat in

202
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,920
the toilet water or by the sink whether

203
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:13,839
it's somebody that you had a sexual

204
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,240
encounter with whether it's bodily

205
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,640
fluids on a glass that you drank out of

206
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,800
that were somebody else's in any way

207
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:24,800
shape or form when we get a new bug it's

208
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:27,839
damage and danger to us depends on how

209
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:30,720
toxic we are that means if we have what

210
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:33,640
the bug needs so it can proliferate so

211
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,959
it can actually expand so it can grow so

212
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:39,440
it can multiply it needs toxins to do so

213
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:41,279
it needs fuel and the more toxins we

214
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,399
have inside of our body the more

215
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:47,320
aggressive the pathogen can get and what

216
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,279
about our immune system immune systems

217
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,760
struggle when there's a lot of toxins in

218
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:54,640
the body the more toxins we have in our

219
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:57,040
body our brain our liver or spleen our

220
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,480
pancreas or intestinal tract the more

221
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,399
toxins we have inside of our tissue or

222
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:05,000
cells or organs the more our immune

223
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:08,360
system struggles and weakens because our

224
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,200
immune system goes up against the toxins

225
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:15,440
our immune system tries to gobble up the

226
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:19,440
toxins our immune cells actually go up

227
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:22,560
against the toxin consume it try to rid

228
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,519
it try to stop it because it's a free

229
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,120
radical it shouldn't be in the body and

230
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:29,600
our immune systems know this but when

231
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,760
our immune systems are busy trying to go

232
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:35,240
after metals and all kinds of other

233
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:40,519
toxins our immune system cells burst

234
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:42,320
they weaken they get dried out they die

235
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:44,399
and with the more exposure we get with

236
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,600
the toxins and the toxins building up in

237
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,120
every single cell in our body our immune

238
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,560
system start to weaken pathogens take

239
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,760
advantage of this they feed off the

240
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:56,560
toxins not only feed off the toxins but

241
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,760
they don't have an immune system to

242
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:01,399
really battle against so they grow

243
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:04,600
rapidly and then everything is

244
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:07,519
fast-tracked every Cancer every disease

245
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:10,040
every illness mach five cancers are

246
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:13,600
prime example of pathogens feeding off

247
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:17,200
of toxins and then creating cancer

248
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:20,120
pathogens feeding off of toxins toxins

249
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,880
feeding the pathogens viral cells

250
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:25,040
becoming cancer cells so there's never

251
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,959
been a more important time for getting

252
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:32,160
rid of toxins and if we don't our bodies

253
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:36,440
become the bath tub they become that old

254
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:39,240
moldy rotten stinky bathtub and tiles

255
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:42,320
filled with mold our blood gets thick

256
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:44,639
our liver gets toxic stagnant it gets

257
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,320
overworked overburdened it's not

258
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,440
functioning like it should our

259
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,720
intestinal tract gets all kinds of

260
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,920
different buildup Linings of the

261
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,240
intestinal tract and colon start to

262
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:57,920
Harbor things that shouldn't be there

263
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:00,160
it's not just toxins but it's a buildup

264
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,440
of sludge and toxin

265
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,720
along with different pathogens that

266
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:07,720
start to make a home there our brains

267
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,880
get dirty our brain cells die our brain

268
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:13,279
tissue oxidizes we don't have enough

269
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:16,000
antioxidants we don't have enough

270
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:18,720
detoxifiers we don't cleanse enough and

271
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,320
the buildup grows and it grows our

272
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,639
brains start to hold things that it

273
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:27,279
should never hold and what's making us

274
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:29,519
so toxic viruses and viral waste matter

275
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:32,279
Pharmaceuticals toxic heavy metals

276
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,839

284
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:57,040
the surface and everyone is reaching

285
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:59,760
their brain saturation limitation when

286
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:02,639
exposure is small tiny

287
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:05,040
an occasional here and there you may not

288
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:07,560
react or experience symptoms if you are

289
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,839
not a sensitive someone may be on a

290
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:12,880
pharmaceutical for a month or a

291
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:15,040
pharmaceutical for 10 years someone may

292
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,519
be exposed to fumes for a few minutes at

293
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:20,440
a gasoline pump or they have some

294
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:22,440
gasoline spilled on their skin someone

295
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:25,160
can be breathing in the fumes and get

296
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:27,240
affected someone may not in the moment

297
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:29,680
everybody has different exposures and

298
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:32,560
symptoms to the exposures but all of

299
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:35,320
this can penetrate the brain the brain

300
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,760
has its saturation limits and people on

301
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:40,800
this planet are experiencing that right

302
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:43,320
now when we get exposed to toxins when

303
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:46,240
toxins actually enter us they are

304
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:48,440
usually attached to Metals this is how

305
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,759
we get Mercury toxic copper aluminum

306
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:55,839
lead cadmium barium nickel arsenic toxic

307
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:59,800
calcium toxic chromium strontium uranium

308
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:03,240
toxic iron toxic Platinum titanium tin

309
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:05,600
inside of us we get these in us because

310
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,120
they're attached to other toxins what a

311
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,600
lot of people experience out there in

312
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:13,040
the cleanse world the detox world is

313
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:15,440
surface detoxing surface detoxing is

314
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:18,040
getting rid of some of the Overflow some

315
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,480
of the daily overflow their livers are

316
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:22,600
clogged up their brains are clogged up

317
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,440
their organs are clogged up but they're

318
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:28,519
getting some of the lymphatic cloggage

319
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:31,440
out but that just gets refilled so what

320
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:35,320
happens is surface detoxing is different

321
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:37,240
than deep cleansing deep detoxing

322
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,959
surface detoxing won't be enough for

323
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,440
somebody who's truly suffering with a

324
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:45,279
chronic illness someone who has a high

325
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:47,920
pathogen load a high toxic load lowgrade

326
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:50,720
viral infections high-grade viral

327
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:53,160
infections surface detoxing can be

328
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,240
helpful but not enough and it might not

329
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:57,680
even be the right kind of surface

330
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:00,839
detoxing cleanses can't just be

331
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:03,440
cleansing they have to be nourishing but

332
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:05,680
not just the word nourishing it can't be

333
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,759
just like this cleanse is nourishing it

334
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:11,199
brings nutrients it has to be even more

335
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:13,839
than that it has to be wired wired to

336
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:16,600
repair a damaged sensitive nervous

337
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:19,920
system toxins not only have to be

338
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:22,160
excavated but tissue has to be repaired

339
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,880
we have to bring the person back a

340
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:27,480
cleanse needs to do that it has to be

341
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,759
set so the person has every chance of

342
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:32,000
fighting an illness every chance of

343
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:34,519
recovery and what happens out there is

344
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,240
cleanses aren't Geared for that it's all

345
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:40,120
biohacks hit or miss and then the

346
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:42,680
person's body doesn't truly go all the

347
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:44,720
way with the healing process because

348
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:48,079
first of all the cleanses and detoxes

349
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,720
out there weren't built upon the

350
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:52,279
understanding of why the person was

351
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:55,519
really sick to begin with it wasn't

352
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:58,120
built on the realization or the knowing

353
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:00,360
about pathogens what kind of pathogens

354
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,839
which ones which varieties what are they

355
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:05,160
feeding on how sick people can really

356
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:07,240
get from that and the process of what

357
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:09,120
metals and other toxins do is they sit

358
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,319
inside brain tissue and other organs in

359
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,319
the body and what about the immune

360
00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:17,120
system cleanses aren't built to repair

361
00:16:14,319 --> 00:16:19,000
the immune system they're also not built

362
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,920
to understand how the immune system

363
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,440
works in regards to what you're even

364
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:26,720
cleansing or how we got sick to begin

365
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:29,279
with a cleanse has to understand all of

366
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,880
this what that means is that when the

367
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:34,279
cleanse enters the body whatever that

368
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:36,319
cleanse is there has to be an

369
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:39,560
understanding of exactly what the body

370
00:16:36,319 --> 00:16:43,199
needs what is the person fighting what

371
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:46,279
are they struggling from what toxins how

372
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:49,319
do these toxins get out of tissue how do

373
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:51,600
the adrenal stay protected how does the

374
00:16:49,319 --> 00:16:55,079
liver function while it's under a

375
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:57,240
cleanse all of this matters and that

376
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:59,680
makes the difference to someone healing

377
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:02,279
and someone not to someone actually

378
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,799
getting their lives back and someone not

379
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:08,880
and someone rising out of the ashes

380
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:11,520
recovering and someone not 369 cleanse

381
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:15,720
cleanses the body while protecting the

382
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:18,760
brain from atrophy unlike water fasting

383
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:21,600
a long water fast atrophies the brain

384
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:24,919
you lose critical nutrients in the brain

385
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:27,760
critical minerals glycogen storage Old

386
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:29,960
glucose storage disappears and it's hard

387
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,280
to get any of that back back getting

388
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:35,400
nutrients back into the brain takes

389
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:38,960
years it's not easy to do especially if

390
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:43,000
you're not 10 years old 12 years old or

391
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:46,000
a baby or 20 years old but you're 40 or

392
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,200
50 if you're 40 and 50 years old and you

393
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,880
lose all these nutrients all that

394
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,760
glycogen storage all the trace minerals

395
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,000
all the neurotransmitter chemicals out

396
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,960
of the brain because of a very long

397
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,760
water fast thinking you're cleansing the

398
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:03,080
body we get in big trouble we have to

399
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:05,080
protect the brain while cleansing that's

400
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:07,679
the biggest and most important thing to

401
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:10,159
do making sure you're feeding the brain

402
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:12,559
lots of glucose lots of trace minerals

403
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:14,120
and that's what the 369 cleanse does

404
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:16,360
another thing that goes terribly wrong

405
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:18,760
with cleanses out there is feeding

406
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:21,880
pathogens take the milk cleanse for an

407
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:24,039
example the dairy cleanse what happens

408
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:25,640
is that pathogens feed off of dairy

409
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:27,640
doesn't matter if the dairy's raw

410
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,559
doesn't matter what kind of dairy

411
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:35,159
pathogens viruses Epstein bar the

412
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:38,159
shingles hhv6 hh7 the simplexes all feed

413
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:41,320
on Dairy so the person thinks they're

414
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:43,600
cleansing but they're growing pathogens

415
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:46,360
they may not feel the growth of those

416
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:51,200
pathogens during the cleanse six months

417
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:53,960
later a year later boom Wham whack

418
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,360
they're sick a new development a new

419
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:59,280
problem because the pathogens got

420
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:01,240
ignited they strengthened and overt time

421
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,880
they grew and that's what happens with

422
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:07,080
the dairy cleanses another fat-based

423
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:10,320
cleanse is olive oil the difference is

424
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:13,679
olive oil won't feed a pathogen so

425
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:17,480
Epstein bar won't feed off of olive oil

426
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:20,559
hhv6 won't feed off of olive oil strep

427
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:23,720
won't feed off olive oil directly not at

428
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:27,000
all but what the fat cleanses do like

429
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:29,679
olive oil and overt fat is shuts down

430
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:33,000
the liver it doesn't cleanse the liver

431
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:37,120
it shuts it down throws it into

432
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,480
dorcy it hurts the liver it also hurts

433
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,480
the brain because you lose glucose to

434
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:44,000
the brain instead you're getting fat to

435
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:46,200
the brain something people don't realize

436
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,520
is not the answer our brains run on

437
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:51,480
sugar reduce the sugar going to the

438
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:54,159
brain someone dies that's the whole

439
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,200
point so we don't want more fat and just

440
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:59,000
that in the bloodstream heading to the

441
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:01,840
brain cleanses that are based on olive

442
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,760
oil drinking a larger quantity of olive

443
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:07,600
oil also shock the gallbladder they

444
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:10,720
shock the gallbladder into potentially

445
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,880
spitting out a big gall stone now that

446
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,960
sounds like a great idea oh clean my

447
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:18,880
gallbladder maybe I can get a gall stone

448
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:21,799
out but people usually get a gall stone

449
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,960
stuck in the duct and now they're in the

450
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:27,360
hospital getting emergency gallbladder

451
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:28,679
surgery over drinking a few tablespoons

452
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,960
of olive oil every single morning

453
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:32,840
morning on its own now this doesn't mean

454
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,640
the gallbladder is cleansing not

455
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:37,679
necessarily at all instead the liver and

456
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:40,480
the gallbladder go into spasm because of

457
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:43,799
a crisis what happens when you send that

458
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,880
much overt fat and oil down the chot we

459
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:48,880
go into crisis that crisis doesn't

460
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:51,600
release toxins instead that crisis

461
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,200
causes a spasm your liver goes into

462
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:57,159
spasm your gallbladder goes into spasm

463
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:59,320
because it's shutting down it does that

464
00:20:57,159 --> 00:21:02,080
because it's going into shock

465
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:04,400
that shock might Propel one gall stone

466
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:06,159
into a duct but it doesn't mean

467
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:09,120
anything's cleansing or moving you

468
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:11,720
forward many fat-based cleanses atrophy

469
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:14,400
the brain as well like a bone broth

470
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:16,279
cleanse just drinking bone broth every

471
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,760
now and then you see somebody out there

472
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:20,799
they're saying I did a bone broth

473
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:23,240
cleanse I lost this much on my waistline

474
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:26,320
and I feel better and I have more energy

475
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:28,640
but that energy eventually Fades and

476
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:31,279
over time they feel tired and have

477
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,799
fatigue years later and even months

478
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:36,840
later don't know why what happened was

479
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:39,880
their adrenals got tanked it was a no

480
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:43,200
glucose diet a no glucose diet foods

481
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:45,799
that are lacking sugars healthy sugars

482
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,880
did not allow the adrenals to get a rest

483
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:51,320
to get a break so adrenaline was used

484
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,400
during the entire cleanse so someone was

485
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:56,760
doing the bone broth cleanse they were

486
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:59,799
on bone broth as a fuel and then

487
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:02,720
adrenaline as a fuel adrenaline had to

488
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:05,400
Surge through the body constantly day

489
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:08,240
after day week after week it eventually

490
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:11,240
tanked the adrenals bone broth is not

491
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:14,000
only dehydrating and not hydrating at

492
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:16,440
all for cells but it's also filled with

493
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,760
adrenaline as well because when that cow

494
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:21,240
was being killed the adrenals exploded

495
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,960
they filled the bloodstream with

496
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:26,279
adrenaline to try to save the cow's life

497
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:28,679
during its death so your bloodstream

498
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:31,240
fills up with adrenaline hurting your

499
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:34,240
own adrenals also stimulating your own

500
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:37,320
adrenals to release even more adrenaline

501
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:39,799
basically you're doing a bone broth diet

502
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:42,360
a bone broth cleanse and you're killing

503
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:44,640
and destroying your adrenal glands many

504
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,400
women who do the bone broth and only the

505
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,279
bone broth and they do a cleanse out of

506
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,960
it pay the price dearly years later and

507
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:53,880
now are struggling with other problems

508
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,600
like chronic fatigue and adrenal fatigue

509
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:57,360
and skin problems where their skin

510
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,679
starts to wrinkle quicker and they get

511
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:03,720
the crept skin much earlier in life

512
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:05,600
years earlier decades earlier these are

513
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:08,240
just a few of the cleanses that don't

514
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,960
farewell for the body it isn't even just

515
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,120
some of the diets out there and diet

516
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:14,279
belief systems that don't farewell

517
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:18,400
either for the body cause a lot of

518
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:21,200
problems a cleanse needs to gently feed

519
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:24,799
the liver gently cleanse the liver while

520
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:27,559
letting it function you can't shut down

521
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:29,480
organs while trying to cleanse and

522
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:31,720
that's what often happens happens you

523
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:34,480
want organs like the liver to stay

524
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:37,000
functioning at its best you want it to

525
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,480
improve instead of weaken during a

526
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,799
cleanse you want the liver to come back

527
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:47,279
to life to get reignited to start to

528
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:49,919
awaken not go to sleep shock cleanses

529
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:53,960
cause the livers in people to actually

530
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:57,080
go dormant to go into shock to start to

531
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:59,919
dumb down you want the liver to start to

532
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:02,880
ignite to start to to awaken to be

533
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:05,640
fueled to know it's safe to cleanse and

534
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:08,760
that's what 369 does you also want the

535
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:10,840
liver to cleanse In Waves you want it to

536
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:13,720
cleanse a little bit and a little bit at

537
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:16,480
a time and let it go deeper and deeper

538
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:19,440
and deeper into the liver until the

539
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:22,200
liver is fully cleansed and even then

540
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:26,080
there needs to be repair cell repair the

541
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:28,720
369 cleanse creates cell repair it

542
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:31,720
offers the liver cells an ability to

543
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:34,760
regenerate so the liver cells can

544
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:37,679
replace themselves faster new tissue

545
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:39,600
grow healthy tissue so it's not just

546
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:41,840
getting rid of toxins it's about

547
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:45,360
allowing the liver to get what it needs

548
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:47,919
to restore and rebirth you need a liver

549
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:50,039
rebirthing with other cleanses out there

550
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:52,080
when the liver does release something it

551
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:54,960
ends up back into the liver and you

552
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:57,080
don't want that you don't want the liver

553
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,399
getting recycled poisons that it

554
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:02,159
released and now it's bringing them back

555
00:24:59,399 --> 00:25:04,399
into the liver you don't want a spill a

556
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:06,559
spill over and that's what happens when

557
00:25:04,399 --> 00:25:09,520
people are doing biohacks they're trying

558
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:11,840
to shake things up all that creates is a

559
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,799
spillover it doesn't create an actual

560
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,120
cleanse because they're eating other

561
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:19,240
things and doing other things in those

562
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:21,240
biohacks or with those biohacks included

563
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:24,480
that stop the body from releasing any

564
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:27,159
toxins it's just a mixed bag of nuts

565
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,080
it's a guessing game so now the person

566
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:32,240
is shaking up some stuff inside their

567
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:34,360
body and it's got nowhere to go it goes

568
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,520
back into the liver and the Brain

569
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:39,120
there's no way to cleanse it out so if

570
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:42,039
they do something to shock the liver or

571
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:44,279
shock their system all those toxins just

572
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:46,320
get trapped floating around the body and

573
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:49,200
they think they're now having some kind

574
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:52,399
of die off or some kind of cleanse or

575
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:54,360
toxin reaction or detox reaction when in

576
00:25:52,399 --> 00:25:57,000
reality it's just stuff being shook

577
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:59,039
around by some biohacks and going right

578
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,240
back into the liver and other organs

579
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:03,520
including the brain If you hear about

580
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:07,080
cleanses out there that are detoxing the

581
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:09,919
kidneys just know this that's utterly

582
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:12,279
ridiculous you can't detox the kidneys

583
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:14,840
unless the body's detoxed you can't

584
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:17,960
detox the kidneys unless your liver is

585
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:20,399
Thoroughly detoxed properly you can't

586
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:23,080
detox the kidneys unless your spleen

587
00:26:20,399 --> 00:26:25,919
your pancreas your brain is detoxed

588
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:28,760
cleansed properly your kidneys can't

589
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:31,039
start cleansing first it's not possible

590
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:33,399
wherever your kidneys are whatever stage

591
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:35,720
they're in they stay in that stage while

592
00:26:33,399 --> 00:26:38,080
you're cleansing now you can strengthen

593
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:40,600
kidneys you can make them stronger you

594
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:43,360
can make them healthier you can fortify

595
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:45,559
them you can feed them nutrients while

596
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:48,960
you're cleansing and that's what the 369

597
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:51,360
does it strengthens kidneys you can do

598
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,679
things to help support kidneys and

599
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:56,880
support where they're at but you can't

600
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:59,880
per se cleanse the kidney itself the

601
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:02,399
tissue itself unless everything else is

602
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:05,080
cleansed but you can strengthen kidney

603
00:27:02,399 --> 00:27:07,480
tissue you can make it stronger you can

604
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:11,000
make it healthier you can make it more

605
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:13,480
vital while you're cleansing the 369 is

606
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,399
not a cleanse where you stop eating

607
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:18,080
where you're not eating anymore or

608
00:27:15,399 --> 00:27:20,760
getting any calories those kinds of

609
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:25,360
cleanses aren't good they hurt the

610
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:27,720
adrenals the 369 is designed it's geared

611
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,600
to protecting the adrenals and all

612
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:31,960
medical ium cleanses are geared to

613
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,840
protecting the adrenals other cleanses

614
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:36,159
out there are not geared to protect the

615
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:38,200
adrenals because first of all they don't

616
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:40,720
know how the adrenals really truly work

617
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:43,200
when it comes down to eating and foods

618
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,399
and health if you do intermittent

619
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,760
fasting you're hurting your adrenals

620
00:27:45,399 --> 00:27:49,480
even if you're getting benefits even if

621
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,519
you're starting to get improvements

622
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:54,399
you're losing weight you're feeling more

623
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:56,480
energy what happens is yes you're

624
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:58,720
actually giving your liver a Break by

625
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:02,039
not eating all these fats in the morning

626
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:04,640
by not having sausages and bacon and ham

627
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:07,000
and hash browns with oil in it and eggs

628
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:09,120
and butter in the morning instead you're

629
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,640
not eating at all you're intermittent

630
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:14,519
fasting you're just living off of coffee

631
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:16,799
coffee drinks caffeine you're waiting to

632
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:18,559
eat at the end of the day but Meanwhile

633
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:21,559
your adrenals suffered and you don't

634
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:24,640
know it they suffered all day long there

635
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:27,200
wasn't a balance of nutrients glucose

636
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:29,200
trace minerals they weren't there

637
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,600
instead it was coffee coffee it was

638
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,600
going without you might have drank water

639
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,600
or you might be consuming something else

640
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,559
but you're starving yourself all morning

641
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:40,440
and all afternoon your intermittent

642
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:42,799
fasting this damages the adrenals over

643
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:44,559
time and cleanses like intermittent

644
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:47,440
fasting which a lot of people consider

645
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:49,519
are a type of cleanse do not protect the

646
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,880
adrenals there's never been a more

647
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:54,360
important time to cleanse on this planet

648
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:57,200
this planet has grown toxic and it's

649
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:58,679
getting more toxic and are we truly

650
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:02,840
adapting

651
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:05,799
mock five cancers mock five diseases and

652
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:09,039
illnesses brain problems Alzheimer's

653
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:11,919
dementia are growing rapidly are we

654
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:13,799
really getting less toxic no we're not

655
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:16,360
we're getting more toxic and it's only

656
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:18,240
getting worse and I get it there's a lot

657
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,600
of ads out there there's a lot of bioh

658
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,760
hacks out there there's a lot of

659
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:24,840
programs everybody thinks they have the

660
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:26,720
answer influencers are experimenting

661
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,360
they're experimenting on themselves

662
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,880
they're taking a crowd of people with

663
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:32,480
them they're experimenting 3 months

664
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,480
later they change they're doing

665
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,880
something different and then they grab a

666
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:39,399
couple of things that originate from

667
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:42,320
medical medium like metals and fluoride

668
00:29:39,399 --> 00:29:44,480
and Plastics and microplastics and at

669
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:46,440
the same time they're screaming that

670
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,200
they're also screaming about processed

671
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:51,519
foods and food chemicals but what it all

672
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,320
boils down to it they don't know why

673
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:55,200
they're sick they don't know what's

674
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:57,799
really causing their sicknesses they

675
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,799
can't see it and maybe not even believe

676
00:29:57,799 --> 00:30:01,919
it and then they're looking at what's on

677
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:03,880
their plate and that's what it boils

678
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:05,440
down to they're staring at their plate

679
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,519
and they're thinking okay I got to

680
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,320
change my game I got to start doing

681
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:12,840
maybe carnivore or I got to get off a

682
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:15,640
vegan or I got to watch out for seed

683
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:17,320
oils or I got to do something else and

684
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:19,360
they look at their plate and they get

685
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:21,360
confused and then they switch gears

686
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,440
again and then they add some Pearl

687
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,760
powder to it and some collagen they try

688
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:28,000
to Market it up and some colostrum they

689
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,399
try to sell something at the same time

690
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,360
they're changing everything with their

691
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:32,880
diet they don't know where they're going

692
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,519
they're getting sick all the time they

693
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,640
got all their healers and doctors and

694
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:38,559
practitioners they're telling them this

695
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:41,600

696
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:46,080
