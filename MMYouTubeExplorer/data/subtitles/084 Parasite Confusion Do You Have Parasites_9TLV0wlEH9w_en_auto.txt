[1.28 - 7.72] how many people do you know who struggle
[4.32 - 10.24] with their health chances are whether
[7.72 - 14.48] they show it or not most of the people
[10.24 - 17.56] in your life do and chances are you're
[14.48 - 21.40] one of them whether you're dealing with
[17.56 - 25.88] anxiety depression endometriosis acne
[21.40 - 28.44] eczema autoimmune thyroid lime brain fog
[25.88 - 31.20] fatigue or any other symptom or
[28.44 - 34.52] condition you're far from from
[31.20 - 38.64] alone living with symptoms has become
[34.52 - 41.72] The New Normal so no more guessing games
[38.64 - 44.56] it's time to get answers welcome to the
[41.72 - 47.72] medical medium podcast I'm Anthony
[44.56 - 50.84] Williams we're talking about parasites
[47.72 - 53.52] that's right parasites but really we're
[50.84 - 55.00] talking about the parasitical scam now
[53.52 - 57.04] if you're somebody that believes in
[55.00 - 60.52] parasites there's nothing wrong with
[57.04 - 61.76] that because parasites are real
[60.52 - 65.08] yes they are
[61.76 - 68.28] indeed in fact a piece of meat sitting
[65.08 - 70.76] out in the sun during a picnic will
[68.28 - 73.16] collect a lot of different microbes a
[70.76 - 76.16] lot of different food born
[73.16 - 78.40] illnesses just like egg salad can't
[76.16 - 80.60] leave egg salad in the sun either
[78.40 - 83.72] because something will happen the
[80.60 - 86.56] mayonnaise the Mayo those eggs sitting
[83.72 - 89.96] out there something bad will happen to
[86.56 - 93.20] them you can get really sick very sick
[89.96 - 97.32] sick very ill you can't eat uncooked
[93.20 - 101.28] chicken uncooked turkey why because you
[97.32 - 105.12] can die yes you can die and they can't
[101.28 - 108.08] just eat raw meat because there could be
[105.12 - 111.24] a parasite on there without a doubt that
[108.08 - 114.72] parasite can really hurt you there also
[111.24 - 117.60] could be some bad bacteria there too yes
[114.72 - 121.28] parasites are real but so is the
[117.60 - 121.28] parasite scam
[121.64 - 126.64] if you're someone that's been told you
[123.68 - 128.24] have parasites or you have a parasite
[126.64 - 130.08] and now you're going to be dedicating
[128.24 - 132.84] all your time and energy doing
[130.08 - 135.36] parasitical cleanses chasing parasites
[132.84 - 138.28] looking at parasite info out there and
[135.36 - 141.00] making your whole life about a parasite
[138.28 - 143.28] you might want to listen to this episode
[141.00 - 146.32] to start with the parasite biohack
[143.28 - 149.00] movement has been around it was around
[146.32 - 150.96] years ago and many of the earlier
[149.00 - 154.48] chronically old people people with
[150.96 - 157.08] mysterious chronic illness got into the
[154.48 - 159.72] parasite movement they were looking for
[157.08 - 161.56] answers and they tried everything and so
[159.72 - 164.68] hearing that parasites could be their
[161.56 - 167.84] problem lured them in it was the next
[164.68 - 170.36] flashy thing the next shiny object they
[167.84 - 174.00] went into it thinking whoa I'm going to
[170.36 - 177.52] be fixed I'm going to be cured but it
[174.00 - 181.48] didn't work people didn't get cured they
[177.52 - 183.24] didn't get fixed in fact they got sicker
[181.48 - 185.20] they were doing all kinds of intestinal
[183.24 - 188.16] cleansers intestinal cleansers that are
[185.20 - 190.72] out there now bentonite clay different
[188.16 - 192.44] Clays thinking they were ridding
[190.72 - 195.28] parasites they were trying to get
[192.44 - 198.64] parasites out of their intestinal tract
[195.28 - 202.32] they were using wormwood shillig fulvic
[198.64 - 205.24] minerals fulvic acid sodium bicarbonate
[202.32 - 207.64] and chlorine dioxide simultaneously as
[205.24 - 210.16] all this was happening during this time
[207.64 - 212.68] the Lyme disease movement was shifting
[210.16 - 216.88] no longer was it just bacteria it was
[212.68 - 219.20] hybrids now hybrids such as babesia
[216.88 - 221.56] babesia wasn't considered a bacteria it
[219.20 - 225.08] was considered a parasite although that
[221.56 - 228.44] is a debate still worth having to begin
[225.08 - 231.20] with they never found babesia they never
[228.44 - 234.08] found barnella and they never found
[231.20 - 236.68] bellia but yet these were the bacteria
[234.08 - 239.24] and parasitical hybrids that were being
[236.68 - 241.52] touted at the time so as the Lyme
[239.24 - 243.32] disease moved M was growing into that
[241.52 - 245.56] there was the parasitical movement on
[243.32 - 247.84] the other end of the spectrum they were
[245.56 - 250.04] working off of each other but still all
[247.84 - 253.76] in the wrong direction when someone had
[250.04 - 255.96] a blood test looking for lime bacteria
[253.76 - 258.40] the lime bacteria was never found
[255.96 - 260.92] instead it was an inflammatory marker
[258.40 - 263.24] test but nobody knew that at that time
[260.92 - 266.32] they still don't know it today medical
[263.24 - 268.44] medium information exposed it so Lyme
[266.32 - 271.76] disease took a turn and it went for
[268.44 - 274.96] co-actors it was was all about co-actors
[271.76 - 277.48] co-actor parasites like hybrids like
[274.96 - 279.96] babesia so both the health movement at
[277.48 - 282.72] the time a small batch of people were
[279.96 - 284.20] focused on parasites while at the same
[282.72 - 287.48] time a small batch of doctors were
[284.20 - 290.96] focused on parasites with Lyme disease
[287.48 - 292.64] aesia and it never got anybody anywhere
[290.96 - 294.68] the people with thyroid disease and
[292.64 - 296.56] chronic illness and vertigo and
[294.68 - 299.00] dizziness and aches and pains and
[296.56 - 301.00] Tremors and Shakes and ticks and spasms
[299.00 - 303.84] and Restless leg syndrome and back pain
[301.00 - 306.80] foot pain neck pain and severe severe
[303.84 - 309.84] fatigue weren't being fixed by either
[306.80 - 313.04] side the protocols for Lyme disease were
[309.84 - 315.68] intense harsh antibiotics and the
[313.04 - 318.28] protocols for so-called parasite issues
[315.68 - 321.48] in the health movement were cleansers
[318.28 - 324.76] cleansing products Clays intestinal
[321.48 - 327.96] Clays shiled fulvic minerals fulvic acid
[324.76 - 330.20] chlorine dioxide sodium bicarbonate quop
[327.96 - 333.92] pod apple ceter vinegar charcoal
[330.20 - 336.60] colostrum warmwood and alkaline ionizer
[333.92 - 339.16] water and nothing worked people stayed
[336.60 - 341.36] sick they were chronically ill lots of
[339.16 - 343.48] mysterious symptoms people went through
[341.36 - 346.28] the machine they went through the meat
[343.48 - 349.56] grinder they had nowhere to go nothing
[346.28 - 352.56] was working one reason it wasn't
[349.56 - 355.60] parasites parasites were not why people
[352.56 - 358.28] were sick with chronic illness but
[355.60 - 361.00] parasites made sense to people it made
[358.28 - 363.40] sense to them this m mysterious weird
[361.00 - 366.36] creature Critter living inside of a
[363.40 - 369.52] person it made a lot of sense it was a
[366.36 - 372.72] fly trap it brought people in left and
[369.52 - 374.52] right parasitical cleanses were huge
[372.72 - 376.60] they were huge because people were
[374.52 - 378.88] thinking that was the answer but they
[376.60 - 381.52] tried them been there done that and it
[378.88 - 384.72] didn't fix people hordes of people so
[381.52 - 387.32] then the parasitical world started to
[384.72 - 390.36] die that's right in the health movement
[387.32 - 392.84] it started to die it fell off the map
[390.36 - 395.76] and was taken over it was taken over
[392.84 - 398.92] once again by Candida by Fungus it was
[395.76 - 402.24] taken over once again by Sugar Sugar
[398.92 - 406.12] being the problem sugar fruit fear took
[402.24 - 408.60] it over so new thing started fruit fear
[406.12 - 410.92] sugar sugar was the cause of everybody's
[408.60 - 413.64] chronic illness everybody believed it
[410.92 - 417.20] everybody was told it here to high
[413.64 - 420.36] heaven it was all about sugar parasites
[417.20 - 423.84] took the back seat died off
[420.36 - 425.96] sugar was the evildoer it was the evil
[423.84 - 428.68] one it was Satan to everybody everybody
[425.96 - 434.16] was afraid of sugar and every shape
[428.68 - 436.12] fashion or form fruit was evil was very
[434.16 - 438.68] frightening and along with the fruit
[436.12 - 440.44] fear came the protein deficiencies
[438.68 - 442.60] you're not getting enough protein that's
[440.44 - 445.32] why you're sick that's got to be the
[442.60 - 448.32] answer you're not getting enough protein
[445.32 - 450.20] so you're dying so you're fatigued so
[448.32 - 453.16] you're having chronic illness
[450.20 - 455.80] you must be protein deficient and at the
[453.16 - 460.28] same time years ago a new storm was
[455.80 - 461.60] occurring oxalates oxyc acid everybody
[460.28 - 463.28] was starting to believe that was the
[461.60 - 465.52] cause of their illness that's why they
[463.28 - 467.44] had chronic illness that's why they were
[465.52 - 469.24] in wheelchairs that's why they were sick
[467.44 - 471.52] that's why they couldn't function it's
[469.24 - 474.52] why they had add that's why they had
[471.52 - 477.60] brain fog it must have been oxyc acid
[474.52 - 480.24] oxalates that was the big one it covered
[477.60 - 484.96] up the parasitical craze parasitical
[480.24 - 488.72] craze died oxyc acid arrived candida
[484.96 - 491.60] came back and protein was God and then
[488.72 - 493.68] an upsurge of alkaline water so
[491.60 - 496.00] everybody who's chronically sick ended
[493.68 - 498.52] up buying the alkaline ionizer water
[496.00 - 501.16] machines thinking this would be the fix
[498.52 - 503.68] all that this would take care of it but
[501.16 - 506.20] the machines ended up in the closets
[503.68 - 507.88] everybody's closets people couldn't give
[506.20 - 509.92] them away fast enough because they were
[507.88 - 511.88] getting worse drinking the water water
[509.92 - 514.64] even from the best machines that are out
[511.88 - 516.76] there today they didn't know that the
[514.64 - 519.40] metal plates inside the machines were
[516.76 - 523.12] corroding just like they do today and
[519.40 - 526.44] will always do the corrosion released
[523.12 - 528.88] oxidation micro particles of metals
[526.44 - 531.00] entering into people so that wasn't the
[528.88 - 534.28] answer either and still isn't the answer
[531.00 - 536.76] today but back then they had their day
[534.28 - 539.44] their upsurge and then the alkaline
[536.76 - 541.80] ionizer and water machine died it
[539.44 - 544.60] exceeded and fell back just like the
[541.80 - 547.08] parasite World in fact all of these
[544.60 - 549.72] things fell back and died and there was
[547.08 - 552.56] a great big hole in the health world the
[549.72 - 555.40] health movement people sick and
[552.56 - 558.28] exhausted tried everything been there
[555.40 - 561.44] done that nothing worked and they were
[558.28 - 563.64] all sick chronic illness was on the rise
[561.44 - 567.16] people didn't have answers to why they
[563.64 - 569.64] were even sick and biohacks of that era
[567.16 - 572.64] were on life support Maybe maybe you
[569.64 - 574.84] were there maybe this has meaning to you
[572.64 - 577.16] maybe you tried everything done that
[574.84 - 579.88] been there and maybe this is all just
[577.16 - 582.28] new to you but it's important to know
[579.88 - 585.20] imperative to know when it comes down to
[582.28 - 588.60] being sick and healing it's important to
[585.20 - 591.56] know that the parasitical scam was here
[588.60 - 593.48] before and it's here now again and no
[591.56 - 596.24] disrespect to anyone it doesn't mean
[593.48 - 597.72] someone's trying to truly scam someone a
[596.24 - 600.76] lot of people could have their heart in
[597.72 - 604.16] it they could have invest ments in it
[600.76 - 606.76] time money energy and truly believe in
[604.16 - 608.60] what they're doing and some could be
[606.76 - 612.28] scamming people because that's the
[608.60 - 614.28] industry now it's a dog eat dog world
[612.28 - 617.44] now let's talk about parasites and get
[614.28 - 620.60] deeper into it parasites are real they
[617.44 - 623.84] exist they're on every single raw piece
[620.60 - 626.00] of beef raw piece of chicken they're all
[623.84 - 628.48] over packages in the grocery store
[626.00 - 631.88] there's parasites all over packages
[628.48 - 634.72] around meat and pork and chicken and
[631.88 - 636.88] fish if you go into a grocery store and
[634.72 - 640.56] you buy some fish that's wrapped in
[636.88 - 642.92] plastic in a container or some pork or
[640.56 - 645.44] some beef it'll be on the outside of the
[642.92 - 648.16] container there'll be parasites all over
[645.44 - 650.80] the outside and in a display case you
[648.16 - 652.72] see fish of all kinds seafood or another
[650.80 - 655.84] display case where you see organ meats
[652.72 - 658.56] and pork and chicken and grass-fed beef
[655.84 - 659.80] there's parasites everywhere everywhere
[658.56 - 662.24] all over it
[659.80 - 665.24] all kinds of different microbes bad
[662.24 - 667.92] microbes not good microbes and from a
[665.24 - 669.96] scale 1 to 10 some of those parasites
[667.92 - 672.56] could be extremely
[669.96 - 676.16] dangerous some of them could be very
[672.56 - 679.64] mild now the mild ones get killed off
[676.16 - 681.96] easy in your gut all you need is just a
[679.64 - 684.96] little bit of HCL a little bit of
[681.96 - 688.68] hydrochloric acid naturally inside your
[684.96 - 692.00] stomach produced by your stomach glands
[688.68 - 695.64] and that hydrochloric acid is your
[692.00 - 698.88] parasitical killer in fact you eat
[695.64 - 701.16] parasites often and don't know it your
[698.88 - 703.60] HCL is killing and destroying those
[701.16 - 707.08] parasites there's parasites on people's
[703.60 - 709.56] hands there's parasites on door handles
[707.08 - 712.32] there's parasites in bathrooms and
[709.56 - 715.56] bathroom sink handles there's parasites
[712.32 - 718.08] in restaurants on food you ordered and
[715.56 - 720.48] most all of these parasites don't bother
[718.08 - 723.84] anybody because they they die off they
[720.48 - 725.92] get killed off they get killed off fast
[723.84 - 729.48] sometimes just in our
[725.92 - 732.32] mouths sometimes in our stomach
[729.48 - 735.60] sometimes in our dadum and even in our
[732.32 - 738.56] small intestinal tract but they die off
[735.60 - 740.84] they get killed these parasites that we
[738.56 - 743.60] actually eat a lot of and don't even
[740.84 - 746.36] realize it or get exposed to it a lot
[743.60 - 748.08] die off they don't stick around they
[746.36 - 749.56] don't stay anywhere they don't stay in
[748.08 - 751.16] the liver they don't stay in the
[749.56 - 753.48] intestinal tract they don't stay in the
[751.16 - 756.60] stomach they don't stay in the rectum
[753.48 - 759.56] they don't stay anywhere these parasites
[756.60 - 762.56] come and they go as fast as they came
[759.56 - 765.08] they die and our immune system has a big
[762.56 - 768.20] part involved with killing them our
[765.08 - 770.44] immune cells love parasites they feed
[768.20 - 772.88] off of them they destroy them they
[770.44 - 775.16] gobble them up they break them apart and
[772.88 - 777.28] they discard them and all of this is
[775.16 - 779.20] happening when you don't even know it
[777.28 - 783.20] you're not even aware of it you're
[779.20 - 788.12] immune system destroys level one level 2
[783.20 - 789.80] 3 4 5 level six level seven parasites
[788.12 - 793.08] now keep in mind there's hundreds of
[789.80 - 796.28] varieties of parasites not registered
[793.08 - 799.84] not documented there are thousands of
[796.28 - 802.52] varieties of different forms of microbes
[799.84 - 805.92] and parasites and they all fall under
[802.52 - 808.40] the parasite umbrella and science
[805.92 - 811.16] doesn't care there's no money involved
[808.40 - 813.88] there's no money to be made research in
[811.16 - 816.16] science doesn't study them they're aware
[813.88 - 819.44] they exist they're aware there's a lot
[816.16 - 823.32] of microbes out there many harmless many
[819.44 - 827.52] not harmless and many dangerous yes
[823.32 - 830.68] dangerous level 8 n 10 and Beyond very
[827.52 - 832.72] dangerous can kill someone that's right
[830.68 - 835.36] can kill someone so let's get into that
[832.72 - 838.04] a little bit you go down to Mexico and
[835.36 - 841.60] you drink the water in a basin or a
[838.04 - 843.36] ravine or a canal or a pond and you
[841.60 - 845.64] drink that water you're not going
[843.36 - 848.84] anywhere you'd be lucky if you made it
[845.64 - 851.64] home because you picked up a parasite
[848.84 - 854.08] that's right a parasite a real parasite
[851.64 - 857.32] floating around in dirty water swimming
[854.08 - 859.68] around in dirty water an amoeba or some
[857.32 - 862.00] other form of parasite sitting in that
[859.68 - 864.04] water and if you drink it you'll be
[862.00 - 865.36] lucky if you can get home and most
[864.04 - 867.68] likely you'll just end up in the
[865.36 - 869.84] hospital and you'll be in there fighting
[867.68 - 872.20] for your life with dis
[869.84 - 876.16] a broad term for some type of food
[872.20 - 878.76] poisoning or parasitical infection now
[876.16 - 882.36] with this parasitical infection you have
[878.76 - 885.28] to win yes you have to heal you have to
[882.36 - 888.92] get better what that means is you can't
[885.28 - 892.16] live with it your body won't allow you
[888.92 - 895.24] to live with a parasite so it's kill or
[892.16 - 898.04] be killed it's either the parasite kills
[895.24 - 900.76] you which happens to a lot of people or
[898.04 - 903.20] your body kills kills the parasite but
[900.76 - 905.84] you can't live with it long term you
[903.20 - 908.80] can't be somebody with chronic illness
[905.84 - 911.04] going for years and years thinking
[908.80 - 913.44] you've had a parasitical infection a
[911.04 - 915.96] chronic parasitical infection all these
[913.44 - 919.28] years and that's your problem because
[915.96 - 922.40] it's not you can't live with a parasite
[919.28 - 925.48] in your system your body has to kill it
[922.40 - 929.24] and that killing of it is the war and
[925.48 - 931.96] that war is sickness in the moment death
[929.24 - 933.56] defying sickness for a lot of people or
[931.96 - 935.36] difficult sickness for a lot of people
[933.56 - 938.68] or mild sickness for a lot of people but
[935.36 - 942.84] it's only temporary it's you win or the
[938.68 - 945.84] bug wins you win or the parasite wins
[942.84 - 947.32] it's not I'm sick for 10 years whoa I
[945.84 - 949.56] just learned that maybe if I do a
[947.32 - 952.00] parasite cleanse that that'll fix it
[949.56 - 954.80] because I must have a parasite nope
[952.00 - 957.52] that's not how it works that you win or
[954.80 - 960.28] the parasite wins same thing if you end
[957.52 - 963.00] up with food poisoning you eat in a
[960.28 - 968.20] restaurant something was in the food
[963.00 - 971.92] some food born pathogen yes a parasite a
[968.20 - 973.68] food born pathogen a parasite and you
[971.92 - 975.64] eat that and now you're sick you're
[973.68 - 978.24] throwing up you're vomiting you have
[975.64 - 981.04] diarrhea you have the runs it won't stop
[978.24 - 983.80] you're in tremendous pain Agony the
[981.04 - 986.00] worst kind you try to push through a day
[983.80 - 987.52] goes by you're going through the vomits
[986.00 - 989.12] again you're going through the runs
[987.52 - 991.80] again you're going through the diarrhea
[989.12 - 994.80] is again and you can't get better
[991.80 - 996.36] something's wrong getting dehydrated now
[994.80 - 998.52] you're at the hospital you're hooked up
[996.36 - 1000.76] to an IV and they put you on some kind
[998.52 - 1003.32] of pain killer maybe even morphine to
[1000.76 - 1005.96] dumb down the pain and you try to rest
[1003.32 - 1008.48] while your immune system tries to kill
[1005.96 - 1010.36] off whatever that food born pathogen is
[1008.48 - 1013.72] whatever that parasite is because the
[1010.36 - 1016.40] war is on it's not about living
[1013.72 - 1019.04] simultaneously living in harmony living
[1016.40 - 1021.96] in some way down the road together
[1019.04 - 1025.48] doesn't work like that the bug the food
[1021.96 - 1028.88] born pathogen has to be killed same
[1025.48 - 1031.80] thing with aggressive forms of eoli that
[1028.88 - 1034.88] aren't the normal forms of eoli the
[1031.80 - 1037.88] aggressive foodborn varieties they have
[1034.88 - 1040.04] to be killed you can't live with them so
[1037.88 - 1042.76] you lay in the hospital while your body
[1040.04 - 1046.36] fights for its life while your immune
[1042.76 - 1049.40] system fights for your life while the
[1046.36 - 1051.64] doctors can't do anything about it sides
[1049.40 - 1054.92] keep you hydrated keep you plugged into
[1051.64 - 1057.28] a salt bag to an IV and then give you
[1054.92 - 1059.72] painkillers so you can rest and try to
[1057.28 - 1063.12] get some sleep allowing your body to
[1059.72 - 1066.64] heal and that is foodborn pathogens
[1063.12 - 1069.48] that's food poisoning That's parasites
[1066.64 - 1071.96] those are parasites that are aggressive
[1069.48 - 1073.96] and they can come in any old shape and
[1071.96 - 1076.96] size because there's hundreds of them
[1073.96 - 1079.40] and thousands of them and most of them
[1076.96 - 1082.00] harmless because we kill them off fast
[1079.40 - 1085.92] our HCL kills them the more aggressive
[1082.00 - 1088.32] the parasite the less chance our HCL can
[1085.92 - 1090.80] kill them especially if our HCL
[1088.32 - 1092.88] hydrochloric acid is weakened in a
[1090.80 - 1095.40] weakened State our stomach glands aren't
[1092.88 - 1098.00] producing good HCL we've been drinking
[1095.40 - 1100.44] coffee for years our stomach glands are
[1098.00 - 1103.56] wasted we have adrenaline surges from
[1100.44 - 1105.80] fight or flight maybe we have vicces
[1103.56 - 1108.92] that actually cause adrenaline surges
[1105.80 - 1112.28] that burn out our gastric glands and the
[1108.92 - 1114.60] CL is not there it's not strong enough
[1112.28 - 1118.08] it's not at the quantity or the level it
[1114.60 - 1121.00] needs to be so pathogens Escape they
[1118.08 - 1123.36] bypass the stomach they enter the dadum
[1121.00 - 1126.32] and down into the intestinal tract they
[1123.36 - 1129.28] could even find their way into the liver
[1126.32 - 1133.76] if they can't be stopped now these are
[1129.28 - 1137.16] parasitical pathogens foodborn pathogens
[1133.76 - 1140.00] parasites not viruses not stealth
[1137.16 - 1142.32] viruses not multi udes of bacteria and
[1140.00 - 1145.56] different forms of bacteria like strep
[1142.32 - 1149.52] these are food related bugs these are
[1145.56 - 1152.36] water related bugs dirty water stagnant
[1149.52 - 1154.12] Still Water food poisoning and food
[1152.36 - 1155.56] poisoning stories you see and hear out
[1154.12 - 1158.04] there all the time and they're even in
[1155.56 - 1160.76] the media now where three members of a
[1158.04 - 1163.36] family die and they die before they even
[1160.76 - 1165.92] get to the hospital or they die in the
[1163.36 - 1168.80] hospital one dies at home two die in the
[1165.92 - 1172.60] hospital this happens all the time
[1168.80 - 1175.68] that's parasites really aggressive ones
[1172.60 - 1178.56] and it's you or the parasite you go down
[1175.68 - 1180.96] or the parasite goes down there's no
[1178.56 - 1182.92] other way it's not something you live
[1180.96 - 1185.72] with from here on out where you improve
[1182.92 - 1187.84] in the hospital and now you're better
[1185.72 - 1190.08] enough to get out of the hospital now
[1187.84 - 1192.36] you're home and you're sick because you
[1190.08 - 1194.32] still have the parasite or you still
[1192.36 - 1196.36] have the parasite for weeks and weeks
[1194.32 - 1199.24] and months and months now you might be
[1196.36 - 1201.32] injured and triggered by a par partical
[1199.24 - 1203.56] infection which leaves you sick for
[1201.32 - 1206.28] years after a situation like this but
[1203.56 - 1207.96] you don't have the parasite anymore you
[1206.28 - 1210.80] know how you know you don't have the
[1207.96 - 1212.88] parasite anymore you're still standing
[1210.80 - 1215.32] you're still breathing because you would
[1212.88 - 1219.20] have died the parasite would have killed
[1215.32 - 1223.48] you milder parasites and food born
[1219.20 - 1227.64] pathogens food born illness food born
[1223.48 - 1230.36] parasites milder less aggressive ones
[1227.64 - 1233.12] you kill fast your HCL and your immune
[1230.36 - 1235.96] cells kill and destroy quickly and you
[1233.12 - 1239.00] move on it could be one bat of diarrhea
[1235.96 - 1241.48] it could be one bout of vomiting and
[1239.00 - 1244.08] then you're good and maybe just a rough
[1241.48 - 1246.12] night you're good the next day you start
[1244.08 - 1248.24] picking up your pace and you're back to
[1246.12 - 1250.68] normal or you don't even know what
[1248.24 - 1252.76] happened your body killed it off real
[1250.68 - 1256.24] fast you got strong
[1252.76 - 1258.60] HC strong immune system immune cells and
[1256.24 - 1261.32] it was annihilated and annihilated with
[1258.60 - 1263.56] within the hour or half an hour after
[1261.32 - 1265.80] eating or getting exposure or getting
[1263.56 - 1268.56] some tainted water or getting something
[1265.80 - 1271.00] in your mouth that led to this but
[1268.56 - 1273.36] somebody sick for 20 years with chronic
[1271.00 - 1276.04] illness with different symptoms and
[1273.36 - 1279.48] conditions and neurological problems are
[1276.04 - 1282.08] not living with a parasite this is a
[1279.48 - 1284.56] misguided Mistake by people in the
[1282.08 - 1286.96] health movement that have no idea why
[1284.56 - 1289.76] people are sick still even though they
[1286.96 - 1292.12] seem qualified or they know a lot about
[1289.76 - 1294.28] vaccines or they know a lot about all
[1292.12 - 1297.24] kinds of different problems in health or
[1294.28 - 1299.24] food chemicals or processed foods and
[1297.24 - 1301.60] they're all talking a good game they
[1299.24 - 1304.16] still don't know why chronically ill
[1301.60 - 1307.36] people are chronically ill but it seems
[1304.16 - 1309.04] logical it seems like it makes sense if
[1307.36 - 1311.12] I was somebody sick with all kinds of
[1309.04 - 1313.76] neurological problems and different
[1311.12 - 1316.96] symptoms and I heard maybe it's
[1313.76 - 1319.56] parasitical and a parasite and I thought
[1316.96 - 1322.64] well my doctors probably don't know I've
[1319.56 - 1326.32] been to 50 doctors in the last 8 years
[1322.64 - 1329.64] and maybe this is the answer I have a
[1326.32 - 1331.80] parasite surely that's what it must be
[1329.64 - 1335.24] it sounds like it everybody's talking
[1331.80 - 1337.24] about it that must be what I have and
[1335.24 - 1339.48] you could be somebody that's like whoa I
[1337.24 - 1341.24] got sick last year it's probably a
[1339.48 - 1344.28] parasite from all the information I'm
[1341.24 - 1347.56] seeing out there now without realizing
[1344.28 - 1349.04] what happened 20 years ago 15 years ago
[1347.56 - 1352.48] 12 years ago
[1349.04 - 1355.56] 25 years ago not knowing about the
[1352.48 - 1358.40] parasitical understanding the trend how
[1355.56 - 1360.60] it works and the parasite scam what
[1358.40 - 1362.56] people are really living with what
[1360.60 - 1365.96] they're really dealing with are
[1362.56 - 1368.52] pathogens yes but stealth
[1365.96 - 1370.84] viruses that's what they've always been
[1368.52 - 1374.92] living and dealing with it's stealth
[1370.84 - 1376.68] viruses epscene bar shingles
[1374.92 - 1380.00] hhv6
[1376.68 - 1383.16] hhv7 different variety of herpes of all
[1380.00 - 1386.80] kinds undiscovered varieties plus
[1383.16 - 1389.20] simplex one Simplex 2 people are living
[1386.80 - 1391.88] with multiple varieties of these at one
[1389.20 - 1394.32] time two varieties of epine bar a
[1391.88 - 1397.84] variety of shingles and a cold sore
[1394.32 - 1403.28] virus herpes simplex 1 all at the same
[1397.84 - 1406.00] time along with bacteria strep varieties
[1403.28 - 1410.52] some people can pick up over a lifetime
[1406.00 - 1411.84] 10 15 20 varieties strep some aggressive
[1410.52 - 1414.44] causing chronic
[1411.84 - 1418.48] sinusitis causing mucus in their chest
[1414.44 - 1421.60] in their lungs causing severe acne UTI
[1418.48 - 1424.60] kidney infections bladder infections BV
[1421.60 - 1426.20] bacterial vaginosis and living with
[1424.60 - 1428.84] difficult strep varieties that are
[1426.20 - 1431.20] antibiotic resistance not just one
[1428.84 - 1433.80] antibiotic resistance strain but
[1431.20 - 1435.40] multiple and some people have a little
[1433.80 - 1437.76] bit of everything they'll have some
[1435.40 - 1440.40] strep other varieties of bacteria too
[1437.76 - 1442.68] they'll have sta maybe some SEI maybe
[1440.40 - 1444.56] they'll have two Epstein bars and they
[1442.68 - 1446.16] can live miserable because there's
[1444.56 - 1449.24] different varieties of these bugs some
[1446.16 - 1451.36] more aggressive some milder depending on
[1449.24 - 1453.96] the person's immune system their
[1451.36 - 1456.84] deficiencies are they zinc deficient are
[1453.96 - 1458.48] they B12 deficient and so forth people
[1456.84 - 1460.64] have chronic illness because of
[1458.48 - 1463.68] pathogens they also have chronic illness
[1460.64 - 1467.64] because of toxic heavy metals both
[1463.68 - 1469.96] metals and pathogens equal chronic
[1467.64 - 1472.68] illness chronic mystery long-term
[1469.96 - 1475.56] illness and autoimmune where do
[1472.68 - 1479.32] parasites fit in with all this
[1475.56 - 1481.88] nowhere they don't fit in anywhere
[1479.32 - 1484.72] parasites are a problem that when you
[1481.88 - 1486.84] get one has to be killed off your body
[1484.72 - 1490.28] has to do it that's the fight for your
[1486.84 - 1493.04] life if it's a mild parasite very
[1490.28 - 1495.40] minimal issues can occur you may not
[1493.04 - 1498.36] even know you had a parasite your HCL
[1495.40 - 1501.72] killed it and it's gone medical medium
[1498.36 - 1504.88] information broke barriers the discovery
[1501.72 - 1507.52] of all these different viruses stealth
[1504.88 - 1510.76] living in US causing neurological
[1507.52 - 1512.72] symptoms it changed everything in health
[1510.76 - 1515.68] people found answers and they knew what
[1512.72 - 1518.92] kind of protocols to use to heal and
[1515.68 - 1522.20] those protocols were entirely different
[1518.92 - 1524.76] than the trends of yester year of years
[1522.20 - 1527.48] ago the opposite of fulvic minerals
[1524.76 - 1529.76] fulvic acid Bentonite Clays and other
[1527.48 - 1532.44] different clays chillig apple ceter
[1529.76 - 1535.00] vinegar chlorophyll alkaline water
[1532.44 - 1538.44] chlorine dioxide sodium bicarbonate
[1535.00 - 1540.40] charcoal colostrum just to name a few
[1538.44 - 1542.32] these never worked they didn't work for
[1540.40 - 1544.60] people years ago they don't work for
[1542.32 - 1546.52] people today and part of the reason why
[1544.60 - 1550.00] so many people are healing from chronic
[1546.52 - 1552.52] illness is the things that do work the
[1550.00 - 1555.84] medical medium information that brought
[1552.52 - 1560.44] in olive leaf licorice propolis golden
[1555.84 - 1563.40] seal Elderberry zinc vitamin C B12 cats
[1560.44 - 1566.04] claw and many other tools turned people
[1563.40 - 1568.72] around got their lives back with chronic
[1566.04 - 1571.40] symptoms neurological symptoms because
[1568.72 - 1573.88] it was based on killing off pathogens
[1571.40 - 1576.80] medical medium information killing off
[1573.88 - 1579.04] stealth viruses like Epstein bar that's
[1576.80 - 1581.12] how people got their lives back they got
[1579.04 - 1583.44] their lives back back then and they're
[1581.12 - 1586.72] getting their lives back now but the
[1583.44 - 1588.84] parasitical world is upsurging again and
[1586.72 - 1592.16] they're talking the same game
[1588.84 - 1594.16] same game as yester year of decades ago
[1592.16 - 1595.92] they're talking about parasites when
[1594.16 - 1598.52] that's not what people are suffering
[1595.92 - 1600.92] with that's not why people can't think
[1598.52 - 1603.68] with their brain fog have Alzheimer's
[1600.92 - 1606.20] dementia memory problems have ticks and
[1603.68 - 1608.52] spasms aches and pains neurological
[1606.20 - 1611.48] symptoms Galore restless leg syndrome
[1608.52 - 1615.36] balance issues dizziness vertigo tunitis
[1611.48 - 1618.40] it's not why people are sick but it's a
[1615.36 - 1621.08] good lur they bring them in they get
[1618.40 - 1624.24] them to listen because you have people a
[1621.08 - 1627.52] whole new batch of people new bees new
[1624.24 - 1629.00] sick bees they're there they're sick now
[1627.52 - 1630.88] they don't know why they're sick they
[1629.00 - 1632.36] already went through the merrygoround a
[1630.88 - 1635.36] little bit they've already went from
[1632.36 - 1639.00] Doctor to doctor they don't have answers
[1635.36 - 1642.00] and parasites seem perfect it only makes
[1639.00 - 1643.52] sense so they follow these doctors and
[1642.00 - 1645.92] follow these practitioners and these
[1643.52 - 1648.20] health coaches and the influencers and
[1645.92 - 1649.56] they think they have parasites but some
[1648.20 - 1651.84] something's changed about the
[1649.56 - 1654.36] parasitical protocols they're a little
[1651.84 - 1656.64] different and even a lot different now
[1654.36 - 1658.68] they have pieces of medical medium
[1656.64 - 1661.84] information they have medical medium
[1658.68 - 1664.56] tools they have lemon bomb they got B12
[1661.84 - 1666.84] they got zinc interesting they didn't
[1664.56 - 1668.48] have that before they didn't have that
[1666.84 - 1670.72] before the medical medium books and the
[1668.48 - 1672.96] medical medium information they only had
[1670.72 - 1675.20] their schillig they only had their
[1672.96 - 1677.24] fulvic minerals fulvic acid their sodium
[1675.20 - 1680.12] bicarbonate their alkaline water their
[1677.24 - 1682.96] chlorophyll they only had those they
[1680.12 - 1685.04] didn't have anything else but now you
[1682.96 - 1686.84] hear cats claw out there that's
[1685.04 - 1688.56] interesting it's a medical medium tool
[1686.84 - 1691.08] for chronic illness and neurological
[1688.56 - 1692.76] diseases and conditions and symptoms can
[1691.08 - 1696.20] that be a good thing they're poaching
[1692.76 - 1698.96] medical medium tools but using it for
[1696.20 - 1701.24] parasites it could be good in the way
[1698.96 - 1703.56] where someone might get a benefit they
[1701.24 - 1706.40] might actually get a little window into
[1703.56 - 1708.52] healing but it'll be stopped instantly
[1706.40 - 1711.00] when they offer something that is toxic
[1708.52 - 1713.36] or doesn't work and it goes against it
[1711.00 - 1715.56] they use a medical medium tool goes with
[1713.36 - 1718.04] the grain then they use something highly
[1715.56 - 1719.88] toxic goes against the grain and then
[1718.04 - 1721.72] people just don't really truly get
[1719.88 - 1725.64] better and they believe they have
[1721.72 - 1727.40] parasites when they don't and that's sad
[1725.64 - 1730.28] because we're not making the progress we
[1727.40 - 1732.40] need to make we need to know why we're
[1730.28 - 1735.48] sick we need to know why we have
[1732.40 - 1736.88] neurological symptoms we need to
[1735.48 - 1739.20] understand that and then we need the
[1736.88 - 1742.16] tools to fix it the medical medium
[1739.20 - 1745.96] information about what pathogens what
[1742.16 - 1746.80] stealth viruses what bacteria what toxic
[1745.96 - 1749.24] heavy
[1746.80 - 1751.72] metals what other poisons what other
[1749.24 - 1754.28] toxins what other exposures and what
[1751.72 - 1756.68] about the tools we need the right tools
[1754.28 - 1758.84] for the right problems having the
[1756.68 - 1762.72] answers matter instead of chasing our
[1758.84 - 1765.00] Tails having little tidbits is fun but
[1762.72 - 1768.16] we're just playing the game and when it
[1765.00 - 1771.16] comes down to health time matters
[1768.16 - 1773.48] wasting time matters we have to be able
[1771.16 - 1775.72] to heal we need to be doing things that
[1773.48 - 1778.08] are working we need to understand why
[1775.72 - 1781.52] we're sick to begin with and that's the
[1778.08 - 1782.84] sad thing people they don't know they
[1781.52 - 1785.20] don't know why they're sick with these
[1782.84 - 1786.48] mystery symptoms they're hearing tidbits
[1785.20 - 1788.68] that have been poached throughout the
[1786.48 - 1791.48] years for medical medium they're hearing
[1788.68 - 1793.48] different things it sounds good sounds
[1791.48 - 1796.28] like it might work maybe if they're
[1793.48 - 1798.72] lucky they'll get a poached tool that
[1796.28 - 1801.44] does help but in the end they're still
[1798.72 - 1803.96] in the dark and it's really sad
[1801.44 - 1806.00] parasites aren't the problem they're not
[1803.96 - 1808.84] the reason why people are suffering and
[1806.00 - 1811.92] sick out there yes parasites are
[1808.84 - 1814.60] dangerous but you now know how and why
[1811.92 - 1816.16] check out the medical medium book series
[1814.60 - 1818.56] pick up a brainsaver book or a

[1839.48 - 1844.48] you there's a big difference the
[1842.40 - 1848.20] parasites that knock you so hard you
[1844.48 - 1849.52] take a fall get up from the dinner table
[1848.20 - 1851.96] you got some food
[1849.52 - 1855.80] poisoning you're barfing in the toilet
[1851.96 - 1858.64] all night long huge difference then
[1855.80 - 1861.60] worms that creepy crawl
[1858.64 - 1864.36] the worms that people get inside of them
[1861.60 - 1867.84] that can live in synchronicity with
[1864.36 - 1872.36] everyone all day long the tapeworm can
[1867.84 - 1876.96] grow and grow and grow and get very
[1872.36 - 1880.68] long but is easily spotted and killed so
[1876.96 - 1884.84] the person can go back to their normal
[1880.68 - 1888.32] lifelong a heartworm in your pet can be
[1884.84 - 1891.80] stopped by a good vet there are are lots
[1888.32 - 1894.32] of annoying worms but they're different
[1891.80 - 1896.20] than chronic illness itself different
[1894.32 - 1898.16] than so many people suffering with
[1896.20 - 1900.40] different neurological symptoms
[1898.16 - 1903.72] struggling so much they can't even move
[1900.40 - 1906.80] through their day those are viruses and
[1903.72 - 1909.84] pathogens bacteria that keep people in
[1906.80 - 1912.32] that way and those stealth pathogens
[1909.84 - 1916.04] aren't parasites the ones that knock
[1912.32 - 1918.80] people down parasites old parasites that
[1916.04 - 1921.40] keep people in their hospital beds
[1918.80 - 1923.96] those parasites are so much different
[1921.40 - 1926.64] they stay with you until you're dead
[1923.96 - 1929.60] unless your body kills that parasite
[1926.64 - 1932.16] kills that parasite you're free to live
[1929.60 - 1934.52] another night the body's battle against
[1932.16 - 1936.28] a parasite is much different than the
[1934.52 - 1939.04] battle against stealth viruses and
[1936.28 - 1942.16] bacteria different we can live with
[1939.04 - 1944.92] stealth viruses in our body for the rest
[1942.16 - 1947.52] of our life and worms are different than
[1944.92 - 1950.36] parasites and stealth viruses they're
[1947.52 - 1952.88] much different we can live with them our
[1950.36 - 1953.68] whole life and not even have them cause
[1952.88 - 1956.96] a
[1953.68 - 1960.48] symptom yes some worms like a tapeworm
[1956.96 - 1964.04] can get really big and hurt us but they
[1960.48 - 1967.20] can be found really easily and killed
[1964.04 - 1969.48] within us don't be fooled these are
[1967.20 - 1974.84] three different things these are the
[1969.48 - 1978.84] rules parasites worms and pathogens try
[1974.84 - 1978.84] not to forget again
[1989.88 - 1993.80] original published medical medium
[1991.48 - 1996.28] information gets stolen and poached by

[2000.08 - 2003.80] proven Wrong by medical science and
[2001.64 - 2005.44] research instead the opposite only
[2003.80 - 2007.28] proven right and then taken from medical
[2005.44 - 2009.00] medium published material and used in
[2007.28 - 2011.12] the convention and Alternative Health
[2009.00 - 2013.04] communities medical medium information
[2011.12 - 2014.56] continually sets the stage for medical
[2013.04 - 2016.76] science to understand chronic illness
