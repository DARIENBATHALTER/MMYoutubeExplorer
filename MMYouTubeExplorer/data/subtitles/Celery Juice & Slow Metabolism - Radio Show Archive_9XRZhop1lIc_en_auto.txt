[11.00 - 18.12] to heal Anthony William is the medical
[15.76 - 19.52] medium hello this is Anthony William the
[18.12 - 20.88] medical Medium you're listening to the
[19.52 - 22.20] medical medium radio show where each
[20.88 - 24.72] week we bring you the most advanced
[22.20 - 26.64] healing information ahead of science and
[24.72 - 28.28] research in chronic illness so you have
[26.64 - 30.64] to think about that if science and
[28.28 - 33.48] research was so ahead of things if we
[30.64 - 35.20] were so good and Advan in science with
[33.48 - 36.88] chronic illness why is everybody getting
[35.20 - 39.48] sicker and sicker and sicker and I'm not
[36.88 - 42.08] talking about heart disease I'm not even
[39.48 - 44.28] talking about cancer I'm talking about
[42.08 - 46.20] people that can't function anymore they
[44.28 - 49.16] can't live their lives they have
[46.20 - 51.24] symptoms upon symptoms they can't think

[56.04 - 61.32] depression people with body aches and
[58.36 - 64.20] pains you know ache Facial Pain body

[76.60 - 83.36] CFS mecfs brain inflammation completely
[81.04 - 85.92] completely just missed by science and
[83.36 - 87.72] research everything toxic heavy metals
[85.92 - 89.20] that are causing all of this pathogens
[87.72 - 91.76] that are causing all of this I talk
[89.20 - 93.56] about the most Advanced information I
[91.76 - 95.08] brought this to town thanks to spirit
[93.56 - 96.92] cuz Spirit brought this information to
[95.08 - 98.68] me since I was a child if you're brand
[96.92 - 100.16] new to the medical medium and you don't
[98.68 - 102.76] know what's going on check out the
[100.16 - 105.16] medical medium books just give it a shot
[102.76 - 107.16] look into the medical medium series and
[105.16 - 109.20] pick out a book that you feel like you
[107.16 - 111.00] know speaks to you and work on your
[109.20 - 113.24] healing process you could save your life
[111.00 - 115.68] you could save other lives around you
[113.24 - 117.76] this information comes from Beyond and
[115.68 - 120.40] it's already helped Millions over the
[117.76 - 121.96] last 35 years so let's move forward
[120.40 - 124.52] we're talking about slow
[121.96 - 125.88] metabolism and uh celery juice too we're
[124.52 - 128.20] always talking about celery juice how it
[125.88 - 130.24] helps with metabolism issues but let's
[128.20 - 133.36] talk about metabolism Al together like
[130.24 - 135.84] what is it a slow metabolism was never
[133.36 - 139.28] behind anybody's symptoms or conditions
[135.84 - 142.88] so you need to know that so metabolism
[139.28 - 145.92] isn't the cause of somebody being sick
[142.88 - 148.12] or a problem happening or a symptom or a
[145.92 - 151.36] condition the term
[148.12 - 154.40] metabolism is only the discovery of
[151.36 - 156.76] being alive so slow metabolism isn't
[154.40 - 158.60] responsible for weight gain see that's
[156.76 - 160.84] that's that's unbelievable right I'll
[158.60 - 162.36] say it again a slow metabolism when
[160.84 - 164.52] someone's diagnosed with a slow
[162.36 - 166.36] metabolism and diagnosed what does that
[164.52 - 168.76] mean that means that someone's like oh
[166.36 - 171.16] you got a slow metabolism oh you must
[168.76 - 172.68] have a fast metabolism oh you must be
[171.16 - 175.36] one of those people that seem to you
[172.68 - 177.12] know have a fast metabolism I mean come
[175.36 - 179.76] on right think about that is that
[177.12 - 182.28] advanced is that like Advanced Signs and
[179.76 - 184.24] research is that where we are today so
[182.28 - 185.96] come on you know a slow metabolism that
[184.24 - 188.96] person's gaining weight so they must
[185.96 - 191.08] have a slow metabolism I mean let's just
[188.96 - 194.44] let's get real let's really get real
[191.08 - 197.96] here so the point is is that slow
[194.44 - 202.28] metabolism that we believe we have the
[197.96 - 205.00] term metabolism is only the discovery of
[202.28 - 207.08] being alive that's all it was see it was
[205.00 - 209.12] a discovery that something happens when
[207.08 - 210.40] you put food in your mouth hundreds of
[209.12 - 212.88] years ago
[210.40 - 214.92] yeah you put food in your mouth and it's
[212.88 - 218.24] it's a discovery that blood is moving
[214.92 - 221.00] through our body blood is actually
[218.24 - 224.16] pumping something's pumping blood
[221.00 - 226.16] through our veins and arteries that's
[224.16 - 228.36] what metabolism was the discovery that
[226.16 - 232.28] we're a living creature that when you
[228.36 - 234.64] consume an energy source via food that
[232.28 - 237.04] you're utilizing it it's giving you
[234.64 - 239.40] energy and you're able to function we're
[237.04 - 241.88] alive that's the discovery of metabolism
[239.40 - 244.16] by the way way that's the that that's
[241.88 - 247.76] the great scientific discovery right
[244.16 - 250.92] there a slow slow metabolism does not
[247.76 - 254.16] give us an answer of what can truly go
[250.92 - 257.12] wrong to create a condition such as
[254.16 - 258.68] weight gain or losing too much weight so
[257.12 - 260.24] when somebody's losing too much weight
[258.68 - 263.04] and we say hey they must have a fast
[260.24 - 265.60] metabolism it's ridiculous it really is
[263.04 - 268.40] cuz that's not how it works see
[265.60 - 272.20] metabolism became law it's one of those
[268.40 - 274.84] old old grandfathered laws that has
[272.20 - 278.84] taken over the consciousness of the
[274.84 - 281.84] human race I know that sounds drastic I
[278.84 - 284.24] know that sounds a little too much maybe
[281.84 - 286.48] but when you really think about it it's
[284.24 - 289.40] literally all everybody ever thinks
[286.48 - 292.64] about I mean we have so many people
[289.40 - 295.48] suffering with chronic illness dying or
[292.64 - 298.88] living lives that aren't at the fullest
[295.48 - 300.64] potential it's it's really funny how all
[298.88 - 302.60] that self-help self talk out there that
[300.64 - 305.80] self-help talk and all that good
[302.60 - 307.60] Feelgood positive talk and all the just
[305.80 - 310.28] all of it the Law of Attraction talk and
[307.60 - 312.52] all of the all the talk out there about
[310.28 - 314.64] living to our greatest and our greatest
[312.52 - 316.12] potential which I support I've always
[314.64 - 318.12] supported that I've always supported
[316.12 - 320.76] living to our greatest potential I've
[318.12 - 322.92] always supported living in a positive a
[320.76 - 325.24] most positive being that we have most
[322.92 - 327.48] positive sense that we have inside of us
[325.24 - 329.92] you know our our souls elevating to a
[327.48 - 332.48] point of you know being positive living
[329.92 - 334.80] at our best you know living life at our
[332.48 - 336.20] best the best quality we can can can and
[334.80 - 337.84] the best quality of life we can I've
[336.20 - 339.96] always subscribed to all of that I've
[337.84 - 342.64] always been a supporter of all that but
[339.96 - 344.36] then when we think about we leave the
[342.64 - 345.80] fact out of all the people that are
[344.36 - 348.12] struggling and suffering and chronic
[345.80 - 350.16] illness from young people to teenagers
[348.12 - 352.64] to young adults to college students to
[350.16 - 354.28] young adults to older people to you know
[352.64 - 357.84] people middle-aged or however we want to
[354.28 - 359.68] say it now these days you know everybody
[357.84 - 363.12] is struggling and they're struggling de
[359.68 - 365.44] with real real chronic issues all the
[363.12 - 368.48] time you know debilitating to some you
[365.44 - 370.16] know plaguing them to some degree and so
[368.48 - 371.44] when we think about you living the best
[370.16 - 374.00] quality of life and living their best
[371.44 - 376.92] full potential what about the millions
[374.00 - 379.68] of people that they can't even think
[376.92 - 381.96] about that they can't even think about
[379.68 - 384.16] you know wh what's the best quality
[381.96 - 386.16] what's the best greatness they can even
[384.16 - 388.44] achieve to when they're suffering and
[386.16 - 389.92] struggling and so when you think about
[388.44 - 393.04] metabolism
[389.92 - 395.28] taking over it's almost like another one
[393.04 - 396.80] of those things to derail people who are
[395.28 - 399.52] struggling and suffering is what I'm
[396.80 - 401.96] trying to say it's another way of saying
[399.52 - 404.32] well you know what it's your metabolism
[401.96 - 406.84] it's another way of just blowing off
[404.32 - 409.28] people that are really sick that's what
[406.84 - 411.28] it is it's another great mistake I call
[409.28 - 413.60] it is what I'm trying to say it's
[411.28 - 415.56] another one of those derail people is
[413.60 - 417.40] what I'm trying to say you got people
[415.56 - 418.76] suffering and struggling left and right
[417.40 - 421.04] all over the place with all kinds of
[418.76 - 422.52] symptoms and conditions right and what
[421.04 - 424.84] we throw at them the best science and
[422.52 - 426.28] research we go to dietitians we go to
[424.84 - 427.80] some nutritionists we go to different
[426.28 - 429.48] people and the best science and research
[427.80 - 431.72] get thrown at them it could be your
[429.48 - 434.04] metabolism it could be that or that's
[431.72 - 435.84] what's responsible for it and you can't
[434.04 - 438.04] live to be at your greatest self because
[435.84 - 440.04] your metabolism is messed up you can't
[438.04 - 441.76] get that best quality of life because
[440.04 - 443.72] your metabolism is messed up maybe
[441.76 - 446.04] you're not thinking positive enough
[443.72 - 448.24] maybe you're creating your own illness
[446.04 - 450.24] maybe you're creating your own illness
[448.24 - 452.32] and it's messing up your metabolism see
[450.24 - 454.36] that's what I'm trying to say right here
[452.32 - 456.56] it it's it's it's really something when
[454.36 - 458.80] you get these roadblocks out there that
[456.56 - 460.96] are out there they're set in place to
[458.80 - 462.56] mess you up kind of like the autoimmune
[460.96 - 464.08] Theory I always talk about where they
[462.56 - 465.92] say your body's destroying itself when
[464.08 - 468.72] it's not when it was just a theory from
[465.92 - 470.12] the 1950s and if you read the books the
[468.72 - 471.88] medical medium series books you learn
[470.12 - 473.84] about how that's not true the body
[471.88 - 476.44] doesn't attack itself well these other
[473.84 - 477.92] great mistakes like metabolism and that
[476.44 - 480.04] and everything being blamed on your
[477.92 - 482.36] metabolism that's another prime example
[480.04 - 484.48] of to derail people to confuse them to
[482.36 - 486.92] throw them off the scent of what they
[484.48 - 488.88] really need to be doing is why isn't
[486.92 - 490.56] science in research stepping up to the
[488.88 - 492.56] game why aren't they stepping up and
[490.56 - 494.24] helping out women kind when health
[492.56 - 496.44] professionals all over the world are
[494.24 - 499.40] consumed with the term metabolism as if
[496.44 - 501.72] it holds any Merit any credibility any
[499.40 - 503.72] science research really any scientific
[501.72 - 505.40] discovery really when it holds any kind
[503.72 - 507.36] of credibility it's
[505.40 - 509.24] unbelievable especially what's going on
[507.36 - 510.40] with people suffering that's why I'm
[509.24 - 512.32] trying to talk about this a little bit
[510.40 - 514.00] more I mean I'm going to go into
[512.32 - 515.44] metabolism a lot you know a lot more to
[514.00 - 517.00] where we're heading and so just hang in
[515.44 - 519.44] there fasten your seat bels get a cup of
[517.00 - 521.20] tea just relax because we're going to
[519.44 - 523.44] cover this and this is going to be good
[521.20 - 526.16] but I wanted you guys to make sure that
[523.44 - 529.12] you knew how kind of disastrous the
[526.16 - 531.12] metabolism theory has been and how it
[529.12 - 533.52] has been a roadblock for so many for so
[531.12 - 535.04] long so when someone's struggling to get
[533.52 - 536.60] weight off of them and they're severely
[535.04 - 538.92] depressed because the weight is bogging
[536.60 - 541.92] them down they can't function good they
[538.92 - 544.16] got extra 50 lbs on them extra 70 lbs on
[541.92 - 545.36] them they're being made fun of you know
[544.16 - 547.60] they're being not they're not being
[545.36 - 549.12] taken seriously they're not being taken
[547.60 - 551.08] seriously that they even know how to
[549.12 - 552.32] take care of themselves or know how to
[551.08 - 553.92] take care of their families or whatever
[552.32 - 556.60] because people look at weight in such a
[553.92 - 558.64] negative way and it's so sad that people
[556.60 - 560.80] do that because it's not about it's that
[558.64 - 563.20] the weight on someone has nothing to do
[560.80 - 565.04] with their soul who they are as a person
[563.20 - 568.16] their accomplishments who they who they
[565.04 - 571.00] are inside and what happens is that you
[568.16 - 573.64] know weight is so judged in this world
[571.00 - 575.28] right and then to smack on a label like
[573.64 - 577.16] it's their metabolism they must be
[575.28 - 579.44] eating too much and they're not burning
[577.16 - 582.12] it off or something it's just
[579.44 - 583.84] unbelievable when there's bigger reasons
[582.12 - 585.76] there there's bigger reasons the weight
[583.84 - 587.68] is happening there's bigger reasons
[585.76 - 589.28] they're struggling with problems There's
[587.68 - 591.68] real reasons that science and research
[589.28 - 595.52] doesn't want to touch or go near because
[591.68 - 597.40] it's completely negligent completely
[595.52 - 598.68] negligent and you know you know how
[597.40 - 599.60] science of research you know how they
[598.68 - 601.60] trick you know you know how the whole
[599.60 - 603.52] science thing how it's all all trickery
[601.60 - 605.60] I'll tell you how it's trickery science
[603.52 - 608.08] is incredible in some areas because of
[605.60 - 609.88] technology and where it is today but
[608.08 - 612.32] then people are suffering with no
[609.88 - 615.32] answers that's where we are people
[612.32 - 617.56] suffering with no answers metabolism is
[615.32 - 619.80] the scientific word somehow still
[617.56 - 621.48] holding credibility to just throw
[619.80 - 624.24] everybody off the scent that science of
[621.48 - 626.28] research has failed everybody in chronic
[624.24 - 628.80] illness so let's go into this a little
[626.28 - 631.28] bit deeper so we want to go along with
[628.80 - 633.56] all this yes it's a man it's a manner of
[631.28 - 635.04] speaking we can talk about that you have
[633.56 - 636.56] a slow metabolism we can call it what
[635.04 - 638.08] you want then but let's let's talk about
[636.56 - 641.20] the truth of really what it is and
[638.08 - 642.36] what's happening let's go into there the
[641.20 - 645.20] true
[642.36 - 648.60] cause of what's called a slow metabolism
[645.20 - 651.92] is a sluggish liver so the true cause of
[648.60 - 656.52] a slow metabolism or what we call a slow
[651.92 - 660.20] metabolism is a sluggish stagnant toxic
[656.52 - 664.20] liver it's that simple a sluggish
[660.20 - 667.28] stagnant toxic liver that's a metabolic
[664.20 - 670.88] problem that's your metabolism so
[667.28 - 673.80] anybody you know anybody including
[670.88 - 677.72] yourself that may have heard or been
[673.80 - 679.80] told or diagnosed or anything like that
[677.72 - 682.56] that they have a slow
[679.80 - 686.08] metabolism understand that they have a
[682.56 - 688.36] liver that's a little tired a little
[686.08 - 690.64] toxic a little stagnant A little
[688.36 - 691.80] sluggish because something is going on
[690.64 - 693.48] inside that liver and we're going to
[691.80 - 694.96] explore what those things could be this
[693.48 - 696.84] could be pesticides and herbicides
[694.96 - 699.00] fungicides synthetic chemical sitting
[696.84 - 700.84] inside the liver our livers are filled
[699.00 - 702.76] with a variety of what I call
[700.84 - 704.88] troublemakers if you get the Liver
[702.76 - 706.92] Rescue book if you get the Liver Rescue
[704.88 - 709.32] book the medical medium Liver Rescue
[706.92 - 711.76] book and you'll see you know the you'll
[709.32 - 714.28] see uh it has Xmen psoriasis on the
[711.76 - 716.16] subtitle and all kinds of it has I talk
[714.28 - 718.44] about acne on the subtitle and so forth
[716.16 - 720.36] and you'll see that that's the book to
[718.44 - 721.12] get so you learn about this I talk about
[720.36 - 723.12] the
[721.12 - 724.92] troublemakers and the troublemakers are
[723.12 - 727.00] all these different things pesticides
[724.92 - 729.36] were exposed to all the time herbicides
[727.00 - 731.80] were Expos you know always exposed to
[729.36 - 734.28] fungicides synthetic chemicals you've
[731.80 - 736.68] been exposed to those you may not know
[734.28 - 740.16] it but you have I could talk about all
[736.68 - 743.40] about how viruses that's right we're all
[740.16 - 744.76] exposed to viruses we are there's no
[743.40 - 748.32] question about that Epstein bar being
[744.76 - 750.68] the number one bacteria Plastics we've
[748.32 - 754.40] always been EXP OS to Plastics toxic
[750.68 - 757.08] heavy metals were exposed to Mercury
[754.40 - 759.52] were exposed to aluminum lots of it in
[757.08 - 762.04] our system and in our body it's been
[759.52 - 764.56] passed down throughout the generations
[762.04 - 767.56] into our bodies through our forefathers
[764.56 - 769.64] ancestry even toxic hormones such as
[767.56 - 773.12] excess adrenaline from stress when
[769.64 - 777.36] you're stressed out what happens is your
[773.12 - 779.48] adrenals pump out toxic hormones toxic
[777.36 - 781.84] adrenaline that's how we we cope with
[779.48 - 784.60] stress this stuff is like battery acid
[781.84 - 787.16] it's corrosive to our bodies corrosive
[784.60 - 789.32] to our immune system and it fills up in
[787.16 - 790.88] the liver the liver sponges it all up it
[789.32 - 792.20] sponges it up have you been to the gas
[790.88 - 793.60] station pumping have you ever pumped
[792.20 - 795.88] your own gas at the gas station before
[793.60 - 798.04] in your life let me tell you something
[795.88 - 801.24] all those gas fumes that's a solvent all
[798.04 - 803.28] you have to do is breathe in gasoline
[801.24 - 805.44] gasoline fumes all you just have to
[803.28 - 807.52] whiff it and it's instantly inside your
[805.44 - 810.76] bloodstream and then being absorbed into
[807.52 - 813.04] the liver and we do that over and over
[810.76 - 815.24] and over again pumping our gas and I'm
[813.04 - 816.84] not saying be afraid of life don't ever
[815.24 - 819.08] get you know don't ever go and get gas
[816.84 - 820.96] lean that's not what I'm talking about
[819.08 - 823.64] I'm talking about the fact that we're
[820.96 - 827.96] exposed what do we do it clogs up the
[823.64 - 830.72] liver it clogs up it cogs up fat cells
[827.96 - 832.80] fat cells at the liver stores to protect
[830.72 - 834.88] you because we end up eating too much
[832.80 - 836.48] fat and so all this fat gets stuck into
[834.88 - 838.76] the liver and then all these toxins get
[836.48 - 841.52] stuck into the fat from our high prot
[838.76 - 843.48] protein high fat diets so when we eat
[841.52 - 845.76] the high fat high protein diets which
[843.48 - 848.08] everybody is still stuck doing science
[845.76 - 849.92] and research being so Advanced meanwhile
[848.08 - 852.48] we don't even know what to eat yet it's
[849.92 - 854.36] incredible the most advanced best
[852.48 - 856.68] doctor's diets out there and on the
[854.36 - 858.80] scene and on the circuit and the best
[856.68 - 861.40] the best kinds of diets out there and
[858.80 - 863.00] diet plans and different names and all
[861.40 - 865.36] those different diets and all that
[863.00 - 867.48] they're still completely void of what
[865.36 - 869.76] reality is to what our body needs
[867.48 - 871.68] they're always high fat and high protein
[869.76 - 874.20] and they slowly bog down our livers and
[871.68 - 875.80] slowly kill our livers so when you think
[874.20 - 876.92] about it back to the whole thing back to
[875.80 - 878.60] the whole thing what I was saying are
[876.92 - 880.32] you living your best quality of life how
[878.60 - 882.36] can you with all the misinformation out
[880.32 - 885.44] there how can you with the term
[882.36 - 889.56] metabolism being so backwards and so and
[885.44 - 891.44] so you know so misinformed or just wrong
[889.56 - 893.56] how can you live your best of life with
[891.44 - 895.88] this stuff going on this these are traps
[893.56 - 897.32] to stop you from living your best life
[895.88 - 898.92] and your greatest self and your full
[897.32 - 900.60] potential and your positive self and
[898.92 - 902.76] everything else and that's how the
[900.60 - 904.52] world's set up it's set up with this
[902.76 - 907.64] Darkness out there whether anybody likes
[904.52 - 910.60] it or not it's set up for a reason the
[907.64 - 913.76] medical world did this they do these
[910.60 - 917.04] things for a reason they create sand
[913.76 - 919.60] traps purposely so you get stuck in the
[917.04 - 921.64] sand traps and it slows down your best
[919.60 - 923.32] self or best quality of life or what
[921.64 - 926.04] you're trying to achieve in your life
[923.32 - 928.80] that's what it does that's what it's for
[926.04 - 931.92] so you end up for some reason needing
[928.80 - 933.40] Pharmaceuticals earlier on in life and
[931.92 - 935.04] earlier on in life you needed more
[933.40 - 937.52] Pharmaceuticals and more Pharmaceuticals
[935.04 - 939.28] you better believe it the troublemakers
[937.52 - 941.24] these pesticides herbicides these toxic
[939.28 - 943.44] heavy metals Mercury aluminum synthetic
[941.24 - 945.88] chemical solvents cleaning agents
[943.44 - 948.44] cleaning chemicals you know fabric
[945.88 - 950.88] softeners air fresheners plug in in the
[948.44 - 953.56] house all those things we absorb into
[950.88 - 957.08] our livers viruses bacteria Plastics
[953.56 - 959.32] hormones all of this gets inside our
[957.08 - 962.08] liver celery
[959.32 - 965.08] juice is one of the
[962.08 - 967.40] tools one of the tools Spirit brought to
[965.08 - 968.80] town for me when I was when I was a
[967.40 - 970.68] child in spirit said look it's going to
[968.80 - 972.96] be celery juice for people that's going
[970.68 - 977.20] to be one of their tickets out of the
[972.96 - 979.80] madness an herb called celery you know
[977.20 - 982.88] it revives the liver flushes out these
[979.80 - 985.04] various toxins and helps dissolve and
[982.88 - 986.72] disperse the fat cells trapped inside
[985.04 - 989.04] the liver from high protein high fat
[986.72 - 992.28] diets that surround
[989.04 - 993.64] and contain all of the toxic substances
[992.28 - 996.52] the troublemakers I talked about
[993.64 - 998.64] originally just a minute ago essentially
[996.52 - 1001.28] celery juice cleans out the liver
[998.64 - 1003.64] removing a variety of toxins and
[1001.28 - 1005.28] reducing viral loads what does that mean
[1003.64 - 1006.92] by reducing a viral load like what does
[1005.28 - 1008.64] that even mean it's the first time
[1006.92 - 1011.72] listening to this and listening to Med
[1008.64 - 1013.52] medical medium podcast and or reading in
[1011.72 - 1016.36] any of the medical medium books what
[1013.52 - 1018.20] does that mean a viral load is something
[1016.36 - 1019.40] like an Epstein bar sitting inside a
[1018.20 - 1021.36] liver
[1019.40 - 1024.52] proliferating
[1021.36 - 1025.52] growing expanding over time to
[1024.52 - 1028.24] eventually give you the heart
[1025.52 - 1029.84] palpitations The Hot Flashes eventually
[1028.24 - 1031.84] give you that per menopause symptom
[1029.84 - 1034.20] thing eventually give you reproductive
[1031.84 - 1036.00] problems fibroids eventually giving you
[1034.20 - 1039.08] all kinds of different cysts ovarian
[1036.00 - 1042.36] cysts how about that get chronic fatigue
[1039.08 - 1044.96] syndrome fatigue that's what it can do
[1042.36 - 1046.28] anxiety depression epine bars just
[1044.96 - 1048.48] sitting in there waiting to give you
[1046.28 - 1051.44] fibromyalgia your first fibromyalgia
[1048.48 - 1054.04] diagnosis when you're age 42 it's there
[1051.44 - 1057.64] waiting to give everybody this it's a
[1054.04 - 1060.92] viral load it's a virus sitting inside
[1057.64 - 1063.12] the liver percolating year after year as
[1060.92 - 1064.48] we feed it high protein high fat diets
[1063.12 - 1066.32] of all kinds whether it's vegan
[1064.48 - 1068.40] plant-based whether it's animal- based
[1066.32 - 1070.44] whatever it is and we just feed it the
[1068.40 - 1073.20] wrong Foods we feed it lots of eggs and
[1070.44 - 1075.52] these viruses grow so what is a viral
[1073.20 - 1078.12] load it's a virus such as Epstein bar or
[1075.52 - 1080.04] the shingles or hhv6 or cyto virus or
[1078.12 - 1083.40] some many other viruses or
[1080.04 - 1086.12] HPV even HPV why not sitting inside our
[1083.40 - 1087.84] bodies feeding off of the wrong Foods
[1086.12 - 1089.40] feeding off the chemicals and poisons
[1087.84 - 1091.52] that are trapped inside her liver
[1089.40 - 1093.24] percolating proliferating and going to
[1091.52 - 1095.12] give you symptoms later on down the road
[1093.24 - 1096.60] and all the Geniuses that write the
[1095.12 - 1098.16] Books and they're on the circuit and
[1096.60 - 1099.68] they're doing the podcast about health
[1098.16 - 1101.60] and talking about this diet and that
[1099.68 - 1103.80] diet and all the all the all the
[1101.60 - 1105.56] brainstormers think about science
[1103.80 - 1107.56] studies and science research don't even
[1105.56 - 1109.28] know any of this and if they do know a
[1107.56 - 1110.88] little bit of this it's because they got
[1109.28 - 1112.80] it and gleaned it from the medical
[1110.88 - 1114.64] medium series books or practitioners
[1112.80 - 1117.72] that actually use the books or they
[1114.64 - 1119.68] heard a podcast of mine and so forth so
[1117.72 - 1122.72] this is information you need to know
[1119.68 - 1124.36] celery juice awakens the liver you
[1122.72 - 1126.40] should be doing your celery juice you
[1124.36 - 1128.76] should get the celery juice book the
[1126.40 - 1131.28] medical medium celery juice book and you
[1128.76 - 1134.92] should be doing the celery juice awaken
[1131.28 - 1137.08] the liver clean it up so it can improve
[1134.92 - 1139.60] so everything else in the body can
[1137.08 - 1141.92] improve and if you want want to call it
[1139.60 - 1144.12] quote metabolism is is why you're
[1141.92 - 1147.36] gaining weight metabolism is why you're
[1144.12 - 1148.96] sick metabolism is why you're tired then
[1147.36 - 1152.28] fine get your metabolism better using
[1148.96 - 1154.12] celery juice is is part of it every
[1152.28 - 1155.88] organ becomes cleaner because that's
[1154.12 - 1157.84] what it really is it's not a slow
[1155.88 - 1159.92] metabolism your organs are becoming
[1157.84 - 1162.68] cleaner your liver is getting cleaner
[1159.92 - 1165.20] blood and lymphatic system become
[1162.68 - 1167.24] cleaner think about that blood and
[1165.20 - 1170.00] lymphatic system become
[1167.24 - 1171.64] cleaner unwanted weight gain let's go
[1170.00 - 1173.96] into that a little bit let's go into The
[1171.64 - 1176.76] Unwanted weight gain that's
[1173.96 - 1179.08] important when someone is gaining
[1176.76 - 1180.68] unwanted pounds it means the liver has
[1179.08 - 1184.28] been collecting and storing an abundance
[1180.68 - 1187.16] of fat cells so why is that happening
[1184.28 - 1188.92] you got a tired sluggish liver okay it's
[1187.16 - 1190.76] been beaten down by chemicals and and
[1188.92 - 1192.32] all kinds of stuff going on you got a
[1190.76 - 1195.20] pre fatty liver that's completely
[1192.32 - 1197.28] undiagnosed so you got a pre fatty liver
[1195.20 - 1199.04] because there's pre pre pre fatty liver
[1197.28 - 1201.16] it's just basically you're just not
[1199.04 - 1203.32] getting a diagnosis of a fatty liver but
[1201.16 - 1205.20] you're going to someday and if you don't
[1203.32 - 1208.32] you're still getting a fatty
[1205.20 - 1212.04] liver and then these fat cells collect
[1208.32 - 1214.04] they store they collect and they store
[1212.04 - 1216.72] and they have poison inside the fat
[1214.04 - 1220.76] cells inside the liver and that's when
[1216.72 - 1222.76] weight gain starts to show up that's
[1220.76 - 1225.40] when it starts to show up it shows up
[1222.76 - 1227.56] when the liver's already been filling up
[1225.40 - 1230.84] it's already been filling up with these
[1227.56 - 1233.00] fat cells you see you guys see the
[1230.84 - 1234.52] liver's already been filling up over the
[1233.00 - 1237.60] years so if you're one of those where
[1234.52 - 1239.88] you're always battling a pound or two l
[1237.60 - 1241.04] pounds on you say you're somebody you're
[1239.88 - 1242.76] young you're in the gym and you're
[1241.04 - 1244.64] trying to knock off those two pounds
[1242.76 - 1246.68] your college weight and then you're
[1244.64 - 1248.44] knocking it off and then it's coming
[1246.68 - 1249.84] back on as you're eating your high
[1248.44 - 1251.24] protein diets and you're trying to keep
[1249.84 - 1252.72] your low carbs and then you're
[1251.24 - 1254.28] exercising and you're breaking it down
[1252.72 - 1256.72] coming off that means your liver already
[1254.28 - 1258.56] filled up with fat if you're getting fat
[1256.72 - 1261.68] on the outside of the body it means your
[1258.56 - 1264.24] liver already became pre fatty even at a
[1261.68 - 1265.84] even at 18 years old 19 years old 20
[1264.24 - 1268.96] years old you already got a pre fatty
[1265.84 - 1270.92] liver you already have a problem and
[1268.96 - 1272.92] then sure you can say well you know hey
[1270.92 - 1275.56] my girlfriend or my boyfriend or
[1272.92 - 1277.48] something has he he's got more weight on
[1275.56 - 1279.44] him it's a slow he's got a slower
[1277.48 - 1282.76] metabolism he exercises in the gym but
[1279.44 - 1284.76] he can't keep it off and what happens is
[1282.76 - 1287.04] that's just a sluggish a more sluggish
[1284.76 - 1289.52] toxic liver with more pollutants inside
[1287.04 - 1291.04] the liver including possible viral load
[1289.52 - 1293.04] a viral load the very thing I was
[1291.04 - 1295.84] talking about earlier right remember the
[1293.04 - 1297.52] viral load and then you got that sitting
[1295.84 - 1298.84] inside the liver you got the weight
[1297.52 - 1301.48] coming
[1298.84 - 1303.24] on and then we deem that as slow
[1301.48 - 1307.80] metabolism like what a great mistake
[1303.24 - 1310.96] that is weight gain is not a result of a
[1307.80 - 1313.20] slow metabolism the liver is responsible
[1310.96 - 1316.84] for weight issues throughout all parts
[1313.20 - 1318.56] of the body so remember that you wake up
[1316.84 - 1320.92] one morning you see you see fat on the
[1318.56 - 1322.92] body that you don't want there that just
[1320.92 - 1324.32] it's the liver it's you got to get the
[1322.92 - 1326.72] liver healthy you got to get the Liver
[1324.32 - 1328.04] Rescue book the medical me Liver Rescue
[1326.72 - 1330.04] book and you got to start taking your
[1328.04 - 1332.48] liver seriously because as you go grow
[1330.04 - 1335.60] older it's not it's not going to it's
[1332.48 - 1338.20] not going to go down good people dealing
[1335.60 - 1340.44] with weight issues are also often
[1338.20 - 1342.64] dealing with lymphatic issues because
[1340.44 - 1344.88] when the weight's gaining and the and
[1342.64 - 1346.84] the and and the liver getting sluggish
[1344.88 - 1348.92] and stagnant and the lymphatic system
[1346.84 - 1350.76] gets sluggish and clogged up and it's
[1348.92 - 1352.96] harboring an abundance of fat cells in
[1350.76 - 1355.04] the lymphatic system because of an
[1352.96 - 1356.40] overloaded liver and then the lymphatic
[1355.04 - 1359.76] system gets
[1356.40 - 1362.24] overloaded with poisons and toxins
[1359.76 - 1364.28] because the liver's so filled up at this
[1362.24 - 1366.76] point you know when you're drinking that
[1364.28 - 1368.84] celery juice the chemical compounds from
[1366.76 - 1371.44] the celery juice enter the digestive
[1368.84 - 1374.36] system absorb into the intestinal tract
[1371.44 - 1376.48] walls go up to the hepatic portal vein
[1374.36 - 1378.40] and enter the liver they start to
[1376.48 - 1379.96] revitalize the liver cell so when you're
[1378.40 - 1381.48] drinking that celery juice it's dropping
[1379.96 - 1383.40] down through the digestive tract getting
[1381.48 - 1385.48] down into the intestinal tract getting
[1383.40 - 1387.00] down going up the hepatic portal vein
[1385.48 - 1388.64] that's the highway up to the liver
[1387.00 - 1392.16] because everything has to go up to the
[1388.64 - 1394.60] liver everything it's like a medicinal
[1392.16 - 1398.32] infusion for the liver that celery juice
[1394.60 - 1400.68] is being driven up into the liver it's
[1398.32 - 1403.12] an infusion into the liver to wake it up
[1400.68 - 1405.36] to get it out of its stagnancy to get it
[1403.12 - 1407.60] out of its to get it out of that whole
[1405.36 - 1408.52] stagnant sluggish State that's causing
[1407.60 - 1410.68] your
[1408.52 - 1413.44] slow metabolism
[1410.68 - 1416.28] diagnosis our liver is a filter that
[1413.44 - 1419.04] becomes clogged over time if we don't
[1416.28 - 1422.08] give it relief you have to remember that
[1419.04 - 1424.80] our liver is a filter that becomes
[1422.08 - 1428.08] clogged over time if we don't give it
[1424.80 - 1430.72] help if we don't give it relief it clogs
[1428.08 - 1433.88] up over time think about that a little
[1430.72 - 1436.40] bit often in addition being clogged up
[1433.88 - 1438.88] with fat cells a slow sluggish stagnant
[1436.40 - 1441.04] liver is a sign that's loaded up with
[1438.88 - 1443.44] toxins and the troublemakers I kept on
[1441.04 - 1445.88] talking about earlier these can range
[1443.44 - 1448.68] from conventional detergents like I said
[1445.88 - 1451.24] colon did you ever smell cologne did it
[1448.68 - 1453.68] ever bother you did it it's one of the
[1451.24 - 1455.76] things that bothers me probably the most
[1453.68 - 1457.76] if I'm in a crowded area going through
[1455.76 - 1461.12] an airport or whatever it is the cologne
[1457.76 - 1463.08] is so thick it's so toxic it gets into
[1461.12 - 1465.28] the sinuses it sticks in there I've had
[1463.08 - 1467.80] people tell me for years how it affects
[1465.28 - 1469.92] them how it actually gets them like in
[1467.80 - 1472.44] instant migraine makes them sick makes
[1469.92 - 1473.92] them feel nauseous the amount of cologne
[1472.44 - 1475.48] the perfume that's out there because
[1473.92 - 1478.72] they're toxic they're chemical they're
[1475.48 - 1481.36] chemical agents they're not natural no
[1478.72 - 1484.96] one's wearing a natural cologne it's a
[1481.36 - 1487.80] chemical company's concoction of garbage
[1484.96 - 1490.84] to make a smell occur that for some
[1487.80 - 1492.80] reason seems to be pleasing to somebody
[1490.84 - 1495.12] but yet not pleasing to most people
[1492.80 - 1496.64] that's the irony to it all I mean I mean
[1495.12 - 1498.80] I heard you know a friend of mine who's
[1496.64 - 1500.60] a health practitioner in a different
[1498.80 - 1502.56] realm of Health the different whole
[1500.60 - 1504.32] different realm of Health it's a health
[1502.56 - 1505.84] of like chemicals and stuff like that
[1504.32 - 1507.80] all that other different stuff and said
[1505.84 - 1510.92] that the majority of people when they're
[1507.80 - 1513.40] interviewed 95 people out of 100 say
[1510.92 - 1516.44] they hate the smell of cologne then how
[1513.40 - 1520.40] is it possible everybody's wearing it if
[1516.44 - 1523.52] 95 people out of a 100 hate the smell of
[1520.40 - 1525.32] cologne then then how is it happening
[1523.52 - 1527.88] I'm there's some of these things there's
[1525.32 - 1529.64] it's a mystery it's a total mystery
[1527.88 - 1531.40] perfumes the same thing there there
[1529.64 - 1533.48] there's so many toxic varieties of
[1531.40 - 1535.72] perfumes and they really affect
[1533.48 - 1538.08] sensitive people you know I don't get
[1535.72 - 1539.88] affected by Perfume so much but colog
[1538.08 - 1541.12] definitely bother me it's the craziest
[1539.88 - 1543.28] thing but I've seen people where they
[1541.12 - 1545.00] can't handle any of it and then you got
[1543.28 - 1546.68] the gasoline fumes like I talk about
[1545.00 - 1549.92] when you're pumping gas air fresheners
[1546.68 - 1551.88] air fresheners that's a really bad one
[1549.92 - 1554.72] the chemical companies the oil the
[1551.88 - 1557.20] vaporized air fresheners the fake
[1554.72 - 1560.08] candles the fake candles it's not
[1557.20 - 1562.16] essential oils in the candles candles
[1560.08 - 1564.48] when you burn them these are chemical
[1562.16 - 1567.16] company Delights these literally
[1564.48 - 1569.64] intoxicate us I mean we're talking about
[1567.16 - 1572.08] they break down our immune system when
[1569.64 - 1575.60] you're burning candles that aren't
[1572.08 - 1578.00] natural like essential oils and the wax
[1575.60 - 1580.64] isn't you know it's not like a natural
[1578.00 - 1582.20] wax or a soy wax or something like that
[1580.64 - 1584.88] where you know whatever it is and it's
[1582.20 - 1587.92] just straight chemicals that's really
[1584.88 - 1589.28] bad with those candles so many people
[1587.92 - 1591.44] what happens is if you're burning
[1589.28 - 1594.20] candles for 30 years in your life and
[1591.44 - 1596.28] breathing that in you can develop
[1594.20 - 1599.08] conditions and diseases and problems
[1596.28 - 1601.92] because it'll feed pathogens pathogens
[1599.08 - 1603.76] inside the body lower the immune system
[1601.92 - 1606.12] it could really hurt you it's it's just
[1603.76 - 1608.52] as bad as smoking I mean if you're
[1606.12 - 1611.72] anti-smoking cigarettes and you think
[1608.52 - 1613.40] cigarettes are bad for you just think
[1611.72 - 1615.48] about you know just think about the air
[1613.40 - 1617.24] fresheners trust me think about the air
[1615.48 - 1620.36] fresheners think about those and the
[1617.24 - 1622.76] candle whole another game
[1620.36 - 1624.56] Pharmaceuticals also get trapped inside
[1622.76 - 1626.60] her liver they sit inside her liver
[1624.56 - 1628.56] these Pharmaceuticals bacteria and
[1626.60 - 1629.96] viruses sit inside our livers forever
[1628.56 - 1631.96] where do you think hepatitis C comes
[1629.96 - 1633.56] from it's from just a low-grade Epstein
[1631.96 - 1635.64] bar virus from be from when you're
[1633.56 - 1637.16] younger and it sits in there percolating
[1635.64 - 1639.12] causing scar tissue by the time you're
[1637.16 - 1640.52] 60 years old then the doctor sees you
[1639.12 - 1641.88] got a little bit of inflammation in the
[1640.52 - 1643.64] liver with a little bit of scar tissue
[1641.88 - 1645.36] and he deems it hepatitis C he doesn't
[1643.64 - 1647.68] even know that he doesn't even know the
[1645.36 - 1650.04] hepatitis C virus or she doesn't even
[1647.68 - 1652.28] though the hepatitis C virus is just an
[1650.04 - 1654.64] EBV virus that's been in there forever
[1652.28 - 1657.00] they never found or singled out a Heep C
[1654.64 - 1660.48] virus by the way it's never been singled
[1657.00 - 1663.16] out under the microscope ever in history
[1660.48 - 1666.00] they singled out the Epstein bar virus
[1663.16 - 1669.36] they never singled out a hepatitis C
[1666.00 - 1672.60] virus isn't it interesting it doesn't
[1669.36 - 1674.36] exist but yet it does there is a viral
[1672.60 - 1676.32] condition that's sitting inside the
[1674.36 - 1678.44] liver and that's what's happening
[1676.32 - 1681.44] there's over 60 varieties of Epstein bar
[1678.44 - 1682.84] virus over 60 varieties many of them sit
[1681.44 - 1686.40] inside the liver some of them cause
[1682.84 - 1688.84] hepatitis B hepatitis C they cause
[1686.40 - 1691.20] conditions inside the liver Scar Tissue
[1688.84 - 1695.36] over time from viral inflammation
[1691.20 - 1696.92] feeding off of scented candles the new
[1695.36 - 1700.00] air fresheners that we're dealing with
[1696.92 - 1702.60] to this day to colog and perfumes to
[1700.00 - 1704.76] makeups that are really toxic to toxic
[1702.60 - 1707.56] heavy metals to you know all these
[1704.76 - 1709.28] detergents to solvents to pesticides
[1707.56 - 1711.08] herbicides they get clogged inside the
[1709.28 - 1714.36] liver the liver loses its ability to
[1711.08 - 1716.20] function at its Optimum level celery
[1714.36 - 1717.48] juice helps this but it's not just
[1716.20 - 1719.20] celery juice you want to get on the
[1717.48 - 1721.88] medical medium you want to get on the
[1719.20 - 1723.88] medical medium um the heavy metal detox
[1721.88 - 1726.16] smoothie you want to get the heavy metal
[1723.88 - 1728.72] detox smoothie you want you want to get
[1726.16 - 1730.96] on that vimergy spirina the vimergy
[1728.72 - 1733.56] barley crash juice powder you want that
[1730.96 - 1735.36] vimergy right inside the Smoothie you
[1733.56 - 1737.52] make the heavy metal detox smoothie with
[1735.36 - 1739.24] the wild blueberries I use the the
[1737.52 - 1740.88] Wyman's ones you can get another wild
[1739.24 - 1743.00] blueberry if you want you just put the
[1740.88 - 1745.76] Frozen wild blueberries in that smoothie
[1743.00 - 1747.28] you blend it up I mean that's what I do
[1745.76 - 1748.84] to get the metals out because you're
[1747.28 - 1750.72] exposed to Metals we're all exposed to
[1748.84 - 1752.88] Metals no matter what we're doing where
[1750.72 - 1755.40] we are you want to get them out of the
[1752.88 - 1759.12] liver because over time they feed
[1755.40 - 1763.24] viruses that create liver issues down
[1759.12 - 1765.40] the road and never mind slow metabolism
[1763.24 - 1767.00] you get that liver too bad and too beat
[1765.40 - 1768.36] up and too problematic you're going to
[1767.00 - 1769.76] have a lot more problems in slow
[1768.36 - 1771.40] metabolism and a little bit of weight
[1769.76 - 1773.68] gain you could have a lot more issues
[1771.40 - 1775.44] like people have some serious eczema
[1773.68 - 1777.52] psoriasis all kinds of different
[1775.44 - 1780.52] conditions people have acne acne is a
[1777.52 - 1782.28] liver related issue it's stripto coctus
[1780.52 - 1784.76] inside the liver and lymphatic system
[1782.28 - 1786.52] that's what acne is and you know it's
[1784.76 - 1788.00] it's actually unbelievable how people
[1786.52 - 1789.76] don't realize what they act they still
[1788.00 - 1791.92] don't know what's causing their
[1789.76 - 1793.28] acne they don't because there's no
[1791.92 - 1795.96] information science of research doesn't
[1793.28 - 1798.20] know anything I think it's set up like
[1795.96 - 1799.64] that on purpose to be honest listen you
[1798.20 - 1802.20] should read the liver book you should
[1799.64 - 1804.28] read Liver Rescue so you actually can
[1802.20 - 1805.64] see the difference meaning learn and
[1804.28 - 1808.64] then see the difference in the results
[1805.64 - 1811.28] when you do the 369 cleanse the liver
[1808.64 - 1813.68] rescue 369 cleanse and you actually
[1811.28 - 1815.68] start getting your liver back and then
[1813.68 - 1817.64] you start getting better there's a big
[1815.68 - 1820.24] difference that happens there's
[1817.64 - 1822.56] something in celery juice I call sodium
[1820.24 - 1823.84] cluster salts I know some of you guys
[1822.56 - 1826.80] already heard about that cuz you got the
[1823.84 - 1829.80] celery juice book um the medical medium
[1826.80 - 1833.20] celery juice book and the sodium cluster
[1829.80 - 1835.76] salts that's a powerful powerful um
[1833.20 - 1839.92] phytochemical compound basically what it
[1835.76 - 1842.24] does is it helps dissolve poisons that
[1839.92 - 1844.76] are trapped it helps to disperse them
[1842.24 - 1847.52] out of fat cells it helps to break down
[1844.76 - 1849.36] fat cells it helps to get these toxins
[1847.52 - 1852.00] these solvents these pesticides these
[1849.36 - 1854.56] toxic heavy metals loosened up it helps
[1852.00 - 1857.36] to bind on to debris that's caused by
[1854.56 - 1859.08] viruses viruses that create debris
[1857.36 - 1860.32] byproduct I just want to tell you a
[1859.08 - 1861.92] little bit about something about that
[1860.32 - 1863.68] byproduct thing so it's important to you
[1861.92 - 1866.68] know you guys hear about like
[1863.68 - 1868.56] methylation issues like mt hfrg mutation
[1866.68 - 1870.64] you hear about that you hear about other
[1868.56 - 1873.88] things too and you know then you got
[1870.64 - 1875.68] Lyme disease you got um you got bofilm
[1873.88 - 1877.04] you hear about that out there right I
[1875.68 - 1879.16] mean I'm sure you guys are listening to
[1877.04 - 1881.88] all kinds of stuff out there and or
[1879.16 - 1884.52] reading stuff out there but all that's
[1881.88 - 1886.60] caused by viral byproduct and none of
[1884.52 - 1888.84] those sources none of those sources or
[1886.60 - 1891.00] studies or or practitioners or people on
[1888.84 - 1895.04] the circuit even know about any of this
[1891.00 - 1899.48] viral byproduct from Epstein bar hhv6
[1895.04 - 1903.28] hhv7 shingles cyeg virus viral by from
[1899.48 - 1905.28] Simplex one Simplex 2 viral byproduct
[1903.28 - 1909.60] produced by these viruses inside of all
[1905.28 - 1911.84] of us okay that's what causes all of
[1909.60 - 1914.44] that that's what causes C reactive
[1911.84 - 1917.20] protein test Elevate Ana anti-nuclear
[1914.44 - 1920.20] antigen test that's what elevates the
[1917.20 - 1923.24] inflammatory tests MTHFR gene mutation
[1920.20 - 1925.84] tests that's what actually inflames
[1923.24 - 1928.08] everything okay that's homosysteine goes
[1925.84 - 1931.20] up that's the whole point it's from
[1928.08 - 1932.72] viral byproduct inside people's bodies
[1931.20 - 1933.84] that's Advanced information you're only
[1932.72 - 1936.52] going to get here from the medical
[1933.84 - 1939.04] medium from medical medium radio show
[1936.52 - 1940.68] and from the books and that's that's the
[1939.04 - 1942.08] whole thing you don't want those viral
[1940.68 - 1944.16] loads
[1942.08 - 1946.72] increasing and when they increase and
[1944.16 - 1949.24] produce all this viral byproduct you get
[1946.72 - 1952.36] slower metabolism meaning it could get
[1949.24 - 1953.44] diagnosed or seen from the outside by
[1952.36 - 1955.04] somebody who doesn't know what they're
[1953.44 - 1957.36] talking about about health a
[1955.04 - 1959.20] professional that sees it as like a
[1957.36 - 1961.24] dietitian that sees it as slow
[1959.20 - 1962.88] metabolism meanwhile you're building up
[1961.24 - 1964.84] viral byproduct your liver is getting
[1962.88 - 1967.44] sicker your weight's coming on you're
[1964.84 - 1971.28] getting different symptoms through life
[1967.44 - 1974.00] the liver becomes a nesting place for
[1971.28 - 1977.04] this these troublemakers and these
[1974.00 - 1979.56] viruses these toxins and poisons they
[1977.04 - 1982.24] they feed the bugs inside the body the
[1979.56 - 1984.32] liver becomes this nesting Place celery
[1982.24 - 1986.76] juices sodium cluster salts have these
[1984.32 - 1989.04] chemical compounds that bind on to viral
[1986.76 - 1991.80] debris and viral byproduct and help
[1989.04 - 1994.00] Purge the liver this is so important
[1991.80 - 1995.96] this strengthens and awakens the liver's
[1994.00 - 1998.52] ability to operate at its best and
[1995.96 - 2000.32] perform over 2,000 chemical functions
[1998.52 - 2002.84] that are undiscovered by research and
[2000.32 - 2005.64] science think about that research and
[2002.84 - 2008.80] science has even tapped into a a little
[2005.64 - 2011.28] bit of what the liver does how it works
[2008.80 - 2013.96] that's how it works sodium cluster salts
[2011.28 - 2015.80] strip the membrane of pathogens down it
[2013.96 - 2018.16] strips the outer membrane of the cell
[2015.80 - 2020.40] the viral cell that keeps the thing
[2018.16 - 2023.24] strong it keeps the virus strong it
[2020.40 - 2025.64] strips it down it breaks it down and
[2023.24 - 2028.20] then you know that's how it kills these
[2025.64 - 2030.04] bugs you know and also celery juice
[2028.20 - 2033.00] breaks down and helps dissolve the fat
[2030.04 - 2037.16] cells that are stored inside the liver
[2033.00 - 2038.72] so we can pee those fat cells out I was
[2037.16 - 2040.84] on the Instagram live recently and I
[2038.72 - 2043.08] said piss the fat cells out I probably
[2040.84 - 2046.04] shouldn't have said that but it's peeing
[2043.08 - 2048.52] the fat cells out okay you know the
[2046.04 - 2050.60] bottom line is celery juice is loaded
[2048.52 - 2052.76] with vitamins and minerals that
[2050.60 - 2055.60] strengthen and feed the liver making it
[2052.76 - 2058.12] less stagnant too feeding it are you
[2055.60 - 2060.16] feeding your liver the heavy metal detox
[2058.12 - 2061.68] smoothie feeds it the medical medium
[2060.16 - 2063.96] heavy metal detox smoothie feeds the
[2061.68 - 2065.92] liver and you know you do the 28-day
[2063.96 - 2069.32] cleanse in the medical medium book one
[2065.92 - 2071.20] powerful it save lives long before I
[2069.32 - 2073.68] published it long before it was
[2071.20 - 2076.56] published the 28 day cleanse brought
[2073.68 - 2079.08] people's lives back decades before that
[2076.56 - 2081.16] book was even
[2079.08 - 2083.20] published okay so that's the power of
[2081.16 - 2085.12] these things the the 369 and The Liver
[2083.20 - 2088.52] Rescue book and The Liver Rescue
[2085.12 - 2090.24] smoothie bring the liver back I mean if
[2088.52 - 2092.40] you don't have all the medical medium
[2090.24 - 2094.56] series books get them all if you can't
[2092.40 - 2097.12] afford the book that mean some of them
[2094.56 - 2100.20] are like $10 $9 I saw that uh celery
[2097.12 - 2102.00] juice was like $9 or something on Amazon
[2100.20 - 2103.88] I know they're in Costco and Target if
[2102.00 - 2105.48] you can't afford the book go to the
[2103.88 - 2107.16] library take out the whole medical
[2105.48 - 2109.20] medium series and start getting your

[2117.92 - 2123.36] godsend it really does help but then
[2121.16 - 2125.84] when it's unwanted weight
[2123.36 - 2129.12] loss unwanted weight loss when you're
[2125.84 - 2132.40] losing weight when you don't want to
[2129.12 - 2134.92] celery juice does the opposite there it
[2132.40 - 2137.16] stabilizes the mineral salts bring the
[2134.92 - 2139.40] liver back because that's still a liver
[2137.16 - 2142.96] issue that's still a liver problem and
[2139.40 - 2143.80] it's still an adrenal problem if you're
[2142.96 - 2145.92] really
[2143.80 - 2148.40] underweight and you don't want to lose
[2145.92 - 2151.08] any more weight celery juice can help
[2148.40 - 2153.44] you because it assists in that
[2151.08 - 2156.48] circumstance too whether you're trying

[2162.80 - 2168.24] right well I got to eat you know
[2164.44 - 2170.56] balanced diet I got to be balanced I got
[2168.24 - 2173.68] to live more of a balanced life that
[2170.56 - 2176.12] word is overused out there or it's used
[2173.68 - 2178.72] all the time regardless and that's what
[2176.12 - 2182.08] celery juice actually really does it
[2178.72 - 2184.84] really does balance things it keeps
[2182.08 - 2187.16] things stable stabilizes I love when
[2184.84 - 2188.84] something really does work it's another
[2187.16 - 2190.48] thing to say the word with all these
[2188.84 - 2192.64] so-called balanced diets that aren't
[2190.48 - 2194.44] balanced you know and all these balanced
[2192.64 - 2195.72] Lifestyles that aren't balanced at all
[2194.44 - 2198.04] that aren't balanced at all like eating
[2195.72 - 2200.64] chocolate all day like eating chocolate
[2198.04 - 2202.04] all day and coffee all day you know and
[2200.64 - 2203.76] and and eating one meal a day and
[2202.04 - 2205.08] thinking you're balanced or whatever it
[2203.76 - 2206.20] is all these different balanced diets
[2205.08 - 2208.52] that are developing left and right are
[2206.20 - 2210.88] eating way too much way too much protein
[2208.52 - 2212.76] and fat thinking it's balanced or the
[2210.88 - 2214.40] whole moderation thing everything in
[2212.76 - 2216.24] moderation and moderation that's just
[2214.40 - 2217.52] unbelievable it's ridiculous it really
[2216.24 - 2219.72] is ridiculous ridiculous I have to be
[2217.52 - 2221.64] honest you guys but celery juice
[2219.72 - 2224.00] actually does balance things I love when
[2221.64 - 2227.20] something actually is it's real and not
[2224.00 - 2229.24] just talk it's not just all talk you
[2227.20 - 2231.36] know it's critical to know that celery
[2229.24 - 2233.08] juice also is not a meal replacement
[2231.36 - 2235.68] it's not a meal replacement it's a
[2233.08 - 2237.28] medicine it's a medicine it's not a meal
[2235.68 - 2239.44] replacement especially if you're
[2237.28 - 2241.52] underweight if you're underweight it's a
[2239.44 - 2242.56] medicine so you can actually get to a
[2241.52 - 2244.88] point where you're not going to be
[2242.56 - 2247.68] underweight anymore meaning what it does
[2244.88 - 2249.84] is it fixes the liver it fixes the the
[2247.68 - 2251.72] endocrine system it fixes the liver the
[2249.84 - 2254.08] endocrine system the
[2251.72 - 2256.32] adrenals it it actually gets rid of
[2254.08 - 2257.72] viruses that are keeping you underweight
[2256.32 - 2259.64] because that's the whole thing what
[2257.72 - 2261.84] people don't realize who are underweight
[2259.64 - 2265.08] and they can't put weight on they're
[2261.84 - 2268.20] dealing with a viral load too viruses
[2265.08 - 2271.36] produce what what happens is viruses
[2268.20 - 2273.28] stimulate adrenaline production that's
[2271.36 - 2274.92] what they do there's certain varieties
[2273.28 - 2277.84] of Epstein bar out of the 60 varieties
[2274.92 - 2280.80] of Epstein bar that stimulate adrenaline
[2277.84 - 2282.80] production keeping you underweight but
[2280.80 - 2284.72] the one thing I've learned about people
[2282.80 - 2286.84] who are viral and they're underweight
[2284.72 - 2289.52] for a portion of their life eventually
[2286.84 - 2292.24] their liver just just craps out the
[2289.52 - 2294.44] other Direction and their liver becomes
[2292.24 - 2296.36] stagnant and sluggish really heavily the
[2294.44 - 2298.20] adrenals get tired and they gain weight
[2296.36 - 2300.32] and now they deal with a weight problem
[2298.20 - 2301.84] later on anybody who's living
[2300.32 - 2303.16] underweight where they got this
[2301.84 - 2305.36] underweight problem and it's underweight
[2303.16 - 2307.20] too it's for years and that person's
[2305.36 - 2308.68] been just they can't keep waiting on it
[2307.20 - 2309.96] changes and they end up with too much
[2308.68 - 2312.84] weight on them and they're on the flip
[2309.96 - 2315.24] side that always happens celeres can
[2312.84 - 2318.08] help prevent that too from happening to
[2315.24 - 2319.92] them you can't rely on celery juice as a
[2318.08 - 2321.80] calorie Source though always remember
[2319.92 - 2323.52] that don't skip a morning meal like a
[2321.80 - 2325.24] fruit smoothie or the heavy metal detox
[2323.52 - 2327.24] smoothie or any of the recipes in the
[2325.24 - 2330.12] medical medium series books or you know
[2327.24 - 2331.52] don't skip those just because you know
[2330.12 - 2335.20] you think it's a meal
[2331.52 - 2338.92] replacement it's not so always know that
[2335.20 - 2340.92] have both the celery juice 15 20 minutes
[2338.92 - 2342.64] later enjoy your breakfast after celery
[2340.92 - 2344.72] juice 15 to 20 minutes a half an hour
[2342.64 - 2346.36] later enjoy your breakfast I like I
[2344.72 - 2348.28] personally I like anywhere from 20
[2346.36 - 2351.12] minutes to 30 minutes I like 30 minutes
[2348.28 - 2354.28] A Lot the reason celery juice helps with
[2351.12 - 2357.08] both unwanted weight and unwanted weight
[2354.28 - 2360.12] loss is because they both stem from the
[2357.08 - 2364.20] struggling liver with the viral issues
[2360.12 - 2365.72] unwanted mystery weight loss is usually
[2364.20 - 2367.60] a result of the low grade viral
[2365.72 - 2369.72] infection like I said the Epstein bar
[2367.60 - 2372.64] inside the liver setting off the body's
[2369.72 - 2374.44] alarm system essentially creating an
[2372.64 - 2376.24] allergic reaction that prompts the
[2374.44 - 2377.96] adrenals to release consistently high
[2376.24 - 2381.92] levels of adrenaline like I was just
[2377.96 - 2383.96] saying earlier the adrenaline acts as an
[2381.92 - 2385.88] amphetamine and that's what happens but
[2383.96 - 2387.88] the unwant The Unwanted weight loss I
[2385.88 - 2389.80] talk about just doesn't last forever
[2387.88 - 2392.84] like I was saying earlier eventually
[2389.80 - 2394.12] liver becomes tired sluggish exhausted
[2392.84 - 2396.72] and then you know the high fat high
[2394.12 - 2398.60] protein diet all that you know going in
[2396.72 - 2400.64] there you know Mass amounts of
[2398.60 - 2402.32] adrenaline saturating inside the liver
[2400.64 - 2404.24] long term because of the low-grade viral
[2402.32 - 2405.72] infection that doctors can't pick off
[2404.24 - 2407.64] that no practitioners can't pick off
[2405.72 - 2410.04] that nobody sees because I try to get
[2407.64 - 2411.80] every Everybody the inside information
[2410.04 - 2414.52] about their body so they can be ahead of
[2411.80 - 2417.28] everything in everyone and when people
[2414.52 - 2420.52] start to gain weight instead it can
[2417.28 - 2422.72] happen 10 years later 5 years later 4
[2420.52 - 2423.84] years later it can happen 15 years later
[2422.72 - 2426.16] that's how it
[2423.84 - 2428.28] works but celeries use helps out with
[2426.16 - 2431.24] all the viral situations that create
[2428.28 - 2433.52] unwanted weight loss and unwanted weight
[2431.24 - 2435.24] gain because the sodium cluster salts I
[2433.52 - 2437.40] was talking about those chemical
[2435.24 - 2439.72] compounds enter the liver's hepatic
[2437.40 - 2442.48] portal vein and break down viral cell
[2439.72 - 2444.72] membranes which weakens and reduces the
[2442.48 - 2446.48] viral load you want to weaken the viral
[2444.72 - 2450.92] load you want to reduce it you want to
[2446.48 - 2453.12] break it down celery juices compounds
[2450.92 - 2456.32] also grab onto toxins such as heavy
[2453.12 - 2458.12] metals pesticides herbicides fungicides
[2456.32 - 2460.68] solvents that feed viruses and pull them
[2458.12 - 2462.72] out of the liver celery juices compounds
[2460.68 - 2465.76] flow through the rest of the bloodstream
[2462.72 - 2468.84] collecting and disengaging viral toxins
[2465.76 - 2471.40] that are hot I call them hot because
[2468.84 - 2474.04] they're bad they're they're charged
[2471.40 - 2477.24] they're hot charged they actually have a
[2474.04 - 2479.72] frequency they float around in the body
[2477.24 - 2482.36] and what happens is you can
[2479.72 - 2485.76] disengage that frequency you can
[2482.36 - 2487.80] disengage those toxins these are unseen
[2485.76 - 2489.52] allergic reactions that trigger adrenals
[2487.80 - 2491.28] too we have all these poisons and toxins
[2489.52 - 2493.92] floating around in our body triggering
[2491.28 - 2496.40] off the adrenal adrenals and we're just
[2493.92 - 2498.32] adrenalin flying everywhere people with
[2496.40 - 2500.40] mystery weight weight loss have a higher
[2498.32 - 2502.56] heart rate too because of this allergic
[2500.40 - 2504.76] reaction of all these poisons and toxins
[2502.56 - 2507.64] floating around the bloodstream and you
[2504.76 - 2508.84] can have that same thing with weight
[2507.64 - 2511.36] with weight gain when you're having
[2508.84 - 2514.04] weight gain too you can have the same
[2511.36 - 2516.76] you know the same toxins floating around
[2514.04 - 2518.28] acting as an allergic reaction mild low
[2516.76 - 2520.68] grade allergic reaction triggering
[2518.28 - 2522.68] prompting the adrenals to release
[2520.68 - 2524.72] adrenaline and this is left over
[2522.68 - 2527.20] adrenaline surging through the body due
[2524.72 - 2529.84] to this allergic reaction from a viral
[2527.20 - 2532.24] load viruses produce poisons and toxins
[2529.84 - 2534.84] by feeding off of poisons and toxins
[2532.24 - 2537.16] these are toxic to our body they float
[2534.84 - 2540.44] around they create low-grade allergic
[2537.16 - 2542.32] reactions prompting adrenaline to flood
[2540.44 - 2544.08] it's Advanced information I mean listen
[2542.32 - 2546.28] to this show again cuz you know this
[2544.08 - 2548.24] this Advanced information and it's good
[2546.28 - 2551.12] to kind of just you know hear it once
[2548.24 - 2553.20] hear it a couple times this whole radio
[2551.12 - 2555.44] show I've been sharing information from
[2553.20 - 2557.24] the medical medium celer juice book
[2555.44 - 2559.80] that's how packed it is and I haven't
[2557.24 - 2561.84] even scratched the surface the book's
[2559.80 - 2563.32] packed with information about gaining
[2561.84 - 2564.76] weight what happens when people gain
[2563.32 - 2567.72] weight why what's happening in their
[2564.76 - 2569.36] liver to you know unwanted weight loss
[2567.72 - 2570.96] all of it but it's not just that I talk
[2569.36 - 2573.24] about metabolism I talk about all kinds
[2570.96 - 2575.16] of different symptoms and conditions
[2573.24 - 2576.56] that everybody's walking around with in
[2575.16 - 2578.52] the celery juice book it's it's that
[2576.56 - 2581.00] packed with information I talk about
[2578.52 - 2583.88] what the celery juice does with for our
[2581.00 - 2585.68] liver and and reversing these conditions
[2583.88 - 2588.04] so what I've been doing is giving you
[2585.68 - 2591.00] information right out of medical medium
[2588.04 - 2593.00] celery juice book is what I'm doing and
[2591.00 - 2594.80] because there's that much to share I
[2593.00 - 2597.28] can't even scratch the surface of it
[2594.80 - 2599.20] it's not even possible and so the whole
[2597.28 - 2601.72] thing with with metabolism you know
[2599.20 - 2604.64] that's a big topic all on its own and
[2601.72 - 2606.36] it's important to learn about it because
[2604.64 - 2609.36] what happens is you're going to be told
[2606.36 - 2611.96] one day regardless that your metabolism
[2609.36 - 2614.32] isn't right you're going to be one day
[2611.96 - 2616.40] you're going to be 32 years old you're
[2614.32 - 2617.88] going to be dealing with you know at the
[2616.40 - 2619.88] gym wondering why you can't get weight
[2617.88 - 2622.48] off why a trainer is going to be telling
[2619.88 - 2625.08] you that it's your metabolism or you're
[2622.48 - 2627.16] going to be 20 years old and sick and
[2625.08 - 2629.04] fatigued and some doctors's going to say
[2627.16 - 2631.16] you have a slow metabolism or you're
[2629.04 - 2633.04] going to be 45 years old and some
[2631.16 - 2635.08] doctors going to say you got you you got
[2633.04 - 2636.60] menopause and you have a slow metabolism
[2635.08 - 2638.48] that's why you're gaining weight
[2636.60 - 2640.48] whatever it is you're going to be told
[2638.48 - 2642.72] you got a bad metabolism one way or
[2640.48 - 2645.08] another along the way you may as well
[2642.72 - 2647.32] get familiar with how to defend yourself
[2645.08 - 2649.32] see we defend ourselves in all kinds of
[2647.32 - 2652.08] different ways in life right you've
[2649.32 - 2654.08] defended yourself right haven't you with
[2652.08 - 2656.20] different things like different things
[2654.08 - 2657.88] you felt weren't just or you felt you're
[2656.20 - 2659.76] being called out on when you have
[2657.88 - 2662.08] then because you weren't doing anything
[2659.76 - 2664.48] wrong I mean did you ever have that in
[2662.08 - 2667.48] life in a relationship or a work
[2664.48 - 2670.36] relationship or just a stranger or
[2667.48 - 2672.72] whatever it is you know what I mean but
[2670.36 - 2674.80] we're not allowed to defend ourselves
[2672.72 - 2677.00] with illness with chronic illness like
[2674.80 - 2679.96] we're we're supposed to be sick and have
[2677.00 - 2682.36] to just obey obey these grandfathered
[2679.96 - 2685.84] laws that are set to just ruin our lives
[2682.36 - 2690.40] along the way your life is precious
[2685.84 - 2693.04] right okay Precious these are your years
[2690.40 - 2695.60] right here these are your days these are
[2693.04 - 2696.60] your months these are the years of your
[2695.60 - 2700.40] life
[2696.60 - 2703.48] you want it taken over by BS like the
[2700.40 - 2705.12] metabolism theory that it's responsible
[2703.48 - 2707.52] for all these things going on in your
[2705.12 - 2709.04] health do you want it taken over by that
[2707.52 - 2711.08] that's the same thing like the protein
[2709.04 - 2712.96] thing I talk about all the time the
[2711.08 - 2715.00] whole thing with protein where protein
[2712.96 - 2716.44] is God are you getting enough protein
[2715.00 - 2717.72] it's all about protein every diet's
[2716.44 - 2718.92] about protein meanwhile everybody's
[2717.72 - 2721.72] getting plenty of protein but why is
[2718.92 - 2725.16] everybody still sick if you want to be
[2721.72 - 2727.20] if you want your lives eaten up by these
[2725.16 - 2730.16] monsters
[2727.20 - 2733.04] then go ahead but if you don't want your
[2730.16 - 2736.04] lives eaten up and your days wasted and
[2733.04 - 2739.20] your time Wast it if you don't want them
[2736.04 - 2741.92] eaten up you can defend yourself for the
[2739.20 - 2745.48] first time when it comes down in the
[2741.92 - 2747.36] medicine field in the world all of that
[2745.48 - 2750.72] and I don't care if you're the smartest
[2747.36 - 2752.52] cat on the planet where you're so smart
[2750.72 - 2754.20] where you're into you know the these
[2752.52 - 2756.16] crazy foods from the Amazon and you're
[2754.20 - 2757.40] totally smart on everything and you
[2756.16 - 2758.44] think you know everything about keto
[2757.40 - 2760.00] diets you think you know everything
[2758.44 - 2762.44] about every diet in the book and all
[2760.00 - 2764.88] this stuff and you think medical media
[2762.44 - 2767.24] my he hear a voice and that's just too
[2764.88 - 2768.52] whatever that's just not not information
[2767.24 - 2769.92] that's peer-reviewed and studied or
[2768.52 - 2771.84] whatever it is you might be the smartest
[2769.92 - 2773.76] cat you think but you're still going to
[2771.84 - 2776.04] be a sucker to the
[2773.76 - 2777.92] metabolism law you're going to be a
[2776.04 - 2779.92] sucker to the protein law you're going
[2777.92 - 2781.84] to be a sucker to Conventional medicine
[2779.92 - 2782.72] big Pharma and all these other ways and
[2781.84 - 2785.36] you're not you're not going to be able
[2782.72 - 2786.92] to defend yourself you may as well learn
[2785.36 - 2789.20] how to
[2786.92 - 2791.44] and start really taking control over
[2789.20 - 2792.92] your life what's control over your life
[2791.44 - 2794.20] if you can't really take control over
[2792.92 - 2795.96] your life I don't understand is there
[2794.20 - 2797.76] fake control over your life because
[2795.96 - 2800.20] that's what people do they're taking
[2797.76 - 2803.16] fake control over your life over their
[2800.20 - 2805.56] lives it's amazing what about real
[2803.16 - 2809.44] having real choices being able to make
[2805.56 - 2812.92] choices and say hey I hey it's not a
[2809.44 - 2816.40] metabolism issue I'm sorry but it's not
[2812.92 - 2818.88] it's actually my liver needing help my
[2816.40 - 2821.32] liver needing care it needs to be
[2818.88 - 2825.08] cleaned up my lymphatic system needs to
[2821.32 - 2826.88] be cleaned up it's not because I'm aging
[2825.08 - 2828.80] it's not because I'm just somebody with
[2826.88 - 2831.44] a genetic thing where I'm born born with
[2828.80 - 2833.92] a genetic issue and slow metabolism you
[2831.44 - 2835.24] got to put your hand up and say no no
[2833.92 - 2837.96] I'm not going to get suckered into this
[2835.24 - 2839.84] one I'm here to give you the truth so
[2837.96 - 2843.16] you can protect yourself and make your
[2839.84 - 2845.36] own decisions for you and your family
[2843.16 - 2847.56] that's what I'm here for that's the
[2845.36 - 2849.32] whole point point and you know I'm never
[2847.56 - 2851.04] going to stop doing that I'm always
[2849.32 - 2852.52] going to give you that information so I
[2851.04 - 2854.00] put the books out like the medical
[2852.52 - 2855.32] medium celery juice book you know
[2854.00 - 2858.52] someone said to me the other day they
[2855.32 - 2861.04] said I said Anthony I said what and they
[2858.52 - 2862.68] said you know so what you wrote a book
[2861.04 - 2864.60] about celery juice what is it like a few
[2862.68 - 2866.28] celery juice recipes or something silly
[2864.60 - 2868.24] like that and drink some celery juice I
[2866.28 - 2870.44] said are you kidding me I said are you
[2868.24 - 2872.60] joking I said do you know what's in that
[2870.44 - 2874.52] book and they go no and I go of course
[2872.60 - 2876.12] you don't know you didn't read it I go
[2874.52 - 2878.64] read that book the person went and they
[2876.12 - 2880.16] took a book and they read it and they
[2878.64 - 2881.92] said they never read anything like it in
[2880.16 - 2884.20] their in their life they couldn't
[2881.92 - 2886.12] believe it had almost 200 different
[2884.20 - 2888.16] symptoms and conditions explained to how
[2886.12 - 2891.36] we get sick and how celery juice can
[2888.16 - 2893.96] help heal it they were blown out of
[2891.36 - 2895.80] their mind their minds just were blown
[2893.96 - 2897.72] they they the person shared it with two
[2895.80 - 2900.12] other people already and they were just
[2897.72 - 2901.76] mind blown they didn't know there's so
[2900.12 - 2903.64] much information about what celery juice
[2901.76 - 2905.12] does and what it has inside of it and
[2903.64 - 2907.56] what it can do for you and how it can
[2905.12 - 2910.40] literally change your world around if
[2907.56 - 2911.80] you do it right and take the direction
[2910.40 - 2914.48] right to do
[2911.80 - 2916.76] so and you so it's so you just have to
[2914.48 - 2919.72] realize it's about you your health your
[2916.76 - 2921.24] family your friends the people you love
[2919.72 - 2922.84] it's about the people that matter it's
[2921.24 - 2925.68] about your life that matters does your
[2922.84 - 2929.84] life matter does it matter at all does
[2925.68 - 2932.56] it you know right it has to right it
[2929.84 - 2934.08] matters to me it matters to me I had
[2932.56 - 2935.32] someone tell me years ago said you know
[2934.08 - 2937.00] my life doesn't even matter it doesn't
[2935.32 - 2939.68] even matter I don't even care anymore I
[2937.00 - 2942.32] said you know I do I said I care and it
[2939.68 - 2943.84] matters to me your life matters to me
[2942.32 - 2944.96] and they said you know what you know
[2943.84 - 2948.76] what it turned their life around when
[2944.96 - 2952.36] they heard that because they realized
[2948.76 - 2953.96] that if it mattered to me in every way I
[2952.36 - 2955.96] wanted that person better I wanted them
[2953.96 - 2958.44] recovered I wanted them moving forward
[2955.96 - 2960.24] their life was important and they said
[2958.44 - 2962.52] you know what that changed your life and
[2960.24 - 2964.28] they started applying the information
[2962.52 - 2966.88] they recovered themselves from multiple
[2964.28 - 2968.84] sclerosis that's what they did and
[2966.88 - 2971.00] they're still better today and here now
[2968.84 - 2974.64] because of it this was years ago years
[2971.00 - 2977.28] ago years ago and so it should matter to
[2974.64 - 2980.96] you to heal and so when you go back to
[2977.28 - 2983.12] the metabolism Theory it's really a sad
[2980.96 - 2986.68] situation I've seen it used there's
[2983.12 - 2988.76] hundreds of books pamphlets this and
[2986.68 - 2992.40] that about it people still talking about
[2988.76 - 2994.24] it it's literally one of those Devils
[2992.40 - 2997.32] one of those Devils one of those demons
[2994.24 - 2999.80] or something is what it is it takes over
[2997.32 - 3002.64] the mind of millions and millions of
[2999.80 - 3005.28] health professionals all around the
[3002.64 - 3007.72] globe you know that are innocent that
[3005.28 - 3010.40] don't realize it they just don't realize
[3007.72 - 3013.32] it and it takes over their Consciousness
[3010.40 - 3016.12] is what it does and it's a seed that
[3013.32 - 3018.40] makes it so they can't look further no
[3016.12 - 3020.76] one wants to look further no one wants
[3018.40 - 3023.36] to doubt science's Discovery with the
[3020.76 - 3025.20] metabolism and back to what that is what
[3023.36 - 3028.44] is it it's just a discovery that we're
[3025.20 - 3031.72] actually breathing air we're taking in
[3028.44 - 3034.60] oxygen we're taking in fuel we're going
[3031.72 - 3037.00] to bathroom that's it I'm just letting
[3034.60 - 3039.60] you know that's metabolism right there
[3037.00 - 3042.12] you're eating something you're you're
[3039.60 - 3044.96] using it as energy and you're going to
[3042.12 - 3048.20] bathroom you're breathing air which is
[3044.96 - 3050.20] oxygen we're utilizing it and that's the
[3048.20 - 3051.92] discovery basically the bottom line when
[3050.20 - 3053.92] you're dealing with eczema when you're
[3051.92 - 3055.60] dealing with edema and swelling how many
[3053.92 - 3057.32] people are dealing with edema and
[3055.60 - 3059.36] swelling they're dealing with skin
[3057.32 - 3061.96] problems like eczema psoriasis they're
[3059.36 - 3064.16] dealing with fatigue you know fibroids
[3061.96 - 3066.64] reproductive disorders re reproductive
[3064.16 - 3068.68] problems aches and pains nerve pain
[3066.64 - 3070.20] fibromyalgia which science research has
[3068.68 - 3072.76] no idea about any of these things yet
[3070.20 - 3074.80] the causes you know headaches migraines
[3072.76 - 3076.24] heart palpitations when we're dealing
[3074.80 - 3077.84] with lupus that you know with the
[3076.24 - 3079.68] diagnosis of Lupus which is still a
[3077.84 - 3081.72] mystery to research in science think
[3079.68 - 3084.64] about that right there Lyme disease
[3081.72 - 3086.88] still a mystery still a mystery you know
[3084.64 - 3088.56] methylation issues you know everything
[3086.88 - 3090.96] that people go through right now they're
[3088.56 - 3092.92] going through PCOS that one right there
[3090.96 - 3095.68] is really difficult on people and then
[3092.92 - 3097.40] the sibo diagnosis the diagnosis the the
[3095.68 - 3102.08] digestive problems and all that
[3097.40 - 3104.88] sinusitis issues vertigo tentis Vitiligo
[3102.08 - 3106.96] lyan sclerosis all of those what happens
[3104.88 - 3109.48] is the bottom line is we have all these
[3106.96 - 3112.80] different conditions and symptoms and
[3109.48 - 3114.04] and diagnoses diseases all of this stuff
[3112.80 - 3116.24] science of research is behind the
[3114.04 - 3119.20] eightball and all of it so keep to your
[3116.24 - 3121.88] celery juice keep strong do it long
[3119.20 - 3123.24] enough do it long enough and do enough
[3121.88 - 3125.60] you know when you get the celery juice
[3123.24 - 3127.84] book you'll read the dosages you need
[3125.60 - 3130.96] you try to get on 32 ounces every single
[3127.84 - 3133.44] day I got people that are on 64 ounces
[3130.96 - 3135.60] every day it's changing their life and
[3133.44 - 3137.80] turning them around but you want to make
[3135.60 - 3139.76] sure your foods are right too I'm going
[3137.80 - 3142.32] to give you some tips right here stay
[3139.76 - 3144.88] away from eggs stay stay away from milk
[3142.32 - 3146.96] cheese butter stay away from kefir stay
[3144.88 - 3148.92] away from yogurt stayed away from yogurt
[3146.96 - 3151.96] stay away from any kind of dairy
[3148.92 - 3154.08] products whatever you do stay away from
[3151.96 - 3156.32] all the dairy of course stay away from
[3154.08 - 3158.16] gluten but you want to know why to stay
[3156.32 - 3160.48] away from gluten cuz no one ever knew
[3158.16 - 3161.88] why no one ever knew why the reason you
[3160.48 - 3165.20] stay away from gluten is so you don't
[3161.88 - 3168.48] feed any bugs like strep octus causing
[3165.20 - 3171.20] acne so the whole reason behind acne is
[3168.48 - 3173.88] Strep bacteria that's behind acne it's
[3171.20 - 3176.20] strep in a sluggish liver and in the in
[3173.88 - 3179.72] a sluggish lymphatic system sitting in
[3176.20 - 3181.72] there causing cystic acne so you want to
[3179.72 - 3183.92] make sure you're doing enough of the
[3181.72 - 3185.64] celery juice you're doing you're staying
[3183.92 - 3187.64] away from the foods you should stay away
[3185.64 - 3190.52] from stay away from bacon stay away from
[3187.64 - 3192.80] pork I would even stay away from corn
[3190.52 - 3194.88] I'd stay away from soy I would stay away
[3192.80 - 3196.68] from those too and I would keep your
[3194.88 - 3200.04] animal proteins if you're into animal
[3196.68 - 3202.24] proteins lower them do them once a day
[3200.04 - 3204.20] not twice a day not three times a day if
[3202.24 - 3205.76] you're an intermittent fast faster and
[3204.20 - 3208.20] you like to do animal protein once a day
[3205.76 - 3210.04] at the end of the day do a vegetarian
[3208.20 - 3211.72] meal at the end of the day do a vegan
[3210.04 - 3214.12] meal a plant- paste meal at the end of
[3211.72 - 3215.88] the day one time and then do the animal
[3214.12 - 3217.64] protein on the other day do every other
[3215.88 - 3220.12] day you know if you're if you're
[3217.64 - 3222.68] plant-based if you're vegan lower your
[3220.12 - 3224.88] fats lower your proteins lower the nuts
[3222.68 - 3226.88] and seeds the oils the avocados don't
[3224.88 - 3229.60] have them so high all the tahini I was
[3226.88 - 3231.08] talking to a plant-based person and
[3229.60 - 3233.36] you're a really cool person you're like
[3231.08 - 3235.44] you know what I do tons of tahini I do

[3237.04 - 3241.20] salad I put 2 tablespoons of tahini in
[3239.24 - 3242.84] my salad put a little olive oil in there
[3241.20 - 3244.56] I said oh my God you got so much fat and
[3242.84 - 3246.36] you got so much protein and fat going on
[3244.56 - 3247.96] in there you shouldn't do that you
[3246.36 - 3250.28] should have a half an avocado in that
[3247.96 - 3252.08] salad and bring in some red bell peppers
