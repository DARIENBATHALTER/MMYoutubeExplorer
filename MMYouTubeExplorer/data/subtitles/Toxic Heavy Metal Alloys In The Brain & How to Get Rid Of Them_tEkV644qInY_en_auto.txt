[0.04 - 6.44] heavy metals are the
[3.00 - 9.68] rulers of Life on planet Earth toxic
[6.44 - 12.76] heavy metals get into people's brains
[9.68 - 14.24] and then Metals speak for the person I
[12.76 - 16.48] know I've said that before right you
[14.24 - 18.00] maybe may have heard that Metals talk
[16.48 - 20.64] for the
[18.00 - 24.24] person metals can make us highly
[20.64 - 25.64] emotional highly sensitive metals can
[24.24 - 28.60] make us so
[25.64 - 31.08] depressed suicidal that's what metals
[28.60 - 32.64] can do no one would ever no no one would
[31.08 - 34.72] ever know you're living your life you're
[32.64 - 36.44] going through life and you're suicidal
[34.72 - 38.76] you're going through life and you're
[36.44 - 41.64] depressed you're going through life and
[38.76 - 43.76] you got high anxiety and panic and Chaos
[41.64 - 45.12] you feel like it's happening internally
[43.76 - 46.92] and you've been to every doctor and
[45.12 - 49.40] every psychiatrist and every therapist
[46.92 - 51.00] and you've been here you've been there
[49.40 - 52.24] years are going by and you're just
[51.00 - 53.84] somebody told you you're up and down
[52.24 - 55.16] you're bipolar so now you're up you're
[53.84 - 56.88] down you're all over the place another
[55.16 - 58.56] person said you got depersonalization
[56.88 - 60.24] that's what those symptoms are is
[58.56 - 61.84] depersonalization another person is like
[60.24 - 65.28] oh you got OCD another person like you
[61.84 - 69.40] got Tourette's Metals run the gamut in
[65.28 - 74.36] our brain they take over our brain and
[69.40 - 77.00] then they change things in our brain
[74.36 - 79.60] metals can do this they are the rulers
[77.00 - 81.52] here on planet Earth they truly are
[79.60 - 83.56] people don't realize this and hopefully
[81.52 - 85.68] someday they do a lot of people have
[83.56 - 90.68] mercury lead
[85.68 - 94.08] cadmium arsenic aluminum nickel
[90.68 - 95.44] copper the list goes on what you'll find
[94.08 - 98.52] out there is there's a trendy thing
[95.44 - 100.56] where copper is good for you they say
[98.52 - 102.36] it's not me saying that but copper is
[100.56 - 104.28] good for you we're missing copper we
[102.36 - 106.76] don't have enough copper you can drink
[104.28 - 108.16] out of copper you know things and
[106.76 - 110.32] thermoses and mugs and all these
[108.16 - 111.64] different stuff and people think that
[110.32 - 115.08] that's a good thing they think well in
[111.64 - 117.08] Ancient Ancient times they had copper
[115.08 - 118.84] and copper held the water and people
[117.08 - 121.68] used it as an
[118.84 - 124.88] antimicrobial but they also got copper
[121.68 - 127.00] poisoning which created Madness you know
[124.88 - 129.36] that's a thing that people don't realize
[127.00 - 130.84] so the exposure to Copper is so great so
[129.36 - 132.96] I want to hit that right away cuz I know
[130.84 - 134.92] some so many people are like you need
[132.96 - 137.64] copper you need
[134.92 - 140.04] copper zinc gets rid of your copper you
[137.64 - 141.56] need copper this guy over here says zinc
[140.04 - 143.08] gets rid of Co you know you hear it all
[141.56 - 145.24] the time out there have you guys heard
[143.08 - 147.24] that what people don't realize is we're
[145.24 - 150.08] inundated with copper first of all
[147.24 - 153.80] copper is high in all the fruit fruits
[150.08 - 157.00] and vegetables and herbs and
[153.80 - 160.12] spices copper is in everything it's in
[157.00 - 163.40] meat it's in chicken copper is in every
[160.12 - 165.32] vegetable copper is in avocados avocados
[163.40 - 166.84] are high in copper copper is in
[165.32 - 168.84] everything and there's two forms of
[166.84 - 171.68] copper that are in everything there's
[168.84 - 174.84] the natural Trace mineral
[171.68 - 177.52] copper that's in the earth and then
[174.84 - 182.40] there's the industrialized copper that's
[177.52 - 185.88] in the earth two kind of copper is in
[182.40 - 188.16] food we have so much access to Copper we
[185.88 - 190.64] are not copper deficient we are far from
[188.16 - 192.64] it we are over inundated with copper we
[190.64 - 195.80] have too much copper and it WS havoc in
[192.64 - 198.28] us it's one of the toxic heavy metals
[195.80 - 199.56] copper so many people have mercury in
[198.28 - 202.00] them but it's passed on through
[199.56 - 205.16] generation to generation to generation
[202.00 - 206.88] we get our Mercury from our parents
[205.16 - 208.32] parents get our Mercury from their
[206.88 - 209.88] parents their parents get the Mercury
[208.32 - 211.88] from their parents it goes on and on and
[209.88 - 213.68] on back back back back you can go a
[211.88 - 216.76] th000 years you can go 2,000 years you
[213.68 - 219.56] can go 3,000 years and that mercury
[216.76 - 222.80] trans it just basically transforms
[219.56 - 225.20] itself back into our own body it becomes
[222.80 - 228.44] something in our own body passed along
[225.20 - 230.04] from Generations ago and generations ago
[228.44 - 232.32] and we end up with
[230.04 - 233.92] Mercury lots of toxic heavy metals we
[232.32 - 235.72] can pass on generation Generation
[233.92 - 239.64] generation but Mercury's a big one
[235.72 - 241.88] Mercury we really pass that one on gener
[239.64 - 244.16] generation after generation and that
[241.88 - 246.88] mercury can sit inside our brain and it
[244.16 - 250.00] can be thousands of years old you can
[246.88 - 252.40] have mercury inside your brain that is a
[250.00 - 254.16] thousand years old like where did it
[252.40 - 255.68] come from what's going on passed from
[254.16 - 258.32] generation to
[255.68 - 261.48] generation that's the kind of metals
[258.32 - 263.72] that are stored inside of us but I don't
[261.48 - 265.72] have any Metals what the heck metals are
[263.72 - 267.04] not my problem I got a little depression
[265.72 - 268.84] I got a little anxiety I got a little
[267.04 - 270.32] OCD I got a little dep personalization I
[268.84 - 272.92] got a little ups and down got sadness
[270.32 - 275.24] that's mystery mystery sadness I can't
[272.92 - 277.20] find peace in my mind I can't sleep I
[275.24 - 278.80] can't stop these thoughts I got OCD
[277.20 - 282.40] that's driving me crazy I got all these
[278.80 - 285.08] different things going on metal metal
[282.40 - 286.52] metal metal and metals and metals we're
[285.08 - 290.04] going to go into little detail on Metals
[286.52 - 291.20] I'm also making the heavy metal detox
[290.04 - 293.88] today so
[291.20 - 295.68] hmds medical medium heavy metal detox
[293.88 - 296.56] smoothie what you see in front of me
[295.68 - 299.04] really quick I'll give you an
[296.56 - 300.52] introduction if you guys are interested
[299.04 - 304.64] you see the the wild blueberry right
[300.52 - 306.36] here yes the wild blueberry here it is
[304.64 - 308.48] that's it we'll talk about that a little
[306.36 - 311.28] bit later as well you see some cilantro
[308.48 - 314.40] right here really fresh green cilantro
[311.28 - 316.28] you see some oranges see some dolls you
[314.40 - 317.88] see some spirulina Bly grass you see
[316.28 - 319.80] some bananas and so forth a little
[317.88 - 320.96] coconut water too in the glass I might
[319.80 - 322.68] do something with that and we got the
[320.96 - 324.44] blender so we're making the heavy metal
[322.68 - 325.72] detox smoothie how many of you guys are
[324.44 - 328.48] on the
[325.72 - 331.20] hmds I know a lot of you guys
[328.48 - 336.40] are a lot of you guys are so let's get
[331.20 - 336.40] into it a little bit okay all
[336.84 - 343.96] right Alloys so what happens in our
[339.36 - 346.20] brain is we get metals and they mix they
[343.96 - 349.88] mix we get a little bit of copper
[346.20 - 352.24] aluminum Mercury in our brain and then
[349.88 - 355.96] they blend together how do they do that
[352.24 - 359.48] they Forge into an alloy through brain
[355.96 - 362.96] heat if you're upset your brain heats up
[359.48 - 365.32] you get emotional your brain heats up if
[362.96 - 367.12] you're exercising and you're exercising
[365.32 - 369.68] and exercising and you're working out
[367.12 - 371.96] you're working out your brain heats up
[369.68 - 374.08] if you're experiencing immense Joy your
[371.96 - 376.40] brain heats up if you're experiencing
[374.08 - 379.72] immense pain and suffering your brain
[376.40 - 382.44] heats up if you're actually challenged
[379.72 - 384.32] emotionally and you are under stress and
[382.44 - 386.76] you are struggling emotionally your
[384.32 - 391.20] brain heats up and when our brain heats
[386.76 - 394.52] up the metals inside our brain can get
[391.20 - 396.24] hot they can get hot and they do the
[394.52 - 398.56] electricity inside of our brain
[396.24 - 401.36] electrical impulses that are going round
[398.56 - 403.88] and around and around and around right
[401.36 - 406.44] in our brain those electrical impulses
[403.88 - 408.40] swimming around that electrical grid as
[406.44 - 409.84] that electrical grid is going going
[408.40 - 412.36] going going getting hotter and hotter
[409.84 - 415.36] and hotter any little bit of metal
[412.36 - 418.60] that's sitting anywhere in in any neuron
[415.36 - 421.68] any gal cell anywhere in the brain gets
[418.60 - 423.96] hot and Mercury will snuggle next to
[421.68 - 427.04] aluminum aluminum will snuggle next to
[423.96 - 429.12] copper copper will snuggle next to lead
[427.04 - 432.80] and so forth and these Metals sit inside
[429.12 - 435.76] of our brain and then we have emotional
[432.80 - 437.88] experiences stress relationship breakup
[435.76 - 439.72] something happen somebody betrays you
[437.88 - 442.04] maybe somebody cheated on you maybe a
[439.72 - 444.52] friend did something maybe a coworker
[442.04 - 445.88] did something maybe life is just unfair
[444.52 - 449.68] maybe somebody else did something
[445.88 - 451.24] whatever happened we H gone under some
[449.68 - 453.12] kind of emotional struggle in some kind
[451.24 - 455.28] of emotional situation our brain heats
[453.12 - 459.80] up and then any kind of metal inside of
[455.28 - 463.64] our brain forges and binds into each
[459.80 - 465.60] other and becomes an alloy I call it the
[463.64 - 468.68] alloy
[465.60 - 470.92] brain normally the viruses that are in
[468.68 - 474.92] our body that are responsible for
[470.92 - 478.00] autoimmune love Metals I always say to
[474.92 - 482.12] people all these years we can get rid of
[478.00 - 485.44] our viruses work on that but we can also
[482.12 - 488.40] get rid of our metals and work on that
[485.44 - 491.08] the sicker people and the sickest people
[488.40 - 492.32] got the viruses the pathogens right and
[491.08 - 497.00] they got the
[492.32 - 499.32] metals the sickest people have the viral
[497.00 - 502.40] pathogens and the
[499.32 - 505.84] metals people with ALS multiple
[502.40 - 510.00] sclerosis neurological problems chronic
[505.84 - 511.36] fatigue syndrome me or just CFS
[510.00 - 515.52] bad
[511.36 - 517.40] fibromyalgia lime disease all of it
[515.52 - 520.80] pathogens and
[517.40 - 524.00] metals people who actually have more
[520.80 - 527.76] metal suffer more people who have more
[524.00 - 531.00] pathogens suffer more you have but the
[527.76 - 533.24] combination is really hard so many
[531.00 - 534.76] people live a miserable life they
[533.24 - 537.32] struggle and they suffer because they
[534.76 - 539.80] have both pathogens and metals they have
[537.32 - 541.40] the combination so what I like to to do
[539.80 - 543.84] is I'd like to get the medals out so
[541.40 - 545.60] let's talk about that a little bit why
[543.84 - 547.28] are so many people healing in the
[545.60 - 549.68] medical medium Community the largest
[547.28 - 552.00] community in health worldwide by far and
[549.68 - 554.16] the largest community in health that
[552.00 - 556.96] actually has the most people healing
[554.16 - 560.40] worldwide that came to this community
[556.96 - 563.44] devast devastatingly sick chronically
[560.40 - 565.16] sick terrifyingly sick the sickest
[563.44 - 567.72] people come to the medical medium
[565.16 - 570.32] information the sickest people out there
[567.72 - 572.36] in the world come to medical medium
[570.32 - 574.60] information so you have to think about
[572.36 - 576.24] this okay I mean we have some people
[574.60 - 579.36] that didn't come here that sick we do
[576.24 - 580.84] have that but if you look out there and
[579.36 - 583.08] you see what's going on out there you'll
[580.84 - 585.88] see this person this trainer has this
[583.08 - 587.84] this person has that out there this this
[585.88 - 590.04] you know doctor has this out there this
[587.84 - 593.16] practitioner has this out there but they
[590.04 - 596.36] don't have the sickest people on the
[593.16 - 598.68] planet coming to them and the medical me
[596.36 - 601.16] information is there for the sickest
[598.68 - 604.28] people and the sickest people are high
[601.16 - 606.48] in metal and they're high in pathogens
[604.28 - 608.64] and that's just how it
[606.48 - 610.16] works and a host of other things that
[608.64 - 612.32] medical medum information talks about
[610.16 - 616.16] right a whole bunch of that
[612.32 - 618.64] stuff why does the hmds why does the
[616.16 - 621.64] heavy metal detox smoothie work why does
[618.64 - 623.48] the heavy metal detox
[621.64 - 626.36] work
[623.48 - 627.92] why what I mean by work meaning you
[626.36 - 629.48] start getting rid of the depression you
[627.92 - 631.20] start getting rid of the OCD you start
[629.48 - 634.36] getting rid of anxiety you start feeling
[631.20 - 636.84] better your CFS starts to come calm down
[634.36 - 639.60] your fibro starts to drop your
[636.84 - 643.20] neurological lime starts to improve your
[639.60 - 645.68] Ms starts to improve and heal why and
[643.20 - 648.88] many other symptoms too including ezema
[645.68 - 652.08] psoriasis severe dermatitis all these
[648.88 - 654.00] different things rosacea why does it get
[652.08 - 657.64] better because when you're removing the
[654.00 - 662.16] metals you're taking one of the most
[657.64 - 665.36] potent Foods there are for the bugs away
[662.16 - 667.68] you're taking the most potent foods for
[665.36 - 671.16] the bugs you're removing those Foods
[667.68 - 674.44] away from the bugs think about
[671.16 - 677.60] that so as you remove Metals you're
[674.44 - 682.76] removing the very food from the Epstein
[677.60 - 687.92] bar the hh6 the hh7 the hh10 through 16
[682.76 - 690.52] the hsv1 hsv2 C cyto virus right ceglar
[687.92 - 692.64] virus you're removing all of the food
[690.52 - 694.04] from that bug from those bugs the
[692.64 - 696.24] shingles
[694.04 - 699.16] viruses and then once you remove that
[696.24 - 702.16] food the metal then that virus and that
[699.16 - 704.92] pathogen becomes less less aggressive it
[702.16 - 707.68] becomes more docile it
[704.92 - 710.76] weakens and you start to
[707.68 - 712.56] heal someone comes to me and they say w
[710.76 - 715.36] what should I start with first what
[712.56 - 717.08] should I do I'm sick I've had this this
[715.36 - 720.20] this this this I've been to this many
[717.08 - 721.48] doctors what do I do
[720.20 - 722.72] I'll be like did you start with the
[721.48 - 725.72] heavy metal
[722.72 - 727.72] detox did you work on getting the metals
[725.72 - 731.56] out did you start with some of the
[727.72 - 733.12] antiviral protocols what are you doing
[731.56 - 735.32] and then if they do the heavy metal
[733.12 - 737.44] detox what happens is you start getting
[735.32 - 739.48] those Metals out of your body they come
[737.44 - 742.12] out of your liver and your brain and
[739.48 - 744.64] then something changes all of a sudden
[742.12 - 746.24] you're starving the pathogens that are
[744.64 - 751.40] keeping you down because this is how it
[746.24 - 755.88] works okay a pathogen will feed on
[751.40 - 755.88] metal and when a pathogen feeds on
[756.56 - 761.32] metal
[758.48 - 764.32] right so you got the pathogens in you
[761.32 - 767.48] everybody's got the pathogens in them
[764.32 - 771.04] that's right you better believe they do
[767.48 - 773.44] fever blister anybody cold sores anybody
[771.04 - 775.92] oh yeah oh no I get cold SES all the
[773.44 - 778.28] time and uh my sister gets cold sores
[775.92 - 780.16] all the time and my mom got cold sores
[778.28 - 782.12] for a year this we got a family of cold
[780.16 - 785.08] sores that's what we have fever blisters
[782.12 - 787.76] hsv1 right so you got the cold sore
[785.08 - 789.88] virus okay yeah I had Mono I had Mono
[787.76 - 792.64] before yeah that's Epstein bar you've
[789.88 - 795.00] had Mono before exactly and then you got
[792.64 - 796.72] all these pathogens right here right
[795.00 - 798.32] could put happy faces on them because
[796.72 - 802.64] these pathogens are really happy because
[798.32 - 805.16] they're eating metal and then all of a
[802.64 - 807.80] sudden we get exposed to toxic heavy
[805.16 - 810.68] metals in so many different various ways
[807.80 - 812.40] just the simplest ways every time to
[810.68 - 814.64] this day I hear about somebody using an
[812.40 - 817.08] alkaline ionizer water machine and I
[814.64 - 819.28] don't care which brand it is every time
[817.08 - 822.40] I see that I'm like oh yeah you give it
[819.28 - 825.64] 10 years you give it 10 years drinking
[822.40 - 827.68] that water cuz those plates will just
[825.64 - 829.96] blow up in there and they'll just
[827.68 - 833.36] corrode and the metal that will be going
[829.96 - 836.64] into your body from those
[833.36 - 838.28] machines is just
[836.64 - 839.68] unbelievable or if you're somebody
[838.28 - 840.88] that's drinking the copper thermoses and
[839.68 - 842.84] the copper mugs and the whole bit
[840.88 - 844.80] because you think that's
[842.84 - 846.80] healthy or you're somebody that's
[844.80 - 848.12] exposed to aluminum foil or you have
[846.80 - 849.48] Metals in you already that are
[848.12 - 852.40] percolating we're going to go into that
[849.48 - 855.32] a little bit so Metals Metals enter into
[852.40 - 857.68] our body so many different various ways
[855.32 - 858.68] they come on in and when the metals come
[857.68 - 860.68] on
[858.68 - 865.08] in guess
[860.68 - 867.68] what they don't come out Metals go in
[865.08 - 869.72] and never come out Metals go in and
[867.68 - 872.40] never come out
[869.72 - 875.76] Metals arrive and they never leave they
[872.40 - 877.96] never leave they go in and they enter
[875.76 - 879.44] the organs is what they do but we got
[877.96 - 881.80] pathogens in us and when we have
[879.44 - 885.12] pathogens in us the pathogens love to
[881.80 - 888.80] eat and Gobble up the metal copper
[885.12 - 891.56] Mercury pathogens eat and when they eat
[888.80 - 894.80] they that's what happens why are we
[891.56 - 898.84] sick mm info right
[894.80 - 902.24] here mind-blowing information from so
[898.84 - 904.28] mind-blowing pathogens feed off of the
[902.24 - 907.28] metals that come
[904.28 - 910.12] in and when pathogens feed off the
[907.28 - 912.52] metals
[910.12 - 915.80] right they then
[912.52 - 917.48]  here you go they
[915.80 - 922.12] poop
[917.48 - 925.76] excrement right out of them there you go
[922.12 - 927.56] okay pathogens feed off of the metal and
[925.76 - 930.88] then release the metal and then the
[927.56 - 930.88] metal becomes a a
[931.08 - 935.08] neurotoxin it becomes a
[937.36 - 946.76] neurotoxin and uh someone on there saw a
[940.68 - 946.76] comment saying are you grumpy ew am I
[948.92 - 955.16] grumpy it's hard to stay super happy
[952.00 - 956.88] when somebody people do things that just
[955.16 - 958.72] aren't good for them out there you
[956.88 - 960.20] should see it out there you guys know a
[958.72 - 963.36] lot of people do a lot of things that
[960.20 - 965.28] aren't good for them all right so I just
[963.36 - 967.04] wanted to run that by you a little bit
[965.28 - 968.92] so what we do is we have these epscene
[967.04 - 972.24] bars we have these jles viruses we have
[968.92 - 974.80] these hhv 6s yeah yeah we have the
[972.24 - 976.68] simplexes in us and what happens and
[974.80 - 978.88] then we collect more we go out and
[976.68 - 982.24] collect more it's like sure I will
[978.88 - 984.40] gladly collect another virus from you
[982.24 - 986.60] definitely okay let me go here and
[984.40 - 990.84] collect another one they're easy to
[986.60 - 996.36] collect these days it's very easy to get
[990.84 - 996.36] viruses and pathogens very easy there we
[998.00 - 1003.08] go what people don't realize with Metals
[1001.40 - 1006.56] okay is they
[1003.08 - 1009.44] Forge okay so we got
[1006.56 - 1013.00] Mercury we got
[1009.44 - 1016.72] copper like my my handwriting it's not
[1013.00 - 1019.88] so great well what are you going to do
[1016.72 - 1022.76] and so Mercury and copper love to
[1019.88 - 1026.44] snuggle they love to forge they find
[1022.76 - 1028.56] their way to each other is what they do
[1026.44 - 1031.12] they find a way to each other they're
[1028.56 - 1033.52] attracted to each other inside the body
[1031.12 - 1037.04] Mercury and copper do you ever have a
[1033.52 - 1040.56] filling removed no you haven't right not
[1037.04 - 1042.92] to worry then your family members might
[1040.56 - 1045.12] have your parents and their parents
[1042.92 - 1046.52] might have your grandparents might have
[1045.12 - 1047.40] had a whole bunch of mercury fillings
[1046.52 - 1049.84] put
[1047.40 - 1052.08] in and then their grandparents had a
[1049.84 - 1053.72] whole bunch of mercury fillings put in
[1052.08 - 1056.08] and it could even go further back than
[1053.72 - 1057.44] that with Mercury fillings put in and
[1056.08 - 1059.56] those Mercury feeling I've seen people
[1057.44 - 1061.92] like I never had a Mercury filling
[1059.56 - 1064.32] because I'm a younger person and I never
[1061.92 - 1066.52] had that they didn't offer it they
[1064.32 - 1069.56] offered a different composite it's like
[1066.52 - 1072.16] don't worry you got plenty in you from
[1069.56 - 1074.76] your grandparents and their parents and
[1072.16 - 1076.60] your plenty of mercury in you it goes a
[1074.76 - 1080.60] long way a long
[1076.60 - 1082.76] way copper and Merc Mercury combine and
[1080.60 - 1086.20] when we get upset and we get
[1082.76 - 1088.28] emotional and something Jacks us up and
[1086.20 - 1091.64] we're just like we're
[1088.28 - 1095.24] lit and we're on fire for some
[1091.64 - 1099.32] reason brain heat occurs all this brain
[1095.24 - 1104.40] heat occurs right when that brain heat
[1099.32 - 1106.92] occurs that electricity starts to cook
[1104.40 - 1110.04] Metals electricity in our
[1106.92 - 1112.08] brain hits that metal like no other and
[1110.04 - 1114.28] then the forging process happens you got
[1112.08 - 1116.56] a little copper inside your brain you
[1114.28 - 1118.24] got a little mercury inside your brain
[1116.56 - 1121.32] now you're
[1118.24 - 1125.12] upset something gets you
[1121.32 - 1128.20] angry angry something gets you upset I'm
[1125.12 - 1129.40] writing really sloppy tonight something
[1128.20 - 1131.60] gets you
[1129.40 - 1135.40] upset and really
[1131.60 - 1137.32] a maybe somebody just pissed you off and
[1135.40 - 1139.80] then brain heat occurred and then the
[1137.32 - 1142.20] copper and the Mercury start to forge
[1139.80 - 1145.20] together from that heat it takes time it
[1142.20 - 1148.88] takes time but it happens and then it
[1145.20 - 1152.60] becomes one and now what you have right
[1148.88 - 1154.48] here after they Forge is an alloy now
[1152.60 - 1157.84] the copper and the Mercury copper the
[1154.48 - 1161.12] Mercury are now one that makes things
[1157.84 - 1161.12] worse and
[1161.56 - 1166.48] then a bug comes
[1163.92 - 1170.04] along little
[1166.48 - 1172.08] virus awakens your immune system is low
[1170.04 - 1176.56] your old mono virus starts to come out
[1172.08 - 1179.36] the old EBV Epstein bar starts to come
[1176.56 - 1182.16] out and what does it do it stumbles
[1179.36 - 1186.04] across an alloy a combination of copper
[1182.16 - 1187.40] and mercury and it gobbles it up what a
[1186.04 - 1190.40] mess on this
[1187.40 - 1192.88] board and when it gobbles it up it goes
[1190.40 - 1194.68] to the bathroom and when that epine bar
[1192.88 - 1199.20] goes to the
[1194.68 - 1200.92] bathroom that's neurotoxin right there
[1199.20 - 1204.28] neurotoxin that
[1200.92 - 1207.48] neurotoxin can create anything
[1204.28 - 1210.00] anything Vagas nerve issues tightness of
[1207.48 - 1212.08] the chest tightness of the throat
[1210.00 - 1214.56] vibrations all kinds of different stuff
[1212.08 - 1217.04] going on nerve
[1214.56 - 1220.20] Sensations ticks and spasms and aches
[1217.04 - 1223.96] and pains and everything else and
[1220.20 - 1227.48] fatigue yeah fatigue brain
[1223.96 - 1229.68] fog all that neurotoxin pouring out of
[1227.48 - 1232.08] that epine virus that just had that
[1229.68 - 1234.64] copper in Mercury it's releasing that
[1232.08 - 1238.24] neurotoxin into your bloodstream and
[1234.64 - 1238.24] when it releases it into your blood
[1238.56 - 1243.12] stream it starts to circulate float
[1241.16 - 1245.36] around gets to the brain gets to the
[1243.12 - 1247.20] nervous system hits the Vegas nerve
[1245.36 - 1250.40] start starts to weaken the Vegas nerve
[1247.20 - 1252.72] hits the cranial nerves and gets us sick
[1250.40 - 1254.96] and now we don't know what's wrong where
[1252.72 - 1256.92] what how we have no idea we're going
[1254.96 - 1260.36] everywhere we're looking for help we're
[1256.92 - 1264.24] doing castor oil p P we're doing Cod
[1260.36 - 1266.56] Liver Oil we're doing sodium bicarbonate
[1264.24 - 1268.64] we're trying to drink alkaline water
[1266.56 - 1271.24] we're just looking looking looking we're
[1268.64 - 1273.84] doing keto we're doing blood we're doing
[1271.24 - 1277.84] this we're doing you name it we're doing
[1273.84 - 1281.60] dious Earth particles which I strongly
[1277.84 - 1285.12] strongly advise to my family and my
[1281.60 - 1285.12] friends never to
[1285.36 - 1291.68] do because it lowers the immune system
[1290.00 - 1294.84] and then we're looking we're looking for
[1291.68 - 1297.96] answers and all kinds of stuff you guys
[1294.84 - 1300.72] I just saw somebody ask I shall deliver
[1297.96 - 1303.28] the brains saver book right here that's
[1300.72 - 1305.92] the book I'm in right now check it out
[1303.28 - 1307.88] get it free at the library if you can or
[1305.92 - 1311.32] just go to
[1307.88 - 1312.72] amazon.com so let's go into Metals a
[1311.32 - 1316.56] little bit more I would love to talk a
[1312.72 - 1318.64] little bit about it okay beyond the
[1316.56 - 1320.52] damage that toxic metals themselves can
[1318.64 - 1323.64] do there's the truth that they act as
[1320.52 - 1326.44] viral fuel so you got to understand
[1323.64 - 1330.16] something it's critical to get Metals
[1326.44 - 1332.80] out critical somebody may not have a lot
[1330.16 - 1334.48] of viral issues or viral load they might
[1332.80 - 1336.28] not have a low- grade viral infection
[1334.48 - 1338.20] they might not have a highgrade viral
[1336.28 - 1340.24] infection they may not have a big viral
[1338.20 - 1342.28] load but they got a lot of metals and
[1340.24 - 1346.04] then all of a sudden one day happens
[1342.28 - 1348.44] where they pick up a virus and it all
[1346.04 - 1350.76] just explodes on them I was healthy I
[1348.44 - 1352.00] was doing good I don't understand and
[1350.76 - 1353.20] they're backtracking in their mind I
[1352.00 - 1354.68] remember when I was healthy I was doing
[1353.20 - 1356.00] fine I was doing fine and then they're
[1354.68 - 1357.24] doing their affirmations and they're
[1356.00 - 1359.28] talking to themselves and then they're
[1357.24 - 1360.80] talking to their their practitioners and
[1359.28 - 1362.52] their doctors and they're like you don't
[1360.80 - 1364.60] understand I was just fine the other
[1362.52 - 1367.04] week and now I'm sick I was just fine
[1364.60 - 1370.00] months ago a year ago I was fine I was
[1367.04 - 1371.76] doing good and now I'm sick why why why
[1370.00 - 1374.56] nobody knows it they were loaded with
[1371.76 - 1377.00] metals and then something happened
[1374.56 - 1378.92] either they contracted a virus or they
[1377.00 - 1380.28] just had a virus come out of dormy
[1378.92 - 1382.32] because their immune system got lowered
[1380.28 - 1384.44] for some reason or another and a virus
[1382.32 - 1387.80] came out and it gobbled up the metals
[1384.44 - 1389.80] and boom overnight they had the worst
[1387.80 - 1392.88] Sensations and the
[1389.80 - 1394.60] worst symptoms the brain fog and the
[1392.88 - 1397.80] aches and pains and the tingles and
[1394.60 - 1399.44] numbness and the neurological Sensations
[1397.80 - 1402.28] and the trigeminal
[1399.44 - 1404.60] neuralgia and so much more and they're
[1402.28 - 1408.20] struggling because it was the perfect
[1404.60 - 1410.52] perfect recipe The Perfect Storm it was
[1408.20 - 1414.12] the bug eating the metals at just the
[1410.52 - 1415.56] right time and that's it they went down
[1414.12 - 1417.56] and now they're living a life where it's
[1415.56 - 1419.24] all about their health and only about
[1417.56 - 1420.76] their health and they just weren't there
[1419.24 - 1424.08] before they don't know what that's like
[1420.76 - 1424.08] and they never experienced that
[1425.00 - 1428.28] before I want to read a little bit
[1426.96 - 1431.84] something to you real quick if that's
[1428.28 - 1435.04] okay if you guys will let me do
[1431.84 - 1436.88] that okay melting down when our brains
[1435.04 - 1438.60] get hot and there's metal involved
[1436.88 - 1440.24] because that's what happens
[1438.60 - 1442.88] we're loaded with all these metals and
[1440.24 - 1444.68] it becomes an alloy right the toxic
[1442.88 - 1448.60] heavy metal particles break down the
[1444.68 - 1450.32] metals melt they actually melt inside
[1448.60 - 1453.16] our brain toxic heavy metals in the
[1450.32 - 1456.12] brain get wear and tear when electricity
[1453.16 - 1457.80] currents are entering them they start to
[1456.12 - 1460.32] change did you ever notice somebody
[1457.80 - 1462.44] changing did you ever see somebody
[1460.32 - 1465.56] change like you don't even know who they
[1462.44 - 1469.28] are like I don't even know who you are
[1465.56 - 1471.24] man like I've known for years but you're
[1469.28 - 1475.12] something's just changing about you what
[1471.24 - 1476.84] is it like I don't even like who are you
[1475.12 - 1478.92] who are you now this you could see in
[1476.84 - 1480.04] somebody that has Alzheimer's right this
[1478.92 - 1482.56] you can see with somebody who has
[1480.04 - 1484.32] dementia you could really see it then
[1482.56 - 1486.16] because it's just so obvious and you're
[1484.32 - 1487.68] just like whoa something's wrong and
[1486.16 - 1488.80] that's from toxic heavy metals and
[1487.68 - 1490.84] that's original medical medum
[1488.80 - 1494.60] information but it's from toxic heavy
[1490.84 - 1496.64] metals causing the Alzheimer's right and
[1494.60 - 1498.36] dementia but what happens is if you're
[1496.64 - 1500.44] not diagnosed with Al Alzheimer's and
[1498.36 - 1502.32] it's not so apparent and it's not so
[1500.44 - 1503.84] visible and it's not on that scale at
[1502.32 - 1505.80] all it's not about losing your memory
[1503.84 - 1507.88] it's not about going into some kind of
[1505.80 - 1511.52] mania it's not about any of
[1507.88 - 1513.24] that it's just about everyday living in
[1511.52 - 1516.68] life and you're just like why is that
[1513.24 - 1518.16] what that person's changing what is it
[1516.68 - 1521.08] about
[1518.16 - 1522.68] them a lot of times that's metals that
[1521.08 - 1524.44] have melted and they have melted
[1522.68 - 1527.44] together and they're forging and they're
[1524.44 - 1530.84] changing and that's what that is metals
[1527.44 - 1533.20] that forg together their shapes change
[1530.84 - 1535.56] so metals that enter our body or have
[1533.20 - 1539.00] been in our body since we were born end
[1535.56 - 1542.20] up changing over time corrosion can
[1539.00 - 1543.80] occur as well the metals corrode so I
[1542.20 - 1545.44] want to show you that really quick we're
[1543.80 - 1549.16] going to make the heavy metal detox
[1545.44 - 1551.20] smoothie I love that and we're talking
[1549.16 - 1554.52] about heavy metal detox I want to talk
[1551.20 - 1557.32] about like blood testing for Metals I
[1554.52 - 1559.17] want to talk about urine samples for
[1557.32 - 1560.96] metals
[1559.17 - 1563.44] [Music]
[1560.96 - 1566.72] right all
[1563.44 - 1567.80] right cuz that's important too the metal
[1566.72 - 1572.40] goes
[1567.80 - 1575.36] in the metal particles go in okay they
[1572.40 - 1577.40] go in a certain shape and size
[1575.36 - 1579.36] Industrial Metals that go into us all
[1577.40 - 1583.36] the time in so many various way did you
[1579.36 - 1583.36] have fast food metals were in
[1583.48 - 1590.84] it that's just one thing but what
[1586.68 - 1592.24] happens is metals tend to melt as we
[1590.84 - 1593.96] have electricity running through our
[1592.24 - 1595.84] brain and electrical impulses are
[1593.96 - 1597.76] hitting the metal particles and they
[1595.84 - 1599.12] tend to melt when they melt they they
[1597.76 - 1600.84] change shape and all of a sudden they
[1599.12 - 1604.40] have a different shape to them they're
[1600.84 - 1605.08] not the same shape anymore they came in
[1604.40 - 1607.92] kind
[1605.08 - 1609.68] of off shape in a different way but now
[1607.92 - 1611.84] they've changed all the shapes have
[1609.68 - 1615.56] changed and when that
[1611.84 - 1617.88] does happen we
[1615.56 - 1619.60] change when the shape of the metal
[1617.88 - 1622.52] changes that has entered our body
[1619.60 - 1624.96] because it's melting we
[1622.52 - 1626.32] change you can't really tell at first
[1624.96 - 1628.56] with a lot of people but then you can
[1626.32 - 1629.96] tell later or if someone hasn't seen
[1628.56 - 1632.36] somebody in a long time and then they
[1629.96 - 1634.96] see them and they see how different they
[1632.36 - 1637.76] are in different various ways there's a
[1634.96 - 1637.76] changing that
[1638.80 - 1643.16] occurred all right
[1640.64 - 1645.56] so I want to look a little more into
[1643.16 - 1648.52] this another reason brain conditions
[1645.56 - 1650.40] worsen with time is that more toxic
[1648.52 - 1651.88] heavy metals continue to collect and
[1650.40 - 1654.08] this is the next part I want to say
[1651.88 - 1656.76] right here so you got these Metals right
[1654.08 - 1660.12] there in you and then more Metals come
[1656.76 - 1662.68] in every day every year and they come in
[1660.12 - 1664.68] and they find their way and they collect
[1662.68 - 1667.40] they bind on to the metals that are
[1664.68 - 1670.32] already in you deposits in the brain can
[1667.40 - 1673.40] get bigger so as more Metals stream in
[1670.32 - 1677.52] like this they find the metal deposits
[1673.40 - 1680.64] and then they actually enlarge the metal
[1677.52 - 1683.00] starts to accumulate more metal occurs
[1680.64 - 1685.56] and grows because the more metal going
[1683.00 - 1687.80] into the body actually it goes and finds
[1685.56 - 1691.04] the other metal in your body they both
[1687.80 - 1693.12] join hands and now you're getting metal
[1691.04 - 1696.44] deposits and if somebody has a big metal
[1693.12 - 1699.60] deposit if someone has a really big one
[1696.44 - 1702.96] you better believe it so many people do
[1699.60 - 1704.64] they got big metal deposits
[1702.96 - 1708.48] seizures
[1704.64 - 1712.68] seizures big metal deposits
[1708.48 - 1713.52] okay so if someone has a big deposit in
[1712.68 - 1718.00] their
[1713.52 - 1722.12] brain or two big deposits in their brain
[1718.00 - 1722.12] okay and maybe a smaller
[1722.24 - 1729.84] one and more metals are coming
[1726.36 - 1732.16] in they find these big deposits these
[1729.84 - 1734.12] deposits get bigger 10 years down the
[1732.16 - 1736.72] road the deposit is even bigger 20 years
[1734.12 - 1738.80] it's even bigger you're 50 years old now
[1736.72 - 1740.40] the deposit ETS are bigger because
[1738.80 - 1741.84] you're not getting medals out you're not
[1740.40 - 1744.48] taking care of yourself on that level
[1741.84 - 1746.20] nobody's teaching you nobody knows or if
[1744.48 - 1748.60] you hear about Metals now you'll be like
[1746.20 - 1750.92] let me try Zite it doesn't work or let
[1748.60 - 1752.48] me try this it doesn't work or let me
[1750.92 - 1755.68] try something else it doesn't work you
[1752.48 - 1759.24] don't get the metals out it's smoking
[1755.68 - 1761.00] mirrors it's critical Metals come out
[1759.24 - 1765.52] there's no
[1761.00 - 1768.92] games no time for games no time for
[1765.52 - 1771.44] BS the medals have to to come out can't
[1768.92 - 1772.84] do make believe crap where you all of a
[1771.44 - 1774.92] sudden this is good for medal somebody
[1772.84 - 1776.72] says and this is good for medals and
[1774.92 - 1778.60] somebody says out there because it's
[1776.72 - 1780.48] like an industry it's it's everybody's
[1778.60 - 1783.08] just eating each other alive out there
[1780.48 - 1784.80] to try to make a buck right but we got
[1783.08 - 1786.60] to take it serious with the chronic Leo
[1784.80 - 1788.56] because there ain't no time left for a
[1786.60 - 1791.00] lot of people who are sick because
[1788.56 - 1794.12] they've been sick for so long they have
[1791.00 - 1795.52] to get the stuff out of their system so
[1794.12 - 1797.92] they could live their
[1795.52 - 1799.68] life the more metal they go goes in US
[1797.92 - 1801.92] it hits the big deposits that create
[1799.68 - 1803.80] seizure say or just sickness of all
[1801.92 - 1806.44] kinds or severe PR fatigue or whatever
[1803.80 - 1808.64] it is because it's feeding viruses as
[1806.44 - 1811.24] more metal comes in the deposits get
[1808.64 - 1814.96] bigger and they swell sometimes they'll
[1811.24 - 1818.52] get so big that neurons start to Short
[1814.96 - 1818.52] Circuit so as your
[1818.92 - 1822.68] neurons right in your brain all these
[1821.08 - 1824.88] neurons I'm going to draw a few neurons
[1822.68 - 1826.20] right here you guys okay with that if
[1824.88 - 1828.40] you if you're not caught up to what I'm
[1826.20 - 1831.36] doing you just rolled in here these are
[1828.40 - 1836.08] big heavy metal deposits right here
[1831.36 - 1839.20] these three deposits inside of our brain
[1836.08 - 1841.72] okay more metal coming in is making them
[1839.20 - 1843.20] bigger your neurons which are these I'm
[1841.72 - 1845.00] going to string them together you're
[1843.20 - 1847.80] okay with
[1845.00 - 1849.24] that shinging these neurons together
[1847.80 - 1852.92] just for
[1849.24 - 1857.44] fun okay what happens is these deposits
[1852.92 - 1859.40] get so big they impede the neuron so now
[1857.44 - 1861.44] they're walking themselves into the
[1859.40 - 1864.04] neurons as they're walking themselves
[1861.44 - 1865.76] into the neurons your memory is going as
[1864.04 - 1869.00] they're walking themselves into the
[1865.76 - 1869.00] neurons you're getting
[1869.12 - 1874.64] Parkinson as you're walking into these
[1872.20 - 1877.32] neurons you're struggling with all kinds
[1874.64 - 1879.52] of neurological
[1877.32 - 1882.40] symptoms and that's what happens more
[1879.52 - 1885.96] metal goes in the metal deposits get
[1882.40 - 1888.32] bigger and then they rub against neurons
[1885.96 - 1889.80] and they start to D and then the next
[1888.32 - 1893.80] part happens right
[1889.80 - 1896.92] there the next part is the neurons get
[1893.80 - 1901.24] corroded the metal corrodes and the
[1896.92 - 1904.00] metal corrodes and then it out gases and
[1901.24 - 1906.92] deposits come off of it and that's next
[1904.00 - 1908.88] I'll give you that quick rund down cuz
[1906.92 - 1912.60] we got stuff to
[1908.88 - 1914.96] do so here's your neurons right here
[1912.60 - 1914.96] bunch of
[1915.80 - 1920.16] neurons right there they are we're
[1918.52 - 1923.84] stringing them all
[1920.16 - 1926.72] together there they are all that tissue
[1923.84 - 1930.44] okay and then there's the metal here it
[1926.72 - 1932.92] is a big old metal deposit see it right
[1930.44 - 1935.16] here a big old metal deposit right here
[1932.92 - 1937.36] it's growing bigger and bigger you got
[1935.16 - 1940.92] more metal coming in left and right from
[1937.36 - 1943.88] various places more Metals coming in the
[1940.92 - 1946.28] deposits getting bigger and bigger and
[1943.88 - 1947.88] then what happens is that it pushes
[1946.28 - 1950.92] against these neurons
[1947.88 - 1953.76] but worse the metal starts to corrode
[1950.92 - 1957.88] we're on these really high fat diets the
[1953.76 - 1960.20] high fat corrodes the metal more we're
[1957.88 - 1963.16] getting more metal coming in and then it
[1960.20 - 1964.76] starts to leech it's like a leech field
[1963.16 - 1967.80] these are your neurons here and they
[1964.76 - 1971.20] start to become dirty your brain gets
[1967.80 - 1975.64] filthy inside because the metal starts
[1971.20 - 1978.52] to leech and it starts to leech out gas
[1975.64 - 1981.16] and start to corrode and as that Metal's
[1978.52 - 1983.36] corroding it's entering your neurons see
[1981.16 - 1985.52] those beautiful blue neurons right there
[1983.36 - 1988.52] there you go look at that see those
[1985.52 - 1991.12] neurons are getting contaminated right
[1988.52 - 1993.00] there you are and when that happens you
[1991.12 - 1996.28] wake up one
[1993.00 - 1999.72] morning and you have a seizure or your
[1996.28 - 2001.48] first great panic attack or something
[1999.72 - 2003.32] else you wake up and you just don't know
[2001.48 - 2005.92] who you are for a moment happens every
[2003.32 - 2008.96] time for so many people all the time for
[2005.92 - 2008.96] a lot of people out there
[2011.36 - 2016.36] people say to me often like why bother
[2013.20 - 2017.72] getting Metals out what does it matter
[2016.36 - 2021.04] it
[2017.72 - 2023.48] matters because it's something that gets
[2021.04 - 2026.04] in her way and people don't realize it
[2023.48 - 2029.64] and they suffer from it and they have to
[2026.04 - 2032.28] live with those metals and it is no
[2029.64 - 2034.72] fun so think I'll look at one more
[2032.28 - 2037.16] little thing for you guys old Metals
[2034.72 - 2038.76] versus new Metals this isn't important
[2037.16 - 2040.80] place to talk about for a moment heavy
[2038.76 - 2043.28] metals that we inherit have aged to them
[2040.80 - 2045.24] like I said they're old they go back
[2043.28 - 2047.56] 2,000 3,000
[2045.24 - 2050.72] years and depending on what part of the
[2047.56 - 2052.56] world someone's bloodline stems from
[2050.72 - 2054.20] older heavy metals also have a higher
[2052.56 - 2057.00] oxidative rate so that's what happens
[2054.20 - 2059.60] you see someone may have similar amounts
[2057.00 - 2062.20] of metals in them than someone else but
[2059.60 - 2064.12] the oxidative rate is faster in that one
[2062.20 - 2066.52] person making them sicker and giving
[2064.12 - 2069.40] them symptoms and sending them downhill
[2066.52 - 2071.32] the other person has a a slower
[2069.40 - 2074.36] oxidative rate where the metals are
[2071.32 - 2077.48] leeching slower so this person they're
[2074.36 - 2080.68] leeching faster this person they're
[2077.48 - 2083.04] leeching slower that also determines so
[2080.68 - 2085.96] many different symptoms when and
[2083.04 - 2088.28] how an oxidative countdown occurred as
[2085.96 - 2090.08] the metals aged those Metals became
[2088.28 - 2092.32] highly unstable when they entered and
[2090.08 - 2094.56] sat inside human bodies where metals
[2092.32 - 2096.48] were exposed for years and years and
[2094.56 - 2098.68] years going down our bloodline so what
[2096.48 - 2101.20] happens is the older the metals are the
[2098.68 - 2104.32] more we really suffer and so many people
[2101.20 - 2107.04] are suffering in so such great ways
[2104.32 - 2108.68] awful great ways all right so I want to
[2107.04 - 2111.84] start working on some other stuff too
[2108.68 - 2113.32] let's let's get into um let's get into
[2111.84 - 2116.32] the intestinal tract for a couple of
[2113.32 - 2116.32] minutes
[2116.36 - 2123.24] okay we inhale Metals we eat Metals we
[2120.28 - 2125.72] breathe in me Metals which is inhaling
[2123.24 - 2127.72] them we get Metals in our skin we get
[2125.72 - 2130.12] Metals in our bloodstream every single
[2127.72 - 2132.20] day and metals circulate throughout our
[2130.12 - 2135.52] bloodstream every single day and then
[2132.20 - 2136.44] they find a home so when we eat toxic
[2135.52 - 2139.12] heavy
[2136.44 - 2142.00] metals the metals go down into our
[2139.12 - 2145.72] stomach they go down into our intestinal
[2142.00 - 2147.36] tract and they stay there they cling to
[2145.72 - 2149.32] the walls of the intestinal tract they
[2147.36 - 2151.44] go up the highway that goes to the liver
[2149.32 - 2153.60] the hepatic portal Highway the metals
[2151.44 - 2155.12] travel into the liver the liver tries to
[2153.60 - 2157.08] filter the metals out and then the
[2155.12 - 2158.92] metals get trapped inside the liver when
[2157.08 - 2162.00] the metals get trapped inside the liver
[2158.92 - 2166.44] they become food for you know what the
[2162.00 - 2168.48] bugs the bugs the bugs as the metals are
[2166.44 - 2170.24] sitting inside the liver so are bugs and
[2168.48 - 2172.52] the bugs feed off of the metals and next
[2170.24 - 2174.20] thing you know it you got yourself some
[2172.52 - 2177.88] fatigue you
[2174.20 - 2180.56] cannot explain you don't understand the
[2177.88 - 2183.68] fatigue you can't explain it you don't
[2180.56 - 2185.48] know why you have it but it's there and
[2183.68 - 2189.28] it's just not a matter of you
[2185.48 - 2191.52] overworking or over exercising or just
[2189.28 - 2193.96] even being stressed out fatigue that
[2191.52 - 2195.80] shouldn't be there sticks around because
[2193.96 - 2198.24] bugs inside the liver will feed off of
[2195.80 - 2201.16] those metals and that will happen now
[2198.24 - 2203.96] people get tested for Metals
[2201.16 - 2205.28] now it's something that's common since
[2203.96 - 2206.88] there's been so much awareness with the
[2205.28 - 2208.68] medical medium books all these years and
[2206.88 - 2210.12] information so they're getting tested
[2208.68 - 2211.72] for metals and a lot of doctors are like
[2210.12 - 2213.48] well you don't have really any Metals in
[2211.72 - 2216.72] here but what people don't realize is
[2213.48 - 2219.08] they're in the organs spleen pancreas
[2216.72 - 2222.08] liver inside the stomach tissue the
[2219.08 - 2224.92] stomach walls testinal tract walls
[2222.08 - 2227.56] they're in the heart Metals get into the
[2224.92 - 2229.96] heart muscle and they hide in there
[2227.56 - 2232.76] they're in lung tissue metals are in the
[2229.96 - 2234.44] brain metals are in the spinal cord
[2232.76 - 2235.96] metals are in the central nervous system
[2234.44 - 2238.36] and they sit in there so when you test
[2235.96 - 2241.12] for Metals you don't really test that
[2238.36 - 2242.80] high in metal some people do because
[2241.12 - 2245.36] they're having recent
[2242.80 - 2248.40] exposures the only way to find Metals
[2245.36 - 2250.92] through testing and blood testing is a
[2248.40 - 2253.24] recent exposure that's happening on a
[2250.92 - 2256.32] daily or weekly
[2253.24 - 2259.52] basis and when there's a recent
[2256.32 - 2261.76] exposure then the blood can you can find
[2259.52 - 2264.80] Metals inside the
[2261.76 - 2266.44] blood if there isn't a recent exposure
[2264.80 - 2269.52] of a high enough
[2266.44 - 2272.20] magnitude of enough then it'll just sit
[2269.52 - 2274.68] deep inside the organs I've been putting
[2272.20 - 2276.60] this information out there for decades
[2274.68 - 2279.00] finally the blood labs are starting to
[2276.60 - 2281.12] to admit this that metals are sitting
[2279.00 - 2283.12] inside organs and they may not be
[2281.12 - 2287.04] detectable in the
[2283.12 - 2287.04] bloodstream thanks to mm
[2289.08 - 2293.28] info okay so let's talk about getting
[2291.12 - 2296.32] the metals out I'm going to make a heavy
[2293.28 - 2299.60] metal detox smoothie one that I really
[2296.32 - 2302.36] love and you can you can get Metals out
[2299.60 - 2304.16] in different ways I talk about it in the
[2302.36 - 2306.76] books and I had all the way since the
[2304.16 - 2309.64] beginning that getting three out of the
[2306.76 - 2312.60] five ingredients is critical three out
[2309.64 - 2313.88] of the five so you got cant right here
[2312.60 - 2316.48] that's one of the ingredients right
[2313.88 - 2320.08] there you got wild blueberries that's
[2316.48 - 2323.20] another one right there you got Atlantic
[2320.08 - 2325.92] dols it's another one right there you
[2323.20 - 2328.72] got spirulina you got barley grass those
[2325.92 - 2331.36] are two more right there five will give
[2328.72 - 2333.52] you the best
[2331.36 - 2334.44] results five ingredients will give you
[2333.52 - 2336.88] the best
[2334.44 - 2340.08] results but it's important to try to at
[2336.88 - 2342.12] least get three if you
[2340.08 - 2343.76] can now a lot of people talk about
[2342.12 - 2346.20] chorella and they're like well what
[2343.76 - 2349.76] about that well that drops the metal it
[2346.20 - 2352.12] doesn't hold on to it no one even knew
[2349.76 - 2354.56] it even did anything with
[2352.12 - 2357.16] metal until I started talking about over
[2354.56 - 2358.96] the years that it drops metal it drops
[2357.16 - 2361.16] it and a lot of people don't realize
[2358.96 - 2363.84] that another thing is zeolites cannot
[2361.16 - 2367.44] get metal out of the brain
[2363.84 - 2370.32] keep this as a feather in your
[2367.44 - 2372.80] cap because this is critical because
[2370.32 - 2375.84] it's important to know that Zees will
[2372.80 - 2380.08] never get toxic heavy metals or any
[2375.84 - 2383.28] metal out of the brain it's not possible
[2380.08 - 2386.36] it's basically a clay it can't get
[2383.28 - 2389.32] Metals out of organs either because it
[2386.36 - 2391.36] can't enter an organ there's no zeolite
[2389.32 - 2394.72] variety there's no zeolite brand out
[2391.36 - 2397.60] right now there's no type of Zite that
[2394.72 - 2399.20] can remove a metal out of a an organ or
[2397.60 - 2401.76] the
[2399.20 - 2403.48] brain so when you're using Zees kiss
[2401.76 - 2407.52] your money
[2403.48 - 2410.68] goodbye kiss a goodbye very important to
[2407.52 - 2414.28] know because what people don't realize
[2410.68 - 2416.96] is if clay can enter your
[2414.28 - 2421.36] bloodstream if clay can enter your
[2416.96 - 2423.40] bloodstream on any level if zeolite can
[2421.36 - 2425.20] enter your bloodstream in any level on
[2423.40 - 2427.12] any level you'll just have a stroke and
[2425.20 - 2429.92] a heart attack
[2427.12 - 2433.92] you'll have a blood clot an aneurysm
[2429.92 - 2436.16] blood clot or some kind of blood
[2433.92 - 2438.56] blockage blood vessel
[2436.16 - 2440.16] blockage because you just can't pump
[2438.56 - 2443.84] that stuff into your bloodstream and
[2440.16 - 2446.60] have it swim around it'll get caught up
[2443.84 - 2450.24] somewhere and you'll die or have a
[2446.60 - 2453.48] problem so it never enters into your
[2450.24 - 2455.88] bloodstream it can't never has for
[2453.48 - 2457.40] anyone and never will very important to
[2455.88 - 2459.08] understand a couple little topics I
[2457.40 - 2460.76] wanted to cover because we're talking
[2459.08 - 2463.92] about heavy metal
[2460.76 - 2466.52] detox and I wouldn't recommend a zealite
[2463.92 - 2469.00] these days because there's
[2466.52 - 2471.44] cross-contamination of zeolites that
[2469.00 - 2473.84] aren't edible so what happens is with
[2471.44 - 2476.04] manufacturing zeolite
[2473.84 - 2478.64] products it's
[2476.04 - 2479.96] intermixed not on purpose but by
[2478.64 - 2481.60] accident with zeolites that are not
[2479.96 - 2484.00] edible that's a problem all when it's
[2481.60 - 2485.40] own that create dehydration one of the
[2484.00 - 2489.00] reasons why I don't like zeolites is
[2485.40 - 2492.20] because it dehydr ation issues you lose
[2489.00 - 2494.56] critical electrolytes you get dehydrated
[2492.20 - 2496.60] happens like that with all
[2494.56 - 2498.12] Zees especially the ones that are out
[2496.60 - 2499.88] there now so these are some of the
[2498.12 - 2501.76] things that I'm talking about that are
[2499.88 - 2504.84] really important and that's one of them
[2501.76 - 2507.80] another another one right here okay very
[2504.84 - 2509.52] important you can't get Metals out with
[2507.80 - 2511.32] charcoal you can't get Metals out of
[2509.52 - 2515.24] your bloodstream you can't get Metals
[2511.32 - 2517.36] out of your organs with charcoal it is
[2515.24 - 2522.00] impossible
[2517.36 - 2526.52] it will not happen it does not
[2522.00 - 2529.56] happen zealite and charcoal don't
[2526.52 - 2531.48] work and zealite is just something that
[2529.56 - 2533.48] goes into your stomach then down your
[2531.48 - 2537.04] dadum then into your intestinal tract
[2533.48 - 2538.96] and then out the door that's all it does
[2537.04 - 2542.04] it can't enter the hepatic portal
[2538.96 - 2545.76] Highway it can't cross the bloodb brain
[2542.04 - 2549.20] barrier it can't do any of that it's
[2545.76 - 2552.52] imposs possible if it did the person
[2549.20 - 2555.72] would die and have a
[2552.52 - 2560.88] stroke charcoal goes in the intestinal
[2555.72 - 2563.20] tract and then goes out it's not a organ
[2560.88 - 2563.20] or
[2564.28 - 2569.28] brain toxic metal removal system so
[2567.92 - 2570.52] that's important too to understand I'm
[2569.28 - 2571.80] trying to read comments at the same time
[2570.52 - 2575.00] you
[2571.80 - 2577.92] guys so now you'll hear out there are so
[2575.00 - 2580.92] many that well try try try this try that
[2577.92 - 2582.72] that will do it and it doesn't so what I
[2580.92 - 2585.40] like I like something with a track
[2582.72 - 2590.32] record something that has helped so many
[2585.40 - 2590.32] people and turned around autism yes
[2590.60 - 2595.28] autism children that couldn't speak
[2592.76 - 2595.28] could now
[2595.68 - 2601.92] speak turned around all kinds of all
[2598.84 - 2603.44] kinds of different issues in people got
[2601.92 - 2605.32] their lives back in so many different
[2603.44 - 2607.28] ways got them out of wheelchairs got
[2605.32 - 2609.84] them talking again got them walking
[2607.28 - 2612.16] again something with a powerful track
[2609.84 - 2614.00] record got their skin better got rid of
[2612.16 - 2615.68] the eczema got rid of the psoriasis got
[2614.00 - 2617.44] rid of all of that that's what I'm
[2615.68 - 2620.40] talking about that matters and that's
[2617.44 - 2622.48] what we want not something I'm throwing
[2620.40 - 2624.92] together creating some horeshit for
[2622.48 - 2626.40] somebody to actually take or whatever
[2624.92 - 2629.04] and you don't know cuz there's no track
[2626.40 - 2631.52] record but the medical medium heavy
[2629.04 - 2633.92] metal detox has the track record for
[2631.52 - 2635.60] years and years and years and has saved
[2633.92 - 2636.76] lives and you guys know many of you guys
[2635.60 - 2638.88] have done it
[2636.76 - 2640.68] has saved
[2638.88 - 2642.60] lives all right so I'm going to go into
[2640.68 - 2643.80] this a little bit I'm going to hit the
[2642.60 - 2646.24] wild blueberry for a little bit you guys
[2643.80 - 2648.68] got a couple of minutes on this try to
[2646.24 - 2653.12] keep it as interesting as possible right
[2648.68 - 2656.92] there okay a Canadian wild
[2653.12 - 2658.48] blueberry or the main wild
[2656.92 - 2662.36] blueberry
[2658.48 - 2665.00] right and this right here is the
[2662.36 - 2669.80] ultimate to use in your heavy metal
[2665.00 - 2674.60] detox it's this it's the best one to
[2669.80 - 2677.44] use now if you can't get a hold of this
[2674.60 - 2678.84] one here which is the wild blueberry
[2677.44 - 2682.20] North
[2678.84 - 2684.64] America if you can't get a hold of it I
[2682.20 - 2687.28] always say you can do blackberries but
[2684.64 - 2690.40] blackberries can only remove a little
[2687.28 - 2691.60] bit of metal little bit from the
[2690.40 - 2693.84] intestinal
[2691.60 - 2697.56] tract and the blackberries don't even
[2693.84 - 2699.80] have to be wild now all wild berries out
[2697.56 - 2701.92] there like wild
[2699.80 - 2705.16] raspberries wild
[2701.92 - 2708.32] billberry has a little
[2705.16 - 2709.88] bit some capabilities of removing a
[2708.32 - 2712.08] little bit of toxic heavy metals out of
[2709.88 - 2714.72] the intestinal tract but can't remove
[2712.08 - 2716.84] them out of the brain can't remove them
[2714.72 - 2719.16] out of the liver can't remove them deep
[2716.84 - 2721.68] out of the
[2719.16 - 2724.88] organs and that's the difference now if
[2721.68 - 2728.52] you don't have access to the wild
[2724.88 - 2731.32] blueberry and gusta fium that one if you
[2728.52 - 2733.96] don't have access to those wild
[2731.32 - 2736.08] blueberries and you got to use another
[2733.96 - 2737.68] blueberry or another different kind of
[2736.08 - 2739.04] berry or a wild blueberry or something
[2737.68 - 2741.28] like that that because there are wild
[2739.04 - 2743.92] blueberries out
[2741.28 - 2747.08] there and the wild blue let's go into it
[2743.92 - 2750.08] a little bit okay European blueberry is
[2747.08 - 2753.08] not this variety of wild blueberry it's
[2750.08 - 2755.40] the billberry it's really important to
[2753.08 - 2757.16] know now there are Bill berries in the
[2755.40 - 2759.44] US there there's bilberries in Canada
[2757.16 - 2763.32] there's bilberries in Maine there's
[2759.44 - 2765.20] bilberries out there but and I have
[2763.32 - 2767.08] access to bilberry but I've never put
[2765.20 - 2768.36] bilberry in here so I want people to
[2767.08 - 2770.20] know this this is important because I
[2768.36 - 2772.88] think what happened is over time because
[2770.20 - 2774.64] there wasn't access to this variety of
[2772.88 - 2776.40] wild blueberry I think people are just
[2774.64 - 2778.08] putting any wild berry they can find in
[2776.40 - 2780.88] there and I got respect for that because
[2778.08 - 2783.08] guess what that's good that's good put
[2780.88 - 2784.36] in any wild berry you can get in there I
[2783.08 - 2786.36] like the blackberries and if you can get
[2784.36 - 2788.44] a wild Blackberry then that is the
[2786.36 - 2790.96] ultimate it's not going to do what the
[2788.44 - 2793.48] wild blueberry does and gusap fium is
[2790.96 - 2796.52] not going to do what that
[2793.48 - 2798.08] does but it's important to know because
[2796.52 - 2800.80] what happens out there is then people
[2798.08 - 2801.84] are just like whoa I'm doing it up like
[2800.80 - 2805.24] I'm doing
[2801.84 - 2807.04] it exactly the way it should be and what
[2805.24 - 2809.08] they don't realize if the billberry is
[2807.04 - 2811.84] in here it's not exactly the way it
[2809.08 - 2814.12] should be but still sure if that's all
[2811.84 - 2816.04] you got then do it but you're really
[2814.12 - 2818.04] running on four ingredients if if you
[2816.04 - 2820.40] don't have the wild
[2818.04 - 2823.16] blueberry if you're using a billberry
[2820.40 - 2827.96] then your your your heavy metal detox is
[2823.16 - 2831.08] only running on four ingredients not
[2827.96 - 2833.04] five that's all and I always say three
[2831.08 - 2834.24] out of the five get three out of the
[2833.04 - 2836.60] five so if you're somebody and you're
[2834.24 - 2838.04] doing the heavy metal detox somewhere
[2836.60 - 2840.52] anywhere in the
[2838.04 - 2842.04] world and you're putting a raspberry in
[2840.52 - 2843.96] there the wild raspberry are you're
[2842.04 - 2845.44] putting a wild billberry in there or
[2843.96 - 2847.40] you're putting a wild Blackberry in
[2845.44 - 2849.76] there
[2847.40 - 2851.40] that's that's that's good it's got a lot
[2849.76 - 2853.88] of nutrients for other
[2851.40 - 2856.04] reasons it's got healing properties for
[2853.88 - 2857.92] other things but it doesn't remove the
[2856.04 - 2860.08] the the metals deep within the organs
[2857.92 - 2863.48] and deep within the brain and deep where
[2860.08 - 2865.16] it needs to be so you're running really
[2863.48 - 2867.48] four out of
[2865.16 - 2870.56] five and if you're somebody that only
[2867.48 - 2874.08] has cilantro you call cor coriander you
[2870.56 - 2876.40] got cilantro and then you got DOL and
[2874.08 - 2879.36] then you got say spirina that's
[2876.40 - 2883.24] three it's still going to help but to
[2879.36 - 2887.44] get maximum maximum
[2883.24 - 2891.56] pull maximum you want the
[2887.44 - 2895.48] five the five you need the cilantro you
[2891.56 - 2897.36] need the Inus fium the wild blueberry I
[2895.48 - 2899.44] know in Europe they call European
[2897.36 - 2903.80] blueberry that's
[2899.44 - 2905.92] bberry and I know there are wild
[2903.80 - 2907.56] blueberries but there're they're very
[2905.92 - 2909.32] hard to get they're very hard to get in
[2907.56 - 2912.04] Europe you can't get them they're
[2909.32 - 2913.52] they're they're very hard to find and
[2912.04 - 2916.44] you can't get them so everybody's
[2913.52 - 2918.28] relying on the billberry out there
[2916.44 - 2920.48] that's fine you can put billberry in
[2918.28 - 2921.88] there you can definitely put bberry you
[2920.48 - 2924.20] can put Blackberry in there you can put
[2921.88 - 2927.12] a huckleberry in there you can put those
[2924.20 - 2929.80] in there but you're not at the maximum
[2927.12 - 2932.28] pull to actually get the metals deep out
[2929.80 - 2933.36] of the organs right you're running four
[2932.28 - 2936.76] out of
[2933.36 - 2938.28] five ingredients and look companies have
[2936.76 - 2941.56] also tried to market the billberry so
[2938.28 - 2943.04] much so they say that the North American
[2941.56 - 2945.44] you know wild blueberry they say that
[2943.04 - 2947.88] the wild blueberry from
[2945.44 - 2949.88] Canada is
[2947.88 - 2952.40] cultivated there's companies out there
[2949.88 - 2954.56] now so hungry and so money hungry to hop
[2952.40 - 2957.28] on the heavy metal detox ride that
[2954.56 - 2960.08] they'll actually say that the wild
[2957.28 - 2962.96] blueberry gusap fium in the United
[2960.08 - 2966.24] States or in Canada is actually
[2962.96 - 2968.44] cultivated that is not true this is a
[2966.24 - 2970.32] wild food and it's not
[2968.44 - 2973.44] cultivated that's important thing I want
[2970.32 - 2975.80] to clear up so I've seen that out
[2973.44 - 2977.60] there and the wild blueberry has more
[2975.80 - 2979.64] antioxidants than the bberry so I want
[2977.60 - 2981.24] to cover that for a minute that's really
[2979.64 - 2984.12] important here
[2981.24 - 2985.56] okay so there are some rumors out there
[2984.12 - 2987.16] being spread because that's how it is
[2985.56 - 2987.92] because people want to sell the crap out
[2987.16 - 2990.08] of their
[2987.92 - 2992.92] billberry I get it everybody's
[2990.08 - 2995.56] everybody's trying to survive out there
[2992.92 - 2998.24] I get it but they want to sell the CRA
[2995.56 - 3000.04] crap out of their billberry so much so
[2998.24 - 3003.00] that they will say that the billberry is
[3000.04 - 3007.72] higher in antioxidants than the wild
[3003.00 - 3011.24] blueberry they Gap fum Canada in the US
[3007.72 - 3015.04] and they're wrong they're
[3011.24 - 3017.72] wrong they are dead
[3015.04 - 3021.32] wrong this wild blueberry right here the
[3017.72 - 3022.92] gusol has higher antioxidents in any
[3021.32 - 3025.56] billberry
[3022.92 - 3027.04] fact but you see they'll spin it every
[3025.56 - 3029.16] body spins whatever they want to do
[3027.04 - 3030.56] that's what they do they spin it all oh
[3029.16 - 3032.92] our bill berries are higher than the
[3030.56 - 3036.24] wild blueberry no it's not it may be
[3032.92 - 3039.00] higher than a cultivated blueberry like
[3036.24 - 3041.08] a regular cultivated blueberry it may be
[3039.00 - 3044.76] higher for than you know than
[3041.08 - 3047.28] that they grow a lot of cultivated
[3044.76 - 3049.04] blueberries in Poland maybe it's it's
[3047.28 - 3050.76] higher than that one maybe it's higher
[3049.04 - 3053.48] than another one that's cultivated but
[3050.76 - 3056.36] not the inap fium not
[3053.48 - 3058.16] the wild food that's sitting in front of
[3056.36 - 3060.16] me so I want to clear some of these
[3058.16 - 3062.56] things
[3060.16 - 3064.28] up it's okay if you're running four out
[3062.56 - 3066.56] of five it's okay if you're running
[3064.28 - 3068.24] three out of five and that's all you got
[3066.56 - 3071.04] you only got some barley grass juice
[3068.24 - 3072.40] powder or you only got some spirulina
[3071.04 - 3074.64] and some
[3072.40 - 3077.16] cilantro and maybe some
[3074.64 - 3078.56] dolls and that's a three you run because
[3077.16 - 3081.40] that's all you got then make that
[3078.56 - 3084.24] smoothie or make that smoothie bowl with
[3081.40 - 3086.12] those three things okay you guys you can
[3084.24 - 3087.12] do that
[3086.12 - 3089.84] but
[3087.12 - 3092.04] ideally ideally if it comes your way
[3089.84 - 3094.48] someday or you're somewhere and you have
[3092.04 - 3097.88] it and you can do all
[3094.48 - 3102.20] five that takes it to another level
[3097.88 - 3105.00] that's when it's a maximum right there
[3102.20 - 3109.08] cilantro spirulina barley grass juice
[3105.00 - 3111.08] powder dols wild blueberries like wild
[3109.08 - 3114.60] blueberries not what they call Wild
[3111.08 - 3117.36] blueberry a billberry no not that wild
[3114.60 - 3117.36] blueberries
[3117.68 - 3121.60] bilberries grow differently than a wild
[3119.48 - 3125.52] blueberry bilberries grow in small
[3121.60 - 3127.84] amounts very spread out so I question a
[3125.52 - 3130.08] lot of billberry products out there
[3127.84 - 3133.88] because you can't Harvest enough of it
[3130.08 - 3137.92] to meet a demand which means it's
[3133.88 - 3140.92] questionable to what else is in
[3137.92 - 3144.16] there anyway okay we covered a little
[3140.92 - 3144.16] bit of that let's start doing
[3144.28 - 3147.28] this
[3150.04 - 3153.72] if you need to make just a smoothie bowl
[3152.48 - 3155.52] and you just want a bunch of fruit
[3153.72 - 3157.80] chopped up in a bowl make sure if you
[3155.52 - 3160.04] wanted the heavy metal detox you put in
[3157.80 - 3162.48] the five
[3160.04 - 3165.12] ingredients you put a little bit of
[3162.48 - 3165.96] dols you got your wild blueberry you got
[3165.12 - 3168.36] your
[3165.96 - 3170.48] cilantro right you got your spirulina
[3168.36 - 3172.88] barrass cheese powder and you put it and
[3170.48 - 3174.28] you make a smoothie Bowl you know what I
[3172.88 - 3177.04] do a lot I'll tell you right now you
[3174.28 - 3179.56] guys you know what I do L I cut open a
[3177.04 - 3181.52] melon crack the melon open and I put
[3179.56 - 3183.44] spirulina right in the melon I put
[3181.52 - 3185.88] barley grass right in the melon I put
[3183.44 - 3187.20] some DOL liquid right in the melon right
[3185.88 - 3189.72] and I put some wild blueberries right in
[3187.20 - 3191.56] the melon and I chop up some cilantro
[3189.72 - 3194.68] and I put it right in the melon and I
[3191.56 - 3196.92] have basically a melon smoothie Bowl
[3194.68 - 3198.68] basically and that's what I do because
[3196.92 - 3201.04] I'm just trying to get the five
[3198.68 - 3202.60] ingredients that's the key right that's
[3201.04 - 3204.28] the main key I'm just trying to get that
[3202.60 - 3206.68] in me all right but we're making the
[3204.28 - 3209.00] smoothie
[3206.68 - 3209.00] let's
[3209.12 - 3213.84] get roughly two cups of the wild
[3211.52 - 3216.64] blueberries in here
[3213.84 - 3220.28] okay you can find real wild blueberries
[3216.64 - 3222.72] in Europe real wild ones but it's not
[3220.28 - 3225.00] billberry they're just calling billberry
[3222.72 - 3228.36] the wild blueberry that's what they're
[3225.00 - 3230.16] doing they're calling the the billberry
[3228.36 - 3232.44] the wild blueberry it's not the wild
[3230.16 - 3234.16] blueberry you see how it works I just
[3232.44 - 3236.48] want to make sure that that's all clear
[3234.16 - 3238.24] information
[3236.48 - 3239.92] and then the sellers are doing that and
[3238.24 - 3241.96] pushing that to make money right the
[3239.92 - 3243.88] sellers of billberry products are
[3241.96 - 3245.12] pushing it as the wild blueberry they're
[3243.88 - 3246.64] actually saying it's a wild blueberry
[3245.12 - 3248.36] and then you see the little you see the
[3246.64 - 3251.28] little fine print
[3248.36 - 3254.16] bberry our wild blueberries are so good
[3251.28 - 3255.84] out here they're so great you should see
[3254.16 - 3258.12] them they're actually handpicked by
[3255.84 - 3259.32] people foraging in the woods and then
[3258.12 - 3260.44] right there you'll see a little bit
[3259.32 - 3261.68] they're calling it wild blueberry and
[3260.44 - 3263.68] then you'll see a little bit in the
[3261.68 - 3265.72] little spot there billberry like yeah
[3263.68 - 3268.68] because you're picking bilberries
[3265.72 - 3269.96] but you know because so much so many
[3268.68 - 3271.72] people millions of people drink the
[3269.96 - 3274.24] heavy metal detox around the world you
[3271.72 - 3277.28] know that there's a market for it I
[3274.24 - 3279.40] understand I'm not look I'm not calling
[3277.28 - 3280.96] people out I'm just saying it like it is
[3279.40 - 3282.40] of what's Happening here's cilantro
[3280.96 - 3286.04] right
[3282.40 - 3289.00] here I like cilantro by itself I like it
[3286.04 - 3291.92] on everything and anything I use it as a
[3289.00 - 3293.44] leafy green that's how I love cilantro
[3291.92 - 3295.68] as a leafy
[3293.44 - 3297.80] green but it's great have it here's
[3295.68 - 3299.80] another thing to run by you really quick
[3297.80 - 3301.88] okay if you get the five ingredients
[3299.80 - 3303.92] during the course of the same day the
[3301.88 - 3308.04] medical medium heavy metal
[3303.92 - 3310.68] detox means you try to get the five
[3308.04 - 3314.52] ingredients on the same
[3310.68 - 3317.36] day same day that's what you
[3314.52 - 3318.60] do you get the cilantro in your salad
[3317.36 - 3321.68] you get the wild blueberry in your
[3318.60 - 3324.40] breakfast you get the your spirulina in
[3321.68 - 3326.28] a papaya put sprinkle it on a papaya
[3324.40 - 3328.28] whatever it is you get the five on the
[3326.28 - 3330.64] same day doesn't have to be at the same
[3328.28 - 3331.76] time keep that in mind and you get the
[3330.64 - 3334.64] medals
[3331.76 - 3335.64] out you just have to get them in on the
[3334.64 - 3338.08] same
[3335.64 - 3340.16] day see how it goes I've always said
[3338.08 - 3342.56] that all the way since the beginning
[3340.16 - 3346.40] billberry is still good for you and you
[3342.56 - 3348.56] can still use them to get some small
[3346.40 - 3350.20] amount of metal out of your intestinal
[3348.56 - 3351.40] tract it won't get it out of the brain
[3350.20 - 3353.28] it won't get out of the organs but the
[3351.40 - 3355.08] billberry will get a small amount out of
[3353.28 - 3358.32] the intestinal tract and so will Wild
[3355.08 - 3361.84] raspberry and so will a wild
[3358.32 - 3363.92] blackberry and so will some Huckleberry
[3361.84 - 3367.00] whatever it is that you got right it
[3363.92 - 3369.12] will take a little bit out of the
[3367.00 - 3370.72] intestinal tract but it can't go further
[3369.12 - 3373.32] than that and it doesn't take a lot out
[3370.72 - 3376.36] of the intestinal tract and the binder
[3373.32 - 3377.72] the heavy binder quality is not there so
[3376.36 - 3380.64] you can you know that's not happening
[3377.72 - 3383.92] too so the wild blueberry right the
[3380.64 - 3385.96] angustifolium is the like heavy
[3383.92 - 3388.48] binder
[3385.96 - 3390.52] all right so I got cilantro in there I
[3388.48 - 3393.12] got the wild blueberry in there let's
[3390.52 - 3394.24] pop in a couple bananas in there too
[3393.12 - 3398.08] hello
[3394.24 - 3401.52] bananas I'm very happy to see
[3398.08 - 3404.16] you pop a couple of bananas in
[3401.52 - 3407.72] there
[3404.16 - 3410.04] nice nice you guys it's great to be here
[3407.72 - 3412.76] I wanted to run this by people I want
[3410.04 - 3414.88] them to be inspired to get Metals out of
[3412.76 - 3416.44] their body because it is important
[3414.88 - 3419.12] important to do
[3416.44 - 3422.24] so all right let's get some spirulina in
[3419.12 - 3425.96] here a little
[3422.24 - 3429.96] bit okay I'll try not to make a
[3425.96 - 3432.40] mess but I do make a mess all the time
[3429.96 - 3434.04] in the kitchen got some barley grass
[3432.40 - 3436.88] cheese powder let's go into that
[3434.04 - 3439.16] next barley grass is not barley grass
[3436.88 - 3443.00] cheese
[3439.16 - 3446.24] powder Corella is not
[3443.00 - 3450.24] spirulina it's not two different things
[3446.24 - 3450.24] two different things
[3451.00 - 3454.68] okay a lot of people will use they'll
[3453.12 - 3458.52] see barley grass cheese powder but they
[3454.68 - 3461.56] miss the juice the juice so they do
[3458.52 - 3464.00] barley grass powder scratchy it doesn't
[3461.56 - 3466.08] work it doesn't have that play it
[3464.00 - 3467.68] doesn't bind on to the others it doesn't
[3466.08 - 3470.80] act as a binder it doesn't remove
[3467.68 - 3472.28] anything it can't be barley grass it has
[3470.80 - 3473.56] to be barley grass cheese powder so we
[3472.28 - 3475.76] threw that in
[3473.56 - 3478.16] there all right all right crack open a
[3475.76 - 3478.16] delicious
[3479.00 - 3482.68] orange a little bit on there if you want
[3481.00 - 3484.00] to use coconut water you can put coconut
[3482.68 - 3486.52] water in there
[3484.00 - 3488.16] too you can do that putting a little bit
[3486.52 - 3490.96] of orange in there if you want to do

[3639.36 - 3646.88] whoa I can pour a little bit more to the
[3643.56 - 3646.88] top there we
[3648.20 - 3656.40] are and that is the heavy metal detox
[3653.00 - 3658.00] smoothie version can make smoothie Bowl
[3656.40 - 3659.64] you can just eat these five ingredients
[3658.00 - 3661.96] throughout the course of the day just
[3659.64 - 3663.84] make sure it's on the same day that bit
[3661.96 - 3667.16] of information is
[3663.84 - 3669.84] powerful powerful it's
[3667.16 - 3673.04] empowering
[3669.84 - 3676.40] um I'm excited about this because I am
[3673.04 - 3677.76] hungry now there's this congealing thing
[3676.40 - 3678.92] that happens and I talked about this the
[3677.76 - 3683.60] other
[3678.92 - 3685.56] day the the inusa fium that wild
[3683.60 - 3689.32] blueberry
[3685.56 - 3691.60] congeals the most has the highest
[3689.32 - 3692.92] congealing factor that I've been able to
[3691.60 - 3696.08] find out
[3692.92 - 3700.08] there and that's part of the whole
[3696.08 - 3703.44] binding part so with the wild blueberry
[3700.08 - 3706.72] does it helps to get the metals out of
[3703.44 - 3710.08] organs but it also has an intense
[3706.72 - 3712.32] binding quality for the intestinal tract
[3710.08 - 3714.44] something sodium bicarbonate cannot do
[3712.32 - 3716.56] something corilla cannot do something
[3714.44 - 3720.12] zeolite cannot do something bentonite
[3716.56 - 3724.88] clay canot do something charcoal cannot
[3720.12 - 3726.96] do it can't do no can do no can do but
[3724.88 - 3729.64] this is that incredible and that
[3726.96 - 3732.76] powerful
[3729.64 - 3736.28] right so
[3732.76 - 3738.24] good hands down
[3736.28 - 3742.00] delicious and what I like to do is when
[3738.24 - 3744.84] I'm when I'm consuming the heavy metal
[3742.00 - 3746.36] detox I'm not consuming any heavy metal
[3744.84 - 3748.60] meaning I'm not out there purposely
[3746.36 - 3751.84] consuming heavy metals but when I
[3748.60 - 3754.60] consume the heavy metal
[3751.84 - 3757.76] detox what a what a feeling when you're
[3754.60 - 3760.80] getting it in you every day keep a
[3757.76 - 3764.32] journal mark it
[3760.80 - 3766.84] down keep a journal and Mark it down
[3764.32 - 3770.04] that's what I do I did one today I did
[3766.84 - 3771.04] one another day I did another one I did
[3770.04 - 3774.84] another
[3771.04 - 3776.80] one keep a journal and Mark it down and

[3781.48 - 3785.92] get that to a point where you're like
[3782.84 - 3788.64] doing every day for the
[3785.92 - 3790.60] month and a lot of people they do it
[3788.64 - 3792.84] once a week they do it every three days
[3790.60 - 3795.12] they do it once in a while but try to
[3792.84 - 3797.56] keep track so you know you're doing it
[3795.12 - 3798.88] enough you're doing it for a few days a
[3797.56 - 3801.28] week and then you're doing it for four
[3798.88 - 3802.52] days a week and you're mve up 5 days a
