1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:06,440
heavy metals are the

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,679
rulers of Life on planet Earth toxic

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:12,759
heavy metals get into people's brains

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,240
and then Metals speak for the person I

5
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:16,480
know I've said that before right you

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,000
maybe may have heard that Metals talk

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,640
for the

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,240
person metals can make us highly

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,640
emotional highly sensitive metals can

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,599
make us so

11
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:31,080
depressed suicidal that's what metals

12
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:32,640
can do no one would ever no no one would

13
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,719
ever know you're living your life you're

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,440
going through life and you're suicidal

15
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,760
you're going through life and you're

16
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:41,640
depressed you're going through life and

17
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,760
you got high anxiety and panic and Chaos

18
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,120
you feel like it's happening internally

19
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,920
and you've been to every doctor and

20
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,399
every psychiatrist and every therapist

21
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,000
and you've been here you've been there

22
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:52,239
years are going by and you're just

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,840
somebody told you you're up and down

24
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,160
you're bipolar so now you're up you're

25
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,879
down you're all over the place another

26
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,559
person said you got depersonalization

27
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,239
that's what those symptoms are is

28
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,840
depersonalization another person is like

29
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,280
oh you got OCD another person like you

30
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:09,400
got Tourette's Metals run the gamut in

31
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:14,360
our brain they take over our brain and

32
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:17,000
then they change things in our brain

33
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:19,600
metals can do this they are the rulers

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,520
here on planet Earth they truly are

35
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,560
people don't realize this and hopefully

36
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,680
someday they do a lot of people have

37
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:30,680
mercury lead

38
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:34,079
cadmium arsenic aluminum nickel

39
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:35,439
copper the list goes on what you'll find

40
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,520
out there is there's a trendy thing

41
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:40,560
where copper is good for you they say

42
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,360
it's not me saying that but copper is

43
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,280
good for you we're missing copper we

44
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,759
don't have enough copper you can drink

45
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,159
out of copper you know things and

46
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:50,320
thermoses and mugs and all these

47
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,640
different stuff and people think that

48
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,079
that's a good thing they think well in

49
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:57,079
Ancient Ancient times they had copper

50
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:58,840
and copper held the water and people

51
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:01,680
used it as an

52
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:04,880
antimicrobial but they also got copper

53
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:07,000
poisoning which created Madness you know

54
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,360
that's a thing that people don't realize

55
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,840
so the exposure to Copper is so great so

56
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,959
I want to hit that right away cuz I know

57
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,920
some so many people are like you need

58
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,640
copper you need

59
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:20,040
copper zinc gets rid of your copper you

60
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,560
need copper this guy over here says zinc

61
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,080
gets rid of Co you know you hear it all

62
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,239
the time out there have you guys heard

63
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,239
that what people don't realize is we're

64
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:30,080
inundated with copper first of all

65
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:33,800
copper is high in all the fruit fruits

66
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:37,000
and vegetables and herbs and

67
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:40,120
spices copper is in everything it's in

68
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,400
meat it's in chicken copper is in every

69
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:45,319
vegetable copper is in avocados avocados

70
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,840
are high in copper copper is in

71
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:48,840
everything and there's two forms of

72
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,680
copper that are in everything there's

73
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,840
the natural Trace mineral

74
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,519
copper that's in the earth and then

75
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:02,400
there's the industrialized copper that's

76
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:05,879
in the earth two kind of copper is in

77
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,159
food we have so much access to Copper we

78
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:10,640
are not copper deficient we are far from

79
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,640
it we are over inundated with copper we

80
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,799
have too much copper and it WS havoc in

81
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,280
us it's one of the toxic heavy metals

82
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:19,560
copper so many people have mercury in

83
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,000
them but it's passed on through

84
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,159
generation to generation to generation

85
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,879
we get our Mercury from our parents

86
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:28,319
parents get our Mercury from their

87
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,879
parents their parents get the Mercury

88
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,879
from their parents it goes on and on and

89
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:33,680
on back back back back you can go a

90
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:36,760
th000 years you can go 2,000 years you

91
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,560
can go 3,000 years and that mercury

92
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:42,799
trans it just basically transforms

93
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:45,200
itself back into our own body it becomes

94
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:48,439
something in our own body passed along

95
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,040
from Generations ago and generations ago

96
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:52,319
and we end up with

97
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,920
Mercury lots of toxic heavy metals we

98
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,720
can pass on generation Generation

99
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:59,640
generation but Mercury's a big one

100
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:01,879
Mercury we really pass that one on gener

101
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:04,159
generation after generation and that

102
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:06,879
mercury can sit inside our brain and it

103
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:10,000
can be thousands of years old you can

104
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:12,400
have mercury inside your brain that is a

105
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,159
thousand years old like where did it

106
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,680
come from what's going on passed from

107
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,320
generation to

108
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:21,479
generation that's the kind of metals

109
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,720
that are stored inside of us but I don't

110
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:25,720
have any Metals what the heck metals are

111
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,040
not my problem I got a little depression

112
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,840

metal metal and metals and metals we're

121
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:50,039
going to go into little detail on Metals

122
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:51,199
I'm also making the heavy metal detox

123
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:53,880
today so

124
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,680
hmds medical medium heavy metal detox

125
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,560
smoothie what you see in front of me

126
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,039

00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,800
some bananas and so forth a little

136
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,960
coconut water too in the glass I might

137
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,680
do something with that and we got the

138
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,440
blender so we're making the heavy metal

139
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,720
detox smoothie how many of you guys are

140
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,479
on the

141
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:31,199
hmds I know a lot of you guys

142
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:36,400
are a lot of you guys are so let's get

143
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,400
into it a little bit okay all

144
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:43,960
right Alloys so what happens in our

145
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:46,199
brain is we get metals and they mix they

146
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:49,880
mix we get a little bit of copper

147
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:52,240
aluminum Mercury in our brain and then

148
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:55,960
they blend together how do they do that

149
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:59,479
they Forge into an alloy through brain

150
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:02,960
heat if you're upset your brain heats up

151
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:05,319
you get emotional your brain heats up if

152
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,120
you're exercising and you're exercising

153
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:09,680
and exercising and you're working out

154
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,960
you're working out your brain heats up

155
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,080
if you're experiencing immense Joy your

156
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,400
brain heats up if you're experiencing

157
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,720
immense pain and suffering your brain

158
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:22,440
heats up if you're actually challenged

159
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:24,319
emotionally and you are under stress and

160
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,759
you are struggling emotionally your

161
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:31,199
brain heats up and when our brain heats

162
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:34,520
up the metals inside our brain can get

163
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,240
hot they can get hot and they do the

164
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,560
electricity inside of our brain

165
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,360
electrical impulses that are going round

166
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,880
and around and around and around right

167
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,440
in our brain those electrical impulses

168
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:48,400
swimming around that electrical grid as

169
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,840
that electrical grid is going going

170
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,360
going going getting hotter and hotter

171
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:55,360
and hotter any little bit of metal

172
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:58,599
that's sitting anywhere in in any neuron

173
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:01,680
any gal cell anywhere in the brain gets

174
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:03,960
hot and Mercury will snuggle next to

175
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,039
aluminum aluminum will snuggle next to

176
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:09,120
copper copper will snuggle next to lead

177
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:12,800
and so forth and these Metals sit inside

178
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:15,759
of our brain and then we have emotional

179
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,879
experiences stress relationship breakup

180
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,720
something happen somebody betrays you

181
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:22,039
maybe somebody cheated on you maybe a

182
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:24,520
friend did something maybe a coworker

183
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:25,879
did something maybe life is just unfair

184
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:29,680
maybe somebody else did something

185
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:31,240
whatever happened we H gone under some

186
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,120
kind of emotional struggle in some kind

187
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,280
of emotional situation our brain heats

188
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:39,800
up and then any kind of metal inside of

189
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:43,639
our brain forges and binds into each

190
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:45,599
other and becomes an alloy I call it the

191
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:48,680
alloy

192
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:50,919
brain normally the viruses that are in

193
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:54,919
our body that are responsible for

194
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:58,000
autoimmune love Metals I always say to

195
00:07:54,919 --> 00:08:02,120
people all these years we can get rid of

196
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:05,440
our viruses work on that but we can also

197
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:08,400
get rid of our metals and work on that

198
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:11,080
the sicker people and the sickest people

199
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,319
got the viruses the pathogens right and

200
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:17,000
they got the

201
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:19,319
metals the sickest people have the viral

202
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,400
pathogens and the

203
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:25,840
metals people with ALS multiple

204
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:30,000
sclerosis neurological problems chronic

205
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:31,360
fatigue syndrome me or just CFS

206
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,519
bad

207
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:37,399
fibromyalgia lime disease all of it

208
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,800
pathogens and

209
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:44,000
metals people who actually have more

210
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:47,760
metal suffer more people who have more

211
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:51,000
pathogens suffer more you have but the

212
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:53,240
combination is really hard so many

213
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,760
people live a miserable life they

214
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,320
struggle and they suffer because they

215
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:59,800
have both pathogens and metals they have

216
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,399
the combination so what I like to to do

217
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,839
is I'd like to get the medals out so

218
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:05,600
let's talk about that a little bit why

219
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,279
are so many people healing in the

220
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,680
medical medium Community the largest

221
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:12,000
community in health worldwide by far and

222
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,160
the largest community in health that

223
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,959
actually has the most people healing

224
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:20,399
worldwide that came to this community

225
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:23,440
devast devastatingly sick chronically

226
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,160
sick terrifyingly sick the sickest

227
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,720
people come to the medical medium

228
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:30,320
information the sickest people out there

229
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:32,360
in the world come to medical medium

230
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,600
information so you have to think about

231
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,240
this okay I mean we have some people

232
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:39,360
that didn't come here that sick we do

233
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,839
have that but if you look out there and

234
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,079
you see what's going on out there you'll

235
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:45,880
see this person this trainer has this

236
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:47,839
this person has that out there this this

237
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:50,040
you know doctor has this out there this

238
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:53,160
practitioner has this out there but they

239
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:56,360
don't have the sickest people on the

240
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:58,680
planet coming to them and the medical me

241
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:01,160
information is there for the sickest

242
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:04,279
people and the sickest people are high

243
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:06,480
in metal and they're high in pathogens

244
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:08,640
and that's just how it

245
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,160
works and a host of other things that

246
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,320
medical medum information talks about

247
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:16,160
right a whole bunch of that

248
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:18,640
stuff why does the hmds why does the

249
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,640
heavy metal detox smoothie work why does

250
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,480
the heavy metal detox

251
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:26,360
work

252
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,920
why what I mean by work meaning you

253
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,480
start getting rid of the depression you

254
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,200
start getting rid of the OCD you start

255
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:34,360
getting rid of anxiety you start feeling

256
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,839
better your CFS starts to come calm down

257
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:39,600
your fibro starts to drop your

258
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:43,200
neurological lime starts to improve your

259
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,680
Ms starts to improve and heal why and

260
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,880
many other symptoms too including ezema

261
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:52,079
psoriasis severe dermatitis all these

262
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:54,000
different things rosacea why does it get

263
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:57,639
better because when you're removing the

264
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:02,160
metals you're taking one of the most

265
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:05,360
potent Foods there are for the bugs away

266
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:07,680
you're taking the most potent foods for

267
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:11,160
the bugs you're removing those Foods

268
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:14,440
away from the bugs think about

269
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:17,600
that so as you remove Metals you're

270
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:22,760
removing the very food from the Epstein

271
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:27,920
bar the hh6 the hh7 the hh10 through 16

272
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:30,519
the hsv1 hsv2 C cyto virus right ceglar

273
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,639
virus you're removing all of the food

274
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:34,040
from that bug from those bugs the

275
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:36,240
shingles

276
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:39,160
viruses and then once you remove that

277
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:42,160
food the metal then that virus and that

278
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:44,920
pathogen becomes less less aggressive it

279
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:47,680
becomes more docile it

280
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:50,760
weakens and you start to

281
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:52,560
heal someone comes to me and they say w

282
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:55,360
what should I start with first what

283
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,079
should I do I'm sick I've had this this

284
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,200
this this this I've been to this many

285
00:11:57,079 --> 00:12:01,480
doctors what do I do

286
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,720
I'll be like did you start with the

287
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,720
heavy metal

288
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,720
detox did you work on getting the metals

289
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:11,560
out did you start with some of the

290
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:13,120
antiviral protocols what are you doing

291
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,320
and then if they do the heavy metal

292
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,440
detox what happens is you start getting

293
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,480
those Metals out of your body they come

294
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,120
out of your liver and your brain and

295
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:24,639
then something changes all of a sudden

296
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:26,240
you're starving the pathogens that are

297
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:31,399
keeping you down because this is how it

298
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:35,880
works okay a pathogen will feed on

299
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:35,880
metal and when a pathogen feeds on

300
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,320
metal

301
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:44,320
right so you got the pathogens in you

302
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:47,480
everybody's got the pathogens in them

303
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:51,040
that's right you better believe they do

304
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:53,440
fever blister anybody cold sores anybody

305
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,920
oh yeah oh no I get cold SES all the

306
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,279
time and uh my sister gets cold sores

307
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,160
all the time and my mom got cold sores

308
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:02,120
for a year this we got a family of cold

309
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:05,079
sores that's what we have fever blisters

310
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:07,760
hsv1 right so you got the cold sore

311
00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:09,880
virus okay yeah I had Mono I had Mono

312
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,639
before yeah that's Epstein bar you've

313
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:15,000
had Mono before exactly and then you got

314
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,720
all these pathogens right here right

315
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,320
could put happy faces on them because

316
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:22,639
these pathogens are really happy because

317
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:25,160
they're eating metal and then all of a

318
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:27,800
sudden we get exposed to toxic heavy

319
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:30,680
metals in so many different various ways

320
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:32,399
just the simplest ways every time to

321
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:34,639
this day I hear about somebody using an

322
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,079
alkaline ionizer water machine and I

323
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,279
don't care which brand it is every time

324
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:42,399
I see that I'm like oh yeah you give it

325
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:45,639
10 years you give it 10 years drinking

326
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:47,680
that water cuz those plates will just

327
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:49,959
blow up in there and they'll just

328
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:53,360
corrode and the metal that will be going

329
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:56,639
into your body from those

330
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,279
machines is just

331
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,680
unbelievable or if you're somebody

332
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:00,880
that's drinking the copper thermoses and

333
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,839
the copper mugs and the whole bit

334
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,800
because you think that's

335
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:06,800
healthy or you're somebody that's

336
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,120
exposed to aluminum foil or you have

337
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,480
Metals in you already that are

338
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,399
percolating we're going to go into that

339
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:15,320
a little bit so Metals Metals enter into

340
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:17,680
our body so many different various ways

341
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:18,680
they come on in and when the metals come

342
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,680
on

343
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:25,079
in guess

344
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:27,680
what they don't come out Metals go in

345
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:29,720
and never come out Metals go in and

346
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,399
never come out

347
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:35,759
Metals arrive and they never leave they

348
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,959
never leave they go in and they enter

349
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:39,440
the organs is what they do but we got

350
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:41,800
pathogens in us and when we have

351
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:45,120
pathogens in us the pathogens love to

352
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:48,800
eat and Gobble up the metal copper

353
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:51,560
Mercury pathogens eat and when they eat

354
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:54,800
they that's what happens why are we

355
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:58,839
sick mm info right

356
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:02,240
here mind-blowing information from so

357
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:04,279
mind-blowing pathogens feed off of the

358
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,279
metals that come

359
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:10,120
in and when pathogens feed off the

360
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:12,519
metals

361
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:15,800
right they then

362
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:17,480
 here you go they

363
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:22,120
poop

364
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:25,759
excrement right out of them there you go

365
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:27,560
okay pathogens feed off of the metal and

366
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:30,880
then release the metal and then the

367
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,880
metal becomes a a

368
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:35,079
neurotoxin it becomes a

369
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:46,759
neurotoxin and uh someone on there saw a

370
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:46,759
comment saying are you grumpy ew am I

371
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:55,160
grumpy it's hard to stay super happy

372
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,880
when somebody people do things that just

373
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,720
aren't good for them out there you

374
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,199
should see it out there you guys know a

375
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,360
lot of people do a lot of things that

376
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:05,279
aren't good for them all right so I just

377
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,040
wanted to run that by you a little bit

378
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,920
so what we do is we have these epscene

379
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:12,240
bars we have these jles viruses we have

380
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:14,800
these hhv 6s yeah yeah we have the

381
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,680
simplexes in us and what happens and

382
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,880
then we collect more we go out and

383
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:22,240
collect more it's like sure I will

384
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:24,399
gladly collect another virus from you

385
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,600
definitely okay let me go here and

386
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:30,839
collect another one they're easy to

387
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:36,360
collect these days it's very easy to get

388
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:36,360
viruses and pathogens very easy there we

389
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,079
go what people don't realize with Metals

390
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:46,560
okay is they

391
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:49,440
Forge okay so we got

392
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:53,000
Mercury we got

393
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:56,720
copper like my my handwriting it's not

394
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,880
so great well what are you going to do

395
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:02,759
and so Mercury and copper love to

396
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:06,439
snuggle they love to forge they find

397
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:08,559
their way to each other is what they do

398
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:11,120
they find a way to each other they're

399
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:13,520
attracted to each other inside the body

400
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:17,039
Mercury and copper do you ever have a

401
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:20,559
filling removed no you haven't right not

402
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:22,919
to worry then your family members might

403
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:25,120
have your parents and their parents

404
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:26,520
might have your grandparents might have

405
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,400
had a whole bunch of mercury fillings

406
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,840
put

407
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:32,080
in and then their grandparents had a

408
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,720
whole bunch of mercury fillings put in

409
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,080
and it could even go further back than

410
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,440
that with Mercury fillings put in and

411
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,559
those Mercury feeling I've seen people

412
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,919
like I never had a Mercury filling

413
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:44,320
because I'm a younger person and I never

414
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,520
had that they didn't offer it they

415
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:49,559
offered a different composite it's like

416
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:52,160
don't worry you got plenty in you from

417
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:54,760
your grandparents and their parents and

418
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,600
your plenty of mercury in you it goes a

419
00:17:54,760 --> 00:18:00,600
long way a long

420
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:02,760
way copper and Merc Mercury combine and

421
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:06,200
when we get upset and we get

422
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:08,280
emotional and something Jacks us up and

423
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:11,640
we're just like we're

424
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:15,240
lit and we're on fire for some

425
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:19,320
reason brain heat occurs all this brain

426
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:24,400
heat occurs right when that brain heat

427
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:26,919
occurs that electricity starts to cook

428
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:30,039
Metals electricity in our

429
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:32,080
brain hits that metal like no other and

430
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:34,280
then the forging process happens you got

431
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,559
a little copper inside your brain you

432
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:38,240
got a little mercury inside your brain

433
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:41,320
now you're

434
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:45,120
upset something gets you

435
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:48,200
angry angry something gets you upset I'm

436
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,400
writing really sloppy tonight something

437
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,600
gets you

438
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:55,400
upset and really

439
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:57,320
a maybe somebody just pissed you off and

440
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,799
then brain heat occurred and then the

441
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:02,200
copper and the Mercury start to forge

442
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:05,200
together from that heat it takes time it

443
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:08,880
takes time but it happens and then it

444
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:12,600
becomes one and now what you have right

445
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:14,480
here after they Forge is an alloy now

446
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:17,840
the copper and the Mercury copper the

447
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:21,120
Mercury are now one that makes things

448
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,120
worse and

449
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:26,480
then a bug comes

450
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:30,039
along little

451
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:32,080
virus awakens your immune system is low

452
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:36,559
your old mono virus starts to come out

453
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:39,360
the old EBV Epstein bar starts to come

454
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:42,159
out and what does it do it stumbles

455
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:46,039
across an alloy a combination of copper

456
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:47,400
and mercury and it gobbles it up what a

457
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:50,400
mess on this

458
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:52,880
board and when it gobbles it up it goes

459
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,679
to the bathroom and when that epine bar

460
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:59,200
goes to the

461
00:19:54,679 --> 00:20:00,919
bathroom that's neurotoxin right there

462
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,280
neurotoxin that

463
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:07,480
neurotoxin can create anything

464
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:10,000
anything Vagas nerve issues tightness of

465
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:12,080
the chest tightness of the throat

466
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,559
vibrations all kinds of different stuff

467
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:17,039
going on nerve

468
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:20,200
Sensations ticks and spasms and aches

469
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:23,960
and pains and everything else and

470
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:27,480
fatigue yeah fatigue brain

471
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:29,679
fog all that neurotoxin pouring out of

472
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:32,080
that epine virus that just had that

473
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:34,640
copper in Mercury it's releasing that

474
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:38,240
neurotoxin into your bloodstream and

475
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,240
when it releases it into your blood

476
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:43,120
stream it starts to circulate float

477
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:45,360
around gets to the brain gets to the

478
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,200
nervous system hits the Vegas nerve

479
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:50,400
start starts to weaken the Vegas nerve

480
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,720
hits the cranial nerves and gets us sick

481
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,960
and now we don't know what's wrong where

482
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,919
what how we have no idea we're going

483
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:00,360
everywhere we're looking for help we're

484
00:20:56,919 --> 00:21:04,240
doing castor oil p P we're doing Cod

485
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:06,559
Liver Oil we're doing sodium bicarbonate

486
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,640
we're trying to drink alkaline water

487
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:11,240
we're just looking looking looking we're

488
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,840
doing keto we're doing blood we're doing

489
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:17,840
this we're doing you name it we're doing

490
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:21,600
dious Earth particles which I strongly

491
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:25,120
strongly advise to my family and my

492
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,120
friends never to

493
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:31,679
do because it lowers the immune system

494
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,840
and then we're looking we're looking for

495
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:37,960
answers and all kinds of stuff you guys

496
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:40,720
I just saw somebody ask I shall deliver

497
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:43,279
the brains saver book right here that's

498
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,919
the book I'm in right now check it out

499
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:47,880
get it free at the library if you can or

500
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:51,320
just go to

501
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:52,720
amazon.com so let's go into Metals a

502
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:56,559
little bit more I would love to talk a

503
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:58,640
little bit about it okay beyond the

504
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:00,520
damage that toxic metals themselves can

505
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,640
do there's the truth that they act as

506
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:06,440
viral fuel so you got to understand

507
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:10,159
something it's critical to get Metals

508
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:12,799
out critical somebody may not have a lot

509
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,480
of viral issues or viral load they might

510
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:16,279
not have a low- grade viral infection

511
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,200
they might not have a highgrade viral

512
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:20,240
infection they may not have a big viral

513
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,279
load but they got a lot of metals and

514
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:26,039
then all of a sudden one day happens

515
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:28,440
where they pick up a virus and it all

516
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:30,760
just explodes on them I was healthy I

517
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:32,000
was doing good I don't understand and

518
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,200
they're backtracking in their mind I

519
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,679
remember when I was healthy I was doing

520
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,000
fine I was doing fine and then they're

521
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:37,240
doing their affirmations and they're

522
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,279
talking to themselves and then they're

523
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,799
talking to their their practitioners and

524
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:42,520
their doctors and they're like you don't

525
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:44,600
understand I was just fine the other

526
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:47,039
week and now I'm sick I was just fine

527
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:50,000
months ago a year ago I was fine I was

528
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:51,760
doing good and now I'm sick why why why

529
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,559
nobody knows it they were loaded with

530
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:57,000
metals and then something happened

531
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:58,919
either they contracted a virus or they

532
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,279
just had a virus come out of dormy

533
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:02,320
because their immune system got lowered

534
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:04,440
for some reason or another and a virus

535
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:07,799
came out and it gobbled up the metals

536
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:09,799
and boom overnight they had the worst

537
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:12,880
Sensations and the

538
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:14,600
worst symptoms the brain fog and the

539
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,799
aches and pains and the tingles and

540
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:19,440
numbness and the neurological Sensations

541
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:22,279
and the trigeminal

542
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:24,600
neuralgia and so much more and they're

543
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:28,200
struggling because it was the perfect

544
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:30,520
perfect recipe The Perfect Storm it was

545
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:34,120
the bug eating the metals at just the

546
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:35,559
right time and that's it they went down

547
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,559
and now they're living a life where it's

548
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:39,240
all about their health and only about

549
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:40,760
their health and they just weren't there

550
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:44,080
before they don't know what that's like

551
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,080
and they never experienced that

552
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,279
before I want to read a little bit

553
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:51,840
something to you real quick if that's

554
00:23:48,279 --> 00:23:55,039
okay if you guys will let me do

555
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,880
that okay melting down when our brains

556
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:58,600
get hot and there's metal involved

557
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,240
because that's what happens

558
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:02,880
we're loaded with all these metals and

559
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,679
it becomes an alloy right the toxic

560
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:08,600
heavy metal particles break down the

561
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:10,320
metals melt they actually melt inside

562
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:13,159
our brain toxic heavy metals in the

563
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:16,120
brain get wear and tear when electricity

564
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:17,799
currents are entering them they start to

565
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:20,320
change did you ever notice somebody

566
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:22,440
changing did you ever see somebody

567
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:25,559
change like you don't even know who they

568
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:29,279
are like I don't even know who you are

569
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:31,240
man like I've known for years but you're

570
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:35,120
something's just changing about you what

571
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:36,840
is it like I don't even like who are you

572
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,919
who are you now this you could see in

573
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,039
somebody that has Alzheimer's right this

574
00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:42,559
you can see with somebody who has

575
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:44,320
dementia you could really see it then

576
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:46,159
because it's just so obvious and you're

577
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,679
just like whoa something's wrong and

578
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,799
that's from toxic heavy metals and

579
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,840
that's original medical medum

580
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:54,600
information but it's from toxic heavy

581
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:56,640
metals causing the Alzheimer's right and

582
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:58,360
dementia but what happens is if you're

583
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,440
not diagnosed with Al Alzheimer's and

584
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:02,320
it's not so apparent and it's not so

585
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,840
visible and it's not on that scale at

586
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,799
all it's not about losing your memory

587
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,880
it's not about going into some kind of

588
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:11,520
mania it's not about any of

589
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:13,240
that it's just about everyday living in

590
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:16,679
life and you're just like why is that

591
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:18,159
what that person's changing what is it

592
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:21,080
about

593
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,679
them a lot of times that's metals that

594
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:24,440
have melted and they have melted

595
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:27,440
together and they're forging and they're

596
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:30,840
changing and that's what that is metals

597
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:33,200
that forg together their shapes change

598
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:35,559
so metals that enter our body or have

599
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:39,000
been in our body since we were born end

600
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:42,200
up changing over time corrosion can

601
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,799
occur as well the metals corrode so I

602
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,440
want to show you that really quick we're

603
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:49,159
going to make the heavy metal detox

604
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:51,200
smoothie I love that and we're talking

605
00:25:49,159 --> 00:25:54,520
about heavy metal detox I want to talk

606
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:57,320
about like blood testing for Metals I

607
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:59,170
want to talk about urine samples for

608
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,960
metals

609
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:03,440
[Music]

610
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:06,720
right all

611
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,799
right cuz that's important too the metal

612
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:12,399
goes

613
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:15,360
in the metal particles go in okay they

614
00:26:12,399 --> 00:26:17,399
go in a certain shape and size

615
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,360
Industrial Metals that go into us all

616
00:26:17,399 --> 00:26:23,360
the time in so many various way did you

617
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:23,360
have fast food metals were in

618
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:30,840
it that's just one thing but what

619
00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:32,240
happens is metals tend to melt as we

620
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,960
have electricity running through our

621
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,840
brain and electrical impulses are

622
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:37,760
hitting the metal particles and they

623
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,120
tend to melt when they melt they they

624
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,840
change shape and all of a sudden they

625
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:44,399
have a different shape to them they're

626
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:45,080
not the same shape anymore they came in

627
00:26:44,399 --> 00:26:47,919
kind

628
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:49,679
of off shape in a different way but now

629
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,840
they've changed all the shapes have

630
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:55,559
changed and when that

631
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:57,880
does happen we

632
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:59,600
change when the shape of the metal

633
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:02,520
changes that has entered our body

634
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:04,960
because it's melting we

635
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:06,320
change you can't really tell at first

636
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,559
with a lot of people but then you can

637
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,960
tell later or if someone hasn't seen

638
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:12,360
somebody in a long time and then they

639
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:14,960
see them and they see how different they

640
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:17,760
are in different various ways there's a

641
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,760
changing that

642
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:23,159
occurred all right

643
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:25,559
so I want to look a little more into

644
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:28,520
this another reason brain conditions

645
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:30,399
worsen with time is that more toxic

646
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,880
heavy metals continue to collect and

647
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:34,080
this is the next part I want to say

648
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:36,760
right here so you got these Metals right

649
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:40,120
there in you and then more Metals come

650
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:42,679
in every day every year and they come in

651
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:44,679
and they find their way and they collect

652
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:47,399
they bind on to the metals that are

653
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:50,320
already in you deposits in the brain can

654
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:53,399
get bigger so as more Metals stream in

655
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:57,519
like this they find the metal deposits

656
00:27:53,399 --> 00:28:00,640
and then they actually enlarge the metal

657
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:03,000
starts to accumulate more metal occurs

658
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,559
and grows because the more metal going

659
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,799
into the body actually it goes and finds

660
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:11,039
the other metal in your body they both

661
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:13,120
join hands and now you're getting metal

662
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:16,440
deposits and if somebody has a big metal

663
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:19,600
deposit if someone has a really big one

664
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:22,960
you better believe it so many people do

665
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:24,640
they got big metal deposits

666
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:28,480
seizures

667
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:32,679
seizures big metal deposits

668
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:33,519
okay so if someone has a big deposit in

669
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:38,000
their

670
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:42,120
brain or two big deposits in their brain

671
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,120
okay and maybe a smaller

672
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:49,840
one and more metals are coming

673
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:52,159
in they find these big deposits these

674
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:54,120
deposits get bigger 10 years down the

675
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:56,720
road the deposit is even bigger 20 years

676
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:58,799
it's even bigger you're 50 years old now

677
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,399
the deposit ETS are bigger because

678
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,840
you're not getting medals out you're not

679
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:04,480
taking care of yourself on that level

680
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,200
nobody's teaching you nobody knows or if

681
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,600
you hear about Metals now you'll be like

682
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:10,919
let me try Zite it doesn't work or let

683
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:12,480
me try this it doesn't work or let me

684
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:15,679
try something else it doesn't work you

685
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:19,240
don't get the metals out it's smoking

686
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:21,000
mirrors it's critical Metals come out

687
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:25,519
there's no

688
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:28,919
games no time for games no time for

689
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:31,440
BS the medals have to to come out can't

690
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:32,840
do make believe crap where you all of a

691
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,919
sudden this is good for medal somebody

692
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:36,720
says and this is good for medals and

693
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:38,600
somebody says out there because it's

694
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,480
like an industry it's it's everybody's

695
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:43,080
just eating each other alive out there

696
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,799
to try to make a buck right but we got

697
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,600
to take it serious with the chronic Leo

698
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:48,559
because there ain't no time left for a

699
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:51,000
lot of people who are sick because

700
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:54,120
they've been sick for so long they have

701
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,519
to get the stuff out of their system so

702
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:57,919
they could live their

703
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:59,679
life the more metal they go goes in US

704
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:01,919
it hits the big deposits that create

705
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:03,799
seizure say or just sickness of all

706
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:06,440
kinds or severe PR fatigue or whatever

707
00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:08,640
it is because it's feeding viruses as

708
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:11,240
more metal comes in the deposits get

709
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:14,960
bigger and they swell sometimes they'll

710
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:18,519
get so big that neurons start to Short

711
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,519
Circuit so as your

712
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:22,679
neurons right in your brain all these

713
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,880
neurons I'm going to draw a few neurons

714
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:26,200
right here you guys okay with that if

715
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,399
you if you're not caught up to what I'm

716
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:31,360
doing you just rolled in here these are

717
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:36,080
big heavy metal deposits right here

718
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:39,200
these three deposits inside of our brain

719
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:41,720
okay more metal coming in is making them

720
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,200
bigger your neurons which are these I'm

721
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:45,000
going to string them together you're

722
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,799
okay with

723
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,240
that shinging these neurons together

724
00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:52,919
just for

725
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:57,440
fun okay what happens is these deposits

726
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:59,399
get so big they impede the neuron so now

727
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,440
they're walking themselves into the

728
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:04,039
neurons as they're walking themselves

729
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,760
into the neurons your memory is going as

730
00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:09,000
they're walking themselves into the

731
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,000
neurons you're getting

732
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:14,639
Parkinson as you're walking into these

733
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:17,320
neurons you're struggling with all kinds

734
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:19,519
of neurological

735
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:22,399
symptoms and that's what happens more

736
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:25,960
metal goes in the metal deposits get

737
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:28,320
bigger and then they rub against neurons

738
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:29,799
and they start to D and then the next

739
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:33,799
part happens right

740
00:31:29,799 --> 00:31:36,919
there the next part is the neurons get

741
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:41,240
corroded the metal corrodes and the

742
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:44,000
metal corrodes and then it out gases and

743
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:46,919
deposits come off of it and that's next

744
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,880
I'll give you that quick rund down cuz

745
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:52,600
we got stuff to

746
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:54,960
do so here's your neurons right here

747
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,960
bunch of

748
00:31:55,799 --> 00:32:00,159
neurons right there they are we're

749
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:03,840
stringing them all

750
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:06,720
together there they are all that tissue

751
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:10,440
okay and then there's the metal here it

752
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:12,919
is a big old metal deposit see it right

753
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:15,159
here a big old metal deposit right here

754
00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:17,360
it's growing bigger and bigger you got

755
00:32:15,159 --> 00:32:20,919
more metal coming in left and right from

756
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:23,880
various places more Metals coming in the

757
00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:26,279
deposits getting bigger and bigger and

758
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:27,880
then what happens is that it pushes

759
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:30,919
against these neurons

760
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:33,760
but worse the metal starts to corrode

761
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:37,880
we're on these really high fat diets the

762
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:40,200
high fat corrodes the metal more we're

763
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:43,159
getting more metal coming in and then it

764
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,760
starts to leech it's like a leech field

765
00:32:43,159 --> 00:32:47,799
these are your neurons here and they

766
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:51,200
start to become dirty your brain gets

767
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:55,639
filthy inside because the metal starts

768
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:58,519
to leech and it starts to leech out gas

769
00:32:55,639 --> 00:33:01,159
and start to corrode and as that Metal's

770
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:03,360
corroding it's entering your neurons see

771
00:33:01,159 --> 00:33:05,519
those beautiful blue neurons right there

772
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:08,519
there you go look at that see those

773
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:11,120
neurons are getting contaminated right

774
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:13,000
there you are and when that happens you

775
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:16,279
wake up one

776
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:19,720
morning and you have a seizure or your

777
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:21,480
first great panic attack or something

778
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:23,320
else you wake up and you just don't know

779
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:25,919
who you are for a moment happens every

780
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:28,960
time for so many people all the time for

781
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:28,960
a lot of people out there

782
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:36,360
people say to me often like why bother

783
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,720
getting Metals out what does it matter

784
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:41,039
it

785
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:43,480
matters because it's something that gets

786
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:46,039
in her way and people don't realize it

787
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:49,639
and they suffer from it and they have to

788
00:33:46,039 --> 00:33:52,279
live with those metals and it is no

789
00:33:49,639 --> 00:33:54,720
fun so think I'll look at one more

790
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:57,159
little thing for you guys old Metals

791
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,760
versus new Metals this isn't important

792
00:33:57,159 --> 00:34:00,799
place to talk about for a moment heavy

793
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:03,279
metals that we inherit have aged to them

794
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:05,240
like I said they're old they go back

795
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:07,559
2,000 3,000

796
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:10,720
years and depending on what part of the

797
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:12,560
world someone's bloodline stems from

798
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:14,200
older heavy metals also have a higher

799
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:17,000
oxidative rate so that's what happens

800
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:19,599
you see someone may have similar amounts

801
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,200
of metals in them than someone else but

802
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:24,119
the oxidative rate is faster in that one

803
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:26,520
person making them sicker and giving

804
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:29,399
them symptoms and sending them downhill

805
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:31,320
the other person has a a slower

806
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:34,359
oxidative rate where the metals are

807
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:37,480
leeching slower so this person they're

808
00:34:34,359 --> 00:34:40,679
leeching faster this person they're

809
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:43,040
leeching slower that also determines so

810
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:45,960
many different symptoms when and

811
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:48,280
how an oxidative countdown occurred as

812
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:50,079
the metals aged those Metals became

813
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:52,320
highly unstable when they entered and

814
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:54,560
sat inside human bodies where metals

815
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,480
were exposed for years and years and

816
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:58,680
years going down our bloodline so what

817
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:01,200
happens is the older the metals are the

818
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:04,320
more we really suffer and so many people

819
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:07,040
are suffering in so such great ways

820
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,680
awful great ways all right so I want to

821
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:11,839
start working on some other stuff too

822
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:13,320
let's let's get into um let's get into

823
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:16,320
the intestinal tract for a couple of

824
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,320
minutes

825
00:35:16,359 --> 00:35:23,240
okay we inhale Metals we eat Metals we

826
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:25,720
breathe in me Metals which is inhaling

827
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:27,720
them we get Metals in our skin we get

828
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:30,119
Metals in our bloodstream every single

829
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:32,200
day and metals circulate throughout our

830
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:35,520
bloodstream every single day and then

831
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:36,440
they find a home so when we eat toxic

832
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:39,119
heavy

833
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:42,000
metals the metals go down into our

834
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:45,720
stomach they go down into our intestinal

835
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,359
tract and they stay there they cling to

836
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:49,319
the walls of the intestinal tract they

837
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:51,440
go up the highway that goes to the liver

838
00:35:49,319 --> 00:35:53,599
the hepatic portal Highway the metals

839
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,119
travel into the liver the liver tries to

840
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:57,079
filter the metals out and then the

841
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,920
metals get trapped inside the liver when

842
00:35:57,079 --> 00:36:02,000
the metals get trapped inside the liver

843
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:06,440
they become food for you know what the

844
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:08,480
bugs the bugs the bugs as the metals are

845
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:10,240
sitting inside the liver so are bugs and

846
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:12,520
the bugs feed off of the metals and next

847
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,200
thing you know it you got yourself some

848
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:17,880
fatigue you

849
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:20,560
cannot explain you don't understand the

850
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:23,680
fatigue you can't explain it you don't

851
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:25,480
know why you have it but it's there and

852
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:29,280
it's just not a matter of you

853
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:31,520
overworking or over exercising or just

854
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,960
even being stressed out fatigue that

855
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:35,800
shouldn't be there sticks around because

856
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:38,240
bugs inside the liver will feed off of

857
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:41,160
those metals and that will happen now

858
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:43,960
people get tested for Metals

859
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:45,280
now it's something that's common since

860
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,880
there's been so much awareness with the

861
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,680
medical medium books all these years and

862
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:50,119
information so they're getting tested

863
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:51,720
for metals and a lot of doctors are like

864
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:53,480
well you don't have really any Metals in

865
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:56,720
here but what people don't realize is

866
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:59,079
they're in the organs spleen pancreas

867
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:02,079
liver inside the stomach tissue the

868
00:36:59,079 --> 00:37:04,920
stomach walls testinal tract walls

869
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:07,560
they're in the heart Metals get into the

870
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:09,960
heart muscle and they hide in there

871
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:12,760
they're in lung tissue metals are in the

872
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:14,440
brain metals are in the spinal cord

873
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,960
metals are in the central nervous system

874
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:18,359
and they sit in there so when you test

875
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:21,119
for Metals you don't really test that

876
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:22,800
high in metal some people do because

877
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:25,359
they're having recent

878
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:28,400
exposures the only way to find Metals

879
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:30,920
through testing and blood testing is a

880
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:33,240
recent exposure that's happening on a

881
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:36,319
daily or weekly

882
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:39,520
basis and when there's a recent

883
00:37:36,319 --> 00:37:41,760
exposure then the blood can you can find

884
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:44,800
Metals inside the

885
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,440
blood if there isn't a recent exposure

886
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:49,520
of a high enough

887
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:52,200
magnitude of enough then it'll just sit

888
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:54,680
deep inside the organs I've been putting

889
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:56,599
this information out there for decades

890
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:59,000
finally the blood labs are starting to

891
00:37:56,599 --> 00:38:01,119
to admit this that metals are sitting

892
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,119
inside organs and they may not be

893
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:07,040
detectable in the

894
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:07,040
bloodstream thanks to mm

895
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:13,280
info okay so let's talk about getting

896
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:16,319
the metals out I'm going to make a heavy

897
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:19,599
metal detox smoothie one that I really

898
00:38:16,319 --> 00:38:22,359
love and you can you can get Metals out

899
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:24,160
in different ways I talk about it in the

900
00:38:22,359 --> 00:38:26,760
books and I had all the way since the

901
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:29,640
beginning that getting three out of the

902
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:32,599
five ingredients is critical three out

903
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:33,880
of the five so you got cant right here

904
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:36,480
that's one of the ingredients right

905
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:40,079
there you got wild blueberries that's

906
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:43,200
another one right there you got Atlantic

907
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:45,920
dols it's another one right there you

908
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:48,720
got spirulina you got barley grass those

909
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:51,359
are two more right there five will give

910
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:53,520
you the best

911
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:54,440
results five ingredients will give you

912
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,880
the best

913
00:38:54,440 --> 00:39:00,079
results but it's important to try to at

914
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:02,119
least get three if you

915
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:03,760
can now a lot of people talk about

916
00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:06,200
chorella and they're like well what

917
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:09,760
about that well that drops the metal it

918
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:12,119
doesn't hold on to it no one even knew

919
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:14,560
it even did anything with

920
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:17,160
metal until I started talking about over

921
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:18,960
the years that it drops metal it drops

922
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:21,160
it and a lot of people don't realize

923
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:23,839
that another thing is zeolites cannot

924
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:27,440
get metal out of the brain

925
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:30,319
keep this as a feather in your

926
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:32,800
cap because this is critical because

927
00:39:30,319 --> 00:39:35,839
it's important to know that Zees will

928
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:40,079
never get toxic heavy metals or any

929
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:43,280
metal out of the brain it's not possible

930
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:46,359
it's basically a clay it can't get

931
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:49,319
Metals out of organs either because it

932
00:39:46,359 --> 00:39:51,359
can't enter an organ there's no zeolite

933
00:39:49,319 --> 00:39:54,720
variety there's no zeolite brand out

934
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:57,599
right now there's no type of Zite that

935
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:59,200
can remove a metal out of a an organ or

936
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:01,760
the

937
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:03,480
brain so when you're using Zees kiss

938
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:07,520
your money

939
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:10,680
goodbye kiss a goodbye very important to

940
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:14,280
know because what people don't realize

941
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:16,960
is if clay can enter your

942
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:21,359
bloodstream if clay can enter your

943
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:23,400
bloodstream on any level if zeolite can

944
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:25,200
enter your bloodstream in any level on

945
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:27,119
any level you'll just have a stroke and

946
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:29,920
a heart attack

947
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:33,920
you'll have a blood clot an aneurysm

948
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:36,160
blood clot or some kind of blood

949
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:38,560
blockage blood vessel

950
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:40,160
blockage because you just can't pump

951
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:43,839
that stuff into your bloodstream and

952
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:46,599
have it swim around it'll get caught up

953
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:50,240
somewhere and you'll die or have a

954
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:53,480
problem so it never enters into your

955
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:55,880
bloodstream it can't never has for

956
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:57,400
anyone and never will very important to

957
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:59,079
understand a couple little topics I

958
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,760
wanted to cover because we're talking

959
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:03,920
about heavy metal

960
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:06,520
detox and I wouldn't recommend a zealite

961
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:09,000
these days because there's

962
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:11,440
cross-contamination of zeolites that

963
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,839
aren't edible so what happens is with

964
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:16,040
manufacturing zeolite

965
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:18,640
products it's

966
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,960
intermixed not on purpose but by

967
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,599
accident with zeolites that are not

968
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:24,000
edible that's a problem all when it's

969
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:25,400
own that create dehydration one of the

970
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,000
reasons why I don't like zeolites is

971
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:32,200
because it dehydr ation issues you lose

972
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:34,560
critical electrolytes you get dehydrated

973
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:36,599
happens like that with all

974
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:38,119
Zees especially the ones that are out

975
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:39,880
there now so these are some of the

976
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:41,760
things that I'm talking about that are

977
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:44,839
really important and that's one of them

978
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:47,800
another another one right here okay very

979
00:41:44,839 --> 00:41:49,520
important you can't get Metals out with

980
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:51,319
charcoal you can't get Metals out of

981
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:55,240
your bloodstream you can't get Metals

982
00:41:51,319 --> 00:41:57,359
out of your organs with charcoal it is

983
00:41:55,240 --> 00:42:02,000
impossible

984
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:06,520
it will not happen it does not

985
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:09,560
happen zealite and charcoal don't

986
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:11,480
work and zealite is just something that

987
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:13,480
goes into your stomach then down your

988
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:17,040
dadum then into your intestinal tract

989
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:18,960
and then out the door that's all it does

990
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:22,040
it can't enter the hepatic portal

991
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:25,760
Highway it can't cross the bloodb brain

992
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:29,200
barrier it can't do any of that it's

993
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:32,520
imposs possible if it did the person

994
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:35,720
would die and have a

995
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:40,880
stroke charcoal goes in the intestinal

996
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:43,200
tract and then goes out it's not a organ

997
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,200
or

998
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:49,280
brain toxic metal removal system so

999
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,520
that's important too to understand I'm

1000
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,800
trying to read comments at the same time

1001
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:55,000
you

1002
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:57,920
guys so now you'll hear out there are so

1003
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:00,920
many that well try try try this try that

1004
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:02,720
that will do it and it doesn't so what I

1005
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:05,400
like I like something with a track

1006
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:10,319
record something that has helped so many

1007
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:10,319
people and turned around autism yes

1008
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:15,280
autism children that couldn't speak

1009
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:15,280
could now

1010
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:21,920
speak turned around all kinds of all

1011
00:43:18,839 --> 00:43:23,440
kinds of different issues in people got

1012
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:25,319
their lives back in so many different

1013
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:27,280
ways got them out of wheelchairs got

1014
00:43:25,319 --> 00:43:29,839
them talking again got them walking

1015
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:32,160
again something with a powerful track

1016
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:34,000
record got their skin better got rid of

1017
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,680
the eczema got rid of the psoriasis got

1018
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,440
rid of all of that that's what I'm

1019
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:40,400
talking about that matters and that's

1020
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:42,480
what we want not something I'm throwing

1021
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,920
together creating some horeshit for

1022
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,400
somebody to actually take or whatever

1023
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:49,040
and you don't know cuz there's no track

1024
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:51,520
record but the medical medium heavy

1025
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:53,920
metal detox has the track record for

1026
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:55,599
years and years and years and has saved

1027
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,760
lives and you guys know many of you guys

1028
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:58,880
have done it

1029
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:00,680
has saved

1030
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,599
lives all right so I'm going to go into

1031
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:03,800
this a little bit I'm going to hit the

1032
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:06,240
wild blueberry for a little bit you guys

1033
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:08,680
got a couple of minutes on this try to

1034
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:13,119
keep it as interesting as possible right

1035
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:16,920
there okay a Canadian wild

1036
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:18,480
blueberry or the main wild

1037
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:22,359
blueberry

1038
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:25,000
right and this right here is the

1039
00:44:22,359 --> 00:44:29,800
ultimate to use in your heavy metal

1040
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:34,599
detox it's this it's the best one to

1041
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:37,440
use now if you can't get a hold of this

1042
00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:38,839
one here which is the wild blueberry

1043
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:42,200
North

1044
00:44:38,839 --> 00:44:44,640
America if you can't get a hold of it I

1045
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:47,280
always say you can do blackberries but

1046
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:50,400
blackberries can only remove a little

1047
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:51,599
bit of metal little bit from the

1048
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,839
intestinal

1049
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:57,559
tract and the blackberries don't even

1050
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:59,800
have to be wild now all wild berries out

1051
00:44:57,559 --> 00:45:01,920
there like wild

1052
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:05,160
raspberries wild

1053
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:08,319
billberry has a little

1054
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:09,880
bit some capabilities of removing a

1055
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:12,079
little bit of toxic heavy metals out of

1056
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:14,720
the intestinal tract but can't remove

1057
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:16,839
them out of the brain can't remove them

1058
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:19,160
out of the liver can't remove them deep

1059
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:21,680
out of the

1060
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:24,880
organs and that's the difference now if

1061
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:28,520
you don't have access to the wild

1062
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:31,319
blueberry and gusta fium that one if you

1063
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:33,960
don't have access to those wild

1064
00:45:31,319 --> 00:45:36,079
blueberries and you got to use another

1065
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:37,680
blueberry or another different kind of

1066
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:39,040
berry or a wild blueberry or something

1067
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:41,280
like that that because there are wild

1068
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:43,920
blueberries out

1069
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:47,079
there and the wild blue let's go into it

1070
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:50,079
a little bit okay European blueberry is

1071
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:53,079
not this variety of wild blueberry it's

1072
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:55,400
the billberry it's really important to

1073
00:45:53,079 --> 00:45:57,160
know now there are Bill berries in the

1074
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:59,440
US there there's bilberries in Canada

1075
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:03,319
there's bilberries in Maine there's

1076
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:05,200
bilberries out there but and I have

1077
00:46:03,319 --> 00:46:07,079
access to bilberry but I've never put

1078
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,359
bilberry in here so I want people to

1079
00:46:07,079 --> 00:46:10,200
know this this is important because I

1080
00:46:08,359 --> 00:46:12,880
think what happened is over time because

1081
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:14,640
there wasn't access to this variety of

1082
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,400
wild blueberry I think people are just

1083
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:18,079
putting any wild berry they can find in

1084
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,880
there and I got respect for that because

1085
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:23,079
guess what that's good that's good put

1086
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,359
in any wild berry you can get in there I

1087
00:46:23,079 --> 00:46:26,359
like the blackberries and if you can get

1088
00:46:24,359 --> 00:46:28,440
a wild Blackberry then that is the

1089
00:46:26,359 --> 00:46:30,960
ultimate it's not going to do what the

1090
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:33,480
wild blueberry does and gusap fium is

1091
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:36,520
not going to do what that

1092
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:38,079
does but it's important to know because

1093
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:40,800
what happens out there is then people

1094
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:41,839
are just like whoa I'm doing it up like

1095
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:45,240
I'm doing

1096
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:47,040
it exactly the way it should be and what

1097
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:49,079
they don't realize if the billberry is

1098
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:51,839
in here it's not exactly the way it

1099
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:54,119
should be but still sure if that's all

1100
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:56,040
you got then do it but you're really

1101
00:46:54,119 --> 00:46:58,040
running on four ingredients if if you

1102
00:46:56,040 --> 00:47:00,400
don't have the wild

1103
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:03,160
blueberry if you're using a billberry

1104
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:07,960
then your your your heavy metal detox is

1105
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:11,079
only running on four ingredients not

1106
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:13,040
five that's all and I always say three

1107
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:14,240
out of the five get three out of the

1108
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:16,599
five so if you're somebody and you're

1109
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:18,040
doing the heavy metal detox somewhere

1110
00:47:16,599 --> 00:47:20,520
anywhere in the

1111
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:22,040
world and you're putting a raspberry in

1112
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:23,960
there the wild raspberry are you're

1113
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:25,440
putting a wild billberry in there or

1114
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:27,400
you're putting a wild Blackberry in

1115
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:29,760
there

1116
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:31,400
that's that's that's good it's got a lot

1117
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:33,880
of nutrients for other

1118
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:36,040
reasons it's got healing properties for

1119
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:37,920
other things but it doesn't remove the

1120
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:40,079
the the metals deep within the organs

1121
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:43,480
and deep within the brain and deep where

1122
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:45,160
it needs to be so you're running really

1123
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:47,480
four out of

1124
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:50,559
five and if you're somebody that only

1125
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:54,079
has cilantro you call cor coriander you

1126
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:56,400
got cilantro and then you got DOL and

1127
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:59,359
then you got say spirina that's

1128
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:03,240
three it's still going to help but to

1129
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:07,440
get maximum maximum

1130
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:11,559
pull maximum you want the

1131
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:15,480
five the five you need the cilantro you

1132
00:48:11,559 --> 00:48:17,359
need the Inus fium the wild blueberry I

1133
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:19,440
know in Europe they call European

1134
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:23,800
blueberry that's

1135
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:25,920
bberry and I know there are wild

1136
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:27,559
blueberries but there're they're very

1137
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,319
hard to get they're very hard to get in

1138
00:48:27,559 --> 00:48:32,040
Europe you can't get them they're

1139
00:48:29,319 --> 00:48:33,520
they're they're very hard to find and

1140
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:36,440
you can't get them so everybody's

1141
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:38,280
relying on the billberry out there

1142
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:40,480
that's fine you can put billberry in

1143
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:41,880
there you can definitely put bberry you

1144
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:44,200
can put Blackberry in there you can put

1145
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:47,119
a huckleberry in there you can put those

1146
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:49,799
in there but you're not at the maximum

1147
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:52,280
pull to actually get the metals deep out

1148
00:48:49,799 --> 00:48:53,359
of the organs right you're running four

1149
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:56,760
out of

1150
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:58,280
five ingredients and look companies have

1151
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:01,559
also tried to market the billberry so

1152
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:03,040
much so they say that the North American

1153
00:49:01,559 --> 00:49:05,440
you know wild blueberry they say that

1154
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:07,880
the wild blueberry from

1155
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:09,880
Canada is

1156
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:12,400
cultivated there's companies out there

1157
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:14,559
now so hungry and so money hungry to hop

1158
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:17,280
on the heavy metal detox ride that

1159
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:20,079
they'll actually say that the wild

1160
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:22,960
blueberry gusap fium in the United

1161
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:26,240
States or in Canada is actually

1162
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:28,440
cultivated that is not true this is a

1163
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:30,319
wild food and it's not

1164
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:33,440
cultivated that's important thing I want

1165
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:35,799
to clear up so I've seen that out

1166
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:37,599
there and the wild blueberry has more

1167
00:49:35,799 --> 00:49:39,640
antioxidants than the bberry so I want

1168
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:41,240
to cover that for a minute that's really

1169
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:44,119
important here

1170
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:45,559
okay so there are some rumors out there

1171
00:49:44,119 --> 00:49:47,160
being spread because that's how it is

1172
00:49:45,559 --> 00:49:47,920
because people want to sell the crap out

1173
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:50,079
of their

1174
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:52,920
billberry I get it everybody's

1175
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:55,559
everybody's trying to survive out there

1176
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:58,240
I get it but they want to sell the CRA

1177
00:49:55,559 --> 00:50:00,040
crap out of their billberry so much so

1178
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:03,000
that they will say that the billberry is

1179
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:07,720
higher in antioxidants than the wild

1180
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:11,240
blueberry they Gap fum Canada in the US

1181
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:15,040
and they're wrong they're

1182
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:17,720
wrong they are dead

1183
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:21,319
wrong this wild blueberry right here the

1184
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:22,920
gusol has higher antioxidents in any

1185
00:50:21,319 --> 00:50:25,559
billberry

1186
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:27,040
fact but you see they'll spin it every

1187
00:50:25,559 --> 00:50:29,160
body spins whatever they want to do

1188
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:30,559
that's what they do they spin it all oh

1189
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:32,920
our bill berries are higher than the

1190
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:36,240
wild blueberry no it's not it may be

1191
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:39,000
higher than a cultivated blueberry like

1192
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:41,079
a regular cultivated blueberry it may be

1193
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:44,760
higher for than you know than

1194
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:47,280
that they grow a lot of cultivated

1195
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:49,040
blueberries in Poland maybe it's it's

1196
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,760
higher than that one maybe it's higher

1197
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:53,480
than another one that's cultivated but

1198
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:56,359
not the inap fium not

1199
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:58,160
the wild food that's sitting in front of

1200
00:50:56,359 --> 00:51:00,160
me so I want to clear some of these

1201
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:02,559
things

1202
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:04,280
up it's okay if you're running four out

1203
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:06,559
of five it's okay if you're running

1204
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:08,240
three out of five and that's all you got

1205
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:11,040
you only got some barley grass juice

1206
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:12,400
powder or you only got some spirulina

1207
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:14,640
and some

1208
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:17,160
cilantro and maybe some

1209
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:18,559
dolls and that's a three you run because

1210
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:21,400
that's all you got then make that

1211
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:24,240
smoothie or make that smoothie bowl with

1212
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:26,119
those three things okay you guys you can

1213
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:27,119
do that

1214
00:51:26,119 --> 00:51:29,839
but

1215
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:32,040
ideally ideally if it comes your way

1216
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:34,480
someday or you're somewhere and you have

1217
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:37,880
it and you can do all

1218
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:42,200
five that takes it to another level

1219
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:45,000
that's when it's a maximum right there

1220
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:49,079
cilantro spirulina barley grass juice

1221
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:51,079
powder dols wild blueberries like wild

1222
00:51:49,079 --> 00:51:54,599
blueberries not what they call Wild

1223
00:51:51,079 --> 00:51:57,359
blueberry a billberry no not that wild

1224
00:51:54,599 --> 00:51:57,359
blueberries

1225
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:01,599
bilberries grow differently than a wild

1226
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:05,520
blueberry bilberries grow in small

1227
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:07,839
amounts very spread out so I question a

1228
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:10,079
lot of billberry products out there

1229
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:13,880
because you can't Harvest enough of it

1230
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:17,920
to meet a demand which means it's

1231
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:20,920
questionable to what else is in

1232
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:24,160
there anyway okay we covered a little

1233
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:24,160
bit of that let's start doing

1234
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:27,280
this

1235
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:33,720
if you need to make just a smoothie bowl

1236
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:35,520
and you just want a bunch of fruit

1237
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:37,799
chopped up in a bowl make sure if you

1238
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:40,040
wanted the heavy metal detox you put in

1239
00:52:37,799 --> 00:52:42,480
the five

1240
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:45,119
ingredients you put a little bit of

1241
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:45,960
dols you got your wild blueberry you got

1242
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:48,359
your

1243
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:50,480
cilantro right you got your spirulina

1244
00:52:48,359 --> 00:52:52,880
barrass cheese powder and you put it and

1245
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:54,280
you make a smoothie Bowl you know what I

1246
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:57,040
do a lot I'll tell you right now you

1247
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:59,559
guys you know what I do L I cut open a

1248
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:01,520
melon crack the melon open and I put

1249
00:52:59,559 --> 00:53:03,440
spirulina right in the melon I put

1250
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:05,880
barley grass right in the melon I put

1251
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:07,200
some DOL liquid right in the melon right

1252
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:09,720
and I put some wild blueberries right in

1253
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:11,559
the melon and I chop up some cilantro

1254
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:14,680
and I put it right in the melon and I

1255
00:53:11,559 --> 00:53:16,920
have basically a melon smoothie Bowl

1256
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:18,680
basically and that's what I do because

1257
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:21,040
I'm just trying to get the five

1258
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:22,599
ingredients that's the key right that's

1259
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:24,280
the main key I'm just trying to get that

1260
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:26,680
in me all right but we're making the

1261
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:29,000
smoothie

1262
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:29,000
let's

1263
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:33,839
get roughly two cups of the wild

1264
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:36,640
blueberries in here

1265
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:40,280
okay you can find real wild blueberries

1266
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:42,720
in Europe real wild ones but it's not

1267
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:45,000
billberry they're just calling billberry

1268
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:48,359
the wild blueberry that's what they're

1269
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:50,160
doing they're calling the the billberry

1270
00:53:48,359 --> 00:53:52,440
the wild blueberry it's not the wild

1271
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:54,160
blueberry you see how it works I just

1272
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:56,480
want to make sure that that's all clear

1273
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:58,240
information

1274
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,920
and then the sellers are doing that and

1275
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:01,960
pushing that to make money right the

1276
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:03,880
sellers of billberry products are

1277
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:05,119
pushing it as the wild blueberry they're

1278
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:06,640
actually saying it's a wild blueberry

1279
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:08,359
and then you see the little you see the

1280
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:11,280
little fine print

1281
00:54:08,359 --> 00:54:14,160
bberry our wild blueberries are so good

1282
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:15,839
out here they're so great you should see

1283
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:18,119
them they're actually handpicked by

1284
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:19,319
people foraging in the woods and then

1285
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:20,440
right there you'll see a little bit

1286
00:54:19,319 --> 00:54:21,680
they're calling it wild blueberry and

1287
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:23,680
then you'll see a little bit in the

1288
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:25,720
little spot there billberry like yeah

1289
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:28,680
because you're picking bilberries

1290
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:29,960
but you know because so much so many

1291
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:31,720

people out I'm just saying it like it is

1296
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:42,400
of what's Happening here's cilantro

1297
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:46,040
right

1298
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:49,000
here I like cilantro by itself I like it

1299
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:51,920
on everything and anything I use it as a

1300
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:53,440
leafy green that's how I love cilantro

1301
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:55,680
as a leafy

1302
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:57,799
green but it's great have it here's

1303
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:59,799
another thing to run by you really quick

1304
00:54:57,799 --> 00:55:01,880
okay if you get the five ingredients

1305
00:54:59,799 --> 00:55:03,920
during the course of the same day the

1306
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:08,040
medical medium heavy metal

1307
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:10,680
detox means you try to get the five

1308
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:14,520
ingredients on the same

1309
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:17,359
day same day that's what you

1310
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:18,599
do you get the cilantro in your salad

1311
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:21,680
you get the wild blueberry in your

1312
00:55:18,599 --> 00:55:24,400
breakfast you get the your spirulina in

1313
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:26,280
a papaya put sprinkle it on a papaya

1314
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:28,280
whatever it is you get the five on the

1315
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:30,640
same day doesn't have to be at the same

1316
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:31,760
time keep that in mind and you get the

1317
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:34,640
medals

1318
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:35,640
out you just have to get them in on the

1319
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:38,079
same

1320
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:40,160
day see how it goes I've always said

1321
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:42,559
that all the way since the beginning

1322
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:46,400
billberry is still good for you and you

1323
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:48,559
can still use them to get some small

1324
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:50,200
amount of metal out of your intestinal

1325
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:51,400
tract it won't get it out of the brain

1326
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:53,280
it won't get out of the organs but the

1327
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:55,079
billberry will get a small amount out of

1328
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:58,319
the intestinal tract and so will Wild

1329
00:55:55,079 --> 00:56:01,839
raspberry and so will a wild

1330
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:03,920
blackberry and so will some Huckleberry

1331
00:56:01,839 --> 00:56:07,000
whatever it is that you got right it

1332
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:09,119
will take a little bit out of the

1333
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,720
intestinal tract but it can't go further

1334
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:13,319
than that and it doesn't take a lot out

1335
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:16,359
of the intestinal tract and the binder

1336
00:56:13,319 --> 00:56:17,720
the heavy binder quality is not there so

1337
00:56:16,359 --> 00:56:20,640
you can you know that's not happening

1338
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:23,920
too so the wild blueberry right the

1339
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:25,960
angustifolium is the like heavy

1340
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:28,480
binder

1341
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:30,520
all right so I got cilantro in there I

1342
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:33,119
got the wild blueberry in there let's

1343
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:34,240
pop in a couple bananas in there too

1344
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:38,079
hello

1345
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:41,520
bananas I'm very happy to see

1346
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:44,160
you pop a couple of bananas in

1347
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:47,720
there

1348
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:50,039
nice nice you guys it's great to be here

1349
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:52,760
I wanted to run this by people I want

1350
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:54,880
them to be inspired to get Metals out of

1351
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:56,440
their body because it is important

1352
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:59,119
important to do

1353
00:56:56,440 --> 00:57:02,240
so all right let's get some spirulina in

1354
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:05,960
here a little

1355
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:09,960
bit okay I'll try not to make a

1356
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:12,400
mess but I do make a mess all the time

1357
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:14,039
in the kitchen got some barley grass

1358
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:16,880
cheese powder let's go into that

1359
00:57:14,039 --> 00:57:19,160
next barley grass is not barley grass

1360
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:23,000
cheese

1361
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:26,240
powder Corella is not

1362
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:30,240
spirulina it's not two different things

1363
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:30,240
two different things

1364
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,680
okay a lot of people will use they'll

1365
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:38,520
see barley grass cheese powder but they

1366
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:41,559
miss the juice the juice so they do

1367
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:44,000
barley grass powder scratchy it doesn't

1368
00:57:41,559 --> 00:57:46,079
work it doesn't have that play it

1369
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,680
doesn't bind on to the others it doesn't

1370
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:50,799
act as a binder it doesn't remove

1371
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:52,280
anything it can't be barley grass it has

1372
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:53,559
to be barley grass cheese powder so we

1373
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:55,760
threw that in

1374
00:57:53,559 --> 00:57:58,160

make sure it's on the same day that bit

1438
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:07,160
of information is

1439
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:09,839
powerful powerful it's

1440
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:13,039
empowering

1441
01:01:09,839 --> 01:01:16,400
um I'm excited about this because I am

1442
01:01:13,039 --> 01:01:17,760
hungry now there's this congealing thing

1443
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,920
that happens and I talked about this the

1444
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:23,599
other

1445
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:25,559
day the the inusa fium that wild

1446
01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:29,319
blueberry

1447
01:01:25,559 --> 01:01:31,599
congeals the most has the highest

1448
01:01:29,319 --> 01:01:32,920
congealing factor that I've been able to

1449
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:36,079
find out

1450
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:40,079
there and that's part of the whole

1451
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:43,440
binding part so with the wild blueberry

1452
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:46,720
does it helps to get the metals out of

1453
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:50,079
organs but it also has an intense

1454
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:52,319
binding quality for the intestinal tract

1455
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:54,440
something sodium bicarbonate cannot do

1456
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:56,559
something corilla cannot do something

1457
01:01:54,440 --> 01:02:00,119
zeolite cannot do something bentonite

1458
01:01:56,559 --> 01:02:04,880
clay canot do something charcoal cannot

1459
01:02:00,119 --> 01:02:06,960
do it can't do no can do no can do but

1460
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:09,640
this is that incredible and that

1461
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:12,760
powerful

1462
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:16,279

01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:18,240
good hands down

1464
01:02:16,279 --> 01:02:22,000
delicious and what I like to do is when

1465
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:24,839
I'm when I'm consuming the heavy metal

1466
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:26,359
detox I'm not consuming any heavy metal

1467
01:02:24,839 --> 01:02:28,599
meaning I'm not out there purposely

1468
01:02:26,359 --> 01:02:31,839
consuming heavy metals but when I

1469
01:02:28,599 --> 01:02:34,599
consume the heavy metal

1470
01:02:31,839 --> 01:02:37,760

1471
01:02:34,599 --> 01:02:40,799
