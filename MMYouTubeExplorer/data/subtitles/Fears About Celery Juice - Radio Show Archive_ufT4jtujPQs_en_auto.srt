that's what you want to do but there's

29
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,439
there's the radio shows they can't touch

30
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,360
what's in the book tremendous amounts of

31
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:21,159
information Way Beyond what I can do

32
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:24,439
here on the radio shows and um but we're

33
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:26,280
talking about the fears that are created

34
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:28,159
and what that is like what does that

35
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,600
mean you'll just hear them over and over

36
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,560
again all different kinds out there

37
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:36,159
and I'm just going to cover some because

38
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,880
the book has so many of them in there of

39
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,799
what you got to look out for what you're

40
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,640
hearing out there and all that there's

41
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:42,960
so much of that but I could only cover

42
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,600
some and I'm going to cover them right

43
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,600
now let's do it let's go straight into

44
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,000
it

45
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:51,040
oxalates so what you might see on social

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,280
media or other places is like acceler

47
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,560
juices has oxalates oxalates worry about

48
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,479
the oxalate thing oh wo there's so many

49
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,680
problems with that one all on its own

50
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:03,479
there is so many issues with that all on

51
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:07,320
its own do not be concerned about

52
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:10,360
oxalate oxyc acid in celery juice the

53
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,480
myth that certain leafy green vegetables

54
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,480
and herbs such as celery are high in

55
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,000
oxalates and therefore harmful is

56
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,599
completely misguided when I mean

57
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,000
completely misguided oxalates not even

58
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:27,239
barely exist in celery juice this is so

59
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
important this myth prevents so many

60
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:32,239
people from getting the powerful healing

61
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,800
they need it the nutrients the healing

62
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,920
properties that foods have and it you

63
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,879
know it could provide them with so many

64
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:44,640
nutrients and hearing a myth or a rumor

65
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:46,640
or a fear that really doesn't exist is

66
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,480
unbelievable might be well hey wait a

67
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,959
minute I'm sensitive to oxalates is it

68
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,959
are you you sure you sure that's what

69
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,400
you're sensitive when you eat something

70
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,560
because it's incredible what happens

71
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,760
I've had people tell me that and then

72
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,720
they eat something that doesn't have

73
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,560
oxalates in it or so-called doesn't have

74
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,760
oxalates in it and they're reacting on

75
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,000
those but they're not blaming oxalates

76
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,560
they're just they're not even blaming

77
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,920
the food but they're having bad

78
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:13,040
reactions a bad day a bad day with their

79
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:15,159
Foods a bad problem and this is just a

80
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,920
prime example right here oxalates are

81
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:20,640
not the concerned they are even believed

82
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,720
to be and that's a whole another issue

83
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,239
all and its own now I respect if you're

84
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,680
scared about oxalates or you believe

85
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,319
because you were told that that's

86
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,720
probably why you're having an issue I

87
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:33,360
respect that I totally do and look I'll

88
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,439
Stand By Your Side if you need me to do

89
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,159

don't worry about it in celery juice

93
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,040
whatever you do that's one place you

94
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,159
should not you you should not worry

about it do oxalates exist yeah they

96
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,799
exist but they're not what they're made

97
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:58,159
out to be or believe to be you got to

98
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:00,200
remember you guys that chronic illness

99
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:03,000
had this whole succession of De decades

100
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,879
before now okay and the Decades of

101
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,360
succession were people not knowing what

102
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,840
causes disease illness chronic symptoms

103
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,599
all the different mystery chronic

00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:14,159
everything else you you name it they

106
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,640
still don't even know outside of the

107
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,400
medical medium books that puts the

108
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:20,239
information out there so you can learn

109
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:22,600
about that but because nobody knew why

110
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:25,320
everybody was sick all these theories

111
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:28,000
popped up over the decades candida

112
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:30,680
candida it's candida meanwhile candida

113
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,759
these people are viral and viral sick

114

and I talk about all that and this what

122
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:55,199
I mean this is an example oxalates

123
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,919
oxalates you pull that out of a hat that

124
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,360
rabbit out of your hat because you you

125
00:04:56,919 --> 00:05:01,800
know I was going to say rabbit out of

126
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:03,400
something else because you pull that out

127
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,360
because you don't know what's caus the

128
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:08,840
Epstein bar that's wreaking havoc giving

129
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,800
everybody fatigue and giving everybody

130
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,400
neurological problems and and and

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,320
depression and anxiety and everything

132
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,400
else these are the things these are the

133
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,759
fears that have cropped up over the

134
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,520
years lectin isn't lectin is another one

135
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,880
another one that's cropped up that

136
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,319
cropped up because still no one knows

137
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,440
what's wrong what creates hashimotos

138
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:28,840
thyroiditis and all these other

139
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,400
illnesses and everything like this you

140
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,240
see what I'm saying

141
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,080
this is serious stuff so oxalates is

142
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,080
another one just thrown in there okay

143
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,680
let's fear oxalates now oh and let's be

144
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,400
somebody on social media and say oh

145
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,280
oxalates and celerate Juice don't drink

146
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,919
it you just basically could have ruined

147
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:47,639
somebody life somebody's life by doing

148
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:49,560
that because what if that person avoids

149
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:52,000
celery juice when it's the one thing

150
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:54,479
that could literally take them out of

151
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,039
hell and bring them to Heaven what about

152
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,400
that okay take them out of hell and

153
00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:00,039
bring them to Paradise how about that

154
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,360
bring them to a place where wo you mean

155
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:02,880
I'm actually getting better for the

156
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,880
first time in 5 years and I could have

157
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,840
listened to that jerk that said there's

158
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:10,400
oxalates in there think about that it

159
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,599
it's incredible how it works there are

160
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,599
oxalates in every single fruit vegetable

161
00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:17,280
on the planet did you know that there's

162
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:20,440
more oxalates in more in every single

163
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,960
fruit and vegetable than celery

164
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:25,400
juice but also on the planet there's

165
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:28,120
oxalates on in everything there's

166
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,919
oxalates in animal proteins because the

167
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,440
animals are eating

168
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,919
they're eating plant

169
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:37,720
food so there's oxalates in all the

170
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:39,960
chicken there's o oxalates in all the

171
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:44,039
the the meat there's oxalates in Lamb

172
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:45,960
there's oxalates in all of it because

173
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:47,560
because the oxalates that's in the grass

174
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,520
if it's grass-fed the oxalates that are

175
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,680
in

176
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:54,360
everything there's oxalates filled in

177
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,280
Meats there's oxalates

178
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,000
everywhere but of course a piece of

179
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:00,800
fruit's going to be blamed for something

180
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,400
of course missing information fruit fear

181
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,680
stopping people from living longer

182
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,400
that's real great and let's just throw

183
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,520
celery in the mix celery juice Now

184
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,479
Incredible incred I can't say enough

185
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,520
about this one oxalates in a plum for

186
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:15,160
example are much different from those in

187
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:21,280
a piece of

188
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:24,520
cheese okay but there's oxalates in them

189
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,919
all this is an underfunded area to begin

190
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,280
with the medical research and science

191
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,680
cuz guess what there really isn't any

192
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,080
medical research and science on the

193
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,560
oxalate the

194
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,960
that's the whole point you guys that's

195
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:38,440
the whole point and research and science

196
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:42,000
is a theory that can only be funded for

197
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:44,960
a possible outcome always manipulated so

198
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,120
the investors of the theory are

199
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:50,280
happy over and over do I have to say

200
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,039
this and teach people it's incredible

201
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:55,159
how it works and you're not going to

202
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:57,840
hear this from anybody not one single

203
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:59,319
podcast out there not one single podcast

204
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,039
in health is going to say all the things

205
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:03,720
things that I say or different things

206
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:06,280
that I say none of them this is an under

207
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:10,000
underfunded area of medical research and

208
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:12,000
science no so medical communities don't

209
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,199
truly know how different forms of

210
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,479
oxalates even react react in the body or

211
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:18,440
accum accumulate in the body because

212
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:21,560
there's no way to ever know there's no

213
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:25,039
science in research claims that oxalates

214
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:28,639
should you know create be a problem in

215
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:30,520
celery juice or unproven and OB unstand

216
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,399
un

217
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:35,000
unsubstantiated they're

218
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:42,479
unproven and unsubstantiated that's the

219
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:46,200
whole point in reality these Foods Do no

220
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:48,040
harm it's incredible how it works you

221
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,160
know rather they provide us with

222
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:54,040
critical healing phytochemicals minerals

223
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:56,600
vitamins and more the vast array of

224
00:08:54,040 --> 00:09:00,760
nutrients in

225
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:03,839
socalled spinach meaning High oxalate

226
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:05,839
leafy greens such as spinach are

227
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:10,120
incredible for

228
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:12,320
you Cel are some of the most beneficial

229
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:14,839
to us now if someone says wait a minute

230
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,680
Anthony you're wrong because I react

231
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:18,600
when I have spinach or I react when I

232
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,120
have something I react in my mouth I

233
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,839
feel the oxyc acid causing a problem

234
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,399
that's not the oxyc acid you're feeling

235
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:27,880
causing the problem that's an

236
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:31,000
alkaloid that's an

237
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:35,600
alkaloid okay that's what that is not

238
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:38,040
oxyc acid oxyc acid that's false okay

239
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,600
true is it's an

240
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,200
alkaloid a lot of leafy greens certain

241
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,680
types of spinach not all types of

242
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:47,120
spinach will have a higher level of

243
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:49,839
alkaloids something that's not studied

244
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:54,800
something that's completely nobody even

245
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:57,760
knows about really and alkaloids are so

246
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:01,079
detoxifying I mean literally

247
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:03,760
detoxifying and and and and could

248
00:10:01,079 --> 00:10:06,760
stimulate the salivary glands all of

249
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:10,360
that and cause a little bit of a stir

250
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:12,240
and people can react a little bit but

251
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,200
don't do the spinach then that's okay if

252
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,519
you're actually feeling that but if

253
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,519
you're not feeling that with things then

254
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,440
you should have it regardless oxalates

255
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:23,600
or not whatever it is that's how it

256
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:26,560
works I I know a lot of people lambs

257
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:29,680
quarters I I remember I remember

258
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,519
foraging for wild lambs quarters okay

259
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,120
and I'm out there I'm looking for wild

260
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:36,480
Lamb's quarters I'm eating them I always

261
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:39,240
did good with Wild Lamb's quarters

262
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:43,639
always did good the alkaloid is really

263
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:46,079
potent but it never bothered me because

264
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:49,480
it's a wild green a lot of

265
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:53,120
spinaches are almost on the Wild Side

266
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:54,680
yes are on the Wild Side practically

267
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,560
they are there's a lot of varieties

268
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,320
right on the edge of The Wildside

269
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,920
they'll have a little higher alkaloid

270
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,519
content

271
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:05,120
and I'd be foraging for Lamb's quarters

272
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:07,440
and sea plantain sea plantain is

273
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,920
something grows on the shore North

274
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:13,920
America okay and it's kind of like it's

275
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:16,360
kind of like it's uh lot of M

276
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:19,040
muc in it you know I can't say the word

277
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:21,360
right now for some reason but it's it's

278
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,959
very like milky when you pluck it at the

279
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:27,600
bottom like milkweed all right and I

280
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:29,800
could eat I could eat the sea plantain

281
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,680
that alkaloids off the

282
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:35,800
chart then I went to my friend's Garden

283
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:38,040
who grew lamb quarters grew lamb

284
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:41,320
quarters they weren't wild but it was a

285
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:44,160
different species and basically wild

286
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:47,000
because they were a cultivated lamb

287
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:49,079
quarters but you can't really they were

288
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,800
too close to the wild but it eat but it

289
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:53,399
had a stronger alkaloid for some reason

290
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,839
it's just the way it works could have

291
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:57,079
been the soil could have been everything

292
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:00,680
in his garden you name it had a stronger

293
00:11:57,079 --> 00:12:04,720
alkaloid that thing bit me that thing

294
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:07,600
bit my butt when I ate it I felt it in

295
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,120
the mouth and in the throat I was like

296
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:13,399
oh my God I'm having some kind of

297
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:15,880
reaction to this to this lamb quarters

298
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:18,440
when I could eat all the lamb quarters I

299
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:20,000
want you know and the reason what it

300
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:24,199
what it was was the alkaloids were off

301
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,760
the chart on that baby not oxyc acid not

302
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:28,560
oxalate but see nobody knows any of this

303
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,279
information but that's the whole point

304
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,680
nobody knows anything in the alternative

305
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:36,360
movement practically it's all hit Miss

306
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,519
guess folklore crap this fake science

307
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:41,639
pseudo science you name it is what it

308
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:44,600
all is you got to remember that most of

309
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:46,120
it so it It's Tricky the whole thing's

310
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,000
tricky so you got to be careful what you

311
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,279
get sucked into you can get sucked down

312
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,800
the road remember I don't work for

313
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:54,760
anybody you always have to remember that

314
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,839
I don't work for anybody except for

315
00:12:54,760 --> 00:13:01,079
guess what guess who guess who not

316
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:03,240
myself all right yeah I try to survive

317
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:06,440
so I can give you guys as much as I

318
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:09,639
can but I work for you

319
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:12,480
guys it's a difference between working

320
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:14,959
for yourself and everything's about

321
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,720
yourself yourself yourself yourself

322
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:19,519
yourself and you just glean up grab onto

323
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,120
any information that you can make money

324
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,800
off of make money off of make money

325
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,800
whatever it is or you work for the

326
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,920
people and so you deliver them

327
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:31,040
information that's real for the first

328
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:34,519
time and that's what I do all the time

329
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:37,440
that's how it works so the vast array of

330
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:38,920
of nutrients in so-called High oxalate

331
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,680
leafy

332
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:44,760
greens and celery which isn't a high and

333
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:47,519
celery is not a high oxalate anything

334
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:49,519
it's not on a high oxalate of anything

335
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:53,040
they're some of the most beneficial

336
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:54,920
available to us barely there's barely

337
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,440
oxalates in so but there's oxalates in

338
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:59,240
everything remember that but barely

339
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,000
medical research and science have not

340
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,880
yet discovered that fruits and

341
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,279
vegetables and leafy greens and herbs

342
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:08,759
contain anti oxalates get this anti

343
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:10,920
oxalates that prevent oxalates from even

344
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:13,199
ever causing an issue

345
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:15,399
whatsoever like the current Trend says

346
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:17,560
that oxalates cause problems because

347
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:21,560
it's never oxalates that are causing the

348
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:22,560
problem it's an alkaloid that's causing

349
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,480
the

350
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:29,839
problem it's an

351
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:32,519
alkaloid tobacco is so high in Al alids

352
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:36,000
those tobacco leaves so high in

353
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:39,040
alkaloids really is you got smoke it

354
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,680
smoke it smoke it smoke it but you eat

355
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:44,360
that tobacco leaf that alkaloid is going

356
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,600
to bite you like NE like no other and

357
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,959
it's not going to be

358
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,759
oxalates so if you go you go to a place

359
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:52,279
where they grow that they grow that

360
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:53,880
poison where they grow that tobacco leaf

361
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:55,839
and you go there and you pluck a piece

362
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,839
and you put that in your mouth you're

363
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,480
going to be

364
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:00,959
like what is this reaction I'm having I

365
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,240
could smoke the stuff I could smoke

366
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:05,399
three packs of cigarettes a day but I

367
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:07,519
can't this stuff is hard in my mou

368
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:09,040
what's in this my throat it's an

369
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,360
alkaloid

370
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,279
attack that's what's happening little

371
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,959
bit of an alkaloid

372
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:19,480
reaction so yeah I mean Isn't it nice to

373
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:23,240
have some clear information for

374
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:24,519
once oxalates are wides spread whether

375
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:27,600
we like it or

376
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:29,480
not you know so understand that but so

377
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,800
are antidotes to oxalates they're

378
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,440
naturally in the the fruits and

379
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,519
vegetables what they're not naturally in

380
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:37,600
there's no antidotes in meat chicken

381
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,839
animal products and people still aren't

382
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,639
reacting to those oxalates and there's

383
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:45,639
not even anti oxalates in

384
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:49,279
there that's how harmless oxalates are

385
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:52,680
there's not even antioxidantes built

386
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:55,600
into a piece of meat into an animal's

387
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:58,639
body like there is in all the fruits and

388
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,800
vegetables that the animals are eating

389
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,720
there's no antioxidants they don't

390
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,720
they're not in oxalates in an animal's

391
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,519
body meat when you when you're cooking

392
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,399
that meat and all that there's no you

393
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,240
see but yet those oxalates still aren't

394
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:12,360
bothering anybody when they're eating it

395
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:16,120
they're like okay this CH piece

396
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:18,399
chicken's fine and whatever you see the

397
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:20,880
common belief is that foods high in

398
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:24,160
oxalates produce kidney stones and golf

399
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:27,000
Stones unbelievable protein causes

400
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:30,519
kidney stones and call

401
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:34,079
Stones protein causes kidney stones and

402
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:37,639
gall stones I I could say it again but I

403
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:41,000
think you got it not an oxalate in

404
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:43,279
fruits and vegetables so oxalates in

405
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,759
fruits and vegetables will give you a

406
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:48,759
kidney stone celery juice dissolves

407
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:51,759
kidney stones lemon water dissolves

408
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:54,440
kidney kidney stones um I can go on and

409
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:57,199
on and on leafy greens stop the

410
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:59,639
production of kidney stones I could go

411
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:02,040
on and on and and

412
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:05,959
on this is

413
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:08,559
unbelievable don't toss out valuable

414
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:10,799
healing tools like spinach and celery

415
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:13,839
and things like that and celery juice

416
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:17,720
for mistaken

417
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:19,760
theories for mistaken theories it's so

418
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:22,919
important everything I'm talking about

419
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:25,559
celan let's go into celan look you might

420
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:27,400
you might pronounce celan differently p

421
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:32,160
s o r a l

422
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:34,640
NS I call them selian sorians you know

423
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,160
you can call them different things um

424
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:40,640
sorians with an S and not even pronounce

425
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:43,320
the P or however you want to do borans

426
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,200
but the bottom line is these right here

427
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:47,799
this is going to be this is a constitute

428
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,919
fear but this is a fear

429
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:52,600
Creator that's what this one is so let's

430
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,880
go into that a little bit it it's an

431
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:56,679
ultimate fear tactic that might come out

432
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,799
that probably already is it's used to

433
00:17:56,679 --> 00:17:59,840
it's used to deter people from consuming

434
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,360
celery

435
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,880
juice sorians are phytochemical

436
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:07,240
compounds which reside in almost every

437
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:10,280
single fruit and vegetable and Herb how

438
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:13,960
do you like that sorians are helpful for

439
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:17,080
the immune system and for healing our

440
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:20,720
bodies we need that chemical compound

441
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:26,120
it's actually critical for us to heal

442
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:29,600
yeah any sorians present in celery is

443
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:31,559
harmless it's in fact great critical

444
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,159
that it's even in

445
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:37,240
there they do not create Sun

446
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:38,320
sensitivities or dermatitis celery juice

447
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,080
rids

448
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:45,480
dermatitis so this fear this fear tactic

449
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:48,720
is just amazing to me absolutely amazing

450
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:50,440
instead sorians help and rid people of

451
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,880
these skin

452
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:54,720
conditions you got to think about that

453
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,120
right there how can some of the worst

454
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,159
cases of eximus psoriasis and it's not

455
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,840
just recently I I've been doing this for

456
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:03,000
decades promoting that celery juice

457
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,520
since I was a kid 1975 since I was a

458
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,039
little kid in

459
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:08,840
1975 Spirit gave me that

460
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,640
information I've watched people get

461
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,799
their lives turned around because of it

462
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,480
my whole life when I was a stock boy in

463
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:19,520
the grocery store 13 years old 14 years

464
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:22,640
old 12 13 14 years old I was actually

465
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:26,240
juicing I talk about in the book juicing

466
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:29,080
celery there at the store bringing it

467
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,679
out to people walking around out there

468
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,640
bringing you know pushing their

469
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:34,320
carriages and stuff bringing it out when

470
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,240
I knew there was a condition and problem

471
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:39,000
and everything like that I've seen skin

472
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:42,159
conditions better and get better and

473
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,799
better I've seen that it's it's not it's

474
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:46,840
it's it's not something you can't get a

475
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:49,960
in Sun sensitivity that's ridiculous

476
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:52,320
from from celery juice okay sure you're

477
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:54,159
not going to get it from celery juice so

478
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,720
these are some of the fear tactics that

479
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:57,679
you'll see out there if I don't prepare

480
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,159
you you can't then spread the word

481
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,600
either

482
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:04,320
because I'm only one little guy that's

483
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:07,320
it I mean your voice is is what

484
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:10,080
matters that's what matters just knowing

485
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:12,760
the truth and I know so many people with

486
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:15,799
chronic illness they're quiet they're

487
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:18,159
quiet they're reserved they're laidback

488
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:20,159
and then you got the naysayers out there

489
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:22,559
that are just instigating purposely

490
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:25,640
they're loud they're squeaky they're

491
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:28,520
scratchy they're abrasive they're

492
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:29,960
abusive is what they are and you got

493
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,880
people who are literally trying to live

494
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:34,240
their lives they're trying to work dayto

495
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:36,880
day or not work work on their health to

496
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,039
try to get to work someday and they're

497
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,080
they're you know taking care of

498
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:40,240
themselves they're killing themselves to

499
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:42,600
take care of themselves of course

500
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,520
they're working hard at it and they

501
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,039
don't have time to be squeaky wheels on

502
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:48,679
social media and stuff and spread the

503
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:50,280
good word and all this kind of thing

504
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:54,080
they don't and they stay kind of

505
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:55,880
reserved and stay kind ofly back and

506
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,320
then you there are some people that

507
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,640
battling chronic illness that are

508
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:01,440
Fighters for out there spreading the

509
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,080
word and if you guys are one of them you

510
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,240
know spread the word about these very

511
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:07,559
things get the book and and read and

512
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:10,320
just become an expert get the soues book

513
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:11,919
become an expert is really important

514
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,520
because you'll save lives you don't

515
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:16,559
think you'll save lives you'll save

516
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:18,320
lives you don't think that matters you

517
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:21,960
know saving lives you don't think it

518
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:24,240
matters it does it does it matters it

519
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:27,159
matters when we're here the good works

520
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:29,039
we do matter when we're here we're only

521
00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:32,440
here for so long

522
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:35,120
it matters when we're here it truly does

523
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,799
every little bit counts let's go to the

524
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:40,480
next one so that's

525
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:42,039
suran um hey look and prove me wrong

526
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,559
pronounce it differently and just say

527
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:44,960
you could laugh at me I could be totally

528
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:46,520
pronouncing it wrong and it's kind of

529
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,720
funny it's actually really funny you

530
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:51,039
know I mean I I'm not an English major

531
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,640
and I'm certainly not the smartest guy

532
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:55,880
in the world my information is smart

533
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,640
because it comes from Spirit you know I

534
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,760
don't have any training you guys know

535
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,200
that

536
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,720
it comes from Spirits and was a little

537
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:04,000
kid it's Advanced Medical information

538
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:06,679
filled in these books and it's original

539
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,559
information because it's no one else's

540
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:11,559
there's no citations in the books for a

541
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:14,320
reason it's all from Spirit so for a guy

542
00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:16,960
that's not too smart and writing all

543
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:19,799
that down right from just sitting at the

544
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:22,159
desk why Spirit talks to me you know

545
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:24,760
it's pretty interesting don't you think

546
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:26,080
so sorens so that's another way you can

547
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:28,720
say it is

548
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:32,039
sorens so that's a whole another way

549
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:36,360
way and so hey look there you go let's

550
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:40,000
go into salici acid

551
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:43,279
Sol you know that's a good one okay all

552
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,600
right that's a good one salicylic acid

553
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:46,240
you know everybody's got a different way

554
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,360
of saying it I think that's the way to

555
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,600
say that one there tricky words some of

556
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:54,039
them you know it doesn't mean hey it it

557
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,320
doesn't mean if you can't say the word

558
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:57,400
right does it mean you don't know what

559
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,880
you're talking about so always know that

560
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:02,360
when you're saying the word somewhere

561
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:04,600
it's okay but you know salicylic acid is

562
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:08,640
is something that is always been a

563
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:10,720
tongue twister and you know basically

564
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:14,520
it's got other it's also known as other

565
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:17,520
things you know salicylate acid is

566
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:20,200
another myth and fear tactic that deters

567
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,440
people from experiencing the healing

568
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:25,279
benefits of celery

569
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:27,400
juice so this is another one the theory

570
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:30,200
that individuals are sensitive to this

571
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:32,240
acid from fruits and vegetables has not

572
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,559
even been proven by medical research and

573
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:38,120
science here's another one here's

574
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:40,960
another oxyc acid thing this is another

575
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:42,840
mess up in the system how would you even

576
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:46,640
know that's what makes you sensitive how

577
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:49,840
would you even know in in God's name how

578
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:54,200
would you even it would it even be

579
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:56,960
possible or in the higher power or in

580
00:23:54,200 --> 00:24:00,520
the heavens or in the light how would

581
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:02,039
you even know no if it was even possible

582
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,440
that that's what you're reacting to that

583
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:04,960
chemical compound in a fruit or

584
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,679
vegetable is what you're even reacting

585
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,320
to it's incredible and so they'll throw

586
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,760
that one at you with the celery juice

587
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:13,480
too why not try to stop you from

588
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:15,440
drinking celery juice with that one you

589
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:18,880
know that's it that's a whole another

590
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:21,600
one and so you got to be careful since

591
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:24,880
celery is not a vegetable it shouldn't

592
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:28,840
even be grouped in this Theory anyway

593
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:33,720
this is a vegetable Theory you guys

594
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:37,360
salic cylic acid is a vegetable Theory

595
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:40,200
it's an actual vegetable Theory it's not

596
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:43,279
a herb Theory it's not even an herb

597
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:47,880
Theory celery is an

598
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:50,840
herb I mean the amount of bull bleep

599
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:53,760
that we got to sift through here it's

600
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:55,919
daunting and it shows you how even the

601
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,919
top so-called experts out there know

602
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:01,679
nothing about celery juice nor People's

603
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:04,320
Health in general it's actually kind of

604
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,840
like sad and scary at the same time when

605
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,960
you really think about

606
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:10,399
it it's

607
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:11,840
incredible so since celery isn't even a

608
00:25:10,399 --> 00:25:14,039
vegetable it's not even it shouldn't

609
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,399
even be grouped in this Theory anyway

610
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:20,399
celery juice is in herbal medicine that

611
00:25:16,399 --> 00:25:23,120
helps reverse chemical food

612
00:25:20,399 --> 00:25:28,200
sensitivities that many people develop

613
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:31,360
from gluten dairy corn eggs and soy

614
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:32,760
celery juice is an herbal medicine that

615
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:37,039
helps

616
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:38,720
reverse ready chemical food

617
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:41,039
sensitivities chemical food

618
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,960
sensitivities that many people develop

619
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:45,559
because of eating all this gluten all

620
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,640
this Dairy all this corn all this eggs

621
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:49,240
and all these soy and all the soy that

622
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,960
feeds

623
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:55,399
pathogens that feed Epstein bar virus

624
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:56,960
seg virus hhv6 virus simplex one virus

625
00:25:55,399 --> 00:26:00,440
Simplex 2 virus all the different

626
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:04,440
mutations of all these viruses hhv7 many

627
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:07,039
other ones strep staff ciff MCA boom

628
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:09,200
whatever all these things and then some

629
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:12,960
just more bacteria than that just tons

630
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:16,000
of bacteria all of this

631
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:18,399
well eggs feed that they feed all those

632
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,520
little bugs eat your eggs eat your eggs

633
00:26:18,399 --> 00:26:23,080
happy happy feed the bugs eat you know

634
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:25,240
and that's what it is well celery juice

635
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:27,000
helps combat not only the pathogens that

636
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,640
cause food sensitivities and all these

637
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,440
other issues in everything

638
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,399
else

639
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:36,120
but it's it's it's anti all this it's

640
00:26:33,399 --> 00:26:37,760
it's incredible okay let's go

641
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:40,520
into

642
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:43,440
sodium let's hit sodium this is a fun

643
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:44,679
one this one is is my favorite is

644
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:48,159
actually my

645
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:49,440
favorite the same okay you got to get

646
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,240
ready for

647
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,840
this the same dietitians nutritionist

648
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,080
so-called experts blah blah blah

649
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,799
everybody else the same ones will

650
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,720
literally tell you there's too much salt

651
00:26:57,799 --> 00:27:04,679
and celery juice but they'll advise all

652
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:06,360
their patients clients all their people

653
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:08,440
all their whatever it is they're writing

654
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:12,440
or doing they'll advise them to stick

655
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:13,240
salt in water and drink it that's what

656
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:17,279
they'll

657
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:19,080
do irony I irony is not even a word I

658
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:21,880
could use for this because you have to

659
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:23,799
attach irony with stupidity with with

660
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:25,200
just plain old something with plain old

661
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:26,919
ignorance with something else with

662
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,200
something else with something else and

663
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:31,919
you have to lump them all together so

664
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:36,159
irony can't work I can't use irony for

665
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:39,600
this one because I know for a

666
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:42,360
fact that virtually probably almost

667
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:47,080
every single naysayer against the sodium

668
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:49,200
and celery juice almost every single

669
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:51,760
naysayer

670
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:54,679
allows a little pinch of sea salt in

671
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:56,840
your water because it's another once

672
00:27:54,679 --> 00:27:58,760
again no science behind it no anything

673
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:00,760
behind it no nothing behind it once

674
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:05,120
again it became law and where did it

675
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:11,440
come from who the hell knows and it's

676
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:14,120
junk what it does is the salt in celery

677
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:17,840
juice hydrates

678
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:19,519
you the salt thrown in a glass of water

679
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:22,320
dehydrates

680
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:24,559
you dehydrates

681
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:28,799
you so that's the

682
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:32,000
difference the salt in celery

683
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:35,000
are are subgroups of

684
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,279
sodium ones that go to the

685
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,960
brain to restore damaged

686
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:41,480
neurotransmitter chemicals to fire up

687
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:44,279
electrical

688
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:45,279
impulses to help you heal on almost

689
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:48,799
every

690
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:51,880
level those are the salts that your body

691
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:54,440
craves the mineral salts that your body

692
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:56,399
craves that's your bloodstream craves

693
00:28:54,440 --> 00:29:00,640
it's your organs

694
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:03,120
crave sea salt can dehydrate you you

695
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:05,320
have to be careful it's not the same

696
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:08,320
thing from an

697
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:12,880
herb that's from the

698
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:16,480
ocean that's not from an herbal

699
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:19,960
food now if you can excuse me if you can

700
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:25,080
walk up to the ocean right up to the

701
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:28,159
beach and you can just you know drink of

702
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:32,039
that salt water right there just scoop

703
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:34,000
and just drink it and that would be fine

704
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:35,440
and I would start to believe you or

705
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,519
believe them the

706
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:42,559
naysayers the reason why guys died at

707
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:45,279
Sea was because they drank that salt

708
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:50,000
water the other reason why they died at

709
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:51,919
C they had no vitamin C cuz vitamin C

710
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,200
stops you from

711
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:58,200
dying guess what's in celery

712
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:00,399
juice an unbelievable variety of vitamin

713
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:02,760
C undiscovered by research and

714
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:04,240
science that's what's in celery juice

715
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:06,360
we're going to talk about that another

716
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:09,840
day we're going to go

717
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:12,720
into the whole salt thing now we're not

718
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:14,960
a low salt Society we're a high salt

719
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,880
Society I'm okay with a little pinch of

720
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,720
salt if you want it on some food to

721
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,320
flavor it a really good sea salt a

722
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:25,080
really good Himalayan rock salt I'm not

723
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:28,000
anti I mean I'm not anti a little flavor

724
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:32,399
in somebody's life here and there

725
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:35,559
okay but I'm anti someone ripping a hole

726
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:39,080
in celery over its

727
00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:42,039
sodium when if guys that see that were

728
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:45,240
out of water were drinking celery juice

729
00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:48,360
that whole trip they'd be not only in a

730
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:50,399
incredible condition the sodium would

731
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:53,279
never dehydrate them it would do the

732
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:54,519
opposite it would keep them hydrated on

733
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:56,600
a deep

734
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:58,840
level and that's what we're talking

735
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,600
about that's the differences but

736
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:02,120
remember the naysayers has too much salt

737
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,919
in it and they pass out that information

738
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:06,720
out there the so-called professionals I

739
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:08,960
mean can you believe it I don't want

740
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:12,320
listen I have respect for anybody with

741
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:15,080
credentials I do because it's not who

742
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:18,960
they are as a

743
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:21,480
person okay and I'm proud of anyone who

744
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,559
goes to school I'm proud of anybody who

745
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:26,039
goes to school and they get all the

746
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:27,840
different letters behind their name I'm

747
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:30,039
actually proud of them I feel like it's

748
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,720
a serious accomplishment I'm proud of

749
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:34,639
people I'm also proud of people who

750
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:36,240
don't do that because they're doing

751
00:31:34,639 --> 00:31:39,679
other things in their

752
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:41,159
life you see you see but I notice though

753
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:43,919
you know you can have all the letters

754
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:45,760
behind your name you want all the

755
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:47,440
letters but if you're sitting there

756
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,240
saying there's too much salt and celery

757
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,919
juice so and look out and you're you're

758
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:53,559
advising your people

759
00:31:50,919 --> 00:31:56,159
that you know those letters they just

760
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:58,240
become they're they're empty they're

761
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,919
empty and you want your letters to

762
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,279
matter at the end of your you know at

763
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:03,399
the end of your name if that's what you

764
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:06,200
seek in life so anyone who's got

765
00:32:03,399 --> 00:32:07,919
credentials which I'm a big time Big

766
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,279
Time respect for all doctors and friends

767
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:11,159
I have and everybody else all the

768
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:12,240
different credentials that people have

769
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:14,720
make them

770
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:17,080
count make the make those letters at the

771
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:19,559
end of your name count and not tell

772
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:22,559
somebody hey avoid celery because you

773
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:24,200
know because it's got salt in it you

774
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:26,080
know that's that's that's that's just

775
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:28,519
not going to work

776
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:30,679
because if you keep on doing things like

777
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:33,000
that your letters they just become like

778
00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:34,639
they're hollowed out make them Rich make

779
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,039
those letters after your name rich like

780
00:32:34,639 --> 00:32:39,240
the work you did to get them so and

781
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:40,880
doing that is taking information that's

782
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:44,080
powerful that can change lives and

783
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:46,399
reverse people's conditions and and

784
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:51,760
change your lives and don't make them

785
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:53,720
fear fear fear fear fear celery juice

786
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,600
unbelievable but yet make sure they

787
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,159
throw pinches of sea salt in their water

788
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,440
all the time after they did a workout

789
00:32:57,159 --> 00:33:02,039
out which is utterly

790
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:04,320
ridiculous you want celery juice after a

791
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:05,919
workout so we're going we're in sodium

792
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,519
this sodium one's that important that's

793
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:11,639
why I'm going into

794
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:14,720
this so look we're inundated with salt

795
00:33:11,639 --> 00:33:17,519
in our daily life we just are you can't

796
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:21,080
run from it while there are people who

797
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:22,760
are mindful about it they're a minority

798
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:24,320
the people who are actually mind that

799
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:27,080
are mindful about this their salt

800
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:29,159
consumption is a really it's a minority

801
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:33,159
it's you guys got to know how small it

802
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:35,240
is it's such a small crew of people it's

803
00:33:33,159 --> 00:33:38,360
ridiculous even the people that are

804
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:39,880
mindful about it doesn't mean they even

805
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:44,480
like it hear

806
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:49,159
it so the majority of restaurants rely

807
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:50,799
on salt because if they don't I mean the

808
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:53,440
the majority you know what all

809
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:55,320
restaurants rely on salt they just do

810
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,480
I'm sorry I mean you could ask for salt

811
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:58,960
not to put salt in something at a

812
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,880
restaurant whether it's vegan

813
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,240
plant-based kop keto whatever kind of

814
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:06,519
restaurant that pops up out of the

815
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:08,040
garden the point is is would it relies

816
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:10,480
on salt because it's never going to get

817
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:13,399
a repeat customer if it serves bland

818
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,919
food unless this minority who truly

819
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:16,919
wants to be salt-free and they know the

820
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:18,159
flavors are tasting without the salt you

821
00:34:16,919 --> 00:34:20,320
know walks through the door but that's

822
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,960
not going to keep a restaurant alive I

823
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:24,919
don't know who that one person is that's

824
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:28,280
going to walk into a restaurant and keep

825
00:34:24,919 --> 00:34:30,760
that restaurant alive because it's

826
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:33,599
rare the the majority of restaurants

827
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:35,879
they're all on salt for a reason if you

828
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:38,960
like if you had never eaten food with

829
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:42,000
added salt then went out to eat or tried

830
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:44,359
a package snack you would be staggered

831
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,119
by the overpowering nature of of the

832
00:34:44,359 --> 00:34:48,639
salt itself we put in food so if you

833
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:51,599
were born and you were raised and your

834
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:53,000
mom and your dad your mother and father

835
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:54,560
they were like hey we're just going to

836
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,639
keep salt out of the diet we're just

837
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:59,520
going to do celery juice and this and

838
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:02,680
that and and spinach spinach is salty

839
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:05,119
spinach is very salty in a healthy way

840
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:08,960
too and there's all these other lemon

841
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:10,480
has sodium in it lemon so and you're

842
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,320
getting all these salts from all these

843
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,880
other foods and then you go out and eat

844
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,240
you know you're now a teenager and you

845
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,040
eat in a restaurant for the first time

846
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:21,400
in your life you would literally be

847
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:23,000
blown off your seat and probably

848
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:25,800
consider it's

849
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:29,520
poison probably consider it's

850
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:33,760
poison but we're trained we're

851
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:39,160
brainwashed and trained to consume

852
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:43,680
sodium and then our senses our senses

853
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:45,720
okay in our brain they adapt to it and

854
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:48,520
then they require it or not required for

855
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:50,640
a healthy reason but for

856
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:52,040
happiness and that's how it works I mean

857
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:55,760
that's just a part of

858
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:58,280
it so where does all the salt we eat go

859
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:00,839
does it just go flow right out of our

860
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:02,839
body so easily as it's entered no it

861
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:06,359
doesn't some of it

862
00:36:02,839 --> 00:36:10,200
does even the most premium salt from a

863
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:12,400
jar of organic salsa or the healthiest

864
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:17,160
kitschiest dehydrated

865
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:20,160
crackers or salted nut mix stores even

866
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:21,160
those even those okay a salted nut mix

867
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:25,000
that's really

868
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:28,800
healthy that salt will store itself in

869
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:31,800
cells deep inside the organs and

870
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:35,640
crystallize there it'll crystallize we

871
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:38,440
slowly salt ourselves to death

872
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:40,240
culture and this crystallization of salt

873
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:43,040
builds up inside

874
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:45,720
organs until they're pickled until

875
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:49,520
they're preserved in a bad

876
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:52,079
way I mean it takes decades but it

877
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:54,760
happens and your skin starts getting

878
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:57,079
weird and you start getting

879
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:59,680
older and then somebody say well I don't

880
00:36:57,079 --> 00:37:01,160
know why I'm I'm I'm aging too fast with

881
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,440
my skin and everything else someone's

882
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:05,680
going to say you need

883
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:08,280
collagen you need you need collagen

884
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:10,240
unbelievable and that's not what it is

885
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:12,240
it's because someone has a lifetime of

886
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:14,400
salt crystallization build up in their

887
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:17,280
liver and other

888
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:19,319
organs and they're literally getting

889
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,599
dehydrated on levels you can't even

890
00:37:19,319 --> 00:37:24,920
speak

891
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:27,800
about look the bottom line is salt

892
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:30,400
particularly in beds itself inside your

893
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:32,440
liver because your liver tries to gather

894
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:35,560
it up from your bloodstream to protect

895
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:37,960
you from falling ill because we overuse

896
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:41,119
the overuse of salt which is part of

897
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:46,520
nearly everyone's everyday

898
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:50,240
life okay there in the liver salt sticks

899
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:52,560
around for years sound it like salt

900
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:55,079
sticks is there you know like a salt

901
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:59,680
like a salt stick salt sticks around in

902
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:59,680
the liver for years and becomes

903
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:05,240
toxic that's how it works if we're not

904
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:07,839
cleansing it out someone who worried

905
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:09,960
about their salt and celery should

906
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:11,280
instead be worried about the onslaught

907
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,599
of salt they've had throughout their

908
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,400
whole life and in package food and

909
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:16,960
everything packaged healthy food and in

910
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:19,720
restaurants and dishes and everything

911
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:21,680
else you know that's what they should be

912
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:24,240
worried about the sodium and celery

913
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:26,200
juice is a reprieve from all that and it

914
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,839
does even one thing nobody even knows

915
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:29,720
about this is a huge thing and I talk

916
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:31,240
about it in medical medium celery juice

917
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:34,000
you guys need to know how important this

918
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:37,400
is it provides sodium that not only

919
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,280
doesn't harm us but it helps us when

920
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:42,200
people are concerned about celery juice

921
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:44,880
and sodium what they are really saying

922
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:46,480
is they don't understand celery or

923
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:50,240
celery

924
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:54,480
juice so think about that one it's a

925
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:56,680
blind absum a blind absum with no

926
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:00,079
research in science to back it up when

927
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:03,119
they say that in truth the sodium in

928
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:05,640
celery juice helps loosen up and break

929
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:07,440
apart toxic old sodium deposits that are

930
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:11,359
crystallized in the liver and elsewhere

931
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:13,440
in the body and freeing you from

932
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:16,200
possible problems down the road because

933
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:19,400
the sodium and celery is different

934
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:22,000
celery juices sodium contains sodium

935
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:24,960
cluster salts subgroup of sodium it's

936
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,160
the only thing that does it helps Drive

937
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:29,440
toxic sodium deposits out of the body by

938
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:32,280
attaching themselves to the toxic sodium

939
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:35,760
and carrying it

940
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:39,119
out further the sodium and celery juice

941
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:43,280
is what our blood needs the most and can

942
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:45,760
use the most the most neurotransmitters

943
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:48,640
in our brain thrive on this variety of

944
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:51,359
sodium which has just the right minerals

945
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:55,280
and trace minerals attached to

946
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:58,560
it rather than contains neurotransmitter

947
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:00,760
chemical building block box you see

948
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:02,920
see here's how it works okay let me

949
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:06,520
clarify that last part that might sound

950
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:08,000
confusing and if you're if this is a a

951
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,720
live podcast meaning that you're

952
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,720
listening to like live right now in the

953
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:15,599
moment with me afterwards try to do the

954
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:18,760
replay or whatever down the road in case

955
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:21,599
right on this part this is important

956
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:24,760
so what celer juuse does is it doesn't

957
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:26,800
contain the building blocks to

958
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:30,400
neurotransmitters it does better than

959
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:32,359
that you see somebody's vitamin water

960
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:35,079
with electrolytes somebody's electrolyte

961
00:40:32,359 --> 00:40:36,720
thing somebody's even incredible water

962
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:38,359
they're drinking like the water I like

963
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,920
and stuff that I drink that you guys

964
00:40:38,359 --> 00:40:43,839
prob maybe see me with here and there

965
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:45,280
like all these different things you know

966
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:46,839
I'm not sponsored by any companies or

967
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:49,359
anything or nothing like that and I

968
00:40:46,839 --> 00:40:53,920
still say Brands all the time to you

969
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:55,000
guys but the thing is is with water

970
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,560
there could be these amazing

971
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:00,000
electrolytes naturally occurring in

972
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:03,160
there but they're just building

973
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:06,040
blocks you get some from there some from

974
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:08,640
the salad you just ate some from the

975
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:10,480
other uh fruit that you ate some from

976
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:13,000
the Apple you just ate some from all

977
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:17,680
these different things that you're doing

978
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:20,720
in your life you get all these pieces of

979
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:22,880
electroly building blocks all these

980
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,960
pieces of neurotransmitter chemical

981
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:27,040
building

982
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:30,440
blocks there's only one thing on the

983
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:33,000
planet that gives you the full

984
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:34,119
thing that's why people have Clarity get

985
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,240
the rid of their brain fog all these

986
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:36,960
other things start happening their life

987
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:38,720
starts changing anxiety starts dropping

988
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,440
their depression starts getting better I

989
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:43,839
talk about this in medical medium celery

990
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,880
juice you got to get the book you have

991
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:47,000
to get the

992
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:51,040
book you have

993
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:54,040
to and the thing is this is what I'm

994
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:58,319
trying to tell you is the celery juice

995
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:59,880
has the complete electroly like complete

996
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:02,400
so the neurotransmitter chemical can

997
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:03,880
revive itself not just a building block

998
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,280
like a little bit in this water a little

999
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,839
bit in this thing you eat a little bit

1000
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,480
in this then you're going through the de

1001
00:42:06,839 --> 00:42:11,400
day and you're trying to collect pieces

1002
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:15,440
you're trying to collect them minerals

1003
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:17,160
that find their way to neurons by chance

1004
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,720
when you're just collecting them like

1005
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:21,359
that they're just minerals that are

1006
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,960
finding their way to neurons by chance

1007
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:24,440
depending on what someone's eating or

1008
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,480
drinking what water they're drinking

1009
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:28,040
what what they're eating what they're

1010
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:31,359
doing think about that celery juice is

1011
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:34,640
the only food on the planet to offer

1012
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:36,920
complete activated

1013
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:38,359
electrolytes even with coconut water you

1014
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:40,040
don't get complete see that's what I'm

1015
00:42:38,359 --> 00:42:41,319
trying to say if you had coconut water

1016
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:43,200
last week you got a couple of the

1017
00:42:41,319 --> 00:42:45,079
building blocks to your neurotransmitter

1018
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:47,800
chemicals and if you had some good high

1019
00:42:45,079 --> 00:42:49,640
quality water like Fiji or something you

1020
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:51,599
got you know there you go you got

1021
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:54,599
another one when you're out there or if

1022
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:57,559
you did this or whatever and you get the

1023
00:42:54,599 --> 00:43:00,200
building blocks but coconut water isn't

1024
00:42:57,559 --> 00:43:03,000
a complete it's not a complete it's just

1025
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:04,520
pieces of them celery juice is complete

1026
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,599
that's why you have to drink it every

1027
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:09,319
single day it offers a complete

1028
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:11,680
neurotransmitter chemical that are

1029
00:43:09,319 --> 00:43:14,000
already bonded together to reignite

1030
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:15,880
weaken

1031
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,640
neurotransmitters

1032
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:22,520
after and and and it offers the ultimate

1033
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:24,640
neuron relief our neurons in our brain

1034
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:27,839
this gives our them our you know

1035
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:31,000
ultimate neuron relief

1036
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:32,599
when electricity flows it can flow more

1037
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:37,280
freely through a

1038
00:43:32,599 --> 00:43:39,119
neuron with neurotransmitter chemicals

1039
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:42,240
restored by the complete

1040
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:44,599
neurotransmitter chemical option that's

1041
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:47,440
in celery

1042
00:43:44,599 --> 00:43:50,480
juice celery juices naturally occurring

1043
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:52,599
beneficial sodium is a part of this you

1044
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,920
can't get this in SE salt Himalayan rock

1045
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:56,200
salt or something else remember science

1046
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:57,800
and research is so behind with with

1047
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:59,440
chronic illness you guys have to know

1048
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,880
this every time I'm interviewed now I

1049
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,160
say the same thing you ready I didn't

1050
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:04,559
know everybody was better I didn't know

1051
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:06,240
science and research got everybody

1052
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:08,040
better that's what I tell every

1053
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:10,640
interviewer now and then they just go

1054
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:13,400
and write smack about me and put and try

1055
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:15,079
to publish it because they're irritated

1056
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,640
I say it every time I didn't know the

1057
00:44:15,079 --> 00:44:19,079
science of research you keep on throwing

1058
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,960
at me that doesn't support celery or

1059
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:22,440
support me or something like that I

1060
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,839
didn't know science of research had

1061
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:25,559
everybody better I didn't know there was

1062
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:27,960
wasn't like two billion sick people with

1063
00:44:25,559 --> 00:44:29,559
symptoms on this planet may actually

1064
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:32,640
more than that with symptoms way more

1065
00:44:29,559 --> 00:44:34,400
than that I didn't know I thought oh so

1066
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,920
you mean they're not all fixed or wait

1067
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,200
they're all fixed everybody's better

1068
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:39,559
that's what I'm trying to say with the

1069
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:41,319
science of research you know about

1070
00:44:39,559 --> 00:44:44,359
anybody with chronic

1071
00:44:41,319 --> 00:44:46,359
illness when it was just a decade ago

1072
00:44:44,359 --> 00:44:50,880
they told women to just go and get go

1073
00:44:46,359 --> 00:44:54,480
and get a job if you are lazy and

1074
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:57,960
tired you're bored you're making it up

1075
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,960
think about that

1076
00:44:58,839 --> 00:45:04,520
unbelievable

1077
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:06,760
look as I say all water is not the same

1078
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:09,680
and all sugar is not the same we'll add

1079
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:12,520
this to the list not all salts the

1080
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:15,000
same how about that let's go in the

1081
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:18,280
water this is a good

1082
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:21,359
one let's hit the water one on the

1083
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:24,040
subject of water if anyone tells you

1084
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:26,359
that drinking celery juice is the same

1085
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:28,599
as drinking water know this they are far

1086
00:45:26,359 --> 00:45:30,200
from the same what you hear from

1087
00:45:28,599 --> 00:45:32,319
dieticians nutritionists health coaches

1088
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:34,760
or whoever or

1089
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:37,200
trainers there's some like trainer guy

1090
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:39,520
out there socalled he's he's known or

1091
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:41,079
something which I beg to differ he's

1092
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:43,520
like he's sitting here telling me

1093
00:45:41,079 --> 00:45:45,000
there's no stomach glands meaning he's

1094
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:47,160
he's saying it on social media he's not

1095
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,640
telling me he's probably trying to tell

1096
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:50,240
me there's no such thing as stomach

1097
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:53,119
glands and he posted

1098
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:55,559
that I there's no sto there's no such

1099
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:57,680
thing as stomach glands what are you

1100
00:45:55,559 --> 00:45:59,599
talking about of course there is they

1101
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:01,040
create gastric they gastric juices

1102
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:05,160
gastric

1103
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:08,240
acids correct I mean it's correct they

1104
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:10,359
they actually you know create all kinds

1105
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:13,920
of

1106
00:46:10,359 --> 00:46:15,839
HCL hydrochloric acid and that's a

1107
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:17,440
stomach glands but let's go into water a

1108
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:19,480
little bit you'll get these same

1109
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:21,680
professionals out there that are just

1110
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:23,319
quick to just try to deter people from

1111
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:25,079
doing anything good for themselves cuz

1112
00:46:23,319 --> 00:46:27,720
they think they want to own their space

1113
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:29,200
and they want to be The Authority so

1114
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:30,960
they just knock down powerful

1115
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:34,280
information they'll try to like celery

1116
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:38,040
juice and they'll say it's all water oh

1117
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:39,599
that's interesting okay well every

1118
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:41,559
single person that I've ever talked to

1119
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:43,920
that had a chronic illness or every

1120
00:46:41,559 --> 00:46:47,960
single person that's ever had a

1121
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:50,319
symptom I you know water didn't fix it

1122
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:52,200
sure someone could be

1123
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:54,079
dehydrated and they could be getting one

1124
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:55,800
of those lowgrade headaches or something

1125
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:58,920
and they up their water and it impr

1126
00:46:55,800 --> 00:47:01,839
proves them but people with

1127
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:04,480
hashimotos people with thyroid disorders

1128
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:05,800
hyperthyroid people with rheid arthritis

1129
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:09,119
people with multiple sclerosis Lyme

1130
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:11,599
disease people with trigeminal neuralgia

1131
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:15,200
water doesn't fix people with eczema

1132
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:18,280
sasis dermatitis rosacea water doesn't

1133
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:20,800
fix people with lyan sclerosis water

1134
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:23,119
doesn't fix Vitiligo water doesn't

1135
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,960
fix people with severe chronic fatigue

1136
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:26,839
neurological fatigue or even fatigue

1137
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:29,160
that's just mild but still always there

1138
00:47:26,839 --> 00:47:32,559
water never fixes

1139
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:34,480
ever people with headaches migraines

1140
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:36,760
severe migraines back in the neck pain

1141
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:39,559
body pain back pain feet pain Mort

1142
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:42,119
Norton's Morton's neuroma plant

1143
00:47:39,559 --> 00:47:45,079
fasciitis

1144
00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:46,599
digitises in fix I'm going to go on a

1145
00:47:45,079 --> 00:47:48,200
little more people with diabetes water

1146
00:47:46,599 --> 00:47:50,880
doesn't fix but celery juice actually

1147
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:53,640
reverses diabetes what else I mean we

1148
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:56,119
can go on and on and on and on and on if

1149
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:59,920
you actually want to insult The Chronic

1150
00:47:56,119 --> 00:48:02,240
ill really insult them tell them they're

1151
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:06,040
getting better or they think they're

1152
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:09,000
getting better with a placebo effect

1153
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:10,960
possibly because there's water in celery

1154
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,920
juice and they happen to just be you

1155
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:15,839
know kneading a little extra water

1156
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:18,839
because they're not drinking enough

1157
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:20,520
water during the day ever so because now

1158
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:22,400
they're juicing celery juice that's

1159
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:25,160
what's giving them a better feeling

1160
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:26,440
let's just insult The Chronic Le by

1161
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:27,880
saying that well that's what the

1162
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:29,359
dietitians are saying they're saying In

1163
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:31,440
Articles they say it out there they're

1164
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:32,680
talking about that places that's where

1165
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,119
you know naysayers are saying

1166
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:35,480
nutritionists whoever and I'm not

1167
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:36,880
against dietitians or anything like

1168
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:38,160
there's really some amazing ones that

1169
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,800
actually are drinking celery juice and

1170
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:41,960
promoting celery juice talking about the

1171
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:45,079
naysayers anywhere naysayer doctors the

1172
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:48,400
naysayers the naysayer people

1173
00:48:45,079 --> 00:48:50,799
whatever so that's what's happening here

1174
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,400
when sources say that the only reason

1175
00:48:50,799 --> 00:48:53,960
chronically ill are getting their lives

1176
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:56,079
back from celery juice is because it

1177
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:58,359
offers water it's almost incon conable

1178
00:48:56,079 --> 00:49:00,160
I'm sorry but it's almost inconceivable

1179
00:48:58,359 --> 00:49:02,240
it shows confusion and a lack of

1180
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:04,000
experience and understanding of what

1181
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:06,000
people have gone through and suffered

1182
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,520
with I've seen it I know it I've been

1183
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,880
there with people side by side I've been

1184
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,640
by their bedsides why they've been

1185
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,559
suffering I've seen it all and this

1186
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:15,160
means they don't know anything about it

1187
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:18,000
or what they've been through and what

1188
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:20,480
they've tried it shows confusion and

1189
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,599
lack of experience I swear to God and an

1190
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:24,359
lack of understanding people with

1191
00:49:22,599 --> 00:49:27,359
symptoms and

1192
00:49:24,359 --> 00:49:30,200
illnesses and and what they need to do

1193
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:33,079
to just be on a daily basis to survive

1194
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:34,480
yes celery juice has more water content

1195
00:49:33,079 --> 00:49:37,240
than other

1196
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:40,400
sources but it doesn't have more water

1197
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:42,319
content than a cucumber juice it doesn't

1198
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,799
have meaning like you C juice cucumbers

1199
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:46,280
and you got a whole thing of cucumber

1200
00:49:43,799 --> 00:49:49,960
juice or you just something it's it it's

1201
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:52,960
still not as much as that celery juice

1202
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:56,799
has more water yes but it's hydrob

1203
00:49:52,960 --> 00:50:00,079
bioactive water it's benefit beneficial

1204
00:49:56,799 --> 00:50:02,880
yeah is that my word that's my word

1205
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:05,079
where's it from Spirit anybody who's

1206
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:07,119
ever listened to my shows or just tuning

1207
00:50:05,079 --> 00:50:09,839
in here wondering where this information

1208
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:11,720
comes I hope I don't burst your bubble

1209
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:14,720
and get you to run the other way but it

1210
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:17,760
comes from Spirit since I was age

1211
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:18,839
four it's hydrob bioactive you don't

1212
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:21,040
trust my

1213
00:50:18,839 --> 00:50:22,920
information well then how come I'm the

1214
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:24,559
actually first one that said Epstein bar

1215
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:25,920
causes Hashim modus thyroiditis and I've

1216
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:28,440
been saying it for decades and now

1217
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:30,240
science of research they're worried and

1218
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:31,520
so now they're putting out papers saying

1219
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:33,559
they think it's linked to it because

1220
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:35,119
they don't want me to be the so-called

1221
00:50:33,559 --> 00:50:38,359
hero of that

1222
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:42,359
Discovery and that's from Spirit since I

1223
00:50:38,359 --> 00:50:44,760
was a kid so and lemon water flushing

1224
00:50:42,359 --> 00:50:46,680
the liver that's mine for decades now

1225
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:49,520
but yet it's like law out there now so

1226
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:51,920
it is what it is it's not a simple

1227
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:52,839
matter of water content that's getting

1228
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:55,440
people

1229
00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:57,640
better if it were if it were ever

1230
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:02,559
everyone who had tried increasing their

1231
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:02,559
water intake would have already gotten

1232
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:08,359
better it's unbelievable on the subject

1233
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:10,200
of water if anyone tells you that

1234
00:51:08,359 --> 00:51:12,359
drinking celery juice is the same as

1235
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:15,200
drinking water know this they are far

1236
00:51:12,359 --> 00:51:17,000
from the same water does have naturally

1237
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:19,160
occurring electrolytes and especially if

1238
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:22,200
it's high quality water like say like

1239
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:24,640
fij or something still those

1240
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:27,359
electrolytes provide entirely different

1241
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:30,240
benefits from nose and celery juice this

1242
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:33,480
is not even comparing apples to oranges

1243
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:36,040
it's like comparing apples to beef water

1244
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:39,200
and celery juice are two completely

1245
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:41,960
different substances on all levels only

1246
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:43,799
the herb celery contains the sodium

1247
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:44,839
cluster salts the special vitamin C I

1248
00:51:43,799 --> 00:51:46,520
talk about all the different

1249
00:51:44,839 --> 00:51:47,960
antioxidants I talk about in the celery

1250
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:49,520
juice book all the different

1251
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:50,960
phytochemical compounds that are

1252
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:53,920
undiscovered I talk about in the celery

1253
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:55,559
juice special enzymes trace minerals

1254
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:58,640
that make celery juice what it is is

1255
00:51:55,559 --> 00:52:01,280
it's suspended it's thick as for putting

1256
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:03,359
a pinch of salt in a glass of water

1257
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:05,319
thinking that that's the same or better

1258
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:07,960
this is even more misguided you

1259
00:52:05,319 --> 00:52:10,000
dehydrating yourself I promise you

1260
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:12,040
that's what you're doing celery juice on

1261
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,520
the other hand is hydrating on a deep

1262
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:19,119
level celery juices salt

1263
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:22,480
water are two different

1264
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:25,000
worlds so celery juice versus salt water

1265
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:26,599
are two different worlds they're just

1266
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,280
salt water is an entirely different

1267
00:52:26,599 --> 00:52:30,520
Beast the bottom

1268
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:32,640
line so you have to know that mixing

1269
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:34,839
celery juice with water is not a good

1270
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:37,280
move don't do it because they're so

1271
00:52:34,839 --> 00:52:40,119
different they clash and you stop

1272
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:43,520
getting your celery juice to work if

1273
00:52:40,119 --> 00:52:47,240
celery juice was all water and that's

1274
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:50,040
how it helped you why would mixing water

1275
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:51,960
harm it it kills it literally dilutes it

1276
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:54,880
and kills it and destroys it cuz it's

1277
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:57,440
not water they got to remember that

1278
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:59,559
there's friction between them you can't

1279
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:01,240
add you it's like oil and water you

1280
00:52:59,559 --> 00:53:04,520
can't there's friction or whatever you

1281
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:06,880
say adding water to celery juice dilutes

1282
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:10,160
the sodium cluster salts and deactivates

1283
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:12,400
them while also interferes with trace

1284
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:14,680
minerals enzymes some of the most

1285
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:18,119
powerful aspects of celery juice that

1286
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:21,160
helps us heal adding ice cubes to celery

1287
00:53:18,119 --> 00:53:22,760
juice same thing bad it destroys the

1288
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:24,480
ability of the celer juice to heal the

1289
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:26,680
body here's another point to keep in

1290
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:28,960
mind when it comes to celery juice some

1291
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:30,440
sources say that people only feel better

1292
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:33,480
from celery juice because they're

1293
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:36,760
getting hydrated by its water

1294
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:39,200
content these sources say it has nothing

1295
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:41,720
to do with celery juice itself this is

1296
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:43,440
an inadvertent insult to the chronically

1297
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:45,200
Hill remember that I told you that

1298
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:47,200
earlier it's like telling people who

1299
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:48,880
have been sick for months or years who

1300
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:50,799
have looked for everything tried

1301
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:52,799
everything you name it to drink more

1302
00:53:50,799 --> 00:53:55,960
water that'll fix your

1303
00:53:52,799 --> 00:53:59,839
problem staying hydrated

1304
00:53:55,960 --> 00:54:02,440
is the first advice that any doctor ever

1305
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:03,559
offers anybody in health and wellness

1306
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:06,000
when they're

1307
00:54:03,559 --> 00:54:08,240
sick and people carry their water

1308
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,880
bottles everywhere feverishly with them

1309
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:13,119
because of it and remind themselves to

1310
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:14,520
drink more water it doesn't get

1311
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:16,799
everybody out of chronic illness I'm

1312
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:18,480

who have been in the weeds tried

1314
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:23,720
everything for years water isn't doing

1315
00:54:21,559 --> 00:54:26,240
it but I don't want you to stop drinking

1316
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:28,160
water because you need the water yes but

1317
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:30,000
it doesn't pull people out of the depths

1318
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:31,559
