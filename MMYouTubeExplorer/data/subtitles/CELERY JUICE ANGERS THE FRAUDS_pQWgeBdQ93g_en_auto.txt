[222.64 - 227.44] left and right front and center i can't
[225.36 - 229.52] tell you how many times the media has
[227.44 - 232.00] come to me and says we want to do an
[229.52 - 233.68] article we want to do an article on
[232.00 - 234.64] medical medium
[233.68 - 236.40] and
[234.64 - 238.16] we want to do something on the celery
[236.40 - 240.40] juice because we don't believe it works
[238.16 - 241.76] for patients and clients and all the

[247.52 - 251.60] people and how many people are healing
[249.44 - 254.24] and they write up the article and they
[251.60 - 256.56] do a crappy shitty job and then they put
[254.24 - 258.24] some dietitian in there and they put
[256.56 - 260.32] some functional doctor in there and that
[258.24 - 262.00] doctor says nope celery juice is not
[260.32 - 264.24] proven by science and research to help
[262.00 - 265.84] anybody so all the claims from all the

[273.52 - 277.68] are whoever you are that doesn't matter
[275.68 - 279.36] what angle
[277.68 - 282.08] because the minute

[282.08 - 286.08] someone getting miraculous healing
[284.24 - 287.92] getting their lives back getting rid of

[302.56 - 306.16] you're if you're some kind of health
[304.56 - 308.32] guru and health professional and you

[310.08 - 315.20] because it's going to give you a problem
[312.48 - 319.12] you're a fraud man bottom line and guess
[315.20 - 321.20] who exposed it celery exposed it
[319.12 - 324.32] lorraine l hey loren l good to see you
[321.20 - 326.64] today amazing the cashier that sold me
[324.32 - 328.00] my celery today told me i was better off
[326.64 - 330.08] just eating it
[328.00 - 332.64] you can imagine my response laugh out
[330.08 - 335.84] loud i was polite but i set her straight
[332.64 - 337.36] he he lorraine because she heard it from
[335.84 - 339.52] somewhere else she heard it from a
[337.36 - 341.68] professional she heard it from an
[339.52 - 343.52] article she heard it from a functional
[341.68 - 345.28] doctor she heard it from a chinese
[343.52 - 347.04] medicine doctor she heard it from a
[345.28 - 348.72] registered dietitian she heard it from a
[347.04 - 350.40] naturopathic doctor
[348.72 - 354.00] she heard it from a western naturopathic
[350.40 - 357.20] doctor whatever and what she heard
[354.00 - 360.64] was a health professional being exposed
[357.20 - 364.00] as a fraud because celery juice
[360.64 - 365.36] exposes and angers the frauds
[364.00 - 368.40] that's all it is
[365.36 - 371.20] so whoever told that cashier
[368.40 - 373.84] not to drink the celery juice and was a
[371.20 - 376.48] professional in any kind of arena of
[373.84 - 379.12] health doesn't care about the person
[376.48 - 383.12] healing doesn't care which means they're
[379.12 - 383.12] not in it for the patient to win it
[383.76 - 388.88] angela gibbons my psoriasis is so much
[386.48 - 390.96] better and healing a lot nothing else
[388.88 - 392.48] moved the needle no matter how much
[390.96 - 394.16] money i spent with a variety of
[392.48 - 395.28] practitioners over the last six years
[394.16 - 396.88] exactly
[395.28 - 400.24] and if there's a practitioner that
[396.88 - 402.08] denies it or denies someone's story last
[400.24 - 404.56] five years unbelievable denies that
[402.08 - 406.80] story denies what it can do and then
[404.56 - 408.80] turns around after hearing that story
[406.80 - 411.28] and says to another patient don't you
[408.80 - 413.04] drink celery juice then they are a fraud
[411.28 - 414.48] because what it is is they're not in it
[413.04 - 417.04] for the patient to win it and get their
[414.48 - 418.88] lives back and crawl out of that place
[417.04 - 421.20] they're not in it to help people get out
[418.88 - 423.20] of that get out of that hell from being
[421.20 - 424.00] sick they're not they're not in it for
[423.20 - 425.84] that
[424.00 - 427.12] and that's what celery juice does it
[425.84 - 429.76] exposes

[916.88 - 920.32] well somebody's saying can't get sound
[918.40 - 921.28] so obviously not hearing me you on
[920.32 - 924.00] youtube
[921.28 - 926.96] go to youtube
[924.00 - 928.40] facebook and instagram knock the sound
[926.96 - 931.04] out
[928.40 - 933.20] and kick people off so
[931.04 - 934.32] just go to youtube i honestly i might
[933.20 - 936.48] stop
[934.32 - 939.28] doing lives on facebook
[936.48 - 940.88] and instagram completely and never do it
[939.28 - 942.64] live on there again and i might just do
[940.88 - 944.56] it on youtube only
[942.64 - 947.04] and if you're not on youtube then you're
[944.56 - 949.68] not there whatever but i might only be
[947.04 - 953.68] doing youtube lives and only that
[949.68 - 956.08] unless me we unless miui has a um an
[953.68 - 957.84] option for me to go live so when they
[956.08 - 959.68] have that option i'll probably probably
[957.84 - 962.16] be on there only for something on
[959.68 - 962.16] youtube
[962.48 - 965.52] tick tock too i might not be on there
[964.24 - 969.07] live in the future either because they
[965.52 - 971.36] don't notify anybody
[969.07 - 974.72] [Music]
[971.36 - 977.28] this is the mm 900 hps
[974.72 - 979.28] it's 20 percent off at megajuicers.com
[977.28 - 981.12] just so you guys know
[979.28 - 982.96] it's a medical device
[981.12 - 984.08] why would i
[982.96 - 986.64] back
[984.08 - 988.95] and support
[986.64 - 990.32] a juicer
[988.95 - 991.92] [Applause]
[990.32 - 994.72] because it's a medical device that can
[991.92 - 994.72] save you money
[995.36 - 1001.52] mj taurus doctors say that it's not
[997.68 - 1004.00] healthy to drink it daily oh really
[1001.52 - 1005.60] where would they get such a uh piece of
[1004.00 - 1007.44] information that would
[1005.60 - 1010.00] science and research come up with that
[1007.44 - 1011.92] no they don't do anything on celery so
[1010.00 - 1014.08] doctors say that it's not healthy to
[1011.92 - 1016.72] drink it daily because celery contains
[1014.08 - 1018.16] oxalates
[1016.72 - 1020.40] and these interfere with calcium
[1018.16 - 1022.88] absorption okay
[1020.40 - 1024.96] but it but doctors are okay with green
[1022.88 - 1027.04] tea daily caffeine right
[1024.96 - 1028.56] age you give you sun spots burn out your
[1027.04 - 1031.36] adrenals
[1028.56 - 1033.84] just burn you out coffee's okay daily
[1031.36 - 1036.08] yeah chocolate's okay daily
[1033.84 - 1037.44] those are okay daily by doctors that's
[1036.08 - 1039.92] right because the caffeine industry
[1037.44 - 1041.36] guess what is part of pharma
[1039.92 - 1042.88] there's caffeine almost in every single
[1041.36 - 1044.32] pharmaceutical even the ones they say
[1042.88 - 1045.92] there isn't
[1044.32 - 1047.44] so caffeine's in every single
[1045.92 - 1049.44] pharmaceutical
[1047.44 - 1050.84] it's a psychoactive drug but that's okay
[1049.44 - 1053.36] to do daily
[1050.84 - 1055.44] sure let's get our kids addicted to
[1053.36 - 1056.88] caffeine too so they're drinking coffee
[1055.44 - 1058.32] nice and early
[1056.88 - 1059.68] then they're just addicted to caffeine
[1058.32 - 1061.44] and espressos and everything else
[1059.68 - 1063.92] burning out their adrenals
[1061.44 - 1065.52] and oxalates that's a funny one because
[1063.92 - 1067.36] oxalates are in every single fruit and
[1065.52 - 1069.04] vegetable urban spice so don't eat a
[1067.36 - 1070.08] fruit and vegetable again
[1069.04 - 1072.32] uh
[1070.08 - 1074.56] don't oxalates are in grass grass-fed
[1072.32 - 1078.32] beef
[1074.56 - 1080.64] cattle that's eating grass are ingesting
[1078.32 - 1082.24] and consuming oxalates from the grass
[1080.64 - 1083.44] their meat is filled with oxalates but
[1082.24 - 1084.80] don't eat meat so you know what i guess
[1083.44 - 1086.00] you just don't eat
[1084.80 - 1087.36] don't eat meat
[1086.00 - 1089.44] don't eat uh
[1087.36 - 1091.60] we're going to eat turkey
[1089.44 - 1093.28] just be on turkey
[1091.60 - 1094.96] turkey has a little less oxalates in it
[1093.28 - 1096.08] than anything else why don't you just be
[1094.96 - 1098.16] on turkey
[1096.08 - 1100.16] don't eat anything no fruit no vegetable
[1098.16 - 1102.08] don't do celery don't do anything just
[1100.16 - 1103.92] eat turkey
[1102.08 - 1105.52] and then you can't poo
[1103.92 - 1107.12] and then you'll get a hernia and then
[1105.52 - 1109.04] you'll be getting a surgery and then you
[1107.12 - 1111.84] know what they'll have you on insurer or
[1109.04 - 1113.60] something in the hospital how about that
[1111.84 - 1115.36] it's a bad theory the oxalate theory
[1113.60 - 1117.12] isn't even real it's a bad theory
[1115.36 - 1118.32] because nobody knows why anybody's sick
[1117.12 - 1121.12] i remember
[1118.32 - 1122.96] the oxalate theory came out of the the
[1121.12 - 1124.72] the whole
[1122.96 - 1127.28] like bloom of chronic illness where
[1124.72 - 1130.40] nobody knew was that why anybody is sick
[1127.28 - 1132.96] in the 1970s and 1980s nobody knew why
[1130.40 - 1134.72] anybody was sick 1990s people suffering
[1132.96 - 1136.40] and laying in bed nobody knew why
[1134.72 - 1138.32] anybody has anything nobody knows why
[1136.40 - 1140.56] people have ms nobody knows anything
[1138.32 - 1142.88] oxalates was a theory along with other
[1140.56 - 1146.24] things like that
[1142.88 - 1148.32] you know i mean really that's what it is
[1146.24 - 1150.88] meanwhile heavy metals and pathogens are
[1148.32 - 1152.72] why people get sick viruses bacteria
[1150.88 - 1154.40] toxic heavy metals
[1152.72 - 1156.56] you know that's why we get sick and then
[1154.40 - 1158.48] we get intoxicated from perfumes and
[1156.56 - 1160.56] colognes and air fresheners and scented
[1158.48 - 1162.88] candles and then we get intoxicated by
[1160.56 - 1165.20] caffeine so doctors will support
[1162.88 - 1167.44] caffeine i know because they are all the
[1165.20 - 1169.68] chiropractors are supporting it you're
[1167.44 - 1171.68] right all the chiropractors that's a

[1237.92 - 1240.80] it's not because i didn't take it's not
[1239.44 - 1243.04] because i didn't it's not because of the
[1240.80 - 1244.32] celery juice i drink
[1243.04 - 1246.32] if i die

[1248.24 - 1253.12] and wild foods i've eaten
[1250.72 - 1255.60] if i die it's because yeah i did it to

[1443.52 - 1449.60] on a sidewalk you crack your head open
[1447.28 - 1451.60] when you're 20 years old your skull is
[1449.60 - 1454.00] thick enough to not crack it open so
[1451.60 - 1458.16] easily you will sustain some pretty good
[1454.00 - 1461.44] confusions and blows but not have this
[1458.16 - 1462.96] fracture across half your skull
[1461.44 - 1464.56] unless it's a hit that just can't be
[1462.96 - 1466.64] avoided it's a hit that's just so hard
[1464.56 - 1468.96] then it'll crack anybody's call
[1466.64 - 1471.44] the point is is our skulls
[1468.96 - 1474.64] get diminished they get eaten away from
[1471.44 - 1476.72] the inside out from caffeine
[1474.64 - 1477.60] and vinegar and guess where the calcium
[1476.72 - 1480.88] goes
[1477.60 - 1483.36] in your kidneys and builds a stone
[1480.88 - 1484.72] not from some phantom oxalate made-up
[1483.36 - 1486.96] story that there's no science and
[1484.72 - 1489.20] research behind
[1486.96 - 1490.80] the high fat diets
[1489.20 - 1494.16] are so acidic
[1490.80 - 1496.48] fatty acid how should i say that
[1494.16 - 1498.72] fatty acids
[1496.48 - 1500.72] fatty acids
[1498.72 - 1502.64] fat is acid
[1500.72 - 1504.24] all the fat is acid your butter straight
[1502.64 - 1505.92] acid
[1504.24 - 1507.68] your dairy products your straight acid
[1505.92 - 1509.68] your butter straight acid your eggs are
[1507.68 - 1512.16] straight acid they're not alkalizing on
[1509.68 - 1514.32] any level they're all acid fat fat fat
[1512.16 - 1516.40] is acid and then you lose your bones and
[1514.32 - 1518.64] then you add more acid to it you guys
[1516.40 - 1521.28] pump the kombucha tea because it's being
[1518.64 - 1523.44] pumped by money 24 7. kombucha tea
[1521.28 - 1524.96] people hate the celery juice thing
[1523.44 - 1526.64] because it people say well you know what
[1524.96 - 1528.24] i'm going to spend my money on celery
[1526.64 - 1531.84] juice i'm not going to spend it on
[1528.24 - 1534.00] buying more expensive kombucha tea
[1531.84 - 1535.92] celery juice exposes those frauds like i
[1534.00 - 1537.36] said before
[1535.92 - 1539.92] kombucha tea
[1537.36 - 1543.60] literally dissolves your bones
[1539.92 - 1545.20] vinegar dissolves your bones
[1543.60 - 1547.60] okay
[1545.20 - 1549.60] fat dissolves your bones and then that
[1547.60 - 1551.84] calcium ends up in your kidneys and in
[1549.60 - 1555.28] your gallbladder that's
[1551.84 - 1557.28] a fact jack entirely different than what
[1555.28 - 1559.20] people think they think they're wrong
[1557.28 - 1561.52] misinformation out there and it's really
[1559.20 - 1561.52] sad
[1565.04 - 1569.68] if i had a kidney problem on any level
[1567.20 - 1571.12] or kidney stones if i had anything like
[1569.68 - 1573.92] that you know what i'd be doing if i was
[1571.12 - 1576.08] an animal protein eater gone gone no
[1573.92 - 1577.76] animal protein for me
[1576.08 - 1579.12] and i'm not even against animal protein
[1577.76 - 1580.64] eating for people
[1579.12 - 1581.60] i'm pro-animal protein if that's what
[1580.64 - 1583.20] your heart desires and i'm
[1581.60 - 1585.92] pro-plant-based if you guys want to be
[1583.20 - 1587.20] eating lettuce all day i completely i'm
[1585.92 - 1590.08] on your side
[1587.20 - 1591.92] but i want you guys to do it right
[1590.08 - 1595.04] so that you can heal
[1591.92 - 1597.76] but if i had a kidney problem man that
[1595.04 - 1599.44] that animal protein would be gone boom
[1597.76 - 1601.12] you think i mean i would i would get rid
[1599.44 - 1602.16] of that stuff so fast it wouldn't even
[1601.12 - 1604.72] be funny
[1602.16 - 1604.72] be gone
[1607.60 - 1612.80] so if i had a kidney problem or kidney
[1609.76 - 1615.36] stones those meat patties
[1612.80 - 1617.68] those meat patties toss them out
[1615.36 - 1620.72] chicken chicken cutlets those chicken
[1617.68 - 1622.64] breasts grilled gone if i had a kidney
[1620.72 - 1624.88] problem that's what you that's what
[1622.64 - 1626.40] you're going to have tell your husband
[1624.88 - 1628.16] any kind of kidney issues tell your
[1626.40 - 1629.68] husband it ain't the oxalates you got to
[1628.16 - 1631.04] worry about you keep on eating that
[1629.68 - 1633.84] chicken he's going to wind up with
[1631.04 - 1636.32] another another kidney problem
[1633.84 - 1640.44] even salmon
[1636.32 - 1640.44] i'm not against animal proteins
[1641.12 - 1644.56] i'm just telling you how it works
[1645.76 - 1649.28] okay so let's talk about uh celery juice
[1647.76 - 1650.40] i want to strain it you guys got to
[1649.28 - 1651.84] strain it
[1650.40 - 1654.32] you have to
[1651.84 - 1656.56] now i just juiced this right the mm-900
[1654.32 - 1659.04] hds
[1656.56 - 1662.24] this is dry this pulp
[1659.04 - 1663.68] this pulp is dry
[1662.24 - 1665.04] it's dry
[1663.68 - 1667.44] saving money
[1665.04 - 1670.00] every celery stick that goes in
[1667.44 - 1672.00] saves you money
[1670.00 - 1674.48] you buy half the celery of what you used
[1672.00 - 1675.92] to buy at least for me
[1674.48 - 1677.76] that's what it is i used to have to go
[1675.92 - 1679.44] and buy two cases of celery now i only
[1677.76 - 1681.36] need one case of celery i used to have
[1679.44 - 1683.68] to go buy a case of celery now i only
[1681.36 - 1685.92] need a half a case of celery
[1683.68 - 1687.52] this juicer has paid for itself dozens
[1685.92 - 1689.68] of times at this point i can't count it
[1687.52 - 1691.76] anymore it has paid for itself over and
[1689.68 - 1694.08] over again

[1735.68 - 1738.96] inexpensive and then boom they're saving
[1738.08 - 1740.64] money
[1738.96 - 1743.28] that's the whole thing
[1740.64 - 1746.00] and i'd rather have this medical device
[1743.28 - 1748.16] than be hooked up to tubes
[1746.00 - 1750.56] i'd rather have this medical device be
[1748.16 - 1754.64] all hooked up to to oxygen because of
[1750.56 - 1754.64] oxygen going up my nostrils
[1756.72 - 1760.48] that omega juicer
[1758.56 - 1762.32] is incredible
[1760.48 - 1764.00] one of the best investments ever you
[1762.32 - 1764.88] know why you know also it is incredible
[1764.00 - 1766.40] and you know why it's one of the best
[1764.88 - 1768.32] investments and you know why because
[1766.40 - 1769.84] you're you're literally gonna save money
[1768.32 - 1771.52] it's gonna pay for itself over and over
[1769.84 - 1772.72] again i've never seen a juicer out of
[1771.52 - 1774.72] all the juicers out there i've never
[1772.72 - 1776.72] seen a juicer you guys pay for itself
[1774.72 - 1778.64] and pay for itself and pay for itself
[1776.72 - 1780.40] it's ridiculous it's almost stupid at
[1778.64 - 1782.64] this point it's stupid
[1780.40 - 1784.32] literally it's stupid it you know what i
[1782.64 - 1786.00] counted like it paid for itself by its
[1784.32 - 1787.28] 10th time one time because i was keeping
[1786.00 - 1789.12] track of all the numbers in the in the
[1787.28 - 1791.28] usage and how much celery juice and all
[1789.12 - 1793.28] that and how much i buy and it paid for
[1791.28 - 1795.20] itself like for its 10th time and i said
[1793.28 - 1796.64] at this point it's just stupid
[1795.20 - 1798.56] that's how ridiculous that's how
[1796.64 - 1801.12] incredible it is it just it got it got
[1798.56 - 1804.55] dumb got stupid
[1801.12 - 1805.76] what i love about the mm-900 hds
[1804.55 - 1807.36] [Music]
[1805.76 - 1809.44] you don't see metal gears rubbing
[1807.36 - 1811.12] against each other
[1809.44 - 1812.88] you don't see metal gears running
[1811.12 - 1814.64] rubbing against each other
[1812.88 - 1816.88] like someone tried to throw that at me
[1814.64 - 1819.04] oh yeah this juicer company over here is
[1816.88 - 1821.28] the best they even talk about how
[1819.04 - 1823.52] they're better than the omega oh really
[1821.28 - 1826.16] because i see metal gears in there so
[1823.52 - 1828.48] unless i want a juice filled with tiny
[1826.16 - 1831.52] bits of metal nobody sees
[1828.48 - 1831.52] unless i want that
[1831.60 - 1836.04] i think i took too much celery force
[1837.12 - 1843.12] natalie question is it okay to juice the
[1840.32 - 1845.36] celery leaves yeah it's okay
[1843.12 - 1849.04] it's okay they don't come with a lot
[1845.36 - 1852.40] normally but if you get some wild celery
[1849.04 - 1853.92] like the wild crazy stuff like you know
[1852.40 - 1856.24] a friend of mine grew a bunch of celery
[1853.92 - 1858.48] and and i went to check it out and and
[1856.24 - 1861.44] it was just only leaves right it was
[1858.48 - 1863.28] only leaves i was like dude
[1861.44 - 1864.80] you need to be careful on how much you
[1863.28 - 1868.48] juice of that right off the running
[1864.80 - 1870.96] that's bitter it's it's astringent
[1868.48 - 1872.00] it's going to knock your socks off just
[1870.96 - 1873.68] just do
[1872.00 - 1875.92] some of that
[1873.68 - 1878.24] you know at a time because that's
[1875.92 - 1880.24] nothing but leaves it was only leaves
[1878.24 - 1882.08] there wasn't even any stalks it was just
[1880.24 - 1883.76] a whole bush of leaves
[1882.08 - 1886.00] and he's like cutting the leaves and i'm
[1883.76 - 1888.64] like oh dude you gotta like you gotta
[1886.00 - 1890.00] chill on that
[1888.64 - 1891.44] but yeah of course you do leaves when
[1890.00 - 1895.04] you're doing stalks and you do some
[1891.44 - 1895.04] leaves with it yeah of course you can
[1895.28 - 1899.68] is there a special juice
[1898.00 - 1902.88] it's look it's it's
[1899.68 - 1904.96] the thing is with celery juice is
[1902.88 - 1907.44] keep in mind that
[1904.96 - 1909.84] it works it work its ability to work is
[1907.44 - 1912.48] in it's in the fact that it's in single
[1909.84 - 1914.40] herbal extraction
[1912.48 - 1915.20] you know what you guys hear me out on
[1914.40 - 1917.36] this
[1915.20 - 1919.84] just check this out okay
[1917.36 - 1920.80] check this out
[1919.84 - 1922.88] nature
[1920.80 - 1924.72] proof you can tell me i'm wrong tell me
[1922.88 - 1926.16] i'm wrong it's all right you guys can
[1924.72 - 1927.36] tell me i'm wrong just throw it at me
[1926.16 - 1929.76] you can give me the comments to say
[1927.36 - 1931.36] you're wrong aw you're wrong and it's
[1929.76 - 1933.12] okay if you tell me that
[1931.36 - 1934.96] human nature
[1933.12 - 1937.52] doesn't like it simple
[1934.96 - 1940.16] we think we like things simple right
[1937.52 - 1942.88] but we really don't like we need to
[1940.16 - 1944.32] think that a pharmaceutical is a
[1942.88 - 1945.20] scientific
[1944.32 - 1948.88] you know
[1945.20 - 1950.48] invention of all these things in there
[1948.88 - 1952.88] we need to think that this herbal
[1950.48 - 1955.36] formula has 20 herbs in it that was
[1952.88 - 1957.68] synergistically proprietary put together
[1955.36 - 1960.40] for some we we think that
[1957.68 - 1962.48] it's always got to be complicated
[1960.40 - 1964.88] to heal
[1962.48 - 1966.88] complicated
[1964.88 - 1969.20] right that's human nature no it's got to
[1966.88 - 1971.44] become it can't be just celery juice
[1969.20 - 1973.52] that's too ridiculous it's too simple it
[1971.44 - 1977.60] can't be celery juice
[1973.52 - 1979.44] it's got to be complicated right right
[1977.60 - 1981.84] because everybody everybody it's got to
[1979.44 - 1982.88] be complicated always has to be no it's
[1981.84 - 1985.36] got to be
[1982.88 - 1987.44] scientifically tested and proven and 20
[1985.36 - 1990.56] million things in there and and then
[1987.44 - 1994.32] maybe oh that must be some mysterious
[1990.56 - 1996.72] that must be the way the synergistic way
[1994.32 - 1999.52] that was systematically all these things
[1996.72 - 2001.68] put in there that works not just one
[1999.52 - 2004.80] thing
[2001.68 - 2006.80] and that's a grave mistake we make
[2004.80 - 2010.16] simplicity is in
[2006.80 - 2013.04] the power is in the simplicity the power
[2010.16 - 2015.36] is in the simplicity
[2013.04 - 2015.36] yep
[2015.52 - 2019.92] jefferson says with plastic gears then
[2017.60 - 2021.68] you get plastic in your juice
[2019.92 - 2024.00] okay let's talk about that a little bit
[2021.68 - 2024.00] right
[2024.64 - 2028.48] plastic
[2025.76 - 2030.56] is in every single thing you touch it
[2028.48 - 2032.16] every day you touch your credit card you
[2030.56 - 2033.60] just rub plastic and that's a bad
[2032.16 - 2035.44] plastic on that
[2033.60 - 2037.76] any kind of saran wrap any kind of
[2035.44 - 2039.76] whatever whatever you know plastic wraps
[2037.76 - 2042.16] any kind of plastics plastic this
[2039.76 - 2043.20] plastic cups plastic everything right
[2042.16 - 2045.76] plastic
[2043.20 - 2047.84] okay there's plastic in petrofuel
[2045.76 - 2049.44] there's plastic and gasoline you breathe
[2047.84 - 2051.28] in plastic every day when you take a
[2049.44 - 2053.04] walk on the street and a car goes by
[2051.28 - 2054.40] there's plastic in everything and
[2053.04 - 2057.60] anything
[2054.40 - 2058.96] and plastic isn't the scary toxin
[2057.60 - 2062.00] you know what is you know what the scary
[2058.96 - 2065.20] attack toxin is it's metal
[2062.00 - 2068.08] run from it for your life with your life
[2065.20 - 2071.36] you don't want metal
[2068.08 - 2073.84] metal does a whole bunch of bad stuff
[2071.36 - 2077.52] okay and this isn't cheap plastic this
[2073.84 - 2081.28] is bpa free plastic in here
[2077.52 - 2082.88] but the point is is that even if a bpa
[2081.28 - 2084.00] free plastic
[2082.88 - 2086.80] right
[2084.00 - 2090.48] even if some residue of plastic somehow
[2086.80 - 2092.48] got into your body it comes out easy
[2090.48 - 2094.08] because this not only takes out plastic
[2092.48 - 2096.08] outside of your body but it takes out
[2094.08 - 2097.92] plastic from every other thing inside
[2096.08 - 2099.76] your body all plastic that's been in
[2097.92 - 2102.00] your body this removes it this removes
[2099.76 - 2104.48] celery just removes plastic you can't
[2102.00 - 2106.24] get enough plastic in fast enough while
[2104.48 - 2107.92] celery juice is pulling it out that's a
[2106.24 - 2110.96] whole other thing too about why it's so
[2107.92 - 2112.48] powerful and with detoxifying people
[2110.96 - 2115.04] but metal
[2112.48 - 2116.80] metals a
[2115.04 - 2119.52] you want to play with metal gears
[2116.80 - 2122.16] rubbing against each other uh-huh
[2119.52 - 2125.12] you want more adhd you want more brain
[2122.16 - 2127.28] fog you want more anxiety
[2125.12 - 2129.12] keep on playing with metal
[2127.28 - 2132.00] that's half of why everybody's sick is
[2129.12 - 2136.40] because of metal copper aluminum mercury
[2132.00 - 2136.40] cadmium lead nickel steel
[2136.48 - 2138.96] steel
[2139.84 - 2144.76] anyway guys just just a reminder like i
[2141.60 - 2146.88] said this is 20 off
[2144.76 - 2148.96] omegajuicers.com is the sale it's only
[2146.88 - 2150.24] on this juicer it's only running for a
[2148.96 - 2151.52] couple of days
[2150.24 - 2153.28] just letting you know
[2151.52 - 2155.12] saves you a lot of money and it saves
[2153.28 - 2157.68] you a lot of money when you're juicing
[2155.12 - 2161.60] because it's literally doing the dry
[2157.68 - 2164.24] pulp the dry pulp okay there's no juice
[2161.60 - 2166.32] down in here the pulp all the pulp
[2164.24 - 2168.56] little drops come right off there's
[2166.32 - 2171.04] nothing moist in here
[2168.56 - 2172.64] it's not moist it's dry
[2171.04 - 2175.12] i've never seen that with any other
[2172.64 - 2175.12] juicer
[2175.20 - 2178.56] so that's really cool
[2177.44 - 2181.04] so
[2178.56 - 2183.60] i just want to say one thing back to one
[2181.04 - 2185.36] little topic right i support the animal
[2183.60 - 2186.32] protein crowd is support the plant-based
[2185.36 - 2188.56] crowd
[2186.32 - 2189.92] both crowds right both crowds know they
[2188.56 - 2192.00] get sick
[2189.92 - 2194.00] both crowds do things wrong
[2192.00 - 2196.16] both crowds are misled non-stop out
[2194.00 - 2196.16] there
[2196.64 - 2201.68] and
[2198.56 - 2203.84] i'm not here to judge someone
[2201.68 - 2206.32] because they're eating a piece of meat
[2203.84 - 2207.76] and i'm not here to judge someone
[2206.32 - 2209.84] because they think they're the smartest
[2207.76 - 2212.84] plant-based person there is because they
[2209.84 - 2214.64] watched all the plant-based
[2212.84 - 2216.80] documentaries they talk to some
[2214.64 - 2218.64] plant-based doctors
[2216.80 - 2220.24] they think they got it all down and
[2218.64 - 2222.24] they're indestructible
[2220.24 - 2223.68] and i'm not judging them either
[2222.24 - 2225.60] and then they think they're smart as
[2223.68 - 2227.36] anything
[2225.60 - 2229.04] and i'm not judging the keto person who
[2227.36 - 2230.48] thinks they got it all down and they all
[2229.04 - 2232.64] know what's going on and they think
[2230.48 - 2235.28] they're smart and all the keto doctors
[2232.64 - 2235.28] talking that
[2235.44 - 2239.28] you know which brings me to and i'm not
[2237.52 - 2241.20] judging anybody
[2239.28 - 2242.80] but everybody gets sick
[2241.20 - 2244.32] i've seen it over and over again you can
[2242.80 - 2245.84] act like you got it down i think you got
[2244.32 - 2247.84] it down and then you get sick and you go
[2245.84 - 2249.52] down
[2247.84 - 2252.00] and then you find out
[2249.52 - 2254.00] that that keto or that paleo diet or
[2252.00 - 2256.72] that plant-based diet something was
[2254.00 - 2258.16] wrong you don't know what it is
[2256.72 - 2259.52] hell you don't even know why you're sick
[2258.16 - 2260.24] you don't even know you got pathogens
[2259.52 - 2262.16] and
[2260.24 - 2263.76] viruses and bacteria and you don't know
[2262.16 - 2265.84] you've got metals you don't go no you
[2263.76 - 2267.12] don't know nothing
[2265.84 - 2268.64] because the plant-based crowd doesn't
[2267.12 - 2269.92] know why anybody's sick and the animal
[2268.64 - 2271.92] protein crowd doesn't know why anybody's
[2269.92 - 2274.00] sick everybody's in the dentist chairs
[2271.92 - 2275.68] all the same getting their teeth drilled
[2274.00 - 2277.20] they're all doing apple cider vinegar
[2275.68 - 2279.12] the plant-based crowds do an apple cider
[2277.20 - 2281.44] vinegar the animal protein crowds do an
[2279.12 - 2283.76] apple cider vinegar get this the
[2281.44 - 2286.64] plant-based crowd they're doing caffeine
[2283.76 - 2290.24] the animal-based crowds doing caffeine
[2286.64 - 2290.24] the plant-based crowd are doing fat
[2290.40 - 2294.88] fat robot
[2291.92 - 2297.36] right that robot give me fat give me fat
[2294.88 - 2299.36] fat fat fat fat that's good for you
[2297.36 - 2301.44] healthy fat central fatty acids where's
[2299.36 - 2303.44] my fat that's good for the brain brain
[2301.44 - 2306.00] is made of fat give me fat give me fat
[2303.44 - 2307.68] fat fat that myself to death that robot
[2306.00 - 2310.96] that robot got myself to death that
[2307.68 - 2312.80] myself to death that robot
[2310.96 - 2314.80] fat robot
[2312.80 - 2317.92] there's a protein robot
[2314.80 - 2317.92] is the protein robot
[2318.48 - 2321.52] there's a fat robot
[2324.00 - 2327.20] and there's the chocolate robot too
[2326.32 - 2329.20] anyway
[2327.20 - 2330.32] which is fat
[2329.20 - 2332.40] look
[2330.32 - 2334.64] it's viruses bacteria toxic heavy metals
[2332.40 - 2337.20] toxins the high fat diet
[2334.64 - 2339.36] these are the things
[2337.20 - 2340.64] that are taking out
[2339.36 - 2342.72] the animal protein people in the
[2340.64 - 2345.28] plant-based people but they're both
[2342.72 - 2347.12] doing the bad stuff guess what
[2345.28 - 2348.48] guess what
[2347.12 - 2350.00] the animal protein people are doing
[2348.48 - 2351.60] nutritional yeast every day and the
[2350.00 - 2353.76] plant-based people are doing nutritional
[2351.60 - 2355.36] yeast every day the animal protein
[2353.76 - 2357.84] people are taking the nuts in the seeds
[2355.36 - 2359.68] and the oils and the avocado and the ana
[2357.84 - 2361.44] and the plant prostate protein people
[2359.68 - 2363.20] are taking the nut seeds avocado in the
[2361.44 - 2364.56] oils
[2363.20 - 2365.52] they're both fattening themselves to
[2364.56 - 2367.76] death
[2365.52 - 2369.44] vinegaring themselves to death
[2367.76 - 2370.96] they're both kombucha teeing themselves
[2369.44 - 2372.80] to death
[2370.96 - 2374.40] that's right fermented foods they're
[2372.80 - 2376.64] both they're both they're just they're
[2374.40 - 2381.44] just pickling themselves and they're
[2376.64 - 2384.48] both over salting themselves to death
[2381.44 - 2386.64] our body needs a certain amount of salt
[2384.48 - 2388.72] when it's in the right form
[2386.64 - 2390.24] when it's in the right form
[2388.72 - 2392.48] the animal protein and plant-based
[2390.24 - 2394.72] people just throw salt in everything
[2392.48 - 2396.40] salt salt salt here salt here let me
[2394.72 - 2398.64] drink salt salt they salt themselves to
[2396.40 - 2398.64] death

[2617.20 - 2622.08] okay i gotta
[2618.84 - 2625.68] go that happened a billion times on this
[2622.08 - 2628.72] planet the bogus food sensitivity tests
[2625.68 - 2631.04] i always tell people
[2628.72 - 2633.12] if you're eating a celery stick and your
[2631.04 - 2635.12] throat closes up don't eat it if you're
[2633.12 - 2636.48] eating a
[2635.12 - 2638.48] piece of lettuce and your throat's
[2636.48 - 2640.88] closing up don't eat it
[2638.48 - 2642.00] if you're eating an apple and your mouth
[2640.88 - 2644.32] goes numb
[2642.00 - 2646.16] because then don't eat it tests are
[2644.32 - 2647.52] faulty because they don't even know why
[2646.16 - 2649.28] anybody's sick
[2647.52 - 2651.52] so let's do food let's do food
[2649.28 - 2652.64] sensitivity tests food sensitivity tests
[2651.52 - 2655.04] they don't even know why anybody has
[2652.64 - 2657.44] fibro hashimoto's
[2655.04 - 2660.08] can i just ask you guys something
[2657.44 - 2661.60] does it make sense to you
[2660.08 - 2663.28] when all these years nobody knows why
[2661.60 - 2665.68] anybody's sick with chronic illness they
[2663.28 - 2668.80] just call it autoimmune now
[2665.68 - 2670.24] and but yet they have all the answers
[2668.80 - 2671.92] because i'm confused i'm scratching my
[2670.24 - 2673.28] head a little bit on that one
[2671.92 - 2676.92] they have all the answers but they don't
[2673.28 - 2676.92] know why anybody's sick
[2676.96 - 2680.48] yeah
[2678.72 - 2683.12] see
[2680.48 - 2684.64] tests are faulty
[2683.12 - 2688.32] yeah
[2684.64 - 2690.56] see innard uh brutal says i have heard
[2688.32 - 2692.48] that you can develop an intolerance to
[2690.56 - 2696.24] something you consume a lot
[2692.48 - 2699.60] of over time surely not celery juice
[2696.24 - 2702.24] i know a lot of alcoholics
[2699.60 - 2705.44] they could just drink and drink and
[2702.24 - 2708.24] drink and drink
[2705.44 - 2710.16] and then they don't stop drinking
[2708.24 - 2712.08] well i don't know they don't build any
[2710.16 - 2714.24] kind of problems to it they'll drink
[2712.08 - 2716.08] until they die down the road they'll
[2714.24 - 2717.44] drink and they'll drink and they'll
[2716.08 - 2719.92] drink and they'll drink i'm gonna get a
[2717.44 - 2723.36] glass of wine you guys don't mind
[2719.92 - 2723.36] i would love to just drink
[2723.68 - 2727.04] i don't know they're building an
[2724.72 - 2731.08] intolerance to it getting myself some
[2727.04 - 2731.08] some white wine right now
[2732.56 - 2734.80] so
[2736.32 - 2739.52] i'm gonna have a glass of white white
[2738.40 - 2742.24] wine
[2739.52 - 2743.68] right when we get done with this live
[2742.24 - 2745.28] i'm gonna have
[2743.68 - 2747.36] white wine
[2745.28 - 2748.88] five seconds after i finished my celery
[2747.36 - 2752.24] juice
[2748.88 - 2753.52] that's a terrible idea by the way
[2752.24 - 2756.40] what happens is what people don't
[2753.52 - 2759.52] realize is that
[2756.40 - 2762.24] you can eat a healing food
[2759.52 - 2764.16] for a long time
[2762.24 - 2767.12] long time
[2764.16 - 2768.24] there's no intolerance you get from it
[2767.12 - 2770.56] right
[2768.24 - 2774.16] i i don't know i've been drinking celery
[2770.56 - 2775.68] juice since i was a kid every single day
[2774.16 - 2777.28] i don't know what intolerance you're
[2775.68 - 2778.88] talking about
[2777.28 - 2780.32] but i do know this
[2778.88 - 2781.28] okay
[2780.32 - 2784.00] that
[2781.28 - 2786.48] if someone has
[2784.00 - 2788.40] some type of reaction and they think
[2786.48 - 2790.48] it's because
[2788.40 - 2792.40] of a food healing food they're using
[2790.48 - 2796.00] that healing food could be cleaning out
[2792.40 - 2797.28] yeast mold unproductive fungus viruses
[2796.00 - 2799.84] bacteria
[2797.28 - 2802.56] byproduct metals
[2799.84 - 2805.52] the cleansing process gets mistaken
[2802.56 - 2810.16] sometimes is intolerance
[2805.52 - 2810.16] but you know and and that gets mistaken
[2810.32 - 2814.00] when someone eats eggs they feed all
[2812.48 - 2816.88] their bugs
[2814.00 - 2818.80] they're gonna feel okay
[2816.88 - 2821.12] they're gonna feel okay you know i ate
[2818.80 - 2823.28] some eggs i feel good i made myself a
[2821.12 - 2824.72] nice egg dish
[2823.28 - 2826.32] a friend of mine tells me that they see
[2824.72 - 2828.32] it on youtube all the time all the
[2826.32 - 2829.60] youtube influencers are like making
[2828.32 - 2831.76] their food
[2829.60 - 2834.32] they toss their little salad of greens
[2831.76 - 2836.80] with oil and vinegar with olive oil they
[2834.32 - 2838.40] get their little soft-boiled eggs
[2836.80 - 2840.24] and they put their soft-boiled eggs on
[2838.40 - 2842.32] their salad
[2840.24 - 2843.20] right goes down easy
[2842.32 - 2845.68] but
[2843.20 - 2847.44] the minute you get buggy and get buggier
[2845.68 - 2849.20] those eggs will feed the bugs and feed
[2847.44 - 2851.36] them and feed them and feed them to the
[2849.20 - 2852.72] point where whether to the point where
[2851.36 - 2855.60] every time you eat an egg you'll feel
[2852.72 - 2857.36] fine or eventually you'll just get so
[2855.60 - 2859.84] sick but not know the egg is feeding the
[2857.36 - 2859.84] bugs
[2860.96 - 2864.96] lorraine says i'm getting really
[2862.16 - 2867.04] intolerant to bs but that's about it
[2864.96 - 2869.28] mary fox says to think i limit it
[2867.04 - 2871.36] limited my fruit potatoes and all but
[2869.28 - 2873.52] green veggies for years
[2871.36 - 2876.00] plus
