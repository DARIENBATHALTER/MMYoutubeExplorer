[0.08 - 4.48] about supplemental protocols medical
[2.16 - 6.64] medium supplement protocols
[4.48 - 8.80] this is an important live right here for
[6.64 - 11.28] a lot of reasons because people
[8.80 - 13.04] often get confused when it comes down to
[11.28 - 14.88] supplementation when it comes down to
[13.04 - 17.84] medical medium protocols
[14.88 - 19.84] because there's so much information with
[17.84 - 22.08] medical medium there's so much
[19.84 - 23.84] leading information in the health world
[22.08 - 26.40] that it's it is true
[23.84 - 27.44] it's hard to keep track of it because
[26.40 - 29.92] it's geared
[27.44 - 30.72] so someone can go as far as they want to
[29.92 - 32.96] heal
[30.72 - 33.76] someone who's actually critically sick
[32.96 - 36.40] or someone
[33.76 - 38.00] who's not so sick who wants to improve
[36.40 - 39.04] and heal and you know and get better
[38.00 - 42.40] really quick right
[39.04 - 46.48] so it's not just one
[42.40 - 48.40] size fits all like all the other stuff
[46.48 - 50.24] out there in the health field that's all
[48.40 - 53.04] you know the stuff is just like oh take
[50.24 - 56.00] some probiotics that will fix everything
[53.04 - 58.16] it's like no it won't take some take
[56.00 - 60.72] some of this that will fix everything
[58.16 - 61.68] and you know and medical media protocol
[60.72 - 65.64] is is
[61.68 - 69.36] protocols are thousands of protocols
[65.64 - 71.44] customizing it to yourself so you can
[69.36 - 72.64] make it to the finish line
[71.44 - 74.16] and there's something really special
[72.64 - 76.16] about that you might be somebody that's
[74.16 - 77.84] just hey you're doing celery juice
[76.16 - 80.48] 16 ounces on an empty stomach every
[77.84 - 83.04] single day you're building up your hcl
[80.48 - 83.76] you're cleaning up your liver you're
[83.04 - 85.28] getting some
[83.76 - 88.08] the critical electrolyte sodium
[85.28 - 90.32] cholesterol mineral salts to your brain
[88.08 - 91.20] right and then you might be somebody
[90.32 - 93.04] that's
[91.20 - 94.64] doing a whole bunch of different
[93.04 - 96.64] supplementation dosages
[94.64 - 98.00] knowing how to do supplement dosages
[96.64 - 99.36] you're doing your celery juice you're
[98.00 - 100.72] doing cleanses you might be somebody
[99.36 - 104.16] who's doing the mono cleanse
[100.72 - 106.64] or the 369 but
[104.16 - 108.80] take comfort in something that there's
[106.64 - 111.20] something in there for you
[108.80 - 113.44] and where you are with your health and
[111.20 - 116.56] what's happening with your health
[113.44 - 117.44] and if and there's different levels of
[116.56 - 119.04] conditions
[117.44 - 121.04] here's one thing that confuses people a
[119.04 - 123.84] lot you guys okay
[121.04 - 125.36] somebody with bloating may just have a
[123.84 - 128.24] little bit of bloating
[125.36 - 129.76] maybe some mild acne and they do medical
[128.24 - 131.92] medium protocol
[129.76 - 134.16] and they get better and then they tell
[131.92 - 136.32] somebody else what bloating
[134.16 - 138.40] that all you needed is to do is just
[136.32 - 140.88] this and then someone else
[138.40 - 142.08] tries a little bit of that and they
[140.88 - 144.96] don't get rid of their bloating
[142.08 - 145.76] because they were more severe they were
[144.96 - 148.40] more severe
[145.76 - 150.08] so that someone else has to actually get
[148.40 - 152.88] into the book
[150.08 - 155.20] and learn how to use it in the protocol
[152.88 - 157.36] so they can get their severe bloating
[155.20 - 158.56] problem fixed we're going to talk about
[157.36 - 159.76] bloating we're going to talk about
[158.56 - 161.28] autoimmune we're going to talk about
[159.76 - 161.76] neurological symptoms we're going to

[164.24 - 167.28] we're going to do that right here and
[165.60 - 169.12] we're going to talk about protocols how
[167.28 - 170.40] to take them including supplementation
[169.12 - 172.40] i'm glad you guys are coming on we're
[170.40 - 175.44] live on facebook live on youtube

[177.44 - 181.84] this is an important lie for anyone
[179.12 - 184.88] that's seeking a way
[181.84 - 186.88] out seeking a way out
[184.88 - 188.80] there's the not so sick and then there's
[186.88 - 191.60] the sick right
[188.80 - 192.16] and they're not so sick they can afford
[191.60 - 195.28] to play

[206.40 - 210.32] while

[601.76 - 606.80] sick liver infections as well
[607.68 - 614.96] good to see you guys so here we are

[616.16 - 622.00] couple things i'm gonna actually

[624.96 - 630.80] open a melon
[627.36 - 632.48] and some other things too so one thing i
[630.80 - 634.56] love about cleansed heel and one thing i
[632.48 - 638.96] love about medical medium information
[634.56 - 638.96] is cold and flu information
[639.20 - 646.00] and pandemic too so plague
[643.28 - 646.64] because basically that's that's the flu
[646.00 - 650.88] it's just
[646.64 - 652.96] a different kind of engineered flu so
[650.88 - 654.56] medical medium books or are for a lot of
[652.96 - 656.40] that too and i'll go into the cold and
[654.56 - 658.72] flu section which is important
[656.40 - 661.60] so that's a great place place to go so
[658.72 - 665.44] let's start
[661.60 - 665.44] where to start when it comes down to
[666.72 - 670.24] i'm going to find the page right now
[671.52 - 675.04] julie says where does a sick child liver
[673.52 - 677.68] come from is it genetic
[675.04 - 679.68] no it's not genetic toxic heavy metals
[677.68 - 682.16] are passed
[679.68 - 684.08] in utero so that's one reason right
[682.16 - 685.04] there low-grade viruses are passed in
[684.08 - 687.44] utero
[685.04 - 689.36] that's another reason right there and
[687.44 - 692.72] then also a child can
[689.36 - 694.64] get and pick up and contract strep also
[692.72 - 696.40] get strep from the parents strap from
[694.64 - 699.04] other sources
[696.40 - 700.16] that's it that's a easy prime example of
[699.04 - 701.92] how it's done
[700.16 - 703.20] and other ways too those are just that's
[701.92 - 707.28] just a couple of things
[703.20 - 709.28] not to mention toxins lots of toxins
[707.28 - 711.36] children get lots of toxins for lots of
[709.28 - 713.52] reasons
[711.36 - 715.52] so if you're dealing with more than one
[713.52 - 718.08] symptom or condition at the same time

[768.72 - 775.60] prostate i'll check the book and see if
[772.72 - 779.92] we have anything in here
[775.60 - 782.96] so you never know
[779.92 - 782.96] it might be in here
[783.76 - 788.00] might be under here it is reproductive

[805.76 - 809.44] thing in the moment
[807.04 - 810.72] that's all right and you focus on the
[809.44 - 814.72] fatigue
[810.72 - 815.76] chances are right over time you may find
[814.72 - 818.16] that working on one
[815.76 - 820.00] issue like the fatigue takes care of
[818.16 - 822.00] another
[820.00 - 823.76] takes care of another or you can switch
[822.00 - 826.32] off after a while and focus
[823.76 - 828.80] on a different supplement list for
[826.32 - 830.40] another issue
[828.80 - 832.40] once you've found your symptom or

[945.84 - 950.40] inclined to heal i got anxiety
[947.76 - 952.24] i got anxiousness let me read the true
[950.40 - 954.40] cause
[952.24 - 956.48] when anxiety interferes with your life
[954.40 - 959.12] it's caused by toxic heavy metals such
[956.48 - 962.56] as mercury aluminum and copper
[959.12 - 963.52] whoa whoa so that's what my crippling
[962.56 - 965.84] anxiety
[963.52 - 967.60] already i got an answer coming on
[965.84 - 969.04] because i've been to five psychiatrists
[967.60 - 971.68] i've been to ten doctors
[969.04 - 973.76] i've been to all kinds of people and my
[971.68 - 975.60] anxiety actually is toxic heavy metals i
[973.76 - 977.84] just discovered what my anxiety is right
[975.60 - 977.84] here
[978.80 - 983.60] you don't have to do everything okay the
[981.28 - 986.56] book is set up so someone really sick
[983.60 - 988.24] can go all the way or take their time
[986.56 - 989.76] and just knock things down a little bit
[988.24 - 991.52] at a time
[989.76 - 993.84] climb up that staircase to getting
[991.52 - 993.84] better
[994.64 - 999.36] so we're in the supplement section right
[997.04 - 1001.60] i'm in anxiety and anxiousness
[999.36 - 1002.96] so i'm i'm i'm struggling with that
[1001.60 - 1005.68] anxiety and anxiousness
[1002.96 - 1007.04] and i'm like been everywhere been there
[1005.68 - 1008.48] done that
[1007.04 - 1010.48] i've tried everything i've tried breath
[1008.48 - 1012.40] work i've tried all kinds of things out
[1010.48 - 1013.76] there i tried meditation with my anxiety
[1012.40 - 1017.20] it just doesn't work
[1013.76 - 1020.16] i'm on benzodiazepines
[1017.20 - 1022.32] i mean i'm i'm sucking it out my anxiety
[1020.16 - 1024.32] is really really bad
[1022.32 - 1025.84] so i got the medical medium book i
[1024.32 - 1030.48] decided to finally do it
[1025.84 - 1032.88] i heard about it for years right
[1030.48 - 1034.40] so i'm doing it and i'm seeing here when
[1032.88 - 1036.88] anxiety interferes in your life yeah it
[1034.40 - 1039.92] interferes with my life it's killing me
[1036.88 - 1041.68] it's interfering with my life it's
[1039.92 - 1043.68] caused by toxic heavy metals such as
[1041.68 - 1046.24] mercury aluminum and copper
[1043.68 - 1047.68] viruses such as one of the over 60
[1046.24 - 1050.96] various epstein-barr you know i remember
[1047.68 - 1053.84] having mono when i was younger
[1050.96 - 1056.72] is that epstein-barr because i remember
[1053.84 - 1058.56] having mono when i was younger
[1056.72 - 1061.04] it could even be over one of the old the
[1058.56 - 1063.20] one of the over 30 varieties of shingles
[1061.04 - 1064.48] that's funny i had a strange rash about
[1063.20 - 1067.84] seven years ago i didn't know what it
[1064.48 - 1067.84] was a doctor wasn't sure what it was
[1068.80 - 1072.16] or a combination of both toxic heavy
[1070.56 - 1074.88] metals and viruses so i can have
[1072.16 - 1076.72] metal causing my anxiety and maybe even
[1074.88 - 1080.72] viral issues
[1076.72 - 1082.80] whoa most of the time it's both at once
[1080.72 - 1084.08] with one cause more dominant depending
[1082.80 - 1086.08] on individual case
[1084.08 - 1088.80] that means i might have more toxic heavy
[1086.08 - 1091.12] metals than i do viruses
[1088.80 - 1092.48] check that out so here i am i already
[1091.12 - 1096.08] been to 10 doctors
[1092.48 - 1097.68] i got crippling anxiety i'm on benzos
[1096.08 - 1099.12] and i'm actually learning right now for
[1097.68 - 1100.64] the first time i'm getting an answer of
[1099.12 - 1103.60] why i have crippling anxiety that's
[1100.64 - 1103.60] interfering with my life
[1103.68 - 1109.68] fancy that fancy that
[1106.72 - 1112.16] seaweed hero fancy that might be a song
[1109.68 - 1114.80] with that in there
[1112.16 - 1116.88] anxiety okay so here's it most of the
[1114.80 - 1120.96] times both at once right
[1116.88 - 1123.12] with one dominating anxiety can also be
[1120.96 - 1124.40] triggered accelerated or heightened by
[1123.12 - 1127.76] emotional conflict
[1124.40 - 1130.32] emotional conflict can heighten anxiety
[1127.76 - 1132.32] okay we know that your anxiety might
[1130.32 - 1135.44] crank up if you're triggered
[1132.32 - 1138.24] emotionally ready although
[1135.44 - 1139.84] toxic heavy metals and or virus must be
[1138.24 - 1143.12] present for the anxiety to become
[1139.84 - 1143.12] sustained and chronic
[1143.36 - 1146.88] for the anxiety to be sustained and
[1145.84 - 1149.28] chronic
[1146.88 - 1150.64] it means it's these other physical
[1149.28 - 1152.00] things
[1150.64 - 1154.16] you know what's amazing about medical
[1152.00 - 1156.16] mean information and i'm not saying this
[1154.16 - 1160.40] because on the medical medium that's not
[1156.16 - 1162.72] it because i'm just as astonished
[1160.40 - 1164.40] as a lot of people are when they find
[1162.72 - 1167.92] the true cause because
[1164.40 - 1169.68] i'm a human being that hears the voice
[1167.92 - 1170.24] the spirit of compassion since i was age
[1169.68 - 1171.84] four
[1170.24 - 1173.76] giving me the answers that nobody in
[1171.84 - 1175.12] medicine could provide and nobody an
[1173.76 - 1176.96] alternative alternative medicine can
[1175.12 - 1179.36] provide ever
[1176.96 - 1181.20] so i get blown away too and i don't take
[1179.36 - 1182.64] it for granted i still wake up every
[1181.20 - 1186.48] morning saying
[1182.64 - 1186.48] it's incredible that you have the answer
[1186.80 - 1191.04] it's incredible when it's not out there
[1191.68 - 1196.24] let's go let's talk about anxiousness
[1193.20 - 1198.64] you guys anxiousness that comes and goes
[1196.24 - 1199.28] in a milder form can have the same toxic
[1198.64 - 1201.84] metal or
[1199.28 - 1204.00] viral causes or can result from mild
[1201.84 - 1207.20] emotional injury or prolonged stress
[1204.00 - 1209.44] on its own so i'm in anxiety for the
[1207.20 - 1210.96] moment and that's a neurological symptom
[1209.44 - 1213.28] and i want it to cover neurological
[1210.96 - 1216.64] symptoms and we're going to go into
[1213.28 - 1218.48] autoimmune as well in a little bit so
[1216.64 - 1220.16] now i'm in the supplementation section
[1218.48 - 1223.28] it says supplements for
[1220.16 - 1226.56] anxiety fresh celery juice

[1239.44 - 1245.04] do the celery juice and never read the
[1243.20 - 1249.20] book
[1245.04 - 1252.48] try it for a week and say it didn't work
[1249.20 - 1252.48] and you tried medical medium
[1252.64 - 1256.72] because you didn't you can go as far as
[1255.04 - 1260.00] you need to go
[1256.72 - 1260.00] just teaching you how a little bit
[1260.40 - 1265.68] please can someone help and check if
[1262.16 - 1267.36] gastroparesis is in this book yes it is

[1269.36 - 1273.44] navid check it out when you can
[1274.24 - 1280.72] so fresh celery juice we're there right
[1278.32 - 1282.64] also in here it says celery forks three
[1280.72 - 1286.32] capsules three times a day
[1282.64 - 1286.32] that's the celery force right there
[1286.96 - 1291.12] ask your doctor what's right for you
[1289.12 - 1293.76] bring this to your doctor
[1291.12 - 1297.28] say can i take the celery force there's
[1293.76 - 1297.28] no celery in celery force
[1298.08 - 1303.12] but it goes straight to the brain really
[1301.36 - 1305.92] helps for anxiety
[1303.12 - 1307.44] anxiousness i know because i've seen
[1305.92 - 1311.52] friends and family take it
[1307.44 - 1314.40] and experience it i use this every day
[1311.52 - 1315.68] because i'm on this intense intense
[1314.40 - 1317.44] schedule right now
[1315.68 - 1320.48] so i use it every day try to give me as
[1317.44 - 1324.72] much clarity as it possibly can get
[1320.48 - 1328.32] so i'm just on it next one is 5mthf
[1324.72 - 1330.24] for anxiety so 5 mthf so i got it
[1328.32 - 1333.04] somewhere in here
[1330.24 - 1335.60] there it is that's another one right
[1333.04 - 1339.52] there it says one capsule daily
[1335.60 - 1344.00] now you can do less
[1339.52 - 1347.04] you can do five mthf one every other day
[1344.00 - 1348.40] you can try different options
[1347.04 - 1350.48] here's something interesting then it
[1348.40 - 1353.04] goes into aloe vera
[1350.48 - 1353.76] two or more inches of fresh gel skin
[1353.04 - 1356.72] removed
[1353.76 - 1356.72] how do you like that
[1357.36 - 1363.12] is there anything on lupus lupus is is
[1360.16 - 1367.76] autoimmune so if you don't find it here
[1363.12 - 1372.08] directly this has lupus in it right here
[1367.76 - 1374.24] okay but lupus is under autoimmune here
[1372.08 - 1376.72] so yeah so it says autoimmune diseases
[1374.24 - 1378.88] and disorders
[1376.72 - 1381.28] that's if you don't find your label
[1378.88 - 1384.40] because there's hundreds of autoimmune
[1381.28 - 1386.00] disease titles right
[1384.40 - 1389.84] if you don't find it you go under
[1386.00 - 1389.84] autoimmune autoimmune disorders
[1390.16 - 1393.20] so here i have an aloe leaf in front of
[1392.64 - 1395.92] me

[1448.24 - 1452.48] so what does it say in the book so i'm
[1451.04 - 1455.12] in anxiety
[1452.48 - 1455.60] aloe vera two or more inches of fresh
[1455.12 - 1458.80] gel
[1455.60 - 1462.32] skin removed daily
[1458.80 - 1462.32] so that's the aloe piece right there
[1470.84 - 1474.80] right
[1472.96 - 1476.00] here's a tip i might give you right here
[1474.80 - 1479.36] which is really cool why
[1476.00 - 1479.36] would aloe even be in here
[1480.08 - 1489.52] a lot of people's nerves are jacked up
[1484.88 - 1492.88] they're jacked up bad vagus nerves
[1489.52 - 1495.20] attaching to the intestinal tract
[1492.88 - 1496.72] are heightened in sensitivity because of
[1495.20 - 1499.60] toxic heavy metals
[1496.72 - 1501.12] and virus infections people walk around
[1499.60 - 1502.48] with chronic viral infections every
[1501.12 - 1504.24] single day and don't even know it and
[1502.48 - 1505.52] they got crippling anxiety because of it
[1504.24 - 1509.04] because of neurotoxins
[1505.52 - 1509.04] created by the virus
[1511.84 - 1515.76] so people walk around little bugs in
[1513.68 - 1519.12] them is what they do
[1515.76 - 1521.60] okay and those little bugs
[1519.12 - 1523.52] pee and poo and they pee and poo
[1521.60 - 1525.20] neurotoxins those neurotoxins get
[1523.52 - 1528.32] released out of the viruses
[1525.20 - 1532.24] like epstein-barr and shingles
[1528.32 - 1532.24] those neurotoxins float around
[1534.16 - 1542.08] and aggravate vagus nerve cells
[1538.80 - 1545.36] any kind of vagus nerve issues so
[1542.08 - 1547.68] what i like about aloe
[1545.36 - 1548.56] and we just had a a piece of a two inch
[1547.68 - 1549.92] piece right
[1548.56 - 1554.64] maybe that's a little bit more than two
[1549.92 - 1554.64] inches right there it's in the anxiety
[1554.84 - 1559.20] section
[1557.28 - 1560.72] because it's soothing to the linings of
[1559.20 - 1562.40] the intestinal tract
[1560.72 - 1565.04] it's antiviral but it's soothing to the
[1562.40 - 1568.48] linings of the intestinal tract
[1565.04 - 1570.64] which can calm the nerves and calm the
[1568.48 - 1572.48] vagus nerve down ease
[1570.64 - 1573.68] gastric cramping and spasms and
[1572.48 - 1575.60] everything
[1573.68 - 1577.84] so that's why it's there in the anxiety
[1575.60 - 1577.84] part
[1578.88 - 1583.52] i remember when i was younger and spirit
[1581.68 - 1586.16] of compassion would always give me
[1583.52 - 1588.16] the remedies and the information that
[1586.16 - 1589.44] people needed i would always ask like
[1588.16 - 1593.28] why
[1589.44 - 1597.76] why why all the time
[1593.28 - 1600.00] you know why spirit why why why
[1597.76 - 1601.68] so we did the aloe right there next one
[1600.00 - 1606.32] is ashwagandha
[1601.68 - 1609.04] one dropper full twice a day
[1606.32 - 1611.44] so the ashwagandha is next and these are
[1609.04 - 1612.40] vimergy supplements right here
[1611.44 - 1615.36] just so you know i'm gonna grab an
[1612.40 - 1619.04] ashwagandha real quick so

[1659.84 - 1667.52] mary e rgy.com i'm not sponsored
[1665.20 - 1669.04] but and it's important to have stuff
[1667.52 - 1669.52] that doesn't have the alcohol it doesn't
[1669.04 - 1672.00] have
[1669.52 - 1673.76] the small percentage of of ingredients
[1672.00 - 1675.68] you don't know about that exist in there
[1673.76 - 1677.20] like msgs that are hidden in there or
[1675.68 - 1679.04] the natural flavors
[1677.20 - 1680.88] or anything like that or the citric acid
[1679.04 - 1681.76] or all the junk and garbage or the bad
[1680.88 - 1685.44] glycerin
[1681.76 - 1687.76] all of that so
[1685.44 - 1689.20] and most people will bat grab the bad
[1687.76 - 1690.56] quality stuff they'll grab the wrong
[1689.20 - 1692.40] stuff they'll be like okay
[1690.56 - 1695.36] let me go grab something else it says
[1692.40 - 1698.00] high quality but it's not
[1695.36 - 1699.92] do the best you can but that's the one i
[1698.00 - 1702.64] use friends and family that's the one
[1699.92 - 1704.00] that i trust the most ashwagandha is one
[1702.64 - 1705.20] dropper full twice a day so let's talk
[1704.00 - 1708.80] about that why
[1705.20 - 1710.16] why spirit why
[1708.80 - 1711.84] and you can check out other supplements
[1710.16 - 1713.28] on my directory medically dot com spirit
[1711.84 - 1715.52] why
[1713.28 - 1716.48] why ashwagandha for anxiety i don't get
[1715.52 - 1722.16] that like i
[1716.48 - 1722.16] i want to know okay so let's go there
[1723.76 - 1729.84] that's why when you get the low-grade
[1727.12 - 1731.04] viral infections
[1729.84 - 1732.24] this important information when you've
[1731.04 - 1735.28] got the low-grade vital infections in
[1732.24 - 1737.04] the toxic heavy metals
[1735.28 - 1738.56] and it's triggering off that vagus nerve
[1737.04 - 1740.24] and it's triggering off those those
[1738.56 - 1740.88] those cranial nerves and it's messing
[1740.24 - 1742.56] you up
[1740.88 - 1744.00] and you're getting the tightness of the
[1742.56 - 1745.36] chest and the tightness of the throat
[1744.00 - 1746.40] and you're getting all the issues that
[1745.36 - 1747.76] are involved in you know you're getting
[1746.40 - 1749.28] the heart palpitations and all this
[1747.76 - 1750.16] other stuff that's happening vegas nerve
[1749.28 - 1751.52] related
[1750.16 - 1753.52] doctor doesn't know why you're having
[1751.52 - 1757.36] this the adrenals are
[1753.52 - 1758.96] pumping pumping sometimes that anxiety
[1757.36 - 1760.64] can keep you up half the night sometimes
[1758.96 - 1762.48] it can keep you up the whole night
[1760.64 - 1767.84] some sometimes it keeps people up three
[1762.48 - 1767.84] days straight
[1769.68 - 1774.16] donna says ashwagandha unless you are
[1771.92 - 1778.64] hyperthyroid correct
[1774.16 - 1778.64] not correct it's a theory
[1778.96 - 1783.04] here's here's my problem that i have out
[1780.64 - 1784.80] there the theories when theories develop
[1783.04 - 1786.24] in natural medicine
[1784.80 - 1788.08] they're developing when they still don't
[1786.24 - 1790.00] know why someone has hyperthyroid or
[1788.08 - 1791.36] hypothyroid but do what your doctor
[1790.00 - 1792.48] tells you if your doctor tells you stay
[1791.36 - 1794.16] away from ashwagandha because the
[1792.48 - 1796.32] hypothyroid stay away from it
[1794.16 - 1797.68] to listen to your doctor but what
[1796.32 - 1800.80] happens is that
[1797.68 - 1802.32] theories that develop in natural
[1800.80 - 1803.92] medicine
[1802.32 - 1805.76] from people who don't know why someone
[1803.92 - 1807.68] has a hypothyroid hypothyroid
[1805.76 - 1809.52] hashimoto's thyroiditis cyst nodules
[1807.68 - 1811.60] tumors and their thyroid problem
[1809.52 - 1813.12] they don't know why they didn't know it
[1811.60 - 1815.44] was epstein-barr
[1813.12 - 1817.04] that information came later science
[1815.44 - 1817.68] researcher linking epstein-barr down
[1817.04 - 1819.28] because
[1817.68 - 1822.16] medical media published it many years
[1819.28 - 1824.00] ago talked about it for many years but
[1822.16 - 1826.32] the cause of hyperthyroidism and
[1824.00 - 1829.52] hypothyroidism you'll read in the books
[1826.32 - 1831.28] is epstein-barr virus which can also amp
[1829.52 - 1836.32] up anxiety for a lot of people too
[1831.28 - 1838.00] without having a thyroid problem
[1836.32 - 1839.36] moving right along our adrenals get
[1838.00 - 1842.64] jacked up that's why
[1839.36 - 1844.56] the ashwagandha so spirit why is this
[1842.64 - 1846.08] so when i'm taking down the information
[1844.56 - 1847.76] and and getting it out there for
[1846.08 - 1849.84] everybody
[1847.76 - 1852.32] i'm asking questions all the time i want
[1849.84 - 1852.32] to know
[1852.48 - 1857.04] because it helps to protect the adrenals
[1854.48 - 1858.72] when your anxiety is cranking
[1857.04 - 1860.56] rita gene says can you take a lot of the
[1858.72 - 1862.88] supplements together or do you have to
[1860.56 - 1865.28] take them at different times of the day
[1862.88 - 1867.36] i take them all together a lot of times
[1865.28 - 1869.36] you can do it different times a day
[1867.36 - 1870.72] i explain it here too in the supplement
[1869.36 - 1871.84] section of cleanse the heal you should
[1870.72 - 1874.48] really check that out when you get a
[1871.84 - 1876.84] chance because it's in this section
[1874.48 - 1878.08] so right here knowing the cause of the
[1876.84 - 1880.88] protocol
[1878.08 - 1883.28] that's the section right there so let's
[1880.88 - 1887.12] move to the next one barley grass juice
[1883.28 - 1889.84] powder barley grass juice powder

[1926.72 - 1928.96] little scoop out i just don't want to
[1928.16 - 1931.92] dump
[1928.96 - 1934.08] the center right there on the spot i
[1931.92 - 1937.44] have to have the book you guys
[1934.08 - 1937.44] want to keep it nice and clean
[1938.08 - 1941.20] so what i do with honeydew melons i

[1943.60 - 1949.84] barley grass juice powder

[1952.00 - 1955.36] absolutely
[1954.08 - 1956.80] so i'm putting a little barley grass
[1955.36 - 1958.00] juice powder right there inside the
[1956.80 - 1960.08] melon
[1958.00 - 1961.36] i like to have it that way you can also
[1960.08 - 1963.12] have it so many other different ways
[1961.36 - 1963.76] heavy metal detox movie is another way
[1963.12 - 1966.48] to
[1963.76 - 1966.48] put that right there
[1968.96 - 1974.16] so i'm just anxiety right now anxiety is
[1971.04 - 1974.16] a neurological symptom
[1974.72 - 1978.72] we're going to talk about other stuff
[1975.92 - 1978.72] too while we're here
[1978.88 - 1983.52] so moving on down the line there's a lot
[1981.36 - 1985.68] of supplements here one of the
[1983.52 - 1986.64] best ones for this problem that people
[1985.68 - 1989.52] deal with is
[1986.64 - 1990.00] lemon balm so that's one of the better
[1989.52 - 1992.96] ones right
[1990.00 - 1994.00] there is lemon balm so it says lemon
[1992.96 - 1997.84] balm
[1994.00 - 2001.76] four dropper fulls four times a day
[1997.84 - 2001.76] four dropper fulls four times a day
[2002.84 - 2007.84] right
[2005.36 - 2018.00] so let me get these four dropper fulls
[2007.84 - 2021.04] right in here
[2018.00 - 2023.68] four dropper fulls four times a day
[2021.04 - 2025.52] you don't have to do that dosage because
[2023.68 - 2027.28] if you read in here you can do
[2025.52 - 2029.76] less just like i was talking about
[2027.28 - 2031.84] before so if i go back
[2029.76 - 2032.80] you guys just got here if i go back in
[2031.84 - 2036.96] here
[2032.80 - 2040.16] right if you're sensitive you can try
[2036.96 - 2040.16] one supplement a day
[2044.48 - 2048.72] vimrji supplements have flax oil in it
[2047.36 - 2050.00] on tick tock you're saying no they don't
[2048.72 - 2052.80] have flax oil in it
[2050.00 - 2053.92] nope it's flax glycerin doesn't have
[2052.80 - 2056.96] flax oil in it
[2053.92 - 2059.60] just so you know it's advanced this flax
[2056.96 - 2061.12] glycerin instead of palm glycerin
[2059.60 - 2063.44] palm glycerin isn't the worst thing in
[2061.12 - 2065.60] the world but it's not great
[2063.44 - 2067.52] so vimergy has flax glycerin which
[2065.60 - 2069.28] supersedes that's how advanced they are
[2067.52 - 2070.80] it's incredible
[2069.28 - 2072.48] you don't have flax oil in there that
[2070.80 - 2074.16] flax glycerin though so there's no oil
[2072.48 - 2076.40] in there
[2074.16 - 2077.20] it's a good question though thanks for
[2076.40 - 2080.56] asking
[2077.20 - 2080.88] so what i love about the lemon balm is
[2080.56 - 2083.92] it
[2080.88 - 2085.44] calms the nerves down is what it does it
[2083.92 - 2086.64] calms the nerves down if you guys want
[2085.44 - 2088.48] to know what i'm doing
[2086.64 - 2090.16] i'm going through supplementation
[2088.48 - 2091.60] protocols i'm talking about you know all
[2090.16 - 2093.68] kinds of different tips and things that
[2091.60 - 2095.04] are really helpful important right there
[2093.68 - 2098.40] in cleanse the heel
[2095.04 - 2098.88] that's 51 off amazon.com us get a free
[2098.40 - 2101.52] library
[2098.88 - 2103.28] or other bookstores you can get it from
[2101.52 - 2107.28] other stores too
[2103.28 - 2107.28] so let's go into this a little bit
[2114.08 - 2118.00] what i love about lemon balm is it's a
[2116.40 - 2120.72] lifesaver for so many people
[2118.00 - 2121.44] that i've recommended it for in high
[2120.72 - 2123.28] dosages
[2121.44 - 2124.56] do your doctor tells you i'm just
[2123.28 - 2126.00] telling you what i would do for myself
[2124.56 - 2129.20] if i had anxiety or
[2126.00 - 2130.72] friends and family in high dosages like
[2129.20 - 2135.04] four dropper fulls four
[2130.72 - 2138.88] times a day it's constantly
[2135.04 - 2140.64] keeping the nerves calm so it's helping
[2138.88 - 2142.64] to feed the nerves
[2140.64 - 2144.72] phytochemical compounds in lemon balm
[2142.64 - 2147.36] relax nerves
[2144.72 - 2150.32] they don't make you drowsy it you mean
[2147.36 - 2153.04] lemon balm won't make you drowsy
[2150.32 - 2154.40] but it calms the nerves is what it does
[2153.04 - 2157.92] because phytochemical compounds
[2154.40 - 2159.60] alkaloids and lemon bombs specifically
[2157.92 - 2162.64] coat nerves
[2159.60 - 2165.04] and stop them from wigging out
[2162.64 - 2168.24] lemon balms also antibacterial antiviral
[2165.04 - 2171.52] and that's a big deal too all on its own
[2168.24 - 2173.76] so what's wigging out in our body
[2171.52 - 2174.64] cranial nerves trigeminal nerve vagus
[2173.76 - 2176.56] nerve right
[2174.64 - 2178.64] all the different nerves in our body wig
[2176.56 - 2180.08] out and
[2178.64 - 2182.72] they're attached to all the different
[2180.08 - 2185.28] organs too vagus nerve goes to some
[2182.72 - 2187.04] lung lung activity vagus nerve goes to
[2185.28 - 2189.76] the heart
[2187.04 - 2191.76] vegas there goes the intestinal tract to
[2189.76 - 2193.52] the stomach
[2191.76 - 2196.24] and then people have all this anxiety or
[2193.52 - 2199.28] symptoms that are neurological not just
[2196.24 - 2202.32] anxiety and i love the lemon bomb
[2199.28 - 2204.88] such a great great tool
[2202.32 - 2206.16] okay if you grab lemon balm with alcohol
[2204.88 - 2210.08] you're losing
[2206.16 - 2211.68] you're losing you can't just burn the
[2210.08 - 2213.52] alcohol off like people say well i'll
[2211.68 - 2214.48] just burn the alcohol off i'll just boil
[2213.52 - 2216.64] it
[2214.48 - 2218.16] then yeah you're left over with now you
[2216.64 - 2220.40] just boiled
[2218.16 - 2222.48] something that was had a potential of
[2220.40 - 2226.08] maybe helping inside the body but
[2222.48 - 2227.28] but yet you're also boiling the heck out
[2226.08 - 2229.92] of it
[2227.28 - 2231.76] dispersing it in water like there's
[2229.92 - 2233.04] there's no way out when you have alcohol
[2231.76 - 2234.16] in the supplements it makes things
[2233.04 - 2235.60] really difficult because a lot of people
[2234.16 - 2237.44] will say no wait a minute
[2235.60 - 2238.88] i got one it's got alcohol in it but i
[2237.44 - 2243.36] know the trick you you
[2238.88 - 2247.44] dump it into a pot of water and
[2243.36 - 2247.44] and burn it off i'm like oh my god
[2248.24 - 2251.28] and the alcohol already got into the
[2249.68 - 2253.76] herb itself
[2251.28 - 2255.60] so it's not about burning it off so what
[2253.76 - 2258.96] i love about the vimergy is
[2255.60 - 2262.08] there's no concern of that but yet
[2258.96 - 2265.36] it's the flax glycerin
[2262.08 - 2267.68] so it's even better than if you've
[2265.36 - 2270.00] got another alcohol-free supplement that
[2267.68 - 2271.92] had palm glycerin
[2270.00 - 2273.60] and there's a lot of other reasons too
[2271.92 - 2276.48] but that that's why it's good so
[2273.60 - 2278.80] the vagus nerve runs into the different
[2276.48 - 2281.36] organs
[2278.80 - 2282.84] and the lemon bomb is helpful i can't
[2281.36 - 2284.40] tell you how many people got off their
[2282.84 - 2288.24] benzos
[2284.40 - 2288.24] how many people got off their benzos
[2288.32 - 2292.24] for using lemon balm like lemon balm
[2290.48 - 2293.84] therapy spirit of compassion recommended
[2292.24 - 2295.52] over the last 35 years
[2293.84 - 2299.36] information is in this book take it to
[2295.52 - 2302.40] your doctor
[2299.36 - 2302.40] guys we're having fun
[2302.96 - 2306.80] i'm gonna pop a little bit of water in
[2304.56 - 2306.80] here
[2308.72 - 2317.60] i'm gonna send this down
[2312.32 - 2320.16] so good i love to taste the lemon balm
[2317.60 - 2322.16] instantly instantly puts me in a really
[2320.16 - 2324.84] good mood if i'm already in a good mood
[2322.16 - 2328.40] it just puts me in even a better mood
[2324.84 - 2332.08] so move on down the line a little bit
[2328.40 - 2333.68] curcumin that's great for anxiety too
[2332.08 - 2335.44] because curcumin is a natural like a
[2333.68 - 2337.76] natural aspirin
[2335.44 - 2338.56] so it's a natural anti-inflammatory not
[2337.76 - 2340.56] because
[2338.56 - 2342.88] it's killing off all the pathogens that
[2340.56 - 2344.80] create inflammation
[2342.88 - 2346.48] that's not why because it's
[2344.80 - 2350.72] phytochemical compounds
[2346.48 - 2352.64] and you know in turmeric and curcumin
[2350.72 - 2354.88] is all part of that it's all bundled up
[2352.64 - 2355.76] in there and those phytochemical
[2354.88 - 2358.16] compounds
[2355.76 - 2360.64] have an aspirin like effect so i like
[2358.16 - 2363.92] curcumin because
[2360.64 - 2366.40] it lowers inflammation in the body
[2363.92 - 2368.24] even if doctors and practitioners and
[2366.40 - 2369.52] people on you know doctors on youtubes
[2368.24 - 2372.08] or whatever podcasts or
[2369.52 - 2373.44] in magazines don't know why you're
[2372.08 - 2375.36] inflamed
[2373.44 - 2377.12] they don't know why you're inflamed
[2375.36 - 2379.04] curcumin is good for inflammation well
[2377.12 - 2380.56] it's true it is good for inflammation
[2379.04 - 2382.56] but i like the best one so that's in
[2380.56 - 2383.28] here too and that can calm anxiety down
[2382.56 - 2386.80] a little bit
[2383.28 - 2388.80] dr faun md
[2386.80 - 2390.64] there's lots of low quality curcumins
[2388.80 - 2392.64] out there with additives
[2390.64 - 2393.76] keep that in mind and they don't even
[2392.64 - 2395.28] tell you
[2393.76 - 2396.80] when there's even more additives in
[2395.28 - 2397.28] there that are not that are not even on
[2396.80 - 2398.96] the
[2397.28 - 2400.08] ingredient list but that are in it
[2398.96 - 2402.32] because i told you about that whole
[2400.08 - 2405.84] thing bemidji refuses to do
[2402.32 - 2407.92] they refuse to let a certain percentage
[2405.84 - 2409.36] of manufactured additives go into their
[2407.92 - 2411.52] products that all the other supplement
[2409.36 - 2413.92] companies let in
[2411.52 - 2415.84] and people say well why is he always you
[2413.92 - 2416.64] know pushing their stuff or talking
[2415.84 - 2418.32] about their stuff
[2416.64 - 2419.52] because it's the best i use it friends
[2418.32 - 2421.04] and family use it but it's more than
[2419.52 - 2424.32] that
[2421.04 - 2427.60] not just the best it's because
[2424.32 - 2429.92] they like put their foot down
[2427.60 - 2431.52] and when you're chronically ill you need
[2429.92 - 2433.20] somebody that's got your back you need
[2431.52 - 2433.60] people that got your back that put their
[2433.20 - 2437.36] foot
[2433.60 - 2439.36] down i put my foot down all the time
[2437.36 - 2440.96] because i'm just like i don't care if
[2439.36 - 2442.72] the caffeine industry is pissed at me i
[2440.96 - 2444.80] don't care if everybody's mad at me the
[2442.72 - 2448.16] apple cider vinegar people are at my
[2444.80 - 2449.52] front door with torches and and shovels
[2448.16 - 2451.44] and pitchforks
[2449.52 - 2453.12] i don't care if you know like whoever's
[2451.44 - 2453.76] knocking on my door the charcoal people
[2453.12 - 2455.60] and
[2453.76 - 2456.72] the ionizer water machine people are mad
[2455.60 - 2458.00] at me and everybody's mad at me because
[2456.72 - 2459.76] i'm trying to protect the chronically
[2458.00 - 2462.32] ill someone's got to put their foot down
[2459.76 - 2463.04] and and have the chronic legs back it's
[2462.32 - 2465.12] not just
[2463.04 - 2466.96] it's that it's not just knowing the true
[2465.12 - 2468.40] cause of why we're sick and how to heal
[2466.96 - 2471.44] and how to do protocols it's more than
[2468.40 - 2475.68] that it's about having your back too
[2471.44 - 2475.68] it's all of it it's important
[2476.32 - 2483.04] there's some i mean yeah
[2480.24 - 2486.16] magnesium glycinate that's in the
[2483.04 - 2489.84] anxiety section so what does it say
[2486.16 - 2493.68] three capsules daily magnesium
[2489.84 - 2494.32] relaxes muscles muscles get wigged out
[2493.68 - 2497.36] because
[2494.32 - 2500.88] nerves are wigged out all the nerves
[2497.36 - 2500.88] going through all our muscles
[2501.04 - 2504.88] get all wigged out because of toxins and
[2502.80 - 2505.92] toxic heavy metals and viral neurotoxins
[2504.88 - 2508.16] like i was talking about
[2505.92 - 2510.88] creating anxiety and other problems so
[2508.16 - 2513.44] then our muscles
[2510.88 - 2515.52] get pushed to their limit not because
[2513.44 - 2517.20] they're being used like a workout
[2515.52 - 2520.00] they're being pushed to the limit on a
[2517.20 - 2520.00] stress level
[2520.80 - 2526.64] so i love magnesium glycinate
[2524.72 - 2527.84] you'll see more magnesium glycinate out
[2526.64 - 2529.36] there because
[2527.84 - 2531.12] medical medium information is the most
[2529.36 - 2533.76] advanced
[2531.12 - 2535.60] and it leads the way in all of health if
[2533.76 - 2537.20] you're somebody like that's not possible
[2535.60 - 2539.12] i i don't even know why this guy's
[2537.20 - 2540.40] saying this it's true and it's all fact
[2539.12 - 2541.60] and it's true
[2540.40 - 2544.00] the books don't lie they've been
[2541.60 - 2544.80] published first it leads the way in
[2544.00 - 2546.24] information
[2544.80 - 2548.64] lectures i've done over the years leads
[2546.24 - 2550.08] the way in information and glycinate now
[2548.64 - 2552.88] magnesium glycine you'll see
[2550.08 - 2555.68] it now out there and all the supplement
[2552.88 - 2557.68] companies that made all these mistakes
[2555.68 - 2559.68] they're now putting glycinate magnesium
[2557.68 - 2562.08] glycinate and stuff it's like
[2559.68 - 2562.96] medical medium information is upgrading
[2562.08 - 2564.80] all the time
[2562.96 - 2566.56] the world of natural medicine in
[2564.80 - 2567.52] conventional medicine too and chronic
[2566.56 - 2570.32] illness
[2567.52 - 2571.12] glycinate's really important that
[2570.32 - 2572.64] magnesium
[2571.12 - 2575.36] so we got that that's of energy
[2572.64 - 2577.28] magnesium i take a bunch of that
[2575.36 - 2579.36] i take a bunch of that every single day
[2577.28 - 2582.40] that's what i do
[2579.36 - 2584.32] so vitamin c why is vitamin c important
[2582.40 - 2586.08] for anxiety like
[2584.32 - 2588.80] when i was younger i'd say the spirit of
[2586.08 - 2590.96] compassion like why vitamin c
[2588.80 - 2593.20] i hate having these annoying questions
[2590.96 - 2596.72] but why
[2593.20 - 2599.76] because your anxiety is spawned on
[2596.72 - 2601.92] by low-grade viral infections
[2599.76 - 2603.44] and that's what's happening to everyone
[2601.92 - 2605.20] spirit combat should be like everybody's
[2603.44 - 2606.96] anxiety spawned on by low-grade viral
[2605.20 - 2609.36] infections
[2606.96 - 2610.96] and free radicals such as toxic heavy
[2609.36 - 2613.52] metals
[2610.96 - 2616.24] vitamin c doesn't take out all the toxic
[2613.52 - 2620.16] heavy metals that's not it at all
[2616.24 - 2622.24] but at least it helps to neutralize
[2620.16 - 2623.52] byproduct and runoff from toxic heavy
[2622.24 - 2626.96] metals
[2623.52 - 2631.28] the black stuff that
[2626.96 - 2635.36] oxidizes the black oxidation
[2631.28 - 2637.12] that material that oxidizes
[2635.36 - 2640.96] it comes off of toxic heavy metals
[2637.12 - 2644.08] vitamin c helps to neutralize that
[2640.96 - 2646.48] that oxidation vitamin c
[2644.08 - 2648.00] helps to lower low-grade viral
[2646.48 - 2649.92] infections that are causing somebody's
[2648.00 - 2652.16] anxiety this covers i'm talking about
[2649.92 - 2654.00] all neurological symptoms too you guys
[2652.16 - 2656.24] low-grade viral infections toxic heavy
[2654.00 - 2658.32] metals a lot of that neurological lyme
[2656.24 - 2660.64] people are jacked up in tons of mercury
[2658.32 - 2662.80] they got mercury in them
[2660.64 - 2664.24] they're loaded with mercury mercury in
[2662.80 - 2665.68] the brain mercury in their nervous
[2664.24 - 2667.84] system mercury in their liver when they
[2665.68 - 2670.00] got neurological lyme
[2667.84 - 2672.96] jacked up with mercury and low-grade
[2670.00 - 2672.96] viral infections
[2674.08 - 2678.24] yep i see there's a lot of trolls there
[2677.04 - 2680.08] huh everybody's saying there's tons of
[2678.24 - 2682.72] trolls
[2680.08 - 2684.16] so we got the vitamin c that's the micro
[2682.72 - 2686.08] c
[2684.16 - 2687.92] it's of energy microc if you guys don't
[2686.08 - 2689.84] know of energy i know you guys most of
[2687.92 - 2691.12] you guys do let's be using victor i am
[2689.84 - 2694.24] ergy dot com
[2691.12 - 2695.84] i'm not sponsored by these guys so
[2694.24 - 2697.04] we're in cleanse the heel if everybody
[2695.84 - 2697.76] wants to know we're in the supplement
[2697.04 - 2699.76] section
[2697.76 - 2702.24] this is a different kind of live this is
[2699.76 - 2704.48] a live showing you
[2702.24 - 2706.24] an example if you find your symptom you
[2704.48 - 2707.60] find your condition
[2706.24 - 2709.92] if you're somebody with multiple
[2707.60 - 2714.16] symptoms multiple conditions
[2709.92 - 2717.20] pick the one that bothers you the most
[2714.16 - 2718.80] you can pick another one too but if you
[2717.20 - 2720.48] pick the one that's bothering you the
[2718.80 - 2722.00] most chances are a lot of the other
[2720.48 - 2725.28] symptoms will start going away as you're
[2722.00 - 2725.28] healing which is really great
[2725.84 - 2729.44] the best book marisa clenzie heel
[2730.84 - 2735.20] yep so moving down the line a little bit
[2733.60 - 2736.88] let's go into a couple other different
[2735.20 - 2741.20] conditions so
[2736.88 - 2741.20] um i want to talk about that as well
[2742.88 - 2746.72] so if you're somebody that's like but i
[2745.04 - 2748.32] don't want to do all these supplements
[2746.72 - 2750.00] but i want to do medical medium i want
[2748.32 - 2751.28] to know the protocols i want to know how
[2750.00 - 2754.64] to heal
[2751.28 - 2757.20] then you do the top four and i talk
[2754.64 - 2760.64] about in here b12 is one of the top four
[2757.20 - 2764.56] right there lemon balm vitamin c
[2760.64 - 2769.44] one of the top four right or you can do
[2764.56 - 2771.60] top eight you can do top eight zinc
[2769.44 - 2772.56] right there it's important there too so
[2771.60 - 2776.48] you do some zinc
[2772.56 - 2779.12] you got your b12 you got your vitamin c
[2776.48 - 2779.76] okay that's top three you could do top
[2779.12 - 2782.72] two
[2779.76 - 2783.68] maybe pick the b12 and the zinc right
[2782.72 - 2784.88] there
[2783.68 - 2786.64] you don't it's not about being
[2784.88 - 2789.52] overwhelmed it's about knowing you're
[2786.64 - 2792.00] heading in the right direction
[2789.52 - 2793.12] and knowing a little bit at a time you
[2792.00 - 2795.36] can chip away
[2793.12 - 2798.00] and chip away and climb up that ladder
[2795.36 - 2798.00] and heal
[2798.08 - 2800.88] but then people pick the wrong
[2799.44 - 2804.48] supplements they'll pick the wrong
[2800.88 - 2807.60] supplement or the wrong kind or whatever
[2804.48 - 2810.24] details matter when you gotta heal man
[2807.60 - 2811.60] they matter it was complicated when we
[2810.24 - 2816.08] got sick
[2811.60 - 2819.52] it was complicated when we got sick
[2816.08 - 2821.60] right complicated toxic heavy metals
[2819.52 - 2824.40] from utero
[2821.60 - 2827.84] complicated different viral infections
[2824.40 - 2829.76] in streptococcus throughout the years
[2827.84 - 2832.08] contracting it with just you know you
[2829.76 - 2834.72] know on the dating scene

[2843.20 - 2847.68] school and got mono
[2846.00 - 2850.00] jorah says medical medium healed my
[2847.68 - 2852.64] cystic acne microc was a big help
[2850.00 - 2854.24] it it is a big help for so many people
[2852.64 - 2857.44] i'm honored to hear
[2854.24 - 2860.00] thank you for being here getting sick is
[2857.44 - 2863.36] is complicated we burn our adrenals out
[2860.00 - 2863.36] we do years of caffeine
[2863.92 - 2867.44] marissa says it's about understanding
[2865.68 - 2869.68] what causes your symptoms and conditions
[2867.44 - 2871.52] it really matters exactly
[2869.68 - 2873.84] but when you understand your symptoms
[2871.52 - 2875.12] and conditions it's a huge part about it
[2873.84 - 2876.72] right
[2875.12 - 2879.44] and that's what i love about this
[2876.72 - 2883.76] knowing the cause and the protocol
[2879.44 - 2885.20] matters it's complicated when we get
[2883.76 - 2886.88] sick
[2885.20 - 2888.40] we contract a lot of different viruses
[2886.88 - 2891.20] throughout our life eating in
[2888.40 - 2893.92] restaurants public bathrooms
[2891.20 - 2896.88] through other people right that passed
[2893.92 - 2899.76] down from our parents
[2896.88 - 2900.00] and we get a lot of toxic heavy metals
[2899.76 - 2902.64] from
[2900.00 - 2904.88] medical treatments there's toxic heavy
[2902.64 - 2906.72] metals and antibiotics
[2904.88 - 2908.96] lots of it lots of it we take an
[2906.72 - 2909.52] antibiotic there's toxic heavy metals in
[2908.96 - 2911.12] there
[2909.52 - 2913.20] it's toxic heavy metals and
[2911.12 - 2916.80] pharmaceuticals
[2913.20 - 2917.36] so we're do work but what happens is
[2916.80 - 2920.16] that we get
[2917.36 - 2920.88] over time we get a lot of different
[2920.16 - 2923.84] toxin
[2920.88 - 2924.24] toxins chemtrails other exposures metal
[2923.84 - 2926.32] through
[2924.24 - 2928.64] just aluminum foil whatever it is
[2926.32 - 2930.32] drinking out of cans
[2928.64 - 2931.92] the happy girl 99 thank you anthony
[2930.32 - 2934.16] williams three years since discovering

[2954.24 - 2958.88] that once you learn a little bit as
[2956.64 - 2960.88] you're diving into it and understand
[2958.88 - 2962.16] how it works just a little bit at a time
[2960.88 - 2964.08] you can get there
[2962.16 - 2967.04] you can customize it to the way you need
[2964.08 - 2967.04] to customize it
[2969.44 - 2976.08] so how do we heal
[2973.28 - 2978.00] how we have to know what's wrong and we
[2976.08 - 2979.76] have to know what to do
[2978.00 - 2981.44] we have to know what's wrong and why it
[2979.76 - 2985.36] happened and we have to know what to do
[2981.44 - 2989.12] what to do this is what how it works
[2985.36 - 2991.20] you can't heal entirely if you have a
[2989.12 - 2993.60] problem if you don't know why you're
[2991.20 - 2993.60] sick
[2993.76 - 2997.68] you know what's crazy is someone who
[2995.60 - 3000.40] gets sick today
[2997.68 - 3002.00] it looks like it looks like everything
[3000.40 - 3003.52] is all set for you to heal
[3002.00 - 3006.72] out there well first go to my
[3003.52 - 3008.88] conventional doctor i'll start with that
[3006.72 - 3011.60] i'll get a whole bunch of blood work and
[3008.88 - 3013.44] then i'll go to my next doctor
[3011.60 - 3014.96] try that then i'll go to a specialist
[3013.44 - 3016.48] now i'm gonna go to my functional doctor
[3014.96 - 3018.00] now i'm gonna go to my chiropractor
[3016.48 - 3019.28] now i'm gonna go to my naturopath and
[3018.00 - 3020.56] i'm gonna go to my health coach whatever
[3019.28 - 3022.64] it is my nutritionist
[3020.56 - 3024.24] and you're gonna and you think it's all
[3022.64 - 3027.68] there
[3024.24 - 3031.12] and everybody's like uh you got candida
[3027.68 - 3033.44] um you got it's
[3031.12 - 3035.04] you're actually it's genetic or you got
[3033.44 - 3038.72] autoimmune that's not an
[3035.04 - 3041.44] answer like those aren't answers
[3038.72 - 3043.44] you a gut health problem we got to
[3041.44 - 3045.92] balance your flora that's not that's not
[3043.44 - 3045.92] an answer
[3046.80 - 3051.44] marianne says why is the glycerin needed
[3049.52 - 3052.88] in the bemrg supplements
[3051.44 - 3055.28] a lot of other supplements don't have
[3052.88 - 3056.80] glycerin
[3055.28 - 3058.48] so there's a reason why one of the
[3056.80 - 3061.60] reasons why
[3058.48 - 3063.60] is because you can't just
[3061.60 - 3065.36] first of all you don't want it in a
[3063.60 - 3069.04] powder when it comes down to
[3065.36 - 3073.28] herbs number one you don't want it in
[3069.04 - 3076.64] a powder absorption doesn't happen
[3073.28 - 3079.52] it doesn't happen okay
[3076.64 - 3080.32] number two all nutrients absorb into
[3079.52 - 3084.64] your cells
[3080.32 - 3090.00] through some type of glucose
[3084.64 - 3090.00] some type of glucose by attaching
[3090.32 - 3096.48] those phytochemical compounds to a
[3092.48 - 3098.56] glucose you can absorb it
[3096.48 - 3100.24] that's why all those powders and
[3098.56 - 3102.96] formulas out there
[3100.24 - 3104.24] that people take so dumping in it's not
[3102.96 - 3106.32] attached to a glucose
[3104.24 - 3109.20] it'll never absorb and they just poop it
[3106.32 - 3112.16] out and poop it out poop it out
[3109.20 - 3113.20] so and you don't want alcohol so you
[3112.16 - 3116.48] have to have
[3113.20 - 3118.72] the glycerin but the key is
[3116.48 - 3120.72] when you use the glycerin the glycerin
[3118.72 - 3122.80] is a glucose a form of glucose that
[3120.72 - 3124.72] attaches itself to the nutrients and
[3122.80 - 3127.52] then draws the nutrients into
[3124.72 - 3127.52] your cells
[3129.04 - 3132.80] it's really brilliant really it's just
[3131.44 - 3138.08] it's it's brilliant how
[3132.80 - 3140.24] our bodies work and what they need
[3138.08 - 3140.24] so
[3141.12 - 3147.28] so glycerin is glucose yeah the form
[3145.36 - 3148.88] the form everything that's a
[3147.28 - 3150.48] carbohydrate or sugar of any kind that
[3148.88 - 3150.96] goes inside our body that's involved in
[3150.48 - 3153.20] our body
[3150.96 - 3154.72] floating around in her body is glucose
[3153.20 - 3155.36] so the minute the glycerin enters your
[3154.72 - 3158.56] mouth it
[3155.36 - 3160.32] it's glucose boom it's glucose
[3158.56 - 3162.80] christine thank you anthony you helped
[3160.32 - 3164.88] me heal not just my symptoms but my
[3162.80 - 3167.52] whole mind body and spirit
[3164.88 - 3168.40] 369 cleanse changed my entire life so
[3167.52 - 3172.40] grateful
[3168.40 - 3173.92] incredible christine so
[3172.40 - 3175.52] let's go into another part let's go into
[3173.92 - 3177.28] chemical food sensitivities which
[3175.52 - 3178.64] which i really like talking about a
[3177.28 - 3181.84] little bit even if it's just for a
[3178.64 - 3181.84] couple of minutes let's head there now
[3183.52 - 3187.28] rita is there anything about toddlers

[3205.20 - 3208.96] section in there called child liver
[3207.28 - 3210.32] because children when children are sick
[3208.96 - 3211.36] their liver is involved
[3210.32 - 3214.00] when they're sick with anything
[3211.36 - 3215.52] excellent psoriasis vitiligo anything
[3214.00 - 3217.76] like that when children are sick
[3215.52 - 3218.80] it's liver related very important to
[3217.76 - 3222.00] know so that's
[3218.80 - 3224.40] in here too everyone with
[3222.00 - 3225.44] chemical and food sensitivities is
[3224.40 - 3227.92] different

[3227.92 - 3232.00] any of the supplements in this chapter
[3229.52 - 3232.64] the list here is simply a starting point
[3232.00 - 3235.44] for some
[3232.64 - 3237.04] sensitive people the fresh celery juice
[3235.44 - 3240.56] you've got the chemical sensitivities
[3237.04 - 3240.56] you start with this fresh celery juice
[3243.52 - 3246.96] everybody's different because of what
[3244.80 - 3248.56] they have going on some people have more
[3246.96 - 3250.24] viral activity some people have more
[3248.56 - 3252.32] toxic heavy metal

[3293.12 - 3298.56] the doctor will be perplexed everybody's
[3296.24 - 3301.52] different

[3331.36 - 3337.28] sensitivities are going to be different
[3334.24 - 3337.28] see how it works you guys
[3339.12 - 3343.20] the list here is simply a starting point
[3340.96 - 3347.12] start with fresh celery juice
[3343.20 - 3347.12] maybe celery force
[3347.68 - 3352.64] it's not because your body is different
[3350.48 - 3354.56] we're human beings
[3352.64 - 3356.24] strike 77 wasn't that funny the other
[3354.56 - 3358.88] day
[3356.24 - 3362.24] strength good to see you turned out it
[3358.88 - 3367.12] was a mistake
[3362.24 - 3370.96] so anyway you guys
[3367.12 - 3371.52] so you can do raw honey in some herbal
[3370.96 - 3373.84] tea
[3371.52 - 3375.04] like a lemon balm tea you can take it
[3373.84 - 3377.60] gently you can do
[3375.04 - 3378.48] you can just do little things it's not
[3377.60 - 3383.44] because
[3378.48 - 3385.76] your body is different
[3383.44 - 3387.60] it's because of what's residing inside
[3385.76 - 3388.96] your body is different
[3387.60 - 3390.80] someone could have had a big trigger
[3388.96 - 3392.16] they could have mold exposure and they
[3390.80 - 3394.56] got two viruses
[3392.16 - 3395.92] and they got toxic heavy metals and they
[3394.56 - 3398.24] had a fluoride treatment
[3395.92 - 3399.44] too many one fluoride treatment too many
[3398.24 - 3401.12] you guys had too many fluoride
[3399.44 - 3403.04] treatments
[3401.12 - 3404.64] some people got scented candles burning
[3403.04 - 3406.00] in their house all day long
[3404.64 - 3408.24] they go out and they get a fluoride
[3406.00 - 3409.60] treatment right
[3408.24 - 3412.00] and it pushes and they just have their
[3409.60 - 3413.44] carpets cleaned some people love to get
[3412.00 - 3415.92] their carpets cleaned by a conventional
[3413.44 - 3417.12] carpet cleaning service every month
[3415.92 - 3419.44] and they're getting saturated with
[3417.12 - 3421.36] solvents and poisoned
[3419.44 - 3423.28] everybody's different it's about what
[3421.36 - 3423.76] you have inside of you that makes you
[3423.28 - 3424.88] different
[3423.76 - 3427.84] and that's that's how it works the
[3424.88 - 3429.44] chemical sensitivities tammy winters
[3427.84 - 3431.60] i've been doing celery force for six
[3429.44 - 3434.24] weeks it already has helped my
[3431.60 - 3434.72] split nails oh celery juice for six
[3434.24 - 3436.80] weeks
[3434.72 - 3439.76] it already has helped my split nails
[3436.80 - 3443.68] lower blood pressure and chronic fatigue
[3439.76 - 3446.08] incredible incredible and guess what
[3443.68 - 3448.16] guess what if you go into the chronic
[3446.08 - 3450.88] fatigue syndrome section
[3448.16 - 3452.40] right here in the book you can look at
[3450.88 - 3455.12] other things you can do
[3452.40 - 3455.84] if celery juice isn't enough yet because
[3455.12 - 3457.84] you may have
[3455.84 - 3459.20] someone's fatigue can go away with
[3457.84 - 3460.48] celery juice every day
[3459.20 - 3461.60] somebody else's might be there a little
[3460.48 - 3463.20] more stubborn because we've got some
[3461.60 - 3467.04] other problems so we have to go a little
[3463.20 - 3467.04] deeper we need to know the protocols
[3469.20 - 3473.76] for the other urban supplements take one
[3471.68 - 3474.96] take only one supplement one day
[3473.76 - 3476.40] another the next so one of the
[3474.96 - 3478.96] techniques for chemical sensitivity is
[3476.40 - 3482.64] just take one supplement a day
[3478.96 - 3486.00] the next day you take another supplement
[3482.64 - 3486.00] the next day you take another one
[3486.08 - 3489.36] that's a technique right there you can
[3487.60 - 3491.04] read about in here if you decide to take
[3489.36 - 3491.92] all of the supplements in this list it
[3491.04 - 3494.80] means you'll be
[3491.92 - 3495.12] on an eight day cycle a sensitivity is
[3494.80 - 3496.72] yet
[3495.12 - 3498.08] another reason to stay away from
[3496.72 - 3499.52] supplements with 50 ingredients let's
[3498.08 - 3501.84] talk about that right now this is really
[3499.52 - 3503.20] important
[3501.84 - 3504.88] one there's a way to move forward for
[3503.20 - 3505.92] everybody there's just a way to move
[3504.88 - 3508.88] forward
[3505.92 - 3510.24] it exists been here for 35 years since i
[3508.88 - 3511.92] started working with people and i worked
[3510.24 - 3515.60] with people when i was a little
[3511.92 - 3519.92] practical baby so
[3515.60 - 3521.84] but the point is there is a way right
[3519.92 - 3523.68] there is a way now there's something
[3521.84 - 3524.08] really important what was just said in
[3523.68 - 3527.20] here
[3524.08 - 3529.12] right here in this book a sensitivity is
[3527.20 - 3531.04] yet another reason to stay away from
[3529.12 - 3534.64] supplements with 50 ingredients in a
[3531.04 - 3537.68] bottle and i mean 20 ingredients too
[3534.64 - 3537.68] not just 50
[3540.44 - 3546.96] multivitamins multivitamin bottles
[3543.84 - 3548.56] infamous for not only ripping people off
[3546.96 - 3550.88] not only not helping because it's a
[3548.56 - 3553.04] smidgen of a low quality thing in there
[3550.88 - 3554.80] a smidgen smooth mission
[3553.04 - 3556.24] but it's aggravating for people who are
[3554.80 - 3558.24] sensitive
[3556.24 - 3559.52] multivitamins are aggravating for people
[3558.24 - 3561.12] who are sensitive
[3559.52 - 3564.72] if you're somebody sensitive and you're
[3561.12 - 3567.92] taking lemon balm and a multivitamin
[3564.72 - 3572.32] you'll probably think the multivitamin
[3567.92 - 3574.16] is great and the lemon balm is a problem
[3572.32 - 3576.32] even though lemon balm's just one thing
[3574.16 - 3576.80] one thing with the multivitamin you'd be
[3576.32 - 3578.88] like no
[3576.80 - 3580.64] multivitamins we get brainwashed we get

[3957.92 - 3961.52] what we call colds these days are

[3969.20 - 3973.44] to all the doctors out there in the
[3970.88 - 3976.56] world colds are gone
[3973.44 - 3979.84] there are no cold cold bugs
[3976.56 - 3981.76] that create colds you either have a mild
[3979.84 - 3984.32] flu or you have a bad flu
[3981.76 - 3985.44] or a moderate flu mild flu moderate flu
[3984.32 - 3989.44] or bad flu
[3985.44 - 3994.24] or mild plague moderate plague
[3989.44 - 4000.24] or bad plague which is the flu family
[3994.24 - 4000.24] by the way engineer flu family
[4000.88 - 4004.48] many many years ago there were different
[4002.48 - 4006.24] varieties of common cold viruses that
[4004.48 - 4008.08] could give you the sniffles a scratchy
[4006.24 - 4009.20] throat and sometimes a fever under 100
[4008.08 - 4012.16] degrees
[4009.20 - 4012.88] that was the cold virus for many many
[4012.16 - 4016.64] years
[4012.88 - 4016.64] a long time ago
[4017.44 - 4020.72] in order for this to happen you would
[4019.12 - 4021.68] really need to have a lowered immune
[4020.72 - 4023.68] system
[4021.68 - 4025.12] which most often occurred due to not
[4023.68 - 4027.12] being clothed right
[4025.12 - 4028.88] check this out you guys for damp weather
[4027.12 - 4032.40] and experiencing temperature shock from
[4028.88 - 4032.40] being exposed to the elements
[4032.48 - 4037.28] these cold viruses never created what
[4034.80 - 4039.36] we're up against in the present today
[4037.28 - 4040.40] today if we experience those symptoms
[4039.36 - 4042.08] and they're mild
[4040.40 - 4044.56] we're really dealing with a mild
[4042.08 - 4047.04] influenza strain
[4044.56 - 4047.68] when the symptoms are worse we're still
[4047.04 - 4050.72] dealing
[4047.68 - 4052.32] with influenza
[4050.72 - 4054.56] flus are going around right now be
[4052.32 - 4055.52] prepared stomach flu is going around be
[4054.56 - 4057.20] prepared
[4055.52 - 4059.12] foods are going around this fall coming
[4057.20 - 4060.80] up be prepared to what's to come
[4059.12 - 4062.24] we're also dealing with the plague gonna
[4060.80 - 4065.12] deal with the plague all fall we're
[4062.24 - 4067.04] gonna deal with the flus
[4065.12 - 4068.64] and the winter and there's gonna be some
[4067.04 - 4071.28] pretty bad flus and stuff
[4068.64 - 4072.16] people's immune systems are down more
[4071.28 - 4074.64] than ever before
[4072.16 - 4076.16] in our history and this year this year
[4074.64 - 4079.12] people's immune systems are
[4076.16 - 4079.52] just flat busted right now people are
[4079.12 - 4081.92] going to be
[4079.52 - 4083.92] contracting flus more than ever i'm not
[4081.92 - 4085.92] trying to spook anybody i'm just saying
[4083.92 - 4087.36] you might want to just be prepared talk
[4085.92 - 4088.72] to your doctor if you want to
[4087.36 - 4090.56] ask your doctor if it's okay you can
[4088.72 - 4092.32] have a little zinc or you know some good
[4090.56 - 4093.44] quality zinc like the best quality zinc
[4092.32 - 4095.36] or something in some
[4093.44 - 4097.12] micro sea or something so we're in
[4095.36 - 4098.88] supplements and protocol section of cold
[4097.12 - 4100.24] and flu
[4098.88 - 4103.04] so let's just talk about this a little
[4100.24 - 4105.28] bit this is important
[4103.04 - 4107.68] even the stomach bugs that go around are
[4105.28 - 4110.32] particular strains of the flu unless you
[4107.68 - 4112.24] had food poisoning you guys
[4110.32 - 4114.00] the flu can enter a family of five and
[4112.24 - 4115.84] each individual can experience different
[4114.00 - 4119.28] symptoms as the strain leaves one family
[4115.84 - 4121.28] member and moves on to the next
[4119.28 - 4123.04] the strain mutates from person to person
[4121.28 - 4123.68] plus everybody's immune system reacts
[4123.04 - 4125.92] differently
[4123.68 - 4127.44] so the last family member's flu may be
[4125.92 - 4128.32] very different from the first family
[4127.44 - 4130.24] member's flu
[4128.32 - 4131.52] for example one person may get a sore
[4130.24 - 4133.44] throat runny nose
[4131.52 - 4135.76] and cough for three days while the next
[4133.44 - 4139.44] gets 103 degree temperature and a very
[4135.76 - 4142.48] long lasting cough and sinus drainage
