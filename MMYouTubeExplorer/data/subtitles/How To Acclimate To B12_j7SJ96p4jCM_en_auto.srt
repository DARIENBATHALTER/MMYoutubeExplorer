1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,680
that's the vimer gb12 so I want to show

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:07,200
you okay what you can do is you take a

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:09,360
tiny drop and you put it on your hand

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,120
tiny drop right on your hand and you let

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,280
it sit there and you can just dab it on

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,480
there like this your body starts to

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:20,519
acclimate it starts to prepare and get

8
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:23,000
ready for something that's going to help

9
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:25,800
change your life you can leave it on

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,400
there just for a couple of minutes once

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,359
a day when those couple of minutes are

12
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:35,079
up you do this what happens is your body

13
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:37,200
is now recalibrating rewiring your brain

14
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:40,520
your nervous system your entire body is

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,200
rewiring to that B12 now I like doing

16
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:46,239
this with B12 because B12 is

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,600
fundamentally how we exist it is

18
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:52,719
fundamentally how we exist on this

19
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:55,079
planet we need B12 or we die what this

20
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,160
does It prepares your vus nerves that

21
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,559
are inflamed It prepares your central

22
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:04,040
nervous system your brain your liver

23
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:06,640
which is the converter of supplements

24
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:09,880
and what I love about B12 I'm not

25
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,040
speaking for all B12 out there I'm not

26
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,680
because I don't know the crap that's in

27
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,680
beachall bottles all across the land

28
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,240
I've seen it all out there that's why I

29
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,680
support Vin that's why I work with them

30
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,240
because of this fact that that's what

31
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,880
the companies do out there but what I'm

32
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,320
trying to say is the methab balam and

33
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,799
the sto silic B in right this these

34
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,600
co-enzymes right here in this bottle so

35
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,079
what I like to do is put it on a hand

36
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,320
for people who are sensitive and you do

37
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:37,680
that once a day and then this

38
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,960
acclamation process happens this goes to

39
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,720
the skin it's heading into the liver

40
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,880
already drawing it in from this process

41
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:49,280
but in such a minute amount on a level

42
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:52,399
that is actually Awakening your natural

43
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,719
ability to absorb assimilate and

44
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,320
methylate supplementation because if

45
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:57,759
you've been that sensitive where you're

46
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,240
in that place where you're super

47
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:04,000
sensitive you've been through a lot

48
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:07,079
exposures Galore this is a way to get it

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,560
to really go into your system and get

50
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:13,680
you rewired re acclimated redirected

51
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:17,319
your body wants this stuff it wants B12

52
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,319
because guess what we need it it's

53
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,720
critical
