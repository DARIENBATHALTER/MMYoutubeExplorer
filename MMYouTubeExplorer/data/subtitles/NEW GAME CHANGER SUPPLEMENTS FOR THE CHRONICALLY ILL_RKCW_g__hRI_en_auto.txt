[0.08 - 3.68] this
[1.04 - 5.76] and what i was saying one time recently
[3.68 - 8.80] right you guys saw the post about it
[5.76 - 11.12] being a game changer for the chronicle
[8.80 - 13.44] i mean it and there's a lot to be said
[11.12 - 15.20] about propolis and how it works but the
[13.44 - 16.48] problem with propolis
[15.20 - 18.64] there hasn't been really great
[16.48 - 20.56] propolises out there that's one of the
[18.64 - 22.64] big problems so i'm talking about the
[20.56 - 24.08] vimergy propolis right
[22.64 - 25.92] and i just want to make it clear i'm not
[24.08 - 28.32] sponsored
[25.92 - 30.64] but i have to talk about it because it's
[28.32 - 33.20] that important for the chronic allele i
[30.64 - 34.48] mean when it comes down to like chronic
[33.20 - 37.28] illness
[34.48 - 41.04] pathogens are involved number one right
[37.28 - 43.76] we don't have a lot of tools out there
[41.04 - 46.88] a lot of tools that handle certain
[43.76 - 49.44] pathogenic issues all right
[46.88 - 51.60] and so propolis is a critical
[49.44 - 53.60] piece that's missing out there now there
[51.60 - 55.92] yeah there's propolis out there but
[53.60 - 57.68] there's next level propolis which is an
[55.92 - 58.72] entirely different thing now what i love
[57.68 - 61.44] about
[58.72 - 64.40] the vimergy propolis is because
[61.44 - 67.52] sensitive people this is a big deal
[64.40 - 69.52] people who are hypersensitive
[67.52 - 71.44] their stomachs are sensitive they're
[69.52 - 73.68] sensitive with neurological lyme they're
[71.44 - 75.52] sensitive with lupus they're sensitive
[73.68 - 76.76] with food allergies they're sensitive
[75.52 - 78.32] with things
[76.76 - 80.88] sensitivities
[78.32 - 83.68] all these years so many people being
[80.88 - 87.68] sensitive and then the propolis is all
[83.68 - 88.88] being saturated in solvents and alcohol
[87.68 - 90.72] out there
[88.88 - 92.80] so over the years i'd be telling doctors
[90.72 - 94.56] that person needs to be on propolis make
[92.80 - 96.88] sure you get that patient with multiple
[94.56 - 98.24] sclerosis neurological lyme with lupus
[96.88 - 99.92] with all their aches and pains with
[98.24 - 101.36] their tinnitus to vertigo all this
[99.92 - 104.96] different stuff make sure you get that
[101.36 - 108.16] patient on propolis but the problem has
[104.96 - 109.92] always been this
[108.16 - 111.84] different varieties of low-grade
[109.92 - 113.12] horrible alcohol
[111.84 - 115.44] right
[113.12 - 116.96] and solvents
[115.44 - 121.04] and solvents
[116.96 - 124.32] and then low-grade propolis from bees
[121.04 - 125.52] that aren't being taken care of
[124.32 - 127.84] watched
[125.52 - 129.28] right are cared for so this is a big
[127.84 - 131.20] deal so
[129.28 - 132.72] so i'm here to talk about propolis for a
[131.20 - 134.24] little bit chronic illness aches and
[132.72 - 136.00] pains all the different symptoms right
[134.24 - 137.28] neurological symptoms all of it i'm
[136.00 - 139.20] talking about propolis this is the
[137.28 - 140.48] vimergy propolis right here
[139.20 - 142.72] in my hand
[140.48 - 145.36] i don't usually do this i don't usually
[142.72 - 148.48] sit here this like this
[145.36 - 151.92] ecstatic like excited because i know
[148.48 - 154.64] breakthroughs when a breakthrough comes
[151.92 - 157.76] and i'm all over it right all over it so
[154.64 - 159.68] that's how that's how serious this is so
[157.76 - 161.20] i'm actually really excited about this
[159.68 - 163.36] so i just want to say
[161.20 - 167.04] people say well vimergy is expensive
[163.36 - 168.88] well it is because it's not
[167.04 - 170.96] in the sense we're like for instance
[168.88 - 173.36] this propolis right here it's only a
[170.96 - 176.16] little over eight dollars an ounce
[173.36 - 178.96] there's four ounces other propolises you
[176.16 - 180.80] get the one ounce bottle
[178.96 - 183.60] and it's 11
[180.80 - 186.40] 10 for one ounce
[183.60 - 188.48] ten eleven dollars for one ounce
[186.40 - 191.20] this is roughly around eight dollars
[188.48 - 194.80] right around eight dollars for one ounce
[191.20 - 199.36] but there's four ounces in the bottle so
[194.80 - 202.24] this is a whole another level of quality
[199.36 - 203.92] so it's almost four ounces quality
[202.24 - 205.36] and then what it offers so i just want
[203.92 - 207.12] to cover talk about proposed for a
[205.36 - 210.40] little bit so pro what is proposed what
[207.12 - 212.16] is it propolis what is it right
[210.40 - 214.80] okay
[212.16 - 218.24] this phytochemical compounds are resin
[214.80 - 219.36] created and gathered by bees from tree
[218.24 - 221.68] buds
[219.36 - 226.88] so medicine
[221.68 - 229.44] from trees medicine from tree buds right
[226.88 - 231.36] that's how incredible it is okay
[229.44 - 232.56] what it is essentially propolis is like
[231.36 - 235.84] a glue
[232.56 - 238.40] that the bee uses to take up spaces and
[235.84 - 240.96] hives right like any air air coming
[238.40 - 243.52] through the hives any open spaces so
[240.96 - 245.84] what bees do is they take that resin and
[243.52 - 248.72] they use it as a glue
[245.84 - 251.52] to protect the nests that's what the
[248.72 - 255.84] that's what the bees do okay
[251.52 - 258.96] but here's the thing propolis harbors
[255.84 - 261.04] medicine that's ahead ahead of everybody
[258.96 - 263.04] it's a head of science and research
[261.04 - 266.08] that's it like science can
[263.04 - 268.16] tap into propolis and tap into propolis
[266.08 - 269.92] and it's gonna take them decade after
[268.16 - 271.92] decade to find out how many different
[269.92 - 274.24] phytochemical compounds antioxidants
[271.92 - 276.24] polyphenols that are in there now the
[274.24 - 279.52] vimergy propolis
[276.24 - 281.44] it's done in a way to preserve that
[279.52 - 283.92] that those phytochemical compounds so
[281.44 - 286.08] it's done in a way to preserve
[283.92 - 289.12] the quercetin right to preserve the
[286.08 - 291.92] crystalline but to preserve the glandine
[289.12 - 294.24] the preserve these different incredible
[291.92 - 296.96] phytochemical compounds
[294.24 - 298.72] right and so that's the whole point it
[296.96 - 300.96] preserves them
[298.72 - 302.80] and then it preserves everything else in
[300.96 - 305.68] that so there's entity the other thing
[302.80 - 310.16] is there's no alcohol
[305.68 - 312.24] that's a big deal alcohol destroys
[310.16 - 314.16] the medicine and i've talked about this
[312.24 - 316.16] you guys alcoholic tinctures i've talked
[314.16 - 318.88] about this all the time so alcohol
[316.16 - 320.64] tinctures alcohol destroys the medicine
[318.88 - 322.08] now you may be like well this isn't nero
[320.64 - 323.44] how interesting is this he's talking
[322.08 - 325.60] about propolis
[323.44 - 328.16] it makes or break people it makes or
[325.60 - 330.72] breaks their healing process
[328.16 - 332.24] with cold source herpes simplex that
[330.72 - 333.84] gets into the body so i want to talk
[332.24 - 336.24] about stuff
[333.84 - 339.12] so i want to bring
[336.24 - 340.24] this guy in front of me right now okay
[339.12 - 342.88] and
[340.24 - 344.64] let me just get
[342.88 - 345.68] let me get this guy's
[344.64 - 348.24] muscle
[345.68 - 351.52] muscles removed here right
[348.24 - 354.64] so the critical thing to understand here
[351.52 - 357.28] is when it comes down
[354.64 - 358.64] when it comes down to propolis right
[357.28 - 360.56] here we are
[358.64 - 362.48] all right
[360.56 - 363.76] so when people get sick what are they
[362.48 - 365.28] sick with
[363.76 - 367.28] what's going on well they're sick with
[365.28 - 369.84] pathogens that's the thing they're sick
[367.28 - 370.72] with pathogens and they got the toxins
[369.84 - 373.12] right
[370.72 - 374.40] pathogens and toxins you guys just came
[373.12 - 375.60] on here we're talking about about
[374.40 - 378.00] propolis but we're not talking about
[375.60 - 380.80] just any propolis talking about a break
[378.00 - 382.08] breakthrough in propolis and i've been
[380.80 - 383.92] waiting my whole life for this
[382.08 - 386.08] breakthrough i'm just letting you know
[383.92 - 387.92] i'm not sponsored i'm not an ambassador
[386.08 - 390.08] to the company
[387.92 - 392.48] i'm not an mlm person
[390.08 - 394.48] this is an impairment thing this isn't a
[392.48 - 396.16] game this is about the chronically ill
[394.48 - 397.28] this is about being sick and this is
[396.16 - 399.28] about
[397.28 - 401.68] about companies and this one
[399.28 - 403.92] specifically that broke the mold they
[401.68 - 406.80] went above and beyond so this is an
[403.92 - 408.72] exciting time for people who are sick
[406.80 - 410.32] so when it comes down to cranial nerves
[408.72 - 412.48] cranial nerves get inflamed because of
[410.32 - 415.12] pathogens that's one of the things that
[412.48 - 417.84] inflames cranial nerves okay and that's
[415.12 - 419.28] your trigeminal nerve right that's your
[417.84 - 421.60] vagus nerves
[419.28 - 422.56] right hypoglossal nerve
[421.60 - 424.16] okay
[422.56 - 425.76] so these are some of the vestibular
[424.16 - 428.48] nerve these are the nerves that come out
[425.76 - 430.48] off the brainstem people are sick
[428.48 - 432.72] right they got the ringing in the ears
[430.48 - 436.00] vestibular problems
[432.72 - 438.16] they got the vertigo and dizziness right
[436.00 - 440.56] because of because of inflamed vagus
[438.16 - 442.24] nerves they've got pain in their jaws
[440.56 - 443.52] pain in their mouth pain in the back of
[442.24 - 444.40] their head because their trigeminal
[443.52 - 446.08] nerves
[444.40 - 448.48] because of things like herpes simplex
[446.08 - 450.88] one they don't know or or shingles and
[448.48 - 452.64] they don't know it okay
[450.88 - 454.88] they've got the epstein bars creating
[452.64 - 457.60] all these neurotoxins that their skin
[454.88 - 459.68] burns they get the pudendum problems
[457.60 - 461.92] pudendal nerve problems where they're
[459.68 - 464.24] getting urgency and bladder problems and
[461.92 - 466.16] pain in their groin they get all the
[464.24 - 467.92] sciatic problems because of shingles in
[466.16 - 471.04] the on the sciatic nerve so people are
[467.92 - 473.60] walking around sick fatigued right
[471.04 - 476.16] and so there's this medical medium is
[473.60 - 477.92] about like tools to battle all that all
[476.16 - 479.76] the time with all the different tools
[477.92 - 481.44] and protocols right
[479.76 - 484.16] and then vimergy comes out with a
[481.44 - 485.76] product with with with a propolis
[484.16 - 487.60] that takes everything to the new level
[485.76 - 489.76] and why am i excited because it's more
[487.60 - 491.44] people gonna get better it's more people
[489.76 - 492.96] getting a chance to get better and move
[491.44 - 493.84] forward i've been calling all my doctor
[492.96 - 495.44] friends
[493.84 - 497.04] and saying you got to get your patience
[495.44 - 497.92] on this you got to get your patience on
[497.04 - 499.92] this
[497.92 - 502.72] this is the propolis we've been waiting
[499.92 - 503.68] for it's that big of a deal
[502.72 - 505.28] right
[503.68 - 506.96] so deborah says does this help with
[505.28 - 508.56] neurological symptoms and that's on
[506.96 - 509.76] facebook deborah yes and that's the
[508.56 - 511.68] whole point
[509.76 - 513.52] it's for things like this and that's
[511.68 - 515.68] what people are suffering from so i want
[513.52 - 518.32] to talk about like okay let me just give
[515.68 - 520.88] you some tips here cold sores
[518.32 - 523.76] putting propolis on cold sores and fever
[520.88 - 525.52] blisters and canker sores
[523.76 - 528.32] that alone
[525.52 - 531.20] is amazing when you have a propolis you
[528.32 - 532.32] can actually dab onto cold sores
[531.20 - 534.96] to kill
[532.32 - 537.52] the bug to help the immune system to
[534.96 - 538.32] help the immune cells right that's a big
[537.52 - 540.08] deal
[538.32 - 541.68] so people get the cold source and the
[540.08 - 544.08] cold sore virus sits inside the
[541.68 - 545.92] trigeminal nerve it sits in people and
[544.08 - 548.80] so what i love about this
[545.92 - 550.40] is people can do you
[548.80 - 552.32] talk to your doctor or what you can do
[550.40 - 553.28] but what i recommend friends and family
[552.32 - 556.16] okay
[553.28 - 558.08] anybody that has anything going on if
[556.16 - 560.40] they had a cold sore that means they
[558.08 - 563.04] still have the fever blister cold sore
[560.40 - 564.88] the simplex in their system if they have
[563.04 - 566.32] ebv they still have it in their system
[564.88 - 568.48] if they have these bugs they still have
[566.32 - 571.52] in their system this is something to be
[568.48 - 573.52] taken every single day
[571.52 - 574.48] there's the propolises out there are
[573.52 - 576.40] harsh
[574.48 - 578.96] they're harsh you guys
[576.40 - 580.56] they got solvents in them and alcohol in
[578.96 - 583.68] them by the way we're live on tick tock
[580.56 - 584.64] we're live on we're live on uh
[583.68 - 587.68] twitch
[584.64 - 589.52] we're live on youtube facebook we're
[587.68 - 590.96] live on rumble we're live on a whole
[589.52 - 592.00] bunch of different blood words telegram
[590.96 - 593.12] of course
[592.00 - 594.96] so
[593.12 - 596.72] people don't realize is that the
[594.96 - 598.56] propolis is out there
[596.72 - 601.04] they're weak there's alcohol and
[598.56 - 602.48] solvents in there there's nothing like
[601.04 - 604.96] this right here out there if you just
[602.48 - 607.36] came on here this isn't an mlm thing i'm
[604.96 - 609.36] not an ambassador to this company
[607.36 - 610.80] and i'm not sponsored it's just that
[609.36 - 613.12] when something comes out that that's
[610.80 - 614.56] incredible it's about the chronic it's
[613.12 - 616.40] about the chronic allele and it's about
[614.56 - 618.40] moving the needle it's about and that's
[616.40 - 620.24] what's critical about moving the needles
[618.40 - 621.76] i'm talking about dosages here what you
[620.24 - 622.88] could do
[621.76 - 624.56] so
[622.88 - 626.48] if you do get this talk to your doctor
[624.56 - 629.04] on how you can take it but this is for
[626.48 - 630.96] extra sensitive people people who can't
[629.04 - 633.36] even take supplements
[630.96 - 634.72] and people who have so much inflammation
[633.36 - 637.12] in the nerves and everything else and
[634.72 - 639.68] it's good for anybody and good for their
[637.12 - 642.48] anybody's immune system
[639.68 - 644.88] but it's gentle on the stomach which is
[642.48 - 647.68] a whole nother thing all on its own it
[644.88 - 650.24] doesn't have the alcohol
[647.68 - 652.48] it's like a liquid gold is what it is
[650.24 - 654.40] for what people what what's happening in
[652.48 - 655.92] people's bodies right now it's really
[654.40 - 657.76] really remarkable so i'm going to cover
[655.92 - 658.88] a little bit more about this
[657.76 - 660.64] so
[658.88 - 661.92] this isn't just
[660.64 - 663.52] a game
[661.92 - 665.04] where people realize supplement
[663.52 - 667.68] companies and supplements it's really
[665.04 - 669.12] kind of a big part of it it's a game
[667.68 - 672.48] it's really what it is you get the cheap
[669.12 - 675.28] crap you bottle it up you mark it up and
[672.48 - 678.16] you bank that's what's done out there
[675.28 - 679.84] the difference between like vimergy is
[678.16 - 681.44] they actually care about the chronic leo
[679.84 - 683.52] i know because i've reached out to them
[681.44 - 685.04] years ago i've become friends with them
[683.52 - 686.08] and i told you that guys just like i try
[685.04 - 689.12] to become friends with all the
[686.08 - 691.20] supplement companies out there but they
[689.12 - 693.60] don't stay with with their they don't
[691.20 - 695.92] stay on course they always just go no
[693.60 - 697.60] it's about the dollar sorry aw i don't
[695.92 - 698.96] care about your chronically ill people
[697.60 - 700.32] we're going to bottle up what we need to
[698.96 - 702.88] bottle up because we're all about
[700.32 - 704.24] numbers and figures i'm fine done with
[702.88 - 705.36] you man
[704.24 - 707.20] but
[705.36 - 708.72] with vimorgy it's all about okay what
[707.20 - 710.72] can we do
[708.72 - 713.20] so this is the kind of people that that
[710.72 - 715.20] i want a relationship with so i've been
[713.20 - 717.84] friends with because and they're like
[715.20 - 720.16] what what do people need
[717.84 - 721.76] what do they need to heal and so they
[720.16 - 723.60] put out
[721.76 - 725.36] a probe list just like all their
[723.60 - 726.64] incredible stuff right they put out a
[725.36 - 728.48] probe list
[726.64 - 731.84] it changes everything because when it
[728.48 - 733.20] comes down to the whole pathogen thing
[731.84 - 734.56] people have to if okay if you don't
[733.20 - 736.00] believe you have a pathogen but you
[734.56 - 738.16] believe you have a parasite then believe
[736.00 - 740.56] you have a parasite fine
[738.16 - 742.24] but i would still be taking propolis
[740.56 - 743.60] you know that's what i would do so if i
[742.24 - 745.44] had a friend was like well i got
[743.60 - 747.52] parasites that's what i got well then
[745.44 - 750.88] promopolis is what you need lumicali
[747.52 - 754.08] says can it help with chronic sinusitis
[750.88 - 755.44] chronic sinusitis is the streptococcus
[754.08 - 757.20] right it's a lot of different strep
[755.44 - 758.64] varieties a lot of people carry strep
[757.20 - 760.16] people carry five different six
[758.64 - 762.00] different straps in them ten different
[760.16 - 764.40] straps in them that come up along the
[762.00 - 766.16] way we go to a public bathroom we pick
[764.40 - 769.36] up another one off a toilet seat it's
[766.16 - 771.68] just life here on planet earth right
[769.36 - 773.92] so propolis is incredible for like
[771.68 - 777.04] streptococcus for e coli all the
[773.92 - 779.44] different bacteria c diff each pylori
[777.04 - 781.12] and it's easy on the stomach people have
[779.44 - 783.12] stomach ulcers and stuff because
[781.12 - 785.28] bacteria is eating their ulcers the
[783.12 - 787.44] propolis is something that can battle
[785.28 - 788.88] that so what i'm right now what i've
[787.44 - 791.12] been doing right now between everything
[788.88 - 792.96] else on my busy schedule is i'm like i'm
[791.12 - 794.24] calling every doctor like i got just the
[792.96 - 795.92] roller decks out and calling every
[794.24 - 797.12] single doctor like hey hey how you been
[795.92 - 798.80] yep haven't talked to you in a few
[797.12 - 801.36] months listen
[798.80 - 802.88] the propolis is critical right here for
[801.36 - 804.08] people so if you guys just came on we're
[802.88 - 806.16] talking about propolis we're talking
[804.08 - 807.36] about neurological symptoms too we're
[806.16 - 809.28] talking about
[807.36 - 811.68] fibromyalgia chronic fatigue syndrome
[809.28 - 815.12] psoriatic arthritis yeah psoriatic
[811.68 - 817.20] arthritis r.a hashimoto's thyroiditis
[815.12 - 818.88] hypothyroidism hyperthyroidism we're
[817.20 - 819.76] talking about all the different symptoms
[818.88 - 821.68] right
[819.76 - 823.76] and then you've got the flus
[821.68 - 825.20] right that are going around that keep on
[823.76 - 828.24] coming around
[825.20 - 830.00] i won't name any names of flus or
[828.24 - 832.16] anything but the flues that keep on
[830.00 - 834.32] coming around
[832.16 - 836.08] so
[834.32 - 837.36] these things really matter
[836.08 - 839.52] when you think about it for immune
[837.36 - 841.28] system and everything else right
[839.52 - 844.64] so
[841.28 - 846.32] so cindy lou actually that's not true
[844.64 - 848.64] that's the cindy lou that's actually not
[846.32 - 848.64] true
[849.12 - 852.24] not without the solvents i'm just
[850.96 - 853.28] letting you know singular by the way
[852.24 - 854.56] good to see you because i know you leave
[853.28 - 858.32] a lot of youtube comments i read them
[854.56 - 859.76] all the time um yeah it it's yeah people
[858.32 - 862.08] are misled
[859.76 - 863.92] so what you said right there i told it
[862.08 - 865.76] very interesting what you said
[863.92 - 867.28] but here's how it works
[865.76 - 869.60] there's no propolis out there that
[867.28 - 873.44] haven't been involved with solvents
[869.60 - 875.12] no problemosis it's the only one to this
[873.44 - 876.96] day
[875.12 - 878.56] and the other ones will stay alcohol
[876.96 - 879.84] free
[878.56 - 881.44] but they're not
[879.84 - 884.96] solvent free
[881.44 - 887.36] and they're hidden alcohols that's how
[884.96 - 889.20] it's done with propolis
[887.36 - 891.04] this is the only one
[889.20 - 892.24] first time in our history where they
[891.04 - 894.40] said no
[892.24 - 895.84] we're not gonna hide anything we're not
[894.40 - 897.76] gonna hide the solvents we're not gonna
[895.84 - 899.20] hide the alcohol we're not gonna hide
[897.76 - 901.12] anything and we're gonna make sure we
[899.20 - 902.72] can do it without that and that's it
[901.12 - 904.08] santara's healing good to see you so
[902.72 - 906.16] excited to get this protocol thanks for
[904.08 - 908.64] always looking out for us
[906.16 - 911.28] yeah it and you can taste it when you
[908.64 - 914.00] get when you do a hit of it you know
[911.28 - 917.28] what's going on it's 120 milligrams per
[914.00 - 920.72] serving of this propolis okay
[917.28 - 923.60] right and it contains 50 of its active
[920.72 - 925.28] polyphenols okay
[923.60 - 927.76] that's a big deal
[925.28 - 930.08] that's a really big deal no propolis
[927.76 - 932.80] company can actually say
[930.08 - 934.96] that they contain up to 50 percent of
[932.80 - 937.12] active polyphenols i don't care what
[934.96 - 939.12] propolis company it is with propolis
[937.12 - 941.28] product they can't say it and they can't
[939.12 - 942.72] say they did it without involving
[941.28 - 944.00] solvents
[942.72 - 946.40] they can't
[944.00 - 947.84] that's the difference right here
[946.40 - 950.40] that's the difference if you just came
[947.84 - 952.56] on i'm not an mlm multi-level marketing
[950.40 - 953.68] guy not involved with anything like that
[952.56 - 955.84] of the sort
[953.68 - 957.92] i'm not sponsored by vimergy i'm not the
[955.84 - 960.08] owner of energy i told you that you guys
[957.92 - 961.04] about that i'm not an ambassador
[960.08 - 962.64] okay
[961.04 - 964.80] and it's and i'm not into pyramid
[962.64 - 966.08] schemes i'm into just making sure
[964.80 - 967.92] there's good stuff out there for the
[966.08 - 969.60] chronicle and that matters for what's
[967.92 - 971.52] happening now neurological symptoms and
[969.60 - 973.36] i told you guys it's it's exploding i
[971.52 - 974.24] remember when i gave you a warning about
[973.36 - 975.76] this
[974.24 - 977.68] about all the neurological symptoms
[975.76 - 979.84] ticks spasms
[977.68 - 982.88] fatigue aches and pains blurry eyes
[979.84 - 985.04] dizziness vertigo right burning skin
[982.88 - 987.12] pain in the jaw neck face trigeminal
[985.04 - 988.64] neuralgia right fibromyalgia all the
[987.12 - 990.56] different neurological symptoms i told
[988.64 - 992.00] you guys that in the heart palpitations
[990.56 - 994.48] that are neurological and i told you
[992.00 - 997.44] guys neurological symptoms are exploding
[994.48 - 999.76] like never before so when you see like
[997.44 - 1001.44] darkness happen out there because it's
[999.76 - 1002.56] what it is like darkness and you see
[1001.44 - 1004.16] everybody just getting sick with
[1002.56 - 1006.40] neurological symptoms and then things
[1004.16 - 1010.00] come from the light so then there's the
[1006.40 - 1011.52] light that helps to battle the darkness
[1010.00 - 1014.32] and that's the difference right so what
[1011.52 - 1016.64] it this is it's a light tool basically
[1014.32 - 1020.08] babyum says yo aw hey
[1016.64 - 1022.96] i was alone in a real dark place with my
[1020.08 - 1024.32] symptoms and illness then i found you
[1022.96 - 1026.48] your lives i'm honored you're here
[1024.32 - 1028.64] fabian truly my heart pours out to you
[1026.48 - 1029.76] for what you went through because
[1028.64 - 1031.04] you know
[1029.76 - 1033.04] because basically what happens and
[1031.04 - 1034.00] you're on youtube right there right and
[1033.04 - 1036.08] uh
[1034.00 - 1037.92] basically what happens fabian is people
[1036.08 - 1039.60] don't know what that's like if they
[1037.92 - 1042.00] haven't been into that dark they haven't
[1039.60 - 1043.76] been in that dark place
[1042.00 - 1046.00] and they haven't been there so just know
[1043.76 - 1047.20] that you're a survivor and a monitor
[1046.00 - 1049.04] here
[1047.20 - 1050.88] so someone's asking on tick tock so how
[1049.04 - 1052.40] can this help fibromyalgia so first of
[1050.88 - 1054.88] all let's talk about fibromyalgia
[1052.40 - 1059.04] fiber fibromyalgia
[1054.88 - 1061.28] are inflamed nerves inflamed because of
[1059.04 - 1063.92] pathogens epstein-barr is the
[1061.28 - 1066.72] inflammation creator of fibromyalgia so
[1063.92 - 1068.72] if you're somebody with fibro right
[1066.72 - 1070.96] and you just your your shoulders are
[1068.72 - 1073.04] sore you can't bump into a wall you
[1070.96 - 1076.08] can't just go and bump into a wall right
[1073.04 - 1078.08] here like that you can't do that
[1076.08 - 1080.16] because what happens with fibromyalgia
[1078.08 - 1083.04] you get the pain and you get the pain in
[1080.16 - 1084.96] the elbows like it just rings in here
[1083.04 - 1086.48] rings in the shoulders you can get
[1084.96 - 1088.08] fibromyalgia where you just hurt
[1086.48 - 1090.08] everywhere you wake up in the morning
[1088.08 - 1092.32] and you're so sore and you just you're
[1090.08 - 1095.28] in pain if you push it too far
[1092.32 - 1096.40] everything hurts those are neurotoxins
[1095.28 - 1097.76] floating around because of the
[1096.40 - 1100.08] epstein-barr virus that's what
[1097.76 - 1101.44] fibromyalgia is and medical medium
[1100.08 - 1103.04] published it first and now science
[1101.44 - 1105.04] researchers starting to say hey
[1103.04 - 1106.24] epstein-barr causes everything now well
[1105.04 - 1107.92] you made fun of me for saying
[1106.24 - 1109.84] epstein-barr causes so many things and
[1107.92 - 1111.28] now you're taking the info
[1109.84 - 1113.76] but fibromyalgia is because of
[1111.28 - 1117.40] epstein-barr right
[1113.76 - 1117.40] this is an antiviral
[1117.44 - 1120.88] okay
[1118.24 - 1123.20] anti-viral
[1120.88 - 1125.36] powerful tool right anti-viral
[1123.20 - 1126.08] anti-bacterial but anti-viral
[1125.36 - 1128.08] so
[1126.08 - 1130.80] it's one of those things where
[1128.08 - 1134.96] but it but it's
[1130.80 - 1137.92] affordable but it's also gentle
[1134.96 - 1140.16] that's the difference it's gentle
[1137.92 - 1142.08] and it's the only one
[1140.16 - 1144.24] that didn't get run through run through
[1142.08 - 1147.84] the ringer of solvents
[1144.24 - 1150.88] and the alcohols and the hidden alcohols
[1147.84 - 1152.24] no natural flavors no hidden natural
[1150.88 - 1153.92] flavors which is happening in all the
[1152.24 - 1155.68] supplements now you guys
[1153.92 - 1158.08] so this company won't do anything like
[1155.68 - 1159.92] that but what happens is that other
[1158.08 - 1162.48] companies they hide now all the natural
[1159.92 - 1164.40] flavors because medical medium
[1162.48 - 1166.08] said that natural flavors has the msg
[1164.40 - 1169.28] that's what msg is right it's natural
[1166.08 - 1171.44] flavors mm info for years now
[1169.28 - 1173.04] and so what happens is so now supplement
[1171.44 - 1175.36] companies are they're they're all
[1173.04 - 1176.88] nervous oh that medical medium ruined it
[1175.36 - 1178.96] for us we put natural flavors in
[1176.88 - 1180.64] everything with msg
[1178.96 - 1183.04] and so we better hide that now so
[1180.64 - 1184.64] they're hiding it so what's happening is
[1183.04 - 1186.40] supplement companies in the tincture
[1184.64 - 1188.56] bottles are hiding all their stuff and
[1186.40 - 1192.00] in the propolis world
[1188.56 - 1194.80] they're infamous for hiding solvents and
[1192.00 - 1197.44] hiding alcohol
[1194.80 - 1198.72] so this is the first propolis of its
[1197.44 - 1201.20] time
[1198.72 - 1204.00] in this day right now in time in history
[1201.20 - 1207.20] right here i'm marking this literally as
[1204.00 - 1210.32] one of those freedom power empowerment
[1207.20 - 1212.64] you know times in history
[1210.32 - 1215.28] for the chronically ill
[1212.64 - 1216.72] and so that's a big deal so let me talk
[1215.28 - 1218.16] about how you can even use it you can
[1216.72 - 1219.68] put it in a shot glass right there you
[1218.16 - 1221.28] can put a little bit of water in here
[1219.68 - 1223.44] too so i'll put a little bit of water in
[1221.28 - 1224.72] the shot glass right that's one way to
[1223.44 - 1226.80] do it
[1224.72 - 1228.64] you guys on tick tock the link for the
[1226.80 - 1230.48] propolis is in the bio
[1228.64 - 1231.68] on tick tock the link in the propolis is
[1230.48 - 1233.52] in the bio
[1231.68 - 1236.72] i mean the link for the propolis is in
[1233.52 - 1238.00] the is in the butt profile there so
[1236.72 - 1240.56] anyway
[1238.00 - 1241.92] yeah you can put propolis straight on
[1240.56 - 1243.52] your lisa where you say she puts it
[1241.92 - 1245.28] straight on your ex spots amazing you
[1243.52 - 1247.60] can put it straight on
[1245.28 - 1249.68] cold sores for sure canker sores that's
[1247.60 - 1250.96] what i love for people i tell people
[1249.68 - 1252.24] people with the worst kanger source of
[1250.96 - 1253.92] cold search you know how you get the
[1252.24 - 1255.68] kinky sores on the tongue so many people
[1253.92 - 1257.20] get that where their tongue is hurting
[1255.68 - 1258.32] all those little hot spots on their
[1257.20 - 1260.64] tongue
[1258.32 - 1263.12] that's a great place to put it too
[1260.64 - 1265.20] so that's just one thing right there
[1263.12 - 1268.08] but you can but you can here's the thing
[1265.20 - 1271.44] you can take it as a daily
[1268.08 - 1275.12] daily part of your regimen
[1271.44 - 1278.08] to slowly knock down pathogens
[1275.12 - 1281.44] so that other symptoms eventually go
[1278.08 - 1282.40] away it's one of those tools that's what
[1281.44 - 1284.00] it is
[1282.40 - 1285.52] courtney may good to see you i saw you
[1284.00 - 1287.12] leave some you're on youtube right now
[1285.52 - 1288.32] live amazing you made the lives you
[1287.12 - 1291.52] caught the live right now because you
[1288.32 - 1293.12] always say i missed alive
[1291.52 - 1294.96] so
[1293.12 - 1297.20] donna short just ordered mine still
[1294.96 - 1299.20] confused as to what it does and why so
[1297.20 - 1300.88] important okay so so donna when it comes
[1299.20 - 1303.04] down to the immune system propolis is
[1300.88 - 1305.36] one of those critical key
[1303.04 - 1307.28] tools for the immune system
[1305.36 - 1310.00] it does different things for the immune
[1307.28 - 1312.08] cells immune cells feed on phytochemical
[1310.00 - 1314.24] compounds that's how it works so
[1312.08 - 1316.40] propolis harbors
[1314.24 - 1318.16] phytochemical compounds
[1316.40 - 1321.04] certain polyphenols and other
[1318.16 - 1322.80] phytochemical compounds any antioxidants
[1321.04 - 1325.92] that the the immune system gobbles up
[1322.80 - 1327.44] like candy so your immune cells
[1325.92 - 1329.76] lymphocytes basophils monocytes
[1327.44 - 1331.04] neutrophils your immune cells right your
[1329.76 - 1332.80] white count
[1331.04 - 1335.52] gobbles up
[1332.80 - 1338.36] these phytochemical compounds
[1335.52 - 1339.92] that the bees produced
[1338.36 - 1342.08] strengthening
[1339.92 - 1343.60] the immune system strengthening it
[1342.08 - 1346.00] turning it into like one of those
[1343.60 - 1348.00] superpowers so when the strep throat
[1346.00 - 1349.52] comes you got the streptococcus when you
[1348.00 - 1351.36] got the acne because it's all
[1349.52 - 1353.84] streptococcus
[1351.36 - 1356.40] you're using a tool that starts to feed
[1353.84 - 1358.88] your immune system
[1356.40 - 1361.84] but it does more than that
[1358.88 - 1363.52] bugs don't like propolis so bugs in our
[1361.84 - 1365.28] system that keep us sick don't like
[1363.52 - 1366.88] propolis on any level they don't like
[1365.28 - 1368.40] propolis
[1366.88 - 1371.84] propolis
[1368.40 - 1373.92] hampers bugs down it hampers bugs down
[1371.84 - 1375.20] it knocks bugs down and that's what it
[1373.92 - 1377.20] does
[1375.20 - 1378.48] so that's how propolis works now you can
[1377.20 - 1380.00] talk to your doctor what's right for you
[1378.48 - 1381.52] but i'm recommending to all friends and
[1380.00 - 1384.72] family the whole bit i'm going to take a
[1381.52 - 1384.72] little propolis shot right now
[1385.28 - 1387.92] amazing
[1386.40 - 1389.20] and provost is incredible you can use it
[1387.92 - 1391.68] straight in your mouth
[1389.20 - 1394.96] you know no problem
[1391.68 - 1394.96] if you want if you want
[1395.68 - 1398.88] but
[1397.04 - 1400.32] what i like to do
[1398.88 - 1402.72] and i tell people
[1400.32 - 1405.76] you can put a dropper full in the mouth
[1402.72 - 1407.28] and let it stay in there if you need to
[1405.76 - 1408.64] and that's one thing someone can do but
[1407.28 - 1410.32] taking it with water is a great way to
[1408.64 - 1412.16] do it ask your doctor what's right for
[1410.32 - 1414.08] you make sure you ask your doctor if
[1412.16 - 1415.28] it's okay to you know take propolis if
[1414.08 - 1417.12] you do
[1415.28 - 1419.60] venture into it
[1417.12 - 1421.68] it's super gentle that's the whole point
[1419.60 - 1423.20] too that what i love about it it's super
[1421.68 - 1424.96] gentle a lot of people have
[1423.20 - 1426.40] gastroparesis a lot of people have mild
[1424.96 - 1428.00] gastroparesis more severe a lot of
[1426.40 - 1429.52] people have different problems and
[1428.00 - 1431.84] intestinal tract problems too but they
[1429.52 - 1433.60] can't take a supplement so you've got to
[1431.84 - 1435.20] take the ones that count or the ones
[1433.60 - 1437.76] that are gentle
[1435.20 - 1439.52] tracy vanderbilt smith love everything

[1489.76 - 1494.96] this is so great so you guys i'm heading
[1491.68 - 1496.48] off to ig i'm pretty sure in a little
[1494.96 - 1498.96] bit well i want to show you one other
[1496.48 - 1500.40] thing too that i forgot about the msm
[1498.96 - 1503.20] i'm so excited about the propolis i
[1500.40 - 1505.04] can't even i can't even
[1503.20 - 1506.96] wait can't remember the msm for the
[1505.04 - 1509.04] moment i brought it here
[1506.96 - 1511.60] so that's the msm with calcium and
[1509.04 - 1513.28] silica so anybody who's into msm right
[1511.60 - 1514.56] franks and pains and joint problems and
[1513.28 - 1516.96] all that other stuff and connective
[1514.56 - 1518.00] tissue problems like connective tissue
[1516.96 - 1521.04] all that
[1518.00 - 1523.52] right and hair skin nails
[1521.04 - 1526.08] hair skin and nail supplements right
[1523.52 - 1528.88] skin like skin and nail supplements
[1526.08 - 1530.16] right they don't work so when when you
[1528.88 - 1533.04] go out there and you want to buy hair
[1530.16 - 1534.56] skin nail supplement they don't work
[1533.04 - 1536.32] i'm just letting you know i've talked
[1534.56 - 1537.76] about that so many times for a lot of
[1536.32 - 1538.88] reasons because of the quality and
[1537.76 - 1540.96] everything else
[1538.88 - 1543.12] anyway there's the silica there's the
[1540.96 - 1546.00] msm product right for there for anybody
[1543.12 - 1548.32] that's that likes msm that uses them msm
[1546.00 - 1550.56] it's the best there is out there and
[1548.32 - 1552.80] vimergy put silica with it and put a
[1550.56 - 1554.80] little calcium with it they balance it
[1552.80 - 1556.96] out right and it's the highest quality
[1554.80 - 1559.36] msm out there so that's something else
[1556.96 - 1561.20] they came out with which is so great
[1559.36 - 1562.96] and it helps with people's knees and all
[1561.20 - 1564.56] that stuff that i've seen throughout the
[1562.96 - 1565.84] years so that's that but back to the
[1564.56 - 1568.40] propolis though you guys i can't tell
[1565.84 - 1569.84] you how how excited i am about this for
[1568.40 - 1570.88] so many reasons but you know what if you
[1569.84 - 1572.56] can

[1603.12 - 1607.60] if i came out with a medical medium line

[1607.60 - 1613.04] seem like okay well he's just trying to
[1609.36 - 1614.32] sell his medical medium line but
[1613.04 - 1616.40] this is just
[1614.32 - 1619.04] the bottom of my heart it's the best
[1616.40 - 1620.72] stuff i'm excited it's here
