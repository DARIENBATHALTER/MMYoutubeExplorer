1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:05,440
today we're talking about teeth damaging

2
00:00:02,679 --> 00:00:08,040
diets and we're making asparagus

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:11,120
sushi right here asparagus sushi I'm

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:13,480
excited about this right out of brain

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,480
saver

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,240
protocols what you'll see out there in

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,720
the world is everybody in the dental

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,560
chairs they're in the dentist offices

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,599
they're getting their teeth drilled

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,519
they're getting root canals cavities

11
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:30,880
filled they gum disease they're getting

12
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:33,840
that plaque ripped out right all that

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,520
plaque ripped out they're doing all that

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,559
too it's another thing

15
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:41,239
happening everybody's going in there and

16
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:45,960
they dread it they dread getting the

17
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:48,840
under the gum plaque ripped up it's

18
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,879
awful scrape scrape scrape scrape we're

19
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,120
going to numb you up here we'll do a

20
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,000
whole bunch of numbing agents scrape

21
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,680
scrape scrape scrape scrape that's a

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,960
painful process so many people are up

23
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,039
against that and then of course they get

24
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,239
root canals they get all kinds of

25
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,840
different things

26
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:05,400
see they have problems with their nerves

27
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,119
and their teeth they have pain that's

28
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,840
not even Dental caused but either way

29
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,439
people get a lot of root canals they

30
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,960
have a lot of problems with their Dentin

31
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:15,640
we're going to cover a little bit about

32
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,600
that all on its own we're also making a

33
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:20,680
sparga sushi but we're going into the

34
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,600
teeth big time and I'm proud to say I'm

35
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:26,720
going to say it right here every single

36
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:30,520
one of my teeth are mine they are not

37
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:33,119
implants every single one of

38
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,360
them that's key to know because people

39
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,399
are going to be probably wondering what

40
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:39,320
about his deep what about his deep it's

41
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:44,439
one thing the other thing right I don't

42
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:47,040
have one root canal not one root canal

43
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:50,560
important right there another thing too

44
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:53,520
aw doesn't have any gum disease on any

45
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:56,799
level not even the basic gum disease

46
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:00,439
that people have not one gum

47
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:03,520
disease and number three not one

48
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:06,680
organic cavity which is critical for

49
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,319
people to know how come how come aw

50
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:12,200
doesn't have all of that like what's

51
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:16,319
going on wonder wonder because I stay

52
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:17,720
away from teeth damaging diets it's one

53
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,440
thing too so we're going to talk about

54
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,599
also when you come into this world as a

55
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,800
child and you're severely Trace mineral

56
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:27,239
deficient and filled with a lot of heavy

57
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,000
metals because it's passed down from the

58
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:33,000
parents how teeth can become a problem

59
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,680
very early on with so many kids all the

60
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,400
way going into teenager and and young

61
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,120
adult and so forth how many teeth

62
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:42,519
problems so many people can have and

63
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:45,440
we're also going to cover how our teeth

64
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:47,959
just start to fall apart we don't see it

65
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,159
yet we don't know what's happening but

66
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:53,519
deep inside our teeth are starting to

67
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:56,640
fall apart we don't know and our acidic

68
00:02:53,519 --> 00:03:01,159
diets are actually draining the calcium

69
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:03,080
from our teeth and then out of nowhere

70
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:06,120
they fall apart when they fall apart

71
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,799
they are time capsules that means you

72
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,680
want to start a new diet that's really

73
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:11,560
special and great and your teeth start

74
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,799
falling apart right away within the

75
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,159
first week or month or the first few

76
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:18,760
months your teeth were going to fall

77
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,799
apart anyway because it took years for

78
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,640
them to fall apart and this is Inc

79
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:25,760

80
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,720

steamed it's not steamed to death but

108
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,240
yet it's actually a little softer I like

109
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,880
it that way for rolling up so it doesn't

110
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:34,000

it teeth destroying I like using that

140
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,479
word with this situation because it gets

141
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:41,960
that bad number one thing you got to

142
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:43,199
worry about right here probably one of

143
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,639
the number one things there's a bunch of

144
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:49,440
them what you see right here is vinegar

145
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:52,680
okay different vinegars I got the white

146
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,280
vinegar I got the vinegar that has a

147
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,440
darker color I don't care if it's apple

148
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,319
cider vinegar I don't care if it's

149
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,639
vinegar from planet Mars I don't care if

150
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:01,520
it's vinegar from planet Pluto I I don't

151
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:03,919
care if it's vinegar from somebody's own

152
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,599
backyard I don't care if it's red wine

153
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:10,080
balsamic I don't care what it is where

154
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:12,759
it comes from I don't care if a monkey

155
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,960
in a tree in Costa Rica made the vinegar

156
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:18,400
I don't care if someone pressed the

157
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,880
apples themselves in their basement

158
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,800
somewhere in the bush and made the

159
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,560
vinegar and I don't care if it's the

160
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,639
finest vinegar in Italy on a trip to

161
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,520
Europe I always feel better when I go to

162
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:30,880
Europe I'm always feeling better when I

163
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,080
go there how come everybody in Europe

164
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:36,479
though are sick sick sick sick and

165
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,880
they're eating the food too reason why I

166
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,759
must be feeling better when I go to

167
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:42,400
Europe is because it's a vacation I'm

168
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,000
not so stressed out and I'm happy to get

169
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,960
out of the states for a little while and

170
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,160
I could go on my little tour and I could

171
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,639
be yeah exactly anyway we're going to

172
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,960
cover that another day that's a big

173
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:53,599
topic the point is I don't care if the

174
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:56,440
vinegar comes from Grease it comes from

175
00:06:53,599 --> 00:07:00,280
Italy I don't care what kind it's going

176
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:03,280
to slowly destroy your teeth I can say

177
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:05,560
it over and over and over again until

178
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,720
I'm blue in the face like blue in the

179
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:11,400
face because people don't realize is

180
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,400
vinegar not just wears away the enamel

181
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:16,199
so you can stick a straw in something

182
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,199
and drink it thinking it's not going to

183
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:20,960
hit the enamel but that's not the

184
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:23,120
problem the vinegar goes in deep and

185
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,759
causes a Calcium deficiency meaning it

186
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,080
draws calcium every time you use vinegar

187
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,000
anywhere anyhow you're pulling calcium

188
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,479
from your teeth

189
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,319
yes and over time this gets worse and

190
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:38,400
worse meaning the effects happen each

191
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,919
year you don't even know it you might

192
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,800
not be aware of it and then and the

193
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:45,680
dentist doesn't even see it too doesn't

194
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:49,800
even see deep down in the tooth deep

195
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:51,919
down in the Dentin what's happening cuz

196
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,520
that's important right there so let's go

197
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,840
and let's talk about that a little bit

198
00:07:54,520 --> 00:08:00,199
down into the Dentin of the

199
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:03,319
tooth it starts there

200
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:07,400
that's where it starts in the Dentin

201
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:10,800
critical to know you do the vinegar and

202
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:15,879
then the vinegar eats away the inside

203
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:18,199
out not just from the outside the inside

204
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:20,000
out probably one of the most important

205
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:22,120
things to learn if you're trying to

206
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,440
protect your teeth now I don't have root

207
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:27,120
canals I don't have teeth problems I

208
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:30,560
don't have gum disease and I have all my

209
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:33,880
original teeth I don't have in plants

210
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:36,919
and I've never gotten veneers I don't go

211
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:38,680
and get professional whitenings okay I'm

212
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:40,760
not a supermodel supermodels get

213
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:43,919
professional whitenings like once a

214
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:45,320
month I get it that's what they do

215
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,839
they're getting veneers they're getting

216
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,120
dental work left and right they're

217
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:49,920
getting implants they're getting

218
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,560
whitenings I understand that's what

219
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,200
people do and people in the public eye

220
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:56,959
do that too I don't do anything for my

221
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,680
teeth to be in the public eye I just

222
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:02,560
want to make that clear to anybody

223
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:06,720
that's here here I protect my Dentin and

224
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:10,040
protect my teeth by not

225
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:12,519
doing one of the things that people do

226
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:14,519
every single day every salsa they have

227
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:17,600
every condiment every relish every

228
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:19,360
pickled this pickled that every little

229
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,839
thing that has vinegar in it from

230
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,760
mayonnaise to you name it they're doing

231
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:27,440
vinegar every single day you might be

232
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:29,880
one of the people that I don't want any

233
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,279
restrictions I can't have restriction I

234
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,079
want to eat what I want forget medical

235
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:36,120
meat restrictions I'm going to have all

236
00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:38,000
the vinegar I want oh my teeth are

237
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,360
falling apart 2 years later 3 years

238
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,320
later my teeth are falling apart during

239
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,480
that medical medium but I don't want to

240
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,200
let go of my vinegars no way I'm going

241
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,320
to make sure it's in all my condiments

242
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:51,680
and all my Salsas and all my dishes and

243
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,240
all my salads and people pay the price

244
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,600
so vinegar is one thing right there so

245
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,040
let's go a little deeper into it how

246
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,640
does it work the minute that vinegar

247
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,000
touches your mouth inside goes right

248
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,120
inside

249
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,880
there's a call for calcium your body

250
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:06,600
goes into freakout mode it's like

251
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:11,240
calcium where are you calcium where are

252
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:13,079
you instantly because it's acetic acid

253
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:15,640
send me the red wine vinegar the Apple

254
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:18,440
Ceta vinegar whatever kind you want the

255
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:21,240
minute it goes into your mouth your body

256
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:24,839
screaming an alarm Bell that alarm Bell

257
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:26,760
is calcium calcium the vinegar is acetic

258
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:29,959
acid it's going to create it's going to

259
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:32,560
create a problem it's going to burn the

260
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:35,440
body internally I'm not talking about

261
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,839
outside use there's there's uses for

262
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,600
vinegar on the outside of the body

263
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:43,920
periodically I'm talking about

264
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,959
internally so there's a call for calcium

265
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,959
it's kind of like when a fire starts in

266
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:50,160
a building and the fire department's

267
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:51,279
called and the fire department comes out

268
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,639
and they're freaking out and they're

269
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,920
bringing out their hoses and they're

270
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:55,800
trying to save lives and they're trying

271
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,399
to die out the fire what's happening is

272
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,560
your body is freaking out the minute

273
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:00,560
that acetic acid that vinegar enters

274
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,399
into your

275
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:06,120
mouth your body's calling for the fire

276
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:08,160
hose it's calling for the calcium fire

277
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:11,959
hose is what it's calling

278
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:14,360
for and that calcium fire hose is your

279
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:15,639
calcium storage bins so any kind of

280
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,880
calcium you got in your bloodstream

281
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:20,519
instantly gone instantly gone so what

282
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,639
happens with people don't

283
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:27,200
realize and this is an important thing

284
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:27,200
to know right off right off the start

285
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:32,360
here okay we have calcium floating

286
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,519
around the

287
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,480
bloodstream we have calcium that's

288
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:38,880
circulating around the bloodstream just

289
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,720
from the things you eat on a daily basis

290
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,120
cuz a little bit of calcium in almost

291
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,600
everything if you're a meat eater

292
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,560
there's a little touch of calcium in the

293
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,320
meat chicken eater there a little touch

294
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,240
of calcium in the chicken it's not much

295
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,680
but it's there if you eat a vegetable

296
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,720
there some calcium in there if you eat

297
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:57,600
an orange lots of calcium there's

298
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,760
calcium in the foods you're eating that

299
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,360
calcium is floating around your

300
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,079
bloodstream you might be somebody that

301
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,440
takes a calcium supplement maybe you got

302
00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:06,800
some of that floating around your

303
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,920
bloodstream that's not exactly the same

304
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,279
but the point is is we have calcium from

305
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,120
the foods we eat that are floating

306
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:13,680
around our bloodstream and guess what

307
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:16,519
happens the minute you drop in that

308
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:19,680
acetic acid right off the running that

309
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:23,480
calcium is used up fast it's used up

310
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:25,680
that hour that hour I'm going to take my

311
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,760
apple cider vinegar shots because I

312
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,600
heard on Tik Tock it's a great thing to

313
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,800
do let me go keep doing it there and

314
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,360
then you're losing all of your calcium

315
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,959
that's in your bloodstream in that

316
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,519
moment and not only do you lose the

317
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:40,160
calcium that's in the bloodstream in

318
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:43,680
that moment but you start losing calcium

319
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:45,000
out of the bones and teeth you guys in

320
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,720
that

321
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,000
moment not next

322
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:54,440
year in that moment you're losing

323
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:58,399
calcium out of your bones and

324
00:12:54,440 --> 00:13:01,240
teeth calcium is there to neutralize the

325
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:03,760
AC IC acid it doesn't do a great

326
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:07,040
job but the calcium's there to

327
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:10,000
neutralize the acetic acid so your bones

328
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:12,279
and teeth don't fall apart too quick but

329
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,560
they still fall apart over time let's go

330
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:15,560
into drum

331
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:23,440
roll we

332
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,440
got

333
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:27,760
chocolate we

334
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,560
got

335
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,680
caffeine

336
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:37,120
caffeina we got

337
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:39,320
chocolate Okay caffeine that's a big one

338
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,880
that hurts the teeth too teeth

339
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:43,800
destroying diets well I'm on this great

340
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,920
diet it's really good it's this keto

341
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,639
diet it's really cool it's a keto diet

342
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,399
it's got some it's got a little bit of

343
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:51,240
fruit and some lots of vegetables in

344
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:54,079
there it's good yeah know I have my

345
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:56,560
cacao I do have my cow I really like it

346
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:59,199
and that's good there I do have my

347
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,880
chocolate that's in my diet you know you

348
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,600
got to have balance you got to have

349
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,600
moderation and

350
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:10,560
balance but your teeth are going to

351
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:12,120
suffer they just are I'm not trying to

352
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,360
just be like you guys look I want to

353
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,199
make your lives miserable today I want

354
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,079
to tell you about caffeine and chocolate

355
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:19,240
cuz you guys are most most everybody's

356
00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:24,240
on it I'm sure some of you guys aren't

357
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:27,160
right but I just think it's this if you

358
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:30,320
know what causes teeth problems and you

359
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:32,639
learn and you still do it I don't know

360
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,920
what to say just when the teeth are

361
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,680
falling apart and you're getting more

362
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,079
root canals and you're getting more

363
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,480
teeth work and more cavities filled and

364
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,120
your gums are getting that plaque

365
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,199
underneath the

366
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,800
teeth just

367
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:48,720
know some of the causes to begin with

368
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,360
okay so a lot of people think

369
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,240
chocolate's healthy chocolate's good for

370
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,040
you because we're taught that we're high

371
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:57,279
on chocolate we're high in the caffeine

372
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,639
life's hard we need that rush we need

373
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:02,079
that coffee we need that CA c in there

374
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:05,560
coffee is so acidic it's another teeth

375
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:07,680
destroyer from the inside out so when it

376
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:10,519
comes down to coffee it's a little

377
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,920
different than acetic acid coffee

378
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:16,000
happens to be extremely acidic what it

379
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:19,320
does is it kills those those um adrenal

380
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,639
glands it kills your stomach glands it

381
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:25,440
starts to actually cause problems

382
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:27,639
deficits in those glands your adrenal

383
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,440
glands and your stomach glands both

384
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:32,000
those believe it or not do help and

385
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,800
protect your teeth over time but what we

386
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,920
do is we drink coffee every single day

387
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:40,399
not only is the cdic nature of coffee

388
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:42,279
really harsh on enamel do you ever hear

389
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,000
about coffee stains right coffee stains

390
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:46,600
coffee stains are different than if you

391
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,079
eat a whole thing of

392
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:51,079
blueberries blueberries that's a pigment

393
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:52,480
that's anthocyan in that gets into the

394
00:15:51,079 --> 00:15:54,040
teeth sometimes you're eating a hole

395
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,720
you're eating all these blueberries

396
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:58,079
right blueberries blueberries

397
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:01,720
blueberries that's different than coffee

398
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:03,800
stains coffee stains coffee stains what

399
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:06,839
you'll notice today in today's world is

400
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:10,040
a lot different than back in the 80s in

401
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:11,199
the 70s and '90s where everybody's teeth

402
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:15,519
were just

403
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:17,680
yellow just yellow you see people on

404
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,199
talk shows in the 1980s their teeth were

405
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,399
all

406
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,720
yellow even they they're using white

407
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:24,920
strips everybody had white strips in

408
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,000
their mouth everybody in the

409
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:29,040
professional you know public figure

410
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,120
Arena all had white stripss their mouth

411
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,240
every single day they did they were

412
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,480
living on White Strips on their teeth

413
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,000
but their teeth were all yellow you see

414
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:40,600
a

415
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:44,480
concert even like you see a you you see

416
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:46,240
a theater or concert program and you see

417
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,160
people in the front in the 1980s and you

418
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,040
see them all their teeth are just

419
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,360
doesn't matter what age they were 25

420
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,839
years old 28 years old 32 years old

421
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,279
their teeth were just all

422
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,759
yellow right so we're in a place where

423
00:16:56,279 --> 00:17:02,040
there's so many cosmetic approaches es

424
00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:04,799
on teeth between veneers and whitening

425
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:06,480
strategies that people have and getting

426
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:08,400
you know implants and so forth and

427
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,079
Replacements and everything else so all

428
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,199
of that is kind of like putting that old

429
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:14,439
Decor of what happened years ago and

430
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,720
yester year with

431
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:18,439
teeth okay but if you go back and you

432
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,199
see some old footage and you're just

433
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:25,720
like everybody's smiling laughing you go

434
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:27,720
back to an old Oscars back in the 1979

435
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,960
and you see footage of like the Oscars

436
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,799
in 79

437
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,200
84

438
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,960
1985 all the celebrities her teeth are

439
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,400
all

440
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:40,200
yellow that's what it was like back then

441
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:43,559
right before what we have now out

442
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:45,760
there but it doesn't change what's

443
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:48,280
happening inside of the teeth it doesn't

444
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:51,320
change what's happening inside the

445
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:53,919
Denton it does not change what's

446
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:57,039
happening inside the

447
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,960
enamel so right now we're in the world

448
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,960
just like the world of the past we're in

449
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,520
the teeth destroying world the only

450
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,280
difference is we're probably doing even

451
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,840
more vinegar cuz we're doing more apple

452
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:08,200
cider vinegar probably doing more

453
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:11,400
caffeine than we ever did 20 30 40 years

454
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:14,000
ago and decaf coffee is in the same

455
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:16,640
league it just has a little less

456
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,679
caffeine a little less caffeine and

457
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,159
guess what the crazy things most decaf

458
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:23,360
drinkers maybe not you but most decaf

459
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:26,960
drinkers drink more of

460
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:29,000
it they drink more of it they supersede

461
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,080
someone else who has a little bit higher

462
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,280
caffeine in a cup of coffee a decaf

463
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,480
Drinker would be like I'm going to drink

464
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:36,480
four

465
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:38,360
today because I can because it's less

466
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,080
caffeine so they drink four cups of

467
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:42,400
coffee when someone else is drinking one

468
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,679
to two cups a day with the higher amount

469
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,360
person drinks four or five of the

470
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:50,520
decaffinated is like surpassing the

471
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:52,080
person with the not decaffinated right

472
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:55,919
caffeinated right so here we go people

473
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:58,400
drink matcha they drink tea they drink

474
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:00,120
soda they drink energy drinks they they

475
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,960
drink all those things too getting all

476
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:04,720
the caffeine with that but

477
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:07,159
decaf still is a problem very important

478
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:10,320
to know I want to go into like root

479
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:11,679
canals a little bit too in this episode

480
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,440
I'm going to cook for us in a little bit

481
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,480
if you guys just got here we're doing

482
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,559
asparagus Sushi is what we're doing I'm

483
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:22,320
excited about this Claudia Draper yep my

484
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:26,919
teeth were all yellow and same with

485
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:29,200
everyone else I knew that was the world

486
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:32,480
of yester year

487
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,880
so Amanda says that's amazing my dad is

488
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,799
losing his teeth they're just falling

489
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:42,240
apart it's like a time capsule is what

490
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:45,760
it is it's time capsule a time capsule

491
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:48,159
that just starts to ring the bell it's

492
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,760
kind of like on the ranch everybody's

493
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:53,280
working out there right everybody gets

494
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:55,120
hungry it's lunchtime ding ding ding

495
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,600
ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding

496
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,400
ding time to eat lunch ding ding ding

497
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:02,320
ding

498
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:05,960
the alarm goes off and what happens over

499
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:08,360
time the alarm goes off and the teeth

500
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:10,240
just start falling apart different areas

501
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:12,880
of the mouth too sometimes it's a

502
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:16,720
certain area of the mouth versus

503
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:19,000
another and sometimes it's everywhere in

504
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,799
the mouth starts you just falling apart

505
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,880
like

506
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:24,559
crazy

507
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:27,280
everywhere important to know so let's go

508
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:29,720
into bacteria a little bit so that's the

509
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,679
next thing we want to do

510
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:35,520
it's okay

511
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:37,200
bacteria you have to have bacteria to

512
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:40,360
have a

513
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:43,400
cavity you have to have

514
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:46,440
bacteria to have gum

515
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:49,919
disease you got to have

516
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:54,480
bacteria to have you guessed it root

517
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:56,760
canals well infected abscess

518
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,200
Roots

519
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:02,120
bacteria and at leads us to the next

520
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:06,280
place how does bacteria somehow get down

521
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:07,919
in there deep when there isn't cavities

522
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,799
and then where when there are cavities

523
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:12,000
and so forth but how do we get bacteria

524
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:14,559
down there deep in the roots because of

525
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,559
our immune system our immune system is

526
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:21,039
struggling we got zinc deficiencies

527
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:24,559
Galore zinc deficiencies are rampant all

528
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:26,440
around the world everywhere and that's a

529
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:29,720
problem all on its

530
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:31,840
own our immune systems are

531
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:34,760
compromised therefore we get in trouble

532
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:36,120
with teeth problems the more viruses we

533
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:39,120
have in our

534
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:42,159
life the more

535
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:46,600
bacteria the weaker the immune

536
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:48,520
system autoimmune so forth neurological

537
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,840
problems usually people with multiple

538
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:53,520
sceris suffer with their teeth the most

539
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:55,240
usually not every exact person there

540
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,720
reasons why there's different situations

541
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,720
versus how many heavy metals somebody

542
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,320
has how many toxic heavy metals and so

543
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,000
forth and different toxins with

544
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:06,799
viruses but the point is compromised

545
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
immune system leads to the bacteria

546
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:11,840
frenzy in the

547
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:15,600
mouth that's why the medical medium

548
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:20,320
information which I proudly

549
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:22,200
follow which at my age I have all my

550
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:26,159
teeth and no

551
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:29,520
problems which no implants no veneers no

552
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:31,679
root canals you name

553
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:35,240
it

554
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:36,640
right the goal is like when I take care

555
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,000
of myself the best I can because

556
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,120
honestly I'm not perfect at taking care

557
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,960
of myself at

558
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:45,320
all but I try my best in the sense where

559
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:48,640
I work myself to the Bone I burn the

560
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:52,600
candle at four ends I drive myself into

561
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:54,880
the ground I wouldn't recommend that for

562
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:57,720
anybody it's a bad

563
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:00,679
habit s and I started from the beginning

564
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:02,279
so so here's the thing okay when we get

565
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:03,880
a compromised immune system and our

566
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:06,039
immune system gets weakened we get more

567
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:07,799
teeth problems because we have an immune

568
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:09,520
system that's struggling it's trying to

569
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:11,799
fight and battle different things like

570
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,640
viruses and bacteria a lot of people

571
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:17,880
have multiple varieties of strep and

572
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:19,799
they have viruses like hhv6 and shingles

573
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:22,080
and Epstein bar even if they just have

574
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:25,440
an Epstein bar that's causing problems

575
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:28,600
their immune system cannot keep a tight

576
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:31,279
watch on the teeth and the gum so the

577
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:34,840
immune system cannot keep a really close

578
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:38,240
tight watch on the gums your immune

579
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:42,799
cells want to capture viruses and

580
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:45,600
bacteria on the gum line inside the gums

581
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:50,640
and behind the teeth in the

582
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:54,679
jaw our immune system wants to capture

583
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:56,559
Invaders pathogens viruses bacteria but

584
00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:58,559
our immune systems are usually dealing

585
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,840
with other problems

586
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,480
other things that we're actually having

587
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:04,080
inside our body our immune systems

588
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,880
dealing with a lot of different viruses

589
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,159
and

590
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:10,240
bacteria people who have simplex one

591
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:12,760
Simplex 2 different varieties of epine

592
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:15,039
bar cyega virus is a pain in the butt

593
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:19,440
and a lot of shingles viruses these are

594
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:22,840
the autoimmune plague that's the

595
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,799
autoimmune plague aroni is all those

596
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:27,039
different bugs and

597
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,720
pathogens and so our immune system is

598
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,480
really busy on trying to protect us with

599
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,960
all that and at the same time our immune

600
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:35,120
system can't go and then take care of

601
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,960
the teeth and gums it can't go and take

602
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:40,600
care of everything here it just can't

603
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:42,919
our immune system wants to help it wants

604
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:45,039
to take care of things but it just can't

605
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:49,279
cover every single tooth in every part

606
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:51,480
of your gum there's no way it can only

607
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:54,080
get some of it at different times some

608
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,480
of it at different times so taking care

609
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,159
of our immune system is critical

610
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:00,520
learning why we're sick is critical it

611
00:24:57,159 --> 00:25:02,360
protects our teeth and then if you got

612
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:05,120
somebody who's compromised and they're

613
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:08,080
chronically sick you guys they're also

614
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:11,080
doing chocolate they got the caffeine

615
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:13,080
cranking in their system chocolate wears

616
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:14,279
away your calcium reserves chocolate's

617
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,240
another thing that breaks down your

618
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:17,360
calcium

619
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:19,520
reserves it breaks down your immune

620
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:22,600
system I can't tell you how many time

621
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:25,240
over how many times over the years

622
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:27,320
helping out people all these decades did

623
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:31,320
I see when someone went on a chocolate

624
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:34,640
bin they broke out a week later with a

625
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:37,760
Simplex cold sore fever blister

626
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:40,240
chocolate binge fever blister if they

627
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:43,000
didn't have herpy simplex one chocolate

628
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,600
binge Simplex 2 if if that's what they

629
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,840
had

630
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:52,440
PS in the genitals area right if they

631
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:55,440
didn't have that chocolate binge okay so

632
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:59,559
chocolate binge and

633
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:01,880
then a a flare for Epstein bar chocolate

634
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:03,320
binge and then a new bout of mono

635
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:07,440
chocolate

636
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:09,559
binge and then an abscess in the tooth

637
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,720
jaw starts to

638
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:15,600
hurt chocolate

639
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:18,159
binge and then catching an STD

640
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:20,279
easily when they probably wouldn't have

641
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:23,520
really caught it cuz their immune system

642
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:25,960
would have pulverized Gara would have

643
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:28,279
pulverized the clap would have

644
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:29,520
pulverized it there means system didn't

645
00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:32,279
pulverize

646
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:34,919
it so now they got

647
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:36,880
chlamidia they got chlamydia and their

648
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:38,840
immune system can't keep up with the

649
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,600
chlamydia they just contracted in a

650
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:43,200
relationship because their immune

651
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:46,279
systems bombarded by chocolate binge and

652
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:50,440
stuff like that and other

653
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:54,200
things the point is is that our immune

654
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:56,559
system can only do so much when we tip

655
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:58,279
the scale and death by a Thousand Cuts

656
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:59,760
and we push things over The Edge it's

657
00:26:58,279 --> 00:27:02,679
not our fault it's nobody's fault it's a

658
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,679
hard World hard

659
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,480
life but there's a real reason why

660
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:10,399
people's teeth just start falling apart

661
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,000
over time we have a lot of compromises

662
00:27:10,399 --> 00:27:14,880
our immune system is actually looking

663
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,880
out for so let's go into root canals a

664
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,799
touch

665
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:23,159
vegans are in the

666
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:26,520
dentist but so are animal protein people

667
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:29,600
if I hear one more

668
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:33,520
time that a vegan is going to be in the

669
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:36,000
dentist chair more that vegans need

670
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:40,039
dental work

671
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,960
more the next live we do I'm GNA ask

672
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:45,640
Samantha the the

673
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,399
dietician to come on and talk about that

674
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:50,720
topic the next time we're live I'm going

675
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:52,919
to have Samantha come on you guys know

676
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,720
you guys just met Samantha recently

677
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:58,080
she's going to come on and talk about

678
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:01,360
that like vegans and

679
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,360
dentist chairs and stuff like

680
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:09,880
that you know why people go vegan and go

681
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:12,720
plant-based because they got sick

682
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:15,559
outside of a handful of hippies that are

683
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,919
trying to protect animals which I

684
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:19,880
believe

685
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:21,799
in I believe in

686
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:25,360
immensely

687
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:28,200
outside of a few people that don't want

688
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,399
to actually drink C's milk because of

689
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:32,120
you know they're worried about the abuse

690
00:28:29,399 --> 00:28:34,039
on the cow don't eat meat cuz they don't

691
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:35,360
want to kill the cow cuz cow has a soul

692
00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:38,360
we know that right and this isn't a

693
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:40,559
vegan Channel propaganda or animal

694
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:43,200
protein Channel propaganda I'm trying to

695
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:45,640
say something really important here

696
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:50,000
outside of a few vegans that decided to

697
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:50,000
go vegan because of a certain

698
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:55,279
belief outside of that vegans go vegan

699
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:58,799
because something's wrong with their

700
00:28:55,279 --> 00:29:01,200
health and they get sick that's what

701
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:04,360
happens plant-based people go

702
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:06,640
plant-based because they get

703
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:09,960
sick

704
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:13,080
fact and

705
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:15,720
Truth vegans go vegan plantbased people

706
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:18,559
go macrobiotic people went macrobiotic

707
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:21,399
years ago because they got

708
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:24,080
sick pescatarians went pescatarian

709
00:29:21,399 --> 00:29:24,080
because they got

710
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:31,279
sick what it means is if vegans are more

711
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:33,480
deficient and end up in a dentist chair

712
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:35,480
they were sick to be they were sick

713
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,919
animal protein

714
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:39,799
eaters doesn't mean animal animal

715
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,559
protein caused them to be sick they were

716
00:29:39,799 --> 00:29:43,960
sick Pro animal protein eaters and this

717
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:46,039
is this is a Nuance it doesn't mean the

718
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:48,799
animal protein caused them to be sick

719
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:51,440
it's not what I'm trying to say I'm

720
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:53,320
saying they were already sick and they

721
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,000
were already sick animal protein eaters

722
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:57,840
they were already sick Animal product

723
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,760
eaters and they became vegan

724
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:04,320
vegetarian macrobiotic pescatarian

725
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:07,240
eating a few fish whatever it

726
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:10,200
is they became these things because

727
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:12,840
something was wrong something was wrong

728
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:15,279
unless it's some like hippie dude that's

729
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:17,559
like no killing animals is wrong I will

730
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:19,159
not I will eat soy and everything else

731
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:22,840
I'm going to be vegan unless it's

732
00:30:19,159 --> 00:30:24,600
somebody like that everybody's going to

733
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:26,240
a different diet like that because

734
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:29,919
they're not

735
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:32,799
well and the bottom line is everybody's

736
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:34,840
in the dental chair everybody's at the

737
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:36,840
dentist office everybody's getting

738
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:38,720
drilled everybody has a problem with

739
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:41,519
their teeth at one time or another one

740
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:44,039
way or another and the roots of the

741
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:45,600
teeth problems or mineral deficiencies

742
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:47,760
that I'm talking about like the Calcium

743
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,320
deficiency from it being leaked from our

744
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:52,000
bones and

745
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:53,840
teeth along with coming into this world

746
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,960
with immune system issues and

747
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:59,360
deficiencies Along With viral issues to

748
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,960
like pathogens and so forth along with

749
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:04,440
toxic heavy metals Mercury is like the

750
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:06,760
teeth Destroyer I'm not talking about

751
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:09,279
just Mercury amalgams I'm talking about

752
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:11,679
Mercury in our body in our bloodstream

753
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:13,519
or Mercury in our organs and not even in

754
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,559
our bloodstream Mercury and our organs

755
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:17,039
which is a medical medium piece of

756
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:19,320
information all on its

757
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:20,760
own Mercury actually in organs

758
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,760
undetected that's medical medium

759
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:24,519
originally and then Mercury in our bones

760
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:26,159
which is which is medical medium to

761
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:28,000
information I have to say that because

762
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:32,080
you be like oh I heard that before it

763
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,080
comes from mm info so you know where the

764
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,639
source is but the bottom line is you

765
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:39,399
guys I'm trying to say

766
00:31:35,639 --> 00:31:41,639
something something that's really really

767
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:42,960
important is that there are so many

768
00:31:41,639 --> 00:31:44,760
different angles we can do to protect

769
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,159
your teeth down from the basic First

770
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:49,159
Fundamental options right down to going

771
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:50,760
as far as we want to protect our teeth

772
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:53,320
and the first thing I would tell anybody

773
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:55,320
right off the running hey a w I want to

774
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:57,000
I want to keep my teeth I want I don't

775
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:58,840
want teeth problems every minute I want

776
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:03,000
my my teeth would be okay boom vinegar

777
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:08,279
gone boom chocolate boom gone

778
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:10,600
woo just gone coffee Bing

779
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:12,080
gone that's just a few things right off

780
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,519
the running then I would go even deeper

781
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:17,120
than

782
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:18,240
that deeper than that eggs boom gone

783
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,639
because the eggs are going to feed all

784
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,559
the viruses in your body and that's

785
00:32:19,639 --> 00:32:23,200
going to compromise your immune system

786
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:25,320
and when that compromises your immune

787
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,399
system who's going to be watching over

788
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:28,919
your teeth and that's another thing oh

789
00:32:27,399 --> 00:32:30,480
and its own I was talking about before

790
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:33,080
who is going to be watching over your

791
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:36,200
teeth when your body your immune system

792
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:38,519
is watching over

793
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:42,120
pathogens pathogens that are feeding off

794
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:44,360
of eggs and dairy products and

795
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:45,399
gluten next thing IID tell people is get

796
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,399
rid of the

797
00:32:45,399 --> 00:32:48,960
gluten not because the person's

798
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:50,760
sensitive or not to gluten that's not

799
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,159
what it would be no you want teeth

800
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:55,360
problems to be gone someday or you want

801
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:57,639
them slowed down and you want them

802
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:59,960
halted you also get rid rid of gluten

803
00:32:57,639 --> 00:33:03,440
too cuz gluten is going to feed bacteria

804
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:07,840
guess what that bacteria that sits in

805
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:11,679
there eating away your root in your

806
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:14,399
teeth feeds off of

807
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:17,760
gluten so there's your root right there

808
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:19,120
you see it you guys see your root we're

809
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:22,399
going to do we're going to do a

810
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:24,720

out here for

816
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:43,279
you anyway the point is is those roots

817
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:47,159
right there that people get bacteria in

818
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:50,279
and around love to feed off of gluten

819
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:52,240
love to feed off of gluten these are

820
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:54,360
just some of the really powerful tidbits

821
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,960
to actually show you guys a lot of

822
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:58,399
people get

823
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:01,039
staining with their

824
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:05,360
enamel it's not just their enamel

825
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:07,559
wearing down but they get stained right

826
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:12,639
like I said 20 30 40 years ago

827
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:16,960
everybody's teeth were yellow just

828
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:21,000
yellow college kids their teeth were

829
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:25,440
yellow high school kids their teeth were

830
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:28,839
yellow it's rare you ever ever ever will

831
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:31,440
know college student with yellow teeth

832
00:34:28,839 --> 00:34:34,280
anymore I'm sure there's some but it's

833
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:36,359
rare they'll go to their dentist they'll

834
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:38,359
do whatever it takes to make

835
00:34:36,359 --> 00:34:40,240
sure right they'll use whatever

836
00:34:38,359 --> 00:34:44,440
procedures they possibly can that did

837
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:47,280
not exist before back in the 80s and

838
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:49,200
90s but yeah everybody's teeth get

839
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,240
stained as well from all their different

840
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,639
habits and then smoking that's another I

841
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:55,639
got to tell you something interesting

842
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,639
right

843
00:34:55,879 --> 00:35:01,599
so what are the top three things that

844
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,440
cause dental

845
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,680
problems like you'll hear out there

846
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,119
there was a dentist out there pretty

847
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:10,760
recently it was just like well tearing

848
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:14,320
open envelopes with your

849
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:15,960
teeth tearing open EV envelopes the

850
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,240
dentist didn't say about calcium

851
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:20,960
depletion because of vinegar the dentist

852
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,920
didn't say anything about minerals Trace

853
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,280
mineral

854
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,720
deficiencies zinc deficiencies the

855
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:27,480
dentist didn't say anything about

856
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:31,119
pathogens and viruses the dentist is

857
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:35,240
like tearing open envelopes with your

858
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:37,200
teeth so doing that that's like tearing

859
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:39,920
open envelopes that's a really good one

860
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:43,839
right there it's like it's like um I am

861
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:45,400
a dentist the top the top three the top

862
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:49,400
five things you should avoid with your

863
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:53,040
teeth one is try not to tear open open

864
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:57,280
the envelopes you're going to ruin your

865
00:35:53,040 --> 00:36:00,240
teeth the second one is don't pop open B

866
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:02,400
bottles with your teeth try not to pop

867
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:06,400
open lids and Bottles your teeth I swear

868
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:08,839
to God I swear to God that's the advice

869
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,560
out there try not to break open bottles

870
00:36:08,839 --> 00:36:13,280
with your teeth yeah cuz that's

871
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:14,880
something I do every day you guys break

872
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,400
open bottles at your teeth bottle caps

873
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,160
all day long is that what you guys do

874
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,880
you do that every day do you tear open

875
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,480
envelopes every day with your teeth how

876
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:24,640
many of you guys tear envelopes open I'm

877
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:28,720
sure somebody does but it's like the top

878
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,720
reasons that's not good for your teeth

879
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,640
all

880
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:43,119
right it's obviously not good for you to

881
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:46,599
pop open a bottle cap off a a beer

882
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:49,079
bottle with your teeth or a soda pop

883
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:52,319
bottle and it's not really smart to

884
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:55,480
actually open up a can a bear

885
00:36:52,319 --> 00:36:57,599
can a bear can with your teeth and try

886
00:36:55,480 --> 00:37:00,680
to rip it open

887
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:02,480
and it's not smart to tear open

888
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:05,800
envelopes or anything else with your

889
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:07,520
teeth it's a duh it's a duh but what

890
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,160
about the real reasons why people's

891
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:12,480
teeth are falling

892
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:15,319
out if I hear another time out there

893
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:17,000
that it's because of being vegan and

894
00:37:15,319 --> 00:37:21,520
your teeth fall apart because you're

895
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:23,839
vegan that is so grossly

896
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:27,359
mistaken not only are vegans in the

897
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:31,920
dental chairs the dentist office so is

898
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:34,079
every single animal protein eater that's

899
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:37,520
a major

900
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:39,319
ignorance that is a major cross theboard

901
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,839
ignorance to actually think that

902
00:37:39,319 --> 00:37:45,000
plant-based people or a vegan ends up in

903
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:47,040
a dental chair more than a meat eater

904
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,640
probably the dumbest thing I've heard

905
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:52,880
out there it's ignorance

906
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:55,599
pure it's sad but it's said constantly

907
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:58,560
out there over and over and over again

908
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:01,920
everybody everybody is getting their

909
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:06,200
teeth drilled and if they haven't

910
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:09,240
already they're going to because even if

911
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:10,839
someone seems indestructible they're

912
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:13,400
exercising they look like they're in

913
00:38:10,839 --> 00:38:14,920
great shape they got it they're young

914
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,480
their teeth look good they're getting

915
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:19,160
they're going to their dentist I got all

916
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:22,400
my original teeth I'm 22 years old I'm

917
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:24,280
exercising I'm doing good uh it's all

918
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,119
going to fall apart later even if it

919
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:28,520
takes to their 39 years old and it just

920
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:30,160
starts to fall apart and crumble all

921
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:31,440
then fraction of the people on the

922
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:34,040
planet are vegan by the way or

923
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:38,920
plant-based a fraction it's a grain of

924
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:42,839
rice to a silo of rice a grain of rice

925
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:45,800
to a silo of rice meaning the grain of

926
00:38:42,839 --> 00:38:48,480
rice is the vegan and The Silo of rice

927
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:50,599
are the Animal product

928
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,119
eaters and the reason why they're vegan

929
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:54,800
to begin with is because they have

930
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:56,640
symptoms and conditions in most cases

931
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:59,040
except for that random person that's

932
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,599
like you know what they're chopping down

933
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,560
the

934
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:05,240
rainforest they're doing all kinds of

935
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:07,240
stuff and I want to be vegan Jasmine

936
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:10,960
over there on YouTube says my teeth are

937
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:13,880
falling apart and I'm only 23 I had

938
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:16,640
cavities on almost all of my teeth by

939
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:18,920
the time I was 20 I got them all done

940
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:21,440
but now they're back

941
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:23,440
again I've seen this happen a lot over

942
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:25,240
the years with a lot of young people we

943
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,280
come into the world with a little bit

944
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,960
higher elevations of mercury into toxic

945
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,880
heavy metals I mean ask your dentist

946
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:34,440
what's right for you ask him what you

947
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:36,760
know he thinks but what I've said about

948
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:39,119
younger Generations having teeth

949
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:41,240
problems there's either immune system

950
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:43,359
issues where they're battling some

951
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:45,119
lowgrade pathogenic infections that

952
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:47,960
happens a lot they have an elevated

953
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:50,599
toxic heavy metal Reserve inside organs

954
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:52,200
that happens a lot too and they're Trace

955
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:55,720
mineral

956
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:57,000
deficient and they're extremely acidic

957
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:59,680
or

958
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,960
it didn't take well like the vinegar and

959
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:03,200
all the different things that they've

960
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:05,839
been actually eating in their foods from

961
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:07,839
meals out from eating out from when they

962
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:09,960
were like 5 6 7even years old of the

963
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:12,720
family and 10 years old and 15 years old

964
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:14,400
and you know and so forth and it was

965
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,720
just you know restaurant food's a big

966
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,400
one right there for actually taking

967
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:20,119
people out you can be somebody that's

968
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,200
plant-based and you're in the finest

969
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:24,800
plantbased restaurant you're in Europe

970
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:27,240
and you found this wicked bitching cool

971
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:29,440
plant-based restaurant and you're in

972
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:31,400
there and you're having vinegar and

973
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:34,640
everything else another thing is

974
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:37,319
fluoride treatments it is by far one of

975
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:39,119
the teeth destroyers of all is fluoride

976
00:40:37,319 --> 00:40:41,240
treatments something that people don't

977
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:44,040
realize right is when they get a

978
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:46,319
fluoride treatment in the past it causes

979
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:48,480
damage in the future so a lot of

980
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:49,839
children get their fluoride treatments

981
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,000
and that fluoride treatment when you're

982
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:53,240
8 years old 9 years old 10 years old

983
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,119
means you're going to have teeth

984
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:58,200
problems when you're 20 25 30 and so

985
00:40:56,119 --> 00:41:01,119
forth forth so fluoride treatments is a

986
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:05,319
big deal that's another one that eats

987
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:07,839
away at the enamel and also affects the

988
00:41:05,319 --> 00:41:09,760
teeth from the inside out is

989
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:10,960
fluoride going to start cooking in a

990
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:14,520
minute you guys we're covering some

991
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:16,240
teeth stuff on its own healing single

992
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:18,359
over there in IG says I have a broken

993
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:21,680
tooth my dentist wants to pull and

994
00:41:18,359 --> 00:41:25,240
replace with an implant I wonder if it's

995
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:27,480
worth it since tooth the tooth is in the

996
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:30,079
back

997
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:31,760
so I mean it look it all depends on what

998
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:33,760
your dentist wants to do if I ever had a

999
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:38,520
broken tooth in the

1000
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:41,880
back you know I would I would avoid the

1001
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:44,560
implant I would avoid it and try to seek

1002
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:47,839
out every option possible also would

1003
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:49,680
seek out a see a few different dentists

1004
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:52,280
about the same topic that's what I would

1005
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:54,119
do I'd go to this dentist I'd go to that

1006
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:55,720
dentist I'd say okay what do you think

1007
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:58,960
do I need to just do is there another

1008
00:41:55,720 --> 00:42:01,480
route I can do is it possible to fill it

1009
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:04,599
is the tooth cracked all the way

1010
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:06,599
through a root canal won't work a crown

1011
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:08,319
won't be sufficient do I just need an

1012
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:09,839
implant or I just pull the tooth these

1013
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:12,319
are all questions that you have to kind

1014
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:13,920
of obviously go along with with your

1015
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:16,160
your

1016
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,599
dentist or do you want to just pull the

1017
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,920
tooth and let it heal up and you're

1018
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:20,599
missing a tooth because you don't want

1019
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:22,480
to implant so many things you know

1020
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:25,000
there's so many options Divine Light

1021
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:26,880
says Anthony what does Spirit say is it

1022
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,520
okay to not go do anything anything to

1023
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:31,880
cavities should we always go get them

1024
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:33,280
fixed or is it fine to let them be the

1025
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:36,200
only thing

1026
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:37,960
is if you're battling pathogens your

1027
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:41,040
immune system's compromised you got

1028
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:43,920
bacteria in the mouth that's lit it's

1029
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:47,000
lit right and that bacteria is working

1030
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,119
on your teeth okay and you're taking

1031
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,200
care of yourself and you're trying to

1032
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:51,160
fix other problems it's hard sometimes

1033
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:54,559
to get the

1034
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:55,760
teeth up to par fast enough so you got

1035
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:57,119
to keep an eye on the cavities that's

1036
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,599
what I would do to keep an eye on them

1037
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:02,760
if they start they start doing more they

1038
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:04,319
start getting away from us then that's

1039
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:06,400
another story so you might want to keep

1040
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:07,880
on it that way but if it doesn't look

1041
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,640
like it's getting away from us that's

1042
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:11,960
another story I mean I have friends that

1043
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,040
they have cavities and stuff and they

1044
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:15,160
don't do anything with them because

1045
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,680
you're not getting away from them but

1046
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:18,160
there's different ways of handling it as

1047
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,480
you're building up your immune system as

1048
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:22,000
you're cleaning things out as you're

1049
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:23,480
avoiding all the bad stuff and the

1050
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,960
vinegars and everything else you're

1051
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:27,720
building up your calcium reserves in

1052
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:29,640
your teeth you're doing all that

1053
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:31,800
cavities start going away for a lot of

1054
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:33,400
people what I've noticed medical mem

1055
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:35,200
information I've seen over the years so

1056
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:36,640
many people get rid of cavities your

1057
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:39,160
cavities just healed right up in their

1058
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:41,280
mouths I have friends where they did mm

1059
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:43,720
really good like you know there's people

1060
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,440
that do mm there's people that do mm

1061
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:47,920
there people that do a little bit of mm

1062
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,960
fly on the wall you know like fly on the

1063
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:51,480
wall and you're like whoa why is that

1064
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:53,359
person doing this whoa why is that

1065
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:55,160
person doing Zite that'll really mess

1066
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:57,119
them up why is that person doing that

1067
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:58,599
why is the person doing dite clay that's

1068
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:00,280
not going to be good for them why is

1069
00:43:58,599 --> 00:44:01,559
that person doing Pearl powder that's

1070
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:03,079
going to really rip their intestinal

1071
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:04,880
track apart so it's like you're seeing

1072
00:44:03,079 --> 00:44:06,960
all the things they're doing why is that

1073
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:09,880
person doing sodium bicarbonate why is

1074
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:12,240
that person taking so much like crappy

1075
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:14,440
powders that have all these agents in

1076
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:16,160
them like you see all these things and

1077
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:18,440
why is that person eating this why are

1078
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:20,240
they eating that and then you know you

1079
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:22,880
know you know as all that's happening in

1080
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:24,119
there and they having all these problems

1081
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,400
problems are going to develop and

1082
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:27,760
everything but then there's people who

1083
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:29,160
do who and they'll do a little bit of mm

1084
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,960
they'll do some celery juice to do a

1085
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:32,720
little of this maybe do the heavy metal

1086
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,319
detox once in a while but they don't

1087
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:37,480
really do mm a lot they don't do a lot

1088
00:44:35,319 --> 00:44:40,480
of mm their teeth start falling apart

1089
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:42,800
later and the easiest claim is like it's

1090
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:44,440
got to be mm that did it it's got to be

1091
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:47,720
that celery juice meanwhile what they

1092
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:50,480
were doing and what they had going on

1093
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:52,280
was like whoa that's not mm oh that's

1094
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,760
not mm you walk into their house and you

1095
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:55,960

not eating enough greens not a lot of

people stay low fat enough they're

1113
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:29,760
eating so much fats bacteria is

1114
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:33,119
proliferating let's go into that real

1115
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:35,760
quick that's a good one

1116
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:37,920
okay all right stomach and ol liver

1117
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:41,240
right here in my

1118
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,640
hand right A lot of people are eating so

1119
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:45,680
much fat they're blowing out their

1120
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:47,599
livers high fat diets every single day

1121
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:50,079
they can't stay away from the fat they

1122
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:51,359
can't even back it down a little bit

1123
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:52,680
even if they're like intermittent

1124
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:54,760
fasting or something like that which

1125
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:56,680
isn't medical medium even if they're

1126
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:58,680
intermittent fasting and by the end of

1127
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:01,920
the day they eat one meal they blow it

1128
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:06,400
out usually with a lot of fat so many

1129
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:09,640
people cheese butter eggs meat chicken

1130
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:11,720
too much avocado too much too much nuts

1131
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:14,160
too much seeds too much though too much

1132
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:15,960
chocolate too many oils and they're just

1133
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:19,240
blowing too much oil and they're blowing

1134
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:21,119
out their liver and their their stomach

1135
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:23,520
right and when they're when they're

1136
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:25,200
dealing with that what happens is their

1137
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:27,040
immune system can't keep track of the

1138
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:29,760
bacteria

1139
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:31,920
the bacteria starts to get out of

1140
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:33,480
control and when that bacteria starts

1141
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:35,680
getting out of control we get gum

1142
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:38,359
problems we get you know abscesses we

1143
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:40,200
get teeth problems we get all kinds of

1144
00:46:38,359 --> 00:46:43,480
issues with

1145
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:45,960
cavities you can't control the bacteria

1146
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:48,720
in your mouth that's sitting on a cavity

1147
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:51,559
or creating a cavity should I

1148
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:53,160
say when we're dumping in so much fat in

1149
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:55,280
our diet so there's a lot of people that

1150
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:56,839
do medical medium to some degree but

1151
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,680
they still pound the fats because they

1152
00:46:56,839 --> 00:47:00,280
go somewhere else and they hear fats are

1153
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:01,680
so good for you you should be on lots of

1154
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:04,480
fats and now they're on lots of fats but

1155
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:06,040
they still like medical medium stuff and

1156
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,599
then there's people that are just like

1157
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:09,480
they're just they're dabbling in medical

1158
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:11,440
medium but their teeth just start over

1159
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:14,480
the years falling apart but they love

1160
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:17,240
the medical medium stuff they might like

1161
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:19,839

important beatric

1398
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:06,680
says that some people get problems with

1399
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:08,720
their teeth with the medical medum diet

1400
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:10,799
and others have great teeth could it be

1401
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:12,799
due to the quality of the teeth when

1402
00:58:10,799 --> 00:58:13,880
they were formed while lying in the

1403
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:16,960
mother's

1404
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:18,280
womb well first of all you don't know

1405
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:19,599
what they're actually doing a lot of

1406
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:21,799
people do medical Medium say they do

1407
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:23,680
medical medium and they really weren't

1408
00:58:21,799 --> 00:58:26,160
doing a lot of medical medium they were

1409
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:27,760
doing teeth destroy in their diet they

1410
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:29,319
had a lot of teeth destroyers in their

1411
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:30,880
diet they had a lot of mineral

1412
00:58:29,319 --> 00:58:33,160
deficiency problems because of what

1413
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:34,599
they're eating and doing they had a lot

1414
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:36,480
you know a lot of other problems going

1415
00:58:34,599 --> 00:58:39,319
on that we covered in this whole episode

1416
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:42,079
keep that in mind so it's it's hard to

1417
00:58:39,319 --> 00:58:43,680
say because I've heard people say

1418
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:47,400
they've done medical medium it's caused

1419
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:49,400
teeth problems and I know for a fact

1420
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:51,680
through

1421
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:56,720
evidence that they weren't doing medical

1422
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:56,720
media breaks my heart

1423
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:06,680
they were dabbling in medical

1424
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:10,280
medium they were dabbling in medical

1425
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:12,079
medium I'm not judging anybody for

1426
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:15,520
dabbling in medical

1427
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:21,000
medium I'm happy to have dabblers here I

1428
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:23,880
want dabblers here just try not to blame

1429
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:25,599
the wrong thing because you're a dabbler

1430
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:28,039
please if you

1431
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:30,119
in and it depends on the past what they

1432
00:59:28,039 --> 00:59:32,520
were doing what they were eating teeth

1433
00:59:30,119 --> 00:59:36,240
are like time capsules I just actually I

1434
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:38,839
was telling you guys they're time

1435
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:42,200
capsules is what they're are keep in

1436
00:59:38,839 --> 00:59:46,160
mind that's very important to

1437
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:50,839
know okay

1438
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:55,039
teeth tell a story a story of the

1439
00:59:50,839 --> 01:00:00,359
past coffee green tea energy drink

1440
00:59:55,039 --> 01:00:04,119
drinks chocolate vinegar eggs dairy

1441
01:00:00,359 --> 01:00:06,039
products teeth tell a story of the past

1442
01:00:04,119 --> 01:00:08,680
and then you come and you do medical

1443
01:00:06,039 --> 01:00:10,799
medium but you have the baggage of the

1444
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:14,160
past and your teeth for the last 20

1445
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:16,839
years were're already becoming weakened

1446
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:18,839
internally inside out yes and also in

1447
01:00:16,839 --> 01:00:21,880
the womb too some people come into this

1448
01:00:18,839 --> 01:00:26,559
world very deficient high in mercury and

1449
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:26,559
the teeth have problems automatically

1450
01:00:28,839 --> 01:00:34,160
okay so what I'm doing here is I have

1451
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:37,640
sauteed onions if you want to take a

1452
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:40,119
look sauteed garlic in the pan let's

1453

have a lot of Merk this is on IG I have

1642
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:23,040
a lot of mercury amalgam fillings

1643
01:09:20,679 --> 01:09:25,040
amalgam fillings they are in very bad

1644
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:27,199
shape but I still haven't started to

1645
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:29,679
heal can't handle dentist visit

1646
01:09:27,199 --> 01:09:31,480
completely understand is removing them a

1647
01:09:29,679 --> 01:09:33,239
priority in order to get them to stop

1648
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:34,560
decaying look I always tell people I've

1649
01:09:33,239 --> 01:09:36,480
said it over and over again I think it's

1650
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:41,520
in the books

1651
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:44,719
too is um if one breaks you got a crack

1652
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:46,520
tooth it's falling out falling apart

1653
01:09:44,719 --> 01:09:50,080
that's the one I would get done in book

1654
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:54,920
one medical medum book one I talk about

1655
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:56,679
this I don't think it's good

1656
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:59,440
from what Spirit of compassion has

1657
01:09:56,679 --> 01:10:01,640
taught me to get them all done at once

1658
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:05,440
if you're going to ever get them all

1659
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:08,640
done getting six done eight done at once

1660
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:13,080

a time maybe one at a time um per Dental

1662
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:17,760
visit it's less burden on your immune

1663
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:23,199
system I tell friends they could leave

1664
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:25,880
them alone unless they're causing a

1665
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:28,679
problem in sense where they're um

1666
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:31,719
they're broken the tooth is cracked and

1667
01:10:28,679 --> 01:10:31,719
needs to be cared

nice you

1851
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:21,000
guys but seriously with teeth

1852
01:20:17,639 --> 01:20:23,000
problems you'll see everything blamed on

1853
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:25,199
the wrong thing with teeth like lemon

1854
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:27,360
water lemon's bad you'll see that out

1855
01:20:25,199 --> 01:20:29,080
there like people would just say the

1856
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:32,360
wrong things for teeth but they just

1857
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:32,360
don't realize it they don't

1858
01:20:33,639 --> 01:20:38,239
know and the whole vegan thing like if

1859
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:41,840
you're vegan and that's why your teeth

1860
01:20:38,239 --> 01:20:44,159
are bad that's really rude and wrong I

1861
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:47,159
mean if it was real fine if it was

1862
01:20:44,159 --> 01:20:53,360
actually accurate

1863
01:20:47,159 --> 01:20:56,080
fine I will say this one diet that will

1864
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:58,600
destroy teeth turn them into that

1865
01:20:56,080 --> 01:21:02,320
terrible time capsule

1866
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:05,080
problem it's the carnivore diet where

1867
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:06,400
it's not even the healthier meat eating

1868
01:21:05,080 --> 01:21:07,719
diets where you're getting enough fruit

1869
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:09,679
and vegetables and everything and

1870
01:21:07,719 --> 01:21:11,520
carnivore diets are changing right I

1871
01:21:09,679 --> 01:21:13,560
predicted that I predicted it would

1872
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:15,880
change because you can't survive that

1873
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:18,600
way only eating meat on its own by

1874
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:21,040
itself you gets so deficient and glucose

1875
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:25,400
deficient no sugar to the brain it gets

1876
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:27,360
so bad and and so yeah that's a real hit

1877
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:29,920
on teeth right there intermittent

1878
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:31,560
fasting can be a hit on teeth too

1879
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:34,440
because it's you know done wrong you're

1880
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:36,199
not doing enough alkaline leafy greens

1881
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:38,280
so intermittent

1882
01:21:36,199 --> 01:21:41,239
fasting that one right there can

1883
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:43,800
definitely hit teeth really

1884
01:21:41,239 --> 01:21:47,920
hard okay let's get a little honey in

1885
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:47,920
here and we're going to marinate some

1886
01:21:51,639 --> 01:21:56,520
ginger okay let's slice up some ginger

1887
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:58,639

1888
01:21:56,520 --> 01:22:02,880

1915
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:48,840
to see them behind there but we'll we'll

1916
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:52,159

1920
01:23:57,280 --> 01:24:03,120
there you go marinating these rice is

1921
01:24:00,639 --> 01:24:08,000
just about

1922
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:10,159
done all right put this

1923
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:13,000
aside

1924
01:24:10,159 --> 01:24:16,560
wo when you're up against a lot

1925
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:19,840
already your body may not prioritize

1926
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:22,840
your teeth you're up against pathogens

1927
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:25,960
low-grade viral infections strep

1928
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:28,639
bacteria staff in your system a lot of

1929
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:31,600
people got CF in their system a lot of

1930
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:34,600
people got unproductive fungus yeast

1931
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:36,679
mold in their system right mainly the

1932
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:39,040
pathogens like the viruses and stuff

1933
01:24:36,679 --> 01:24:42,360
really keep the immune system

1934
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:43,920
busy so bacteria and viruses tend to

1935
01:24:42,360 --> 01:24:46,080
keep everybody busy and then add the

1936
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:48,440
toxic heavy metals and the chemicals and

1937
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:49,960
add the coffee and the caffeine and add

1938
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:51,719
the vinegar and all the other different

1939
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:53,440
things including a lot of the stuff

1940
01:24:51,719 --> 01:24:55,920
that's in in the health realm that

1941
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:58,119
doesn't doesn't actually help you it

1942
01:24:55,920 --> 01:25:00,040
hurts you and maybe you're in a bad

1943
01:24:58,119 --> 01:25:03,199
stressful situation you're under a lot

1944
01:25:00,040 --> 01:25:06,960
you're under a lot of stress you have an

1945
01:25:03,199 --> 01:25:10,719
emotional um emotional challenge that's

1946
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:12,639
really hard on you losses struggles and

1947
01:25:10,719 --> 01:25:15,280
it's draining minerals from you quickly

1948
01:25:12,639 --> 01:25:17,719
and your adrenaline is rushing so I want

1949
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:21,760
to hit that one last

1950
01:25:17,719 --> 01:25:24,080
time right there fight or flight bad for

1951
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:27,480
the teeth

1952
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:30,520
fight or flight flight or fight is bad

1953
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:32,960
for the teeth adrenaline surges because

1954
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:34,639
you're under something that has happened

1955
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:37,280
like someone texted you something that's

1956
01:25:34,639 --> 01:25:39,480
awful maybe maybe someone misunderstood

1957
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:40,880
you maybe you're triggered maybe you're

1958
01:25:39,480 --> 01:25:44,280
going through a really hard time maybe

1959
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:45,920
you're struggling it's adrenaline right

1960
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:48,440
maybe you're just somebody that's into

1961
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:50,119
adrenaline Sports you're physically

1962
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:53,880
capable of doing it and you're doing

1963
01:25:50,119 --> 01:25:56,679
you're like an adrenaline junkie

1964
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:59,480
and so and you're somebody like that too

1965
01:25:56,679 --> 01:26:01,199
so but adrenals what they do is when

1966
01:25:59,480 --> 01:26:03,239
we're up against stuff and we're using

1967
01:26:01,199 --> 01:26:05,320
them a lot they pump and they pump and

1968
01:26:03,239 --> 01:26:07,560
they pump and what happens these little

1969
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:09,920
adrenal glands are pumping and

1970
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:11,600
pumping and they're releasing adrenaline

1971
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:14,360
and adrenaline is corrosive and

1972
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:15,880
adrenaline needs to be calmed down by

1973
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:18,159
minerals in the

1974
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:19,960
body but we just it depletes our

1975
01:26:18,159 --> 01:26:22,360
minerals instead it just gives us

1976
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:25,080
mineral deficiencies and then we get get

1977
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:28,080
in trouble that's another thing too you

1978
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:31,800
add all of these

1979
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:33,320
up all right let's get the filling going

1980
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:35,719
let's get things

1981
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:38,760
going I have to thinly slice some

1982
01:26:35,719 --> 01:26:38,760
radishes really

1983
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:42,080
quick

1984
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:49,280
okay Den gay says a w bro you got so

1985
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:51,679
much energy that's a testament to

1986
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:54,840
Medical mean protocols in itself I do

1987
01:26:51,679 --> 01:26:57,159
enjoy your your live webcasts thank you

1988
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:59,280
very much I really appreciate that I do

1989
01:26:57,159 --> 01:27:01,600
truly so what I'm going to do is slice

1990
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:03,480
these really thin because I'm going to

1991
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:05,560
place them in the Nori really thin so

1992
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:10,040
they don't break the Nori

now live there we go let's do one more

2016
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:15,639
and then we'll get the Cucumber done and

2017
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:20,280
we're

2018
01:28:15,639 --> 01:28:23,159
good so we're actually airing in a few

2019
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:25,000
different places

2020
01:28:23,159 --> 01:28:27,400
few different

2021
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:30,239
channels I'm going to shut this

2022
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:34,639
off because this is

2023
01:28:30,239 --> 01:28:38,719
actually at its best that's cauliflower

2024
01:28:34,639 --> 01:28:38,719
rice these are really nice and

2025
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:46,760
thin I wouldn't say paper I would say

2026
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:46,760
close to it

2027
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:50,480
though

2028
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:55,080
okay

2029
01:28:53,159 --> 01:28:57,480
the thing is is Dental when you get

2030
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:59,600
dental work done cosmetically it wears

2031
01:28:57,480 --> 01:29:00,960
out and you got to redo it again it's

2032
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:05,320
like you get veneers then you got to get

2033
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:08,000
the veneers again it just wears

2034
01:29:05,320 --> 01:29:09,840
out and so do fillings fillings wear out

2035
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:12,239
over time they crack they break they got

2036
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:13,719
to get redone and what happens is most

2037
01:29:12,239 --> 01:29:16,560
of the time when they get redone if they

2038
01:29:13,719 --> 01:29:17,880
were deep fillings deep ones then the

2039
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:20,760
dentist is going to say hey you need a

2040
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:22,199
root canal now that's a that's what the

2041
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:26,080
dentists will do they'll be like you

2042
01:29:22,199 --> 01:29:28,679
need a root canal now and people run

2043
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:28,679
into that a

2044
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:34,000
lot okay radishes I want to put it in

2045
01:29:32,840 --> 01:29:36,480
this

2046
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:38,880
bowl there we go and I want to move in

2047
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:42,080
cucumber really quick knock this

2048
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:45,239
out the rice is

2049
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:46,840
done all right I'm peeling the skin back

2050
01:29:45,239 --> 01:29:49,280
on this I know I told you guys the last

2051
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:52,280
time I did the Nory rolls the reason why

2052
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:54,480
this is not a garden cucumber this skin

2053
01:29:52,280 --> 01:29:58,119
will have this is an organic cucumber

2054
01:29:54,480 --> 01:30:01,280
but the skin will have a treatment on it

2055
01:29:58,119 --> 01:30:01,280
and kind of keep that in

2056
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:08,360
mind organic produce and conventional

2057
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:10,960
produce not all conventional produce but

2058
01:30:08,360 --> 01:30:15,040
conventional produce will will be

2059
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:19,840
treated so this skin right here will

2060
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:22,679
have anything from MSG in it nicotine in

2061
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:25,239
it so what you'll see

2062
01:30:22,679 --> 01:30:27,719
and not to mention if somebody's

2063
01:30:25,239 --> 01:30:29,600
fingernails are got all kinds of crud

2064
01:30:27,719 --> 01:30:33,600
under there like crazy

2065
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:35,800
DNA all kinds of different junk and

2066
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:37,239
garbage and feces and everything else

2067
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:38,719
and their fingernails and they're at the

2068
01:30:37,239 --> 01:30:41,159
supermarket and they're grabbing the

2069
01:30:38,719 --> 01:30:42,560
cucumbers and they Le they put it back

2070
01:30:41,159 --> 01:30:44,840
and what happens is their fingernails

2071
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:47,679
went jammed into the Cucumber I kind of

2072
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:48,840
want to get the skin off a little bit I

2073
01:30:47,679 --> 01:30:52,679
don't need

2074
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:54,679
to be eating somebody else's like FEC

2075
01:30:52,679 --> 01:30:57,320
particles it's not something that I

2076
01:30:54,679 --> 01:30:57,320
would like to

2077
01:30:57,800 --> 01:31:04,480
do just like the feal matter implant

2078
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:08,199
thing feal implant matter I don't like

2079
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:11,360
that either I would never never allow

2080
01:31:08,199 --> 01:31:13,320
that would never do that modality where

2081
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:16,239
they put somebody else's feces up you

2082
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:17,920
know in your colon through your anus oh

2083
01:31:16,239 --> 01:31:19,320
my God I would never do that there's no

2084
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:21,119
way someone's putting somebody else's

2085
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:22,960
[ __ ] up my ass it's not happening it's

2086
01:31:21,119 --> 01:31:25,440
not happening and I see that getting

2087
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:26,960
popular like are you insane they don't

2088
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:28,440
catch the viruses and that stuff they're

2089
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:30,159
not looking for all the viruses in

2090
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:32,960
different different pathogens and

2091
01:31:30,159 --> 01:31:34,880
material that'ss in that stuff it's

2092
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:37,560
crazy so what I'm going to do is I'm

2093
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:39,400
going to cut this cucumber a certain way

2094
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:41,320
so it's

2095
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:44,480
not there we

2096
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:46,639
go I'm going to cut it like this too

2097
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:49,440
there we go I don't want them real big

2098
01:31:46,639 --> 01:31:53,760
and hunky keep that in

2099
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:53,760
mind I want these nice

2100
01:31:54,000 --> 01:32:00,600
watch this right I want it like

2101
01:31:57,400 --> 01:32:03,639
this let me just get this right there we

2102
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:06,560
go thank you Anthony just had a tooth

2103
01:32:03,639 --> 01:32:10,440

2104
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:10,440
four dead teeth thank you so much

2105
01:32:12,679 --> 01:32:18,280
forever okay making these nice and even

2106
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:19,880
because I don't want them tearing up

2107
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:22,280
these nor rolls normally I wouldn't be

2108
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:24,159
this careful but

2109
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:25,920
but I'm having having some people over

2110
01:32:24,159 --> 01:32:29,360
and what's going to happen is I want

2111
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:31,040
these to really like have a look to them

2112
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:35,600
I want them to

2113
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:37,400
be you know presentable I mean honestly

2114
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:40,199
if I was making this for myself right

2115
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:42,320
now just for myself I would just throw

2116
01:32:40,199 --> 01:32:44,960
this whole piece of cucumber in that

2117
01:32:42,320 --> 01:32:47,119
that roll possibly with that rice and

2118
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:48,639
some other stuff I would probably

2119
01:32:47,119 --> 01:32:51,639
wouldn't be doing it this way but this

2120
01:32:48,639 --> 01:32:56,760

2148
01:33:52,679 --> 01:33:57,119

2149
01:33:54,880 --> 01:34:00,800

2153
01:34:07,639 --> 01:34:11,199
piece lost that knife we're going to use

2154
01:34:09,719 --> 01:34:14,560
this knife

2155
01:34:11,199 --> 01:34:16,920
now got to be careful in the kitchen

2156
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:16,920
we're

2157
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:22,119
live all

2158
01:34:19,880 --> 01:34:24,480
right there we go

2159
01:34:22,119 --> 01:34:27,679
we'll do

2160
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:30,000
another we take off that tip all right

2161
01:34:27,679 --> 01:34:32,080
Wendy says or Rook Canal's necessary

2162
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:34,840
Unfortunately they are to keep a tooth

2163
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:36,639
for a lot of people Unfortunately they

2164
01:34:34,840 --> 01:34:40,520
are they're

2165
01:34:36,639 --> 01:34:40,520
necessary if it gets that

2166
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:49,320
bad okay there we go all

2167
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:54,920
right so

2168
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:58,480
if your

2169
01:34:54,920 --> 01:35:01,600
um if what happens is if that cavity

2170
01:34:58,480 --> 01:35:04,320
went too deep or you just have bacteria

2171
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:06,000
that somehow got deep into the root your

2172
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:08,800
body's immune system did not like

2173
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:10,800
capture it it not grab it it didn't

2174
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:12,520
destroy it and you got bacteria that got

2175
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:18,280
in that root somehow and around that

2176
01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:20,520
root or you had a cavity done

2177
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:25,080
okay there's a better better look at the

2178
01:35:20,520 --> 01:35:26,920
root right and you had a cavity done and

2179
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:28,520
yet some bacteria still stayed in there

2180
01:35:26,920 --> 01:35:31,000
it went too deep the cavity might have

2181
01:35:28,520 --> 01:35:32,719
been too deep either way a lot of people

2182
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,920
are getting a cavity a lot of people

2183
01:35:32,719 --> 01:35:36,199
don't know they're going to get a root

2184
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:38,800
canal until they're in the dentist chair

2185
01:35:36,199 --> 01:35:41,000
and the their cavity is being drilled

2186
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:42,760
and then the dentist goes too far and

2187
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:46,040
goes into the pulp of the tooth right

2188
01:35:42,760 --> 01:35:47,280
into the nerve way too deep and then

2189
01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:50,080
they're like whoa you're going to need a

2190
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:51,840
rot canal in order to keep that tooth

2191
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:53,199
it's necessary to get a rot canal it's

2192
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:55,080
necessary to do that sometimes they'll

2193
01:35:53,199 --> 01:35:56,320
do a crown sometimes they won't it all

2194
01:35:55,080 --> 01:35:57,840
depends on the dentist or what's

2195
01:35:56,320 --> 01:36:00,360
happening or how much how much of your

2196
01:35:57,840 --> 01:36:03,440
tooth is left but a lot of times

2197
01:36:00,360 --> 01:36:05,760
bacteria inflames those that

2198
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:08,159
nerve and yeah root canals are are

2199
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:08,159
necessary

2200
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:11,960
unfortunately you know in alternative

2201
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:13,280
movement it's like don't get a root

2202
01:36:11,960 --> 01:36:14,960
canal don't get a root canal don't get a

2203
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:17,400
root canal okay then what are you going

2204
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:19,119
to do you're going to lose your tooth

2205
01:36:17,400 --> 01:36:20,320
like what are we going to do like the

2206
01:36:19,119 --> 01:36:23,239
tooth's

2207
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:25,760
gone

2208
01:36:23,239 --> 01:36:25,760
got another

2209
01:36:26,199 --> 01:36:31,000
knife like you know we get in trouble

2210
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:33,400
like that and then there's Teeth Let's

2211
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:34,840
talk about I didn't know I was actually

2212
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:36,719
going to be able to talk so much about

2213
01:36:34,840 --> 01:36:38,679
teeth while we're doing this but it's

2214
01:36:36,719 --> 01:36:39,920
fun that way I like that let's get a

2215
01:36:38,679 --> 01:36:42,360
couple more of

2216
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:44,520
these this is actually

2217
01:36:42,360 --> 01:36:47,080
fun I don't know about you guys but I'm

2218
01:36:44,520 --> 01:36:48,800
having a good time let's just get the

2219
01:36:47,080 --> 01:36:50,239
scallions the scallions done and we can

2220
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:51,840
make these rolls and we're going to make

2221
01:36:50,239 --> 01:36:53,440
these rolls good

2222
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:55,800
look at that see how I'm doing that

2223
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:58,520
these are long long scallions from the

2224
01:36:55,800 --> 01:37:00,159
garden and I can I can make so many out

2225
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:02,719
of these look I just made one right

2226
01:37:00,159 --> 01:37:04,119
there see I'm going to add that to there

2227
01:37:02,719 --> 01:37:05,920
right and then I'm going to take this

2228
01:37:04,119 --> 01:37:08,000
and I'm going to cut this in half so

2229
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:10,840
we're not doing a huge

2230
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:13,280
scallion in in the Nori roll look I cut

2231
01:37:10,840 --> 01:37:15,600
it in half and watch this you guys boom

2232
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:16,520
look at this perfect sizes let's do

2233
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:19,280
another

2234
01:37:16,520 --> 01:37:23,199
one clenching I talk about in the

2235
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:23,199
medical medium books

2236
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:30,560
right shingles

2237
01:37:26,679 --> 01:37:33,159
TMJ pain trigeminal nerve pain how about

2238
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:35,920
that all of it and then and then the

2239
01:37:33,159 --> 01:37:39,239
tension and then the teeth grinding it's

2240
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:41,239
not just strep it's not just strep or

2241
01:37:39,239 --> 01:37:43,239
and and bacteria that's in around

2242
01:37:41,239 --> 01:37:47,080
people's teeth it's not just cavity

2243
01:37:43,239 --> 01:37:49,280
bacteria it's not any of that it's viral

2244
01:37:47,080 --> 01:37:50,880
so what happens with people is when

2245
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:53,480
they're clenching their jaw and they're

2246
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:57,119
grind Bing their

2247
01:37:53,480 --> 01:37:59,280
teeth that right there that's from the

2248
01:37:57,119 --> 01:38:01,800
nerves the cranial nerves like the

2249
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:04,960
trigeminal nerve being inflamed so when

2250
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:07,679
it's even mildly inflamed we get tension

2251
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:09,159
and we actually clench and when people

2252
01:38:07,679 --> 01:38:11,840
have the fever blister the Simplex

2253
01:38:09,159 --> 01:38:14,080
herpes one simplex virus you don't even

2254
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:16,239
have to have the blister on your lip you

2255
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:18,480
don't have to have it and you'll still

2256
01:38:16,239 --> 01:38:18,480
be

2257
01:38:20,119 --> 01:38:24,880
clenching so a lot of and shingles

2258
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:26,719
that's another one shingles in

2259
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:28,800
somebody's system can do a lot of

2260
01:38:26,719 --> 01:38:30,760
clenching wondering Wishin says thank

2261
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:32,080
you for saying root canals are okay I

2262
01:38:30,760 --> 01:38:33,760
had four before medical medium

2263
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:37,159
information now I don't feel so bad

2264
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:39,320
don't feel bad at all don't feel bad at

2265
01:38:37,159 --> 01:38:41,560
all we try not to get root canals by

2266
01:38:39,320 --> 01:38:43,920
taking care of our teeth in all the ways

2267
01:38:41,560 --> 01:38:45,520
we can that's medical medum information

2268
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:47,760
but if you have to get a root canal in

2269
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:50,639
the past or something happens and you

2270
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:55,119
need one it's it's not it's it's not

2271
01:38:50,639 --> 01:38:57,400
your fault it happens all right you guys

2272
01:38:55,119 --> 01:38:57,400
I'm

2273
01:38:59,599 --> 01:39:06,280
ready let's go and let's make these I

2274
01:39:03,119 --> 01:39:08,560
actually think we're ready voila Nory

2275
01:39:06,280 --> 01:39:11,000
sheet I need to tell you something about

2276
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:11,000
this Nory

2277
01:39:12,719 --> 01:39:17,520
sheet if you take Nory sheets these are

2278
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:20,040
toasted if you take Nory sheets straight

2279
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:24,080
out of the

2280
01:39:20,040 --> 01:39:25,920
package you have to moisten them if you

2281
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:29,199
want to make a roll up because they'll

2282
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:32,159
just explode they'll explode and fall

2283
01:39:29,199 --> 01:39:33,760
apart so you have to moisten them dampen

2284
01:39:32,159 --> 01:39:37,520
them I don't have to with these cuz I

2285
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:40,320
had the I had the package open for a

2286
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:42,199
long time and moisture just got in there

2287
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:44,159
and that's what's really cool too people

2288
01:39:42,199 --> 01:39:47,440
do get unnecessary root canals I just

2289
01:39:44,159 --> 01:39:50,360
want to say they do when there's viral

2290
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:53,639
issues a virus inflaming like shingles

2291
01:39:50,360 --> 01:39:55,560
or herpes simplex 1 inflaming the

2292
01:39:53,639 --> 01:39:58,520
trigeminal nerves and they're feeling

2293
01:39:55,560 --> 01:40:00,920
jaw pain they're feeling gum pain like

2294
01:39:58,520 --> 01:40:03,040
they're gum a lot of people have burning

2295
01:40:00,920 --> 01:40:05,159
gums from the shingles virus even a

2296
01:40:03,040 --> 01:40:06,280
little bit of Epstein bar they'll have

2297
01:40:05,159 --> 01:40:09,440
burning

2298
01:40:06,280 --> 01:40:11,880
gums they'll have jaw pain they'll be

2299
01:40:09,440 --> 01:40:15,639
hurting over here really bad by their

2300
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:18,560
MERS the dentist does that

2301
01:40:15,639 --> 01:40:20,320
Panorama takes digitals says

2302
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:23,000
everything's looking pretty good but if

2303
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:24,960
you keep on having pain over here if

2304
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:26,199
that hurts ma'am if that hurts right

2305
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:28,000
here we're going to have to do a root

2306
01:40:26,199 --> 01:40:30,760
canal maybe that will fix it a lot of

2307
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:32,520
people get unnecessary root canals they

2308
01:40:30,760 --> 01:40:34,159
don't work they get the root canal and

2309
01:40:32,520 --> 01:40:36,480
they're still in pain because it was

2310
01:40:34,159 --> 01:40:38,679
viral inflammation I see dentist talking

2311
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:39,960
about that now but guess what that was

2312
01:40:38,679 --> 01:40:41,719
published first with medical medium

2313
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:44,679
material and medical medium

2314
01:40:41,719 --> 01:40:49,040
information and now they're using that

2315
01:40:44,679 --> 01:40:52,159
my most unfavorite thing ever is MM info

2316
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:55,719
out there origin it from the books and

2317
01:40:52,159 --> 01:40:59,520
from my lectures over the years and then

2318
01:40:55,719 --> 01:41:00,960
taken used the wrong way and then at the

2319
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:03,679
same time they say that medical medium

2320
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:05,639
knows nothing out there it hurts people

2321
01:41:03,679 --> 01:41:08,520
bad because they can't get back to the

2322
01:41:05,639 --> 01:41:10,080
source and learn the information so they

2323
01:41:08,520 --> 01:41:12,599
can heal all

2324
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:14,360
right I got a nor sheet right here I

2325
01:41:12,599 --> 01:41:15,480
don't have to moist inate I might take a

2326
01:41:14,360 --> 01:41:18,040
little bit of the orange juice at the

2327
01:41:15,480 --> 01:41:18,040
end to seal

2328
01:41:19,199 --> 01:41:26,000
it okay I'm not going to use a sushi mat

2329
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:27,480
I don't need one I don't like using

2330
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:30,080
those I think they make it more

2331
01:41:27,480 --> 01:41:32,199
difficult I think they're even harder on

2332
01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:35,679
beginners so that's that's something

2333
01:41:32,199 --> 01:41:38,639
that's important to to

2334
01:41:35,679 --> 01:41:40,239
know all right let's get some rice in

2335
01:41:38,639 --> 01:41:44,360
here let's

2336
01:41:40,239 --> 01:41:44,360
roll we got some cauliflower

01:41:54,159 --> 01:41:56,679
don't want to

2341
01:41:58,040 --> 01:42:01,800
use

2342
01:42:00,080 --> 01:42:04,320
okay all

2343
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:06,000
right I'm going to move this over so it

2344
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:09,199
actually

2345
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:12,199

2438
01:46:29,719 --> 01:46:35,199

we

2443
01:46:42,080 --> 01:46:47,360
go seriously though a lot of

2444
01:46:44,920 --> 01:46:49,920
people they're doing things that are

2445
01:46:47,360 --> 01:46:51,360
hurting their teeth every single day

2446
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:53,960
they're out there're doing stuff that's

2447
01:46:51,360 --> 01:46:57,440
hurting their teeth they don't know it

2448
01:46:53,960 --> 01:46:57,440
they don't know it it's really

2449
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:04,360
sad now if I had look if I had a bunch

2450
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:08,520
of

2451
01:47:04,360 --> 01:47:11,679
implants if I had a bunch of implants if

2452
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:15,239
I had three or four root

2453
01:47:11,679 --> 01:47:16,719
canals I shouldn't be I honestly I most

2454
01:47:15,239 --> 01:47:19,320
likely shouldn't be giving you any

2455
01:47:16,719 --> 01:47:21,119
advice on this I

2456
01:47:19,320 --> 01:47:23,080
mean

2457
01:47:21,119 --> 01:47:25,119
because I've had a chance since I was

2458
01:47:23,080 --> 01:47:27,239
younger to take care of my teeth through

2459
01:47:25,119 --> 01:47:30,159
S so's information with this knowledge

2460
01:47:27,239 --> 01:47:33,080
to stay away from things and to be

2461
01:47:30,159 --> 01:47:36,480
cautious but um but when I talk to like

2462
01:47:33,080 --> 01:47:37,560
podcast doctors or you know a lot of the

2463
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:39,199
guys that are out there in the health

2464
01:47:37,560 --> 01:47:41,599
realm a lot of the doctors your teeth

2465
01:47:39,199 --> 01:47:44,239
are just they're just they're a terrible

2466
01:47:41,599 --> 01:47:47,119
shape their teeth

2467
01:47:44,239 --> 01:47:50,320
and I mean they have so much teeth work

2468
01:47:47,119 --> 01:47:52,080
done it it's crazy how much and I'm not

2469
01:47:50,320 --> 01:47:53,639
judging them but they sit there and they

2470
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:55,520
actually try to say they know everything

2471
01:47:53,639 --> 01:47:57,520
about everything they try to say they

2472
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:59,320
know everything about autoimmune they

2473
01:47:57,520 --> 01:48:00,800
say the body attacks itself that's why

2474
01:47:59,320 --> 01:48:02,920
people have autoimmune they say all

2475
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:05,679
these things right talk about genes and

2476
01:48:02,920 --> 01:48:07,679
all kinds of stuff and they talk about

2477
01:48:05,679 --> 01:48:09,360
like you know these different keto diets

2478
01:48:07,679 --> 01:48:13,760
and intermittent fasting diets and their

2479
01:48:09,360 --> 01:48:15,199
teeth are just all like mangled up and

2480
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:16,760
they've been in the the realm for a

2481
01:48:15,199 --> 01:48:18,400
little while enough and they're like

2482
01:48:16,760 --> 01:48:20,599
afraid of lemon water they're afraid of

2483
01:48:18,400 --> 01:48:21,840
all kinds of things they just don't know

2484
01:48:20,599 --> 01:48:23,840

2507
01:49:30,280 --> 01:49:33,560

2510
01:49:36,760 --> 01:49:41,280
you do apple cider vinegar that's a

2511
01:49:39,400 --> 01:49:42,719
question I wanted too like are any of

2512
01:49:41,280 --> 01:49:45,719

you stop using it are you still using it

2514
01:49:45,719 --> 01:49:49,119
don't get me wrong it's the best vinegar

2515
01:49:47,599 --> 01:49:51,080
there is out of all the

2516
01:49:49,119 --> 01:49:53,000

01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:57,159
confusion I'm not trying to contradict

2519
01:49:55,440 --> 01:49:59,199
myself I'm just saying it is the best

2520
01:49:57,159 --> 01:50:00,159
vinegar out of all of them especially if

2521
01:49:59,199 --> 01:50:02,880
it has the

2522
01:50:00,159 --> 01:50:04,760
mother but it's just as damaging there's

2523
01:50:02,880 --> 01:50:07,199
no difference it does a lot of damage in

2524
01:50:04,760 --> 01:50:08,880

these wait till you taste this with

2530
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:22,320
dipping sauces

2531
01:50:21,119 --> 01:50:25,320
so

2532
01:50:22,320 --> 01:50:28,360
good let's roll that baby

2533
01:50:25,320 --> 01:50:32,119
up it's a little it's a little tricky

2534
01:50:28,360 --> 01:50:34,639
that one there we go okay another one

2535
01:50:32,119 --> 01:50:34,639
slice it

2536
01:50:35,480 --> 01:50:40,679
up there we

2537
01:50:37,599 --> 01:50:42,920
go how many of you guys are doing apple

2538
01:50:40,679 --> 01:50:42,920
cider

2539
01:50:49,040 --> 01:50:52,840
vinegar

2540
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:56,440
all

2541
01:50:52,840 --> 01:50:56,440
right these up

2542
01:50:59,119 --> 01:51:05,119
here how's it look you guys coming along

2543
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:06,560
I'm making a really nice setup here take

2544
01:51:05,119 --> 01:51:08,679
a

2545
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:12,599
look that's what we're

2546
01:51:08,679 --> 01:51:12,599
doing I want it to look

2547
01:51:12,679 --> 01:51:18,960
good and I'm not done

2548
01:51:15,320 --> 01:51:21,079
yet we still have some more to

2549
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:22,880
do

2550
01:51:21,079 --> 01:51:26,079
I think one of the most confusing Parts

2551
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:28,119
about teeth no matter what is because

2552
01:51:26,079 --> 01:51:30,440
they're time capsules they're like a

2553
01:51:28,119 --> 01:51:32,000
ticking Time Bomb what happens is

2554
01:51:30,440 --> 01:51:34,599
because they're like that ticking Time

2555
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:36,599
Bomb people don't realize when they fall

2556
01:51:34,599 --> 01:51:38,480
apart like what's happening in their

2557
01:51:36,599 --> 01:51:41,000
life in that moment they'll be like wait

2558
01:51:38,480 --> 01:51:44,400
a minute I'm taking care of myself I'm

2559
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:47,960
eating better I'm doing good things and

2560
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:50,400
then why are my teeth acting like

2561
01:51:47,960 --> 01:51:52,360
this and they just don't know that

2562
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:53,679
that's because of the past that's

2563
01:51:52,360 --> 01:51:57,040
because they're like little you know

2564
01:51:53,679 --> 01:51:57,040
little ticking

2565
01:51:57,079 --> 01:52:01,760
grenades in somebody's in somebody's

2566
01:51:59,599 --> 01:52:03,599
mouth where they just start falling

2567
01:52:01,760 --> 01:52:05,599
apart from Gears of all these different

2568
01:52:03,599 --> 01:52:07,920
things we

2569
01:52:05,599 --> 01:52:10,360
covered I don't want anybody feeling bad

2570
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:11,440
about a root canal getting a root canal

2571
01:52:10,360 --> 01:52:14,079
in the

2572
01:52:11,440 --> 01:52:17,639
past I completely understand when people

2573
01:52:14,079 --> 01:52:17,639
have to get R canals

2574
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:23,880
um

2575
01:52:21,639 --> 01:52:23,880
all

2576
01:52:24,840 --> 01:52:31,159
right another thing too is finding a

2577
01:52:28,920 --> 01:52:33,159
dentist that you trust and you're happy

2578
01:52:31,159 --> 01:52:36,280
with that's something I want to kind of

2579
01:52:33,159 --> 01:52:40,119
cover while we're doing this I I tend to

2580
01:52:36,280 --> 01:52:41,960
actually not talk about that too much

2581
01:52:40,119 --> 01:52:45,000
because there's so many other different

2582
01:52:41,960 --> 01:52:46,360
things to talk about but finding a

2583
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:49,079
dentist you're comfortable with there's

2584
01:52:46,360 --> 01:52:51,679
a lot of people that they feel really

2585
01:52:49,079 --> 01:52:54,320
uncomfortable with with their

2586
01:52:51,679 --> 01:52:58,560
dentist they don't trust their

2587
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:58,560
dentist but yet they have to go to

2588
01:53:00,119 --> 01:53:05,119
them sometimes it takes shopping around

2589
01:53:02,560 --> 01:53:07,440
to a few different

2590
01:53:05,119 --> 01:53:09,840
dentists don't be afraid of a

2591
01:53:07,440 --> 01:53:13,119
conventional D dentist you can say yay

2592
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:17,639
or nay you can be the one that says hey

2593
01:53:13,119 --> 01:53:20,520
I don't want to do that but I want to do

2594
01:53:17,639 --> 01:53:22,440
this to Don't Be Afraid like PE there's

2595
01:53:20,520 --> 01:53:23,800
some people they're just afraid of

2596
01:53:22,440 --> 01:53:26,239
conventional

2597
01:53:23,800 --> 01:53:28,119
dentists they go to a holistic dentist

2598
01:53:26,239 --> 01:53:29,920
that's fine there's some good holistic

2599
01:53:28,119 --> 01:53:32,719
dentist out there but there's some bad

2600
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:36,719
ones there's some good um conventional

2601
01:53:32,719 --> 01:53:36,719
dentists out there and there's some bad

2602
01:53:36,760 --> 01:53:42,719
ones you might find a conventional

2603
01:53:38,960 --> 01:53:45,840
dentist that's amazing really good

2604
01:53:42,719 --> 01:53:49,280
drills like no other handles your mouth

2605
01:53:45,840 --> 01:53:51,679
with care but yet they don't really know

2606
01:53:49,280 --> 01:53:53,480
anything about holistic but yet they do

2607
01:53:51,679 --> 01:53:56,280
the job they're doing that you hire them

2608
01:53:53,480 --> 01:53:57,760
for they do it right and you you can go

2609
01:53:56,280 --> 01:53:58,960
to a holistic dentist that has

2610
01:53:57,760 --> 01:54:00,639

all the bells and whistle they tell you

2614

2615
01:54:06,360 --> 01:54:10,360
dissolve your teeth whatever which is

2616
01:54:08,599 --> 01:54:12,400

whistles they have all the equipment

2618
01:54:12,400 --> 01:54:18,079

01:54:25,040 --> 01:54:29,199

2711
01:58:49,159 --> 01:58:56,280
up up and eating away at your gums also

2712
01:58:52,400 --> 01:58:58,760
destroying your teeth ammonia is

2713
01:58:56,280 --> 01:59:02,119
another problem that's all about the

2714
01:58:58,760 --> 01:59:04,800
liver and the HCL being really bad off

2715
01:59:02,119 --> 01:59:07,079
with people Hydrochloric acid's really

2716
01:59:04,800 --> 01:59:10,040
low because they burned out their their

2717
01:59:07,079 --> 01:59:12,360
stomach lands from all the coffee and

2718
01:59:10,040 --> 01:59:14,520
all the chocolate and the the vinegar

2719
01:59:12,360 --> 01:59:17,440
the acetic acid and they burned out

2720
01:59:14,520 --> 01:59:18,239
their stomach glands it's the last one

2721
01:59:17,440 --> 01:59:19,840
you

2722
01:59:18,239 --> 01:59:21,440
guys

2723
01:59:19,840 --> 01:59:23,840
and what happened was their food's

2724
01:59:21,440 --> 01:59:26,920
rotting in their gut it's rotting

2725
01:59:23,840 --> 01:59:29,719
they're getting gut rot right food gut

2726
01:59:26,920 --> 01:59:31,040
rot and then all this ammonia is Ghostly

2727
01:59:29,719 --> 01:59:33,239
and it's traveling through their

2728
01:59:31,040 --> 01:59:36,280
intestinal tract into their bones

2729
01:59:33,239 --> 01:59:38,400
everything and into the bones means into

2730
01:59:36,280 --> 01:59:40,840
your teeth and when that ammonia is

2731
01:59:38,400 --> 01:59:42,199
constantly percolating up all night as

2732
01:59:40,840 --> 01:59:45,000
you sleep you lay flat when you're

2733
01:59:42,199 --> 01:59:46,239

into your

2735
01:59:46,239 --> 01:59:53,040
