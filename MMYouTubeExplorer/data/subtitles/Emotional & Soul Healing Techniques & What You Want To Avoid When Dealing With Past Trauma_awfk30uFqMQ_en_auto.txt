[58.38 - 61.68] Soul search
[60.00 - 63.12] they Soul searched before they're

[63.12 - 69.24] anybody that you may know
[66.36 - 70.68] even if they don't know their soul
[69.24 - 73.20] searching
[70.68 - 75.06] even if they don't call it that so it's
[73.20 - 76.80] not like we're calling it that
[75.06 - 78.84] says you're living your life and you

[83.10 - 88.44] confused
[84.42 - 91.32] you feel like you're lacking purpose
[88.44 - 94.82] you feel like you don't have confidence
[91.32 - 94.82] or you're losing confidence
[95.10 - 98.40] but what happens is we're actually
[96.78 - 100.50] soul-searching
[98.40 - 102.30] even if someone seems like the most
[100.50 - 107.04] confident person
[102.30 - 110.10] like their confidence is over the top
[107.04 - 111.12] even if someone's ego is just way up

[117.12 - 125.88] someone's ego is just way up here
[122.10 - 128.46] even if somebody's pride and ego and
[125.88 - 131.22] confidence is way up here
[128.46 - 134.42] they're still soul-searching and they'll
[131.22 - 134.42] still soul-search

[299.52 - 305.84] so even if we don't know it or we don't
[301.56 - 305.84] call it that everybody is soul searching
[308.52 - 312.00] we Soul search because part of us feels
[310.92 - 314.10] lost
[312.00 - 316.68] or we don't feel whole
[314.10 - 321.26] do you ever have that feeling where
[316.68 - 321.26] you just don't feel like a whole person
[321.30 - 326.64] you feel like there's a piece missing
[324.24 - 328.50] are a part of you that's missing and you
[326.64 - 330.60] don't feel whole
[328.50 - 332.64] did you ever have that experience where
[330.60 - 334.56] you don't feel that
[332.64 - 336.24] you don't feel like you're whole or
[334.56 - 338.04] because we feel like we're not living up
[336.24 - 340.14] to our Soul's potential
[338.04 - 342.30] how many people feel like I'm not living
[340.14 - 344.22] up
[342.30 - 346.98] to the standard that I make for myself
[344.22 - 350.40] on not living up to my full potential
[346.98 - 354.50] I'm not living up to my soul's potential
[350.40 - 354.50] how many people feel that way
[354.60 - 360.36] we Soul search because of life's
[357.96 - 362.70] hardships too
[360.36 - 364.44] heart the hardship scale let's talk
[362.70 - 366.66] about that a little bit
[364.44 - 369.24] it's interesting
[366.66 - 372.80] I've seen people
[369.24 - 372.80] go through atrocities
[374.34 - 379.02] and they had
[376.80 - 381.36] unbelievable hardships
[379.02 - 383.88] where if they tell someone you don't
[381.36 - 385.26] even you you can't
[383.88 - 387.24] even
[385.26 - 389.52] you don't have words you can't fathom
[387.24 - 392.10] what that's like
[389.52 - 394.50] people that have been in difficult
[392.10 - 397.14] hardships
[394.50 - 399.36] and those hardships take them to a place
[397.14 - 403.08] of soul-searching
[399.36 - 405.86] and then you have people where they had
[403.08 - 405.86] hardships too
[406.32 - 410.70] but the scale is so different for
[409.44 - 414.66] everyone
[410.70 - 416.34] for everybody the scale is so different
[414.66 - 418.50] there's different levels of hardships
[416.34 - 421.98] but it depends on which world you live
[418.50 - 424.46] in you can be someone who's silver spoon
[421.98 - 424.46] fed
[425.04 - 430.68] right great support system not a care in
[428.58 - 432.96] the world no financial problems
[430.68 - 435.96] whatsoever
[432.96 - 438.48] a family giving you support you go off
[435.96 - 440.16] to private schools
[438.48 - 443.18] everybody's worried about you everybody
[440.16 - 443.18] is taking care of you
[444.06 - 448.02] you don't have to worry about anything
[445.50 - 450.06] and you can still have a hardship
[448.02 - 451.86] still have a hardship
[450.06 - 453.96] and still get affected
[451.86 - 456.90] like the scale is different for everyone
[453.96 - 458.64] and then you can be someone that comes
[456.90 - 463.20] from nothing
[458.64 - 465.24] and got hit by a train or a bus and
[463.20 - 467.52] you just climb out of that and you go
[465.24 - 469.62] but there's hardships the hardship skill
[467.52 - 471.48] is really interesting I never talked
[469.62 - 474.60] about the hardship scale I should go
[471.48 - 477.18] into that more deeply
[474.60 - 479.22] often a negative experience or a series
[477.18 - 481.80] of them will prompt a person to feel
[479.22 - 485.48] broken or depleted who feels depleted
[481.80 - 485.48] when you go through something
[485.88 - 492.36] how many people feel like they're so
[489.72 - 494.22] low on Reserves
[492.36 - 496.26] they've been through a lot they've been
[494.22 - 498.18] through a lot of trauma they've had some
[496.26 - 499.62] heartaches and breakup maybe they had a
[498.18 - 501.30] relationship breakup and you feel like
[499.62 - 504.00] your heart was ripped out of your chest
[501.30 - 505.74] and stomped on
[504.00 - 508.98] and
[505.74 - 511.80] you just get wasted from it and your
[508.98 - 514.16] reserves get really low your reserves
[511.80 - 514.16] are low
[515.22 - 519.24] it's a lot of people that feel depleted
[517.38 - 521.04] from that Alexandria Sophia says what
[519.24 - 523.02] makes the scale so different is that
[521.04 - 525.26] karma from past lives really good
[523.02 - 525.26] question
[526.20 - 529.28] really good question
[531.24 - 534.54] the scale is so different you're talking
[532.98 - 536.88] about Alexandria you're talking about
[534.54 - 539.04] the scale as far as what makes the
[536.88 - 541.68] difference of someone having a much more
[539.04 - 544.44] difficult situation a difficult hardship
[541.68 - 545.82] versus somebody else was what seems like
[544.44 - 548.46] a lesser hardship and that's another
[545.82 - 550.44] discussion too but there's also
[548.46 - 552.96] how someone
[550.44 - 555.12] receives that hardship so what I was
[552.96 - 557.40] saying was you can get somebody that
[555.12 - 561.42] goes through something terrible
[557.40 - 564.12] and they seem to be bearing it
[561.42 - 566.52] and then you can get someone that they
[564.12 - 569.70] went through something very small
[566.52 - 572.22] but it feels so bad it feels so bad
[569.70 - 574.46] there's a scale that happens within
[572.22 - 574.46] everyone
[574.56 - 579.00] where's somebody else I'd be like wait a
[576.24 - 581.10] minute you're you're that hurt over that
[579.00 - 583.32] and the person's like I'm deeply hurt
[581.10 - 586.38] deeply deeply hurt you don't understand
[583.32 - 588.54] me you don't understand who I am you
[586.38 - 591.00] don't understand how I feel I am deeply
[588.54 - 592.74] deeply hurt
[591.00 - 594.42] and someone else would be like I
[592.74 - 597.36] understand what you're saying but I
[594.42 - 600.42] don't see why you're that hurt because I
[597.36 - 603.26] fell off a cliff and hit my head on a
[600.42 - 603.26] rock down below
[603.54 - 607.92] and it was a terrible trauma because
[606.00 - 611.58] someone pushed me off the cliff
[607.92 - 615.92] but I I've handled it I've tried to get
[611.58 - 615.92] past it and someone else is like
[616.50 - 619.74] you know they had a different experience
[618.30 - 622.26] for something what seems like much
[619.74 - 623.64] smaller because the hardship scaled you
[622.26 - 625.20] can't measure it is what I'm trying to
[623.64 - 627.24] tell you you can't measure it it's
[625.20 - 628.98] unmeasurable how people feel with their
[627.24 - 631.98] soul and what's going on inside their
[628.98 - 635.16] souls Gina says I agree I just lost my
[631.98 - 636.24] mother quit my job in healthcare and I'm
[635.16 - 639.12] lost
[636.24 - 641.16] light blast was great which I want to do
[639.12 - 643.20] another light Blast coming up but we
[641.16 - 645.12] have to do the on collecting Stones
[643.20 - 649.34] meditation journey I just think I was
[645.12 - 649.34] one of the ten that was last
[653.82 - 658.44] we want to feel complete again we don't
[656.46 - 660.30] want to feel depleted we don't want to
[658.44 - 663.68] feel like our reserves are low we want
[660.30 - 663.68] to feel complete again
[665.78 - 671.34] that's soul-searching it can take the
[668.22 - 673.62] form of attending Retreats going to hear
[671.34 - 676.56] inspirational speakers because we're
[673.62 - 678.24] soul-searching seeking advice from loved
[676.56 - 680.22] ones
[678.24 - 682.02] signing up to every single spiritual
[680.22 - 683.82] course in the world and paying two three
[682.02 - 685.20] thousand dollars or whatever it takes to
[683.82 - 687.42] just
[685.20 - 690.74] go sit with the best spiritual leaders
[687.42 - 690.74] because we're soul-searching
[691.08 - 696.30] enrolling in therapy or any other number
[694.20 - 697.98] of other activities that's what we do
[696.30 - 700.08] that's what people do out there we're
[697.98 - 702.96] soul-searching we're looking for answers
[700.08 - 705.60] we feel lost we feel there's a sadness
[702.96 - 709.74] inside of us we feel like
[705.60 - 711.84] something is wrong something's missing
[709.74 - 715.02] it's what we do when we're looking to
[711.84 - 717.72] heal and Elevate our souls
[715.02 - 719.88] to strengthen our purpose in life
[717.72 - 723.00] if you guys just got on here
[719.88 - 724.98] Jeanette gendrum says on Facebook I
[723.00 - 727.62] don't have time and money for soul
[724.98 - 732.06] searching too busy keeping kids and
[727.62 - 733.50] animals alive completely understand
[732.06 - 734.94] because you know what you're doing is
[733.50 - 737.90] survival
[734.94 - 737.90] it's survival
[739.14 - 742.44] I actually respect and appreciate that
[741.06 - 745.56] comment
[742.44 - 748.26] Juliet says I'm depleted I have had the
[745.56 - 749.58] most chaotic and traumatizing past
[748.26 - 752.54] for months
[749.58 - 752.54] past months
[757.44 - 760.86] that's what we do when we're looking to
[759.06 - 762.30] heal and Elevate our souls to strengthen
[760.86 - 766.28] our purpose in life
[762.30 - 766.28] your soul resides in your brain
[766.38 - 769.68] powerful piece of information right
[768.24 - 772.14] there
[769.68 - 775.26] it resides in your brain I've said this
[772.14 - 778.20] before it's why intuitively and
[775.26 - 781.50] instinctively they would chop people's
[778.20 - 785.16] heads off and stick them on pikes
[781.50 - 787.32] it's why they used to Guillotine people
[785.16 - 789.96] they hate it the most
[787.32 - 791.76] they didn't just stab them to death
[789.96 - 794.04] they didn't just drown them they
[791.76 - 795.84] Guillotine them they wanted their heads
[794.04 - 797.88] severed off their body
[795.84 - 799.80] because there was something back in the
[797.88 - 803.34] Dark Ages
[799.80 - 807.06] there was something back then
[803.34 - 810.12] that instinctively told
[807.06 - 812.78] the human race that something is inside
[810.12 - 812.78] of here
[817.38 - 821.10] Cassie Healy says is there an end to the
[819.84 - 823.56] soul-searching
[821.10 - 825.36] it's a really good question
[823.56 - 828.02] and how many lifetimes are we
[825.36 - 828.02] soul-searching
[829.86 - 835.38] people don't realize it but we take
[832.80 - 838.32] all of our experiences
[835.38 - 840.66] all of our knowledge
[838.32 - 843.68] we take it with us
[840.66 - 843.68] when we leave here
[844.26 - 848.94] because the physical brain isn't the
[846.42 - 851.94] only place that harnesses
[848.94 - 853.92] information the neurons and the glial
[851.94 - 856.80] cells isn't the only place that's
[853.92 - 860.58] harboring information
[856.80 - 862.62] the soul is harboring experiences and
[860.58 - 867.44] information
[862.62 - 867.44] our soul that resides here
[870.12 - 875.30] is harboring information from every
[872.64 - 875.30] single lifetime
[876.18 - 879.60] I hope it no one's offended if I even
[878.04 - 883.94] say that because someone might say no
[879.60 - 883.94] there's only one lifetime that's it
[885.60 - 890.82] I pose a question to you or pose a
[888.96 - 893.88] question
[890.82 - 896.40] if you're in with tremendous respect and
[893.88 - 899.60] no judgment if someone believes it's
[896.40 - 899.60] only a one-time thing
[900.30 - 905.16] we're here we're gone
[902.64 - 909.74] we have no soul
[905.16 - 909.74] we cease to exist and that's it
[910.26 - 916.10] everybody has their right to believe in
[912.78 - 916.10] anything they believe in
[916.26 - 919.16] but keep in mind
[919.68 - 923.96] where is it in the present time right
[921.84 - 923.96] now
[924.72 - 929.28] how is it possible
[927.66 - 932.30] we're all here
[929.28 - 932.30] on the front line
[932.40 - 936.42] think about that for a minute
[934.86 - 938.70] I want to go deeper into that Jake Davis
[936.42 - 941.16] says I spent so many years after I lost
[938.70 - 943.74] both of my parents
[941.16 - 946.14] lost and depleted
[943.74 - 947.88] after about a month of living in mm
[946.14 - 950.04] lifestyle
[947.88 - 952.38] I started to get my life back and felt
[950.04 - 954.12] like that void was finally being filled
[952.38 - 956.30] Jake thank you for being here you're on
[954.12 - 956.30] YouTube
[956.46 - 959.76] foreign
[957.36 - 961.38] how is it possible
[959.76 - 963.90] that we
[961.38 - 964.92] are on the front line of time itself
[963.90 - 966.72] right now
[964.92 - 969.66] think about it every minute that clicks
[966.72 - 972.56] forward every second that clicks forward
[969.66 - 972.56] is the front line
[973.08 - 977.30] we are on the front line right now
[978.12 - 981.36] you're not in the past right now 500
[979.92 - 983.76] years
[981.36 - 986.16] ago
[983.76 - 988.34] you're not in the future 500 years from
[986.16 - 988.34] now
[988.86 - 992.22] you're on
[990.72 - 994.26] the brink
[992.22 - 997.26] the edge
[994.26 - 999.72] you're on the front line pushing forward
[997.26 - 1001.52] into the future second by second by
[999.72 - 1004.34] second by second
[1001.52 - 1008.14] well how did you manage to end up here
[1004.34 - 1008.14] after billions of years
[1008.18 - 1014.30] and katrillions
[1010.16 - 1015.92] of people that have passed and gone
[1014.30 - 1016.94] they've lived their life they died they
[1015.92 - 1019.34] gone
[1016.94 - 1021.68] with their life they died they're gone
[1019.34 - 1023.24] civilizations
[1021.68 - 1027.16] centuries and centuries of people
[1023.24 - 1027.16] thousands of years of civilizations
[1029.00 - 1035.84] how is it possible with all that
[1033.68 - 1037.40] you think we were just chosen to be on
[1035.84 - 1039.38] the front line right now
[1037.40 - 1042.22] at the very second that's pushing
[1039.38 - 1042.22] forward into time
[1042.26 - 1046.04] that of all the trillions of people the
[1044.24 - 1047.72] billions and billions of people and the
[1046.04 - 1049.88] centuries and the thousands of years of
[1047.72 - 1051.68] civilizations for some reason were just
[1049.88 - 1054.14] picked to be on the front line of time
[1051.68 - 1056.24] aren't we special
[1054.14 - 1058.52] aren't we special
[1056.24 - 1061.88] no it's because
[1058.52 - 1065.14] we came around again
[1061.88 - 1065.14] we came around again
[1065.48 - 1069.14] Evan says I really hope you are coming
[1067.34 - 1071.18] out with your spiritual book that got
[1069.14 - 1072.86] delayed by prior events indeed it did
[1071.18 - 1075.74] get delayed in fact it was canceled for
[1072.86 - 1077.98] the year I'm not even able to work on it
[1075.74 - 1081.02] I've lost the opportunity for this year
[1077.98 - 1083.54] see Evan says I am looking forward to
[1081.02 - 1086.18] that so much I am too I've been kept
[1083.54 - 1088.10] busy by a lot of Darkness obviously you
[1086.18 - 1089.90] guys are up on what's happened and
[1088.10 - 1091.64] what's going on I don't know if you
[1089.90 - 1093.80] listen to the medical meeting podcast at
[1091.64 - 1095.36] Apple podcast
[1093.80 - 1097.34] the last
[1095.36 - 1099.50] few episodes I don't know if you've
[1097.34 - 1102.20] actually got a chance
[1099.50 - 1105.26] but yeah
[1102.20 - 1107.12] that was completely robbed from the
[1105.26 - 1110.12] medical medium community and robbed from
[1107.12 - 1110.78] me to be able to actually
[1110.12 - 1113.42] um
[1110.78 - 1116.38] fulfill a duty
[1113.42 - 1118.82] which is to hand in my spiritual book
[1116.38 - 1120.98] start complete and hand in my spiritual
[1118.82 - 1123.20] book for this year so we can have that
[1120.98 - 1126.34] to the publisher
[1123.20 - 1126.34] that never happened
[1130.58 - 1133.12] yep
[1135.62 - 1142.24] Anya says aw can you share why this time
[1138.92 - 1142.24] right now so significant
[1145.16 - 1149.36] well think about it right now we're on
[1147.32 - 1152.30] the front line of time as we speak all
[1149.36 - 1154.40] together in this moment
[1152.30 - 1156.86] which means we've
[1154.40 - 1158.84] most likely been here before and before
[1156.86 - 1161.48] and before and as I was saying before
[1158.84 - 1163.70] our soul carries information you might
[1161.48 - 1166.22] not be able to tap into it and tap into
[1163.70 - 1167.96] your soul and the information that
[1166.22 - 1169.34] you've taken over from Lifetime to
[1167.96 - 1171.68] Lifetime
[1169.34 - 1173.84] but I've learned all this from Spirit of
[1171.68 - 1175.28] compassion by the way
[1173.84 - 1178.22] you may not
[1175.28 - 1180.32] be privy to the information that's
[1178.22 - 1182.78] passed on
[1180.32 - 1185.84] over and over and over again meaning
[1182.78 - 1187.16] into boom another body your soul you
[1185.84 - 1189.08] live a life you get all these
[1187.16 - 1191.00] experiences in for information you die
[1189.08 - 1194.12] your soul contains that spiritual
[1191.00 - 1198.70] information all that knowledge
[1194.12 - 1198.70] and you may not be able to tap into it
[1200.06 - 1202.06] um
[1202.82 - 1206.84] that you think we're all here by chance
[1204.92 - 1209.36] just by chance
[1206.84 - 1211.58] with all those people who have been on
[1209.36 - 1213.08] this planet alone never mind how many
[1211.58 - 1213.92] people have been on other planets you
[1213.08 - 1217.10] think
[1213.92 - 1220.66] we've just suddenly have all just we're
[1217.10 - 1220.66] here right now by a fluke
[1223.22 - 1228.20] hey cold lights ring
[1225.20 - 1231.44] tally I suffer from chronic migraines
[1228.20 - 1233.54] on IG okay tally says I suffer from
[1231.44 - 1236.18] chronic migraines my father is unwell
[1233.54 - 1238.34] and it's changed my life a lot I'm so
[1236.18 - 1241.04] over the pain medicine that's so
[1238.34 - 1244.16] unhealthy for me how do I move past it
[1241.04 - 1247.46] and get my healthy life back you're
[1244.16 - 1250.46] working on medical medium information
[1247.46 - 1250.46] foreign
[1251.00 - 1256.16] there's a lot of tools
[1253.22 - 1258.94] that so many people have used here to
[1256.16 - 1258.94] get their lives back
[1259.82 - 1265.48] Cold Light spring
[1261.26 - 1265.48] I I read your comments it's gone up now
[1267.08 - 1269.26] um
[1270.98 - 1274.76] they contacted the journalist right
[1272.54 - 1276.20] before brain saver I bet that book was
[1274.76 - 1278.72] the target
[1276.20 - 1281.78] but the journalists spent so much time
[1278.72 - 1285.46] writing and questioning what he was fed
[1281.78 - 1285.46] so they only delayed this one
[1286.76 - 1288.76] um
[1290.66 - 1294.56] your soul also stores your hope and your
[1293.00 - 1295.82] faith in your trust so that I want to
[1294.56 - 1297.44] talk about a little bit have you ever
[1295.82 - 1299.84] had your trust broken
[1297.44 - 1302.36] just broken
[1299.84 - 1306.38] never had your faith
[1302.36 - 1308.48] really tested really test it
[1306.38 - 1310.16] you trust your faith your hope
[1308.48 - 1313.70] crashed
[1310.16 - 1316.16] crushed and smashed
[1313.70 - 1320.32] your soul stores your hope your faith
[1316.16 - 1320.32] and your trust stores it
[1321.62 - 1326.48] all of which help keep you on the right
[1324.32 - 1328.10] path that's a mechanism that helps to
[1326.48 - 1330.46] keep us strong and keep us on the right
[1328.10 - 1330.46] path
[1331.34 - 1336.32] ideally
[1333.62 - 1338.36] we would have fully intact Souls over
[1336.32 - 1341.36] the course of life's hardships though a
[1338.36 - 1342.74] soul can become fractured a soul can
[1341.36 - 1344.18] become fractured have you ever met
[1342.74 - 1347.90] anyone where
[1344.18 - 1350.48] if you use your intuitive capabilities
[1347.90 - 1353.36] and intuitive strengths
[1350.48 - 1355.04] you can almost
[1353.36 - 1358.28] kind of like
[1355.04 - 1361.10] just see it and understand that the
[1358.28 - 1365.50] other person might have some fractures
[1361.10 - 1365.50] they get triggered they're struggling
[1370.46 - 1374.00] this can be caused by traumatic events
[1372.56 - 1375.98] such as the death of a loved one
[1374.00 - 1378.92] betrayal by a loved one betrayal by
[1375.98 - 1381.14] oneself as well as ongoing traumas such
[1378.92 - 1383.18] as the loss of freedom and trust that
[1381.14 - 1384.74] comes with experiencing chronic illness
[1383.18 - 1387.62] and symptoms so I want to go into that a
[1384.74 - 1390.32] little bit when we get sick we then lose
[1387.62 - 1393.82] faith in a lot of things we lose faith
[1390.32 - 1396.50] in the pharmaceutical industry for one
[1393.82 - 1400.00] people have chronic illness they lose
[1396.50 - 1400.00] faith in the pharmaceutical industry
[1401.24 - 1406.10] medicine
[1402.86 - 1408.22] in medical science has a lot to offer
[1406.10 - 1410.66] life-saving surgeries
[1408.22 - 1415.30] life-saving procedures
[1410.66 - 1415.30] but there's this whole massive massive
[1415.94 - 1420.80] swath of people
[1417.86 - 1422.24] that suffer from chronic symptoms and
[1420.80 - 1424.52] conditions
[1422.24 - 1426.38] and they suffer greatly and they haven't
[1424.52 - 1428.00] been able to find answers and they feel
[1426.38 - 1429.92] like their body has let them down they
[1428.00 - 1431.66] feel like their body's shutting down
[1429.92 - 1432.98] they feel like
[1431.66 - 1435.14] um
[1432.98 - 1438.26] they can't get better and they've tried
[1435.14 - 1441.64] everything and they've done everything
[1438.26 - 1441.64] that's really hard for people
[1444.26 - 1449.42] when Soul injuries are fresh they can
[1446.36 - 1451.70] result in feeling
[1449.42 - 1453.08] of being lost
[1451.70 - 1455.24] just reading the book a little bit if
[1453.08 - 1457.04] you guys want to know which one it is by

[1516.14 - 1520.40] of Desire inspiration
[1517.94 - 1524.06] to preserve or thrive
[1520.40 - 1526.22] persevere or or Thrive or even loss of
[1524.06 - 1528.32] life force and that's what happens too
[1526.22 - 1530.18] when we just get broken down and beaten
[1528.32 - 1533.12] down we feel like we don't have our life
[1530.18 - 1536.08] force anymore we feel like we've lost
[1533.12 - 1536.08] our life force
[1540.80 - 1545.96] and then wounds from hardship betrayal
[1543.80 - 1547.70] and broken trust or emotional hurt often
[1545.96 - 1549.38] exhaust the person's immune systems
[1547.70 - 1551.00] that's another thing too like it's like
[1549.38 - 1553.76] I can't tell you how many times I've
[1551.00 - 1556.76] seen with relationship breakups
[1553.76 - 1556.76] foreign
[1557.08 - 1564.02] those relationship breakups
[1560.42 - 1565.82] people's immune system just tanks
[1564.02 - 1567.68] it's like one too many relationship
[1565.82 - 1569.72] breakups and their immune system just
[1567.68 - 1572.24] gets so low
[1569.72 - 1574.04] because it's exhausting especially if
[1572.24 - 1575.66] you're staying up all night you're not
[1574.04 - 1579.02] sleeping good you're tossing and turning
[1575.66 - 1581.66] you feel hurt you feel that pit in your
[1579.02 - 1586.66] stomach and this can drop down our
[1581.66 - 1586.66] immune systems and defense defenses

[1675.80 - 1681.26] crispy perspective over there on YouTube
[1679.76 - 1682.70] been feeling so stressed from

[1685.34 - 1689.00] sprouted up
[1686.78 - 1690.98] Sleep Quality went down so what happens
[1689.00 - 1693.38] is when we have relationship problems
[1690.98 - 1696.92] and we have breakups our immune system
[1693.38 - 1699.08] drops it drops down when our immune
[1696.92 - 1702.20] system drops down what happens you guys
[1699.08 - 1705.50] is that when it drops down other things
[1702.20 - 1707.36] rise up so our immune system
[1705.50 - 1709.10] other things could rise up what are
[1707.36 - 1711.44] other things well streptococcus that's
[1709.10 - 1713.96] behind acne
[1711.44 - 1716.18] other things can rise up UTIs straight
[1713.96 - 1718.10] that strap that streptococcal and UTIs
[1716.18 - 1721.00] boom
[1718.10 - 1721.00] it's another one too
[1721.94 - 1725.54] fatigue can start up after breakups
[1723.92 - 1727.22] because immune system lowers and then
[1725.54 - 1729.70] everybody's Epstein bar just starts to
[1727.22 - 1729.70] rise up
[1734.48 - 1739.34] sometimes a person's soul injury
[1736.94 - 1741.38] and resulting emotional state isn't a
[1739.34 - 1743.06] physical problem yet symptoms often take
[1741.38 - 1746.00] time to build quietly in the background
[1743.06 - 1748.28] so a soul injury at an earlier time in
[1746.00 - 1750.38] life could be the trigger for future
[1748.28 - 1752.72] symptoms of full-blown conditions to
[1750.38 - 1754.94] come we're talking about that now if you
[1752.72 - 1757.16] don't have the right knowledge and tools
[1754.94 - 1759.38] and resources to take care of your soul
[1757.16 - 1762.64] and physical body we can get in trouble
[1759.38 - 1762.64] that's how it works
[1764.18 - 1768.68] let's be clear emotional wounds and soul
[1767.12 - 1769.94] wounds are not the reason for physical
[1768.68 - 1774.62] suffering
[1769.94 - 1776.60] big triggers though big triggers
[1774.62 - 1778.94] for underlying susceptibilities which
[1776.60 - 1781.16] everybody has
[1778.94 - 1782.72] which are caused by pathogens poisons
[1781.16 - 1785.00] were up against in the world and heavy
[1782.72 - 1788.30] metals that's an example it's a poison
[1785.00 - 1790.70] but you are not weak you are not weak
[1788.30 - 1792.68] regardless and you're not weak just
[1790.70 - 1794.54] because you're chronically sick you're
[1792.68 - 1797.18] still not weak strongest people I've
[1794.54 - 1799.28] ever seen and let me go into this part
[1797.18 - 1802.66] this is important please if you guys
[1799.28 - 1802.66] have a second to listen to this
[1802.88 - 1806.18] you know how
[1804.92 - 1808.28] strong
[1806.18 - 1809.42] people who have chronic illness really
[1808.28 - 1813.16] are
[1809.42 - 1813.16] people who have been sick for years
[1813.20 - 1816.16] they're strong
[1816.80 - 1821.96] I can guarantee you
[1820.22 - 1825.26] that if you take someone who's an
[1821.96 - 1827.60] athlete maybe a professional athlete in
[1825.26 - 1830.90] football or basketball or
[1827.60 - 1834.58] professional swimmer or something right
[1830.90 - 1834.58] and they get chronic illness
[1835.40 - 1840.62] screaming like a baby
[1837.50 - 1842.60] screaming and screaming like a baby
[1840.62 - 1845.54] can't handle it for more than six months
[1842.60 - 1847.04] can't handle it for more than two months
[1845.54 - 1848.96] there's people out there who are
[1847.04 - 1850.64] chronically sick for five six years bent
[1848.96 - 1852.62] every doctor been to everything they've
[1850.64 - 1854.84] been through hell and back but they're
[1852.62 - 1857.30] strong really strong they may not seem
[1854.84 - 1859.22] strong they can't run a marathon but
[1857.30 - 1860.72] then you take somebody who's been strong
[1859.22 - 1862.70] their whole life
[1860.72 - 1865.66] they run marathons and everything and
[1862.70 - 1869.30] they finally get sick they are
[1865.66 - 1871.46] screaming bloody murder
[1869.30 - 1873.26] because they can't take it for a minute
[1871.46 - 1875.36] because it's it's stopping them from
[1873.26 - 1877.10] doing what they want to do and and feel
[1875.36 - 1879.80] and be indestructible and they can't
[1877.10 - 1881.54] handle it there's it's amazing how it
[1879.80 - 1884.00] works the most
[1881.54 - 1885.92] strongest people I've ever known are
[1884.00 - 1888.62] people that have been through it and
[1885.92 - 1891.50] they understand and they've been sick
[1888.62 - 1893.36] clear done on YouTube says Bend to hell
[1891.50 - 1895.58] and back you bet
[1893.36 - 1899.00] on IG
[1895.58 - 1901.46] fearing fearing a woman says I've lost
[1899.00 - 1904.10] my husband July 4th and I can't eat
[1901.46 - 1906.02] sleep or manage to have the energy to do
[1904.10 - 1907.82] anything in the house all I do is cry
[1906.02 - 1909.74] and mourn
[1907.82 - 1912.22] God bless you I'm so sorry you're going
[1909.74 - 1912.22] through that
[1918.26 - 1921.44] a person with a soul injury is
[1920.12 - 1923.54] vulnerable
[1921.44 - 1925.82] if you ever hear a friend say I'm not
[1923.54 - 1929.06] ready for another relationship
[1925.82 - 1931.64] I'm still hurting from my breakup
[1929.06 - 1934.40] she's acknowledging that her soul needs
[1931.64 - 1937.52] time to heal before the risks
[1934.40 - 1940.52] of putting herself into the firing line
[1937.52 - 1943.46] again right so a lot of people
[1940.52 - 1947.98] you know their Soul's been injured you
[1943.46 - 1947.98] know they've been hurt
[1948.14 - 1951.74] and they're like I can't I can't get
[1949.94 - 1953.66] into another relationship I can't start
[1951.74 - 1956.24] another relationship
[1953.66 - 1959.42] I'm not ready because I can't handle it
[1956.24 - 1961.64] because I've been hurt really bad and I
[1959.42 - 1963.86] need to be careful and I need to take my
[1961.64 - 1966.46] time and I need to do some healing and
[1963.86 - 1966.46] rebuilding
[1967.52 - 1971.30] along the same lines if you've ever
[1969.50 - 1973.46] observed someone who's sick with
[1971.30 - 1976.16] symptoms or a condition and hasn't been
[1973.46 - 1978.26] able to find answers you may see this
[1976.16 - 1980.36] person hungrily pursuing spiritual
[1978.26 - 1982.52] learning in any form religion spiritual
[1980.36 - 1985.10] gurus self-help books meditation
[1982.52 - 1987.62] Retreats breath work it's likely because
[1985.10 - 1990.80] that person's soul has been injured from
[1987.62 - 1993.32] all of the trust lost along the way and
[1990.80 - 1995.60] he or she is instinctively searching for
[1993.32 - 1998.38] ways to make the soul healthy and
[1995.60 - 1998.38] complete again
[2000.64 - 2005.28] it's incredible information Marie says
[2002.56 - 2005.28] which book is this
[2006.10 - 2012.52] which page am I on
[2009.58 - 2015.52] page 394
[2012.52 - 2015.52] 394.
[2019.84 - 2024.46] sometimes soul-searching will bring
[2021.76 - 2026.14] people closer to themselves many times
[2024.46 - 2029.56] it will leave them feeling more lost
[2026.14 - 2031.90] than ever under the guise of help
[2029.56 - 2034.00] you may have heard the false theory that
[2031.90 - 2035.92] illness is just a cry for attention have
[2034.00 - 2038.08] you ever heard that where you're just
[2035.92 - 2040.18] crying for attention you're not sick
[2038.08 - 2043.30] you were never sick you're crying for
[2040.18 - 2044.86] attention you're asking for help you're
[2043.30 - 2046.48] asking for attention because you're not
[2044.86 - 2048.70] sick
[2046.48 - 2050.74] you may have heard the false theory that
[2048.70 - 2052.36] illness is just a cry for attention you
[2050.74 - 2055.06] may have heard that when bad things
[2052.36 - 2056.92] happen to us we cause them by thinking
[2055.06 - 2059.92] the wrong thoughts or that someone
[2056.92 - 2062.80] something about who you are as a person
[2059.92 - 2064.36] is wrong you've heard that too right you
[2062.80 - 2065.80] caused your illness that's what you hear
[2064.36 - 2067.42] out there that's what a lot of people
[2065.80 - 2069.82] talk about it's spiritual movement it's
[2067.42 - 2072.28] really bad I have to be honest
[2069.82 - 2073.66] that's the one thing actually one out of
[2072.28 - 2076.12] many things in the spiritual movement
[2073.66 - 2077.52] out there that I I think is really
[2076.12 - 2080.62] messed up
[2077.52 - 2082.12] anna-lysa Phipps says Anthony is there a
[2080.62 - 2084.82] way to tell when you're dealing with
[2082.12 - 2087.40] pure evil versus brain toxins
[2084.82 - 2089.80] there definitely is pure evil out there
[2087.40 - 2092.44] I will not
[2089.80 - 2093.70] deny that
[2092.44 - 2096.52] I don't know if you ever hear my
[2093.70 - 2098.92] telegram messages ever have you guys
[2096.52 - 2101.32] are you guys on my Telegram
[2098.92 - 2102.76] page
[2101.32 - 2103.78] I don't know if you ever heard me talk
[2102.76 - 2105.22] on there
[2103.78 - 2106.72] it's a lot of fork tongue out there
[2105.22 - 2108.76] there's a lot of dark
[2106.72 - 2111.82] Ness out there's a lot of people that
[2108.76 - 2113.22] have obviously dark intentions there's a
[2111.82 - 2116.52] lot of Darkness out there in the world
[2113.22 - 2116.52] it's true
[2116.68 - 2119.98] if we walk around and pretend there is
[2118.42 - 2121.72] no darkness and we walk around and
[2119.98 - 2123.88] pretend there's nothing dark out there
[2121.72 - 2126.64] going on
[2123.88 - 2128.80] if we walk out if we walk around and
[2126.64 - 2130.54] pretend nothing bad's happening or
[2128.80 - 2132.46] really in some kind of crazy bubble
[2130.54 - 2134.44] because that's not reality
[2132.46 - 2136.66] and another thing too not everything is
[2134.44 - 2138.34] a lesson
[2136.66 - 2140.86] to be learned
[2138.34 - 2142.12] meaning when darkness occurs right it's
[2140.86 - 2143.98] not that you're supposed to learn a
[2142.12 - 2146.14] lesson because darkness is attacking you
[2143.98 - 2148.42] it's not really that you're trying to go
[2146.14 - 2152.76] about your business and do good things
[2148.42 - 2152.76] in in life and then Darkness attacks
[2155.38 - 2159.28] a lot of people are told that they cause
[2157.48 - 2160.66] their illness upon themselves so in the
[2159.28 - 2162.40] spiritual movement I see that a lot and
[2160.66 - 2165.04] I'm like what
[2162.40 - 2167.14] oh yeah you manifested that sickness you
[2165.04 - 2169.12] must be manifesting wrong that's why
[2167.14 - 2170.62] you're sick you've been to 20 doctors
[2169.12 - 2173.32] and you got neurological problems and
[2170.62 - 2174.82] Tremors and fatigue and your eyes are
[2173.32 - 2177.40] twitching and you've got all kinds of
[2174.82 - 2180.04] different problems you must have you
[2177.40 - 2182.20] must have done that to yourself through
[2180.04 - 2183.94] manifestation you must have manifested
[2182.20 - 2186.22] wrong bad thoughts or something like
[2183.94 - 2187.66] that maybe you're just a bad person and
[2186.22 - 2189.04] you need lots of spiritual growth and
[2187.66 - 2192.00] that's why you have all those crazy
[2189.04 - 2192.00] neurological symptoms
[2192.10 - 2197.38] because you brought it on yourself
[2195.76 - 2199.66] you hear that that's terrible because
[2197.38 - 2202.56] that's not correct Michelle
[2199.66 - 2202.56] Ulrich says aw
[2202.72 - 2209.26] I was a competitive bodybuilder and ran
[2206.08 - 2211.54] half marathons that's incredible when I
[2209.26 - 2213.70] got my autoimmune diagnosis I completely
[2211.54 - 2215.32] healed from the symptoms after
[2213.70 - 2219.10] discovering medical medium information
[2215.32 - 2222.22] it took two and a half years God bless
[2219.10 - 2226.68] you Michelle proud of you too you stuck
[2222.22 - 2226.68] to it even with all the BS out there
[2227.02 - 2232.42] the lies that are out there about
[2229.24 - 2235.42] medical medium the amount of negativity
[2232.42 - 2238.00] the amount of discrimination
[2235.42 - 2240.10] because I hear a voice the amount of all
[2238.00 - 2245.04] of that and you've hung in there for two
[2240.10 - 2245.04] and a half years despite all of that BS
[2245.56 - 2249.06] and cancel culture
[2249.40 - 2255.82] and also what is it called a competitor
[2253.66 - 2257.32] competitor attacks and takedowns out
[2255.82 - 2258.88] there
[2257.32 - 2260.38] because they don't like the fact that
[2258.88 - 2263.62] medical medium is in the health space
[2260.38 - 2265.18] offering free stuff 24 7 including tons
[2263.62 - 2266.62] of information for people to heal so
[2265.18 - 2268.00] competitors are trying to knock out
[2266.62 - 2270.10] medical medium
[2268.00 - 2272.56] and medical medium health health space
[2270.10 - 2273.58] right even with all that going on and
[2272.56 - 2276.46] you hung in there for two and a half
[2273.58 - 2279.34] years incredible

[2475.80 - 2480.40] your heart serves as the compass for
[2478.42 - 2482.98] your actions guiding you to do the right
[2480.40 - 2485.20] thing when your soul becomes lost you
[2482.98 - 2487.00] can have a busted up soul you can have a
[2485.20 - 2488.38] soul that's been through hell and back
[2487.00 - 2491.14] you could have a soul that feels
[2488.38 - 2493.78] fractured you can feel like whoa there's
[2491.14 - 2497.68] nothing left for me to give anymore I
[2493.78 - 2500.94] can't give any more I can't right you

[2501.64 - 2507.04] and your heart
[2503.44 - 2510.64] will be the compass your heart will

[2514.36 - 2519.76] because even if your soul is busted up
[2517.06 - 2523.62] pretty bad and you feel pretty down and
[2519.76 - 2526.42] you feel pretty beaten down
[2523.62 - 2529.54] your heart will then become that compass
[2526.42 - 2532.54] and help guide you the direction you
[2529.54 - 2535.30] need to be guided
[2532.54 - 2539.70] Alexandra Sophia says the heart's
[2535.30 - 2539.70] guidance is always right on point
[2545.86 - 2551.14] your heart is also a kind your your
[2549.04 - 2553.60] heart
[2551.14 - 2556.60] is also a safety net
[2553.60 - 2559.06] that can compensate for soul injury this
[2556.60 - 2561.34] means you can have a tattered soul and a
[2559.06 - 2563.44] warm loving heart how many people out
[2561.34 - 2566.38] there have a warm loving heart
[2563.44 - 2567.70] regardless of all the crap they went
[2566.38 - 2569.98] through
[2567.70 - 2574.00] how many people have that where they
[2569.98 - 2576.28] still have a warm loving heart
[2574.00 - 2578.32] no matter what how much they've gone
[2576.28 - 2581.20] through no matter how much trust was
[2578.32 - 2584.68] broken no much no matter what occurred
[2581.20 - 2586.18] betrayal they still have a kind loving
[2584.68 - 2588.46] heart
[2586.18 - 2590.74] I never give up on people
[2588.46 - 2593.44] I never give up on people
[2590.74 - 2597.58] even if I there's
[2593.44 - 2599.86] then say stabbed in the back by somebody
[2597.58 - 2601.30] that I know
[2599.86 - 2603.34] because
[2601.30 - 2605.88] they wanted something out of me and I
[2603.34 - 2605.88] said no
[2605.92 - 2609.70] even with something like that I still
[2608.26 - 2611.14] don't go on the next day saying I'm
[2609.70 - 2613.42] never going to trust a single person
[2611.14 - 2614.92] again after that
[2613.42 - 2617.92] I don't do that
[2614.92 - 2621.04] I trust again and I trust again and I
[2617.92 - 2623.08] trust again that's what I do and I keep
[2621.04 - 2626.22] trusting and I keep on moving forward
[2623.08 - 2626.22] that's what I do
[2628.66 - 2633.46] when your soul suffers fractures and
[2631.48 - 2634.36] losses a strong heart will get you
[2633.46 - 2638.08] through
[2634.36 - 2640.72] with Selfless Love compassion and joy
[2638.08 - 2642.70] until your soul has managed to heal it's
[2640.72 - 2645.58] like the heart takes over your heart
[2642.70 - 2647.14] takes over while your soul is healing
[2645.58 - 2651.42] I like that
[2647.14 - 2651.42] I love that it comes from the heart

[2719.14 - 2722.62] summer of healing that's why we did the
[2720.76 - 2726.22] light blast that's why we're doing the
[2722.62 - 2728.62] collecting Stones meditation Journey
[2726.22 - 2732.34] Hannah T says why does God send people
[2728.62 - 2735.04] into our Lives who keep betraying us
[2732.34 - 2737.98] is our job to give people chances over
[2735.04 - 2741.70] and over love unconditionally
[2737.98 - 2745.80] look I'll tell you something
[2741.70 - 2745.80] it's not God doing that
[2751.06 - 2755.88] you guys are incredible it's been an
[2753.52 - 2755.88] honor
[2757.20 - 2761.98] renata144aw if the heart is hurt can
[2759.64 - 2764.70] that block someone from tuning in with
[2761.98 - 2764.70] their intuition
[2765.00 - 2769.96] it's the heart emotionally hurt
[2767.20 - 2771.88] physically hurt
[2769.96 - 2773.86] two different things
[2771.88 - 2775.72] but our heart either way is still that
[2773.86 - 2780.48] Beacon no matter what even if it's
[2775.72 - 2780.48] injured physically it's still the beacon
[2780.52 - 2784.08] kind of Lights the way
[2784.36 - 2789.52] now there are people out there that have
[2785.92 - 2793.60] cold dark Hearts I mean that does exist
[2789.52 - 2795.22] where they have cold dark hearts
[2793.60 - 2797.74] there is that term heartless and it
[2795.22 - 2800.08] actually is real unfortunately there are
[2797.74 - 2803.28] some heartless people out there it
[2800.08 - 2803.28] exists on this planet
[2804.40 - 2811.62] Darkness can take over people and
[2807.82 - 2811.62] completely corrupt their heart
[2812.92 - 2817.66] and then genocide occurs
[2815.62 - 2820.20] in so many different levels on so many
[2817.66 - 2820.20] different ways
[2820.48 - 2823.86] in so many different ways
[2824.44 - 2829.00] so that does happen there's some evil
[2826.72 - 2831.28] people on the planet and then toxic
[2829.00 - 2834.10] heavy metals can affect people too
[2831.28 - 2837.82] in so many different ways
[2834.10 - 2841.78] but even with that really there are just
[2837.82 - 2844.90] some serious evil people on the planet
[2841.78 - 2847.78] that do just heartless cruel things and
[2844.90 - 2850.54] Despicable things
[2847.78 - 2855.18] it's horrible and don't have a care in
[2850.54 - 2855.18] the world about human race or suffering
[2860.80 - 2866.50] this has really been an incredible
[2863.98 - 2867.76] um fun discussion you guys
[2866.50 - 2869.68] so I just want to give you one more
[2867.76 - 2873.24] reminder don't miss out on the
[2869.68 - 2873.24] collecting Stones meditation Journey
[2873.28 - 2877.78] as you clean up your body physically
[2875.26 - 2879.88] with for example like the medical medium
[2877.78 - 2882.16] tools cleans up people's bodies
[2879.88 - 2884.02] physically intuition gets stronger and
[2882.16 - 2886.72] stronger and stronger
[2884.02 - 2889.20] intuition gets stronger and stronger and
[2886.72 - 2889.20] stronger
[2890.74 - 2894.78] and then these Revelations and then
[2892.48 - 2899.38] these epiphanies and then these
[2894.78 - 2903.52] realizations come and then
[2899.38 - 2907.30] incredible references occur
[2903.52 - 2909.70] but people also have free will
[2907.30 - 2911.92] and they can be persuaded and
[2909.70 - 2913.90] brainwashed very easily out there so
[2911.92 - 2916.12] people have free will
[2913.90 - 2919.78] and Free Will can
[2916.12 - 2921.70] be the greatest thing ever
[2919.78 - 2925.92] and it can also get us in trouble of
[2921.70 - 2925.92] course and we can be persuaded
[2928.90 - 2933.36] seeing interesting comments from you
[2930.64 - 2933.36] guys everywhere
[2933.58 - 2937.66] the thing is is that with Spirit of
[2935.98 - 2938.56] compassion I tend to ask a lot of
[2937.66 - 2941.44] questions
[2938.56 - 2945.52] to SOC and
[2941.44 - 2947.80] I could probably do just in 10 hour live
[2945.52 - 2950.68] every day
[2947.80 - 2955.74] and we can go into places that
[2950.68 - 2955.74] answer a lot of questions spiritual wise
[2956.74 - 2960.30] and it would be mind-blowing
[2961.60 - 2964.96] but I'll try to get it all in the
[2963.40 - 2967.86] spiritual book if I could ever get to it
[2964.96 - 2967.86] I love you guys
[2967.90 - 2972.28] and uh
