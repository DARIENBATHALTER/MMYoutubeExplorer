[0.08 - 4.76] hello it's Anthony William medical
[1.84 - 8.00] medium great to be here at autoimmune
[4.76 - 10.36] answers live webinar and uh thank you
[8.00 - 13.08] for being here uh absolutely this is
[10.36 - 14.48] really exciting it's important because
[13.08 - 18.40] when it comes down to our health there's
[14.48 - 20.56] some pitfalls and things in our way
[18.40 - 23.60] barriers and other things that if we
[20.56 - 26.40] don't learn about it's hard to get past
[23.60 - 29.52] our conditions or symptoms or illnesses
[26.40 - 31.12] so when it comes to Healing information
[29.52 - 34.16] means everything now the information
[31.12 - 37.64] you're going to learn on the webinar and
[34.16 - 40.00] and you know our future webinars and uh
[37.64 - 41.44] the webinars of the past the information
[40.00 - 42.92] you're going to learn it's it's
[41.44 - 44.64] important to know where it's coming from
[42.92 - 48.88] it's coming from a Pure untampered
[44.64 - 51.44] Source a clean source and if you're
[48.88 - 53.96] someone who just you know you never knew
[51.44 - 57.08] who I was or you don't know my story or
[53.96 - 59.88] history um what that means is is that I
[57.08 - 62.12] was given a gift since childhood start
[59.88 - 63.68] started with the age four at age four
[62.12 - 66.12] and I was given a gift to hear a voice
[63.68 - 68.08] perfectly clear to provide a clean
[66.12 - 71.96] source of information help out people
[68.08 - 75.80] have dedicated my entire life to decades
[71.96 - 77.60] and decades now to helping people heal
[75.80 - 79.28] um and overcome their illnesses and get
[77.60 - 80.48] the answers they need and I'm saying
[79.28 - 81.92] this because it's important to
[80.48 - 84.04] understand the information here doesn't
[81.92 - 86.60] come from interest groups or medical
[84.04 - 89.12] funding with strings attached or botched
[86.60 - 91.76] research with lobbyists medical
[89.12 - 94.88] lobbyists inter Al Kickbacks persuaded
[91.76 - 96.76] belief systems persuaded belief systems
[94.88 - 99.48] that's serious private panels of
[96.76 - 101.08] influencers that no one knows about in
[99.48 - 103.68] the world of medicine I'm talking about
[101.08 - 105.96] Alternative Health and health field
[103.68 - 108.00] payoffs both of conventional alternative
[105.96 - 110.72] medicine or trendy traps you know when
[108.00 - 112.32] when you deal with fads and trends that
[110.72 - 114.84] that are out there but they're really
[112.32 - 116.12] sand traps and I'm saying this because
[114.84 - 118.80] it's important to know that the
[116.12 - 121.84] information we're going to cover is not
[118.80 - 125.32] involved in any any of that it's a clear
[121.84 - 126.96] clean source of information and why is
[125.32 - 129.36] this important because I'll tell you why
[126.96 - 131.88] because when and this is you always have
[129.36 - 134.80] to know this the one of the reasons why
[131.88 - 137.12] we're not healing and and why there's
[134.80 - 139.68] hundreds of millions of sick people
[137.12 - 143.16] billions of sick people on planet Earth
[139.68 - 145.52] right now is because we're kept from
[143.16 - 147.76] knowing about certain truths because
[145.52 - 150.12] there's a reason for that there's a big
[147.76 - 152.64] reason for that and I'm going to cover
[150.12 - 155.04] and to go into it a lot deeper and when
[152.64 - 156.72] science and research does their studies
[155.04 - 158.80] both alternative and conventional
[156.72 - 160.68] conventionally there's funding and money
[158.80 - 163.64] behind it and they have to come out and
[160.68 - 165.80] in many ways the studies have to land a
[163.64 - 168.00] certain way they have to land on all
[165.80 - 169.52] four feet and there and many times
[168.00 - 170.84] there's a thumb on the scale if you know
[169.52 - 172.64] what I mean if you know what I'm talking
[170.84 - 174.96] about that thumb on the scale because
[172.64 - 177.32] you don't want to piss off an interest
[174.96 - 179.08] group or somebody's interest somebody's
[177.32 - 180.60] money that went was funded into
[179.08 - 183.84] something and you want to make sure
[180.60 - 186.96] outcomes come out the way they're
[183.84 - 190.08] intended to come out regardless if it's
[186.96 - 192.80] good for you or bad for you and that's
[190.08 - 194.92] the problem even the truths that we have
[192.80 - 198.00] from leading experts right now the
[194.92 - 200.56] information's tampered it's tainted so
[198.00 - 204.80] even good-hearted good-hearted really
[200.56 - 206.68] amazing you know immunologists and and
[204.80 - 208.96] every and different people in the field
[206.68 - 212.08] of medicine whether it's oncologist when
[208.96 - 213.80] it comes down to can or or you know our
[212.08 - 215.64] science and research are best people
[213.80 - 217.20] their hearts in it and our doctor's
[215.64 - 219.76] hearts are in it and we have some
[217.20 - 221.76] amazing things scientifically uh you
[219.76 - 223.52] know discovered now that are helping
[221.76 - 225.04] people but when it comes down to chronic
[223.52 - 226.72] illness it's separated I'm going to tell
[225.04 - 228.16] you right now it's it's an entirely
[226.72 - 230.84] different situation and when it comes
[228.16 - 232.76] down to autoimmune autoimmune disease
[230.84 - 235.24] autoimmune symptoms and conditions and
[232.76 - 238.32] the whole term autoimmune when it comes
[235.24 - 240.48] down to that that's a whole different
[238.32 - 243.52] ballpark from heart surgery that's a
[240.48 - 244.92] whole different ballpark from you know
[243.52 - 246.28] science and research in so many
[244.92 - 249.08] different fields of medicine that are
[246.28 - 253.40] doing incredible things that we that we
[249.08 - 256.00] rely on that we love that we need and
[253.40 - 258.56] but there's there's two two You Know
[256.00 - 261.36] Places there's two places one place is
[258.56 - 263.84] chronic illness and we don't have
[261.36 - 267.00] answers we don't one place is chronic
[263.84 - 268.88] illness the other place is you know uh
[267.00 - 270.48] black and white black and white medicine
[268.88 - 272.32] science and research where it's black
[270.48 - 275.96] and white where we rely on so much of
[272.32 - 278.04] that so and the bottom line is when it
[275.96 - 281.12] comes down to chronic illness and
[278.04 - 282.92] autoimmune and all the different labels
[281.12 - 286.36] that's a different story that's where
[282.92 - 289.52] we're in the dark and the information
[286.36 - 290.68] that is out there is contaminated most
[289.52 - 293.60] of the information out there is
[290.68 - 295.76] contaminated now ho ho ho how can I say
[293.60 - 297.32] that that's a big deal to say it's just
[295.76 - 299.92] the truth and I'm going to cover why
[297.32 - 302.24] it's the truth and how it works and how
[299.92 - 303.64] we can protect you that's the whole
[302.24 - 306.16] point you know when I was given the gift
[303.64 - 308.48] to have this clean source of information
[306.16 - 310.84] a source that isn't persuaded by all the
[308.48 - 312.88] things I just talked about right there
[310.84 - 315.88] and and that's real that stuff I just
[312.88 - 318.12] talked about everything I mentioned is
[315.88 - 319.80] in alternative and conventional medicine
[318.12 - 321.32] both you may say well it's not in
[319.80 - 323.08] alternative medicine that's he's talking
[321.32 - 324.88] about conventional medicine where you
[323.08 - 326.80] got the internal Kickbacks and you know
[324.88 - 328.80] persuaded belief systems private panel
[326.80 - 331.64] influencers Health peel Health peel
[328.80 - 333.08] payoffs and Bot research and strings
[331.64 - 334.56] attached and everything else that must
[333.08 - 336.76] be conventional he's talking about no
[334.56 - 341.12] I'm talking about alternative to
[336.76 - 344.32] absolutely in both fields of medicine
[341.12 - 347.08] when it comes down to chronic illness
[344.32 - 348.44] chronic illness autoimmune chronic
[347.08 - 351.60] illness and
[348.44 - 353.08] autoimmune so and and that we're going
[351.60 - 354.44] to we're going to go into all of it now
[353.08 - 356.52] I really mean it when I say fasten your
[354.44 - 360.68] seat bels because this is going to be a
[356.52 - 363.84] ride um so let's get into it so
[360.68 - 366.96] get ready cuz we're starting now and
[363.84 - 370.04] we're going now if you you know if you
[366.96 - 372.48] live in an apartment you or House or
[370.04 - 373.76] wherever you live kak condo apartment
[372.48 - 376.48] house everybody lives in different
[373.76 - 378.80] places some people just live over you
[376.48 - 380.68] know they live in their their their you
[378.80 - 382.36] know sisters or brothers basement they
[380.68 - 383.64] live wherever they can live you know
[382.36 - 386.24] wherever we
[383.64 - 389.00] live and um or our friend's house or
[386.24 - 392.00] wherever we live and live our life if
[389.00 - 396.56] paint was starting to flake off the
[392.00 - 398.60] walls okay just for some strange reason
[396.56 - 401.60] you know the paint's recent it's meaning
[398.60 - 403.56] the paint is not old it's a new paint
[401.60 - 407.16] but it's starting to flake off the
[403.56 - 409.88] walls and and you call a carpenter and
[407.16 - 411.88] the carpenter comes he says I don't know
[409.88 - 414.80] I don't know why that that paint is
[411.88 - 417.12] flaking off the walls there and then all
[414.80 - 420.00] of a sudden say your ceiling started
[417.12 - 422.40] leaking and it was leaking water
[420.00 - 423.96] but there was no really answer to it
[422.40 - 427.00] because all the piping and all the
[423.96 - 429.20] plumbing seemed fine and it was just
[427.00 - 433.24] okay the plumbing was fine everything
[429.20 - 434.96] was good but the leak was just always
[433.24 - 436.96] there seeping through the
[434.96 - 440.32] ceiling and then the
[436.96 - 442.92] floors the floors started to get weird
[440.32 - 444.80] where they're starting to move a little
[442.92 - 446.68] and the floors were moving because you
[444.80 - 448.92] know it was just kind of
[446.68 - 451.92] crumbling so the apartment you're living
[448.92 - 453.64] in or the house you're living in was
[451.92 - 456.80] kind of falling apart when it's not
[453.64 - 458.72] supposed to be and you got your your
[456.80 - 461.08] Carpenter or contractor whoever in there
[458.72 - 463.48] and they're in there and they're looking
[461.08 - 466.20] at it and they don't know
[463.48 - 468.16] why because it's kind of a mystery it's
[466.20 - 471.32] it's a it's it's a serious mystery
[468.16 - 473.12] because we can't find the water leak so
[471.32 - 476.28] there's no plumbing leaking but yet you
[473.12 - 479.96] got water seeping through the
[476.28 - 481.76] ceiling the floors are crumbling
[479.96 - 483.96] but everything seems to be sturdy
[481.76 - 486.48] underneath there and there's no reason
[483.96 - 489.60] why the floor should be
[486.48 - 491.12] crumbling the walls the paint is flaking
[489.60 - 494.12] off the
[491.12 - 497.36] walls now if the landlord if you're
[494.12 - 499.60] renting and the landlord said look I
[497.36 - 501.28] don't know what this is this is a
[499.60 - 504.76] mystery I don't understand what's
[501.28 - 507.64] happening you got to be doing something
[504.76 - 509.80] wrong so you're living in here what are
[507.64 - 511.72] you doing that's making this happen what
[509.80 - 513.44] are you doing that's making the paint
[511.72 - 515.52] flake off the
[513.44 - 517.72] walls because I don't know why it's
[515.52 - 519.12] flaking off the walls so obviously
[517.72 - 521.64] there's something you're doing I've
[519.12 - 523.08] never seen this before so a landlord
[521.64 - 525.72] would be saying I've never seen this
[523.08 - 528.44] before I've had lots of apartment
[525.72 - 531.64] buildings and I've never seen this
[528.44 - 533.76] happen it's got to be something you're
[531.64 - 536.12] doing and I'll call the carpenter
[533.76 - 538.16] carpenter came down there I says yeah I
[536.12 - 539.84] agree there's no there's no leaks the
[538.16 - 542.48] plumber says there's no leaks leaks the
[539.84 - 546.32] piping looks good but the ceiling's
[542.48 - 549.04] getting wet it's got to be your
[546.32 - 551.00] fault and whether you live in a home or
[549.04 - 551.92] an apartment it's your fault that this
[551.00 - 554.20] is
[551.92 - 556.68] happening now would that make a lot of
[554.20 - 560.24] sense would that make a lot of
[556.68 - 561.52] sense well they don't know what's wrong
[560.24 - 563.48] they don't know what's wrong or what's
[561.52 - 565.16] going on with your house or your your
[563.48 - 568.08] apartment or where you're
[565.16 - 571.16] living so would it be right if it was
[568.08 - 573.40] blamed on you if it's a mystery leak if
[571.16 - 576.44] it's a mystery
[573.40 - 579.08] problem but that's what's happening with
[576.44 - 581.76] autoimmune you start getting
[579.08 - 584.36] symptoms and you can't figure it out you
[581.76 - 586.24] got a mystery rash you got mystery
[584.36 - 588.76] symptoms you got mystery
[586.24 - 592.28] fatigue mystery
[588.76 - 594.60] dizziness and mystery
[592.28 - 596.24] inflammation well it's got to be it's
[594.60 - 598.80] got to be something going on with your
[596.24 - 601.36] body it's got to be you and you're going
[598.80 - 604.68] to be saying well hey it's not my fault
[601.36 - 606.32] I'm not doing anything to create my
[604.68 - 607.72] sickness I don't think I'm living my
[606.32 - 609.40] life and I just started getting sick
[607.72 - 612.80] things started
[609.40 - 615.84] happening but when we have
[612.80 - 618.80] autoimmune we get told something we get
[615.84 - 621.80] told our body is attacking
[618.80 - 624.44] itself that our body is attacking
[621.80 - 629.52] itself that's what we get
[624.44 - 630.72] told so it becomes our fault so miss
[629.52 - 632.32] conditions that happen in our health
[630.72 - 635.84] that happened in your health it happened
[632.32 - 639.60] in your life are they're your
[635.84 - 640.48] fault it's your body's fault that's what
[639.60 - 645.40] we're
[640.48 - 648.92] told and here we are come on now I mean
[645.40 - 650.72] look what year it is look how far we are
[648.92 - 653.00] and look where science and research is
[650.72 - 656.92] look at the technology that's out
[653.00 - 659.52] there and the best the best that can
[656.92 - 661.24] come out right now the best that can
[659.52 - 663.68] come out right now in
[661.24 - 665.56] medicine your body is still attacking
[663.68 - 668.12] itself so autoimmune we're told
[665.56 - 670.64] autoimmune means our body is destroying
[668.12 - 674.64] itself it's going after
[670.64 - 677.40] itself our B's targeting
[674.64 - 680.08] us and that's autoimmune and that's
[677.40 - 682.60] where we are today and you have to think
[680.08 - 684.40] about that I mean is that where you want
[682.60 - 685.72] to be is that where you want to be in
[684.40 - 687.28] your life you want to know your body's
[685.72 - 687.96] attacking itself whether it comes down
[687.28 - 690.64] to
[687.96 - 692.72] Hashimoto's we're told our body is
[690.64 - 695.00] targeting our thyroid
[692.72 - 696.68] tissue so our immune system is screening
[695.00 - 698.20] antibodies antibodies are actually going
[696.68 - 700.56] after our tissue and destroying our
[698.20 - 703.68] cells and destroying our our
[700.56 - 706.72] thyroid our immune system is basically
[703.68 - 709.32] going after and targeting our
[706.72 - 712.96] thyroid when it comes down to
[709.32 - 716.16] Hashimoto is that where you want to be
[712.96 - 717.32] because it's not the truth by the way
[716.16 - 719.92] that's not the
[717.32 - 723.80] truth and it's like that that with exmos
[719.92 - 726.04] orasis it's like that too the body's not
[723.80 - 728.08] attacking the body's not attacking the
[726.04 - 729.84] skin even though the Skin's inflamed the
[728.08 - 732.88] body's not turning against the skin but
[729.84 - 735.80] we're told that systemic
[732.88 - 737.44] lupus we're inflamed throughout the body
[735.80 - 740.40] mysteriously inflamed throughout the
[737.44 - 743.36] body we're told our body's attacking
[740.40 - 745.84] itself that's what lupus is it's an
[743.36 - 747.20] autoimmune problem and we're going to
[745.84 - 748.36] cover a whole bunch of different things
[747.20 - 750.68] whole bunch of different illnesses and
[748.36 - 753.40] autoimmune this is as we're in
[750.68 - 755.24] here cuz this is a big deal look I take
[753.40 - 757.96] this serious I take autoimmune so
[755.24 - 760.32] serious it's it's it's I mean I really
[757.96 - 762.48] really really take it to heart I take it
[760.32 - 764.76] personally I take it
[762.48 - 767.56] seriously when it comes to Healing our
[764.76 - 770.20] health I'm going to tell you right now
[767.56 - 772.32] that if you believe your body is
[770.20 - 776.12] attacking
[772.32 - 780.36] itself you got a barrier in your way a
[776.12 - 783.12] major barrier in your way
[780.36 - 786.68] a huge barrier in your way so when it
[783.12 - 788.80] comes to our healing our health I'm
[786.68 - 791.88] going to tell you right now and if you
[788.80 - 795.56] believe your body is attacking itself on
[791.88 - 797.88] any level and there's no
[795.56 - 800.00] cure it's a huge
[797.88 - 801.32] barrier we can talk to the leading
[800.00 - 803.16] experts and they say well there's no
[801.32 - 806.40] cure to autoimmune we can just control
[803.16 - 809.04] it there's no cure to autoimmune that's
[806.40 - 811.48] not true the problem is nobody knows
[809.04 - 813.00] what autoimmune is they don't know what
[811.48 - 815.28] it's caused they don't know what these
[813.00 - 816.88] symptoms and conditions and these labels
[815.28 - 818.48] that are given to
[816.88 - 822.88] people
[818.48 - 826.08] ra you know systemic lupus Ms Celiac fgo
[822.88 - 829.48] alcia psoriasis colitis Hashimoto
[826.08 - 833.04] Addison's Graves disease Su disease type
[829.48 - 836.08] 1 diabetes hepatitis A B C
[833.04 - 839.36] D sertic
[836.08 - 841.80] arthritis and it goes on and on
[839.36 - 844.16] they don't know what's causing those
[841.80 - 847.00] conditions those conditions get
[844.16 - 848.60] labels because of the different symptoms
[847.00 - 851.08] and the different you know things that
[848.60 - 855.60] people are going through they get
[851.08 - 858.36] labels but it's all a mystery complete
[855.60 - 860.36] mystery so what science and research
[858.36 - 861.84] chalks it up to when it comes down to
[860.36 - 863.80] Healing your health it's your body
[861.84 - 866.08] attacking itself and that's what it is
[863.80 - 869.12] and there's no cure and that's where we
[866.08 - 871.64] are right now in this time in history
[869.12 - 875.84] when you would think we would be so far
[871.64 - 877.04] along and so further into healing than
[875.84 - 880.68] ever
[877.04 - 883.32] before and we're not I was told by my
[880.68 - 885.68] source when I was a child that you're
[883.32 - 888.96] going to see some things
[885.68 - 890.32] happen and I said what does that mean
[888.96 - 892.80] and spirit said you're going to see some
[890.32 - 893.80] things happening I said what spirit says
[892.80 - 896.16] you're going to see people getting
[893.80 - 898.24] sicker and sicker and sicker and and and
[896.16 - 899.84] I'll tell you right now when I look back
[898.24 - 902.16] from Child childhood to now it's
[899.84 - 904.32] unbelievable of what's
[902.16 - 906.44] happening and how many people are
[904.32 - 908.92] suffering from symptoms if you look at
[906.44 - 911.32] how many people are in the US alone just
[908.92 - 913.92] say three roughly 325 million or
[911.32 - 916.48] whatever it is 325 million people in the
[913.92 - 919.92] US alone
[916.48 - 922.60] 280 of them are dealing with real
[919.92 - 927.20] symptoms and
[922.60 - 929.64] conditions 20 million more are dealing
[927.20 - 933.08] with some kind of symptom that's also a
[929.64 - 935.92] mystery there's virtually 10 or 20
[933.08 - 939.40] million people only in the
[935.92 - 941.24] US that are not seeing too many symptoms
[939.40 - 942.72] meaning symptoms that come and go here
[941.24 - 946.44] and there depending on what it is and
[942.72 - 949.40] really have okay enough Health we are at
[946.44 - 952.08] a place and time that's unbelievable in
[949.40 - 954.64] history never
[952.08 - 956.24] before and one of the biggest problems
[954.64 - 959.20] and one of the biggest barriers in the
[956.24 - 962.44] way is it's all going to be chalked up
[959.20 - 963.92] to autoimmune one way or another that's
[962.44 - 966.20] where it's going to be chalked up to and
[963.92 - 969.16] it's going to be
[966.20 - 971.68] also right in front of everybody where
[969.16 - 973.64] it's your body's fault it's your body's
[971.68 - 976.44] fault your body's letting you down it's
[973.64 - 977.88] your fault that's what's going wrong
[976.44 - 979.36] that's what's happening your body is
[977.88 - 980.76] destroying itself so when it comes down
[979.36 - 982.36] to our healing and our health I'm going
[980.76 - 984.56] to tell you right now if you believe
[982.36 - 988.20] your body's attacking itself and there's
[984.56 - 991.04] no cure that's a massive barrier in your
[988.20 - 992.68] way we're going to crush that barrier
[991.04 - 994.24] destroy that barrier we're going to
[992.68 - 995.80] knock it down we're going to push it
[994.24 - 997.84] down in the ground we're going to clear
[995.80 - 999.48] the way for you because if we don't
[997.84 - 1001.88] clear the way for
[999.48 - 1004.76] you whether you're getting benefits or
[1001.88 - 1006.36] not from from an expert anywhere or
[1004.76 - 1008.48] whatever it's still going to be in the
[1006.36 - 1011.24] back of your mind and it becomes poison
[1008.48 - 1014.36] I'm going to tell you right now that
[1011.24 - 1017.28] it's poison and it's injected into our
[1014.36 - 1020.00] thinking into our thoughts into our
[1017.28 - 1022.92] beings into our
[1020.00 - 1027.92] Souls is what it
[1022.92 - 1030.56] is we live inside our body just like
[1027.92 - 1032.96] when we live inside our apartment or our
[1030.56 - 1034.80] house you have to understand something
[1032.96 - 1036.48] when you're living in your house and
[1034.80 - 1038.12] paint's peeling off the walls and
[1036.48 - 1040.08] leaking ceilings are happening and
[1038.12 - 1041.64] there's no real answers and you're stuck
[1040.08 - 1044.40] inside of it and someone's telling you
[1041.64 - 1046.60] that it's your fault or it's your your
[1044.40 - 1049.92] you know it's
[1046.60 - 1051.96] literally yeah it's your fault
[1049.92 - 1057.52] and there's no
[1051.96 - 1061.56] answers then that's bad enough but see
[1057.52 - 1064.80] when it's our body itself and our soul
[1061.56 - 1069.36] resides inside our
[1064.80 - 1073.60] body okay our soul resides inside our
[1069.36 - 1075.84] body and we're told our soul is told
[1073.60 - 1077.48] that's your that's your thinking right
[1075.84 - 1080.12] there big part of your thinking your
[1077.48 - 1082.92] soul and you're told hey no it's it's
[1080.12 - 1084.80] your listen it's your body attacking
[1082.92 - 1086.40] creating anybody's it's your body

[1086.40 - 1090.08] thyroid these Auto antibodies attacking
[1088.92 - 1092.76] the
[1090.08 - 1094.40] thyroid and and we're you know we're
[1092.76 - 1096.00] going to do a whole you know leading
[1094.40 - 1098.04] experts in thyroid are going to say oh
[1096.00 - 1100.24] it's triggers we're going to do the
[1098.04 - 1101.68] triggers and and we're going to do
[1100.24 - 1104.12] things you'll start feeling better sure
[1101.68 - 1105.84] and some people do because they take
[1104.12 - 1107.80] away gluten and they take away things
[1105.84 - 1110.40] and they start taking care of themselves
[1107.80 - 1112.20] and they start seeing differences we're
[1110.40 - 1114.80] going to talk about
[1112.20 - 1117.64] why but you still have in the back of
[1114.80 - 1119.36] your mind outdated information I'm going

[1125.68 - 1129.08] general still believe the body's
[1127.92 - 1131.80] attacking itself they just think
[1129.08 - 1134.64] triggers are are are telling the body to
[1131.80 - 1136.64] attack itself and that's not
[1134.64 - 1138.16] true and they believe the body's
[1136.64 - 1139.76] attacking self so no matter what even if

[1139.76 - 1142.44] experts I'm going to tell you right now

[1142.44 - 1145.88] going to creep up and cause problems
[1144.20 - 1147.88] because it's in there it's injected like

[1155.00 - 1159.52] mess you up it's going to mess you up
[1157.32 - 1161.56] over time somewhere someway down the
[1159.52 - 1163.24] line with your autoimmune with your
[1161.56 - 1165.32] Celiac with your viilo with your
[1163.24 - 1166.96] alopecia with your psoriasis and eczema
[1165.32 - 1168.56] with your Colitis with your Hashim modus
[1166.96 - 1171.40] with your Addison with your Graves which

[1171.40 - 1177.96] with your lanceros with your aers dangel
[1175.08 - 1180.96] syndrome it's going to mess you up along
[1177.96 - 1183.48] the way one way or another and that
[1180.96 - 1185.40] poison has to be extracted from you
[1183.48 - 1188.32] literally extract it from you spirit
[1185.40 - 1192.60] said to me today when you do this live
[1188.32 - 1196.44] webinar you make sure somehow some way
[1192.60 - 1198.96] with all you have in you Anthony William
[1196.44 - 1201.12] you let people know the body is not
[1198.96 - 1203.84] destroying itself because whether they
[1201.12 - 1206.20] realize it or not it is out there the
[1203.84 - 1208.68] information is out there and it is
[1206.20 - 1211.44] poison and it seeps into us when we deal
[1208.68 - 1214.28] with anything autoimmune the term
[1211.44 - 1216.80] autoimmune itself is that poisonous
[1214.28 - 1219.16] because it means turning against you
[1216.80 - 1221.48] that's what it means and spirit said you
[1219.16 - 1222.28] better get everybody right on this you
[1221.48 - 1224.96] just
[1222.28 - 1227.72] better and I said I I'll do everything I
[1224.96 - 1229.96] can I said I'll do everything I can
[1227.72 - 1232.28] everything I
[1229.96 - 1234.12] can so if you're told by the latest
[1232.28 - 1235.56] experts in the in the health world and
[1234.12 - 1238.04] books and internet and everything else
[1235.56 - 1239.60] that autoimmune is still attacking still
[1238.04 - 1241.24] autoimmune is still you know your body
[1239.60 - 1243.08] is still in autoimmune but hey look
[1241.24 - 1245.08] let's eliminate triggers and and get you
[1243.08 - 1246.68] in the right way so you can do better
[1245.08 - 1248.52] and get past it it's still not good
[1246.68 - 1250.40] enough it's still not good enough is
[1248.52 - 1252.36] what I'm telling you and that's the
[1250.40 - 1253.92] difference right there in what I meant
[1252.36 - 1255.24] at the beginning no interest groups and
[1253.92 - 1256.80] medical funding with strings attached
[1255.24 - 1258.52] and everything else of Bot research and
[1256.80 - 1260.00] kickbacks and persuaded beliefs systems
[1258.52 - 1262.52] I meant it because what I'm trying to
[1260.00 - 1264.60] tell you guys right now is that is
[1262.52 - 1266.72] Tainted even the most leading best
[1264.60 - 1268.16] information that's out there now in
[1266.72 - 1270.00] everything including thyroid and
[1268.16 - 1272.08] everything else and it is Tainted it
[1270.00 - 1274.56] whether the practitioner or the doctor
[1272.08 - 1277.36] or the good-hearted person knows about
[1274.56 - 1279.08] it and I get that I get that you know we
[1277.36 - 1280.64] only can do what we can do but I'm
[1279.08 - 1282.80] telling you I'm taking you somewhere
[1280.64 - 1285.80] further I'm taking you further out I'm
[1282.80 - 1289.80] taking you in a better place and it has
[1285.80 - 1291.56] to be that way that's what I'm here for
[1289.80 - 1294.52] that's what I'm here
[1291.56 - 1296.76] for now if you know the truth if you
[1294.52 - 1299.48] know the truth and your body isn't
[1296.76 - 1302.04] attacking itself if you know the truth
[1299.48 - 1303.88] it's attacking something else your body
[1302.04 - 1305.48] is attacking something else it's not
[1303.88 - 1307.20] attacking your organs it's not attacking
[1305.48 - 1309.56] your glands it's not attacking your skin
[1307.20 - 1313.84] it's not attacking your body if it's
[1309.56 - 1317.80] attacking something else that's not your
[1313.84 - 1320.76] body you will have the greatest chance
[1317.80 - 1324.28] of of really healing the barrier starts
[1320.76 - 1327.20] to come down the barrier starts to break
[1324.28 - 1329.80] down the barrier the barrier that's been
[1327.20 - 1334.12] put in our way back in the
[1329.80 - 1337.04] 1950s put in our way in the
[1334.12 - 1339.84] 1950s that's the barrier that was set up
[1337.04 - 1341.80] old grandfathered law the barrier of
[1339.84 - 1343.64] your body attacking itself because signs
[1341.80 - 1346.32] and research still isn't up to par on
[1343.64 - 1348.76] what causes your symptoms and conditions
[1346.32 - 1351.52] you guys because science and research is
[1348.76 - 1354.36] not up to level to what's happening and
[1351.52 - 1356.40] why you feel like you do and why you
[1354.36 - 1358.44] have those pains and why you have that
[1356.40 - 1360.32] fatigue and why your Skin's inflamed and
[1358.44 - 1362.48] why you have the butterfly rash and why
[1360.32 - 1363.72] your thyroids inflamed thyroiditis and
[1362.48 - 1366.48] everything
[1363.72 - 1369.76] else because science and research isn't
[1366.48 - 1373.44] there yet at
[1369.76 - 1376.44] all it's grandfather in and rooted to
[1373.44 - 1378.40] these old thought processes that get in
[1376.44 - 1380.40] your way because funding when into them
[1378.40 - 1382.32] at the time and no one wants to break it
[1380.40 - 1385.36] it's like estate planning it's like
[1382.32 - 1386.76] trusts it's like the trust you can't
[1385.36 - 1389.68] break
[1386.76 - 1391.80] it it's like massive corporate trusts
[1389.68 - 1393.76] and different things in that category
[1391.80 - 1397.08] you can't break them they're written in
[1393.76 - 1400.72] papers those papers are in vaults vaults
[1397.08 - 1404.00] those papers are protected and a lot of
[1400.72 - 1406.04] these old laws in the medical field have
[1404.00 - 1408.44] to be passed on even to your greatest
[1406.04 - 1410.36] expert that's alternative right now that
[1408.44 - 1412.60] he or she still has to believe the body
[1410.36 - 1416.16] is attacking itself because it's it's
[1412.60 - 1418.88] grandfathered in with trust it's
[1416.16 - 1420.92] grandfathered in back in the 50s or 60s
[1418.88 - 1422.96] or 70s and it can't be broken because
[1420.92 - 1425.04] interest groups paid for it they paid
[1422.96 - 1427.80] for
[1425.04 - 1430.56] it I'm telling you how it
[1427.80 - 1432.60] works so then you carry the poison and
[1430.56 - 1434.92] your children carry the poison so when
[1432.60 - 1437.12] your child has a thyroid problem that's
[1434.92 - 1440.88] your child's body attacking itself
[1437.12 - 1444.08] that's how poison this is it's it's it's
[1440.88 - 1446.20] dark it's dark just going to say it I
[1444.08 - 1447.72] told you to fasten your seat pulse
[1446.20 - 1450.96] today
[1447.72 - 1452.40] and so you need to know to protect your
[1450.96 - 1455.52] children your
[1452.40 - 1456.60] children to know that it's not your body
[1455.52 - 1459.64] attacking
[1456.60 - 1463.04] itself and it's so incredibly important
[1459.64 - 1465.36] and to know that labels are just
[1463.04 - 1467.08] names they might make us feel a little
[1465.36 - 1468.76] better they might give us identification
[1467.08 - 1470.88] so we can you know we could if we we
[1468.76 - 1473.72] need disability we got a name that the
[1470.88 - 1476.52] insurance company will accept all that's
[1473.72 - 1478.76] important but the label still don't cut
[1476.52 - 1481.04] it they don't cut it as far as knowing
[1478.76 - 1483.80] what's going on and what's wrong but if
[1481.04 - 1485.36] you know the truth and your body is not
[1483.80 - 1487.04] attacking itself and not destroying
[1485.36 - 1489.20] itself your body is not going after your
[1487.04 - 1491.52] thyroid it's attacking something else
[1489.20 - 1493.72] something else it's going after
[1491.52 - 1496.32] something else in your
[1493.72 - 1500.12] body if you know
[1496.32 - 1501.92] this you just took it to a new level
[1500.12 - 1504.80] you're extracting that poisonous
[1501.92 - 1507.16] grandfathered law that sits in there
[1504.80 - 1509.72] that sits in there to take you down
[1507.16 - 1511.32] because I'm going to tell you right now
[1509.72 - 1514.96] because research and science doesn't
[1511.32 - 1518.00] know what's going on with your health
[1514.96 - 1520.24] deep inside with your bodies it's better
[1518.00 - 1521.92] to blame it on you it's not good to
[1520.24 - 1523.36] blame it on research and science we're
[1521.92 - 1524.84] not allowed to do that you're not
[1523.36 - 1529.16] allowed to blame it on research and
[1524.84 - 1532.08] science not at all not at all
[1529.16 - 1533.92] you're not it has to be blamed on you
[1532.08 - 1535.92] you have to take the hit you have to be
[1533.92 - 1537.48] the Fall Guy you got to be the one your
[1535.92 - 1540.84] children have to be the ones that take
[1537.48 - 1542.36] the hit they have to be the ones because
[1540.84 - 1543.20] research and science don't know what's
[1542.36 - 1545.88] going
[1543.20 - 1549.00] on so then you got to take the hit it's
[1545.88 - 1550.96] your fault so hey when you have a
[1549.00 - 1552.52] thyroid problem it's your fault as
[1550.96 - 1553.96] you're driving away from the doctor's
[1552.52 - 1556.52] office it's your
[1553.96 - 1558.84] fault whether you know that consciously
[1556.52 - 1561.12] or not in the moment it is going to be
[1558.84 - 1564.12] subconsciously in there and creep out
[1561.12 - 1565.96] and creep out over time and then you're
[1564.12 - 1567.84] going to be like what is my body doing
[1565.96 - 1569.68] it's letting me down my body's letting
[1567.84 - 1572.12] me down the wrong track my body is
[1569.68 - 1574.60] totally giving up on me my body's faulty
[1572.12 - 1578.08] it's genetic my genes are screwed up I'm
[1574.60 - 1581.32] messed up it's all going to come through
[1578.08 - 1582.92] whether we like it or not this is yeah
[1581.32 - 1583.72] this is Hardcore stuff we're talking
[1582.92 - 1586.40] about
[1583.72 - 1588.44] today because this stuff is like a
[1586.40 - 1592.68] dangerous spider
[1588.44 - 1594.76] it sits inside us and it has to be
[1592.68 - 1598.08] removed now if you
[1594.76 - 1601.52] know check this out okay if you know
[1598.08 - 1604.32] that your body is protecting you it's
[1601.52 - 1606.48] protecting you it's looking after you
[1604.32 - 1609.76] it's on your side it's not letting you
[1606.48 - 1613.64] down at all it's riding on your side
[1609.76 - 1616.84] it's for you it's there for you it loves
[1613.64 - 1621.28] you unconditionally it cares about you
[1616.84 - 1623.96] it's by side if you know your body is
[1621.28 - 1625.72] working for you it's working for you and
[1623.96 - 1627.36] it loves you and it loves working for
[1625.72 - 1629.16] you something different's going to
[1627.36 - 1630.48] happen something different's going to
[1629.16 - 1632.08] happen that's just a piece of it it's a
[1630.48 - 1633.84] big piece of it this the foundation
[1632.08 - 1635.56] we're talking about the foundation right
[1633.84 - 1638.16] here the guts of the foundation we're
[1635.56 - 1641.60] not messing around if you know your
[1638.16 - 1643.72] body's working for you and it's on your
[1641.60 - 1646.00] side and you're ready for this take it
[1643.72 - 1647.24] to the next level to Next Level so you
[1646.00 - 1649.76] got these symptoms you got these
[1647.24 - 1651.76] conditions you got these diseases you
[1649.76 - 1653.88] got these illnesses you got all this
[1651.76 - 1655.88] going on you got multiple sclerosis you
[1653.88 - 1657.56] got systemic lupus you got Hashim Modas
[1655.88 - 1660.52] you got colitis you got psoriasis you
[1657.56 - 1663.64] got whatever it is you got going
[1660.52 - 1666.96] on there's a real cause to why it's
[1663.64 - 1669.00] happening there's a real cause there's
[1666.96 - 1670.80] something really going on there now
[1669.00 - 1673.36] here's the next level if you know that
[1670.80 - 1675.28] your body is not only not only loves you
[1673.36 - 1677.64] and is on your side and is working for
[1675.28 - 1679.76] you and is there for you and is is
[1677.64 - 1681.88] working hard and not giving up on you
[1679.76 - 1684.16] and is connected to you and connected to
[1681.88 - 1686.72] God and connected to everything and your
[1684.16 - 1688.72] body's there and it's after something
[1686.72 - 1690.84] else though it's after an Invader it's
[1688.72 - 1694.04] after an Invader because here's what
[1690.84 - 1696.40] autoimmune really is it's something
[1694.04 - 1699.44] that's in our system that invaded our
[1696.40 - 1701.56] system that our bodies out to destroy
[1699.44 - 1703.84] and out to kick its butt and out to move
[1701.56 - 1706.44] it out of the body and that's what's
[1703.84 - 1708.20] going on and it takes it to a new
[1706.44 - 1711.56] level
[1708.20 - 1715.28] so when it comes down to lupus for
[1711.56 - 1718.16] example lupus is a viral Condition it's
[1715.28 - 1720.60] a virus the body's not attacking itself
[1718.16 - 1722.88] the body's not going after itself the
[1720.60 - 1725.32] body's not attacking kidneys it's not
[1722.88 - 1728.80] attacking any part of the
[1725.32 - 1730.92] body it's a viral Condition it's a virus
[1728.80 - 1734.00] that wants to attack a kidney or the
[1730.92 - 1736.36] virus that wants to attack tissue it's a
[1734.00 - 1738.28] virus that causes the trouble it's a
[1736.36 - 1741.88] virus that
[1738.28 - 1744.72] that actually eliminates poison too so
[1741.88 - 1747.32] it eliminates poison it creates poison
[1744.72 - 1748.96] it's a virus that causes the attacking
[1747.32 - 1750.88] now you might think that's scary but
[1748.96 - 1753.80] it's not scary I'm going to tell you why
[1750.88 - 1756.92] because when you know you got an
[1753.80 - 1757.92] unwanted house guest that your body's
[1756.92 - 1761.12] kicking
[1757.92 - 1764.08] out it's a whole new game it's a whole
[1761.12 - 1766.72] new game you start winning the game fast
[1764.08 - 1769.40] I've watched thousands of people win the
[1766.72 - 1772.08] game over and over again over the
[1769.40 - 1775.44] Decades of my life I've watched
[1772.08 - 1777.96] thousands of people heal from the worst
[1775.44 - 1781.12] stuff you could imagine I don't care
[1777.96 - 1784.36] what it is from the worst situations
[1781.12 - 1787.28] from being in wheelchairs sick with
[1784.36 - 1790.72] mystery conditions mystery multiple
[1787.28 - 1793.56] sceris mystery everything and get up and
[1790.72 - 1795.12] walk and live their life and they're out
[1793.56 - 1795.92] there gardening and they're driving in
[1795.12 - 1798.36] their
[1795.92 - 1799.88] cars I've seen people with the worst
[1798.36 - 1803.52] symptoms and the worst conditions
[1799.88 - 1806.40] recover over the years because they knew
[1803.52 - 1810.36] information that was finally real not
[1806.40 - 1813.00] grandfathered in and and hidden under
[1810.36 - 1814.24] bureaucracy of of the medical world
[1813.00 - 1817.68] hidden
[1814.24 - 1819.80] under funding old funding and old trusts
[1817.68 - 1822.16] and everything else involved and then
[1819.80 - 1824.28] poisonous information spread to the
[1822.16 - 1826.28] leading Health experts right now that
[1824.28 - 1828.28] that use fruits and vegetables and say
[1826.28 - 1829.92] stay away from gluten talk about
[1828.28 - 1832.08] triggers and they talk about great stuff
[1829.92 - 1835.24] but they still are they still are
[1832.08 - 1837.28] missing the greatest point that stops so
[1835.24 - 1839.88] many people from healing the greatest
[1837.28 - 1841.52] point of all time for us for our
[1839.88 - 1843.40] children which is the body does not
[1841.52 - 1846.72] attack itself it's attacking something
[1843.40 - 1849.44] else it's going after something else you
[1846.72 - 1853.20] see right
[1849.44 - 1856.16] right and and it's important to know
[1853.20 - 1858.92] this so what happens is with say
[1856.16 - 1861.24] Hashimoto thy itis your thyroids
[1858.92 - 1862.84] inflamed because there's a little bug in
[1861.24 - 1864.72] there there's a little bug in the
[1862.84 - 1866.48] thyroid that got in there happens to be
[1864.72 - 1868.64] the Epstein barv virus that slipped into
[1866.48 - 1870.72] the
[1868.64 - 1874.44] thyroid and that's what's creating the
[1870.72 - 1878.04] inflammation not the body the body
[1874.44 - 1880.00] creates antibodies to go after the virus
[1878.04 - 1882.96] itself to be working with the immune
[1880.00 - 1885.44] system itself hand in hand to go after
[1882.96 - 1888.36] the virus the body does not create one
[1885.44 - 1890.68] harmed cell
[1888.36 - 1894.48] there's nothing the immune system can do
[1890.68 - 1897.04] to create one cell that will harm your
[1894.48 - 1900.16] body on any level your immune system
[1897.04 - 1902.92] will not harm a single cell of yours
[1900.16 - 1905.28] that has to be known that has to be
[1902.92 - 1908.52] impregnated within your soul in your
[1905.28 - 1911.80] mind it has to be there you have to have
[1908.52 - 1912.88] access to that you have to have access
[1911.80 - 1914.92] to
[1912.88 - 1917.32] that so what's happening like with
[1914.92 - 1920.24] hashimotos thyroiditis you're your
[1917.32 - 1922.36] bodies after a virus that's the virus
[1920.24 - 1924.36] Epstein bar that gets into the thyroid
[1922.36 - 1927.04] now leading Health experts that that
[1924.36 - 1929.88] actually recently took my information
[1927.04 - 1931.84] over the years of how Epstein bar causes
[1929.88 - 1934.72] the thyroid problem they're still too
[1931.84 - 1936.48] afraid to admit that that autoimmune
[1934.72 - 1937.84] isn't the body attacking itself they're
[1936.48 - 1939.88] still too afraid to leave those
[1937.84 - 1941.48] grandfathered laws because they're
[1939.88 - 1943.60] afraid it's going to it's going to get
[1941.48 - 1946.08] them to look bad out there maybe they'll
[1943.60 - 1948.48] hinder the careers or something like
[1946.08 - 1950.56] that don't want to leave that thought
[1948.48 - 1952.04] process but what they do is they do say
[1950.56 - 1954.04] well Epstein bar could be a little bit
[1952.04 - 1956.32] of a trigger oh so can this and so could
[1954.04 - 1958.56] be no that's not it it's the virus
[1956.32 - 1960.68] itself that gets into the thyroid this
[1958.56 - 1961.96] is way more advanced this is way more
[1960.68 - 1964.16] serious and when it comes down to your
[1961.96 - 1965.92] health do you want to know the truth do
[1964.16 - 1968.00] you want to know the truth or you just
[1965.92 - 1971.36] want to know like just the skewed
[1968.00 - 1973.08] tainted versions that or the nontruth or
[1971.36 - 1975.44] misinformation or misconceptions would
[1973.08 - 1977.44] you rather have those would you rather
[1975.44 - 1978.72] have all those and that's a people live
[1977.44 - 1980.36] by that's what they're using that's what
[1978.72 - 1982.24] they're out there doing I think you
[1980.36 - 1983.76] would like to have the truth I want the
[1982.24 - 1986.08] truth I would love the
[1983.76 - 1988.16] truth so when it comes down to
[1986.08 - 1990.68] Hashimoto's the virus gets into the
[1988.16 - 1993.00] thyroid and it's wreaking the Havoc
[1990.68 - 1995.36] that's causing the
[1993.00 - 1997.36] inflammation and then your body's trying
[1995.36 - 2000.68] to your body's not
[1997.36 - 2003.48] inflaming or or attacking it's meaning
[2000.68 - 2006.36] your own tissue it's going after the
[2003.48 - 2008.96] virus the virus is inflaming the virus
[2006.36 - 2008.96] causes
[2009.36 - 2014.64] inflammation when it comes to aer's
[2011.32 - 2018.48] danow syndrome connective tissue
[2014.64 - 2021.28] problems that's a viral condition as
[2018.48 - 2023.44] well that's not a genetic condition
[2021.28 - 2024.88] where the body is attacking itself it's
[2023.44 - 2026.64] not a genetic condition where the body
[2024.88 - 2030.44] is attacking
[2026.64 - 2031.96] itself that's a virus condition too so
[2030.44 - 2034.56] I'm trying to give you examples ra
[2031.96 - 2036.16] rheumatoid arthritis is a viral
[2034.56 - 2039.00] condition your swollen joints your
[2036.16 - 2040.92] swollen nerves stats of virus
[2039.00 - 2045.24] fibromyalgia which is now being chalked
[2040.92 - 2046.88] up to be autoimmune is Epstein bar
[2045.24 - 2049.24] creating
[2046.88 - 2051.52] inflammation in the
[2049.24 - 2053.56] nerves you know I saw a commercial
[2051.52 - 2056.60] recently and it was like oh fibromyalgia
[2053.56 - 2058.44] it's it's um research in science we uh
[2056.60 - 2061.76] we believe that it's just overactive
[2058.44 - 2062.64] nerves here we are what year are we in
[2061.76 - 2064.92] and
[2062.64 - 2068.72] fibromyalgia is just it's is
[2064.92 - 2071.32] overreactive nerves that's that's what
[2068.72 - 2072.80] it is meaning that's what research and
[2071.32 - 2075.72] science believe it
[2072.80 - 2078.24] is Fibromyalgia is caused by one bug
[2075.72 - 2081.04] only it's caused by the Epstein bar
[2078.24 - 2083.00] virus now not every every autoimmune
[2081.04 - 2084.20] condition is caused by Epstein bar no I
[2083.00 - 2086.28] mean there's the shingles viruses
[2084.20 - 2087.96] there's hhv6 there's all the different
[2086.28 - 2089.44] viruses that cause these there's heavy
[2087.96 - 2091.36] metals combined with them we're going to
[2089.44 - 2093.08] cover a little bit of that there's toxic
[2091.36 - 2095.00] heavy metals there's chemical agents
[2093.08 - 2097.84] there's other triggers but these other
[2095.00 - 2100.72] triggers feed viruses and that's another
[2097.84 - 2105.76] problem no one understands yet is that
[2100.72 - 2108.52] viruses eat they eat viruses feed off of
[2105.76 - 2110.64] food research and science will not
[2108.52 - 2112.48] showcase that information they haven't
[2110.64 - 2114.72] discovered it and if they do Discover it
[2112.48 - 2117.08] they sure as heck aren't going to let us
[2114.72 - 2119.60] know because it will prove everything
[2117.08 - 2122.48] wrong to what they've already funded
[2119.60 - 2124.40] before in the past back to that silly
[2122.48 - 2126.12] thing I have to tell you guys is once
[2124.40 - 2128.40] those strings are attached and once that
[2126.12 - 2131.92] research is funded a long time ago once
[2128.40 - 2134.36] it's been grandfathered in you get
[2131.92 - 2137.28] totally shaked
[2134.36 - 2139.36] over you get totally shaked over that's
[2137.28 - 2141.44] what happens here once all that's
[2139.36 - 2144.44] happened once those internal Kickbacks
[2141.44 - 2146.40] happened 50 years ago 40 years ago 80
[2144.44 - 2149.92] years ago whenever it was that research
[2146.40 - 2152.92] was done and someone said viruses don't
[2149.92 - 2156.16] eat anything that's not how they
[2152.92 - 2157.96] recreate once that was put out there
[2156.16 - 2160.60] it's hard to
[2157.96 - 2162.84] change so even if research and science
[2160.60 - 2165.56] discovers that a virus feeds off of
[2162.84 - 2167.36] mercury it feeds off of mercury they're
[2165.56 - 2168.88] not going to tell you it has to be me
[2167.36 - 2171.40] that tells you because I'm the only one
[2168.88 - 2174.80] that released that information out there
[2171.40 - 2174.80] yet in
[2174.96 - 2179.96] history but that's the whole point what
[2178.36 - 2182.40] was the gift I was
[2179.96 - 2185.56] given I was given that gift so I can
[2182.40 - 2188.20] give you this information I'm relying on
[2185.56 - 2192.32] getting that information to
[2188.20 - 2195.12] you so triggers are things that feed a
[2192.32 - 2198.40] virus that causes autoimmune so if
[2195.12 - 2201.44] you're eating gluten gluten is something
[2198.40 - 2203.96] that a virus will feed on that's Unknown
[2201.44 - 2205.84] by research and Science and no expert
[2203.96 - 2208.20] knows that yet and if someone did speak
[2205.84 - 2210.68] of it it came from originally from this
[2208.20 - 2214.04] Source it's important to
[2210.68 - 2216.40] know that it's the triggers that feed
[2214.04 - 2218.52] and instigate and break down the immune
[2216.40 - 2220.40] system system allowing the virus to get
[2218.52 - 2222.32] stronger so like in Lupus if you're
[2220.40 - 2224.64] eating gluten and gluten is flaring up
[2222.32 - 2227.32] more butterfly rashes that's because the
[2224.64 - 2230.72] gluten feeding the virus that's
[2227.32 - 2234.60] releasing a poison causing the butterfly
[2230.72 - 2239.16] rashes see the virus feeds off of food
[2234.60 - 2242.36] creates poison causes the rash exmos
[2239.16 - 2244.32] orasis that takes the virus inside the
[2242.36 - 2247.28] liver it's a liver problem where the
[2244.32 - 2249.68] virus resides Xmen psoriasis is not the
[2247.28 - 2253.60] body attacking the skin it's attacking
[2249.68 - 2256.60] the Derma attacking it's not doing that
[2253.60 - 2258.96] what xoras is is that's a toxin it's
[2256.60 - 2260.84] called a dermatoxin and I'm not talking
[2258.96 - 2262.72] about the dermatoxin where science of
[2260.84 - 2264.76] research classifies a dermatoxin say
[2262.72 - 2267.12] when you get something poisonous put on
[2264.76 - 2269.04] top of the surface of your skin and your
[2267.12 - 2271.20] skin reacts that's called a
[2269.04 - 2273.00] dermatoxin I'm talking about an internal
[2271.20 - 2274.36] dermatoxin that Spirit has provided me
[2273.00 - 2276.28] with the information with that doesn't
[2274.36 - 2277.80] exist somewhere so if you go on you're
[2276.28 - 2280.28] and you're on the internet and you're
[2277.80 - 2281.92] looking okay dermatoxin oh wait what's
[2280.28 - 2284.32] this no that's not the dermatoxin we're
[2281.92 - 2287.04] talking about so it's important to know
[2284.32 - 2289.08] this so you don't get lost out there the
[2287.04 - 2292.96] dermatox that I'm talking about is when
[2289.08 - 2295.36] a virus feeds off of certain foods that
[2292.96 - 2297.08] create a different poison that leeches
[2295.36 - 2299.04] out from the liver goes into the
[2297.08 - 2301.36] bloodstream and surfaces through the
[2299.04 - 2303.92] skin causes ex and
[2301.36 - 2306.36] psoriasis in this case there's a couple
[2303.92 - 2308.36] different viruses mainly the epine bar
[2306.36 - 2312.36] those sits inside the liver feeds off of
[2308.36 - 2314.84] high levels of copper old levels of DDT
[2312.36 - 2317.04] cuz DDT is still everywhere still in the
[2314.84 - 2318.68] it's still in in the reservoirs still in
[2317.04 - 2320.48] everybody's drinking water just so you
[2318.68 - 2322.20] know DDT still in everybody's drinking
[2320.48 - 2324.00] water I hate to say it but it's true in
[2322.20 - 2326.76] life changeing Foods I talk about the
[2324.00 - 2328.48] unforgiving for maybe some of you are
[2326.76 - 2331.08] familiar with it maybe maybe a bunch of
[2328.48 - 2333.96] you haven't seen that book yet but the
[2331.08 - 2336.08] unforgiving four one of them is DDT and
[2333.96 - 2337.56] its cousins pesticides that's one
[2336.08 - 2339.68] another one is heavy metals that's
[2337.56 - 2341.20] another one the other one is the viral
[2339.68 - 2342.28] explosion which we're talking about now
[2341.20 - 2345.00] the
[2342.28 - 2347.52] viruses and the other one is
[2345.00 - 2349.28] radiation what happens is viruses like
[2347.52 - 2350.72] an Xmen psoriasis you have a virus
[2349.28 - 2353.48] inside the liver it's feeding off of
[2350.72 - 2356.08] high levels of copper old DDT some other
[2353.48 - 2359.16] garbage it's producing a dermatoxin
[2356.08 - 2362.92] specifically that irritates seriously
[2359.16 - 2365.32] irritates skin inflames it devastatingly
[2362.92 - 2368.88] and it's it's it surfaces up to the skin
[2365.32 - 2371.28] and inflames Flames the skin really
[2368.88 - 2372.96] bad and that's with exus Isis but it
[2371.28 - 2374.16] takes a virus feeding off of something
[2372.96 - 2375.88] is what I'm trying to tell you and
[2374.16 - 2377.36] that's that's so far ahead of science
[2375.88 - 2380.60] and research right now it's it's not
[2377.36 - 2382.12] even funny it's so far ahead years ago
[2380.60 - 2383.52] when I was younger I told spirit I
[2382.12 - 2385.08] laughed at Spirit and I said spirit I
[2383.52 - 2387.64] don't I don't believe you science of
[2385.08 - 2390.00] research they got it all under
[2387.64 - 2391.80] wraps I mean we're talking science and
[2390.00 - 2394.24] research because you know why because on
[2391.80 - 2397.44] TV when I was a child I saw a rocket
[2394.24 - 2398.96] ship heading to the Moon you know that
[2397.44 - 2401.04] whole thing
[2398.96 - 2402.76] Nassau now I was like there's nothing
[2401.04 - 2405.20] Spirit there's nothing you can tell me I
[2402.76 - 2409.08] mean there there's a rocket ship going
[2405.20 - 2410.56] up into space we went on the moon
[2409.08 - 2412.04] there's there's you know there's there's
[2410.56 - 2414.44] space
[2412.04 - 2416.48] shuttles and I said to Spirit there's
[2414.44 - 2418.68] nothing you can tell me I said to Spirit
[2416.48 - 2420.04] I was I was trying I was being you know
[2418.68 - 2422.84] silly I said there's nothing you can
[2420.04 - 2424.12] tell me that's Advanced that isn't here
[2422.84 - 2425.56] there's nothing in health that they
[2424.12 - 2427.60] haven't figured out they got it all
[2425.56 - 2429.12] wrapped up they got a cure for AIDS they
[2427.60 - 2430.96] they'll find a cure for AIDS tomorrow
[2429.12 - 2434.04] they got it wrapped up spirit said no no
[2430.96 - 2438.20] no no no silly silly
[2434.04 - 2440.92] boy silly boy you have no idea and
[2438.20 - 2442.76] spirit taught me and spirit said no
[2440.92 - 2444.96] that's not how it's going to
[2442.76 - 2447.28] be
[2444.96 - 2449.28] and I mean look at the technology we
[2447.28 - 2451.60] have today but yeah children are sick
[2449.28 - 2453.04] with autoimmune moms are sick they can't
[2451.60 - 2454.64] feed their kids take care of their kids
[2453.04 - 2456.96] they can't even hop in cars and drive
[2454.64 - 2458.72] because they're too dizzy to drive
[2456.96 - 2459.76] because you know and they have all these
[2458.72 - 2462.04] different
[2459.76 - 2464.32] diagnoses including Lyme disease Lyme
[2462.04 - 2466.16] disease wasn't classified autoimmune
[2464.32 - 2469.08] because of the fact that they they they
[2466.16 - 2472.32] singled out a bacteria which by the way
[2469.08 - 2474.80] is still really flawed and anybody who
[2472.32 - 2476.20] knows book one of medical medium read
[2474.80 - 2478.24] the lime chapter and you'll know about
[2476.20 - 2482.16] lime more than any anybody
[2478.24 - 2484.40] will but the bottom line is it's going
[2482.16 - 2486.84] to be all falling into categories into
[2484.40 - 2489.84] autoimmune because as years go
[2486.84 - 2491.20] on research and Science and medical
[2489.84 - 2493.32] communities are going to be like well
[2491.20 - 2494.72] you know Ms is now autoimmune cuz we
[2493.32 - 2496.36] really don't have our hands on it we
[2494.72 - 2499.40] don't have our finger on the pulse
[2496.36 - 2501.80] Celiac is autoimmune you know vitil Lego
[2499.40 - 2504.36] any Vio anything to do with skin
[2501.80 - 2506.12] anything to do with you know lupus
[2504.36 - 2507.92] anything type 1 diabetes we don't have
[2506.12 - 2509.28] our we don't have our handle on it so
[2507.92 - 2510.88] it's all got to get filed into
[2509.28 - 2513.04] autoimmune
[2510.88 - 2514.92] category and it's going to keep on filed
[2513.04 - 2516.32] in then new labels will be created too
[2514.92 - 2517.88] and keep on filed in because it's it's
[2516.32 - 2519.88] got to be your fault it's your fault
[2517.88 - 2521.52] it's your body attacking itself it's
[2519.88 - 2523.24] nothing else than that it's your body
[2521.52 - 2524.60] attacking itself and leading experts in
[2523.24 - 2526.44] the alternative field to be like well
[2524.60 - 2528.44] you know it's immune system problems
[2526.44 - 2530.60] because you know and it's triggers and
[2528.44 - 2532.56] and all this no it's more than that it's
[2530.60 - 2535.88] it's what I'm telling you right
[2532.56 - 2538.36] now but the foundation has to be in your
[2535.88 - 2540.20] hands you guys it has to be where you
[2538.36 - 2541.72] know your body isn't destroying itself
[2540.20 - 2543.76] when you know you got an Invader that
[2541.72 - 2545.28] you want to kick out of your home and
[2543.76 - 2547.72] when you want to kick that Invader out
[2545.28 - 2549.04] of your home something changes and
[2547.72 - 2551.52] something
[2549.04 - 2553.40] happens something happens with your
[2551.52 - 2555.56] immune system it gets the strength it
[2553.40 - 2558.44] needs your thoughts in your mind and in
[2555.56 - 2560.44] your head and in your brain in your soul
[2558.44 - 2563.28] your thoughts go to your immune system
[2560.44 - 2565.00] and you say haha I knew you were you
[2563.28 - 2567.52] were your immune my immune system was
[2565.00 - 2570.60] working for me I knew you guys were
[2567.52 - 2573.28] working for me I knew my body wasn't
[2570.60 - 2574.88] harming myself I knew something else was
[2573.28 - 2577.44] inside of me that was going on that I
[2574.88 - 2580.92] want out and kicked out I I knew it this
[2577.44 - 2583.88] Foundation is critical for you to heal
[2580.92 - 2585.72] it means everything I promise you that
[2583.88 - 2589.92] it means
[2585.72 - 2592.60] everything seriously I promise you
[2589.92 - 2594.36] that so when that message transfers to
[2592.60 - 2596.40] your thoughts to your brain to your to
[2594.36 - 2599.56] your soul to your immune system it gets
[2596.40 - 2602.28] your body to eliminate the poison that
[2599.56 - 2605.40] virus starts to break down it starts to
[2602.28 - 2606.80] break down because it gets a message
[2605.40 - 2608.72] fast
[2606.80 - 2611.32] you know what it
[2608.72 - 2615.08] is that you know what it
[2611.32 - 2617.88] is and if you start robbing food from
[2615.08 - 2620.24] the viruses that create autoimmune tags
[2617.88 - 2624.36] and labels these illnesses and
[2620.24 - 2626.44] conditions when you start robbing food
[2624.36 - 2629.12] from these viruses so they can't
[2626.44 - 2630.72] multiply so they can't continue to
[2629.12 - 2633.32] poison
[2630.72 - 2636.04] you in the thyroid healing book there's
[2633.32 - 2640.68] over 80 symptoms and conditions like EXP
[2636.04 - 2642.40] exp laain in detail and about how it's
[2640.68 - 2643.60] occurring it's very important to
[2642.40 - 2645.48] understand and we're going to cover a
[2643.60 - 2649.24] lot of that right now
[2645.48 - 2650.68] too so with Xmen orasis I covered a
[2649.24 - 2653.16] little bit about how that works with the
[2650.68 - 2655.32] virus with lupus lupus is the Epstein
[2653.16 - 2657.20] bar Epstein bar we talked about before
[2655.32 - 2660.48] you heard that comes in different shapes
[2657.20 - 2662.56] and sizes different strains different
[2660.48 - 2664.52] mutations different varieties different
[2662.56 - 2666.72] groups I've been able to classify these
[2664.52 - 2670.12] groups cuz I can't rely on science to do
[2666.72 - 2673.32] it so we classified these
[2670.12 - 2676.20] groups and with
[2673.32 - 2677.60] lupus which is completely not even
[2676.20 - 2679.68] diagnosable you have to understand it's
[2677.60 - 2682.32] diagnosed by the eye all the different
[2679.68 - 2684.44] in inflammatory markers that we use for
[2682.32 - 2687.36] testing lupus and
[2684.44 - 2690.24] ra those those are just inflammation
[2687.36 - 2693.24] markers testing levels of
[2690.24 - 2696.08] inflammation that's what those are for
[2693.24 - 2698.36] um cative protein you know Ana an the
[2696.08 - 2701.40] nuclear antigen all those are just
[2698.36 - 2703.60] they're just for testing for levels of
[2701.40 - 2706.20] inflammation but the mystery is still
[2703.60 - 2708.56] there and with lupus it's Epstein bar
[2706.20 - 2710.84] and the problem is with how it works is
[2708.56 - 2713.00] I've said this before that almost every
[2710.84 - 2714.84] autoimmune disease is eventually going
[2713.00 - 2716.28] to be filed into just Lyme disease
[2714.84 - 2718.36] category because that's how confused
[2716.28 - 2720.04] everybody is they're so confused it's
[2718.36 - 2721.76] going to be pushed off I bet you some of
[2720.04 - 2724.56] you listening have been diagnosed with
[2721.76 - 2726.32] lupus M and Ms and then finally lime it
[2724.56 - 2728.28] just gets pushed off into Li I'm not
[2726.32 - 2730.04] saying that's right either it's not
[2728.28 - 2731.60] right but the point is it gets pushed
[2730.04 - 2734.88] off everything's going to be pushed off
[2731.60 - 2735.84] into it and that's how it's been that's
[2734.88 - 2740.68] how it's
[2735.84 - 2743.64] going so with lupus it's about also high
[2740.68 - 2746.28] levels of heavy metals Mercury lots of
[2743.64 - 2749.24] mercury having the virus epsteen bar
[2746.28 - 2751.08] feeding off of mercury creating a lot of
[2749.24 - 2753.20] neurotoxins in you know causing
[2751.08 - 2755.52] butterfly rashes causing damage to
[2753.20 - 2758.88] tissue in the body causing weakness
[2755.52 - 2761.08] causing fatigue causing reactions all of
[2758.88 - 2762.72] that multiple sclerosis that's also I'm
[2761.08 - 2764.68] covering the Epstein bar varieties
[2762.72 - 2768.00] anyway multiple
[2764.68 - 2769.64] sclerosis 100% Epstein bar coupled with
[2768.00 - 2772.12] toxic heavy
[2769.64 - 2773.72] metals and you know and and with
[2772.12 - 2776.56] multiple sclerosis you can get the
[2773.72 - 2778.40] lesions on the brain most of the time
[2776.56 - 2780.16] almost all the time that's not even
[2778.40 - 2781.96] what's causing people symptoms is is
[2780.16 - 2783.36] some of the different dark spots there's
[2781.96 - 2784.96] a lot of people with all kinds of
[2783.36 - 2786.12] different spots inside their brains I'm
[2784.96 - 2788.04] talking about people that are walking
[2786.12 - 2790.40] around every day that don't even know
[2788.04 - 2791.64] there there's so much going on inside
[2790.40 - 2794.32] people's brains there's all kinds of
[2791.64 - 2796.12] calics there's crystallizations there's
[2794.32 - 2798.20] uh dark spots brown spots there's white
[2796.12 - 2801.44] spots there's there you know deposits of
[2798.20 - 2804.12] heavy metals there's deposits of of of
[2801.44 - 2805.52] um MSG there's deposits of chemical
[2804.12 - 2808.12] solvents there's all kinds of different
[2805.52 - 2809.84] things in everybody's head and a lot of
[2808.12 - 2812.24] times it comes up whether somebody has a
[2809.84 - 2814.44] symptom or not in a CAT scan say someone
[2812.24 - 2815.96] can't tell you how many times people who
[2814.44 - 2818.44] have come to me over the years say yeah
[2815.96 - 2821.68] I banged my head I banged my head on my
[2818.44 - 2824.88] car door pretty hard so I thought I'd
[2821.68 - 2827.00] get a an MRI my doctor recommended an
[2824.88 - 2829.08] MRI cuz it banged my head pretty hard
[2827.00 - 2830.72] and they found a little spot in there
[2829.08 - 2834.64] that spot apparently was there all this
[2830.72 - 2837.08] time I can't tell you how many people
[2834.64 - 2839.16] have different spots in their head and
[2837.08 - 2841.48] and but it's not causing it's not
[2839.16 - 2842.96] causing their symptoms what happens with
[2841.48 - 2844.04] multiple sclerosis you get a whole bunch
[2842.96 - 2845.48] of people with mystery multiple
[2844.04 - 2846.60] sclerosis with nothing showing up in
[2845.48 - 2847.84] their brain you get a whole bunch of
[2846.60 - 2850.80] people with stuff showing in the brain
[2847.84 - 2854.24] but it's Epstein bar and deposits of
[2850.80 - 2856.24] heavy metals that are involved it's a
[2854.24 - 2857.96] virus and deposits of heavy
[2856.24 - 2860.52] metals
[2857.96 - 2861.84] um and you know alopecia is an
[2860.52 - 2864.52] interesting one because that's an
[2861.84 - 2866.44] adrenal condition where there's
[2864.52 - 2868.80] different hormones in the adrenals that
[2866.44 - 2871.20] are undiscovered by research and Science
[2868.80 - 2874.04] and one of the hormones undiscovered by
[2871.20 - 2876.72] research and Science in the adrenals um
[2874.04 - 2878.24] is responsible for keeping your hair on
[2876.72 - 2879.60] your head and when that diminishes and
[2878.24 - 2881.08] science research will never know it
[2879.60 - 2884.32] diminishes CU they've never tagged it
[2881.08 - 2887.00] they've never discovered the the hormone
[2884.32 - 2889.64] so so that's how hair falls off with
[2887.00 - 2890.96] alopecia and alopecia can come back when
[2889.64 - 2892.36] you keep on you know healing your
[2890.96 - 2895.64] adrenals and all the different stuff we
[2892.36 - 2898.40] do for adrenals here at Medical medium
[2895.64 - 2900.28] um we keep on going Hashimoto like I
[2898.40 - 2903.04] said before that's a virus entering into
[2900.28 - 2905.84] the thyroid and there's a way of
[2903.04 - 2909.00] cleaning that out I don't like just
[2905.84 - 2912.00] management management is taking away
[2909.00 - 2915.00] some triggers like gluten and so forth
[2912.00 - 2917.28] and living a better lifestyle which of
[2915.00 - 2919.84] course we all want to do I don't like
[2917.28 - 2922.40] just relying on those for
[2919.84 - 2925.24] managing conditions I like knowing we're
[2922.40 - 2928.16] going after something I like knowing
[2925.24 - 2930.92] we're going after something and in the
[2928.16 - 2933.56] back of my mind I'm not thinking my
[2930.92 - 2936.40] body's you know betrayed
[2933.56 - 2938.56] me because that's what we're taught
[2936.40 - 2940.24] instead I like knowing we're going after
[2938.56 - 2942.48] something because I like the truth the
[2940.24 - 2945.40] truth matters I like knowing we're going
[2942.48 - 2949.32] after a bug so like with Hashimoto it's
[2945.40 - 2951.56] not about just getting symptoms better
[2949.32 - 2953.20] that's that's great we want that but we
[2951.56 - 2955.24] want to make sure that 10 years down the
[2953.20 - 2958.64] road it doesn't flare up again no matter
[2955.24 - 2961.08] what fancy expert showed us a new pull
[2958.64 - 2964.04] away triggers protocol and some you know
[2961.08 - 2965.72] New Tricks about how to minimize or
[2964.04 - 2968.20] break down hashimotos or anything I want
[2965.72 - 2970.00] to go past that I want to go way past
[2968.20 - 2972.80] that you guys I want to do what I've
[2970.00 - 2976.04] done all these years I want to go after
[2972.80 - 2979.16] the virus inside the thid kill it off
[2976.04 - 2982.24] kill it off so that down the road your
[2979.16 - 2984.76] Hashimoto can't come back so your
[2982.24 - 2986.68] thyroid doesn't fall apart like that
[2984.76 - 2988.04] house that mystery house condition I'm
[2986.68 - 2989.96] talking about at the beginning of this
[2988.04 - 2991.72] whole webinar where the Pain's peeling
[2989.96 - 2993.24] off the walls but it's brand new paint
[2991.72 - 2995.96] the water's leaking the ceiling but the
[2993.24 - 2998.12] Plumbing's fine I don't want want that
[2995.96 - 3000.44] happening 10 years down the road I want
[2998.12 - 3004.32] to go after that virus and kill
[3000.44 - 3007.52] it yeah I know it sounds pretty pretty
[3004.32 - 3008.84] tough sounds pretty tough but that's
[3007.52 - 3010.60] what happens when you know that's what
[3008.84 - 3012.20] it is you can go and do it so then you
[3010.60 - 3014.28] can come up with your plan you can come
[3012.20 - 3016.04] up with your game plan so not only is it
[3014.28 - 3020.80] it taking away
[3016.04 - 3023.04] triggers removing triggers that feed a
[3020.80 - 3025.88] condition we're going way above and
[3023.04 - 3027.64] beyond that we're realizing that the
[3025.88 - 3029.40] virus can feed on things that causes
[3027.64 - 3030.84] Hashimoto and that that's so far
[3029.40 - 3032.72] advanced in ahead of everybody it's not
[3030.84 - 3035.00] even funny I'm saying that so you don't
[3032.72 - 3037.48] get lost I'm not saying that because I'm
[3035.00 - 3039.68] trying to be Mr big man I'm saying that
[3037.48 - 3042.08] because you don't get lost because you
[3039.68 - 3044.56] can you can leave here and be like oh
[3042.08 - 3046.48] look at this and and that's what anybody
[3044.56 - 3049.64] can do that's normal human nature I
[3046.48 - 3051.92] totally understand it's so easy to do
[3049.64 - 3053.28] that but I don't want you getting lost
[3051.92 - 3054.72] you have to know that you're going after
[3053.28 - 3057.00] a bug and you're going after and you're
[3054.72 - 3059.72] killing it and that's the whole point
[3057.00 - 3062.64] that's what it's about so that you don't
[3059.72 - 3064.68] have a thyroid with nodules long down
[3062.64 - 3066.84] the road that keep on growing because of
[3064.68 - 3068.92] Epstein bar causing Scar Tissue so you
[3066.84 - 3071.96] don't and calcification so you don't
[3068.92 - 3073.52] have a condition let eating away your
[3071.96 - 3076.96] thyroid down the
[3073.52 - 3078.64] road and in one year sure you got your
[3076.96 - 3080.84] your numbers better at the doctor's
[3078.64 - 3082.76] office doesn't mean you don't have the
[3080.84 - 3086.12] virus cleaned up that's the whole point
[3082.76 - 3088.68] it can come back but it can't come back
[3086.12 - 3090.24] and it can't haunt you when you know the
[3088.68 - 3091.72] truth that your body's not attacking
[3090.24 - 3093.12] itself because if you don't know that
[3091.72 - 3095.84] down the road two years from now you be
[3093.12 - 3097.88] like oh here it goes my body's my body's
[3095.84 - 3100.08] attacking itself again because my loose
[3097.88 - 3102.52] blus symptoms are back my thyroid
[3100.08 - 3104.44] symptoms my numbers are off again even
[3102.52 - 3105.80] though I got great results from the last
[3104.44 - 3108.96] expert that told me to remove some
[3105.80 - 3110.72] triggers and I got great results but all
[3108.96 - 3113.72] of a sudden my numbers are climbing
[3110.72 - 3117.00] again because hey my my body might be
[3113.72 - 3119.00] attacking itself again
[3117.00 - 3120.36] right I mean I bet you some of you have
[3119.00 - 3121.60] been through that already some of you
[3120.36 - 3122.72] I'm not probably not all of you but some
[3121.60 - 3124.64] of you have probably been through that
[3122.72 - 3127.92] already you're probably nodding your
[3124.64 - 3129.56] head like yep I've seen that you don't
[3127.92 - 3131.04] want that happening you don't want it
[3129.56 - 3132.60] coming back you don't want it creeping
[3131.04 - 3134.20] back up and you don't want that whole
[3132.60 - 3135.84] poisonous thought saying well you know
[3134.20 - 3137.60] here goes my body again betraying itself
[3135.84 - 3139.40] I had it under control now my body's
[3137.60 - 3141.16] betraying itself again no your body's
[3139.40 - 3145.44] not betraying itself it's not attacking
[3141.16 - 3148.16] itself can't say that enough and we're
[3145.44 - 3151.32] going after the problem that's what
[3148.16 - 3154.72] we're going we're going after the
[3151.32 - 3157.32] problem so when it comes down to it
[3154.72 - 3159.80] comes down to like Celiac right Celiac
[3157.32 - 3162.88] or remove gluten you got this genetic
[3159.80 - 3166.56] problem chocked up the be genes it's not
[3162.88 - 3169.48] genes it's not genes Celiac is
[3166.56 - 3171.24] inflammation in the intestinal lining
[3169.48 - 3173.44] from bacteria and
[3171.24 - 3175.76] viruses that's what that is and if you
[3173.44 - 3177.88] eat certain foods protein from certain
[3175.76 - 3181.08] foods like gluten and so forth it can
[3177.88 - 3184.08] feed the virus or the bacteria and
[3181.08 - 3187.64] create a mysterious
[3184.08 - 3189.56] inflamation and throw everything off I
[3187.64 - 3192.72] mean it's just it's that
[3189.56 - 3194.44] simple it's that simple so it's
[3192.72 - 3197.32] important to understand these
[3194.44 - 3198.80] things colitis is the shingles virus
[3197.32 - 3200.56] that's the shingles virus sitting inside
[3198.80 - 3202.44] the lining of the intestinal tract
[3200.56 - 3204.16] that's what kitis is the colon It's the
[3202.44 - 3205.80] shingles virus sitting inside the lining
[3204.16 - 3207.60] of the intestinal tract
[3205.80 - 3210.48] it's a virus sitting
[3207.60 - 3212.08] there and that's a colitis is so when we
[3210.48 - 3214.32] take away dairy products and we take
[3212.08 - 3215.72] away gluten we stop feeding the virus we
[3214.32 - 3217.36] start getting it better but you need to
[3215.72 - 3221.76] know that colitis isn't your body
[3217.36 - 3225.32] destroying its own colon that is in the
[3221.76 - 3227.08] way of healing knowing that instead you
[3225.32 - 3230.12] got a viral condition that you're
[3227.08 - 3231.80] working on killing off and
[3230.12 - 3236.04] healing
[3231.80 - 3241.88] see it matters to know your your game
[3236.04 - 3245.44] the goal the goal end game it matters to
[3241.88 - 3247.16] know where you're going to win winning
[3245.44 - 3248.64] matters when it comes down to health and
[3247.16 - 3249.64] heck you don't even have to think about
[3248.64 - 3252.20] winning if you have the right
[3249.64 - 3254.72] information you just start to heal it
[3252.20 - 3258.80] happens along the way type 1 diabetes is
[3254.72 - 3261.32] an injury to the pancreas not your body
[3258.80 - 3264.08] attacking the pancreas type one type
[3261.32 - 3266.96] 1.5 it's not your body attacking the
[3264.08 - 3269.48] pancreas it's not an autoimmune
[3266.96 - 3272.60] condition instead it's a viral condition
[3269.48 - 3276.88] or it's injured tissue from a viral
[3272.60 - 3279.84] condition at one point or even a toxic
[3276.88 - 3281.16] bacteria that injured the pancreas at
[3279.84 - 3285.12] one
[3281.16 - 3288.12] point and that tissue in the pancreas is
[3285.12 - 3291.52] injured and that's how type one
[3288.12 - 3294.40] occurs it's an injury to the pancreas
[3291.52 - 3295.52] not caused by your body very important
[3294.40 - 3298.76] to understand you you could always
[3295.52 - 3299.88] listen to my my diabetes show can always
[3298.76 - 3303.56] listen to
[3299.88 - 3307.80] that um so that's important to know too
[3303.56 - 3310.44] hepatitis hepatitis A Hepatitis B C D is
[3307.80 - 3313.60] all viral they're just different stages
[3310.44 - 3315.40] of what the virus is doing to the liver
[3313.60 - 3318.36] so all the hepatitis that's not
[3315.40 - 3321.36] autoimmune autoimmune liver conditions
[3318.36 - 3323.04] hepatitis A B C and D and the term
[3321.36 - 3325.48] autoimmune
[3323.04 - 3327.36] hepatitis is a mistake All In its own
[3325.48 - 3331.32] with research and science they don't
[3327.36 - 3333.24] even know what virus hepatitis C virus
[3331.32 - 3335.68] or Hepatitis B virus is they have no
[3333.24 - 3340.32] idea cuz they've never found it they
[3335.68 - 3342.68] only find inflammation and markers and
[3340.32 - 3345.00] those antibodies that aren't destroying
[3342.68 - 3346.72] the liver antibodies the immune system
[3345.00 - 3350.68] is creating for
[3346.72 - 3353.16] you to go after a virus involving going
[3350.68 - 3356.40] after a virus the virus that causes all
[3353.16 - 3359.52] hepatitis is varieties of the herpetic
[3356.40 - 3361.68] family and you know mainly the Epstein
[3359.52 - 3364.48] bar does the
[3361.68 - 3366.84] hepatitis skin rashing
[3364.48 - 3369.44] Mysteries most of the skin rashing
[3366.84 - 3371.92] Mysteries are shingles variety exer and
[3369.44 - 3373.80] psoriasis is can be a hash Posh of a
[3371.92 - 3375.84] couple different viruses the Epstein bar
[3373.80 - 3377.92] and the shingles both inside the liver
[3375.84 - 3380.36] feeding off of high levels of copper and
[3377.92 - 3383.20] DDT but a lot of different mystery skin
[3380.36 - 3385.00] rashing conditions including lupus are
[3383.20 - 3386.72] you know different you know you know
[3385.00 - 3389.20] like lupus is is the Epstein bar
[3386.72 - 3391.32] releasing a lot of neurotoxin a lot of
[3389.20 - 3393.40] Dermot toxin but a lot of people have
[3391.32 - 3395.28] both shingles virus and epine Bar in
[3393.40 - 3397.36] their system creating a lot of
[3395.28 - 3399.44] dermatoxin and a lot of different you
[3397.36 - 3402.68] know varieties of of neurotoxins a lot
[3399.44 - 3404.40] of these mystery shingles varieties
[3402.68 - 3406.32] family of shingles but they won't
[3404.40 - 3408.24] diagnose with shingles because it
[3406.32 - 3411.24] doesn't have that textbook one
[3408.24 - 3413.00] grandfather textbook law you have to
[3411.24 - 3415.20] understand like
[3413.00 - 3417.00] shingles basically research search and
[3415.20 - 3419.52] science believe shingles is just this
[3417.00 - 3421.76] one type of shingles the one you see on
[3419.52 - 3424.40] on the TV commercials they don't know
[3421.76 - 3426.48] there's over 31 varieties that that that
[3424.40 - 3428.04] spirit and I have sourced 31 varieties
[3426.48 - 3430.04] meaning s I've sourced from Spirit that
[3428.04 - 3431.76] have helped people with it's in book one
[3430.04 - 3434.76] too I talk about it in book one medical
[3431.76 - 3436.44] medium but instead let's blame it on you
[3434.76 - 3439.32] that's the whole point let's blame it on
[3436.44 - 3442.92] you guys that's the fall Fallout it's
[3439.32 - 3445.72] all blamed on us all mystery illness is
[3442.92 - 3449.24] blamed on us that's where it
[3445.72 - 3450.64] goes and then not only blamed on us but
[3449.24 - 3452.96] if you go to the best alternative
[3450.64 - 3457.48] practitioners it's blamed on what we're
[3452.96 - 3459.68] doing that's not good enough either look
[3457.48 - 3461.08] you're hearing it from me I tell people
[3459.68 - 3462.92] if you're doing this and you're eating
[3461.08 - 3466.12] dairy products and you're eating
[3462.92 - 3467.60] eggs and you're eating gluten and you
[3466.12 - 3469.16] know and you're doing this and that it's
[3467.60 - 3470.24] not good you're going to hear that from
[3469.16 - 3472.16] me but you're going to hear something
[3470.24 - 3474.32] else because you're going to be feeding
[3472.16 - 3475.28] something inside of you that is causing
[3474.32 - 3477.20] this condition I condition you're going
[3475.28 - 3478.92] to hear the truth and it's not your body
[3477.20 - 3481.28] destroying itself but research and
[3478.92 - 3484.64] science wants you to believe your genes
[3481.28 - 3487.80] are faulty you got bad jeans jeans are
[3484.64 - 3491.44] so seductive in a way because they suck
[3487.80 - 3494.52] you in jeans are so
[3491.44 - 3497.36] tantalizingly you know like alluring
[3494.52 - 3499.44] because it's genes it's like it's it's
[3497.36 - 3501.08] science hey hardcore science we we're
[3499.44 - 3503.00] made of genes we got these hereditary
[3501.08 - 3504.92] traits we're but you need to know on
[3503.00 - 3507.44] none of these illnesses I have mentioned
[3504.92 - 3509.76] here have anything to do with genes and
[3507.44 - 3512.32] many more don't have anything to do with
[3509.76 - 3514.48] genes on any level but genetic science
[3512.32 - 3517.04] is grandfathered in going all the way
[3514.48 - 3518.52] back with the genome projects of the old
[3517.04 - 3522.40] days of the
[3518.52 - 3524.80] 1940s 1950s 19 late 1930s it's
[3522.40 - 3527.40] grandfathered in by law there are
[3524.80 - 3530.00] documents piled so high up in somebody's
[3527.40 - 3531.72] Vault that makes it so you're going to
[3530.00 - 3534.12] think genes are going to be the reason
[3531.72 - 3535.80] why you and your children are sick and
[3534.12 - 3538.28] your grandchild children is sick for the
[3535.80 - 3540.76] years to come and it's your body and
[3538.28 - 3542.40] it's you and it's your own faulty genes
[3540.76 - 3545.36] and they're going to have the answers to
[3542.40 - 3547.96] how to fix your jeans it's one of the
[3545.36 - 3551.04] greatest greatest mistakes of all time
[3547.96 - 3553.52] and it falls into the ballpark of your
[3551.04 - 3555.84] body's attacking itself as
[3553.52 - 3558.24] well so how do we clean up these
[3555.84 - 3560.92] autoimmune diseases and conditions and
[3558.24 - 3562.80] and illnesses how do we clean these
[3560.92 - 3566.32] things up how do we do what we need to
[3562.80 - 3568.28] do what's right taking triggers away is
[3566.32 - 3570.16] critical but knowing what you're doing
[3568.28 - 3572.76] and why you're doing it is more critical
[3570.16 - 3574.84] with it making sure you're eliminating
[3572.76 - 3577.92] toxic heavy metals because they feed the
[3574.84 - 3580.96] viruses that cause these conditions so
[3577.92 - 3583.32] you want to remove these toxic heavy
[3580.96 - 3585.72] metals that's important you want to
[3583.32 - 3587.76] start bringing in foods like the wild
[3585.72 - 3590.36] blueberries you can get the Frozen wild
[3587.76 - 3592.36] blueberries you bring those in because
[3590.36 - 3594.80] they start pulling out heavy metals you
[3592.36 - 3598.04] want to bring in some spirulina I said
[3594.80 - 3601.00] it before in book one and I think in
[3598.04 - 3604.20] book two life-changing foods that
[3601.00 - 3607.60] carella is not as good as spirulina
[3604.20 - 3611.04] spirulina removes metal holds on to it
[3607.60 - 3612.68] longer and helps get it out of the body
[3611.04 - 3615.48] carella drops it
[3612.68 - 3617.84] instantly I said this in the books and
[3615.48 - 3620.68] then I recently saw on the internet
[3617.84 - 3625.12] somewhere someone who
[3620.68 - 3627.28] even read my book still saying
[3625.12 - 3630.64] that no Corella is better it's way
[3627.28 - 3632.88] better the science behind it you name it
[3630.64 - 3634.48] I don't care about science and research
[3632.88 - 3635.88] I care about it in a lot of ways but I
[3634.48 - 3638.44] don't care about it when it comes down
[3635.88 - 3639.92] to your chronic illness because it never
[3638.44 - 3642.40] has it right when it comes down to your
[3639.92 - 3644.20] chronic illness I'm just being honest it
[3642.40 - 3647.40] never has it
[3644.20 - 3650.00] right and you want what's going to work
[3647.40 - 3652.12] s sparina really takes out the metals
[3650.00 - 3655.36] it's not sloppy it doesn't drop the
[3652.12 - 3658.16] metals cilantro is a great one
[3655.36 - 3661.12] but you want the metals out so that's
[3658.16 - 3663.28] one thing you want to do but always keep
[3661.12 - 3666.00] in mind that when you're dealing with
[3663.28 - 3668.16] autoimmune just any sense of it
[3666.00 - 3670.08] regardless of what it is meaning you get
[3668.16 - 3672.52] a diagnosis whatever that could be
[3670.08 - 3674.84] whether it's Hashimoto or anything or
[3672.52 - 3676.32] anything else we discussed already um
[3674.84 - 3677.76] the different names and labels and
[3676.32 - 3680.28] diseases and illnesses whether it's
[3677.76 - 3682.56] eamus rasis Hashimoto whether it's lupus
[3680.28 - 3685.16] whether it's rheumatoid arthritis always
[3682.56 - 3688.20] keep in mind that heavy metals
[3685.16 - 3690.28] they're not the cause of Lupus they're
[3688.20 - 3693.28] not the cause of
[3690.28 - 3695.60] Hashimoto and they're not the cause of
[3693.28 - 3698.16] different things they're just they're
[3695.60 - 3700.84] they're a food heavy metals are a food
[3698.16 - 3703.36] and always keep that in mind that it's
[3700.84 - 3704.12] it's a food just like when you're eating
[3703.36 - 3707.00] a
[3704.12 - 3710.64] food it's the same thing so when you're
[3707.00 - 3713.96] eating the eggs that feed an Invader
[3710.64 - 3717.08] that feed a pathogen that feed a virus
[3713.96 - 3718.88] causing lupus causing Hashimoto being
[3717.08 - 3722.24] able to get that strength and causing
[3718.88 - 3725.04] Hashimoto when you're feeding that virus
[3722.24 - 3727.32] with a food it likes to feed off of or
[3725.04 - 3730.16] it likes to eat when you're doing that
[3727.32 - 3733.88] realize that there's also other foods
[3730.16 - 3735.04] and heavy metals are that food and
[3733.88 - 3737.84] that's you know that's the whole thing
[3735.04 - 3741.56] is the heavy metals the Mercury the AR
[3737.84 - 3743.16] arsenic um cadmium lead nickel nickel's
[3741.56 - 3745.28] another one that's really out there it's
[3743.16 - 3748.68] inner system alloy
[3745.28 - 3750.40] um steel actually steel you know what is
[3748.68 - 3752.88] steel it's steel can be a different
[3750.40 - 3755.40] blend of different things but it's the
[3752.88 - 3758.84] it's literally these things can get into
[3755.40 - 3762.24] US Mercury being the worst aluminum and
[3758.84 - 3766.24] um and so and as far as when it comes
[3762.24 - 3769.12] down to uh labels like meaning labels we
[3766.24 - 3773.64] get given we were given for you or
[3769.12 - 3775.24] diagnosis for a condition and realize
[3773.64 - 3777.88] that whatever it may be that's in the
[3775.24 - 3780.72] autoimmune field or Arena that we want
[3777.88 - 3784.04] the heavy metals out of our system we
[3780.72 - 3785.96] want the heavy metals out of our body
[3784.04 - 3788.12] because it's an additional food is what
[3785.96 - 3789.92] it is like the copper like you know too
[3788.12 - 3793.20] high of copper inside the liver when it
[3789.92 - 3795.80] comes down to examon psoriasis for a
[3793.20 - 3797.56] pathogen to feed off of for a virus to
[3795.80 - 3801.16] feed off of so that virus will feed off
[3797.56 - 3803.92] that copper so you want that you want to
[3801.16 - 3805.92] lower your metal load so not just lower
[3803.92 - 3808.08] your spiral load like I always say with
[3805.92 - 3810.80] all the different things it's lowering
[3808.08 - 3813.04] your metal load lowering lowering your
[3810.80 - 3814.72] heavy metal load and when you're doing
[3813.04 - 3816.56] that I like the heavy metal detox
[3814.72 - 3818.84] smoothie that I've always recommended
[3816.56 - 3821.00] it's on the blog I got a Blog with it
[3818.84 - 3823.32] you know the whole bit you guys know um
[3821.00 - 3826.60] sure many of you might have known that
[3823.32 - 3829.36] and you know it's the spirulina it's the
[3826.60 - 3832.00] vimer barleygrass juice powder um it's
[3829.36 - 3833.12] the Atlantic uh sea vegetables the
[3832.00 - 3835.68] Atlantic
[3833.12 - 3837.12] douls that that's also incredible to
[3835.68 - 3840.44] have in there the
[3837.12 - 3843.76] cilantro and the Frozen wild blueberries
[3840.44 - 3847.60] all of these work together they all work
[3843.76 - 3849.48] together it's just one doesn't do all
[3847.60 - 3851.32] it's they all work together because they
[3849.48 - 3854.28] hold on to the metal and take it to a
[3851.32 - 3855.72] certain degree certain part of of
[3854.28 - 3857.64] eliminating out of the body that takes
[3855.72 - 3860.64] it to a certain degree of eliminating it
[3857.64 - 3863.36] out of the body and then that next thing
[3860.64 - 3865.76] grabs onto it that's how it works that
[3863.36 - 3867.56] next um like the barley grass then grabs
[3865.76 - 3869.24] on to it then the dols takes it down to
[3867.56 - 3871.20] the end you know and the cilantro is
[3869.24 - 3873.88] extracting it from organs then the wild
[3871.20 - 3875.52] blueberries extracting it from the brain
[3873.88 - 3879.72] all these things matter and so the heavy
[3875.52 - 3882.00] metal detox is a great a great um way to
[3879.72 - 3884.12] pull these Metals out over time doesn't
[3882.00 - 3886.28] happen in one day although metal leaves
[3884.12 - 3889.32] in one day heavy metals toxic heavy
[3886.28 - 3890.88] metals are leaving in one day they they
[3889.32 - 3892.96] they're leaving the body in one day when
[3890.88 - 3895.92] you start drinking that they start to
[3892.96 - 3898.28] leave the body in that one day but they
[3895.92 - 3900.60] they it's a slow process a slow process
[3898.28 - 3902.16] and then the body needs its time to heal
[3900.60 - 3904.36] and the virus needs to be the viruses
[3902.16 - 3906.12] and pathogens need to have their cut off
[3904.36 - 3908.20] where they're not getting fed anymore
[3906.12 - 3910.92] all this matters and it all helps to
[3908.20 - 3912.92] eliminate autoimmune something to just
[3910.92 - 3914.80] be focused on to something to really
[3912.92 - 3916.84] think about the other thing is you you
[3914.80 - 3918.56] don't want foods that feed the viruses
[3916.84 - 3922.20] that create autoimmune you don't want
[3918.56 - 3924.80] Foods doing that you don't want eggs I
[3922.20 - 3928.16] know eggs are considered a perfect food
[3924.80 - 3930.00] I mean I have to tell you how many times
[3928.16 - 3932.88] how much information I put out about
[3930.00 - 3935.60] eggs feeding viruses they're literally
[3932.88 - 3937.76] they incubate a virus that's what they
[3935.60 - 3941.20] do I don't care if they're free range
[3937.76 - 3944.32] pasturised in your backyard I mean free
[3941.20 - 3946.28] pasture past pasture you know like
[3944.32 - 3949.84] they're just able to walk in grass and
[3946.28 - 3952.72] Peck away it's all better better than a
[3949.84 - 3955.20] conventional egg that's contaminated 10
[3952.72 - 3957.44] time 10 with it injected hormones and
[3955.20 - 3960.68] aluminum God forbid everything else but
[3957.44 - 3964.56] the point is is that eggs in general no
[3960.68 - 3968.00] matter what and where they feed all the
[3964.56 - 3970.32] viruses they really instigate lupus PCOS
[3968.00 - 3974.08] they're really terrible for PCOS
[3970.32 - 3975.56] it's it it's sad when I see some of the
[3974.08 - 3977.92] best doctors out there like no you got
[3975.56 - 3980.12] to eat eggs if you got PCOS you got to
[3977.92 - 3985.48] eat lots of protein lots of eggs it's
[3980.12 - 3988.32] disastrous for ovary issues dis asterus
[3985.48 - 3991.60] it also feeds every virus that creates
[3988.32 - 3994.48] literally every different virus every
[3991.60 - 3996.60] different bacteria that creates every
[3994.48 - 3999.76] autoimmune condition that's labeled
[3996.60 - 3999.76] autoimmune out there with
[4000.48 - 4007.24] confusion and those eggs can really
[4004.48 - 4008.56] feed the viruses so we have to think
[4007.24 - 4010.08] about that we have to be cautious about
[4008.56 - 4012.08] it try to keep them out the best we can
[4010.08 - 4014.20] now if it's the only thing you can eat
[4012.08 - 4015.68] and you got no money and you got no way
[4014.20 - 4017.36] to survive and you got a friend that
[4015.68 - 4019.08] gives you eggs and that's your survival
[4017.36 - 4021.88] I'm on board 100% then we do other
[4019.08 - 4024.64] things we do other things along with it
[4021.88 - 4026.20] I'm on board 100% we'll do other things
[4024.64 - 4029.12] but if you can and you have the
[4026.20 - 4031.08] resources and you have the ability to
[4029.12 - 4034.96] keep eggs out of the diet you got to do
[4031.08 - 4038.24] it how it works is the virus looks for
[4034.96 - 4039.88] egg material what's egg material
[4038.24 - 4042.08] hormones that are naturally in eggs
[4039.88 - 4044.76] natural hormones natural hormones that
[4042.08 - 4046.52] are in eggs not n injected ones not
[4044.76 - 4049.36] foreign ones natural ones that are from
[4046.52 - 4051.80] the chicken inside eggs looks for those
[4049.36 - 4055.24] and it feeds off of
[4051.80 - 4058.44] those and it uses it as fuel it turn
[4055.24 - 4059.76] it's a steroid to a virus that's what
[4058.44 - 4063.16] it's like it's like us doing human
[4059.76 - 4065.96] growth hormone it's a steroid literally
[4063.16 - 4068.40] to a virus that's how it works dairy
[4065.96 - 4072.04] product same thing it's very similar
[4068.40 - 4073.44] keep away from all Dairy so yeah sure I
[4072.04 - 4074.52] mean there's practitioners out there now
[4073.44 - 4076.00] that know better better they've learned
[4074.52 - 4077.80] over the years that okay we got to take
[4076.00 - 4080.60] away Dairy we'll get your Hashimoto
[4077.80 - 4082.84] better we'll take away Dairy too but no
[4080.60 - 4085.12] it takes more than that it takes knowing
[4082.84 - 4087.32] everything I talked about it takes it
[4085.12 - 4089.88] all you don't want to feed once you know
[4087.32 - 4092.00] you're starving out the bug that's
[4089.88 - 4094.56] creating your lupus your aer's dandro
[4092.00 - 4097.44] syndrome your ra rart arthritis your
[4094.56 - 4099.80] your Ms multiple sclerosis your Celiac
[4097.44 - 4101.96] your vido your alopecia your psorisis
[4099.80 - 4104.92] your your eczema your colitis your
[4101.96 - 4108.52] Hashim Modas your Addison your Addison
[4104.92 - 4113.08] by the way which is also a condition
[4108.52 - 4115.44] that's that's viral 100% Graves
[4113.08 - 4118.24] hyperthyroidism is not the body
[4115.44 - 4120.20] attacking the thyroid it's it's the
[4118.24 - 4123.04] Epstein BS one of the mutated versions
[4120.20 - 4126.16] of the Epstein bar that's recreating
[4123.04 - 4130.00] that's actually causing inflammation and
[4126.16 - 4132.36] then the thyroid the thyroid is being is
[4130.00 - 4135.00] being scarred from it from the virus
[4132.36 - 4136.88] itself scarring up the thyroid thyroid
[4135.00 - 4138.40] and that you need to know that's how it
[4136.88 - 4141.20] works with Graves I'm going explain it
[4138.40 - 4143.92] in more detail over time shog syndrome
[4141.20 - 4147.76] type 1 diabetes hepatitis A B C D lyan
[4143.92 - 4150.40] sclerosis stic arthritis and more all
[4147.76 - 4152.12] these different conditions there's bugs
[4150.40 - 4154.56] that are feeding off of stuff and once
[4152.12 - 4156.20] you starve the bugs once you starve the
[4154.56 - 4159.36] bugs of what they like to eat and then
[4156.20 - 4161.88] you go after the bugs and you build up
[4159.36 - 4165.36] your immune system and you also go after
[4161.88 - 4166.28] the bugs you really become freed from
[4165.36 - 4169.28] the
[4166.28 - 4172.96] autoimmune confusion you become freed
[4169.28 - 4174.80] from it over time and you heal over time
[4172.96 - 4176.84] your neurological conditions your
[4174.80 - 4180.84] neurological symptoms get
[4176.84 - 4183.56] better all of them start getting better
[4180.84 - 4185.68] tingles numbness aches and pains
[4183.56 - 4189.08] floaters in the
[4185.68 - 4190.60] eyes all of it can start getting better
[4189.08 - 4194.36] anxiety
[4190.60 - 4197.40] depression inflammation rashes
[4194.36 - 4198.40] severe fatigue all of it can start
[4197.40 - 4201.08] getting
[4198.40 - 4203.48] better so let's talk about um what we
[4201.08 - 4205.96] can do secret weapons here you know
[4203.48 - 4207.84] supplements are critical they are
[4205.96 - 4210.12] critical a lot of people though that are
[4207.84 - 4211.68] so inflamed they can only handle so much
[4210.12 - 4213.36] I mean go to your doctor go to your
[4211.68 - 4215.16] practitioner that you love and Trust
[4213.36 - 4216.76] bring them this information bring them
[4215.16 - 4219.24] the supplement information if you need
[4216.76 - 4222.00] to ask them about it you know work with
[4219.24 - 4224.60] somebody that you love and that's always
[4222.00 - 4227.12] the best way to do it anyway
[4224.60 - 4229.48] but but there's a lot of things that
[4227.12 - 4231.60] need to be understood one is severe zinc
[4229.48 - 4235.20] deficiencies zinc
[4231.60 - 4238.20] deficiencies is be is caused
[4235.20 - 4240.76] by the viral issues that cause the
[4238.20 - 4242.40] autoimmune labels and diseases and
[4240.76 - 4245.76] conditions so getting your zinc in a
[4242.40 - 4247.68] better place is a huge step huge step
[4245.76 - 4249.56] makes a big difference talk here
[4247.68 - 4252.88] practitioner about zinc I mean get the
[4249.56 - 4255.00] right zinc we have um um like you know
[4252.88 - 4257.68] this this page the page that you're
[4255.00 - 4259.12] looking at right now make sure those are
[4257.68 - 4260.52] the supplements that you're focused on

[4260.52 - 4264.76] best kind the best variety the best type
[4263.12 - 4266.68] they don't have poisons in them they
[4264.76 - 4268.40] don't have all the citric acid in them
[4266.68 - 4270.72] they don't have they're the right kind
[4268.40 - 4272.56] that work it's a big that's a big thing
[4270.72 - 4275.56] I do have to say that supplements matter
[4272.56 - 4277.40] the kind they are the ones that spirit

[4290.08 - 4295.12] practitioners about anything about
[4292.36 - 4298.84] dosages or anything else but you need to
[4295.12 - 4300.36] know um you need to know that zinc is
[4298.84 - 4302.84] critical for
[4300.36 - 4305.04] autoimmune anything
[4302.84 - 4307.80] autoimmune that means all the conditions
[4305.04 - 4309.80] symptoms all that zinc is is important
[4307.80 - 4313.32] because what zinc does is it shuts down
[4309.80 - 4315.44] viruses it slows down viruses it slows
[4313.32 - 4317.76] them down when you put a little bit of
[4315.44 - 4320.64] zinc the right kind that we that we have
[4317.76 - 4324.04] listed a little bit of zinc in your
[4320.64 - 4326.40] mouth the right kind it goes to the
[4324.04 - 4328.24] thyroid and the upam bar that's sitting
[4326.40 - 4330.88] in there causing hashimotos thyroiditis
[4328.24 - 4335.16] or any kind of hypothyroidism or any
[4330.88 - 4337.60] hyperthyroidism that virus gets hit hard
[4335.16 - 4339.92] hit real hard we can't function with
[4337.60 - 4342.28] with the right kind of zinc in the body
[4339.92 - 4344.72] not to mention the zinc increases your
[4342.28 - 4349.20] immune system's ability to fight fight
[4344.72 - 4352.40] more for you so that's one thing the B12
[4349.20 - 4354.40] the B12 is is important now hey you're
[4352.40 - 4356.04] going to say well I know about B12 hey
[4354.40 - 4358.40] this expert said about B12 I'm talking
[4356.04 - 4360.52] about the right kind still to this day I
[4358.40 - 4363.56] don't think the best practitioners are
[4360.52 - 4365.44] us even using the adenos sil cobalamin
[4363.56 - 4367.52] the methyl cobalamin with adenos Sil
[4365.44 - 4369.72] cobalamin when it comes down to
[4367.52 - 4371.32] autoimmune any conditions any symptoms
[4369.72 - 4374.96] that we talk about all of this when it
[4371.32 - 4377.96] comes down to it you have to have the
[4374.96 - 4381.04] methyl and the adino they have to be
[4377.96 - 4383.72] both that's what matters the adino silab
[4381.04 - 4386.56] balamin has everything to do with
[4383.72 - 4389.24] something that goes wrong which is the G
[4386.56 - 4392.80] mutation thing it's not a g mutation
[4389.24 - 4394.80] okay methylation is not a gene mutation
[4392.80 - 4396.72] you can listen to the show um you know
[4394.80 - 4399.72] the radio show on that next time you you
[4396.72 - 4401.44] know you have a chance but methylation
[4399.72 - 4404.52] problems are caused and the gene
[4401.44 - 4405.56] mutations that occur on on blood work
[4404.52 - 4407.20] it's which is really just an
[4405.56 - 4408.60] inflammatory test it's not even a real
[4407.20 - 4412.04] gene mutation you have to understand
[4408.60 - 4415.44] it's caused by a viral condition viruses
[4412.04 - 4418.36] cause methylation problems in order to
[4415.44 - 4422.24] heal a methylation problem it's not just
[4418.36 - 4424.80] the methyl folate you need you need the
[4422.24 - 4427.76] adinos silab balamin combined this is a
[4424.80 - 4430.84] secret weapon to stopping and healing
[4427.76 - 4432.80] autoimmune problems is you need the
[4430.84 - 4434.52] adinos sil cobalamin mixed with the
[4432.80 - 4436.84] methab follow in is something that
[4434.52 - 4439.36] nobody knew about I mean literally I've
[4436.84 - 4441.44] been I I waited for the first one to
[4439.36 - 4443.40] ever come out and then I've been the
[4441.44 - 4446.48] person to get the information out about
[4443.40 - 4449.68] it it's so important and what that does
[4446.48 - 4453.80] is it helps to repair methylation issues
[4449.68 - 4456.40] methylation issues or is a liver problem
[4453.80 - 4458.76] because someone's been viral so long
[4456.40 - 4461.00] creating autoimmune symptoms and
[4458.76 - 4463.36] conditions that's really I'm going to
[4461.00 - 4467.16] give you the nutshell on methylation
[4463.36 - 4470.80] it's a liver condition it's when a liver
[4467.16 - 4474.16] cannot um cannot
[4470.80 - 4479.08] redesign chemical compounds to make them
[4474.16 - 4481.12] more available for our body to use to
[4479.08 - 4484.08] help heal and get the nervous system
[4481.12 - 4486.28] stronger get the immune system stronger
[4484.08 - 4489.68] so that's what's happening and everybody
[4486.28 - 4491.64] with ra and lupus and Ms and Celiac and
[4489.68 - 4493.68] even Lyme disease and Vigo and
[4491.64 - 4496.32] everything we got here everybody body
[4493.68 - 4499.80] has a condition where there's a lowgrade
[4496.32 - 4502.72] viral issue deep inside the body or a
[4499.80 - 4506.60] pathogen deep inside the body and it
[4502.72 - 4510.28] usually resides in the liver many times
[4506.60 - 4512.96] causing methylation problems over time
[4510.28 - 4516.16] and this gets completely misconstrued
[4512.96 - 4519.32] completely um um thrown off by the
[4516.16 - 4521.56] medical research and science people and
[4519.32 - 4524.32] they don't understand that it's because
[4521.56 - 4526.64] of this viral condition Crea creating a
[4524.32 - 4529.08] tremendous amount of poison toxins in
[4526.64 - 4533.08] the liver so the liver
[4529.08 - 4535.48] cannot do what it needs to do meaning
[4533.08 - 4537.44] rearrange chemical compounds create new
[4535.48 - 4539.84] chemical compounds that attach to other
[4537.44 - 4542.00] chemical compounds that we ingest or eat
[4539.84 - 4543.68] and combine and make methylation
[4542.00 - 4546.20] possible in a
[4543.68 - 4548.60] nutshell so the denal cobalamin the
[4546.20 - 4550.48] methab balamin is great way these are
[4548.60 - 4553.04] great starting
[4550.48 - 4554.60] points for doing what you need to do if
[4553.04 - 4557.60] you you may you may say hey I've been on
[4554.60 - 4560.16] B12 I'm not better no no it's got to be
[4557.60 - 4562.40] it's got to be the this kind this be the
[4560.16 - 4566.12] dino soab balaman comined okay so that's
[4562.40 - 4569.28] important to know um so that's one
[4566.12 - 4570.64] secret weapon if you can handle sparina
[4569.28 - 4571.68] you know a lot of people are sensitive
[4570.64 - 4573.16] they can't handle any kind of
[4571.68 - 4574.60] supplements where they get sensitive and
[4573.16 - 4576.32] they don't like it or it doesn't feel
[4574.60 - 4577.92] good in their stomach or they feel like
[4576.32 - 4579.96] they don't feel good from it you know
[4577.92 - 4583.20] spiralen is really good that's another
[4579.96 - 4585.68] great one vitamin C now if you're into
[4583.20 - 4587.60] animal products if you're into you know
[4585.68 - 4589.28] make sure it's the cleanest animal meats
[4587.60 - 4592.04] you know and whatever you eat I would
[4589.28 - 4593.44] stay away from chicken um if you're an
[4592.04 - 4595.08] into animal products I would probably
[4593.44 - 4597.60] keep it a little salmon if you're if
[4595.08 - 4599.88] you're okay with that and uh maybe some
[4597.60 - 4601.88] grass-fed beef if you really like that
[4599.88 - 4603.60] and maybe some you know some wild game
[4601.88 - 4606.08] or something if you really like that but
[4603.60 - 4608.72] here's the deal if you're into animal
[4606.08 - 4611.68] products don't over eat the animal
[4608.72 - 4613.32] Foods because you need room for all the
[4611.68 - 4615.00] other secret weapons for all the fruits
[4613.32 - 4616.76] and vegetables you need room for the
[4615.00 - 4618.84] celery you need room for the celery
[4616.76 - 4620.48] juices you need room for the smoothies
[4618.84 - 4622.88] you need room for the fruits you need
[4620.48 - 4625.36] room for the berries you need room for
[4622.88 - 4627.32] the greens you need more room for the
[4625.36 - 4630.96] cauliflower the
[4627.32 - 4632.76] vegetables do not be afraid of I can't
[4630.96 - 4635.36] believe till this day
[4632.76 - 4638.28] still there's all these alternative guys
[4635.36 - 4640.12] out there and gals talking about how
[4638.28 - 4642.16] stay away from cabbage stay away from
[4640.12 - 4644.72] broccoli stay away from broccoli Rob
[4642.16 - 4647.56] stay away from col flower stay away from
[4644.72 - 4649.80] um kale with a thyroid condition
[4647.56 - 4651.44] meanwhile what's in those actually kills
[4649.80 - 4653.24] off the virus and that's that's an
[4651.44 - 4655.60] example right there of what happens when
[4653.24 - 4657.40] you don't know what's causing a problem
[4655.60 - 4659.40] so with Hashimoto thyroiditis if you
[4657.40 - 4661.04] don't know there's a virus actually
[4659.40 - 4664.20] causing the problem and you're still in
[4661.04 - 4667.40] the dark in Antiquity land back in in in
[4664.20 - 4669.84] antique times of of information back
[4667.40 - 4671.44] where it's outdated already I mean this
[4669.84 - 4673.44] new literature coming out is already
[4671.44 - 4675.72] outdated right off the press and and
[4673.44 - 4677.48] right there believe stay away from these
[4675.72 - 4680.12] gorog genic Foods these compounds that
[4677.48 - 4682.80] are in these Foods don't they don't even
[4680.12 - 4684.28] realize that what's in that food kills
[4682.80 - 4686.00] off the very virus that's causing your
[4684.28 - 4689.24] Hashimoto thyroiditis you don't have to
[4686.00 - 4690.72] worry about the quen compound once once
[4689.24 - 4693.76] you know these people they don't know
[4690.72 - 4696.36] that you get in trouble you keep away
[4693.76 - 4698.52] from kale which is incredible for any
[4696.36 - 4700.20] kind of condition autoimmune condition
[4698.52 - 4703.08] incredible for any kind of viral
[4700.20 - 4705.84] condition so kale and broccoli you you
[4703.08 - 4707.20] can't be afraid of those you have to
[4705.84 - 4709.88] bring those
[4707.20 - 4711.60] in but it give you some simple basic you
[4709.88 - 4714.48] know powerful ways you know cucumber
[4711.60 - 4716.96] juice a great way of healing from any
[4714.48 - 4718.68] condition that's especially like all
[4716.96 - 4720.96] these different autoimmune conditions
[4718.68 - 4723.68] because it helps flush out toxins that
[4720.96 - 4725.08] the viruses are creating that's another
[4723.68 - 4726.60] reason why people are so sick they get
[4725.08 - 4729.12] the combination of the neurological
[4726.60 - 4732.44] fatigue the combination of the fatigue
[4729.12 - 4734.72] and the rashes and the head spins and
[4732.44 - 4736.44] the balance issues and the floaters in
[4734.72 - 4738.04] the eyes and the tingles and numbness
[4736.44 - 4739.64] and the anxiety and they get all these
[4738.04 - 4741.52] different combinations and the weight
[4739.64 - 4742.68] gain and the adrenal fatigue and
[4741.52 - 4744.76] everything else they get all these
[4742.68 - 4747.00] different combinations of
[4744.76 - 4749.52] problems a lot of it is because you have
[4747.00 - 4752.16] the pathogen and you have all the poison
[4749.52 - 4753.92] it's creating that's creating all these
[4752.16 - 4755.56] different symptoms it's completely a
[4753.92 - 4757.40] mystery to all medical research and
[4755.56 - 4760.08] Science and the best experts telling you
[4757.40 - 4761.88] right now and one way of flushing out a
[4760.08 - 4763.96] lot of the poison to make it simplistic
[4761.88 - 4765.96] and make it easy for you so this doesn't
[4763.96 - 4767.72] so this isn't overwhelming as you get
[4765.96 - 4769.72] your cucumber juice going every single
[4767.72 - 4771.28] day and you get a celery juice going
[4769.72 - 4772.92] every single day you start removing
[4771.28 - 4774.44] those poisons the celery juice the
[4772.92 - 4776.00] mineral salts and the celery juice start
[4774.44 - 4777.88] to clean up the liver they start to
[4776.00 - 4780.20] build up your hydrochloric acid start to
[4777.88 - 4782.40] strengthen the bile so you can break
[4780.20 - 4785.16] down bacteria and viruses that are
[4782.40 - 4788.12] inside the intestinal tract that cause
[4785.16 - 4789.68] colitis it all matters so you get the
[4788.12 - 4792.12] celery juice you got the cucumber juice
[4789.68 - 4793.36] it's one example right there and you got
[4792.12 - 4796.20] the Smoothie where we're going to we're
[4793.36 - 4799.76] going to talk about that we got for you
[4796.20 - 4801.16] as well that you'll see later and so
[4799.76 - 4804.16] these are some of the things to be you
[4801.16 - 4805.56] know to work with so some other things
[4804.16 - 4807.88] with with autoimmune that are really
[4805.56 - 4811.72] helpful just just basic founded
[4807.88 - 4815.04] foundational pieces nettle leaf tea
[4811.72 - 4818.96] nettle leaf and lemon balm nettle Leaf
[4815.04 - 4821.28] capsules are fine um lemon balm tea is
[4818.96 - 4823.72] really good these are powerful things
[4821.28 - 4827.92] now remember when you drink a cup of
[4823.72 - 4830.48] lemon balm tea when you drink a cup of
[4827.92 - 4834.00] that and you think your body's attacking
[4830.48 - 4837.92] itself it's not going to Harbor the
[4834.00 - 4840.92] power as much as it Harbors when you
[4837.92 - 4843.44] drink that lemon balm tea knowing that
[4840.92 - 4846.76] there's a phytochemical in the lemon
[4843.44 - 4849.24] balm itself that's going after the virus
[4846.76 - 4852.04] that's attacking your body it's not you
[4849.24 - 4854.76] or your body attacking it's the virus
[4852.04 - 4858.12] and that lemon bomb tea is killing it
[4854.76 - 4861.12] that lemon bomb tea is actually killing
[4858.12 - 4863.20] off the bug or whatever bug you have or
[4861.12 - 4865.36] pathogen that you have that's causing
[4863.20 - 4867.32] your multitude of symptoms and diagnosis
[4865.36 - 4869.64] and millions of doctor bills and
[4867.32 - 4871.20] everything else and and sadness and
[4869.64 - 4873.88] depression and and everything you've
[4871.20 - 4876.60] been through there's a bug in there and
[4873.88 - 4878.80] when that lemon bomb has a phytochemical
[4876.60 - 4881.64] and it's destroying and killing that
[4878.80 - 4883.28] virus in that bug
[4881.64 - 4885.48] directly
[4883.28 - 4889.00] Everything
[4885.48 - 4894.40] Changes Everything
[4889.00 - 4896.40] Changes being straight out everything
[4894.40 - 4899.00] changes right
[4896.40 - 4900.44] there so you got to have that in your
[4899.00 - 4903.00] hand you have the power of that in your
[4900.44 - 4905.36] hand so I like I like for you know I
[4903.00 - 4908.12] like the lemon balm I like the nettle
[4905.36 - 4909.36] Leaf nettle Leaf is an anti-inflammatory
[4908.12 - 4911.40] do you know why it's an
[4909.36 - 4913.40] anti-inflammatory you know why if you go
[4911.40 - 4914.84] and look up like herbal stuff out there
[4913.40 - 4916.32] and some top herbalist they'll be like
[4914.84 - 4919.32] oh it's
[4916.32 - 4920.80] anti-inflammatory it's anti- this why
[4919.32 - 4921.84] why is it anti-inflammatory because
[4920.80 - 4924.00] nobody knows you know why it's
[4921.84 - 4926.68] anti-inflammatory because it kills
[4924.00 - 4929.80] something it kills
[4926.68 - 4934.68] something it's killing the
[4929.80 - 4939.00] bug that's trying to bother you invade
[4934.68 - 4942.24] you that's why that's how it works
[4939.00 - 4945.52] that's how it works you know turmeric
[4942.24 - 4947.76] same with turmeric why is turmeric
[4945.52 - 4948.96] anti-inflammatory how's that possible
[4947.76 - 4950.20] why is it anti-inflammatory well it's
[4948.96 - 4951.52] got a flight of chemicals in there
[4950.20 - 4953.48] science researchers looking into
[4951.52 - 4955.44] turmeric they're finding different
[4953.48 - 4956.56] alkaloids in turmeric they're finding
[4955.44 - 4958.00] different you know different things that
[4956.56 - 4961.80] can actually get inflammation down
[4958.00 - 4964.56] that's not it no it's got phytochemicals
[4961.80 - 4966.96] that are poisonous to bugs that keep
[4964.56 - 4970.44] people's joints inflamed that keeps
[4966.96 - 4972.64] their backs inflamed like shingles going
[4970.44 - 4974.32] after somebody's back and sciatic neres
[4972.64 - 4976.04] sciatica caus you know it's deep
[4974.32 - 4978.24] shingles in there you don't even have to
[4976.04 - 4979.56] have the rash at all I talk about that
[4978.24 - 4982.28] there's there's non- rashing and there's
[4979.56 - 4985.64] rashing and that's the turmeric
[4982.28 - 4989.68] phytochemicals going in and killing off
[4985.64 - 4993.60] lowering a viral load lowering a viral
[4989.68 - 4996.40] load man it's a whole new world it's a
[4993.60 - 4999.92] whole new world when you connect the
[4996.40 - 5001.48] dots when you have the truth it's a
[4999.92 - 5003.16] whole new
[5001.48 - 5005.36] world
[5003.16 - 5007.16] so Foods I want you guys to you know I
[5005.36 - 5008.84] want you guys to work on squash having
[5007.16 - 5010.64] that in your diet winter squash is
[5008.84 - 5012.56] really good Buttercup Butternut get
[5010.64 - 5014.56] those in there very important pumpkin is
[5012.56 - 5016.68] actually amazing for people you get
[5014.56 - 5018.36] pumpkin seeds are good too don't be
[5016.68 - 5021.08] afraid of pumpkin seeds they're very
[5018.36 - 5022.08] supportive for um for antiviral stuff
[5021.08 - 5025.32] because they do have a little bit of
[5022.08 - 5026.80] zinc in them and that's supportive but
[5025.32 - 5028.40] when it comes down to autoimmune you
[5026.80 - 5030.92] want the solid
[5028.40 - 5033.32] Basics you want to pull out the heavy
[5030.92 - 5035.72] metals you want cilantro an herb in your
[5033.32 - 5037.72] diet you want the Frozen wild
[5035.72 - 5039.28] blueberries Frozen wild blueberries are
[5037.72 - 5040.88] a miracle on their own because they not
[5039.28 - 5042.24] only pull out heavy metals out of the
[5040.88 - 5045.72] brain and out of the liver and out of
[5042.24 - 5047.92] the body but Frozen wild blueberries the
[5045.72 - 5050.68] wild blueberries not the cultivated kind
[5047.92 - 5053.20] the wild blueberries have antiviral
[5050.68 - 5055.92] Inhibitors in them that means
[5053.20 - 5058.96] phytochemicals that don't kill a virus
[5055.92 - 5061.28] necessarily but stop it from functioning
[5058.96 - 5062.92] dumbing it down that's the power of the
[5061.28 - 5064.64] wild blueberry and you want want to dumb
[5062.92 - 5066.92] down the viral issues you want to dumb
[5064.64 - 5069.32] down what's behind all these different
[5066.92 - 5070.80] autoimmune conditions if you're someone
[5069.32 - 5072.84] today that
[5070.80 - 5074.84] says hey look you didn't cover my
[5072.84 - 5076.56] autoimmune condition you mixed missed

[5078.56 - 5083.52] you the foundation applies not only the
[5081.16 - 5085.20] foundation that applies but knowing the

[5099.96 - 5103.96] then say hey look this is the
[5101.52 - 5105.60] information I have now too combined with

[5105.60 - 5112.12] getting out there it's going to help
[5108.52 - 5114.60] it's going to change the game it's that
[5112.12 - 5117.92] important it's that
[5114.60 - 5121.08] critical so on on foods and different
[5117.92 - 5123.84] supplements herbs like rosemary thyme
[5121.08 - 5126.04] thyme tea is really good for any kind of
[5123.84 - 5128.52] autoimmune a little bit of time tea
[5126.04 - 5131.76] don't be afraid of that rose hips rose
[5128.52 - 5133.56] hip tea great for autoimmune as well we
[5131.76 - 5135.44] talked about the liposomas that's
[5133.56 - 5137.80] important if you can't you know get the
[5135.44 - 5139.72] liposomas we'll do the
[5137.80 - 5142.36] Esty but you can do a little bit of
[5139.72 - 5144.88] liposomas C to get a little bit in you
[5142.36 - 5146.52] every day vitamin C improves your immune
[5144.88 - 5148.84] system we know that and improves the
[5146.52 - 5152.32] white count we know that but here's what
[5148.84 - 5155.48] else it does vitamin C helps pull out
[5152.32 - 5157.64] out all the poison that the viruses in
[5155.48 - 5160.24] the pathogens and even bacteria are
[5157.64 - 5162.16] creating all that poison that's creating
[5160.24 - 5164.60] rashes and dermato toxins creating
[5162.16 - 5166.12] butterfly rashes creating problems all
[5164.60 - 5167.84] all in the body creating fatigue
[5166.12 - 5169.92] neurological fatigue from all that
[5167.84 - 5171.12] neurotoxin all that poison that's
[5169.92 - 5174.88] involved with
[5171.12 - 5177.56] autoimmune and vitamin C helps grab on
[5174.88 - 5179.92] to that and and Pull It extracted out of
[5177.56 - 5182.32] the body pulling that poison out of the
[5179.92 - 5184.08] body you guys and getting it out of your
[5182.32 - 5185.56] system so vitamin C is really important
[5184.08 - 5188.84] and vitamin c does one more thing
[5185.56 - 5192.52] somebody doesn't know about one more
[5188.84 - 5196.24] thing it's starves a virus it gets in
[5192.52 - 5198.52] the way of a virus feeding on what it
[5196.24 - 5199.92] wants so let's go back to Foods if
[5198.52 - 5201.52] you're plant-based and you're on all
[5199.92 - 5202.88] fruits and vegetables it's incredible
[5201.52 - 5205.24] from when when you're dealing with
[5202.88 - 5207.08] autoimmune it's incredible so if you're
[5205.24 - 5209.00] somebody that's plant-based and you're
[5207.08 - 5211.36] worried that you're you're not getting
[5209.00 - 5213.96] enough protein don't go that direction
[5211.36 - 5215.24] realize that being plant-based is really
[5213.96 - 5216.80] helpful for autoimmune now if you're
[5215.24 - 5218.40] somebody who's not plant-based and you
[5216.80 - 5219.84] have autoimmune and you're doing the
[5218.40 - 5222.12] animal products like I said keep away
[5219.84 - 5223.68] from dairy keep away from eggs keep your
[5222.12 - 5226.28] you know keep at the highest quality
[5223.68 - 5228.92] leanest uh protein you can find animal
[5226.28 - 5231.16] protein you can find you know make sure
[5228.92 - 5233.32] you do that and keep it down to a
[5231.16 - 5235.44] minimum don't have protein three times a
[5233.32 - 5237.00] day unless it's the only thing you got
[5235.44 - 5240.00] and and you feel it's the only thing you
[5237.00 - 5241.68] can eat but the point is is try not to
[5240.00 - 5244.92] do it three times a day cuz you need to
[5241.68 - 5246.76] make room for those wild blueberries you
[5244.92 - 5250.00] need to make room for the wild blueberry
[5246.76 - 5252.00] smoothie you need to make room for the
[5250.00 - 5253.60] other Foods you need to make room for
[5252.00 - 5256.24] the lettuces which are incredible for
[5253.60 - 5258.32] autoimmune red leaf lettuce butterleaf
[5256.24 - 5260.72] lettuce that's amazing for autoimmune
[5258.32 - 5265.04] that alone right there
[5260.72 - 5266.36] radishes dear Lord I think I I think I
[5265.04 - 5268.08] heard from somebody that there's
[5266.36 - 5270.12] something out there that radishes are
[5268.08 - 5271.52] bad for autoimmune or radishes or bad
[5270.12 - 5273.52] for thyroid or something like that I
[5271.52 - 5276.64] think it was bad for for thyroid that is
[5273.52 - 5279.52] absurd that is absolutely insane
[5276.64 - 5282.84] radishes are a miracle food the radish
[5279.52 - 5285.08] greens kill all viruses the radishes
[5282.84 - 5287.68] themselves push out poison out of the
[5285.08 - 5290.48] body the radishes themselves help heal
[5287.68 - 5292.48] thyroids all this is important so think
[5290.48 - 5295.64] about radishes make salads if you're
[5292.48 - 5298.32] into animal protein make room for salads
[5295.64 - 5300.16] too okay that's important get get your
[5298.32 - 5301.60] you know um and look I say this to
[5300.16 - 5303.00] vegans and vegetarians too there's
[5301.60 - 5305.44] vegans and vegetarians that eat bread
[5303.00 - 5306.64] and cheese all day well not vegans but
[5305.44 - 5307.76] there's vegetarians that eat bread and
[5306.64 - 5309.40] cheese all day I'm like where's your

[5340.04 - 5344.52] partially amazing for autoimmune amazing
[5342.64 - 5346.72] for knocking down viral loads get
[5344.52 - 5349.56] partially in there too that's really a
[5346.72 - 5351.04] great great great thing to do think
[5349.56 - 5352.20] about some different fruits to try if
[5351.04 - 5353.96] you're afraid of fruit and you have
[5352.20 - 5356.00] fruit fear and you're trapped in the
[5353.96 - 5358.16] fruit fear because of the misinformation
[5356.00 - 5360.20] that's out there try to incorporate more
[5358.16 - 5361.80] apples try to bring in the wild
[5360.20 - 5363.44] blueberries try to bring in a little bit
[5361.80 - 5365.00] of melon in the morning just a little
[5363.44 - 5367.44] bit don't eat a ton of it just eat a
[5365.00 - 5369.28] little bit try a little very important
[5367.44 - 5371.72] what does it do flushes out a lot of the
[5369.28 - 5376.48] poison that the viruses
[5371.72 - 5378.64] create fruit sugar does not feed viruses
[5376.48 - 5381.00] just letting you guys know that it does
[5378.64 - 5385.64] not feed viruses and bacteria fruit
[5381.00 - 5390.04] can't feed bacteria corn syrup can corn
[5385.64 - 5392.76] can okay eggs can Dairy can canola oil
[5390.04 - 5395.16] can pork can if you're into animal
[5392.76 - 5397.16] products I totally respect it and uh
[5395.16 - 5400.04] just make sure you have I'm not an
[5397.16 - 5403.12] anti-animal product um but just make
[5400.04 - 5404.64] sure that you have the salads going on
[5403.12 - 5407.16] and make sure you bring in some fruit
[5404.64 - 5409.04] somewhere in there just don't eat a big
[5407.16 - 5411.16] fruit pie right after you had a big
[5409.04 - 5414.48] steak that doesn't really work that way
[5411.16 - 5415.72] make sure your steak is you know try
[5414.48 - 5417.92] well you know it's like you're not
[5415.72 - 5419.80] supposed to put a chocolate cake after
[5417.92 - 5422.48] after a steak either okay you're not
[5419.80 - 5424.88] supposed to put too much after a steak
[5422.48 - 5427.84] um just when I tell people if they eat a
[5424.88 - 5430.20] big old they be eat big old steak for
[5427.84 - 5431.84] dinner they should just be sipping tea
[5430.20 - 5433.56] sipping tea for the rest of the night
[5431.84 - 5436.04] because you just you don't have a lot of
[5433.56 - 5438.28] room there's not a lot of room and with
[5436.04 - 5441.72] fruit it fruit has a lot of water
[5438.28 - 5443.36] content so you need more stomach space
[5441.72 - 5445.12] so you need more stomach space
[5443.36 - 5447.48] vegetables have water content so you
[5445.12 - 5449.72] need more stomach space I tell people
[5447.48 - 5451.88] keep your your proteins lean try to have
[5449.72 - 5453.80] 4 ounces and then this way you can have
[5451.88 - 5455.92] room for a salad if you have 12 ounces
[5453.80 - 5458.16] of animal protein it's there's not a lot
[5455.92 - 5459.60] of stomach space for a salad salad takes
[5458.16 - 5462.72] a lot of space is what I'm saying it's
[5459.60 - 5464.40] high water content where is the medicine
[5462.72 - 5466.72] the medicine whether you're animal
[5464.40 - 5468.64] protein or your non-an animal protein
[5466.72 - 5470.56] the medicine is in the fruits and the
[5468.64 - 5471.88] vegetables always remember that and the
[5470.56 - 5474.60] leafy
[5471.88 - 5476.16] greens um and that's how you combat
[5474.60 - 5477.72] autoimmune and what you'll see now is
[5476.16 - 5480.44] the experts they've changed their their
[5477.72 - 5481.56] Foods they've changed their food laws 10
[5480.44 - 5484.36] years ago you wouldn't believe what it
[5481.56 - 5486.16] was like now you know their food laws
[5484.36 - 5488.84] are they have these healthy avocados in
[5486.16 - 5490.72] there coconut oil they have salads
[5488.84 - 5492.28] whether they like animal proteins or not
[5490.72 - 5494.68] and they're getting people results but
[5492.28 - 5495.76] let me tell you something it's even
[5494.68 - 5498.40] though they're getting people some
[5495.76 - 5500.32] results this is the information you need
[5498.40 - 5503.96] this is the information you need to
[5500.32 - 5505.96] really conquer some serious problems to
[5503.96 - 5507.88] really conquer some serious autoimmune
[5505.96 - 5509.24] to understand it and what's going on and
[5507.88 - 5511.16] about the truth about your body not
[5509.24 - 5513.04] attacking itself because this takes it
[5511.16 - 5515.88] to a whole another level this is way
[5513.04 - 5518.40] more way more ahead of the curve this is
[5515.88 - 5521.48] way more ahead of the
[5518.40 - 5523.72] curve when you're driving you want to
[5521.48 - 5526.32] know what's in front of you you want to
[5523.72 - 5528.08] know what's around the corner you don't
[5526.32 - 5530.84] want to just be driving
[5528.08 - 5533.04] blind you don't you don't want to drive
[5530.84 - 5536.32] blind it's one thing you don't want to
[5533.04 - 5538.52] do and that's what this is about this is
[5536.32 - 5541.20] about being armed this is about being
[5538.52 - 5543.64] armed with truth with knowledge this is
[5541.20 - 5545.76] about having a shield this is about
[5543.64 - 5547.72] having information that's powerful this
[5545.76 - 5549.96] is about this is about knowing what's
[5547.72 - 5551.52] around the bend so you can actually
[5549.96 - 5553.00] what's around the bend so you can
[5551.52 - 5556.96] actually protect your family your
[5553.00 - 5561.48] children yourself so you're not driving
[5556.96 - 5564.04] blind so you can see so you can
[5561.48 - 5565.88] see and seeing is important when it
[5564.04 - 5567.20] comes down to healing and seeing what's
[5565.88 - 5569.20] going on behind
[5567.20 - 5570.68] autoimmune and seeing what's happened
[5569.20 - 5572.24] with it all make sure you get other
[5570.68 - 5574.36] berries into your diet too make sure you
[5572.24 - 5576.32] get the raspberries make sure you get
[5574.36 - 5578.60] the if if you only have conventional
[5576.32 - 5579.88] blueberries if you only have the big old
[5578.60 - 5581.56] I call them the big old silly
[5579.88 - 5583.32] blueberries they're not the little
[5581.56 - 5585.52] blueberry the powerful medicine
[5583.32 - 5587.64] medicinal blueberry from uh Maine the
[5585.52 - 5589.64] main wild blueberries the Canadian wild
[5587.64 - 5591.40] blueberries if you don't have those wild
[5589.64 - 5595.32] blueberries you can't find them in the
[5591.40 - 5598.16] Frozen Department get the uh cultivated
[5595.32 - 5599.88] blueberries fine fine fine they still
[5598.16 - 5601.88] have something to offer it's nothing
[5599.88 - 5603.16] like the uh wild blueberries but still
[5601.88 - 5605.04] they have something if it's all you got
[5603.16 - 5607.16] it's all you got get the
[5605.04 - 5609.52] raspberries get the raspberries get the
[5607.16 - 5611.72] blackberries blackberries regular
[5609.52 - 5613.80] blackberries just blackberries you buy
[5611.72 - 5615.76] in the pint size the little clamshell at
[5613.80 - 5618.08] the at the organic market they still
[5615.76 - 5621.36] have more power than
[5618.08 - 5623.12] clamshell regular cultivated blueberries
[5621.36 - 5624.60] they still so get the Blackberry over
[5623.12 - 5626.12] the blueberry but when it comes down to
[5624.60 - 5628.12] the wild blueberry that's a whole
[5626.12 - 5629.48] different game you get those frozen wild
[5628.12 - 5631.04] blueberries out of the freezer section
[5629.48 - 5632.28] that's medicine so you get the
[5631.04 - 5633.80] blackberries you get the strawberries
[5632.28 - 5635.40] are okay if you're into strawberries
[5633.80 - 5636.96] don't be afraid of citrus if you if you
[5635.40 - 5638.68] feel like you can eat citrus get some
[5636.96 - 5641.04] oranges and you it's incredible as an
[5638.68 - 5642.60] anti-a autoimmune antiviral food even
[5641.04 - 5644.80] though some even though it's shunned and
[5642.60 - 5646.32] banned out there there's a lot of foods
[5644.80 - 5648.16] that are shunned out there bananas are
[5646.32 - 5650.52] shunned out there now bananas are
[5648.16 - 5653.08] incredible for colitis incredible for
[5650.52 - 5654.96] for celiac incredible for multiple
[5653.08 - 5657.04] sclerosis incredible for Lupus

[5658.96 - 5663.12] incredible for hepatitis amazing for all
[5661.00 - 5665.16] the different hepatitis and liver
[5663.12 - 5667.20] problems and liver conditions elevated
[5665.16 - 5670.84] enzymes and liver everything going on
[5667.20 - 5672.96] with the liver bananas are important so
[5670.84 - 5674.36] bring those in they kill off bacteria in
[5672.96 - 5676.16] the intestinal tract if people are
[5674.36 - 5678.08] worried about sibo and intestinal tract
[5676.16 - 5680.64] bacteria and everything else kills off
[5678.08 - 5683.00] bacteria sweeps it out so don't be
[5680.64 - 5684.88] afraid of banana too so I'm giving you
[5683.00 - 5686.68] all the different things about foods
[5684.88 - 5690.12] that can give you a good foundation to
[5686.68 - 5692.08] what to do and it's really important
[5690.12 - 5695.08] careful about oils try not to to overdo
[5692.08 - 5697.68] oils try not to overdo olive oil try not
[5695.08 - 5699.80] to overdo coconut oil you don't want to
[5697.68 - 5701.96] have your food inundated with too much
[5699.80 - 5704.00] oil you got to be you know use it
[5701.96 - 5705.52] sparingly have some hem seeds have some
[5704.00 - 5707.60] pumpkin seeds have a little bit of
[5705.52 - 5710.52] coconut oil a little bit of olive oil if
[5707.60 - 5712.00] you want but be be light on it okay you
[5710.52 - 5714.32] know if you're into walnuts you can have
[5712.00 - 5716.56] some walnuts these are all good foods
[5714.32 - 5718.72] they don't feed the viruses that cause
[5716.56 - 5721.68] autoimmune you can have them in there
[5718.72 - 5724.24] but make sure you got the leafy greens
[5721.68 - 5727.36] make sure that they're in there in your
[5724.24 - 5729.92] diet dandelion greens really great for
[5727.36 - 5731.56] autoimmune they help with the liver they
[5729.92 - 5733.68] push out poisons that create all the
[5731.56 - 5734.52] different autoimmune symptoms so Danny
[5733.68 - 5738.12] lion
[5734.52 - 5740.20] greens I still call it autoimmune in a
[5738.12 - 5741.92] sense of saying autoimmune you guys know
[5740.20 - 5743.84] the truth about it right now you
[5741.92 - 5745.84] understand right now what's going on I
[5743.84 - 5748.28] mean I still use the term because
[5745.84 - 5752.40] everybody knows it by that
[5748.28 - 5754.60] term but really you know it should be
[5752.40 - 5757.32] called called something else it should
[5754.60 - 5759.60] be called virus immune not autoimmune it
[5757.32 - 5761.72] should be called virus immune I talk
[5759.60 - 5763.48] about that in the thyroid healing book
[5761.72 - 5766.28] you guys I promise you this book isn't
[5763.48 - 5767.88] just like a concept and a couple hundred
[5766.28 - 5769.68] pages and you read it and you put it
[5767.88 - 5773.32] down and that's it that's not what this
[5769.68 - 5777.20] is this is packed jam-packed with so
[5773.32 - 5779.12] much truth I talk about the th if you
[5777.20 - 5781.60] don't have a thyroid anymore you can
[5779.12 - 5782.80] still heal they can still heal if you
[5781.60 - 5784.16] don't have a thyroid anymore I talk
[5782.80 - 5786.24] about if your thyroids been killed off
[5784.16 - 5788.76] radioactive the Isotopes radioactive
[5786.24 - 5790.96] iodine or if your vir if you had your
[5788.76 - 5793.92] thyroid removed that there's still
[5790.96 - 5795.52] tissue left in your that's left because
[5793.92 - 5797.16] they can't remove all your thyroid and
[5795.52 - 5799.08] it's still working for you and I talk
[5797.16 - 5800.40] about the Undiscovered hormones science
[5799.08 - 5802.60] of research has discovered that the
[5800.40 - 5804.56] thyroid produces that's only in thyroid
[5802.60 - 5806.80] healing and those undiscovered hormones
[5804.56 - 5808.24] are in what's left over in tissue if you
[5806.80 - 5809.72] had your thyroid removed and still
[5808.24 - 5812.00] communicate with the
[5809.72 - 5814.36] body so you can still still heal even
[5812.00 - 5816.04] when you're missing a thyroid even when
[5814.36 - 5819.08] you're missing half your thyroid or your
[5816.04 - 5821.28] thyroid was removed you can still heal
[5819.08 - 5823.04] and here's the thing all in all it's the
[5821.28 - 5824.36] virus that caused the thyroid problem to
[5823.04 - 5826.84] begin with and that's what's giving you
[5824.36 - 5829.28] your symptoms anyway so we go after the
[5826.84 - 5830.92] upstein bar that caused your virus to
[5829.28 - 5832.96] have a that caused your thyroid to have
[5830.92 - 5835.08] a problem for it to be removed so you
[5832.96 - 5837.28] can still heal I can't tell you how many
[5835.08 - 5839.16] people over the years that were missing
[5837.28 - 5840.48] a thyroid that had all their symptoms
[5839.16 - 5841.64] and the doctor be like well because
[5840.48 - 5843.28] you're missing a thyro thyroid you're
[5841.64 - 5845.00] still going to have all these symptoms
[5843.28 - 5847.80] we got rid of all the symptoms as if
[5845.00 - 5850.64] they didn't even have a thyroid problem
[5847.80 - 5853.04] anymore because it was something else
[5850.64 - 5854.32] something else that nobody knows and
[5853.04 - 5855.72] that's what this is all about with
[5854.32 - 5857.32] autoimmune it's like that with all
[5855.72 - 5860.44] autoimmune it's something else in there
[5857.32 - 5863.04] that nobody knows about in research and
[5860.44 - 5866.24] science so if you're missing your
[5863.04 - 5869.08] thyroid you still have a way to heal and
[5866.24 - 5871.76] all these foods and supplements matter
[5869.08 - 5875.92] when it comes down to that
[5871.76 - 5878.64] um MSM a high quality MSM um that's also
[5875.92 - 5881.88] really important so high quality MSM
[5878.64 - 5883.88] that's important for um um for any kind
[5881.88 - 5885.84] of autoimmune a little bit of that is a
[5883.88 - 5887.36] good thing silica that's an important
[5885.84 - 5889.32] supplement for any kind of autoimmune
[5887.36 - 5890.56] that people are going through silica is
[5889.32 - 5893.60] really
[5890.56 - 5896.64] important that's a great one so always
[5893.60 - 5899.52] you know consider that licorice licorice
[5896.64 - 5902.16] is very anti- epscene bar very
[5899.52 - 5907.04] antiviral excuse me licorice can really
[5902.16 - 5908.56] help knock out and kill off um viruses
[5907.04 - 5910.72] so licorice can actually really knock
[5908.56 - 5913.80] off and kill off viruses it's
[5910.72 - 5916.20] really uh you know an
[5913.80 - 5917.72] antiviral in one of the greatest senses
[5916.20 - 5920.12] so you know you can try some licorice
[5917.72 - 5922.08] too it's fantastic for so many different
[5920.12 - 5925.48] varieties of of
[5922.08 - 5929.16] autoimmune lysine lysine a basic
[5925.48 - 5930.88] Foundation a foundational amino acid
[5929.16 - 5934.96] which hinders and stops the herpetic
[5930.88 - 5937.32] family family viruses Len alone I've
[5934.96 - 5938.76] seen get rid of so many different
[5937.32 - 5941.32] symptoms and people that are dealing
[5938.76 - 5942.88] with mystery autoimmune with different
[5941.32 - 5946.16] labels and everything else attached to
[5942.88 - 5948.40] it so elene is another thing to consider
[5946.16 - 5950.00] too along the way you can take a little
[5948.40 - 5952.04] bit of it even if you took some vitamin
[5950.00 - 5954.60] C consistently every day a decent amount
[5952.04 - 5955.84] of it if you wanted to lysine a decent
[5954.60 - 5957.40] amount of it you can up your dosage you
[5955.84 - 5959.44] can talk to your doctor you can up it
[5957.40 - 5961.76] very
[5959.44 - 5963.96] high lysine
[5961.76 - 5965.48] and you got the vitamin C you got a
[5963.96 - 5966.92] little bit of licorice you got a little
[5965.48 - 5968.92] bit of
[5966.92 - 5971.56] zinc and some of the other things we
[5968.92 - 5973.88] talked about and the methyl cabalin
[5971.56 - 5975.16] dinos cobalamin B12 we talked about and
[5973.88 - 5977.76] you have some of the different things
[5975.16 - 5979.44] you're already building your foundation
[5977.76 - 5982.12] powerful
[5979.44 - 5985.04] Foundation to turning the tide you're
[5982.12 - 5986.52] attaching that powerful Foundation along
[5985.04 - 5988.68] with the truth about what you now know
[5986.52 - 5990.72] about autoimmune and what your body's
[5988.68 - 5992.28] really doing for you and how it stands
[5990.72 - 5996.44] behind you and it's not trying to harm
[5992.28 - 5996.44] you or hurt you and it's there for you
[5996.80 - 6004.44] 100% And that's the power of how it
[6001.16 - 6006.76] works so other Foods zucchini is really
[6004.44 - 6009.44] good summer squash is really good very
[6006.76 - 6011.16] good for autoimmune keep those in there
[6009.44 - 6013.80] you know like incorporate these wherever
[6011.16 - 6015.80] you can steam cooked vegetables are fine
[6013.80 - 6017.48] that's good too you don't have to be raw
[6015.80 - 6020.72] steam cooked vegetables are good if you
[6017.48 - 6023.48] really like those that can work if you
[6020.72 - 6026.72] are are afraid of grains because the
[6023.48 - 6029.64] world's anti-rain right now but you want
[6026.72 - 6034.40] grains or you still eat grains keep it
[6029.64 - 6037.52] to Millet and quinoa Millet and quinoa
[6034.40 - 6039.40] those are the two that are the least
[6037.52 - 6041.24] antagonistic see what happens is that
[6039.40 - 6044.64] all grains have been lumped together as
[6041.24 - 6046.08] being Sinister because what alternate
[6044.64 - 6049.36] practitioners are discovering is that
[6046.08 - 6051.40] the gluten is is is is uh worsening
[6049.36 - 6053.80] symptoms in people so so they find that
[6051.40 - 6055.76] gluten is worsening symptoms in people
[6053.80 - 6057.12] so they think gluten is the responsible
[6055.76 - 6059.64] they don't realize that gluten is
[6057.12 - 6060.88] feeding a virus or a pathogen that's
[6059.64 - 6062.68] causing the person to have their
[6060.88 - 6065.80] symptoms conditions their rashes there
[6062.68 - 6067.64] whatever is going on so then they deem
[6065.80 - 6070.44] all grains
[6067.64 - 6073.84] Sinister so it's an anti-rain
[6070.44 - 6076.88] world now I don't like a lot of grains
[6073.84 - 6078.96] what I'm saying is if your symptoms you
[6076.88 - 6080.52] know if you're not severely autoimmune
[6078.96 - 6082.12] symptom you know symptomatic where
[6080.52 - 6084.88] you're getting so you're so viral you're
[6082.12 - 6086.60] not so viral immune that's what I'd
[6084.88 - 6090.08] rather call it really you guys is viral
[6086.60 - 6092.72] immune you're not so viral immune then
[6090.08 - 6094.60] you can do probably quinoa you can do
[6092.72 - 6096.56] probably a really good steel cut oat
[6094.60 - 6100.12] maybe you could Pro meaning if if you
[6096.56 - 6103.08] like that you can do um some
[6100.12 - 6104.32] Millet as a possibility and you can try
[6103.08 - 6106.36] those incorporate those if you really
[6104.32 - 6108.24] want have those with vegetables and so
[6106.36 - 6110.36] forth and that could be okay you can
[6108.24 - 6112.32] also get away with some black beans you
[6110.36 - 6115.80] can also get get away with some lentils
[6112.32 - 6118.16] so lentils and black beans so those two
[6115.80 - 6119.76] are good things too so whether you eat
[6118.16 - 6121.16] animal protein or you don't eat animal
[6119.76 - 6124.20] protein whatever you know whether you're
[6121.16 - 6126.40] vegan vegetarian or you eat you know uh
[6124.20 - 6129.72] animal protein you can incorporate these
[6126.40 - 6131.32] in if you're really viral IM immune you
[6129.72 - 6132.84] know you don't have to bring these in
[6131.32 - 6135.16] you bring in more fruits and vegetables
[6132.84 - 6138.44] and be better but these are still a
[6135.16 - 6141.44] possibility for you so listen just know
