1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
talking about natural flavors

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:07,440
how toxic natural flavors are even

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,400
dangerous

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,360
natural flavors are and how everybody's

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,799
tricked

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,320
duped fooled about natural flavoring

7
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,720
so we're going to cover that that's an

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,199
important topic because guess what

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,920

12
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,160
most eaten food group is natural

13
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,239
flavoring that's right

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,840
so um we got that to cover and we'll

15
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:36,880

if you want to um so anyway let's go

39
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,280
good to see everybody coming on so the

40
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,640
banana salad by the way

41
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,840
is a way to get leafy greens in you

42
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:28,320
healthy nutritious life

43
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,000
saving leafy greens because leafy greens

44
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,400
are antiviral

45
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,040
antibacterial foods they have properties

46
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,320
in them that

47
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:40,000
actually inhibit viruses

48
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,280
inhibit bacteria and banana does too

49
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,880
so when you think about it you got

50
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,479
banana and you got a salad and you got

51
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,119
your banana salad what you're doing for

52
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,119
yourself

53
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,399
is really important and there's no fats

54
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,560
in this recipe because i know

55
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,560
most everybody they're inundated with

56
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,880
fats in their diet so i'd like to get a

57
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,439
recipe in your diet once in a while that

58
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,360
doesn't

59
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,640
have all the fats and isn't packed with

60
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,640
all the fats

61
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,159
and talk about why that's not good

62
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,200
either to have all the fats

63
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,880
so um talk about the banana salad start

64
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,039
making it

65
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,800
let's see i got some teas here i'm going

66
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:13,520
to talk about a little bit too

67
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,319
josh is it okay to put a clean protein

68
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,000
powder in the detox smoothie

69
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,840
would alter the effectiveness of the

70
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,840
smoothie josh

71
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,840
99.99

72
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,160
of protein powders have natural

73
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,640
flavoring in it if you see

74
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,680
berry flavor that's a natural flavor and

75
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,280
i'm going to talk about what natural

76
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,800
flavoring really is

77
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,760
if you see natural flavoring natural

78
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,200
flavor

79
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:43,680
organic flavor flavoring on its own

80
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,959
whatever the term if you see the word

81
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,120
flavor

82
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,000
flavor you're in trouble so i'm just

83
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,480
letting you know if that's in the

84
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,680
ingredient list and so you be careful

85
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,280
because you can be dumping a protein

86
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,840
powder that's got natural flavorings in

87
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,200
it

88
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,920
and what does that have msg

89
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,319
is msg bad dangerous we're going to talk

90
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,680
about what it does to the brain what msg

91
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,319
does to the mind

92
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,360
why natural flavoring should not be in

93
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,840
supplements

94
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,560
you know for example the vimergy

95
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,640
supplements

96
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,480
never had and never will have natural

97
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,879
flavoring

98
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,560
i noticed that traditional medicinal

99
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,000
teas that's a tea i drink and not

100
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,840
sponsored by these guys

101
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,519
doesn't have natural flavoring in it but

102
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,959
most teas do now

103
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,879
natural flavors of all different kinds

104
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,319
whether it's raspberry flavor

105
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:33,599
some other kind of flavor dr fans on md

106
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:36,640
great doctor glad you're here um

107
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,280
so giselle says what if you can't eat

108
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,560
carbs

109
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,799
well you're getting sugar somewhere so

110
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,560
if you give you you you must be getting

111
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,200
sugar somewhere so

112
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,959
certainly you're not carb free because

113
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,840
say you're on a carnivore diet

114
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,400
and you're doing all meat the meat has

115
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,720
sugar

116
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,439
in the blood and packed with sugar

117
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,799
because

118
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:01,200
the cow's blood sugar is really high

119
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,879
so all that blood sugar is in all that

120
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,640
blood is in the meat so that when you're

121
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,879
broiling the meat

122
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,120
you know cooking baking frying whatever

123
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:11,519
it is you do with meat

124
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,239
you're actually caramelizing the blood

125
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,200
sugar

126
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,880
is what's going on and that's why people

127
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,639
can survive on eating meat

128
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,799
because there's so much sugar in it and

129
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,400
that's why it's almost sweet i've hear

130
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,080
heard that over and over again i like a

131
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,960
good steak people say

132
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,000
it's just it's just it's sweet and zesty

133
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,400
it's just got some kind

134
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,840
of meaty sweet flavor yeah it doesn't

135
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,680
taste like apple pie

136
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,280
but they don't measure the blood sugar

137
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,720
and meat they keep that part out

138
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,479
so they'll tell you there's no carbs in

139
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,080
your meat so you're getting carbs so

140
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:43,520
you're actually doing carbs

141
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,960
so so it's like you just is it you don't

142
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,600
want to do a different carb you don't

143
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,440
want to do an

144
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,280
uh another carb or a healthier carb

145
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,680
that's all that is

146
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,320
but if you don't want to do the banana

147
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,840
and

148
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,120
you don't want to do anything like that

149
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,680
we can figure something out and have a

150
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,720
salad

151
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,360
maybe tomatoes lunell said i had a b12

152
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,199
supplement with natural flavorings

153
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,520
before getting the vimergy one

154
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,759
loon thanks for reminding me because

155
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,639
that's exactly it the vimergy

156
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,759
b12 doesn't have natural flavoring but

157
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,840
there's a

158
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,440
20 other reasons why the b12 for vimergy

159
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,039
is better than anybody out there but

160
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,759
there yeah there's no natural flavoring

161
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,360
and everybody had natural flavorings in

162
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,000
their b12s

163
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,440
and the couple of companies that might

164
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,240
be out there without natural flavorings

165
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,160
in their b12

166
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,000
their copycats off vimergy because

167
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,440
everybody had natural flavorings they

168
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,360
had msg in their b12

169
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,919
so that's what's happening so hey let me

170
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,520
go take my b12 and get poisoned by msg

171
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,360
that's what it is oh i got a migraine

172
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,320
now i feel sick oh my god i just got a

173
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,160
dizzy spell

174
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,800
because of that msg those natural

175
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,880
flavors that are in everybody else's b12

176
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,639
and that's why it was critical that you

177
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,160
you shouldn't have that in a supplement

178
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,840
that's why i trust the vimergy

179
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:57,520
but i got to go into what msg does

180
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,600
how it works and when what they say

181
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,000
about natural flavors out there to trick

182
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,360
you

183
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,840
you guys just got on here making a

184
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,039

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:19,919

that's one i can trust and um the

194
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:29,120
dinosaur kovaleman methylcobalamin

195
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:32,840
so let's talk about it if there is

196
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:35,120
natural flavoring in a supplement out

197
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:39,039
there and the supplement

198
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:41,120
company is trying to defend it

199
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,319
you got a major problem you got a

200
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,880
supplement company

201
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,000
you can't trust because that supplement

202
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,960
company

203
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,919
doesn't even know or they do know and

204
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,479
they're not going to say it

205
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,759
or they don't know that there's msg in

206
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,400
that natural flavoring

207
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,479
now a company will say this there's no

208
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,840
natural there's no msg in our natural

209
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:03,919
flavors we talked to the manufacturing

210
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:06,880
plant of those natural flavors

211
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:08,720
you know we talked to the manufacturer

212
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,039
of natural flavors and they said there's

213
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,639
no msg in there so the msg is all

214
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,919
organic and pure and it goes in our

215
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,319
supplement

216
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,120
but that's not the truth not the truth

217
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,479
at all

218
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:23,599
see years ago before natural flavoring

219
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,960
was developed there were artificial

220
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,759
flavoring

221
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,520
artificial flavoring but when artificial

222
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,960
flavoring was out there

223
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:36,639
artificial flavoring didn't have msg

224
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:38,639
in it okay so it had chemicals

225
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,479
like different kinds of chemicals in it

226
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,479
that's what artificial flavoring had

227
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,479
right and sometimes now artificial

228
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:47,039
flavoring will have msg

229
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,080
but in the past years ago it didn't

230
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,080
here's what happened

231
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,000
get ready here's where you guys all been

232
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,240
suckered all been tricked

233
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,039
all been duped the wolves been pulled

234
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,440
over your eyes

235
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,440
right here i'm gonna drop it on you okay

236
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:04,240
a deal was made

237
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:08,400
okay that msg can hide now

238
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,440
behind a veil the veil was natural

239
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,759
flavoring

240
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,759
that was a deal that was made in the

241
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,319
food and drug world

242
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,240
so here's how it goes everybody was

243
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,240
figuring out msg was toxic

244
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,520
everybody was figuring out msg was

245
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,199
dangerous

246
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:29,039
too many people got sick disturbed

247
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:31,680
hurt by it okay and so msg

248
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:33,440
would have to be labeled in the past so

249
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,080
everybody's products on the store

250
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,680
shelves

251
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:40,240

shelves

254
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,279
and then all of a sudden it disappeared

255
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,480
gone

256
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:51,040
right when natural flavors was birthed

257
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,160
all of a sudden msg's not on any

258
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,640

dollars

296
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:09,040

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,800
traditional medicinals no so anyway the

301
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,440
bottom line is

302
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,680
when they did that switch over all these

303
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,720
other products msg disappeared

304
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,920
but it showed up as natural flavoring

305
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,480
without the word

306
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,279
so what they did was natural flavors

307
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,600
flavoring

308
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,959
raspberry flavor strawberry flavor any

309
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,279
kind of flavor

310
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,480
not vanilla extract don't get that

311
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,680
confused

312
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:43,200
extract is different than flavors

313
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,560
flavorings or flavor so our flavors

314
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,760
flavoring flavor okay

315
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:50,800
so natural so extract

316
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:54,240
is different so vanilla extract

317
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:57,279
is different than vanilla flavoring

318
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,399
really important to know all right so

319
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,680
so when you're going through all your

320
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,600
products you'll see natural flavors

321
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,160
everywhere you go go in yourselves

322
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,720

323
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,959

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,480
go through every single product on your

325
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,480
shelves tonight

326
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,519

and read every single label and you're

331
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,600
going to be

332
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,200
somewhere swimming in msg which is

333
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,920
natural flavor somewhere natural

334
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,320
flavoring

335
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,040
and any product company that defends

336
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,120
themselves

337
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,399
a supplement company says no our stuff

338
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,880
is pure

339
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,720
um we talk to the manufacturing of that

340
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,079
natural flavor and it is fine

341
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,399
they don't have to disclose it the

342
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:41,760
manufacturers

343
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,320
of natural flavorings are not there they

344
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,279
don't

345
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,480
have to disclose the msg anymore it they

346
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,959
got a free ride

347
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,519
when the deal was made to hide msg

348
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,639
because

349
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,519
think about it thousands and thousands

350
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,800
and thousands

351
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,839
hundreds of thousands millions of

352
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,440
products years ago all had to put msg on

353
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,360
the bottle okay

354
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,200
and then it disappeared so you're

355
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:07,040
telling me the msg

356
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:10,079
plant factories manufacturing facilities

357
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,760
all stopped when they didn't have to

358
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,279
you mean to tell me they just dropped

359
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,959
hundreds of millions of dollars

360
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,399
and just got rid of it and closed all

361
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:19,519
their factories down

362
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,959
for no reason no they kept it running

363
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,360
but they were allowed to get the free

364
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:26,959
ride and not have msg on the label

365
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,639
see how it works but it was switched

366
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:31,440
into natural flavoring

367
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,160
and it's in every food almost every

368
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,959
single

369
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,639
bottle can different foods all the

370
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,240
different packaged foods

371
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,639
go through all your stuff go through

372
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,680
anything you eat you're gonna find it

373
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:47,120
and that right there is a way to get msg

374
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,079
in your brain and that's when you become

375
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,320
brain damaged

376
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:52,720
in a different way msg builds up in

377
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,399
pockets inside the brain causes damage

378
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,320
to the neurotransmitters electrical

379
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,600
impulses to the neurons

380
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:02,720
msg is a neuroantagonist

381
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:06,160
it does damage to brain tissue

382
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:08,320
and you guys all become suckered into it

383
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,959
not your fault at all on any level but

384
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,440
when what really really gets my goat

385
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,600
right

386
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,040
because i'm about protecting you guys

387
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,480
i'm about looking out for you guys what

388
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,279
really gets me

389
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,200
is supplement companies that get

390
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,880
question on the msg on the natural

391
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,560
flavors they get questioned by people

392
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,680
like you guys who have learned because

393
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:29,440
when medical medium

394
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,079
the first edition of this book came out

395
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,760
right i talked about natural flavoring

396
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,079
in here and it being msg

397
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,200
and so that started a movement so people

398
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:40,079
can look out

399
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,040
but for supplement companies that have

400
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,600
followed

401
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,720
medical medium or i've spoken to over

402
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,680
the years

403
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,880
ignore the warning that natural flavors

404
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,959
is msg

405
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,160
and they purposely put it in all their

406
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:55,920
products and then

407
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:59,040
tell all their mm fans followers

408
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:01,360
users they tell them their natural

409
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,279
flavors comes from a company that isn't

410
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,800
msg which is not possible

411
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:10,000
they're all msg and then tells them that

412
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,560
is negligence and i know i see it all

413
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,360
out there

414
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,800
all over the place and it's like you

415
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,040
know what

416
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,800
you knew about it in here all the

417
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,160
companies knew about it in here all the

418
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,639
supplement companies all read the

419
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,480
medical medium books especially this one

420
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,760
and i've talked to all the supplement

421
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,680
companies out there

422
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,760
and they knew about the natural flavors

423
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,079
so to still have them in their products

424
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,199
is

425
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:34,880
just it's just disgusting really so

426
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,839
back to protecting you guys because

427
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,360
that's what it's about let's start

428
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,240
making a banana salad i'll talk a little

429
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,880
bit more about this

430
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:45,120
i got some romaine here i don't know if

431
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:48,880

so i got it i'm going to chop it up

434
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:58,079
msg cedaria says msg was created for

435
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:00,720
pharmaceutical companies

436
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:03,600
very interesting very interesting the

437
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,199
msg factories

438
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,199
didn't just throw their hands in the air

439
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,639
and give up so i'm chopping up this

440
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,560
romaine it's going to go

441
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,639
i'm not going to leave it in really big

442
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,760
pieces i'm chopping the salad a little

443
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,040
bit

444
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,000
okay guys the msg companies didn't just

445
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,160
give up

446
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,519
and they were done the day natural

447
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,320
flavors arrived

448
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,160
and every single bottle stopped saying

449
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,399
msg on it

450
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,199
they actually morphed it into natural

451
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,800
flavors

452
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:37,279
organic flavors yep

453
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:40,399
organic flavoring look

454
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:42,160
why should i care why should i care why

455
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:45,199
should i like

456
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,959
work this hard to like let you guys know

457
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,480
because i'm thinking about that baby

458
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,320
somewhere

459
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,639
and i'm thinking about that two-year-old

460
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,880
somewhere that doesn't need natural

461
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,279
flavoring msg

462
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,800
and the little two-year-old's brain

463
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:01,759
which is going to then support

464
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,680
adhd support problems with toxic heavy

465
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,759
metals make problems with toxic heavy

466
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,440
metals worse

467
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,199
i'm thinking about that child that's

468
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,199
five year old five years old

469
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:13,440
and the mom thinks that that organic

470
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:16,480
natural flavoring is perfectly healthy

471
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,639
and doesn't know i'm thinking about that

472
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,079
little one that's taking supplements

473
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,120
because mom wants a little one to take

474
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,720
supplements

475
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,120
and it's a crappy supplement because

476
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:28,240
it's got msg in it

477
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,560
and no one's telling that mom like you

478
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,839
know

479
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,839
what do i do stay quiet

480
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,120
and i get crap for all this stuff but

481
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,720
i mean i don't get it am i supposed to

482
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,040
just kick back and be like you know what

483
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,839
let

484
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,480
everybody just do their thing everybody

485
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,079
just

486
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,680
you know let them do their thing that's

487
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:48,000
their business well is it

488
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,519
or is it the business of a two-year-old

489
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,880
a five-year-old a mommy

490
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,800
you know and the whole bit so that's

491
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,600
important to know you guys

492
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,759
i just put some romaine in here so i got

493
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:01,360
that it's really beautiful that

494
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:04,319
romaine lettuce is a leafy green but

495
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,039
it's not as powerful it's powerful in a

496
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,360
different way

497
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,720
lettuces got their own source of

498
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,559
nutrient power okay

499
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,240
photochemical compounds and alkaloids

500
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,480
and stuff but

501
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,160
um but you know i love other leafy

502
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,240
greens so like using herbs as leafy

503
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,160
greens like cilantro it's medical medium

504
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,439
information no one's used cilantro like

505
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,199
leafy green

506
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,880
and i say this because i've taught so

507
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,959
many people now to use it as a leafy

508
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,400
green where you got all this cilantro so

509
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,240
i tell people the same thing you do

510
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,799
romaine lettuce do a

511
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,840
cilantro salad with that much let's try

512
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:37,440
that one day

513
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:39,520
bananas on that kimberly miller says

514
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,600
your info healed my alcoholism

515
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,960
incredible it really is

516
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,000
um and i'm really proud of you seriously

517
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,320
that is not easy

518
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,240
that is not easy to break i'm really

519
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:53,520
proud of you on that one

520
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,559
i'm gonna chop up some cucumber some

521
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,720
slices

522
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,760
okay i'm gonna peel back the cucumber a

523
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:02,640
little bit you guys

524
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:06,480
it's cutting off the ends right here so

525
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:08,240
look i don't want companies out there

526
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,559
having problems i want them to live

527
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:13,679
their life and sell their stuff

528
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,559
but i want them to fix what they know is

529
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,600
wrong

530
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:19,840
or if they don't know what's wrong i

531
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:23,280
want them to fix it anyway

532
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:24,720
right because in the end it's just going

533
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,520
to hurt everybody

534
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,360
it's people that get all kinds of

535
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:32,640
neurological symptoms

536
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:35,440
from msg because msg

537
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,880
um really kind of makes things worse if

538
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,799
you're viral if you've got low grade

539
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,320
viral infections like ebv

540
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,240
if you got toxic heavy metals and you're

541
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:45,440
dealing with anxiety and depression

542
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:47,520
natural flavoring can really add into

543
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:51,200
that depression that anxiety

544
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:53,840
it's kind of like another cut

545
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,520
death by a thousand cuts all these

546
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,200
different cuts

547
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,640
can you eat the skin on all cucumbers

548
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,679
yes you can i

549
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:04,240
conventional cucumbers um i would

550
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:06,160
probably peel them back a little bit

551
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,240
but all cucumbers in general organic

552
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,200
ones you can i would still wash the

553
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,320
cucumber

554
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,200
like i washed this is what i did i leave

555
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,840
the skin on

556
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,960
most dishes i kind of do this because it

557
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,520
gives it a look

558
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,320
too there's a look i was going for by

559
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,760
having like

560
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:25,840
taking the skin back a little bit you

561
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:28,160
see i was going for this kind of look um

562
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,679
but yeah you can keep the skin on them

563
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,480
just that if they're conventional i

564
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,880
wouldn't

565
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,120
on cucumbers i'd probably peel them back

566
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,840
at least a little bit

567
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,600
so i'm going to peel this one back now

568
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:42,640
too

569
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,960
that's what i'm doing probably only need

570
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,880
one

571
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,480
this is a really big cucumber right here

572
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,000
so i'm probably gonna only need one here

573
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:52,880
so that's what i'll do i'll use this one

574
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:56,240
that i'm cutting now

575
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,039
so all these things matter the details

576
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,240
matter when

577
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:03,120
you're getting better every single

578
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,720
break you can get in your body can get

579
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,799
is a big deal

580
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,559
so people say well why do you support

581
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,919
traditional medicinals so much there's

582
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,480
there's hundreds of tea companies out

583
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,320
there now

584
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,679
it's because i can't trust them they got

585
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,520
a track record of not putting natural

586
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,120
flavors in all these years

587
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,280
unless they change that track record but

588
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,240
they haven't so that's the natalie tea

589
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,919
right

590
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:26,000
traditional medicinals and so it's it's

591
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,520
it's like why i don't want to jump to

592
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,880
another tea company unless they can

593
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,840
really promise me

594
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,480
or show me a track record because teas

595
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,600
are all

596
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:37,200
getting natural flavors now natural

597
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,280
flavorings of different kinds

598
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,559
you go to a restaurant hey can i have a

599
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,840
chamomile tea

600
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:44,400
it's going to have natural flavoring in

601
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,159
it you go can i have peppermint tea

602
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,440
you just had a nice dinner you're with a

603
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,360
friend and

604
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,039
you want some herbal tea even though

605
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,640
everybody's like have matcha tea

606
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,559
afterwards so they get jacked up on

607
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,600
caffeine and their adrenals are like

608
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:59,679
oh my god help right but you can order

609
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,559
some say or order some herbal tea

610
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,880
it's gonna have natural flavoring in it

611
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,720
so

612
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,720
traditional medicinals doesn't that's

613
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,880
why i like that one the vimergy products

614
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,320
don't and never did and that's one

615
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,280
reason why i like them it's one out of

616
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,480
many

617
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,480
so it's important

618
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:20,320
b12 is infamous for having natural

619
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:23,039
flavoring of some kind in there

620
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,360
truly is so i'm gonna cut this right

621
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,919
here

622
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,600
so the first of all i'm gonna cut the

623
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,720
cucumber in half

624
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,280
like that okay and then i'm going to cut

625
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,440
these like

626
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,600
half moons is going to do and i'm not

627
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,840
going to cut them too big but yet

628
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,799
just about the right size here a little

629
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:43,200
a little bit more than a quarter inch

630
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:46,080
by almost a half inch each one that's

631
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,080
what i'm doing right here

632
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,880
you guys there's something that's really

633
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,000
important with cutting boards just

634
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,440
letting you know no matter what kind of

635
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,240
cutting board you use

636
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,440
this is a real i use wooden ones right

637
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,440
but

638
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,600
this is this is not the wooden one you

639
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,840
can see right it's the plastic

640
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,799
and the reason why i do that is because

641
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,880
i have it arched

642
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:06,320
out it's halfway off the counter and if

643
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,120
i use the wooden one it would just fall

644
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,720
down in

645
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,240
i use it because it's part of the studio

646
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,000
i set up in here right so i'm putting

647
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:15,280
these cucumber slices

648
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,240
on top of the salad i see people when

649
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,159
they're cutting

650
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,760
what they do is they scrape their boards

651
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:22,799
with the sharp part of their knife

652
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:25,039
so after they they cut something they

653
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,559
they scrape their board whether it's

654
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,039
wood or something you don't want to do

655
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,520
that

656
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:31,039
all you're doing is scraping tiny fibers

657
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,679
of wood off your board

658
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,480
tiny fibers of plastic tiny fibers of

659
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,600
glass

660
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,280
so you don't want to do that with your

661
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,200
knife you want to flip your knife around

662
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,600
and use this side which is not the sharp

663
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,919
side

664
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,120
to actually do this on your board i see

665
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,840
it all the time and i want to let you

666
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,840
guys know too

667
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,000
uh b senior says is that way some

668
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,400
so-called herbal teas

669
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,400
made me feel sick it's very possible

670
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:00,240
it's very possible

671
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:02,159
because there's there there's also a lot

672
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:06,159
of heavy metals and herbs

673
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:08,880
out there a lot a lot of heavy metals

674
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,679
and herbs letting you guys know that's

675
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,400
one thing

676
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,200
that slips the the radar not every

677
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,640
company

678
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,400
there's very few companies that do

679
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,559
independent testing very

680
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,240
it's very few if any and what i like

681
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,159
about vimergy to do independent testing

682
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:26,559
but herbs out there

683
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,559
they're notorious um

684
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:33,200
chinese medicine chinese herbs highest

685
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:36,320
in heavy metals

686
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:39,679
um there's just it always oh

687
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:42,240
always had heavy metals known for it

688
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:46,320
known for it for decades known for it in

689
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,320
the 90s known for in the 2000s

690
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,960
you want the lowest metals that's what

691
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,799
it is the lowest metals because there's

692
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,400
metals in every single thing you eat

693
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,799
every herb you take there's the metals

694
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,159
and it

695
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:00,960
falls out of the sky it's in the water

696
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:04,000
that feeds everything but

697
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,960
um and natural flavorings have metals

698
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,640
in there they have more than just msg so

699
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,360
natural flavoring isn't just

700
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,640
monosodium glutamate it's not just that

701
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:16,000
it's

702
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:18,799
it's msg is also a

703
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,760
like a combination some toxic heavy

704
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,240
metals

705
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,440
aluminum that's a big one in natural

706
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,279
flavors

707
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,799
so when you have a package and it says

708
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:28,720
organic natural flavors boom you just

709
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:31,440
got a heavy metal dose

710
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,559
boom you just got an msg dose symbols up

711
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,880
like that

712
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,720
so wouldn't you like to know or am i

713
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,480
wasting your time

714
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,559
hopefully i'm not wasting your time got

715
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,760
some bananas

716
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:47,600
you know i'd want to know

717
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:49,120
right i mean

718
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,240
so let's get some bananas in the salad

719
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,960
and we're going to put some other things

720
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:55,200
in here too

721
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,200
you guys i think four bananas should

722
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,559
work

723
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:05,520
when it comes down to healing knowledge

724
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:07,840
is power but if you're not

725
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,840
informed on something that's under the

726
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:13,039
wire that's hidden

727
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:17,600
that's secret i remember doing a lecture

728
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:20,880
in 2014 was before book one came out

729
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:23,360
there's a thousand people in the crowd

730
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,360
i was doing a lecture and i opened up

731
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:29,440
the lecture

732
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:31,440
with how if we don't know

733
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,200
something's happening so we can't make a

734
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,440
choice to protect yourself

735
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,200
what if we're not told what if it's

736
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,600
hidden what if it's secret what if

737
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:42,080
you've been

738
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:45,200
tricked what if you've been duped

739
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:49,520
and that's the case with natural flavors

740
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:52,960
right there every single

741
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:54,799
package now of food almost that we'll

742
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,000
you'll see a natural flavoring somewhere

743
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:58,000
in there

744
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
go down the aisle look you'll be in the

745
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,039
natural food store the health food store

746
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,080
you'll see it so

747
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:11,840
why should we worry about msg

748
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:15,440
msg pockets it pockets inside the brain

749
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:18,000
it collects on neurotransmitters

750
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,120
it lowers your battery charge in your

751
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,279
brain

752

it reduces electricity in your brain

753
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:27,679
it does some short circuiting similar to

754
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:30,039
toxic heavy metals

755
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:33,039

764
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:53,440
these half moons right here

765
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:57,039
msg can make or break

766
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:59,520
make or break your healing process

767
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:01,039
just like caffeine can you want to heal

768
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,799
but you can't get quite to the finish

769
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:04,080
line but you don't know why but nobody's

770
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:05,600
telling you it's the caffeine you're

771
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,480
doing whether it's matcha tea chocolate

772
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,960
or coffee

773
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,159
or espresso or green tea or some kind

774
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,360
you don't know that that's what's

775
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:14,799
holding you back it's

776
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:16,320
make or break to the finish line

777
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,000
i mean do you want to get to the finish

778
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,120
line of healing or do you want to kind

779
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,679
of wafer around

780
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:23,440
and stay sick and then kind of try

781
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:26,080
something else and hit some fads

782
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,880
hit some trend go listen to some podcast

783
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,080
person or

784
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,960
hell in health and now you're like doing

785
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,399
something else

786
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,520
and you're really not going to the

787
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:37,440
finish line you're not going all the way

788
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,200
meanwhile you might not even know that

789
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,360
medical media put out information about

790
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,000
msg about natural flavoring a long time

791
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,399
ago

792
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,559
and people forget or people might not

793
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:48,159
have read that chapter or something in

794
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,360
the book that i was showing you earlier

795
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:52,880
then you just kind of stay

796
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:54,480
sick you get the migraines you stay up

797
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,919
all night you got insomnia

798
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:59,600
msg can create some wicked insomnia

799
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,360
i'm not talking about the night you use

800
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:04,480
msg

801
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,480
not talking about that

802
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,320
i'm talking about the fact that it

803
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:10,240
builds up in the brain

804
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,520
becomes a neuroantagonist stays there

805
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,520
for a long time

806
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,440
pockets of msg do some brain damage

807
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,880
where eventually gets seen on an mri

808
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,559
years and years and years down the road

809
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,440
but they don't know that's msg causing a

810
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:21,440
crystallization

811
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:27,679
so let's go into that a little bit msg

812
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:30,559
crystallizes in your brain tissue

813
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:33,440
natural flavoring as harmful and

814
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:35,520
harmless as it sounds

815
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,720
will eventually become a problem as

816
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,520
you're using in your diet for years and

817
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,279
years and years

818
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,120
you get an mri down the road when you're

819
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:42,840
70 years old and they see some white

820
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:47,120
spots

821
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:50,960
crystallizing because

822
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:55,120
msg is

823
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:57,679
is a compound that doesn't wash away

824
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:00,320
stays in tissue builds up as the years

825
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:00,320
go on

826
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,200
and um i think you guys might want to

827
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,480
save

828
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:10,159
some money right now and maybe not have

829
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,520
to go through all that medical

830
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:15,520
testing in hell and back situations

831
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:17,360
because msg is building up in your brain

832
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,159
causing pockets i figured you guys might

833
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,240
want to

834
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:23,520
have a chance to not go there and at

835
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:26,960
least check that one off the list right

836
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:30,000
that would be great so

837
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:32,960

00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,279
bit this is an anti-pathogen food right

884
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,360
here

885
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:43,360
when you're eating onions if you can if

886
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:46,799

887
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:48,799
the smell of onion onion on food

888
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:50,799
you're already like using you're using

889
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:52,240
an antiviral medicine

890
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:54,640
that's what you're doing think about it

891
00:31:52,240 --> 00:32:00,480
right a sulfur and onion

892
00:31:54,640 --> 00:32:02,720
that's a viral killer bacterial killer

893
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,320
so i'm just cutting in this half and

894
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,159
just going down here like that there you

895
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:08,880
go paper thin

896
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:10,880
my eyes are going to run now your

897
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:14,720
central nervous system

898
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:18,640
is highly sensitive

899
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:21,840
msg is an irritant

900
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:24,880
an antagonist troublemaker

901
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:28,240
causes a lot of trouble

902
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:30,880
but you guys aren't on any msg no way

903
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:33,440
you're just unnatural flavors which is

904
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,440
msg

905
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:40,399
what about when it says citric acid

906
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:41,760
yeah stay away from citric acid it's

907
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:42,320
another reason why i like the vimergy

908
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,480
products

909
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:46,159
it's another reason why i like say um

910
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,000
traditional medicinals right here

911
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:49,519
like with the vimergy you take a lid of

912
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,360
energy you get the lemon balm you're not

913
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:52,720
gonna see citric acid in here

914
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,840
there's a couple of companies that are

915
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,440
like prided in their vegan

916
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,720
supplements vim is for anybody who's

00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,880
but there's a couple like vegan

920
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,480
companies

921
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,080
they put they put products out there and

922
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,480
they got citric acid in it

923
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,279
and they think they got the best stuff

924
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,519
they got

925
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:13,519
casey a gum in there they got citric

926
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:14,080
acid in there they got alcohol in there

927
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:16,799
and

928
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,600
and meanwhile they're on this hoo-ha you

929
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:20,240
know rant

930
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:22,159
that this stuff's the best and vegan

931

vegan vegan and all that and it's like

932
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:25,440
what

933
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:27,120
you got citric acid in there that's corn

934
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,039
citric acid is corn

935
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:31,120
that's another trick happening right now

936
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:34,720
citric acid is really bad citric acid

937
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:35,519
isn't from a lemon it's not from an

938
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,159

942
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:46,720
supplements

943
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:48,640
so important to know okay got that

944
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,000
optional is the onion but i like the

945
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,279
onion so that's why i put it in this

946
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,399
salad

947
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:56,480
and optional is celery

948
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:58,240

955
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:16,480
and then they're back on in a few years

956
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,480
they introduce it back so i'm going to

957
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,800
put little pieces of celery on top

958
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,879
it's going to look nice that way too i

959
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,839
gotta make the dressing and i still have

960
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:25,839
some dolls to go

961
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:36,399
showing you what it looks like right now

962
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,960
tina says can you speak more about

963
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:41,280

pieces this is the banana salad okay

966
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:51,280
what's in this salad actually supports

967
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,960
and feeds adrenals keep that in mind

968
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,560
when it comes down to the celery pieces

969
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,079
really good for your adrenals romaine

970
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,760
lettuce great for the adrenals mineral

971
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:01,920
salts critical for your adrenals

972
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:03,280
right onion i'm gonna do the dolls

973
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,560
cucumber which is really good for

974
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:08,240
adrenals

975
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:09,680
um so this is atlantic dulce right here

976
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,880
you see guys i'm just showing you what i

977
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,119
got here

978
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,800
so you can moisten it and put it on you

979
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:17,040
can put it on dry i'm going to moisten

980
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:20,240
it for this recipe so

981
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:21,760
what i do is

982
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,599
i'll leave it in a bowl like this and

983
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:26,720
add a little touch of water

984
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:27,599
real quick i just added a little bit of

985
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,839
water

986
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,599
not a lot just mixing it up a little bit

987
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:33,200
just get it kind of moist

988
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:35,280
you don't want to soak it because then

989
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:38,400
you start losing some of its flavor

990
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,920
if you soak it soak it so

991
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,000
keep that in mind it's a great way to

992
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,760
keep your dolls just so flavorful

993
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,800
right just mixing that up so i'm going

994
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,800
to put some strips

995
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,560
on the cutting board and cut it

996
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:58,720
pop that on top there we go

997
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,160
do that now when it comes down to

998
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:02,240
adrenals you don't want to intermittent

999
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,599
fast unless

1000
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,680
you're doing like the medical medium

1001
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,839
morning cleanse which is

1002
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,440
your lemon water 16 to 30 ounces lemon

1003
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:11,200
water in the morning then you go to 16

1004
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,040
to 32 ounces half an hour later of

1005
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,480
celery juice

1006
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,920
you do that next then you do like a

1007
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,760
smoothie medical medium smoothie heavy

1008
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,800
metal detox smoothie is a great option

1009
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,240
and then you can have a little bit of

1010
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,960
fruit with some fruit snacks or

1011
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,800
something

1012
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,240
or some celery sticks and fruit all the

1013
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,720
way up until lunch

1014
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:28,000
lunch and after you can bring in a fat

1015
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,839
if you want

1016
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,320
or you can bring in some oatmeal you can

1017
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:34,480
bring in some millet but the point is

1018
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,400
is that if you're intermittent fasting

1019
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,320
and you got adrenal issues

1020
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,760
you're hurting your adrenals you got to

1021
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,520
be really careful especially if you're

1022
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,680
intermittent fasting and dropping the

1023
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,079
caffeine in someone's telling you to do

1024
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,440
calf

1025
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:47,119
someone's telling you that caffeine is

1026
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,240
really healthy for you meanwhile you're

1027
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:50,960
killing your adrenals and

1028
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:52,960
and no one no one's teaching you that i

1029
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,599
talked about that in the last couple of

1030
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,800
of lives chocolate it's another one

1031
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:58,079
they'll tell you chocolate's so good for

1032
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,720
you but you kill your adrenals

1033
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,240
you can't get adrenal fatigue better if

1034
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,960
you're doing chocolate

1035
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,960
just letting you know

1036
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:09,040
caffeine there's caffeine in chocolate

1037
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,760
gotta be concerned about that matcha tea

1038
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,520
green tea

1039
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,200
you can't get adrenals better if you

1040
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,760
have an adrenal issue on any level

1041
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,560
you can't get adrenals better if you're

1042
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,880
doing

1043
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,079
any kind of chocolate espresso coffee

1044
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,520
matcha tea

1045
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:22,880
and then the same thing with high fat

1046
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,000
diets you gotta be careful how much

1047
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,520
fat's in your diet

1048
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,599
are you doing chicken twice a day you're

1049
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,200
doing it you're doing um

1050
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:30,880
you're doing bacon you're doing chicken

1051
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,000
are you doing too much nut butters tons

1052
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,480
of peanut butter uh

1053
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,839
you know chocolate what are you doing

1054
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,520
how many fats are you doing you do an

1055
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:38,880
avocado toast and then for lunch you

1056
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,240
have chicken on your salad

1057
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,520
then later in the afternoon you eat a

1058
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:43,040
chocolate bar then at night you have

1059
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,599
more chicken or you have something else

1060
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,760
right

1061
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:47,359
and then you have oil somewhere on all

1062
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,920
the stuff so there's so much fat in

1063
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:50,079
there

1064
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,920
you then then you you also kill the

1065
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:53,119
adrenals over time the adrenals can't

1066
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,359
keep up with that because

1067
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:57,040
your adrenals have to spill out all this

1068
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:58,000
epinephrine to thin out your blood

1069
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,320
because your heart

1070
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,760
is like oh my god if you keep on putting

1071
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,160
fat inside my bloodstream

1072
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,839
all day long every day i'm going to give

1073
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,599
out on you that's that's the whole point

1074
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:09,200
the heart and the brain they work

1075
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:11,280
together and they're saying stop the

1076
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:13,359
fats stop the fats

1077
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,040
and a way to bring your adrenals back is

1078
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:16,640
to actually eat every hour

1079
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,320
hour and a half to two hours depending

1080
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:20,079
on how bad your adrenals are

1081
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,680
have an apple and some celery have some

1082
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:24,640
dates and some celery sticks

1083
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:26,560
have a couple of oranges have a banana

1084
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,880
and some celery banana and some lettuce

1085
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,320
so

1086
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,800
there's all these different combinations

1087
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:33,599
i call them adrenal snacks

1088
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:35,200
and it what it does is it replaces your

1089
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:36,640
blood sugar so adrenaline doesn't have

1090
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,160
to replace your blood sugar so i'll just

1091
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:40,079
run this by you real quick

1092
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,280
so when you don't eat and too many hours

1093
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,040
go by

1094
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,800
you you drop your blood sugar blood

1095
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:47,839
sugar drops right

1096
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,560
and then your poor adrenals they have to

1097
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:50,400
pour out

1098
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,599
all this adrenaline just dump out all

1099
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,920
this adrenaline

1100
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:55,520
because adrenaline takes place of blood

1101
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,520
sugar when blood sugar is missing

1102
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:59,119
adrenaline have the adrenals try to

1103
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,640
become blood sugar

1104
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:02,240
and then you wear them out you wear them

1105
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,599
out you wear them out and no one teaches

1106
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,359
you how to knot and then you're just

1107
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:08,000
adrenal fatigue later on and then

1108
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:10,079
then you lose the hair for women they

1109
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,400
all lose their hair their hair thins

1110
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:14,560
their their skin ages they get the

1111
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,280
wrinkles they get the hard childbirths

1112
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:18,320
they get

1113
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:20,320
they get the um you know they get

1114
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,079
difficult they can even get miscarriages

1115
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,680
they can get the adrenals just start

1116
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:25,839
getting all beat up

1117
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,040
um you get the hormone imbalances

1118
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:29,440
constantly

1119
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:31,359
and all these things happen then you get

1120
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,839
all the sun spots the skin ages you

1121
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:33,680
gotta

1122
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:35,680
then everybody's running to get botox

1123
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:38,400
and all these other problems

1124
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,359
and there's a whole adrenal section in

1125
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,040
medical medium

1126
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:44,160
the new addition so make sure you get

1127
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,160
that and you check it out

1128
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,880
when dulce gets wet it makes a mess

1129
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:54,800
what causes high cortisol

1130
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,440
high fat diet is one thing right there

1131
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,040
so

1132
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,280
too many fats in the diet every single

1133
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,920
day high cortisol caffeine is the

1134
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,359
biggest

1135
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:06,400
high cortisol causer there is chocolate

1136
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:07,520
biggest high cortisol causer there is is

1137
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,480
caffeine

1138
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:11,920
when you do caffeine you annihilate your

1139
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:14,640
adrenal glands

1140
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,119
annihilate them and no one wants to talk

1141
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,640
about it

1142
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,800
everybody wants to pretend it's fine and

1143
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,920
good i notice that the podcast doctors

1144
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,880
want to pretend it's fine and good

1145
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,160
because they don't want to

1146
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,400
they don't want to stop their caffeine

1147
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:29,040
addiction they love it and

1148
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:30,880
i noticed that um men in health

1149
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,640
they don't know women's health is

1150
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,400
different they just don't

1151
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,000
they don't they think women should be

1152
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,760
following the lead of men

1153
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,119
that's what they believe so all the

1154
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,480
health gurus that are men they just

1155
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:42,079
think women should be following whatever

1156
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:45,119
they're doing you know what i mean

1157
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:46,720
and they don't know that women's

1158
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:49,280
adrenals are designed differently

1159
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:51,119
because women's adrenals produce all the

1160
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:54,720
progesterone i'll produce all the

1161
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:58,000
the estrogen produce reproductive system

1162
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,640
hormones right men's adrenals don't do

1163
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,280
that

1164
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:02,240
so you know and and men don't have to

1165
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,480
have babies

1166
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:06,000
they don't have babies so what happens

1167
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,440
is that men's adrenals are entirely

1168
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,839
different than women's adrenals and

1169
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,680
it also covers all of women's health

1170
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:13,839
entirely different than men's health

1171
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:16,240
but men will actually promote things

1172
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:17,599
that destroy women's health so men gurus

1173
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,440
and men podcast

1174
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:21,200
heroes and doctors and other people and

1175
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:24,319
health enthusiasts and trainers and

1176
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:25,920
and and health coaches they just promote

1177
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:27,040
things that hurt women's health in

1178
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,359
natural health

1179
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,800
conventional health too not everything

1180
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:32,480
but a lot of stuff

1181
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,920
i just just don't know i'm gonna give

1182
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,240
them some credit they have some stuff

1183
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:38,720
right here and there

1184
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:40,319
anyway so let's make let's make this

1185
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:43,839
let's make the dressing

1186
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:43,839
let's go there let me grab a bowl

1187
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:50,160
so let's make a dressing i'm gonna half

1188
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,160
a cup of orange

1189
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:54,800
juice got some oranges here probably do

1190
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,800
a little bit more

1191
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:01,520
when you go long hours

1192
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:03,280
of no food you're gonna get high

1193
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:05,839
cortisol

1194
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:07,680
long hours of no food now if you go long

1195
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:09,040
hours and in between those long hours is

1196
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:11,599
celery juice

1197
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:12,560
maybe a heavy metal detox smoothie maybe

1198
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:16,000
another smoothie

1199
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:18,480
maybe some lemon water maybe an apple

1200
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
that's different when you go long hours

1201
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,640
without food

1202
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,800
and then the food you choose is caffeine

1203
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:27,680
even if you don't choose caffeine or not

1204
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,480
you just kill your adrenals the cortisol

1205
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,079
that's how

1206
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:32,240
you literally get the high cortisol

1207
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:33,200
that's how you eventually high cortisol

1208
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:36,319
is a cry

1209
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:37,440
for help it's your adrenals crying for

1210
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:40,079
help

00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,880
it's saying stop whatever it is you're

1212
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:43,599
doing

1213
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,079
stop destroying me stop hurting me

1214
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:45,520
because

1215
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:47,119
you're going to have a shortened life

1216
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,839
because of it and that's what high

1217
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:52,960
cortisol is it's a warning sign

1218
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:55,440
for you to adhere and listen and

1219
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,800
hear not just adhere and it's like and

1220
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:01,200
you know it's really important

1221
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:04,400
so and that you know so much information

1222
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:07,520
i'm gonna squeeze some oranges by hand

1223
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:08,720
aren't oranges high in sugar mary meets

1224
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:11,119
high in sugar

1225
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:12,720
everything's high in sugar everything's

1226
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:17,280
high in sugar

1227
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:20,319
um the blood in meat

1228
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:24,319
is glucose so the cow's blood

1229
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:26,960
is sweet cow blood is sweet

1230
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:29,040
chicken blood is sweet it's actually

1231
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:32,160
really sweet

1232
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:33,119
it's all sugar so meat's filled every

1233
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,960
blood vessel

1234
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:36,640
in that meat is filled with sugar it's

1235
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:38,960
called glucose blood sugar

1236
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:41,040
so when you fry up that meat have that

1237
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,160
burger you're having a sugar bomb and

1238
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,400
fat bomb combined

1239
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:46,560
it's just that they chose not to tell

1240
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:49,200
you that part they chose not to measure

1241
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,200
that part

1242
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:56,800
your blood sugar is filled with sugar

1243
00:43:54,800 --> 00:44:02,160
your blood is filled with sugar

1244
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:02,160
so everything has sugar in it

1245
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:08,319
but an orange has vitamin c in it

1246
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:08,720
phytochemical compounds calcium to stop

1247
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:11,359
your

1248
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:13,280
teeth from falling apart so you're not

1249
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:14,319
getting root canals and veneers and

1250
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,839
implants

1251
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:17,359
and getting drilled at the dentist all

1252
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:20,240
the time that's what

1253
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:21,760
oranges have meat doesn't have that and

1254
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,240
i'm not anti-meat if you want to eat

1255
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:25,520
meat

1256
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:26,240
meat at least doesn't feed bugs dairy

1257
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,240
does

1258
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,520
eggs feed bugs they feed bugs if you're

1259
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,880
like bugs what's he talking about i'm

1260
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,240
talking about the bugs inside your body

1261
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:35,440
that cause every single illness and

1262
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:38,560
aches and pains that you have

1263
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:41,599
eggs milk cheese dairy that will feed it

1264
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:42,960
but um

1265
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,880
making a little bit more orange juice

1266
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:48,000
here

1267
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:49,760
but yeah and

1268
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,760
and and it's not that there's too much

1269
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,720
sugar in in fruit that's not at all

1270
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,400
fruit's got

1271
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,000
living water in it phytochemical

1272
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,119
compounds it's got minerals trace

1273
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,800
minerals it's got nutrients it's got

1274
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:01,440
vitamins it's got all that in there

1275
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,440
pulp fiber

1276
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:08,319
fasting promotes longevity is that true

1277
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:09,040
fasting during a crisis can be very

1278
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:11,440
healing

1279
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:13,040
to allow your body to heal while in that

1280
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:16,839
crisis

1281
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:18,480
but short fasts one day two day three

1282
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:20,400
day

1283
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,839
you get food poisoning you can't eat the

1284
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,920
next day

1285
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:25,680
you'll just go downhill it's almost like

1286
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,560
best you can do is just sip a little

1287
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,400
something right

1288
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:30,079
so you're fasting so your body can fight

1289
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,800
whatever that foodborne pathogen and

1290
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:32,400
enter your body

1291
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,319
when you've got food poisoning see how

1292
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,680
it works short fast

1293
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:38,240
are healing in many ways i've talked

1294
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:41,359
about that but long

1295
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:45,760
long fasts where there's nothing but

1296
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:48,160
water starts to just drain you

1297
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:49,680
it starts to drain your trace minerals

1298
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:51,200
it starts to take minerals out of the

1299
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,880
bones over time

1300
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,400
it all depends on the person in the

1301
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,400
situation

1302
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:57,839
i noticed that if you got chronic

1303
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,839
illness you're suffering from chronic

1304
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:02,560
illness a long water fast is not

1305
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:02,560
ideal no

1306
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,240
and

1307
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:12,560
so that's something to think about just

1308
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:15,839
so you know anyway i got some orange

1309
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,839
juice here

1310
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:21,839
so when you do long time water fast long

1311
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:24,880
you know do long water fasts you do

1312
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:26,480
week 10 days 14 days 21 days no one

1313
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:28,000
knows what's happening inside of you

1314
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,960
they can't tell what's happening so i

1315
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,480
mean nobody

1316
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:32,160
nobody's going to know and how to

1317
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,680
measure anything in there it's not like

1318
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,359
how do you measure

1319
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,800
anything in there like how can you

1320
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:38,240
measure what happened to your adrenals

1321
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,520
during that water fast how can you

1322
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:41,119
measure anything and then you've got to

1323
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,720
recoup from that water fast and recoup

1324
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:44,960
from that water fast

1325
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:47,040
it's it i don't recommend the long water

1326
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:49,440
fasts i don't i don't because

1327
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:51,440
it's it's i recommend knowing why you're

1328
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,960
sick and not having to go that route

1329
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,800
that's something that hits

1330
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:56,079
when you're desperate and you don't

1331
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,440
really have anywhere to go

1332
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:59,680
and you don't know why you're sexy end

1333
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:02,160
up doing a long water fast

1334
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:03,599
but i recommend finding out why you're

1335
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:05,200
sick how about that so you don't have to

1336
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:06,480
do a water fast

1337
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:10,000
so let's do a little bit of honey in

1338
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:12,000
this dressing i'm gonna mix this up

1339
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,599
do about two teaspoons could do a

1340
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,560
tablespoon if you really want to in this

1341
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:17,920
dressing

1342
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:17,920
but i'm gonna like two teaspoons

1343
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:22,559
trina said i helped i felt so sick after

1344
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,880
two days of celery juice

1345
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:26,880
what else is going on in your life are

1346
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:28,240
you what foods are you doing

1347
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:29,920
what foods were you doing in those two

1348
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,880
days are you doing nutritional yeast are

1349
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:33,520
you doing vinegars

1350
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:35,520
so your vinegar free your apple cider

1351
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:37,680
vinegar free your vinegar's free of all

1352
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:41,040
kinds your nutritional yeast free

1353
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:42,559
you're you're caffeine free completely

1354
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,599
caffeine free so you don't do caffeine

1355
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:44,720
at all

1356
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:48,400
these are some of the things to think

1357
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:51,359
about here also

1358
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,960
celery juice were you doing it without

1359
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:54,559
lemon were you doing it by itself

1360
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:56,000
how many ounces of celery juice did you

1361
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:57,680
do that's another thing too

1362
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,760
did you buy it in a store did you juice

1363
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:01,359
it yourself was it hpp

1364
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,800
did you buy it in the store and it was

1365
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:04,880
high pressure pasteurization because

1366
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:08,480
that'll make you sick

1367
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:09,520
um you never had a symptom before that

1368
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,119
celery juice

1369
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:12,319
so you've never been sick so you're

1370
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:13,680
drinking celery juice because you're a

1371
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:15,920
healthy person with no problems and

1372
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:18,559
you're drinking celery juice because

1373
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:20,720
you just want to drink it or you

1374
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:21,520
actually have symptoms and you felt sick

1375
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,440
before like

1376
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:24,720
last week or two months ago or six

1377
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,680
months ago and you've been to all these

1378
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:27,359
different doctors

1379
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:29,200
it's just these are all questions to ask

1380
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:32,000
yourself to see where you stand

1381
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:33,839
and then kind of see if you can be your

1382
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,520
own detective and maybe you can try

1383
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:36,480
celery juice again someday you never

1384
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,920
know

1385
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:41,520
so i just put raw honey in here and i

1386
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:41,520
mixed it up with the orange juice

1387
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:49,040
are you really toxic really toxic

1388
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,720
did the celery juice hit the liver how

1389
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:52,079
much did you drink

1390
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,000
celery just gets into the liver and

1391
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:55,920
fleshes out all this stuff

1392
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,599
so here's the salad right here it's

1393
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,920
really pretty like this

1394
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:02,240

00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,880
sliced onions i got the little dolls on

1396
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,559

and they add a really bad one they add a

1408
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:32,880
really bad one to

1409
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:32,880
the nutritional yeast um

1410
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:37,200
jane says intermittent fasting is

1411
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:40,160
supposed to be good for type 1

1412
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:41,200
type 2 diabetes sorry type 2 diabetes i

1413
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:43,839
stopped doing it

1414
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,720
and then gained a few pounds i don't

1415
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:47,280
want to go back

1416
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:47,839
fasting but it did help me maintain my

1417
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:51,359
weight

1418
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:54,400
which is 57 is more um

1419
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:55,920
which at 57 is more important than me um

1420
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:58,160
you don't have to intermittent fast to

1421
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,880
get your weight down why don't you once

1422
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,800
you um

1423
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:02,319
learn how to lower your fats that's one

1424
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,280
thing right there that's that's the

1425
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:04,720
whole thing there too

1426
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:06,160
what happens is the reason why i was

1427
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:07,680
helping you is because you got rid of

1428
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:09,359
your fats in the morning

1429
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,720
that's what it did the worst thing for

1430
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:12,800
diabetics

1431
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:14,160
hear me out everybody here i mean this

1432
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,680
is good for if you know somebody who's a

1433
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:17,200
diabetic this is really good emphasis

1434
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:20,319
you might want to hear this

1435
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:22,400
um when it comes down to diabetes the

1436
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:24,079
worst thing you could ever do is eat a

1437
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:28,240
fat in the morning so bacon

1438
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:31,440
and egg cheese butter milk avocado

1439
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:31,920
nuts seed oils any of that in the

1440
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,920
morning

1441
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,960
is the worst thing you can do as a

1442
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:37,119
diabetic

1443
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:39,520
because all that does is it keeps on

1444
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:40,000
compiling on that insulin resistance and

1445
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,760
keeps on

1446
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,280
creating that insulin resistance and

1447
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:44,880
insulin it's the fats

1448
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,640
fats first thing in the morning or mid

1449
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:48,160
morning it's all those fats that

1450
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,200
actually cause the reason why you were

1451
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,640
getting a little better and dropping

1452
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,160
some weights is because you gave your

1453
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:54,400
liver a break

1454
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:56,000
and you stopped eating fats in the

1455
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,839
morning that's all that was it's not

1456
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,880
like intermittent fasting is this

1457
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:02,960
is this this incredible thing

1458
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,400
oh my god i found the holy grail

1459
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,920
intermittent fasting no

1460
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,000
all it is is you stopped your fats in

1461
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:09,440
the morning that's all it was

1462
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,880
i mean you don't have to intermittent

1463
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,000
fast you'd be like wake up one morning

1464
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,520
but like you know what

1465
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,119
i'm gonna do medical medium stuff and

1466
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:16,160
stop my fats in the morning i'm not

1467
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:18,000
gonna down all this

1468
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:19,440
milk cheese butter bacon eggs oils

1469
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,800
peanut butter peanut butter in the

1470
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,280
morning peanut butter and oatmeal in the

1471
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,280
morning

1472
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:26,240
even oatmeal is high in fat oatmeal

1473
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:28,800
itself so imagine putting fat on it

1474
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:30,240
so what happens is you guys is that that

1475
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,520
just gives you insulin resistance so

1476
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:33,359
when you get rid of that

1477
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:34,960
as a diabetic you're going to be like

1478
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:36,960
whoa i'm losing some weight because your

1479
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:38,800
liver is recouping it's starting to

1480
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,240
survive again you're not

1481
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:43,760
killing it with fats you're not

1482
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:43,760
bombarding it with fats

1483
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,760
if you did this banana salad like mid

1484
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:50,240
mid morning

1485
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:51,760
and did some celery juice early morning

1486
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:53,359
and some lemon water and then you

1487

guys want to come over going to talk

1517
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:51,040
more

1518
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:52,800
about everything keep in mind about the

1519
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,280
natural flavors whatever you do protect

1520
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:56,400
yourself

1521
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:57,520
look out it's important

1522
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:59,359
if you're looking for teas without

1523
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:00,480
natural flavoring boom you got the

1524
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:02,720
traditional medicinals

1525
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:04,000
not sponsored looking for supplements

1526
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:05,760
without natural flavoring

1527
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,359
that's critical like the curcumin or

1528
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:09,839
anything from memorgy

1529
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:11,200
no natural flavors keep that in mind

1530
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:11,839
they're actually smart enough to know

1531
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,920
that

1532
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:15,119
and that right there says everything

1533
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:17,119
because companies all

1534
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:18,880
use natural flavors they got msg and all

1535
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:21,359
their stuff out there look out

1536
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:22,960
it's a trick and all it does is just

1537
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:24,839
take you down the wrong path

1538
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:27,839
