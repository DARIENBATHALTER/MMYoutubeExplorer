okay and we're going to be talking about

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,779
some other cool stuff what happens

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,059
inside our brain when we have a

4
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:11,160
relationship that breaks up friendship

5
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:13,019
that breaks up

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,360
family member

7
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:18,060
relationship that breaks up

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,640
anything like that if any of you have

9
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,080

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,320
either relationship whether it's

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,539
Intimate Relationships that break up

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:30,539
Partnerships that break up friendships

13
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:33,480
that break up but we're not intimate

14
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:34,559
right family member relationships that

15
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,780
break up

00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:57,239
your brain in this area

00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:14,580
your soul which normally resides in your

77
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:18,540
brain

78
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:20,519
gets projected boom

79
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:22,500
out of your body

80
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:25,980
to protect you

81
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:28,500
from a certain amount of Soul injury

82
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:31,680
everything's going great my soul's over

00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:34,040

84
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,200

86
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,599

88
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:53,360
projects out of your body to protect you

89
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,360
from a certain amount of Soul injury

90
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,760
that's what happens it's protecting you

91
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:03,840
from a certain amount of Soul injury so

92
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,980
it projects out of your head out of your

93
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,420
body

94
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:08,400
and that's the whole thing where

95
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:10,200
someone's like

96
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,480
I was out of body that was an

97
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:15,680
out-of-body experience I was looking

98
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,680
down at myself

99
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,740
when that car crash happened I saw

100
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:26,120
myself it was as if I was out of body

101
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,120
that wasn't even in me

102
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:32,460
some people can feel this out-of-body

103
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:35,100
experience watching themselves from afar

104
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:37,259
or even above where they're seeing

105
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:39,240
themselves even if they can't physically

106
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:41,880
see themselves they see themselves

107
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,759
there's a feeling they get their soul

108
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:47,240
was projected out of their head out of

109
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:47,240
their body

110
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:53,540
Ivan says it's a soul not inside the

111
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,540
heart the soul is not inside the heart

112
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:58,919
and I talked about this the other day

113
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:02,280
it's why in the medieval times they

114
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:04,979
focused on beheading everybody

115
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:07,259
right they beheaded everybody

116
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:08,699
and there was a reason for that because

117
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:11,820
there was

118
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:15,540
in essence everybody knew

119
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:18,240
that this was the most important area

120
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:20,699
not because we spoke but because it's

121
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,100
the most important area

122
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:25,740
was here

123
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:28,560
punishment

124
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:31,020
was the guillotine punishment was always

125
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,900
chopping everybody's heads off and then

126
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:35,820
putting their heads on a pike right and

127
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,979
having their heads on a pike so you walk

128
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:39,479
through the village and everybody in the

129
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:42,440
Villager heads are all chopped off and

130
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:42,440
they're on the bikes right

131
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:48,660
there's a reason why they use the

132
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:50,340
guillotine for so many centuries

133
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:54,000
in Europe

134
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:57,539
old England they use the guillotine

135
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,720
because chopping off the head was the

136
00:05:57,539 --> 00:06:03,419
most satisfying it was the status that

137
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,300
that was the that was the satisfying

138
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:08,639
aspect

139
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:11,100
that made everybody happy that wanted to

140
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,080
chop that person's head off they weren't

141
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,940
happy until their head was chopped off

142
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,860
they weren't happy if they were killed

143
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,539
they weren't happy if they were stabbed

144
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:21,479
in a kill or killed in a different way

145
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:26,039
they weren't

146
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:28,139
they weren't happy if they were drowned

147
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:31,819
they were happy

148
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:31,819
when their heads were chopped off

149
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,340
some people so what I'm talking about is

150
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,259
emotional events if you just got on here

151
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,400
would I I'm saying something really

152
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:43,860
really

153
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:46,740
profound piece of information from above

154
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:48,419
is that our soul is in this area

155
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,520
and if you believe your soul is down in

156
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:52,199
your feet if you believe your soul is

157
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,699
where your feet is that's fine too and

158
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:55,979
then it gets projected out of the body

159
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:58,259
fine Erica Mallett says I remember when

160
00:06:55,979 --> 00:07:01,940
I first heard this information from aw I

161
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:01,940
was shocked but it makes so much sense

162
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:08,340
if you believe your soul is in your knee

163
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:10,919
if you believe your soul is in your knee

164
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:12,960
that's where your soul is

165
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:14,400
if that makes you feel better if you're

166
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,960
somebody that just doesn't believe the

167
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,580
soul is in this area you don't believe

168
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,660
the soul is here

169
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,660
you don't believe that

170
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,160
you think your soul is here in your knee

171
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:32,639
the healing shop table on IG says that's

172
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:36,840
why we say I was beside myself

173
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:39,360
so true so true

174
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:42,360
another comment on IG

175
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,400
and my mommy says this makes no s this

176
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:47,880
makes so much sense because when I was

177
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,740
15 or 16 and living in a toxic home my

178
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,900
soul must have left because there is a

179
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:54,419
period of time when I felt like I was

180
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:57,680
watching my life from above yes because

181
00:07:54,419 --> 00:08:00,840
it protects your soul it's an innate

182
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:04,199
internal guidance and wisdom of our body

183
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:06,720
to project our soul out

184
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:09,000
Justina

185
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,539
it happened to me and I thought I was

186
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,539
going crazy

187
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:16,500
we go through a hard time something

188
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:19,259
happens to us

189
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:22,199
okay let's see every

190
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:24,120
every melt heel says melto heel says I

191
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:25,680
feel like mine never came back and

192
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,000
that's something people can feel when

193
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,460
they've been traumatized they feel like

194
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,740
their soul has never come back that does

195
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:34,020
happen where they feel that way

196
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:35,520
we go through a hard time we go through

197
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:37,800
an experience that's really scary

198
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,719
something happens emotionally or we're

199
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:42,240
emotionally abused or we have a

200
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:44,940
relationship breakup where it's so

201
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,980
traumatizing that relationship break up

202
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:50,160
that you feel like you're watching

203
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:52,920
yourself from above or you're beside

204
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:56,279
yourself like you just said earlier you

205
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:59,760
feel like you're witnessing it

206
00:08:56,279 --> 00:09:02,399
and in an out-of-body experience you

207
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:06,300
feel as if you're witnessing it from

208
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:08,940
afar that's what it feels like

209
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:11,279
that's because Spirit of compassion gave

210
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:13,680
me this information to answer why anyone

211
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,779
has ever felt that way and put it in the

212
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,820
brain saver book Because when we go

213
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:20,339
through an experience

214
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:22,500
and we're walking along and our soul is

215
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:24,779
here

216
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:28,620
and then boom that experience happens

217
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:31,560
and our souls projected out of us

218
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:32,820
Boom Out Of Us

219
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,160
and there's somebody that doesn't

220
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:37,140
believe what Spirit of compassion said

221
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,180
where our soul resides in our brain our

222
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:40,920
soul resides in this area and you

223
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:44,700
believe your soul resides in your feet

224
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:46,200
I'm not judging you that's fine if you

225
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,600
believe your soul is in your knee that's

226
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:51,839
where your soul is it's in your name

227
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:56,180
fine it's still projected boom out of

228
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,180
you when you go through an experience

229
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:04,560
some people can feel this out of Body

230
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:06,839
Experience watching themselves from afar

231
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:10,940
or even above

232
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:10,940
this is a safety mechanism

233
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:15,440
this is a safety mechanism

234
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:19,800
this way your soul doesn't have to

235
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:26,160
experience the full amount of pain from

236
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:29,480
betrayal or loss betrayal hurts so bad

237
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,480
God does it ever

238
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,680
Nito says when I have gone through Nito

239
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,600
and Rumble

240
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:39,300
says when I have gone through emotional

241
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,820
trauma I always felt like I was out of

242
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:44,100
it like my mind was not working or gone

243
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:46,579
or something thank you for explaining

244
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,579
this feeling

245
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:54,180
this way your soul doesn't have to

246
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,779
experience the full amount of pain just

247
00:10:54,180 --> 00:11:00,120
partial pain our soul feels partial pain

248
00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:02,360
like part of it

249
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,360
foreign

250
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:11,399
hurts so bad

251
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:14,040
it's hell

252
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:16,500
betrayal is hell

253
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:19,700
it's hell

254
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,700
that's what betrayal is

255
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:29,060
loss hurts so bad

256
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:29,060
loss

257
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:33,839
Indescribable unless you walked in that

258
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,360
person's shoes do you know what that

259
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:39,540
loss feels like if someone's lost may

260
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:42,300
not seem big but it's big someone's

261
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:43,860
betrayal may not seem big but it's big

262
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:46,860
to them

263
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:48,899
and when it's big enough to them where

264
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:52,200
it hurts

265
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:56,220
then boom the souls

266
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:58,740
cast out for a moment to protect it so

267
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:01,560
it's only partial hurt

268
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:03,959

occurrence of Mike the Headless Chicken

292
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:12,440
it's an unbelievable

293
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,440
true story

294
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:18,060
Mike was a chicken

295
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:21,480
in the 1940s

296
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:23,660
who survived long after his head was cut

297
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,660
off

298
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:31,860
Mike the Headless Chicken was a chicken

299
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:35,060
that had his head cut off

300
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:35,060
and still was alive

301
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:44,279
there are a lot of theories

302
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:46,500
theories out there about how this

303
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:48,959
happened how can Mike the Headless

304
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:51,899
Chicken walk around

305
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:54,980
eating out of his neck

306
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:54,980
and stay alive

307
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:04,620
after hearing this story at the time in

308
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:06,240
the 1940s

309
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:08,959
hundreds

310
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:12,360
and hundreds of farmers

311
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:17,300
worldwide started chopping their

312
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:17,300
chickens heads off in experimental ways

313
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:25,820
thousands upon thousands upon thousands

314
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:29,100
of chickens were beheaded in different

315
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:31,639
grotesque ways to see if they would

316
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,639
survive it

317
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:41,339
it became an obsession

318
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:45,240
chopping the heads off in various places

319
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:49,440
because people were in such disbelief so

320
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:52,320
farmers were chopping chickens heads off

321
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:55,940
in different places on the chicken

322
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,940
different places on the chicken

323
00:14:56,279 --> 00:15:01,440
because they were in complete disbelief

324
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:04,620
complete disbelief

325
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:07,579
so they were chopping chickens heads off

326
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,579
is what they were doing

327
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,019
because they're in disbelief

328
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,240
Farmers would

329
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:32,579
sever the heads higher up

330
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,519
okay so you got your chicken

331
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:37,079
they would sever the heads higher up

332
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,760
because they're thinking how is this

333
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:40,560
even possible

334
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:43,019
so hundreds and hundreds of chickens

335
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,820
were beheaded but higher up in all kinds

336
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:46,500
of different places because they don't

337
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:49,139
understand how a chicken can get his

338
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:51,600
head completely cut off

339
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:54,380
and still go around and eat through its

340
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,380
neck and live

341
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:01,139
it became an obsession chopping the

342
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:03,899
heads off in various places because

343
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:05,639
people were in such disbelief Farmers

344
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:08,100
would severe the heads higher up

345
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:11,339
preserving even more of the chicken's

346
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:12,560
neck and brain stem than mics

347
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:16,380
foreign

348
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:19,260
ERS preserved more of the brain stem

349
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:22,199
than Mike the Headless Chicken whose

350
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:25,800
head was completely cut off so farmers

351
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:28,260
were cutting off all kinds of places on

352
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:32,339
chickens everywhere

353
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:34,380
chopping their heads off chunk chunk

354
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:36,480
and they were doing it higher up trying

355
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:39,000
to preserve as much brain stem as

356
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,800
possible trying to even preserve half

357
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,980
the brain and they were chopping the

358
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,660
chicken's head off

359
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:48,480
Cornelius says I've heard you say that

360
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:51,480
so often now but it always blows my mind

361
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:54,120
because my work as a psychotherapist is

362
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:56,720
so different now Cornelia monitor here

363
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,720
truly

364
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:06,839
Farmers would never Farmers would severe

365
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:08,819
the heads higher up preserving even more

366
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:11,939
of the chicken's neck and brainstem than

367
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:14,400
mics than Mike's neck Mike the chicken

368
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:16,819
that lived and was walking around and

369
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,819
eating

370
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:21,179
trying to see if their chickens would

371
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:23,939
live too

372
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:27,059
over a hundred thousand chickens were

373
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:29,640
beheaded in this process over a hundred

374
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:32,040
thousand chickens were beheaded during

375
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:35,100
this process

376
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:36,720
and they never survived not one chicken

377
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,120
survived

378
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,500
but Mike

379
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:43,160
survived and Mike had his whole head

380
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,160
chopped off

381
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:50,760
here's what no one knows about how Mike

382
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,460
stayed alive

383
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:55,380
get ready for this

384
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:58,860
because I asked Spirit of compassion

385
00:17:55,380 --> 00:18:00,600
questions it's one of my pastimes and I

386
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,799
thought I would put one of my little

387
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,559
pastimes because I asked Spirit

388
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:06,419
compassion can I please ask you a

389
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:09,419
question about Mike the Headless Chicken

390
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:11,880
I would love to put Mike the Headless

391
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:13,320
Chicken in here and sort of compassion

392
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,419
it's like it's not what you want to put

393
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:18,419
in here

394
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:21,860
it's what's important which which is

395
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:21,860
critically important for people

396
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:26,400
because it's not all about Anthony

397
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,360
William or these books would be all

398
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,360
about Anthony William

399
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:35,940
and spirit of compassion

400
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,640
gave me a little gift

401
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:41,460
and said I will put

402
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:45,000
Mike the Headless Chicken

403
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:46,919
inside the brain saver book

404
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,660
over a hundred thousand chickens were

405
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:50,820
beheaded in this process and they never

406
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:53,460
survived here's what no one knows about

407
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:56,160
how Mike stayed alive

408
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:58,799
when I asked Spirit of compassion and

409
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,660
why it's relevant here and that's also

410
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,820
why Spirit of compassion let me put Mike

411
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:06,000
the Headless Chicken in here because it

412
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:09,740
was relevant

413
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,740
a chicken has a soul

414
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,539
that's not me saying it

415
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,980
that's not me saying a chicken has a

416
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,980
soul

417
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:24,179
not like when a plant-based person says

418
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,280
all animals have soul

419
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:28,080
have a soul no that's not me saying it

420
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:30,780
Spirit of compassion is saying a chicken

421
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:33,780
has a soul this isn't an anti-chicken

422
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:35,400
anti this is an anti-vegan this isn't

423
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,960
whatever or this is vegan whatever

424
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,299
that's not what all this is

425
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:42,020
this isn't a talk having anything to do

426
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:42,020
with any of that

427
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:50,760
a chicken has a soul which normally

428
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:52,980
resides in its brain Spirit of

429
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:56,580
compassion told me that a chicken has a

430
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:58,559
soul which resides in the chicken's

431
00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:00,900
brain

432
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:05,660
just like ours

433
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:05,660
just like our soul that resides here

434
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:13,700
at the traumatic time of having Mike's

435
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:13,700
head chopped off

436
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:20,419
this chicken soul

437
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:20,419
left the chicken's brain

438
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:30,360
instead of floating away Into The Ether

439
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:32,880
when someone dies

440
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:37,140
or a pet dies

441
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:40,400
and their soul leaves them and floats

442
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:40,400
out of their head

443
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:48,860
they passed away their soul is floating

444
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:48,860
away their soul enters the ether

445
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:58,559
instead of floating away in the ether as

446
00:20:55,620 --> 00:21:00,539
the chicken's body died the chicken's

447
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:03,120
body died

448
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:08,480
the head was chopped off of my the

449
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:08,480
chicken and the body instead of dying

450
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:13,620
stayed alive

451
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,720
instead of floating away in the ether as

452
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:18,299
the chicken bodies died chicken's body

453
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:21,299
died the chicken's Soul entered into the

454
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:26,059
chicken's body hear this Spirit of

455
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:26,059
compassion answered a question for me

456
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:34,520
and it blows my freaking mind it blows

457
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:34,520
my mind

458
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:41,820
the chicken soul entered into the

459
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:45,980
chicken's body

460
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:45,980
instead of floating away in The Ether

461
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:53,159
get ready for this

462
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:55,559
giving the physical body's will the will

463
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:56,880
which is called strength

464
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:58,799
strength

465
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,500
giving the

466
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:03,179
physical body of the chicken the

467
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:05,940
chickens will

468
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:08,400
extra strength to survive

469
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:11,039
and all the other Farmers chopped off

470
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,679
thousands upon thousands hundreds of

471
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:17,400
thousands of chickens heads off

472
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:20,159
but those chickens Souls did not go back

473
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:22,980
and enter into the chicken's body those

474
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:24,360
chicken Souls

475
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:27,000
floated up

476
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:28,980
to The Ether

477
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,080
hundreds of thousands of chickens that

478
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:32,280
were beheaded those Souls of those

479
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:35,780
chickens

480
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,780
floated to The Ether

481
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:41,059
and did not re-enter into the chicken's

482
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:45,260
body

483
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:45,260
but Mike the Headless Chicken

484
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:48,559
his soul

485
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:56,100
entered into the body

486
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:57,480
and granted the body extra strength to

487
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:00,299
survive

488
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:03,260
get ready for this one this will blow

489
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:03,260
your mind

490
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:08,059
not only

491
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,679
did the soul of that chicken enter into

492
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:15,419
the body giving the body physical

493
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,059
strength

494
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:21,559
by adding to the physical will power the

495
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:21,559
will and the strength of that chicken

496
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:27,780
but the soul had intelligence in it do

497
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,919
you believe your soul has Intelligence

498
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:31,320
in it

499
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:34,260
when you leave here it has no

500
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:37,740
intelligence in it when your soul leaves

501
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:41,000
here it has Intelligence inside the soul

502
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:41,000
as it leaves here

503
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:48,240
Spirit of compassion told me

504
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,039
instead of floating away into the ether

505
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,780
as the chicken's body died the chicken

506
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:54,419
soul entered into the chicken's body

507
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:56,640
giving the physical body's will extra

508
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:58,740
strength to survive along with

509
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:01,679
intelligence this is the part that blows

510
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:04,740
my mind along with intelligence the soul

511
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:07,020
had gathered from the chicken's brain

512
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:09,360
the soul of the chicken gathered

513
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:12,419
intelligence from the chicken's brain

514
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:14,640
and took it along with the soul and then

515
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:16,799
the Soul re-entered into the chicken's

516
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,740
physical body with the intelligence of

517
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:23,340
what was in the brain meaning eat

518
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:25,260
Peck around the yard live

519
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:28,260
its legs

520
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:32,299
the soul was propelling a chicken's body

521
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:32,299
with no brain no head

522
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:41,659
that is

523
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,659
Mike stayed alive

524
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:48,120
because by entering his body his soul

525
00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:51,659
gave strength of Will and brain

526
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:55,140
intelligence to the chicken's body

527
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:58,860

549
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,960

because that's how incredible souls are

551
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:10,820
Spirit of compassion says because the

552
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,820
soul was taking a chance

553
00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:16,919
a Gamble

554
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:20,059
that if it re-entered the physical body

555
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:20,059
of its CH of the chicken

556
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,440
that the owner of the chicken the farmer

557
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:27,539
might let it live

558
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,240
remember when a chicken's head is cut

559
00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:32,539
off the body's discarded and thrown in a

560
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,539
bin

561
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:39,200
this chicken's soul

562
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:39,200
took a chance

563
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:45,179
it's incredible

564
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:46,520

spiritual

702
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,140
is hearing a voice that gives incredible

703
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,520

704
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:33,840

707
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:40,399

718
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:07,620
be changes like we've never seen and

719
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:10,740

again neurons in the same emotional

728
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:31,019

back together and then

744
00:34:09,419 --> 00:34:13,040
the same breakup occurs

745
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:19,260
neurons in the same area of the

746
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,060
emotional center of the brain gets

747
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:24,060

00:34:24,419 --> 00:34:29,520
it's like an electrical shock treatment

750
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:30,960
to that central nervous system tissue so

751
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:34,760
that tissue in the central nervous

752
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,760
system is getting re-shocked over again

753
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:39,960
if the relationship continues on this

754
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:42,419
roller coaster

755
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:46,560

coaster ride relationships happen

757
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:50,599
with

758
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:50,599
it's like

759
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:54,960
[Music]

760
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:56,700
Neuroscience doesn't know any of this

761
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,740
information

762
00:34:56,700 --> 00:35:00,839
they don't

763
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:02,220
this this is a prime example of how

764
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:03,480
science keeps on stealing this

765
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:05,580
information

766
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,900
I've been saying for years and

767
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:08,339
Neuroscience doesn't have any of these

768
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:10,980
details about any of this I've been

769
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:12,540
saying for years it's in possible to

770
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:14,460
survive on a ketogenic diet because

771
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:16,380
there's no way to keep sugar away from

772
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:17,339
the brain and survive and have the brain

773
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,839
survive

774
00:35:17,339 --> 00:35:20,640
and I talked about how people's

775
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:22,320
ketogenic diets aren't real ketogenic

776
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,880
diets because there's always is some

777
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,740
form of sugar in their ketogenic diet

778
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:28,020
keeping the brain alive enough

779
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:29,640
and then now scientists are so-called

780
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:31,619
stealing the information from all the

781
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:33,780
medical meaning books and lectures and

782
00:35:31,619 --> 00:35:36,599
now they're saying it's impossible to be

783
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:37,800
ketogenic science but there's no study

784
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:40,020
there's no anything they even say

785
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:42,660
there's no study but they just take mm

786
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:45,240
info it's we see it every day by the way

787
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:48,359
like the medical Beam Team sees it every

788
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:50,640
single day it is unbelievable and you

789
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:53,240
guys see it every single day it's just

790
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,240
foreign

791
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:00,119
ER sees it every day it's just it's

792
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:02,660
insane it's like insanity

793
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:02,660
okay

794
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:09,359
sorry to go off the beaten path a little

795
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:10,560
bit you guys I apologize

796
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:13,740
all right

797
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:15,240
so we're on that roller coaster ride

798
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:17,460
okay I just want to say one other thing

799
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:20,339
remember a scientist is just a human who

800
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:22,079
can write down hypotheses

801
00:36:20,339 --> 00:36:23,400
to try to study

802
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,720
but where do they get all their

803
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,940
hypotheses

804
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:29,460
is it where do they come up with it they

805
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:31,500
come up with it themselves no they don't

806
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:33,660
they steal

807
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:36,740
a scientist is a thief

808
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:36,740
stealing an idea

809
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:40,619
and then working with that idea but

810
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,119
stealing that idea that's how insane

811
00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:45,240
that is

812
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:47,040
that's a fact of how it works in science

813
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:49,980
so they can try to experiment and

814
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:51,720
observe on the idea they stole

815
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:53,760
it's well known in history that's what

816
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:55,380
it is scientists are just thieves

817
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:59,520
they still

818
00:36:55,380 --> 00:37:01,260
oh don't get me wrong lab technicians

819
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,000
are working on an idea they don't know

820
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:06,260
what's stolen

821
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,260
by the head scientists

822
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:12,839
when okay so if the relationship

823
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:15,180
continues on a roller coaster of making

824
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:17,700
up followed by turmoil again and

825
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:20,280
breaking up making up breaking up making

826
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:22,740
up breaking up it's highs and lows we're

827
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:25,619
made up again it's all good we had

828
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:27,839
makeup time and now boom lose it's

829
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:30,240
breakup time a month later it's makeup

830
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:31,800
time a month later it's breakup time we

831
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,900
could be friendships could be intimate

865
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:49,200
going wrong with the brain because you

00:38:47,339 --> 00:38:52,440
were making up breaking up all of it

867
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:54,660

you get what Olga says I felt extremely

875
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:15,960
exhausted

876
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:17,880
it's exhausting to the brain

877
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,980
if the relationship continues on this

878
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:22,200
roller coaster of making up followed by

879
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:24,780
turmoil again emotional wounds will keep

880
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:26,640
hitting in the same emotional centers so

881
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:29,520
what's happening is

882
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:31,619
it's injuries to the same emotional

883
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:36,200
center of the brain over and over again

884
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:36,200
make a break of high low high low

885
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:42,599
Hannah says that ex you experience it

886
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:44,640
with your dad

887
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:47,060
Tina says my brain felt crazy when it

888
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,060
was happening

889
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:52,680
Lana says I feel like my brain is being

890
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:55,500
fried fried

891
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:57,300
absolutely electricity is going to the

892
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:59,760
same area of the emotional center of the

893
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:01,079
brain and hitting it

894
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,839
and that's what's happening like

895
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:06,240
electrical shock treatment

896
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:08,099
they can't find this information anymore

897
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:11,579
I must be a genius

898
00:40:08,099 --> 00:40:15,240
since I can't be talking to any voice I

899
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:18,240
can't be hearing a voice since age four

900
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:20,220
been a genius then

901
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:21,839
the details in this in these books are

902
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:25,740
just incredible

903
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:26,940
I must be a unbelievable phenomenon of a

904
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:29,099
genius

905
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:31,940
because certainly I can't be talking to

906
00:40:29,099 --> 00:40:31,940
a voice up above

907
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:38,820
because I saw someone say something I

908
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,500
saw a comment go up

909
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:43,400
that's why I'm just talking about that

910
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,400
right now that's all

911
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:53,760
during the most traumatic moments on the

912
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:55,880
roller coaster the soul is outside of

913
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:59,160
the body watching and waiting as things

914
00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:01,320
subside so come back here is the most

915
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:03,240
profound piece of this information right

916
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:05,640
here prepare yourselves for this I just

917
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:09,920
said it but I'll I'll just

918
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:11,700
I'll just add a little to it okay

919
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:15,359
most

920
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:17,880
profound piece of information right here

921
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:20,460
about this

922
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:23,400
during the moment of this roller coaster

923
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:25,920
ride you guys during the most traumatic

924
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:28,320
moments of this roller coaster ride the

925
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,359
up and down the makeups the breakups all

926
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:32,280
of that with relationships during the

927
00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:36,500
most traumatic moments on this roller

928
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:40,440
coaster the soul is outside of the body

929
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:44,660
watching watching and waiting for things

930
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:44,660
to subside so it can come back

931
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:51,660
the soul is outside of the body

932
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:55,560
the soul

933
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:57,839
is outside of the body watching as the

934
00:41:55,560 --> 00:42:00,420
events are unfolding in that traumatic

935
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:03,240
event and it's waiting to come back

936
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:06,619
because the soul has

937
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:06,619
a safe fault

938
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:12,200
so that the soul doesn't get completely

939
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:12,200
damaged

940
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:17,660
by other experiences on this planet

941
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:23,640
so as things get really chaotic and

942
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:26,099
really problematic the soul

943
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:27,660
projects out of the brain out of the

944
00:42:26,099 --> 00:42:29,520
body

945
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:34,619
and awaits

946
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:37,859
for things to cool down and calm down

947
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:42,980
in that relationship before it comes

948
00:42:37,859 --> 00:42:42,980
back in and enters inside the brain

949
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,720
when a pattern like this develops

950
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:59,520
neurotransmitter hormones in the

951
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:01,920
emotional centers of the brain start to

952
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:04,220
gather information that another shock

953
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,760
could be coming

954
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:07,880
adaptive

955
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:12,200
adaptive

956
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:12,200
neurotransmitter midter chemicals

957
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:21,200
neurotransmitter chemicals are actually

958
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:21,200
recording taking in information

959
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:26,040
neurotransmitter hormones in the

960
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:28,020
emotional centers of the brain start to

961
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:30,900
gather information at another shock

962
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:32,819
could be coming on its way break up

963
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:34,680
makeup breakup makeup and now

964
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:36,359
neurotransmitter chemicals are like holy

965
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:40,700
crap this is getting out of control

966
00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:40,700
there might be another shock on its way

967
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:52,680
this can make a person hypersensitive

968
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:55,140
and then you become sensitive sensitive

969
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:57,000
like oh my God I can't handle this

970
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:59,640
anymore I can't take another up and down

971
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,680
I can't take another breakup makeup I

972
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:03,240
can't take another lie I can't take

973
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:06,300
another cheat I can't take another

974
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:08,160
betrayal I can't take another Insanity I

975
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:10,440
can't take anything I can't take it

976
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:12,540
anymore I become hypersensitive those

977
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:13,980
are neurotransmitter chemicals hormones

978
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:17,660
inside the brain neurotransmitter

979
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:20,520
hormones that are actually deciphering

980
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:22,500
collecting information inside your brain

981
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:24,480
and now you're becoming sensitive as a

982
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:27,540
person

983
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:29,880
Romina says Anthony

984
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:32,180
oh the comment's gone when it goes up it

985
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,180
goes up

986
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:40,500
this can make a person hypersensitive

987
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,180
allergic

988
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:50,460
to the coming of the next breakup fight

989
00:44:47,819 --> 00:44:52,920
or cheat causing additional emotional

990
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:54,960
responses and additional emotional pain

991
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:56,760
now you're sensitive you're sensitive

992
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,900
for the next sheet for the next breakup

993
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:59,900
for the next fight

994
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,040
foreign

995
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:09,980
causing additional responses and

996
00:45:06,599 --> 00:45:09,980
additional emotional pain

997
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:15,960
that allergic response varies in

998
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:19,079
severity depending on how much the brain

999
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:20,940
is lacking in its nutritional needs and

1000
00:45:19,079 --> 00:45:23,520
what the soul and physical brain both

1001
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:26,220
remember from past trust issues and

1002
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:28,260
other breakups the allergic response you

1003
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:33,540
get I'm allergic

1004
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:36,060
I am allergic to another breakup makeup

1005
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:38,520
another confrontation

1006
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:43,380
another problem

1007
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:45,480
with this person or people I am allergic

1008
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:47,160
that allergic response varies in

1009
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:48,720
severity depending on how much the brain

1010
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:50,579
is lacking so now if our brain is

1011
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:52,859
missing things if our brain doesn't have

1012
00:45:50,579 --> 00:45:55,859
enough B12 if our brain doesn't have

1013
00:45:52,859 --> 00:45:58,560
enough zinc if our brain doesn't have

1014
00:45:55,859 --> 00:46:00,839
enough things it needs enough you know

1015
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:04,520
vitamin C if our brain doesn't have

1016
00:46:00,839 --> 00:46:04,520
enough of what it needs

1017
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:08,240
we can be in trouble

1018
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,040
these old wounds are a big part of how

1019
00:46:14,579 --> 00:46:18,839
allergic you get in the present

1020
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:20,460
because again when we talk about

1021
00:46:18,839 --> 00:46:22,140
emotional wounds we're talking about

1022
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:24,060
physical wounds to the brain tissue

1023
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:26,280
These Old Wounds can physically tear

1024
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:28,560
open again and again and again with a

1025
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:32,040
fresh emotional injury so as you start

1026
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:34,440
to mend physically in the brain and your

1027
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:36,240
soul projects out when you're in trauma

1028
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:38,099
and your soul comes back to your brain

1029
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:41,180
when you're not in trauma and you're so

1030
00:46:38,099 --> 00:46:41,180
your brain is mending

1031
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:44,819
then we get sensitive when something

1032
00:46:43,319 --> 00:46:47,460
happens again it's like I can't do

1033
00:46:44,819 --> 00:46:51,500
another relationship I can't take a risk

1034
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:51,500
I can't do another thing

1035
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:56,420
I'm scared

1036
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:01,560
this isn't someone being over emotional

1037
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:03,780
this is a person experiencing a physical

1038
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:05,940
brain response to repeated emotional and

1039
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:07,500
physical brain injuries

1040
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:09,720
Tara Appleman says the detail and

1041
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:12,599
Clarity of this info never fails to blow

1042
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:15,900
me away I'm honored

1043
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:18,000
thank you for being here

1044
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:19,740
injured neurons in the emotional centers

1045
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,780
of the brain are receiving messages from

1046
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:24,480
neurotransmitter hormone chemicals as

1047
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:27,480
they try to send forewarning in hopes of

1048
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:30,300
stopping the situation our own brain is

1049
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:32,579
trying to stop the situation when we're

1050
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:34,200
being yelled at when we're having a hard

1051
00:47:32,579 --> 00:47:37,280
time when we're going through some kind

1052
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:37,280
of emotional turmoil

1053
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:41,900
Collide spring says this is why I live

1054
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:41,900
with cats

1055
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:48,900
that's when a person learns their

1056
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:51,240
tolerance levels like their tolerance

1057
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:52,319
levels right that's when a person learns

1058
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:53,700
that

1059
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:56,819
foreign

1060
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:58,680
my throat's dry right now

1061
00:47:56,819 --> 00:48:00,859
some talking so much if you guys don't

1062
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:00,859
mind

1063
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:08,880
that's when a person learns your

1064
00:48:07,319 --> 00:48:11,280
tolerance level an allergic reaction

1065
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:13,140
escalates and Peaks to a point where you

1066
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:16,200
feel if you don't change your course in

1067
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:17,880
that moment some serious damage is going

1068
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:19,980
to occur some serious shit's going to go

1069
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:23,160
down

1070
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:25,319
where something's going to go terribly

1071
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:27,839
wrong if the course doesn't change

1072
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:30,480
something a switch gets if there's a

1073
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:32,640
switch in there a wire

1074
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:34,980
you're at your limit

1075
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:36,780
you become so allergic that you feel if

1076
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:40,680
you stay in the game you're going to get

1077
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:44,480
hurt past the point of no return

1078
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:44,480
that's information just blows my mind

1079
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:49,440
when this happens

1080
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:51,740
someone may leave the relationship for

1081
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,740
good

1082
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:58,319
if they even have the option

1083
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:59,720
before too much damage has been done in

1084
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:03,240
the emotional centers of the brain

1085
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:05,160
McAllister cauterized tissue and before

1086
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:08,760

00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:21,740
chapter the chapter itself is packed

1092
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:21,740

00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:25,619
not being able to heal

1130
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:28,500
it's important information

1131
00:51:25,619 --> 00:51:29,640
like even when it comes down to it to

1132
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:31,500

1134
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:36,839

we're making the relationship stabilizer

1149
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:15,119

1150
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:19,520
bit about it if I haven't

1151
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:19,520

1152
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:25,559
here we go relationship breakup

1153
00:52:22,859 --> 00:52:28,280

1154
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:28,280

1155
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:32,700
and also emotional therapy and spiritual

1156
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:35,160
World

1157
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:37,260
Etc don't know is it's a physical injury

1158
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:39,119
happening in the brain and you need the

1159
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:42,599
right tools

1160
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:44,339
and how to apply them and how to protect

1161
00:52:42,599 --> 00:52:46,020
ourselves and heal our brains and that's

1162
00:52:44,339 --> 00:52:47,880
something where science research doesn't

1163
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:49,619
know this and therapists don't know this

1164
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:51,540
that actual physical injuries are

1165
00:52:49,619 --> 00:52:53,280
happening in the brain too and I talk

1166
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:55,980
about that in the brain saver book so

1167
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:57,599

through any kind of relationship turmoil

1170
00:53:01,079 --> 00:53:04,980
whether or not it's reached a point of

1171
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:06,300
actual breakup or dismantling of a

1172
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:08,760
partnership so what I'm trying to say is

1173
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:11,700
you use this while things are not going

1174
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:15,839
that bad either it's helpful

1175
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:18,960
Stacy Hyland says mm has healed me a lot

1176
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:21,240
but physical healing is nothing compared

1177
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:24,140
to the emotional healing that I've had

1178
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:24,140
that's incredible

1179
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:28,200
try this brain shot if you're going

1180
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:29,400

did you hear that you guys like just

1182
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:34,680
turmoil that's it not even like a

1183
00:53:31,559 --> 00:53:36,599
breakup with anybody any anybody whether

1184
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:39,359
or not it's reached the point of actual

1185
00:53:36,599 --> 00:53:41,460
breakup or dismantling a partnership

1186
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:45,240
try this brain shot if you're having

1187
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:46,619
arguments fights or disagreements in any

1188
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:48,660
kind of relationship even if you're

1189
00:53:46,619 --> 00:53:51,660
having disagreements this is a

1190
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:53,700
supportive shot for disagreements and

1191
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:55,200

1192
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:56,880
breakups

1193
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:58,079
relationships they've watched or said

1194
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:00,000
backwards

1195
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:02,280
triple layer Guida says this makes sense

1196
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:05,700
many people feel they need to go out and

1197
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:09,059
Shrink but they drink a bunch of spirits

1198
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:11,940
so a drink that's stabilizer you you

1199
00:54:09,059 --> 00:54:14,040
call makes sense

1200
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:17,339
foreign

1201
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:19,440
you feel there is no resolution to a

1202
00:54:17,339 --> 00:54:21,059
situation or that there are unresolved

1203
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:23,160
issues with friends and family so if you

1204
00:54:21,059 --> 00:54:25,619

00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:29,040

1312
00:59:40,619 --> 00:59:44,420
let me get some parsley down in here

1313
00:59:55,200 --> 01:00:00,740
so I'm putting a half cup tightly packed

1314
00:59:57,660 --> 01:00:00,740
parsley in here

1315
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:10,940
we go

1316
01:00:12,599 --> 01:00:17,220
foreign

1317
01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:17,220
good

1318
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:21,660
what else half cup roughly chopped

1319
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:24,980
lettuce

1320
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:24,980
get some lettuce in here

1321
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:29,660
excited about this

1322
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:51,299
and another one you guys what I love

1323
01:00:48,599 --> 01:00:53,520
about this one is that actually because

1324
01:00:51,299 --> 01:00:55,799
the brain shot therapies don't always

1325
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:58,559
taste good right because they weren't

1326
01:00:55,799 --> 01:01:01,500
designed to actually taste good but when

1327
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:03,839
one tastes good it's like a few do you

1328
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:06,059
know when one has a good flavor it's

1329
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:07,799
just it's just really you know great all

1330
01:01:06,059 --> 01:01:10,680
right and then we got half stock of

1331
01:01:07,799 --> 01:01:13,760
celery going in here it's a small stick

1332
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:13,760
let's run that one in

1333
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:20,280
there we go

1334
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:22,500
now what you'll notice with the MN 1500

1335
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:24,720
or 900

1336
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:27,599
this is coming out dry

1337
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:30,000
the pulp is

1338
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:31,260
much drier it's not wet sloppy pulp and

1339
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,720
that's where you save money and food

1340
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:35,700
costs are rising

1341
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:39,299
and what I love about the 1500 and the

1342
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:40,740
900 it saves money and food costs so you

1343
01:01:39,299 --> 01:01:43,559
can do your medicine have your medicine

1344
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:44,280
maker going and you actually are saving

1345
01:01:43,559 --> 01:01:46,640
money

1346
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:49,500
with food cost which is really important

1347
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:51,180
juicers just spit out everything juicing

1348
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:53,520
all goes in on the pulp and it's like

1349
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:56,579
you can run with other juicers so much

1350
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:58,920
produce through you'd have to be like

1351
01:01:56,579 --> 01:02:00,480
it's unbelievable how much so what you

1352
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:02,720
do is you want to rub this through your

1353
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:02,720
screen

1354
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:06,900
because this is a very very sticky kind

1355
01:02:05,819 --> 01:02:08,099
of juice

1356
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:10,319
okay

1357
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:11,880
so what you see

1358
01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:13,920
that's the kind of Pulp we're talking

1359
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:15,780
about it's dry

1360
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:18,299
right

1361
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:21,180
incredible and it's tomatoes and

1362
01:02:18,299 --> 01:02:23,160
strawberries and there's no way juicers

1363
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:25,319
can juice strawberries and make them

1364
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:27,900
come out that dry it's not possible

1365
01:02:25,319 --> 01:02:31,339
which is just it's an incredible machine

1366
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:31,339
all right so what I'm doing is

1367
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:38,059
I'm just rubbing the screen so it goes

1368
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:38,059
on down through

1369
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:43,859
if you have fresh strawberries you could

1370
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:47,099
use that in this one too I had frozen

1371
01:02:43,859 --> 01:02:49,200
strawberries is all I had there we go

1372
01:02:47,099 --> 01:02:51,820
right

1373
01:02:49,200 --> 01:03:02,949

1498
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:14,839
um

1499
01:09:14,940 --> 01:09:19,739
Dr Nesbitt says he loves Beatrice

1500
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:21,480
well that's that be sure she's here

1501
01:09:19,739 --> 01:09:25,080
doctor

1502
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:26,520
says that's not entirely true either

1503
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:29,279
because

1504
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:31,440
Dr Nesbitt did not take Beatrice to a

1505
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:33,839
function a dinner

1506
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:36,080
where all the medical doctors went and

1507
01:09:33,839 --> 01:09:39,060
they were eating steak

1508
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:42,000
Beatrice like steak

1509
01:09:39,060 --> 01:09:44,580
um she likes it medium well done and she

1510
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:47,819
did not get invited to the gala to the

1511
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:50,279
medical Gala Dr Nesbitt says that

1512
01:09:47,819 --> 01:09:52,679
he does like his steak and he likes to

1513
01:09:50,279 --> 01:09:54,780
eat that in peace without Beatrice so he

1514
01:09:52,679 --> 01:09:57,060
didn't want to invite her you guys are

1515
01:09:54,780 --> 01:09:58,980
you guys I don't know how to fix this I

1516
01:09:57,060 --> 01:10:00,060
have no idea what to do

1517
01:09:58,980 --> 01:10:02,580
um

1518
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:06,140
Okay so

1519
01:10:02,580 --> 01:10:06,140
the Beatrice

1520
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:09,260
oh beard

1521
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:17,540
okay listen you guys Beatrice you said

1522
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:17,540
that her mother-in-law

1523
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:23,760
um happens to be fond of Dr Nesbitt

1524
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:24,960
but thinks Beatrice could have done a

1525
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:28,800
lot better

1526
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:31,520
Beatrice met Dr Nesbitt

1527
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:31,520
in college

1528
01:10:33,179 --> 01:10:36,960
um

1529
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:39,719
but there was another chicken doctor she

1530
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:43,080
wanted to be with and wanted to marry

1531
01:10:39,719 --> 01:10:45,600
and um and so her argument with her

1532
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:49,080
mother is that Dr Nesbitt is not a good

1533
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:51,360
doctor what are you agreeing

1534
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:53,460
Dr Nesbitt said she knows of that

1535
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:55,920
chicken doctor and he was a

1536
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:58,980
he was a dysfunctional guy

1537
01:10:55,920 --> 01:11:00,960
and wasn't going to make a good surgeon

1538
01:10:58,980 --> 01:11:03,140
Dr espet said that Beatrice should be

1539
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:06,060
lucky to have

1540
01:11:03,140 --> 01:11:08,400
Dr Nesbitt

1541
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:11,520
okay I you guys I can't do this all day

1542
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:15,000
