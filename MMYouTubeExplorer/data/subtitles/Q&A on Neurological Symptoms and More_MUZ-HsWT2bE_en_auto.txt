[131.68 - 135.44] medical meeting podcast at apple podcast
[133.68 - 138.00] link is in the description
[135.44 - 139.28] blood draw bloodletting and vampirism
[138.00 - 141.60] right i'm going to talk about lyme
[139.28 - 143.20] disease as well today
[141.60 - 145.84] i think lyme disease i'm also going to
[143.20 - 149.68] talk about neurological symptoms tingles
[145.84 - 151.92] fatigue numbness vertigo burning skin
[149.68 - 153.60] aches and pains neck pain back pain what
[151.92 - 155.04] i'm doing is i'm peeling the potatoes a
[153.60 - 157.44] little bit
[155.04 - 159.12] okay so that's what i'm doing i'm making
[157.44 - 162.08] the potato cauliflower
[159.12 - 163.68] mash it's not about how do we how to not
[162.08 - 165.60] getting blood work i want you guys to
[163.68 - 167.04] get blood work you guys got good doctors
[165.60 - 168.96] you go to your doctor
[167.04 - 171.44] but i talk all about how to do it to
[168.96 - 172.96] protect yourself it's critical actually
[171.44 - 174.56] because they're taking too much blood
[172.96 - 176.72] from everybody that's what they do
[174.56 - 178.72] and you know what when you're sick i
[176.72 - 179.44] mean it can take you down a real wrong
[178.72 - 181.68] direction
[179.44 - 183.68] and really hurt a lot of people it has
[181.68 - 185.12] it's actually killed a lot of people too
[183.68 - 186.56] because they stay chronically ill
[185.12 - 188.00] chronically ill and they get drained and
[186.56 - 190.48] guess what the worst part
[188.00 - 191.68] about the blood draw is the one of the
[190.48 - 194.08] worst parts
[191.68 - 195.44] is deficiencies they take from you then
[194.08 - 196.72] they take from you more and you get a
[195.44 - 198.00] deficiency now you're getting more
[196.72 - 200.00] deficiencies you can get
[198.00 - 201.52] deficient from all that blood work this
[200.00 - 204.56] is so scary
[201.52 - 205.84] um gene why don't you use
[204.56 - 207.52] why don't you use the potato i always
[205.84 - 208.16] use potato skins it's just that this
[207.52 - 210.40] recipe
[208.16 - 212.80] is a different recipe it's the potato
[210.40 - 214.08] cauliflower mash and i'm not using the
[212.80 - 216.40] skins i'll show you the recipe in a
[214.08 - 217.76] second so i got some water steaming a
[216.40 - 218.48] little bit in the pan right here you
[217.76 - 220.64] guys
[218.48 - 221.52] and i'm just just taking some skins off
[220.64 - 224.72] real quick
[221.52 - 227.44] right we're almost there and
[224.72 - 228.24] i'll show you how how we do this so
[227.44 - 232.32] there we go
[228.24 - 234.08] it's another potato got that
[232.32 - 235.60] got some cauliflower too it's potato
[234.08 - 237.84] cauliflower mash
[235.60 - 241.20] you know it's it's friday it's a great
[237.84 - 243.44] day for this tara galloway amazing
[241.20 - 245.28] podcast love it incredible did you
[243.44 - 247.36] share it with anybody to help protect
[245.28 - 250.80] them so they have the information
[247.36 - 252.48] elena when i go fat free i feel fatigue
[250.80 - 253.68] are you getting enough calories number
[252.48 - 254.88] one first of all there's a couple of
[253.68 - 256.80] reasons for that
[254.88 - 257.92] when you're doing the fats it stimulates
[256.80 - 261.12] adrenaline
[257.92 - 261.84] so um fats cause the adrenals to
[261.12 - 264.72] actually
[261.84 - 266.32] flood so what happens is there you can
[264.72 - 267.52] actually get addicted to fats you can
[266.32 - 271.52] get addicted to
[267.52 - 272.84] oils and avocados and nut butters and um
[271.52 - 274.72] and you can get addicted to
[272.84 - 277.68] cheeseburgers
[274.72 - 278.96] and because the reason why an ice cream
[277.68 - 280.72] because fats
[278.96 - 282.40] they make the adrenals run because your
[280.72 - 283.44] adrenals are trying to thin out your
[282.40 - 284.96] blood
[283.44 - 286.48] so that your heart doesn't have to deal
[284.96 - 287.68] with all that fat in your bloodstream
[286.48 - 290.24] right so the minute
[287.68 - 292.00] you take away those fats your adrenals
[290.24 - 292.96] you save your adrenals but here's what's
[292.00 - 294.48] gonna happen
[292.96 - 296.00] you're gonna get your adrenals nice and
[294.48 - 297.44] strong any day you're fat
[296.00 - 299.92] free you're going to get your adrenals
[297.44 - 301.68] nice and strong to the point where your
[299.92 - 302.72] adrenals are finally better and there is
[301.68 - 305.52] no fatigue
[302.72 - 306.40] another thing too is did you ever feel
[305.52 - 308.88] fatigued before
[306.40 - 310.40] is that this the first time it's like or
[308.88 - 312.32] is fatigue one of your symptoms you've
[310.40 - 314.00] been dealing with all this time right
[312.32 - 315.76] so think about that trying to be your
[314.00 - 317.28] own detective right there so i'm peeling
[315.76 - 319.76] these potatoes you guys
[317.28 - 320.96] um keep your you know keep your fats a
[319.76 - 322.72] little low if you want
[320.96 - 324.24] on the lower side you can do some great
[322.72 - 325.28] healing but make sure you get enough
[324.24 - 327.28] calories though
[325.28 - 329.20] if you take away fats because fats are
[327.28 - 330.80] so high in calorie
[329.20 - 333.20] that's another reason why you might feel
[330.80 - 335.44] some fatigue you take fats away
[333.20 - 336.72] they're so high in calories it's why
[335.44 - 339.36] everybody gets fat
[336.72 - 341.44] they get stagnant sluggish livers and
[339.36 - 343.44] they gain all this weight from fat
[341.44 - 345.20] fat all the fat they're eating right
[343.44 - 347.04] once you take that away you better have
[345.20 - 348.24] some calories are you doing enough fruit
[347.04 - 350.16] are you
[348.24 - 352.00] you're also getting fat from every food
[350.16 - 353.92] i mean fats are in every
[352.00 - 356.16] single food anyway but those are just
[353.92 - 357.44] more radical fats more radical fats when
[356.16 - 358.96] you're doing too many of those so let's
[357.44 - 363.68] do this
[358.96 - 365.84] so i got a pan going right now
[363.68 - 366.88] so i'm going to steam some potatoes i'm
[365.84 - 369.04] going to steam these up for the
[366.88 - 370.88] cauliflower mash
[369.04 - 373.68] it's what we're doing cutting them in
[370.88 - 373.68] little pieces here
[374.00 - 379.44] rosie says i have i have lime
[377.04 - 380.96] time four times i had lime four times
[379.44 - 383.28] and i've had vertigo and
[380.96 - 384.56] ra so here's how it works with
[383.28 - 386.88] rheumatoid arthritis
[384.56 - 388.64] that's caused by epstein-barr i talk
[386.88 - 391.20] about that in medical medium books
[388.64 - 392.96] vertigo is caused by epstein-barr okay
[391.20 - 394.08] lyme disease is caused by epstein-barr
[392.96 - 396.56] you see how it works
[394.08 - 397.28] lyme disease is just an inflammation
[396.56 - 399.60] marker
[397.28 - 401.36] they don't actually find your lyme
[399.60 - 403.76] bacteria
[401.36 - 405.12] they just they're testing for
[403.76 - 406.80] inflammation
[405.12 - 409.12] and then they place the name of the
[406.80 - 412.96] bacteria on the test
[409.12 - 415.60] it's criminal but that's what they do
[412.96 - 417.12] so what happens is but your real
[415.60 - 420.08] symptoms are epstein-barr
[417.12 - 421.76] i talk about in the book new edition do
[420.08 - 423.04] you have the new edition medical medium
[421.76 - 424.08] new edition the one that i was just
[423.04 - 425.92] showing earlier
[424.08 - 427.68] so you can actually learn all about your
[425.92 - 430.48] lyme disease and how to heal

[461.68 - 466.96] here too you guys
[463.04 - 468.56] place it in here get this going
[466.96 - 470.24] so i'm steaming cauliflower and some
[468.56 - 471.68] potato talking about blood draw talking
[470.24 - 472.56] about lyme disease and neurological
[471.68 - 476.64] symptoms
[472.56 - 478.48] season interesting neurological symptoms
[476.64 - 480.08] are all caused by the epstein-barr virus
[478.48 - 482.80] and the shingles virus right
[480.08 - 483.60] okay think about this okay and what
[482.80 - 485.68] happens is
[483.60 - 486.96] you get all the vertigo and you get all
[485.68 - 489.28] the vagus nerve stuff
[486.96 - 491.28] and you can get some anxiety too and
[489.28 - 493.36] tingles and numbness on your body and
[491.28 - 495.04] tinnitus and all this stuff right and
[493.36 - 496.48] then you go to a lyme doctor they'll
[495.04 - 498.00] just say you got lyme disease i'll tell
[496.48 - 499.20] you one thing about lime and we'll talk
[498.00 - 501.04] about in a minute
[499.20 - 503.52] about how it works so okay this is
[501.04 - 507.12] getting steamed up
[503.52 - 510.80] get the lid back on
[507.12 - 513.20] get that cooking cauliflower potato hash
[510.80 - 513.92] got five potatoes in there so that's
[513.20 - 516.16] good
[513.92 - 516.16] um
[519.44 - 523.76] all right so i got some potatoes in here
[522.08 - 525.84] steaming up good
[523.76 - 529.36] um maybe i'll throw one more little one
[525.84 - 530.80] in here why that that's getting hot
[529.36 - 532.84] jane robinson what treatment do you
[530.80 - 537.60] suggest for
[532.84 - 540.40] uh him necrosis my friend gets one pint
[537.60 - 542.40] of blood drawn every month and i'm now
[540.40 - 544.40] realizing that doesn't sound good after
[542.40 - 548.08] listening to you
[544.40 - 549.28] well look that's a viral issue so what
[548.08 - 552.56] happens is
[549.28 - 556.80] um when viruses
[552.56 - 559.28] um when viruses uh get into the spleen
[556.80 - 560.96] okay and they get into the liver and
[559.28 - 563.12] they even get into the bone
[560.96 - 564.96] marrow when viruses get in in there we
[563.12 - 566.56] can get that condition
[564.96 - 568.48] and then what they do is they try to you
[566.56 - 570.16] know they drain a pint
[568.48 - 571.92] continuously to try to deal with it but
[570.16 - 573.20] all the deficiencies happen all these
[571.92 - 575.44] other things so
[573.20 - 577.20] it's a matter of like how do we also
[575.44 - 578.96] help with the deficiencies how do we go
[577.20 - 579.76] after the viral issue and get that
[578.96 - 583.60] better so
[579.76 - 585.36] we get better and um and that's that's a
[583.60 - 587.12] big part of it there it's about
[585.36 - 588.72] going after the real problem that's a
[587.12 - 591.68] band-aid you know they try to
[588.72 - 594.00] keep things in check by doing that but i
[591.68 - 595.76] mean look
[594.00 - 597.36] the doctor knows best for what's going
[595.76 - 598.08] on right there but what i would
[597.36 - 600.40] recommend
[598.08 - 602.16] if it was a family member or a friend of
[600.40 - 603.52] mine if it was happening to me
[602.16 - 605.36] it was happening to me i'd be getting
[603.52 - 607.76] the books i'd be learning about the
[605.36 - 609.76] viral conditions and then once you start
[607.76 - 611.44] eating the right foods for the for the
[609.76 - 613.76] viral issues once you start taking the
[611.44 - 616.16] right supplements for the viral issues
[613.76 - 618.24] then all of a sudden that starts getting
[616.16 - 619.20] better and better and better and then
[618.24 - 620.72] when it gets better
[619.20 - 622.32] then they don't have to drain the pint
[620.72 - 625.76] during the pint train the pipe
[622.32 - 627.28] pine you know so anyway here is potato
[625.76 - 629.28] cauliflower
[627.28 - 630.72] mash right here that's what i'm making i
[629.28 - 632.80] don't know if you guys can see it
[630.72 - 634.24] so i'm excited this is medical medium
[632.80 - 636.40] book one
[634.24 - 638.00] with all the lyme disease neurological
[636.40 - 641.04] symptoms and information
[638.00 - 644.40] so what you'll find out there is
[641.04 - 645.76] is people anybody can get diagnosed with
[644.40 - 647.36] lyme disease anybody just need a
[645.76 - 648.48] neurological symptom just go to a lyme

[666.64 - 670.96] side of my head i got a little pain here
[669.44 - 672.40] that comes and goes
[670.96 - 674.48] feel kind of fatigue you've got lyme
[672.40 - 676.48] disease you go into a lime doctor's
[674.48 - 677.92] office boom you leave with a lime stamp
[676.48 - 680.32] on your back
[677.92 - 681.20] seven ways to sundae got that lime stamp
[680.32 - 684.32] on your back
[681.20 - 686.96] that's how it works um so
[684.32 - 688.88] but really all those symptoms if you go
[686.96 - 689.52] into a multiple sclerosis doctor you'll
[688.88 - 692.32] get
[689.52 - 694.64] a mess tag most likely you go into just
[692.32 - 696.48] an autoimmune specialist
[694.64 - 697.68] right with autoimmune they'll say you
[696.48 - 700.72] got ra
[697.68 - 703.04] maybe they'll say you got something else
[700.72 - 704.48] right but they'll say you got something
[703.04 - 706.56] because they'll be like and they'll pick
[704.48 - 708.00] an autoimmune disease that you have
[706.56 - 710.16] it doesn't mean if the label is right or
[708.00 - 711.92] not maybe they'll just say autoimmune
[710.16 - 714.00] but any kind of neurological symptoms
[711.92 - 714.64] now you just get tagged autoimmune
[714.00 - 716.96] tagged
[714.64 - 717.68] you know multiple sclerosis tagged lupus
[716.96 - 720.64] tagged
[717.68 - 722.24] cf you know cfs tagged lyme disease but
[720.64 - 723.20] you go into a lime doctor's office boom
[722.24 - 726.16] you got lyme
[723.20 - 728.08] that's it you can go to 30 doctors and
[726.16 - 730.08] end up at a lyme doctor and you got lime
[728.08 - 731.84] you know lyme was this thing where
[730.08 - 734.56] we finally know what's wrong with
[731.84 - 735.36] everybody we figured it out we finally
[734.56 - 737.52] know
[735.36 - 739.52] we know why everybody's sick and that's
[737.52 - 741.68] what it's about it's like
[739.52 - 743.36] it's like we finally know it's wrong
[741.68 - 745.44] it's that tick right there
[743.36 - 746.88] that's what's wrong with everybody it's
[745.44 - 749.28] the tick it's the tick
[746.88 - 750.72] and you know so um you know and i want
[749.28 - 752.56] to read a little bit about lyme disease
[750.72 - 755.12] right here
[752.56 - 756.48] but that's that's that's how it works
[755.12 - 759.92] big blood draw
[756.48 - 762.80] lead to vitiligo uh leanne
[759.92 - 764.24] wow you had the big blood draws man you

[770.96 - 775.12] you're sicker and now you're sicker and

[814.40 - 819.60] or her it's okay what are blood draws
[818.08 - 821.52] christine
[819.60 - 822.96] blood draws are i'm getting a blood test
[821.52 - 824.16] at the doctor's office he's gonna take
[822.96 - 826.64] seven vials
[824.16 - 828.16] five vials ten vials fourteen vials if
[826.64 - 830.80] you're sick or got problems
[828.16 - 832.56] he's going to take blood right and i
[830.80 - 834.64] talk about in the podcast episode
[832.56 - 836.32] too much blood and it all gets thrown
[834.64 - 839.36] away why does it matter
[836.32 - 840.96] that's your immune system that's your
[839.36 - 843.52] immune system right there there's a
[840.96 - 844.16] white blood cell your cbc goes out the
[843.52 - 848.00] window
[844.16 - 850.56] okay and when you lose your white count
[848.00 - 851.36] now you get sicker and sicker and sicker
[850.56 - 853.92] you know
[851.36 - 854.72] and i'm noticing blood draws are causing
[853.92 - 857.12] problem
[854.72 - 858.40] problems with women that already dealing
[857.12 - 861.12] with immune
[858.40 - 861.60] problems they got symptoms issues they
[861.12 - 863.76] got
[861.60 - 865.92] maybe they got chronic eti's bladder
[863.76 - 868.40] infections interstitial cystitis
[865.92 - 870.32] maybe they got other issues chronic
[868.40 - 873.60] sinusitis migraines
[870.32 - 877.20] um uh weakness in limbs or just fatigue
[873.60 - 878.96] anxiety depression and the body's immune
[877.20 - 880.56] system is already under stress we're
[878.96 - 882.32] already under stress and then
[880.56 - 884.24] we get all this blood drawn when they
[882.32 - 884.72] don't have to draw that much they can
[884.24 - 886.64] draw
[884.72 - 888.08] half vials they can draw less and then
[886.64 - 889.44] separate the tests but you got to hear
[888.08 - 891.44] the podcast episode
[889.44 - 893.92] and then the immune system goes out the
[891.44 - 895.76] window out the window out the window
[893.92 - 897.04] your cvc goes out the window and then
[895.76 - 899.28] your bones have to
[897.04 - 901.36] go into overload and hopefully in three
[899.28 - 902.16] four weeks you get your immune system
[901.36 - 904.32] back
[902.16 - 905.84] by the time it comes back you're already
[904.32 - 907.44] not feeling that good so now you're
[905.84 - 908.96] going to another doctor and then they
[907.44 - 910.80] take blood again
[908.96 - 912.80] and then the vicious cycle keeps on
[910.80 - 914.24] going and going going
[912.80 - 916.64] unless it usually takes months to
[914.24 - 919.76] recover your blood back
[916.64 - 922.80] your bone marrow takes time to actually
[919.76 - 925.84] recover recover takes a long time
[922.80 - 926.48] so very important to know i'm reading
[925.84 - 928.32] the
[926.48 - 929.68] lyme disease book right here so i'm
[928.32 - 932.96] looking at it
[929.68 - 935.36] and lyme disease book medical medium
[932.96 - 937.76] new edition okay talking about lime in
[935.36 - 938.96] here i got potatoes cauliflower steaming
[937.76 - 939.92] we're talking about blood draws talking
[938.96 - 942.64] about lyme disease talking about
[939.92 - 945.04] neurological symptoms a little bit too
[942.64 - 946.80] laura says the bloodletting show wow
[945.04 - 949.36] that in chemtrails
[946.80 - 950.80] that chemtrail show so disturbing but
[949.36 - 953.60] grateful to know
[950.80 - 954.16] what can i do to help my son is on a
[953.60 - 956.88] regular
[954.16 - 957.84] blood draw schedule he believes it's
[956.88 - 960.00] necessary
[957.84 - 962.16] because doctor says so you can still be
[960.00 - 964.80] on a regular blood draw schedule
[962.16 - 965.28] absolutely great doctor do the blood
[964.80 - 969.28] work
[965.28 - 970.80] but will he learn what to ask the doctor
[969.28 - 973.28] because you can get your doctor to work
[970.80 - 974.40] with you on that instead of taking seven
[973.28 - 976.96] vials
[974.40 - 978.64] full vials maybe you can talk to the
[976.96 - 981.68] doctor and the doctor will take
[978.64 - 985.52] three and a half full vials or
[981.68 - 986.64] seven half vials so the podcast explains
[985.52 - 989.36] all about it
[986.64 - 991.12] um and no you lori you heard the podcast
[989.36 - 993.20] you totally get it
[991.12 - 994.56] well listen it's his doctor he just does
[993.20 - 996.00] what the doctor tells him
[994.56 - 997.84] you know listen to the doctor totally
[996.00 - 999.68] get it but if i
[997.84 - 1001.28] was getting regular blood draws which
[999.68 - 1004.56] i'm not but if i
[1001.28 - 1005.20] was that's what i would do i would i
[1004.56 - 1006.88] would
[1005.20 - 1009.28] you know listen i would definitely do
[1006.88 - 1010.80] what's in the the podcast myself
[1009.28 - 1013.76] personally
[1010.80 - 1016.08] so i i got the lyme disease chapter open
[1013.76 - 1017.60] you guys i got the book right here
[1016.08 - 1019.28] we're steaming up some food i'm going to
[1017.60 - 1022.72] make you a dish
[1019.28 - 1026.24] uh marie marie uh
[1022.72 - 1028.24] posa when i had tubal pregnancy
[1026.24 - 1029.44] i had to have blood draw every day
[1028.24 - 1031.44] that's what they do
[1029.44 - 1032.96] that's what they do they do that so
[1031.44 - 1034.48] we'll talk about pregnancy right now for
[1032.96 - 1039.84] a second
[1034.48 - 1039.84] so i want to talk about that
[1041.60 - 1045.76] so here you are a mommy and you got a
[1043.44 - 1049.84] baby
[1045.76 - 1049.84] right and
[1049.92 - 1053.12] you're getting your blood drawn every
[1051.28 - 1056.56] single day okay
[1053.12 - 1061.12] now if we're all supposed to be about
[1056.56 - 1062.48] energy um vibrations frequency
[1061.12 - 1065.52] frequencies
[1062.48 - 1068.56] um sensitivities
[1065.52 - 1072.16] if we're also worried about
[1068.56 - 1073.04] subtle energies different variables in
[1072.16 - 1077.12] life
[1073.04 - 1080.08] and blood is being drawn from mommy
[1077.12 - 1081.52] continuously or even partially just
[1080.08 - 1082.32] maybe sometimes right when you're
[1081.52 - 1085.28] pregnant
[1082.32 - 1087.68] and i have known a lot of pregnant women
[1085.28 - 1092.00] that get a lot of blood drawn
[1087.68 - 1093.36] a lot and what happens is that no one
[1092.00 - 1096.48] realizes
[1093.36 - 1099.44] but it's stressful on the baby
[1096.48 - 1102.64] okay because the baby can sense
[1099.44 - 1106.48] everything that's happening inside mommy
[1102.64 - 1109.44] everything every word mommy says okay
[1106.48 - 1110.08] everything mommy does everything daddy
[1109.44 - 1112.96] does
[1110.08 - 1114.96] all right the baby picks up on voices
[1112.96 - 1117.28] the baby picks up on energy
[1114.96 - 1119.04] the baby picks up on stress so if mom is
[1117.28 - 1121.36] stressed out
[1119.04 - 1123.44] the baby picks up on it so when mom gets
[1121.36 - 1126.64] a needle jammed in her
[1123.44 - 1127.92] and mom's adrenals are flooding they're
[1126.64 - 1130.16] just like
[1127.92 - 1132.16] because you got the needle the baby
[1130.16 - 1133.76] picks up on all that adrenaline surge
[1132.16 - 1135.60] that adrenaline surge
[1133.76 - 1136.80] if mom's in a bad mood and had a really
[1135.60 - 1139.12] bad day
[1136.80 - 1140.72] or there's a disagreement somewhere
[1139.12 - 1142.96] something's happening
[1140.72 - 1145.60] confrontation the baby's gonna pick that
[1142.96 - 1147.76] up all that energy right
[1145.60 - 1149.36] so what happens is with the blood draw
[1147.76 - 1150.32] they take way too much blood from
[1149.36 - 1152.48] pregnant women
[1150.32 - 1154.64] they think pregnant women have plenty to
[1152.48 - 1156.96] spare lots more blood
[1154.64 - 1158.24] and lots of spare i think that's
[1156.96 - 1160.08] probably one of the big
[1158.24 - 1161.52] big biggest mistakes with everything
[1160.08 - 1162.80] especially in blood draw
[1161.52 - 1164.88] it just shows you that research in
[1162.80 - 1166.72] science is so far behind and antiquated
[1164.88 - 1167.92] and there's broken pieces of it in the
[1166.72 - 1170.24] system you know
[1167.92 - 1172.32] broken broken aspects of it and this is
[1170.24 - 1172.88] a big one right here when it comes down
[1172.32 - 1176.32] to
[1172.88 - 1178.56] pregnancies first of all
[1176.32 - 1180.00] a mommy's immune system is already
[1178.56 - 1182.16] looking after the baby
[1180.00 - 1183.36] because the baby doesn't have the baby's
[1182.16 - 1185.60] own immune system yet
[1183.36 - 1187.60] very important to know so mommy's immune
[1185.60 - 1190.48] system has to look
[1187.60 - 1193.68] after the baby so when mommy's getting
[1190.48 - 1196.00] blood draw all the time when pregnant
[1193.68 - 1198.80] that's mommy's immune system but that's
[1196.00 - 1200.80] the baby's immune system disappearing
[1198.80 - 1203.28] baby's immune system is disappearing
[1200.80 - 1204.72] baby's immune system is disappearing
[1203.28 - 1206.80] because mommy's immune system is the
[1204.72 - 1210.48] baby's immune system
[1206.80 - 1213.36] and um and it just doesn't recuperate
[1210.48 - 1215.12] instantly like the the mommy's immune
[1213.36 - 1217.04] system doesn't just all of a sudden oh
[1215.12 - 1220.24] it's fixed it's great it's all set
[1217.04 - 1222.08] now we're fine that's that's not reality
[1220.24 - 1224.80] that's not how it works
[1222.08 - 1226.24] so the baby feels all this so really
[1224.80 - 1228.16] what they should be doing now here's the
[1226.24 - 1231.36] problem you might be thinking well hey
[1228.16 - 1232.48] what a bad guy i am because i'm trying
[1231.36 - 1234.32] to tell
[1232.48 - 1236.08] pregnant women not to get blood tests
[1234.32 - 1237.68] and the system no that's not at all
[1236.08 - 1239.84] i want pregnant women to get their blood
[1237.68 - 1241.92] tested if that's what the doctor wants
[1239.84 - 1244.00] totally on board but they throw all the
[1241.92 - 1244.96] blood away so as i showed you guys and
[1244.00 - 1248.16] demonstrated
[1244.96 - 1248.96] a drop of blood is all they use in each
[1248.16 - 1251.36] test
[1248.96 - 1253.12] they throw all that blood away so why
[1251.36 - 1254.88] are they putting mommy under stress
[1253.12 - 1255.84] removing her immune system a big part of
[1254.88 - 1257.92] her immune system
[1255.84 - 1259.04] risking the baby's life with these blood
[1257.92 - 1261.04] draws
[1259.04 - 1262.64] and the in the protecting the baby when
[1261.04 - 1266.00] they're throwing away all the blood
[1262.64 - 1266.56] when you think about that this is really
[1266.00 - 1271.52] scary
[1266.56 - 1271.52] right um
[1272.24 - 1275.84] talking about lyme disease talking about
[1273.68 - 1278.00] other stuff too that's no point but

[1329.60 - 1333.84] the bambi is a deer responsible for lyme
[1331.68 - 1333.84] disease
[1335.20 - 1341.36] well talking about lyme disease
[1338.32 - 1345.12] now i'm going to tell you something
[1341.36 - 1349.44] this little critter right here everybody
[1345.12 - 1351.44] thinks causes lyme disease and
[1349.44 - 1353.12] there's the little tick right here so
[1351.44 - 1355.36] that little tick on the
[1353.12 - 1357.84] bambi right there that must be why
[1355.36 - 1360.56] everybody's sick with lyme disease right
[1357.84 - 1362.16] but that's not why everybody's sick with
[1360.56 - 1363.12] lyme disease i'm going to talk about in
[1362.16 - 1365.04] a minute
[1363.12 - 1367.44] the slime tick is going to get into the
[1365.04 - 1370.64] deer's eye it's terrible spot for a
[1367.44 - 1375.84] tick by the way and we are going to read
[1370.64 - 1375.84] a little bit about lyme disease now
[1376.00 - 1381.04] what else should i do on a friday should
[1378.80 - 1382.16] i take care of myself should i go take a
[1381.04 - 1384.08] run
[1382.16 - 1385.36] should i take a bath i mean what should
[1384.08 - 1387.60] i do no i want to
[1385.36 - 1388.96] i want to give you guys information
[1387.60 - 1391.12] because it matters and i'm hoping you
[1388.96 - 1391.68] guys hear the podcast episode to protect
[1391.12 - 1394.40] yourself
[1391.68 - 1396.16] seriously it's that important let's
[1394.40 - 1399.20] travel back in time for a moment to
[1396.16 - 1400.72] november 1975 when multiple children and
[1399.20 - 1403.12] young adults were developing
[1400.72 - 1405.36] symptoms which alerted doctors to launch
[1403.12 - 1406.08] an investigation in the area around lyme
[1405.36 - 1410.32] connecticut
[1406.08 - 1412.44] that gave lyme disease its name lime
[1410.32 - 1413.60] first let's remind ourselves of the
[1412.44 - 1416.80] technology
[1413.60 - 1420.72] back then rotary phones
[1416.80 - 1423.68] let's go there rotary phones
[1420.72 - 1425.36] so they knew the causal lime back then
[1423.68 - 1427.92] in 1975
[1425.36 - 1429.68] when they didn't know what causes any
[1427.92 - 1430.08] chronic illness but they knew what
[1429.68 - 1433.12] caused
[1430.08 - 1435.44] lyme disease interesting well okay
[1433.12 - 1436.32] think about the technology back then uh
[1435.44 - 1440.08] uh
[1436.32 - 1443.28] there's a fire there's a fire
[1440.08 - 1446.72] okay there's a fire
[1443.28 - 1450.24] all right hang on uh let's see
[1446.72 - 1452.56] 9-1-1 didn't exist back then but
[1450.24 - 1453.84] we got to hurry up there's a there's a
[1452.56 - 1456.80] fire
[1453.84 - 1457.76] technology is so really it's so good
[1456.80 - 1459.76] back then
[1457.76 - 1461.04] technology is so good all right wait
[1459.76 - 1463.36] hang on oh
[1461.04 - 1465.60] oh my finger slipped oh i gotta start
[1463.36 - 1469.12] again the fire is getting worse
[1465.60 - 1472.40] um hold on okay seven all right
[1469.12 - 1474.64] seven okay seven okay
[1472.40 - 1475.68] four that was a quick one because that's
[1474.64 - 1479.36] a short number
[1475.68 - 1483.28] four two that's a quick one oh nine
[1479.36 - 1487.20] nine uh nine again and an eight
[1483.28 - 1489.68] uh huh okay
[1487.20 - 1492.32] i'm waiting here we got a fire
[1489.68 - 1494.32] technology so great in 1975 but they
[1492.32 - 1495.60] know why lyme disease is lyme disease
[1494.32 - 1497.76] back then when they don't even know why
[1495.60 - 1500.80] lyme disease is lyme disease now
[1497.76 - 1502.88] i'm waiting here oh yeah um can you send
[1500.80 - 1507.76] a fire truck
[1502.88 - 1510.96] uh what you can't hear me okay
[1507.76 - 1514.24] fire truck okay my address
[1510.96 - 1517.68] uh okay well okay you're coming
[1514.24 - 1517.68] okay okay bye
[1518.08 - 1523.04] i mean that was technology at that time
[1520.88 - 1526.96] right
[1523.04 - 1528.64] right to get all these kids sick
[1526.96 - 1530.16] medical research and science didn't know
[1528.64 - 1531.44] what was wrong with anybody with chronic
[1530.16 - 1533.76] illness and they still
[1531.44 - 1535.44] don't know now what's wrong with
[1533.76 - 1536.40] everybody with chronic illness they
[1535.44 - 1539.20] still don't know
[1536.40 - 1539.20] now right
[1540.16 - 1547.20] but they had all the answers back then
[1544.00 - 1548.64] okay first let's remind ourselves of
[1547.20 - 1551.44] technology back then
[1548.64 - 1552.00] i'm in medical medium book one please if
[1551.44 - 1554.72] you
[1552.00 - 1556.00] can go to the library get it for free or
[1554.72 - 1558.56] go to amazon.com
[1556.00 - 1560.08] and pick up a revised and expanded
[1558.56 - 1563.28] edition new edition
[1560.08 - 1564.56] on sale at amazon.com
[1563.28 - 1566.40] first let's remind ourselves the
[1564.56 - 1567.28] technology back then rotary phones on
[1566.40 - 1570.40] the kitchen wall
[1567.28 - 1572.16] no such thing as voicemail right and
[1570.40 - 1575.12] sony was releasing the first
[1572.16 - 1575.76] vcr guys remember the vcr the tapes were
[1575.12 - 1577.36] this big
[1575.76 - 1579.04] they were like this big you put the tape
[1577.36 - 1582.08] in so i'm gonna watch
[1579.04 - 1584.16] honey i shrunk the kids
[1582.08 - 1585.76] or what am i gonna watch right what were
[1584.16 - 1587.76] the movies back then
[1585.76 - 1589.92] not even i mean we're talking a long
[1587.76 - 1593.36] time ago i'm thinking in 1975
[1589.92 - 1595.04] oh we're gonna put nine to five in uh
[1593.36 - 1596.80] nine to five what's that movie now
[1595.04 - 1599.68] that's even wait a minute that's even
[1596.80 - 1602.96] later this is 1975. what's 1975.
[1599.68 - 1606.48] we're gonna put in uh i don't know what
[1602.96 - 1609.04] dog day afternoon al pacino what do
[1606.48 - 1611.04] what was the movies back that 1975. i
[1609.04 - 1613.84] don't even know
[1611.04 - 1615.36] so anyway in the medical world kids were
[1613.84 - 1616.88] getting their tonsils plucked out like
[1615.36 - 1618.16] they were apples and they don't they
[1616.88 - 1620.00] didn't know why
[1618.16 - 1622.16] kids tonsils were swelling they still
[1620.00 - 1625.12] don't know why now but wait a minute
[1622.16 - 1626.00] technology was so advanced back then we
[1625.12 - 1629.20] might have to make
[1626.00 - 1631.44] another phone call okay uh uh
[1629.20 - 1633.36] i don't feel good and i got to get 9-1-1
[1631.44 - 1636.56] wait there is no 9-1-1
[1633.36 - 1638.64] this is 1975. i gotta get to the
[1636.56 - 1640.72] hospital what's the host honey what's
[1638.64 - 1642.24] the hospital's number
[1640.72 - 1645.28] what did you find it in the book the
[1642.24 - 1646.56] telephone book what page are you on
[1645.28 - 1648.88] what what page are you on in the
[1646.56 - 1650.72] telephone book okay what's the number of
[1648.88 - 1654.72] the hospital
[1650.72 - 1658.32] okay six five three okay oh hold on
[1654.72 - 1662.08] six five three
[1658.32 - 1665.20] nine nine four seven nine
[1662.08 - 1669.36] nine i don't feel good though
[1665.20 - 1672.96] four seven four well my finger slipped
[1669.36 - 1674.48] i gotta start over again what was it
[1672.96 - 1676.16] i mean that's that's what we're looking
[1674.48 - 1678.96] at
[1676.16 - 1678.96] let's keep on going
[1681.12 - 1683.68] even today there's no clinical
[1682.56 - 1685.20] understanding of what's behind
[1683.68 - 1687.76] tonsillitis technology
[1685.20 - 1689.28] has made leaps and bounds yeah right
[1687.76 - 1692.88] your phone's better
[1689.28 - 1693.20] but everybody's still sick everybody's
[1692.88 - 1695.60] still
[1693.20 - 1697.12] sick you mean to tell me signs of
[1695.60 - 1699.04] research didn't fix everybody in the
[1697.12 - 1702.00] last 40 years
[1699.04 - 1703.04] uh rose theresa we had 9-1-1 in 1975
[1702.00 - 1705.04] really because not
[1703.04 - 1706.40] i think everywhere in the united states
[1705.04 - 1710.08] had it
[1706.40 - 1713.20] um but i'm glad you told me
[1710.08 - 1715.04] rose thanks for being here awesome
[1713.20 - 1716.48] um well it looked maybe we did have
[1715.04 - 1719.52] 9-1-1 on there
[1716.48 - 1723.36] out there in 1975. i just remember
[1719.52 - 1725.76] i think in 1981 i think is when
[1723.36 - 1726.88] where i live we had 9-1-1 it was in the
[1725.76 - 1729.36] 80s
[1726.88 - 1730.32] early 80s anyway there's no clinical
[1729.36 - 1731.92] understanding of what's behind
[1730.32 - 1733.12] tonsillitis while technology has made
[1731.92 - 1735.28] leaps and bounds
[1733.12 - 1736.32] we still don't know why everybody's sick
[1735.28 - 1738.16] and they still don't know why
[1736.32 - 1742.64] everybody's sick today
[1738.16 - 1745.68] there we are nope we did not have 9-1-1
[1742.64 - 1747.44] katherine i i i didn't think we did
[1745.68 - 1750.00] um yeah we didn't have tammy says we
[1747.44 - 1752.16] didn't have 9-1-1 no we didn't
[1750.00 - 1754.88] okay we're sim i don't even know if we
[1752.16 - 1758.56] had it in 1981-911 maybe i'm wrong but
[1754.88 - 1760.24] it could have been like 1989
[1758.56 - 1762.56] were symptoms that have been seen okay
[1760.24 - 1765.84] so there were symptoms that were seen
[1762.56 - 1767.44] for decades before the lyme symptoms
[1765.84 - 1772.72] appeared you guys
[1767.44 - 1774.40] all right and somehow in this area
[1772.72 - 1776.08] the illness was treated as something new
[1774.40 - 1778.24] and recognizable
[1776.08 - 1779.92] it most likely because of compassionate
[1778.24 - 1781.84] doctors they were trying to get to the
[1779.92 - 1785.20] bottom of a problem
[1781.84 - 1786.88] okay so all around the world
[1785.20 - 1789.44] everybody was suffering from these same
[1786.88 - 1791.04] symptoms but they for some reason
[1789.44 - 1794.72] thought these symptoms started
[1791.04 - 1796.80] in lime right
[1794.72 - 1798.80] so townspeople began looking for a
[1796.80 - 1801.60] culprit and they landed on the deer tick
[1798.80 - 1802.88] deer tick you guys right the deer tick
[1801.60 - 1805.76] okay
[1802.88 - 1805.76] so the deer tick
[1805.92 - 1811.60] um but back then wait we had 9-1-1
[1809.12 - 1813.84] back in 97 i would probably say not in
[1811.60 - 1815.36] the entire country very small areas if
[1813.84 - 1820.72] there ever was
[1815.36 - 1820.72] i mean i didn't have 9-1-1 and 75 no way
[1820.84 - 1825.44] um so it landed on the deer tick because
[1823.84 - 1826.40] one of the patients reported seeing a
[1825.44 - 1829.52] tick a few
[1826.40 - 1831.28] weeks before he fell ill
[1829.52 - 1833.28] that's like a train derailing for
[1831.28 - 1835.52] reasons unknown and a passenger
[1833.28 - 1837.60] mentioning a deer he saw grazing 50
[1835.52 - 1841.20] miles back the clues didn't add up
[1837.60 - 1844.32] so so you had a few people that were
[1841.20 - 1848.48] sick they had some fatigue
[1844.32 - 1852.88] a few you know and uh jerry says 9-1-1
[1848.48 - 1856.72] started 1976 but only for 17
[1852.88 - 1859.68] of the country right yeah i mean 1975
[1856.72 - 1862.24] it wasn't there right but 76 it started
[1859.68 - 1864.00] i don't think it got to
[1862.24 - 1865.28] i don't think it got to we're up you
[1864.00 - 1868.32] know where i was until
[1865.28 - 1870.08] a long time so yeah
[1868.32 - 1871.84] see you guys the whole thing with the
[1870.08 - 1875.36] tick comes down to this
[1871.84 - 1878.72] right so a deer tick
[1875.36 - 1882.08] right was seen a few weeks
[1878.72 - 1884.32] before okay someone got some lyme
[1882.08 - 1887.84] symptoms right
[1884.32 - 1890.24] during the summer right and
[1887.84 - 1892.40] but that's that's not enough evidence
[1890.24 - 1894.64] it's just not enough evidence
[1892.40 - 1896.48] a deer tick is not enough evidence so
[1894.64 - 1898.80] the culprit became all the deer
[1896.48 - 1900.08] and that's what everybody focused on it
[1898.80 - 1904.84] was all
[1900.08 - 1909.76] sharon said connecticut 9-1-1 1981
[1904.84 - 1913.52] so andrea says the nation's first 9-1-1
[1909.76 - 1916.96] call was placed on february 16 1968
[1913.52 - 1919.04] and haleyville alabama california state
[1916.96 - 1920.00] statewide system initially launched in
[1919.04 - 1922.80] 1972
[1920.00 - 1923.68] but wasn't fully completed until 1985.
[1922.80 - 1926.08] yeah
[1923.68 - 1929.44] i i remember most people getting like
[1926.08 - 1932.56] 911 by like 1989
[1929.44 - 1935.92] somewhere around that yeah
[1932.56 - 1939.68] yeah and in connecticut was 1981 yeah
[1935.92 - 1941.12] it's 1975 right just this wasn't around
[1939.68 - 1942.72] it's it's isn't it interesting all
[1941.12 - 1945.12] that's interesting
[1942.72 - 1946.48] so the deer was blamed for lyme disease
[1945.12 - 1949.36] okay no proof
[1946.48 - 1950.08] they never found the bacteria in a tick
[1949.36 - 1951.60] ever
[1950.08 - 1954.64] just so you know i'm letting you guys
[1951.60 - 1956.24] know they never found bacteria in a tick
[1954.64 - 1957.92] they never found the borrelia
[1956.24 - 1959.52] never found the bartonella in a tick
[1957.92 - 1962.96] ever never did
[1959.52 - 1965.68] never did but um
[1962.96 - 1967.04] diana loves the visuals it helps right
[1965.68 - 1968.24] you guys i'm steaming up potatoes
[1967.04 - 1971.52] cauliflower making the
[1968.24 - 1973.60] potato cauliflower mash so
[1971.52 - 1975.04] the point all of this is and i'm gonna
[1973.60 - 1977.04] keep on going here
[1975.04 - 1979.76] karen says crazy that they name the
[1977.04 - 1982.24] cause of lime from deer tick
[1979.76 - 1985.76] how did how scientific is that haha
[1982.24 - 1991.84] exactly that's how it works
[1985.76 - 1991.84] so get back to this a little bit
[1993.68 - 1998.32] going back a little bit more okay 1981 a
[1997.04 - 2000.24] doctor announced he discovered the
[1998.32 - 2002.64] missing link a bacterium named
[2000.24 - 2004.24] borrelia that the ticks passed along to
[2002.64 - 2007.36] humans through their bites
[2004.24 - 2008.64] they never found the tick that had the
[2007.36 - 2011.76] borrelia
[2008.64 - 2013.04] never found that but it was a theory is
[2011.76 - 2015.20] what it was
[2013.04 - 2017.12] he was lauded for his discovery which
[2015.20 - 2019.36] led to a series of bacteria focused
[2017.12 - 2022.08] tested treatments for lyme disease
[2019.36 - 2025.12] which started the process of destroying
[2022.08 - 2025.12] a lot of lives
[2025.28 - 2028.48] it was the perfect out for the medical
[2027.04 - 2031.12] authorities no one liked
[2028.48 - 2032.00] ticks anyway do you guys like ticks no
[2031.12 - 2034.64] one likes ticks
[2032.00 - 2035.92] everybody hates ticks molly what do you
[2034.64 - 2038.16] take tests why do
[2035.92 - 2040.32] ticks test positive but then when they
[2038.16 - 2041.60] say they're positive with lyme
[2040.32 - 2043.52] they're not tested positive with
[2041.60 - 2046.88] borrelia or bartonella
[2043.52 - 2047.92] um not at all they're te if people are
[2046.88 - 2050.72] tested
[2047.92 - 2051.20] for inflammation that's how it's worked
[2050.72 - 2054.72] so
[2051.20 - 2056.88] your blood gets removed and that blood
[2054.72 - 2057.76] gets tested with inflammation markers
[2056.88 - 2060.40] kind of like the a
[2057.76 - 2062.96] a anti-nuclear antigen test if you if
[2060.40 - 2065.84] you show an elevation of inflammation
[2062.96 - 2066.56] the the lyme lab puts the bacteria name
[2065.84 - 2069.36] along with
[2066.56 - 2069.92] it they don't find the bacteria in your
[2069.36 - 2073.04] blood
[2069.92 - 2074.56] they never did isn't that sad and
[2073.04 - 2076.56] when you learn the truth about lyme
[2074.56 - 2078.40] disease might really get you upset
[2076.56 - 2080.72] because you wonder why is there so many
[2078.40 - 2084.96] devious sinister
[2080.72 - 2088.96] corrupt situations in chronic illness
[2084.96 - 2090.72] why there just is for a lot of reasons
[2088.96 - 2092.56] one was to sell billions of dollars of
[2090.72 - 2094.72] antibiotics actually more than billions
[2092.56 - 2095.52] of dollars antibiotics now so we got 50
[2094.72 - 2097.76] years
[2095.52 - 2100.80] of lyme disease for whatever it is now
[2097.76 - 2102.72] 40 years 40 plus years of lyme disease
[2100.80 - 2104.08] and with that 40 plus years of lyme
[2102.72 - 2104.96] disease they've sold a lot of
[2104.08 - 2107.68] antibiotics
[2104.96 - 2108.80] and that's a big part of why it's done
[2107.68 - 2111.84] it was a perfect doubt
[2108.80 - 2112.40] metal meta the medical authorities no
[2111.84 - 2114.88] one liked
[2112.40 - 2116.96] ticks anyway and the theory of a
[2114.88 - 2118.80] tick-borne illness fed into the fear of
[2116.96 - 2120.72] nature already present in society
[2118.80 - 2122.24] medical authorities felt they could give
[2120.72 - 2124.40] up on digging for an answer
[2122.24 - 2125.92] so let's not dig for an answer anymore
[2124.40 - 2127.44] let's stop looking
[2125.92 - 2128.96] let's stop looking it must have been
[2127.44 - 2131.92] that tick
[2128.96 - 2133.84] meanwhile the world was suffering from
[2131.92 - 2137.60] the same symptoms
[2133.84 - 2140.08] and much of the world all the people
[2137.60 - 2141.60] weren't around ticks ticks were only in
[2140.08 - 2143.28] certain areas of the world
[2141.60 - 2145.36] but yet there were lots of areas of the
[2143.28 - 2146.00] world where there were no ticks no one
[2145.36 - 2147.52] saw a tick
[2146.00 - 2149.92] no one ever had a tick bite in their
[2147.52 - 2151.68] life their family members never had to
[2149.92 - 2153.36] take bite in their life but they were
[2151.68 - 2154.08] sick with these symptoms see how it
[2153.36 - 2157.68] works
[2154.08 - 2158.00] it's interesting unfortunately all these
[2157.68 - 2160.88] tick
[2158.00 - 2161.52] discoveries were wrong this is what you
[2160.88 - 2163.60] won't hear
[2161.52 - 2164.96] anywhere else lyme disease is not caused
[2163.60 - 2166.64] by ticks
[2164.96 - 2168.72] and lyme disease is not caused by
[2166.64 - 2172.40] borrelia
[2168.72 - 2173.68] and this broke lyme disease the world of
[2172.40 - 2176.40] lyme disease is back
[2173.68 - 2177.68] is this book doctors are now treating
[2176.40 - 2179.76] lyme disease differently
[2177.68 - 2181.28] they're treating lyme disease with cat's
[2179.76 - 2184.56] claw
[2181.28 - 2185.52] right anti-viral treating lyme disease
[2184.56 - 2188.00] with cat's cloth
[2185.52 - 2189.44] now doctors check for reactivated
[2188.00 - 2192.72] epstein-barr when they're
[2189.44 - 2194.88] searching for lyme disease so they all
[2192.72 - 2196.40] test patients now for epstein-barr
[2194.88 - 2199.20] because of this book
[2196.40 - 2200.08] so now doctors are checking for
[2199.20 - 2202.24] epstein-barr
[2200.08 - 2204.32] when they're looking for lime that's why
[2202.24 - 2206.40] you hear uh yeah i got diagnosed with
[2204.32 - 2208.32] lime and epstein barr
[2206.40 - 2210.32] i got diagnosed with lyme and
[2208.32 - 2212.84] epstein-barr
[2210.32 - 2214.00] i got diagnosed with lyme disease at
[2212.84 - 2216.88] epstein-barr
[2214.00 - 2217.36] everybody gets diagnosed now with ebv
[2216.88 - 2220.08] now
[2217.36 - 2221.76] doctors never thought epstein-barr did
[2220.08 - 2223.20] anything besides gave you motto and went
[2221.76 - 2226.08] away but the book
[2223.20 - 2228.08] taught on how it's reactivated so this
[2226.08 - 2229.84] is the first book in the world that
[2228.08 - 2232.96] taught everybody that epstein-barr
[2229.84 - 2234.00] gets reactivated and causes real
[2232.96 - 2235.44] symptoms
[2234.00 - 2237.76] because they used to think epstein-barr
[2235.44 - 2239.52] just went away now we've changed the
[2237.76 - 2240.84] world of lyme disease including adding
[2239.52 - 2244.24] cat's claw into the
[2240.84 - 2245.84] regimen which is really amazing
[2244.24 - 2247.28] so does anything happen when you're
[2245.84 - 2249.68] bitten by a tick yes
[2247.28 - 2251.92] good call good question let's talk about
[2249.68 - 2255.28] that for a second
[2251.92 - 2256.88] all right so i'm sitting here minding my
[2255.28 - 2259.12] own business right
[2256.88 - 2260.00] and that tick gets you and it gets on
[2259.12 - 2262.40] your neck
[2260.00 - 2263.28] and you're like what the heck what is
[2262.40 - 2266.32] this
[2263.28 - 2266.96] honey is that a tick take a look in the
[2266.32 - 2269.04] mirror
[2266.96 - 2270.00] is that a tick that's a tick right get
[2269.04 - 2272.16] the tweezers wait
[2270.00 - 2273.36] you're not supposed to squeeze it right
[2272.16 - 2274.88] you're not supposed to squeeze it with
[2273.36 - 2276.80] the tweezers you're supposed to try to
[2274.88 - 2279.92] pluck it out so you don't squeeze the
[2276.80 - 2281.84] bacteria back into you right so you're
[2279.92 - 2283.28] not supposed to squeeze the bacteria
[2281.84 - 2286.08] back into you right
[2283.28 - 2287.12] um okay we'll just try to get a careful
[2286.08 - 2289.60] ow
[2287.12 - 2290.88] ow you got the tick oh no the legs are
[2289.60 - 2293.04] left in me
[2290.88 - 2293.92] i think the head of the ticks left in my
[2293.04 - 2298.32] neck
[2293.92 - 2300.64] ow ow and what happens is
[2298.32 - 2302.00] when anything's left in you from an
[2300.64 - 2305.36] insect
[2302.00 - 2306.72] your body goes crazy you get the
[2305.36 - 2309.60] bull's-eye
[2306.72 - 2310.16] it's called the bite it happens when a
[2309.60 - 2313.12] bee's
[2310.16 - 2313.84] stinger stays in you if you don't take
[2313.12 - 2316.72] the bee
[2313.84 - 2317.84] stinger out and you leave that bee
[2316.72 - 2321.20] stinger in you
[2317.84 - 2324.24] you're gonna have one hell of a swollen
[2321.20 - 2326.96] uh migraines rash heck of
[2324.24 - 2327.44] one like you're gonna have that bull's
[2326.96 - 2330.64] eye
[2327.44 - 2333.12] is what you're gonna have spider bite
[2330.64 - 2333.84] if the venom's in you or a little bit of
[2333.12 - 2335.92] particles
[2333.84 - 2337.20] proteins from the spider's venom there's
[2335.92 - 2340.24] venom still in you
[2337.20 - 2342.56] you got the bullseye you get
[2340.24 - 2343.84] bit by something like a tick and a leg
[2342.56 - 2345.76] is still in you the little bit of the
[2343.84 - 2348.32] head you're going to get a bull's eye
[2345.76 - 2350.32] yeah you can get an infection if it's
[2348.32 - 2352.48] not cleaned up and addressed and a lot
[2350.32 - 2354.88] of people the head of the tick stays in
[2352.48 - 2356.96] turns into an infection but that's a
[2354.88 - 2360.40] staph infection
[2356.96 - 2364.56] that's a staph infection
[2360.40 - 2366.80] that's not borrelia that's a staph
[2364.56 - 2369.44] infection right there
[2366.80 - 2371.04] that head of the tick stays in your neck
[2369.44 - 2374.88] that tick gets pulled out
[2371.04 - 2374.88] that's a staph infection
[2375.76 - 2379.36] so many holes in the lyme disease thing
[2377.60 - 2383.84] it's so sad
[2379.36 - 2383.84] it's so sad so let's keep on talking
[2384.24 - 2387.92] book explains all this you guys got to
[2386.32 - 2390.32] read the lime chapter
[2387.92 - 2391.52] it explains all the triggers okay and
[2390.32 - 2392.32] i'll go over the triggers a little bit
[2391.52 - 2396.00] with you too
[2392.32 - 2400.08] in a second
[2396.00 - 2401.76] so let's go just a little bit
[2400.08 - 2404.08] when the research was taking place in
[2401.76 - 2405.60] the 1970s and 1980s you'd suppose
[2404.08 - 2407.76] researchers would have realized the
[2405.60 - 2409.20] problem was happening nationwide and
[2407.76 - 2411.28] globally
[2409.20 - 2413.20] and today you think someone would would
[2411.28 - 2415.28] have wake up and realize that hundreds
[2413.20 - 2416.96] of thousands of people who have never
[2415.28 - 2418.80] been near a deer tick receive lyme
[2416.96 - 2421.52] disease diagnosis right
[2418.80 - 2423.04] so think about science and research for
[2421.52 - 2424.56] a minute just think about this you guys
[2423.04 - 2427.76] i'm serious okay
[2424.56 - 2430.88] this is serious right a few kids
[2427.76 - 2434.40] came down with aches and pains
[2430.88 - 2436.48] fatigue right think about this
[2434.40 - 2438.72] some compassionate doctors wanted to
[2436.48 - 2443.28] know what's going on
[2438.72 - 2447.68] okay research in science
[2443.28 - 2447.68] did not pick up the phone
[2447.84 - 2454.96] and call other states to see if kids
[2451.92 - 2458.08] were dealing with the same thing
[2454.96 - 2459.76] i'm going to say it again how screwed up
[2458.08 - 2464.08] is this
[2459.76 - 2467.68] famous research and science
[2464.08 - 2468.96] godly research and science top doctors
[2467.68 - 2472.32] of harvard
[2468.96 - 2474.80] top doctors of yale doctor top best
[2472.32 - 2478.40] doctors on the planet
[2474.80 - 2479.84] research in science didn't pick up the
[2478.40 - 2482.32] god damn phone
[2479.84 - 2485.36] [Laughter]
[2482.32 - 2486.88] right a friend of mine's grandmother
[2485.36 - 2488.08] said that the other day
[2486.88 - 2490.16] she said are you going to be talking
[2488.08 - 2493.20] about lyme disease
[2490.16 - 2496.72] and then she said those damn tics
[2493.20 - 2500.40] i said i said there's not the ticks
[2496.72 - 2502.96] it's like 92. i said it's not the ticks
[2500.40 - 2503.92] all right they could have picked up the
[2502.96 - 2507.44] phone
[2503.92 - 2510.48] and called anybody else in this
[2507.44 - 2510.88] any state in in the country they could
[2510.48 - 2512.80] have
[2510.88 - 2514.40] called overseas but that's right
[2512.80 - 2516.00] technology i don't think you could make
[2514.40 - 2518.64] an overseas phone call
[2516.00 - 2520.72] with this could you i highly doubt it
[2518.64 - 2523.20] what someone lives in the uk
[2520.72 - 2525.04] uh never gonna talk to him ever because
[2523.20 - 2526.80] this thing's not gonna get there well it
[2525.04 - 2529.12] is probably it probably would reach him
[2526.80 - 2530.48] the point is though is that they could
[2529.12 - 2533.76] have called anybody
[2530.48 - 2534.16] anywhere around the world and said are
[2533.76 - 2536.32] you
[2534.16 - 2538.24] having problems is there any kids
[2536.32 - 2539.20] entering your hospital with fatigue and
[2538.24 - 2542.08] aches and pains
[2539.20 - 2542.64] how about your town how about your city
[2542.08 - 2546.24] but that
[2542.64 - 2548.72] shows you research and science is so bad
[2546.24 - 2550.16] and was so bad then and guess what you
[2548.72 - 2552.88] think they fixed it
[2550.16 - 2554.56] you think research and science was fixed
[2552.88 - 2557.04] like it's fixed right
[2554.56 - 2557.92] it's fixed the only thing they fixed it
[2557.04 - 2560.32] with now
[2557.92 - 2561.28] is research in science focuses on the
[2560.32 - 2564.16] matcha tea
[2561.28 - 2565.20] that's it that's it they focus on matcha
[2564.16 - 2567.12] tea
[2565.20 - 2568.80] women are laying in their beds can't
[2567.12 - 2572.16] function can't drive cars
[2568.80 - 2574.40] crippling anxiety aches and pains total
[2572.16 - 2576.08] sickness every there's all the different
[2574.40 - 2578.40] conditions we have
[2576.08 - 2580.08] and they're focused on machete once
[2578.40 - 2580.48] again that's what research of science
[2580.08 - 2583.92] did
[2580.48 - 2587.76] they first of all they tried to help out
[2583.92 - 2590.32] three kids back then in 1975
[2587.76 - 2591.12] said well it must be lyme disease that's
[2590.32 - 2593.04] what they said
[2591.12 - 2595.28] right they never found a bacteria in a
[2593.04 - 2598.96] tick they came out with a theory
[2595.28 - 2600.96] but completely bombarded hundreds of
[2598.96 - 2603.20] thousands of women and children with
[2600.96 - 2604.88] antibiotics ruining their lives all
[2603.20 - 2608.56] through the late 70s
[2604.88 - 2611.20] 80s 90s 2000s and all they had to do was
[2608.56 - 2613.68] make a phone call and realize
[2611.20 - 2615.36] that if everywhere around the world they
[2613.68 - 2616.48] were suffering from the same symptoms
[2615.36 - 2621.84] that maybe
[2616.48 - 2624.88] it wasn't a tick
[2621.84 - 2629.44] it's actually sick demented
[2624.88 - 2629.44] when you think about it so that's how it
[2632.84 - 2638.16] works
[2635.28 - 2640.48] yeah so anyway i'm just giving you guys
[2638.16 - 2644.00] the rundown
[2640.48 - 2645.52] um all right uh elena says i found a
[2644.00 - 2646.96] tick of my apartment about six months
[2645.52 - 2650.16] ago my god i freaked out
[2646.96 - 2653.28] so bad we called exterminator
[2650.16 - 2655.60] sprayed all this stuff all over
[2653.28 - 2657.20] poor thing didn't even die so we sprayed
[2655.60 - 2660.56] again
[2657.20 - 2663.68] um if it was me i would not
[2660.56 - 2666.24] do the sprays i wouldn't do the sprays
[2663.68 - 2668.48] they won't kill really the bugs the bugs
[2666.24 - 2670.48] will keep on coming back and all you do
[2668.48 - 2673.12] is you're just spraying yourself
[2670.48 - 2673.60] so of course you can spray if you like
[2673.12 - 2675.12] to
[2673.60 - 2676.56] i'm not trying to tell you different i'm
[2675.12 - 2677.84] not trying to take i'm just saying if it
[2676.56 - 2680.00] was me
[2677.84 - 2682.88] i just would i don't think i'd be doing
[2680.00 - 2682.88] all that spraying
[2683.60 - 2688.48] pesticides herbicides fungicides a whole
[2688.84 - 2693.76] bit
[2691.44 - 2693.76] so
[2695.44 - 2705.84] hooking up some stuff you guys
[2706.32 - 2711.60] all right a little bit more
[2709.68 - 2713.84] it's not bad for a friday afternoon
[2711.60 - 2714.72] right we're just trying to have a little
[2713.84 - 2717.12] fun
[2714.72 - 2718.96] but you guys if you just got on here i'm
[2717.12 - 2720.16] talking about neurological symptoms it's
[2718.96 - 2721.76] not just lyme disease
[2720.16 - 2723.12] here's i'm talking about lyme disease in

[2829.84 - 2834.16] the platform for now and like if i got
[2832.24 - 2836.64] this little platform then let me
[2834.16 - 2837.44] make sure you guys can just i gotta just

[2842.32 - 2845.12] everything i got because i've been
[2843.36 - 2847.44] telling you about the blood draws but
[2845.12 - 2849.60] i don't think everybody's been hearing
[2847.44 - 2849.60] it
[2852.48 - 2856.96] all right lyme disease symptoms the
[2855.04 - 2858.08] confusion about lyme disease symptoms is
[2856.96 - 2860.24] vast
[2858.08 - 2861.92] vast at this point every autoimmune
[2860.24 - 2864.24] disease or mystery illness in this book
[2861.92 - 2865.68] and in existence has symptoms that have
[2864.24 - 2868.16] been linked to lyme disease
[2865.68 - 2870.08] every single autoimmune symptom out
[2868.16 - 2872.80] there can be linked to lyme disease
[2870.08 - 2873.92] and lyme disease is not bacteria and i'm
[2872.80 - 2876.88] going to talk about that
[2873.92 - 2878.24] lyme disease is viral so it's viral
[2876.88 - 2882.48] that's the difference so
[2878.24 - 2886.80] here's a bacteria okay
[2882.48 - 2890.32] here's a virus bacteria
[2886.80 - 2893.84] virus bacteria doesn't
[2890.32 - 2897.36] pee and poop out a neurotoxin
[2893.84 - 2901.12] okay viruses
[2897.36 - 2903.20] release a neurotoxin neurological lyme
[2901.12 - 2904.56] and every other neurological symptom
[2903.20 - 2906.88] people deal with
[2904.56 - 2908.00] is caused by viruses releasing a
[2906.88 - 2912.16] neurotoxin
[2908.00 - 2915.84] bacteria doesn't lyme is not bacteria
[2912.16 - 2915.84] just not
[2918.24 - 2924.08] autoimmune is viral and you can get a
[2922.08 - 2925.68] lyme diagnosis if you're autoimmune in a
[2924.08 - 2928.16] heartbeat go to a lyme doctor you got
[2925.68 - 2929.76] your lyme diagnosis
[2928.16 - 2931.60] and guess what he's going to be testing
[2929.76 - 2932.48] for epstein-barr because of medical
[2931.60 - 2934.88] medium
[2932.48 - 2936.24] millions of books going around thousands
[2934.88 - 2938.08] of doctors
[2936.24 - 2939.36] with the books they're testing for
[2938.08 - 2941.76] epstein-barr now
[2939.36 - 2943.44] they say lyme because the blind the lyme
[2941.76 - 2945.84] lab won't let go
[2943.44 - 2948.64] the lime lab they won't let go they
[2945.84 - 2951.36] don't want to say they were wrong
[2948.64 - 2951.92] they don't because if they say they were
[2951.36 - 2953.20] wrong
[2951.92 - 2955.12] all this time they're going to look
[2953.20 - 2957.68] really bad so they have to keep
[2955.12 - 2960.08] what they're doing even though it's
[2957.68 - 2960.08] viral
[2962.64 - 2969.76] why do blood draws kill over time
[2967.04 - 2970.88] because severe deficiencies too much
[2969.76 - 2972.32] blood being drawn
[2970.88 - 2974.32] and when you're sick with lyme disease
[2972.32 - 2975.12] like neurological lyme you're fighting a
[2974.32 - 2977.20] virus
[2975.12 - 2978.88] and as your immune system gets pulled
[2977.20 - 2980.24] out of you and pulled out of you pulled
[2978.88 - 2980.80] out of you you get weaker and weaker and
[2980.24 - 2983.20] weaker
[2980.80 - 2984.56] a lot of women have died with chronic
[2983.20 - 2986.32] illness
[2984.56 - 2988.08] because they lost their immune system
[2986.32 - 2989.44] over time they lost the battle to
[2988.08 - 2991.04] viruses
[2989.44 - 2992.48] because their blood kept on being drawn
[2991.04 - 2994.00] drawn drawn now i want you to go to the
[2992.48 - 2996.88] doctor and get your blood drawn
[2994.00 - 2999.04] absolutely but listen to the podcast so
[2996.88 - 2999.76] you can learn what you can ask for and
[2999.04 - 3002.80] do it right
[2999.76 - 3002.80] and learn the information
[3003.92 - 3007.28] tandy says i listen to the podcast it
[3005.84 - 3010.24] made me so angry
[3007.28 - 3011.04] all of the bs happened to me 15 years
[3010.24 - 3013.12] ago
[3011.04 - 3015.20] i'm so glad to have found you i just
[3013.12 - 3015.60] bought three of your books including the
[3015.20 - 3018.48] new
[3015.60 - 3019.76] and revised edition new edition thank
[3018.48 - 3021.36] you tandy
[3019.76 - 3023.60] it matters this information you know you
[3021.36 - 3026.00] know who knows about this information
[3023.60 - 3026.80] i saw dr faun here he's here tonight
[3026.00 - 3029.04] incredible dr
[3026.80 - 3030.72] sherry green another incredible doctor
[3029.04 - 3034.56] dr vaughn dr green
[3030.72 - 3034.56] two mds incredible mds
[3034.88 - 3038.88] look nobody knew about the blood draw
[3036.72 - 3042.24] thing it's medical medium had to
[3038.88 - 3045.36] you know get the cannonball out
[3042.24 - 3046.88] uh dr faun per mm the tick doesn't have
[3045.36 - 3049.28] the virus
[3046.88 - 3050.56] the bite triggers the ebb thank you for
[3049.28 - 3054.16] clarifying that
[3050.56 - 3056.08] thank you thank you thank you so
[3054.16 - 3058.16] the tick doesn't carry the epstein-barr
[3056.08 - 3059.76] virus or the shingles virus or the hhv
[3058.16 - 3060.64] six of the side of that megalovirus the
[3059.76 - 3063.36] tick
[3060.64 - 3064.40] right bites you right take bites you
[3063.36 - 3067.04] whatever
[3064.40 - 3068.08] the tick bites you and then you get
[3067.04 - 3069.68] triggered because
[3068.08 - 3072.40] the tick bite can lower the immune
[3069.68 - 3075.68] system especially if a little bit of
[3072.40 - 3078.40] a little bit of the proteins from
[3075.68 - 3079.04] the bite or the tick's head really the
[3078.40 - 3081.04] tick's head
[3079.04 - 3082.88] pieces of the tick's head get lodged in
[3081.04 - 3086.24] everybody that's how it's done
[3082.88 - 3089.28] and that lowers the immune system
[3086.24 - 3091.60] mc says i'm not a doctor but i'm here
[3089.28 - 3093.28] i'm glad you're here darlene says what's

[3165.12 - 3169.12] yeah that could be a trigger too just
[3167.44 - 3170.40] bug bites can be triggers for a lot of
[3169.12 - 3171.20] people that are sensitive and immune
[3170.40 - 3175.28] systems down

[3201.92 - 3206.84] so i'm getting all these potatoes and
[3203.52 - 3209.68] cauliflower in this pan
[3206.84 - 3211.12] um
[3209.68 - 3213.52] the reason why i'm talking about lyme
[3211.12 - 3215.76] disease today
[3213.52 - 3217.76] is because by the way we're live youtube
[3215.76 - 3220.00] live facebook right now
[3217.76 - 3220.96] i talk i'm talking about it because i
[3220.00 - 3222.56] think the people with
[3220.96 - 3224.24] lyme and anybody autoimmune with
[3222.56 - 3225.12] neurological symptoms they suffer the
[3224.24 - 3228.40] worst
[3225.12 - 3231.12] when it comes down to blood draws but
[3228.40 - 3232.32] you gotta catch that episode but here's
[3231.12 - 3233.68] the thing you think you're healthy you
[3232.32 - 3235.36] think you're fine you think you have
[3233.68 - 3237.52] nothing to worry about hey nothing to
[3235.36 - 3240.16] worry about at all who cares
[3237.52 - 3242.00] um you know i got i don't have lyme
[3240.16 - 3244.88] disease i don't have neurological
[3242.00 - 3247.84] symptoms i don't have these problems
[3244.88 - 3249.36] i don't need to i don't need to worry
[3247.84 - 3251.52] about it i can get my blood drawn any
[3249.36 - 3253.44] old time anytime i want to but even five
[3251.52 - 3255.52] vials full vials
[3253.44 - 3257.60] done when you're healthy still sets you
[3255.52 - 3260.16] back you start getting deficiencies
[3257.60 - 3263.04] deficiencies lead to a lot of problems
[3260.16 - 3264.80] and then we just get in trouble
[3263.04 - 3266.72] could you add onions to the potato
[3264.80 - 3268.48] cauliflower absolutely
[3266.72 - 3270.72] you know what if you eat this meal
[3268.48 - 3273.20] because it's a fat-free meal
[3270.72 - 3274.88] okay the recipe is in here but if you if
[3273.20 - 3276.40] the recipe is in this medical medium new
[3274.88 - 3281.04] edition
[3276.40 - 3281.04] but if you eat a fat-free meal
[3281.12 - 3284.80] because this is a fat-free meal and you
[3282.80 - 3287.04] want to put onions in here i'm fine
[3284.80 - 3288.48] just don't put oil in there don't put
[3287.04 - 3291.20] butter don't put
[3288.48 - 3292.24] don't put oil butter don't put avocado
[3291.20 - 3293.76] in here this is a fat
[3292.24 - 3295.28] free meal for a reason because

[3717.04 - 3721.28] and you know that means everything so
[3720.00 - 3722.56] lyme disease
[3721.28 - 3723.84] protocols let's head into the lyme
[3722.56 - 3725.20] disease protocols a little bit i just
[3723.84 - 3728.40] made this beautiful meal
[3725.20 - 3729.76] i'm excited about that meal go back to
[3728.40 - 3731.36] lime for a little bit i have the lyme
[3729.76 - 3732.40] disease protocols in here you can check
[3731.36 - 3733.60] out these protocols
[3732.40 - 3736.56] so i just want to give you a rundown
[3733.60 - 3741.84] real quick show it to you and then
[3736.56 - 3741.84] there it is lyme disease boom
[3744.64 - 3749.60] balabi hi mm what are your thoughts on
[3747.52 - 3750.72] ticks carrying a parasite that lives
[3749.60 - 3754.72] inside
[3750.72 - 3758.64] the lime well my thoughts are this
[3754.72 - 3762.24] okay i can tell you this okay a parasite
[3758.64 - 3763.76] in a tick is not the same thing as
[3762.24 - 3765.84] borrelia in a tick
[3763.76 - 3766.88] and lyme disease neurological symptoms
[3765.84 - 3768.48] so that's important too
[3766.88 - 3770.48] another thing too is there's no
[3768.48 - 3772.32] tick-borne illness that ever caused
[3770.48 - 3774.40] neurological symptoms
[3772.32 - 3776.56] the only tick-borne illness we've ever
[3774.40 - 3779.68] had in the united states or
[3776.56 - 3783.28] somewhere else globally has been a
[3779.68 - 3786.48] fever but not neurological sickness
[3783.28 - 3788.80] chronic long term so that doesn't exist
[3786.48 - 3790.00] and parasites don't cause chronic
[3788.80 - 3792.88] illness
[3790.00 - 3794.32] parasites don't cause chronic symptoms
[3792.88 - 3796.88] when you get a parasite in your
[3794.32 - 3797.52] intestinal tract you either win the
[3796.88 - 3799.60] battle
[3797.52 - 3800.64] or you lose the battle there's no in
[3799.60 - 3803.44] between
[3800.64 - 3804.64] so when you get a foodborne pathogen
[3803.44 - 3808.56] that's parasitical
[3804.64 - 3810.24] your body throws it up craps it out
[3808.56 - 3812.80] throws it up craps it out throws it up
[3810.24 - 3814.40] craps it out throws it up craps it out
[3812.80 - 3816.24] you're in agony pain you're in the
[3814.40 - 3817.92] hospital you're on painkillers you throw
[3816.24 - 3819.92] it up you crap it out then they drug you
[3817.92 - 3821.28] with more painkillers until you win the
[3819.92 - 3824.00] battle
[3821.28 - 3825.76] and in many cases foodborne illness from
[3824.00 - 3827.52] eating some chicken in a restaurant has
[3825.76 - 3828.16] killed a lot of people and you lose the
[3827.52 - 3830.24] battle
[3828.16 - 3832.00] there's no in between your body won't
[3830.24 - 3834.24] live with a parasite inside
[3832.00 - 3836.00] the gut worms are different though your
[3834.24 - 3837.52] body will live with a worm and you can
[3836.00 - 3839.76] have worms in your liver you can have
[3837.52 - 3841.60] worms in your body
[3839.76 - 3843.52] but the worms don't cause neurological
[3841.60 - 3844.08] symptoms either anyway you guys heading
