221
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,039
guys guys got to be prepared

222
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,160
so i just want to i'm going to make sure

223
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,840
i'm telling you this so no one's

224
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,759
confused because it's easy

225
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,199
to get confused about this so let's go

226
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,280
into it a little bit we got the lemon

227
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,280
water right here 16 to 32 ounces of

228
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,960
lemon water first thing in the morning

229
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,800
that's what i'm doing now i didn't

230
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,560
mention this yesterday but you can do

231
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,280
lemon water again

232
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,400
if you want you can do a couple of them

233
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,039
three of them

234
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,400
you can do them all right so it's okay

235
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,759
it doesn't have to be your only lemon

236
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,599
water if you don't want

237
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,800
you can be putting lemon in water all

238
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,840
day long

239
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,199
perfectly fine karen churchill can we

240
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,479
include lemon water or

241
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,840
lemon balm tea at night if you want to

242
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,919
include lemon balm tea

243
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,199
at night you can but you can include

244
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,840
lemon

245
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,720
water on and off all day just letting

246
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,960
you know okay

247
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,840
so there's the lemon water 16 to 32

248
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:12,479
ounces

249
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:14,080
right we got that

250
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,520
david lopez i'm gonna answer as many

251
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,639
questions as i can because that's what

252
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,160
we're about

253
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:22,639
can we mono eat coconut water well

254
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,319
that's a cleanse right that's a cleanse

255
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,599
too but what that is

256
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:29,599
is that's a juice fast

257
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,840
so if you just mono eat coconut water

258
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:34,080
you're now on a juice fast

259
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,880
coconut juice fast right that's what

260
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,959
you're doing

261
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,039
now that's an entirely different story

262
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,719
okay the problem is with those

263
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,080
kinds of things when you're just doing

264
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,080
coconut water and you're just doing a

265
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,720
coconut juice fast

266
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,080
you're going to be running on adrenaline

267
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,880
it's not going to be enough

268
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,240
calories to allow you to function so

269
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,880
then your adrenals are going to be

270
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,560
flooding

271
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,399
is what's going to happen all right so

272
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,320
let's take the adrenals out for a second

273
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,680
and take a look at those babies

274
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:04,399
right now which i'm doing

275
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,839
right here now you might be somebody

276
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,760
that's like

277
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:13,600
you know what i'm going to outsmart aw

278
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,800
i'm an outsmart aw i'm going to do

279
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,800
and i'm not saying that's what you're

280
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,760
doing you know you're trying to outsmart

281
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,720
me but there's a lot of people they're

282
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,040
going to be like i'm going to outsmart

283
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,959
him

284
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,360
i'm just going to do a cleanse i looked

285
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,560
up some juice fast somewhere

286
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,240
i know that's not what you're doing but

287
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,279
you know someone else might right and

288
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,640
then we'd be like

289
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,000
you know this mono-eating cleanse is

290
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,440
cool but i'm going to go and do i'm

291
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,560
going to really try to detox and what

292
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,120
you're going to do

293
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,080
is you're going to try to detox but

294
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,680
you're going to make yourself

295
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,600
toxic you're going to fill yourself up

296
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,040
adrenaline so what happens is the minute

297
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,399
you start going into this

298
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:47,760
long-term juice fast or long-term

299
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,720
water fast or long-term coconut water

300
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,640
fast

301
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,920
you're going to end up hitting the wall

302
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,360
you're not going to have enough glucose

303
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,200
for your brain and your brain is going

304
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,040
to be like i'm starving with glucose i'm

305
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,200
starving the glucose and your adrenals

306
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,800
are going to release adrenaline

307
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,959
and you're going to just saturate your

308
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,519
liver with adrenaline

309
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,320
that's not going to be productive at all

310
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,040
it's not

311
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,200
the mono eating cleanse you actually eat

312
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,880
and you cleanse but you eat and you

313
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,519
protect yourself

314
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,959
you protect your adrenals you see guys

315
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,440
how important that is

316
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,120
you protect your adrenals the minute

317
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,040
someone wants to be like ah

318
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,959

322
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,600
adrenaline

323
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,079
you're gonna starve your brain of

324
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,959
glucose coconut water doesn't

325
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,600
have enough glucose in it there's not

326
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,640
enough

327
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,839
sugar in it to feed your brain while

328
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,640
you're functioning

329
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,760
but yeah it's great but you know it's

330
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,120
not enough

331
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,519

spinach's lettuce

479
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,079
all depends on how sensitive you are

480
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,920
right you're somebody with

481
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:15,600
really bad crohn's colitis

482
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:17,839
right real bad intestinal problems

483
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,720
you've had surgeries already things like

484
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,800
that

485
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,240
then you just you you don't want to eat

486
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,360
a lot of the spinach of something you're

487
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,360
not used to

488
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,279
something that you're not used to doing

489
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,800
okay

490
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,560
but if you're somebody that doesn't have

491
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,160
anything you know serious going around

492
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,440

493
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,480

00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,240
hypersensitive

495
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,800
all those kinds of things sure you can

496
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:42,000

497
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,680
teresa lettuce what does lettuce do for

498
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,800
us

499
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,440
it's got a chemical compound that

500
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,839
creates

501
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:55,519
this kind of milk right lettuce milk

502
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:58,959

that lettuce milk

505
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,640
is really soothing and gentle on the

506
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:10,160
intestinal tract

507
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:12,559
lining okay that's what's amazing about

508
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:17,839
using the lettuce for this

509
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:20,720
right lettuce is antiviral anti-pathogen

510
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:21,919
lettuce is anti-fungus the bad fungus

511
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,039
anti-mold

512
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,160
anti-yeast okay so that's what lettuce

513
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:29,120
is

514
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:31,440
a couple of things plus it's got the

515
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:34,640
mineral salts as well different kinds

516
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:37,120
kimberly heiner what if you're allergic

517
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,799
to celery

518
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,559
look if you're somebody that you eat a

519
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,760
celery stick your throat closes up and

520
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:47,120
you're up at the er

521
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:51,440
then don't touch celery don't touch it

522
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:53,200
right um but do you mean can i can i

523
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,559
just have you be your own detective

524
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,720
if that's okay can you be your own

525
00:17:54,559 --> 00:18:00,320
detective for a second

526
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:02,799
right do you mean you're allergic

527
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:05,840
because someone said you are

528
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:08,080
but when you eat celery you're fine

529
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:10,160
so you've had celery before you've had

530
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,880
it chopped up in a tuna salad you've had

531
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,960
it

532
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,480
chopped up in tuna fish sandwich you had

533
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,679
a crudite one time in your life but you

534
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,480
had no problems

535
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,720
or is it something where you're allergic

536
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,120
to celery because you had that all cat

537
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,799
test

538
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,559
you had a food sensitivity test and

539
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,760
there were 20 foods in there and they're

540
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:30,880
like celery

541
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:32,799
uh ragweed uh uh peppercorns uh

542
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,080
you know strawberry and you had this

543
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,600
thing where it was like

544
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,280
all these things they're telling you

545
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,080
allergic to but yeah you didn't have a

546
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,720
problem

547
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,240
first of all i don't trust a single one

548
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,760
of those tests if a family member went

549
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,640
and got any of those food sensitivities

550
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,320
tests i would

551
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,000
just i would be like i don't trust any

552
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,240
any one of those at all because

553
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,039
it's a scam all of that but if you're

554
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,600
somebody that

555
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,880
your mouth swells up because you eat a

556
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,280
celery stick

557
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,400
or you're now something happens you

558
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,840

00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:13,599
incredible doctor see the little cut out

993
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,800
here

994
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:18,159
see where i flip this there's a little

995
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:20,720
cut out here the potato is just starting

996
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,240
to send out a little sprout

997
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:24,240
you could see it was a white little

998
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:26,800
sprout poking out of it

999
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:28,800
you cut those little white sprouts off

1000
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:33,040
if your potatoes now

1001
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:36,280
blooming yeah those are too far gone

1002
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:40,240
too far gone so if your potatoes are

1003
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:42,960
sprouting like blooming

1004
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:44,399
like flowers it looks like almost you're

1005
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,639
too far gone

1006
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:48,079
potatoes too far gone okay this was just

1007
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,000
where you saw them they were sprouting

1008
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:51,839
out a little bit little white sprout

1009
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,839
and i just kind of like took the knife

1010
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,720
and i just took took the little pieces

1011
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:56,320
off

1012
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:58,160
the best potatoes are the ones that

1013
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,000
aren't sprouting but i'm just saying you

1014
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,760
can if they're just starting to send out

1015
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,520
sprouts yeah you can literally take the

1016
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,680
little pieces off that's what i did

1017
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,280
but if it's actually shooting out like

1018
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,720
starting to grow and starting to look

1019
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,119
like it's it's out of control no you

1020

but no you don't want that in the

1044
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,000
monopoles there's a reason why it's the

1045
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:55,079
mono cleanse

1046
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:58,640
when you simplify you guys

1047
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:59,520
simplify you heal faster in different

1048
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,680
ways

1049
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:03,760
in different ways it's not like the

1050
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,440
heavy metal detox movie pulls the metals

1051
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:08,000
out so you can heal that way

1052
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,960
but this does something else medical

1053
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,960
medium tools

1054
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,400
all the different medical medium tools

1055
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,000
do different things

1056
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,640
i'm just going to repeat this is so

1057
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,040
important spirit of compassion is making

1058
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,960
sure

1059
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:24,240
i run this by you right now okay

1060
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:26,160
making sure that you simplify is a way

1061
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,760
to heal certain aspects of the body

1062
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:30,480
especially digestion

1063
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,760
it's a great way to heal right but

1064
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,400
medical medium tools

1065
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,119
do different things that's important to

1066
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,720
know they do

1067
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:38,640
different things the mono cleanse does

1068
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,359
different things and when we incorporate

1069
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,000
when we do

1070
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:43,680
different strategies to healing we can

1071
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,359
knock out all kinds of stuff

1072
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:48,160
a lot of people that heal with medical

1073
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:49,920
medium they'll get rid of 30 symptoms

1074
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,839
but yet they're stuck with a few

1075
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,280
symptoms left but they didn't try other

1076
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:54,720
medical medium tools

1077
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,960
they didn't all of a sudden go and then

1078
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,640
do the mono eating to get rid of those

1079
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,800
other three symptoms because

1080
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:02,800
different tools in the medical medium

1081
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,520

i'm so addicted listen to the medical

1114
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,680
mean podcast at apple podcast listen to

1115
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,400
the

1116
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,280
coffee matcha tea chocolate episode

1117
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,440
because

1118
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,040
you know it's no it's sad i don't mean

1119
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,320
to change a topic but i want to respect

1120
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,359
what you're talking about you know

1121
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,720
what's sad

1122
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:23,760
is the caffeine industry has every

1123
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:25,359
like almost every woman on this planet

1124
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,880
addicted to their drug to the

1125
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:29,520
psychoactive drug it's an

1126
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,880
evil prank played on women and almost

1127
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:33,520
every man

1128
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,800
and i talk about this it's horrible the

1129
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:37,599
caffeine industry just

1130
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,040
robs and steals people's chances to heal

1131
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:41,839
it just robs their adrenals

1132
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:44,839
ages them fast and no one's held

1133
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:47,440
accountable for it this caffeine is so

1134
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:48,160
bad one reason why the mono cleanse is

1135
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,400
so healing

1136
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:52,560
it gets us off of these things i love

1137
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,640
the chemtrail podcast i see on tick tock

1138
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:56,880
so you love the chemtrail podcast

1139
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:59,119
oh god i love that episode i listen to

1140
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,359
it every so often

1141
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:02,400
medical mean podcast up about kathy

1142
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:04,400
joyce says

1143
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,560
what about the recommended supplements

1144
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:11,359
during mono cleanse

1145
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:12,400
right well here's the whole thing right

1146
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:14,000
if you want to keep some of the

1147
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,720
supplements you can just maybe lower

1148
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,480
them down a little bit maybe do half

1149
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,920
but it depends someone might be on the

1150
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,520
worst supplements out there

1151
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,119
you want to read the chapter in the

1152
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,960
supplements chapter of cleanse to feel

1153
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:27,280
you want to read that for sure

1154
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,880
so i just put papaya in there and i'm

1155
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,320

1158
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,560
papaya right down to the skin if you

1159
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:36,880

1239
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,800
cleanse it's good to kind of just

1240
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,000
you know take a break on everything for

1241
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,119
a little bit but of course

1242
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,960
here's the other thing we're not at it

1243
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:20,880
just keep this in mind okay and this is

1244
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,240
for everybody that's listening right now

1245
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,839
you might be somebody that wants to

1246
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,480
curtail it your own way and you want to

1247
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:26,560
use one

1248
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,160
one medical medium tool like your heavy

1249
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:29,760
metal detox smoothie and you still want

1250
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,520
to mono eat a little bit we'll just join

1251
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,440
them together than if you need to and

1252
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,960
curtail it customize it the way you want

1253
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,920
and that's okay too

1254
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,280
keep that in mind right that it's okay

1255
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,960
if you want to customize the medical

1256
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,240
medium tools and kind of mix them a

1257
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:44,240
little bit if you really

1258
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:46,079
you really want your metal heavy metal

1259
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:48,000
detox smoothie for the next three days

1260
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:49,359
but you want to do mono eating then do

1261
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,119
you do your smoothie and you do your

1262
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:52,319
model eating later on and you kind of do

1263
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:53,839
try to balance it out

1264
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:55,760
and that's okay if that's what you want

1265
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:57,680
to do but it's geared for you know

1266
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,880
also doing a certain type of cleansing

1267
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,160
and it's different too on tick-tock

1268
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:04,160
jimmy's got a question

1269
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:04,160
i'm not sure what is it uh

1270
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:11,599
let's see i'm truly grateful for all

1271
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:15,119
this information

1272
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:17,920
i was skeptical at first and feel great

1273
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:19,280
only two weeks wow jimmy i get it if

1274
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,599
you're skeptical at first

1275
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:24,000
i get it totally get it i think what

1276
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:25,920
happens is that

1277
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,240
i'm really glad you got past the whole

1278
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:30,319
thing out there where people do the

1279
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:31,920
spiritual discrimination against me you

1280
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:32,640
know because the information work comes

1281
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,960
from but

1282
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,680
the irony is medical medium information

1283
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,359
is like

1284
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,880
science research is stealing it left and

1285
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:40,240
right right now podcast doctors are

1286
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,520
stealing it left and right trying to

1287
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:44,240
call it their own

1288
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,880
and science is actually trying to even

1289
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,640
prove

1290
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,000
using medical media information certain

1291
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:50,000
things about diseases medical medium

1292
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,040
information is the most forefront most

1293
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,599
advanced

1294
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:55,280
in in anything with chronic illness we

1295

00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:35,280
keep the salt keep the seasonings out

1568
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:39,280
very important to know

1569
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:41,520
all right we've got some peas in the pan

1570
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:43,200
drink approximately one liter of water

1571
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:45,119
throughout the entire day

1572
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:47,839
you can also have some coconut water as

1573
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:47,839
an option too

1574
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:53,359
don't do the pink coconut water you just

1575
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:55,920
got scammed

1576
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:57,520
pink and red coconut water stay away

1577
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:59,440
from it it's rancid

1578
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:01,200
and the trick of the trade was to tell

1579
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:03,599
you it was better for you and that

1580
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:05,359
you're lucky if you got a pink coconut

1581
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:07,040
water no you just got screwed if you got

1582
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:09,599
a pin coconut water

1583
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:12,000
essie says i am 100 agree with anthony

1584
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:14,559
because majority of the doctors are in

1585
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,359
into celery juice now the same doctors

1586
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:18,960
were the ones

1587
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:22,640
demonizing him one once upon a time

1588
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:24,880
the story goes like this medical medium

1589
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:26,720
comes out with advanced information

1590
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:28,160
for 35 years in the health field and

1591
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:30,880
then medical medium

1592
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:31,839
just gets spit on and totally you know

1593
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:36,079
messed with

1594
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:38,400
and you know poo-pooed and demoralized

1595
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:40,000
demonized right when it's all

1596
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,440
life-saving information

1597
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,960
medical medium information has saved

1598
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:44,799
more lives around the world of chronic

1599
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:47,440
illness than anybody

1600
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:48,960
in history any doctor any diet belief

1601
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:51,280
system whatever

1602
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:52,960
and now yeah they're forced to use

1603
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:54,559
celery juice because they know they've

1604
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:56,319
got to get results and you know what the

1605
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:58,079
sad part is

1606
00:54:56,319 --> 00:55:00,160
can we use iceberg lettuce yes you can

1607
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:01,680
if that's all you got absolutely you can

1608
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:03,359
you know what the sad part is that was

1609
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:06,000
on tick tock that question

1610
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:08,480
is here's what's going to happen they

1611
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,160
bro they let celery juice in the gate

1612
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:11,920
right but they still don't like medical

1613
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:13,520
mediums some of these doctors right

1614
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:15,599
a lot of them do like medical mediums

1615
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:16,480
some don't right they let celery juice

1616
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:18,079
in the gate

1617
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:20,079
check this out you guys and then they

1618
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:22,960
give those patients all their crappy

1619
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:24,000
garbage and the patients are actually

1620
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,760
hanging in there

1621
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,200
or getting a little bit of a benefit

1622
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:28,960
because celery juice is

1623
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:30,880
cleaning up the mess that the doctor's

1624
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:32,640
giving them all the other crap and

1625
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:35,440
garbage that doesn't get them better

1626
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:36,000
the celery juice is keeping them afloat

1627
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:39,200

1660
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:42,079
still healing and cleansing

1661
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:44,079
question on tick tock do you have

1662
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:46,400
anything in the pan

1663
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:47,520
with the peas water no you know why

1664
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:49,520
these are frozen

1665
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:51,280
peas they already have the kind of like

1666
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:52,799
that moisture around them

1667
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:55,119
and i'm just letting them just cook up

1668
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:57,280
real quick no water in the pan

1669
00:56:55,119 --> 00:57:00,240
no i don't need it no need it they're

1670
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,240
almost almost done

1671
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:06,000
i think drinking celery killed my

1672
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:08,240
saw something i think drinking celery

1673
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,400
killed killed something

1674
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:11,359
killed your craving that's what it was

1675
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:13,440
killed your craving

1676
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:14,640
yep 32 ounces of celery juice can kill

1677
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:16,240
the cravings it can

1678
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:18,720
mineral salts and i'll tell you why

1679
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:21,920
there's two things that kill cravings

1680
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:23,599
okay trace mineral salts which

1681
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:25,520
is the most abundant source on the plant

1682
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:27,280
into celery juice

1683
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:28,559
they go to the brain these trace mineral

1684
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:30,000
assaults keep that in mind

1685
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:32,720
i'm gonna take the brain out of my dummy

1686
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:35,680
real quick are you guys okay with that

1687
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:37,520
okay i got the brain out of my dummy

1688
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:39,520
right

1689
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:40,799
two things the brain runs on keep this

1690
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:43,520
in mind and

1691
00:57:40,799 --> 00:57:45,440
one of them is not protein two things

1692
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:48,559
the brain runs on

1693
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:51,119
trace mineral salts

1694
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:52,400
and what's the other you guys i forgot i

1695
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:53,119
don't even remember what's the other

1696
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:54,960
guys

1697
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:57,280
you know i'm messing with you you guys

1698
00:57:54,960 --> 00:58:00,319
remember glucose

1699
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:01,520
sugar your brain runs on sugar or trace

1700
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:04,960
mineral salts

1701
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:06,559
both it runs on both right it doesn't

1702
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:09,119
run on protein

1703
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:09,760
but look out for the protein zombies

1704
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:12,960
right

1705
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:14,480
protein protein protein protein

1706
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:16,319

1708
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:19,599
protein can't live without protein

self-destruct self-destruct

1712
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,359
self-destruct protein robots

1713
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:24,880
self-destruct

1714
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:26,640

1716
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:28,960
simple

1717
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:30,400
cheaper where's my protein sheeple

1718
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:31,760

1719
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,599
here where's the protein shoot sheep

1720
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:35,119
sheeps protein protein birthday protein

1721
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:37,839
we need a protein more sheep more sheep

1722
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:37,839
we need a protein

1723
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:43,760
all right sure a few or a few of you are

1724
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:46,880
like

1725
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:46,880
not gonna get his book now

1726
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:51,839

1728
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:58,240
mr robot on tick-tock

1729
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:04,960
thank you very much mr roboto thank you

1730
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:10,480
very much chris

1731
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:10,480
all right get these peas done

1732
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:19,760
anthony can you talk about salts

1733
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:22,319
so can you talk about salt and celery

1734
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:24,559
juice i've been doing it for a while

1735
00:59:22,319 --> 00:59:25,920
but my husband i guess we do some

1736
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:29,680
research and told

1737
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:33,119
me yesterday that salts can be an issue

1738
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:36,559
but i trust you road salt's the issue

1739
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:38,880
so road salt right

1740
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:40,880
added salt is the issue you want to add

1741
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:43,200
salt that's the issue

1742
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:44,720
sodium cluster salts in celery juice are

1743
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:46,960
a complete electrolyte

1744
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:49,200
it's not salt and that's where science

1745
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:50,960
is just totally messed up

1746
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:52,559
if you believe in science says

1747
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:54,799
everything science says everything

1748
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:56,720
science is 100 right about anything then

1749
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:58,000
then if someone believes that way and i

1750
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:58,960
know you guys don't but if someone

1751
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,599
believes that way

1752
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:03,280
they get they get in trouble because

1753
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:04,960
once you get sick and you're sick

1754
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:06,960
science is just not there anymore they

1755
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:08,400
don't catch you you fall backwards you

1756
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:10,720
think science is gonna catch you

1757
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:12,000
you fall backwards i'm gonna okay

1758
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:14,000
science

1759
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,440
science you'll catch me don't worry

1760
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
science and research you'll catch me

1761
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,760
right

1762
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:20,400

01:06:24,799 --> 01:06:28,480
this food processor so i can show you

1910
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:33,839
guys what's up

1911
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:33,839
what is going on

1912
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:38,319
now i got this beautiful pea hummus

1913
01:06:36,799 --> 01:06:40,319
right here

1914
01:06:38,319 --> 01:06:44,400
i eat too much sugar anthony from your

1915
01:06:40,319 --> 01:06:47,119
cleanse and my candida is out of control

1916
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:48,400
emma well you know what happens is that

1917
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:50,079
it's it's like this okay

1918
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:54,000
no one taught you about the candida

1919
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:56,160
thing anyway so that's one thing

1920
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,200
so you mean you ate bananas because

1921
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:59,599
bananas kill

1922
01:06:57,200 --> 01:07:01,440
anything that's bad in our systems you

1923
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:04,559
mean you ate papaya

1924
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:08,079
is that what you mean because what

1925
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:09,920
feeds candida meaning bad stuff because

1926
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:11,520
candida is not even the bad thing

1927
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:14,400
so just a couple of things i got to run

1928
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:17,440
by anybody who who doesn't understand

1929
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:19,280
candida anybody that says any kind of

1930
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:20,720
practitioner doctor says you got candida

1931
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:23,599
doesn't know anything about

1932
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:25,760
anything in my opinion because first of

1933
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:28,240
all candida is the beneficial fungus

1934
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:31,359
that you're not supposed to kill

1935
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:33,280
so if you kill candida then the bad

1936
01:07:31,359 --> 01:07:36,319
fungus takes over

1937
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:39,000
so you we only thrive

1938
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:40,240
because of candida candida is how

1939
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:43,280
transference

1940
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:44,880
of some nutrients get into your body

1941
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:46,400
because there's the candida is the

1942
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:49,680
beneficial fungus

1943
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:52,400
that actually converts and transfers

1944
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:53,920
nutrients when you kill all your candida

1945
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:57,119
off

1946
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:58,480
you can get so sick you can die so when

1947
01:07:57,119 --> 01:08:00,240
all these fancy doctors and

1948
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:01,920
practitioners and people are like trying

1949
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:03,280
to kill off your candida what real

1950
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:04,160
people don't realize is they're trying

1951
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:06,880
to kill you

1952
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:08,559
without them knowing because you don't

1953
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:10,640
want to get rid of your candida you get

1954
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:12,319
rid of your candida you're on a fast

1955
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:13,839
track the worst deficiencies on the

1956
01:08:12,319 --> 01:08:15,520
planet and the worst efficiencies

1957
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:16,719
anybody's ever seen and i've seen that

1958
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:17,759
i've seen people go through all these

1959
01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:19,520
candida cleanses

1960
01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:21,440
all these candida protocols and

1961
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:23,199
literally have nothing left

1962
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:25,199
that gets so many deficiencies

1963
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:26,000
everything just falls apart now listen

1964
01:08:25,199 --> 01:08:27,679
to your doctor

1965
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,279
if your doctor says you have candida

1966
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:30,560
listen to your doctor do it your doctor

1967
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:32,000
tells you if your doctor doesn't want

1968
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:35,600
you to do

1969
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:37,920
you know a banana then don't do it right

1970
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:39,120
and the other you know so that's

1971
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:41,759
important to know

1972
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:43,120

01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:17,280
cleanse

2025
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:19,280
and you're getting rid of those fats and

2026
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:21,040
you stopped your coffee and you stopped

2027
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:24,080
your chocolate and you stopped your

2028
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:25,520
your the junk you're on right then

2029
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:27,199
you're gonna just start getting rid of

2030
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:29,679
stuff and you stopped your vinegar

2031
01:10:27,199 --> 01:10:32,159
you're gonna start getting rid of stuff

2032
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:32,800
right and then another thing too is like

2033
01:10:32,159 --> 01:10:36,080
i said

2034
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:38,159
i watched women die over the years

2035
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:40,080
because they were candida cleansed to

2036
01:10:38,159 --> 01:10:42,239
death because what happened was

2037
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:44,000
they went all through the 80s and 1990s

2038
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:46,159
when the candida scare happened

2039
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:48,239
and they were literally killed off these

2040
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:50,719
women were killed off

2041
01:10:48,239 --> 01:10:52,640
because they ran cleansers through their

2042
01:10:50,719 --> 01:10:54,719
intestinal tract to kill off candida and

2043
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:56,400
they removed all their beneficial fungus

2044
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:58,800
and then these women died

2045
01:10:56,400 --> 01:11:00,880
thousands of women died in the 1980s and

2046
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:02,320
1990s and early 2000s from candida

2047
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:04,080
cleansing

2048
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:05,840
thousands of women died they lost their

2049
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:08,880
lives their bodies fell apart

2050
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:10,080
everything just fell apart because of a

2051
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:11,760
thrush you know because

2052
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:13,520
they were told they had candida thrush

2053
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:15,120
and they were put on protocols

2054
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:16,719
they were put on all kinds of thrush

2055
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:17,760
protocols and these protocols and that

2056
01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:20,239
protocols and

2057
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:21,679
it was to try to clear out the candida

2058
01:11:20,239 --> 01:11:23,440
and what happened was

2059
01:11:21,679 --> 01:11:25,360
they lost all their candida all right

2060
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:27,760
and they died and they died

2061
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:28,719
the ones that lived the the cleanses

2062
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:30,239
didn't do

2063
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:31,840
didn't clear out and kill all of their

2064
01:11:30,239 --> 01:11:32,880
candida thank god because that's how

2065
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:36,719
they lived through

2066
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:38,159
it okay so yeah there you go

2067
01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:40,400

i'm telling you right now you know uh

2110
01:12:56,400 --> 01:13:00,560
jimmy i'm telling you right now

2111
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,600
i've seen women die from that candida

2112
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:04,800
about you know trying to knock the

2113
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:06,719
candida out and i've seen

2114
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:08,320
thousands of women that died in the 80s

2115
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:10,400
and 90s and early 2000s from that

2116
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:12,159
candida crap

2117
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:13,840
it's so sad i don't even know what to

2118
01:13:12,159 --> 01:13:17,280
say let's see

2119
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:20,800
emma i tried i tried 369 which helped

2120
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:24,159
but still suffering still stuff

2121
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:26,159
still suffering from thrush what happens

2122
01:13:24,159 --> 01:13:28,560
is this okay

2123
01:13:26,159 --> 01:13:29,679
if someone's got thrush take the book to

2124
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:31,120
your doctor

2125
01:13:29,679 --> 01:13:33,760
find the doctor take the book to your

2126
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:35,040
doctor right take a look at the sibo

2127
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:37,040
protocol okay

2128
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:38,719
that's what i would do take a look at

2129
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:41,040
the sibo protocol

2130
01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:42,719
so if i was somebody and i had thrush

2131
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:45,600
which is streptococcus

2132
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:47,360
right with streptococcus and you know

2133
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:49,280
what happens is the 369

2134
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:51,520
is getting you better but how many times

2135
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:52,400
did you do the 369 you could do 369

2136
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:54,400
advanced

2137
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:56,400
like if it was me i would do 369

2138
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:58,480
advanced over and over again

2139
01:13:56,400 --> 01:14:00,239
that's one thing i would do i would also

2140
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:02,000
take a look at the strep protocol

2141
01:14:00,239 --> 01:14:03,360
ask your doctor what's right for you and

2142
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,960
what your doctor says

2143
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:06,400
that's who you listen to do not listen

2144
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:08,320
to me i'm just telling you that

2145
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:10,159
what i would do for myself or my loved

2146
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:11,760
ones and my family okay

2147
01:14:10,159 --> 01:14:13,440
that's what i would do i'd make sure all

2148
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:14,000
my supplements didn't have the alcohol

2149
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:15,280
in them didn't

2150
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,560
have all the garbage in them i'd make

2151
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:17,920
sure they were recommended medical

2152
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:20,960
medium supplements

2153
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:22,960
i would also i would also make sure that

2154
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:24,960
um i was doing the strep protocol or

2155
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:27,120
flip it to the sibo protocol

2156
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:29,040
i'd be doing the advanced cleanse 369

2157
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:30,640
i'd be doing the mono eating cleanse

2158
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:32,719
probably the potato monowing cleanses

2159
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:34,239
what i would be doing this is what i

2160
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:36,080
you know i would do ask your doctor

2161
01:14:34,239 --> 01:14:37,360
what's right for you don't listen to me

2162
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:38,960

2167
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:48,159
