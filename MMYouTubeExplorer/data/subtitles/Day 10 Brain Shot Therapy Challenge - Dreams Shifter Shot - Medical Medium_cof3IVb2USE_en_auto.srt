past

164
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:10,680
here's the thing with SOC everything SOC

165
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:13,380
has done and given to me in information

166
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,759
throughout the years has literally been

167
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:17,400
true

168
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:18,900
Advanced information the science of

169
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,979
research is stealing and poaching from

170
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,599
the medical medium books that are

171
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:23,759
published and believe me my Publishers

172
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,220
knows this and sees it

173
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,139
they see the the plagiarizing out there

174
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:31,020
and the stealing and the thefting right

175
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:32,639
of the mm books but what's incredible is

176
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:34,259
Spirit of compassion

177
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,539
has always been right with the

178
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:38,039
information and people have gotten their

179
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:39,479
lives back out of wheelchairs they've

180
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:41,099
gotten rid of the brain fog they've

181
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:42,599
gotten rid of terrible gut problems

182
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:45,599
they've gotten rid of so many things

183
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:48,360
that it's always true so when I read the

184
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:51,060

185
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,620

00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:55,560
um the first thing that hits me is like

187
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,520
oh my God you can learn from your Soul's

188
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:00,000
past

189
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:02,160
through the dream shifter

190
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,919
think about that for a second

191
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:07,139
you want to use your dreams as a gateway

192
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:08,759
to understand your soul and your Soul's

193
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:10,620
past is that not the most mind-blowing

194
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:12,900
thing you've ever heard or is it just me

195
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:14,699
and for some reason I think that way and

196
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,620
I'm like oh that's the most mind-blowing

197
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:19,080
thing I've ever heard like

198
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:22,039
and it's just me or do you guys think

199
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,039
that's mind-blowing

200
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,440
corny M.A says the book blows my mind

201
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,139
Hey you made this live just now

202
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,419
incredible usually you're working right

203
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:32,640
you want to use your dreams as a gateway

204
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:34,740
to understand your soul and your Soul's

205
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,839
Passover let me tell you right there how

206
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:40,979
powerful that is because your Soul's

207
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:43,080
past is before this lifetime so think

208
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:46,140
about that for a second

209
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:49,820
the dream shifter helps us to understand

210
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:55,019
if we want that direction

211
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:56,760
what information from the Soul's past

212
00:08:55,019 --> 00:09:00,000
is about

213
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:02,040
that means your soul before this

214
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,740
Lifetime right here

215
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:06,320
before your soul

216
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:10,140
ended up

217
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:12,180
magically appearing in the womb

218
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:15,000
think about this

219
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:17,459
okay how about this one now okay you're

220
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,260
having difficulty dreaming and wanted

221
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:21,959
dreams so many people I know that they

222
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:24,420
have a difficult time dreaming they want

223
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:27,839
to dream but they can't

224
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:30,420
Erica Malik says the dream shifter gave

225
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:33,720
me such vivid dreams I've always been

226
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:36,200
really connected to my dreams this shot

227
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:39,899
amplifies that on a whole other level

228
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:43,140
that's just incredible

229
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:44,880
here's one right here too okay Lana says

230
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:47,459
these shots have already changed my

231
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:50,160
brain and I can't wait to see where this

232
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:53,820
journey takes me Lana

233
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:57,420
these shots absolutely are miraculous

234
00:09:53,820 --> 00:10:00,480
and they have the ability to turn lives

235
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:02,279
around in such a way but don't stop the

236
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,320
other medical medium tools even though

237
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:06,180
you can do this tool without doing the

238
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,320
other tools you still you still have to

239
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,120
learn the books and the information

240
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,680
there's so many important tools for

241
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,839
different conditions and symptoms all of

242
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,640
it with these brain shots it's a whole

243
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:16,260
nother level oh my God especially if

244
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,320
you're doing other medical medium tools

245
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:22,320

246
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:25,560
dream shifter uh oh really incredible I

clarity I had repeated dream

251
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:39,839
from the other night but was introduced

252
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:43,260
with gentleness and not aggression

253
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:46,620
aggressive peppermint makes drink really

254
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:49,140
nice too that's incredible I love that

255
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:50,640
I've been using the dreams shifter

256
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:53,579
periodically

257
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,980
I already have some really really crazy

258
00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:59,459
dreams and the spirit of compassion

259
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:01,980
talks to me in my sleep on top of it and

260
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:04,620
since I was a child I had the ability to

261
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:07,260
enter someone else's dream

262
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:09,779
and then do things like that and so the

263
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:14,360
dream shifter is actually even giving me

264
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:14,360
more of an ampage with my dream state

265
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:18,300
I haven't been sleeping that many hours

266
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,519
lately because I'm keeping up with a

267
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:22,500
billion times work of all this stuff

268
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:24,120

269
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,500

275
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,820

you go on and this is so funny right

283
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:52,200
before I go live

284
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:54,420
I take the celery Force

285
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:57,360
and I take the Gaba

286
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:59,880
that's what I do right before I go live

287
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,680
every time before I go live these are

288
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:04,860
the two things I take and that's the

289
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,240
Bemidji I mean I won't take another Gaba

290
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:08,760
from anywhere else because I don't trust

291
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,279
it and I won't take obviously there is

292
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,779
no such thing as this anywhere else it's

293
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,820
the beverages stuff to sell the reports

294
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:16,560
I don't know if you guys ever tried it

295
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:19,680
but see that's the Bemidji stuff you

296
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:22,800
know V as in Victor i m e r g y.com but

297
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,959
that's what I take right before I go

298
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,060
live after I've already been up since

299
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:29,040
five in the morning I've already had you

300
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:31,079
guys like four meetings

301
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,420
and I've been working and then I got to

302
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:34,860
get ready in here and everything so but

303
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,959
you guys know I've endorsed these guys

304
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:38,579
because of the four reasons the four

305
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,899
unbelievable reasons son endorse these

306
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:41,640
guys

307
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:43,440
um but anyway

308
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,060
and friend my friend wanted me to tell

309
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,760
you he's like why don't you tell them

310
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:49,920
what you do right before you go live

311
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:52,019
anyway so okay let's go back to this

312
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:56,820
dream shifter

313
00:12:52,019 --> 00:13:00,000
your dreams are troubling very stressful

314
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:02,279
or even frightening

315
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,560
so your dreams are troubling

316
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:06,300
stressful or frightening that's when you

317
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,880
have to say hey you know what I'm gonna

318
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:10,740
get into the dream shifter

319
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,200
I'm gonna work on the dream shifter

320
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:15,480
let's do it let's get it in me

321
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:19,320
here's one right here you ready you want

322
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:23,100
to decode the meaning of your dreams and

323
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:26,579
gain more insight into your dreams

324
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:27,839
that's a reason all on its own to do the

325
00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:31,139
dream shifter

326
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:34,200
you want to decode the meaning of your

327
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:35,639
dreams how incredible is that gain more

328
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,040
insight

329
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:41,519
into your dreams that alone is really

330
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:43,860
powerful okay here's another one too

331
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,480
if your dreams are waking you up did you

332
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:48,000
ever have dreams that wait woke you up

333
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,620
like the dream is waking you up and you

334
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,920
need your sleep but the dream wakes you

335
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:57,300
up that's another reason why to do this

336
00:13:52,920 --> 00:14:00,360
so Jackie says I take celery for us when

337
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:02,760
I'm really sleepy and I need to be awake

338
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:05,220
it's great incredible I'm glad you I'm

339
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:06,720
glad you use it it's it's I rely on it I

340
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:09,120
actually rely on it

341
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:12,060
Marge just says what Gaba and cellular

342
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,100
Force are you what are you doing for you

343
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:15,959
well it's the Imaging

344
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:18,000
so

345
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:21,899
that's the Gaba right there it's V as in

346
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,579
Victor I Amazon Mary e r g y.com

347
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:25,920
I endorsed them because of the four

348
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:27,720
reasons so the four reasons are

349
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,040
mind-blowing I don't have time to talk

350
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,480
about it though but there's four

351
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,100
incredible reasons that nobody does

352
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,959
nobody has

353
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,820
Lucas says I know celery force is

354
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:37,079
amazing it totally is it's actually

355
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:39,060
probably

356
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:40,500
when people don't realize like for me in

357
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:45,240
my personal life some of the things that

358
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:48,959
I do and and like celery Force I rely on

359
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:50,579
it's how I survive a day that's how I

360
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,260
feel it's the craziest thing because I

361
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:54,240
wake up at four or five in the morning I

362
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:55,620
go all the way till midnight I try to

363
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,420
get three or four hours of sleep but if

364
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:59,459
it's really heavy duty work time

365
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:01,019
schedule I'll get two hours of sleep one

366
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:03,720
hour sometimes when I did the book it

367
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:06,360
was like barely any Pamela says on

368
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:10,040
YouTube I've been buying the demorgy and

work better

382
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:42,959
I rely on it I actually use it as a

383
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:45,120
crutch I mean I don't have to use it but

384
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,620
I use it as a crutch to push harder

385
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,339
because

386
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:53,339

387
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:57,300
is I wanna see because I burn the candle

00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:59,339
four ends so then I do the cheat and I

389
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:02,480
use the celery Force so I could burn the

390
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:04,920
candle at five ends because because

391
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,260

452
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,320
since I was younger that I had that

453
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:19,440
ability to do that

454
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:21,240

it unlocks like how does the dream

457
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:28,980
shifter even work in here in the Noggin

458
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:30,419
and so that would be so cool you're

459
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,580
trying to reach others through your

460
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:34,320
dreams how cool is that

461
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:36,720
here's one right here

462
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:39,900
you're trying to enter other people's

463
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:42,660
dreams you got that one right we talked

464
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:45,179
about that you're not sleeping enough

465
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:47,460
this shot can help you heal through your

466
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:49,080
dream process in the short amount of

467
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,900
sleep you're getting so if you're not

468
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:54,179
sleeping that much dream shifter's

469
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:56,460
critical because it can help you heal

470
00:18:54,179 --> 00:19:00,059
and do what you need to do in that short

471
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:01,919
amount of sleep you get which is the

472
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:03,840
reason I've been using the dream shifter

473
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,100
for myself personally because I don't

474
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,960
get a lot of sleep because I'm working

475
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:09,419
too many hours I have so many demands

476
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:13,140
and responsibilities it's insane

477
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:15,059
and and because of that you know I get

478
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:17,760
only this amount of sleep I mean to do

479
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:20,220
these two massive Bibles

480
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:23,100
to do these two massive Bibles right

481
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:25,320
here what it took this would take a

482
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,880
health author like seven years in their

483
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,500
life just to get something like this

484
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,240
done and of course it wouldn't be from

485
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,860
information from above it would just be

486
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,760
whatever gathered information from

487
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:36,900
whatever but the point is is I've lost a

488
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,220
lot of sleep because of it it's

489
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:40,799
incredible

490
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:43,020
Lucy Cohn oh my God incredible you're

491
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:45,780

492
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:47,940
night for the challenge and it's helped

493
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:50,340
me fall asleep without needing to be on

494
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:52,559

616
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:54,659
reasons that only a source above could

can figure out

629
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:23,159
that these brain shots are composed of

630
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,960
specific combinations of ingredients

631
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:26,880
working together systematically for

632
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,740
specific reasons that only a source

633
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,960
above could know no one would know that

634
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:32,940

bit to you guys

692
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:03,360
everyday toxins and poisons

693
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:06,539
inside the brain or a large part of the

694
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:10,740
brain limitations we experience

695
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:11,820
we have brain limitations because our

696
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:15,240
brain

697
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:17,279
gets filled with all the poisons and the

698
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:19,080
junk and all the garbage

699
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,940
Brenda said so true what you're saying

700
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,460
aw we've enjoyed watching how they

701
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:24,600
affect my husband

702
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:27,120
amazing because your husband probably

703
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:28,559
doesn't believe right and but but yet

704
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,779
you give it to your husband and it's

705
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:32,760
like there's a profound effect

706
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:34,740
Sarah Anthony these are literally the

707
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:37,380
best books of all time

708
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:39,240
dreamed I had five copies of each that's

709
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:41,539
incredible that's actually the best

710
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,539
dream

00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:46,980

712
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:48,900

and health

715
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:55,740
Evan says is there a dosage or ounces of

716
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,480
the shots that can be given to kids

717
00:28:55,740 --> 00:29:01,520
check out the books and look into it and

718
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,520
you can look into it I honestly

719
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,940
and Christian says the brain shots are

720
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:08,100
going to bring them bring the

721
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:11,039
non-believers to mm info because the

722
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:13,200
results yes that's the whole point

723
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:14,640
we want everybody to heal even somebody

724
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,980
that doesn't believe in it you still

725
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:19,380
want them to heal you still want them to

726
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:21,960
find the information and get better

727
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:24,419
that's what we want

728
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:27,000
everyday toxins and poisons inside the

729
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:29,340
brain are a large part of the brain

730
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,399
limitations we have

731
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:34,860
including emotional limitations

732
00:29:31,399 --> 00:29:37,559
including emotional emotional

733
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:40,620
limitations

734
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:42,600
because of poisons and toxins clouding

735
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:44,340
up our brain

736
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:46,740
you guys see where I'm going the dream

737
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:50,039
shifter I think some of you guys can

738
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:53,279
guess the dream shifter

739
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:55,559
can reroute reset and rewire the brain

740
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:57,179
because the brain's filled with so many

741
00:29:55,559 --> 00:30:00,360
different toxins and poisons that it

742
00:29:57,179 --> 00:30:03,020
clouds up everything we're on page 93 of

743
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,020
brain saver

744
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,380
there

745
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:11,580
if an area of the brain is clouded up

746
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:13,799
with an abundant level of poisons and

747
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:15,720
toxins ranging from toxic heavy metals

748
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:17,279
to solvents to Plastics you guys are

749
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:20,580
like I don't got any of that in my head

750
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:23,760
some of you oh no yeah you do

751
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:25,620
and other petroleum petrochemicals to

752
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:28,140
Pharmaceuticals a lot of people got

753
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:30,299
Pharmaceuticals in their brain they just

754
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:32,659
do they got a lot of pharmaceuticals in

755
00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:32,659
their brain

756
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:37,320
to air fresheners

757
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:38,640
to fragrances the scented candles and

758
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:40,320
Beyond

759
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,840
and that's just theming a few of the

760
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:45,260
toxins and poisons that area of the

761
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,260
brain

762
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:52,799
okay

763
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:55,620
that area of the brain that's clouded

764
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:57,360
with these poisons and toxins the brain

765
00:30:55,620 --> 00:31:00,140
betrayers I call them can almost go into

766
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,140
a sleep mode

767
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:05,940
but you're not sleeping this doesn't

768
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:07,799
mean we'll be sleeping

769
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:09,360
it means an area of our brain is not

770
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:11,340
functioning optimally so that's the

771
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:13,140
whole thing so we walk around

772
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:15,480
where

773
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:18,440
an area of our brain is not functioning

774
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,440
great

775
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:24,960
so a area may not be functioning right

776
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:26,640
another area may not be functioning

777
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:30,240
right different areas in the brain

778
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:31,860
because we have so much stuff in there

779
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,799
this is why the dream shifter is

780
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:36,720
actually really important

781
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:38,340
this is also why

782
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,860
the rest of the medical beam information

783
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:42,600
is also really important too to get rid

784
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:46,340
of a lot of these poisons and toxins

785
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:46,340
including Metals out of our brain

786
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:51,419
so this doesn't mean we'll be sleeping

787
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:54,299
it means an area of our brain is not

788
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:56,159
functioning great so we'll rely more on

789
00:31:54,299 --> 00:31:58,500
other parts of our brain that are less

790
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:00,480
clouded and clogged up with toxins it

791
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:03,980
also means we'll be limited in brain

792
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,980
function here's how it works

793
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:10,200
foreign

794
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:13,440
if we have poisons and toxins in an area

795
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:17,399
in our brain

796
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:19,760
our brain has to rely on another area to

797
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:19,760
function

798
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:26,539
certain areas in our brain

799
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:26,539
go into sleep mode

800
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:31,620
because there's too many poisons and

801
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:33,779
toxins in certain areas

802
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:35,399
so that little bit of tissue in the

803
00:32:33,779 --> 00:32:37,320
brain

804
00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:39,600
where all those neurons are in glial

805
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:41,820
cells

806
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:44,940
dumb down

807
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:47,240
and go into kind of like a non-active

808
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:47,240
mode

809
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:53,940
then our brain

810
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:56,419
has to rely on the areas that actually

811
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:56,419
work

812
00:32:57,179 --> 00:33:02,399
and so a switch happens inside our brain

813
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:05,760
for survival

814
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:07,620
we have to rely on the good parts of our

815
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,840
brain meaning the parts that are not all

816
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:12,720
clouded up and filled with garbage and

817
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:15,659
junk and poisons

818
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:17,340
in order to survive function and fight

819
00:33:15,659 --> 00:33:19,919
our way through every day it's why

820
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:22,140
people are on caffeine

821
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:24,179
parts of their brain aren't quite

822
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:27,120
working so great

823
00:33:24,179 --> 00:33:29,100
so they have to do caffeine

824
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:32,600
to try to push their way through it they

825
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:32,600
have to drug their brain

826
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:40,019
when emotional centers of the brain

827
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:43,440
become filled up and clouded with toxins

828
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:46,919
and poisons we become more reliant on

829
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:49,140
other parts of our brain as a result we

830
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:51,419
can become limited in our emotional

831
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:52,559
understandings of others so what happens

832
00:33:51,419 --> 00:33:55,200
is

833
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:57,179
the more we get filled up with junk and

834
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:00,200
garbage and toxins and poisons inside

835
00:33:57,179 --> 00:34:00,200
our brain tissue

836
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:06,779
the more we lose that understanding

837
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,799
of like what's going on around us so

838
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:12,020
much

839
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:12,020
we don't pick up unsubtleties

840
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:16,919
we end up going into some depression

841
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:20,520
some anxiety some depersonalization

842
00:34:16,919 --> 00:34:22,980
we have a hard time reading things

843
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:24,179
not words but just reading the

844
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:27,980
environment

845
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:27,980
reading others around us

846
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:36,960
we can become Limited in getting in

847
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:39,540
touch with our own emotional state we

848
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,820
can actually have limitations on our own

849
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:43,560
emotional state understanding our own

850
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:46,260
emotional state like why am I doing that

851
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:48,179
how come I'm like this how come I'm

852
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:50,099
getting this diagnosis

853
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:52,440
how come I feel like I have brain fog

854
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:54,419
and brain problems how come I don't

855
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:56,580
understand what that person's saying how

856
00:34:54,419 --> 00:35:00,859
come I'm angry all the time how come I'm

857
00:34:56,580 --> 00:35:00,859
so moody and Confused

858
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,420
Jenny Jenn says it's scary to think

859
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:07,980
about how these chemicals and toxins

860
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:10,440
have changed their personalities and

861
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:11,220
made us less than what we were meant to

862
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:14,119
be

863
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:14,119
it really is

864
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:20,700
we can become Limited in feeling and

865
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:22,740
expressing emotions too too many toxins

866
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:25,859
and poisons in our brain makes it so we

867
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:28,020
have a hard time expressing ourselves

868
00:35:25,859 --> 00:35:29,760
that makes it hard have you ever had

869
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:32,040
that happen in your life where it's a

870
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:34,079
hard time to express yourself and then

871
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:35,900
the other person you're expressing

872
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:37,800
yourself to

873
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:41,480
misunderstands you

874
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:41,480
so you're misunderstood

875
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:46,800
and that's a whole nother thing that

876
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:48,900
could happen

877
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:52,140
we can become Limited in feeling

878
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:54,720
expressing our emotions Limited in

879
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:58,079
harnessing emotions too like harnessing

880
00:35:54,720 --> 00:36:01,079
the emotion like not reacting when we

881
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:02,520
get taken over by the emotion you know

882
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:04,619
when you're just like what did that

883
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:07,140
person do what did that person say to me

884
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:09,720
I've been hurt and it's hard to wrap our

885
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:12,000
heads around it and kind of control that

886
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:13,920
right but yours says oh my God not even

887
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,480
any doctor can explain the way you are

888
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:19,320
doing aw

889
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:21,420
thank you so much for these books

890
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:25,220
I think SOC

891
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:30,720
I mean yeah I had to be the implement

892
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:32,280
soc's tool and Implement in messenger

893
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,700
Brenda says is this the reason for

894
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,700
narcissism

895
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:40,320
well yeah our brain can get completely

896
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,420
filled up with metals and everything

897
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,579
else absolutely and we can do that but

898
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:48,839
you know we also have a soul in there

899
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:50,400
too keep that in mind we have a soul

900
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:52,619
and we have a Consciousness and

901
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,119
subconsciousness and physical brain we

902
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:56,280
have all four of those things and

903
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:58,020
anything go wrong I talk about that in

904
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:00,599
the books and we also have a free will

905
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:02,760
and a free will can also be involved

906
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:04,680
there too but yes clouded up with all

907
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:06,720
the poisons junk and garbage definitely

908
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:09,560
can send us into a lane that could even

909
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,560
be narcissistic

910
00:37:10,619 --> 00:37:15,240
toxins and poisons clogging the

911
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:17,099
emotional centers of our brain

912
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:19,140
can also mean

913
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:21,900
that we become extremely emotional

914
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:24,300
without understanding why why am I so

915
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:25,800
emotional

916
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:30,000
why

917
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:33,060
am I so darn emotional

918
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:36,060
I get triggered so easy

919
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:39,300
I got a triggers list up to here

920
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:42,599
and every time someone triggers that or

921
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:46,079
something triggers that I'm set off

922
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:49,320
I'm crying I'm upset I'm sad I'm

923
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:52,099
depressed anxiety gets up

924
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,099
I'm hurt

925
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:02,579
but I don't know why

926
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:04,980
I just don't know why

927
00:38:02,579 --> 00:38:07,560
dreams can become very intense it's

heal the damage done trying to heal the

1080
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:31,380
imprint within the cells trying to heal

1081
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:33,000
the brain tissue itself from any kind of

1082
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:36,200
thing that happened in your life that

1083
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,200
was emotionally difficult

1084
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:40,640
healing is happening

1085
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:49,020
hence

1086
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:53,400
the dream shifter

1087
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:57,000
we need help with that healing

1088
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:59,099
if you have any kind of emotionally

1089
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,720
struggling or any kind of emotional

1090
00:44:59,099 --> 00:45:03,660
struggle or something to happen in your

1091
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:05,220
life a loss or something difficult or a

1092
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:08,520
hardship or anything in your life

1093
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:10,200
betrayal broken trust or just anything

1094
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:12,180
and for some reason the emotional

1095
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:13,380
centers of the brain is still injured in

1096
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:15,359
there

1097
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:17,700
and it hasn't healed and you're having

1098
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:19,020
difficult dreams struggles in your

1099
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:22,440
dreams problems with your dreams

1100
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:25,020
torturous dreams whatever it is going on

1101
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:26,819
it's you your body your Consciousness

1102
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:30,119
your subconscious your soul trying to

1103
00:45:26,819 --> 00:45:32,099
heal but we need extra help so what SOC

1104
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:33,119
did what Spirit of compassion did from

1105
00:45:32,099 --> 00:45:35,160
above

1106
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:36,599
Spirit of compassion just told me just

1107
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,579
now somebody just glazed their eyes over

1108
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:40,680
when they heard that someone who's here

1109
00:45:38,579 --> 00:45:42,480
doesn't believe I'm talking to anyone

1110
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:45,540
and just thinks I'm a really smart guy

1111
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:47,400
and I was able to somehow comprise these

1112
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:49,619
books with information

1113
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:51,660
that's okay I still want you to be here

1114
00:45:49,619 --> 00:45:54,420
you don't have to believe I'm just a

1115
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:56,819
messenger you can believe I'm a genius

1116
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:58,680
trust me I'm not a genius

1117
00:45:56,819 --> 00:46:00,839
and even a genius wouldn't have this

1118
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:03,660
wouldn't know what even a genius

1119
00:46:00,839 --> 00:46:04,980
couldn't breathe this this this line of

1120
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:07,020
books here

1121
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:08,819
that the prophecies in these books don't

1122
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:10,440
even it's not even possible a genius

1123
00:46:08,819 --> 00:46:12,839
couldn't do it but thank you for

1124
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:14,400
thinking I'm a smart guy I'm honored but

1125
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:16,020
yes it came from above all right let's

1126
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,240
move on past that when I get information

1127
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:19,980
from SOC while we're doing this

1128
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,900
sometimes I can't help but to put my two

1129
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:24,900
cents in

1130
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:28,140
Okay so

1131
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:31,560
what's happening is is we need that

1132
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:33,359
extra help so that's why I got the

1133
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:34,920
information from it but was given to me

1134
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:36,720
because so many people struggle with

1135
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:39,000
their dreams from emotional wounds and

1136
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:42,060
need the extra push they need the extra

1137
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:45,200
help in rewiring and resetting

1138
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:45,200
how incredible is that

1139
00:46:47,579 --> 00:46:51,720
it's not my first walk in the park

1140
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,520
I've been discriminated against because

1141
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:57,240
of hearing a voice

1142
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:59,280
I've been whatever I'm not treated

1143
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:00,720
kindly because of it I got a kick me

1144
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:02,460
sign on my back it's not my first walk

1145
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,960
in the park so not my first rodeo with

1146
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:05,220

1147
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:07,740

1165
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:06,480
dream about drowning okay I want to ask

1166
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:10,020

00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:03,660
know because that's how it has I have to

1191
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:05,220
do that I have to read it over and over

1192
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:07,140

in there Brad

1197
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:18,240
the things I'm experiencing on these

1198
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:21,000
shots are so profound

1199
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:24,079
the clarity is unreal especially with

1200
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:26,400
the mold exposure the mold exposure shot

1201
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:29,520
the mold exposure and nerve shifter

1202
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:31,619
shots so grateful SOC and aw ungrateful

1203
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:33,960
you're actually brave enough to do the

1204
00:49:31,619 --> 00:49:35,819
mold exposure shot every time I do the

1205
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:38,220
mold exposure shot

1206
00:49:35,819 --> 00:49:40,079
I got this other friend that has a moldy

1207
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:41,700
house right

1208
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:43,800
and you can smell it whenever time

1209
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:46,500
you're in there you smell mildew

1210
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:49,380
so whenever I'm in there I spell mildew

1211
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:50,760
and his friend came over to visit me

1212
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:53,940

00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:10,500
worth repeating

1274
00:52:08,579 --> 00:52:12,180
people who have more toxins in the

1275
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:13,859
emotional centers of the brain tend to

1276
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:15,839
dream about drowning being in water

1277
00:52:13,859 --> 00:52:18,119
playing in water or being trapped in

1278
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:19,859
water whether ocean

Pool lake or river

1281
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:29,819
because their emotional state is in a

1282
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:32,880
way underwater with toxins Who would

1283
00:52:29,819 --> 00:52:37,020
know that anywhere no scientists nothing

1284
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:38,280

00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:43,079
the one cool thing about suffering

1287
00:52:40,619 --> 00:52:44,700
through the the taking the every word

1288
00:52:43,079 --> 00:52:46,619
for word from above and doing these

1289
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:48,900
books and the amount of hours and the

1290
00:52:46,619 --> 00:52:51,119
sacrifices like I made I made

1291
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:53,460
unbelievable sacrifices that someday I

1292
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:55,440

1293
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:57,540

1294
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,559
sacrifices I get emotional choked up

1295
00:52:57,540 --> 00:53:02,880
about it

1296
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:04,559
to do this and but at least I get my

1297
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:06,540
mind blown all the time by the

1298
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:08,160
information I mean that's cool and of

1299
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:09,660
course the most important part I see you

1300
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:11,940
guys healing through the medical medium

1301
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:16,260
books all eight of them that right there

1302
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:20,599
is is that's worth pain and suffering uh

1303
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:20,599
for me in my life okay you ready

1304
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:26,280
they can also have dreams of running

1305
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:28,260
from people like we talked about not

1306
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:30,540
being able to get away when someone's

1307
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:32,579
trying to kill or harm them

1308
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:35,220
while these dreams can have other

1309
00:53:32,579 --> 00:53:37,260
meanings many times they occur because

1310
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:41,220
toxins are in emotional centers of the

1311
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:43,800
brain we have poisons in the area of the

1312
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:46,079
brain where emotions are harbored inside

1313
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:48,380
the neurons and so that's why this

1314
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:48,380
happens

1315
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:55,760
May that hopefully that happens someday

1316
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:55,760
may I saw your comment

1317
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:03,599
so

1318
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:06,359
basically what I'm trying to say I will

1319
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:09,420
put this in the nutshell I will put this

1320
00:54:06,359 --> 00:54:11,640
in a half egg shell no let's not get it

1321
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:13,740
in an eggshell

1322
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:15,780
all right we'll put this

1323
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:18,180
straight

1324
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:20,579
the dream shifter

1325
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:22,440
is there

1326
00:54:20,579 --> 00:54:25,500
quickly

1327
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:29,839
shoot a bolt of Medicine

1328
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:29,839
into the emotional center of the brain

1329
00:54:30,119 --> 00:54:36,119
to help

1330
00:54:32,119 --> 00:54:39,660
relocate toxins appropriately

1331
00:54:36,119 --> 00:54:42,480
because what it does is it goes right to

1332
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:45,140
the emotional center of the brain

1333
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:45,140
fast

1334
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:53,880
and starts to move toxins out of the way

1335
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:56,579
along with rewiring and resetting

1336
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:58,920

this a medicine maker

1399
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:22,619
cold pressed masticating juicer it

1400
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:23,940
doesn't burn the juice like the other

1401
00:57:22,619 --> 00:57:26,040
juicers do

1402
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:27,900
and I will say one more thing about it

1403
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:29,760
it saves you money because it squeezes

1404
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:34,680

1405
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:37,319

endorse them Marina you said the shots

1410
00:57:44,579 --> 00:57:47,819
move the toxins but they don't remove

1411
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:52,380
them

1412
00:57:47,819 --> 00:57:56,040
it's not a detox shot it's a rewire

1413
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:58,920
and reset shot but it allows the toxins

1414
00:57:56,040 --> 00:58:01,619
to be removed easier through other

1415
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:03,720
medical medium tools like your celery

1416
00:58:01,619 --> 00:58:06,000

you gave your you gave your celery juice

00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:19,140
just don't put them together don't take

1445
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:22,140
the shot and mix it in your celery juice

1446
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:23,520
wait 15 to 30 minutes before you do the

1447
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:26,099
one or the other

1448
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:29,000

1451
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:36,000
boom

1452
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:38,339
Carrie Pearson says my new omega mm-1500

1453
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,960
arrived last night lucky you ordered it

1454
00:59:38,339 --> 00:59:42,839
on the third day of the challenge so

1455
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:43,559
excited to use it Carrie

1456
00:59:42,839 --> 00:59:46,020
um

1457
00:59:43,559 --> 00:59:49,559
it it's it's an incredible juicer what

1458
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:52,500
you'll notice is the pulp comes out dry

1459
00:59:49,559 --> 00:59:55,440
like very dry it's squeezing harder

1460
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:57,599
there's compression making sure that as

1461
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:59,940
much juice can come out the other

1462
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:01,680
juicers don't do that

1463
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:03,599
I know the other juicer companies the

1464
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:05,819
sharks that got into the community they

1465
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:07,680
think everybody's rich

1466
01:00:05,819 --> 01:00:09,240
because they're not squeezing all the

1467
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:11,339
juice out like these are

1468
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:12,960
and so these save money and you actually

1469
01:00:11,339 --> 01:00:15,720
pay for the juicer over and over again

1470
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:18,540
like the savings pays for the juicer but

1471
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:20,119
right now the MLM slash affiliate sharks

1472
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:22,440
brought the juicers in the mm community

1473
01:00:20,119 --> 01:00:24,660
and everybody's getting tricked by the

1474
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:26,579
by The Flash and the Frills and chills

1475
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:29,760
but don't realize this is a slow

1476
01:00:26,579 --> 01:00:32,099
masticating cold pressed juicer that

1477
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:34,859
actually squeezes so hard to get the

1478
01:00:32,099 --> 01:00:36,180
juice out and you save money because the

1479
01:00:34,859 --> 01:00:37,799
other juicer companies much think it

1480
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:39,599

1481
01:00:37,799 --> 01:00:42,780

Frozen or fresh cherries but I'm gonna

1499
01:01:20,339 --> 01:01:22,819

1500
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:29,160
Frozen cherries here

incredible

1506
01:01:49,319 --> 01:01:55,200
all right so we're moving along

1507
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:58,920
what's the next order of business with

1508
01:01:55,200 --> 01:02:00,839
this recipe it's the raw zucchini

1509
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:03,559
I'm gonna peel mine back a little bit if

1510
01:02:00,839 --> 01:02:03,559
you guys don't mind

1511
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:10,260
so

1512
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:12,299
half cup of chopped raw zucchini

1513
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:14,819
I'm just gonna peel some of my skin off

1514
01:02:12,299 --> 01:02:18,020
you don't have to peel the skin off I

1515
01:02:14,819 --> 01:02:18,020
like to peel the skin off

1516
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:27,240
foreign

1517
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:33,200
get some of this in here

1518
01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:38,359
we're gonna do about a half cup

1519
01:02:40,619 --> 01:02:44,420
a little bit more to go

1520
01:02:57,599 --> 01:03:01,220
thing is about the dream shifter

1521
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:07,200
you feel it as the day goes on if you

1522
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:09,480
take it in the morning I get an instant

1523
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:13,940
shot instant hit from it by the second

1524
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:13,940
sip but you really do feel it

1525
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:24,289
nice

1526
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:24,289
[Applause]

1527
01:03:26,819 --> 01:03:32,160
so then the last is some a quarter cup

1528
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,880
of loosely packed

1529
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:34,880
mint

1530
01:03:35,339 --> 01:03:39,240
so peppermint leaves

1531
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:41,220
now

1532
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:43,700
that's the one to use is the peppermint

1533
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:43,700
leaves

1534
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:47,030
[Applause]

1535
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:53,960
so a quarter cup

1536
01:03:56,339 --> 01:04:00,359
so I'm going to need some more mint now

1537
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:04,520
the thing is is if you're not a fan of

1538
01:04:00,359 --> 01:04:04,520
mint just kind of hold your nose

1539
01:04:04,619 --> 01:04:08,940
that's what you can do you can hold your

1540
01:04:06,540 --> 01:04:10,720
nose that's pretty much coming around a

1541
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:13,870
quarter about a quarter right there

1542
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:13,870
[Applause]

1543
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:19,140
will be a touch more and we're good when

1544
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:20,760
you tightly pack it

1545
01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:22,980
what happens is

1546
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:24,540
it takes a decent amount of mint because

1547
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:26,940
that's what it is it's not Loosely

1548
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:29,099
chopped it says tightly packed so that's

1549
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:31,319
about a quarter there

1550
01:04:29,099 --> 01:04:33,599
we go

1551
01:04:31,319 --> 01:04:37,020
Marina can a regular mint be used

1552
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:39,960
instead of a peppermint yes indeed

1553
01:04:37,020 --> 01:04:43,619
