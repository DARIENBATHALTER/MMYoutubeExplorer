37
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,960
of the day does the sadness hit you

38
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,180
around lunchtime

39
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,259
does the sadness hit you at the end of

40
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,820
the day

41
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:42,320
I know people were the sadness

42
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:47,220
mysteriously Comes This un

43
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:50,479
diagnosed mysterious sadness that comes

44
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:52,619
like at four o'clock five o'clock every

45
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,659
single day

46
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:57,060
I just saw somebody on IG that says I

47
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:59,100
get angry or easier

48
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,720
so many people are struggling struggling

49
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,799
with moods they're struggling with

50
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,439
sadness

51
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,780
I think

52
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:09,360
there is a difference

53
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:12,120
from what I've learned from SOC with

54
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,580
sadness that's mysterious and then just

55
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,220
of course depression and then you may

56
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:19,319
have both that's the thing you could be

57
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:22,800
suffering from depression

58
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:24,780
but also have this mysterious sadness

59
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,420
involved it could be two things like

60
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,760
mood

61
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:31,800
moods uh problems happening with

62
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,540
depression I mean I've seen it all out

63
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,340

64
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,500

65
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,900
is a brain shot therapy I really like I

66
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,120
treasure the mood shifter I treasure the

67
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,440
power it has

68
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,040
and

69
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:49,500
I'm not saying that lightly I'm not I

70
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,860
treasure the power the mood shifter has

71
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:55,920
because it does hold something I haven't

72
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,540
seen anything else do friend of mine's

73
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,599
son

74
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:04,040
was in a really bad mood

75
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:06,840
um came back from school okay and

76
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:10,200
instantly she gave him the mood shifter

77
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:13,200
and usually anything else she tries just

78
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,940
doesn't change his mood and then she

79
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,700
gave him the mood shifter and it was

80
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:20,519
like a miracle happened so they're doing

81
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:22,860
the mood shifter every single day

82
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:24,599
when he comes home from school it's

83
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:27,480
incredible really

84
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:31,080
right so let's talk about mood let's get

85
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,080
into it now so

86
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:38,040
I am in the book

87
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:41,159
brain saver and I am just so we know

88
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:43,980
on page 207 I don't think that's the

89
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:47,120
spot I'm supposed to be in hang on there

90
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:47,120
let's see where we are

91
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:55,019
hold on here

92
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:55,019
looking for page 370.

93
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:05,159
all right we got it mood changes page

94
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:07,860
370 in brain saver the book is so huge

95
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:10,500
it's such a big book I don't think I'll

96
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:12,060
ever know where everything is I just

97
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,340
don't think I will

98
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:17,639
all right

99
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:19,260
we often hear mood changes being blamed

100
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:20,760
on hormone imbalances okay that's a

101
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:24,300
question I have for you guys it's really

102
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:26,940
important is your mood blamed on

103
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,620
hormones did that happen to you

104
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:32,400
did you go to your practitioner your

105
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:34,199
doctor your healer your herbalist your

106
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:38,460
health care provider and they were like

107
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:40,440
well no your sadness your mood changes

108
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:42,060
is your hormones

109
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,259
do you hear that all all the time out

110
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,960
there

111
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:48,360
because that's what people are told when

112
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,160
it comes down to moods it's not about

113
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,020
the toxic heavy metals in their brain

114
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,180
it's not about because of course they

115
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:56,220
don't know about that out there it's not

116
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:59,220
about the toxic Metals in the brain or

117
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:01,919
all the toxic chemicals or all the viral

118
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:04,800
infections people have it's not about

119
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:06,600
all that it's about hormones right I

120
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,520
mean pretty much everybody says no it's

121
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,840
hormones are the problem that's why I

122
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,840
have a mood problem right

123
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:16,440
that's what men always say I just saw

124
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:19,500
that on IG that it's about women's moods

125
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:21,360
because of uh hormones we often hear

126
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:24,300
mood changes being blamed on hormone

127
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,759
imbalances yes we do often hear that

128
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:29,699
what's incredible is that there's a new

129
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:32,699
generation and a new generation of women

130
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:33,780
that are being educated that it's their

131
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:37,139
hormones

132
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:39,600
so if anything's wrong with their health

133
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:41,880
and they're not so sick like they're not

134
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,419
I mean they're not so sick they're not

135
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:48,720
super sick they're not chronically sick

136
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:52,380
if they're not chronically sick then

137
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,720
their hormones may not be the blame if

138
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:56,759
they're just partially sick they got

139
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,680
like a little gut stuff and a little

140
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:00,960
headache once in a while and they got a

141
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,880
little bit of malaise they got a little

142
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,680
bit of acne and they go to their

143
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,900
functional medicine doctor or whatever

144
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,940
doctor and the first thing that's going

145
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,199
to happen is it's their hormones you're

146
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:13,199
going to be told it's the hormone so

147
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:16,500
there's a new generation of young women

148
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:19,139
right now being trained to think that

149
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:21,479
every single thing is for hormones and

150
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:22,560
you see it now with influencers on

151
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:24,780
social

152
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,600
you'll see like 20 year olds and 21 year

153
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:28,860
olds and 23 year olds and and 19 year

154
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,600
olds and they're just and they're doing

155
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:32,580
their thing about like oh it's my

156
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,680
hormones my hormones is why I don't feel

157
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:37,199
that great my hormones is why I can't

158
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,960
sleep good at night my hormones is why I

159
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:43,139
have this acne my hormones is why I'm

160
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:46,080
dizzy all the time this hormones is why

161
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:47,940
I don't have the energy so it's it's

162
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,440
right now there's a new training

163
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:51,660
happening since there's a new

164
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,780
conditioning in brainwashing meanwhile

165
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:57,060
where young women don't understand is

166
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:58,800
that whoa no you got mercury in your

167
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,240
brain you got aluminum you've got copper

168
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,280
in your brain your liver is getting

169
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,900
clogged up early on when it's not

170
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,539
supposed to you're having all these

171
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:08,940
other issues you know so it's it's all

172
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:11,280
of that going on but what's happening is

173
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:13,319
they're being blamed on hormones is the

174
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,900
big one right now like every functional

175
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:18,440
doctor every single practitioner it's

176
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:21,900
still it's your hormones and a whole new

177
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:24,180
generation of women are being completely

178
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:26,099
conditioned that it's their hormones so

179
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:27,780
that they're to blame they're the reason

180
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:29,759
why they're sick I think it's a

181
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:33,080
dangerous place to go yes hormones play

182
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:35,940
a role in a lot and I'm not

183
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,860
anti-hormone belief because I actually

184
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:39,960
know from a spirit of compassion that

185
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:42,720
hormones can get out of whack and they

186
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:45,840
can't get out of balance absolutely but

187
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:48,300
there's a difference between that

188
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,699
and everything being hormones and

189
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:52,500
hormones only and that's important to

190
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:54,419
know because there's this younger

191
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:57,300
generation of women that are being

192
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:59,880
trained literally trained every day

193
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,919
right now that their their hormones are

194
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:04,259
every reason why they're depressed they

195
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,300
have anxiety so if they have anxiety or

196
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:07,680
anxiousness or panic attacks it's their

197
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,919
hormone

198
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,840
um if their periods are difficult it's

199
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:14,759
their hormones if they have acne it's

200
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:17,400
their hormones if they have any kind of

201
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:19,680
mood shifting against their hormones and

202
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:22,080
hormones aren't why people are severely

203
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,759
depressed that have anxiety hormones

204
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,680
aren't why people are suffering from

205
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:29,280
these bad bad periods when they're

206
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,319
younger hormones aren't the reason why a

207
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,419
lot of things right but but there's

208
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:35,880
you'll see it now on social it's it's

209
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:38,219
almost like oh my God are you kidding so

210
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:41,339
they have completely brainwashed and

211
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:44,219
they're gonna brainwash the entire you

212
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:46,080
know world of young women that their

213
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:48,000
hormones are to blame for everything and

214
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,160
that's the new Direction alternative

215
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,720
medicine and conventional medicine but

216
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,040
the New Direction alternative medicine

217
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,779
has gone

218
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,980
and I support

219
00:08:54,779 --> 00:09:01,680
I support hormones and hormone even to

220
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:04,380
some degree bioidentical I talk about

221
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:07,680
an idea for women but hormones are not

222
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:09,899
why young women have difficult periods

223
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,300
There's real reasons happening there's

224
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:14,640
low grade viral infections there's toxic

225
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:18,180
heavy metals it's just a couple but the

226
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:20,580
point is and also adrenal problems which

227
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:21,899
is adrenal hormones that's an entirely

228
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:25,560
different thing but they'll blame

229
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:28,200
everything on hormones for young women

230
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:30,660
and that's what's going on right now

231
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:33,540
that's the new normal that's developing

232
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:36,720
so and you'll see it five years

233
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:39,060
there'll be another billion sick women

234
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,680
in five years they'll all be on social

235
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,940
like young women will be on social and

236
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,399
they'll all be like it's my hormones

237
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:47,100
it's why I'm numb in my arms and I feel

238
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,440
like I got sandbags in my legs

239
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:51,360
and and they won't talk about caffeine

240
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,100
blowing out their adrenals or caffeine

241
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,720
like damaging their brain or anything

242
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:57,120
because caffeine they want young women

243
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,399
on caffeine the in the caffeine industry

244
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,899
wants young women on caffeine and then

245
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:03,060
the medical industry would love for

246
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:04,680
women to just believe it's their genes

247
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:07,860
or their hormones

248
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:10,080
and if they're really sick really really

249
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,700
sick then the medical industry will say

250
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,620
well it's your body attacking itself

251
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:16,019
it's autoimmune so what you're going to

252
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:18,300
see is on social you're going to see

253
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:20,940
millions and millions and millions of of

254
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:23,519
influencer influencers women influencers

255
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:26,940
like young ones right young women like

256
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,440
21 22 23 in a few years you're going to

257
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:31,200
see millions of them and they're all

258
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,880
going to be like well it's if they're

259
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,740
too sick it'll be like well my body's

260
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,420
attacking itself it's autoimmune right

261
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,620
which we know isn't the truth if you

262
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:39,480
know if you know medical meme

263
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:41,220
information the body doesn't attack

264
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:44,519
itself or the other thing is they're

265
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:46,800
going to be like it's my hormones

266
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:49,140
that's the conditioning of what's

267
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,660
happening today it's to put blame it's

268
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:53,760
body shame so what I'm trying to say is

269
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:55,920
that the industries

270
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:59,399
are teaching

271
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:02,519
women to shame their bodies

272
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:04,560
so it's all about body shaming now it's

273
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:08,220
your hormones that's a form of body

274
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:10,860
shaming yes when you're 40 years old you

275
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:12,959
can have hormone imbalances yes you you

276
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:14,940
could find an incredible doctor that

277
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,620
does bioidentical hormones if you're 45

278
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,120
years old if that's the direction you

279
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:20,100
want to go if they're really

280
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:22,560
knowledgeable or something but that's

281
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,820
that's not what this is I'm not talking

282
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,560
about this

283
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,839
I'm talking about

284
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:31,260
young women that are sick for other

285
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:33,959
reasons being body shamed and the body

286
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:36,060
shaming is out of control right now and

287
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:38,160
it's just beginning

288
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:44,339
and the body shaming is going to be like

289
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:47,160
every single 18 19 17 15 whatever 21 22

290
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:48,720
25 year old woman like every one of them

291
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:51,660
is going to be if they have a symptom

292
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,640
like a neurological symptom or anxiety

293
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:56,760
or depression or depersonalization or

294
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:59,519
OCD it's your hormones

295
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:02,760
it's your fault your body's bad

296
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,320
your body's faulty your body is not

297
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:07,079
working right

298
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,579
or it's your jeans or it's your body

299
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:10,320
attacking itself and that's where it's

300
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:13,920
going

301
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:16,440
okay boots Berlin says pregnancy is not

302
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,959
sickness it is he a huge change in the

303
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:22,440
whole Temple hormones roller coaster

304
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:25,200
pregnancy is hard on the body and when

305
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:27,899
women have problems like autoimmune

306
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,000
which is like viruses and low-grade

307
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:34,680
viral infections when women are very

308
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,180
sick pregnancy is very difficult on a

309
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,160
woman who's very sick with chronic

310
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:41,100
illness okay because there's all these

311
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:43,440
other problems why do you see one woman

312
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:45,779
have a good pregnancy where it was

313
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,519
easier and another woman have a very

314
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:49,260
difficult pregnancy it was harder

315
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,720
because of other problems going on

316
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:54,120
pathogens Epstein-Barr infections in the

317
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,880
reproductive system because the immune

318
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:59,579
system is protecting the baby and the

319
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,839
reproductive system so if a woman is

320
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:04,380
sick during her pregnancy she's

321
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:08,399
chronically ill there's other problems

322
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:11,579
at hand here so that's how it works yes

323
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:14,579
there's there's hormones related to

324
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:17,459
pregnancy absolutely and all of that but

325
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:19,139
I'm trying to show you like something's

326
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:20,820
really important though so I know you

327
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:22,740
just want to pass everything off of a

328
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:24,240
pregnant the woman's pregnant her

329
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:26,700
hormones are all over the place it's

330
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,260
like let's not kind of insult everybody

331
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,540
because what people don't even realize

332
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:32,880
is your immune system

333
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:34,380
is and I'm not saying you're insulting

334
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,700
anybody I'm just saying that's that's

335
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:38,100
something that happens out there people

336
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:41,700
are saying that out there they're saying

337
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:43,620
oh well oh she's pregnant that's what's

338
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:45,300
going on that's why she's having such a

339
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,200
hard time it's like whoa he's having a

340
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,820
hard time

341
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,959
because there's so many other problems

342
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,639
going on

343
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,860
she's struggling from so many other

344
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:55,079
different situations

345
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:57,540
maybe her adrenals aren't strong and one

346
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:59,040
of them is weakened right that's just

347
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:01,500
one thing maybe she got the low-grade

348
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,540
viral infections yeah

349
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,519
maybe she's got the toxic heavy metals

350
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:08,279
maybe there's other things going on and

351
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:10,320
all of that combined and then being

352
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:11,399
pregnant and having a baby right but

353
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,639
they'll just blame everything on

354
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:16,079
hormones so you'll have a mom that's

355
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,720
pregnant

356
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:20,880
and she's struggling with her pregnancy

357
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,700
and her health and they'll just blame it

358
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:26,160
all on hormones when wait a minute no

359
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:30,480
that Mom has a lot of other problems

360
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:33,959
going on making it really difficult

361
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,760
but that's one topic right there they're

362
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:38,579
training

363
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,500
millions of young women to believe that

364
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:42,540
everything is hormones

365
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:45,060
so if they have one problem it's

366
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:47,720
hormones whatever that is one symptom

367
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,720
see

368
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:53,699
um Dreyer woolman says my pregnancies

369
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:56,699
were the worst especially my second one

370
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:58,920
I was deep into standard naturopathic

371
00:14:56,699 --> 00:15:01,560
treatments eating way too much protein

372
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:04,680
and my viruses were out of control

373
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:06,120
I hadn't found you yet aw my God you

374
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,260
know the information then you're reading

375
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,820
the information and you're learning

376
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:13,199
that's incredible

377
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:16,440
it really truly Dr Laura woolman

378
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:19,260
thank you Dr Laura

379
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:21,839
thank you for being here so proud of you

380
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:23,279
so anyway I think that since we're

381
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,019
talking about mood changes I just wanted

382
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,940
to talk about hormone imbalances a

383
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:29,279
little bit too

384
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:31,500
and I think that

385
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,120
for to begin with

386
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:35,940
like Spirit of passion always told me

387
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,940
yes you could have hormones that are

388
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:41,399
um imbalanced I never said you can't

389
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:43,980
have imbalanced hormones

390
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:45,660
you can and the adrenals produce a lot

391
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:47,600
of reproductive hormones too and they

392
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:50,820
produce a lot of hormones

393
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:53,160
but what happens is though there's

394
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:55,560
hundreds of other symptoms

395
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:59,579
and these hundreds of other symptoms

396
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:01,320
don't play any role with hormones

397
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:03,480
and that's important to know so that

398
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,920
means hormones aren't causing those

399
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:07,620
symptoms

400
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,820
I just want that out there

401
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:12,480
clear

402
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:15,720
because it's so important right now it's

403
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,339
just if you're 20 years old

404
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,720
and you're a woman

405
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:20,760
and you go to a couple different

406
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,160
practitioners and doctors and you have a

407
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:24,300
symptom oh you better believe you're

408
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,940
going to be told it's your hormones

409
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:29,820
people with same hormones out of whack

410
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:31,380
don't have those symptoms so one 20 year

411
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:33,360
old

412
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:34,860
and another one can have two different

413
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,300
experiences

414
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:38,279
right

415
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:40,380
so it's incredible how it works because

416
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:42,420
hormones are not the cause of every

417
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:44,759
single symptom and condition but they're

418
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:46,560
going there soon and they're already

419
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:48,480
kind of there you're seeing it on social

420
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,740
more and more it's just it's gonna be

421
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,980
out of control five years from now

422
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:54,720
everybody's sick and dying right all the

423
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:56,459
neurological problems developing and all

424
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,540
these people and all college students

425
00:16:56,459 --> 00:16:58,860
and everything else and everybody's

426
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:01,079
gonna be on there like

427
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:03,680
it's my hormones my doctor told me it's

428
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:03,680
my hormones

429
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:10,439
Kate says had amazing second pregnancy

430
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:13,679
on medical medium going mountains

431
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:16,860
till month nine almost no protein intake

432
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:20,179
perfect lab work home birth a beautiful

433
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:20,179
child incredible

434
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:24,059
I think meant Moving Mountains

435
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:26,160
incredible

436
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:27,900
all right so let's let's roll you guys

437
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,299
interesting interesting information

438
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:33,240
isn't it though but you know where it's

439
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:35,940
going and you can see it like any

440
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:39,660
influencer basically not anyone but

441
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:41,940
almost all young people that are

442
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:44,100
influencers on YouTube

443
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,179
like they don't know why they have their

444
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:48,419
symptoms

445
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:50,640
they have no idea they're like well

446
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:52,700
I get kind of achy and pains throughout

447
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,620
my body I don't have a lot of energy

448
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:58,980
some days I feel better some days I

449
00:17:55,620 --> 00:18:01,320
don't and I'm not sleeping that great I

450
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:05,220
went to my doctor and he said it was my

451
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:07,140
hormones how old am I 22 years old

452
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:10,320
it's not your hormones

453
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:14,520
Trina P iron is a big thing going around

454
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:16,620
ferritin anemia can you address

455
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:18,299
well

456
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:21,900
medical medium info is the only

457
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:25,980
information that put that was put the

458
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:28,919
truth about iron deficiencies out there

459
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:31,440
and so what that truth is is that if

460
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:33,960
you're missing the iron

461
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,900
and the levels are low

462
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:39,000
and something is eating the iron

463
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:42,059
critical to know right there that piece

464
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,240
of information is critical and

465
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:47,640
I was looking for my little virus

466
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,260
but what happens people don't realize is

467
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:52,919
iron

468
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:54,840
is a food source for many varieties of

469
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:57,360
Epstein-Barr virus

470
00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:00,960
not all varieties of Epstein-Barr virus

471
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:03,179
but many varieties of Epstein-Barr virus

472
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,340
and so

473
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:09,020
um

474
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:09,020
got some iron in your bloodstream

475
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:14,700
and then a low-grade viral infection

476
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,860
medical research design doesn't know

477
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:19,260
that the low-grade viral infection is

478
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:21,600
feeding off of the iron

479
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:22,980
that's how it works people with serious

480
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,620
iron deficiencies are getting blood

481
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:27,179
transfusions because they're so high in

482
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:29,280
a viral load

483
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:33,000
that the viral load is gobbling and

484
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:35,940
gobbling all their iron up in their body

485
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,100
so Spirit of compassion always told me

486
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:39,600
to help somebody get past this someday

487
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,820
in their life they have to get the viral

488
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,320
infections down but if the doctors and

489
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:45,539
the medical industry don't know about

490
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:47,700
their viral infection how are they going

491
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:49,740
to get their iron fixed and they end up

492
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:51,480
in this vicious cycle

493
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:53,340
they have to try to change your diet

494
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,140
they try to do different things and some

495
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:56,820
of it's hit and miss where their iron

496
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:58,980
gets a little stronger

497
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:01,260
because they're taking Foods out that

498
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:02,760
are feeding the viruses as well

499
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:04,799
and so they get a little bit of a

500
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:07,080
benefit but if you don't know the truth

501
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:09,120
of what to really do of what foods to

502
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:11,760
remove that feed the virus

503
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:14,220
and how to go after the virus

504
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:17,280
and how to keep the immune system strong

505
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:20,220
to go after the virus then the iron in

506
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,179
that person get gets eaten and eaten and

507
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,340
eaten

508
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:26,400
and then blood transfer blood

509
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:27,900
transfusions are needed periodically

510
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,880
because

511
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:32,460
there's a viral infection and the virus

512
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,799
is feeding off the eye

513
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:37,559
and where'd my line go there's my lime

514
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:38,940
I'm in such a bad mood today I need the

515
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:41,039
mood shifter

516
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:43,740
can you tell I'm in a bad mood today you

517
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:46,980
guys can you actually tell

518
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:51,539
I'm not in that bad of a mood

519
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:53,700
but I would like the mood shifter indeed

520
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:55,860
um during pregnancy it's common to be

521
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:59,280
low in iron because Epstein-Barr

522
00:20:55,860 --> 00:21:01,980
infections tend to evolve during

523
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:05,400
pregnancies if a woman is dealing with a

524
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:08,460
low-grade viral infection already and so

525
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:10,020
the immune system is gear a woman's

526
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,520
immune system is geared on protecting

527
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:13,140
the reproductive system that's not

528
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,280
science research that's medical medium

529
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:16,440
science right

530
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,700
and it's protecting the the reproductive

531
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,919
system

532
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:21,720
and uh and then you can have a viral

533
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:23,700
load that ends up taking advantage of

534
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:25,740
that and that viral load can be gobbling

535
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:28,380
up iron all through the body it's just

536
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:30,600
it's crazy how it works YouTube Jackie

537
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:32,460
says

538
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:35,100
uh wow

539
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:37,380
and years ago they put me on iron pills

540
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:39,240
feeding the EBV this makes sense I

541
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:41,100
became worse yes and that that leads me

542
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:43,020
to the next point I wanted to say thank

543
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,940
you for actually leaving that comment on

544
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:46,919
YouTube which God bless you

545
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:49,380
what people don't realize is that so

546
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:51,840
many people have tried the iron pills

547
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:54,000
for their anemia and then when they did

548
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,440
the iron pills they got sicker and they

549
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,820
were going back to their doctor like I

550
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,400
can't take these iron pills I'm getting

551
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:01,919
sicker and sicker and sicker but what

552
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:03,900
the doctor did not know medical research

553
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:06,539
design did not know is the viral

554
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:08,520
infection was feeding off of more iron

555
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:11,039
so the iron pills were going in and the

556
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:13,320
virus was feeding off the iron pills and

557
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:15,600
then the virus was getting stronger and

558
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,620
then person was getting sicker see how

559
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,600

the brain saver books

576
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:04,980
Juden said told low in iron two and was

577
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,200
sick for the pills absolutely

578
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:09,780
uh crystal says yes I was taking on her

579
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,940
pills during pregnancy so okay for okay

580
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:14,280
here's an example of how incredible

581
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:15,840
Spirit of compassion's information is I

582
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:19,140
wanted to say something

583
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:21,600
Lana Marquis says that must be why I was

584
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:23,400
anemic when pregnant the only time I

585
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,440
ever was anemic absolutely because when

586
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,840
you're pregnant

587
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,299
almost all your immune system a big hunk

588
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:33,240
of it is going to the baby

589
00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:34,919
it's protecting the baby in the womb

590
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:37,260
that means you have less immune system

591
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:39,840
everywhere else viral infections go up

592
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:42,059
you go anemic when pregnant

593
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,679
um and here's another thing here's this

594
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:45,659
is critical like

595
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,860
Spirit of compassion's information is so

596
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:50,460
advanced

597
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:52,799
there are millions of women

598
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:55,860
they go on the iron pills and get sicker

599
00:23:52,799 --> 00:24:00,240
and science research has no idea why

600
00:23:55,860 --> 00:24:01,919
but this info is so Advanced it provides

601
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,200
an answer

602
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,940
just like the blood draw information is

603
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:08,220
so Advanced it provides answers for

604
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:09,900
people like it's incredible preeclampsia

605
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:12,419
is Epstein-Barr infection

606
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:14,280
to preeclampsias it's a viral infection

607
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:17,159
it's a viral load that's somebody who's

608
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:19,020
really got a viral infection

609
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:20,100
and you know what size research will

610
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:23,100
take this

611
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:25,260
they'll call me a quack or something and

612
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:27,120
they'll take the information they do it

613
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:29,039
every day the clinics are taking

614
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,720
published medical meme information and

615
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,700
putting it in their little write-ups on

616
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,320
diseases and symptoms right now we know

617
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,760
we're cataloging it we're watching it

618
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,799
and we can't even we're seeing it before

619
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:40,679
our eyes we're like oh you're getting

620
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:42,900
the letter because that's illegal to do

621
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:44,700
they're taking published medical medium

622
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:46,980
information because science research has

623
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:49,740
no info at all to offer for anybody they

624
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:51,780
never did they're taking a decade of

625
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:53,280
answers and plugging it into all the

626
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:54,720
clinics in the clinic search engines

627
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,880
right now

628
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,900
without having any proof that they had

629
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,240
it first

630
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:03,120
it's actually disgusting

631
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:05,340
I'm in such a bad mood now for real I do

632
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,919
need the moon shifter I have put myself

633
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:10,320
in a bad mood apparently by talking

634
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,120
about that

635
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,039
don't worry that's just medical medium

636
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:16,200
woes

637
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:19,100
I will get a mood shifter in me in no

638
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,100
time all right let's get going

639
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:26,100
we often hear mood changes become blamed

640
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:29,400
on hormone imbalances whether puberty a

641
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:32,880
menstrual cycle or menopause

642
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:34,020
hormonal shifts are an easy target it's

643
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,799
your hormones

644
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:40,080
be quiet shut up it's your hormones

645
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:42,240
the truth is that there's much more to

646
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,159
mood changes than hormone fluctuations

647
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,440
uh-huh

648
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:48,179
there's so much more to mood changes

649
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,679
than hormone fluctuations there's so

650
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:52,679
much more to every symptom and condition

651
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:54,059
than calling it hormones

652
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:56,400
Jackie

653
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:58,260
aw you helped to bring my niece into

654
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,700
this world a few months ago are you

655
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:01,679
going to try to get me all emotional

656
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:04,679
where I have to almost start crying my

657
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:07,200
sister kept having miscarriages until I

658
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:09,299
showed her the medical medium way

659
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:12,299
God bless you

660
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:14,460
this Mandalorian I think it was is it

661
00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:17,480
this is the way

662
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:17,480
I'm Mandalorian

663
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,620
I think there's a new season coming out

664
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:25,820
unless it's my imagination and I think

665
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:25,820
I'm wrong I don't know

666
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:30,179
the truth is that there's much more to

667
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:33,000
mood changes than hormone fluctuations

668
00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:34,980
when someone's altered state of mind

669
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,320
isn't the result of something

670
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:39,059
emotionally challenging or traumatic

671
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:42,299
happening in the Life One common cause

672
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:44,400
of irritability or the blues is toxic

673
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:48,679
blood

674
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:52,860
I don't want to keep on complaining here

675
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:54,240
I almost can't stand myself

676
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:56,159
but

677
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,779
there's now like doctors out there

678
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,460
stealing this

679
00:26:57,779 --> 00:27:00,779
from medical medium books and putting it

680
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:02,700
in ads

681
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:05,220
toxic blood

682
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:07,140
and and dirty blood syndrome Everything

683
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:09,419
Medical medium published and they're

684
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:11,460
just taking it and running

685
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:13,559
do you think there's like a hell for all

686
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:15,179
these people or something like you know

687
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:18,539
what I mean when we leave here and you

688
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:20,419
did so many like deceitful things or do

689
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:23,880
you think that doesn't exist

690
00:27:20,419 --> 00:27:25,980
you know what I mean like it's like you

691
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:28,380
just go to the greatest Heaven there

692
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:31,320
ever was doesn't matter how many people

693
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:33,240
you s you know you drew to a different

694
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:35,400
direction and their house just their

695
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:37,740
health just went crashed and they went

696
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:39,840
through hell and they

697
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:42,000
they you know like because when you

698
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,640
think about it if you're gonna steal all

699
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,919
the info out of the books

700
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:49,500
but not tell them where it comes from

701
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:50,940
and then they stay sick and they lose 10

702
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,559
years of their life and their children

703
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:55,020
are sick don't you think that's just

704
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:58,140
kind of like wrong

705
00:27:55,020 --> 00:28:00,419
ah right

706
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:02,880
and it wouldn't be so bad if they keep

707
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:05,340
on stealing the medical meme information

708
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,679
if they if they didn't call me like

709
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:10,020
names while they were doing it and say

710
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,460
that I'm not a trusted reliable source

711
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:14,580
but they keep on

712
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:16,260
taking the info non-stop right now

713
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:18,360
this look we're doing the mood shifter

714
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:19,620
today so I just thought that I would

715
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:22,500
talk about this a little bit with you

716
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:24,299
guys because it puts me in a bad mood so

717
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,740
it's perfect timing for the mood shifter

718
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:28,799
I'm actually excited

719
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:30,360
the point I'm trying to say is I can't

720
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,620
even read a sentence now that they're

721
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:35,039
not taking

722
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:36,539
that's it's actually like mad day right

723
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:38,700
and

724
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:40,140
you think I wouldn't care so much if it

725
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,279
didn't mean so many people are never

726
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,600
going to find their way back to the

727
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,559
books and they're going to stay sick for

728
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,900
years

729
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:48,620
and even die many of them

730
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,620
down the road

731
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:55,799
okay toxic blood

732
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:58,380
toxic blood can shift the mood not

733
00:28:55,799 --> 00:29:01,020
hormones toxic blood

734
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:03,419
even if something difficult is going on

735
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:05,880
if that person's blood is also toxic

736
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:08,580
they'd be more sensitive and susceptible

737
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:11,520
to triggers from confrontation and

738
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:13,380
conflict someone has toxic blood in

739
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,419
their body and they run into

740
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:16,860
confrontation they're going to be in a

741
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:18,840
bad mood

742
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:20,220

743
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,840

did you just say I was ugly

747
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:30,779
like why would you say that but since I

748
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:33,000
have really toxic blood I'm going to be

749
00:29:30,779 --> 00:29:35,100
in a worse mood about that

750
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,140
I can't shake that off

751
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:38,880
did that really hurt my feelings I'm

752
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,600
angry about it now you just called me

753
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,539

754
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:44,279
my toxic blood is boiling inside of me

755
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:46,320
right now because I have toxic thick

756
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:49,260

757
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:51,059
and my toxic blood is is like making it

758
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:53,039
so I'm triggered easier so if you call

760
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:58,820

this is what I call Dirty blood syndrome

763
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:09,240
when blood is toxic it's dirty it's not

764
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:11,039
clean blood

765
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,480
it's like if I had to get a BL if I had

766
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:15,980
to a bad car accident or something like

767
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,980
that and had to get a blood transfusion

768
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:21,419

769
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:23,220
don't give me someone's don't give me

770
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:26,100

blood syndrome please

772
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:30,299
spread of compassion would be like I

773
00:30:27,899 --> 00:30:32,880
would be asking questions being like

774
00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:34,799
spirit is the blood that I'm getting is

775
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,620
it from something yeah it's from a

776
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:40,679
really dirty blood syndrome person their

777
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:43,860
blood is toxic great put it in me

778
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:46,020
Lorraine L they took three big vials of

779
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:48,539
blood to test my hormones and I hated it

780
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:50,760
in comparison to some people that have

781
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:52,919
blood drawn I know this isn't much but

782
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:55,980
it still felt so obsessive I felt really

783
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:58,020
quasiately okay

784
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:59,700
I have a lot to say about

785
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:01,860
drop blood draw

786
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:03,779
a lot to say

787
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:05,520
anybody who listens to the blood draw

788
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:06,899
podcast the medical meme podcast at

789
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:10,140
Apple podcast could have their lives

790
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:13,500
safe but even better than that

791
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:16,440
I gotta I got protocols in here

792
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:18,539
the brain saver books

793
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:20,580
I have a blood draw chapter in here that

794
00:31:18,539 --> 00:31:23,820
will blow your mind

795
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:27,720
blow your mind you have to be educated

796
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:30,600
about blood draw it's critical right now

797
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:33,299
because yes three full vials of blood

798
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:36,240
can knock somebody back

799
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:40,140
so you're not you're you're

800
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:44,220
complaint Lorraine is actually valid

801
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:47,340
a hundred percent valid you felt queasy

802
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:49,620
I know three full vials someone can be

803
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:51,600
hit from that it's no joke never mind

804
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:53,940
five miles seven vials ten vials 15

805
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:56,159
vials by the way I'm talking about blood

806
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:59,460
draw because Lorraine you mentioned it

807
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:01,200
but also because that can really change

808
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:04,440
moods in people when they're getting too

809
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:06,899
much blood drawn really change moods

810
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:08,880
all their glucose goes out the door like

811
00:32:06,899 --> 00:32:10,500
a lot of glucose so electrolytes go out

812
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,880
the door their immune system goes out

813
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,620
the door I've talked about this for so

814
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:16,380
many times so many years the trace

815
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:20,179
minerals go out the door

816
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:20,179
trace minerals glucose

817
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:27,360
right so all of that electrolytes

818
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:30,720
macro minerals specially go out the door

819
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:32,520
all of that is just boom and then how

820
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,000
are people going to recover that glass

821
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:35,000
of water

822
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:38,640
I mean

823
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:40,919
you're you when you fill up with fluids

824
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:43,500
and eat you're not restoring your blood

825
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:45,960
what's in your blood so fast you're just

826
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:48,059
restoring water content too and that's

827
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:49,919
that's not all the bulk of your blood

828
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:52,260
water content does not restore your

829
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:54,059
immune system

830
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:56,039
anyway yeah

831
00:32:54,059 --> 00:32:59,039

832
00:32:56,039 --> 00:33:01,380

protect yourselves

as the liver and the body's filter gets

00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,599
sluggish and stagnant the blood can get

917
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:39,420
sluggish and stagnant the blood in the

918
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:42,660
liver gets sluggish and stagnant and it

919
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:45,060
can get more toxic where do these toxins

920
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:48,720
go they float around the bloodstream and

921
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:50,000
find their way to where here

922
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,560
foreign

923
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,540

00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,460
amounts

925
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:59,220
so exactly how they affect different

926
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:01,380
people varies these toxins saturate the

927
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:03,599
brain tissue and neurons diminish neuro

928
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:04,859
transmitter chemicals and can alter

929
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:08,900
somebody's mood

930
00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:08,900
see I'm just in a crappy mood right now

931
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:15,960
Jay Nessie says I'm new here

938
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:38,040
I just got one thing to say when I bring

939
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:40,280
out Dr Nesbitt from his surgery later do

940
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,280
not

941
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:46,079
do not not be a newbie anymore and then

942
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:48,420
don't say bye

943
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:50,640
stick around for Dr Nesbit

944
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:53,280
no seriously though um thank you for

945
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:55,800
reading the books and yes it's truth

946
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:58,079
Jackie B I'm so glad we learned the mm

947
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:00,420
info about blood draws now my husband

948
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:03,480
asked them to take half files and he

949
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:06,300
doesn't feel as awful afterward there

950
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:07,800
are serious ramifications from blood

951
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:10,560
draw

952
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:11,940
that go beyond anything anybody can even

953
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,520
imagine

954
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:16,200
I believe in getting blood work done for

955
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,820
people I want people to go to their

956
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,200
doctors and get blood work absolutely

957
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:21,839
there's nothing wrong with that if the

958
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:23,940
doctor wants it the point is is you have

959
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:26,700
to learn how to protect yourself because

960
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:29,400
the implications the ramifications are

961
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:31,260
serious they're dire

962
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:34,339
especially if you're struggling with any

963
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:34,339
kind of condition or symptom

964
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:46,079
toxic heavy metals such as mercury and

965
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:50,700
aluminum can sit inside the brain

966
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:53,160
and cause mood changes all on their own

967
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:55,500
toxic heavy metals wreak havoc on

968
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:57,480
people's brains

969
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:59,460
they can get a diagnosis of any kind

970
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:01,320
schizophrenia bipolar OCD

971
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:04,440
depersonalization depression anxiety

972
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:08,480
ever and 10 000 other diagnoses that are

973
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:08,480
brain related with toxic heavy metals

974
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:15,599
and they can that can happen without the

975
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,800
liver being toxic in dirty blood

976
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:19,260
syndrome

977
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,119
viruses inside the liver can feed off of

978
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:23,400
toxic heavy metals and release different

979
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:25,500
Brews of neurotoxins

980
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:28,020
some more potent than others which get

981
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:32,780
to the brain and make the brain Go funny

982
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:32,780
where oh my God I'm having mood changes

983
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:37,859
over here on Rumble

984
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:40,859
Neato 1988.

985
00:39:37,859 --> 00:39:43,320
I had low iron most of my life not now

986
00:39:40,859 --> 00:39:45,780
since on medical medium protocols

987
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:49,160
thank you Rumble person for being here

988
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:49,160
and thank you for commenting

989
00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:00,000
everything

990
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:02,160
is different in how their body handles a

991
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,859
toxic load everybody's different

992
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:07,440
one thing about medical medium info

993
00:40:04,859 --> 00:40:10,579
one it's not one size fits all

994
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,579
it's quite the opposite

995
00:40:10,859 --> 00:40:15,359
PK asks the aliens get moody

996
00:40:13,859 --> 00:40:16,680
I would love to answer that question

997
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:18,839
right now

998
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:21,240
see one person may not be swayed too

999
00:40:18,839 --> 00:40:22,980
easily to a dark place when their liver

1000
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:24,720
blood and brain are overloaded with

1001
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:26,040
toxic waste and poisons another person

1002
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:29,820
can be

1003
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:31,859
can be persuaded by it

1004
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:33,720
and go through a dark play be in a dark

1005
00:40:31,859 --> 00:40:36,060
place and struggle when someone is

1006
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:37,320
highly toxic mood changes can fluctuate

1007
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:39,180
up and down

1008
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:41,760
high in laho

1009
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:44,579
pan when you're toxic

1010
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:46,200
smooth changes can fluctuate all over

1011
00:40:44,579 --> 00:40:48,619
the place but it'll be blamed on

1012
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,619
hormones

1013
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:55,220
when someone's highly toxic mood changes

1014
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:55,220
can fluctuate up and down

1015
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:01,260
you can go to a new doctor

1016
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,920
if they won't listen about taking your

1017
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,920
blood draws

1018
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:07,619
if they won't listen about the

1019
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:09,420
information that's so critical Audrey

1020
00:41:07,619 --> 00:41:11,460
Lynn says even knowing that blood draws

1021
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:13,980
are not good when you tell the nurses to

1022
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:16,079
take less they do not listen saying they

1023
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:18,000
know what is needed and I can't control

1024
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:19,680
what they take once a needle's in your

1025
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,400
arm first of all

1026
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:26,220
the nurses don't know

1027
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:28,079
but the lab the blood lab will still run

1028
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:29,400
the tests and have and still throw away

1029
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,420
the rest of your blood because they have

1030
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,280
too much

1031
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:34,020
you could find doctors and nurses who

1032
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:35,400
will listen and there's a lot more now

1033
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:36,960
that are listening because of the

1034
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,700
medical medium information out there and

1035
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,680
the blood draw information

1036
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:42,859
because it is spreading and getting out

1037
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,859
there

1038
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:53,640
vampires Juliet

1039
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:55,500
Llewellyn says I asked the doctors for

1040
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:58,140
half files and was told it couldn't be

1041
00:41:55,500 --> 00:42:00,599
done as the labs need full vials

1042
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:02,820
I rang the lab in the phlebotist told me

1043
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:06,060
it would be fine as they do minimal

1044
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:08,240
amounts all the time exactly

1045
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:08,240
foreign

1046
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:12,920
Juliet because it's one big

1047
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:20,640
freaking lie

1048
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:23,339
it's one big lie

1049
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:26,220
nothing really is as we think it is

1050
00:42:23,339 --> 00:42:29,119
there's so much lying going on it's sick

1051
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:29,119
in the system

1052
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:35,280
I'm kind of confused

1053
00:42:32,099 --> 00:42:36,420
um how do they do a pediatric thyroid

1054
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:39,800
test

1055
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:39,800
and test all the same

1056
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:44,460
with this much blood

1057
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:46,680
from a baby can somebody tell me

1058
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:48,119
how can they can run all the entire

1059
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:50,760
thyroid profile with this much blood

1060
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:53,599
from a baby with baby vials

1061
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:53,599
can you tell me

1062
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:59,099
because it's BS and that's all they do

1063
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:01,700
is lie to every single patient it's

1064
00:42:59,099 --> 00:43:01,700
sickening

1065
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:07,339
they can test your blood sugar with a

1066
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,339
DOT of blood

1067
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:12,720
a drop a tiny drop of blood they can

1068
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:14,760
take blood that's on somebody's blue

1069
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:17,819
jeans that's sitting in a shallow grave

1070
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:21,000
because they were murdered 45 years ago

1071
00:43:17,819 --> 00:43:23,099
and they can scrape that blood and get a

1072
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,700
whole reading nutrient deficiencies

1073
00:43:23,099 --> 00:43:29,700
thyroid profile liver enzymes with a

1074
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:32,640
speck of dried out blood sitting in blue

1075
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:35,099
jeans 45 years ago in a grave

1076
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:36,720
oh but they need all that blood or they

1077
00:43:35,099 --> 00:43:38,940
need they need all that blood from you

1078
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:41,520
sure it's a scam

1079
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:44,339
read about it in the books pick up the

1080
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:47,220
books get the brain saver book learn

1081
00:43:44,339 --> 00:43:50,660
read about it because

1082
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:50,660
they're gonna get you one day

1083
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:54,119
and they'll get you in a vicious cycle

1084
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,500
and they'll drain your blood and drain

1085
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:57,540
your blood and drain your blood people

1086
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:58,800
die from it all the time that's all they

1087
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:00,839
get sicker and they take more blood

1088
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,560
sicker take more blood sicker and they

1089
00:44:00,839 --> 00:44:03,560
just pick on

1090
00:44:04,859 --> 00:44:09,720
all the blood donating to all the all

1091
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:11,040
the donating blood

1092
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:12,060
right

1093
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,220
that

1094
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:16,560
everybody does

1095
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:18,420
it doesn't go to hospitals where does it

1096
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,920
go well a fraction of it goes to

1097
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:21,480
hospitals where's the rest of it go I'm

1098
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:24,180
kind of curious

1099
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:27,240
are they feeding aliens where's it going

1100
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:29,220
is somebody drinking it I'd love to know

1101
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:31,040
guess who's donating blood

1102
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:33,839
sick women

1103
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:35,520
99.9 of all blood donors are sick women

1104
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:36,720
why are they telling sick women to

1105
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:39,079
donate their blood and get rid of all

1106
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,079
their blood

1107
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:49,460
and who's who's your

1108
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:49,460
cause it's not going to the hospitals

1109
00:44:49,859 --> 00:44:52,980
I'm kind of like confused on that one

1110
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:55,079
because it's not

1111
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:59,240
where's it going

1112
00:44:55,079 --> 00:44:59,240
is somebody drinking it I'd love to know

1113
00:44:59,579 --> 00:45:04,680
Jackie B my husband insisted he warned

1114
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:08,400
them that he has to lay down afterward

1115
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:10,619
if they do full vials

1116
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:13,319
that's just the immediate effect

1117
00:45:10,619 --> 00:45:15,060
that's not like a year from now

1118
00:45:13,319 --> 00:45:16,260
after you lost part of your immune

1119
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:17,819
system and it took six months to get

1120
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:18,960
your immune system back the effects

1121
00:45:17,819 --> 00:45:21,300
later

1122
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,940
I talk about it in the book here

1123
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:25,740
you guys I'm in an awful mood today do

1124
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:28,140
we have anything for that do you have

1125
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:31,200
anything to offer for because I'm in a

1126
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:33,619
bad mood is there anything I we can do

1127
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:37,260
the mood shifter Maria

1128
00:45:33,619 --> 00:45:42,079
says I thought a lot of my issues hold

1129
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:42,079
on hold on Maria it went somewhere

1130
00:45:42,839 --> 00:45:48,079
screen literally went boo and it was

1131
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:48,079
gone

1132
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:55,319
what happened

1133
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,480
all right let's keep on going here when

1134
00:45:55,319 --> 00:46:00,020
we find that comment if I can possibly

1135
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:00,020
find it

1136
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:08,040
another person with similar toxic loads

1137
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:10,079
may feel something terrible another

1138
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:11,940
person may not when someone's highly

1139
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:14,099
when someone is highly toxic their mood

1140
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:15,839
changes can fluctuate up and down high

1141
00:46:14,099 --> 00:46:19,280
and low and this could lead to a

1142
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:21,780
diagnosis like bipolar disorder

1143
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:25,260
depression seasonal infective disorder

1144
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:27,780
sad right Tourette's

1145
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:30,180
or OCD how many people get diagnosed

1146
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:34,579
with Tourette's syndrome

1147
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:34,579
when there's just really toxic

1148
00:46:38,819 --> 00:46:43,560
why does mood Express itself differently

1149
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:45,180
in two people with similar toxic loads

1150
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:47,280
childhood can play a role if someone

1151
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:49,920
grew up with tremendous family stability

1152
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:52,260
check that out right

1153
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:55,619
if someone grew up

1154
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:57,960
with tremendous family stability in

1155
00:46:55,619 --> 00:47:00,420
early years that gave them confidence

1156
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:02,640
and emotional support that can

1157
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:04,920
strengthen their path and journey

1158
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:06,900
someone else might have lacked that

1159
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:09,119
emotional support growing up

1160
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:10,740
one person might have had all the

1161
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:12,420
resources they needed when they were

1162
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:15,359
young and another person might have

1163
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:16,859
struggled with very few resources and

1164
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:19,920
unpredictability

1165
00:47:16,859 --> 00:47:22,380
that chain that tends to change people

1166
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:24,599
that can make a difference between

1167
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:25,920
just like differences with someone who's

1168
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:27,660
just as toxic as the other person

1169
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,940
they're both toxic but yet see the

1170
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:32,720
similar things can change

1171
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:32,720
in each person

1172
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:41,480
there is a full chapter on blood draw in

1173
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,480
brain saver

1174
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,460
when I was begging you guys to learn

1175
00:47:43,079 --> 00:47:46,560
about it I was

1176
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:48,780
begging for you guys to read the chapter

1177
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:52,760
and study it

1178
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:52,760
and hold on to that information

1179
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:58,700
you know

1180
00:47:56,060 --> 00:48:02,579
what's really like

1181
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:05,819
so crazy with medical medium information

1182
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:07,260
is that I always for some reason I think

1183
00:48:05,819 --> 00:48:10,260
that everybody

1184
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:12,300
in the community knows it

1185
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:15,240
and it throws me every time where I'm

1186
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:17,280
like okay well I did the blood draw

1187
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:19,560
podcast episode

1188
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:21,240
years ago

1189
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:23,040
but like when I talk about blood draw

1190
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:24,660
everybody's like what what are you

1191
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:26,520
talking about

1192
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:27,720
it like happens like that every second

1193
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:29,460
it's like

1194
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:32,460
it's almost like

1195
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:34,800
it's a community but I think for some

1196
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:36,960
reason everybody knows the info

1197
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:39,060
but then I realized

1198
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,440
there's probably a huge amount of the

1199
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:43,740
community that doesn't have all the

1200
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:44,940
books or maybe not even read one but

1201
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:46,920
they're here and I'm glad they're here

1202
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:50,579
I'm grateful they're here but the point

1203
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:52,140
is is that I realize that you can be in

1204
00:48:50,579 --> 00:48:55,740
the medical medium community and not

1205
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:58,020
even even heard the blood draw problem

1206
00:48:55,740 --> 00:49:00,180
you can be in the mm community and not

1207
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:01,200
even know Epstein-Barr causes this or

1208
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:03,180
that

1209
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,500
you can be like in the mm community and

1210
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:07,560
be like that's the first time I ever

1211
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:09,480
heard that about blood draw what

1212
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:11,579
you can be in the mm community and be

1213
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:13,319
like who's Dr Nesbitt

1214
00:49:11,579 --> 00:49:16,460
it's it's just it just blows me away

1215
00:49:13,319 --> 00:49:16,460
every time I'm like

1216
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:25,819
then there's an individual soul itself

1217
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:25,819
okay let's talk about the soul

1218
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:32,280
see Loney says when I was at the

1219
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:34,140
hospital all the time and got a lot of

1220
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:36,660
blood drawn I went into the hospital

1221
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:37,560
walking came out in a wheelchair every

1222
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:39,660
time

1223
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:41,339
I had to heal myself with a lot of B12

1224
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:44,700
for weeks

1225
00:49:41,339 --> 00:49:48,119
it's really sad because

1226
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:51,119
the system is set up

1227
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:53,700
to drain a sick person's

1228
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:56,760
vitality

1229
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:58,680
robbing and stealing their blood

1230
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:01,280
when they don't need that much blood for

1231
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:01,280
the tests

1232
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:07,140
the sick person gets sicker

1233
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:09,599
and sicker and sicker and when the sick

1234
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:12,839
person gets sicker

1235
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:15,960
the doctors take more blood

1236
00:50:12,839 --> 00:50:18,000
then the sick person gets even sicker

1237
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:19,980
and then the doctors say well you need

1238
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,359
to come in for more blood now

1239
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:22,560
because you're sicker and we need to

1240
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:25,500
know why

1241
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:27,780
eventually the person

1242
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:29,460
is too sick

1243
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:31,200
it's the saddest thing I've ever seen

1244
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:33,060
out there

1245
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:35,040
is a reason you have that much blood

1246
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:37,680
circulating in your body your body isn't

1247
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:40,140
a blood bag that just could be like

1248
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:42,300
squeezed out anywhere like a ketchup

1249
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:46,099
bottle

1250
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:46,099
at a busy picnic table

1251
00:50:48,119 --> 00:50:52,380
where everybody's slapping ketchup on

1252
00:50:50,099 --> 00:50:54,420
hot dogs and hamburgers left and right

1253
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:56,400
people are really depleted and low

1254
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:57,960
already with nutrients they have

1255
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,700
deficiencies they have electrolyte

1256
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:01,859
deficiencies they don't have enough B12

1257
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:04,020
in their their brain people already have

1258
00:51:01,859 --> 00:51:05,760
enough problems take too much blood out

1259
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:07,559
of them and constantly take blood out of

1260
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:09,660
them and they never restore I mean Jesus

1261
00:51:07,559 --> 00:51:12,980
Christ it's a serious problem it could

1262
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:12,980
really go really bad

1263
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:17,940
foreign

1264
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:20,540
and yes I said Jesus

1265
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:20,540
anyway

1266
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:26,760
Loney said I get kicked out of medical

1267
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:29,040
medium groups for sharing your exact

1268
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:30,059
words I hear that all the time Loney I

1269
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:33,180
hear there's a lot of medical meaning

1270
00:51:30,059 --> 00:51:36,059
groups that are just bait they're bait

1271
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:37,260
to get people in to push them to a

1272
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:39,540
different direction

1273
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:41,819
and so if you talk about medical medium

1274
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:44,520
info or stick up for medical medium in

1275
00:51:41,819 --> 00:51:46,559
those groups they kick you out

1276
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:48,180
but they try to use the medical medium

1277
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:49,680
name and pretend it's a medical game

1278
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:51,599
group

1279
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:53,460
I'm going to be kind of hammering down a

1280
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:55,319
little bit on that because it's it's

1281
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:57,119
actually really sad it got to the point

1282
00:51:55,319 --> 00:51:59,099
where I'm actually really

1283
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:02,099
scared for people who are trying to seek

1284
00:51:59,099 --> 00:52:05,040
out help and heal what's happening is

1285
00:52:02,099 --> 00:52:07,079
there's groups now that they

1286
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:09,000
it's not about mm info it's not about

1287
00:52:07,079 --> 00:52:10,260
mmm truth it's not about any of that

1288
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,599
it's like

1289
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:14,700
it's not about like healing people

1290
00:52:12,599 --> 00:52:16,440
really because they siphon people in

1291
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:18,300
because it's a medical meme group and

1292
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:20,880
then they try to get them doing

1293
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:22,920
different things there is one in Germany

1294
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:24,480
that was like doing that everybody went

1295
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:26,099
in it turned out it was just a medical

1296
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,420
meme hate group but nobody knew but

1297
00:52:26,099 --> 00:52:29,160
everybody thought it was a medical

1298
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:30,660
medium group and they just filed in and

1299
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:32,579
filed in it turned out it was just a

1300
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:35,280
medical medium hate group and it was

1301
00:52:32,579 --> 00:52:37,559
siphoning people in and then telling

1302
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,760
them all this other stuff so that you

1303
00:52:37,559 --> 00:52:39,839
know like you know what I mean and it's

1304
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:41,040
like that everywhere now it's like

1305
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:42,720
there's a lot of groups not all of them

1306
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:45,420
but there's a lot of groups they're

1307
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:46,980
siphoning people in and then they're

1308
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:49,619
getting them to do this person's

1309
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:51,480
protocols this person's belief system

1310
00:52:49,619 --> 00:52:53,160
this person's whatever and then you're

1311
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:54,900
back to that again okay great if that's

1312
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:56,160
what you want to do but then don't

1313
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:58,619
trick

1314
00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:02,000
people and getting them in thinking it's

1315
00:52:58,619 --> 00:53:02,000
going to be on them info I want to stop

1316
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:09,380
all right what a mood day okay can I

1317
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:13,339
just say this that yes

1318
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:13,339
I'm not in the greatest mood

1319
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:18,540
all right

1320
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:20,640
why does mood Express itself different

1321
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:22,859
in two people I talked about that then

1322
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:25,859
there's an individual soul itself which

1323
00:53:22,859 --> 00:53:29,240
is unique to each of us your soul is

1324
00:53:25,859 --> 00:53:33,359
unique my soul is unique

1325
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:36,440
your soul is unique

1326
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:36,440
critical to know

1327
00:53:37,079 --> 00:53:42,180
it could be fragile from being tattered

1328
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:43,920
along the way and God knows our souls

1329
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:47,160
have been tattered along the way many

1330
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:49,440
people become wounded in life

1331
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:52,319
and soul wounds can make a person more

1332
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:53,819
sensitive too I mean a lot of us take a

1333
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:55,380
lot of heat remember I told you our soul

1334
00:53:53,819 --> 00:53:57,960
gets propelled out of us so it doesn't

1335
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:59,940
get totally damaged it protects it but

1336
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:03,720
it still gets it still has to live in

1337
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:06,480
here afterwards when it comes back in

1338
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:08,760
many people believe many people become

1339
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:11,160
wounded in life and soul wounds can make

1340
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:12,839
a person more sensitive affecting how

1341
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:16,319
they cope process or deal with

1342
00:54:12,839 --> 00:54:19,940
circumstances involving other people

1343
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:19,940
that can reflect the mood

1344
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:25,800
Tammy starts Ben says I was on meds

1345
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:27,660
growing up for seizures

1346
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:30,119
they took my blood every few months

1347
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:32,099
every time it would induce a seizure at

1348
00:54:30,119 --> 00:54:34,020
the lab really scary I talk about that

1349
00:54:32,099 --> 00:54:36,240
in brain saver

1350
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:38,339
prime example right there

1351
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:40,740
prime example because they were removing

1352
00:54:38,339 --> 00:54:43,619
all the electrolytes

1353
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:46,280
grid and glucose

1354
00:54:43,619 --> 00:54:46,280
critical

1355
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:54,240
someone can be dealing with all the

1356
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:55,800
above they could be so what I mean by

1357
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:57,359
that all kinds of problems that we

1358
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:59,880
already discussed about what could be a

1359
00:54:57,359 --> 00:55:02,400
mood trigger they could be experiencing

1360
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:04,079
toxic heavy metals in the brain a highly

1361
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:06,540
toxic liver I talked about filled with

1362
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:08,339
pathogens and poisons that's caused it

1363
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:10,260
to become more stagnant sluggish so that

1364
00:55:08,339 --> 00:55:12,359
the dirty blood develops in a tattered

1365
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:14,099
soul from a journey through life that

1366
00:55:12,359 --> 00:55:17,040
has been very difficult

1367
00:55:14,099 --> 00:55:18,839
all happening at once or they could be

1368
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:21,420
dealing with one factor or some

1369
00:55:18,839 --> 00:55:24,900
combination everyone has a different

1370
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:26,880
variation mood is no mood is so much

1371
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:29,160
bigger than chalking it all up to

1372
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:30,300
hormones

1373
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:34,920

00:57:37,319 --> 00:57:42,240
situation where you're struggling

1420
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:44,760
Catherine Elizabeth sadly my son had a

1421
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:49,079
seizure at three and a half years old

1422
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:52,460
after they took 20 vials of blood

1423
00:57:49,079 --> 00:57:52,460
that will always haunt me

1424
00:57:57,780 --> 00:58:04,740
quiet after that because

1425
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:07,260
it gets it actually gets me upset

1426
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:09,240
because there's no need for that that to

1427
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:12,619
happen out there but the system creates

1428
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:12,619
that it's not your fault

1429
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:19,339
all right

1430
00:58:19,559 --> 00:58:25,460

01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:42,780
throwing that lime in there and that's a

1480
01:00:41,579 --> 01:00:45,780
small lime

1481
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:49,640
but I think we should be good

1482
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:49,640
one stalk of celery

1483
01:00:51,299 --> 01:00:57,240
all right half cups of grapes a half cup

1484
01:00:54,359 --> 01:01:01,400
of grapes optional

1485
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:01,400
it's optional I happen to have some

1486
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:06,960
now what's amazing about the mood

1487
01:01:04,799 --> 01:01:09,240
shifter it's optional it's very

1488
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:11,579
compassion said I love when very few

1489
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:15,140
times it's optional with the mood

1490
01:01:11,579 --> 01:01:15,140
shifter this one works

1491
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:20,339
okay I'm also going to put some this

1492
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:23,640
one's done here I'm gonna pop some wild

1493
01:01:20,339 --> 01:01:25,260
blueberry powder in here and mix it

1494
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:27,599
because I'm using the powder I'm not

1495
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:30,540
using the fresh or frozen wild

1496
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:33,200
blueberries I'm using the powder in here

1497
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:33,200
foreign

1498
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:40,559
teaspoon

1499
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:44,359
pure wild blueberry powder right there I

1500
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:44,359
got Sprouts all over the container

1501
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:48,960
now what's incredible and I'm going to

1502
01:01:47,339 --> 01:01:52,220
say this

1503
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:52,220
I'll say it once

1504
01:01:53,940 --> 01:01:59,760
there's no anti

1505
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:01,740
bonding agents in here okay there's no

1506
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:03,960
agents in here

1507
01:02:01,740 --> 01:02:06,380
what people don't realize in the powders

1508
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:06,380
out there

1509
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:13,319
they don't realize they put like an

1510
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:16,920
anti-bonding agent in the powders out

1511
01:02:13,319 --> 01:02:18,480
there vimergy does not do that

1512
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:20,400
by the way you guys you know I endorse

1513
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:22,020
them the whole bit for all these reasons

1514
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:23,640
and this is one of the big ones and I

1515
01:02:22,020 --> 01:02:25,500
never had a chance to ever tell you guys

1516
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:28,079
about it

1517
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:30,119
but I wanted to so I'm just gonna say it

1518
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:32,579
now

1519
01:02:30,119 --> 01:02:36,000
what you'll notice the barley grass

1520
01:02:32,579 --> 01:02:39,059
juice powder the spirulina

1521
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:42,059
there's no anti-caking agents in here

1522
01:02:39,059 --> 01:02:43,859
critical to know

1523
01:02:42,059 --> 01:02:46,559
I don't even know what to say besides

1524
01:02:43,859 --> 01:02:49,260
that's the best news I can ever be

1525
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:51,000
handed in my like Consciousness my mind

1526
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:54,839
when I'm using this stuff do I want an

1527
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:56,220
anti-caking agent in my powders

1528
01:02:54,839 --> 01:02:57,720
and when people don't realize when they

1529
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:59,220
buy all these powders out there all the

1530
01:02:57,720 --> 01:03:01,140
green powders and these patterns and

1531
01:02:59,220 --> 01:03:03,240
chlorella powders and spirulina powders

1532
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:04,380
whatever they're using they don't

1533
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:06,960
realize it

1534
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:09,140
there's an agent in there to stop the

1535
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:10,680
powder from caking

1536
01:03:09,140 --> 01:03:12,660
undisclosed

1537
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:14,339
in all the powders

1538
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:16,500
keep that in mind

1539
01:03:14,339 --> 01:03:18,119
and so when you're dealing with this

1540
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:22,020
company Bemidji

1541
01:03:18,119 --> 01:03:24,660
they don't put that powder in the powder

1542
01:03:22,020 --> 01:03:26,880
they don't do that anti-bonding agent

1543
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:29,280
anti-caking agent

1544
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:31,920
inside the powder

1545
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:34,020
and so okay fine then you might get

1546
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:35,880
clumpiness but I will take clumpiness

1547
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:38,880
any day

1548
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:40,920
any day this is incredible stuff right

1549
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:42,420
here you see where like one might be a

1550
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:44,339
little clumped together

1551
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:47,280
I don't care if there's a little

1552
01:03:44,339 --> 01:03:49,319
clumpiness going on I know how clean and

1553
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:52,380
pure that stuff is

1554
01:03:49,319 --> 01:03:54,000
because I don't have to say oh great uh

1555
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:57,059
I'm using a pattern has all that

1556
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:59,099
antibody bonding agents in here

1557
01:03:57,059 --> 01:04:03,540
like that's disgusting like I don't want

1558
01:03:59,099 --> 01:04:05,880
to eat that so memory from my knowledge

1559
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:07,200
is the only company that doesn't use

1560
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:09,240
that stuff

1561
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:10,799
I wanted to make that clear because what

1562
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:12,420
people don't realize

1563
01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:13,559
when they use the barley grass juice

1564
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:16,799
powder

1565
01:04:13,559 --> 01:04:18,540
that if it's clumped together

1566
01:04:16,799 --> 01:04:22,140
it's a good thing

1567
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:24,500
that means they didn't put that

1568
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:27,059
gross bonding agent in their

1569
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:28,980
anti-bonding agent in there so important

1570
01:04:27,059 --> 01:04:32,220
to know I'm just saying I just wanted to

1571
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:33,780
kind of let you know that it's critical

1572
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:36,599
anyway it's wild blueberry powder right

1573
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:39,799
there from beveraging

1574
01:04:36,599 --> 01:04:39,799
I'm mixing this up

1575
01:04:43,799 --> 01:04:46,579
all right

1576
01:04:50,819 --> 01:04:55,799
I need the mood shifter man as you guys

1577
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:59,599

1578
01:04:55,799 --> 01:04:59,599
my mood hasn't been good today

1579
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:05,420

1580
01:05:02,819 --> 01:05:05,420
topics

1581
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:13,740
mixed up

1582
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:17,040

money

1591

bottom line and you know why because

1592
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:40,319
that pulp is drier and when that bulb is

1593
01:05:38,099 --> 01:05:42,000
dryer you save money the less produce

1594
01:05:40,319 --> 01:05:44,760

01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,359

01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:21,059

and I'll endorse them a billion times

1620
01:06:36,839 --> 01:06:40,740
over because of this it's this kind of

1621
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:42,059
stuff they do that you can't get

1622
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:45,000
anywhere else

1623
01:06:42,059 --> 01:06:48,859

1625
01:06:48,859 --> 01:06:54,260

all right let's drink this shot

1627
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:03,480
let's see Kate Maris says I always

1628
01:07:01,140 --> 01:07:06,119
wondered why the cheap spirulina was so

1629
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:08,400
easier to stir so glad to hear this Kate

1630
01:07:06,119 --> 01:07:13,099
that's exactly why

1631
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:13,099
100 exactly why I

1632
01:07:14,039 --> 01:07:18,660

1636
01:07:24,599 --> 01:07:28,020
I need to come out of this bad mood

1637
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:30,480
somehow

1638
01:07:28,020 --> 01:07:31,920
I mean I actually almost want to cry for

1639
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:33,839
some reason

1640
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:35,940
we're talking about like all kinds of

1641
01:07:33,839 --> 01:07:38,539
things

1642
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:38,539
like

1643
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:42,079
like I need something

1644
01:07:42,359 --> 01:07:45,960
I wasn't planning on being in a bad mood

1645
01:07:44,579 --> 01:07:47,579
today I wasn't

1646
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:48,900
there's just a lot of talk we were

1647
01:07:47,579 --> 01:07:50,819
talking about

1648
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:54,359
this is the whole iron thing the blood

1649
01:07:50,819 --> 01:07:56,339
draw thing right I'm I feel bad for

1650
01:07:54,359 --> 01:07:58,859
people going through hell and then being

1651
01:07:56,339 --> 01:08:00,660
driven in directions that actually make

1652
01:07:58,859 --> 01:08:03,059
them worse is that gonna put me in a bad

1653
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:05,220
mood yes it is

1654
01:08:03,059 --> 01:08:06,780
all the way down to the fact that all

1655
01:08:05,220 --> 01:08:08,940
the other powders have anti-caking

1656
01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:10,559
agents in there and stuff and these

1657
01:08:08,940 --> 01:08:12,539
don't like

1658
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:14,819
all the way to the thefting of medical

1659
01:08:12,539 --> 01:08:17,699
medium information in the medical medium

1660
01:08:14,819 --> 01:08:19,920
Community groups

1661
01:08:17,699 --> 01:08:23,189

no no it's okay you can say that yeah

1708
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:34,920
Dr Elizabeth says that

1709
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:37,199
because he's a certified psychiatrist

1710
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:39,719
that he said that

1711
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:40,980
he will gladly treat

1712
01:10:39,719 --> 01:10:42,960
because he's a board-certified

1713
01:10:40,980 --> 01:10:46,580

with any kind of mood problems

1715
01:10:46,739 --> 01:10:51,840
if they're a chicken

1716
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:53,760
so Dr Nesbitt they have do they have to

1717
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:55,320
be a chicken for real

1718
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:57,120
Darkness but says they have to be a

1719
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:59,580
chicken but they're not chickens Dr

1720
01:10:57,120 --> 01:11:02,420
Nesbit they're actually people

1721
01:10:59,580 --> 01:11:02,420
they're humans

1722
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:06,020
he says what do you think I'm stupid

1723
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:10,440
he says I'm not stupid I know they're

1724
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:12,480
humans

1725
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:13,440
he says he does surgical procedures on

1726
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:15,840
humans

1727
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:17,760
all the time he works on humans he's not

1728
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:20,580
a chicken surgeon he's a human surgeon

1729
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:23,580
but he only does Psychiatry for chickens

1730
01:11:20,580 --> 01:11:26,640
why I don't get it

1731
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:31,140
chickens have a lot of emotional wounds

1732
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:33,600
and a lot of soul wounds right

1733
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:36,000
yeah I can only imagine

1734
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:38,840
um Dr Nesbitt is just wants to say one

1735
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,840
thing to newbies

1736
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:45,440

1737
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:45,440
and being here

1738
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:50,100
Dr Nesbitt

1739
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:51,199
where's Beatrice

1740
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:55,020
doctor

1741
01:11:51,199 --> 01:11:59,000
says Beatrice is on a vacation

1742
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:59,000
away from Dr Nesbitt

1743
01:11:59,159 --> 01:12:02,340
all right well when is she going to come

1744
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:04,920
back

1745
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:06,719
said she may never come back

1746
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:08,520
she may not come back ever again she

1747
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:10,860
feels like she was humiliated and

1748
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:13,080
insulted

1749
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:15,300
um the last time she was here

1750
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:17,640
and she feels like she was not heard or

1751
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:19,560
validated because Dr Nesbitt is very

1752
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:23,300
dominating

1753
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:23,300
he was dominating a conversation

1754
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:30,179

01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:31,620

Sue's fantastic

1763
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:51,540
Dr Nesbitt said that if you were a

1764
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:53,699
chicken he would

1765
01:12:51,540 --> 01:12:56,159
offer you a session

1766

1768
01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:04,699

1772
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:14,480
Dr Nesbitt

you're upset because you didn't get

1774
01:13:16,140 --> 01:13:21,060
offered one Dr Nesbitt is in a terrible

1775
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:23,040
mood today

1776
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:26,159
let me just make sure I can help out in

1777
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:27,760
some way Dr Nesbitt said that when he

1778
01:13:26,159 --> 01:13:29,280
got to the office

1779
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:32,960
[Music]

1780
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:32,960
the anesthesiologist

1781
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:38,100
um

1782
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:41,040
was late and the patient

1783
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:43,440
was waiting for surgery for a very long

1784
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:45,960
time an anesthesiologist

1785
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:48,840
was not helpful and then the

1786
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:51,679
anesthesiologist gave the patient too

1787
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:51,679
much anesthesia

1788
01:13:51,780 --> 01:13:55,320
Dr Smith

1789
01:13:53,159 --> 01:13:56,940
and he said that the patient took three

1790
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:59,460
days to wake up

1791
01:13:56,940 --> 01:14:01,260
after the surgery but the surgery was

1792
01:13:59,460 --> 01:14:02,760
today that doesn't make any sense Dr

1793
01:14:01,260 --> 01:14:05,400
Nesbitt says it doesn't matter if it

1794
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:07,440
makes sense he says that he's just

1795
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:10,500
telling me he had a bad day

1796
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:12,179
I just want to say

1797
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:15,659
and

1798
01:14:12,179 --> 01:14:18,659

1803
01:14:26,340 --> 01:14:30,600
Dr nesbitt's already drinking and he

1804
01:14:29,159 --> 01:14:32,520
said that this

1805
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:36,020
smoothie is delicious

1806
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:36,020
recognize but it's not a smoothie

1807
01:14:36,420 --> 01:14:40,260
Dr Elizabeth said this smoothie drink is

1808
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:42,120
amazing

1809
01:14:40,260 --> 01:14:44,040
Darkness but it's not a smoothie it's

1810
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:46,260
the mood shifter

1811
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:48,300
what are you talking about

1812
01:14:46,260 --> 01:14:50,820
Darkness but said

1813
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:52,440
good heavy metal detox smoothie this is

1814
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:54,060
not the heavy metal deep the problem is

1815
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:56,159
with Dr Nesbitt he really doesn't know

1816
01:14:54,060 --> 01:14:57,960
the information really well he just

1817
01:14:56,159 --> 01:15:00,540
knows of things that you know he's heard

1818
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:02,580
where's Peggy and Donnie he said Peggy

1819
01:15:00,540 --> 01:15:04,739

eat a lot and Donnie tends to throw up a

1823
01:15:10,739 --> 01:15:15,659
lot and the between the both of them Dr

1824
01:15:13,620 --> 01:15:18,060
Nesbit says they embarrass him wherever

1825
01:15:15,659 --> 01:15:20,520
they go

1826
01:15:18,060 --> 01:15:22,640
