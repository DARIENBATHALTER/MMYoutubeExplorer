1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,210
science protects itself is what it does

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:08,130
in chronic illness not in some other

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:11,190
things because I love science research

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:13,650
but it protects itself in chronic

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:16,619
illness it doesn't protect the person

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:18,960
that's what it does by saying it's your

7
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:21,210
fault by saying you're the cause of your

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,289
illness by saying it's your body your

9
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,119
immune system

10
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:26,189
it protects signs of research because

11
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:27,960
they don't know the answers yet and it

12
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:29,609
puts the blame on you and what's the

13
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,170
best way to do it for science and

14
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:33,149
research and the conventional way and

15
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:36,630
even the alternative way now put the

16
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:40,079
blame on the woman put the blame on her

17
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:43,590
on her body being faulty on her being a

18
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,120
bad person on her being you know an

19
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,340
emotional problem with her illness

20
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,860
calling or you know maybe like it's all

21
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,960
in her head by saying you're crazy or

22
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,940
you're just bored or lazy or tired but

23
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,410
you're not really sick that's happened

24
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,410
for decades still it happens today
