1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,040
and this is in a nutshell to make it as

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:07,140
easy as possible you need two things to

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,269
be chronically ill two things to have a

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,610
symptom that won't go away two things

5
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:14,040
that makes your life say let you know

6
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:18,060
the less quality of life two things have

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,859
to be there toxins and pathogens you

8
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,109
need two things there that's what you

9
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:24,539
need and that's what's happening

10
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:28,380
everyone's building a lot of toxins up

11
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:31,830
and they're catching a lot of pathogens

12
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:34,469
that's what's happening and bottom line

13
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:38,010
all these illnesses everything behind

14
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:41,670
autoimmune is a virus or even bacteria

15
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:43,230
involved or both and some poisons for it

16
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,719
to feed on so to make it really simple

17
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:47,430
really simple you have certain toxins in

18
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:50,879
your body and they become food for

19
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:53,969
certain bugs pathogens pathogens eat the

20
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:57,680
toxins they release a poison and we all

21
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:57,680
get sick and sicker and sicker
