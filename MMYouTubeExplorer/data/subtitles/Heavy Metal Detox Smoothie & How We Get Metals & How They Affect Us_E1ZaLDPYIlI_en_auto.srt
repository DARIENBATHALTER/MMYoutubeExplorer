that's the power this has and that's

74
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:43,760
what this has a track record of doing

75
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,080
and then the heavy metal detox smoothie

76
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,000
has

77
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:50,640
never been better it's at the point now

78
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,080
where the ingredients are perfected what

79
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,879
i mean by that

80
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,840
is i haven't had a chance until pretty

81
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,959
recently

82
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,040
for the best spirulina and for the best

83
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,440
barley grass juice powder that you can

84
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,080
ever

85
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,000
use in a heavy metal detox smoothie and

86
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,239
that played a big role because

87
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,440
over the years i've had to use inferior

88
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,599
spirulinas

89
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,040
i've had to use inferior barley grass

90
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,760
juice powders

91
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,440
and i even had to use barley grass

92
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,000
before we can get a barley grass juice

93
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,400
powder out

94
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,760
there so the heavy so what happens is

95
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,400
when i was younger

96
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,959
spirit of compassion told me when i was

97
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,200
seven

98
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,879
eight years old nine years old about the

99
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,680
medical medium heavy metal detox

100
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,080
smoothie

101
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,959
and what the ingredients were and how to

102
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,840
use them

103
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,920
but it was hard to get the ingredients

104
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,799
it was hard to get the wild blueberry at

105
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,040
that time

106
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,959
it was hard to get a spirulina that was

107
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,200
worthy it was hard to get

108
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,280
a barley grass that was worthy it was

109
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,480
hard to get anything really

110
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,519
and so as the years gone by and i can

111
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,080
get the best

112
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,239
ingredients to actually make it work up

113
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,120

114
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,640

metal detox smoothie

135
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,840
is at its most powerful because

136
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,440
i got the wild blueberries i use the

137
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,840
weinman's wild blueberries

138
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,000

139
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,639
vimergy spirulina barley grass juice

142
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,880
best ingredients

143
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,520
there are to date and what that means is

144
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,800
even speedier more speedier recoveries

145
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,600

152
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,160
anything

153
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,240
out there to reverse somebody's

154
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,280
parkinson's to reverse somebody's

155
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,759
alzheimer's

156
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,960
to reverse somebody's memory loss to

157
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,639
reverse somebody's

158
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:32,160
ocd condition tourette's condition okay

159
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,240
to reverse any of this there's never

160
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,680
been anything out there okay you take a

161
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,720
drug and you hope that it kind of

162
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,360
minimizes it

163
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,080
that's the best it does okay that's all

164
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,800
you can do

165
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,639
and even gastroparesis can be toxic

166
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,280
heavy metals at times

167
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,320
so and that has been reversed in a lot

168
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,479
of different people

169
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,479
over the years when doing the medical

170
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,080
medium heavy metal detox smoothie

171
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,319
because you're dealing with the nervous

172
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,479
system versus a nervous system

173
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,919
gastroparesis with toxic heavy metals

174
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:03,280
affecting those nerves

175
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:06,400
so we've never been in a place now

176
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,479
where it's been so perfect and the

177
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,680

178
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:13,039
a condition and this is just

179
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,800
the these are just some of the

180
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,360

in the medical medium community all

194
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,919
right are reversing their excellent

195
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,400
psoriasis

196
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,560
for decades now getting rid of just

197
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,080
thousands and thousands of cases of

198
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,560
excellent psoriasis

199
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,319
and dermatitis and vitiligo and other

200
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,000
conditions like that and rosacea

201
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,680
is because they've used the medical

202
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,319
medium heavy metal detox smoothie and

203
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:05,280
they've gotten the metals out which

204
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:07,039
took metals away from viruses and

205
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,160
pathogens

206
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:13,599
toxic heavy metals are in everybody they

207
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:16,720
are the food that feeds the bugs

208
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:20,240
see guys metals feed

209
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,880
bugs that's how it works right and so

210
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,000
to get the metals out and get large

211
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,960
quantities of

212
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,400
metals out of the body you need a

213
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,120
powerful tool

214
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,840
a powerful weapon and something that

215
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,759
works

216
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,520
now be different if i was sitting here

217
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,560
saying well you know i don't know what

218
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,240
science says

219
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,000
and i don't know what works or doesn't

220
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,639
maybe collagen could work maybe it

221
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,800
doesn't

222
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,000
maybe charcoal works and it doesn't

223
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,680
maybe something else but

224
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,680
here's the deal and here's the

225
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,400
difference there's already a track

226
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,520
record

227
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,400
there's already a proven factual track

228
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,520
record

229
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,400
street cred that this heavy metal detox

230
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,680
smoothie

231
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:02,000
has reverse conditions even save lives

232
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:05,080
got people's lives better and that right

233
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,680
there is indisputable

234
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:10,479
indisputable right there

235
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,479
so i'm gonna make this for you i'm gonna

236
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,160
talk about where we get our toxic heavy

237
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,919
metals where do they come from

238
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,440
how do we get them how do they enter the

239
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:20,800
body what

240
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,879
forms okay and i'm going to talk about

241
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,199
the best way to make it using the best

242
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:28,560
stuff that's the stuff i use

243
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,879
now it matters if i'm using something

244
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,800
because that means it's the best and

245
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,839
that matters to the people who know me

246
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,399
my friends

247
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,760
my family anybody who knows of me and

248
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,760
wants to try something

249
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,760
knowing that i'm using something they're

250
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,800
like okay well that's the best one

251
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:48,240
why would he put something in him

252
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,839
that's not the best and so

253
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,279
and this medical medium heavy metal

254
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,640
detox smoothie is

255
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:56,320
at its epic height of perfection at this

256
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,880
point in time in history

257
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,839
because i've been blessed to discover

258
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,399
and find

259
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,360
products that actually take it to the

260
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,560
next level

261
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,519
because i've had to suffer with inferior

262
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,600
products

263
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,040
in spirit of compassion's heavy metal

264
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,519
detox smoothie

265
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,399
and that's been a problem so over the

266
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,880
years

267
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,240
i've had to use a pacific pacific

268
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,279
spirulina

269
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:24,000
and it was okay it was as good as you

270
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,760
can get at the time many years ago right

271
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,320
and then when something came along

272
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,560
better i was able to dump that

273
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,680
and move on to something that was so

274
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,240
much better

275
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,680
the same thing with dolls and the same

276
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,000
thing with other things i was able to

277
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,440
move

278
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,560
on and get the best stuff out there

279
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:46,160
that there is to make this that epic

280
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,360
level of healing the taking it to its

281
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,760
full capacity

282
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,040
to get somebody better to get somebody

283
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,120
out of bed

284
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,120
to get them recovered to get them

285
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,959
healing to get their life back

286
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,959
to get rid of that crippling anxiety

287
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:01,600
that severe depression

288
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:03,440
and get their memory back get rid of

289
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,000
that depersonalization and that's just

290
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,839
some of the

291
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,760
things the medical medium heavy metal

292
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,880
detox smoothie has done

293
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:13,279
and so it's come to a point now

294
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,399
where unless something comes out there

295
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,880
that's better

296
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,560
than like what i'm holding in my hand as

297
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,720
far as the ingredients you see

298
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,000
as far as the beemergy spirulina and

299
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,399
barley grass until

300
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,839
something comes someday that would be a

301
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,079
different story right now that's the

302
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,360
best and this is at this epic place

303
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,279
i see something right there from cheryl

304
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,720
what would cause high level of arsenic

305
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,040
other than rice

306
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,800
apple was recently tested for heavy

307
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,680
metals and arsenic was

308
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,560
only one only one that was high please

309
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,200
advise

310
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,079
arsenic's in water so where's your water

311
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,680
supply

312
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,440
what's going on with that what's your

313
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,600
water supply in your body

314
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,560
keep that in mind arsenic can be in

315
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,920
pipes

316
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:56,959
so it's another thing too they have made

317
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,600
uh solder in all the pipes that had

318
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,560
arsenic in it so in all your plumbing

319
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,480
pipes

320
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,000
if you got a well your well pump can

321
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,800
have arsenic in it

322
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,640
there's arsenic in soil too and i'll

323
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,120
talk about that in a little bit too

324
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,399
so are you gardening in your garden are

325
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,560
the farms you're eating

326
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,240
local food that you're eating local

327
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,000
because a lot of farms use water

328
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,279
supplies that have arsenic in it and i'm

329
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,560
not talking about conventional talk

330
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,839
about organic

331
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,480
so arsenic's high in all organic food

332
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,200
out there

333
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,480
so keep that in mind too so organic food

334
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,040
has arsenic because

335
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,200
organic all kinds of organic food grown

336
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,200
they use water they have to pump in and

337
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,680
they don't test that water

338
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,760
and they pump that in and so and

339
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,920
non-organic foods really high

340
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,279
in arsenic so those are things there too

341
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,519
we also breathe it in

342
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,640
it drops out of the sky it comes from

343
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,440
different areas

344
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,880
and if you have farms conventional farms

345
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,200
nearby

346
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,240
arsenic is in pesticides herbicides

347
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,839
fungicides

348
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,519
so keep that in mind too it's in

349
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,480
herbicides pesticides

350
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:02,000
fungicides it's on new clothing so if

351
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,720
you buy a new clothing

352
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,240
it's fresh on the clothing arsenic's in

353
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,560
grass-fed beef

354
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,279
very high in grass-fed beef it's high in

355
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,240
lamb

356
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,880
it's high in and so it's out there and

357
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,160
that

358
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,320
that question is really important

359
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,279
because it leads me to the part i want

360
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,480
to talk about

361
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:23,200
is we have toxic heavy metals everywhere

362
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,320
and they have completely invaded our

363
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,200
lives

364
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,000
at this point in time so it's important

365
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,160
to know

366
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,200
like where they come from and how to

367
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,079
defend ourselves

368
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,040
and one way to defend ourselves is using

369
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:38,959
a tool

370
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:41,440
that has already worked for years

371
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,480
tool that doctors have been using for

372
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,079
their patients for

373
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,079
decades when i've been teaching about

374
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,399
the heavy metal detox smoothie

375
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,240
and it's critical it's not just about

376
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,120
hey have a little garlic that removes

377
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,279
some metals or

378
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,399
make something up like some people have

379
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,680
out there that

380
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,519
you know they'll say oh this helps

381
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,880
remove metals apple cider vinegar

382
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,519
can help move metals no it can't acv

383
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,560
doesn't

384
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:07,440
but it takes a combination

385
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,399
that i've been given from my source

386
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,600
starting

387
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:14,880
as a child and then watching it

388
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:17,920
bring lives back get people

389
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,880
out of mattress island get people out of

390
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,760
hell

391
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,320
to get rise out of the ashes and it's

392
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,519
not just

393
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:28,800
one person it's not just my

394
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,920
neighbor back 30 years ago who couldn't

395
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,760
walk

396
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,120
because of toxic heavy metal poisoning

397
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,120
and nobody knew

398
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,160
and then spirit of compassion knew and

399
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,880
then had

400
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,800
her do the heavy metal detox movie and

401
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,360
she was walking fine and got her life

402
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,720

into and

415
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:11,279
this has historic history

416
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,000
of working for doctors of

417
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:15,519
getting alzheimer's patients walking and

418
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,279
talking again

419
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,600
getting people out of crippling

420
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,399
depression where they were literally

421
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,760
seized up

422
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:27,120
in their bed rolling around and dying

423
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:30,320
from depression and having them sip

424
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,240
this and move out of it getting rid of

425
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,160
debilitating migraines that were toxic

426
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,480
heavy metal caused

427
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,680
eyesight problems people that were

428
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,560
half-blind

429
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,680
for no reason three-quarters blind for

430
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,040
no reason

431
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,160
got their sight back because of this

432
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,160
right here

433
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,600

people's time like people that got into

447
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,639

three years ago people that got into

449
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,120
health

450
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:17,600
10 years ago this is way before that

451
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:21,279
time this has more integrity

452
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:24,480
more merit more historic

453
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:25,279
truth of people crawling back from

454
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,600
sickness

455
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:30,399

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,480
thing i'm going to tell you

461
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,680
is science research didn't know and

465
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,440
heavy metals

466
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,199
but they're starting to figure out and

467
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,560
they're starting to take it the

468
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,320
information's starting to get out there

469
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,240

477
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,480
okay if you learn the history of medical

478
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,959
medium

479
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,240
you might want to get this right here

480
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:18,560

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,480
the origins of a medical medium read

482
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,480
this chapter out of the new edition

483
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,759
so you can learn okay what happened

484
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,839
since i was age four

485
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,120
because of having to do readings on

486
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,519
people having to

487
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,360
see what's wrong inside their body i

488
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,759
spent 30 years

489
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,639
working with people one-on-one over 250

490
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,880
000 people

491
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,399
over the last 30 years before publishing

492
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,199
the medical medium books

493
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,839
and with that comes a price the price is

494
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,839
i get

495
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,680
what's called snow blindness i've talked

496
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,959
about in the books i've lectured about

497
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,519
it for years

498
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:51,199
it's what spirit of compassion does

499
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,920
sends down a light

500
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:56,480
makes it difficult for me to see in the

501
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,320
moment because all i see is your organs

502
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,240
i'll see your liver i'll see your

503
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,440
pancreas i'll see your intestinal tract

504
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,440
i'll see your brain

505
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,280
i'll see your bloodstream i'll see

506
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,520
viruses inside your body

507
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:10,000
wherever spirit of compassion tea has

508
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,559
has given me the gift and the sight to

509
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,280
see

510
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:15,520
but that white light is very blinding

511
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,720
and what it does is it makes me squint

512
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,839
now when i'm at home when i'm around

513
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,400
some friends

514
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,959
when i'm actually you know around uh you

515
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,520
know maybe

516
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,959
my family i don't use the glasses

517
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,960
glasses just go away

518
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,480
the reason why is because they know that

519
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,160
if white light comes

520
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,080
because i'm doing a read when i don't

521
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,520
want to because information is coming

522
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,760
down from spirit of compassion

523
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,960
they know i'll squint one eye i'll start

524
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,520
to squint one eye

525
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,720
is what i'll do and when i do that

526
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,799
they'll know what it is

527
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,320
but you guys may not because when you're

528
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,760
all here spirit of compassion is talking

529
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,640
to me because i'm getting information

530
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,280
about you guys

531
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,840
all while we're doing this so anyway

532
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,039
that's

533
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:57,120
that's what it is right there um

534
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:59,360
so you know so i can take off the

535
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,600
glasses and see perfectly fine like i've

536
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,760
done here on lives and so forth so

537
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,600
but it's there so that you guys can't

538
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,640
tell that i'm squinting

539
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:11,280
after a while from the white light but

540
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,919
either way i mean i don't know what else

541
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,000
to say

542
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,760
but other than that if you're not happy

543
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,559
i wear glasses i don't know what to tell

544
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,679
you guys

545
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:20,640
i really don't know um so we'll go back

546
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,600
to

547
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,799
go back to what the heavy metal detox

548
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,520
smoothie has done

549
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:28,799
it has saved lives that's the key and it

550
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,559
matters

551
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,840
fern says i stopped coffee and have

552
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,480

lots of chocolate i'll talk about that a

570
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,880
little bit

571
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:06,400
so i want to talk about where we get our

572
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,600
battles before we start so you guys if

573
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,640
you just got on here

574
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,120
talking about how this heavy metal detox

575
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,960
movie

576
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,559
has been around for what quite a while

577
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,679
now it's reversed

578
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:19,039
tens of thousands hundreds of thousands

579
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,400
of people's conditions

580
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:24,640
got their lives back and that matters

581
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,799
because nothing else did that out there

582
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,559
butter in your coffee didn't and nothing

583
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:30,960
else does out there so

584
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,799
it's really the difference between when

585
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,960
you're really sick versus

586
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:36,400
you're not so sick and you're trying

587
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,840
cute little things out there and you're

588
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,440
hanging in there and you're trying a

589
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,120
little stuff and your acne almost goes

590
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,960
away it doesn't and things come back and

591
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,760
you're feeling okay you're working out

592
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,679
that's different than sick in bed you're

593
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,880
shaking and tremoring

594
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:52,240
okay you're you've got dizziness vertigo

595
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,760
tinnitus

596
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,360
you got fatigue with the point you can't

597
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,559
take your kids to school

598
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,880
and you're getting an autoimmune

599
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:01,280
diagnosis left and right everywhere

600
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,919
and no one even believes you're sick

601
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,280
anymore

602
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,720
because you've been sick so long and

603
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,520
you're laying in bed they start thinking

604
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,880
you're crazy

605
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,960
i'm taking what people have been through

606
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:12,159
hell and back that's what this

607
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:14,880
has done is got people's lives back not

608
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,400
the regular bs stuff or oh i went on a

609
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,679
keto diet and it got me a little better

610
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,720
and i lost a little weight

611
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:22,799
now try being sick try being sick

612
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,960
and going through something raging

613
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,440
eczema taking over your body well guess

614
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,000
what

615
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,840
you're gonna need this ain't no keto

616
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,880
diet out there gonna get rid of all that

617
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,200
eczema

618
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,360
and get rid of all that psoriasis and

619
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,640
get you off all those steroids

620
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:42,240
and it takes knowledge it takes

621
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:45,600
tools and it takes a history of knowing

622
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:49,200
it has worked already all of it together

623
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:51,039
is good so um

624
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,400
you guys keep in mind there's a lot of

625
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,840
people out there with fake accounts that

626
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,120
are pretending to be anthony williams

627
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,880
pretending to be me

628
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,720

00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,919
they'll try to extort money out of you

632
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,919
they'll try and they'll try to get why

you know they'll do wire fraud um

634
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,919

guys

647
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,679
where do we get metals so before i make

648
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,799
this heavy metal detox smoothie i just

649
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,880
want to give you the rundown those are

650
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:41,200
the frozen wild blueberries

651
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,720
um these are just incredible that's the

652
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,360
blue gold right there

653
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,200
really really beautiful got the cilantro

654
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,440
do you guys keep cilantro in your house

655
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,559
that's important right there okay got

656
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,440
the bananas

657
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,760
got some extra wild blueberry powder got

658
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,679
the

659
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,440
vimergy barley grass juice powder the

660
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,679
only one i trust and use

661
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,559
quality is is there's nothing like it

662
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,559
and i got the one

663
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:04,000
the spirulina not the hawaiian one i

664
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,440
want to say that because people say well

665
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,559
that must be the hawaiian one he talked

666
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,360
about in his first book

667
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,000
and like i said you know you can use

668
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,919
that one

669
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,159
you can use somebody else's spirulina

670
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:14,960
you could use any spirulina you can find

671
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,200
out there

672
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,080
but this is the one i use and this is

673
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,039
the best one

674
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:23,039
out there to date very important and so

675
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,720
when it comes down to removing toxic

676
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:27,200
heavy metals

677
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,440
you want to have the best stuff reason

678
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,640
why i don't like pacific coast

679
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,000
spirulina is because the ocean is

680
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,120
polluted

681
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,400
the highest heavy metals come from

682
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:43,360
the west coast bottom line

683
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,720
so the oceans in the west coast are

684
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,799
polluted

685
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,480
so if you're into surfing you're getting

686
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:51,280
doused with toxic heavy metals

687
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,799
on a high degree keep that in mind so

688
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,720
you're getting doused with mercury

689
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,919
getting dust with lead getting dust with

690
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,200
aluminum can

691
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,799
douse with arsenic so that's on the west

692
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,919
coast in the west coast oceans

693
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:06,640
so i don't like west coast derived

694
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,120
products coming out of the ocean on any

695
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,360
level

696
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,760
it's why i don't like the pacific

697
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,600
anymore like pacific spirulina

698
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,679
i don't like any of that so that's

699
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,640
number one right there you know

700
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,120
at the time years and years ago the

701
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,679
ocean

702
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,640
on the west coast wasn't so bad it

703
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:26,000
wasn't at

704
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:29,039
this epic terrible pollution that

705
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,640
it is today five years ago the west

706
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:33,679
coast the ocean

707
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,720
was less polluted than it is now right

708
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:38,480
now it's

709
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:41,600
historically dirty on a

710
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:44,000
level no one can imagine the west coast

711
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,640
so i'm letting you guys know five years

712
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,159
ago

713
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,559
seven years ago ten years ago it wasn't

714
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,360
as

715
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:52,480
bad and 15 years ago it wasn't that bad

716
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,279
so as far as like

717
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,919
a spirulina it's derived from the west

718
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,440
coast

719
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,200
it was the only thing out there at the

720
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,400
time and it just

721
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:04,240
did the job okay enough and then i had

722
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,159
to wait for better ones to come along

723
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,400
better ones so i would move to another

724
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,400
one that was better than that one

725
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,880
from you know a less polluted source and

726
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,039
then another one and then finally

727
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,200
i got the best one there ever was which

728
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:18,000
is the vimergi spirulina so i'm giving

729
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,320
you some history

730
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,520
if you look back in my first book you'll

731
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,960
see pacific

732
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:28,640
spirulina but like i said the ocean

733
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,360
was half as dirty as it is now now the

734
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,240
west coast

735
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,520
water is so bad people come out of there

736
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,200
with infections

737
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,600
they come out of there after swimming or

738
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,360
surfing with infections

739
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,960
whole another world it's changed in the

740
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,400
last two three years letting you guys

741
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,840
know

742
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,159
uh let's see dr fonnemd good to see you

743
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:49,600
here

744
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:51,600
yep uh hawaii's in the pacific um

745
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,279
so the spirulina is not as clean listen

746
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,919
to what he's explaining

747
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:57,279
so that's that's important to know right

748
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:00,240
there all on its own

749
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,880
and every little bit counts because it's

750
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,360
death

751
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,919
by a thousand cuts out there that's how

752
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,760
it is

753
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:09,360
so the goal for how how it works as far

754
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,960
as the goal for darkness the goal for

755
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,000
the industries the goal for chemical

756
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,279
companies

757
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:18,000
the goal for all of that is stab you

758
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:19,919
a thousand times until finally

759
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,120
everything goes wrong

760
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:25,360
and medical medium information is about

761
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,720
healing up every one of those stabs

762
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,760
wherever we can

763
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:32,799
it's about countering every little hit

764
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:35,039
kick ding slash

765
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:37,440
you know punch it's about countering

heal and so

769
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,960
let's talk about heavy metal exposure

770
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,080
right now let's go in there a little bit

771
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,600

getting late

790
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:21,200
so i'm hungry for this i can't wait um

791
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,400
so let's talk about where we're gonna

792
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,640
get toxic heavy metals

793
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,240
all kinds of sources soda cans if you

794
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,480
guys ever touched a soda can

795
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,360
you don't have to drink soda all you

796
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,960
need is

797
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,559
a family member or a friend to be like

798
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,720
hey can you grab me that soda

799
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:37,360
and you just grab it and you bring it

800
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:41,039
over you just got aluminum in your body

801
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:44,240
the oil in your skin draws

802
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:47,440
metals in that's all just

803
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:51,039
touch metal with your hands

804
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:53,200
and you now own it you own that metal

805
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:54,559
bottom line that's okay we don't have to

806
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,600
be afraid

807
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:58,559
we just need to actually be able to get

808
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,960
it out of us

809
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:02,080
faster than it's coming in get the

810
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,640
metals out

811
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,640
faster than they come in that's the key

812
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:09,760
alexandra sofia is here

813
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,120
please have a banana she said so um we

814
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:14,159
breathe in metals

815
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:16,640
too every day every minute

816
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,159
and every hour they come off of your

817
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,240
couches

818
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,919
they come out of the formaldehyde that's

819
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:25,200
on your furniture

820
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:26,799

and metals

822
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:34,320
come out of our mattresses

823
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:37,279
okay they come out of everything we use

824
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,000
i use metal utensils i also use wood one

that i'm getting that out of me easily

829
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:48,320

can make a big suit but we can get metal

840
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:10,960
out of us

841
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:14,559
more and faster than any coming in

842
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:16,159
see how it works and that matters

843
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:18,240
okay fluoride treatments did you guys

844
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,880
ever have a fluoride treatment

845
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,760
because guess what that aluminum never

846
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,880
left

847
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:26,559
it's in you if you're not doing the

848
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,360
heavy metal detox smoothie

849
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:30,000
you're not getting it out there's toxic

850
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,279
heavy metals

851
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:36,320
in the soil every carrot you eat

852
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:37,279
every organic carrot every organic

853
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,760
broccoli

854
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:41,120
every organic cauliflower every organic

855
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:44,880
green bean

856
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:48,320
every organic fruit every organic herb

857
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:51,360
all your grass-fed meat all has

858
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:54,720
toxic heavy metals in it you hear that

859
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:57,279
organic organic everybody

860
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,960
has toxic heavy metals in it it's got

861
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:03,120
arsenic lead aluminum

862
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:06,640
mercury cadmium nickel copper

863
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:09,840
because it comes from the water supply

864
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,480
that feeds the organic crops that you

865
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,799
buy

866
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,240
at the food stores so when you go into

867
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,679
the food stores

868
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,440
and you're buying your organic

869
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,799
vegetables i got to load up on my

870
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,039
organic vegetables

871
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:22,640
i got to get this i got to get that

872
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:25,760
there's toxic heavy metals

873
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:27,840
all in the compens composition of all

874
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:30,320
those fruits and vegetables

875
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,440
yeah if you do conventional produce

876
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,640
right not organic

877
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:38,559
there's more there's more

878
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:43,039
and so you have to know that every

879
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:46,559
single thing you literally consume

880
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:49,520
i don't care what food you eat

881
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:50,159
has a degree of toxic heavy metals in it

882
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,039
because

883
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,440
it's coming from the water supply pumped

884
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:55,520
in

885
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,799
or coming out of wells to take care of

886
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:00,320
all the farmlands

887
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:02,720
and those have metals in it okay

888
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,520
it's also dropping out of the sky toxic

889
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,880
heavy metals

890
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:08,559
drop out of the sky from chemtrails

891
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,799
they drop out of the sky you guys should

892
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:12,720
listen to the

893
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:14,000
medical medium podcast at apple podcast

894
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,840
the chem show episode

895
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,760
they drop out with the chemtrails they

896
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:21,200
drop out from plain fuel

897
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:23,039
too all that plain fuel that you see

898
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,600
that's just coming out

899
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:26,159
metal that's in that petroleum they blow

900
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,279
around

901
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:31,840
but not just that pesticides ddt

breathe them in wherever you are

918
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:02,480

else's aftershave

924
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,960
you're getting toxic heavy metals and

925
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,320
then you're sitting on somebody's

926
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,840
furniture whether it's in a doctor's

927
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,120
office or an appointment or maybe you're

928
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,799
getting your nails done

nail salons toxic heavy metals all in

931
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:25,039
the hair salons

932
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,320
it's everywhere and we breathe them in

933
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:28,440
and then

934
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,080
there's toxic heavy metals in the

935
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:33,279
pharmaceuticals

936
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:36,640
all in big pharma titanium in

937
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:39,840
almost every single drug antibiotics

938
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:41,600
are petroleum-based loaded with metals

939
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:44,080
if you had an antibiotic you've had

940
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:47,760
toxic heavy metals enter into you

941
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:49,679
so the bottom line is toxic heavy metals

942
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,880
are everywhere we get them there we get

943
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,080
them at the gas station when we're

944
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,320
pumping gas

945
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,799
we get them when we spray some kind of

946
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:59,360
spray or cleaner that's conventional

947
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:00,080
we get them when we spray some oil spray

948
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,240
on the door

949
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,840
to stop it from creaking we breathe it

950
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,760
right in we get it on our fingers we

951
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,320
just got contaminated with toxic heavy

952
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,480
metals

953
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,519
and we get toxic heavy metals from car

954
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:12,080
exhaust

955
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:13,279
you just got to breathe in one fume one

956
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,279
car exhaust fume

957
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:17,200
one truck fume all you gotta drip

958
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:19,440
breathe in is maybe the delivery truck

959
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,440
that came by breathe that in and you got

960
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:25,440
toxic heavy metals

961
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:29,120
all right dr fonz says titanium ox

962
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:31,039
dioxide in pills yes lots of it too

963
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,240
and then you're trying to take care of

964
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:34,159
yourself and do better

965
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,840
and someone tries to sell you an

966
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:38,159
alkaline ionizer water machine

967
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,919
which has metal plates that corrode in

968
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:41,679
every last one of them i don't care what

969
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:43,200
brand you throw up on the screen

970
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:45,840
i don't care what brand you think you

971
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:49,039
have that doesn't every last

972
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,360
alkaline ionizer water machine leeches

973
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:52,080
out

974
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,720
toxic heavy metals because the plates

975
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,440
corrode

976
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,720
whether you see it or you don't and then

977
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,200
you think you're doing something good

978
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,960
for you

979
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:02,799
and you're taking more toxic heavy

980
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:06,240
metals than you ever did before

981
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:07,919
that's just life well that's just a bad

982
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,440
product but also everything else i'm

983
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:13,039
telling you is life

984
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:14,559
so what are we going to do okay

985
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:16,080
toxic heavy metals are everywhere i'm

986
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,640
reading the comments you guys were doing

987
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:20,159
this

988
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:23,039
and so it's about countering that

989
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:24,000
the heavy metal detox smoothie has done

990
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,760
that

991
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,120
and you can't test for toxic heavy

992
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,960
metals you guys you know why

993
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,320
you can't test for toxic heavy metals

994
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,200
because they sit

995
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,000
deep within your organs toxic heavy

996
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,640
metals

997
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,080
sit deep within your brain your liver

998
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:42,399
your pancreas your spleen

999
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:45,760
your bones metals go in your bones

1000
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:48,720
and the only thing i've ever trusted

1001
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,840
to get the metals out of my body that

1002
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:53,120
enter in

1003
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:55,039
okay is the medical medium heavy metal

1004
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:58,159
detox smoothie

1005
00:33:55,039 --> 00:34:01,440
and that's what i've always entrusted in

1006
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:04,640
the five ingredients

1007
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,039
that are critical for getting metals out

1008
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,519
of

1009
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:09,119
my bones your bones you know what

1010
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,639
osteopenia is called caused by

1011
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:14,159
osteopenia

1012
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:18,839
toxic heavy metals osteopenia

1013
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:22,000
toxic heavy metals degenerative spine

1014
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:25,200
scoliosis toxic heavy

1015
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,879
metals degenerative disc disease toxic

1016
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:30,639
heavy metals

1017
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:34,000
how about that bones getting brittle

1018
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:37,919
bones getting weakened as you age

1019
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:40,639
toxic heavy metals so

1020
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:41,839
do we just kind of leave them in us or

1021
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:44,960
do we work on

1022
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:47,280
getting them out what do you want to do

1023
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,000
you know because i'd rather get them i

1024
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,679
would rather get

1025
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,839
them out is what i would rather do and

1026
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:55,520
that's what i've done

1027
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:58,000
so toxic heavy metals are in our way

1028
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:59,280
christian marie you're here and that's

1029
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,640
been a problem

1030
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:05,839
for everybody so taking control

1031
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:09,520
empowering ourselves learning to do what

1032
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:13,680
works matters you know

1033
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:15,760
um aaron iv collation

1034
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:18,079
mercury goes into tissue and lead in

1035
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:20,480
bones

1036
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:23,119
can't test for those can't test for

1037
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:25,119
those unless you do a biopsy of a bone

1038
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:26,560
you can't unless you're doing a biopsy

1039
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:28,839
of your brain

1040
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:32,800
unless someone drills a hole in your

1041
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:34,560
skull and does a brain biopsy

1042
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,640
you're not going to know you're not

1043
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:39,760
going to know because blood testing

1044
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:41,280
only tests new exposure

1045
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,599
so if you're breathing in some air

1046
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,640
fresheners that's only new exposure

1047
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:46,400
you're gonna pick up

1048
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:49,119
you're drinking your water from your

1049
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,800
ionizer it's gonna be new exposure

1050
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:52,480
okay from the toxic ionizer that's

1051
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,520
leaching metals it's gonna be new

1052
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,400
exposure

1053
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:57,839
whatever that is it's all new exposure

1054
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,040
that's what you're to find in the blood

1055
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:01,839
test

1056
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,240
but it's in our organs and it's in there

1057
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:03,920
deep

1058
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,920
and it's going to wreak havoc it gets

1059
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:08,480
you a fatty liver down the road

1060
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:10,800
and here's what really really really is

1061
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:14,560
hard about toxic heavy metals you guys

1062
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:18,160
what's really hard is they oxidize

1063
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:19,760
wreak havoc and leech they rust

1064
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:22,240
do you guys ever see anything rust

1065
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,040
before have you ever seen anything

1066
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,599
corrode

1067
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,720
and rust i'm just wondering you know

1068
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:29,680
because

1069
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:30,880
anything that corrodes and rusts leaves

1070
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:33,040
a stain

1071
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,880
right have you ever seen that

1072
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,560
something's rusting somewhere

1073
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,160
you pick it up maybe you got an old

1074
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,960
screwdriver that's sitting outside in

1075
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,560
the rain

1076
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,160
it's been there for a month and you grab

1077
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,760
it and you see a little rust mark

1078
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:46,000
starting to develop

1079
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,599
whatever it is that rust you see whether

1080
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,720
it's rust on a car

1081
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:53,920
rust on some kind of door rust on metal

1082
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:56,240
whatever it is that rust occurs because

1083
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:59,040
that metal is oxidizing

1084
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:00,560
and when your metals sit inside your

1085
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,960
brain

1086
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:04,320
and they sit inside your liver and they

1087
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,960
sit inside your bones

1088
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,480
they start to rust and they start to

1089
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,160
oxidize

1090
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,440
and then we do the high fat diets and

1091
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,680
we're doing more high fat and we're

1092
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,400
doing more high fat and we're oxidizing

1093
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,760
them more

1094
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:20,240
because fat and oil makes metals

1095
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,000
bleed just hear me on a second you guys

1096
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:25,920
hear me out

1097
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:29,200
fats and oils make

1098
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:31,920
metals bleed and corrode

1099
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:33,440
so the more fat you dump in your body

1100
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,920
and i get it everybody's on high fat

1101
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,200
diets

1102
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,720
they can't help it they're told it's

1103
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,240
perfect to do they're never taught how

1104
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,839
not to do it they're never taught how to

1105
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:42,320
minimize them

1106
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:43,440
and the more fats we bring into our body

1107
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,560
the more and more we

1108
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:48,560
oxidize that metal and that metal rusts

1109
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,800
and rusts and rusts

1110
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,480
and that's what happens and when it

1111
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,880
rusts inside your brain

1112
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,839
it leaches and moves over to glial cells

1113
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,359
it moves over to

1114
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:58,720
more neurons and then all of a sudden

1115
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,520
you're getting some bad anxiety it's

1116
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,839
getting worse

1117
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:03,280
you're getting some bad ocd the ocd is

1118
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:05,839
now level

1119
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,800
three it's level four ocd now you're

1120
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:08,160
getting depression

1121
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,720
like oh my god now you're getting

1122
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:13,119
depersonalization now you're bipolar

1123
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:14,560
okay which is ridiculous because that

1124
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:18,000
diagnosis is so

1125
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:20,000
it's so backwards because really it's

1126
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,680
just no diagnosis it's like hey you're

1127
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,359
either up or down so let's just diagnose

1128
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:25,200
you a bipolar let's create a word that

1129
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:25,520
means up or down how stupid is that

1130
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,720
right

1131
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,480
terrible that's what medical research

1132
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,920
and science does trillions of dollars

1133
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,599
later medical research and science

1134
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,280
doesn't know what causes

1135
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:35,200
that symptom of feeling up and down so

1136
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:38,720
they just name it bipolar

1137
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:40,079
it's actually disturbing so metals are a

1138
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:43,119
neuroantagonist

1139
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:44,800
they disrupt your neurons they explode

1140
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:45,680
neurotransmitters as if they were light

1141
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,000
bulbs

1142
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:49,119
so all your neurotransmitters all those

1143
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,760
neurotransmitters are making you

1144
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:51,280
communicate

1145
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,800
they're making you talk they're making

1146
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,079
you walk they're making you think you

1147
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,359
can have a conversation with somebody

1148
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:56,240
because all those neurotransmitters are

1149
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:58,320
like

1150
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:01,760
right well they explode they explode

1151
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:03,520
like light bulbs like

1152
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,839
that's what neurotransmitters do and

1153
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:08,359
toxic heavy metals in our brain do that

1154
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:10,079
and everybody has them and we're losing

1155
00:39:08,359 --> 00:39:11,359
neurotransmitters all the time

1156
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:13,119
and then when you're 50 years old you're

1157
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:16,079
like what huh

1158
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:17,599
what's my name i don't i can't remember

1159
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:20,240
my date of birth

1160
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:21,200
i can't remember my name that starts

1161
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,040
happening or

1162
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,560
or i don't know i'm just forgetting

1163
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,240
things who did i have to call i had to

1164
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:28,240
make what appointment today oh

1165
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:30,000
i forgot i have to write that down you

1166
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:33,680
just forget everything

1167
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,880
forget everything um courtney says hey

1168
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,560
courtney glad you're here how do i get

1169
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:41,359
my kids to drink the smoothie

1170
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:44,800
popsicles i'm working on a popsicle

1171
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:47,920
meaning like a recipe now because

1172
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:51,040
um people have

1173
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:52,720
people have electricity in their brain

1174
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:55,040
because that's what we do we all have

1175
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,800
electricity in our brain you got it

1176
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:59,200
electricity's running around in your

1177
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,800
brain it's running around on neurons

1178
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,920
electrical impulses are swimming around

1179
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,400
they're riding through all your brain

1180
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,560
tissue

1181
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,000
you've got thoughts emotions whoa i've

1182
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:08,160
been betrayed boom

1183
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,079
your electricity is unbelievable

1184
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,200
somebody just broke my trust electricity

1185
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:13,440
is unbelievable

1186
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,560
all this electricity going on right i'm

1187
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,319
happy i'm happy

1188
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:18,079
i'm happy for a minute i'm happy for 10

1189
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:19,200
seconds that's electricity going on

1190
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:21,200
right

1191
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,560
and that electricity the sad thing is

1192
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,400
caffeine caffeine

1193
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,000
burns out that electricity it robs it

1194
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,200
from you it's like you take caffeine

1195
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,560
chocolate whatever it is you're happy

1196
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,960
for a moment but that's a

1197
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:32,400
that's a drug induced happy so your your

1198
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,960
neurotransmitters are getting eaten up

1199
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,800
by caffeine it's destroying your brain

1200
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,640
and all this happening there's metals in

1201
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,880
our brain and that electricity is

1202
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:43,680
running into that metal

1203
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,720
and it's having spark attacks sparks are

1204
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,319
flying

1205
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:48,160
it's like putting a screwdriver in a

1206
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:49,119
socket which i don't want you to do god

1207
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,960
for a bit

1208
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:52,480
but it's like literally short circuits

1209
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,760
and that's the short circuit so

1210
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,960
you're getting sick you're starting to

1211
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,839
get depression you're starting to get

1212
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,640
some ocd

1213
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:58,240
you're starting to get some

1214
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,040
depersonalization starting to get

1215
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,400
anxiety

1216
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,400
you're starting to get all of that and

1217
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:05,599
what's happening is

1218
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:08,240
with all that um

1219
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:09,839
with all that's happening all these

1220
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:12,880
conditions are starting

1221
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:16,319
and that spark is dying out

1222
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:19,520
because those metals they actually

1223
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:21,920
collide with that electricity so

1224
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:24,400
electrical impulses hit the metal inside

1225
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,240
your brain and boom you got ocd cooking

1226
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,599
and that ocd can get carried on and

1227
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,920
become something else and become

1228
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:34,319
something else

1229
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:36,160
so okay you guys

1230
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:39,040
your brain lights up like a christmas

1231
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,640
tree when i look at it

1232
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,800
you know when i was younger spirit of

1233
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,079
compassion taught me to look inside

1234
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,400
people's brains

1235
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:48,000
he would give me the vision he would

1236
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,160
show me with the light

1237
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,560
and then he would show me that if

1238
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:55,119
someone was high in toxic heavy metals

1239
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:56,240
in their brain it would light up like a

1240
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:58,960
christmas tree

1241
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,839
in the vision the vision field he would

1242
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:03,440
give me

1243
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:05,760
and i remember as a kid

1244
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,599
walking around in crowds of people and i

1245
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,599
would see so many christmas trees

1246
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:10,720
so many people's brains lit up left and

1247
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:12,960
right just

1248
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:14,079
lit up and i'm like whoa that person's

1249
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,839
got a lot of mercury

1250
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:18,079
that person's got a lot of aluminum that

1251
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:20,480
person's got a lot of everything

1252
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:22,240
you know question is where do brain

1253
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,160
lesions come from

1254
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,760
combination of toxic heavy metals and

1255
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,839
viruses such as epstein-barr

1256
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,160
neurotoxins too can do it so

1257
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:32,720
epstein-barr neurotoxins are really

1258
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,920
really responsible for a lot of brain

1259
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,760
lesions that's one thing

1260
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,599
toxic heavy metals are responsible for a

1261
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:39,040
lot of them too

1262
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:40,720
i've helped a lot of doctors with that

1263
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,240
very thing with brain lesions taught a

1264
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,520
lot of doctors about how toxic head

1265
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,119
metals work with brain

1266
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,560
lesions brain lesions or toxic heavy

1267
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,920
metals that start to corrode

1268
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:50,400
and they crystallize the corrosion

1269
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:52,800
crystallizes did you ever see

1270
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:55,119
like a battery that gets too old you

1271
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:57,680
guys a battery gets too old

1272
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:59,200
and it starts to corrode well that's

1273
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,920
what happens in the brain with these

1274
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,960
metals

1275
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:03,440
when these metals are hitting

1276
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:06,079
electricity

1277
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,480
mark says my memory was was in a bad way

1278
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:08,480
after

1279
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,960
two years of the heavy metal detox

1280
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:13,119
smoothie i have my memory back

1281
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,800
thank you so much anthony it matters to

i'm just showing you guys right here

1338
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:20,720
these little guys are miracles is what

1339
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:24,560
they are

1340
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:27,839
so now i'm going to talk about the power

1341
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:30,640
of the wild blueberry did you know

1342
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:31,520
that you can't kill the wild blueberry

1343
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,440
plant

1344
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:36,720
do you know that do you know it's

1345
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:38,560
impossible to kill them

1346
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:40,160
do you know it's the only food on the

1347
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:42,480
planet you can't

1348
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:46,000
kill isn't it interesting put a little

1349
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:50,000
bit more in here you guys

1350
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:54,240
it's the only food on the planet

1351
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:57,359
you can't destroy and stomp out

1352
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:59,680
you can kill all our food

1353
00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:02,000
you can kill every cow on the planet and

1354
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:04,800
they'll be gone forever

1355
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,599
you can kill every strawberry patch on

1356
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:09,440
the planet

1357
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:12,560
and they'll be gone forever you can kill

1358
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:15,280
every single chicken

1359
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:16,240
on the planet and they'll be gone

1360
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,680
forever

1361
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:20,240
there was this one chicken though you

1362
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:22,240
guys remember the story a long time ago

1363
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:23,280
had his head chopped off and was still

1364
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:26,000
alive

1365
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:27,200
and then he would eat through his neck

1366
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,359
so

1367
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:31,040
i've asked spirit of compassion how that

1368
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:32,720
happened and how it was even possible

1369
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:35,440
because it was an absolute mystery

1370
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:36,800
mystery to science and i got the answer

1371
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,440
but i'm just not going to tell you right

1372
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:40,880
now

1373
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:44,960
i'll tell you maybe on a podcast um

1374
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:47,520
so anyway the bottom line is

1375
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,160
you can't kill the wild blueberry plant

1376
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:51,200
you can

1377
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:53,680
burn it to the ground in the fields

1378
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,319
and they'll come back up but you burn an

1379
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:58,079
oak tree

1380
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:59,680
and it's not coming back up an oak tree

1381
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:01,920
you can kill every oak tree on this

1382
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:04,000
planet and it'll be gone for good

1383
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:05,280
you can't kill the wild blueberry and

1384
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,640
guess what it's

1385
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:12,640
that power it has

1386
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:15,440
that makes this that makes this heavy

1387
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:19,040
metal detox movie what it is

1388
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:20,880
it's it's the basis it's the core

1389
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:22,319
but you got to have everything else but

1390
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:26,160
it's the core

1391
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:27,599
and that matters so noelle shepard says

1392
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:30,880
tell hey noelle

1393
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:31,839
phillip k says i thought i just said i

1394
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,680
missed the comment but

1395
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:34,880
glad you're here phillip k appreciate it

1396
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:38,160
um

1397
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:39,680
so yeah the bottom line is it's michelle

1398
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:41,839
l i just saw that alien chicken it's

1399
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:45,599
funny

1400
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:48,640
this is the core fundamental basis

1401
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:49,520
the epicenter the powers in that wild

1402
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,760
blueberry

1403
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:53,520
but you gotta have the rest and let's go

1404
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:54,880
into it let's talk about it first of all

1405
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:56,640
i just put the wild blueberries in here

1406
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:59,680
you guys all right

1407
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:00,880
just saying you see it right and the

1408
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:04,800
wild blueberry

1409
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:08,240
has reaching powers into your brain

1410
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:11,520
into your brain stem it's got reaching

1411
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:12,240
powers it can overreach and that's what

1412
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,440
you want

1413
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:15,440
in the wild blueberry can do that

1414
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,800
anthocyanins undiscovered by research

1415
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:18,079
and science sit in wild blueberries

1416
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,680
because guess what science won't take

1417
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:20,000
their time out to study it because like

1418
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:22,000
i told

1419
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,440
you before to actually fix things on

1420
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,599
this planet chronic illness

1421
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:26,640
you would need true science that's

1422
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:29,839
actually

1423
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:32,880
working for the people and not for

1424
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:35,280
somebody's pocket and so what's

1425
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:37,200
in this right here is undiscovered by

1426
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,960
research and science anthocyanins that

1427
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,800
are undiscovered

1428
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:42,640
that's one of the key tickets another

1429
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:45,440
key ticket is it's

1430
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:46,319
it literally stops the metals from

1431
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:48,559
rusting

1432
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:49,359
in the brain so those frozen wild

1433
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:51,119
blueberries

1434
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:52,480
stop metals from rusting so that's the

1435
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:53,680
thing right there i'm giving you some

1436
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,920
powerful tidbits

1437
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:57,440
on each one of these if i can let's keep

1438
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,599
on going

1439
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:01,359
let's put um let's just put some some

1440
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:02,319
oranges in here let's get some oranges

1441
00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:03,599
in here

1442
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:05,680
let's do that you guys i'm going to cut

1443
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:07,839
some orange these are small oranges so

1444
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:11,119
i'm going to pop in two

1445
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:11,119
but they're small oranges

1446
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:20,319
i like small oranges

1447
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:21,599
i got a little straightener right here

1448
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:24,640
and you'll see here

1449
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:26,240
it's a metal strainer what do we have

1450
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:29,359
here

1451
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:30,880
okay it's a metal strainer but i don't

1452
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:33,440
care

1453
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:35,760
because whatever little leeches out of

1454
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:38,000
the strainer over the years

1455
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:40,240
this smoothie is going to remove it

1456
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:43,200
times a thousand

1457
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:44,000
and that's why so you know there's

1458
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:47,280
something about

1459
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:49,680
insurance right you know you're happy

1460
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:51,760
when you got car insurance because

1461
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:54,559
if you didn't have car insurance right

1462
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:58,000
that would be a problem okay

1463
00:49:54,559 --> 00:50:01,440
um but the heavy metal

1464
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:03,760
detox smoothie is insurance

1465
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:05,280
it's an important insurance policy in

1466
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:08,160
your life

1467
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:10,559
and it's one that gives something back

1468
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:12,640
to you no matter what

1469
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:14,240
and that's what i love about it that's

1470
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:15,599
how i see it too it's an important

1471
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:18,079
insurance policy

1472
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:18,079
it's like

1473
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:23,280
so i'm popping in some orange here

1474
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:24,480
alexandra said aw

1475
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,920
is it okay to put the juice of three

1476
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:27,839

dolls

1493
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:06,960
put a tablespoon a few strips in it you

1494
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:07,599
could put a teaspoon if you really want

1495
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:12,640
to

1496
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:12,640
it's fine but i'm putting that in here

1497
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:16,400
a little bit

1498
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:20,400
and then let's go into the rest of this

1499
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:22,160
stuff

1500
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:24,559
i got some cilantro to put in but i'm

1501
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:27,440
gonna the barley grass juice powder so

1502
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:29,440
that's the vimergy one right there

1503
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:31,680
now here's an important critical thing

1504
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:34,319
to know all right

1505
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:35,440
you don't want to use barley grass that

1506
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:38,720
you don't want to do

1507
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:39,520
don't use barley grass that's important

1508
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,440
okay

1509
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:43,359
um it has to be barley grass juice

1510
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:46,559
powder the vimergy one

1511
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:47,599
is the best there is hands down it's the

1512
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:51,119
purest

1513
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:54,640
it is the best and

1514
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:58,400
what i love about it is it has

1515
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:58,800
a heavy metal detoxifying structure to

1516
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:02,400
it

1517
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:05,359
it's built it's created

1518
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:06,079
the way it's created it can absorb

1519
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:07,760
metals

1520
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:10,160
hold on to them pull them out of the

1521
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:13,200
body so it has a magnetic

1522
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:15,359
effect to grab onto metal

1523
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,640
in the body and that's what i love about

1524
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:20,079
it

1525
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:21,040
because it's not just about removing

1526
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:23,920
metals

1527
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:25,040
it grabs on to them as it runs into them

1528
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:27,119
floating around

1529
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:28,559
and the reason why you got to have the

1530
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:30,000
barley grass juice powder you got to

1531
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:31,280
have the spirulina you got to have the

1532
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,640
wild blueberries you gotta have the

1533
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:35,599
dulce and the cilantro

1534
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:37,680
they work off each other they're a team

1535
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:39,200
that's how you get something done

1536
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:40,800
you need a team of people to get

1537
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:42,720
something done sometimes right you guys

1538
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:46,800
will you need a team

1539
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:50,319
of heavy metal grabbers detoxifiers

1540
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:51,520
pullers um you know and dislodgers

1541
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:52,960
that's what you need so we'll go on

1542
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,480
we'll keep on moving on i just put the

1543
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:56,400
dolls in here now what i love about the

1544
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:58,800
dolls is

1545
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:01,680
it's incredible for grabbing toxic heavy

1546
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:03,119
metals out of your intestinal tract

1547
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:06,079
we have toxic heavy metals in our

1548
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:09,119
stomachs everybody's stomach

1549
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:11,680
has got metals in the linings stuck

1550
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:12,400
in the linings what i love about the

1551
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:15,599
dolls

1552
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:19,200
okay the atlantic dolls is

1553
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:23,680
it removes metals out of the lining

1554
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:26,800
of the stomach it removes easy to find

1555
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:28,720
metals not deep seated metals

1556
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:30,559
the barley grass juice powder the

1557
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:33,760
spirulina the blueberries

1558
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:37,599
get the deep seeded metals

1559
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:39,359
the dulce it gets perimeter metals

1560
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:41,280
that are important to get your small

1561
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:43,440
intestinal tract your colon

1562
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:44,960
metals that are feeding bacteria metals

1563
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:47,599
that are feeding viruses

1564
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:48,640
it's getting it out so that's important

1565
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:51,599
there so i just did

1566
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:54,400
a little bit of dolson there let's put

1567
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:54,400
some spirulina

1568
00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:58,720
so

1569
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:01,520
that one's a favorite of mine right

1570
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:05,119
there this is the best stuff

1571
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:08,640
on the market today hands down

1572
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:12,160
could bet my life on it i know

1573
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:15,280
what it's comprised of i've seen

1574
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:16,720
every single one out there i've picked

1575
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:19,040
through them

1576
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:20,319
tooth and nail all the stuff i've talked

1577
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:23,680
to all the companies

1578
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:25,599
all through the years by far best one

1579
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:28,000
and it matters because if you put a

1580
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:31,440
crappier one in which you can

1581
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:34,000
you get maybe some metal out but

1582
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:35,920
not as much as you could have or if it's

1583
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:39,839
a really bad spirulina you get

1584
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:44,400
no metal out and these foods

1585
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:46,799
have the power of absorbing metals

1586
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:48,240
lots of metal wherever it can find it

1587
00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:49,520
and that's what i love about it so the

1588
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:51,119
spirulina

1589
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:52,720
so here's the thing here's something

1590
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:53,680
that's very important i'm still making

1591
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:55,359
this smoothie

1592
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:58,400
when you remove toxic heavy metals you

1593
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:58,400
got an empty space

1594
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:05,359
you got an empty space think about that

1595
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:08,160
toxic heavy metals make a divot and a

1596
00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:10,400
pit inside your brain

1597
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:11,200
and the more they oxidize the bigger the

1598
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:14,400
divot

1599
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:15,599
when you have alzheimer's that pit is

1600
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,359
getting big

1601
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:19,280
when you gotta focus on concentration

1602
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:22,079
issues when you got

1603
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:23,280
ocd really bad the pits and the nooks

1604
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:26,319
and crannies get

1605
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:27,520
big so what happens is in your brain

1606
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:30,799
tissue

1607
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:34,880
metals start to actually

1608
00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:37,520
burn a hole in your brain

1609
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:38,640
electrical impulses are slamming into

1610
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:41,119
those metals

1611
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:42,000
and those metals are getting hot and

1612
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:45,440
they're burning

1613
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:48,160
into your brain tissue

1614
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:49,599
as that happens over time you got now a

1615
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:53,359
pocket

1616
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:57,040
you got tiny microscopic pockets

1617
00:55:53,359 --> 00:55:57,040
inside your brain tissue

1618
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:04,079
and that's there when you remove metals

1619
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:05,440
you still got those pockets you still

1620
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:09,119
got those microscopic

1621
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:12,160
issues and that's why this is a miracle

1622
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:13,920
from what i've seen in the last 35 plus

1623
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:17,200
years even longer

1624
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:20,960
the reason why it's a miracle is because

1625
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:25,599
it doesn't just take the metals out

1626
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:28,319
it fixes and repairs the hole

1627
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:29,200
and that's the key right there it's not

1628
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:31,680
just taking

1629
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:32,240
something out it's putting something

1630
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:35,359
back

1631
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:38,480
in and that's what it's doing

1632
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:41,280
i'm gonna put some cilantro here um

1633
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:42,960
i love cilantro as a leafy green there's

1634
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:45,200
a question right there from donna is

1635
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:47,200
carella okay no it's not

1636
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:48,799
no i've seen a lot of people bent over

1637
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:50,880
the sides of their bed

1638
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:53,200
barfing for days and days because of

1639
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:55,359
corella i've seen lots of people

1640
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:57,200
holding onto the toilet so tight where

1641
00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:58,160
they lived in the bath on the bathroom

1642
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:01,280
floor for days

1643
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:04,559
puking their guts out because of corella

1644
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:06,400
cruella has microorganisms

1645
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:08,000
and microorganisms in it that are not

1646
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:11,599
supposed to be there

1647
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:14,079
okay and bacteria bad bacteria

1648
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:16,319
i wouldn't trust corella someone handed

1649
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:18,880
to me i'd smack it out of their hand

1650
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:19,520
because i wouldn't even want it near me

1651
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:21,440
and

1652
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:23,359
corella doesn't remove metals i don't

1653
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:25,119
know where that farce came from and if

1654
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:27,440
it ever did remove a little bit of metal

1655
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:30,480
it would drop it immediately

1656
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:31,680
so to this day i still can't believe

1657
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:33,280
it's just out there

1658
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:35,200
i can't tell you how many people have

1659
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:38,480
barfed their guts out because of

1660
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:40,000
basically food poisoning and um so no

1661
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:43,839
i'm just not a fan

1662
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:45,440
not a fan there's somebody up there uh

1663
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:50,400
roberta says no wait let's see

1664
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:50,400
sorry um they're going up so quick

1665
00:57:53,119 --> 00:58:00,160
anna anna says cruella made me so sick

1666
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:02,559
god bless you i hope you got through it

1667
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:03,760
i've known people i've known people that

1668
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:06,079
have literally been

1669
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:07,680
holding onto their toilet on the

1670
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:11,040
bathroom floor

1671
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:12,319
and and and like for days until they

1672
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:15,520
ended up in the hospital

1673
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:18,160
many didn't many did just awful

1674
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:18,960
but you know what i could say it all day

1675
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:20,319
long and it's

1676
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,839
still out there and people are still

1677
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:23,359
gonna take it and some influence are

1678
00:58:21,839 --> 00:58:24,079
still gonna be like i'm putting cruella

1679
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:27,119
in my

1680
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:29,040
acai bowl and i'm putting corelli in my

1681
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:31,440
peanut butter smoothie and it's like

1682
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:31,440
what

1683
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:34,960
it's just like you can't you can't fix

1684
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:36,480
everything

1685
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:38,240
you can't fix everything out there i

1686
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,799
mean i've been doing this third 35 years

1687
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:41,440
and

1688
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:43,359
i just can't fix everything um and all

1689
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:47,839
the mess-ups so

1690
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:51,440
if someone's high in metals

1691
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:53,040
they'll have an aversion to cilantro

1692
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:54,880
so you're not going to want cilantro i

1693
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:56,160
put cilantro in here you guys because

1694
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:59,359
you're high in metals you're not even

1695
00:58:56,160 --> 00:59:01,599
going to want cilantro keep that in mind

1696
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:02,799
if it gives you a bad bad taste that

1697
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:04,319
means you're really high in heavy metals

1698
00:59:02,799 --> 00:59:05,760
if you needed to keep the cilantro out

1699
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:09,680
keep it out

1700
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:10,480
okay keep it out three out of five ain't

1701
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:12,960
bad

1702
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:14,240
four out of five ain't bad if you gotta

1703
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:16,559
do it that way

1704
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:18,559
so if you gotta do the spirulina wild

1705
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:20,720
blueberry powder

1706
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:22,319
uh look got it if you can't get wild

1707
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:24,079
blueberries do the wild blueberry powder

1708
00:59:22,319 --> 00:59:26,319
i forgot to put that in you gotta do the

1709
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:28,640
spirulina the wild blueberry powder

1710
00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:30,400
the barley grass juice powder wild

1711
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:31,040
blueberries bananas if you can get stuff

1712
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:34,640
like that

1713
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:36,000
but if you if you have to keep out

1714
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:37,920
if you have to keep something out like

1715
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,319
the cilantro then keep that out and do

1716
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:42,400
four out of five

1717
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:43,599
and you're still gonna get the metals

1718
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,520
out but

1719
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:47,839
there's gonna be an imbalance but you

1720
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:49,760
live with it until you can handle your

1721
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:51,119
cilantro someday

1722
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:53,920

what's my opinion on cmos i think it's

1733
01:00:40,839 --> 01:00:43,839
fine

1734
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:57,839
the cmos isn't going to replace dolls

1735
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:16,720
there we go i think i've made this a lot

1736
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:16,720
of times i'll tell you

1737
01:01:20,319 --> 01:01:25,839
let's get one going here

1738
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:39,839
and then you could get a spoon and kind

1739
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:39,839
of get the rest out

1740
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:54,640
if you can see that

1741
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:56,079
heavy metal detox smoothie right there

1742
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:56,400
there's a question right there i have

1743
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:58,960
got

1744
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:01,039
extreme so anna says i've got extreme

1745
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:03,359
eczema on my hands and arms

1746
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:04,839
don't understand why i am doing

1747
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:08,079
everything right

1748
01:02:04,839 --> 01:02:11,440
detox how many fats are in the diet

1749
01:02:08,079 --> 01:02:13,359
because the fats can get in the way

1750
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:15,520
did you do a new pharmaceutical lately

1751
01:02:13,359 --> 01:02:16,880
at all is there a new pharmaceutical in

1752
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:18,640
your life

1753
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:19,920
something new that you might have got or

1754
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:23,440
received

1755
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:23,440
because there's a lot of metals in there

1756
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:27,599
eczema is caused by copper and the

1757
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:29,680
epstein-barr virus inside the liver so

1758
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:32,000
i've talked about that in the books

1759
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:32,000
and

1760
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:36,480
are you doing the antiviral protocol you

1761
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:38,160
can take the book to your doctor or

1762
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:39,839
health care provider somebody that might

1763
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:40,720
might help you with the protocol if you

1764
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:43,440
want

1765
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:43,839
and there's a protocol on here antiviral

1766
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:47,280
for

1767
01:02:43,839 --> 01:02:48,240
eczema answer is this have you embarked

1768
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:50,880
on it yet

1769
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:52,000
how far are you going because you can go

1770
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:54,160
really far

1771
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,599
really far to the finish line with the

1772
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:59,280
medical medium tools

1773
01:02:55,599 --> 01:03:02,480
and are you using the right ingredients

1774
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:03,839
another thing too to consider are you

1775
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:05,440
doing any nutritional yeast

1776
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:07,119
get rid of it are you doing apple cider

1777
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:08,400
vinegar get rid of it

1778
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:10,720
you might not be doing any of those i

1779
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:12,160
totally get it um what are you doing

1780
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:13,599
caffeine are you doing chocolate all you

1781
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:15,520
need is chocolate once a month the

1782
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:18,079
eczema is going to stick around

1783
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:19,359
and is the diet too high in fat because

1784
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:23,280
it doesn't allow the

1785
01:03:19,359 --> 01:03:24,880
copper to leave so the higher fat your

1786
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:27,920
diet is

1787
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:30,000
the harder it is to get that metal out

1788
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:32,079
to get the virus out so keep

1789
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,559
them there's a lot of place to go don't

1790
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:38,000
do any eggs don't do milk cheese butter

1791
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:41,599
