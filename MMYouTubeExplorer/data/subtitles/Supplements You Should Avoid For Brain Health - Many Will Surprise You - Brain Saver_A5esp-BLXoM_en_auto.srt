talking about supplementation inside the

16
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,600
brain saver protocols book right here

17
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,600
now there's two books brainsaver brain

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,660
saver protocols 40 off which is utterly

19
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:48,420
insane these are massive books heavy

20
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:51,539
tons of information can't say enough

21
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,399
about them but 40 off amazon.com right

22
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,320
now take advantage of the sale for gifts

23
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,820

else I'm telling my friends that's what

25
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,420
you should do it's a really good chance

26
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,219
right now for that now I'm just reading

27
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,080
a little bit in here so this is really

28
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:05,280
an exciting moment for me because I'm in

29
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,799
a section

30
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,040
talking about supplementation that's bad

31
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:13,080
for the brain right so brain betrayer

32
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,420
supplements is what I call them they're

33
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,479
in the brain saver protocols cleanses

34
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,560
and healed uh and and recipes right so

35
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,840
here we go

36
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,220
these supplements fall into four main

37
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,759
categories so I'm going to take these

38
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,759
off right now

39
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,979
so these supplements fall into four main

40
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:36,720
categories let me read the categories to

41
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:39,299
you I'm so excited I'm going too fast

42
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,979
right here it's problematic and damaging

43
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,439
supplements that's the category we're

44
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:46,020
working in right now

45
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:48,540
problematic and damaging supplements so

46
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:51,840
that's the category then there's mildly

47
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:53,579
mildly problematic supplements it's

48
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,700
another category

49
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:58,920
and then overrated or overused

50
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,079
supplements another category and then

51
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,060
quality concerns supplements where it's

52
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,799
especially important to seek out high

53
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,020
quality forms because they're frequently

54
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,700
produced with low quality ingredients or

55
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,259
problematic additives such as

56
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,900
preservatives

57
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:14,520
so earlier today we were talking about a

58
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,200
few of them so I'm just going to list

59
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,640
out a few there's alkaline ionized or

60
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,140
water machines there's apple cider

61
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,780
vinegar products they're spent tonight

62
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:24,360
clay there's caffeine based supplements

63
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,520
there's charcoal there's chlorella

64
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,200
there's chlorine dioxide there's cod

65
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,160
liver oil shark liver oil there's

66
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:33,800
colostrum deer antler diatomaceous earth

67
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:36,660
does any of this ring a bell at all

68
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,980
digestive bitters essential oils taken

69
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:41,640
internally

70
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:44,220
fat burners fish oil and krill oil gut

71
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,819

alcohol hydrochloric acid HCL

73
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:53,640
supplements L-Carnitine L-Arginine

74
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:57,120
mineral oil mushroom coffee with

75
00:02:53,640 --> 00:03:00,840
caffeine oyster supplements Pearl powder

76
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:03,060
sodium bicarbonate turpentine oil whey

77
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,620
protein powder zeolites does any of that

78
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:08,040
ring a bell at all you guys because

79
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:10,260
those are all problematic and damaging

80
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,000
supplements to the brain I'm going to

81
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:14,459
read a little on some of those right

82
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,980
there so I don't know if you guys have

83
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:18,360
taken those throughout your time or a

84
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,099
lot of people try everything they've

85
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,319
been there they've done that they've

86
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:24,420
tried so many different things so let's

87
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,800
hit it a little bit in some areas a

88
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,000
couple of areas where I didn't talk

89
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,580
about yet

90
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,260
let's hit zeolite I think that's a good

91
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,819
area right there so let's take it from

92
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:36,300
there okay

93
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:39,959
in recent years in edible varieties of

94
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:42,299
zeolites have been Unearthed and

95
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:44,400
manufactured in the same places as

96
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:45,599
edible zeolites so just digest that for

97
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,360
a second

98
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,200
just kind of grab on to that for a

99
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,780
moment

100
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:55,500
in recent years in edible varieties of

101
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:57,540
zeolites have been Unearthed and

102
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,700
manufactured in the same places as

103
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:02,519
edible zeolites just kind of grasp back

104
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:04,620
for a second very important causing

105
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:06,659
cross-contamination

106
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,000
so when you're doing zealots you can be

107
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:11,040
really understanding about how it works

108
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,319
and what's going on okay so I'm in the

109
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,299
brain saver books if you guys don't have

110
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:17,340
these you're missing out I don't even

111
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:20,639
know what to say greatest books of all

112
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:23,419
time hands down in health

113
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:27,120
you will see okay so let's keep on going

114
00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:29,160
neither edible nor inedible zeolites

115
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,139
cross the blood-brain barrier so let's

116
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,419
just digest that for a second

117
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:35,880
if you hear zeolites cross a blood brain

118
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:37,620
Berry you're being scammed

119
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,240
there's no science or research that can

120
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,639
ever show that is the lights across the

121
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,800
blood-brain barrier it doesn't exist

122
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:45,540
so if you hear that so you hear all the

123
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,100
zeolite reps it's like oh crosses the

124
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,060
blood brain period oh really because it

125
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,940
doesn't

126
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:53,220
really important to know neither edible

127
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:55,740
nor inedible zeolites cross the

128
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:57,440
blood-brain barrier nor do they enter

129
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:02,060
the brain

130
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:05,520
zeolite cannot enter the brain another

131
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:07,979
complete misunderstanding in the scam

132
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,259
world of zeolites really important so

133
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:11,759
these are these are life-changing books

134
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:13,199
because you really become empowered

135
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,060
because you understand what's really

136
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,780
happening so you can protect yourself

137
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:19,979
and your brain

138
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:21,900
cross-contaminated zeolite varieties

139
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:23,539
stay in the intestinal tract and

140
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:26,460
irritate the lining

141
00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:28,380
cross-contaminated zeolites which is all

142
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:30,479
of them

143
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:32,580
stay in the intestinal tract and

144
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,979
irritate the lining

145
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:36,360
causing dehydration and vagus nerve

146
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:38,759
sensitivities now we have to protect our

147
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,979
vagus nerves it's critical that we

148
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:43,080
understand our vagus nerves and protect

149
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:45,419
our vagus nerves coming out of a brain

150
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:48,000
stem our vagus nerves have a lot to do

151
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:50,100
with so many aspects of our internal

152
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,780
health here I've talked about that a lot

153
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,840
of times but the books are packed with

154
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:56,220
Vegas Urban for information loaded with

155
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,020
vagus nerves

156
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:00,060
and their information about them so

157
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:02,100
let's go a little bit further

158
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,660
so what happens is zeolites irritate the

159
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,280
intestinal lining

160
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:07,820
causing

161
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,820
nerve problem

162
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:11,880
your zeolite and you're literally

163
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:13,800
creating vagus nerve issues that means

164
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,900
anxiety that means all kinds of other

165
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,300
issues

166
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:20,340
ticks and spasms anxiety weird digestion

167
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,440
stuff stomach stuff gastroparesis

168
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,819
whatever a whole bunch of things that

169
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,460
medical medium information talks about

170
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:29,660
vagus nerve can be involved with okay

171
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:32,940
let's go a little bit further

172
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:36,120
edible zeolites which is do you like

173
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:38,759
products right edible zeolites even if

174
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:41,160
you have every assurance that they're

175
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:43,199
not cross-contaminated should not be

176
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,960
taken in high dosages or long term

177
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,180
because even edible zeolites they're

178
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:50,639
varieties of zeolites build up inside

179
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:52,620
the gut creating imbalances and

180
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,020
dehydration

181
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:57,240
which takes critical electrolytes and

182
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:59,280
water from the brain

183
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,620
it's even a really good feel like you're

184
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,319
taking a decent amount of it you're

185
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:07,039
stealing hydration from neurons and

186
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,039
brain tissue

187
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:13,259
large dosages of zeolite can create

188
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:15,479
Trace mineral imbalance because zeolites

189
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:18,479
don't have a discernment between get

190
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:21,120
ready for this oh my God

191
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,900
that's every line in this book is like

192
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,720
this

193
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:27,599
every line in these both these books is

194
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,000
exactly where it's mind-blown mind blown

195
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,259
it's one line after another check this

196
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,720
out

197
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:35,759
large dosages of zeolites can create a

198
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:40,500
trace mineral imbalance

199
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:43,919
get ready because zeolites don't have a

200
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,819
discernment between what's a toxic heavy

201
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,340
metal

202
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:49,080
get ready and what's a precious Trace

203
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,660
mineral the very thing we need in our

204
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,440
brain the very thing we need

205
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:54,060
neurotransmitter chemicals need

206
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,560
everything needs in the brain I talk

207
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:58,860
about it in the brain saver books

208
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:01,199
zeolite does not have a discernment

209
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:03,240
between trace minerals that are precious

210
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,380
for our brain in toxic heavy metals you

211
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,680
know what that means

212
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:09,539
when you take zeolites they they can

213
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,220
actually cage up

214
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:13,220
trace minerals and they do

215
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:19,580
zeolites do not travel into the

216
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:22,740
bloodstream so let's make this clear too

217
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:24,539
zeolites don't travel into the

218
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:26,280
bloodstream they stay in the intestinal

219
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:30,240
tract so it's another thing people just

220
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:32,099
get tricked by the holes of light talk

221
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,719
zeolites do not travel into the

222
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:36,120
bloodstream

223
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:38,159
and they do not bind onto toxic heavy

224
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:41,820
metals in the bloodstream critical to no

225
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:44,820
zeolites are not a reliable binder so I

226
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:46,380
love I love what I hear out there at

227
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:49,080
Albanian doesn't know anything about

228
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:53,040
binders what

229
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:54,720
I don't yeah you need to like oh you do

230
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,279
okay

231
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,100
keep on telling a whole bunch of people

232
00:08:56,279 --> 00:09:01,140
that get them sicker chronically ill

233
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,940
just you know it's like you guys are one

234
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,320
big experiment out there

235
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:07,019
I've said that before the chronically

236
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,060
ill are just one big experiment for a

237
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:12,240
whole bunch of

238
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:13,860
not so smart people that tries to just

239
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,240
like do this do this it's like and then

240
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,279
the chronically ill who are really smart

241
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,959
they're just like they're just this one

242
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:21,360
big experiment

243
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:23,700
zeolites are not a reliable binder

244
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,680
zeolites only stay in the intestinal

245
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,240
tract just like clay it's just like clay

246
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,500
it stays in the intestinal tract it

247
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,180
doesn't go to your brain doesn't cross

248
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,519
the blood brain barrier and it doesn't

249
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:34,980
go into your bloodstream

250
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:37,800
as Elites sit inside the intestinal

251
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:39,660
tract they can interrupt trace minerals

252
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,860
from leaving the intestinal tract and

253
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:43,080
entering the liver so your trace

254
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:45,899
minerals that enter your body have to go

255
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:48,839
into your liver and brain with the

256
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:52,080
zeolite can stop that

257
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:53,760
so I think where people get confused

258
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,920
because at one point you recommended

259
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,000
them I understand why you do not now but

260
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,339
people

261
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,899
that haven't updated themselves on your

262
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:02,640
new information

263
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:03,899
well here's the thing and it's not even

264
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,300
just that

265
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:09,779
what it is is

266
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:11,459
there's a whole bunch of sharks the

267
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:13,680
sharks are on the outside of the medical

268
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:15,480
meeting communities medical meeting

269
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,420
communities

270
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,440
largest Health communities in the world

271
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:22,080
millions of people around the world

272
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:25,019
people that are not even on social media

273
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:27,180
or whatever and what happens is is it

274
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:29,640
became Feeding Frenzy have you noticed

275
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:30,959
the ads that you show up in all your in

276
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:34,320
all your feeds

277
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:37,260
those are hundreds of companies trying

278
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,580
to fish for medical medium people and

279
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:41,339
fish them out of the medical meaning

280
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:44,220
Community just so you understand it's a

281
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:46,440
dog eat dog world out there and it's all

282
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:48,660
about the money money money

283
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,560
and that you change so what happens is

284
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,720
that

285
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:54,660
they just the sharks

286
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:59,220
throw in everybody's feeds everybody all

287
00:10:54,660 --> 00:11:00,720
your feeds all the stuff right and

288
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:03,660
they're fishing

289
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:06,180
and even if they never even saw that one

290
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:08,579
time there was this one zeolite and you

291
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:11,519
know small quantities one zeolite at one

292
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:13,680
time 10 15 years ago

293
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,959
that can act at least

294
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:19,500
as an absorbent through the intestinal

295
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:21,839
tract even if they didn't even see that

296
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,339
they're still hammering the zeolites

297
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,660
because the zeolite industry is still

298
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:25,920
going to take advantage of all the

299
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,660
health communities so they go into the

300
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,760
medical medium Health Community and they

301
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:32,279
fish and they fish and they fish

302
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,860
but all but you'll see that adds in your

303
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:37,500
feeds from everything from fishing into

304
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:39,300
like a fishing expedition to snag as

305
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,920
many people from the medical medium

306
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:43,800
communities they can snag and pull out

307
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:45,779
and draw out that's how it's done out

308
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,100
there

309
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:48,660
what is the name of the book He's

310
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,820
reading brain saver brain saver

311
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:53,100
protocols

312
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:55,579
so what happened though the zeolite

313
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:58,200
industry grew and then the

314
00:11:55,579 --> 00:11:59,760
cross-contamination occurred which I've

315
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,560
been talking about for a very long time

316
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,860
so I've been talking about the cross can

317
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:06,839
contamination which is the mix of the

318
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:08,279
zeolite powers

319
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:10,519
being

320
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:13,740
farmed together

321
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:16,560
harvested together out of the Earth

322
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:19,440
and then process together and that

323
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:24,120
didn't exist back years ago

324
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:26,339
but that exists now so yeah absolutely

325
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,720
very important to know no really good

326
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:29,579
question though and I talk about that

327
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,560
all the time about that and I really

328
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:33,540
appreciate that awesome

329
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:36,240
so let's go into something else so we're

330
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:39,660
in problematic for the brain

331
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:42,300
problematic and damaging supplements

332
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:44,459
now keep in mind it's a large list

333
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,600
so we got colostrum let's hit colostrum

334
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:47,880
how many of you guys have tried the

335
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,100
whole colostrum bandwagon right get on

336
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:52,740
the colostrum bandwagon

337
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,660
which for a lot of reasons is terrible

338
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:57,120
we know that right

339
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:58,860
colostrum is a dairy product that feeds

340
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,420
pathogens so here you are your

341
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:03,000
chronically ill you're sick and then

342
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:05,100
you're told try the colostrum that's

343
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,100
going to build up your immunity

344
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:11,220
meanwhile colostrum itself in a human

345
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:14,040
body feeds the reason why you're sick so

346
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:17,519
any kind of pathogenic stuff it's the

347
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:18,779
feed that pathogen that's in you so if

348
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,579
you're sick with the chronic fatigue

349
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:22,620
syndrome which is Epstein-Barr and

350
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:25,320
that's mm info by the way going all the

351
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:28,139
way back our ra that's mm info or

352
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:30,360
thyroid thyroiditis it's mm info if

353
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:33,120
you're sick with Epstein-Barr virus and

354
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,980
you do the classroom what's happening is

355
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,019
you're feeding the very virus that's

356
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,880
actually causing the problem so

357
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:40,560
colostrum is the very product that feeds

358
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,440
pathogens

359
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,540
wrangling says wow it's so cool all

360
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,620
replays uploaded in the newsletters yeah

361
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,300
you got to check out the medical meme

362
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:51,720
those newsletter sign up when you can

363
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:53,639
there's no pay wall sign up for

364
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:57,240
newsletter we try to give just free free

365
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:58,740
free free free free everything's free

366
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,959
um I don't want to break this up into

367
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:03,060
big courses and all that stuff and

368
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,500
charge and don't want endless fees

369
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:07,260
charging subscription fees and

370
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:09,660
everything else I just want it free

371
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:11,579
anyway so colostrum is the dairy product

372
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:13,200
that feeds pathogens such as viruses and

373
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:14,880
bacteria accelerating chronic illness

374
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,440
classified this is interesting though

375
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,940
what you'll learn in the medical healing

376
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,920
books when you have these in your hand

377
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,120
what you're going to learn these brain

378
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,519
saver books is you're going to learn a

379
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,600
lot about classified medical research in

380
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:29,000
science

381
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:29,000
classified medical research and science

382
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:34,019
classified medical research and science

383
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:36,120
use dairy products colostrum included as

384
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:39,600
fuel source to feed and raise pathogens

385
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:41,459
in Labs that's why we're sick now it's a

386
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,820
hundred years

387
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:47,339
little over a hundred years

388
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:50,300
of science raising pathogens in labs and

389
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:52,980
feeding dairy products to those

390
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:55,680
pathogens and then slowly releasing

391
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:57,240
those pathogens into the

392
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:00,180
public

393
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:03,839
as each decade went back by from the 19

394
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:07,860
teens to 1920s to 1930s to 1940s to

395
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:10,320
1950s to 1960s until we got to Woodstock

396
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:12,860
and then since Woodstock was blamed for

397
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,959
all the free sex and all the free love

398
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:17,519
and everybody was just having sex they

399
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:21,060
were saying they're saying that was the

400
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:23,339
spread of all the herpes simplex one but

401
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:25,440
really it was already put out there for

402
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:28,579
everybody long before my classified

403
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,579
medical research and science

404
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:33,660
let's go choose something else another

405
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:36,959
area we talked about deer antler today

406
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:39,860
we talked about a bunch of charcoal

407
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:42,420
charcoal my favorite

408
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:43,980
charcoal's my favorite you're taking

409
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,959
your charcoal supplements everybody's

410
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:47,760
saying oh I got charcoal I was

411
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:49,440
recommended to do charcoal right the

412
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,940
whole bit so let's hit charcoal for a

413
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,620
little bit

414
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:54,899
okay

415
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:57,420
charcoal take it internally so remember

416
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:59,579
that says charcoal taken internally

417
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:01,800
we're in problematic and damaging

418
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:03,600
supplements for the brain and body we're

419
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:06,139
in the brain saver books you guys have

420
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:09,839
to get the books when you get a chance

421
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:11,760
charcoal including activated charcoal

422
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:14,699
activated charcoal

423
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:17,040
suffocates intestinal linings

424
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:20,639
interesting

425
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:23,100
suffocates the intestinal tract lining

426
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,019
not allowing nutrients to absorb

427
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:26,820
assimilate or easily pass through the

428
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:28,440
intestinal Linings to the hepatic portal

429
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,240
vein so what this means is when you take

430
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,740
charcoal

431
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,120
right

432
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,279
I'm going to move this over you guys

433
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,199
just bear with me for a second I'm just

434
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:40,199
very excited about the brain saver books

435
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:41,279
I made a lot of sacrifices to put these

436
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:44,579
out here

437
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:46,560
still making sacrifices and I feel that

438
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:48,420
knowing it's in your hands and starting

439
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,279
to get in your hands is just a relief

440
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:52,880
it's like a relief I don't even know

441
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:52,880
what else to say

442
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:57,899
so when you take charcoal

443
00:16:56,339 --> 00:17:00,839
charcoal

444
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:01,920
has a spread out Factor

445
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:04,919
okay

446
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:07,079
it tends to spread out and blow up so

447
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:08,459
when charcoal gets into the intestinal

448
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:10,919
tract

449
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:12,839
it covers every single aspect of your

450
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:14,699
intestinal lining

451
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:16,740
not just part of your intestinal

452
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:19,020
lighting

453
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:21,959
and when it covers every aspect of your

454
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:24,179
intestinal lining it's so tiny and so

455
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:25,439
Nano in its form charcoal activated

456
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:29,640
charcoal

457
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,640
then it blocks uptake

458
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:35,760
you actually lose the ability to uptake

459
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,960
nutrients easy from your food so if

460
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,640
you're having your salads and you're

461
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,080
having your fruit you're having your

462
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,880
meat you're having your whatever you're

463
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,520
having your fish your chicken whatever

464
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,960
it is that you eat or want to eat if you

465
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,580
think there's a nutrient in any of it

466
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,740
you're not going to get those nutrients

467
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:51,840
readily accessible not going to get them

468
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:54,900
at all easily because of charcoal the

469
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:57,960
nutrients are going to get blocked and

470
00:17:54,900 --> 00:18:01,400
you're not going to have nutrient uptake

471
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,400
at full satisfaction

472
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:08,700
just keep on going with the charcoal

473
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:11,340
charcoal is one of my favorites it's not

474
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:15,740
my favorite as far as liking it it's my

475
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:15,740
favorite as far as how ridiculous it is

476
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:22,559
so the causes of nutritional

477
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,660
deficiencies suffocating good this sorry

478
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:27,720
this causes

479
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:30,720
nutritional deficiencies suffocating

480
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:33,179
good bacteria and microorganisms while

481
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:36,299
allowing bad bacteria and microorganisms

482
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:39,120
to thrive check this out

483
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:40,799
a question there brain saver is a true

484
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,500
Masterpiece many thanks for everything

485
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:46,340
you do for all of all of us incredible

486
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,340
thank you

487
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,860
listen I just want you guys to have the

488
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,480
answers I want you guys to be able to

489
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,980
empower yourselves I want you guys to be

490
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,020
able to protect yourselves that's all I

491
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:57,299
care about

492
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:58,740
if I cared about me me me me you'd see

493
00:18:57,299 --> 00:19:01,140
the Anthony Williams Show on Main Street

494
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:02,900
mainstream TV I've been asked to do it a

495
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:05,640
ton of times where it'd be like a series

496
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:07,740
working on people blah blah blah I've

497
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,780
turned down the Anthony Williams Show a

498
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:12,120
dozen dozens and dozens of times because

499
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:15,059
I need to make sure you get what you

500
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:16,940
need I can't make this about being a

501
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:20,940
star

502
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:23,460
and I'm not a star okay so this causes

503
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:25,620
nutritional deficiencies suffocating

504
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:27,480
good bacteria and microorganisms while

505
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:29,700
allowing bad bacteria microorganisms to

506
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:32,280
thrive so here's how it works

507
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:36,500
when you suffocate

508
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:36,500
the intestinal lining with charcoal

509
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,740
you're actually killing off good

510
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:44,039
bacteria

511
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:45,900
bad bacteria can be suffocated and

512
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:48,360
Thrive even become even stronger that's

513
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:50,520
how it works with bad bacteria charcoal

514
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,500
does not remove toxic heavy metals and

515
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:54,299
that's one of the biggest screw-ups in

516
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:58,620
Alternative Health right there

517
00:19:54,299 --> 00:20:01,380
is is the misinformation of charcoal

518
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:03,600
getting Metals out who says they've

519
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:06,000
never seeded there's not one single

520
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,580
paper that shows

521
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,559
charcoal removing toxic heavy metals it

522
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:13,260
doesn't exist

523
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:17,280
it never did

524
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:21,200
but for some reason it became like

525
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:24,299
what is it now like concrete

526
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,400
Granite Stone

527
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:28,740
charcoal does not remove toxins heavy

528
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,720
metals charcoal is not a binder for

529
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:32,700
toxic heavy metals it's not a binder for

530
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,700
toxic heavy metals either

531
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:37,559
charcoal is the opposite so it does the

532
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:40,260
opposite so check this out

533
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:42,840
charcoal can keep toxic heavy metals

534
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:44,640
from leaving the intestinal tract with

535
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,860
an explanation here

536
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,320
because the metals get buried under the

537
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:53,100
charcoal As It Coats the intestinal

538
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:55,080
tract lining what I love about SOC is

539
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:58,679
the explanation after explanation after

540
00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:00,419
explanation the details details that are

541
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:01,980
just mind-blowing to me all the time as

542
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:03,840
I was doing the books I was sitting

543
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:05,780
there I was like okay well give me the

544
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,820
explanation

545
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:10,980
charcoal even activated charcoal stains

546
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:12,960
the walls of the intestinal tract and

547
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:14,280
takes weeks to completely eliminate so

548
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,559
here's how it works when you take a

549
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:19,860
charcoal supplement

550
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:22,740
it stains the lining of the intestinal

551
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:25,280
tract in that stain doesn't leave for

552
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,280
weeks

553
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:30,240
I mean can you imagine what someone with

554
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:31,679
crohn's colitis IBS any kind of

555
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,179
intestinal tract disorders any kind of

556
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:36,000
intestinal tract problems gastroparesis

557
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:37,500
whatever it's serious

558
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,640
I know I'm running through a lot of

559
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:42,000
symptoms quick

560
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:44,880
because I want to get to the good stuff

561
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,940
charcoal is toxic to the body because it

562
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:50,400
keeps toxins inside the body

563
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:51,900
it is helpful to brush your teeth with

564
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,120
an activated charcoal so here's how cool

565
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:57,059
so if you look at me and you say hey aw

566
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:58,799
maybe you got a thing against charcoal

567
00:21:57,059 --> 00:22:01,440
maybe you just don't like the charcoal

568
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:03,480
companies or someone did you wrong and

569
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:06,299
this is your way to get them back that's

570
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:09,539
not true but watch this

571
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:11,900
I'm Pro charcoal and this very thing I'm

572
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:11,900
reading

573
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:18,600
charcoal supplements periodically okay

574
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,039
brushing your teeth with them if you

575
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:22,080
brush your teeth with an activated

576
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:25,679
charcoal periodically

577
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:27,840
just make sure you don't swallow

578
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,520
and instead spit out the charcoal then

579
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,020
rinse your mouth really good as good as

580
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,520
you can

581
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:34,380
so you can brush your teeth with

582
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:37,140
activated charcoal Spirit compassion has

583
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:40,260
told me that that's that's okay

584
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:43,020
so I have it in there because it's okay

585
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:44,820
so let's do another one too

586
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:47,400
let's hit

587
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:48,960
gut powder blends

588
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,740
so let's hit that one you guys I'm

589
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:54,380
breathing out of brain saver protocols

590
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:57,720
and I'm back

591
00:22:54,380 --> 00:23:01,440
today and this is brain saver right here

592
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:04,260
they're 40 off amazon.com us I'm mind

593
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:07,500
blown because they discounted it so much

594
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:11,400
which is like Angelic to me because it's

595
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:14,159
cost way more to make these books

596
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:17,520
um there's a 20 book every

597
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:20,880
section so it's like 20 book easy a 20

598
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,380
hour book a 20 book a twenty dollar book

599
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,940
I mean these books are like three four

600
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:25,860
they should be three four five hundred

601
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:27,480
dollars if you take all the information

602
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:29,400
and everything and then you look at

603
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,960
other health books out there

604
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:34,140
this is like

605
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:36,240
a dozen other health books that are

606
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:39,860
whatever twenty dollars a piece or more

607
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:42,900
or whatever okay gut powder blends

608
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:44,880
abrasive scratchy combinations of

609
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:47,159
irritants that do not balance the

610
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,440
microbiome and do quite the opposite

611
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:51,059
scramble up the microbiome see so here's

612
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,980
how it works no one's going to take a

613
00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:55,980
look in here no one's got a microscope

614
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:57,840
as you drop a gut powder blend

615
00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:00,000
from your functional guy or from

616
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:02,700
somewhere online or some ad or something

617
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,440
or this is good for your microbiome

618
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:06,960
no one's going to know what's happening

619
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:09,720
when that gut power plant goes down in

620
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:12,179
here there's no way to know

621
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,679
No One's Gonna have a camera

622
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:15,539
No One's Gonna Do an endoscopy and have

623
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,220
actually a camera in here watching the

624
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:19,080
gut powder blend in your intestinal

625
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:20,820
tract and see what it even does to even

626
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:25,940
help microbiome or not

627
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:25,940
it's all guessing games out of trends

628
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:30,600
but what happens when you drop a gut

629
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:33,720
powder blend

630
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:35,580
you scramble up your microbiome you

631
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:38,700
don't help it it breaks the natural

632
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:41,400
rhythm of a microbiome and does the

633
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:43,679
opposite and scrambles it all up

634
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:45,600
this worsens intestinal tract conditions

635
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:48,720
for sensitive people especially when

636
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:50,640
dealing with nervous system issues such

637
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,100
as vagus nerves

638
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,659
and phrenic nerve inflammation resulting

639
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:56,520
in increased anxiety and digestive

640
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:58,080
stress ego you're going to the person

641
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:00,240
that you need to go see it's like oh

642
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,440
your microbiome's off here here's

643
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,840
another gut powder here's another

644
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,340
probiotic with it here's a probiotic

645
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,320
powder mix with all this other stuff

646
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:08,520
let's just keep on taking it down and

647
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,200
meanwhile you're somebody that's already

648
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:12,000
going to the doctor because you have

649
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:14,820
anxiety you have depression you have

650
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,620
weird feelings you have Panic you have

651
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:17,940
different kinds of sensation in your

652
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:20,340
intestinal tract you have all these

653
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:21,780
issues that are vagus nerve related and

654
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:25,380
you're seeing your practice sure because

655
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:27,600
now you're taking the gut powder blends

656
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:29,940
and it's just scratching the heck out of

657
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,799
your intestinal lining uh irritating

658
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:33,960
your vagus nerves

659
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:36,779
gut powder Blends can throw an

660
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:40,279
intestinal tract into spasm and I've

661
00:25:36,779 --> 00:25:40,279
seen it happen before

662
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:47,820
creating cramping gastrointestinal pain

663
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,919
gastro gastritis bloating Health

664
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:52,080
practitioners will often mistake these

665
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:54,620
reactions for a healing or detox of some

666
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:57,419
sort so here's where things go wrong

667
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:59,159
so you're doing your good powder blends

668
00:25:57,419 --> 00:26:00,539
you think you're fixing your microbiome

669
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:02,460
and you're doing all this good stuff and

670
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:03,840
now you get thrown into intestinal tract

671
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:06,120
spasm and then you call your

672
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:09,559
practitioner friend healer and they go

673
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:09,559
you must be detoxing

674
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:14,659
when you're in spasm because of a gut

675
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,659
powder blend

676
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,340
Health practitioners will often mistake

677
00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:21,919
these reactions for a healing detox of

678
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:24,000
some sort so

679
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,740
we're talking about the brain saver

680
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,919
books have you tried the brain shot

681
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:30,960

the body

701
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:09,299
chicken cartilage raises blood acids so

702
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,919
it's like here you go and you're looking

good for me let me take this product

706
00:27:15,539 --> 00:27:20,520
raises blood acids supporting chronic

707
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,580
acidosis in all body systems and that's

708
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:24,840
what we don't want is chronic acidosis

709
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:27,480
Catherine Elizabeth

710
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:30,059
says I got choked up when you said you

711
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:32,520
were waiting for the info on eating

712
00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:34,080
disorders and you asked SOC you're

713
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:37,679
getting me choked up right now and you

714
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:40,679
asked SOC if he was there

715
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:45,179
and he answered that he was looking at

716
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:47,340
all the people with the disorder because

717
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:49,820

721
00:27:57,299 --> 00:28:00,600
and we're still going to talk about

722
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:03,020
chicken cartilage for a second

723
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,020
right

724
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:14,000
I'm gonna find that right now so just

725
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:17,360
bear with me

726
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,360
here we are

727
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:24,960
you guys the books are so big

728
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,700
you think I would know my way perfectly

729
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,440
around these books but I gotta tell you

730
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:30,960
I mean

731
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:34,039
the amount of information

732
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,039
okay here we are

733
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:41,940
okay many times

734
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:44,340
if you guys got a second many times

735
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:47,100
as I was sitting at my desk receiving

736
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:49,640
the information that you found here in

737
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,640
these pages

738
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:55,320
I would enter a sphere of light to take

739
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,760
me out of my personal world and

740
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:58,559
surroundings

741
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:01,020
so that I could hear Spirit of

742
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:05,820
compassion perfectly clearly

743
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:09,539
and see any Vision that Spirit provided

744
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:11,820
one day as I was sitting here waiting to

745
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:14,779
transcribe words from Spirit about

746
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:14,779
eating disorders

747
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:20,039
I asked where are you getting choked up

748
00:29:17,779 --> 00:29:22,799
like right here

749
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:27,679
ask where are you

750
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:27,679
Spirit of compassion said I'm here

751
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:34,919
I'm just opening up the plane

752
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:37,860
to get a reading from over a billion

753
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:40,320
Eating Disorders on this planet

754
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:44,039
so I can provide the information that

755
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:47,220
reaches everyone with eating struggles

756
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:50,360
I want it to be comprehensive so

757
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:50,360
everyone's included

758
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:54,960
that gets me to Catherine Elizabeth

759
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:57,000
because

760
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,940
he

761
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,659
you know I I don't usually you know I

762
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:02,460
don't

763
00:30:00,659 --> 00:30:05,279
it's the kind of thing that when you

764
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:07,799
hear it and you put it in writing to the

765
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:09,600
words exact words that come through

766
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:11,880
and you put it in writing you realize

767
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,679
how many people are suffering when I

768
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,600
think about it how many eating disorders

769
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:20,460
and we know Eating Disorders can be hell

770
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:22,380
hell on Earth eating disorders

771
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:26,640
can

772
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:27,899
cut people down like trees just it's

773
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,880
just terrible

774
00:30:27,899 --> 00:30:32,159
eating disorder chapter is so

775
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:33,840
mind-blowing and comprehensive that when

776
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:35,940
you do read the eating disorder chapter

777
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:39,360

because it's got so much information

779
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,919
and we're talking about the eating

780
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:46,260
disorder chapter but when you read the

eating disorders you have to almost it's

786
00:30:57,059 --> 00:31:01,020
not even just about reading between the

787
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:03,260
lines it's every single line

788
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:03,260
foreign

789
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:13,320
it's going to change how people look at

790
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:16,320
eating disorders and how the industries

791
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:17,940
and people deal with eating disorders so

792
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,919
this is going to change this book is

793
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:21,960
going to change the fabric of eating

794
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:24,120
disorders and how the industry views and

795
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:26,279
looks at eating disorders

796
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:28,279
yeah take a few years but it's going to

797
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:31,860
change

798
00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:34,039
probably even rapidly

799
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:34,039
foreign

800
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:41,940
here too

801
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:44,700
Spirit of compassion sees The Human

802
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:46,980
Condition on this planet and then

803
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:49,380
provides a deep understanding of how it

804
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:53,100
came to be

805
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:55,020
why and what to do with the resources we

806
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:56,760
have here on this planet we only have so

807
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:59,220
many resources on this planet to help

808
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:01,140
heal us and spirit of compassion has to

809
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:04,440
weed through it all right weed through

810
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:06,779
all the resources that that aren't good

811
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:09,320
and the resources that our answers and

812
00:32:06,779 --> 00:32:09,320
are good

813
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:16,620
we see you

814
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:18,779
we know what you're up against

815
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:21,659
that's from Spirit of compassion in me

816
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:24,299
so I wrote that here the spirit of

817
00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:27,059
compassion said you tell them that we

818
00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:28,500
see you and that's what he said to me

819
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:31,980
and I remember sitting in my office

820
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:34,080
chair the one I burned a hole in the

821
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:36,179
seat cushion was just basically torn the

822
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:38,120
shreds

823
00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:40,919
he said to me

824
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:44,580
right we see you

825
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:47,100
and I I said why he said say we see you

826
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:49,260
we know what you're up against you tell

827
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:53,539
them Spirit of compassion said to me

828
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:53,539
that that we know what you're up against

829
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:59,399
and then he said to me say this and I

830
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,360
said okay I'll write this he said write

831
00:32:59,399 --> 00:33:02,940
this

832
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:05,659
and we don't want you to go through it a

833
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:05,659
moment longer

834
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:12,419
Holly's help said Eating Disorders were

835
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:14,340

853
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:02,820
confusion and noise and rhetoric

854
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:04,860
of today's Health fads and trends

855
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:08,659
in order to regain your health and

857
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:12,480
[Music]

858
00:34:10,859 --> 00:34:15,300
so I'm back in the supplements section

859
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:17,099
for a little bit here you guys

860
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:18,919
meaning this is a different Pro this is

861
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:22,260
you know the supplement section meaning

862
00:34:18,919 --> 00:34:25,320
problematic and Mild mildly problematic

863
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:27,480
supplements to our brain and bodies

864
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:30,740
we're talking about charcoal then we're

865
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,740
going in the chicken cartilage

866
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:34,919
I didn't finish chicken cartilage these

867
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,960
acids forced the body to really to

868
00:34:34,919 --> 00:34:40,139
release calcium storage to neutralize

869
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,940
the acid while depleting bones

870
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:43,379
can cause kidney stones and gallbladder

871
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:46,020
stones so

872
00:34:43,379 --> 00:34:48,899
chicken cartilage supplements to a lot

873
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:51,060
and not good we can we can go into so

874
00:34:48,899 --> 00:34:52,560
many things in here that are true let's

875
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:55,080
do sodium bicarbonate how many times

876
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,460
have you seen sodium bicarbonate sodium

877
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:58,619
bicarbonate

878
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:00,720
Lorraine L says I didn't feel seen or

879
00:34:58,619 --> 00:35:03,320
understood before so reading that and

880
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,320
hearing that

881
00:35:05,339 --> 00:35:10,380
let's talk about the sodium bicarbonate

882
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,820
I've watched a lot of people get

883
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:14,460
themselves in trouble over the years

884
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:15,900
with the sodium bicarbonate

885
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,859
the one thing you're going to get from

886
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:19,380
me

887
00:35:16,859 --> 00:35:21,420
if if you want to know a little

888
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:24,960
something about medical media

889
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:27,060
is that consistency

890
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:30,960
when sodium bicarbonate blew up on the

891
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:32,460
scene I wasn't on the bandwagon I wasn't

892
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:35,060
saying you got to do all the sodium

893
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:35,060
bicarbonate

894
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:38,820
when charcoal blew up on the scene I

895
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:42,500
wasn't saying you got to do charcoal

896
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:42,500
here make sure you take your charcoal

897
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:49,200
when products blew up on the scene along

898
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:51,660
the way I didn't hop on that bandwagon

899
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:53,400
bandwagon when

900
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:55,500
anything like that happened there's

901
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:58,560
always consistency mm info's always been

902
00:35:55,500 --> 00:36:00,359
mm info original Source going back and

903
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:03,500
then people withdraw from it out there

904
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:06,240
people in health would take from it

905
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:08,220
and kind of poach little pieces along

906
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:11,160
the way

907
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:13,320
but you'll find consistency and it won't

908
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:15,780
contradict itself

909
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:17,700
it's not like each podcast doctor writes

910
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:20,040
one book about something and three late

911
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:21,660
years later oops sorry for leading you

912
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:23,220
guys all down that road because I'm

913
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:24,780
writing another book that's going this

914
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:27,119
direction

915
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:29,460
so everybody's just one big experiment

916
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:31,440
great

917
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:33,180
oyster supplements I'm noticing oyster

918
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:36,000
supplements are big out there and

919
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:38,880
happening on the scene right

920
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,280
bottom dwellers such as oysters contain

921
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,880
mercury dioxins

922
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:46,020
strontium uranium

923
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:48,359
petrochemicals and other toxic heavy

924
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:50,359
metals not a good source of zinc that's

925
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:54,000
another thing get your zinc from oysters

926
00:36:50,359 --> 00:36:56,900
oysters.zinc no they don't

927
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,880
they got the tiny bit the tiniest bit

928
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:02,460
you'd have to eat a barrel of oysters to

929
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:04,320
get zinc from oysters a barrel you'd

930
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:07,680
have to be doing oysters every night for

931
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:09,780
dinner to get zinc for moistures

932
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:12,000
I just love how this stuff happens it's

933
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:13,920
like oh no oysters are zinc you get your

934
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,380
zinc from oysters you do no you don't

935
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,300
you just get a tiny bit of zinc for

936
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:19,740
moisture so small in my meat you would

937
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:21,420
have to eat a lot of oysters and you

938
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:23,460
have to eat oysters so many oysters it

939
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:27,180
would be ridiculous you'd have to suck

940
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:29,040
down a dozen oysters twice a day

941
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:33,599
and that won't even do it

942
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:36,180
while oysters do contain some zinc

943
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:39,680
zinc gets diminished and depleted from

944
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:42,060
toxins zinc is the toxin

945
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:44,339
equalizer so what happens is when you've

946
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:47,520
got dioxins and mercury and an oyster it

947
00:37:44,339 --> 00:37:49,260
cancels out the zinc automatically

948
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,420
the toxins

949
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:53,280
okay so while oysters do contain some

950
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:55,619
zinc zinc gets diminished and depleted

951
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:58,800
from toxins the toxins in oysters cancel

952
00:37:55,619 --> 00:38:01,560
out the zinc that oysters provide

953
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:03,000
consuming oysters oyster supplements

954
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:06,119
because that's big right now is always

955
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,920
oyster supplements or oyster extracts

956
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:09,420
it's big right there I'm not making any

957
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:12,839
friends again

958
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:15,420
the kick me sign is on my back ready

959
00:38:12,839 --> 00:38:17,640
who knows what I'm gonna get

960
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:21,260
soon tonight whatever tomorrow will kind

961
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:21,260
of BS comes my way

962
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:26,160
the toxins in oysters cancel out the

963
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:28,200
zinc that oysters provide consuming

964
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:29,460
oysters oyster supplements or oyster

965
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:32,099
extracts

966
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:34,380
does not restore zinc levels and clear

967
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:36,140
up zinc deficiencies you will never be

968
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:38,400
able to clear up a zinc deficiency

969
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:42,020
eating oysters

970
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,020
if your life depended on it

971
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:48,740
we can go on and on and on the books are

972
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,740
packed

973
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:53,280
and we I mean there's so much

974
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:54,839
information in here chlorophyll let's

975
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,400
just do a little chlorophyll for a sec

976
00:38:54,839 --> 00:38:57,480
chlorophyll is big people call it the

977
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,240
green water

978
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:02,099
I'm taking my green water he's even see

979
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,599
it on social media you see when you see

980
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:05,160
YouTubers the problems might say like

981
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:07,380
YouTubers are like got my green water

982
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:09,720
here and then I got my other thing here

983
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:11,520
and hey you guys I'm making my avocado

984
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:15,060
toast and I'm taking my supplementation

985
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:18,740
my fish oil my green water my you know

986
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:21,660
my charcoal I'm taking my Pearl powder

987
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:24,660
oh my God

988
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:26,099
man when you get sick someday and you're

989
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:29,280
doing all that it's not going to be fun

990
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:30,900
climbing out of it okay

991
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,099
so we'll do the chlorophyll for a couple

992
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:33,060
of seconds all right because that's a

993
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:36,000
big one

994
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:37,800
get ready for this the body does not

995
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,140
utilize chlorophyll that's been

996
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:42,180
processed and singled out from its

997
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:44,400
original Source because the chlorophyll

998
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:47,099
is missing key components that are

999
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:50,760
intertwined when chlorophyll is part of

1000
00:39:47,099 --> 00:39:52,579
a complete Whole Food chlorophyll has to

1001
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:55,380
be part of a complete Whole Food

1002
00:39:52,579 --> 00:39:56,820
chlorophyll cannot be isolated or

1003
00:39:55,380 --> 00:40:00,180
separated

1004
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:02,400
it loses the rest of its constituents it

1005
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:04,140
loses the rest of its chemical compounds

1006
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,720
to actually make it work inside the body

1007
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:08,820
anybody doing chlorophyll in a tincture

1008
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:10,619
bottle or a liquid bottle that you buy

1009
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:13,280
in the store is not getting anything

1010
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:13,280
from it

1011
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:22,579
I saw someone say Atlantic dolls is high

1012
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,579
in Arsenic uh try again it's not

1013
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:27,540
unbelievable

1014
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:29,520
are you talking about Pacific dolls the

1015
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:32,460
great garbage patch

1016
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:34,380
because you might be talking about the

1017
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:35,820
specific dolls

1018
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:37,680
which

1019
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:41,780
for decades now

1020
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:45,119
we all know you ain't supposed to eat

1021
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:48,060
you're not talking about Atlantic

1022
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:50,040
dolls which doesn't have that but the

1023
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:51,660
great garbage patch all the way over

1024
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:53,640
there

1025
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:56,400
anything's possible

1026
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:58,200
and that's misinformation once again to

1027
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,060
scare someone and you know what that

1028
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:02,220
that actually happens because people out

1029
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:04,200
there in the health movements the gurus

1030
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:06,119
out there get so angry that they're

1031
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:08,099
constantly hearing about medical media

1032
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:10,500
and medical meeting info and medical

1033
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:12,900
medium books and dolls and wild

1034
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:14,520
blueberries they're so sick of it

1035
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:16,560
that they'll just come up with anything

1036
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:19,440
the adults is bad for you because of

1037
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:21,240
this oh don't do that because of this

1038
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,460
it's actually a sick world out there

1039
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:26,700
when you think about it I can't tell you

1040
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:29,400
how many people don't want people who

1041
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:31,980
are sick to heal they have they would

1042
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:33,839
rather have people suffer that on their

1043
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:36,240
hands and knees

1044
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:38,400
then ever heal

1045
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:40,140
they don't care because they have so

1046
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,480
much hatred in their heart

1047
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:43,560
so much hatred in their evil little

1048
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,680
heart

1049
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:48,000
that don't let people just stay sick and

1050
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:51,780
they'll spread terrible information

1051
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,760
because there's there's they're mentally

1052
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:55,320
sick with Darkness

1053
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,960
and so they want people who are

1054
00:41:55,320 --> 00:42:00,060
chronically ill to stay safe that's the

1055
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:02,640
kind of world we're on

1056
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:06,359
we're in a world where there's good and

1057
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:07,619
evil I'm sorry but it's true and someone

1058
00:42:06,359 --> 00:42:08,700
told me the other day that there's

1059
00:42:07,619 --> 00:42:11,339
people that don't believe there's any

1060
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:12,960
evil that it's all just about your frame

1061
00:42:11,339 --> 00:42:15,119
of mind Dimension it's all about love

1062
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,500
and everything else and it's not are you

1063
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:18,960
kidding me

1064
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:21,480
there's so much evil on this planet you

1065
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:23,880
guys know you can

1066
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:25,680
there's so much right and there's good

1067
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:27,660
on this planet too but it's still the

1068
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:32,240
battle still a spiritual battle good and

1069
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:32,240
evil it's still happening it's here

1070
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:37,339
all right so let's go into this a little

1071
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:40,200
bit I think I was going to talk about

1072
00:42:37,339 --> 00:42:41,579
chlorophyll and I was I'm at your

1073
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:44,460
service you guys

1074
00:42:41,579 --> 00:42:46,440
separating chlorophyll is a processing

1075
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:48,420
method stripping other phytochemical

1076
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:50,160
compounds that make chlorophyll usable

1077
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:52,560
and potent when it enters the body as

1078
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:54,240
part of a whole food the processing part

1079
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:56,599
of chlorophyll stops it from even

1080
00:42:54,240 --> 00:43:00,300
working

1081
00:42:56,599 --> 00:43:03,540
chlorophyll cannot be isolated and still

1082
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:05,579
serve a purpose so when you take

1083
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:07,680
chlorophyll supplements it can't serve a

1084
00:43:05,579 --> 00:43:10,319
purpose it's throwing away money it's

1085
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:12,660
throwing away Everything Medical mediums

1086
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:16,319
book

1087
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:18,359
um for 29 these massive volumes here is

1088
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:20,700
way too much money I'm gonna buy a

1089
00:43:18,359 --> 00:43:23,099
seventy dollar bottle of chlorophyll

1090
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:24,839
instead because this Guru over here in

1091
00:43:23,099 --> 00:43:27,740
this other platform says you should be

1092
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:27,740
on chlorophyll

1093
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,420
chlorophyll can only be utilized if

1094
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:36,000
still in its natural source with other

1095
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:38,640
phytochemical compounds and nutrients

1096
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,440
it's becoming a trend to add a few drops

1097
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:42,900
of chlorophyll to your water to turn it

1098
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:46,680
green have you had your green water

1099
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:48,839
as if you were adding food coloring

1100
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:51,420
as a healing and beneficial alternative

1101
00:43:48,839 --> 00:43:54,560
add some drops of parsley juice or

1102
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:57,359
barley grass juice powder to your water

1103
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:59,160
anyway there's so much information in

1104
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:00,480
here you guys it's packed I just want to

1105
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:02,700
give you a reminder here how to clean

1106
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,900
your books too so I want to show you

1107
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:07,260
this really quick so I put a little

1108
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:09,780
water on the tan towel they come greasy

1109
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:12,000
from Amazon's conveyor belts plus other

1110
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:15,240
Warehouse conveyor belts it's not from

1111
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,640
it's not from the publisher these came

1112
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:21,839
pristine they were these were minted

1113
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:23,579
pristine and beautiful and clean and

1114
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:25,680
then what happened is they got shipped

1115
00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:28,680
beautiful clean and pristine to like

1116
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:30,300
Amazon so forth Amazon they take the

1117
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:32,760
book and they throw it on the conveyor

1118
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:34,440
belt conveyor belt is loaded with grease

1119
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:36,119
there's grease fittings on the conveyor

1120
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:38,339
belt and they grease them every other

1121
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:39,900
day with the machine so the conveyor

1122
00:44:38,339 --> 00:44:41,880
belt just has all these metal rings

1123
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:43,560
going down and the book goes travels

1124
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:45,480
down the conveyor belt like this to be

1125
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:47,339
processed for your order and then by the

1126
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:48,960
time it gets to you it's grease here a

1127
00:44:47,339 --> 00:44:51,300
little grease here some brown stuff here

1128
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,800
some Gunk here somebody working might

1129
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:54,119
have been eating a little something or

1130
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,339
drinking a little something got a little

1131
00:44:54,119 --> 00:44:58,380
something on there so what happens is

1132
00:44:56,339 --> 00:45:00,180
you take your towel with a little bit of

1133
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:02,040
dish soap and some dampness damp cloth

1134
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:04,140
and you clean your books off and they

1135
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:05,700
come out so nice that's probably a

1136
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:08,460
better thing instead of getting mad at

1137
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:10,079
me and giving me a one star look out for

1138
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:12,119
imposters

1139
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:14,640
um some imposters just recently wanted

1140
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:17,460
to ruin the medical medium book release

1141
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:19,980
by by throwing a tremendous amount of

1142
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:22,200
shade with misinformation there are

1143
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:23,819
imposters out there right now

1144
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:25,380
pretending to do some kind of

1145
00:45:23,819 --> 00:45:27,420
consultation or reading which I don't do

1146
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:28,740
consultations consultations or readings

1147
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:30,140
with

1148
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:33,180
women

1149
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:35,460
and taking them for a ride and taking

1150
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:37,079
their money or taking their or with

1151
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:39,720
breaking their trust or whatever they're

1152
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:42,119
doing so there's imposters that are

1153
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:43,920
actually trying to get people to say oh

1154
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:47,099
aw is this bad person doing

1155
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:48,599
consultations and taking advantage of

1156
00:45:47,099 --> 00:45:50,640
people their kindness and everything

1157
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:52,740
else so and their money or whatever it

1158
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:54,960
is so look out for imposters because

1159
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:56,880
they're out and then that's making

1160
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:59,880
people who have been hurt by the

1161
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:02,400
imposters to spread against the stories

1162
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:06,480
and posts

1163
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:09,480
about how bad Anthony Williams is with

1164
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:11,700
an S when it's Anthony William on top of

1165
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:13,500
it or whatever so anyway I just want to

1166
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:14,760
talk about the imposters as well sign up

1167
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:16,440
