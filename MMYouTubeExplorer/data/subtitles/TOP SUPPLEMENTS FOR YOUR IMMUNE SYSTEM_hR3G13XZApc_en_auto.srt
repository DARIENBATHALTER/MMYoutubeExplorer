bad plagues bad flus right

93
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,159
and i've always been ahead of the curve

94
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,840
and something if you're new to medical

95
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,000
media information medical medium

96
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,680
information is so advanced

97
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,200
it leads the way in natural medicine

98
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,800
alternative medicine conventional

99
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,640
medicine when it comes down to chronic

100
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,560
illness so it leads the way

101
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,799
it's the most advanced information it's

102
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,560
always ahead of everybody else

103
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,400
like the blood draw information the

104
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,680
blood testing information that

105
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,040
that i delivered and

106
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,480
so many other things about how

107
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,239
epstein-barr causes all the different

108
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,040
conditions out there how it's one of the

109
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,879
viruses

110
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,120
how there's more than one variety of

111
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,400
epstein-barr and how it reactivates and

112
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,400
causes all these symptoms

113
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,239
no one knew this so medical medium

114
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,840
information if you're brand new here

115
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:52,000
is leading the way it's leading the way

116
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,519
for all the naturopathic doctors

117
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
functional medicine doctors

118
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,840
chiropractors who play natural medicine

119
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,319
all of it it's leading the way for all

120
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,560
of them

121
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,480
and they use pieces of it they're all

122
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,400
using pieces of it now

123
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,840
and that's what's happening so i want to

124
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,959
make sure still leading the way

125
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,959
and it's important that we have

126
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,159
that information so we can protect

127
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,040
ourselves

128
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,720
so we're talking about flu protocols

129
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,519
we're talking about immune system

130
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,959
building

131
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,720
we're gonna use zinc shock therapy

132
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,280
vitamin c shock therapy we need

133
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,880
time t do a couple of other things too

134
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:31,440
so i'm looking forward to it um

135
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,800
gianna i just made the banana garlic

136
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,120

aren't they

139
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,600
that's an incredible immune system

140
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,280
builder right there you've got the raw

141
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,639

145
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,360
garlic in there you got the banana and

146
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,199
you've got the glucose and i'm going to

147
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,040
talk about why that works

148
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,560
so you guys we're in the immune system

149
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,680
we're in there now we're talking about

150
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,680
it here we are so we got some

151
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,759
supplements in front of us

152
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,800
these are the ones i use my friends

153
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,800
family me

154
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,720
for immune system protection immune

155
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,720
system buildings so let's hit the zinc

156
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,680
right off the running

157
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,680
sinks something everybody's deficient in

158
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,720
i talk about it all the time

159
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,600
so stuff falling out of the sky and i

160
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,880
say stuff

161
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,880
falling out of the sky like the

162
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,960
chemtrail stuff right

163
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,240
all that different pollution everything

164
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,320
that's falling out of the sky

165
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,240
ddt is still floating around in the

166
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,759
atmosphere all the time

167
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,680
it blows around from continent to

168
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,520
continent right we got all the stuff

169
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,479
just blowing around and when it lands in

170
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,639
your soil

171
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,680
when it lands in the soil we grow our

172
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,360
food in

173
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,240
it depletes it so toxic heavy metals and

174
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,520
other

175
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,320
chemicals coming out of the sky land in

176
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,280
the soil

177
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,639
every single day every single night and

178
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,320
they then the rain

179
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:55,440
brings them into the soil into the earth

180
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,039
and it depletes the earth of zinc it's

181
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,199
one of the reasons why we don't have

182
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,840
zinc anymore in our soils our foods

183
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,960
don't have

184
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,759
zinc and if i hear one more time one

185
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,039
more time

186
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:10,400
just eat some oysters or do some oyster

187
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,800
do some an oyster supplement i mean i

188
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,000
mean

189
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,360
honestly it it's it's like i can do

190
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,360
everything i can

191
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,479
but i don't know what more i can do i

192
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,319
mean i just

193
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,759
don't you know so let's try that now

194
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,600
right don't you don't want to try that

195
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,560
it's terrible

196
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,240
so when you're doing oyster products

197
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,240
you're just getting more mercury

198
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,319
one of the very things that's depleting

199
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,000
the soils of zinc

200
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,520
so let's just try let's try to eat some

201
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,120
oysters and just so you know

202
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:42,479
oysters aren't high in zinc they just

203
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,319
show zinc they show it as one of its

204
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,840
trace minerals but they're not high in

205
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,759
zinc it's just that everything is so

206
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,199
depleted in zinc

207
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,160
and this is important to know because

208
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:55,280
this is where everybody fools everybody

209
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:58,080
everything is so depleted in zinc

210
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,280
that the tiny tiny bit of zinc in a

211
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,720
pumpkin seed

212
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,680
that shows up or in an oyster that shows

213
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,680
up make us go hey

214
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,240
no let's sink oh my god we just found

215
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,120
zinc just found zinc hey there's zinc

216
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,039
and oysters

217
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,960
eat a bunch of oysters if you want your

218
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,440
zinc

219
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,000
meanwhile every single fruit and

220
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,919
vegetable is supposed to show even more

221
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
zinc than an oyster does but it doesn't

222
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:27,120
because the earth is depleted right

223
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,520
the earth is depleted the soils and

224
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,759
pumpkin seeds happen to have a little

225
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,400
bit of zinc in it but you can eat yours

226
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,000
you can eat pumpkin seeds until you

227
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,680
can't eat them anymore and you're not

228
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,080
going to get enough zinc for the immune

229
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,720
system but that's the illusion

230
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,160
that's happening out there pumpkin seeds

231
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,080

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,919

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,480
chris good to see you pumpkin seeds

274
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,120
never got anyone better and chris

275
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,880
it's so true it's so true mary said i

276
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,959
also wonder where does the zinc and the

277
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,640
supplements then come from trace mineral

278
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:33,279
zinc liquid zinc sulfate

279
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,480
from the earth but you can't it's not in

280
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,560
your soil

281
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,800
where your crops are growing it's not in

282
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,279
the soil your crops only have a little

283
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,720
root

284
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:45,519
system a little root system in the dirt

285
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,440
so you got your little top soil right

286
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,640
and you got something growing out of

287
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,560
your topsoil

288
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,040
okay you've got a little root system

289
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:56,080
down in here and all that soil there

290
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:58,160
the little root system is in okay that's

291
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,279
your turnip is in or anything is in that

292
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:03,839
root system

293
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:06,560
the zinc's not there it's not

294
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,880
but but that's this is how ridiculous

295
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:12,079
alternative medicine is

296
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:14,959
or conventional medicine too is okay

297
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:16,720
let me eat a box of oysters i better

298
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:19,200
call my oyster guy

299
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,959
let me do that right let me quit like my

300
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,959
oyster connection

301
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,880
how stupid or a supplement now that's

302
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:27,839
got oyster in it i mean can we be

303
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,839
any crazier

304
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:36,079
so why are you announcing amazon f4

305
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,519
tick-tock won't notify me when you're

306
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:40,560
live

307
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:42,000
so then tick-tock okay you guys so let's

308
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,680
get into it on supplements that are

309
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,200
critical zinc is one of those critical

310
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,480
supplements right there

311
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:51,440
okay that's the one that isn't hard

312
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,640
on the stomach like other zincs doesn't

313
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,440
have the citric acid

314
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,920
the alcohol the preservatives it's not a

315
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,160
hard

316
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,279
zinc and that's that's the difference

317
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,120
there's so many people are like why i

318
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:04,000

323
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,680
reputable company out there and i

324
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,000
grabbed it it was the liquid stuff i

325
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,240
looked

326
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,920
at i said yeah i do see garbage in here

327
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,880
but let me just everybody says this is

328
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,480
the best one

329
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,079
let me take a look i took the cap off

330
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,160
boom sent it down and i

331
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,839
literally thought i was gonna vomit my

332
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,959
guts out on the ground

333
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,560
i said this is poison poison and so

334

that's the thing out there there's bad

335
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:36,800
zincs out there and bad

336
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:39,680
supplements give supplements a bad name

337
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,760
that's how it works anyway you don't

338
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,000
need to take a lot you can take a drop

339
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,079
you

340
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,040
can take a little bit each day you can

341
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:49,120
take one

one drop can do that's by available like

348
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,839
that

349
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,839
one drop it's not gonna happen you can

350
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,600

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,399
how stupid is that okay let me just eat

352
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:14,399
bags of pumpkin seeds if i get sick

353
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:16,399
right all important information

354
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,800
off the running these things matter

355
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,399
details matter

356
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,160
they do so good to see you guys coming

357
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,440
on we're talking about a building the

358
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,800
immune system why it's important so

359
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,120
let's go into the immune system

360
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,079
basophils monocytes neutrophils

361
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,839
lymphocytes

362
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:34,639
killer cells white blood count cbc

363
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,880
right your white your whites blood cells

364
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,920
your large white blood cells

365
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:42,000
okay neutrophils all part of the

366
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,000
right basophils neutrophils monocytes

367
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,440
lymphocytes

368
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,279
all these different aspects of our

369
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,760
immune system

370
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:51,680
we need things to support it because

371
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,000
those those parts of our immune system

372
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,120
are

373
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,800
under attack when we get invaders enter

374
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,600
our lives

375
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,959
so zinc shock therapy is is really a

376
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,040
great

377
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,480

goldenseal

00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:09,680
the immune system

457
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:13,279

cold's just colds don't exist on the

476
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,160
planet

477
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:58,560
any time someone starts coming down with

478
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,600
something it's the flu

479
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:04,160
or flu family virus is like the plague

480
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,400
but the cold has been the cold is gone

481
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,319
when someone just gets a mild rendition

482
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,839
of a cold

483
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,839
that was just a mild rendition of the

484
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:14,319
flu the cold just

485
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:15,120
died off that whole you know i caught a

486
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,679
cold

487
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:20,160
you didn't catch a cold you caught a flu

488
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:22,640
you just had a mild version of it or

489
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,880
you were able to get through it fast

490
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,360
someone else caught the same cold

491
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,520
they're coughing their guts out they now

492
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,720
got bronchitis they're on antibiotics

493
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,400
they're seeing the doctor

494
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,400
they caught the same cold you caught

495
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:38,720
you just your immune system handled it a

496
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,720
little better

497
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,840
yeah you might not have been at that

498
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,200
place where your cycle wasn't coming on

499
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,440
and it might have been in between your

500
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,919
cycle coming on and ovulation coming on

501
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,480
and then

502
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:53,120
it didn't turn into a bad flu it turned

503
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:56,240
into a real mild flu

504
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,360
right important enough that's how it

505
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,360
works

506
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,799
but someone else caught it's cold too in

507
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,559
the group of people so the group of

508
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:04,480
friends someone else caught that cold

509
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:06,480
well that wasn't no cold because someone

510
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,200
else is literally bedridden with 103

511
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,880
temperature

512
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,280
they're on the couch to coughing their

513
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,760
guts out

514
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,880
and they caught the same cold there's no

515
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:18,640
colds

516
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:21,039
anywhere anymore cold the cold

517
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,960
virus the little rhinoviruses and the

518
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:25,760
little cold viruses

519
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,559
those have come and gone in our history

520
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,679
gone

521
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:31,280
gone they're not around no more

522
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,960
you get a little something well i got a

523
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,640
little sinus congestion i'm starting to

524
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,840
come down with something that's the flu

525
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,840
you might have a mild one

526
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,240
but that's the flu it's important to

527
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,160
know how things work

528
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,600
the goldenseal is critical for all that

529
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,559
if you guys want to know what this is

530
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,240
of emergency stuff via the victor i am

531
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:52,320
mary ergy

532
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,440
dot com important to know so it's

533
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,240
memorgy.com

534
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,919
that's the stuff that i use if i want a

535
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,360
golden seal it's got to be one with the

536
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,640
quality it's got to be the one i know i

537
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,400
can trust it's gonna be the one i know

538
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,280
that can knock something out in my

539
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,039
system and not something else it has to

540
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,760
be a product that doesn't have that

541
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,640
hidden that hidden five six seven eight

542
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,880
percent of

543
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:16,400
hidden mystery ingredients that the

544
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,200
manufacturers all put in everybody's

545
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,320
supplements

546
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,640
vimergy doesn't allow that

547
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,000
so yeah so so goldenseal is important so

548
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,080
i love covering the cold

549
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,840
information but i hear people like i

550
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:31,280
think i got a cold now

551
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:33,200
no and another thing too is allergies

552
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:36,240
get confused

553
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,760
i love when that happens someone's

554
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,840
coughing

555
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,240
they got the runny nose they got the

556
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:45,760
sinuses and it's like

557
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:48,880
you know it's like it's my allergies

558
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,720

00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,480
you know yeah well it's allergy time i

560
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,520

goldenseal what i love about goldenseal

669
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:51,520
is there's something inside of you

even once since i started following mm

714
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,279
at a little point where you could get

715
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,960
something absolutely there's that many

716
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:44,720
things going around and you know that

00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:50,080
mm stuff

719
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:52,159
for sure so there's something about gold

720
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,960
and seal the right kind like when i take

721
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:58,799
the vimergy golden seal right

722
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:01,200
something just hits you

723
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:02,559
that your body's kicking in the gear to

724
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:06,480
heal

725
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:07,760
you've got to remember that too right

726
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,960
always ask your doctor what's right for

727
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,400
you take what your doctor wants you to

728
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,200
take i'm just saying that when i have a

729
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:15,440
family member

730
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:18,880
take this i always ask them you feel it

731
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,000
you feel it kicking in you feel that

732
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,240
right

733
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,600
that's your body registering to this

734
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:27,039
right here

735
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:29,919
because this is so potent and strong

736
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:30,720
and so right and and the quality is so

737
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,400
good

738
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,159
that the right kind of golden seal

739
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:37,200
because golden seal in itself

740
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:41,760
is magical magical herb

741
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:43,760
magical root magical herb and

742
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:46,159
and when you when it starts entering the

743
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,159
body

744
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,400
so angela says isn't golden seal one of

745
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,360
the supplements like licorice you

746
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,080
shouldn't

747
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,919
take longer than two weeks yeah i mean

748
00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:00,159
here's the thing right

749
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:03,039
with goldenseal it's like an antibiotic

750
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:04,000
you said it's a natural antibiotic okay

751
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,600
and

752
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,720
if you have to be on it longer than two

753
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,000
weeks it's still gonna do what it's

754
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,000
gonna do for you

755
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,679
but i talk about it in cleansing heal

756
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,679
that it's good to take a break sometimes

757
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:16,559
two weeks on two weeks off

758
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:19,679
but i've taken goldenseal just long term

759
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:21,360
to keep my immune system strong

760
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,200
i've recommended family members be on

761
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:25,840
gold gold and seal

762
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,440
six weeks solid without taking a break

763
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,679
i've recommended

764
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,600
people i've known friends to be on gold

765
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:33,039
seal for a three-month stint

766
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,200
and then take a break and then go back

767
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,720
on it for three months but yes

768
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,240
it's a little rule of thumb take little

769
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:42,399
breaks i do the two week

770
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,399
on two week off and cleanse the heel

771
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,600
so goldenseal is just something really

772
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:52,159
special

773
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:56,080
it's one of those herbs roots herb root

774
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:58,399
that talks

775
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,600
communicates to the immune system to the

776
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:01,279
body

777
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:04,880
and you can feel it when you're taking

778
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:08,320
it when that sore throat's coming on

779
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:12,000
and you're like i got to do something

780
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:13,440
and you take that golden seal you know

781
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,039

804
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:04,240
while while the patient's on the table

805
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,640

00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,599

938
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:26,639
two dropper fulls of licorice

939
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:28,159
going down lemon balm talk about that

940
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,079
lemon balm is incredible for the immune

941
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:32,639
system

942
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:34,399
people got the gas the bloating their

943
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:36,800
their hydrochloric acid

944
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:38,480
died inside of them where their stomach

945
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:41,520
lands weakened and just

946
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:45,119
fell apart right

947
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,119
grab a little stomach over here

948
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:52,960
let's do this real quick

949
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:55,760
guys i'm honored you're here we

950
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:58,240
are talking about the immune system

951
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,240
hello

952
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:03,920
so we got a stomach right here

953
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,400
one of the reasons why everybody has

954
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,079
digestive problems and they also have

955
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,400
bad bacteria in their gut is because

956
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:12,400
their stomach glands have been burnt out

957
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,160
their low their hydrochloric acid is low

958
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,800
to nil to none

959
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:18,720
okay virtually none non-existent and

960
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:21,839
that's what happens when that happens

961
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:23,520
bad bacteria can prosper especially for

962
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:25,839
feeding that bad bacteria bad

963
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:28,079
foods right so then the bad bacteria

964
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:28,720
prospers inside the gut each pylori

965
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:32,240
rises

966
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,960
e coli arises rises and streptococcus

967
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:36,000
rises

968
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:39,440
right there apple then good to see you

969
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:42,720
everything everything rises that's bad

970
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:45,839
bad and it rises okay

971
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,599
what i love about even goldenseal

972
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:50,240
is good for that too but what i love

973
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:53,040
about like the lemon balm

974
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,040
that's the nettle

975
00:35:53,280 --> 00:36:00,640
what i love about the lemon balm is

976
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:02,880
it's antibacterial antibacterial

977
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:05,359
love it but it does something else

978
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,680
because the gut gets inflamed from all

979
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:08,960
the bad bacteria the inflammation

980
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,520
bothers the nerves

981
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,400
and so all the nerves going into the gut

982
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,079
gets sensitive

983
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,960
and then everybody has all these

984
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:18,480
neurological issues in their gut

985
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,720
and they feel it and they're having

986
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,920
problems in their gut intestinal tract

987
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,680
different digestive issues and

988
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,079
everything else michelle l good to see

989
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,400
you

990
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:28,079
they have all these problems and that's

991
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,640
what i love about lemon balm

992
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:32,640
it's an anti-spasmodic for those nerves

993
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,320
it calms down the nerves inside the gut

994
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:37,599
but it's antibacterial too

995
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:40,160
it's a great gentle immune builder

996
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:41,520
something can be taken every day every

997
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,760
single day

998
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:45,280
you can take the lemon balm every day

999
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,440
helping to keep your immune system

1000
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,960
strong so even stuff that's inside of

1001
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,760
you that's growing that shouldn't be

1002
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,880
there

1003
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:56,000
starts to grow starts to grow

1004
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,359
elizabeth elizabeth edwards says yep me

1005
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,240
i get stabbing pains you get the

1006
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:02,000
stabbing gut pains right

1007
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,680
little gas bubble moving through and it

1008
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,800
hurts like heck

1009
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:09,359
because it's inflamed in there and

1010
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,839
so lemon balm is something that i use

1011
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,440
for

1012
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:12,880
my friends and family when they have any

1013
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,520
kind of issues like this so that's

1014
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,119
important

1015
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,480

now here's the thing all right people

1236
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:01,920
all about the collagen

1237
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:04,000
the collagen the collagen right

1238
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,000
proof medical medium information leads

1239
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,800
the way is for years i've been telling

1240
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,839
everybody

1241
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:11,280
that you can't grow collagen from eating

1242
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:13,280
collagen

1243
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,319
and now since medical medium was so

1244
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,599
advanced

1245
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:17,359
everybody laughed they're like he's

1246
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:19,040
wrong medical means wrong you take

1247
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:20,880
collagen powder in order to build

1248
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:22,240
collagen right

1249
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,520
well they were wrong and i told

1250
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,040
everybody they were wrong you'll find

1251
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,000
that medical media information is never

1252
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,079
proven wrong ever

1253
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,079
never has it's consistent and it's never

1254
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:32,560
proven wrong it's only proven right

1255
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:34,240
now all the supplement companies have

1256
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:36,000
taken medical medium info

1257
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:38,240
and they're saying you can't build

1258
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,640
collagen by eating collagen anymore

1259
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:42,240
so you need all these other things and

1260
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,760
they're taking little pieces of medical

1261
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,960
medium information and they're putting

1262
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,359
it in a product and they're saying this

1263
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:49,680
is how you build collagen

1264
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:50,800
mm info if you're new here leads the way

1265
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,160
in natural medicine

1266
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:55,119
for years and years and years actually

1267
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:57,520
for decades now fact

1268
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:59,119
so important to know why am i even

1269
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:01,920
talking about any of this

1270
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:04,560
metal leaf is a great supporter of that

1271
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,560
collagen

1272
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:08,319
how come they don't put multiple herbs

1273
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:12,640
in one

1274
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:12,640
bottle only ah

1275
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:17,599
very important question right there how

1276
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:20,800
come they don't

1277
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:21,680
because that's how they rip you off out

1278
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,240
there

1279
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:26,319
well very important question i talk

1280
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:29,680
about that and cleanse the heal

1281
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:32,560
that's how they rip you off

1282
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:33,280
they put lots of different herbs in one

1283
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:36,960
bottle

1284
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:40,640
so you can't get better if you buy

1285
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:42,800
an immune system builder herbal formula

1286
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:45,280

sunday

1290
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:58,400
fact because every one of those bottles

1291
00:46:54,560 --> 00:47:01,760
they use a spidgeon of a little smidgen

1292
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:05,920
a little spickle a little tiny smidgen

1293
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:08,640
of each herb and a poor quality one

1294
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:11,200
because that's how they make their money

1295
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:13,520
that's how they make their money

1296
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,520

00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:31,839
that we that we sell to all the small

1301
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:34,400
independent companies

1302
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:36,160
yep we're putting in a little tiny bit

1303
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:39,040
of each herb

1304
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:40,559
we're going to put adrenal formula on

1305
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:42,559
there and then we're going to put

1306
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:43,760
immune formula on another one and then

1307
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:46,559
we're going to put

1308
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,280
a brain formula in another one and we're

1309
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:50,480
going to throw

1310
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:51,359
a little tiny speck of each herb in that

1311
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:54,079
formula

1312
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:56,240
so that they can't get better but yet it

1313
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:57,280
costs us nothing to do it that way

1314
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,200
and we're gonna make sure there's

1315
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,480
alcohol in there or citric acid and

1316
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,599
everything else in there and natural

1317
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,839
flavors

1318
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:07,839
perfect yup that's what we do at herbal

1319
00:48:04,839 --> 00:48:07,839
world

1320
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,680
and that's how it's done another reason

1321
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,599
why

1322
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,800
vimergy doesn't do that now here's the

1323
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,559
thing

1324
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,720
the reason why medical medium protocols

1325
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:20,800
get people better so when they really

1326
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:22,240
understand the protocol they're seeing

1327
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:25,680
that they're not getting an

1328
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:28,079
herbal remedy that has 20 herbs in it

1329
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:30,559
because you won't get better if there's

1330
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:33,599
20 herbs in there

1331
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:35,599
if licorice is an antiviral you need a

1332
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:37,119
good amount of it in a good quality

1333
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:39,680
amount of it

1334
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:42,000
the right quality to make something

1335
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:44,240
happen

1336
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,440
you can't get better with a speck of

1337
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:47,760
cat's claw

1338
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:49,200
a speck in a supplement that's either a

1339
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:51,280
dried herb supplement

1340
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:52,559
or a bad liquid liquid one that has a

1341
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:55,280
whole bunch of different herbs

1342
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:57,040
you can't get better you guys this is

1343
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:59,520
priceless information

1344
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:00,400
this is information i taught for decades

1345
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:03,040
so people had to

1346
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:04,480
wait in line to talk to me so they

1347
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,280
because they were sick and they're like

1348
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,880
well i took

1349
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:09,599
uh this well you know but you're not

1350
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,599
getting better

1351
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:16,079
because knowing the right herb to take

1352
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:19,280
in the right quantity is how people

1353
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:22,319
get better that's how it's done you guys

00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:23,040

00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:35,839
yeah are you coming over i just finished

1485
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,839
my journal

1486
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:43,760
okay all right

1487
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:46,400
i need to light a scented candle right

1488
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,400
now because

1489
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:51,599
okay so um i think that was a mistake

1490
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:54,799
strike 77 right

1491
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:57,680
okay i gotta blow this out oh my god

1492
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:59,280
oh my god oh my god that stuff is just

1493
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:01,520
poisonous

1494
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:03,440
that just lowered my immune system so i

1495
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:05,119
need to go back into immune system stuff

1496
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:06,720
right now

1497
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:08,559
all right we're talking about nettle

1498
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,680
nettle is nettle supports the immune

1499
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:12,000
system

1500
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:12,799
it has phytochemical compounds that your

1501
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,880
white count

1502
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:17,839
feeds off of so let's get some white cow

1503
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:17,839
now

1504
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:22,240
so it's a white blood cell you guys

1505
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:25,520
right there

1506
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:29,280
it's a white blood cell yeah

1507
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:30,000
and white blood cells love phytochemical

1508
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:33,920
compounds from

1509
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:38,240
herbs certain herbs and

1510
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:40,720
nettle leaf actually nourishes and feeds

1511
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:42,480
your white count it doesn't make it go

1512
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:44,960
berserk strong right

1513
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:46,079
like after infections but it keeps it

1514
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,599
strong

1515
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:49,280
so it helps to keep it strong that's why

1516
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:51,599
i love metal leaf i also love natalie

1517
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:53,359
because it is the building blocks

1518
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:54,960
it's one of the building blocks to not

1519
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:57,599
have wrinkled skin and

1520
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:59,119
not age so fast it's one of those

1521
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:03,440
building blocks

1522
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:03,440

1523
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:09,760

1532
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:47,520
and some chaga mushroom

1533
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:59,119
okay let me get some water

1534
00:57:55,839 --> 00:58:02,319
so i'm making some chaga and reishi tea

1535
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:02,319
which i do occasionally

1536
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:07,680
which you're not going to find in this

1537
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:09,680
reishi mushroom

1538
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:10,720
you're not going to find caffeine in

1539
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:12,960
here

1540
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:14,480
so that's the chaga mushroom which

1541
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:16,400
you're not going to find in the rishi

1542
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:17,680
we're live i don't know what else to say

1543
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:20,480
we're not going to find

1544
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:20,880
caffeine in here you're not going to

1545
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:24,079
find

1546
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:25,760
caffeine mixed in here why

1547
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:27,599
because caffeine destroys your immune

1548
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:29,119
system i know i'm gonna get a whole

1549
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:30,160
bunch of crap from a lot of you guys

1550
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:34,880
right now like

1551
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:37,200
what about decaf coffee what about

1552
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:38,640
what about my green tea what about my

1553
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:41,440
matcha tea

1554
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:43,440
you're not your caffeine lowers your

1555
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:46,480
immune system

1556
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:49,119
it can set you up for a bad flu

1557
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:50,160
it could set you up if people are around

1558
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:53,760
people that actually

1559
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:54,319
have the flu or or something that looks

1560
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,920
like it

1561
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:57,359
or anything like it or a plague or

1562
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:58,000
anything it's not even just that if

1563
00:58:57,359 --> 00:58:59,280
you've got

1564
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,680
immune system problems you got

1565
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:02,640
autoimmune you don't want caffeine mixed

1566
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:05,119
in your mushroom

1567
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:06,240
powder so you don't want caffeine mixed

1568
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:09,440
in your rishi

1569
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:11,680
your chocolate yorishi

1570
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:12,720
so important to know you don't put

1571
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:15,520
coffee

1572
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:17,440
in rishi mushroom you don't put coffee

1573
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:19,440
in chaga

1574
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:21,280
and then pretend that gave you energy

1575
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:24,400
that the rishi gave you energy

1576
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:26,000
rishi is not known to give you energy

1577
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:27,440
change is not known to give you give you

1578
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,280
energy but they're good for the immune

1579
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:30,640
system but if you mix them with coffee

1580
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:32,240
you just destroyed it

1581
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:34,960
you destroy you're destroying your

1582
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:37,280
immune system

1583
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:39,440
caffeine destroys the immune system so

1584
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:42,400
if you mix caffeine with

1585
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:43,680
mushroom you don't even get the good out

1586
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,119
of the mushrooms because you're

1587
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:46,400
weakening your immune system when the

1588
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:48,480
mushroom's supposed to

1589
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:50,079
actually help your immune system because

1590
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:53,920
caffeine stimulates

1591
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:53,920
your adrenals right

1592
00:59:56,319 --> 01:00:02,559
your adrenals caffeine blows them out

1593
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:04,559
blows them out boom blows them out

1594
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:07,920
that's what caffeine does

1595
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:11,599
blows them out important to know

1596
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:11,599
so i'm making some

1597
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,839
i'm making some mushroom tea

1598
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:21,680
so i got some rishi and some chaga

1599
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:29,440
okay that's a great immune system

1600
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:32,640
builder right there can have that once

1601
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:34,720
long i don't have it every day

1602
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:36,160
i just have it like a couple times a

1603
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:39,119
week a little bit

1604
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:39,680
here and there you can put raw honey in

1605
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:42,960
here

1606
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:45,520
i got some raw honey

1607
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:47,200
it's important to know though that

1608
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:50,240
literally people are out there

1609
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:52,480
and they just want to destroy people

1610
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:53,839
people love to destroy people they just

1611
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:55,040
love to destroy people that's what they

1612
01:00:53,839 --> 01:00:56,720
do out there

1613
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:58,559
wild lizzie flower death by a thousand

1614
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:02,400
cuts out there

1615
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:05,119
people love to kill people

1616
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:05,760
you don't think so you don't think so

1617
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:09,599
okay

1618
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:12,880
then why take something so pure

1619
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:14,480
something so pure and then contaminate

1620
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:16,240
it with something that actually ages

1621
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:18,559
women

1622
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:19,680
ages women gets them addicted and ages

1623
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:23,040
women

1624
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:25,440
right makes their hair fall out

1625
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:28,400
because caffeine is a psychoactive drug

1626
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:31,760
so let's take a psychoactive drug

1627
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:33,440
stick it in something pure and good

1628
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:35,440
because people out there want to hurt

1629
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:39,040
people i don't know what else to say

1630
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:41,200
it is that i don't give me that there's

1631
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:42,720
no bad people out there don't give me

1632
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:45,359
that

1633
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:47,520
okay let's do some vitamin shock vitamin

1634
01:01:45,359 --> 01:01:50,640
c shock therapy now

1635
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:53,839
let's do that vitamin c shock therapy is

1636
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:53,839
something that i really love

1637
01:01:54,079 --> 01:01:57,039
i still have to talk about lysine i

1638
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:58,640
still have to talk about b12 for a

1639
01:01:57,039 --> 01:02:03,039
couple of minutes

1640
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:04,960
so what i love about but first of all i

saying that's what i do right

1646

1668
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:34,400
are

1669
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:36,160
are using a vitamin c you'll when you

1670
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:39,599
experience this someday

1671
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:40,400
if you ever like branch on to using say

1672
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:42,720
the microc

1673
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:44,079
you'll notice the difference it won't

1674
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:46,559
burn a hole in your stomach

1675
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:47,599
it's not like battery acid so i just put

1676
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:52,240
honey in here

1677
01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:55,920
squeeze of orange two capsules of microc

1678
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:58,559
every two hours every two waking hours

1679
01:03:55,920 --> 01:04:00,240
awake every two hours there's rose hips

1680
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:01,520
in this microc by the way i know a lot

1681
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:03,359
of people like well i'm not gonna

1682
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:04,799
i'm not gonna venture on to unless it's

1683
01:04:03,359 --> 01:04:07,839
got rose hips

1684
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:07,839
there's rose hips in there

1685
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:13,920
so every two hours

1686
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:15,680
waking two hours because if you're

1687
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:16,079
sleeping you don't want to wake yourself

1688
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:18,000
up

1689
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:19,920
to try to actually take this you want to

1690
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:26,480
sleep

1691
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:29,599
right so yeah

1692
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:33,039
there we go that's it mixed it up that's

1693
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:33,039
the vitamin c shock therapy

1694
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:39,839
it's really good too every two hours

1695
01:04:37,839 --> 01:04:41,280
that's a great technique for the immune

1696
01:04:39,839 --> 01:04:42,799
system you think you're coming down with

1697
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:46,480
something you think something's up

1698
01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:46,480
okay let's talk about lysine

1719
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:27,200
simplex one

1720
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:28,640
all these things cause all these

1721
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:30,480
problems even if you don't have a

1722
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:32,000
shingles rash or a fever blister in the

1723
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:33,280
moment the viruses are still in us they

1724
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,920
go into our brain stem

1725
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:37,039
they just they just the neurotoxins go

1726
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:38,640
into the brain stuff

1727
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:40,240
they cause vagus nerve problems they

1728
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:40,720
cause phrenic nerve problems all that

1729
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:42,400
stuff

1730
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:44,240
and what i love about lysine it's a

1731
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:45,599
great way to recover it should be in

1732
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:48,079
somebody's protocol

1733
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:48,799
robinson k says definitely works well

1734
01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:50,400
the vitamin c

1735
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:52,400
shock therapy and zinc shock therapy

1736
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:55,839
works incredible it's

1737
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:57,520

01:05:55,839 --> 01:06:00,319
medical medium information right leads

1739
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:02,079
the way advanced information

1740
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:03,760
and then there's a whole bunch of closet

1741
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:07,039
doers

1742
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:08,480
they're closet mm people meaning all the

1743
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:10,000
podcast doctors that take the

1750
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:21,920
then medical mean gets credit

1751
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:23,440

1752
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:24,559

body needs b12 so yes it's part of our

1794
01:07:50,799 --> 01:07:54,319
immune system because every single cell

1795
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:57,119
in your body every single immune cell

1796
01:07:54,319 --> 01:07:58,640
relies on b12 every single killer cell

1797
01:07:57,119 --> 01:08:01,440
immune cell basophils

1798
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:02,480
monocytes lymphocytes neutrophils uh

1799
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:07,200

1830
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:11,440
yes it did but nobody knew how to use it

1831
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:13,040
as a therapeutic tool to bring

1832
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:15,679
somebody's life back

1833
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:17,600

1870
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:56,159

01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:04,159
dr nesbit says that diana

1873
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:07,120
he says make sure you check with your

1874
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:07,600
your physician that your psychiatric

1875
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:13,840
meds

1876
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:13,840
are in order

1877
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:18,880
dr nesbitt said that if your psychiatric

1878
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:22,000
meds aren't in water then

1879
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:23,679
what if they are in order he says dr

1880
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:26,159
nesbit said that if your psychiatric

1881
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:27,760
meds are in perfect order

1882
01:11:26,159 --> 01:11:29,440
then you might be ready for a straight

1883
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:31,840
jacket really

1884
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:34,560
it's terrible to say that that's

1885
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:38,000
actually horrible

1886
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:41,520
dr desmond says that for you to sit here

1887
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:44,800
and lie

1888
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:44,800

recommend for diana

1895
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:13,679
dr nesbit says he recommends diana seek

1896
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:15,760
psychiatric help and care and she might

1897
01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:19,199
even be certifiable

1898
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:20,800
that's that's that's terrible

1899
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:22,880

dr nesbitt's saying yeah did that i i'm

1910
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:48,840

i i yeah dr nesbit that's dr nesbitt's

1912
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:54,159
opinion

1913
01:12:50,159 --> 01:12:57,440
okay that gives me back to surgery okay

1914
01:12:54,159 --> 01:12:59,440
yep okay all right we

1915
01:12:57,440 --> 01:13:05,440
we gotta get going okay dr nesmet's

1916
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:07,280
going back to surgery you guys

1917
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:09,360
talk about the b12 every single cell in

1918
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:09,920
the body relies on it it's critical

1919
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:13,520
every

1920
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:15,840
pepper seed good to see you every single

1921
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:16,640
every single cell in the body relies on

1922
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:18,880
b12

1923
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:21,199
very important to know you guys so i ran

1924
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:23,360
across a lot of the

1925
01:13:21,199 --> 01:13:24,880
and then the curcumin great for the

1926
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:27,040
immune system

1927
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:28,080
it's got antibiotic antibacterial

1928
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:30,719
properties

1929
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:31,280
not real real strong ones but it has

1930
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:33,199
them

1931
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:35,040
and i love all that like when mixing it

1932
01:13:33,199 --> 01:13:36,800
up because different viruses respond

1933
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:38,640
differently to different things and your

1934
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:41,840
immune system responds differently

1935
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:43,360
so like i like uh curcumin because it's

1936
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:45,520
a natural aspirin

1937
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:47,040
you know if you're working out and you

1938
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:49,679
pull something out

1939
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:50,480
if you like you push yourself too hard

1940
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:52,320
if you're

1941
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:54,480
chronically ill and you don't work out

1942
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:56,320
but yet you push yourself really hard

1943
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:57,120
just trying to get like from one room to

1944
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:59,440
another

1945
01:13:57,120 --> 01:14:00,159
curcumin's really great either way you

1946
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:01,840
know it's

1947
01:14:00,159 --> 01:14:04,000
it's a major workout for somebody who

1948
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:04,880
has chronic illness to even get into a

1949
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,800
shower

1950
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:08,239
sometimes the water can almost knock

1951
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:09,360
people over who have been through hell

1952
01:14:08,239 --> 01:14:10,880
and back and they got severe

1953
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:13,679
neurological fatigue

1954
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:14,000
i've seen this for years and and they

1955
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:16,239
can

1956
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:18,080
strain something just literally going to

1957
01:14:16,239 --> 01:14:19,679
bathroom or getting up and doing

1958
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:22,159
something or working in the kitchen

1959
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:23,920
lifting something i always love curcumin

1960
01:14:22,159 --> 01:14:25,520
as someone's recovering from chronic

1961
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:27,120
illness and coming back from it and they

1962
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:28,400
don't have the muscles yet they don't

1963
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:30,480
have that strength yet

1964
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:32,480
they're still really fatigued and going

1965
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:34,080
through so much but yet they're healing

1966
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:35,760
and on their way to healings they love

1967
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:37,199
human for all these reasons and

1968
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:38,640
for someone who's already healed and

1969
01:14:37,199 --> 01:14:40,880
they're exercising again and they got

1970
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:43,840
their life back and they're exercising

1971
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:43,840
right

1972
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:48,159
i thought that dr nesbit really said

1973
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:51,679
some just harsh things sometimes and

1974
01:14:48,159 --> 01:14:51,679

1975
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:57,040
okay anyway i ran across a whole bunch

01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:58,719

i'll tell you why one is

2072
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:40,640
one is because there's no fat in this

2073
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:42,159
meal what people do when they start

2074
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:43,600
getting sick or they're chronically ill

2075
01:18:42,159 --> 01:18:45,280
they eat too much fat they fat

2076
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:47,120
themselves to sickness

2077
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:48,800
that's what happens so when someone's

2078
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:50,640
catching a flu or they're getting the

2079
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:52,080
plague i can't tell you how many people

you got some garlic clove chopped up

2089
01:19:21,199 --> 01:19:25,600
boom thrown on there you got honey right

2090
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:28,560
and

2091
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:29,520
little lemon to moisten the sheet you

2092
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:31,840
got yourself

2093
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:33,840
the immune system nori roll right there

2094
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:36,000
okay why is it the immune system normal

2095
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:37,679
for one it doesn't have fat in there

2096
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,040
when people start getting sick they

2097
01:19:37,679 --> 01:19:39,840
start coming down with something the

2098
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:42,800
first thing they do

2099
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:44,640
is they eat they eat they're like i need

2100
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:46,159
something i'm getting sick i'm feeling

2101
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:48,000
sick i need to eat and they end up

2102
01:19:46,159 --> 01:19:49,440
eating fat oil

2103
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,040
they end up having olive oil on

2104
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:52,560
something they need to be nuts and seeds

2105
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:54,000
nut butters i've seen people eat a half

2106
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:55,679
a jar of peanut butter as they were

2107
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,360
getting sick

2108
01:19:55,679 --> 01:19:58,880
their taste buds get funny they feel

2109
01:19:57,360 --> 01:20:00,320
like they have to eat their throat's

2110
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:01,760
getting a little funny so they start

2111
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:03,440
eating and they end up eating a heavy

2112
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:04,080
meal whether it's animal protein or it's

2113
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:06,719
plant-based

2114
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:08,000
fat you know like avocados and nuts and

2115
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:09,760
seeds and oils or

2116
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,280
chicken or fish or something they end up

2117
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:12,880
eating and the minute they

2118
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:14,719
throw all that fat in their system they

2119
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:16,800
just explode at the virus and now the

2120
01:20:14,719 --> 01:20:18,000
vibe meaning the virus just proliferates

2121
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:19,520
like crazy because you don't

2122
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:22,000
have oxygen anymore in your bloodstream

2123
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:24,320
because it's filled with fat

2124
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,360
this is a fat free option that's an

2125
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:29,120
immune

2126
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:31,199
buster because it's a bug buster

2127
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:32,960
you got the garlic and the honey the

2128
01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:34,639
honey is anti-viral

2129
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:37,360
so you got the raw honey sitting right

2130
01:20:34,639 --> 01:20:37,920
in here you've got iodine in the noria

2131
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:39,600
sheet

2132
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:42,320
iodine is an antiseptic against

2133
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:44,400
pathogens

2134
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:46,800
bananas are antiviral did you guys know

2135
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:48,080
that bananas have antiviral properties

2136
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:50,880
and then you got the garlic which is

2137
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:53,840
antiviral right

2138
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:55,600
great for you know great bugs for any

2139
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:58,960
kind of bugs viruses

2140
01:20:55,600 --> 01:21:01,280
bugs and viruses and pathogens explode

2141
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:03,199
they explode they proliferate when you

2142
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:05,679
start downing fat when you're sick

2143
01:21:03,199 --> 01:21:06,800
you instead of having them explode by

2144
01:21:05,679 --> 01:21:09,360
proliferating them

2145
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:10,239
you want to explode them by killing them

2146
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:13,199
so you want

2147
01:21:10,239 --> 01:21:14,080
foods that actually help so you can you

2148
01:21:13,199 --> 01:21:15,600
can your immune system

2149
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:17,120
can go and destroy that virus or

2150
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:18,400
anything you're taking can go destroy

2151
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:20,560
the virus the minute you're starting to

2152
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:22,400
get sick you've got that golden seal

2153
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:24,000
going down but you don't need a steak

2154
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:25,040
dinner with your golden seal

2155
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:27,120
because you're going to be doing all

2156
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:28,000
this fat you don't need a chicken dinner

2157
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:29,520
when you're starting to get

2158
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,880
sick as you're taking your golden seal

2159
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:31,360
yeah you still should take your golden

2160
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:33,199
seal

2161
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:34,639
but the problem is if everybody's

2162
01:21:33,199 --> 01:21:36,320
fatting themselves to death as they're

2163
01:21:34,639 --> 01:21:39,440
getting sick or anything's happening

2164
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:42,560
then it defeats the purpose

2165
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:43,920
all right so let's talk about what's

2166
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:46,239
coming

2167
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:47,280
i've already mentioned this months ago

2168
01:21:46,239 --> 01:21:49,440
and right now we're

2169
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:50,480
up against a flu now and a plague flu

2170
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:52,000
we're up against two

2171
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:53,360
we're up against a stomach flu right now

2172
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,719
that's out there and starting to swish

2173
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:56,239
around out there

2174
01:21:54,719 --> 01:21:57,840
it's all kept into the wire no one's

2175
01:21:56,239 --> 01:21:58,320
talking about it but everybody's getting

2176
01:21:57,840 --> 01:21:59,840
it

2177
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:02,880
there's a reason they don't talk about

2178
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:06,080
it and then you got the plague

2179
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:09,280
up and amp and up cranking up right

2180
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:10,480
so you got that going down too so that's

2181
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:11,840
on the up and up

2182
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:13,920
and we're going to head to a place where

2183
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:15,280
after the summer after because everybody

2184
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:16,880
is like in this this place where they're

2185
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:18,560
just well i'm so sick of the whole thing

2186
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:20,000
i'm so sick of everything going on

2187
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:22,000
and everybody's out and about and doing

2188
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:23,600
their thing but people are passing

2189
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:26,080
around a lot of bugs right now

2190
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:27,440
passed around a lot of epstein bars

2191
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:28,719
because they haven't been around people

2192
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:30,400
so they're passing around a lot of

2193
01:22:28,719 --> 01:22:32,000
epstein bars people are

2194
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:33,840
doing a lot of stuff out there and

2195
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:35,360
passing around a lot of simplexes epson

2196
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:36,960
bar and shingles

2197
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:38,159
and then we got the flus going around

2198
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:40,880
and the plague going around and it's

2199
01:22:38,159 --> 01:22:42,239
going to take us to the fall

2200
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:44,800
and it's going to take us into early

2201
01:22:42,239 --> 01:22:47,440
winter and

2202
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:49,280
it's going to be pretty bad not to

2203
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:52,639
mention what's coming along with this

2204
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:54,000
which is the uptick a massive uptick of

2205
01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:55,760
chronic illness

2206
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:57,840
which is going to be hushed hushed for a

2207
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:59,199
while it's not going to be talked about

2208
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:00,560
no one's going to know about it but

2209
01:22:59,199 --> 01:23:02,960
people are going to be like

2210
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:04,639
chronically sick fatigue like never

2211
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:06,560
before autoimmune disease is being

2212
01:23:04,639 --> 01:23:08,320
diagnosed left and right chronic

2213
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:10,480
