[0.00 - 5.36] I was born
[2.24 - 8.58] and right when I was born had
[5.36 - 10.94] pharmaceutical applications now I don't
[8.58 - 13.68] have any toxic heavy metals I never had
[10.94 - 15.84] any medals passed down from generation
[13.68 - 19.62] to generation I never had any Metals
[15.84 - 22.26] passed down from my family line
[19.62 - 24.00] no okay
[22.26 - 25.68] talk about toxic heavy metals right now
[24.00 - 27.54] this is day seven medical medium brain
[25.68 - 29.28] shot therapy cleanse challenge but we're
[27.54 - 32.70] talking about Metals this is a big deal
[29.28 - 34.98] because people have Metals I'm going to
[32.70 - 37.62] read about tattoos in a little while too
[34.98 - 39.78] which is really interesting too now I'm
[37.62 - 42.54] not anti-tattoos if somebody wants a
[39.78 - 45.06] tattoo I don't like judge anybody for
[42.54 - 47.18] tattoos for having ink quite the
[45.06 - 49.92] contrary quite the opposite actually
[47.18 - 51.54] because people like tattoos they get
[49.92 - 53.10] tattoos but I'm going to talk about why
[51.54 - 58.50] we're doing the
[53.10 - 58.50] toxic heavy metal exposure shot exposure
[58.68 - 64.92] ly exposure that's the word right there
[61.74 - 67.68] okay so it's important to know we're
[64.92 - 69.78] talking about exposure and what happens
[67.68 - 71.22] with tattoos so you're going to want to
[69.78 - 74.30] hang out for this show what happens with
[71.22 - 78.48] tattoos is they give you continual
[74.30 - 81.24] exposure for years to come that's why I
[78.48 - 84.12] like not only just a heavy metal detox
[81.24 - 86.64] right smoothie and heavy metal right
[84.12 - 88.26] cleanse right in the brain saver books
[86.64 - 90.66] not only do I like that I like the
[88.26 - 94.50] exposure shot because the exposure shot
[90.66 - 96.96] is grabbing on to new exposure you can
[94.50 - 100.20] have an old tattoo
[96.96 - 102.48] but it's releasing brand new exposure
[100.20 - 104.64] every day
[102.48 - 106.20] for the rest of your life I see people
[104.64 - 107.88] that get tattooed on their face they get
[106.20 - 109.56] tattooed on their neck they get tattooed
[107.88 - 110.52] behind their ear they get tattooed on
[109.56 - 112.32] their neck
[110.52 - 113.76] they get their head shaved and tattooed
[112.32 - 116.16] on their scalp and their hair grows back
[113.76 - 117.66] over it but I see people they get a lot
[116.16 - 119.82] of different tattoos if your tattoo

[129.00 - 135.00] closer to the brain
[132.66 - 138.42] it's critical to do the exposure shot
[135.00 - 141.36] ask your doctor what's right for you
[138.42 - 143.46] it'll take my advice
[141.36 - 145.08] take the book to your doctor and listen

[257.46 - 261.96] right here
[259.28 - 263.34] exposure to toxic heavy metals is all
[261.96 - 265.44] around us
[263.34 - 267.84] you don't think so
[265.44 - 270.48] if you took an antibiotic
[267.84 - 275.34] you got toxic heavy metal exposure
[270.48 - 278.22] if you took an antibiotic 10 years ago
[275.34 - 279.84] you have toxic heavy metal exposure if
[278.22 - 281.46] you took an antibiotic when you had your
[279.84 - 283.20] ear infections when you were five years
[281.46 - 284.70] old six years old seven years old you
[283.20 - 286.56] had your bronchitis ear infections or
[284.70 - 288.30] anything else and you took your
[286.56 - 289.86] antibiotic I'm not saying don't take
[288.30 - 291.30] antibiotics or whatever that's not what
[289.86 - 293.46] this is about ask your doctor what's
[291.30 - 297.96] right for you I'm saying
[293.46 - 300.24] you had toxic heavy metal exposure
[297.96 - 302.46] we're not taught about it so we don't
[300.24 - 304.38] learn to recognize our sources of
[302.46 - 307.14] exposure
[304.38 - 310.52] we're not taught to recognize the
[307.14 - 310.52] exposure we're not
[311.30 - 316.20] so we don't learn to recognize our
[313.92 - 317.76] sources of exposure if we're not taught
[316.20 - 319.14] about it how do you recognize your
[317.76 - 322.20] sources
[319.14 - 324.90] they're much closer than we think toxic
[322.20 - 327.32] heavy metals have plenty of avenues to
[324.90 - 330.12] enter our bodies
[327.32 - 333.72] from toxic heavy metals that we breathe
[330.12 - 336.48] we breathe them in every day every
[333.72 - 339.36] single breath we take has toxic heavy
[336.48 - 342.30] metals in it courteous
[339.36 - 343.80] the evil doers dropping it out of the
[342.30 - 345.90] sky on us
[343.80 - 347.76] okay
[345.90 - 350.28] I don't like to be the messenger of this
[347.76 - 353.52] information but it is what it is
[350.28 - 355.74] it falls out of the sky every day
[353.52 - 357.72] every single day you took a jog one
[355.74 - 360.00] morning you're breathing it all in
[357.72 - 363.72] that's okay we can still Empower
[360.00 - 367.02] ourselves and do things for ourselves
[363.72 - 370.68] so it's around us
[367.02 - 373.68] Nicole McCullough says best info ever
[370.68 - 374.64] exclamation points and best cookbook oh
[373.68 - 377.04] my God
[374.64 - 380.70] over a hundred recipes in these brain
[377.04 - 383.10] saver books this is more than that
[380.70 - 385.08] from toxic heavy metals we breathe to
[383.10 - 387.42] toxic heavy metals that we eat we don't
[385.08 - 390.72] eat toxic heavy metals
[387.42 - 394.10] it's falling out of the sky on the grass
[390.72 - 396.96] that the cows are eating
[394.10 - 399.90] toxic heavy metals are falling out of
[396.96 - 401.82] the sky on the grass that the grass-fed
[399.90 - 404.84] beef cows
[401.82 - 404.84] are eating
[405.60 - 411.06] toxic heavy metals fall on the courtyard
[408.18 - 412.38] of every chicken
[411.06 - 415.14] that's
[412.38 - 416.70] pecking around grabbing bugs and things
[415.14 - 418.86] like that and everything else toxic
[416.70 - 421.68] heavy metals are everywhere they're in
[418.86 - 423.72] our water they're in our air they're in
[421.68 - 426.72] our food you can't avoid it on the
[423.72 - 430.26] planet industrialized Metals float
[426.72 - 433.16] amongst the skies in the atmosphere drop
[430.26 - 435.66] everywhere on the planet
[433.16 - 438.62] you can't avoid it but that's okay
[435.66 - 438.62] that's okay
[439.32 - 443.64] to toxic heavy metals that we drink to
[441.30 - 445.74] toxic heavy metals that we bathe in to
[443.64 - 448.50] toxic heavy metals that we touch or
[445.74 - 450.12] apply to our skin
[448.50 - 452.70] that's right
[450.12 - 455.64] simply touching aluminum foil or a
[452.70 - 458.34] battery can be enough for their mining
[455.64 - 460.38] particles of metal to leach into our
[458.34 - 463.14] bloodstream this isn't about fear and
[460.38 - 465.30] Chaos it's about
[463.14 - 468.54] becoming empowered and doing something
[465.30 - 471.00] about it I would like to know I don't
[468.54 - 473.94] want to live my life not knowing I don't
[471.00 - 477.12] want to go about my days not knowing
[473.94 - 479.88] I want to know everything what about you
[477.12 - 482.04] guys I want to know what's around me I
[479.88 - 483.66] don't want to just ignore it like it
[482.04 - 485.88] doesn't exist
[483.66 - 487.80] I I get it some people do there's a lot
[485.88 - 489.72] of people out there they just don't want
[487.80 - 492.12] to know what exists they want to ignore
[489.72 - 495.66] it they don't want to think that it's
[492.12 - 498.42] even possible but I want to know
[495.66 - 501.54] Courtney M.A says she wants to know
[498.42 - 502.98] people they can live in Bliss or
[501.54 - 505.02] ignorance or whatever we want to call it
[502.98 - 506.88] they just don't want to know what's
[505.02 - 508.62] happening
[506.88 - 510.36] and that's not to mention the metal
[508.62 - 512.40] particles we can ingest from food
[510.36 - 514.32] prepared in certain metal cookware or
[512.40 - 517.80] food and drinks served in metal
[514.32 - 522.24] containers I do not smack a metal
[517.80 - 527.58] utensil out of a friend's hand
[522.24 - 527.58] if I see them use a metal utensil
[529.44 - 535.04] I don't Smack it out of somebody's hands
[532.26 - 535.04] you know I don't
[536.10 - 543.84] oh because empowerment
[539.70 - 547.50] is being able to also live in this world
[543.84 - 549.12] and actually do something about it
[547.50 - 551.46] when I know I'm doing the heavy metal
[549.12 - 554.88] detox smoothie
[551.46 - 557.10] and I know I'm doing the exposure shot
[554.88 - 558.66] if I happen to use a metal fork and I
[557.10 - 561.56] get a little steel
[558.66 - 561.56] rubbed off
[562.44 - 565.94] I know I'm doing something about it
[566.68 - 569.79] [Music]
[573.84 - 577.74] toxic heavy metals can be at our in our
[576.00 - 581.70] indoor ear
[577.74 - 584.94] or outdoor air check this out right air
[581.70 - 588.36] fresheners spew toxic heavy metals
[584.94 - 591.36] that's why I say we should pull them out
[588.36 - 594.72] of the plugs the walls throw them in the
[591.36 - 597.48] trash right air fresheners
[594.72 - 600.54] that you're spraying
[597.48 - 602.58] right let me spray the couch let me
[600.54 - 605.40] spray the chair let me spray the carpet
[602.58 - 606.84] the air fresheners right have toxic
[605.40 - 609.26] heavy metals in them so when you're
[606.84 - 612.18] breathing you're like
[609.26 - 614.05] ah wild flowers
[612.18 - 615.60] fake wildflowers
[614.05 - 619.38] [Music]
[615.60 - 621.92] that's that metal that's metal in there
[619.38 - 624.42] colognes and perfumes
[621.92 - 626.46] I like the smell of that
[624.42 - 628.56] oh man I don't like the smell clone or
[626.46 - 630.72] perfume but the smell of that cologne
[628.56 - 632.52] and perfume Nettles
[630.72 - 635.16] people need to know they need to be they
[632.52 - 637.02] need to be taught like that's metal your
[635.16 - 639.12] smell
[637.02 - 641.40] toxic heavy metals can be indoor or
[639.12 - 643.62] outdoor air especially if we're in the
[641.40 - 646.02] presence of toxic fragrances oh I said
[643.62 - 647.94] it in here I was ahead of myself scented
[646.02 - 649.02] candles that's another one scented
[647.94 - 651.78] candles
[649.02 - 654.84] people don't realize how much metal is
[651.78 - 656.46] spewing out of there yes in that
[654.84 - 658.92] fragrance that's blowing out of a
[656.46 - 661.02] scented candle that's burning out of a
[658.92 - 663.24] scented candle right
[661.02 - 665.22] then you got pesticides and then you got
[663.24 - 667.98] the
[665.22 - 671.04] Trails up in the sky
[667.98 - 673.32] we even annoyingly put toxic heavy
[671.04 - 675.36] metals directly into and onto our bodies
[673.32 - 678.06] with certain cosmetics
[675.36 - 682.08] Pharmaceuticals
[678.06 - 685.08] Beverages and other products right
[682.08 - 689.10] you know like this is well-known
[685.08 - 691.64] information and I will cite that this is
[689.10 - 694.26] not mine this piece of information
[691.64 - 695.76] meaning this is all my information from
[694.26 - 697.92] above right it's very compassions
[695.76 - 700.10] information but you know the Wizard of
[697.92 - 700.10] Oz
[700.20 - 706.08] the movie
[702.72 - 710.34] okay in the early 20th century
[706.08 - 712.62] and the Wicked Witch of the West I think
[710.34 - 716.34] had a green face
[712.62 - 718.98] okay and you can look this up out there
[716.34 - 722.94] it was a copper
[718.98 - 724.02] application that made her face green
[722.94 - 727.26] right
[724.02 - 731.34] so for that movie
[727.26 - 733.92] they did an application of copper on
[731.34 - 736.20] that actress's face
[733.92 - 739.56] and
[736.20 - 742.08] from what The Story Goes her face stayed
[739.56 - 745.56] green for her entire life
[742.08 - 747.48] from that copper right
[745.56 - 749.70] and when we think about that that's
[747.48 - 753.96] really highly toxic
[749.70 - 756.80] so it was a makeup made out of copper to
[753.96 - 756.80] make your face look green
[757.62 - 762.72] but when people don't realize is copper
[760.14 - 765.00] it's really industrial lies copper that
[762.72 - 766.38] same industrialized copper that was in
[765.00 - 768.78] her makeup
[766.38 - 771.72] to save copper that people use copper
[768.78 - 774.24] mugs and stuff out of
[771.72 - 776.88] the same industrialized copper
[774.24 - 779.10] that when you do copper utensils copper
[776.88 - 781.38] mugs copper jewelry right you don't want
[779.10 - 785.28] to play with copper
[781.38 - 786.60] and there's too much copper available to
[785.28 - 790.98] play with
[786.60 - 794.52] we are all high in Copper
[790.98 - 797.82] not only high in the trace mineral
[794.52 - 800.40] copper because it's the least
[797.82 - 801.72] deficient mineral on the planet in every
[800.40 - 804.84] single food
[801.72 - 808.46] so not only are we not deficient in
[804.84 - 811.20] Copper Trace mineral coppers but we're
[808.46 - 813.00] saturated and toxic industrialized
[811.20 - 816.12] copper
[813.00 - 818.40] we have not only do the humans on this
[816.12 - 821.28] planet have an abundance of Trace
[818.40 - 824.70] mineral copper in US
[821.28 - 827.28] from the earth we also have too much
[824.70 - 828.54] industrialized copper in US
[827.28 - 830.94] people don't know this that's medical
[828.54 - 832.62] medium information
[830.94 - 834.18] that's mm info I don't want to confuse
[832.62 - 836.52] that with the Wicked Witch of the West
[834.18 - 838.26] when she had the copper makeup that's
[836.52 - 839.88] not MediCal medium info when she had the
[838.26 - 842.30] copper makeup and all that that's known
[839.88 - 842.30] out there

[878.10 - 882.96] I mean I was all choked up
[880.86 - 885.60] um watching
[882.96 - 888.20] um Her speech about it all and it was it
[885.60 - 888.20] was incredible
[890.30 - 897.06] toxic heavy metals are everywhere
[895.08 - 898.56] we can apply it on our skin with
[897.06 - 900.84] cosmetics
[898.56 - 902.46] still in there it's still in cosmetics
[900.84 - 904.46] it's still in everything is what I was
[902.46 - 907.26] trying to say
[904.46 - 909.60] Pharmaceuticals Beverages and other
[907.26 - 911.76] products
[909.60 - 913.98] you'll find extensive details about
[911.76 - 916.14] toxic heavy metal exposure in this book
[913.98 - 917.76] I just read that right there
[916.14 - 921.12] we are getting toxic heavy metal
[917.76 - 922.98] exposure at a minuscule level on a
[921.12 - 925.86] continual basis
[922.98 - 928.74] so we get it every day on a continual
[925.86 - 930.66] basis so we are exposed
[928.74 - 933.84] it's not like we're drinking a gallon of
[930.66 - 936.18] leaded gasoline we're not doing that
[933.84 - 939.00] Mariah says Where can we find the real
[936.18 - 940.14] go to Medical mediums IG right on
[939.00 - 943.16] Instagram
[940.14 - 943.16] check out the reel
[948.36 - 952.50] we're getting these exposures repeatedly
[950.64 - 954.60] in our everyday lives a little bit here
[952.50 - 957.24] a little bit there you might look at a
[954.60 - 960.48] single exposure and think no big deal
[957.24 - 962.40] everybody looks at a single exposure if
[960.48 - 964.32] they're aware of that single exposure as
[962.40 - 966.06] if it's no big deal that's what we do we
[964.32 - 968.46] don't really
[966.06 - 970.44] understand it or we don't really care
[968.46 - 971.94] and we don't really see it as a big deal
[970.44 - 973.40] that's how it works with toxic heavy
[971.94 - 976.80] metals and that's how they get you
[973.40 - 979.32] that's how the evil doers on the planet
[976.80 - 981.42] get us too it's always these small
[979.32 - 983.52] amounts through say Pharmaceuticals or
[981.42 - 985.26] through some other Avenue or the food
[983.52 - 987.96] chemistry business or whatever it is
[985.26 - 990.24] industry out there like all of it we
[987.96 - 991.68] just get it little bit by little bit by
[990.24 - 996.36] a little bit
[991.68 - 998.36] Death By A Thousand Cuts its exposure by
[996.36 - 1002.48] a Thousand Cuts is what it is to
[998.36 - 1004.94] exposure by a Thousand Cuts
[1002.48 - 1008.00] you might look at a single exposure and
[1004.94 - 1010.16] think no big deal just like people will
[1008.00 - 1011.90] often think of a micro dose of
[1010.16 - 1013.10] psychedelic drugs huh we mentioned that
[1011.90 - 1014.66] in here pretty funny there's a micro
[1013.10 - 1015.92] dose chapter inside this book that'll
[1014.66 - 1018.92] blow your mind
[1015.92 - 1022.66] get it blow your mind
[1018.92 - 1022.66] no pun intended though
[1023.90 - 1028.58] so people think just like no big deal
[1026.54 - 1030.26] with a micro dose of psychedelic drugs
[1028.58 - 1031.76] is no big deal because of the trendy
[1030.26 - 1034.16] advice about everything in moderation
[1031.76 - 1036.98] we're getting poisoned with toxic heavy
[1034.16 - 1040.34] metals in moderation
[1036.98 - 1041.90] I'm in the brain saver book on page 24.
[1040.34 - 1044.86] right here
[1041.90 - 1044.86] Incredible Book
[1046.52 - 1050.66] we're getting poisoned with toxic heavy
[1048.20 - 1053.06] metals in moderation and that may not
[1050.66 - 1055.04] seem significant until you step back and
[1053.06 - 1057.74] look at the bigger picture repeated
[1055.04 - 1059.72] exposure adds up and if we don't do
[1057.74 - 1063.80] anything about it if we don't do
[1059.72 - 1065.90] anything about that repeated exposure it
[1063.80 - 1067.46] adds up adds up and then it bites Us in
[1065.90 - 1069.50] the butt
[1067.46 - 1071.78] at a certain point the toxic heavy
[1069.50 - 1076.24] metals in her brain and body accumulate
[1071.78 - 1076.24] they do they accumulate
[1077.00 - 1083.62] at a certain point
[1079.34 - 1083.62] inside her brain and her body
[1085.76 - 1092.18] until we reach a large poisoning at some
[1088.58 - 1094.64] point later on in life yes
[1092.18 - 1096.70] although we still won't know it's toxic
[1094.64 - 1099.44] heavy metal poisoning when you have
[1096.70 - 1103.18] depersonalization anxiety depression OCD
[1099.44 - 1103.18] bipolar schizophrenia
[1103.94 - 1108.62] memory problems
[1106.94 - 1110.90] focusing concentration issues
[1108.62 - 1113.60] Alzheimer's dementia
[1110.90 - 1115.40] will get older region expiration date
[1113.60 - 1117.20] where everything goes wrong from
[1115.40 - 1118.64] collecting so many toxic heavy metals
[1117.20 - 1123.88] inside our brain and we'll never know
[1118.64 - 1123.88] what did it we hit our expiration date
[1124.22 - 1128.78] we have an expiration date
[1127.58 - 1130.76] we do
[1128.78 - 1132.26] we do
[1130.76 - 1135.32] and
[1132.26 - 1136.88] it's Death By A Thousand Cuts here on
[1135.32 - 1139.58] planet Earth
[1136.88 - 1141.98] and planet earth has a lot of Darkness
[1139.58 - 1143.96] on it so there's also death by one cut
[1141.98 - 1146.36] too on planet Earth
[1143.96 - 1148.40] by evil people and evil doers but death
[1146.36 - 1150.38] by a Thousand Cuts
[1148.40 - 1151.88] even as someone who lives in a bubble
[1150.38 - 1154.04] and they don't know really what's going
[1151.88 - 1156.20] on and they don't have too many worries
[1154.04 - 1157.58] in the world or they have a lot of money
[1156.20 - 1159.38] or whatever it is and they're just doing
[1157.58 - 1162.14] their thing every day they're still
[1159.38 - 1165.50] getting a death by a Thousand Cuts
[1162.14 - 1168.50] everybody is here on planet Earth
[1165.50 - 1170.36] Nicholas Russell years before my
[1168.50 - 1173.12] grandmother's death the last time I saw
[1170.36 - 1176.78] her she had no idea who I was and
[1173.12 - 1180.32] wouldn't even look at me damned medals
[1176.78 - 1182.24] truly I mean the mm info about Metals
[1180.32 - 1183.32] creating dementia and Alzheimer's out
[1182.24 - 1186.86] there in the world's powerful
[1183.32 - 1188.90] information because at least we know and
[1186.86 - 1190.76] we can do something about it for the
[1188.90 - 1192.44] future we can do something about it for
[1190.76 - 1194.96] the future
[1192.44 - 1198.02] because you know now so
[1194.96 - 1200.00] that's how it works we have to somehow
[1198.02 - 1201.80] get enough people to know and I feel
[1200.00 - 1204.14] terrible for so many people that may not
[1201.80 - 1206.56] have known through the years I've seen a
[1204.14 - 1209.18] lot of people have so many difficulties
[1206.56 - 1211.52] Tracy says what's the target audience
[1209.18 - 1213.74] for this book
[1211.52 - 1216.08] the target audience
[1213.74 - 1218.12] I mean the books are made for the
[1216.08 - 1220.88] chronically ill for people who have been
[1218.12 - 1221.96] through hell and back people who are
[1220.88 - 1223.76] also
[1221.96 - 1226.76] they've been sick for 10 years they've
[1223.76 - 1229.10] been sick for 20 years people who
[1226.76 - 1231.08] have seen it all done everything 10
[1229.10 - 1232.76] doctors 20 doctors Specialists
[1231.08 - 1235.22] neurologists everything
[1232.76 - 1237.62] the brain saver books are incredible
[1235.22 - 1239.12] books
[1237.62 - 1240.86] I guess if you want to use the term
[1239.12 - 1243.80] target audience I've never used that
[1240.86 - 1246.40] term but if you want to use that term
[1243.80 - 1249.20] that you were mentioning I would say
[1246.40 - 1252.20] it's for people
[1249.20 - 1255.86] who have been through enough seen enough
[1252.20 - 1257.54] and they they need the answers
[1255.86 - 1259.70] and
[1257.54 - 1262.58] honestly it's for anybody of course
[1259.70 - 1264.62] who's sick but
[1262.58 - 1266.24] like we've talked about before spirit
[1264.62 - 1268.28] and I
[1266.24 - 1269.78] if you first get sick chances are you're
[1268.28 - 1271.58] not going to grab a medical medium book
[1269.78 - 1272.90] you're going to go to a doctor then to
[1271.58 - 1273.86] another doctor I want people to go to
[1272.90 - 1275.72] their doctors
[1273.86 - 1277.28] but before they grab a medical medium
[1275.72 - 1278.90] book and bring it to their doctor that's
[1277.28 - 1281.06] going to be a while so people have to go
[1278.90 - 1282.98] on the Merry-Go-Round they have to try
[1281.06 - 1286.58] every Trend and everything from coffee
[1282.98 - 1287.78] enemas to sodium bicarbonate poisoning
[1286.58 - 1290.06] too
[1287.78 - 1292.22] alkaline National Water machines which
[1290.06 - 1293.96] only create more heavy metal toxicity to
[1292.22 - 1297.44] everything they have to go through all
[1293.96 - 1299.30] that and then microbiome tests and they
[1297.44 - 1301.58] have to do fecal matter transplants
[1299.30 - 1303.26] implants and they have to do all that
[1301.58 - 1305.96] before they find the medical medium
[1303.26 - 1307.70] books they have to do all that and then
[1305.96 - 1309.44] some and they're still having their
[1307.70 - 1311.78] neurological symptoms and finally they
[1309.44 - 1313.58] say you know what
[1311.78 - 1316.78] I'm just going to try one of those
[1313.58 - 1316.78] medical medium books
[1318.16 - 1322.54] I could talk about that all day
[1323.36 - 1328.52] singing sweetly says a decade ago I had
[1326.42 - 1330.74] amalgam fillings taken out and I
[1328.52 - 1333.08] remember having such a bad emotional
[1330.74 - 1334.64] experience for months after that and had
[1333.08 - 1338.86] no clue what happened
[1334.64 - 1338.86] from the Mercury outcasting
[1339.62 - 1342.40] see
[1342.92 - 1347.90] um kalasha says it is okay to drink
[1345.08 - 1350.36] heavy metal is it okay to drink heavy
[1347.90 - 1352.94] metal detox smoothie
[1350.36 - 1355.12] if we have an amalgam filling in our
[1352.94 - 1355.12] mouth
[1355.16 - 1361.04] I'm wanting to have mine removed but not
[1357.98 - 1364.10] sure if I can start this movie first
[1361.04 - 1365.54] or I should wait till it's out I have
[1364.10 - 1367.64] doctors ask me that question all the
[1365.54 - 1370.22] time and I recently told a physician who
[1367.64 - 1373.58] was asking me that for himself and for a
[1370.22 - 1374.66] patient of his and I said to him that it
[1373.58 - 1377.84] was fine
[1374.66 - 1380.18] absolutely in fact
[1377.84 - 1381.92] um I have family members that have
[1380.18 - 1385.76] amalgam fillings from
[1381.92 - 1387.74] 100 years ago whatever and they do the
[1385.76 - 1389.24] heavy metal detox smoothie every single
[1387.74 - 1391.28] day ask what's right for you ask your
[1389.24 - 1394.40] doctor what's right for you
[1391.28 - 1396.32] um but I do
[1394.40 - 1399.08] um I did talk to a doctor recently about
[1396.32 - 1401.36] his amalgam filling and his patience
[1399.08 - 1404.18] amalgam filling and they're on the heavy
[1401.36 - 1406.88] metal detox movie because what what it's
[1404.18 - 1408.74] doing is it's Gathering any metal that's
[1406.88 - 1411.14] being released from your amalgam
[1408.74 - 1414.92] fillings every single day that's that's
[1411.14 - 1417.02] recent exposure so what we're doing here
[1414.92 - 1419.60] is we're talking about the toxic heavy
[1417.02 - 1421.82] metal exposure shot right now right
[1419.60 - 1424.88] but that's like recent exposure because
[1421.82 - 1427.64] when Mercury is leaching from amalgams
[1424.88 - 1430.22] it's its recent exposure every day a
[1427.64 - 1431.90] little bit every day right
[1430.22 - 1433.10] but that's the same thing with tattoos
[1431.90 - 1434.78] there's Mercury and Tattoos there's
[1433.10 - 1437.72] toxic heavy metals and Tattoos so that's
[1434.78 - 1439.88] that's everyday recent exposure
[1437.72 - 1441.68] and that's what I like the exposure shot
[1439.88 - 1444.02] too so but the heavy metal detox
[1441.68 - 1446.54] smoothie I recommend for family and
[1444.02 - 1448.46] friends that have amalgam fillings
[1446.54 - 1450.08] regardless yeah
[1448.46 - 1452.42] but ask your doctor what's right for you
[1450.08 - 1453.50] I have recommendations in the book of
[1452.42 - 1456.38] how
[1453.50 - 1458.06] not to just take out all your amalgam
[1456.38 - 1462.44] fillings at once
[1458.06 - 1465.38] I talk about information about how to
[1462.44 - 1467.42] you know like what would be
[1465.38 - 1468.74] a good way of getting amalgam fillings
[1467.42 - 1470.90] out of your mouth so I do have
[1468.74 - 1471.86] information in here too like I talk
[1470.90 - 1476.12] about
[1471.86 - 1478.52] if it's broken or falling apart
[1476.12 - 1481.94] right that's a great time to get it done
[1478.52 - 1483.50] you know I talk about that but I I also
[1481.94 - 1485.18] talk about if someone has a whole bunch
[1483.50 - 1487.46] of amalgam fillings in their mouth and
[1485.18 - 1489.26] they're not causing like the tooth is
[1487.46 - 1491.26] still okay the Magnum filling is still
[1489.26 - 1493.94] okay
[1491.26 - 1496.82] that I tend to tell family and friends
[1493.94 - 1498.62] you know you leave them in but if they
[1496.82 - 1500.78] do want them out if someone does want
[1498.62 - 1503.00] one out
[1500.78 - 1505.64] I tell family and friends
[1503.00 - 1507.98] don't take them all out at once
[1505.64 - 1510.68] on the same day
[1507.98 - 1515.32] you know I've seen people get like 12
[1510.68 - 1519.64] out or 20 out in one day
[1515.32 - 1522.74] and that's medical meme information
[1519.64 - 1524.96] SOC has recommended not to get
[1522.74 - 1528.52] 20 out in one day so that but it's in
[1524.96 - 1528.52] the books that information in detail
[1529.70 - 1533.72] okay
[1532.04 - 1537.22] so let's keep on reading a little bit
[1533.72 - 1539.96] this is powerful information I'm excited
[1537.22 - 1542.48] let's move on a little bit to the next
[1539.96 - 1544.28] part I was going to read which I'm going
[1542.48 - 1545.96] to look for now

[1603.44 - 1607.76] be I'm not even being sarcastic at all
[1605.30 - 1611.60] on any level people have ink
[1607.76 - 1612.62] so many people have ink okay and
[1611.60 - 1614.72] um
[1612.62 - 1616.88] I'm just telling you that if people have
[1614.72 - 1618.56] ink that's what they got all right
[1616.88 - 1620.62] totally understand but I want to talk
[1618.56 - 1622.94] about it for a little bit for a minute
[1620.62 - 1624.86] tattoos are a source of toxic heavy
[1622.94 - 1627.32] metal exposure now before I go any
[1624.86 - 1628.22] further I'm sure a few of you might be
[1627.32 - 1629.78] like
[1628.22 - 1631.58] that's
[1629.78 - 1636.50] because medical meme doesn't understand
[1631.58 - 1638.54] I get cruelty free ink vegan ink and
[1636.50 - 1642.56] it's cruelty free
[1638.54 - 1645.26] and my you know tattoo guy tells me
[1642.56 - 1648.14] there's no Metals in it
[1645.26 - 1650.72] that's
[1648.14 - 1653.24] that's
[1650.72 - 1654.68] ink has to have metal in it or it's not
[1653.24 - 1656.78] going to show itself through your skin
[1654.68 - 1660.14] when the sunlight or light from your
[1656.78 - 1662.36] house or light from your room hits it
[1660.14 - 1665.42] it has Metals in it
[1662.36 - 1666.68] that's what causes it to pop and reflect
[1665.42 - 1669.26] light
[1666.68 - 1671.36] Through Your Skin if tattoo ink didn't
[1669.26 - 1674.12] have Metals in it
[1671.36 - 1676.46] you would wouldn't be able to see the
[1674.12 - 1680.24] details of your tattoos
[1676.46 - 1684.86] that's why as your tattoos age
[1680.24 - 1688.16] as years go on the metal is aging and
[1684.86 - 1691.52] leaving the skin that's why tattoos fade
[1688.16 - 1693.32] as you get older the reason why your
[1691.52 - 1696.14] tattoo doesn't pop
[1693.32 - 1698.68] when you got you got your tattoo at 20
[1696.14 - 1698.68] years old
[1698.72 - 1703.94] popping meaning it pops you see it
[1702.08 - 1706.22] because of
[1703.94 - 1710.12] of toxic heavy metals
[1706.22 - 1713.30] but then when you're 50 years old
[1710.12 - 1715.52] or 60 years old it doesn't pop anymore
[1713.30 - 1717.56] it fades right
[1715.52 - 1719.24] it's fading because so much of the metal
[1717.56 - 1721.52] is leaving
[1719.24 - 1723.82] the skin and it's been going into your
[1721.52 - 1725.84] bloodstream for 50 years 40 years
[1723.82 - 1727.88] Macaulay says remember when you made
[1725.84 - 1731.24] that video with a big tattoo on your arm
[1727.88 - 1733.46] yeah I do yeah
[1731.24 - 1734.36] there's a whole bunch of tattoos on my
[1733.46 - 1736.40] arm
[1734.36 - 1738.26] I do remember Uma
[1736.40 - 1739.34] thank you for reminding me that's pretty
[1738.26 - 1742.04] funny
[1739.34 - 1745.40] it is I put info about toxic heavy
[1742.04 - 1747.50] metals in all ink and now science is
[1745.40 - 1749.30] trying to write it write about it and
[1747.50 - 1751.64] you'll see articles being put out now
[1749.30 - 1756.76] even saying organic ink
[1751.64 - 1756.76] 2 has Metals in it so by the way
[1756.98 - 1762.98] the
[1758.42 - 1766.10] metal free ink Theory
[1762.98 - 1768.86] okay that was out there
[1766.10 - 1771.68] right first of all the awareness that I
[1768.86 - 1775.16] put out there about ink having metals
[1771.68 - 1777.74] alarmed the tattoo ink world
[1775.16 - 1779.84] right so the tattoo ink world started
[1777.74 - 1781.82] shifting gears and they started moving
[1779.84 - 1784.76] they started moving to cruelty free
[1781.82 - 1786.92] tattoo ink which is
[1784.76 - 1788.66] um which is a different type of vegan
[1786.92 - 1790.46] ink and all that right all these
[1788.66 - 1791.66] different ones and they moved to that
[1790.46 - 1793.04] and they're like well this these are
[1791.66 - 1794.36] better inks these are better inks then
[1793.04 - 1796.34] everybody's like what do they have metal
[1794.36 - 1798.32] in it oh no these don't have that they
[1796.34 - 1800.96] all have metal in it right
[1798.32 - 1805.16] but I got I got a lot of
[1800.96 - 1806.18] for blowing that one up I got over the
[1805.16 - 1809.00] years
[1806.18 - 1811.52] telling that info that piece of
[1809.00 - 1813.86] information messaging out about how ink
[1811.52 - 1816.32] has metal right it caused a lot of
[1813.86 - 1818.84] problems and then
[1816.32 - 1821.90] all the people who got Inc
[1818.84 - 1825.74] from so-called better sources
[1821.90 - 1828.08] were upset because it was a better ink
[1825.74 - 1830.60] quality but still had battle in it and
[1828.08 - 1832.88] then they felt tricked and jaded so then
[1830.60 - 1835.04] I got a lot of for that because
[1832.88 - 1836.54] there's a whole bunch of people a whole
[1835.04 - 1840.44] bunch of vegans
[1836.54 - 1843.02] and you know and keto animal protein
[1840.44 - 1844.82] people who got ink
[1843.02 - 1847.88] and then when the word got out that
[1844.82 - 1851.24] their cruelty free ink still has metal
[1847.88 - 1854.12] in it I got a lot of again
[1851.24 - 1855.56] see so people have no idea how much crap
[1854.12 - 1858.32] I get
[1855.56 - 1859.94] Jason P says so a tattoo would be
[1858.32 - 1861.74] invisible without Metals no not
[1859.94 - 1864.98] invisible but that's a good point Not
[1861.74 - 1866.84] Invisible it just wouldn't pop and the
[1864.98 - 1869.24] detail wouldn't be there
[1866.84 - 1871.88] the detail
[1869.24 - 1873.44] and it would fade really quick fade
[1871.88 - 1875.72] really quick like say you're 20 years
[1873.44 - 1877.76] old see Jason say you're 22 years old
[1875.72 - 1879.44] whatever 25 years old maybe you're 30
[1877.76 - 1883.16] whatever say you're 30.
[1879.44 - 1885.44] and you get a brand new tattoo
[1883.16 - 1887.54] if there wasn't metal in it
[1885.44 - 1890.72] it would fade really quick it would fade
[1887.54 - 1893.60] in weeks and in months a couple years
[1890.72 - 1896.30] you just have to be fading
[1893.60 - 1899.06] but the reason why metal is in all
[1896.30 - 1904.06] tattoo ink is so that that reflection
[1899.06 - 1904.06] occurs metal reflects light
[1905.32 - 1912.98] so you can't just put metal free ink in
[1908.90 - 1915.20] your on your neck your face your hands
[1912.98 - 1917.06] you know I know a lot of people get ink
[1915.20 - 1918.62] on their their Knuckles and stuff they
[1917.06 - 1921.04] get them on their fingers their Knuckles
[1918.62 - 1921.04] right
[1921.56 - 1926.84] they wouldn't be invisible then it just
[1923.66 - 1928.76] would fade quick and it wouldn't pop
[1926.84 - 1930.32] Erica Malek says if someone gets their
[1928.76 - 1931.88] tattoos removed are they protecting
[1930.32 - 1934.46] themselves from further especially my
[1931.88 - 1936.94] recommendation is don't get tattoos
[1934.46 - 1936.94] removed
[1937.10 - 1942.32] unless you hate the tattoo that much and
[1939.62 - 1945.32] you're somebody that like you know Ben
[1942.32 - 1947.72] loves Jessica
[1945.32 - 1949.52] and you know you guys break up and all
[1947.72 - 1951.74] of a sudden somebody's so upset like
[1949.52 - 1954.02] Ben's so upset he can't take it anymore
[1951.74 - 1956.18] and he's got two choices he can tattoo
[1954.02 - 1958.40] over Ben loves Jessica
[1956.18 - 1961.34] he can tattoo over that
[1958.40 - 1964.40] or he can remove it
[1961.34 - 1968.54] that's up to him you know but the late
[1964.40 - 1969.98] the laser removal of removing toxic
[1968.54 - 1972.02] heavy metals
[1969.98 - 1974.18] from your being removing your your
[1972.02 - 1976.58] tattoo sorry the laser removal of
[1974.18 - 1979.04] removing your tattoo can make the tattoo
[1976.58 - 1982.16] Leach fast
[1979.04 - 1984.44] the Laser's not getting rid of the metal
[1982.16 - 1986.24] is pushing it into your bloodstream
[1984.44 - 1989.54] that's why
[1986.24 - 1991.94] a friend of mine had like removal laser
[1989.54 - 1994.28] removal of a tattoo
[1991.94 - 1996.34] he was so sick and he's like why the
[1994.28 - 1999.44] hell am I so sick and I'm like because
[1996.34 - 2002.80] you just got all that metal dumped into
[1999.44 - 2006.40] your bloodstream fast that stuff's going
[2002.80 - 2007.72] to your brain going to your liver
[2006.40 - 2010.36] so
[2007.72 - 2011.62] like right now tattoos are in big time
[2010.36 - 2014.86] right
[2011.62 - 2015.82] it's not just for like the Navy and the
[2014.86 - 2017.56] army
[2015.82 - 2020.62] in the Air Force
[2017.56 - 2022.72] the tattoos aren't just for bikers right
[2020.62 - 2024.28] they're not just for bikers anymore
[2022.72 - 2026.62] they're for like football players
[2024.28 - 2028.12] they're for like you know they're for
[2026.62 - 2029.44] basketball players football players
[2028.12 - 2030.76] they're for soccer players like
[2029.44 - 2033.16] everybody's Inked Up they're for
[2030.76 - 2035.86] everybody right
[2033.16 - 2039.04] so but what I see when I see everybody
[2035.86 - 2041.08] getting that much ink I'm like holy crap
[2039.04 - 2043.06] and everybody's got a sleeve
[2041.08 - 2044.44] all the football players have sleeves
[2043.06 - 2046.42] I'm like dude
[2044.44 - 2047.62] if you don't learn about how to get
[2046.42 - 2049.48] medals out of your bloodstream
[2047.62 - 2051.40] throughout your life that stuff is going
[2049.48 - 2052.90] to go to the brain
[2051.40 - 2054.76] and yours is going to be you know
[2052.90 - 2057.82] dealing with Alzheimer's
[2054.76 - 2059.86] I see all the NBA and all like NFL and
[2057.82 - 2062.14] everybody and they're just Inked Up from
[2059.86 - 2064.48] their arms are Inked Up they're Inked Up
[2062.14 - 2067.66] in the whole body I'm like what
[2064.48 - 2069.58] it's like oh man sure you're in shape
[2067.66 - 2072.34] now you're working out you're an athlete
[2069.58 - 2074.26] pro athlete but down the road you gotta
[2072.34 - 2076.48] get the medals out
[2074.26 - 2080.02] medical medium I just want to say this
[2076.48 - 2082.66] medical medium is not common sense
[2080.02 - 2085.12] because there's nothing common about it
[2082.66 - 2086.74] it's mind-blowing information that sets
[2085.12 - 2088.24] the stage for the frontier of all
[2086.74 - 2089.86] alternative medicine at this point for
[2088.24 - 2092.38] the most part
[2089.86 - 2094.66] it sets the stage for information out
[2092.38 - 2099.88] there because it makes sense
[2094.66 - 2101.86] so mm info is not common sense mm info
[2099.88 - 2106.12] just makes sense there's a difference
[2101.86 - 2108.22] right there it's like whoa that
[2106.12 - 2111.88] makes sense right like that kind of
[2108.22 - 2114.88] thing like whoa
[2111.88 - 2116.50] I've been swearing a lot ever since I
[2114.88 - 2119.26] did
[2116.50 - 2120.88] the Sarah Foster and Aaron Foster
[2119.26 - 2122.44] podcast
[2120.88 - 2125.14] episode
[2122.44 - 2127.30] they were swearing they got me swearing
[2125.14 - 2129.72] and then swearing a little more because
[2127.30 - 2129.72] of it
[2130.54 - 2134.74] I have to let them know anyway
[2133.18 - 2136.30] Health with Liz is laughing right now
[2134.74 - 2137.86] look the point is what I'm trying to say
[2136.30 - 2139.96] I'm not done with tattoo talk though you
[2137.86 - 2141.22] guys I got tattoo talk if you're not
[2139.96 - 2142.66] interested it's okay hang out we're
[2141.22 - 2144.70] doing the shot exposure shot because
[2142.66 - 2146.68] you've probably got metal exposure from
[2144.70 - 2148.90] doing all kinds of other stuff
[2146.68 - 2150.94] it just makes sense the medical medium
[2148.90 - 2153.40] information it's not common sense it
[2150.94 - 2156.10] doesn't contradict itself and only puts
[2153.40 - 2157.36] all the details together and builds upon
[2156.10 - 2159.88] itself
[2157.36 - 2162.40] the laser removal
[2159.88 - 2165.06] for ink so you can get rid of your
[2162.40 - 2168.28] tattoo pushes the metal
[2165.06 - 2172.50] a laser going over your skin cannot take
[2168.28 - 2172.50] the metal out of your body magically
[2173.92 - 2177.88] you know whatever that laser whatever
[2175.72 - 2179.56] that tattoo is I know a lot of people
[2177.88 - 2181.48] have words written on their ribs and
[2179.56 - 2183.40] stuff it's like like that that scripture
[2181.48 - 2185.32] like a big thing with tattoos is
[2183.40 - 2187.18] scripture it's like a whole sentence
[2185.32 - 2189.88] going across the ribs the whole sentence
[2187.18 - 2191.26] going across their back right we I
[2189.88 - 2193.24] noticed that a lot of guys and girls
[2191.26 - 2195.16] they're getting like they're getting
[2193.24 - 2197.44] um they're getting words of wisdom from
[2195.16 - 2199.48] somewhere like a quote or something from
[2197.44 - 2202.30] somewhere and they have it written over
[2199.48 - 2204.96] here on their forearms maybe they have
[2202.30 - 2204.96] something like
[2205.60 - 2209.46] you know some cool quote right
[2209.56 - 2212.62] not making fun of it I'm just saying
[2211.24 - 2214.24] that that's how much ink is out there
[2212.62 - 2215.92] it's that many people have ink it's
[2214.24 - 2218.20] people you don't even expect to have ink
[2215.92 - 2220.96] and they got tattoos everywhere
[2218.20 - 2223.24] it's okay to have a tattoo
[2220.96 - 2227.02] but I think knowing
[2223.24 - 2228.70] more about it is also really okay think
[2227.02 - 2230.56] about that
[2228.70 - 2231.58] so
[2230.56 - 2232.84] um
[2231.58 - 2234.94] yeah
[2232.84 - 2237.16] helpful as words of wisdom right people
[2234.94 - 2240.52] have the scripture on them whatever kind
[2237.16 - 2243.16] of like you see it I saw somebody like I
[2240.52 - 2244.78] saw somebody pretty recently right on
[2243.16 - 2247.36] social media and they had like a
[2244.78 - 2249.04] paragraph written on their chest it was
[2247.36 - 2250.26] like a paragraph and it was written all
[2249.04 - 2252.58] like nice
[2250.26 - 2255.16] I was like
[2252.58 - 2256.90] that's fine you can get a paragraph
[2255.16 - 2258.04] written on your chest or your back or
[2256.90 - 2261.64] something but
[2258.04 - 2263.92] what's going on is this so back to Jason
[2261.64 - 2266.26] you said that would the ink just
[2263.92 - 2268.90] disappear be invisible that's what it
[2266.26 - 2270.58] was be invisible if the metal wasn't in
[2268.90 - 2272.68] there no it wouldn't be invisible it
[2270.58 - 2275.86] would just be blotchy
[2272.68 - 2278.46] and fade it looking
[2275.86 - 2283.00] early on
[2278.46 - 2286.20] especially later on like turn to crap
[2283.00 - 2286.20] that's what it would be
[2287.86 - 2293.22] so tattoos
[2290.74 - 2297.76] okay for example okay
[2293.22 - 2301.42] historically check this out
[2297.76 - 2304.08] right indigenous cultures using tattoo
[2301.42 - 2304.08] ink
[2304.90 - 2310.84] right handmade batches
[2308.02 - 2312.40] and then they would take a sharp
[2310.84 - 2314.08] Sharp
[2312.40 - 2316.84] Hardwood
[2314.08 - 2319.06] pencil and they would Pierce her skin
[2316.84 - 2321.52] with the ink
[2319.06 - 2323.86] to make tattoos
[2321.52 - 2326.26] right
[2323.86 - 2327.52] people don't realize the mixture they
[2326.26 - 2330.70] used
[2327.52 - 2335.02] were deposits of metals
[2330.70 - 2336.94] that they mind their self and ORD their
[2335.02 - 2338.56] self
[2336.94 - 2341.92] okay
[2338.56 - 2344.38] so indigenous cultures that you that
[2341.92 - 2347.28] made tattoos
[2344.38 - 2347.28] going back
[2347.86 - 2352.86] would unearth deposits of minerals
[2353.50 - 2356.94] and they would crush it
[2357.58 - 2362.98] with anthocyanins
[2360.28 - 2365.38] right color
[2362.98 - 2368.62] that they would get from plants
[2365.38 - 2370.30] then they would but but it was metal it
[2368.62 - 2371.92] was all metal
[2370.30 - 2374.20] and they would
[2371.92 - 2376.30] push it into their skin and then when
[2374.20 - 2378.96] the wound would heal
[2376.30 - 2382.90] you would see your tattoo clear as day
[2378.96 - 2385.44] Sun hits it clear as day boo now in
[2382.90 - 2385.44] modern day
[2385.48 - 2390.04] it's manufactured
[2388.30 - 2392.68] by the industry
[2390.04 - 2396.48] and metal has to be in it
[2392.68 - 2396.48] in order to make it pop
[2396.64 - 2403.84] am I driving you guys crazy today
[2399.70 - 2406.24] I'm driving myself crazy today all right
[2403.84 - 2408.52] on IG laugh out loud I have a ton of

[2430.42 - 2433.78] that what I'm saying is it's okay to get
[2432.10 - 2435.70] tattoos if somebody wants tattoos that's
[2433.78 - 2437.62] not it it's just that it's constant
[2435.70 - 2440.32] exposure to mental so when we do things
[2437.62 - 2442.18] to take cheer of ourselves and today
[2440.32 - 2444.46] today is all about
[2442.18 - 2446.56] the brainchild therapy and it's all
[2444.46 - 2450.48] about the toxic heavy metal exposure
[2446.56 - 2450.48] shot so that's what it's about today
[2451.80 - 2456.34] Lisa loft house
[2454.30 - 2459.22] on YouTube
[2456.34 - 2461.50] I do hair explanation points heavy metal
[2459.22 - 2463.42] exposure every day explanation point so
[2461.50 - 2466.78] thankful to have heavy metal detox
[2463.42 - 2468.88] smoothie and Lisa I don't want you to
[2466.78 - 2471.04] quit your job
[2468.88 - 2472.00] I'm not telling you you have to quit
[2471.04 - 2474.28] your job
[2472.00 - 2476.14] exactly you're doing the heavy metal
[2474.28 - 2479.80] detox smoothie every day you're grabbing
[2476.14 - 2481.60] on to that exposure every day Natasha
[2479.80 - 2484.30] gray medical medium info is the only
[2481.60 - 2485.68] information that makes complete sense
[2484.30 - 2488.20] amen
[2485.68 - 2491.38] amen
[2488.20 - 2494.32] I tell Spirit of compassion all the time
[2491.38 - 2497.76] why do you make so much sense
[2494.32 - 2497.76] all the time
[2499.06 - 2505.00] okay so let's read a little bit about
[2501.64 - 2506.68] tattoos oh tattoos tattoos the teaser a
[2505.00 - 2509.20] source of toxic heavy metal exposure the
[2506.68 - 2511.18] ink from a tattoo is basically On A Time
[2509.20 - 2512.92] release you know time release right time
[2511.18 - 2515.08] release
[2512.92 - 2517.96] ink
[2515.08 - 2521.10] Is On A Time release inside of us
[2517.96 - 2525.90] leaching metal slowly from the Derma
[2521.10 - 2525.90] into the bloodstream over a lifetime
[2526.00 - 2532.38] from the bloodstream those toxic heavy
[2528.34 - 2532.38] metals find their way to the brain
[2532.60 - 2537.94] so when we get ink on our body
[2535.78 - 2542.10] slowly it's just going to the brain
[2537.94 - 2542.10] every day for the rest of her life
[2542.92 - 2546.34] from the bloodstream those toxic Metals
[2545.02 - 2548.50] find their way to the brain where they
[2546.34 - 2551.86] end up residing in brain tissue
[2548.50 - 2554.08] as of today there are no sources of
[2551.86 - 2557.44] tattooing that are free of toxic heavy
[2554.08 - 2560.02] metals I repeat
[2557.44 - 2562.36] so every time when somebody like throws
[2560.02 - 2565.12] it at me and they have I mean honestly
[2562.36 - 2567.58] if we weren't so shadowed
[2565.12 - 2569.50] and we were open to like whatever it
[2567.58 - 2573.04] just anybody just pop it on whatever
[2569.50 - 2575.26] that's browsing through um IG or
[2573.04 - 2579.10] whatever we weren't so shadowed
[2575.26 - 2582.22] oh my God people would be so peed off
[2579.10 - 2586.00] right now with me talking about there's
[2582.22 - 2588.94] no heavy metal free ink there are so
[2586.00 - 2591.22] many like hipsters going to their like
[2588.94 - 2594.04] tattoo people too and they're being told
[2591.22 - 2595.96] there's no metal it's cruelty free blah
[2594.04 - 2597.82] blah blah and they're just they just
[2595.96 - 2600.34] don't know
[2597.82 - 2602.50] so as of today there are no sources of
[2600.34 - 2604.78] tattooing that are free of toxic heavy
[2602.50 - 2606.88] metals not even tattoo inks that are
[2604.78 - 2609.58] vegan and cruelty free
[2606.88 - 2612.28] in order for tattoo ink to be seen
[2609.58 - 2616.20] clearly through the skin they're half
[2612.28 - 2620.44] there have to be metals
[2616.20 - 2622.60] inside the tattoo ink as light hits your
[2620.44 - 2625.24] skin from the Sun or any source of light
[2622.60 - 2628.12] it reflects off the metal
[2625.24 - 2630.94] inside the tattoo ink under the skin
[2628.12 - 2633.34] that reflection allows a tattoo to pop
[2630.94 - 2635.56] and be seen clearly
[2633.34 - 2638.50] why am I yelling
[2635.56 - 2640.24] as the years go by and Tattoos toxic
[2638.50 - 2642.70] heavy metals are Time released deeper
[2640.24 - 2645.28] into your bloodstream tattoos fade
[2642.70 - 2647.56] the light reflecting off your body ink
[2645.28 - 2649.42] doesn't have as much to reflect off of
[2647.56 - 2651.82] anymore that's why it fades throughout
[2649.42 - 2655.42] the years toxic heavy metals within the
[2651.82 - 2657.90] ink were what gave the tattoos their
[2655.42 - 2657.90] clarity
[2659.62 - 2663.22] here's a cool paragraph right here I
[2661.66 - 2666.04] hope this makes you feel better
[2663.22 - 2668.68] if you already have tattoos
[2666.04 - 2671.92] you don't have to remove them
[2668.68 - 2674.38] please do not worry and think you have
[2671.92 - 2676.96] to get all your ink removed do not do
[2674.38 - 2679.12] that in my opinion in my personal
[2676.96 - 2683.68] opinion I would recommend against that
[2679.12 - 2685.72] unless you have some tattoo that says
[2683.68 - 2687.58] something on it that you just don't want
[2685.72 - 2689.56] anymore so badly and you already planned
[2687.58 - 2691.66] on removing it and that's your life and
[2689.56 - 2694.42] that's your body and whatever but I mean
[2691.66 - 2697.66] I'm not saying you have to do anything
[2694.42 - 2699.78] Rhonda says louder for the people in the
[2697.66 - 2699.78] back
[2700.90 - 2705.10] that's really funny if you already have
[2703.30 - 2706.60] tattoos you don't have to remove them
[2705.10 - 2708.64] instead make sure you're following
[2706.60 - 2710.92] medical medium protocols to stop up and
[2708.64 - 2713.14] expel the metals as their Time released
[2710.92 - 2716.32] into your bloodstream so the metals
[2713.14 - 2717.76] don't build up in your brain
[2716.32 - 2719.56] ask your doctor what's right for you
[2717.76 - 2720.70] take the book to hit your doctor him or
[2719.56 - 2723.04] her
[2720.70 - 2726.78] Julie is the light says why does the Sun
[2723.04 - 2726.78] make mine fade
[2727.48 - 2733.42] the sun doesn't make a tattoo fade
[2731.44 - 2736.68] the Sun
[2733.42 - 2736.68] Tans the skin
[2737.14 - 2741.88] so
[2738.46 - 2744.28] and the tanning of the skin can make it
[2741.88 - 2746.44] seem like the Tattoo's fading if you get
[2744.28 - 2747.88] no sun whatsoever
[2746.44 - 2751.60] at all
[2747.88 - 2753.52] the tattoo won't be faded if you had the
[2751.60 - 2755.14] tattoo for a very long time it's
[2753.52 - 2758.38] naturally fading
[2755.14 - 2760.54] because the metals are leaving the ink
[2758.38 - 2762.82] if you choose to remove a tattoo because
[2760.54 - 2764.44] you don't like your tattoo anymore the
[2762.82 - 2766.84] procedure could release more metal into
[2764.44 - 2769.42] your bloodstream faster
[2766.84 - 2772.12] so following the heavy metal detox guide
[2769.42 - 2774.64] guidance from chapter 44 and 45 will be
[2772.12 - 2778.50] wise then two after you consult your
[2774.64 - 2778.50] doctor on what's right for you
[2785.44 - 2788.86] so we we've read some cool metal stuff
[2787.48 - 2791.32] you guys there's so much information
[2788.86 - 2795.10] about toxic heavy metal exposure in
[2791.32 - 2796.72] these brain books it's it's incredible
[2795.10 - 2798.70] really how much is in here I'm just
[2796.72 - 2802.50] scratching tattoos for God's sake I'm
[2798.70 - 2802.50] just scratching tattoos
[2805.12 - 2808.66] that's all I'm doing
[2806.98 - 2810.96] I'm not even like there's so much
[2808.66 - 2810.96] information
[2811.18 - 2815.62] I got like information in here about
[2813.28 - 2816.76] vaporized heavy metals that's
[2815.62 - 2819.16] interesting
[2816.76 - 2822.16] I got all kinds of information in here
[2819.16 - 2823.66] samples of toxic copper exposure I can
[2822.16 - 2825.34] talk about copper exposure a little bit
[2823.66 - 2827.08] because I think people have a lot of
[2825.34 - 2829.96] toxic exposure but you know what we
[2827.08 - 2831.22] might do that on one of our other ones
[2829.96 - 2832.90] coming up
[2831.22 - 2835.30] okay
[2832.90 - 2837.82] so all right so let's head to the heavy
[2835.30 - 2841.92] metal detox explosion oh oh half time
[2837.82 - 2841.92] half time pull it together
[2842.02 - 2845.28] you guys want to get the robot
[2863.43 - 2866.55] [Music]
[2871.06 - 2873.96] robot

[2886.12 - 2889.24] you know what I could talk about toxic
[2887.80 - 2891.46] heavy metals
[2889.24 - 2893.38] forever talk about them and talk about
[2891.46 - 2896.26] them talk about them but I also want to
[2893.38 - 2898.84] show you this really quick too
[2896.26 - 2901.06] let's show you the shot we're doing are
[2898.84 - 2903.66] you guys you got your book this is Page
[2901.06 - 2907.00] 462 right here
[2903.66 - 2909.46] 462. right here
[2907.00 - 2911.56] toxic heavy metal exposure so let's read
[2909.46 - 2916.62] about that a little bit real quick
[2911.56 - 2916.62] this exposure shot is especially geared
[2918.18 - 2923.62] page 462. this exposure shot is
[2921.64 - 2925.66] especially geared for recent exposure
[2923.62 - 2927.76] for toxic heavy metals
[2925.66 - 2930.52] helping to stop toxic heavy metals from
[2927.76 - 2932.92] settling deep in the body
[2930.52 - 2934.72] this shot can be used as an additional
[2932.92 - 2937.00] therapy to the heavy metal detox
[2934.72 - 2937.78] smoothies
[2937.00 - 2940.18] thank you
[2937.78 - 2943.48] heavy metal detox
[2940.18 - 2945.76] additional to that which are geared to
[2943.48 - 2948.46] extract toxic heavy metals that have
[2945.76 - 2950.68] already settled in the organs while
[2948.46 - 2953.08] providing ongoing support for toxic
[2950.68 - 2956.74] heavy metal exposure in the bloodstream
[2953.08 - 2959.50] lymph or intestinal tract
[2956.74 - 2963.34] ideal times to use this toxic heavy
[2959.50 - 2965.02] metal exposure shot include
[2963.34 - 2966.70] just so you know science of research
[2965.02 - 2968.92] only think that you have toxic heavy
[2966.70 - 2970.48] metals in the blood if it could be
[2968.92 - 2972.46] tested there they don't believe it's in
[2970.48 - 2973.66] the organs science and research doesn't
[2972.46 - 2976.32] know what's in the organs it's medical
[2973.66 - 2976.32] meme information
[2980.68 - 2985.36] ideal time to use the toxic Head Metal
[2982.72 - 2987.40] exposure shot include when you had
[2985.36 - 2988.72] dental work done
[2987.40 - 2990.04] I know what some of you guys are
[2988.72 - 2992.44] thinking you're thinking I didn't get it
[2990.04 - 2995.80] amalgam feeling removed and I didn't get
[2992.44 - 2999.46] an amalgam filling installed I had a
[2995.80 - 3001.38] ceramic filling installed aw therefore I
[2999.46 - 3003.60] don't need to use the exposure shot for
[3001.38 - 3005.76] that
[3003.60 - 3008.04] having dental work done such as getting
[3005.76 - 3010.04] Mercury amalgams fillings removed or
[3008.04 - 3014.34] getting new fillings of any kind
[3010.04 - 3016.80] including all composites
[3014.34 - 3019.50] if you just went to the dentist and you
[3016.80 - 3023.40] had Composites put in
[3019.50 - 3026.70] you still need to do the exposure shot
[3023.40 - 3030.48] because all composite they all have
[3026.70 - 3032.82] metal in them all Composites they all
[3030.48 - 3035.60] have that in them any dental work
[3032.82 - 3035.60] procedures
[3035.88 - 3039.24] ideal times to use a toxic heavy metal
[3037.86 - 3041.94] exposure shot
[3039.24 - 3043.68] when you had fluoride treatments
[3041.94 - 3045.90] retainers
[3043.68 - 3048.14] or braces
[3045.90 - 3051.90] if you had retainers
[3048.14 - 3054.06] braces done fluoride treatment so you
[3051.90 - 3056.70] might be saying hey W I don't do the
[3054.06 - 3059.64] fluoride treatment sorry I know
[3056.70 - 3062.40] fluoride's bad for me I I shouldn't do
[3059.64 - 3064.68] it but you had fluoride treatments when
[3062.40 - 3065.70] you were younger that's when you might
[3064.68 - 3067.56] want to think about the heavy metal
[3065.70 - 3069.68] detox smoothies and so forth and all
[3067.56 - 3069.68] that
[3071.04 - 3074.64] Alzheimer's and Dementia being toxic
[3072.96 - 3077.88] heavy metals caused this medical medium
[3074.64 - 3080.04] information some doctors in science are
[3077.88 - 3081.72] taking it but no studies can back it up
[3080.04 - 3083.64] and no studies were done to show there
[3081.72 - 3085.14] were Metals in somebody's brain they
[3083.64 - 3088.62] can't even determine it therefore
[3085.14 - 3090.78] they're making it up if they wanted to
[3088.62 - 3092.10] claim science is behind it it's not it
[3090.78 - 3094.50] comes from medical medium information
[3092.10 - 3097.02] any paper they've ever showed or an
[3094.50 - 3098.58] article saying that Alzheimer's is
[3097.02 - 3100.44] caused by toxic head metals does not
[3098.58 - 3103.26] have a study to back it up
[3100.44 - 3105.00] there's no way to determine or test for
[3103.26 - 3107.40] that it's not even possible you would
[3105.00 - 3109.38] have to follow an Alzheimer's case from
[3107.40 - 3111.84] the day they were born from when they
[3109.38 - 3115.08] were they were in utero from when they
[3111.84 - 3117.42] when they were birthed all the way to 80
[3115.08 - 3119.04] years until they died with Alzheimer's
[3117.42 - 3122.40] and you would have to study their entire
[3119.04 - 3123.84] life all the way for 80 years and then
[3122.40 - 3125.40] when they died you would have to cut
[3123.84 - 3127.32] open their brain and you would have to
[3125.40 - 3129.12] actually do an analysis on the metals
[3127.32 - 3131.70] and you'd have to biopsy their brain
[3129.12 - 3133.26] along the way as they were alive and you
[3131.70 - 3135.36] know biopsy in the brain as they were
[3133.26 - 3137.16] live for 80 years wouldn't be a good
[3135.36 - 3138.84] thing so what I'm saying is there is no
[3137.16 - 3142.14] test there is no study there is no
[3138.84 - 3144.06] identification or any study test or any
[3142.14 - 3146.70] peer review study that shows Metals
[3144.06 - 3148.62] cause Alzheimer's dementia it is medical
[3146.70 - 3151.02] medium information it came from above
[3148.62 - 3155.46] because therefore that's where it came
[3151.02 - 3156.96] from because yeah they didn't do a study
[3155.46 - 3157.98] and I've been talking about it for 35
[3156.96 - 3160.52] years
[3157.98 - 3160.52] okay
[3161.04 - 3164.34] thank you guys
[3162.42 - 3165.42] for hanging in there check it out have
[3164.34 - 3167.46] fluoride treatments like I said
[3165.42 - 3170.22] retainers or braces

[3170.22 - 3177.68] cooked food on a grill
[3173.34 - 3177.68] or from another type of cookout
[3178.14 - 3183.18] use the exposure shot if you consume
[3180.42 - 3186.66] restaurant food or beverages at coffee
[3183.18 - 3190.08] chains ooh coffee chains coffee chains
[3186.66 - 3193.26] coffee chains I will have my double

[3197.76 - 3204.26] coffee drink please
[3200.34 - 3207.78] in your toxic metal contaminated water
[3204.26 - 3210.12] that would be fantastic
[3207.78 - 3213.26] oh my God thank you
[3210.12 - 3213.26] I'm ready for the day
[3213.60 - 3217.32] I got an Alzheimer's and Dementia
[3215.10 - 3219.00] chapter and brain saver it is packed
[3217.32 - 3220.92] with details that will blow your mind
[3219.00 - 3222.78] when you read it about Alzheimer's
[3220.92 - 3224.34] dementia and the truth about what metals
[3222.78 - 3228.00] do in all of it did you guys read it yet
[3224.34 - 3232.16] oh my God I read it the other day
[3228.00 - 3232.16] because yes I have to read these books
[3232.80 - 3237.00] I'm not a genius that can retain all
[3234.90 - 3238.68] eight volumes of information from Spirit
[3237.00 - 3240.48] compassion above
[3238.68 - 3242.70] I'm a regular
[3240.48 - 3245.10] person with just an ability to hear the
[3242.70 - 3247.80] words and write them down but it's not
[3245.10 - 3249.78] like I can remember every single word in
[3247.80 - 3252.42] all of these books
[3249.78 - 3255.12] I'm not in Einstein
[3252.42 - 3257.22] I'm not just saying this I'm not just
[3255.12 - 3259.32] saying it's the cause
[3257.22 - 3261.24] but I'm saying I'm not just saying that
[3259.32 - 3263.22] Metals cause Alzheimer's and Dementia
[3261.24 - 3266.82] that's one aspect that I'm saying how
[3263.22 - 3271.02] how it causes it it's mind-blowing
[3266.82 - 3271.02] it's the how and why okay
[3272.16 - 3277.70] metal Expo heavy metal detox exposure
[3274.32 - 3277.70] heavy metal exposure shot
[3278.76 - 3283.14] if you consume restaurant food or
[3280.50 - 3285.54] Beverages and coffee chains
[3283.14 - 3288.80] where town or city tap water is used in
[3285.54 - 3293.30] food and drink preparation
[3288.80 - 3293.30] hence every single coffee chain
[3293.82 - 3298.50] use this exposure shot if you breathe in
[3296.52 - 3300.78] air fresheners fragrances perfumes
[3298.50 - 3303.80] colognes scented candles detergents or
[3300.78 - 3303.80] fabric softeners
[3304.56 - 3309.96] we're going to create a fabric softener
[3306.90 - 3312.42] that has a smell that only grows for the
[3309.96 - 3315.00] next hundred years
[3312.42 - 3316.20] put one sheet of this fabric softener in
[3315.00 - 3319.02] your machine
[3316.20 - 3320.88] and it'll smell like this terrifying
[3319.02 - 3325.16] dangerous deadly chemical that's
[3320.88 - 3325.16] produced in a chemical plant somewhere
[3325.92 - 3331.44] it's gonna smell like potpourri
[3328.98 - 3333.30] Burma Polo says hi Anthony my
[3331.44 - 3335.64] one-year-old boy loves celery juice
[3333.30 - 3338.64] heavy metal detox movie and your shots
[3335.64 - 3341.40] love from Germany thank you and thank
[3338.64 - 3344.78] you for support in Germany thank you and
[3341.40 - 3344.78] bless your heart seriously
[3345.78 - 3351.74] Michelle
[3347.64 - 3351.74] braces and then retainers for 30 years
[3353.16 - 3357.14] duly noted understood
[3357.18 - 3361.04] it's not easy it's just not easy
[3361.32 - 3364.92] use this shot
[3363.12 - 3366.12] If You Smell Smoke from something
[3364.92 - 3369.00] burning
[3366.12 - 3371.16] and you do not know the Smoke's Origins
[3369.00 - 3372.66] or the purity of whatever is burning so
[3371.16 - 3374.64] here's how it works
[3372.66 - 3377.10] on planet Earth there's always something
[3374.64 - 3382.34] burning
[3377.10 - 3382.34] and it's not always just plain old wood
[3382.74 - 3389.28] for instance when they try to die out
[3386.96 - 3393.54] fires forest fires
[3389.28 - 3396.30] which they need to do they dump a powder
[3393.54 - 3398.70] on the forest fires that powders got
[3396.30 - 3400.56] metal in it and then it smolders up and
[3398.70 - 3403.16] burns right and then it goes in the
[3400.56 - 3403.16] atmosphere
[3403.56 - 3408.90] it's the point I'm trying to say is
[3406.86 - 3411.84] when people are burning fire pits
[3408.90 - 3415.52] they're burning plastic and garbage
[3411.84 - 3415.52] people just burn a lot of stuff
[3416.76 - 3420.20] the
[3418.14 - 3420.20] um
[3420.44 - 3427.26] the food industry
[3423.00 - 3429.12] Burns row covers that are plastic
[3427.26 - 3431.76] from you know for after they produce
[3429.12 - 3434.46] food each year
[3431.76 - 3436.68] say the Divine says what about metal
[3434.46 - 3438.18] plates from surgery we need to remove
[3436.68 - 3440.28] them yes
[3438.18 - 3441.96] I recommend not removing your metal
[3440.28 - 3443.64] plates from surgery unless your doctor
[3441.96 - 3445.32] wants to remove your metal plates for
[3443.64 - 3447.42] some reason for surge for after surgery
[3445.32 - 3449.16] or from surgery
[3447.42 - 3451.32] what I recommend and I've said this
[3449.16 - 3453.66] before if someone has nuts and bolts in
[3451.32 - 3455.52] them if they got titanium nuts and bolts
[3453.66 - 3456.96] holding their ankles together and
[3455.52 - 3459.24] they're and they're they're spying
[3456.96 - 3460.98] together and they got rods in their back
[3459.24 - 3463.14] keeping their back straight or they got
[3460.98 - 3466.80] a cage around their metal cage around
[3463.14 - 3468.60] their their disc their broken disc and
[3466.80 - 3470.58] whatever it is that they have metal or
[3468.60 - 3472.02] they got a plate in their head I only
[3470.58 - 3474.84] recommend
[3472.02 - 3477.36] right I only recommend
[3474.84 - 3479.58] exactly like the heavy metal detox
[3477.36 - 3481.38] smoothie and for family and friends or
[3479.58 - 3483.30] anybody that knows anybody that has any
[3481.38 - 3484.56] kind of metal in them from surgeries or
[3483.30 - 3486.66] procedures
[3484.56 - 3488.70] from car accidents to all kinds of
[3486.66 - 3491.22] injuries and they got metal inside of
[3488.70 - 3496.08] them like screws and nuts and bolts all
[3491.22 - 3498.54] of that I've always said that's fine
[3496.08 - 3499.86] it's it's just that's when the heavy
[3498.54 - 3501.24] metal detox movie is so great it's
[3499.86 - 3504.12] Gathering any metal that could be
[3501.24 - 3506.04] leaching that's the whole point
[3504.12 - 3508.62] but ask your doctor what's right for you
[3506.04 - 3510.66] you know
[3508.62 - 3512.82] take the book to your doctor but no I
[3510.66 - 3514.38] don't recommend like ever telling
[3512.82 - 3516.60] anybody hey you go take all your nuts
[3514.38 - 3518.16] and bolts out then why no you ask your
[3516.60 - 3520.02] doctor unless your doctor is doing that
[3518.16 - 3522.42] anyway that's another story that's
[3520.02 - 3524.40] whatever you and your doctor decide but
[3522.42 - 3526.32] I've always told doctors that I know
[3524.40 - 3528.42] that have asked this question
[3526.32 - 3530.10] and friends and stuff that have like a
[3528.42 - 3531.24] rod in their back or something from a
[3530.10 - 3533.58] bad injury
[3531.24 - 3535.98] or collapsed you know vertebrae or for
[3533.58 - 3538.56] some reason that that yeah heavy metal
[3535.98 - 3540.74] detox smoothie is great
[3538.56 - 3540.74] foreign
[3541.98 - 3546.12] we got some more stuff to read Nicholas
[3544.20 - 3549.36] Russell where else can you get this kind
[3546.12 - 3553.34] of info nowhere
[3549.36 - 3553.34] that's so true you can't get it anywhere
[3555.60 - 3559.98] and I'm not trying to boast I'm like you
[3559.14 - 3562.14] guys
[3559.98 - 3564.78] I have to learn it too
[3562.14 - 3566.34] I just have to try to message it to you
[3564.78 - 3568.74] guys but I have to learn the information
[3566.34 - 3571.08] when SOC gives me the info I have to
[3568.74 - 3572.88] learn it all
[3571.08 - 3575.04] yeah
[3572.88 - 3578.30] and what if I wasn't even interested in
[3575.04 - 3578.30] anything in health
[3578.52 - 3583.26] I heard the voice growing up
[3580.68 - 3584.76] right as a child Spirit of compassion
[3583.26 - 3586.80] giving me the info but what if I wasn't
[3584.76 - 3589.14] interested in any of this
[3586.80 - 3591.24] it's not even interesting to me like any
[3589.14 - 3593.82] of it like metals and
[3591.24 - 3595.62] neurons and heavy metal detects what if
[3593.82 - 3597.78] I just want to paint
[3595.62 - 3600.72] what do I just want to like paint and do
[3597.78 - 3602.88] art and paint Landscapes and this is not
[3600.72 - 3604.62] what I even want to do it doesn't matter
[3602.88 - 3606.42] I'm still forced to do it thanks to
[3604.62 - 3609.12] Spirit of compassion
[3606.42 - 3610.86] but I do it with a smile and I'm at your
[3609.12 - 3612.06] service

[3660.66 - 3664.02] recently treated with pesticide
[3662.16 - 3665.76] herbicide or insecticide spray and
[3664.02 - 3669.02] fortunately
[3665.76 - 3672.78] they keep on releasing genetically
[3669.02 - 3674.76] engineered mosquitoes
[3672.78 - 3678.00] we wouldn't have a mosquito on this
[3674.76 - 3681.06] planet they're putting them here now
[3678.00 - 3683.22] they raise the mosquitoes
[3681.06 - 3686.22] trillions and trillions and trillions of
[3683.22 - 3688.62] mosquitoes and they release them into
[3686.22 - 3691.32] all environments on the planet that
[3688.62 - 3696.30] could house and harbor a mosquito
[3691.32 - 3700.32] and then they sell mosquito spray to the
[3696.30 - 3703.74] governments to spray on all the villages
[3700.32 - 3707.00] and towns and cities on this planet
[3703.74 - 3712.28] they create the problem by raising
[3707.00 - 3716.34] genetically engineered grown modified
[3712.28 - 3720.44] mosquitoes and then they spray
[3716.34 - 3720.44] to try to keep them down
[3723.84 - 3728.04] where are we going today here's one

[4321.56 - 4328.34] when you know you can do something about
[4325.52 - 4330.32] the exposure that we run into when you
[4328.34 - 4332.42] know you can do something about it when
[4330.32 - 4335.74] you actually can use your free will and
[4332.42 - 4335.74] actually do something about it
[4336.50 - 4340.64] it's a big deal
[4337.95 - 4344.54] [Music]
[4340.64 - 4347.30] where you actually have the ability to

[4701.90 - 4705.56] is so say you're doing celery juice and
[4704.00 - 4707.48] you fall off the wagon and you stop
[4705.56 - 4708.98] drinking celery juice but you believe in
[4707.48 - 4711.70] medical medium information and believe
[4708.98 - 4711.70] in celery juice
[4712.34 - 4718.34] it's okay
[4714.20 - 4720.08] I understand believe me I understand
[4718.34 - 4721.28] no one knows what it's like to be in
[4720.08 - 4723.08] your shoes

[4723.08 - 4726.62] your stresses your struggles the people
[4725.06 - 4728.36] you may live with the people you may
[4726.62 - 4730.88] know whoever your friends are the
[4728.36 - 4734.24] challenges you've had in your life
[4730.88 - 4736.82] and resources and everything else
[4734.24 - 4739.70] no one should be shamed no one should be
[4736.82 - 4742.16] blamed no one should be judged
[4739.70 - 4744.08] if you're doing the medical mean 369 or
[4742.16 - 4746.30] 28 day cleanse or monocleansing you fall
[4744.08 - 4748.70] off the wagon but you believe in it
[4746.30 - 4750.38] the pressure people get from their
[4748.70 - 4751.76] friends and family the pressure people
[4750.38 - 4753.86] get from
[4751.76 - 4758.30] just social media the pressure people
[4753.86 - 4760.94] get alone is so hard and then
[4758.30 - 4762.38] the emotional comfort of food the
[4760.94 - 4764.36] emotional comfort of what you went
[4762.38 - 4768.14] through in your life someone could go
[4764.36 - 4770.48] through so much emotional abuse in their
[4768.14 - 4774.02] lifetime when they were younger and they
[4770.48 - 4777.02] run to comfort Foods someone else
[4774.02 - 4779.30] could be living with someone who's had a
[4777.02 - 4782.48] lot happen in their life it's someone
[4779.30 - 4784.52] could be around food that they used to
[4782.48 - 4786.32] lean on as a comfort food and it's hard
[4784.52 - 4788.60] to stay on the wagon the point I'm
[4786.32 - 4792.02] trying to say is it's okay
[4788.60 - 4794.72] if you fall off the wagon and you can't
[4792.02 - 4796.76] get back on for now the addictions are
[4794.72 - 4799.04] strong out there I completely the
[4796.76 - 4801.14] chemicals and the MSG and the natural
[4799.04 - 4802.94] flavors and the addictions in the food
[4801.14 - 4804.68] that people didn't even know was there
[4802.94 - 4806.48] check out the medical meme podcast the
[4804.68 - 4808.40] natural flavors podcast please check
[4806.48 - 4810.56] that out if you get a chance the point
[4808.40 - 4812.24] I'm trying to say
[4810.56 - 4813.26] like Nicholas Russell said we've all
[4812.24 - 4815.48] been there
[4813.26 - 4819.32] absolutely
[4815.48 - 4824.42] and it's normal it's it's okay if we
[4819.32 - 4826.82] fall off the wagon it's okay it's okay
[4824.42 - 4829.64] you know because
[4826.82 - 4833.62] I don't know what it's like to be in
[4829.64 - 4837.32] your shoes you're falling off the wagon
[4833.62 - 4838.94] there's reasons there are reasons why
[4837.32 - 4841.76] that you might not even be able to
[4838.94 - 4844.22] identify there's reasons why
[4841.76 - 4846.68] I'm not in your shoes
[4844.22 - 4848.36] I try my best to feel what it's like to
[4846.68 - 4850.16] be in somebody's shoes but I do not
[4848.36 - 4852.68] blame you one bit if you fall off the
[4850.16 - 4855.86] wagon no one I blame no one if you fall
[4852.68 - 4859.88] off the wagon just get back on if you
[4855.86 - 4864.20] can when you can no shame no judgment
[4859.88 - 4867.20] get back on the wagon when you can when
[4864.20 - 4869.30] when you feel like you can when you feel
[4867.20 - 4871.94] like you know what I can do it now I can
[4869.30 - 4876.62] do it I can try it
[4871.94 - 4879.26] when the time comes and you can
[4876.62 - 4882.32] educating myself said I burnt the wagon
[4879.26 - 4884.60] many times and educate educating myself
[4882.32 - 4886.28] and that's serious that it's coming from

[4905.90 - 4911.18] it's not easy
[4908.12 - 4912.68] for what we're always up against
[4911.18 - 4914.72] and
[4912.68 - 4916.64] how we were raised or
[4914.72 - 4919.58] kind of experiences we had along the way
[4916.64 - 4921.92] everything plays a role
