[0.08 - 4.00] right here gonna make the liver rescue
[2.24 - 5.52] smoothie and that's what it does it
[4.00 - 9.04] rescues the liver
[5.52 - 10.88] medical medium tools do they do rescue
[9.04 - 12.64] the liver because that's a big part of
[10.88 - 14.56] why everybody's sick
[12.64 - 16.32] um if you've got gout that's the liver
[14.56 - 18.72] eczema psoriasis the liver
[16.32 - 19.68] any skin condition in the liver vitiligo
[18.72 - 21.28] the liver
[19.68 - 22.72] and it just goes on and on and on i mean
[21.28 - 24.08] there's so many different conditions
[22.72 - 26.40] heart palpitations
[24.08 - 28.40] the liver i mean you just should go on
[26.40 - 30.24] and on and on and on liver liver liver
[28.40 - 30.72] and that's a big part of why everybody's
[30.24 - 32.80] sick
[30.72 - 34.00] we walk around we don't know about it we
[32.80 - 37.52] don't understand
[34.00 - 38.72] we our liver needs a routine and it has
[37.52 - 41.12] a routine but we
[38.72 - 42.00] break its routine and then we break its
[41.12 - 43.60] routine
[42.00 - 45.68] and then we break its routine and that's
[43.60 - 47.04] what we do and that's what happens to
[45.68 - 49.84] our liver is we
[47.04 - 50.88] break its routine all the time and then
[49.84 - 52.72] we also
[50.88 - 54.96] we also do a lot of stuff to our liver
[52.72 - 56.84] that we don't know about we're eating
[54.96 - 58.00] those hot dogs we're eating those
[56.84 - 60.96] cheeseburgers
[58.00 - 62.56] we're eating the bacon you know and even
[60.96 - 64.00] if we're eating too many nut butters if
[62.56 - 66.00] you're eating too many nut butters if
[64.00 - 67.76] you're eating all that coconut oil
[66.00 - 69.44] if you're doing like two tablespoons of
[67.76 - 70.88] coconut oil because somebody told you it
[69.44 - 73.12] was a good idea
[70.88 - 74.72] and then what happens is that that
[73.12 - 76.56] you're doing all that coconut oil and
[74.72 - 78.16] then boom your liver is paying the price
[76.56 - 79.60] for it nobody realizes it even though
[78.16 - 83.60] coconut oil is
[79.60 - 87.04] seemingly healthy right but we we end up
[83.60 - 88.40] we end up um really burdening our liver
[87.04 - 91.04] more and more
[88.40 - 93.20] even though it's already burdened it's
[91.04 - 95.04] already under pressure it's already
[93.20 - 96.48] stagnant it's already sluggish
[95.04 - 100.00] and the medical media morning cleanse is
[96.48 - 102.24] to save it's really to help save our
[100.00 - 104.72] liver at the same time but who cares
[102.24 - 107.84] about the liver who cares i mean
[104.72 - 110.16] you don't see it we don't feel it no one
[107.84 - 111.36] cares about it so why should we really
[110.16 - 114.24] care about our liver well
[111.36 - 115.20] the weight gain happens that's the liver
[114.24 - 116.56] right there
[115.20 - 118.24] the minute the weight gain starts
[116.56 - 120.64] happening you start putting on
[118.24 - 122.16] unwanted pounds you know you start
[120.64 - 124.64] putting on those unwanted
[122.16 - 125.36] ounces and they add up and they add up
[124.64 - 127.68] and they add
[125.36 - 129.28] up and then you know we get in trouble
[127.68 - 129.92] where all of a sudden we got we got an
[129.28 - 131.20] issue there

[348.88 - 353.36] it off like i was saying before
[350.16 - 355.20] 16 to 32 ounces of lemon water in the
[353.36 - 358.16] morning when you wake up
[355.20 - 358.64] because your liver has this routine and
[358.16 - 360.64] we
[358.64 - 362.08] break that liver's routine i'll talk
[360.64 - 364.56] about how
[362.08 - 366.40] so that's the water right here so what
[364.56 - 369.44] happens is that
[366.40 - 370.80] our liver has to work all night long to
[369.44 - 374.00] keep our blood
[370.80 - 376.40] clean so we walk around with dirty blood
[374.00 - 378.08] all the time and i talk about that in
[376.40 - 379.44] the past and you know what happens is
[378.08 - 381.28] when we walk around with dirty blood we
[379.44 - 382.64] end up getting dehydrated the toxins
[381.28 - 384.88] build up in our system
[382.64 - 386.16] they go back into our liver they get
[384.88 - 388.56] sucked back into our liver
[386.16 - 390.40] over and over again and our liver has
[388.56 - 393.04] this routine throughout the night
[390.40 - 395.12] which is really early morning where it
[393.04 - 397.20] likes to package up all those toxins the
[395.12 - 399.20] petrochemicals the plastics
[397.20 - 400.96] um colognes perfumes that we might
[399.20 - 402.48] breathe in they get trapped in the liver
[400.96 - 404.56] air fresheners
[402.48 - 406.80] uh scented candles they get trapped in
[404.56 - 409.92] the liver all that gets in there
[406.80 - 410.56] and our our liver wants to get it out
[409.92 - 412.72] and then
[410.56 - 414.40] gasoline at the pump at the gas station
[412.72 - 415.60] we're breathing in the fumes that goes
[414.40 - 417.36] inside our liver
[415.60 - 419.36] antibiotics we might have taken years
[417.36 - 421.80] ago maybe even recently
[419.36 - 423.76] go inside our liver antidepressants
[421.80 - 425.68] anti-inflammatories cold medicines all
[423.76 - 426.72] go inside her liver thyroid medications
[425.68 - 429.76] outside of liver
[426.72 - 430.48] and you know so what happens is it all
[429.76 - 432.24] adds up
[430.48 - 435.04] and it adds up and then the toxic heavy
[432.24 - 438.64] metals pesticides herbicides fungicides
[435.04 - 441.44] rodenticides and insecticides all of it
[438.64 - 443.44] um add up and they're built and they all
[441.44 - 445.12] store up and store up inside the liver
[443.44 - 446.56] the liver has this routine of wanting to
[445.12 - 447.60] get rid of this stuff if you hear
[446.56 - 449.52] somebody say
[447.60 - 451.36] you don't need a cleanse you don't need
[449.52 - 452.64] to worry about any cleansing there's no
[451.36 - 454.40] reason to cleanse
[452.64 - 455.76] who can you know your body does it
[454.40 - 458.00] naturally just eat good
[455.76 - 459.36] just eat a balanced diet just eat
[458.00 - 462.08] healthy enough
[459.36 - 463.04] you know just do that and your body will
[462.08 - 464.40] cleanse fine
[463.04 - 466.40] just so you know you're getting taken
[464.40 - 469.68] down the wrong road
[466.40 - 471.68] um that information is really just
[469.68 - 473.76] it it's not gonna help anyone really
[471.68 - 475.92] it's gonna set people back if anything
[473.76 - 478.24] our bodies do need a cleanse because
[475.92 - 480.32] we're up against so much and then
[478.24 - 482.32] we're up against all the high fat diets
[480.32 - 482.64] so a lot of people eat a lot of chicken
[482.32 - 484.32] they
[482.64 - 486.24] eat a lot of beef they eat a lot of
[484.32 - 489.52] bacon they eat a lot of eggs
[486.24 - 491.76] cheese milk butter nut butters
[489.52 - 494.08] even avocado people i've i got a friend
[491.76 - 495.28] who eats like 10 avocados a day
[494.08 - 497.76] and it's just basically like eating
[495.28 - 499.84] sticks of butter every day right and
[497.76 - 501.12] okay sure avocados are a healthier fat
[499.84 - 503.36] but the liver
[501.12 - 505.36] still needs to cleanse and when we fill
[503.36 - 507.12] our bloodstream up with fat all the time
[505.36 - 510.32] our liver can't cleanse
[507.12 - 512.72] so the goal is to
[510.32 - 514.08] the goal is to actually give it a break
[512.72 - 516.80] like allow it to do
[514.08 - 517.60] its routine and not break that routine
[516.80 - 519.84] so
[517.60 - 521.76] when morning comes early morning comes
[519.84 - 523.36] your liver's getting ready to pack up
[521.76 - 523.84] all those poisons and toxins and get
[523.36 - 526.72] them out
[523.84 - 527.12] so you do 16 to 32 ounces of lemon water
[526.72 - 529.84] to
[527.12 - 531.36] flush that out out help it flush it out
[529.84 - 532.56] of the bloodstream help it flush it out
[531.36 - 534.72] push it out of the liver
[532.56 - 536.00] and get it out of the body and that's
[534.72 - 537.04] what you want to do in the morning
[536.00 - 539.76] that's the goal
[537.04 - 540.48] that's the key you're assisting your
[539.76 - 543.20] liver
[540.48 - 544.40] to actually cleanse and detox and that's
[543.20 - 548.00] what you're doing
[544.40 - 550.48] so with that said we usually
[548.00 - 551.44] break that by we put we end up eating
[550.48 - 553.12] some butter
[551.44 - 554.32] we end up eating some nut butters in the
[553.12 - 555.92] morning we put peanut butter in our
[554.32 - 556.72] smoothies we put coconut oil in our
[555.92 - 558.56] smoothies
[556.72 - 560.08] and hey maybe we just do eggs in the
[558.56 - 561.04] morning maybe we do bacon in the morning
[560.08 - 563.52] whatever it is
[561.04 - 565.52] whatever it is before noon when you have
[563.52 - 566.56] those fats before noon those radical
[565.52 - 569.28] fats i call them
[566.56 - 569.92] when you have those radical fats before
[569.28 - 572.80] noon
[569.92 - 574.08] your liver shuts down boom it's just
[572.80 - 576.08] shuts down
[574.08 - 578.16] and it can't do what it's got to do
[576.08 - 578.64] that's it meaning it can't get the stuff
[578.16 - 580.56] out
[578.64 - 581.84] and then the toxins float around in your
[580.56 - 583.12] bloodstream float around in your
[581.84 - 583.76] bloodstream and float around in your
[583.12 - 584.96] bloodstream
[583.76 - 587.60] and as they float around in your
[584.96 - 589.36] bloodstream they actually get
[587.60 - 591.20] caught up and they get stagnant in there
[589.36 - 593.44] and they end up
[591.20 - 594.24] they end up back into the liver is what
[593.44 - 597.20] they end up
[594.24 - 597.68] they end up back in and then we get in
[597.20 - 601.44] trouble
[597.68 - 604.80] so the point is is we want to make sure
[601.44 - 605.84] the lemon water is there for you
[604.80 - 606.72] first thing in the morning so that's the
[605.84 - 608.16] first thing we're going to make some
[606.72 - 611.28] celery juice that's the next part
[608.16 - 613.36] you got to wait 15 to 30 minutes minimum
[611.28 - 615.04] 15 minutes to 30 minutes
[613.36 - 616.48] before you have your celery juice we're
[615.04 - 618.72] going into that right now i'm gonna
[616.48 - 621.76] juice that
[618.72 - 623.28] up here this is the next part of the
[621.76 - 623.76] morning plants remember we're on day two
[623.28 - 626.80] of the
[623.76 - 628.80] day morning cleanse challenge um if you
[626.80 - 632.56] guys don't have plans to heal you might
[628.80 - 632.56] want to get a copy of cleanse to heal
[665.25 - 672.16] [Music]
[668.72 - 672.16] a little celery juicing
[672.80 - 676.96] how are you guys the sound is gone
[677.20 - 679.52] okay
[681.04 - 684.40] let me know if it comes back
[687.12 - 690.16] sound is gone huh
[695.20 - 699.76] you only hear the juicer how do you hear
[697.20 - 702.08] me now you guys hear me all right now
[699.76 - 703.76] better better okay so maybe the juicer
[702.08 - 705.84] is just right up against the mic
[703.76 - 708.88] and i think that's what's happening
[705.84 - 708.88] still vibrating though
[709.68 - 712.64] sound problems still
[714.00 - 717.44] so maybe the juicer was okay so it's
[716.16 - 722.32] better okay great
[717.44 - 722.32] so the juicer was covering the sound
[724.28 - 726.72] [Music]
[724.81 - 729.76] [Applause]
[726.72 - 733.52] had the mic up against juicer so i'm
[729.76 - 733.52] making some celery juice you guys
[733.60 - 745.52] it's good now okay good now all right
[738.00 - 747.12] everybody's happy
[745.52 - 750.16] so are you guys doing the medical
[747.12 - 750.16] meeting warning plans
[750.40 - 754.08] it's a great way to really protect
[752.08 - 755.84] yourself during the holiday
[754.08 - 758.56] a lot of people have strokes heart
[755.84 - 761.84] attacks during the holiday
[758.56 - 762.80] and talking to a doctor and he said if
[761.84 - 764.40] only
[762.80 - 766.72] people were doing the medical medium
[764.40 - 769.84] morning cleanse during the holidays
[766.72 - 770.72] it would have prevented a lot of heart
[769.84 - 773.52] attacks
[770.72 - 775.68] a lot of people are on lots of salt and
[773.52 - 777.52] fat in their diet
[775.68 - 779.60] their blood gets really thick they get
[777.52 - 783.60] dehydrated during the holiday
[779.60 - 786.16] they're under stress and pressure right
[783.60 - 789.20] and then it's just that perfect time for
[786.16 - 789.20] boom a heart attack
[789.36 - 795.76] and the hospitals talking to
[792.96 - 797.36] an emergency room doctor friend of mine
[795.76 - 799.52] and he said right now a lot of people
[797.36 - 800.80] are coming in with fake heart attacks
[799.52 - 802.88] they're coming in with real heart
[800.80 - 803.92] attacks they're coming in with anxiety
[802.88 - 806.24] attacks
[803.92 - 807.60] panic attacks into the emergency room
[806.24 - 808.16] some are real heart attacks some are
[807.60 - 810.80] just
[808.16 - 811.44] basically big big old panic attacks
[810.80 - 815.12] which they call
[811.44 - 816.48] fake heart attacks and it's it happens
[815.12 - 819.52] at this time of year
[816.48 - 820.48] and i like to think about this as being
[819.52 - 822.40] a preventative
[820.48 - 823.52] for a lot of people because when you're
[822.40 - 826.00] doing your celery to
[823.52 - 827.20] 16 to 32 ounces of celery juice and
[826.00 - 829.20] you're doing that
[827.20 - 831.68] and you're doing your 16 to 30 ounces of
[829.20 - 834.32] lemon water and you're doing the liver
[831.68 - 838.24] rescue smoothie or the medical medium
[834.32 - 838.24] heavy metal detox smoothie right
[838.32 - 841.44] you're you're preventing all kinds of
[840.16 - 844.00] calamity total
[841.44 - 847.60] adversity and all kinds of problems so
[844.00 - 847.60] it's really a helpful situation
[849.20 - 853.28] so right now i'm juicing always know
[851.92 - 854.56] that with this juicer you're always
[853.28 - 856.96] going to use less celery
[854.56 - 859.04] all celery changes as far as how much
[856.96 - 859.68] juice i'm using two kinds of celery
[859.04 - 861.36] right now
[859.68 - 863.60] from two different batches couple of
[861.36 - 864.88] sticks are juicier some sticks have no
[863.60 - 867.36] juice in them
[864.88 - 868.80] and it's not about how many sticks you
[867.36 - 871.92] put in the machine
[868.80 - 873.28] it's about how dry the pulp comes out if
[871.92 - 876.16] that pulp comes out
[873.28 - 878.32] bone dry like in this machine here then
[876.16 - 880.16] guess what you get all the juice
[878.32 - 882.08] and that's the key right there that's
[880.16 - 884.08] the key and that means
[882.08 - 886.32] out of any other juicer this juicer will
[884.08 - 889.80] actually cut your celery costs in half
[886.32 - 892.80] because you're getting every drop out
[889.80 - 894.48] [Applause]
[892.80 - 896.32] i think you guys know the model i've
[894.48 - 900.24] talked about it so many times
[896.32 - 900.24] um but i know that that might not matter
[900.64 - 904.08] so michelle crane's asking how much
[902.40 - 908.24] celery are you using
[904.08 - 911.36] to get how much juice i mean
[908.24 - 914.24] some bunches of celery have are very
[911.36 - 916.08] juicy so with this machine you'll only
[914.24 - 919.44] need like five or six sticks
[916.08 - 921.36] seven sticks some are really not juicy
[919.44 - 922.56] this is not a bat this is not a juicy
[921.36 - 926.40] batch this is a really
[922.56 - 929.92] skinny celery stick so i'm using about
[926.40 - 933.60] for these 32 ounces of juice
[929.92 - 935.92] i'm using one bunch of celery
[933.60 - 938.40] actually probably a little less maybe a
[935.92 - 938.40] little less
[939.60 - 946.00] but um so
[942.72 - 946.00] celery juice is
[946.16 - 949.36] it's like a little a little miracle is
[948.32 - 951.20] what it is
[949.36 - 953.36] it's changing people's lives i love it
[951.20 - 955.60] in the medical media morning cleanse
[953.36 - 957.20] what it does it's just extraordinary so
[955.60 - 958.48] i just used some celery right here and
[957.20 - 961.60] what you'll see
[958.48 - 962.96] is this pulp is bone dry it's a little
[961.60 - 965.92] piece of pulp right here
[962.96 - 967.28] that that is i've used so many juicers
[965.92 - 969.12] this is just incredible
[967.28 - 971.92] by the way for all this juice it's
[969.12 - 971.92] really incredible
[972.16 - 974.40] um
[976.56 - 983.84] i'm gonna pour the celery juice down
[995.12 - 1001.68] there we go and there's still more
[998.72 - 1001.68] uh in the container
[1003.20 - 1007.60] so i got the 16 to 32 ounces well this
[1005.36 - 1009.20] is this is 32 ounces roughly
[1007.60 - 1011.44] of the celery juice that's the second
[1009.20 - 1012.80] part of the second step in the medical
[1011.44 - 1015.04] meeting morning cleanse
[1012.80 - 1016.72] really important to do if you don't have
[1015.04 - 1019.44] celery you can't do celery
[1016.72 - 1021.28] look do aloe water do the medical medium
[1019.44 - 1022.64] aloe water do the medical medium ginger
[1021.28 - 1023.76] water if you want these are different
[1022.64 - 1027.84] options right there
[1023.76 - 1032.00] that you can do so um but
[1027.84 - 1033.84] right here i'm about to do the next step
[1032.00 - 1035.44] and we're going into the liver rescue
[1033.84 - 1036.08] smoothie is where we're heading into now
[1035.44 - 1039.36] you guys
[1036.08 - 1040.80] so i'm excited um so like i said 16 to
[1039.36 - 1042.80] 32 ounces of
[1040.80 - 1043.84] lime water i got today you could do
[1042.80 - 1046.64] lemon water
[1043.84 - 1048.56] which is great 16 to 30 ounces of celery
[1046.64 - 1050.40] juice i have right there too remember 15
[1048.56 - 1051.68] to 30 minutes is what you want to wait
[1050.40 - 1052.88] before you do your cellar juice after
[1051.68 - 1054.16] your lemon water
[1052.88 - 1056.24] and then you want to wait a little while
[1054.16 - 1057.52] after your celery juice too so that's
[1056.24 - 1059.04] what we want to do
[1057.52 - 1060.64] so i'm going to move things around i'm
[1059.04 - 1064.24] going to move the juicer out of the way
[1060.64 - 1064.24] so that's where i'm going next okay
[1065.12 - 1068.08] bear with me you guys
[1073.76 - 1081.84] just gonna get this out of the way here
[1082.80 - 1087.52] so i got the blender in front of me i'm
[1084.96 - 1090.64] going to make the liver rescue smoothie
[1087.52 - 1090.64] is what i'm doing next
[1092.96 - 1096.00] know i love preventative but real
[1094.96 - 1097.84] preventative stuff
[1096.00 - 1099.28] not stuff like not stupid talk
[1097.84 - 1101.52] preventative like
[1099.28 - 1102.48] where someone says this supplements uh
[1101.52 - 1104.64] scientifically
[1102.48 - 1105.60] you know there's a scientific study that
[1104.64 - 1108.08] vitamin a
[1105.60 - 1109.52] could help prevent an eye problem or
[1108.08 - 1111.52] something like that great
[1109.52 - 1112.56] that's really not real preventative to
[1111.52 - 1115.12] begin with
[1112.56 - 1117.52] that's not like real serious move the
[1115.12 - 1120.08] needle preventative like preventing
[1117.52 - 1121.20] disease preventing heart attacks
[1120.08 - 1123.28] preventing
[1121.20 - 1125.12] chronic fatigue syndrome like really
[1123.28 - 1126.88] understanding what causes illness and
[1125.12 - 1128.80] really preventing because that's what
[1126.88 - 1130.08] medical medium information is about
[1128.80 - 1132.80] when you're doing medical medium
[1130.08 - 1134.40] information like in cleanse to heal
[1132.80 - 1136.32] you're doing what you're really doing is
[1134.40 - 1139.04] you're really protecting yourself
[1136.32 - 1140.72] and from from problems you don't even
[1139.04 - 1142.24] know could even have been coming and it
[1140.72 - 1144.08] happens to people all the time
[1142.24 - 1145.44] they live their life then now they have
[1144.08 - 1146.96] thyroid disease then they live their
[1145.44 - 1147.52] life and now they have something else
[1146.96 - 1149.28] and
[1147.52 - 1151.68] and when you're doing some of these
[1149.28 - 1153.52] things you're preventing that for the
[1151.68 - 1155.84] future and if you have problems you're
[1153.52 - 1159.12] reversing that and that's the key
[1155.84 - 1159.92] so i'm in um medical medium plans to
[1159.12 - 1162.00] heal
[1159.92 - 1163.36] so i got the blender right here i got

[1370.00 - 1372.80] know what causes illness
[1371.36 - 1374.96] it's incredible that everybody can be
[1372.80 - 1376.08] such an expert when they don't know why
[1374.96 - 1378.88] anybody's sick
[1376.08 - 1380.72] isn't that amazing medical medium
[1378.88 - 1381.76] information changed the roles in chronic
[1380.72 - 1383.68] illness because we had
[1381.76 - 1386.08] we got answers for the first time in
[1383.68 - 1387.76] history about why people are sick with
[1386.08 - 1388.80] chronic illness isn't that unbelievable
[1387.76 - 1391.52] how it works
[1388.80 - 1393.68] and it had to come from above it's like
[1391.52 - 1395.52] science of research for some reason just
[1393.68 - 1396.96] can't find out why anybody's sick and
[1395.52 - 1397.76] everybody's rolling around sick out
[1396.96 - 1399.44] there
[1397.76 - 1400.80] so i had to get the answers from bub
[1399.44 - 1402.72] since i was a child i put it in the
[1400.80 - 1403.44] books and people's lives are being saved
[1402.72 - 1405.68] and
[1403.44 - 1407.60] i love when people out there they'll rip
[1405.68 - 1409.36] apart a banana or they'll rip apart
[1407.60 - 1410.56] something and they don't even know why
[1409.36 - 1411.84] everybody has lupus
[1410.56 - 1413.44] they don't know why people have multiple
[1411.84 - 1414.32] sclerosis they don't know why anybody
[1413.44 - 1417.04] has eczema
[1414.32 - 1418.48] and if they do spout out something it
[1417.04 - 1420.24] comes from medical medium published
[1418.48 - 1422.40] information they'll say oh it's the
[1420.24 - 1423.36] liver now a god x mug that's funny
[1422.40 - 1424.96] because
[1423.36 - 1427.44] the only place that ever came from was
[1424.96 - 1429.36] medical medium published information so
[1427.44 - 1430.96] it's you know that will happen out there
[1429.36 - 1432.40] because because all millions of books
[1430.96 - 1434.88] got out there in the world but
[1432.40 - 1436.00] when nobody knows why anybody got sick
[1434.88 - 1437.44] or gets sick
[1436.00 - 1439.76] and they're suffering and struggling
[1437.44 - 1442.32] it's funny how they could be experts and
[1439.76 - 1443.28] maybe tear down a banana or rip apart
[1442.32 - 1445.60] something else it's
[1443.28 - 1446.64] really kind of if you really think about
[1445.60 - 1448.32] it it's just
[1446.64 - 1450.24] yeah you're right michelle they'll just
[1448.32 - 1452.24] say it's genetic that's not an answer oh
[1450.24 - 1453.68] so our genes all went bad in the last 20
[1452.24 - 1456.08] years
[1453.68 - 1458.40] chronic illness is literally exploding
[1456.08 - 1459.84] and our genes seem to all go bad in the
[1458.40 - 1461.52] last 20 years
[1459.84 - 1463.60] after thousands of years it just all
[1461.52 - 1466.32] went bad interesting right
[1463.60 - 1467.20] so yeah so anyway i just put the bananas
[1466.32 - 1469.36] in here
[1467.20 - 1471.36] so i got that you can add some water
[1469.36 - 1475.12] into this it's optional in your

[1748.56 - 1755.04] and um
[1753.52 - 1757.36] so i'm going to start out with with the
[1755.04 - 1759.04] oats look um
[1757.36 - 1760.64] you got a couple options you got a
[1759.04 - 1762.32] couple of options depending on how many
[1760.64 - 1764.24] people you're feeding if it's just for
[1762.32 - 1766.32] yourself if you're feeding your family
[1764.24 - 1768.96] you could always double the recipe
[1766.32 - 1772.80] triple the recipe you can go you can go
[1768.96 - 1772.80] there i'm gonna do a cup of oats
[1772.96 - 1776.16] so here's a bowl of oats right here i
[1775.04 - 1777.84] don't know if you can see it with the
[1776.16 - 1779.60] lighting or how it works there but
[1777.84 - 1783.36] there's
[1779.60 - 1783.36] there's a bowl of oats right there
[1790.24 - 1795.84] and um
[1797.92 - 1802.00] so you put a couple of oats in here okay
[1806.96 - 1811.36] it's about a cup a little bit more than
[1808.56 - 1811.36] a cup that time
[1811.68 - 1816.48] i'm gonna put two cups of water in here
[1820.84 - 1825.76] and i got the burner on
[1826.16 - 1831.84] so there you go i got the pot
[1829.20 - 1835.04] a cup of oats two cup of water so and
[1831.84 - 1838.24] then i'm gonna add cinnamon
[1835.04 - 1840.00] right here so
[1838.24 - 1841.84] depending on how much cinnamon you like
[1840.00 - 1843.44] some people don't like a lot of it some
[1841.84 - 1845.44] people like a little bit of it
[1843.44 - 1846.80] you know i mean half a teaspoon is what
[1845.44 - 1848.48] i do usually
[1846.80 - 1850.48] you know i've measured it a lot so half
[1848.48 - 1853.36] teaspoon is really it's just
[1850.48 - 1854.48] about four taps for me so i just put the
[1853.36 - 1856.32] cinnamon in there i don't know if you
[1854.48 - 1858.40] can see that without it there you go see
[1856.32 - 1865.84] the cinnamon on top
[1858.40 - 1865.84] right so i put the cinnamon in there
[1868.72 - 1871.60] gonna mix it up
[1871.76 - 1875.52] got a little wooden utensil i don't like
[1873.60 - 1876.48] using metal utensils if you're gonna do
[1875.52 - 1878.08] any cooking
[1876.48 - 1879.60] because your metal utensil is just going
[1878.08 - 1880.24] to scratch scratch scratch scratch
[1879.60 - 1881.52] scratch
[1880.24 - 1884.88] i'm mixing it up and then i'm going to

[2157.68 - 2160.24] like that
[2161.68 - 2165.20] sometimes i like just also putting them
[2164.32 - 2167.52] right on top
[2165.20 - 2169.04] so i'll do either or but this is just
[2167.52 - 2169.60] looking so good this is the wild
[2169.04 - 2173.84] blueberry
[2169.60 - 2173.84] oatmeal right here the porridge
[2180.48 - 2187.84] so they're mixed in there
[2188.64 - 2191.92] moving this over
[2192.56 - 2196.56] okay and then i'm gonna actually put a
[2194.88 - 2201.84] few more wild blueberries right on top
[2196.56 - 2201.84] is what i'm gonna do
[2202.08 - 2208.72] so there it is there's the oatmeal
[2205.76 - 2210.00] then of course i have the maple syrup
[2208.72 - 2211.28] right here now i'm going to put a little
[2210.00 - 2213.36] maple syrup on top
[2211.28 - 2216.08] now you can do it to taste so i'm
[2213.36 - 2219.04] putting a little bit on there
[2216.08 - 2220.96] maybe i'm putting a little bit more
[2219.04 - 2224.64] can't help it
[2220.96 - 2228.16] so that's the wild blueberry
[2224.64 - 2230.80] porridge and um
[2228.16 - 2232.24] it's steaming hot the oatmeal trisha
[2230.80 - 2235.60] marie says it's beautiful
[2232.24 - 2237.12] yay amazing and
[2235.60 - 2238.96] but it's really incredible i mean
[2237.12 - 2240.64] honestly it's just incredible you got a
[2238.96 - 2242.32] little bit of the cinnamon in there
[2240.64 - 2243.68] you got the frozen wild blueberries that
[2242.32 - 2245.36] were mixed in there
[2243.68 - 2247.28] and then you got some wild blueberries
[2245.36 - 2247.68] put on top that's how i like to do it
[2247.28 - 2249.28] right
[2247.68 - 2251.36] and then you put a little maple syrup on
[2249.28 - 2252.80] top you can do this with millet too
[2251.36 - 2254.48] that's the other option you don't have
[2252.80 - 2257.36] to use oatmeal
[2254.48 - 2260.08] for you know but for the most healing in
[2257.36 - 2263.76] the medical medium morning cleanse
[2260.08 - 2265.12] try to even just do fruit up until noon
[2263.76 - 2268.64] you know you do the
[2265.12 - 2270.40] lemon water right here 16 to 32 ounces
[2268.64 - 2272.64] first thing in the morning upon waking
[2270.40 - 2276.00] flush that liver is what you want to do
[2272.64 - 2277.36] okay and then 15 to 30 minutes later you
[2276.00 - 2279.52] do the celery juice
[2277.36 - 2280.64] right after that okay 15 to 30 minutes
[2279.52 - 2283.12] later minimum
[2280.64 - 2284.32] you do the celery juice 16 to 32 ounces
[2283.12 - 2286.32] of celery juice
[2284.32 - 2288.40] can you imagine how much healing is
[2286.32 - 2291.68] already happening inside your body
[2288.40 - 2294.48] with that alone 15 to 30 minutes later
[2291.68 - 2296.00] you got the liver rescue smoothie i just
[2294.48 - 2296.72] showed you in the book if you just got
[2296.00 - 2298.24] on here
[2296.72 - 2300.00] then you get the liver rescue smoothie
[2298.24 - 2302.48] that's in cleanse the heel
[2300.00 - 2303.68] and that has the pattaya that has the
[2302.48 - 2304.80] wild blueberries you could watch this

[2308.48 - 2312.96] then you know you do some fruit that's
[2311.60 - 2314.08] the most powerful way of doing you could

[2314.08 - 2318.00] some bananas and mangoes together you
[2315.60 - 2321.12] can do frozen mangoes but
