00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,560
There is a lot of land people do not see

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:11,360
or walk on. There are a lot of woods,

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:14,080
forests, mountains, hills, valleys that

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:18,720
people are not allowed on. government

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:22,560
land, classified land, land for testing,

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:25,680
land for mining, or just endless swaths

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,560
of land, vast amount of acres that

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,439
nobody has access to. And even private

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,640
land nobody has access to, but the birds

10
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,040
do. They have access to this land. And

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,960
the majority of the birds fly and die

12
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:44,800
over this land, die from chemtrails and

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,280
land on the land dead or dying. And no

14
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,559
one sees it. Millions and millions of

15
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,879
birds over the years have fallen into

16
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:56,000
these federal lands, into these private

17
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:58,800
lands, into these forests, these hills,

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,079
these valleys, on these mountains, and

19
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:05,280
the death is not seen. These birds are

20
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,280
not seen.
