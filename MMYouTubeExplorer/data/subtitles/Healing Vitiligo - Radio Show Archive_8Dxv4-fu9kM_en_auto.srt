most advanced healing information it's

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,679
often decades ahead of what's out there

10
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:33,920
years 20 years to wait for answers and

11
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,040

industry right now the there's very few

16
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:50,160
answers it's unbelievable even where we

years ago helping out people and I

20
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,359
remember Spirit telling me we're way off

21
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,559
as far as the timeline as far as getting

22
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:01,000
getting the right information with

23
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,559
research Arch and science getting that

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,640
sorted out getting straight so we have

25
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:07,640
to do it for everybody we have to get

26
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,000
the advanced information out there for

27
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,880
everybody early and when it comes down

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,360
to

29
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,520
Vitiligo and some people call it Vio

30
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,759
some people viigo um some people call it

31
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:20,680
something different but you know what

32
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:23,880
happens is that even with

information what that means is it's

39
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,600
always been Advanced when Spirit hands

40
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,880
that information over to me um since a

41
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,280
young child that's how it's always been

42
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,719
and for anybody who is not familiar with

43
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,799
with how it works with medical medium

44
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:48,680
and the show and everything what you're

45
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,520
going to find on on these shows is

46
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:55,000
information that is not polluted and

47
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,399
it's not polluted by um certain groups

48
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,840
interest groups medical funding with

49
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,680
strings attached or botched research uh

50
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,799
thumb thumb on the scale kind of thing

51
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,560
where it's like internal Kickbacks and

52
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,079
persuaded belief systems and private

53
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,239
panel of influencers health field

54
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,399
payoffs and trendy traps those things

55
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,280
all exist in conventional and

56
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,480
alternative I repeat alternative

57
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,319
medicine in fact alternative medicine is

58
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,440
polluted with that there's a lot of

59
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,599
Empires built right now you guys don't

60
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:24,280
even know you don't even know how many

61
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:26,280
empires are built in the conventional

62
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,400
but but most I mean most importantly

63
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,120
alternative movement which is really sad

64
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,920
back in the old day it wasn't like that

65
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,879
I remember back in the old days it

66
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,680
wasn't about Empires building on

67
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:38,800
alternative medicine so that means you

68
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:41,480
know uh lots of money and lots of

69
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,400
studies being Twisted to for outcomes to

70
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,959
come out the way you know they want it

71
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,640
to be and stuff like that that didn't

72
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,840
really exist in alternative medicine in

73
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:52,239
the old days well it exists now and it's

74
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,840
really really horrific and this show

75
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,760
doesn't have any of that so if you're

76
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,200
you're first logged on to the show and

77
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,360
you're like what is this the medical

78
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,879
medium blah blah blah what is this show

79
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,680
what what is is he saying where's his

80
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,799
research and science where's his studies

81
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,159
let me tell you something you want to

82
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:06,799
stand by research in science with

83
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:08,440
chronic illness then you're just going

84
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:10,920
to be standing there for decades I'm

85
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:12,200
sorry decades and decades and decades

86
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,640
whether you like it or not whether you

87
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,400
don't like me whether you don't like

88
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,560
what I'm saying I don't care it's the

89
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,640
truth the truth is the truth the one

90
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,799
thing when people are sick with chronic

91
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:24,080
illness or with vialago or anything like

92
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:25,200
that is it has to be the truth when

93
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,280
people are suffering and they're

94
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,560
struggling with anything there's no

95
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,720
playing around there's no playing around

96
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,720
and I don't play around that's I don't

97
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:36,200
do it when it's when when it's about

98
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,720
this right here you know there's no way

99
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,280
because you're talking about people

100
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,720
suffering you're talking about people

101
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,319
going through so much in their lives

102
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,720
with all the different diseases

103
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,840
conditions and illnesses and symptoms

104
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,560
neurological symptoms everything from

105
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,760
aches and pains to chronic fatigue to

106
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,519
neuro fatigue to to I mean whatever

107
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,319
people deal with eye problems ear

108
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:56,400
problems you know throat problems

109
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,680
thyroid problems hashimotos thyroiditis

110
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,360
and hyperthyroidism and diabetes and all

111
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,360
these other things that we all deal with

112
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,920
out there and that's just this tip of

113
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,840
the iceberg but when chronic illness

114
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,840
when people are suffering and struggling

115
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,239
we can't play around it has to be

116
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,200
straight out it can't be protecting the

117
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,680
interest groups of research and science

118
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,439
it can't be about that because that's

119
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,880
what that does in chronic illness it's

120
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,840
all only about an outcome that they want

121
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,600
to hand you to protect them it's never

122
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,400
to protect the people in chronic illness

123
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,360
it's never to Pro protect the people

124
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,520
ever this is the only show you'll ever

125
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:31,160

vidigo then information about multiple

151
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,919
sclerosis then information about every

00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:34,440
different symptoms including emotional

155
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,960
psychological everything and getting the

156
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:41,440
information it was Advanced and it was

157
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:43,720
the same it was the same it was the same

158
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,360
information it was you know and that's

159
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,080
the and and and it's just Advanced right

160
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,759
now that's the whole point it wasn't

161
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,560
like oh okay Each decade went by and I

162
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:55,919
took information from some book gleaned

163
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:58,120
information from some Source never all

164
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,520
the medical medium

165
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,360
information it all starts from the

166
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,960
original Source right here it starts

167
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,400
from original Source from the books from

168
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,400
me all the way going back to Childhood

169
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,000
and it always has and it's been passed

170
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,319
around a lot of it's been passed around

171
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,840
and it's it's it's over the years and

172
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:17,000
it's come back full circle to me where I

173
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:20,560
where where it was started to begin with

174
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:24,160
I'm saying all this because with chronic

175
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:27,120
illness it has to be something above it

176
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,520
has to be something bigger and above

177
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,400
what's out there now because it's not

178
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,639
working what's out there now I'm telling

179
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,960
you right now it's not there are so many

180
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:37,639
people sick so many people struggling

181
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,199
I'm talking about every digestive order

182
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:43,639
disorder there is every bloating

183
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:45,360
constipation um Burning uh you know

184
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:47,759
people's hands feel like they're on fire

185
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:51,039
I mean I've seen it all aches and pains

186
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:54,000
all over the body um skin rashes eczema

187
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:56,680
stasis everything and people walk around

188
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,400
suffering migraines headaches sinus

189
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:01,120
infections chronic all the time lung

190
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,520
problems breathing problems nowhere do

191
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,639
they can get any help besides steroids

192
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,960
and immunosuppressive drugs you know new

193
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:09,919
inventions of immunosuppressive drugs so

194
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,319
you tell me is science and research on

195
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,319
the ball with chronic illness or they

196
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:15,400
got it all squared up they got it all

197
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:16,759
squared up huh just because you just

198
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,479
because you're convinced at how good

199
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:20,560
your car works right just because you're

200
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,080
convinced on how good GPS works just

201
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,520
because you're convinced on how good all

202
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,440
the technology works you think

203
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,879
everything else is sewed up just because

204
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,479
they could remove an appendix for

205
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:32,560
somebody and say their life which is

206
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:35,039
amazing but you they got it all sewed up

207
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,639
no they don't they don't and that's

208
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,400
what's that a Vitiligo we're talking

209
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,520
about I'm just covering a little bit one

210
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,759
of the greatest mistakes with vidigo is

211
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,360
and I'm just going to be straight up

212
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:46,840
about this is that it's said out there

213
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,599
in the industry and the alternative

214
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,280
industry believes this too see the

215
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:51,800
alternative industry Now isn't really

216
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,159
the alternative industry it's just a

217
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,919
conventional industry that's been kind

218
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:57,919
of kind of uh shook up a little bit kind

219
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,599
of a mixed bag of nuts it's not the

220
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:02,360
alternative industry of the old days I'm

221
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:04,159
just going to tell you right now and um

222
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,720
so and believe me I love the

223
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:07,479
conventional industry and I love the

224
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,199
alternative industry I love the people

225
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:11,039
that work in there it's not I'm not

226
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,680
talking about the people I'm not talking

227
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,800
about the people I'm talking about the

228
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:18,000
hierarchy of these these these um these

229
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,919
these industries yes there's a hierarchy

230
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,720
to these industries sorry to say it but

231
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:25,840
it's the truth so okay so here's the

232
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,840
deal so um one of the greatest greatest

233
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,240
mistakes with Vitiligo is the immune

234
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,039
system attacking itself and the

235
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,320
alternative industry adopted that so if

236
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,599
you're walking around if you just got a

237
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,919
diagnosis with

238
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,839
viigo if you just got a diagnosis with

239
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,240
viigo and you you know you walked into

240
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,839
the doctor's office you came out of the

241
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,399
doctor's office and it's just like well

242
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:46,200
yeah and I just got a diagnosis that my

243
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:49,440
body's attacking itself it's destroying

244
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:51,480
something it's destroying something so

245
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,560
Vitiligo is the whole thing with it is

246
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,920
okay it's autoimmune that's what you get

247
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,839
told it's

248
00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:02,279
autoimmune it's the belief that your own

249
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:03,800
immune system is attacking its cells

250
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:07,200
destroying

251
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:09,560
melanocytes destroying melanin so the

252
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,560
producer of melanin so this the pigment

253
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:14,399
the pigment that makes the skin color so

254
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:16,480
the cells are dying and they're dying

255
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,839
because your immune system is destroying

256
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,640
it so when you start getting the white

257
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,079
patches or the white blotches or you

258
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:23,399
start getting you can get all kinds of

259
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:29,320
it can hit you in all kinds of different

260
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:33,040
places with viig go but the thing is is

261
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:34,760
with this understand that um that when

262
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,399
we get told their body's attacking

263
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:39,079
itself when we get told their immune

264
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,480
system is destroying our pigment

265
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:43,959
producing

266
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:47,360
cells that's one great mistake we just

267
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:50,160
started off with one unbelievable great

268
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:54,040
mistake we just started off with and

269
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:56,480
what happens is that mistake is concrete

270
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:59,440
meaning it stays cemented it's

271
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,000
grandfather law in it's grandfather in

272
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,560
and I know I've talked about autoimmune

273
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,640
with you guys so many times I'm not

274
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,560
trying to bore you I'm not trying to

275
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,480
throw you I promise I'm not trying to do

276
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,839
anything like that I just have to tell

277
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,720
you because when it comes down to viigo

278
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:15,279
you walk out of the doctor's office just

279
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,519
like you do when you have Hashimoto

280
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:20,519
thyroiditis you walk out of the doctor's

281
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,959
office and you're told you have you

282
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:23,600
you're told you have a a problem with

283
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:25,200
your thyroid you're imune your own

284
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,000
immune system is destroying your thyroid

285
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,279
tissue causing hashimi thyroiditis you

286
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,760
know meaning causing thyroiditis

287
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:32,040
swelling of the thyroid it's the same

288
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,839
thing you walk out of the doctor's

289
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,800
office with anything now it's your body

290
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,880
attacking itself you walk out of the B

291
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,560
the doctor's office now with

292
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,720
fibromyalgia diagnosis oh that's

293
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:44,639
overactive nerves because your immune

294
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:46,160
system is is inflaming your nerves it's

295
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:48,680
just it's

296
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:51,399
unbelievable and oh it's genes by the

297
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,480
way everything's genetic genetic genetic

298
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:56,320
now throw everybody off the path throw

299
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:59,360
everybody off the course it's

300
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,720
unbelievable what's going on out there

301
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,720
and you know spirit and I were the first

302
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:07,720
were the first to bring to the world

303
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,240
decades ago bring to the world a long

304
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:13,160
time ago that Epstein bar is

305
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,240
responsible for Ms it's responsible for

306
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,880
fibromyalgia it's responsible for

307
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,800
Hashimoto thyroiditis it's responsible

308
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:22,360
and you know what happened the movement

309
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:24,000
got so big you guys have spread the word

310
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,519
the books got out there the information

311
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,959
got out there and it shook up the

312
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,120
industry you know what the industry did

313
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:32,519
they put out a bogus study saying hey we

314
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:36,360
now know that Epstein bar is linked is

315
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:39,279
linked to so check this out linked to

316
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,720
multiple sorosis fibromyalgia tashimo th

317
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:42,079
we know it's linked it's a trick what

318
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,720
that is is they're getting you to

319
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:47,519
they're baiting you and then they tell

320
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,360
you that it's not the cause though it's

321
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,519
not the cause epine bar is the cause of

322
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,680
all these different elses and they tell

323
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,720
you it's not the cause they just tell

324
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:57,680
you no it's your genes that are the

325
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,040
cause and it's autoimmune still it just

326
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:03,240
so happens Epstein bar might be a

327
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:04,959
trigger it might be linked no Epstein

328
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,760
bar is a cause this is this is done

329
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:09,040
purposely so you get tricked so when you

330
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:11,760
see these new articles out now those are

331
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,600
actually traps set because of what we've

332
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,040
done so far I know everybody's been

333
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,079
excited in the groups saw on the

334
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,560
Facebook groups and everything else that

335
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:21,600
you know that the that there were some

336
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,880
articles out there and it was like whoa

337
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,639
hey science just discovered that epsteen

338
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,199
bar is responsible for this and this and

339
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:29,480
that everybody was cheering and I don't

340
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:31,320
blame them but no it's it's not respond

341
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:34,440
they they were saying it's link to or

342
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:36,320
it's it's it's there's an affiliation no

343
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,920
no that's not good enough because you'll

344
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,880
you'll read through there and you'll see

345
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:43,199
where they set the Trap they're trying

346
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:45,120
to say don't don't believe the truth the

347
00:12:43,199 --> 00:12:46,959
truth got out there so stop believing

348
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,720
the truth and then believe us cuz we're

349
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:52,120
taking you down now the path of its

350
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:55,240
genes and autoimmune still this is how

351
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:57,560
it's done it's done and so it's really

352
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,760
really demented actually demented it's

353
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:02,519
it's it's sick because it's not about

354
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:05,320
healing people it's not about healing

355
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:06,880
anyone and even in the industrial I mean

356
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:09,279
the the alternative medicine now it's

357
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,320
all about infomercials and selling and

358
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:16,040
selling and selling and selling things

359
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:19,000
to make hundred million companies and

360
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:21,040
Empires and me meanwhile no one wants to

361
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,800
put out the truth no one wants to put

362
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,360
out the free information and the truth

363
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,079
we do that at Medical meeting for a

364
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:31,079
reason we put that out there so Vitiligo

365
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:32,240
so so I'm talking about all this because

366
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:34,120
because it's not that I'm trying to

367
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,199
throw you off course yet I'm going to go

368
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:38,800
right into it we got a whole 45 minutes

369
00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:42,000
left here it it's just that the

370
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:45,120
autoimmune diagnosis of Vigo is is is

371
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,160
disgusting because it's it's so it's

372
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,560
it's negligence it's negligence in its

373
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,040
highest highest fashion and its highest

374
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,639
order it's

375
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:59,240
negligence by by E that even being there

376
00:13:55,639 --> 00:14:01,800
it's an instant instant cancellation of

377
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:04,000
a person's ability to heal sure they

378
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,800
might get get to a doctor that's throws

379
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,440
a few fancy supplements in them and gets

380
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,680
them on a better diet and sometimes some

381
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:13,959
people improve and sometimes people get

382
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:16,959
worse but the point is it's an

383
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:20,240
instant stop you from healing just that

384
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:23,480
diagnosis alone it's your body's own

385
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,720
immune system attacking and destroying

386
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,440
melanocytes attacking and destroying

387
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:30,560
this the cells that produce melon in

388
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:33,320
your pigment the T Ing and destroying

389
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,680
that alone that alone and and they say

390
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,399
okay well you know maybe stress is

391
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,399
triggering it maybe something else is

392
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,399
that alone but your body is still

393
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:43,560
attacking itself is an instant we don't

394
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:47,480
want you to heal that's what it is it's

395
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:50,519
an instant industry rule that says we

396
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:52,839
don't want you to heal from Vitiligo and

397
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:55,279
we don't want you to know the truth and

398
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:58,440
never know the truth of viigo we never

399
00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:01,800
want you to know the truth ever ever

400
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:04,920
ever ever ever ever ever ever I'm

401
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:07,839
serious I'm serious about that I'm

402
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:10,000
serious and that's what that is so we

403
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:12,680
have to break that I'm pretty intense

404
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,360
today I know I know pretty intense I I

405
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:16,519
don't sound like I have a lot of humor

406
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:18,320
in in this today for some reason meaning

407
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:20,680
like I'd like to keep lighthearted I

408
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,480
like to have a little bit of humor in in

409
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:26,160
there because we can heal and the humor

410
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:29,360
is basically based on the Ridiculousness

411
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,759
of the industries and and and how they

412
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,759
take advantage of people and I try to

413
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:34,319
keep lighthearted about this but today I

414
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:36,959
I can't do it you know because I've just

415
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:40,639
recently even talked to somebody a

416
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:42,720
friend of mine a friend of mine um you

417
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,000
know their their their child is vialo

418
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,399
and they and they just went to the

419
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,319
doctor they came back to the doctor and

420
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:48,959
the friend said my friend said look the

421
00:15:47,319 --> 00:15:52,279
doctor said you know it's autoimmune

422
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:53,839
there's nothing we can do um and you

423
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:55,560
know and and what can we do and they

424
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:57,519
said Anthony what can we do what can we

425
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:59,480
do I said well I'm about to do a show on

426
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,880
it so you can you'll you'll find out

427
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:03,399
what we need to do during the show and

428
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,839
and we'll get some and you know you'll

429
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:09,600
have some clarity on the whole thing

430
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:11,560
it's unbelievable how it works so here's

431
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,079
the deal you know there there's

432
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,600
something there's something out there

433
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:18,600
that says okay well you you know

434
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:22,880
Vitiligo can be triggered by exposure to

435
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:27,480
Industrial chemicals that's the closest

436
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:30,240
they've ever been to something real

437
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:33,480
something real it's the closest they've

438
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:37,279
ever been to Something Real so what this

439
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:40,800
means is if the industries science and

440
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:42,600
research has a theory that the exposure

441
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:47,839
to Industrial

442
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:52,199
chemicals possibly could trigger

443
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:55,440
vidigo then I mean hats off hats off to

444
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:58,600
him hats off to him a little bit I mean

445
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,639
maybe a half hat maybe a half hat right

446
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,560
um so because because there there's

447
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:05,559
something I'm going to cover what that

448
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:07,959
means they're saying exposure to the

449
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:10,600
outside so they're saying exposure so

450
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:12,760
say you work in a factory say you work

451
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:15,640
somewhere and you're exposed to

452
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:17,559
chemicals industrial chemicals and they

453
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,839
noticed wait a minute someone gets F

454
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:20,520
light and they don't know what it could

455
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:23,039
be maybe it's the chemicals being

456
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:25,400
exposed on the skin maybe it's chemicals

457
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,280
being exposed in some way it's really

458
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,559
not

459
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:33,919
clear but what's happening is is there

460
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:37,840
re there is industrial chemicals in

461
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:42,000
everybody who has Vitiligo there is

462
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:46,080
industrial chemicals industrial toxins

463
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:49,919
deep within the body since birth or

464
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:52,480
after birth or during childhood and

465
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,240
these industrial chemicals you guys

466
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,000
these industrial

467
00:17:54,240 --> 00:18:01,640
chemicals are they

468
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:03,200
are part of why we have Vigo so but but

469
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,919
the but but but the medical industry and

470
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,600
science research they don't know that

471
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:08,559
part they're thinking it's like an

472
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,960
exposure to maybe the outside of the

473
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,559
body they're thinking like it's an

474
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,120
exposure I mean hats off they're even

475
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:15,720
thinking that but we're talking about

476
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,039
the real we're talking about the truth

477
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:20,039
we're talking about the real stuff we

478
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:23,240
don't play around with the bull we don't

479
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:25,799
play around with people and their health

480
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:29,080
it's all about getting it right because

481
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:30,600
you has to be right it has to be right

482
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,919
we don't throw you guys a whole bunch of

483
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,280
crazy bogus cleanses out there in the

484
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:35,760
world and all the different books that

485
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,520
are out there now it's like they have

486
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,520
all these different programs and stuff

487
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,960
like that I mean we don't throw anything

488
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,520
like that out at you because you know a

489
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:45,039
a lot of those things are just not going

490
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,120
to be right they're not going to be

491
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,360
right they're not even going to have

492
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:50,840
celery juice in them in order to get you

493
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:52,720
better it's always got to be right when

494
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,360
we have to get somebody better when we

495
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,919
have to figure out what the truth is and

496
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:59,480
what we need to do so these industrial

497
00:18:56,919 --> 00:19:03,799
chemicals they actually sit inside the

498
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:05,760
body of everybody deep down and then

499
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:09,240
that's just one part of it there's more

500
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,960
to it than that there's more to that so

501
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,360
it takes more than that it takes the

502
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,559
industrial chemicals whatever those

503
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,559
might be from the past toxic heavy metal

504
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:20,600
exposure passed on from generation to

505
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:26,120
generation to generation which may make

506
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:29,840
it look like it is genetic when it's not

507
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:32,799
genetic so toxic sotic heavy metals you

508
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:36,039
know um all the different metals that I

509
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:38,880
talk about all the time copper aluminum

510
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:41,679
Mercy you know lead just all the

511
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:44,320
different ones cadmium you know nickel

512
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,440
arsenic just lots of different metals

513
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,080
and then there's got to be something

514
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,520
else though there's got to be another

515
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:51,000
thing one other thing that has to happen

516
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,080
there has to be something called

517
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,240
oxidation the

518
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:58,200
metals need to be

519
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,880
oxidizing they need to be oxidizing

520
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,880
izing meaning to cause Vitiligo they

521
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,200
need to be oxidizing to cause

522
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:09,480
Vitiligo and when they

523
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:10,880
oxidize they they run you know what that

524
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,159
means is run it's not like somebody

525
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:16,200
jogging somebody

526
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:20,039
running what it means is the metals they

527
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:23,600
they corrode and when they corrode they

528
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:25,840
blow up the metals blow up that's what

529
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:28,919
they do that's what they do so the

530
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:30,760
metals actually blow up aluminum

531
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:34,159
is a big part of

532
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:36,640
Vitiligo aluminum that's a big one

533
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:39,440
that's a really big one for Vitiligo and

534
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:42,080
the aluminum has to sit inside the liver

535
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:45,039
it has to sit inside the liver and

536
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:48,000
that's what it does it sits in there and

537
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:50,080
then the aluminum interacts and reacts

538
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,080
with other metals well that's what the

539
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,720
aluminum does it interacts and reacts

540
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:58,640
with other

541
00:20:53,720 --> 00:21:01,000
metals and then it blows up large

542
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,000
but it needs something to blow up large

543
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,520
with something to cause it and that's

544
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,760
fats high fat diets so high fat diets

545
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:10,679
are an instigator for

546
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:12,200
Vitiligo a lot of times when somebody

547
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:14,480
cleans up their diet they're still

548
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:16,559
eating high fat but they got rid of

549
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,080
other fats too they got rid of so many

550
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,120
fats in their diet that they didn't know

551
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,720
it but they threw away processed foods

552
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:26,039
that were filled with fat they threw

553
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:27,600
away other fatty foods and they changed

554
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:29,840
over their diet cleaned up their diet

555
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,960
whether an animal protein diet a you

556
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,440
know paleo diet a vegan diet a

557
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:35,799
plant-based diet a whatever kind of diet

558
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,440
there is out there you throw away the

559
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:39,039
process foods you end up blowing your

560
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,880
fat a little bit because you're probably

561
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:43,279
throwing away lots of different other

562
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,400
fatty sources along with the normal fats

563
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:48,039
that you eat every day like meat and

564
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,960
everything else and then so you start

565
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:51,120
and a lot of people with Vitiligo you

566
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,159
start seeing a little bit of a

567
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,320
difference not everybody but some people

568
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:56,520
start getting a little bit of a

569
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:59,000
difference going on that's because the

570
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:02,000
fats have reduced in their diet diet and

571
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,039
the fats get inside the liver and they

572
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,640
actually cause the reason why you want

573
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:08,720
to reduce these fats in your diet is

574
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:13,840
they get inside the liver and what they

575
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:17,640
do is they oxidize the metals quickly

576
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:20,600
they oxidize the aluminum quickly so

577
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:24,080
aluminum with the fat on it will then

578
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:26,039
oxidize it'll blow up it'll blow up what

579
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,480
does that mean blow up well cons you

580
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:30,200
know just like if you take a balloon

581
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,440
little rubber balloon you start blowing

582
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:35,240
into it and it starts to blow up with

583
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:38,039
air starts to fill up with air well the

584
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:40,679
the the luminum yeah little bits of

585
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:44,039
micro aluminum that's right little bits

586
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:47,480
of aluminum just like Nano

587
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:51,120
aluminum and when this aluminum gets

588
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:53,520
starts to oxidize it starts to expand

589
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,559
starts to expand and that's why the high

590
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,480
fat diets are so bad for Alzheimer's and

591
00:22:55,559 --> 00:23:01,559
so bad for because any kind of metals

592
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:04,480
like mer Mercury inside the brain and

593
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:06,919
aluminum Mercury inside the brain and

594
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,279
you got and you got a high-fat diet

595
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:10,600
going on and that's why when people go

596
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:11,919
off their processed food diets and

597
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,279
they're saying hey I got somebody with

598
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,919
alzheimer's they're starting to come

599
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:16,360
around a little they're they weren't

600
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:18,000
that advanced to begin with but they

601
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,559
were they were you know they were they

602
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,880
were having problems they weren't you

603
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:22,640
know they weren't F they weren't

604
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,360
functioning right and they were and I

605
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,640
and and and I went to this doctor and he

606
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:29,240
put them on this special remove whatever

607
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,960
out of your diet and and whatever and

608
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,880
what he the doctor did was removed

609
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:36,320
without realizing it a lot of processed

610
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:38,120
foods with bad fats but then still kept

611
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,640
the diet a high fat diet because the

612
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:41,400
doctor could have done a lot better than

613
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:44,200
that if the doctor lowered the fats

614
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:47,240
altogether in the diet like we talk

615
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,600
about here and you know I mean then

616
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,880
forget it you can get somebody with

617
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:52,400
alzheimer's even backtrack even more to

618
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:56,200
to where they remember all a sudden a

619
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:59,000
relative's name or a sibling's name or

620
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:00,840
something and um or a loved one's name

621
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,679
and they remember and you can go even

622
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:05,640
further than that but nobody knows that

623
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:09,760
yet by the way you guys so so so the

624
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:11,600
deal is the deal is with Vitiligo is you

625
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:14,720
get this aluminum it's sitting inside

626
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:16,840
sitting inside the liver and aluminum is

627
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:20,640
is a

628
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:22,600
destructive destructive industrial Toxin

629
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,440
and how did you get aluminum inside your

630
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:26,399
liver what do you mean you just we pass

631
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:28,720
it on from generation to

632
00:24:26,399 --> 00:24:31,480
generation how do you get how do you get

633
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,360
aluminum inside the uh liver I mean

634
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:35,240
medical practices there's there's

635
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:38,440
Medical Treatments that just are filled

636
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:41,039
with aluminum I mean everything

637
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:43,799
deodorant for you young adults using

638
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:46,559
lots of aluminum based deodorant I mean

639
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:49,600
aluminum in in toothpaste I mean just

640
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:50,919
loads of aluminum in everything aluminum

641
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,600
in the water

642
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:55,440
supply there's aluminum in everything I

643
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,520
mean it's just we're saturated in

644
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,679
aluminum just like where we got so much

645
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:04,399
mer pery going on but that aluminum

646
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:06,600
that's responsible for viigo so what do

647
00:25:04,399 --> 00:25:08,679
would so you know where I'm going right

648
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:10,799
you you you guys know where I'm going

649
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:13,279
you know where I'm heading I hope hope

650
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:14,360
you know where I'm heading so that

651
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,360
that's what's going on with that

652
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:18,520
aluminum so that aluminum with along

653
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:20,399
with a really you know high-fat diet

654
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:22,919
which is basically standard American and

655
00:25:20,399 --> 00:25:25,480
even and even healthy

656
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:27,760
American that that high fat those High

657
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:29,279
fats whether they're even healthy fats

658
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:32,000
too they

659
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:33,960
oxidize they oxidize that aluminum and

660
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,760
then something else has to happen I'm

661
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:38,120
telling you a story it's like a bedtime

662
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:40,159
story it's like a nice little bedtime

663
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:42,880
story I'm telling

664
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:45,240
you it's like a bedtime story I mean you

665
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:48,120
know or it's like a campfire a Scary

666
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:50,840
Campfire story you know so then there's

667
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:54,120
something else that has to be there

668
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:56,600
inside our liver it can't just be

669
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:59,279
aluminum and then the fats building up

670
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:02,919
inside the liver and then the oxidizing

671
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:04,960
of the aluminum the expansion of the

672
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:08,240
aluminum there has to be one other thing

673
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,520
you you know what it is it's a virus

674
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,480
it's a

675
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:16,840
virus and so the

676
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:20,200
virus has to be present really low grade

677
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:24,399
not even anything serious the

678
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:27,399
mildest low grade viral

679
00:26:24,399 --> 00:26:30,360
condition yes Epstein bar is a big big

680
00:26:27,399 --> 00:26:34,559
big one for this but other viruses can

681
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:38,760
do it too all the hh's all the HH v6s

682
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:41,600
and sevens and the hh10 and 11s you

683
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:43,399
epine bar is a common one that does it

684
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:46,840
and even the shingles inside the liver

685
00:26:43,399 --> 00:26:48,360
can do this I mean it can there's a lot

686
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,840
of different herpetic viruses that can

687
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:52,679
sit inside the liver I mean there's so

688
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:54,480
many there's multitudes of them and so

689
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:56,600
when that virus and that Epstein bar

690
00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:00,200
sitting inside the liver it

691
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:02,799
feeds it feeds off of the aluminum now

692
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:04,240
in the case of eimos soris it has to

693
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:07,320
feed off of

694
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:09,080
copper it has to feed off of copper to

695
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:11,840
give you the

696
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:13,840
eczema but in in when it comes down to

697
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:17,000
Vitiligo it has to feed off of the

698
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:18,799
aluminum runoff the aluminum expansion

699
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,559
the aluminum that's blowing up the

700
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:23,799
aluminum that's

701
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:26,360
oxidizing it has to feed off the

702
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:29,840
aluminum and it does it feeds off this

703
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:33,000
industrial toxin yes this industrial

704
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:34,840
Toxin and you know I mean

705
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,240
seriously

706
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:40,240
seriously and and what happens is that

707
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,440
when the virus feeds off the industrial

708
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,519
toxin aluminum the the runoff the

709
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:48,080
oxidative Alum aluminum it then goes the

710
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:49,679
bathroom it eats it which is something

711
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,320
else research and science doesn't even

712
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:54,640
know the viruses eat they eat to stay

713
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:57,600
alive they eat to reproduce they eat to

714
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,880
stay stay functioning they they fuel

715
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:02,799
they fuel themselves right through the

716
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:04,880
membrane of the virus they fuel

717
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:06,360
themselves and research and science

718
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,000
doesn't know that yet and if they do

719
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:10,080
know it they don't want you to know it

720
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,679
how about that okay if you think they're

721
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,679
that smart then let's give them benefit

722
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:15,240
of Doubt and say they do know it but how

723
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,159
come they won't tell anybody how come

724
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:19,600
they tell everybody that viruses don't

725
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:22,519
eat anything well then you know then

726
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,559
they're lying to you okay whatever

727
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:25,159
however you want to look at it they're

728
00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:26,559
lying if they know or they're they're

729
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:28,200
stupid they don't know whatever you want

730
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:31,799
to do whatever whichever direction you

731
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:34,240
want to go so and you know so viruses

732
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:36,600
they feed off and then they release it

733
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:40,320
when they release a poison the poison

734
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:44,960
has to go to the skin it has to travel

735
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:49,720
and go to the skin aluminum oxidative

736
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:53,880
methyl aluminum being eliminated from a

737
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:56,240
virus creates a type of dermatoxin a

738
00:28:53,880 --> 00:29:00,080
different kind of

739
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:05,880
dermatoxin that that inevitably can

740
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:08,200
affect yes affect pigment creating cells

741
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:11,880
so it can affect the melanocytes it can

742
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:14,519
affect the melanin it can affect it and

743
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:16,880
what happens is when that toxin surfaces

744
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:18,480
to those pigment cells there's a

745
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,760
reaction that happens that science and

746
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,480
research will never touch upon I mean

747
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:25,159
honestly not in my lifetime and I don't

748
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:27,559
even know if our in our children's

749
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:30,159
lifetime or their lifetime I just don't

750
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:32,640
know if they can go there it's just too

751
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:36,159
advanced it's pain it's

752
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:38,200
painful and so you know what happens is

753
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,360
that that dermatoxin it becomes a

754
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,960
dermatoxin it surfaces the areas of the

755
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:45,600
body different skin

756
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:49,760
areas and it explodes the cells there's

757
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:51,720
a reaction that occurs with a pigment to

758
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:54,000
oxidative aluminum that's been

759
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:56,840
eliminated out of a

760
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,399
virus that's been eliminated out of a

761
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:00,640
virus

762
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:03,399
and it's in a different

763
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:07,640
state and so it it it's it's in a

764
00:30:03,399 --> 00:30:10,120
corruptive state and that poison

765
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:13,000
industrial poison and viruses are

766
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:14,760
industrial too yeah they are got to say

767
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,799
it they're industrial too many of them

768
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:19,600
not all of them but many many of them

769
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:22,399
are industrial and so this industrial

770
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:24,000
this all of this it's an industry thing

771
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:25,360
so that's why I said hats off to medical

772
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,120
research and science when they're like

773
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,519
exposure to Industrial chemicals which

774
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:31,760
they meant you're just working in a

775
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:34,880
factory and you've been sprayed by brake

776
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:37,880
cleaner carburetor cleaner you know some

777
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:40,480
kind of cleaning agent that's you know

778
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:42,600
just toxic no I'm not talking about and

779
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:45,960
what happens with those is those can

780
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:47,240
those have aluminum in it yes all that

781
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,840
could have aluminum in it but they don't

782
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:51,600
know that meaning they don't know that's

783
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:53,120
what's happening and that aluminum can

784
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,799
go into the liver so if you're somebody

785
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,039
exposed to a lot more toxic chemicals

786
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,720
than somebody else then you're getting

787
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:59,679
more aluminum and then more aluminum

788
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:02,480
goes inside the liver then more than it

789
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:04,399
can do what it's doing and oxid oxidize

790
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,880
and expand and everything I just said it

791
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:07,880
can

792
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:10,320
do and there's different varieties of

793
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:12,440
Vitiligo because there's different

794
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,840
situations it it all depends on where

795
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:17,240
the toxins traveling in someone someone

796
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:19,279
may exercise a lot someone may be active

797
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:20,840
it it can travel further it can go into

798
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:22,080
different places it could go to all

799
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:24,120
kinds of different areas it can go to

800
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,519
the eyes it can go to the it can go to

801
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:28,320
the ears it can go to the the lymphatic

802
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:30,000
system of often times it goes to the

803
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,600
face on a lot of people because it heads

804
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,039
up to the lymphatic system goes to the

805
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,600
knees because the lymphatic system can

806
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:37,880
you know it all depends on what they're

807
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,679
doing do they sit on the couch a lot do

808
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:42,279
they sit on the couch a lot with their

809
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:44,200
feet up and they watch TV you know like

810
00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:45,960
like like I do too much of yeah no I

811
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:49,720
wish I had the time to do

812
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:51,679
that that's my dream that's my dream

813
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:54,399
okay is to actually take one day off

814
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:56,480
writing the books and actually watch

815
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:58,519
watch a funny show or something or watch

816
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,480
a funny movie maybe I'll be able to do

817
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:02,960
it 10 years from

818
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:05,320
now maybe people maybe people are

819
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,559
sitting on the couch a lot maybe they're

820
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:10,559
standing all day or maybe they're

821
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:13,480
working and standing all day maybe

822
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:16,240
they're sitting all day maybe people are

823
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:18,679
exercising more maybe people aren't

824
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,360
maybe people you everything is different

825
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:21,919
with someone also how their liver is

826
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,559
working how their liers functioning are

827
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:24,840
there other poisons and toxins and

828
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:27,360
different things and bugs and other

829
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:30,480
stuff inside their livers everything is

830
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:32,799
different to how it can develop like

831
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:35,760
where the dermatoxin can lie where the

832
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:38,360
dermatoxin can go and travel to what

833
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:41,240
joint to what part of the body to what

834
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:43,200
area to what lymphatic area to through

835
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:46,320
the bloodstream to what direction

836
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:48,159
because you remember the liver releases

837
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:50,399
all this stuff right out of the

838
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:52,120
bloodstream right up through the you

839
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:53,559
know Paddock portal vein right up to the

840
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:55,720
heart right up to it pumps through the

841
00:32:53,559 --> 00:32:57,519
body and then it you know it finds its

842
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:01,200
way in all kinds of areas and lymphatic

843
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:04,799
system and every else and it travels and

844
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:08,200
travels and so you know it can give you

845
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:12,120
different situations with this now why

846
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:14,760
does stress play a role as a

847
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:17,000
trigger stress is a trigger isn't it

848
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,159
interesting whoa it's a it's a you know

849
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,720
and that's the thing that's what's funny

850
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:21,200
about research in science I hate being

851
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:23,200
that hard on Research in science because

852
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,200
I love science I absolutely love it

853
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,440
because how can I not love it what

854
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,960
spirit gives me is nothing but science

855
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,480
science that's undiscovered but nothing

856
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:34,039
but science how can I not love

857
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:35,559
science so you know yeah okay there's

858
00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:36,960
bogus science out there in the world

859
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:38,559
yeah and it's the thumbs on the scale

860
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,760
like I said so but the point is I still

861
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:42,399
love the fact that there's science and

862
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,799
there's good science too I mean there's

863
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:45,519
fantastic stuff out there too it's

864
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:49,840
amazing achievements going on out there

865
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:54,279
it's incredible but the bottom line is

866
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:56,159
the bottom line is is this is that you

867
00:33:54,279 --> 00:33:57,760
know science comes up with oh well

868
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:01,559
stress can trigger

869
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:03,840
viigo okay yeah well why and how is that

870
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:05,559
50 years from now we learn or is that 80

871
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:08,079
years from now we learn no learn this

872
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:09,800
now learn it now okay I and I've been

873
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,800
talking about this for years going back

874
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:14,040
and back and back I love when someone

875
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,359
says says to me oh you've been you're

876
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:18,079
the medical meeting what when did you

877
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:19,720
start three years ago or something oh

878
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,960
three years ago oh how about when I was

879
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:23,639
three years old well it's four years old

880
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:25,679
but you know what I mean it's four years

881
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:27,599
old is when it started but I just you

882
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:29,119
know I'm just saying if someone says how

883
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,720
when did you start 5 years ago I'd be

884
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:33,200
like yeah how about 5 years

885
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:36,200
old you know how about when I was a

886
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:37,960
child is what I mean and so you know the

887
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,399
bottom line is with stress is stress is

888
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:41,240
a trigger for a couple of reasons

889
00:34:39,399 --> 00:34:44,040
because what stress does is stress

890
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:46,240
weakens the immune system and then

891
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,520
allows a virus to actually Thrive a

892
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:49,240
little better remember I said you have

893
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,599
to have a virus inside the liver too so

894
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:52,200
people with Vitiligo have to have a

895
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:53,599
little bit of Epstein bar sitting inside

896
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,639
the liver also they have to have the

897
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:57,200
aluminum and it aluminum has to be also

898
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:59,520
oxidizing from a high fat diet

899
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:04,079
throughout the years years

900
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:05,800
before and so what happens is the stress

901
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,320
the stress lowers the immune system a

902
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,760
little bit which gives the Epstein B

903
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:11,040
virus a little bit more of a kick it

904
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,320
could it actually fuel itself eat a

905
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:15,160
little bit more now how does it fuel

906
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,560
itself because of adrenaline too you're

907
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:19,680
under a lot of stress you're under a lot

908
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:21,240
of adrenaline adrenaline feeds viruses I

909
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,119
talk about that in medical medium book

910
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:26,240
one you know adrenaline feeds

911
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:29,119
viruses and when adrenaline feeds

912
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:31,839
viruses then viruses fuel up they get

913
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:33,480
stronger um and so therefore you have

914
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:34,720
the stress trigger right there you see

915
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:38,040
how it

916
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:41,160
works so it's a really important to

917
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:42,560
understand and um because because we're

918
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:44,760
going to be under stress but we can do

919
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:47,920
something about it look I'm under stress

920
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:50,640
I'm under stress I'm always under stress

921
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:53,079
and um I'm sure I'm sure a lot of you

922
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:55,560
guys are too I'm sure a lot of you guys

923
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:59,200
are too I mean I mean it's easy to be

924
00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:02,160
under that it's easy to be under that so

925
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:04,720
stress is a big trigger but but just

926
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:08,880
saying stress is a trigger is is an

927
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:12,800
insult what about the answers to why it

928
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:15,119
is you know and that's how you win you

929
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,640
win when you have the answers you win

930
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:19,680
when you have the truth you win when you

931
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:21,880
know what to do what can we do now what

932
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:25,079
can we do well we certainly can't lower

933
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:26,440
our stress really I mean we can try to

934
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:28,280
we can take care of ourselves the best

935
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:30,440
we can we can try to lower our stress we

936
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:31,880
can try to take care of ourselves in

937
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:33,640
different ways sure there's ways of

938
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:35,240
lowering stress I mean in medical medium

939
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:38,440
book one I did all the healing

940
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:41,160
meditations in there and you know

941
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:43,280
there's there's lots of ways to cope and

942
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:47,839
deal with our stress and really

943
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:49,720
help but even with that being said the

944
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:53,359
crap's still going to hit the fan

945
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:54,960
somewhere it always does I mean you know

946
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:56,680
there you always still have to die out

947
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,599
fires and I talk about that all the time

948
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:02,359
there's always fires to die

949
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:04,400
out and that's how life is so we can't

950
00:37:02,359 --> 00:37:06,640
control that we can't have this full

951
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:10,800
control over that so what do we do one

952
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:14,760
of the things we do is we a we get the

953
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:17,960
aluminum out of our liver to get rid of

954
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:19,720
Vitiligo we do that by eating better we

955
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:22,640
do that by eating a little bit of a

956
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:25,359
lower fat diet whatever aisle you sit on

957
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:27,440
whatever that is and I you know and I'm

958
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:29,000
not into the propaganda thing just

959
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,920
everybody's throwing propaganda at

960
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:34,560
themselves at each other out there I'm

961
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:36,240
not into that I'm not into like in naleo

962
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:38,000
picking on the vegans like they do and

963
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,079
the plant-based people which I think is

964
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,200
totally unfair because the plant-based

965
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:45,119
people it's very small it's it's just a

966
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:48,079
very small crew in the country it's

967
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:49,960
really small when you think about it and

968
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:52,440
then you know and then the mediating

969
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:54,800
World um why are the hospitals filled

970
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:56,920
and filled filled with sick people and

971
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:59,400
oh my God dentist offices are filled

972
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:02,440
with rotting teeth I mean drilling root

973
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:05,280
canal root canals pulling teeth implants

974
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:06,880
dentures and they're not all vegans I

975
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,800
mean the vegans are really small so it's

976
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,760
unfair when the paleos do that and then

977
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:13,280
the vegans pick on the Paleo people and

978
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:14,839
they pick on the uh and they pick on the

979
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,240
meat eaters which is you know which is

980
00:38:14,839 --> 00:38:19,480
unfair too which is unfair too because

981
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:21,560
then they throw at them you know all

982
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:23,640
kinds of stuff they throw out all kinds

983
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:25,599
of stuff at them and you know like I get

984
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:27,280
it but it's like they they're both

985
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:28,319
attacking each other and it's it's kind

986
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:31,319
of

987
00:38:28,319 --> 00:38:33,280
unfair because no one's using no one has

988
00:38:31,319 --> 00:38:35,640
the truth in their hand it's all like

989
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:37,480
they're throwing theories or bogus paid

990
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:39,560
science and studies to try to out

991
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:41,359
science themselves everybody's so upset

992
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:43,000
they're all out sciencing themselves

993
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:45,319
with bogus science with science it's

994
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,040
actually just crazy and it's just and

995
00:38:45,319 --> 00:38:48,920
they're just you know no we got higher

996
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,480
protein no we got higher protein we got

997
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,960
better this no we got better that and

998
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,960
it's just this battle out there

999
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:58,079
meanwhile people are just staying

1000
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:59,280
sick because they don't know what to do

1001
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:00,640
and so what I'm saying is whether you're

1002
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,240
vegan or plant-based or whether you're

1003
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,240
paleo whether you're you're immediate or

1004
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:06,359
it doesn't matter to me what matters to

1005
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:09,480
me is you lower your

1006
00:39:06,359 --> 00:39:11,400
fats you lower them down you lower them

1007
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,680
your down you lower them down with viigo

1008
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,240
so what I'm trying to tell you is if

1009
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,960
you're you're a happy meat eater and you

1010
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,359
got

1011
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:20,760
Vitiligo cut the meats down to once a

1012
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:24,119
day not twice a day cut it down once a

1013
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:26,280
day maybe even once every other day you

1014
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:28,000
know throw an avocado in there whatever

1015
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,720
you want to do throw some other things

1016
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,880
throw an avocado in there throw throw a

1017
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:33,160
little bit of plant fat to offset it the

1018
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,520
plant Fat's a little easier in the

1019
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,720
system I'm just saying when you're sick

1020
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,400
with something and you have a liver

1021
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:39,680
problem like Vitiligo which is really a

1022
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:41,079
liver problem in the end yes you want to

1023
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:43,280
do that you want to lower your fats and

1024
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:45,160
if you're plant-based cut the nuts out

1025
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,800
cut the nuts out kill the nuts

1026
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:48,079
altogether I mean I love nuts and

1027
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,520
they're they're healthy they believe me

1028
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:51,720
they're healthy for people but if you

1029
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:54,640
got

1030
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:57,079
Vitiligo kill the nuts drop the nuts

1031
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:59,040
back watch the cash used drop them back

1032
00:39:57,079 --> 00:40:01,400
a little bit you know Watch the watch

1033
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:03,079
the walnuts drop them back a little bit

1034
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,720
watch the sunflower seats drop them back

1035
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:06,240
a little bit yeah maybe bring some more

1036
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:10,160
hemp seeds instead they're a little bit

1037
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:12,079
healthier you know and so so the point

1038
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:14,400
is is that we just got to lower the fats

1039
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:17,960
a little bit drop the oils both sides

1040
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:21,000
both sides drop the oils bring them

1041
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:22,880
down and then and then you because

1042
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,520
everybody's now gluten-free for the most

1043
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,400
Parts everybody's glut gluten- free

1044
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:28,000
they're wheat free they're gluten free

1045
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,880
most people are getting grainfree I mean

1046
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,560
you could still have quenan get rid of

1047
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:34,440
vtil you know Vio you can still do that

1048
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:37,680
get rid of Vio you can you can get

1049
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:40,640
quinoa you can get you know you can have

1050
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:42,760
Millet you can have you can even have

1051
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:46,040
some black beans in there and still get

1052
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:48,520
get get rid of viigo you can still do

1053
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:50,520
that you can still do that but just

1054
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:52,680
lower the fats because that's another

1055
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:55,119
thing too if you believe in oatmeal you

1056
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:57,560
can still get rid of Vitiligo because

1057
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,960
oatmeal essentially it's not it's not

1058
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:00,760
going to cause that much harm at all I

1059
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:03,000
mean it's it's actually I've seen it

1060
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:05,160
help people I've seen it help a lot of

1061
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,800
people doesn't hurt a lot of people I've

1062
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:09,000
seen it help people I've seen people

1063
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:11,839
heal from Vitiligo and still have

1064
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,839
oatmeal so it's there's this big war out

1065
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:16,720
there it's like no grains Everything is

1066
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:19,119
grainfree Everything no grain and high

1067
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:21,119
fat high protein high fat high protein

1068
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:22,240
and you know who suffers in the end from

1069
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:24,720
all that

1070
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:27,640
misinformation the person with Vitiligo

1071
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:29,280
the person with Hashimoto thyroid is the

1072
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:30,599
person with you know all kinds of

1073
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:33,400
different

1074
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:35,319
things you know whatever whatever I mean

1075
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,960
there's so many different illnesses I

1076
00:41:35,319 --> 00:41:39,160
mean I could bore you with the list it's

1077
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,240
just the list can go on but the bottom

1078
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:42,640
line is if you bring down those fats a

1079
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,920
little bit guess what's going to happen

1080
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:47,319
you're not going to oxidize the aluminum

1081
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:49,720
you're not going to oxidize the

1082
00:41:47,319 --> 00:41:52,160
aluminum the aluminum inside your liver

1083
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:54,280
if you have this condition if you have

1084
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:56,760
this condition you're not going to

1085
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:59,560
oxidize the aluminum

1086
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:01,160
and therefore that Viral issue you have

1087
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:03,640
inside the liver that's feeding off of

1088
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:07,760
the oxidized aluminum and feeding off of

1089
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:10,520
that crusted aluminum in there that's

1090
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:12,680
expanding from oxidizing from the high

1091
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:14,480
fats if the virus isn't able the feed

1092
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:15,960
off of all the oxidation you just won

1093
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,480
the battle right there by lowering your

1094
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:20,000
fats in your diet and I don't care what

1095
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:22,839
trend I don't care what expert goes on

1096
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,440
some show where there's a TV show that's

1097
00:42:22,839 --> 00:42:27,599
common where a bunch of doctors I don't

1098
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:28,839
care who's on what

1099
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:31,599
they still don't know about these

1100
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:32,920
chronic illnesses I know that for a fact

1101
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:35,559
that they don't know about these chronic

1102
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:37,760
illnesses and what's really behind them

1103
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:40,079
instead it's just all about eating in a

1104
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:42,240
trendy way that somebody believes in

1105
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:44,000
that some guy believes in that doesn't

1106
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:46,079
understand women's health is completely

1107
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,960
different and some guy who goes to the

1108
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:50,480
gym who never really had anything wrong

1109
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:52,400
with them as nice and fit and exercises

1110
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,520
every day doesn't know what it's like to

1111
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,599
have an illness or a condition like

1112
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:59,359
millions and millions of women out there

1113
00:42:56,599 --> 00:43:01,440
and men too but then all of a sudden

1114
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:04,240
it's like a spokesperson for some trendy

1115
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:07,359
diet so an Empire can be built that's

1116
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:09,079
demented it's deranged actually I'm

1117
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:11,079
talking about what about the answers to

1118
00:43:09,079 --> 00:43:12,599
getting people better what about that

1119
00:43:11,079 --> 00:43:13,800
what about the information to turn their

1120
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:14,880
lives around so what's the first thing

1121
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,280
we need to

1122
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,960
do first thing we need to do I said is

1123
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,800
we got to lower the fats no matter what

1124
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:22,839
aisle you sit on you got to lower the

1125
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,079
fats I'm not anti-animal protein I'm not

1126
00:43:22,839 --> 00:43:26,920
anti- plant-based I'm not

1127
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:30,040
anti-vegetarian you just I well

1128
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:32,440
you can't do eggs you can't do eggs in

1129
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:34,720
dairy products and yes of course nobody

1130
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:37,920
should be on gluten but you can't do

1131
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:40,240
eggs and dairy products I don't care

1132
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:42,440
what kind of dairy product you like if

1133
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:45,280
you got a condition you can't be doing

1134
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:47,240
it you're just going to feed viruses and

1135
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,599
feed the Epstein bars to create these

1136
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:52,960
conditions and everything else and you

1137
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:56,680
can't do it you got to keep those out

1138
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:58,920
you know I'm I'm tired of seeing

1139
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:01,040
egg is the perfect food out there cuz I

1140
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:03,480
know it's just going to create more PCOS

1141
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:05,520
in women more cysts more tumors more

1142
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:08,359
cancers more breast cancers from Epstein

1143
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:10,599
bar more conditions more multiple

1144
00:44:08,359 --> 00:44:12,359
sclerosis more fibromyalgia more Lyme

1145
00:44:10,599 --> 00:44:14,480
disease more whatever it's going to keep

1146
00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:16,160
on creating conditions and you know

1147
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:18,240
what's tricky you get tricked because

1148
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:20,079
you get a semi-healthy person like say

1149
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:22,920
somebody who's 29 years old or a woman

1150
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:24,720
that's 29 years old and and they're

1151
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:26,839
eating their eggs they're promoting it

1152
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:28,559
all online and they're all like eggs

1153
00:44:26,839 --> 00:44:30,599
eggs eggs and they don't you know and

1154
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:33,079
you just don't understand that you can't

1155
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:35,480
equate that to what can happen 15 years

1156
00:44:33,079 --> 00:44:37,400
down the road when they're sitting there

1157
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:38,680
getting like hysterectomies and when

1158
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:41,359
they're sitting there getting all kinds

1159
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:43,440
of problems because those eggs literally

1160
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:44,800
caused the worst fibroids down the road

1161
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,680
15 years down the road so it's a

1162
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,119
misconception same with men you know

1163
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:49,760
with the eggs and everything meanwhile

1164
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:52,559
when they end up getting prostate cancer

1165
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:54,319
when they're 58 years old and yeah it

1166
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:55,960
was all cute when they were 28 and

1167
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:57,800
saying they eat their two eggs a day

1168
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:59,400
they're on this new protocol and whatnot

1169
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:01,160
meanwhile the egg is feeding the epine

1170
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:02,359
bar virus inside the prostate creating

1171
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:05,440
prostate cancer they end up with

1172
00:45:02,359 --> 00:45:07,319
prostate cancer at at 58 it's all fun in

1173
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:09,640
games and it's all deception and

1174
00:45:07,319 --> 00:45:12,720
deceiving and nobody really knows how it

1175
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:14,480
works so keep away from the eggs so we

1176
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,760
don't want to eat the eggs we don't want

1177
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:18,400
to do that don't want to feed the

1178
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:21,880
viruses that create Vitiligo the other

1179
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:25,400
thing is we want to remove the toxic

1180
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:28,079
heavy metals out of our liver that's the

1181
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:29,920
other people that's so critical and

1182
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:32,680
that's that's the key removing the

1183
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:36,359
aluminum and the aluminum runoff the

1184
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:38,040
aluminum oxidation so we lower the fats

1185
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:40,079
we lower the fats we get rid of

1186
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:42,359
instigators that feed viruses so there's

1187
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:44,119
a few steps you have to do and you can

1188
00:45:42,359 --> 00:45:47,160
do one of these steps and get

1189
00:45:44,119 --> 00:45:49,400
improvements with Vitiligo you can you

1190
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:51,520
can reverse that condition you can

1191
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:55,480
literally reverse that condition there's

1192
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:57,280
ways of doing it and being free so what

1193
00:45:55,480 --> 00:46:01,280
happens is you lower the fats in the

1194
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:03,160
diet like I said that alone stops the

1195
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:06,040
ability or slows down the ability to

1196
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:08,200
oxidize the aluminum then you remove

1197
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:10,400
foods like the eggs and the dairy

1198
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:13,599
products and the gluten that feed

1199
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:15,480
Epstein bar virus or other viruses so so

1200
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:17,839
that they don't keep on proliferating

1201
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:19,559
and growing stronger and then feeding

1202
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:23,559
off of the aluminum so that's another

1203
00:46:19,559 --> 00:46:25,440
step that's another step third step now

1204
00:46:23,559 --> 00:46:27,960
you're now it's about removing the

1205
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:31,319
alumin itself and if you can only do

1206
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:32,400
that step hey I'm fine I'm totally fine

1207
00:46:31,319 --> 00:46:34,400
and you know the thing is with the

1208
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:36,400
celery juice the celery juice movement

1209
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,119
that Spirit started and that you guys

1210
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,839
you know you guys took off on I mean

1211
00:46:38,119 --> 00:46:41,680
honestly because you guys are Champs and

1212
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:43,400
did the celery juice and changing your

1213
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:46,319
your life and other people's lives it's

1214
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:48,160
unbelievable the celery juice the celery

1215
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:50,480
juice alone is helping people with

1216
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:53,079
Vitiligo I hear about it all the time

1217
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:54,960
you do because the celery juice the the

1218
00:46:53,079 --> 00:46:56,200
the cluster salt sodium salts that I

1219
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,960
talked about in Facebook Faceook live

1220
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:59,880
and I talk about it go check out the

1221
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:04,280
Facebook live someday too that I did on

1222
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:06,599
on celery it it you know it the celery

1223
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:09,319
sodium celery salts what what it does is

1224
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:11,400
it dissolves the membrane on the viruses

1225
00:47:09,319 --> 00:47:13,200
like the like the surface membrane and

1226
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:14,640
it starts to destroy the epine bar virus

1227
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:17,000
that's why celery juice is so critical

1228
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:19,559
for Vitiligo and critical for every

1229
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:22,079
disease illness condition and symptom

1230
00:47:19,559 --> 00:47:25,800
celery juice everything across the board

1231
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:29,160
it's good for so you got that going

1232
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:32,480
going on okay but the heavy metal detox

1233
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:35,680
smoothie the heavy metal detox smoothie

1234
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:37,839
spirulina the barley grass juice powder

1235
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:40,520
okay the spirulina the barley grass

1236
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:42,720
juice powder don't get confused I saw

1237
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:45,960
somebody get barley grass powder no no

1238
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:47,240
no no barleygrass juice powder so you

1239
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:49,359
know and then you get spiruline the

1240
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:51,640
barley grass juice powder you got the

1241
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:54,079
you got that and I like vimergy I like

1242
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:56,720
vimergy for those and then you got like

1243
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:58,640
and then you you know you got the the

1244
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:00,839
cilantro in there you got the wild

1245
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:03,319
blueberries you know the whole deal you

1246
00:48:00,839 --> 00:48:06,240
know the drill a little bit of dols

1247
00:48:03,319 --> 00:48:08,240
these in the combination can get into

1248
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:11,319
the liver the heavy metal detox smoothie

1249
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:13,319
into the liver bind onto aluminum runoff

1250
00:48:11,319 --> 00:48:16,640
bind on to aluminum and start bringing

1251
00:48:13,319 --> 00:48:18,800
it out so if you do these steps you do

1252
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:21,760
the heavy metal detox smoothie you do

1253
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:24,079
the celery juice you take eggs and dairy

1254
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:25,359
and gluten out of the diet and that's

1255
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:27,400
the thing there's people that get a

1256
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:29,559
little better with Vitiligo and other

1257
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:32,000
things because they took gluten out but

1258
00:48:29,559 --> 00:48:33,520
yet here's the here's the irony I mean

1259
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,119
here's what's unbelievable yet the

1260
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:36,480
practitioner or the program that it was

1261
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:38,200
in or the cleanse it was in or the

1262
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:40,000
doctor that that was talking about it or

1263
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:41,839
whatever was on television or whatever

1264
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,640
whoever was talking about the gluten

1265
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:45,160
doesn't even know the gluten was feeding

1266
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:48,240
the

1267
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:50,000
virus that was behind any illness or

1268
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:52,480
condition the person was suffering

1269
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,359
from and so you take out the eggs the

1270
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:56,400
gluten the you know the you take out the

1271
00:48:54,359 --> 00:48:58,200
milk the cheese the butter but you take

1272
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,359
all of it I don't care if it's grass-fed

1273
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:02,200
butter you get rid of it because it's

1274
00:49:00,359 --> 00:49:04,200
going to feed a viral condition keep the

1275
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:05,880
Vitiligo around but you take those out

1276
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:07,440
then you lower your fats a little bit so

1277
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:09,440
if you like animal proteins bring them

1278
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:11,760
down a notch if you got a really bad

1279
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:14,200
case of Vitiligo bring them down more

1280
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:16,079
every other day every other day you do

1281
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:17,040
it and then you know you do other things

1282
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:20,280
other

1283
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:21,960
days and that's that's how you do it

1284
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:23,520
that's the power of it that's the power

1285
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:25,079
of the foods and the different that's

1286
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:27,359
what's in your hand so I can hand you

1287
00:49:25,079 --> 00:49:29,839
the golden t like I said which are these

1288
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:32,319
things which can totally turn around

1289
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:34,680
Vitiligo or you know or you can smack it

1290
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:39,880
out of my hand whatever whatever

1291
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:42,119
whatever and um so here's the deal okay

1292
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:43,680
if it's overwhelming if this is too much

1293
00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:45,240
and you just these things are too much

1294
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:47,319
alone like you might be saying well what

1295
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:49,280
do I eat how do I eat what do I do how

1296
00:49:47,319 --> 00:49:52,480
do I do it you know the medical medium

1297
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:54,480
the 28 day um eating with the 28-day

1298
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:56,559
eating cleanse and medical medium that's

1299
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:58,520
a good way of actually really jumping

1300
00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:00,520
ahead so whether you're a meat eater or

1301
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:02,839
you're plant-based you do this for a

1302
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:05,480
month and you jump ahead another thing

1303
00:50:02,839 --> 00:50:07,799
too is a thyroid the 90-day thyroid you

1304
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:10,839
know healing and and um and thyroid

1305
00:50:07,799 --> 00:50:12,400
healing the the 90 days where you just

1306
00:50:10,839 --> 00:50:14,280
work on your thyroid where you got three

1307
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:16,359
months and you work in there you can

1308
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:18,760
pick a month any month in there can help

1309
00:50:16,359 --> 00:50:21,319
with figgo it can help with the liver it

1310
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:23,559
can help with all of it but keeping your

1311
00:50:21,319 --> 00:50:25,680
fats low bringing in more fruits and

1312
00:50:23,559 --> 00:50:27,599
vegetables don't be don't don't have

1313
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:30,319
fruit fear if you have fruit fear then

1314
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:34,240
you're going to have a difficult time

1315
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:35,960
healing and and and reversing thego

1316
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:39,160
you're going to have a more difficult

1317
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:40,839
time so you want to make sure that

1318
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:42,640
you're not afraid of fruits you're not

1319
00:50:40,839 --> 00:50:44,400
afraid of more apples you're not afraid

1320
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,880
of a few grapes you're not afraid of

1321
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,680
some banana you're not afraid of these

1322
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:51,200
things these things are really important

1323
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:53,720

know the thing is with tomatoes is I get

1335
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,520
really kind of emotional about it for a

1336
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:22,520
second because they're under attack

1337
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:25,599

1340
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:32,799
get them using Tomatoes they don't get

1341

certain cancers so they actually don't

1342
00:51:32,799 --> 00:51:37,000
get problems with their eyes so they

1343
00:51:34,359 --> 00:51:39,200
don't get glaucoma so they don't get eye

1344
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,680
eye degeneration so they don't get all

1345
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:44,799
