00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,200
information we offer it's well known at

00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,320
this point what we're doing at the

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,200
medical medium series books and how this

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,000
information is decades ahead of what's

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,440

00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,640

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,079
basically what that means is things like

22
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,480
liver flushing liver Stones we're going

23
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:58,399
to talk all about that that's

24
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,600
interesting right I think it is and it's

25
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,680
important to know we're going to talk

26
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,439
about eating liver how about that one

27
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,360
what about Ox bile and you know this is

28
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:08,159
out of the liver rescue book but just

29
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,159
please know that this is a

30
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:14,479
fraction of what's in Liver Rescue and

31
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:17,520
it's literally a fraction like just a

32
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:20,119
grain of rice to a silo of rice as far

33
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,000
as what's in Liver Rescue and even in

34
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:23,600
the section the chapter in Liver Rescue

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,119
about myths and you know liver myths and

36
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,040
so forth so um even with this this is

37
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:29,920
just a couple of things compared to

38
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,960
what's in there so just letting you know

39
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,240
so you don't think oh I heard about that

40
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:36,119

41
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,360

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,399
Rescue is decades ahead ahead of what's

46
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:50,719
out there now that's the whole point you

47
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:52,399

50
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,880

00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,119
that important I see people struggling

57
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:12,080
out there for many years I've helped

58
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:14,319
thousands of people over the years

59
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,800
celery juice the very thing we started

60
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,480
uh medical medium uh the series started

61
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,959
you know back a few years ago and even

62
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,239
before that I started celery juice um

63
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,239
getting it out there for people that's

64
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:27,239
taking the World by storm helping people

65
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:29,959
recover in so many ways and it's so

66
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:31,599
helpful for the liver too and it's still

67
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:33,959
the very little is known about celery

68
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,760
juice except for here the source of

69
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:37,519
where it started and we're going to talk

70
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,120
about celery juice a little with this

71
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,920
because when you're dealing with things

72
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,239
like liver stones and you're doing liver

73
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,800
flushes and you're you're trying to get

74
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:47,840
your bile better by taking Ox bile

75
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,000
really what you need is celery juice but

76
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,120
we're going to go into the myths and

77
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,440
we're going to take a look at this and

78
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,760
see where we're starting let's start

79
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:58,040
with eating liver okay so eating liver's

80
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,760
been around for a while you guys know

81
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:02,599
that you've heard of that right you have

82
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,319
turkey turkey uh stuffing might have the

83
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:06,640
turkey Liz turkey gizzards in there

84
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:09,159
whatever you call them about to say

85
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,640
lizards the tur turkey liver right

86
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:15,959
chicken liver um that's something that

87
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:17,599
you know people do eat cow liver um so

88
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:20,120
liver is actually something that's

89
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:23,080
that's been around people eat it they

90
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:24,640
fry it in a pan they bake it in the oven

91
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,360
they broil it or whatever and they do

92
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,080
things with liver and the the reason

93
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,840
people eat liver there's two reasons I

94
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,959
always say one reason is they like the

95
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,159
taste so that's one reason the other

96
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,760
reason they think they're getting

97
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,439
something they think they're getting

98
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,680
something nutritious something yummy

99
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:42,000
something good in them not just good

100
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,159
yummy but something that's really

101
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,879
fortified something that's get building

102
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:49,000
their blood giving them iron building up

103
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,560
their you know building up their blood

104
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,079
building their hemoglobin building up

105
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,720
their whole you know all kinds of

106
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:55,200
different things but that's not how it

107
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,959
works it's not how it works I'm going to

108
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,640
go into this right now and this is just

109
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,840
a fun one to start with before we get

110
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:04,079
into Ox bile and liver flushes and liver

111
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,200
Stones so you guys are going to have a

112
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:07,799
good time I'm having a good time but

113
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,920
it's really it's really this is like one

114
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:12,519
of one of my favorite things to talk

115
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,680
about because it just goes to show you

116
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:18,639
how misinformation travels and becomes

117
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,160
law or travels and becomes some kind of

118
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,040
like popular Trend or something

119
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,680
meanwhile is it really helping no it's

120
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,520
not eating liver is really not a good

121
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:29,080
thing it's highly toxic so you have to

122
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,680
know how things work the the a liver in

123
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,240
an animal

124
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,360
is there to collect poison that's what a

125
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,880
liver is doing it's there to collect

126
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:41,400
poison bottom line our livers are

127
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,759
collecting poison you wouldn't want to

128
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:47,120
eat somebody else's liver fill the toxic

129
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:49,479
heavy metals in there petrochemicals

130
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,840
solvents Plastics

131
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:54,479
Pharmaceuticals you you wouldn't want to

132
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,880
eat another person's liver yeah of

133
00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:00,120
course you wouldn't want to duh right

134
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:02,680
the whole bit but seriously though

135
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,240
can you imagine can you imagine and you

136
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,560
know what the same thing with the cow's

137
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,199
liver there's still all kinds of

138
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,440
pollutants all kinds of heavy metals all

139
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:13,479
kinds of toxins Generations from the

140
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:16,000
cow's life going back meaning before and

141
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:17,639
and and and so forth and and how the

142
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,360
cows were breed it doesn't matter if

143
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:23,160
it's grass-fed the the livers fill the

144
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,759
to poisons and toxins and and that

145
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,560
happens all I mean that's just the way

146
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:30,639
it is that's what the liver does

147
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:33,800
naturally even if planet Earth was PR de

148
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:37,479
with no mercury in the waterways and no

149
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:41,400
dioxins everywhere even if it was dioxin

150
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:43,560
free U Mercury free everything free you

151
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,880
know what's funny you know what's really

152
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,840
funny and this has nothing to do with me

153
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,560
liking animal protein or not or whatever

154
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,919
or not or liking veganism or not or

155
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:54,280
liking plant-based or vegetarian or

156
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:56,560
whatever it is it you know it's it's

157
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:59,160
kind of funny we say you know grass-fed

158
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,479
grass-fed free range pasture you know

159
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,680
pasture ranged or whatever we just I'm

160
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:04,440
probably not even saying that right

161
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:07,400
right now you know what I mean we say

162
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:11,680
like whether it's homegrown okay free

163
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:14,479
range grass-fed however it works we say

164
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,120
all that right but what about the other

165
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:20,080
things too is it Mercury free is there

166
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,280
traces of mercury how much dioxin is in

167
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,800
is in there even some of the best parts

168
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:28,520
of this country here you can have cows

169
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,919
grazing in a field and build up dioxins

170
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:33,039
heavy inside the liver and build up

171
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:35,000
other things heavy inside the liver and

172
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,360
that's how what you have to understand

173
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,280
you know what I mean when somebody says

174
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,759
hey is it is it is it is it free range

175
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,560
is the whole bit well wait a minute is

176
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:45,800
it free of mercury is it free of dioxins

177
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,440
no one know no one would know who cares

178
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,560
nobody cares about any of that when it

179
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,360
comes down to livers when it comes down

180
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,360
to livers it matters it's just same same

181
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,319
thing with like with plant-based is it

182
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,800
organic yeah because you don't want

183
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:58,080
pesticides in there right you don't want

184
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,479
that kind of thing in there right but

185
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,000
still there's always dioxins and

186
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:02,479
everything and all that it's just that

187
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,919
with animal products that gets

188
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:07,360
concentrated more but still it's going

189
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:09,360
to be a dioxin inside a walnut without a

190
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,000
doubt there's there's going to be there

191
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,280
and no one's saying that like wait a

192
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,240
minute is this dioxin free you know it's

193
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,280
organic but wait a minute is it dioxin

194
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,720
free okay so back to being you know and

195
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,599
that has nothing to do whether I like

196
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:23,080
animal products or I'm or I like

197
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,440
plant-based or whatever I'm just telling

198
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:27,840
you how kind of funny that is but the

199
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,919
bottom line is with the liver it is

200
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:34,199
filled with dioxins it is filled with

201
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:36,520
dioxins it really is and animal livers

202
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:38,759
are loaded with them it's the place

203
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:41,039
where it's concentrated heavy duty

204
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:44,440
really concentrated if you're eating

205
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:48,159
liver you're getting a high dose a high

206
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:51,159
dose of metals dioxins and other

207
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:53,000
pollutants lots of other pollutants so

208
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:55,319
you always have to remember that and

209
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,360
depending on what you know if if is it

210
00:07:55,319 --> 00:08:00,159
really yeah it matters if it's grass-fed

211
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:03,039
it matters if it's not grain fed it

212
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:04,599
matters if it's not um if

213
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:08,639
Pharmaceuticals weren't used on the

214
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:10,599
animals that all matters it does because

215
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,759
then the liver would be yes more

216
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:15,759
polluted if you were to eat the liver

217
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:19,319
but the liver is not a place to gain

218
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:22,879
nutrition it's not a place to gain

219
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:26,280
nutrients or gain speed or gain anything

220
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:28,800
in health eating animal liver is

221
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:30,639
definitely something that's not helpful

222
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,680
whatsoever unless it's the only food

223
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,959
source you have you live somewhere in

224
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:38,440
the world and the only thing you can

225
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:39,880
find is an animal liver to eat then yes

226
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,440
okay you better believe it you should

227
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,800
eat it 100% you should eat that animal

228
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,440
liver

229
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,920
100% if it means survival if it means

230
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,120
that's going to put food on your table

231
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,640
for you and your family damn right you

232
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,839
you better eat it and put it on the

233
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:57,800
table and I support you a billion per.

234
00:08:54,839 --> 00:09:00,240
absolutely but if you have choices any

235
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:02,519
kind of choice whatever it is if you're

236
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,079
into animal products don't do the liver

237
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:06,560
do something else in the Animal product

238
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:09,120
that in the Animal product world that

239
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,880
you like absolutely so it's just you

240
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,000
know and really when it comes down to

241
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,800
the plant-based people they're not going

242
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,920
to be eating animal liver so unless

243
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:19,200
they're not really plant-based but if

244
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,720
they're really solely plant-based 100%

245
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,760
And and that's what they're they're

246
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,480
doing then they're not going to be

247
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,040
eating livers they're not going to eat

248
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,519
stuffing with chicken liver and it

249
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,920
they're not going to eat stuffing with

250
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:29,640
turkey liver so it's really I guess for

251
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,800
the animal protein people

252
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:34,880
just stay away from liver desiccated

253
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:36,760
liver and supplements stay the heck away

254
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,320
from desiccated liver and supplements

255
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,399
whatever you do if there's supplements

256
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,880
you're taking and you look at the

257
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:43,440
ingredient list and you're like oh my

258
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:47,000
God wait desiccated liver desiccated

259
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:49,920
kidney desec no no no no no get rid of

260
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,399
it get rid of it what what it really

261
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:56,360
should say be really should say is

262
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:58,360
desiccated dioxin you know infested

263
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,160
liver okay inside the supplement or

264
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,079
however you want to say it that's what

265
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,000
it should be something around like that

266
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:07,519
because in the end that's all it is so

267
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,519
yeah so eating livers out bad idea all

268
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:13,000
around and a terrible idea for your own

269
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:16,360
liver and that's the other part you want

270
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,279
to hurt your liver eat liver because

271
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:20,040
then your liver is going to have to

272
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:22,560
absorb everything that liver was trying

273
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:25,120
to absorb to protect that creature so as

274
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,079
that liver was protecting the cow or

275
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,680
whatever it is the Lamb or what whatever

276
00:10:27,079 --> 00:10:32,680
it is or the duck hey that's right duck

277
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:37,360
liver I forgot about that duck liver

278
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:39,279
right so so when that duck liver I'm I'm

279
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,160
pretty silly today apparently that duck

280
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:44,639
liver is protecting that duck and that

281
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,839
duck is you know swimming in whatever

282
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:50,120
Lake whatever Pond you know eating

283
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,519
whatever toxic algae eating getting

284
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:54,920
exposed to whatever toxic anything

285
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:57,880
environmentally environmental so that

286
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:59,959
liver is soaking all that poison up and

287
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:02,639
waterways are not clean clean I'm sorry

288
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:05,160
all waterways are not clean all of them

289
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:07,760
rivers in pristine country still is

290
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,519
polluted you know the craziest thing

291
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,480
about rivers you could be in the country

292
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,399
in the mountains and you could have the

293
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:16,519
stream rolling through and be like w it

294
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,720
just looks so clean as pristine we're up

295
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:22,279
here fresh air there's no nothing around

296
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:25,160
for Miles meanwhile you know back 50

297
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:27,880
years ago 50 years ago could be a shack

298
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:30,639
right on the side of that River a shack

299
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:33,000
that that was there from that 1940s

300
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:35,120
1950s and what they did in there was

301
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,399
they had all kinds of just stuff going

302
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,279
on and they were dealing with metals and

303
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:40,600
some kind of manufacturing or some

304
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:42,560
anything they were play they were

305
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,880
playing around in that shck I mean you'd

306
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,399
be surprised and it's just garbage and

307
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,040
crap I've been I've been in the woods

308
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:51,079
for most of my life in some of the most

309
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,519
pristine areas over the years especially

310
00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:55,440
when I was younger and I've I've hiked

311
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,120
up like pristine rivers and stuff like

312
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,519
that and then seen like an Old Mill that

313
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:03,680
was there that was there back 80 years

314
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:07,200
ago that's still bleeding tons of poison

315
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:09,200
into into the pristine so-called River

316
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,440
anything like that I've seen little

317
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,360
Shacks that that are on you know sides

318
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,480
of little streams like tiny little

319
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,480
streams and the Shacks like there's all

320
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:20,639
this rusted garbage in car parts and

321
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,480
mercury and thermometers and all this

322
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,120
garbage all sitting there by this little

323
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,560
stream but if you walked 2 miles down

324
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,480
the stream 3 miles down the stream the

325
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,240
stream would be like it's like pristine

326
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,680
and it's coming out of the mountain it's

327
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:35,639
like whatever yeah you just the bottom

328
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,560
line is everything's polluted in the

329
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:39,120
waterways even in the most you know

330
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:41,639
benign sense or whatever the most

331
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:44,160
minimal sense the serious sense so the

332
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:46,560
bottom line is you know what happens is

333
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,959
when you eat liver you're polluting your

334
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,120
liver your liver has to do all the

335
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:54,480
cleanup on that basically it's like hey

336
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:56,600
you got a filter your filters your liver

337
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,199
inside your body let's clog that filter

338
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,959
up faster 10 years faster than it would

339
00:12:59,199 --> 00:13:03,720
clog up from whatever the heck you're

340
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:05,079
doing wrong anyway how about that okay

341
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,360
so that's what it's like when you're

342
00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:09,360
about to eat liver be like hey I'm about

343
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,880

right here let me just speed the hell up

351
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:30,199
my liver dysfunction my stagnant sluggy

352
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:32,720
sluggy sluggish fatty liver let's just

353
00:13:30,199 --> 00:13:35,480
move that forward into Super stagnant

354
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,880
sluggish you know fatty liver fast

355
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,040
instead of it happening by the time

356
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,680
we're 40 and we get our hot flashes and

357
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,920
then we think it's hormones cuz doctors

358
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:44,279
have no idea it's just a liver problem

359
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:46,160
instead of getting you know instead of

360
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:47,600
the hot flashes and we gain weight and

361
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,839
all that cuz our liver gets sluggish why

362
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,560
don't we move that up quicker a 10 years

363
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,800
before that by keep on eating pieces of

364
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:56,480
liver that's how silly it is that's how

365
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,160
silly I look I can go on for that

366
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,800
forever with that one but we got better

367
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,759
ones to talk talk about anyway we got

368
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:05,360
bigger fish to fry we got bigger livers

369
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:07,320
to fry how about that one we got bigger

370
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,560
livers to fry that's actually really

371
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,839
funny all right I got to stop cracking

372
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:15,399
myself up you guys I think I'm a little

373
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:17,040
little too little too giggly today lot

374
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:20,000
of celery juice I

375
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:23,560
drank okay so let's go back let's go to

376
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,839
the next one let's talk about let's talk

377
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:29,320
about uh Ox B since we're on eating

378
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:32,120
things let's talk have you he about Ox

379
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:35,360
bile are you taking Ox bile to what

380
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:40,240
improve your B production or are you

381
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:43,240
taking Ox bile to digest food better oh

382
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:45,639
man this one this one look I'm not going

383
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:49,000
to be able to cover the whole Ox bile

384
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:50,759
myth or theory in this show so I'm going

385
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,560
to cover a good hunk of it move on to

386
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:54,639
liver Stones move on to liver flushing

387
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,920
and so forth but I'm going to cover a

388
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,880
piece of it if you want to hear the

389
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:01,720
whole story about Ox B you got to get

390
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,720
Liver Rescue you just got to get it and

391
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,800
you know so I mean bottom line you just

392
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,639
you just have to you have to just for

393
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:11,360
that and believe me that book is massive

394
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,880
I mean it's a huge huge book so you can

395
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,199
I mean there's so much information in

396
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:18,880
there um just this loan is worth the

397
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:21,040
price of admission and if you can't buy

398
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,120
a book cuz you don't have the money I

399
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,800
understand um I know I know people to be

400
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,440
like I I can't buy a book right now

401
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,800
things are that bad I be like we go to

402
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,880
the library and they like yeah you're

403
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,639
right and they're at the library and

404
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,000
they're taking out the book it's it's

405
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,279
the best thing ever it's such a great

406
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,759
service I love that service it's amazing

407
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:39,720
means a lot to me actually so here's the

408
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:42,759
deal dealing with Ox bile you're

409
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:45,079
consuming something that's actually has

410
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:47,480
undiscovered chemical compounds in it in

411
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:49,040
science of research that are damaging

412
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:52,040
see there's not enough science and

413
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,839
research to oxb because there isn't

414
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:58,279
going to be now if we were going to fund

415
00:15:54,839 --> 00:16:00,519
nasso we were going to fund space travel

416
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:02,759
fun funded like giving it infinite

417
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:04,839
funding you wouldn't believe where we

418
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:07,959
would be right now no one's going to

419
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:11,360
give oxp infinite funding in fact

420
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:13,680
nothing really good in general gets

421
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,120
infinite funing funding and even things

422
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,839
that are bad like oxp don't get infinite

423
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:21,519
funding so and it doesn't get indefinite

424
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:24,480
funding so the whole the whole point of

425
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,480
the matter is when it comes down to

426
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,199
something like

427
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:31,360
oxp is it's not good for us but what's

428
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:33,160
what's not good force in it still isn't

429
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,759
even really even discovered there's

430
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:37,399
really nothing going on with Ox B I mean

431
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,199
how much money has been dumped into the

432
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:40,680
research and the ramifications involved

433
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:43,040
in the body and everything else really

434
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:44,639
nothing so when you think about it that

435
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,959
alone's a little spooky but let me tell

436
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,279
you why it's bad let me tell you the

437
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:51,880
whole thing so when you're taking Ox

438
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:55,360
pile what you're doing is you're trying

439
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:57,000
to a it possibly improve or help your

440
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,560
liver and maybe the production of its

441
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,279
own bio Reserves and it's not going to

442
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:03,319
happen it's not going to happen that's

443
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:06,199
not even possible and I'll tell you why

444
00:17:03,319 --> 00:17:08,160
in a minute B you're trying to digest

445
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:09,880
your fats better you're trying to

446
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,039
actually you know disperse your fats

447
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:16,520
better which it won't because it's only

448
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:18,760
our bile that can do that it's only our

449
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:21,240
bile when we eat food we eat food and

450
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:22,880
it's identified by our body immediately

451
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,280
for the food it is the food we've been

452
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,720
eating for hundreds and hundreds and

453
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:28,079
hundreds and hundreds of years and even

454
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,520
go down thousands of years that's how it

455
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,559
works

456
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,679
and and it's our bile that disperses the

457
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:38,480
fats I mean that's just a fraction of

458
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:41,039
how it works so here's the deal first of

459
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,080
all when you put Ox in you you're

460
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:47,080
putting in what's kind of like a foreign

461
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:49,640
foreign alien kind of um you alien

462
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:53,000
substance inside the body so the liver

463
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:55,799
sees it as alien too it the makeup is

464
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,520
entirely different everything about Ox

465
00:17:55,799 --> 00:18:01,679
bile is entirely different than human

466
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:02,919
bile and that's important to understand

467
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,080
and you're not going to build up our

468
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:07,440
strengthen your liver's bile reserves

469
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:09,799
with Ox bile you're going to weaken it

470
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,320
what happens is if you want to weaken a

471
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:14,360
liver you throw in something to throw it

472
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,720
you throw in something to confuse it you

473
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:19,760
throw in something that completely

474
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,600
throws it off in every way possible and

475
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,080
that's not a good idea to begin with but

476
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,360
I'm going to go into the more heavy duty

477
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:27,679
reasons why it's just disastrous so

478
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,400
first of all Ox B's chemical compounds

479
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,840
and the structures inside are completely

480
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:34,080
different like I said earlier than human

481
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,120
B to begin with they're not going to

482
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,000
spend millions and millions of dollars

483
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:40,799
to to actually figure out what those

484
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,919
chemical compounds are so that alone is

485
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:45,919
actually dangerous to our liver and to

486
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:47,720
our body to to a point it's not the

487
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:51,400
worst thing in the world but it's not

488
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:55,120
good at all chemical compounds can be

489
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:57,360
life-altering in a bad way in a very bad

490
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,400
way with our health and here's one of

491
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,400
the reasons why it's not a good idea

492
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,799
concentrations are not going to be

493
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,919
appropriate no matter what an ox is a

494
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:08,840
gigantic animal compared to a human

495
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,480
being Ox bile the concentration of ox

496
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,559
bile versus the concentration of what

497
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,760
human bile is and those levels has

498
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:18,880
hasn't even been tapped into isn't even

499
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:20,960
understood so even if Ox bile was a good

500
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,000
thing in some way the concentrations

501
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,559
would be detrimentally off it would be a

502
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,200
bad situation as far as the

503
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,840
concentration levels you have to know

504
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:31,840
that so if you're taking some

505
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:33,480
idea of how much Ox B to take or some

506
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,159
company some pharmaceutical company that

507
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:37,200
wants to make money and benefit off of

508
00:19:35,159 --> 00:19:39,559
ox bile because it's a trend and you

509
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:42,400
want to take that the dosage itself is

510
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:44,200
not even going to even line up remotely

511
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,120
to what would be there it wouldn't it

512
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:48,720
would be impossible to know the dosage

513
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:50,480
on that on any level whatsoever so

514
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,919
that's something that's important to

515
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,919
understand and how is that important a

516
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:57,320
it's damaging to the liver it's a much

517
00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:59,120
more concentrated form and it's like an

518
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:02,600
alien source to to the liver so it's a

519
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:05,880
highly concentrated form of bile added

520
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:09,600
alien form to the liver the liver has a

521
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:11,360
right to produce bile it's a human right

522
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,880
that the liver has it's a working

523
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:17,480
chemical function of of almost 2,000 or

524
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,799
over 2,000 chemical functions that the

525
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:22,120
liver has science and research only know

526
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:24,240
of about 500 chemical functions that the

527
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:27,159
liver possesses and they don't really

528
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,919
know a lot about those 500 very little

529
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:31,200
at all if any

530
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:34,919
and with the liver really truthfully

531
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,880
having over 2,000 chemical functions how

532
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:38,880
is it possible to understand what's

533
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,240
going to happen when you pop in when you

534
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,600
pop in that Ox pile one thing that you

535
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:46,919
have to know is that the liver Has Its

536
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:49,720
Right to manage its own bio regulation

537
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:53,960
and it's all it cares about is managing

538
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:55,880
its own bio regulation you take Ox bile

539
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,880
it goes down into your gut down into

540
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,440
your intestinal tract then it goes

541
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,039
through through the walls of the

542
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,240
intestinal tract because it starts to

543
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:05,600
get assimilated it starts to get

544
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:08,120
absorbed when it gets absorbed that

545
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:10,840
absorption occurs it goes up the hepatic

546
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:14,400
portal vein up the highway heading to

547
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:16,360
the liver and it shocks the liver that's

548
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,400
how it works it's the wrong

549
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:20,360
concentrations because it's not a human

550
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,400
concentration to begin with that's

551
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:24,840
number one number two when it hits the

552
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,799
liver it can shock it can put it into

553
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,840
shock because the liver has never been

554
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,520
up against something like that before

555
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,960
it's it's it's almost equivalent to

556
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:34,600
doing something like totally crazy like

557
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,919
I mean I can't think anything off the

558
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:39,000
top of my head right now but it's like

559
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:41,240
it's like replacing a loved one with

560
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,360
another loved one but yet it almost

561
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:45,960
sounds the person almost sounds the same

562
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:48,240
has the same name bile okay the whole

563
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,600
bit think about it but it's not the same

564
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,400
person but the person's bile that's the

565
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,760
name of the person and it's almost like

566
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,159
you're trying to get along with this

567
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,000
person a whole bit it turns out wait a

568
00:21:55,159 --> 00:21:58,840
minute this isn't even this isn't even

569
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,760
my family member or this isn't even my

570
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:03,320
friend I mean that's not even a great

571
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:04,960
way of even you know you know kind of

572
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,760
laying this out but I'm just telling you

573
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,440
that it's it's even far worse than even

574
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:11,000
that okay so why why would it be so bad

575
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,360
first of all when the liver has its own

576
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,880
ability to produce human bile that's the

577
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:18,279
whole point it's been doing it for a

578
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:21,559
long time not in your lifetime hundreds

579
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:24,520
of lifetimes it's been doing that very

580
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:26,520
thing thousands of years it's human it's

581
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:29,000
the human nature it's the liver's right

582
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:31,039
to produce bile and regulated in the

583
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,559
concentrations and dosage it needs to

584
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,960
now here's the deal if your liver

585
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:37,039
sluggish and stagnant if it's sluggish

586
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,240
and stagnant and under producing its own

587
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:41,640
bile or under producing the strength of

588
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:44,679
its own bile because you have a stagnant

589
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:46,720
sluggish liver or fatty liver or

590
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:48,919
problematic liver because you've been

591
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,840
eating diets way too high in fat you've

592
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:53,360
been hurting your liver eating diets way

593
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:54,960
too high in fat in the then the trend is

594
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,440
high protein high fat right now how do

595
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,760
you like that which is high protein is

596
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:00,919
high fat that's the trend so we're here

597
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:03,320
diminishing the trends or diminishing

598
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:04,880
people's livers your liver will get

599
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,679
diminished because of that get weakened

600
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,120
get lose its strength and everything

601
00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:11,600
okay so that's what it does but if it's

602
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:14,480
under producing its own bile out of

603
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:17,640
being weak and sluggish do you think

604
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,679
having Ox bile driven up the hepatic

605
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,679
portal vein through the intestinal tract

606
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,279
and up the hepatic portal vein into the

607
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:26,559
liver would is going to then all of a

608
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:30,480
sudden somehow prompt the liver to

609
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:33,760
produce more human bile more human bile

610
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:36,360
it's not possible it's not humanly

611
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:39,480
possible it's not scientifically

612
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:42,799
possible it's not anything possible all

613
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:44,919
it is is just foreign garbage going up

614
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:48,240
into the liver to the liver it's foreign

615
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:51,679
garbage at concentration dosages and

616
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:55,159
chemicals in it meaning chemicals

617
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:58,320
undiscovered chemicals in there that the

618
00:23:55,159 --> 00:24:01,559
ox liver possesses that no human liver

619
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:04,440
does is inside of this with information

620
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:06,400
of an ox liver's information basically

621
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:09,320
what it is it's a whole thing about the

622
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:12,320
ox liver for generations and centuries

623
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:14,520
of oxes and that's inside there so think

624
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,120
about that so your liver is running on

625
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:20,200
information that's thousands of years

626
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:22,640
old for humans and human liver um um you

627
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,400
know the human liver body communication

628
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,880
and everything about it to sustain life

629
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,360
to sustain you and it's sitting there

630
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:30,600
running on that and it's designed in a

631
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:32,120
way to take care of you in that way and

632
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,720
everything else and designed in a way to

633
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:35,440
produce its own bio in the way it needs

634
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:38,679
to and everything else and you got this

635
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:41,240
foreign bile driving up into the liver

636
00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:43,840
that's got its own information about an

637
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:45,840
ox's life for generations and

638
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:48,200
generations and thousands of years

639
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:50,039
concentrations completely different

640
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,799
chemical compounds in it completely

641
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:53,480
undiscovered completely different the

642
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:56,240
liver doesn't work like that it doesn't

643
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:59,640
like to be pushed the liver doesn't like

644
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:02,480
to be pushed into anything it not one of

645
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:05,520
those organs that can handle being

646
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:08,039
pushed that's how the liver works very

647
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:10,600
important to understand and it doesn't

648
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:12,960
like to be poisoned so it actually has

649
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:15,840
to take that Ox bile and it actually has

650
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,880
to store it away is poison it actually

651
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:21,960
has to it has to put it into its poison

652
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:24,360
Banks into its garbage Banks that's what

653
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:27,360
happens it slows down the liver more

654
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:30,200
weakens the liver more because bile is

655
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:33,320
not supposed to do that where you're

656
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:35,559
supposed to take this bile that was was

657
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:38,200
was eliminated out of another animal's

658
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:41,120
liver and then have it go backwards up

659
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:45,320
into your own liver you can't do that

660
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:49,880
the liver creates its own bile it

661
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:53,360
creates it you see there isn't a bile

662
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:58,520
duct coming from your intestinal tract

663
00:25:53,360 --> 00:26:00,960
to carry and deliver B up into the liver

664
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:04,919
you know as if that's the way it works

665
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:08,159
or something it doesn't work like that

666
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:10,799
it just doesn't so there's no kind of

667
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,640
boport in your in your gut that's

668
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:15,679
sitting there connected to your liver to

669
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:18,240
your ass okay and you're and you're and

670
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:20,520
you're eating you're eating bile that

671
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,360
comes from another animal's liver what

672
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:26,080
in hopes that it goes up some magic kind

673
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:28,320
of like bile duct Port right up into the

674
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,760
liver it doesn't work like that

675
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:34,120
the liver is drawing blood and nutrients

676
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:36,840
yes up into the liver but it's not

677
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:39,880
supposed to be drawing another foreign

678
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:43,840
species another animal creatures bile up

679
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:47,240
into the liver to to enhance or or

680
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:50,279
create or you know or help the liver

681
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:52,760
itself actually you know develop bile it

682
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:55,200
doesn't work like that celery juice does

683
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:57,360
though when celery juice actually shakes

684
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,960
up the liver and helps it detox and

685
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:02,720
cleans and rejuvenates the cells that

686
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:04,720
produced bi that produced bile the

687
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:08,080
chemical functions that that actually

688
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:10,799
develop inside the liver to produce bile

689
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:13,440
that's that's where it's done that is

690
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:16,520
where it's done it's really important to

691
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:19,039
know that's how it's done not throwing

692
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:21,720
something in there and it all falls into

693
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:23,919
that whole thing of thousands of years

694
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:26,600
not even thousands of years ago you know

695
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:27,919
even recent when you eat something like

696
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,640
to F you think you're going to eat

697
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:31,559
something to fix something that that

698
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:33,039
whole stupid thing I'm going to eat I'm

699
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:34,240
going to eat kidneys to get my kidney

700
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,919
better I'm going to make sure I eat

701
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,320
kidneys it's good for my kidney I'm

702
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,399
going to eat liver to make my liver

703
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:40,960
better I'm going to I'm going to eat Ox

704
00:27:39,399 --> 00:27:42,480
bile to make you know to make my liver

705
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,399
better to actually get Ox I'm going to

706
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,320
get I'm going to eat Ox bile to make my

707
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:50,080
bile better if that's not the the

708
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:51,640
silliest thing ever it was a theory

709
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,240
hundreds of years ago in medieval

710
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:55,600
medicine medieval medicine okay and in

711
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,519
chronic illness we're still slightly

712
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,799
medieval by the way in chronic illness

713
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:01,320
not in other parts of medicine other

714
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:04,000
parts of medicine we doing amazing but

715
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:06,120
in in the medieval days okay centuries

716
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,919
ago I'm telling you right now it was a

717
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:12,519
big practice you eat a part of a body of

718
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:15,399
an animal body to fix your part that's

719
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:17,760
wrong that was the the consensus because

720
00:28:15,399 --> 00:28:19,840
it was an amazing Theory think about it

721
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,799
if you got an eye trouble eye problem

722
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,880
you eat eyeballs you eat eye that's what

723
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:28,080
they did but it still carries on today

724
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,519
it still carries on today that's why all

725
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,080
these supplements still have like

726
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:33,600
desiccated brain oh if you need if you

727
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,880
got brain problems you should be eating

728
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:38,760
brain if that's not the stupidest thing

729
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:41,960
I've ever heard if that if that makes

730
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:43,960
sense to someone they have to learn and

731
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:45,279
get educated on how the Body Works to

732
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:47,840
the best they could build it because if

733
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:49,679
that makes sense it's unbelievable

734
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,000
because and you know what you know what

735
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,480
I'm you know what I'm completely wrong

736
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,480
about something because it seems like it

737
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,000
could make sense sure if I got a brain

738
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,519
problem I should just eat brain that

739
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,840
could fix it and you know what that kind

740
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:01,679
of does make sense it kind of does so

741
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:05,000
I'm sorry I even said that it kind of

742
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:08,519
makes sense but it but but but it's that

743
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,919
bad it's that bad if I have you know and

744
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:12,399
that's the whole thing that's why it's

745
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:14,399
like desiccated spleen desiccated liver

746
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:16,120
any supplements desicated brain

747
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:18,159
desiccated kidney whatever and it's in

748
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:20,600
there oh desicated adrenal desicated

749
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:23,159
whatever oh my God it doesn't work like

750
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:24,720
this it just doesn't and the thing is if

751
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:26,679
you're confused about thyroids and how

752
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,320
thyroids work you should read thyroid

753
00:29:26,679 --> 00:29:30,080
healing my book thyroid healing the

754
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,200
medical medium thyroid healing and I

755
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:34,559
explained why thyroid medicine was the

756
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,640
only thing out of all the ages that ever

757
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:38,480
did anything the reason mean thyroid

758
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:41,640
medicine meanwhile desiccated thyroid

759
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:43,600
the only reason why is because it's it's

760
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:45,399
a steroid that's why it's an actual

761
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,919
steroid there's steroid compounds in

762
00:29:45,399 --> 00:29:49,840
there so that's one of the reasons it

763
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:51,399
has a steroid effect and but but but

764
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,320
eating liver and eating brain has no

765
00:29:51,399 --> 00:29:55,360
steroid effect nothing else it was only

766
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:57,720
the thyroid that some people would

767
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:00,159
subside some some some symptoms because

768
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:01,880
it's steroidal that's the whole reason

769
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:04,399
why medicine gives steroids out for

770
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:06,919
every single thing that goes wrong any

771
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:08,399
kind of inflammation so when you have

772
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:10,240
when you have hashimotos

773
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:12,880
thyroiditis it's

774
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,320
inflamed and and steroids is what they

775
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,960
use they use both different kinds of

776
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,679
steroids and then they'll use desiccated

777
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:20,640
thyroid which is a steroid I I've talked

778
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:22,880
to tons and tons and tons of doctors

779
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,320
over this a doctor friends talk to all

780
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,200
different kinds of people that are in

781
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,519
the best field of medicine in this and

782
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,200
they'll say this they'll say you're

783
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:31,519
right no it's a steroid it's steroid

784
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,360
compound that's what it is and when you

785
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:35,399
use steroids for anything you can

786
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,080
actually get some relief because it CS

787
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:38,799
down inflammation that's what it does

788
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:41,000
that's what steroids do but that's the

789
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:44,080
only exception to the rule that's ever

790
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,200
happened ever happened over the years

791
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:48,200
was the only exception to the rule was

792
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:50,200
the steroid compound there other than

793
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:52,519
that for every other exception it

794
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,919
doesn't exist it just doesn't you eat

795
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:58,080
you eat another animal a part to it I

796
00:30:54,919 --> 00:31:01,600
mean it doesn't fix your aing part heart

797
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:04,799
it just can't that's how it works and

798
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:07,240
and with Ox bile it's it's not it's it

799
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:09,600
sure if you were to eat some brain maybe

800
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:11,519
it wouldn't be bad maybe it wouldn't be

801
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,000
bad if you ate some brain unless there

802
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:13,880
was you know mad cow's disease or

803
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,480
something you don't want to eat the

804
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:19,760
brain of a Mad Cow the point is the the

805
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:21,799
whole point though it's if it if it's

806
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:24,320
actually you know wasn't in that kind of

807
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:27,039
disease State then yeah I mean would it

808
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:28,480
be that bad probably not same thing is

809
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:30,799
if if you're eating it would kidney be

810
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,519
that bad probably not liver is actually

811
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:35,480
bad cuz it's the most toxic organ in the

812
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:38,159
body so that's actually bad but the

813
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:41,080
bottom line with Ox B though it's really

814
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:44,039
bad because it's like Alchemy you

815
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:46,960
shouldn't play with that's what it is

816
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:49,240
because an ox and an ox liver is so

817
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:53,039
different and everything about it it's

818
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:56,919
got chemical functions that even surpass

819
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:59,639
the human liver in a sense too many that

820
00:31:56,919 --> 00:32:00,960
live liver could not even figure out

821
00:31:59,639 --> 00:32:04,799
what to do with that

822
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:07,639
information if anything it can confuse

823
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:09,799
completely harm the liver I'm just being

824
00:32:07,639 --> 00:32:13,399
straight up and how it works so we got

825
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:17,200
to be careful and the fats that humans

826
00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:19,200
eat are not what oxes eat whole whole

827
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:22,399
another thing too so it's a whole

828
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:24,799
another thing too so Ox bile is geared

829
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:26,559
for something else and that's that you

830
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:29,519
can go on and on and on I mean honestly

831
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:33,559
I can and I can spend forever with the

832
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:34,919
ox bile because it's it's that you want

833
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:36,480
to get your liver better you know when

834
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:37,880
you're bile is having trouble producing

835
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,159
its own bile what it really needs

836
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:41,919
instead of ox bile is a glass of celery

837
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:44,440
juice is what it really needs to help

838
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:47,480
heal and restore itself and that's

839
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:50,600
that's a big deal that seriously you

840
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:52,320
know um the bottom line is it's when you

841
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:54,519
take it one day at a time with your

842
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,399
health and you really get the right

843
00:32:54,519 --> 00:32:57,799
information and the right direction you

844
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:59,760
could do something about things you

845
00:32:57,799 --> 00:33:02,720
could get your bile strength back up you

846
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:05,279
can get your body in a place where wow

847
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,360
you can get things to work again if you

848
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:10,720
get the right information and celery

849
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:13,240
juice over Ox bile trumps it kills it

850
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:15,120
it's a billion times better than it it

851
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:17,000
makes that much of a difference so the

852
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,960
last thing you want to do is push your

853
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
liver over the edge and that's what Ox

854
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,679
can do it can push the liver it's

855
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,639
already toxic already sluggish already

856
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:27,240
stagnant already problematic possibly

857
00:33:24,639 --> 00:33:28,880
already fatty and fill the toxins filled

858
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,080
with all kinds of other levels of toxins

859
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,279
and everything else and you could push

860
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:34,159
it over the edge and that's not a good

861
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:36,120
thing Ox bile contains chemical

862
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:40,200
compounds responsible for chemical

863
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:43,000
functions that do not occur in your body

864
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:45,720
in human bodies it also contains

865
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:49,000
undiscovered amino acids that have no

866
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:51,960
role at all inside the human body amino

867
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:55,760
acids that are not supposed to be in a

868
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:58,519
human body it's different than ox meat

869
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:00,399
Ox bile is is different than ox meat

870
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:02,000
it's different than red meat it's

871
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:03,960
different than an animal meat or

872
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,000
whatever that's entirely different the

873
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:08,800
the amino acids inside the bile itself

874
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,240
literally that are not monitored un that

875
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,679
are undiscovered that are not being

876
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:14,960
looked at carefully have no place in the

877
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:16,800
human body and can I tell you something

878
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,960
playing around with amino acids can be

879
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,800
actually dangerous playing around with

880
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:24,760
amino acids can be problematic and

881
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:27,560
dangerous and even even I've seen people

882
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:29,839
even do amino acid therapies and get so

883
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:32,200
sick and that's amino acids that

884
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:34,119
actually do have a role in the human

885
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:36,280
body the body is very sensitive you got

886
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:37,800
to be very careful with amino acids and

887
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,919
that's something to really think about

888
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,839
that alone when you consume the Oxo

889
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:44,000
filled with all these extras all these

890
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:46,359
extras I'm talking about just now that

891
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,359
your body can't even use amino acids and

892
00:34:46,359 --> 00:34:49,520
everything else that are completely

893
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:51,879
undiscovered chemical function compounds

894
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,960
all that the extras go down from your

895
00:34:51,879 --> 00:34:55,359
stomach they pass the dadum they absorb

896
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:57,040
right into the intestinal tract head

897
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:59,079
directly like I said before into to the

898
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:01,280
bloodstream the highway up to the liver

899
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:03,960
meaning that your liver must process

900
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:07,880
this Blood filled with foreign

901
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:11,839
oxb so that's why it's not good all on

902
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:14,560
its own and all for a theory and all for

903
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:16,000
a theory so look I can go on and on and

904
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:19,560
on with that one but I want to talk

905
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,839
about even a more fun one which is liver

906
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:23,680
Stones because I think that would be

907
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:26,839
actually that would actually be a good

908
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:28,040
one we'll do uh we'll do liver Stones I

909
00:35:26,839 --> 00:35:30,040
I think that's a great one so let's go

910
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:32,520
right into that so have you heard about

911
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:34,280
liver stones have you heard about that

912
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,599
you got these great Brainiac guys out

913
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:37,760
there now that are that are out there

914
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:39,440
selling uh selling you know all kinds of

915
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,920
cleanses and everything else and it's

916
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,359
almost like you you get involved and you

917
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,720
know what I mean and you you have to buy

918
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:46,680
all these supplements and all these

919
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,960
herbs and all this stuff and you know

920
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:51,119
you have to rack up the money and just

921
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,839
you know and just do your detox do your

922
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,319
detox and what you're doing is you're

923
00:35:52,839 --> 00:35:55,760
you're trying to flush the liver and

924
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:56,800
you're trying to get liver stones out

925
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,200
and all that I don't know if you guys

926
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,240
has experienced that yet you got to be

927
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,640
careful with that stuff because that's

928
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,000
not how you heal the liver that's not

929
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:04,440
how you do anything for the liver and

930
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,079
that's not how you get better it's

931
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:08,079
important to know that there's so

932
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:10,160
there's so many things you can do that

933
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:12,119
are so much better and in Liver Rescue I

934
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,000
actually lay it out I lay it out in

935
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:16,000
there all the things you can do to

936
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
protect yourself and do things that

937
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,200
actually do work and heal and so forth

938
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,319
when it comes down to liver and

939
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:24,599
everything else let's talk about liver

940
00:36:21,319 --> 00:36:26,319
Stones okay so flushing liver stones and

941
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:28,079
seeing all these liver stones in the

942
00:36:26,319 --> 00:36:29,400
toilet and everything else I'm not

943
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:31,359
talking about gall stones and I'm going

944
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:33,280
to talk about that too in a little bit

945
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:35,680
but but we're talking liver Stones first

946
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,880
of all if you got somebody that's saying

947
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:40,359
there's liver

948
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:43,400
Stones then then you you you need to run

949
00:36:40,359 --> 00:36:46,760
you need to run because there are no

950
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:50,480
liver Stones the liver doesn't produce a

951
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:52,760
stone it doesn't that's not how it works

952
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,880
so the liver isn't there isn't a bunch

953
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:57,119
of stone sitting inside in this in in

954
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,319
the middle of your liver so the if

955
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,680
because that's what happens people

956
00:36:58,319 --> 00:37:01,760
imagine this all the time and they get

957
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:04,079
totally confused this is one of those

958
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:06,160
myths and theories that are just beyond

959
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:09,119
me really I honestly when I talk about

960
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:11,720
this one the ox bile one isn't so bad

961
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:14,880
this the the the Ridiculousness of the

962
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:16,680
the ox bile one it's almost like not

963
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,839
that bad even though it's terrible it's

964
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:21,720
it's just it's it's still that's how bad

965
00:37:18,839 --> 00:37:23,520
this one is so how does it work with

966
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:25,720
liver stones in the whole bit well

967
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,680
practitioners and and and healers or

968
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:29,640
whatever and gurus out there with

969
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:32,240
cleanses and everything else and not

970
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:34,280
everybody but they they all they think

971
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,480
that the liver produces a

972
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:38,760
stone and so you need the flesh that

973
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:41,400
liver flesh the stones out it's not

974
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:44,160
possible liver doesn't produce a stone

975
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:47,359
it doesn't work like that the liver

976
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:51,200
can't produce a stone it can't the

977
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:52,839
liver's too hot to produce a stone one

978
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,520
of the most advanced pieces of

979
00:37:52,839 --> 00:37:56,920
information you'll ever probably read

980
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:58,240
well maybe not ever in liver rescue

981
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,920
there's so many Advanced pieces of

982
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:03,240
information but one that's actually is

983
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:06,119
up there is up there with with with so

984
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:09,119
many that are in Liver Rescue and which

985
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:11,560
is incredible is that the heat of the

986
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:13,520
liver actually can't create the stone

987
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:16,359
anyway there's no Stones anyway inside

988
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:17,680
the liver I mean I've talked to surgeons

989
00:38:16,359 --> 00:38:20,240
I've talked to surgeons there's no

990
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:22,079
Stones inside the liver I've talked to

991
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,960
surgeons there's stones in the

992
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:25,920
gallbladder yeah there's stones in the

993
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:28,680
gallbladder without a doubt you know

994
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:32,119
made out of strong Billy Ruben there

995
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:34,560
is but that's not they don't get into

996
00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:37,079
the gallbladder because they went up a

997
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:38,920
duct from the liver so they don't go

998
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:40,280
into the gallbladder because they went

999
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:42,920
up the duct from the liver into the

1000
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:46,720
gallbladder that's not how it works if

1001
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:50,359
that's the case there would be thousands

1002
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:53,319
upon thousands and even more so than

1003
00:38:50,359 --> 00:38:55,359
gallbladder surgeries there'd be

1004
00:38:53,319 --> 00:38:58,160
emergency liver

1005
00:38:55,359 --> 00:39:00,200
surgeries um there would be thousands I

1006
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:02,319
talked to a surgeon that told me there

1007
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:05,079
would be so many would be ridiculous it

1008
00:39:02,319 --> 00:39:07,240
would be like it would be like aidomes

1009
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:08,960
it would be like that t

1010
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:11,400
tonsillectomies it would be like it

1011
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:14,000
would it would it would rise above

1012
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:16,119
override tonsillectomies ectomies and

1013
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,520
and and other things like that it would

1014
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:22,000
override it would it' be in a class all

1015
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:23,960
on its own the reason why cuz everybody

1016
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,640
has stones in the gallbladder because of

1017
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:27,760
their dirty livers and and and what

1018
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:29,280
they're eating and their high fat diets

1019
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:31,200
and they high protein high fat diets

1020
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,800
they all have they all have Stones even

1021
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,920
if they're small even if they're Sandy

1022
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:37,400
even if they're large they all have

1023
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:39,520
stones in there and what happens is the

1024
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:41,599
stones develop in the gallbladder

1025
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,880
there's no such thing as a liver Stone

1026
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:44,960
in the liver and this isn't because I

1027
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:47,520
talked to

1028
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,040
surgeons I already know this information

1029
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:51,400
and think I wrote that's why I wrote a

1030
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,960
whole thing on it it's not the the whole

1031
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:55,880
thing in here and live a

1032
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:59,119
rescue you can't have a stone go up the

1033
00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:01,079
duck to the gallbladder man I know that

1034
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,400
because what happens is it'll get

1035
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:04,400
clogged right down at the base of the

1036
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:07,880
duck down there I mean people would be

1037
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:09,720
opened up every day because it because

1038
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:12,440
unlike the gallbladder which the stones

1039
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:14,760
sitting there forever they only they

1040
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:16,839
only get jammed up and the duct leaving

1041
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:18,160
the gallbladder once in a while I mean

1042
00:40:16,839 --> 00:40:20,520
there's people out there dealing with it

1043
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:22,839
a lot but it's nothing because they

1044
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:25,240
usually just sit inside people's Gall

1045
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:27,839
the gall sack just sitting in there you

1046
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:30,040
know you know growing over time but a

1047
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:32,599
stone can't sit in the liver over time

1048
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:34,280
and pop up to that duct as if it's

1049
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:37,040
sending up going up the bile duct into

1050
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:39,400
the gallbladder I mean like I and like I

1051
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:41,280
said there would be so many surgeries it

1052
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:43,440
would be such one of the most first of

1053
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:46,280
all it' be a really hard

1054
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:49,520
surgery really really hard one really

1055
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:51,200
awful really awful I mean you have to go

1056
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:53,160
deep in there that would be a terrible

1057
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:56,079
surgery if that was happening all the

1058
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:58,480
time that would be an awful one so what

1059
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:59,839
happen happens is the liver's too hot

1060
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,319
and research and science doesn't know

1061
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:03,880
this part they don't know they don't

1062
00:41:01,319 --> 00:41:04,560
know this the liver is too hot to forge

1063
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:09,720
a

1064
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:13,000
stone it's too hot it basically keeps it

1065
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:15,560
keeps the substances that form stones in

1066
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:18,319
a liquefied state due to the heat of the

1067
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:21,119
liver that's how it works but the

1068
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:24,800
gallbladder is cooler it's cooler than

1069
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:27,680
the liver is what it is it sits and

1070
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:29,160
perched in a spot on top of that that's

1071
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:32,560
cooler than the

1072
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:36,560
liver that that degree of

1073
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:38,280
coolness that the gallbladder has and

1074
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:41,160
versus the Heat of the

1075
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:44,359
liver okay makes a difference to a

1076
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:47,359
forged Stone to forging a stone when the

1077
00:41:44,359 --> 00:41:49,079
liquid Gunk comes out of the liver from

1078
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:50,280
toxic livers from overburdened livers

1079
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:52,440
from livers filled with all kinds of

1080
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:54,480
poisons and toxins Pharmaceuticals

1081
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:56,400
petrochemicals heavy metals everything

1082
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,760
else Under the Sun and and then sitting

1083
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,240
there eating the high fat diets whether

1084
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,359
you're animal protein high fat or your

1085
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:03,359
vegan high fat that's there's there's no

1086
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:05,520
difference in there there's not really a

1087
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:07,079
difference in there like plant-based

1088
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:09,960
people I've seen them like just chug the

1089
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:12,440
nut Butters and cashew Butters and my

1090
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:14,359
God tahen and everything and lots and

1091
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:15,440
lots of lots and lots of avocado and

1092
00:42:14,359 --> 00:42:16,839
then they're told that this is the way

1093
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,240
to go and then they get themselves sick

1094
00:42:16,839 --> 00:42:20,839
and think they need to go back to animal

1095
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:23,000
protein diet then they go back to animal

1096
00:42:20,839 --> 00:42:25,800
protein where they got sick to begin

1097
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,720
with because nobody starts out vegan

1098
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:29,359
like you know what I mean so they they

1099
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:30,800
go to vegan they're like who my God and

1100
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:33,359
they're but they're eating all the high

1101
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,480
fat that way too and they they then they

1102
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:37,119
get themselves sick and then they're

1103
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,640
running back to animal protein and the

1104
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:40,119
animal protein people they're eating all

1105
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,520
the high fat diet now plus they're

1106
00:42:40,119 --> 00:42:42,960
Switching gears they're eating less

1107
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,680
animal protein now I don't know if you

1108
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,760
know this but if you're animal protein

1109
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:48,200
person you have you seen that yet animal

1110
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:50,880
protein people are eating less animal

1111
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:52,359
protein why is that I wonder why that's

1112
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,839
happening isn't that funny because

1113
00:42:52,359 --> 00:42:56,480
eating too much animal protein is bad it

1114
00:42:54,839 --> 00:42:58,200
is too much is bad I'm just just saying

1115
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,800
I'm not against animal protein it's too

1116
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:03,040
bad it's bad eating too many nuts seeds

1117
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:05,640
avocados is bad too for the plant-based

1118
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:07,240
people it's bad I'm sorry but it is I

1119
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:09,599
know I get the I know I get the vegans

1120
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:12,119
upset I know that I know I get the Paleo

1121
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:14,119
people upset but I don't care because

1122
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:16,440
it's about you it's about you having an

1123
00:43:14,119 --> 00:43:18,000
answer so you can protect yourself and I

1124
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:19,280
always say you're worth that you're

1125
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,920
worth getting the right answers to

1126
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:23,599
protect yourself it's worth protecting

1127
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:25,359
you I mean that's what I'm doing on here

1128
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:27,160
I think it's worth it it's why I'm here

1129
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:30,119
I'm here yelling talking about this all

1130
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:32,000
the time so the deal is when the liver's

1131
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:34,599
burdened with all that high fat going up

1132
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,599
the hepatic portal vein and all the bile

1133
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:38,240
that needs to disperse the fat and wears

1134
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:41,720
its bile Reserve out of the liver and

1135
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:43,480
everything else it overheats and all

1136
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:46,240
that junk and all that poison and old

1137
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:47,800
Pharmaceuticals from 1989 or whatever is

1138
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:51,800
in your system and everything else going

1139
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:54,480
on is all in there that Gunk it stays

1140
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:57,599
liquefied but mcky and gunky and the

1141
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:59,160
liver has to send it up the bile duct

1142
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:00,960
sends it up the bile duct into the

1143
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:04,400
gallbladder where it's colder and then

1144
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:07,599
the stones form they coal kind of like

1145
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:10,960
liquid gold cools liquid metal

1146
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:13,200
cools and in that Gunk are heavy metals

1147
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,319
sure science and research they hav even

1148
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,280
looked at those stones good enough you

1149
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:18,160
think they're going to put that much

1150
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:20,839
money into it you know what's in those

1151
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:22,400
stones isn't just old old red blood dead

1152
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:23,440
red blood cells and Billy ruin or

1153
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,160
whatever it else that's in there and

1154
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:28,040
everything it's not just all that stuff

1155
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:31,599
and cholesterol those stones are filled

1156
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:33,480
with Metals junk garbage I mean you

1157
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:35,280
wouldn't believe Industrial Age stuff

1158
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:37,000
going back before your time for your

1159
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,720
forefather's time and passed on to you

1160
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,640
and passed on to you're can pass on to

1161
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:43,839
your children all that Gunk that's how

1162
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:45,599
it works and it cools down and the stone

1163
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:47,960
is formed stones are formed in the

1164
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:51,440
gallbladder so when you got it's

1165
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:53,240
unbelievable that I see out there these

1166
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:56,040
you know these natural doctors or

1167
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:57,680
whoever doctor or whatever whatever and

1168
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:59,960
is you know promoting these cleanses you

1169
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:03,920
got to buy for liver

1170
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:05,880
Stones I mean I I can't even but this is

1171
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:08,040
a prime example of how the

1172
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:09,520
misinformation is so thick out there

1173
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:13,000
it's like literally it's not just the

1174
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:15,520
Wild West it's like something far worse

1175
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,599
it's far worse out there it's like

1176
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:19,760
literally like anything goes and

1177
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:21,720
anything stupid goes that's how

1178
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:24,960
incredible it is out

1179
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:26,680
there that's unbelievable so and this is

1180
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,480
a part of it I'm being sarcastic because

1181
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:31,359
I've seen people hurt by this stuff and

1182
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:33,640
wasting time and tons of money tons of

1183
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:36,280
money time and energy and I've seen

1184
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:38,720
people hurt by it and it's depressing

1185
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:41,520
it's depressing you know someone asked

1186
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:42,720
me if I ever had depression before they

1187
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,079
you know they said have you ever had

1188
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,760
depression before because I know that

1189
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:47,480
people suffer from depression and I know

1190
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:49,200
why they suffer from depression because

1191
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:51,559
they got the Epstein bars dropping in

1192
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:53,400
all this all this neurotoxin feeding off

1193
00:45:51,559 --> 00:45:55,520
the toxic heavy metals and heavy metals

1194
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:57,640
in the brain and neurotransmitters go

1195
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:00,160
they they dampen and let your lights

1196
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:01,760
drop and depression hits and people go

1197
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,480
get depressed they get they fall into

1198
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:05,200
this depression and then they go they

1199
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:06,800
try to take brain altering medication

1200
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,200
like the anxiety stuff and all the

1201
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,640
different anti-depressants and

1202
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:12,079
everything else and I get it I know why

1203
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:15,079
I've never had

1204
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:17,559
depression until I I see what's out

1205
00:46:15,079 --> 00:46:20,160
there over the years till I see what's

1206
00:46:17,559 --> 00:46:21,680
out there you know my depression hits I

1207
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:23,079
said you know I never had depression I

1208
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:25,040
said you know what I I got something

1209
00:46:23,079 --> 00:46:26,520
that's it won't it it's not even like

1210
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:30,599
depression I guess

1211
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:32,480
but I got sadness sadness I got sadness

1212
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:33,680
on the misinformation and anything goes

1213
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,119
out there and what people get pushed

1214
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,800
into and what they have to spend money

1215
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:38,880
on and everything else they have to do

1216
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:40,720
unbelievable like with Liver Rescue I

1217
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:42,480
put a whole recipe book in Liver Rescue

1218
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:44,400
so there's two books in there because I

1219
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:46,680
don't want you even spending $1 more dos

1220
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,800
for another book to play that game I see

1221
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:50,240
what authors do they got there they put

1222
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,800
out their book and then they try to put

1223
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:53,680
out another book side of it which just

1224
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:55,000
here's the recipe book for that now why

1225
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:58,160
couldn't you put in the same book and

1226
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:02,160
save the person $15 you I've seen it all

1227
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:05,200
out there and the whole point is is this

1228
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:07,800
okay is this it's about you and that's

1229
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:09,280
what matters it's about you that's

1230
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:11,359
that's the point that should be taken no

1231
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:14,640
matter what it's about you and what we

1232
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:16,280
what can we do for you what can that's

1233
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:18,359
what people need to see that are selling

1234
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:20,200
all those those expensive supplements

1235
00:47:18,359 --> 00:47:23,040
that are selling all what can we really

1236
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:24,839
do for you how do we protect you and do

1237
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,880
it in a sensible Manner and give you the

1238
00:47:24,839 --> 00:47:28,400
right information so not out there just

1239
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:31,119
guessing games of theories and

1240
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:33,880
misinformation due to you know people's

1241
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:35,359
pockets and so liver Stones is a big one

1242
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:36,960
that's why I'm on this rant right now

1243
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:38,720

1244
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,200
one the whole liver Stone thing I got

1245
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:42,359
people say oh they flushed all these

1246
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:43,720
stones in the toilet these liver stones

1247
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:45,599
in the toilet it was all the herbal

1248
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:48,319
concoctions they were sold all these

1249
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:49,760
alcohol concoctions alcohol in the herbs

1250
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:51,960
all these liquid herbs and all these

1251
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:53,280
dried powdered herbs and all this stuff

1252
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:55,400
and they're taking all these herbs and

1253
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:57,880
mucus gets collected in the intestinal

1254
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:59,240
tract because it's reacting to all these

1255
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,960
herbs being thrown in there and the

1256
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:02,319
tannins and the herbs and herbs that

1257
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:04,839
shouldn't even be in people some of

1258

cockman idea and they throw all these

1261
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:11,079
herb powders in you and all this other

1262
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,760
stuff and then you're sitting there

1263
00:48:11,079 --> 00:48:14,520
pooping your brains out and you're

1264
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:16,680
looking for Stones when it's really

1265
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:18,000
mucus and old debris that could just be

1266
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:20,119
in the testal tract for your food or

1267
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,599
food attached to mucus and you think you

1268
00:48:20,119 --> 00:48:24,520
see stones in the toilet liver stones

1269
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:25,839
and you get delusional when easily

1270
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:27,760
delusional when you're sitting there

1271
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:30,040
spending all that money taking all the

1272
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:31,680
stuff feeling like crap and doing this

1273
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:33,640
you you want to believe something's in

1274
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:35,319
that toilet I swear to God I've seen

1275
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:38,119
people go through this so many times

1276
00:48:35,319 --> 00:48:39,720
it's ridiculous and let's go push into

1277
00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:42,119
liver flushes well we have a couple more

1278
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:42,960
minutes left liver flesh is the one

1279
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:44,440
thing I'm going to tell you right now

1280
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,800
and I put in Liver Rescue so you know

1281
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:49,760
the liver does not like to be pushed it

1282
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:51,000
hates to be pushed in any way it's like

1283
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,880
you wouldn't want your son or your

1284
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,160
daughter being pushed by a drug Pusher

1285
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:55,599
that's for sure you wouldn't want your

1286
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:57,720
son and daughter being pushed by any

1287
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:59,200
anybody by a bully and pushed down in

1288
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:01,200
the playground you wouldn't want your

1289
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:03,240
son and daughter pushed by anything okay

1290
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:06,359
and that's the bottom line and your your

1291
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:08,280
liver is like basically a family member

1292
00:49:06,359 --> 00:49:10,040
it's a family member and it's watching

1293
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:11,720
you and it's got your back and

1294
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:13,599
everything else you don't want to liver

1295
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:16,319
does not like to be pushed it doesn't

1296
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:18,200
like to be pushed off the diving board

1297
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:19,960
the first time in a first time on a

1298
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:21,319
diving board like a child having its

1299
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:22,920
first time on a diving board

1300
00:49:21,319 --> 00:49:24,520
contemplating how the child is going to

1301
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:26,720
dump in he or she is going to jump in

1302
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:29,280
and dump into the water or whatever how

1303
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:30,359
you know what happens is is that when

1304
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,760
that's happening and someone comes

1305
00:49:30,359 --> 00:49:34,359
behind the child and pushes that child

1306
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:37,079
in it could be a bad memory it could be

1307
00:49:34,359 --> 00:49:39,880
a shock that child didn't deserve I've

1308
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:41,599
seen that happen too I mean it it you

1309
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:43,280

1310
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:45,760

1311
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:47,680
know pushing a sibling into the water

1312
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:50,920
it's basically what the liver does not

1313
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:52,280
like to be pushed into anything

1314
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:53,760
especially flushing and I'll tell you

1315
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:55,599
why cuz when you flush the liver the

1316
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:58,079
wrong way or you try to push the liver

1317
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:59,960
to flush it all that poison and all that

1318
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:01,760
toxin goes into the bloodstream and you

1319
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:03,599
know what the liver does it tries to get

1320
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:05,359

liver and try to flush it like like a

1324
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:12,680

00:50:33,559 --> 00:50:39,960
tell you why when the liver push too

1338
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:42,599
hard it ends up dumping all this poison

1339
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:45,559
into the system the poison hurts the

1340
00:50:42,599 --> 00:50:47,920
heart Untold damage for the future can

1341
00:50:45,559 --> 00:50:49,280
happen now you can you can you can look

1342
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:51,480
you can heal your liver and heal your

1343
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:54,599
body if you've done those things so that

1344
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:56,480
you can get get those 5 years back and

1345
00:50:54,599 --> 00:50:58,440
then 10 years back back on top of it if

1346
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,559
you're doing the right things that's

1347
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:01,640
important and you can you can do all the

1348
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:03,040
right things for your liver I put a

1349
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:05,640
liver cleanse for the liver that's

1350
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:07,559
gentle but powerful it doesn't push your

1351
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:10,079
liver I put that in Liver Rescue for a

1352
00:51:07,559 --> 00:51:12,880
reason I put that in Liver Rescue for a

1353
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:14,960
reason and what happens is when that

1354
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:17,160
liver dumps all that poison into the

1355
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,040
bloodstream it's injurious to the heart

1356
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:20,200
and

1357
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:22,000
brain it's not good for the heart and

1358
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:24,760
brain and the liver freaks out because

1359
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:27,240
it has to reabsorb that that toxin back

1360
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:29,319
in is fat fast as possible so then it

1361
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:31,359
sends out signals it sends out hormones

1362
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:33,319
to trigger off the adrenals to release

1363
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:34,960
adrenaline at a dangerous Pace even

1364
00:51:33,319 --> 00:51:37,359
though even you may not feel it but

1365
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:39,240
there's a adrenaline is re releasing out

1366
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:41,480
when you're doing those liver flushes

1367
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:43,440
because the adrenaline's there to

1368
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:45,440
protect the brain and the Heart Is as

1369
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:47,520
fast as possible the liver calls out for

1370
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:49,480
help it weakens your adrenals the

1371
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:51,920
adrenaline has to be all absorbed right

1372
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:53,119
back into the liver along with all that

1373
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,079
poison you know what the liver does

1374
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:57,799
right after that it shuts down and it

1375
00:51:55,079 --> 00:51:59,079
stop stops letting you push it so when

1376
00:51:57,799 --> 00:52:00,440
you're still doing your liver flesh

1377
00:51:59,079 --> 00:52:02,000
after that and you're still doing it

1378
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:03,880
Whatever It Is 30-day liver flesh or

1379
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,520
whatever you got going or bought into

1380
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:07,480
and you're still doing it your liver is

1381
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:10,040
now not even working because it won't

1382
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:12,280
let anything out of the gate

1383
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:15,440
anymore that's how it works because it

1384
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:16,480
let so much out of the gate so much that

1385
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:19,720
was

1386
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:21,200
detrimental and that's how it works and

1387
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:23,000
if your liver does let it out of the

1388
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:24,799
gate again because it has no choice

1389
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:27,200
because it's been pushed by some strange

1390
00:52:24,799 --> 00:52:29,920
concoction

1391
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:31,760
and that's even worse and has to do it

1392
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,640
all over again to try to protect you

1393
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:35,000
liver

1394
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:36,760
flushes that are unauthorized by the

1395
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,720
human body and the liver itself

1396
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:41,720
unauthorized by the liver itself is not

1397
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:43,799
a good thing it's not a good thing at

1398
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:45,160
all and if you're someone that's new to

1399
00:52:43,799 --> 00:52:46,520
the show and new to my information and

1400
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:48,319
you're confused and saying well I don't

1401
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:49,640
get it then what makes your information

1402
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:51,799
like any better or

1403
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:53,240
whatever it is it because of the

1404
00:52:51,799 --> 00:52:54,760
countless people I've helped recover

1405
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:56,280
over the years and the decades is it

1406
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:58,440

of that

1412
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:11,559
combined because my source is not funded
