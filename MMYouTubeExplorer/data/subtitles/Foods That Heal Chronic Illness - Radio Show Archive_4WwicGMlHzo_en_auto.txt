[16.00 - 20.68] medium hello I'm Anthony William and
[19.00 - 22.56] you're listening to the medical medium
[20.68 - 24.72] radio show where each week I talk about
[22.56 - 26.88] the most advanced healing information
[24.72 - 28.84] and secrets about health much of which
[26.88 - 30.84] is not found anywhere else and is
[28.84 - 33.84] decades ahead of what's out there now as
[30.84 - 36.40] I've always said who is 10 or 20 or 30
[33.84 - 38.96] even 30 years to wait for answers and
[36.40 - 40.88] I've seen it before and I see it now
[38.96 - 42.16] it's going on out there I talked to
[40.88 - 45.24] people and they're like you know it took
[42.16 - 47.52] 30 years to know that Epstein bar
[45.24 - 49.52] actually causes heart palpitations no
[47.52 - 52.00] one knew that it didn't exist out there
[49.52 - 54.32] the information did not exist out there
[52.00 - 57.24] and it took 30 years to figure out that
[54.32 - 59.36] epscene bar causes tingles and numbness
[57.24 - 61.52] and that didn't exist it took 30 years
[59.36 - 65.04] for this person person to find out that
[61.52 - 68.00] Epstein causes anxiety and depression
[65.04 - 72.36] chronic depression long term and brain
[68.00 - 75.12] fog nobody knew it never was anywhere
[72.36 - 77.04] else but here and that's thanks to
[75.12 - 78.52] Spirit so thank you for actually tuning
[77.04 - 79.92] in everybody because we're helping out
[78.52 - 82.72] so many people by getting the
[79.92 - 85.24] information finally out there because we
[82.72 - 87.20] don't have time to waste we don't have
[85.24 - 89.04] time to just hang out we don't have
[87.20 - 92.24] another 30 years to know that Epstein
[89.04 - 94.68] bar causes Hashimoto's thyroiditis and
[92.24 - 97.20] although this isn't an Epstein bar show
[94.68 - 99.64] today we're talking about foods that
[97.20 - 101.48] heal chronic illness and of course
[99.64 - 104.40] Epstein bar causes a lot of chronic
[101.48 - 106.84] illness so does a lot of other bugs and
[104.40 - 108.64] pathogens that we talk about like strap
[106.84 - 110.96] and everything else and you know and
[108.64 - 112.76] other types of pathogens and of course
[110.96 - 114.44] we talk about the toxic heavy metals and
[112.76 - 117.72] other things associated with chronic
[114.44 - 119.60] illness but the point is today we're
[117.72 - 121.52] talking about foods that heal chronic
[119.60 - 123.84] illness illness so we might tap into
[121.52 - 126.48] some of these other chronic illnesses
[123.84 - 128.08] and what we deal with every day so
[126.48 - 130.20] there's no time to waste no time to
[128.08 - 133.96] spare fasten the seat belts we're
[130.20 - 138.48] starting today so today's show is about
[133.96 - 139.96] the Holy four the holy four okay right I
[138.48 - 142.68] talked to you before about the
[139.96 - 144.80] unforgiving four right the unforgiving
[142.68 - 146.56] four which is the pesticides and
[144.80 - 149.88] herbicides that are in our system for
[146.56 - 153.12] years like DDT included all the way back
[149.88 - 157.84] toxic heavy metals Mercury lead arsenic
[153.12 - 160.20] you know um cadmium um nickel copper we
[157.84 - 162.52] you know we talked about that and you
[160.20 - 164.56] aluminum and then we talked about the
[162.52 - 166.36] radiation how much radiation still
[164.56 - 167.56] falling out on us how much radiation is
[166.36 - 169.64] going on there and there's nothing to
[167.56 - 171.16] worry about in the sense where hey we
[169.64 - 172.96] got all this stuff going on that's not
[171.16 - 175.56] about it it's about
[172.96 - 179.96] knowing what could be hampering your
[175.56 - 183.08] immune system and what we can do to stop
[179.96 - 186.16] it fight it clean it up get it out of
[183.08 - 190.24] your system instead of just playing the
[186.16 - 192.64] game like hey everything's fine sure 250
[190.24 - 195.12] million Americans are sick almost 300
[192.64 - 198.00] million Americans have symptoms
[195.12 - 200.36] unexplained completely mystery but let's
[198.00 - 201.72] just pretend everything's okay you know
[200.36 - 203.12] we're not going to do that all right
[201.72 - 205.52] we're not going to do that because I
[203.12 - 207.60] know if you got a symptom and you got
[205.52 - 210.52] something going on and you got a chronic
[207.60 - 212.12] illness you want answers um no one wants
[210.52 - 214.04] to be sick you know one thing I know
[212.12 - 215.88] I'll tell you guys right now and and you
[214.04 - 219.44] probably know this better than I do no
[215.88 - 222.64] one wants to be sick you know and there
[219.44 - 225.72] isn't such thing as a fear of
[222.64 - 230.00] healing but what there is is there's a
[225.72 - 232.60] fear of being sick that's for sure so we
[230.00 - 236.12] do have that out there that's rampant
[232.60 - 241.12] there is a fear of being sick so that
[236.12 - 244.36] does exist okay but nobody has a fear of
[241.12 - 246.00] healing all right so that right there is
[244.36 - 248.12] something we have to always understand
[246.00 - 250.28] you no one wants a tummy ache no one
[248.12 - 252.44] wants a tummy ache nobody wants a
[250.28 - 255.24] headache does anybody want a headache
[252.44 - 258.28] out there does anybody want a tummy ache
[255.24 - 260.60] does any I'm actually being a little
[258.28 - 263.04] extra uh annoying today is that what it
[260.60 - 266.04] is silly a little extra silly nobody
[263.04 - 268.08] wants to have an ache and pain right I
[266.04 - 270.56] mean come on and so and I'm serious
[268.08 - 273.88] about this no one wants
[270.56 - 278.24] fatigue so we can't just
[273.88 - 280.64] gloss everything over as if you know hey
[278.24 - 282.48] all right fine you know we you know here
[280.64 - 284.08] there's diets out there there's this out
[282.48 - 285.48] there and you know there's there's
[284.08 - 288.00] really nothing to be worried about a
[285.48 - 289.48] concerned um it's your fault you're sick
[288.00 - 291.36] how about that we hear that all the time
[289.48 - 294.12] out there oh it's your fault you're sick
[291.36 - 296.20] um yeah no it's not your fault that you
[294.12 - 298.32] got these symptoms and we can't gloss
[296.20 - 300.96] everything over we got to know what the
[298.32 - 302.88] unforgiving for that we just recently

[302.88 - 306.04] that is we have to know it's the toxic
[304.80 - 308.32] heavy metals we have to know it's the
[306.04 - 311.20] viral explosion it's the upstein bar the
[308.32 - 313.00] epidemic we have to know why 250 plus

[313.00 - 316.88] have symptoms of all kinds and
[314.48 - 320.00] conditions in in the us alone we have to
[316.88 - 322.24] know about the radiation and you know
[320.00 - 323.56] these things are important they really
[322.24 - 325.48] are and we have to know about the
[323.56 - 327.24] pesticides and the old DDT that's been
[325.48 - 328.76] you know in our systems all these years
[327.24 - 331.12] and the pesticides and everything else
[328.76 - 334.64] around it we got to know about this and

[386.44 - 389.96] event we're doing the light blast and
[388.32 - 392.96] that's what we're doing sending light
[389.96 - 395.40] down from heaven Spirit does this for me
[392.96 - 397.00] thank goodness since I was a child and I
[395.40 - 399.36] talk about this before you guys heard me
[397.00 - 401.80] say this before I was worried about what
[399.36 - 403.80] else can I do back when I was younger
[401.80 - 405.80] what can I do to help somebody and
[403.80 - 407.96] spirit said we're going to do the light
[405.80 - 410.08] and spirit taught me how to be involved
[407.96 - 411.96] why Spirit sends the light down on the
[410.08 - 413.88] crown of everybody's head and we do this
[411.96 - 416.00] at the event rushes through the body
[413.88 - 417.92] unblocks energy that's stored up that
[416.00 - 420.12] people have from just being sick and not
[417.92 - 422.48] feeling well and they get all stagnant
[420.12 - 423.96] and and you know and get all acidic and
[422.48 - 426.08] everybody just you because when you're
[423.96 - 428.12] sick and unwell it's really difficult we
[426.08 - 429.60] go through struggles and we don't feel
[428.12 - 431.52] good we don't feel at our best and we
[429.60 - 433.04] feel tired and everything just builds up
[431.52 - 435.68] and then we have all these kinds of
[433.04 - 437.12] struggles and emotional um struggles
[435.68 - 438.48] that we do because there's so much
[437.12 - 441.12] stress and everything else going on in
[438.48 - 443.08] the world and in our lives and it gets
[441.12 - 444.68] built up and on top of that we have our
[443.08 - 446.56] condition itself and the and the cause
[444.68 - 448.16] of the conditions themselves like for
[446.56 - 450.52] instance say Epstein bar or something
[448.16 - 451.92] else and so that light comes down hits
[450.52 - 454.72] the crown of everybody's head it runs
[451.92 - 457.72] through the body and it is a rush we do
[454.72 - 459.72] it we I I don't care what it takes
[457.72 - 463.08] spirit and I want to make sure everybody

[640.68 - 644.84] amazing you had more than one apple and
[643.24 - 647.32] this person said yeah because it was in
[644.84 - 651.76] it was an apple tart this homemade apple
[647.32 - 654.20] tart I said okay hold on hold on okay
[651.76 - 656.24] I'm back up here so wait a minute you
[654.20 - 658.40] didn't have an apple and chop it up and
[656.24 - 661.32] eat it in slices or put a little almond
[658.40 - 662.52] butter on it or put a little or put a
[661.32 - 664.48] little peanut butter on it if that's
[662.52 - 666.44] what you like or put you know whatever
[664.48 - 669.68] it is Apple goes good with avocado by
[666.44 - 673.04] the way if you put avocado on an Apple
[669.68 - 675.36] slice that tastes really good I'm just
[673.04 - 677.20] I'm just being straight um anyway so
[675.36 - 678.60] they go no it was in a tart it was in a
[677.20 - 680.60] healthy tart it was at I was at this
[678.60 - 683.36] health food store and they had these
[680.60 - 684.52] apple tarts and uh I said well what what
[683.36 - 687.24] else was in it they said well was
[684.52 - 688.80] glutenfree I said so you sure there was
[687.24 - 690.64] that much apple in there I go first of
[688.80 - 692.40] all okay your Apple was cooked which is
[690.64 - 693.80] not the endend of the world okay fine if
[692.40 - 696.80] that's what you know it's still got
[693.80 - 699.84] medicinal qualities applesauce still has
[696.80 - 702.44] Med medicinal qualities I go so it was
[699.84 - 704.76] this tart you go okay you had probably
[702.44 - 707.64] like a half an apple in that tart the
[704.76 - 710.44] rest was batter you know bread

[710.44 - 716.72] sugar probably canola oil you know
[713.92 - 719.04] because canola oil is bad and um and
[716.72 - 721.72] regular sugar like table Sugar's bad and
[719.04 - 723.60] and and so and and this person was like
[721.72 - 724.96] yeah I guess you're right I I just first

[736.12 - 741.76] liver problem and you got inflammation
[739.76 - 744.16] caused by you know pathogens and other
[741.76 - 747.36] things going on in the body you got to
[744.16 - 749.24] get two apples in a day because that's
[747.36 - 752.04] when it starts to happen that's when the
[749.24 - 754.64] magic starts to happen it's the numbers
[752.04 - 756.08] it's the numbers and that's why someone
[754.64 - 757.52] said to me another time and said well
[756.08 - 759.00] you don't like you know animal products
[757.52 - 760.88] like that's not about it it's not what
[759.00 - 762.36] it is has nothing to do with that it's
[760.88 - 763.92] about what food that's going to help the
[762.36 - 766.12] person the most for what condition they
[763.92 - 769.64] have so if that means minimizing animal
[766.12 - 771.72] products because you need room for two
[769.64 - 773.72] apples three apples a day to clean up
[771.72 - 776.72] your liver does that mean I hate
[773.72 - 779.16] something no it just means I'm telling
[776.72 - 780.88] you what you need to do because I I got
[779.16 - 783.04] your back on this and I'm telling you
[780.88 - 785.72] what you need to do and get you to where
[783.04 - 787.08] you need to be and so and they're like
[785.72 - 789.36] okay okay that makes sense I didn't
[787.08 - 790.88] think about it that way so anyway back
[789.36 - 793.12] to this other person he said look we got
[790.88 - 796.08] to do better than this apple tart I mean
[793.12 - 799.40] a jar of applesauce would be better than
[796.08 - 800.68] that apple tart so the bottom line is
[799.40 - 804.24] you know we're told to eat are fruits
[800.68 - 806.20] and vegetables but we're not really
[804.24 - 809.60] eating our fruits and vegetables and
[806.20 - 811.48] it's not our fault it's not your fault
[809.60 - 812.96] it's not my fault if I can't get enough
[811.48 - 815.00] vegetables in one day cuz I'm running
[812.96 - 817.08] around like a you know a crazy person
[815.00 - 819.28] because I got so much on my plate or I'm
[817.08 - 820.64] traveling or something and I can't get
[819.28 - 823.76] enough vegetables it's not I mean it's
[820.64 - 826.08] not our fault we do the best we can but
[823.76 - 828.84] we but but what we have to do is we just
[826.08 - 831.28] have to be more mindful about what when
[828.84 - 832.92] we're eating what we're eating and some
[831.28 - 834.24] people they just hate that and I totally
[832.92 - 836.20] get it they're just like I don't want to
[834.24 - 838.12] know what I'm eating I talk to people
[836.20 - 840.08] and some people go I don't want to know
[838.12 - 842.44] what I'm eating I don't care what I'm
[840.08 - 846.24] eating I just you know it's just I got
[842.44 - 848.12] busy life I got a busy life I just you
[846.24 - 849.64] know if I can get a good meal here and
[848.12 - 852.68] there I'll get a good meal here and
[849.64 - 856.08] there and and that's all I could tell
[852.68 - 859.16] you Anthony and that's so some people do
[856.08 - 861.48] that and I respect that I respect that
[859.16 - 863.64] because Planet stress did I say Planet
[861.48 - 866.16] stress sorry about that you guys planet
[863.64 - 869.12] Earth I do that sometimes and I and I
[866.16 - 871.16] apologize planet Earth you you know
[869.12 - 873.08] there's a lot it's a it's a challenge on
[871.16 - 875.12] here it's a challenge on this ball
[873.08 - 877.68] that's just rolling around that's
[875.12 - 879.68] spinning around and you know and I get
[877.68 - 881.52] it if you got to just grab food to food
[879.68 - 882.64] to eat and just you got you can't you
[881.52 - 884.60] you're trying to take care of your
[882.64 - 888.36] family and you're running around and you
[884.60 - 890.20] got things going on I respect that I got
[888.36 - 893.08] respect for anything you got to do in
[890.20 - 895.88] your life okay and anything you've gone
[893.08 - 898.80] through okay and that's one thing that I
[895.88 - 900.48] have and um because you have to have
[898.80 - 902.08] have that you have to have that I talk
[900.48 - 904.88] to people and they don't even they they
[902.08 - 907.56] just don't understand uh what someone
[904.88 - 908.76] else is going through and and it's sad
[907.56 - 910.00] because you know when you try to tell
[908.76 - 911.44] them you got to go look this person's
[910.00 - 912.84] going through a lot and they go well I
[911.44 - 914.36] you know what that's not my life that's
[912.84 - 917.44] their life they caused that I go no
[914.36 - 918.60] that's not true they didn't cause it and
[917.44 - 921.40] they're going through a lot and we got
[918.60 - 923.12] to respect that and it's critical to to
[921.40 - 924.64] respect that so if you can't get the
[923.12 - 926.40] fruits and vegetables in every day that
[924.64 - 929.32] you can't we take one day at a time we
[926.40 - 933.76] get what we can get in you just
[929.32 - 935.32] one or two things a day one thing a day
[933.76 - 937.64] and if you're really sick and you got
[935.32 - 940.32] and you and listen and you can apply
[937.64 - 943.64] yourself and do more and more we get you
[940.32 - 945.84] there faster we get you healing faster
[943.64 - 947.56] we get you healing your chronic illness
[945.84 - 948.52] faster because it's about chronic
[947.56 - 951.44] illness
[948.52 - 952.36] today and that's what it's about it's
[951.44 - 956.00] really
[952.36 - 957.96] important and so yeah I mean this is so
[956.00 - 959.24] critical it really is all of this
[957.96 - 961.68] information we're going to cover today
[959.24 - 963.48] so fasten the seat belts we're going to
[961.68 - 966.80] get there see one thing I got to tell
[963.48 - 969.12] you guys one thing one thing about um
[966.80 - 971.72] belief systems let's talk about belief
[969.12 - 974.20] systems a little bit it might seem kind
[971.72 - 976.04] of annoying but it's it's good to it's
[974.20 - 978.60] good to talk about that I think it's
[976.04 - 981.08] good to get get that in in there belief
[978.60 - 984.24] systems are interesting because you know
[981.08 - 986.68] we can we can get a hobby we could wake
[984.24 - 989.48] up in the morning get a hobby and I mean
[986.68 - 991.68] I got hobbies and and boom and just and
[989.48 - 993.32] all of a sudden we can be an expert at
[991.68 - 996.08] something we can be an expert at
[993.32 - 998.36] something okay and and that's totally
[996.08 - 1001.52] cool and there's nothing wrong with that
[998.36 - 1003.16] you know I mean it's it just it can
[1001.52 - 1005.04] happen we wake up in the morning we get
[1003.16 - 1007.04] a passion for something we say you know
[1005.04 - 1008.72] what this is what I want to do and we
[1007.04 - 1010.80] become that expert about and it becomes
[1008.72 - 1012.44] a hobby and then it goes from a hobby to
[1010.80 - 1013.76] you know to all of a sudden now you're
[1012.44 - 1017.44] now we're an expert we're at this
[1013.76 - 1019.60] expertise level and it's amazing and and
[1017.44 - 1021.40] I see that all kind kind of things in
[1019.60 - 1023.36] life of all the things we do creative
[1021.40 - 1025.16] things and I love it all it's incredible
[1023.36 - 1026.92] and I try to do that too I try to you
[1025.16 - 1030.24] know have passion for something and I
[1026.92 - 1031.76] get interested in something and and you
[1030.24 - 1033.60] know next thing you know it I'm like
[1031.76 - 1035.44] researching something meaning like you
[1033.60 - 1037.28] know what whatever it could be you know
[1035.44 - 1039.32] when I was young it would be like model
[1037.28 - 1040.96] planes model airplanes and I would know
[1039.32 - 1043.04] all the different kinds of airplanes and
[1040.96 - 1045.16] stuff and it it would be like you know
[1043.04 - 1049.08] it's that kind of thing A friend of mine
[1045.16 - 1052.00] is um a sports expert and he's just like
[1049.08 - 1053.92] Rambles off and rattles off uh batting
[1052.00 - 1055.44] averages and everything else and he said
[1053.92 - 1057.00] you he said at first you know he just
[1055.44 - 1058.56] got into it it was just kind of a hobby
[1057.00 - 1060.04] he caught a couple of games couple of
[1058.56 - 1062.48] football games couple of baseball games
[1060.04 - 1064.04] couple of soccer games and and then he
[1062.48 - 1065.60] says you know it was just like a Pastime
[1064.04 - 1067.04] little hobby a past time was a little
[1065.60 - 1068.64] bit of a passion and he said he got
[1067.04 - 1071.36] really into it and now he's like an
[1068.64 - 1074.04] expert he he went from one point of it
[1071.36 - 1076.52] to hey you know he can ramble off
[1074.04 - 1078.56] everything strategies that you know uh
[1076.52 - 1080.72] sports teams use you name it in this
[1078.56 - 1083.40] stuff just spins my head cuz I I don't
[1080.72 - 1085.40] know anything about that so so you know
[1083.40 - 1087.52] but but he be he you know became this
[1085.40 - 1089.88] expert at it and then then a belief
[1087.52 - 1092.28] system gets built up within it so a
[1089.88 - 1094.64] belief system gets built up within it
[1092.28 - 1097.20] and it's like it's there you know it
[1094.64 - 1100.76] it's just they can't penetrate that
[1097.20 - 1102.68] belief system so when I say to them now
[1100.76 - 1104.36] you know I'll say look is is is this
[1102.68 - 1106.20] team better than this team because they
[1104.36 - 1108.56] got this going on and go like no no no
[1106.20 - 1110.72] that's not possible I'll be like why
[1108.56 - 1112.24] like no no it's not possible because of
[1110.72 - 1114.44] this this this and this I said well okay
[1112.24 - 1115.88] you got a strong belief system on that
[1114.44 - 1117.08] he says well maybe I do maybe you're
[1115.88 - 1118.48] right maybe I got to look at the other
[1117.08 - 1121.44] team and see what they got going on
[1118.48 - 1123.36] better and so what happens is we fall
[1121.44 - 1126.04] into these belief systems we come we
[1123.36 - 1128.96] become experts we get a passion to start
[1126.04 - 1131.28] with and then bam we got a powerful
[1128.96 - 1135.36] belief system Spirit told me when I was
[1131.28 - 1138.52] young to not hold the belief system when
[1135.36 - 1141.88] it comes to one thing okay when when it
[1138.52 - 1143.60] comes to one thing okay because I had a
[1141.88 - 1146.36] belief system when I was 11 years old I
[1143.60 - 1149.36] like these model airplanes and you know
[1146.36 - 1152.20] and I I got interested because of a
[1149.36 - 1153.76] friend and you know and the friend had
[1152.20 - 1155.32] him and I was like whoa this is really
[1153.76 - 1157.88] cool you got all these different planes
[1155.32 - 1159.68] this is really cool I get it and so it
[1157.88 - 1162.80] was getting interested in it and it was
[1159.68 - 1164.48] building a belief system to all about it
[1162.80 - 1167.24] and spirit said that's fine you can have
[1164.48 - 1169.00] a belief system about certain things but
[1167.24 - 1170.64] one thing you can't have have one in I
[1169.00 - 1173.24] said what is it and spirit said you
[1170.64 - 1176.32] can't have a belief system in health you
[1173.24 - 1179.08] can't have a belief system in health in
[1176.32 - 1181.48] health I said really what does that mean
[1179.08 - 1183.40] I was in shock when I was young and
[1181.48 - 1185.00] spirit was telling me this and I was
[1183.40 - 1187.00] like okay you know you know Spirit
[1185.00 - 1188.56] you're going to give me OCD on this what
[1187.00 - 1191.84] do you mean you're going to have to
[1188.56 - 1195.80] explain this because I believe in health
[1191.84 - 1198.52] I believe in healing I believe in
[1195.80 - 1201.68] anything health related what do you mean
[1198.52 - 1204.72] I shouldn't have a belief system in
[1201.68 - 1206.00] health and spirit said you have to keep
[1204.72 - 1208.40] open
[1206.00 - 1209.60] because all the modalities have
[1208.40 - 1213.36] something to
[1209.60 - 1217.08] offer all the diets have something to
[1213.36 - 1220.20] offer but you can't have a belief system
[1217.08 - 1223.60] to just one thing because there's never
[1220.20 - 1227.60] just one thing wrong with all of us and
[1223.60 - 1233.48] there's never just one thing that fixes
[1227.60 - 1237.32] all of us us and there's never just one
[1233.48 - 1241.64] belief in health or one modality only or
[1237.32 - 1244.48] one thing in health only that can help
[1241.64 - 1249.96] us and spirit said you can't have a
[1244.48 - 1251.40] belief system in one type of diet one
[1249.96 - 1254.12] type of
[1251.40 - 1256.92] diet and you can't have and the spirit
[1254.12 - 1259.48] was teaching me this I was like whoa
[1256.92 - 1262.72] okay okay I I know I I know what you're
[1259.48 - 1265.96] saying because spirit said that the
[1262.72 - 1268.40] experts behind their one belief
[1265.96 - 1272.68] system will tell
[1268.40 - 1275.80] you that kale is bad for your
[1272.68 - 1277.24] thyroid when they're wrong and kale is
[1275.80 - 1280.24] good for your
[1277.24 - 1284.36] thyroid okay because and here's here's
[1280.24 - 1287.84] how it goes the experts don't know that
[1284.36 - 1291.84] Epstein bar causes Hashimoto thyroiditis
[1287.84 - 1293.44] in until I released medical medium book
[1291.84 - 1295.32] and now they're starting to pick up on
[1293.44 - 1297.04] that they're not giving me credit but
[1295.32 - 1300.24] that doesn't matter who cares but the
[1297.04 - 1305.44] point is is at least the information's
[1300.24 - 1309.64] getting out there but kale okay kale
[1305.44 - 1312.88] kills off Epstein bar virus in the
[1309.64 - 1314.28] thyroid it kills the Epstein bar virus
[1312.88 - 1316.96] in the
[1314.28 - 1318.56] thyroid so meanwhile the food experts
[1316.96 - 1320.32] the belief system experts think that
[1318.56 - 1321.88] kale is you know goitrogenic compounds
[1320.32 - 1324.84] in there hurts your thyroid you can't
[1321.88 - 1326.64] eat it so they tell you don't eat it and
[1324.84 - 1328.16] then it becomes a belief system and then
[1326.64 - 1329.96] you're stuck you can't eat anything in
[1328.16 - 1331.56] that family you can't eat the broccoli
[1329.96 - 1333.24] you can't eat the cauliflower right you
[1331.56 - 1335.04] guys heard about this right gorog genic
[1333.24 - 1336.96] compounds hurting your thyroid you can't
[1335.04 - 1338.92] eat kale you can't eat you know collar
[1336.96 - 1341.16] greens you can't eat broccoli rob you
[1338.92 - 1344.00] can't eat kale sprouts you can't eat bok
[1341.16 - 1346.24] choy you can't eat anything okay you
[1344.00 - 1348.48] can't eat radishes you can't eat
[1346.24 - 1350.92] anything and even some other Foods
[1348.48 - 1353.04] they've even added foods to the list now
[1350.92 - 1356.00] that they think are that that they think
[1353.04 - 1359.28] messing around with the thyroid and so
[1356.00 - 1361.68] they got other Foods in the list now and
[1359.28 - 1364.52] it becomes a belief system and guess
[1361.68 - 1366.88] what it becomes poisonous meaning the
[1364.52 - 1370.68] belief system is poisonous and guess who
[1366.88 - 1372.76] it hurts it hurts us our children their
[1370.68 - 1375.32] children their children and their
[1372.76 - 1376.96] children keeps on going we can go 100
[1375.32 - 1379.64] years from this with this bad belief
[1376.96 - 1382.68] system so we can go 100 years and this
[1379.64 - 1384.52] is just one bad belief system okay see
[1382.68 - 1386.64] how it works and spirit taught me when I
[1384.52 - 1389.80] was young and said look you know you got
[1386.64 - 1391.64] to understand this belief system thing
[1389.80 - 1394.80] you know you got to you got to you got
[1391.64 - 1397.16] to know this and and I said okay you
[1394.80 - 1398.32] know what all right fine and spirit said
[1397.16 - 1399.56] okay you want to have a belief system
[1398.32 - 1401.68] for something else you want to have a
[1399.56 - 1402.76] belief system for anything else that's
[1401.68 - 1406.56] going
[1402.76 - 1409.36] on fine but not in this field not in
[1406.56 - 1412.36] this field not in alternative medicine
[1409.36 - 1415.52] not in health not in the well-being of
[1412.36 - 1417.84] others okay I said so I said to Spirit
[1415.52 - 1419.64] can I have just one belief system in
[1417.84 - 1422.32] health and spirit said what would that
[1419.64 - 1424.52] be I said cuz I have one in Mind and
[1422.32 - 1427.08] Spirit said what would that be Anthony
[1424.52 - 1429.36] and I said I believe that everybody can
[1427.08 - 1432.20] heal and I can
[1429.36 - 1436.36] believe that that not only that they can
[1432.20 - 1439.36] heal but they can rise above rise out of
[1436.36 - 1442.32] it move forward with their
[1439.36 - 1443.80] life and and get better and reclaim
[1442.32 - 1446.40] their life back and get their life back
[1443.80 - 1448.08] spirit said I like that belief system so
[1446.40 - 1451.52] I kind of was trying to one up Spirit
[1448.08 - 1454.16] there spirit said that's great okay but
[1451.52 - 1455.88] the bottom line is you guys you got your
[1454.16 - 1458.04] bottom line is when it comes down to
[1455.88 - 1461.40] meaning like a protocol or a not a
[1458.04 - 1464.20] protocol but like a exactly like a a
[1461.40 - 1465.48] regime the problem is when it comes down
[1464.20 - 1466.88] to chronic illness and we're talking
[1465.48 - 1469.08] about the Holy four fruits and
[1466.88 - 1472.36] vegetables herbs and
[1469.08 - 1475.80] spices okay wild Foods we're talking
[1472.36 - 1478.24] about those the holy four that helps get
[1475.80 - 1480.08] rid of the unforgiving four that I talk
[1478.24 - 1482.00] about in life- changing Foods when it
[1480.08 - 1484.44] comes down to those there's going to be
[1482.00 - 1485.36] Foods in this Foods in this holy for
[1484.44 - 1489.00] like
[1485.36 - 1492.44] kale that actually cleans up your
[1489.00 - 1494.16] thyroid and helps you recover from
[1492.44 - 1496.48] hypothyroidism and
[1494.16 - 1498.28] Hashimoto and other thyroid conditions
[1496.48 - 1501.28] and thyroid disease
[1498.28 - 1503.92] and the belief system that experts are
[1501.28 - 1506.04] actually creating right now which is you
[1503.92 - 1507.72] don't eat kale for your thyroid is
[1506.04 - 1510.20] detrimental you'll even see it now
[1507.72 - 1512.16] unlike shows on TV you'll see it
[1510.20 - 1514.04] anywhere now it's it's really getting
[1512.16 - 1518.64] out of control and that's a poisonous
[1514.04 - 1521.40] belief system so we have to be cautious
[1518.64 - 1524.72] about that it's really important now
[1521.40 - 1528.12] here's where it goes wrong experts in
[1524.72 - 1530.76] health don't know what causes a th thid
[1528.12 - 1533.68] problem until of course you know we we
[1530.76 - 1535.76] published medical medium but they they
[1533.68 - 1538.88] didn't know was wrong with the thyroid
[1535.76 - 1541.00] problem so to offer to offer information
[1538.88 - 1542.32] and say that kale will hurt your thyroid
[1541.00 - 1544.64] when they don't even know what causes a
[1542.32 - 1547.36] thyroid problem is where it all goes
[1544.64 - 1548.92] wrong and so that's why we're here today
[1547.36 - 1550.64] that's why we're here today to do this
[1548.92 - 1552.32] and make sure the information is right
[1550.64 - 1555.48] make sure that you have everything you
[1552.32 - 1558.12] can to heal everything in your hands all
[1555.48 - 1560.24] that you need and that that's what it's
[1558.12 - 1561.72] about this is just one example of what
[1560.24 - 1564.68] I'm trying to talk about now I talk
[1561.72 - 1567.68] about the 880,000 meals I I know broken
[1564.68 - 1569.24] record broken record just say it um I
[1567.68 - 1571.84] probably sound like a broken record
[1569.24 - 1574.96] right there I could take it I could take
[1571.84 - 1577.52] it you can tell me okay but the 80,000
[1574.96 - 1581.28] meals that I talk about all the time in
[1577.52 - 1582.96] a lifetime if we didn't eat enough meals
[1581.28 - 1585.52] because in a whole lifetime we might
[1582.96 - 1587.36] have close to 80,000 meals 990,000 meals
[1585.52 - 1590.52] 70,000 meals depending on what's going
[1587.36 - 1594.32] on depending on what's Happening and So
[1590.52 - 1597.40] within those average meals of an average
[1594.32 - 1598.92] lifetime let's just say we have to make
[1597.40 - 1601.36] sure that some of these meals start
[1598.92 - 1604.80] getting better so if we did half our
[1601.36 - 1606.72] life and 40,000 meals were up subpar
[1604.80 - 1609.12] they just weren't that great they were
[1606.72 - 1610.60] you know um many of them were bad many
[1609.12 - 1612.40] of them were processed foods many of
[1610.60 - 1615.24] them were poisonous many of them were
[1612.40 - 1616.84] over fatty foods fried foods you know
[1615.24 - 1618.68] all the stuff that you know that isn't
[1616.84 - 1621.96] great right
[1618.68 - 1624.00] and so if half of that
[1621.96 - 1625.68] lifetime was that then we got some
[1624.00 - 1627.72] making up to do and that's what I like
[1625.68 - 1630.28] about the Holy four because we got to
[1627.72 - 1632.92] start making up our meals and that's the
[1630.28 - 1636.12] plan too and you can go far with that
[1632.92 - 1639.72] you can do some serious makeup serious
[1636.12 - 1642.16] makeup and really move forward with that
[1639.72 - 1644.32] so one thing to understand too which is
[1642.16 - 1647.12] really great is all the different body
[1644.32 - 1649.04] systems we have a lot of different body
[1647.12 - 1651.16] systems you got the endocrine system
[1649.04 - 1653.60] lymphatic system okay neurological
[1651.16 - 1657.44] system reproductive system it goes on
[1653.60 - 1659.92] and on and on there's more than that so
[1657.44 - 1663.68] within all the different body systems
[1659.92 - 1666.52] that we have okay they do different
[1663.68 - 1669.12] things and they need different things so
[1666.52 - 1671.36] we need some varieties so we need some
[1669.12 - 1672.76] varieties in our Foods so when I was
[1671.36 - 1674.88] talking about you talking to that person
[1672.76 - 1676.84] about the apples the apple and the apple
[1674.88 - 1678.40] tart and everything I go were you eating
[1676.84 - 1680.32] enough fruits and
[1678.40 - 1681.64] vegetables and the person said are you
[1680.32 - 1683.36] going to try to take away my animal
[1681.64 - 1684.56] proteins I said it you know what it's
[1683.36 - 1686.40] not about that are you eating enough
[1684.56 - 1688.68] fruits and vegetables is there enough
[1686.40 - 1690.56] room for fruits and
[1688.68 - 1693.16] vegetables that that's what I just want
[1690.56 - 1695.36] to know well yeah you know I had a bagel
[1693.16 - 1698.32] this morning and I had some jelly on the
[1695.36 - 1701.04] bagel that that was pretty good and then
[1698.32 - 1704.24] you know after that um you know I had
[1701.04 - 1706.44] coffee and the coffee yeah had half and
[1704.24 - 1709.80] half in it and
[1706.44 - 1711.76] then let's see I had the apple tart and
[1709.80 - 1714.12] that was you know kind of like a lunch
[1711.76 - 1715.84] kind of thing I go well that was all you
[1714.12 - 1718.60] had for lunch I said no no I had a
[1715.84 - 1721.40] turkey sandwich before the apple tart I
[1718.60 - 1723.16] said okay and then it it keeps on going
[1721.40 - 1725.36] on and I'm like you know what there's
[1723.16 - 1728.72] just no room there's no room to put
[1725.36 - 1730.12] anything in there that you need the
[1728.72 - 1732.92] things that you need the fruits and
[1730.12 - 1736.68] vegetables you need and the holy
[1732.92 - 1740.04] four and that's what we're talking about
[1736.68 - 1741.76] today think about in your your food
[1740.04 - 1744.44] regime and this doesn't mean you have to
[1741.76 - 1746.84] feel bad let me tell you something life
[1744.44 - 1749.00] gets crazy it gets busy we get habits
[1746.84 - 1750.76] habits are developed because we we just
[1749.00 - 1752.04] they just happen it happen because we
[1750.76 - 1755.16] got so much on our plate and we're just
[1752.04 - 1756.64] doing what we got to do but think about
[1755.16 - 1760.20] you know where's the fruits and
[1756.64 - 1763.36] vegetables where's the herbs and spices
[1760.20 - 1765.16] you know where is the wild food that
[1763.36 - 1766.68] might be in your plate if you're doing
[1765.16 - 1768.36] the wild blueberries the Frozen wild
[1766.68 - 1770.52] blueberries one a day that's your wild
[1768.36 - 1772.80] food and by the way that's a fruit too
[1770.52 - 1774.48] of course and a wild food so you got
[1772.80 - 1777.44] something going on there you got
[1774.48 - 1779.76] something going on there right there
[1777.44 - 1782.36] it's the it's the Frozen wild
[1779.76 - 1784.44] blueberries recently too I was talking
[1782.36 - 1786.64] to a couple of people and they were like
[1784.44 - 1788.80] you know I don't get the wild blueberry
[1786.64 - 1790.68] part I just like the you know the
[1788.80 - 1792.40] blueberries they're aren't they all the
[1790.68 - 1794.12] same it's blueberries they're not the
[1792.40 - 1796.92] same the cultivated blueberry and the
[1794.12 - 1799.72] Half Pint clamshell at the supermarket
[1796.92 - 1801.76] in the produce section is a very weak
[1799.72 - 1803.32] food even though it's a good food for
[1801.76 - 1804.76] you don't get me wrong if that's all you
[1803.32 - 1806.60] got you better eat those regular
[1804.76 - 1808.40] cultivated blueberries but it's a weak
[1806.60 - 1811.32] food compared to the Frozen wild
[1808.40 - 1813.96] blueberry right down the aisle and
[1811.32 - 1815.72] that's make that makes up that makes up
[1813.96 - 1818.20] for all the processed food meals you
[1815.72 - 1820.88] might have eaten it starts to make it up
[1818.20 - 1824.00] when you have that Frozen wild
[1820.88 - 1825.40] blueberry every day and that stuff is
[1824.00 - 1827.00] pulling out those blueberries have
[1825.40 - 1828.56] antioxidants phytochemicals that are
[1827.00 - 1830.00] pulling out toxic heavy metals out of
[1828.56 - 1832.04] your brain so you don't get Alzheimer's
[1830.00 - 1834.44] disease so you don't get Parkinson's
[1832.04 - 1835.52] disease so you don't get dementia so you
[1834.44 - 1838.80] don't get memory
[1835.52 - 1841.12] loss okay so you don't get brain tumors
[1838.80 - 1842.84] so you don't get you know um so you
[1841.12 - 1844.36] don't get cancers in the brain so you
[1842.84 - 1846.08] don't get tumors in the brain so you
[1844.36 - 1849.16] don't get you know you know adenomas in
[1846.08 - 1851.76] the brain you know pituitary cysts and
[1849.16 - 1853.76] when you're doing those wild blueberries
[1851.76 - 1856.16] Frozen wild blueberries you're making up
[1853.76 - 1857.96] for years and years of processed food
[1856.16 - 1860.76] and or just poor quality quity food or
[1857.96 - 1863.68] food that just didn't have any real high
[1860.76 - 1865.88] nutrient value say it's not processed
[1863.68 - 1867.92] say it's home-cooked meals say it's very
[1865.88 - 1869.36] good wholesome whole homecooked meals
[1867.92 - 1872.20] but it's the same thing it's chicken
[1869.36 - 1873.44] every night for 30 years I'm not saying
[1872.20 - 1875.64] you know chicken's the worst thing in
[1873.44 - 1879.04] the world I'm saying that it doesn't
[1875.64 - 1882.32] have a lot of nutrients to make up for
[1879.04 - 1886.96] the loss of all the nutrients so we need
[1882.32 - 1889.28] to make room for more of that you know
[1886.96 - 1891.36] and I got this feeling that's that's
[1889.28 - 1893.16] pretty much what happened with the Paleo
[1891.36 - 1896.40] movement the Paleo movement was just
[1893.16 - 1898.64] just just butter tons of butter tons of
[1896.40 - 1900.84] pork tons of bacon and there's still
[1898.64 - 1902.96] some of that out there and you know tons
[1900.84 - 1905.00] of chicken tons of turkey and tons of
[1902.96 - 1908.16] meat and the Paleo movement's now moving
[1905.00 - 1910.40] to lots of fruits and vegetables with
[1908.16 - 1913.72] lower amounts of meat and I was talking
[1910.40 - 1915.96] to a Paleo expert recently and I said
[1913.72 - 1917.92] well why are you doing that and I said
[1915.96 - 1920.20] because we're seeing people get better
[1917.92 - 1922.32] more and I said so what did you see in
[1920.20 - 1924.08] the past and this paleo expert said to
[1922.32 - 1926.24] said to me well I saw in the past 5
[1924.08 - 1928.40] years ago when I got into the Paleo
[1926.24 - 1930.44] movement when I got into it 5 years ago
[1928.40 - 1932.40] I was all excited because it took away
[1930.44 - 1934.64] processed foods this is a really a
[1932.40 - 1936.12] really unknown paleo expert actually and
[1934.64 - 1938.00] he he was being honest with me and he
[1936.12 - 1940.88] was saying look when I got into it
[1938.00 - 1942.68] Anthony it was like I got into I got
[1940.88 - 1944.44] into it because it took away gluten and
[1942.68 - 1946.08] it took away processed foods and then it
[1944.44 - 1947.60] took away the grain thing where all the
[1946.08 - 1950.00] grains and all that
[1947.60 - 1951.72] and I started seeing people improve so I
[1950.00 - 1953.48] would make sure they were having an egg
[1951.72 - 1955.76] you know butter and you know butter in
[1953.48 - 1958.28] the coffee in the morning eggs you know
[1955.76 - 1960.68] eggs that whole thing and you know
[1958.28 - 1962.16] whatever milk you know whole milk and
[1960.68 - 1964.08] and then they said well then we took out
[1962.16 - 1967.20] Dairy a year later and saw more
[1964.08 - 1969.60] improvements so we just put them on pork
[1967.20 - 1972.60] you know once a day meat for dinner you
[1969.60 - 1974.40] know um pork in the morning chicken for
[1972.60 - 1977.16] lunch meat for dinner had a few
[1974.40 - 1978.92] vegetables in between and because we
[1977.16 - 1981.00] took them off of all their their heavy
[1978.92 - 1982.64] grains and we took them off of all their
[1981.00 - 1985.24] sugar and processed foods we were seeing
[1982.64 - 1987.56] some improvements but then we got kind
[1985.24 - 1989.12] of stagnant with it all I said what do
[1987.56 - 1991.68] you mean by stagnant tell me what are
[1989.12 - 1993.52] you talking about and and this paleo
[1991.68 - 1995.00] expert said well you know people just
[1993.52 - 1996.68] weren't getting people with chronic
[1995.00 - 1997.92] illness the kind of people Anthony that
[1996.68 - 1999.36] you see every day and you saw all these
[1997.92 - 2000.72] years they just weren't getting as good
[1999.36 - 2002.12] as we wanted them to get so we added
[2000.72 - 2004.44] more vegetables and we noticed they were
[2002.12 - 2006.28] starting to improve and then a year
[2004.44 - 2008.28] later we noticed they're improving more
[2006.28 - 2010.64] 3 years later we started bringing green
[2008.28 - 2012.00] juices in so now the Paleo movement's
[2010.64 - 2013.48] all with all these green juices so
[2012.00 - 2015.76] everybody's Downing these green juices
[2013.48 - 2017.24] which is amazing a miracle and then he
[2015.76 - 2019.08] said we brought and then we noticed we
[2017.24 - 2020.48] can get people better even more with
[2019.08 - 2023.28] certain green juice with just regular
[2020.48 - 2025.24] green juices and more vegetables and
[2023.28 - 2027.68] more vegetables so now we got you know
[2025.24 - 2029.88] the pale movements divided right now see
[2027.68 - 2032.00] guys it's actually divided it's crazy
[2029.88 - 2034.56] it's like how many divides can we have
[2032.00 - 2035.80] it's actually unbelievable so now I was
[2034.56 - 2037.36] talking to this you know this this this
[2035.80 - 2039.68] paleo expert and he was telling me now
[2037.36 - 2041.52] he said well you now it's like now yeah
[2039.68 - 2043.72] it's divided it's now it's this pale
[2041.52 - 2045.96] movement where it's just you know some
[2043.72 - 2047.60] nuts and seeds and some avocado and some
[2045.96 - 2051.96] some vegetables and then a handful of
[2047.60 - 2053.64] berries and and then a piece of meat and
[2051.96 - 2055.32] then the other side of the py movement's
[2053.64 - 2056.80] all pissed off at them now you know the
[2055.32 - 2058.56] people who just haven't caught up to
[2056.80 - 2060.04] that and they're like and that's what he
[2058.56 - 2061.16] was telling me he was telling me they're
[2060.04 - 2062.60] they're pissed off cuz they haven't
[2061.16 - 2064.60] caught up to it I was like well tell me
[2062.60 - 2066.96] about it and he saidwell they're still
[2064.60 - 2068.68] on the whole pork for breakfast thing'
[2066.96 - 2069.96] you know pork for breakfast thing so you
[2068.68 - 2071.52] know you don't do the fruit in the
[2069.96 - 2073.52] morning you do you don't do the berries
[2071.52 - 2074.96] in the morning you do you know the pork
[2073.52 - 2077.24] for breakfast thing and they're they're
[2074.96 - 2080.24] totally into that and then you do do you
[2077.24 - 2082.96] know one salad a day and and then you do
[2080.24 - 2084.32] the chicken and he said so it's dividing
[2082.96 - 2085.60] it's dividing and he and I said why do
[2084.32 - 2087.00] you think it that way he says because
[2085.60 - 2088.32] they're not as experienc they just don't
[2087.00 - 2091.20] know that it takes more fruits and
[2088.32 - 2093.56] vegetables more vegetables um to
[2091.20 - 2094.92] actually heal someone so I was like you
[2093.56 - 2096.92] know what everything you're telling me
[2094.92 - 2099.28] is is is is is amazing because that's
[2096.92 - 2101.64] say oh that's that's how it's happening
[2099.28 - 2102.96] he said yeah so now what we're doing is
[2101.64 - 2104.20] he said Anthony now we're doing to get
[2102.96 - 2105.56] the best results out of people we're
[2104.20 - 2107.40] doing more fruits of vegetables we
[2105.56 - 2110.36] minimizing animal proteins kind of like
[2107.40 - 2113.20] what you recommend a lot and I said
[2110.36 - 2115.68] that's incredible that's incredible and
[2113.20 - 2119.00] the reason why it moved to that degree
[2115.68 - 2120.96] you guys folks it moved to that degree
[2119.00 - 2124.12] because fruits and vegetables are the
[2120.96 - 2126.84] holy four they're the holy four that's
[2124.12 - 2128.36] what it is why do I say holy well well
[2126.84 - 2129.68] first of all the the wild blueberry is
[2128.36 - 2131.68] like the Jesus Christ food it's a
[2129.68 - 2134.08] resurrection food can literally help you
[2131.68 - 2136.76] rise out of the ashes literally
[2134.08 - 2139.04] emotionally physically mentally can help
[2136.76 - 2141.80] you rise out of the ashes so that's why
[2139.04 - 2143.00] it's a holy food and you know and and so
[2141.80 - 2145.24] many of the other foods have these
[2143.00 - 2147.48] qualities let's talk about some of these
[2145.24 - 2151.04] Foods this is just so fun
[2147.48 - 2152.00] today so let's talk about let's talk
[2151.04 - 2154.60] about some of these Foods let's talk
[2152.00 - 2157.20] about raw honey raw honey don't be
[2154.60 - 2158.68] afraid of raw honey you know know
[2157.20 - 2162.52] there's this big debate out there it's
[2158.68 - 2165.00] all sugar it's too it's sugar no it's
[2162.52 - 2168.88] sugar it's glucose it's sugar it's
[2165.00 - 2171.68] fructose and glucose it's with
[2168.88 - 2174.20] 200,000 phytochemical
[2171.68 - 2177.96] compounds gathered and I talked about
[2174.20 - 2181.56] this one time before gathered by bees
[2177.96 - 2183.92] from species plant species all over the
[2181.56 - 2187.52] place wild
[2183.92 - 2191.40] species wild flowers
[2187.52 - 2194.36] a wildf flower that we can't even eat
[2191.40 - 2196.12] meaning an herbal specimen we can't even
[2194.36 - 2197.92] eat because it's got too many alkaloids
[2196.12 - 2198.84] or it might it might be too toxic
[2197.92 - 2201.32] because there's all these different
[2198.84 - 2203.00] herbs out there that you can't eat you
[2201.32 - 2205.92] know when when you know when I do this
[2203.00 - 2207.68] wild foraging with spirit and spirit and
[2205.92 - 2209.84] I go out into the you know out into the
[2207.68 - 2211.72] bush and we go looking for things and I
[2209.84 - 2214.04] say to Spirit what's this I say to
[2211.72 - 2215.72] Spirit what's this herb what's this bush
[2214.04 - 2217.32] I say to Spirit what's this tree and
[2215.72 - 2219.64] spirit tells me what everything thing is
[2217.32 - 2221.84] is this edible is this not edible is
[2219.64 - 2223.32] this mushroom edible is it not edible
[2221.84 - 2225.08] you know the whole bit if I go through
[2223.32 - 2227.80] go go into the woods or go into the bush
[2225.08 - 2229.48] or going to you know or going to a field
[2227.80 - 2232.48] I asked spirit and that the spirit's
[2229.48 - 2235.76] been training me my whole life and um
[2232.48 - 2240.64] spirit will say that's a beautiful Wild
[2235.76 - 2243.16] Flower yes and you can't eat it you
[2240.64 - 2246.28] can't use that herb that herb is
[2243.16 - 2251.04] actually toxic but a bee can land on
[2246.28 - 2254.72] that flower and take miracle miracle
[2251.04 - 2256.24] medicine out of that flower you guys
[2254.72 - 2259.88] this is what Spirit would tell me can
[2256.24 - 2262.64] take a miracle me medicine thousands of
[2259.88 - 2265.64] compounds that can't even be studied by
[2262.64 - 2269.08] research and science can't even be
[2265.64 - 2271.64] studied it would take 500 years for them
[2269.08 - 2274.72] to know how many chemical compounds are
[2271.64 - 2276.80] in the in that flower that nectar of
[2274.72 - 2281.52] that flower right there that that be he
[2276.80 - 2284.92] just took back to the nest to make
[2281.52 - 2285.92] honey okay and then add that to other
[2284.92 - 2288.60] wild
[2285.92 - 2291.52] flowers that are edible and non-edible
[2288.60 - 2295.08] or usable and non-usable by medicine add
[2291.52 - 2297.72] that to other ones and the amount of and
[2295.08 - 2300.64] what happens is is that phytochemical
[2297.72 - 2302.92] and that flower in that one species of
[2300.64 - 2305.72] herb that we can't use the
[2302.92 - 2308.12] phytochemicals in there we can use them
[2305.72 - 2310.44] the B takes those
[2308.12 - 2312.76] phytochemicals homeopathically right
[2310.44 - 2315.60] from that flower something we can't do
[2312.76 - 2318.20] in science the bee does the lab work for
[2315.60 - 2320.48] us takes it back to the nest and
[2318.20 - 2324.04] transfers it into something usable for
[2320.48 - 2325.96] us that's a miracle cancer fighting
[2324.04 - 2329.28] disease fighting chronic illness
[2325.96 - 2331.76] fighting over 200,000 chemicals
[2329.28 - 2333.96] phytochemicals that's just the Baseline
[2331.76 - 2335.92] there are more I'm just talking about
[2333.96 - 2338.60] the Baseline the reason why I put
[2335.92 - 2341.16] 200,000 chemicals in the life-changing
[2338.60 - 2343.08] Foods book is because that's the
[2341.16 - 2345.24] powerful Foundation of how many
[2343.08 - 2347.12] chemicals are in there exactly that's
[2345.24 - 2349.68] the that's the powerful one it's a
[2347.12 - 2351.96] little over 200,000 but there's more
[2349.68 - 2354.72] that won't even be on science's radar
[2351.96 - 2356.36] for a thousand years and seriously here
[2354.72 - 2359.08] and that's raw honey so are we going to
[2356.36 - 2361.00] ignore the raw honey I mean it's it it
[2359.08 - 2363.24] can it can stop cancer from growing it
[2361.00 - 2365.84] can help us in all kinds of levels it it
[2363.24 - 2369.00] has enzymes that are not listed anywhere
[2365.84 - 2372.16] or just C discovered anywhere enzymes
[2369.00 - 2374.44] that help us heal and grow so that's raw
[2372.16 - 2376.44] honey all on its own it's it's not only
[2374.44 - 2378.64] just loaded with all the minerals
[2376.44 - 2381.40] calcium potassium zinc selenium
[2378.64 - 2383.20] phosphorus chromium miminum manganese it
[2381.40 - 2384.84] can go on and on on it's not even just
[2383.20 - 2386.80] loaded with those it's loaded with co-
[2384.84 - 2389.72] minerals like Co
[2386.80 - 2391.88] microminerals that help us to stay alive
[2389.72 - 2397.20] that's just honey alone so let's move on
[2391.88 - 2399.44] to nettle Leaf nettle Leaf the herb
[2397.20 - 2401.24] let's move on to that one you know I
[2399.44 - 2402.80] talk about the unforgiving four there's
[2401.24 - 2404.72] radiation that's in the air falling out
[2402.80 - 2406.24] of the sky from just Fukushima there's
[2404.72 - 2408.32] radiation falling out of the sky from
[2406.24 - 2409.92] going back from World War II there's
[2408.32 - 2411.88] radiation just in general that we're
[2409.92 - 2413.88] exposed to at the dental office we get
[2411.88 - 2415.84] an x-ray cuz we bump our butt or we bump
[2413.88 - 2418.88] our leg or knee we get an x-r whatever
[2415.84 - 2420.80] it is there's radiation it's everywhere
[2418.88 - 2422.28] we flying planes where all the radiation
[2420.80 - 2424.44] is it's up there so let's get it out of
[2422.28 - 2428.48] our bodies let's get it out of our
[2424.44 - 2430.24] bodies and the net Leaf does that it
[2428.48 - 2432.80] helps us it pulls out it's an
[2430.24 - 2435.72] anti-radiation wild food you can get
[2432.80 - 2437.36] natal leaf tea okay okay so check this
[2435.72 - 2439.36] out you guys say you don't have time for
[2437.36 - 2441.00] fruits and vegetables say you don't have
[2439.36 - 2442.88] time for fruits and vegetables you just
[2441.00 - 2445.32] got to eat whatever it is to survive I

[2472.60 - 2478.84] bacon if all you get you is just you
[2475.76 - 2480.60] know a few beans and a piece of chicken
[2478.84 - 2482.48] or a piece of turkey and a piece of
[2480.60 - 2484.04] salmon and that's all you can get in you
[2482.48 - 2486.88] then fine I stand behind you but let's
[2484.04 - 2489.92] do this let's get nettle Leaf Tea in you
[2486.88 - 2493.76] let's get nettle Leaf Tea in you nettle
[2489.92 - 2497.16] leaf tea just nice big cup of nettle
[2493.76 - 2499.40] leaf tea it builds up the bones it
[2497.16 - 2501.88] builds up the bones it's bone protecting
[2499.40 - 2505.64] it's bone building osteoporosis
[2501.88 - 2509.28] osteopenia it's bone fixing it's so high
[2505.64 - 2512.36] in silica Nal leaf and over 40 trace
[2509.28 - 2514.84] minerals that are bioactive bioavailable
[2512.36 - 2516.92] they go into the bones you won't hear
[2514.84 - 2518.56] this in other places you're only going
[2516.92 - 2521.40] to hear it on the show and in this book
[2518.56 - 2524.96] life-changing foods but the point is is
[2521.40 - 2527.20] that that's what it Harbors it Harbors
[2524.96 - 2529.08] that silica those bioavailable
[2527.20 - 2533.48] simulatable states of
[2529.08 - 2538.00] minerals and it has even pain reliever
[2533.48 - 2541.16] phytochemicals for pain relief in Nettle
[2538.00 - 2543.16] anti-inflammatory medicine in Nettle so
[2541.16 - 2545.20] that's what I'm talking about
[2543.16 - 2547.32] there let's try to get through this
[2545.20 - 2549.60] sweet potatoes you guys like sweet
[2547.32 - 2551.20] potatoes everybody anybody raise their
[2549.60 - 2553.16] hand who likes sweet potatoes raise
[2551.20 - 2556.64] raise your hand okay you like sweet
[2553.16 - 2559.28] potatoes awesome awesome I'm glad sweet
[2556.64 - 2562.48] potatoes are powerful a really powerful
[2559.28 - 2563.60] food okay this is what I like about this
[2562.48 - 2566.60] it
[2563.60 - 2569.12] promotes productive bacteria in the
[2566.60 - 2571.92] stomach when you eat sweet potato what
[2569.12 - 2575.44] that does is it has phytochemicals that
[2571.92 - 2578.24] purposely promote productive bacteria
[2575.44 - 2579.80] and the natural sugars in a sweet potato
[2578.24 - 2582.20] which are saturated with you know
[2579.80 - 2586.88] anti-cancerous properties those natural
[2582.20 - 2589.72] sugars they only are designed to
[2586.88 - 2593.24] stimulate productive bacteria good
[2589.72 - 2597.72] bacteria in the gut bad bacteria
[2593.24 - 2601.28] dies when it tries to feed on sweet
[2597.72 - 2602.76] potato so sibo people with sibo with all
[2601.28 - 2606.24] that strep of cacus I talk about in
[2602.76 - 2608.08] their gut strep is what's behind sibo by
[2606.24 - 2609.64] the way and no one talks about that
[2608.08 - 2611.16] you're only going to hear that here so
[2609.64 - 2612.48] anybody who just turned you know like if
[2611.16 - 2613.92] this is the first time you turned on the
[2612.48 - 2615.44] show I have to say that so you don't
[2613.92 - 2617.64] think that that information is just
[2615.44 - 2620.68] everywhere because it's not but strepa
[2617.64 - 2622.72] cacus anti antibiotic resistant strepa
[2620.68 - 2626.92] cacus is responsible for
[2622.72 - 2629.36] sibo and that when it tries to feed off
[2626.92 - 2632.72] of sweet potato it
[2629.36 - 2635.84] dies it dies or it retards or it falls
[2632.72 - 2637.44] back okay and and that's what happens
[2635.84 - 2639.48] it's the power of sweet potato that's
[2637.44 - 2641.88] why sweet potatoes help with meacon too
[2639.48 - 2645.16] they help you know knocking down
[2641.88 - 2647.20] SEI they help knock down H pylori sweet
[2645.16 - 2650.40] potatoes help kill H
[2647.20 - 2652.12] pylori and the thing is H pylori feeds
[2650.40 - 2653.32] off of eggs and it feeds off of dairy
[2652.12 - 2655.32] products milk cheese and butter if you
[2653.32 - 2658.12] take out milk cheese and butter and you
[2655.32 - 2659.44] take out egg and so you someone will say
[2658.12 - 2660.64] to me they'll be like I have eggs once a
[2659.44 - 2663.72] month I go well you're feeding your
[2660.64 - 2668.16] hpylori once a month and it might be all
[2663.72 - 2670.84] the H pylori needs just alive but if you
[2668.16 - 2673.28] take out the eggs you take out the dairy
[2670.84 - 2675.76] and then you and then you bring the
[2673.28 - 2679.92] sweet potato in you're killing off your
[2675.76 - 2682.80] H pylori how about them apples how about
[2679.92 - 2684.96] those apples so seriously helps with
[2682.80 - 2687.00] crohn's help with colitis the power of
[2684.96 - 2689.84] sweet potatoes
[2687.00 - 2692.72] amazing let's shoot to
[2689.84 - 2694.52] radishes radishes they're kind of tough
[2692.72 - 2696.52] to eat right cuz you know they're
[2694.52 - 2700.44] they're they got to they got to
[2696.52 - 2701.88] sulfur Rich taste and they're kind of
[2700.44 - 2704.12] tough to eat in that way but they're
[2701.88 - 2707.08] medicine radishes are medicine don't
[2704.12 - 2708.96] ignore them go to the supermarket if
[2707.08 - 2710.80] there's one thing to try so say you're
[2708.96 - 2712.72] on a budget and you can only get so many
[2710.80 - 2714.44] foods for your family you only got so
[2712.72 - 2716.36] much money and financially in the budget
[2714.44 - 2717.84] and you can't get you can only get so
[2716.36 - 2719.44] many things and so there's maybe
[2717.84 - 2721.68] something you can't break into yet
[2719.44 - 2723.76] you're like well I can't really start
[2721.68 - 2725.36] getting that food it's too much money in
[2723.76 - 2726.88] the budget I got to just worry about
[2725.36 - 2728.08] this other stuff try to just grab one
[2726.88 - 2732.68] thing grab
[2728.08 - 2734.44] radishes just grab radishes cuz radishes
[2732.68 - 2736.80] protect us from heart disease protect us
[2734.44 - 2739.08] from heart attack protect us from heart
[2736.80 - 2740.84] problems viral conditions that cause
[2739.08 - 2743.24] heart disease that are not on the radar
[2740.84 - 2745.56] of of modern medicine or research and
[2743.24 - 2747.56] science that Spirit knows about you name
[2745.56 - 2751.16] it cardiovascular
[2747.56 - 2752.92] issues um cholesterol problems bad
[2751.16 - 2754.88] cholesterol you want to help start
[2752.92 - 2757.92] lowering bad cholesterol you bring
[2754.88 - 2760.24] radishes in and if you bring radishes in
[2757.92 - 2763.92] every day that's when the magic starts
[2760.24 - 2765.16] to happen you bring them in every day
[2763.92 - 2766.84] and you start knocking down bad
[2765.16 - 2768.60] cholesterol radishes bring back the
[2766.84 - 2771.48] liver liver problems cause high
[2768.60 - 2774.44] cholesterol and elevated blood pressure
[2771.48 - 2775.92] radishes help clean that up here's the
[2774.44 - 2778.88] best part of radishes I like you know
[2775.92 - 2780.76] how there's all this Prebiotic talk you
[2778.88 - 2784.04] know what foods are prebiotics and so
[2780.76 - 2786.80] forth radishes are the most powerful
[2784.04 - 2789.20] Prebiotic there is most powerful
[2786.80 - 2790.68] Prebiotic in the gut there is is radish
[2789.20 - 2793.40] it's one of the most powerful it's right
[2790.68 - 2795.88] on the top of the list actually it's
[2793.40 - 2798.52] actually the radishes are the second
[2795.88 - 2801.00] most powerful Prebiotic there is next to
[2798.52 - 2804.00] Wild blueberry which is the first most
[2801.00 - 2806.92] powerful Prebiotic in existence the
[2804.00 - 2810.16] Frozen wild blueberry is the most
[2806.92 - 2812.12] powerful Prebiotic in existence and then
[2810.16 - 2815.08] the radishes are
[2812.12 - 2817.32] second and so and then radish greens
[2815.08 - 2819.96] they got phyto chemicals cancer fighting
[2817.32 - 2822.64] alkaloids that fight cancers so that's
[2819.96 - 2824.36] what that's what these greens have get
[2822.64 - 2825.96] the ones with the fresh greens cuz you
[2824.36 - 2827.36] want to wash those greens give them a
[2825.96 - 2829.28] little rinse and you want to actually
[2827.36 - 2832.88] have those in your salad they have
[2829.28 - 2835.32] antiviral properties they knock down
[2832.88 - 2837.44] viruses and that's a big deal that's a
[2835.32 - 2840.16] really big deal so that's
[2837.44 - 2842.60] radishes we got little time left we got
[2840.16 - 2845.52] to get through this leafy greens bring
[2842.60 - 2847.68] them in very important leafy greens if
[2845.52 - 2849.76] you think you have a hard time digesting
[2847.68 - 2851.48] digesting leafy greens you really don't
[2849.76 - 2853.12] you're you're digesting them fine you
[2851.48 - 2854.68] just feel them that means you have
[2853.12 - 2856.48] sensitivities you have you have
[2854.68 - 2858.64] sensitive nerves in the gut or the
[2856.48 - 2861.88] intestinal tract and you're feeling the
[2858.64 - 2864.24] roughage of the leafy green move on down
[2861.88 - 2866.60] but you are digesting it I promise you
[2864.24 - 2868.24] that so if you don't like the way that
[2866.60 - 2869.88] feels if you have if you're sensitive
[2868.24 - 2871.96] like that then eat a little bit of leafy
[2869.88 - 2874.12] green some people can eat tons of them
[2871.96 - 2876.04] they have less you know less you know
[2874.12 - 2877.76] nerves are less sensitive cuz they're
[2876.04 - 2879.44] not chronically feeling you know too
[2877.76 - 2882.24] many nerve problems I know people that
[2879.44 - 2884.28] have anxiety or sensitive nerves in
[2882.24 - 2886.36] their tummy and they're inflamed they
[2884.28 - 2888.28] tend to try to eat mush and only kind of
[2886.36 - 2890.64] like cooked mush and like just oatmeal
[2888.28 - 2892.80] and stuff because it or eggs and oatmeal
[2890.64 - 2896.08] and cheese and all that so they don't
[2892.80 - 2897.72] feel it rub their intestinal lining you
[2896.08 - 2901.04] know what you what so what happens is
[2897.72 - 2902.92] when you eat a green a lettuce it's
[2901.04 - 2905.16] rubbing the Linings of the intestinal
[2902.92 - 2908.56] tract to clean out eoli and clean out
[2905.16 - 2910.08] strep and seff and all and staff and all
[2908.56 - 2911.92] bad you know and other things that we
[2910.08 - 2913.44] worry about worms and you know and
[2911.92 - 2915.92] different parasites people are concerned
[2913.44 - 2919.16] about out there you know it pulls all
[2915.92 - 2921.52] that out um very important to understand
[2919.16 - 2925.88] celery
[2921.52 - 2930.68] juice celery juice celery has a
[2925.88 - 2933.28] bioactive sodium okay it contains
[2930.68 - 2936.48] co-actor microtrace mineral
[2933.28 - 2938.76] salts all right yet discovered by
[2936.48 - 2942.08] science and research these are different
[2938.76 - 2943.92] varieties of sodiums in celery they just
[2942.08 - 2945.56] haven't been able to literally in the
[2943.92 - 2948.16] lab figure out the different
[2945.56 - 2951.24] compositions that that that are actually
[2948.16 - 2953.92] in celery the different sodium salts
[2951.24 - 2956.32] this is why it fixes digestive problems
[2953.92 - 2959.12] it raises hydrochloric acid fixes the
[2956.32 - 2962.40] liver heals the liver changes people's
[2959.12 - 2965.12] guts around completely Crohn's colitis
[2962.40 - 2968.16] IBS all kinds of irritable bowel issues

[3088.76 - 3093.92] afraid of the sugar and dates dates
[3090.96 - 3096.40] eliminate literally almost every bug
[3093.92 - 3098.84] that exists in the intestinal tract they
[3096.40 - 3101.00] don't feed bugs they get rid of it if
[3098.84 - 3102.96] there's an overgrowth a Candida
[3101.00 - 3104.88] someone's concerned about dates lower
[3102.96 - 3106.36] the overgrowth so that you have the
[3104.88 - 3107.84] candida you're supposed to have which
[3106.36 - 3110.20] keeps Us Alive by the way you don't want
[3107.84 - 3111.52] to get rid of all your candida cuz we
[3110.20 - 3113.44] will die if we get rid of all our
[3111.52 - 3115.92] candida you have to keep some of it

[3115.92 - 3119.08] you heard me talk about that somewhere
[3117.32 - 3120.68] else in one of the other shows so if you
[3119.08 - 3122.48] ever want to you know just look at the
[3120.68 - 3125.60] candida chapter in the in the mm book
[3122.48 - 3127.80] too the medical medium book the dates
[3125.60 - 3130.20] literally help get rid of all these
[3127.80 - 3134.12] poisons too they grab onto poisons
[3130.20 - 3136.16] dragging them out of the body high in
[3134.12 - 3138.04] potassium for neurotransmitters as well
[3136.16 - 3139.40] dates help restore neurotransmitters so
[3138.04 - 3141.56] when people are depressed because of
[3139.40 - 3143.96] Epstein bar or people are depressed
[3141.56 - 3146.28] because of toxic heavy metals and their

[3149.64 - 3155.76] trace the 70 trace minerals and
[3152.28 - 3158.60] potassium help bring that back maybe we

[3160.32 - 3165.80] Apple okay never underestimate the power
[3163.88 - 3167.12] of the Apple it is one of the most
[3165.80 - 3169.04] powerful
[3167.12 - 3171.12] anti-inflammatory we're talking about in
[3169.04 - 3172.36] sephtis which is brain inflammation
[3171.12 - 3174.16] we're talking about irritable bowel
[3172.36 - 3176.28] intestinal problems you know we're
[3174.16 - 3178.16] talking about viral infection that cause
[3176.28 - 3181.52] all the inflammation we talk about
[3178.16 - 3184.08] apples are medicine do not we cannot
[3181.52 - 3187.24] deny the power of the Apple it's the

[3195.16 - 3199.20] material from old protein stuck on the
[3197.36 - 3201.52] sides of the impacted on the sides of
[3199.20 - 3204.52] the intestinal tract apples get rid of
[3201.52 - 3205.72] it and apples get rid of sibo knocking
[3204.52 - 3207.36] down strep
[3205.72 - 3211.84] and they're loaded with manganese and
[3207.36 - 3212.88] mbum you can't avoid apples my friends
[3211.84 - 3215.24] they
[3212.88 - 3217.36] can't couple of other ones we don't have
[3215.24 - 3219.56] time to explain so much but
[3217.36 - 3221.32] cilantro don't be afraid of cilantro you
[3219.56 - 3224.64] know that taste when people feel like
[3221.32 - 3226.32] they they they have a genetic resistance
[3224.64 - 3228.08] against cilantro they don't have a
[3226.32 - 3230.36] genetic problem that's not what it is
[3228.08 - 3232.64] that's not why they don't like the taste
[3230.36 - 3233.88] so understand that that's not why it's
[3232.64 - 3236.80] just that when you eat cilantro and
[3233.88 - 3238.64] you're really toxic it can really taste
[3236.80 - 3240.56] bad if you eat cilantro and and you're
