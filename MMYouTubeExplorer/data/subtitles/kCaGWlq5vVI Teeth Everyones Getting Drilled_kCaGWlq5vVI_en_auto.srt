away from fruit it makes them shy away

186
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,360
from

187
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:24,660
bananas mangoes papayas Cherries Berries

188
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:27,960
apples it makes them afraid to eat the

189
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:29,280
foods that actually help our teeth and

190
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,159
that's what happens out there because we

191
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,959
think we lump all sugar as the same

192
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,000
that's what professionals do out there

193
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:38,519
that's what health Advocates do

194
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,440
professionals whatever they lump sugar

195
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:43,140
all together and then they're afraid of

196
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:45,000
having a piece of fruit Olivia Lett says

197
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:47,040
it's really an incredible podcast for

198
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,500
outbreaking science as usual nobody

199
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,959
knows that advanced science incredible

200
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,519
Olivia incredibly listened to it so

201
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:55,500
honored and thank you for being here

202
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,600
again right Kara says I just listened to

203
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:00,660
your podcast on teeth was really curious

204
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:03,360
about the not doing everything at once

205
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:05,040
is that just for teeth so not doing

206
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,860
everything at once

207
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,720
so you can baby step to take care of

208
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:13,200
yourself and your health you know some

209
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:16,140
people do lemon water celery juice some

210
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,060
people do 369 Advanced cleanse some

211
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:20,459
people do the monocleanse some people do

212
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:22,560
protocols for their autoimmune and every

213
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:25,080
bit counts you know you got to customize

214
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:28,620
too but the key is right

215
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:31,140
the key is is to make sure that you

216
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:33,180
don't fall into Fruit fear because the

217
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:34,800
fruit fear will get everybody every time

218
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:38,399
and I'll tell you why what happens is

219
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:40,620
that when we get fruit fear we then get

220
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,140
afraid of the things we need and that's

221
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:45,600
how it always works and we end up eating

222
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:47,399
chocolate once again we end up eating

223
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,980
all the chocolate that's the thing we do

224
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:51,660
so we go for that because we're not

225
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:54,360
getting our fruit sugar we're not

226
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:56,100
getting our glucose right so when it

227
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,800
comes down to fruit you're getting your

228
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:01,980
minerals your trace minerals to help

229
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:05,040
restore your teeth fruit is alkaline

230
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:08,220
remember that alkaline is the way to go

231
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:10,620
it's not about sugar sugar isn't why

232
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,600
people have teeth problems okay we'll

233
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:15,899
cover that in another minute so it's

234
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,880
about being alkaline internally but we

235
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:20,160
can't be alkaline when we're eating

236
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,839
everything that's not alkaline and you

237
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,000
know people say well no that's not true

238
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,760
you know I eat really good and you know

239
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,740
I eat eat lean protein I'm keto or I'm

240
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,360
vegan and I'm keto and I eat beans and I

241
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,920
eat nut Butters and not all that's

242
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,980
acidic so

243
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,060
so we actually eat acidic Foods that's

244
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:38,519
all we do

245
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:41,100
so we eat lots of acidic Foods they

246
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:43,500
don't digest well they don't break down

247
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,600
well in the stomach that's what happens

248
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,399
you know they don't break well in the

249
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,680
stomach and boom

250
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:51,720
so somebody said hey we lost 250 people

251
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,220
really quick in a blip yeah that's what

252
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,200
happens on here all the time people

253
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:57,839
actually get kicked off all the time on

254
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,700
the medical medium lives not by us so

255
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,500
you guys medical medium podcasts at

256
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,480
Apple podcast just launched three new

257
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,640
episodes you guys gotta check it out

258
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,920
when you get a chance teeth everyone's

259
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:10,500
getting drilled important pertinent

260
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,480
information critical information to

261
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,760
protect yourself right Doreen says such

262
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,680
Common Sense fruit is alkaline fruit is

263
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:19,320
actually alkaline it's about what's

264
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:21,720
happening inside the body right inside

265
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,339
your stomach your intestinal tract your

266
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:26,160
gut your liver it's about what's

267
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:29,459
happening here that protects here that's

268
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:33,420
the key what happens in here protects

269
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:36,300
here right that's how it works so we

270
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:39,899
protect our teeth by what we're doing

271
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:41,399
inside here okay so people walk around

272
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:43,380
with stomachs that aren't working good

273
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:45,540
low hydrochloric acid they don't break

274
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:48,540
down their proteins they rot ammonia

275
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:50,880
happens ammonia creeps up

276
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:52,620
into the mouth when you're sleeping at

277
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,000
night so let's cover ammonia for a

278
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,019
couple of minutes so here's what happens

279
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,320
right

280
00:11:55,019 --> 00:12:01,200
we're really acidic more than that our

281
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,420
HCL doesn't work more than that our bile

282
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,820
reserves are low we don't break down our

283
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:08,760
proteins we don't break down our food

284
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:11,160
right our fats and protein it goes

285
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:14,600
rancid and then we go to bed

286
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:17,720
we lay in bed and ammonia from the gut

287
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:21,000
creeps up like the ghost in the night

288
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:24,540
creeps off the up the esophagus right

289
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,380
goes into the mouth and it sits into the

290
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:28,079
mouth

291
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:29,839
while you're sleeping when that ammonia

292
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:34,200
sits in the mouth while you're sleeping

293
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:38,100
it goes into the gums and teeth it has a

294
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:40,680
an ability to basically travel through

295
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,480
bone that's what ammonia does travels

296
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,880
through bone which is your teeth and it

297
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,820
weakens them and people end up having

298
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:51,180
weakened teeth along the way

299
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:52,800
so so what happens is when your proteins

300
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:54,240
and your fats aren't digesting well

301
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,100
because it's not digesting well for

302
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,519
virtually almost everybody

303
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:03,300
all that gas build up in the gut right

304
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,680
that putrification that rancid fat

305
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,620
builds up

306
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:10,980
all that ammonia gets produced from it

307
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:12,180
putrefying travels up the esophagus sits

308
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:14,579
in your mouth at night when you're

309
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:16,860
sleeping and starts to break down the

310
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:20,940
teeth this process can break people's

311
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:22,680
teeth down real fast real quick and then

312
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,880
things can start falling apart from

313
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,040
there right

314
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,660
so

315
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,820
so um

316
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:32,459
back to the whole sugar thing right

317
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:34,920
sugar isn't the problem it's the other

318
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:37,440
stuff sugar is with

319
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:40,440
so it's the other things like I was

320
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:43,620
showing you guys earlier okay this

321
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:45,360
chocolate cake isn't all sugar see so

322
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:47,579
when someone says well I quit sugar I'm

323
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,320
avoiding sugar Sugar's the problem

324
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:51,899
that's where it is

325
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,339
they're really they're only benefiting

326
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:55,199
not because they're avoiding sugar

327
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:58,500
they're benefiting because they're

328
00:13:55,199 --> 00:14:01,740
avoiding the lard and the butter and the

329
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:05,699
dyes and the chemicals and the additives

330
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:08,100
right in the hydrogenated oils right and

331
00:14:05,699 --> 00:14:10,320
you can even be doing a healthier piece

332
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:12,839
of cake but that could have vegetable

333
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,980
oils in it that can still have other

334
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:15,660
things in it and you might think

335
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:18,180
Butter's healthy and you just got butter

336
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:21,300
in your cake but either way

337
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:24,360
what happens is it's the fats or you got

338
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:26,699
eggs in your cake either way it's the

339
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:29,760
fats that actually cause the problem

340
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:32,699
it's not the sugar and so people don't

341
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,320
realize right people be like well don't

342
00:14:32,699 --> 00:14:37,139
have apple pie because all that Sugar

343
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,880
they actually call this sugar I I see it

344
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:40,500
for years I've seen it for years I see

345
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,500
it now people say oh you don't want a

346
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:46,199
piece of pie so much sugar yeah they put

347
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:47,760
a half a cup of sugar in a pie they'll

348
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:49,920
put a cup of sugar in a Pie when they

349
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,800
make one but you wouldn't believe how

350
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,839
much fat lard and butter is in the pot

351
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,120
that's where the culprit is now

352
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:59,519
processed sugar is not good for us by

353
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,199
itself we don't just eat sugar all day

354
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,060
long this is brown sugar right here

355
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,339
we're not like did you have your bowl of

356
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:06,959
sugar today did you have like your whole

357
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:08,579
bowl of sugar today this is really good

358
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,139
I'm just gonna have my whole bowl of

359
00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:12,180
sugar right now did you have one I have

360
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:13,740
it three times a day so I eat a whole

361
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:16,139
bowl of brown sugar three times a day

362
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:18,660
you guys I better quit my sugar

363
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:21,060
I'm having way too much sugar no that's

364
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:23,940
not what happens people get

365
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:25,860
people get all this fat involved with

366
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:28,199
their food like the ice cream people

367
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:30,660
think ice cream sugar that's what they

368
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:32,399
think they're always like yeah too much

369
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:34,800
sugar in that ice cream you hear it all

370
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:37,079
the time that's the problem right that's

371
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,959
not the problem it's actually the fat

372
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:42,660
and the ice cream right and the protein

373
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:44,759
the milk proteins right and the fat they

374
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:46,980
don't break down they don't digest well

375
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:49,620
they rot in the stomach and your teeth

376
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:51,120
go that's how it works Marissa spiritual

377
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:54,300
says thank you so much for bringing Dr

378
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,440
Nesbitt out aw yeah Dr Nesbitt wanted to

379
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:58,500
come out

380
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,839
so I'm really glad he did

381
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:04,019
so anyway

382
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:06,120
shellini says if I do not have iPhone

383
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:08,399
how can I listen to Apple podcast go to

384
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:10,560
Spotify but I can't guarantee

385
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,839
it's not going to be glitched out right

386
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,279
we noticed that Apple podcast right and

387
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:17,279
I've always said that medical medium

388
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:19,440
podcast at Apple podcast it it's never

389
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:21,480
censored it's never glitched out it's so

390
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,639
far we've been really fortunate so but

391
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,740
if you don't have your iPhone just you

392
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:26,639
know Spotify right that's what I would

393
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:29,100
do

394
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,899
so anyway you guys back to what we're

395
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,100
talking about the teeth episode you got

396
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:34,800
to check it out when you get a chance

397
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:36,300
it's an amazing episode in the sense

398
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,120
that it has a lot of detailed

399
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:40,139
information about how to protect her

400
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,120
teeth

401
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:43,920
and that's the key because we can go to

402
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,079
the dentist we can brush our teeth but

403
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:49,380
why are they still falling apart

404
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:50,940
right for so many people so and I've

405
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:52,560
always said it right teeth are like time

406
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:56,339
capsules right they fall apart they

407
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:59,639
crumble from within years later

408
00:16:56,339 --> 00:17:01,320
and we don't know why but they do and

409
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:03,180
then if you're trying something new and

410
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,980
then and your teeth happen to be falling

411
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:06,480
apart in that moment when you're trying

412
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,980
something new you think it was because

413
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,860
of what you were doing right there in

414
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:12,959
that moment Meanwhile your teeth were on

415
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:15,600
the trajectory of falling apart they

416
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:18,000
were already on they were on that

417
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:20,760
trajectory of falling apart it's all

418
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,900
about timing when do they fall apart do

419
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,100
they fall apart when you're taking a

420
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:25,020
trip one day and you're going to think

421
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:26,819
that trip did it are they falling apart

422
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:28,199
when you went swimming that day next

423
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:29,820
thing you know next you know that week

424
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:31,440
it's like oh why am I having a tooth

425
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,700
problem now I gotta go to a dentist was

426
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,580
it because I went swimming that week

427
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:37,080
it's all about timing did it fall apart

428
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:39,539
because you tried a new diet that week

429
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:42,419
right it just doesn't happen that quick

430
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:45,059
right but it falls apart as we're doing

431
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:48,059
stuff we're doing stuff for years we're

432
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:50,340
doing coffee we're doing vinegar you can

433
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:53,520
talk to like virtually anybody in health

434
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:54,960
okay except for maybe like a lot of the

435
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,360
medical medium Community but you can

436
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,700
talk to virtually anybody in health and

437
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:02,160
there's the leading vinegar heck they're

438
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,900
taking vinegar shots not they're doing

439
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,720
vinegar gummies

440
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:08,820
with people in health are doing vinegar

441
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,919
all the time but it's like whoa that's a

442
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:12,660
way to kill your teeth real bad Joe

443
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:14,700
Anderson says I recently heard an

444
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:16,500
influencer talking about waiting to

445
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:19,799
brush your teeth after you have a

446
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:22,140
smoothie or after you eat fruit

447
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:24,000
yeah well that that makes perfect sense

448
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:26,460
as far as for an influencer to say that

449
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,980
then missing that's misinformation but

450
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:30,660
exactly that influencer thought fruit

451
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:33,179
sugar was going to destroy your teeth

452
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:35,520
now think about that message right now

453
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:37,919
if I was to hear that and I was somebody

454
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,500
a follower to this influencer

455
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:43,559
and I heard that and they were like so

456
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:46,740
yeah what I like to do is after I have

457
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:49,200
my smoothie I then well after I had my

458
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:51,179
piece of fruit here's a mango right here

459
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,539
after I have my piece of fruit everybody

460
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:57,480
what I do is I brush my teeth afterwards

461
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:59,820
okay so make sure fruit scares the [ __ ]

462
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,559
out all you because you know what you're

463
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:03,660
gonna all lose your teeth that's why I'm

464
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:07,559
brushing my teeth after I have my fruit

465
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:09,539
you guys so yeah like make sure I scare

466
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:11,640
you to death about eating fruit oh I'm

467
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:13,559
having my fruit I'm having my smoothie

468
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,539
but I gotta brush my teeth after because

469
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:17,520
you're gonna lose your teeth my dentist

470
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:20,520
told me I'm gonna lose all my teeth

471
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,320
because after my fruit smoothie I better

472
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:25,740
brush my teeth right

473
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:27,900
so so yeah I mean exactly right so

474
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:29,640
that's that's how it works

475
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,080
so then people are gonna be scared

476
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,179
that's what they're gonna be that's what

477
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,039
they're going to be scared of right

478
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:37,440
but you want to wait to brush your teeth

479
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:39,000
you want to wait to brush your teeth at

480
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,039
different times you don't have to like

481
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,840
you don't have to worry about that point

482
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:45,000
that doesn't make a set make sense but

483
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,679
if you have chocolate

484
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,720
you might want to brush your teeth after

485
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:51,000
you had all that chocolate right so

486
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:54,480
they're going to worry about fruit

487
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,700
and fruit acids fruit acids are alkaline

488
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,520
fruit acids don't hurt teeth

489
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:01,740
fruit assets actually kill bad bacteria

490
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,900
in your mouth but they'll go and eat

491
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:05,760
chocolate they'll have a chocolate bar

492
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:08,400
and not brush their teeth afterwards

493
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,600
right that's the time if you want to

494
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,919
brush your teeth and you're worried

495
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,440
about something you brush them after

496
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:16,140
coffee and chocolate right

497
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,179
and um

498
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:20,280
so yeah so the thing is they they're

499
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:22,020
trying to brush their teeth after they

500
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,820
eat fruit because they think they're

501
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:25,200
worried about acid from the fruit and

502
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:27,600
fruit sugar and they're thinking they're

503
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,299
worried about both that right so people

504
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,460
always worry oh is fruit acidic it's not

505
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:34,679
it's actually alkaline it helps somebody

506
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:38,100
is what it does it helps you it's

507
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:40,320
alkaline when fruit hits the digestive

508
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:43,080
system it actually enters the mouth like

509
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,940
lemon water it's instantly alkaline Deb

510
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:47,039
says I don't use vinegar that's amazing

511
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:50,039
Deb that's so good

512
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:51,720
so many people use vinegar and don't

513
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:54,360
even know it I'm glad you know that you

514
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:57,000
don't right and that's key but vinegar

515
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:58,679
is hidden Deb make sure you figure that

516
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,419
out now you might not actually use

517
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:02,280
vinegar where you open up the vinegar

518
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:04,500
bottle and you're pouring it on

519
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:07,020
something you might not be using it that

520
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,400
way but is it any condiments in there is

521
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:11,100
it is it in something like that the

522
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,900
refrigerator is it in your Salsas is it

523
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,340
in some salty head at a restaurant did

524
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,200
you have a salad dressing at a

525
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:18,419
restaurant did you have like anything

526
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:21,000
like that is there's packaged food with

527
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:22,919
dehydrated vinegar on it I saw kale

528
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,840
chips out there with dehydrated vinegar

529
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:26,640
in it right like it's all that stuff

530
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,919
it's hidden everywhere so you got to

531
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,720
kind of look out for it right Misty

532
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:33,659
Lewis says yeah before my dentist told

533
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,460
me to stop my lemons and fruits so I

534
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:37,620
just don't tell him anymore laugh out

535
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:39,539
loud that I already restarted it at Full

536
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:40,980
Speed Ahead well that's what they do the

537
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:43,740
dentist will tell you to stay away from

538
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:45,960
your lemons stay away from your fruit is

539
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:47,700
wilted too but what the dentist doesn't

540
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:51,059
tell you right

541
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:54,299
is that all these patients the dentist

542
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:56,640
has that are losing their teeth getting

543
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:58,260
all the dental work done all the

544
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,140
fillings and everything else they

545
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:04,200
weren't using lemons as a primary diet

546
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:06,600
Source they weren't using fruit as a

547
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,919
primary diet source so if you go into a

548
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:10,080
dentist office and you sit in the

hope people have great dentists so

571
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:04,200
mineral deficiencies I talk about that

572
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:07,200
during this episode inherited toxins and

573
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:10,799
poisons from the family line so we pass

574
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:13,620
on poisons and toxins like DDT

575
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:16,500
down the family line toxic heavy metals

576
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:19,620
right so it's more than just food

577
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:21,299
that's why someone right someone's

578
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:23,220
eating a certain way but they don't have

579
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:24,659
any cavities somebody else is eating the

580
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:27,360
same way but they have a lot of cavities

581
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:30,240
because we have lowered immune systems

582
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:32,580
that's a key right there bad bacteria

583
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,039
right in our body that's another key

584
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:37,740
there low-grade viral infections mineral

585
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:39,480
deficiencies heavy metals Mercury is a

586
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:40,980
big one if someone's high in mercury

587
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,360
they're going to have more teeth

588
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:45,659
problems and I'm not even talking about

589
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:48,120
amalgams so you guys I also talk about

590
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:50,100
amalgams in this episode so if any of

591
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:52,679
you guys have mercury fillings

592
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:55,740
silver filling still in your mouth you

593
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:57,900
might want to hear this right

594
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:59,279
um Nance says I think my teeth issues

595
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:02,279
were from doing the vinegar every

596
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:06,000
morning for years and years diet crap

597
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:09,299
Etc now I drink lemon water incredible

598
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,120
see the vinegar do so much damage for so

599
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:15,059
many years for people and when people

600
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:17,279
think they can use a straw and that

601
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:20,580
that's all they need is a straw

602
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:22,919
and then just bypass your teeth it

603
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:25,620
doesn't work they're misinformed because

604
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:29,100
it's the vinegar entering into the body

605
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:31,500
itself the body then has a reaction to

606
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:33,600
the vinegar what the body does

607
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:35,940
is the body has to neutralize the

608
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:39,299
vinegar to acidic

609
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:42,240
so acidic the body can go into acidosis

610
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:44,520
so to stop the human body somebody's

611
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,919
body from going into acidosis it has to

612
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:48,120
release calcium from your teeth and

613
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:51,600
bones

614
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:53,820
so the only way to protect yourself when

615
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,860
you're drinking vinegar taking a vinegar

616
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:58,860
shot apple cider vinegar in your cooking

617
00:24:55,860 --> 00:25:00,120
in a sauce in a dressing the only way to

618
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:03,120
protect yourself

619
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:04,919
from the damaging effects of vinegar

620
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,559
is your body

621
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:09,900
actually taking calcium from your bones

622
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:12,299
and teeth to neutralize the acid so you

623
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:14,400
don't get acidosis and your kidneys

624
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:17,220
don't start going downhill

625
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:19,799
so important to know Carrie

626
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:21,659
says my teeth and gums have got much

627
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:23,460
better since shrinking lemon water and

628
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:26,340
celery juice thank you isn't that

629
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:28,080
amazing lemon water like that's

630
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:30,539
incredible right

631
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:33,059
and you know what you can do lemon water

632
00:25:30,539 --> 00:25:35,100
and you can do limes too so I got some

633
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:36,960
limes and lemons right here Maria

634
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:38,820
actually says a lot of functional

635
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,500
doctors still pushing apple cider

636
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:42,840
vinegar to help with low acid and

637
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:45,059
stomach Dear God

638
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:46,740
would apple cider vinegar does I've

639
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:47,880
talked about this for years is it

640
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,919
destroys

641
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:53,279
your gastric glands

642
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:56,520
so the very HCL producers think about

643
00:25:53,279 --> 00:26:00,059
this inside your stomach are gastric

644
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:03,120
glands they produce HCL

645
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:05,760
that HCL is your good asset

646
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,020
so if a functional medicine Doctor is

647
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,419
recommending

648
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:12,200
vinegar apple cider vinegar

649
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:15,360
for an acid stomach what they're doing

650
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:17,640
is they're helping to destroy and

651
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,620
basically fry out the gastric gland so

652
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:22,140
you can't produce as much hydrochloric

653
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:25,200
acid to save your butt they actually it

654
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:26,580
works backwards it doesn't help but

655
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,159
that's how it works in alternative

656
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:30,539
medicine right you just you just try

657
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:32,940
different things and been there done

658
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:35,460
that try things and not all acids are

659
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:36,740
the same you guys it's not the same

660
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:40,080
thing

661
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:43,740
bacteria like streptococcus inside your

662
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:48,480
gut produces a different kind of acid

663
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:50,460
a bad acid right that bad acid is

664
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:54,000
different than your hydrochloric acid

665
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:57,059
your good acid in your stomach two

666
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,500
different kinds of acids really

667
00:26:57,059 --> 00:27:01,860
important to know

668
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:06,360
so this acid

669
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:08,340
is not a remedy for either one for

670
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:10,980
somebody who has low HCL or someone who

671
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:13,020
has bacteria in their stomach so that's

672
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:15,600
critical to know are bacteria inside

673
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:16,980
their intestinal tract so and that's why

674
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,440
a lot of people they have so many

675
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:21,419
problems but what is guaranteed when you

676
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,220
do the vinegar route

677
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:24,899
you're going to have teeth problems down

678
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:27,179
the road unless you do something to turn

679
00:27:24,899 --> 00:27:28,460
it around right

680
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:32,539
yeah

681
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:32,539
and all that's important

682
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:38,820
so anyway Jennifer says he's having a

683
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:41,100
hard time being taken hard time wait

684
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:43,320
he's having a hard enough time being

685
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:46,860
taken seriously he can't afford to be

686
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:49,020
funny at this point well Jennifer I try

687
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:51,539
my best you know I'm only human I'm

688
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:54,059
trying to deliver information so it's

689
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:55,740
entertaining as well and I like having a

690
00:27:54,059 --> 00:27:59,159
little bit of fun because I spent 35

691
00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:01,860
years helping people rise out of the

692
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:04,380
ashes from the depths of hell and back

693
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:06,779
to get their lives back people who were

694
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:08,760
bedridden couldn't even walk or take a

695
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:10,980
shower people who needed to get out of

696
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:14,340
their wheelchairs been helping doctors

697
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:18,000
all these years and I'm not like seeking

698
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:21,600
credibility I want people better and

699
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,340
healing keeping a light heart Joy a

700
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:26,700
little bit of humor can help people who

701
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:30,059
are actually on mattress Island right so

702
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:32,640
it's to keep a light heart and so that's

703
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:34,740
that's the whole thing right and the

704
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:37,380
skits I do are actually things that

705
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:39,659
happen so the skits I do Jennifer this

706
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:42,480
is important to know the schizo View

707
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:43,799
there's truth in the skits keep that in

708
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,840
mind right

709
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:47,580
so when I talk about different things in

710
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,559
all these skits if you look back at all

711
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:51,299
my comedy skits right

712
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:53,279
and the parodies and everything I do

713
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:54,539
you'll see there's something to learn

714
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:56,520
from it

715
00:28:54,539 --> 00:28:59,880
and that's important the other thing is

716
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:01,919
if you're sick and you're bedridden or a

717
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:04,320
mattress island or couch Island and

718
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:06,840
you've had like a reduced quality of

719
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:09,299
life because of it you can't work you

720
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:11,880
can't exercise a light heart and a

721
00:29:09,299 --> 00:29:13,080
little Joy is always a good thing and I

722
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,940
have to think about people who are

723
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:18,240
chronically ill there's people out there

724
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:21,240
chronically sick and they can use like a

725
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:23,760
giggle it's so important Jamie says fun

726
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:25,980
fun fun love it incredible

727
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:28,260
accordion says no it's better to be

728
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:30,779
funny laughter helps the stress it does

729
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:32,640

the reason why like medical medium

information uses like leafy greens

838
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:48,299
and I know everybody gets all burned up

839
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:51,000
about this but the health movement

840
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:53,640
wasn't about leafy greens years ago okay

841
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,559
and I was always leafy greens eat a

842
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,880
pound of spinach spinach soup medical

843
00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:58,500
medium spinach soup and people like

844
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,360
iceberg lettuce

845
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:03,720
Professionals in the health field 25

846
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:05,940
years ago okay 30 years ago were like

847
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:08,339
iceberg lettuce was it when you said

848
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:10,500
lettuce or a salad right I was like no

849
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:11,879
you've got to have your kale Your

850
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,919
Spinach you've got to have your

851
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:15,599
different lettuces your wild lettuces

852
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:17,940

854
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:23,339
of it your mosh like all the different

855
00:34:20,579 --> 00:34:25,339
grits arugula is critical that's where

856
00:34:23,339 --> 00:34:28,740
you get those alkaline

857
00:34:25,339 --> 00:34:30,060
alkaline trace minerals to buffer the

858
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:32,099
acidity

859
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:34,379
teeth all fall apart

860
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:35,879
because we're so acidic in Mineral

861
00:34:34,379 --> 00:34:37,800
deficient

862
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:39,839
that our immune system can't even

863
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:42,240
protect our mouth

864
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:45,000
to stop gum disease

865
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:47,940
and to stop bacteria from eating away

866
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,679
our teeth right there's people they go

867
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:52,079
to the dentist they get their teeth

868
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:53,700
cleaned they got their teeth all taken

869
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:55,320
care of constantly they're seeing their

870
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:57,359
dentist once a month well every two

871
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:59,820
months they're brushing they're flossing

872
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:01,440
and their teeth are just totally shot

873
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:04,980
right

874
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:07,079
because it's healing deep inside we're

875
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:08,820
talking about Yvette Hopkins says love

876
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:10,920
your humor honor thank you for being

877
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:12,060
here by the way I'm honored you're here

878
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:16,200
truly

879
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:18,420
I am indeed honored I'm energy here

880
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,920
this is a glass of wine it's a thousand

881
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:23,160
dollars a glass

882
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:25,980
I think that's quite the right price

883
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:29,820
I'm I'm in Napa Valley

884
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:32,700
this wine is 52 000 a glass

885
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:35,040
and go by the vineyard

886
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:36,359
honored you guys are here

887
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,820
all right

888
00:35:36,359 --> 00:35:41,460
when we do lives later in the day I

889
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:43,380
think the humor comes out more if we

890
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:45,180
were doing alive and it was like one

891
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:47,700
o'clock in the morning I think it would

892
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:49,500
be probably the craziest live you've

893
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:51,900
ever seen so

894
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:54,000
thank God we don't do lives at 1am

895
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:56,339
because I think you got I think I would

896
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,619
all probably lose all you guys like what

897
00:35:56,339 --> 00:36:01,020
is he saying now

898
00:35:58,619 --> 00:36:03,119
Denise is so lemon water is key to our

899
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:04,140
oral health yes it is Denise it's really

900
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,420
important

901
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:10,079
lemon water

902
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:12,540
it's about calcium so just look

903
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:16,260
the calcium in lemons a whole nother

904
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:17,640
ball game okay calcium and lemon whole

905
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:19,140
nother ball game I'm going to tell you

906
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:21,119
right now

907
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:24,720
that's the calcium that goes into the

908
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:26,700
teeth it's this right here okay very

909
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,980
important calcium and leafy greens too

910
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:31,380
but especially like the lemons

911
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:33,660
so we're getting that calcium and we're

912
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:37,079
neutralizing acid

913
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:40,800
so a lemon which seems sour and acidic

914
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:42,599
right you think it's hurting your teeth

915
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,060
but what it's doing it's making your

916
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:49,260
body alkaline so you can save your teeth

917
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:51,780

rid of 50 symptoms too

921
00:36:56,099 --> 00:37:02,040
I think like 50 symptoms or 54 symptoms

922
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:04,380
too listen to the lemon water podcast

923
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:07,440
when you guys get a chance

924
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:09,180
you know definitely

925
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,160
shell says my daughter won't drink it if

926
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:12,660
there's lemon in it it's one drop at a

927
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:15,839
time put a tiny drop

928
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:19,320
Carolina a doctor told my sister to

929
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:21,900
drink red wine because she is anemic

930
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:25,079
dear Lord

931
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:26,579
terrible I mean listen to the doctor of

932
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:28,440
course doc doctor's always right listen

933
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:30,660
to your doctors I I want you guys to

934
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:32,520
listen to your doctors but man I would

935
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:35,160
never offer that to like a doctor friend

936
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:37,320
or a family member

937
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:39,000
um that's you know it's that's that's

938
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:41,820
the whole point that's why my advice is

939
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,400
in the skits it's in the wine skits I

940
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:46,560
think you'll have some red wine I think

941
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,839
he's gonna help my anemia

942
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,940
I'm gonna have a bottle of red wine

943
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:54,960
tonight I think it's gonna help my

944
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:54,960
anemia quite right yeah

945
00:37:56,359 --> 00:38:00,240
Liza

946
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:02,160
Alicia sorry what's the difference in

947
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:05,640
eating alkaline foods versus drinking

948
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:08,520
alkaline water let's go into that now

949
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:12,480
if it's spring water

950
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:15,839
that's naturally alkaline amazing

951
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:17,220
if it's the alkaline ionizer water

952
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:19,619
machines

953
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:23,880
run for your life

954
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:27,000
run for your life okay

955
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:30,780
alkaline ionizer water machines

956
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:33,540
I can't say enough things about why not

957
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:35,520
to do that right I've talked about it

958
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:38,579
I've been hammered by the alkaline

959
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:41,700
ionizer water uh Ponzi scheme pyramid

960
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:43,500
schemers out there I've seen it I've but

961
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:45,839
I've seen what it's done to people over

962
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:48,359
the years the plates rust and nobody

963
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:51,060
sees it you get particles of metal it's

964
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:52,880
a scary as crap so yeah anyway that's

965
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:56,280
different than natural occurring

966
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:58,800
alkaline water much different than that

967
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:01,079
it's a whole other story

968
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,359
yep our roses alkaline water is terrible

969
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:05,640
full of heavy metals yes indeed meaning

970
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:08,000
like the machines the ones that produce

971
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:11,160
it like like alter the water

972
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:14,220
Frankenstein the water that's terrifying

973
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:17,119
actually just so you know terrifying so

974
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:17,119
that's important to know

975
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:23,400
helps with Liz what you're live again

976
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:25,619

the episode the free episode on the

986
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:45,119
podcast

987
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,980
did I try hard enough to get them there

988
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:48,720
so they can protect themselves and then

989
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:51,960
I feel like you know did I try hard

there ain't gonna be any copies to go

1023
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:14,940
around once the book's released soon so

1024
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:16,619
pretty soon it's going to be released if

1025
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:18,960
you don't have your pre-ordered brain

1026
00:41:16,619 --> 00:41:19,920
saver books both the protocol and brain

1027
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,380
saver

1028
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:26,400
he may not get it for a long time okay

1029
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:29,160
anyway and the and amazon.com right now

1030
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:31,440
that's where they are brain saver and

1031
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:33,599
brand saver protocols two books at the

1032
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,280
same time I was told I was the only

1033
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:38,040
author that did two books at the same

1034
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:40,380
time in this on this on this scale they

1035
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:42,720
said you just always break the rules

1036
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:45,540
Sue Goldberg says why do children's

1037
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:49,640
teeth sometimes come in and I just enter

1038
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:53,000
discolored slightly hello because of

1039
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:55,380
deficiencies deficiencies from the past

1040
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:59,280
toxins that are passed down from Mom and

1041
00:41:55,380 --> 00:42:04,020
Dad yes both the husband too or father

1042
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:06,420
and both the the mom both parents so the

1043
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:09,060
toxins are passed down things like DDT

1044
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:10,619
and different pesticides toxic heavy

1045
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:13,740
metals and usually with kids it's it's

1046
00:42:10,619 --> 00:42:16,200
toxic heavy metals that are passed down

1047
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:18,420
if you guys don't have the brain saver

1048
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:20,640
books both of them there's two of them

1049
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:22,619
pre-ordered you might want to take a

1050
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:25,140
look at amazon.com look for brain saver

1051
00:42:22,619 --> 00:42:27,900
look for both books there's two separate

1052
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:30,300
pages on Amazon

1053
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:33,180
Sean Paul says isn't isn't that just

1054
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:36,480
genetics passing down toxins

1055
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:38,339
uh no it's not genetics aren't passing

1056
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,980
down toxins

1057
00:42:38,339 --> 00:42:45,060
um but we pass down toxins physically so

1058
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:47,220
yeah in utero sperm and egg toxins

1059
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:49,440
that's how it's done

1060
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:51,359
yep

1061
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:53,220
so pretty cool you guys I'm glad you

1062
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:55,200
mentioned the books I know I haven't

1063
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:57,060
been talking about the brain saver books

1064
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,920
but I want to it's just that I wanted to

1065
00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:02,099
get the podcast up and running the

1066
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:04,500
season right look they want to blame

1067
00:43:02,099 --> 00:43:06,660
everything on genetics that's how they

1068
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:10,800
do it because it's an easy sell right

1069
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:14,400
such an easy sell if you look like

1070
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:17,339
your parents or look like your relatives

1071
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:20,220
then it's like an easy sell it's got to

1072
00:43:17,339 --> 00:43:22,079
be genes everything's genes right but we

1073
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:25,440
passed down generation after generation

1074
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:27,420
viruses Epstein-Barr toxic heavy metals

1075
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:29,640
different viruses different pathogens

1076
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:32,520
right

1077
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:34,740
so and we're and all this is passed down

1078
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:36,900
from generation to generation sometimes

1079
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:39,359
a family can be exposed to all the same

1080
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:41,220
stuff so they all get sick with similar

1081
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:43,380
things as time goes on because they were

1082
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:44,700
exposed to all these different things

1083
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:47,880
right

1084
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:50,760
so that's important to know

1085
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:52,619
so yeah anyway you guys you guys know I

1086
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:55,140
care about you greatly I'm gonna have my

1087
00:43:52,619 --> 00:43:57,480
bowl of sugar if you don't mind because

1088
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:59,160
what I do is you guys I'll tell you how

1089
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:01,740
the medical media meets okay he doesn't

1090
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:04,560
eat all this all right medical medium

1091
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:06,780
eats a whole giant bowl of brown sugar

1092
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:09,540
six times a day

1093
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:11,280
I don't I'm only kidding I don't and

1094
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:13,200
neither does anybody else

1095
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,700
but what people do

1096
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:18,000
is they

1097
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:21,000
all the fats and the additives and the

1098
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:24,180

00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:38,940
dentist would be like it was because

1107
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:40,680
you're vegan it wasn't because you're

1108
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:42,900
vegan it's because everybody's focused

1109
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:44,160

1110
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:46,260

celery juice I held it in my mouth for a

1132
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:31,020

1163
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,460
got to get ready for the ride because

1164
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:46,920
that's going to be an insane One Cloud

1165
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:49,260
swoop says my son gets canker sores from

1166
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:51,240
oranges any ideas

1167
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:54,420
when I've noticed what happens is that

1168
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:55,560
okay if you have the canker sore virus

1169
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:58,140
right

1170
00:46:55,560 --> 00:47:00,839
it doesn't like to be killed off

1171
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:03,720
so it doesn't like to be killed off and

1172
00:47:00,839 --> 00:47:05,640
fruit will start killing off canker sore

1173
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:07,500
virus canker sore viruses is in the

1174
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:09,839
herpetic family right that means it's

1175
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:11,040
already in your mouth okay so what I

1176
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:13,680
would do

1177
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:15,240
is um you can ask your doctor but would

1178
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,859
I would I tell friends all the time

1179
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:19,920
right

1180
00:47:16,859 --> 00:47:22,500
is um is a couple of things celery juice

1181
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:25,619
is critical because it kills off as well

1182
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:27,660
all right another thing it's like what I

1183
00:47:25,619 --> 00:47:29,040
would tell a friend is they're gluten in

1184
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:30,900
the diet

1185
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:33,780
because if there's gluten in the diet

1186
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:35,880
then the canker sores could happen no

1187
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:37,020
matter what and then if you are eating

1188
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:38,880
an orange

1189
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:40,020
you think it's the orange if you are

1190
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,300
eating a banana and you think it's a

1191
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:44,160
banana if you are eating

1192
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:45,599
avocado you think it's an avocado but

1193
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,460
the point is is there gluten in the diet

1194
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:49,260
ever is there dairy in the diet ever

1195
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:51,540
this is what I ask friends

1196
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:55,079
when their kids have canker sores is

1197
00:47:51,540 --> 00:48:00,359
their gluten dairy corn corn gluten

1198
00:47:55,079 --> 00:48:01,920
dairy soy milk cheese butter eggs if any

1199
00:48:00,359 --> 00:48:03,540
of that's in the diet it feeds the

1200
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,940
canker sore virus the repetitive canker

1201
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:07,500
sore virus so it's a crap shoot whatever

1202
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:08,819
you're eating it's just gonna break out

1203
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:10,619
when it's going to break out that's what

1204
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:12,720
I tell a lot of doctor friends and also

1205
00:48:10,619 --> 00:48:16,079

00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:18,180
