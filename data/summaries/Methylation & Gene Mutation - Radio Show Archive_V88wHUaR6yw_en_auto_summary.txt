==================================================

In this episode of the Medical Medium radio show, Anthony William discusses the MTHFR gene mutation and its implications for health, emphasizing that many misconceptions surround genetic mutations. He argues that the test results indicating a gene mutation often reflect underlying inflammation and liver issues rather than true genetic defects. The episode encourages listeners to focus on healing and improving their health through proper diet and addressing viral loads rather than attributing their conditions to faulty genes.
