Anthony William, known as the Medical Medium, has gained widespread popularity for advocating the healing benefits of celery juice, which he claims can help with illnesses and skin conditions such as psoriasis and eczema. Celebrities like Jenna Dewan, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Kim Kardashian have endorsed celery juice, attributing improvements in skin health and energy levels to its consumption. William emphasizes that celery juice must be consumed on its own, without additives like lemon or water, to maintain its pathogen-killing properties, a concept detailed in his books, including 'Liver Rescue'.
