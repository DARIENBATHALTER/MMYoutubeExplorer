Video: Nut Butters Can Be Bad For You_BscJuse3MTE_en_auto
==================================================

The video discusses the prevalence of added oils in commercial nut butters and how they can negatively impact health. The creator emphasizes that these oils do not come from the nuts or seeds themselves but are often low-quality, rancid oils that can harm the body. To avoid these issues, the video encourages viewers to make their own nut butters, which do not contain added oils and are healthier alternatives.
