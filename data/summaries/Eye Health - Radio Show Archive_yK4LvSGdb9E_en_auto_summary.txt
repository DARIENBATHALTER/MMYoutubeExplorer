In this episode of the Medical Medium Radio Show, Anthony William discusses the underlying causes of various eye health issues, emphasizing the importance of antioxidants and minerals from fruits and vegetables in preventing and healing these conditions. He explains that many eye problems, such as blurry vision, glaucoma, and cataracts, are related to deficiencies, viral infections, or heavy metal toxicity rather than autoimmune or genetic factors. William also highlights the role of his new book, 'Life-Changing Foods,' in providing advanced healing information to combat these health issues decades ahead of conventional medical science.
