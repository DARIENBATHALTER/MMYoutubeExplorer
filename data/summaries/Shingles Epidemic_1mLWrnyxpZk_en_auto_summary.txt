==================================================

The podcast episodes of the Medical Medium, which were unexpectedly removed, have been reinstated, and listeners are directed to the creator's Telegram for details on the situation. The video discusses various types of shingles viruses, including those without visible rashes, and highlights that medical research has begun acknowledging information previously published in the Medical Medium book. Emphasizing that misinformation regarding shingles and chickenpox has persisted in the medical community, the video promotes the Medical Medium's new book edition as a source of alternative insights and protocols for dealing with shingles.
