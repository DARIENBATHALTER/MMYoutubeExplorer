Video: ADHD Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder_l3yyoMbXh9U_en_auto
==================================================

The video discusses the non-genetic and non-gut related causes of ADHD, attributing it primarily to the accumulation of toxic heavy metals, such as mercury and aluminum, in the brain's midline canal. These metals interfere with internal brain communication and electricity flow, resulting in varied ADHD symptoms. The video also highlights how these metals are passed down through generations, affecting both children and adults, and introduces the 'Brain Saver' books which provide protocols and therapies for addressing these issues.
