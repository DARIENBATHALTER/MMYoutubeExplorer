1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,319
you said that you're hoping that the

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,920
work you do will help bridge the gap

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,720
between the sick

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,639
and the not so sick yeah because

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,639
yeah what happens is you have the not so

6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,240
sick the not so sick of people that are

7
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:15,920
still living their lives

8
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,520
they're living their lives nothing

9
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,359
stopping them from living their lives

10
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,760
they might have a little bit of acne

11
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,240
they might have a little bit of bloating

12
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,119
maybe a little fatigue periodically okay

13
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,680
maybe

14
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,920
a little bit of that maybe um

15
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,519
maybe some brain fog that's come that's

16
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,719
intermittent right

17
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,200
and then

18
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,360
you got someone who

19
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,040
they could barely get into a shower when

20
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,079
water hits them and almost knocks them

21
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,760
over

22
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,680
they need help with somebody making

23
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,520
their food they can't take a walk

24
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,600
outside for more than 10 minutes or five

25
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,280
minutes they can't sit in the sun it'll

26
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,879
knock them out they'll be sick for three

27
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,879
days

28
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,879
you've been there right been there yeah

29
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,640
i know and and so there's there's the

30
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,559
not so sick and this

31
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,719
and the sick right so sick and what

32
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,039
happens is there's a confusion between

33
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,600
them both because the not so sick

34
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:08,000
haven't been inconvenienced enough

35
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,880
to know what the really sick are going

36
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,400
through

37
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,479
and so what i'm trying to do is i'm

38
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,439
trying to bridge this great divide can

39
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,280
you explain a little bit of what you do

40
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,960
as the medical medium

41
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,640
sure i started out when i was young

42
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,880
right at age four

43
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,479
and i heard a voice

44
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,360
and that voice gave me information

45
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,400
about

46
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,880
others

47
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:34,079
meaning what they were feeling a house

48
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,960
if they were sick if something was wrong

49
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,920
and then

50
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,960
beyond that gave me information

51
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,560
on

52
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,759
advanced

53
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,799
advanced stuff about you know viruses

54
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,799
and

55
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:51,200
bacteria and toxic heavy metals and the

56
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,040
nervous system and vagus nerves the

57
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,560
voice was teaching me

58
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,640
teaching me

59
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,479
how to pronounce things how to say

60
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,600
things how to identify them in people

61
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,600
how to

62
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,840
understand the information

63
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:10,800
and it led to a life of where i am now

64
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,360
where i put the information in the books

65
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,920
so people with chronic illness

66
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,560
can have a chance to heal when we talked

67
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,760
um about this stuff specifically last

68
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,360
year when i was going through my

69
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,720
troubles and i asked you to just kind of

70
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,959
help me out again

71
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,400
you checked in what did you tell

72
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,239
everybody what you what you noticed

73
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,160
because i i remember you told me celery

74
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:34,239
juice and to um do the heavy metal detox

75
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,000
and then you also said to eat a lot of

76
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,680
potatoes yeah i was trying to put you on

77
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,959
an antiviral

78
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:46,080
you know diet keeping foods out that

79
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:48,959
feed bugs that feed viruses because

80
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,040
fibromyalgia is epstein-barr that's what

81
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,640
creates fibromyalgia so what happens is

82
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,120
you can go to a fibro doctor they'll be

83
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,720
like you got fibro you can go to a then

84
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,239
walk into a lyme doctor's doctor's

85
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,400
office and they'll just be a lyme doctor

86
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,040
and they'll be like you got lyme disease

87
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,680
i can go into you know a lupus doctor

88
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,840
like you got lupus yes it's exhausting

89
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,360
but those three are epstein-barr let's

90
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,840
get a little bit into the celery juice

91
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,480
exactly like what are the

92
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,159
exact the benefits besides what i feel

93
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,159
which i want to say is i feel

94
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,640
clear-headed every time i drink celery

95
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,879
juice you know the cool thing about it

96
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,760
it's a neutralizer it's neutralizing

97
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,680
acids then it's neutralizing toxins then

98
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,760
it's diffusing and neutralizing metals

99
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,319
it doesn't pull metals out but it it

100
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,959
diffuses it neutralizes their damaging

101
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,480
effects and then it neutralizes other

102
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,799
things too like chemicals like the

103
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,879
fragrances and the air fresheners that

104
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,720
get in us and all that other junk that's

105
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,159
getting the chemicals that are there

106
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,680
that are we're breathing in every day

107
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,120
it's helping to neutralize all that

108
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,519
right the other thing it's doing it's

109
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,000
restoring the hcl and the stomach glands

110
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:55,040
which helps you have strong hcl and the

111
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,799
strong hcl kills pathogens

112
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,280
and that's like your that's like your

113
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,720
bug killer what um is your favorite

114
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,920

bloodletting and vampirism

119
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:16,160

now where people are staying sick

123
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,080
because you're getting too much blood

124
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,280
drawn

125
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,320

who is suffering brain fog and on

132
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,320
mattress island and is exhausted from

133
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,479
