we're live

195
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,560
so here's a tip right here about

196
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,880
mushrooms that you guys need to know i'd

197
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,720
love to give you this tip okay

198
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,639
so a couple of things about mushrooms

199
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,680
that are really important okay the

200
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,199
bottom of the stem if you see any green

201
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,199
at the bottom of the stem

202
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,840
you don't want that whole that whole box

203
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,360
of mushrooms needs to be tossed out

204
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,000
that's one thing right there here's a

205
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,800
tip that's really good if the mushroom's

206
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,880
pitted a little bit if it's pitted at

207
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,639
all like you're starting to pit

208
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,919
in different spots you see where it's

209
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,160
pit pitting a little bit and you're

210
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,639
getting too much color change

211
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,880
it's oxidizing you don't want to use

212
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,599
that mushroom pick another mushroom that

213
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:56,319
mushroom's oxidizing that means

214
00:06:53,599 --> 00:07:00,639
that means the cells in the mushroom are

215
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:02,479
dying rapidly and creating a toxin so

216
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,000
with toxins being created so i'm just

217
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,080
giving you a little bit more on that the

218
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,759
pitted the whole pitted thing that's

219
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,840
that's that's a tip all on its own right

220
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,120
there that's really important two

221
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,720
another thing you want to know how fresh

222
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,880
your mushroom is you just look at the

223
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,599
bottom of the stem and you see how beat

224
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,919
up or shot at the very bottom the stem

225
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,360
is right that's another tip too and some

226
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,479
of these tips you know i have shown

227
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,720
people throughout the year some of them

228
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,000
i haven't shown it's important to know

229
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,720
right

230
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,240
so another tip too is people are just

231
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,840
worried about if the mushroom's wet and

232
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,360
slimy right what if the mushroom's wet

233
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,680
so that's something people know about

234
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,560
that don't have a slimy mushroom don't

235
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,720
work with the slimy mushroom okay but

236
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:44,400
keep in mind though that's not the big

237
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:47,280
issue you can wash that slime off the

238
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,039
big issue is if it's pitting

239
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,520
that is the key

240
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,840
it's not the mushroom being slimy on top

241
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,919
that you can wash off with hot water

242
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,800
another tip too wash your mushrooms off

243
00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:00,800
with hot water that's another tip wash

244
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,479
them off with hot water

245
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,080
that's a key that's that's an important

246
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,199
key right there because here's here's

247
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,680
why

248
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,840
because if there's any bacteria on the

249
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,919
mushroom at all

250
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,840
cold water is not going to cover it it's

251
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:15,199
not going to take care of it

252
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,479
because people chop them up they throw

253
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,240
them in their salads they throw their

254
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,560
portabellas in their salads right you

255
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,800
guys and if you just wash your mushrooms

256
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,319
off with cool water

257
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,560
that's not going to be enough you could

258
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,800
easily get some bacteria that was in the

259
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,120
manure like some e coli

260
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,360
or anything that's on the mushroom so

261
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,039
you want to wash with hot water coming

262
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,640
out of the sink so you've got the hot

263
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,640
water coming down in the sink and you're

264
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,560
washing your mushrooms you wash them in

265
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,719

the pit it on the mushroom

294
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,200
means the mushroom's getting toxic

because the mushroom's oxidizing and

296
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:49,519
when mushroom oxidizes it's more toxic

hey wait a minute why don't you tell

327
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,320
them about that tip i know and then i

328
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,839
realized of course they don't know it

329
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,200
the best chefs in the world don't know

330
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,279
the tip that's why they don't tell

331
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,800
anybody so it's important to know this

332
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:53,519
stuff right so i just gave you a couple

333
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,839
mushroom tips one is wash them in hot

334
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,680
water that's how you can get the food

335
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,640
poisoning if you don't wash them in hot

336
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,160
water with mushrooms manure gets trapped

337
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,399
in there and it doesn't come out so the

338
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,560
hot water can really shock and kill e

339
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,680
coli or anything like that that's

340
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,760
important

341
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,240
the other thing is the pitted the pits

342
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,480
in the mushrooms means it's oxidizing

343
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,560
and mushrooms are more toxic when they

344
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,079
oxidize than other foods so that's just

345
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,560
the mushroom tips off the running right

346
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:22,720
there okay so we cover that boom you

347
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,480

they're really good i eat two of them in

355
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,000
between or during the whole thing so i

356
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,920
want to give you some zucchini tips now

357
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,519
some of the medical medium

358
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,399
community

359
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:46,720
people right some of you guys know i've

360
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,200
always said this all the time

361
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:52,160
why do i have missing pieces in my

362
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,360
zucchini why's your missing pieces

363
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,279
okay

364
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,600
there's missing pieces

365
00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:00,560
because i cut them out

366
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,800
the reason why i cut them out

367
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,399
is because it happens to almost

368
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,760
everybody out there

369
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,839
very few people escape this

370
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,399
there's

371
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:12,399
bacteria

372
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:15,440
in the spots people's nails have

373
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:17,440
scratched the skin on zucchini is really

374
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,959
thin when you're in the grocery store

375
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,959
everybody touches zucchini and their

376
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,399
nails go in there and that's it boom

377
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,079
their nails go in there and they usually

378
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,040
even take their nails take divots away

379
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,639
like that

380
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,160
you'll see it in the store all the

381
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,120
zucchinis have these things going in

382
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:33,839
them and the basically that's incubated

383
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,279
bacteria and viruses from people's hands

384
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,200
in the grocery store they're touching

385
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,600
the shopping carts their hands are

386
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,800
loaded with bad bacteria and viruses and

387
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,560
what do they do

388
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,480
they go and they grab the zucchinis and

389
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,920
their nails just go into the zucchinis

390
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,320
and they're pawing through them and all

391
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:51,120
the zucchinis get all eaten up like that

392
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,600
so what you do is you find those spots

393
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,360
and you cut them out

394
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,399
especially if you're going to eat those

395
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,120
raw

396
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,519
if you wash them really good to eat them

397
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,880
raw it's not going to help

398
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,160
you want to wash them good but it's not

399
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,959
going to help

400
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,519
because the fingernail went in through

401
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:11,519
the skin and put it underneath so you

402
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,760
can wash them all you want it's not

403
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,680
going to help you got to cut those spots

404
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,800

i haven't had even time to actually

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,920
share with anybody because i'm so busy

428
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,360
fighting all you know the disease the

429
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,320
illness and the chronic illness out

430
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,399
there

431
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,399
and and writing the books for all that

432
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,920
right so let's talk about the zucchini a

433
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,360
little bit more

434
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,240
so i have a zucchini in my hand right

435
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,680
here

436
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,480
okay

437
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,040
now

438
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,360
what you'll notice is the flower

439
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:24,079
you have the stem part where the

440
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,279
zucchini actually breaks off the plant

441
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,199
okay you guys

442
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:29,600
it breaks off the plant now i cut that

443
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,839
stem part off because it's hard

444
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,680
it was getting hard and i cut it off now

445
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,920
if you have a zucchini that's young

446
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,519
enough tender enough you can cook that

447
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,040
stem to be nice and juicy and good but

448
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,360
here's the thing

449
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,399
it's the butt you want to cut off the

450
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,079
butt

451
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,399
because that little piece right there

452
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:48,560
gets really hard

453
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,839
and people with teeth problems even if

454
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,600
they have strong teeth or think they

455
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,360
have strong teeth people with teeth

456
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,360
problems over

457
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,680
actually bite into that

458
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,880
and now they lose a filling they lose a

459
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,199
cap

460
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,279
they mess up a tooth they crack a tooth

461
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,040
it's kind of like the olive pit syndrome

462
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,639
i talk about you you know you you're

463
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,399
biting in olive and boom there was a pit

464
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,639
in there and now you're just totally

465
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:13,279
you're totally bad off right

466
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:15,199
so you want to cut that hard butt off

467
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:17,360
because that's where the flower was and

468
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,800
it hardens sometimes it hardens like a

469
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,000
stone

470
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:24,800
and people always mess up their teeth

471
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,760
because of that little tiny button on

472
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,120
the back of the zucchini right there so

473
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,959
that's a cool tip right there that could

474
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,160
actually save you a big hassle boom it

475
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,160
came off

476
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,160
that's it right there

477
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:39,279
okay took that off

478
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,040
so that's a zucchini tip that um but i

479
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,240

with that so it's important so let's

541
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:49,280
talk about the onion a little bit

542
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,880
so you got the onion right here okay

543
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,559
so

544
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,400
sweetest part of the onion

545
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,480
which nobody knows

546
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,360
is closer to the top of the onion where

547
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:02,160
the onion was growing meaning where the

548
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,720
onion was sprouting out that's the

549
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,640
sweetest spot so when you pull the onion

550
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:10,080
out of the ground right when you pull it

551
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:12,160
out by the green tops okay

552
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,480
right and they cut the green tops off

553
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,200
and then this seals right here that's

554
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,679
the sweet part of the onion it's closer

555
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:22,480
here so the worst part of the onion the

556
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:25,280
most bitter part of the onion

557
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:28,480
is the bottom where the roots were

558
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:30,000
the bottom where the roots were

559
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:34,000
that's the

560
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:36,480
the more astringent not so sweet not so

561
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,400
tasty part of the onion is

562
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,320
keep that in mind you can use the whole

563
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,039
onion without a doubt you can use the

564
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:45,760
whole onion right so here i am

565
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:47,679
i'm cutting this part off

566
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,440
you can use the whole onion nothing

567
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,919
wrong with that and here's the top of

568
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,600
the onion right here

569
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,480
that i'm cutting off

570
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,919
okay

571
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,039
so here's the next thing you know i mean

572
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,120
first of all i was talking about right

573
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,799
there now the best part of the onion to

574
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,559
work off of

575
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:05,200
the best heat because you you might be

576
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:07,679
making food for family friends you might

577
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,520
making food for people right

578
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:13,039
and the best part of the onion to work

579
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:15,280
off of in the meals is off the top side

580
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:17,200
going all the way down in right that's

581
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,200
the tastiest part because someone may be

582
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,080
like yeah okay you made me a salad but

583
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,720
it wasn't that tasty or it was okay or

584
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,080
i'm sensitive with onions i like onions

585
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,679
but i'm a little sensitive with onions

586
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,360
sometimes and what's really happening

587
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,360
too is you're they're getting the worst

588
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,720
part of the onion in their food so

589
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,840
that's important to know right there i'm

590
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,200
peeling back the onion a little bit

591
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,160
so the best part of the onion is that

592
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:42,720
top part another little tip too

593
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,000
anytime you see anything brown in the

594
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,160
onion

595
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,679
toss the whole onion

596
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,240
don't risk it

597
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,520
because the onions going bad

598
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,960
going bad

599
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,640
rotten onion

600
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,080
is the worst it can destroy a whole meal

601
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,000
and i talked about that tip all on its

602
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,520
own but you don't know it's wrong it

603
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,080
looks good it might but it has a little

604
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,559
brown spot or it has one ring

605
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,400
one ring is getting brown in there after

606
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,000
you cut it one ring

607
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,080
the other rings look good

608
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,159
but one ring's getting bad toss the

609
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,320
onion don't even save it can ruin an

610
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,159
entire meal or an entire meal for a

611
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,600
