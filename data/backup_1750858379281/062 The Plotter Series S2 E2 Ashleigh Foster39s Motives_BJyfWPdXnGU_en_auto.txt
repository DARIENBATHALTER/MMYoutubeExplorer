[46.64 - 52.56] false stories and claims about me and
[50.52 - 55.56] about medical medium information to
[52.56 - 58.52] Major media outlets in hopes that it
[55.56 - 61.32] would lead to securing themselves a deal
[58.52 - 64.48] for an anti-ed medium documentary on
[61.32 - 68.44] Netflix that would bring Fame and other
[64.48 - 70.60] benefits to them now known infamously

[112.84 - 118.32] health industry as you'll see it's also
[115.92 - 120.32] one of the biggest instances of

[202.88 - 208.87] set the record straight as many times as
[205.64 - 213.47] we need to
[208.87 - 213.47] [Music]
[217.16 - 222.24] people who lie are liars if you're
[219.84 - 225.44] willing to lie about one thing you might
[222.24 - 227.92] be willing to lie about everything One
[225.44 - 232.20] Lie calls into question the entirety of
[227.92 - 234.20] someone's character what about two three
[232.20 - 237.84] four 100
[234.20 - 240.56] lies these are words from Ashley Foster
[237.84 - 242.12] words that she is soon going to eat
[240.56 - 244.68] because as I've said from the very
[242.12 - 247.40] beginning what Ashley projects and tries
[244.68 - 250.60] to accuse other people of being and
[247.40 - 253.04] doing is usually what she herself is
[250.60 - 255.56] guilty of being and
[253.04 - 258.56] doing Ashley is the ring leader of an
[255.56 - 261.44] organized anti-ed medium hateful group
[258.56 - 263.40] that she created on a mountain of Lies
[261.44 - 265.52] Ashley has been lying and attacking
[263.40 - 267.48] Anthony for years and she has now
[265.52 - 270.16] incited a group of people that are out
[267.48 - 272.24] there attacking harassing and bullying
[270.16 - 274.16] the medical medium community and even
[272.24 - 277.32] going as far as to make videos of
[274.16 - 279.80] themselves burning medical medium books
[277.32 - 281.40] okay all these medical medium books are
[279.80 - 284.64] going to be burned
[281.40 - 284.64] today it's
[285.16 - 288.76] happening this is going in first celery
[287.72 - 291.20] juice
[288.76 - 293.80] one I took out the insides cuz it's
[291.20 - 296.52] going to take forever to burn why is
[293.80 - 298.52] Ashley really doing this many have asked
[296.52 - 301.64] in response to the activities of the
[298.52 - 303.76] plotters one online commenter said it's
[301.64 - 306.76] clear there are other motives behind all
[303.76 - 309.56] this a different commenter said it's
[306.76 - 311.28] just full-on Reckless ruthless attacks
[309.56 - 313.60] that seems like it doesn't have anything
[311.28 - 316.00] to do with the realities nor facts of
[313.60 - 319.84] our community just attacks simply to
[316.00 - 322.64] bring us down utterly nonsensical and
[319.84 - 325.40] infuriating and another commenter said
[322.64 - 327.24] it's so clear that bears an agenda I
[325.40 - 328.64] don't see why anyone would listen to all
[327.24 - 333.12] their
[328.64 - 335.88] n so what are Ashley's ulterior motives
[333.12 - 338.96] what is this really about for her what
[335.88 - 340.96] type of person is capable of harboring
[338.96 - 343.24] so much hatred towards someone who does
[340.96 - 345.16] nothing but help the chronically ill
[343.24 - 347.56] even long after the madeup story they
[345.16 - 348.64] tried to use to slander him was proven
[347.56 - 351.64] to be
[348.64 - 355.24] false what type of person could be so
[351.64 - 357.64] painfully entitled and careless so as to
[355.24 - 359.64] spend years plotting and obsessively
[357.64 - 361.32] trying to bring Anthony and the entire
[359.64 - 364.24] medical medium community of chronically
[361.32 - 366.80] ill people who are already struggling
[364.24 - 369.20] down today we're going to be answering
[366.80 - 371.24] these questions Ashley's true motives
[369.20 - 373.64] are going to be exposed for the first
[371.24 - 375.40] time we're going to be revealing some
[373.64 - 378.40] shocking new facts that are wildly
[375.40 - 380.64] inconsistent with Ashley's Proclamation
[378.40 - 385.00] that she's doing this smear campaign
[380.64 - 387.36] quote asfor step to Zone and we're going
[385.00 - 389.92] to begin exposing some of the many many
[387.36 - 392.24] more lies that Ashley has told since the
[389.92 - 394.96] release of our podcast episodes last
[392.24 - 396.72] year you may recall that in our previous
[394.96 - 399.08] episodes we played the following
[396.72 - 401.48] recording of Taylor call and Robbie
[399.08 - 404.84] Barbaro describing their friend and the
[401.48 - 407.28] number one plotter Ashley
[404.84 - 412.28] Foster and by the way Ash do need to
[407.28 - 415.28] work Ash has ever ever the woman is she
[412.28 - 419.48] family money a lot of it you know
[415.28 - 419.48] private jet and plus
[419.68 - 424.84] Ashley has since responded to this part
[421.84 - 427.00] of our podcasts somebody said to her you
[424.84 - 428.88] are independently wealthy what is the
[427.00 - 432.64] source of your family's wealth I'm
[428.88 - 436.48] suspicious because of that and Ashley
[432.64 - 439.24] replied my dad grew up without shoes or
[436.48 - 442.24] electricity his first job was knocking
[439.24 - 446.16] the cement off off all Briggs for a
[442.24 - 449.12] penny a brick he worked incredibly hard
[446.16 - 450.28] harder than anyone else I have ever met
[449.12 - 452.48] eventually
[450.28 - 454.04] he was able to buy one of the houses he
[452.48 - 458.60] built for
[454.04 - 461.52] $700 he sold it later for a few thousand
[458.60 - 465.28] he built another house by hand and sold
[461.52 - 468.92] that by the time he died at 83 he had
[465.28 - 471.68] been working in real estate for 60 years
[468.92 - 474.68] he built and sold houses and eventually
[471.68 - 477.96] apartment buildings he was able to leave
[474.68 - 480.40] an amazing Legacy for our family I'm
[477.96 - 483.76] incredibly proud of him and
[480.40 - 486.72] grateful that said we don't own a plane
[483.76 - 488.56] like they said in the podcast we aren't
[486.72 - 491.52] able to spend money without thinking
[488.56 - 494.52] about it we don't have vacation homes
[491.52 - 496.76] like Anthony does we don't have the
[494.52 - 499.76] ability to pay in definitely for
[496.76 - 502.20] aggressive lawyers like Anthony does
[499.76 - 504.88] we're just able to live a comfortable
[502.20 - 508.04] life where I can stay home with my kids
[504.88 - 511.20] and homeschool them my husband works
[508.04 - 515.80] incredibly hard there's nothing crazy
[511.20 - 518.44] here we're just blessed and I'm really
[515.80 - 521.04] grateful so Ashley is claiming
[518.44 - 524.00] specifically that quote we don't have a
[521.04 - 526.76] plane and quote we don't have vacation
[524.00 - 529.32] homes she's trying to portray herself as
[526.76 - 530.92] a victim of Anthony's lawyers saying
[529.32 - 533.08] that she can't afford ongoing legal
[530.92 - 535.80] representation of her own and she's
[533.08 - 539.72] depicting herself as having a simple
[535.80 - 541.48] humble life just to give you an idea of
[539.72 - 543.44] how absurd these statements and
[541.48 - 545.68] characterizations are I'm going to
[543.44 - 548.24] reference some of the many news articles
[545.68 - 551.48] that have been published about Ashley's
[548.24 - 554.60] family a July 2021 article in the Daily

[820.80 - 824.72] Moose's trouble at Pillar income Asset
[822.88 - 827.48] Management arrived with a document he
[824.72 - 829.92] had never seen it was a two-page

[855.44 - 859.12] and real estate compensation after he

[863.56 - 868.80] signed over his rights to vaa the
[866.16 - 870.68] doctored letter and says it was created
[868.80 - 872.92] by taking the signature from a different
[870.68 - 876.04] document and combining it with a new
[872.92 - 879.20] cover page it also says the document was
[876.04 - 881.08] altered by a typewriter after the fact
[879.20 - 884.04] to reflect that pillar was a third party
[881.08 - 886.84] to the agreement with Phillips and moose
[884.04 - 889.04] the pillar signature Line's font differs
[886.84 - 892.16] from the rest of the
[889.04 - 894.40] document as it turns out it's an awfully
[892.16 - 897.44] fragile glass mansion that Ashley is
[894.40 - 901.04] trying to throw stones from can we play
[897.44 - 901.04] that last audio again
[901.20 - 909.20] and by the way Ash do need to work Ash
[904.60 - 913.44] ever ever the woman is she family money
[909.20 - 916.80] a lot of it you know private jet and
[913.44 - 919.20] plus Ashley's closest friends said that
[916.80 - 922.08] she doesn't have to work and that she
[919.20 - 924.12] has a lot of family money like private
[922.08 - 927.60] jet
[924.12 - 930.96] plus and then Ashley denied their claims
[927.60 - 930.96] after the podcast came out
[931.80 - 937.68] that said we don't own a plane like they
[934.52 - 940.52] said in the podcast we aren't able to
[937.68 - 945.40] spend money without thinking about it we
[940.52 - 945.40] don't have vacation homes like Anthony
[946.00 - 950.72] does this part is hilarious because
[948.92 - 952.56] Ashley has always been an aspiring
[950.72 - 955.12] writer and she had written a piece about
[952.56 - 956.80] her own life years ago she sent it to
[955.12 - 959.08] multiple people who have since submitted
[956.80 - 962.88] evidence to us in this piece in
[959.08 - 966.60] reference to her family Ashley had said
[962.88 - 969.72] this my mother was gorgeous my father
[966.60 - 973.96] was brilliant and Rich they had cars and
[969.72 - 980.32] planes and houses all over the
[973.96 - 984.56] globe brilliant and rich cars and planes
[980.32 - 987.48] plural and homes all over the globe
[984.56 - 989.48] furthermore in 2018 Ashley's childhood
[987.48 - 992.64] home was listed in an article by D
[989.48 - 995.24] Magazine titled the 100 most expensive
[992.64 - 999.00] homes in Dallas her family's home ranked
[995.24 - 1001.28] number six at a value at the time of
[999.00 - 1004.08] 29,5
[1001.28 - 1006.96] 56,3
[1004.08 - 1008.92] 120 the house Ashley currently lives in
[1006.96 - 1011.80] and posts about on social media in
[1008.92 - 1013.00] Colorado is an 80 acre property worth
[1011.80 - 1015.40] $10
[1013.00 - 1019.44] million Ashley's previous home in
[1015.40 - 1021.00] California sold for $7.3 million and we
[1019.44 - 1022.80] know people who have visited multiple
[1021.00 - 1024.76] different properties of Ashley's in
[1022.80 - 1028.24] different places around the country some
[1024.76 - 1030.92] of which are worth close to 13
[1028.24 - 1032.96] million once in the process of trying to
[1030.92 - 1036.28] purchase a property Ashley had sent a
[1032.96 - 1039.92] text to a friend that says the
[1036.28 - 1042.28] following our first loan didn't close 2
[1039.92 - 1044.44] days before closing the board of the
[1042.28 - 1046.60] bank had approved the loan when our
[1044.44 - 1050.20] broker got a random call they were
[1046.60 - 1053.12] cancelling it
[1050.20 - 1055.56] the friend asked was your dad a backer
[1053.12 - 1060.04] and Ashley
[1055.56 - 1062.40] replied I was in tears and so confused
[1060.04 - 1065.60] and he was so pissed off and
[1062.40 - 1069.52] Confused my dad looks at the paperwork
[1065.60 - 1072.60] and goes oh this Bank never would have
[1069.52 - 1079.68] made you Al loone I sued them for $70
[1072.60 - 1079.68] million last year # thanks Dad
[1079.72 - 1087.20] the friends said holy [ __ ]
[1082.88 - 1090.32] LOL so Ashley's dad a late billionaire
[1087.20 - 1093.28] had sued a bank for $70
[1090.32 - 1095.40] million but Ashley wants you to believe
[1093.28 - 1098.00] that she can't afford a lawyer and that
[1095.40 - 1100.16] she is somehow a victim of Anthony's
[1098.00 - 1101.76] legal representation because she has
[1100.16 - 1104.00] simply been notified that she is
[1101.76 - 1105.80] repeatedly spreading verifiably false
[1104.00 - 1107.76] information about Anthony and about
[1105.80 - 1110.04] medical medium information and she
[1107.76 - 1112.76] continues to ignore facts that have been
[1110.04 - 1114.68] presented to her in a different text
[1112.76 - 1117.32] Ashley wrote
[1114.68 - 1121.12] this we bought an apartment building in
[1117.32 - 1124.44] Texas with the help of my
[1121.12 - 1127.24] dad Ashley and her husband bought an
[1124.44 - 1130.96] apartment building with the help of her
[1127.24 - 1134.52] dad a lot of people rent apartments not
[1130.96 - 1135.84] many people can buy apartment buildings
[1134.52 - 1138.28] as investment
[1135.84 - 1140.28] properties and we have another text from
[1138.28 - 1143.24] Ashley to a
[1140.28 - 1146.56] friend a lot of huge huge things going
[1143.24 - 1150.08] on over here a 100 plus million doll
[1146.56 - 1153.20] deals Etc it's a lot to get my mind
[1150.08 - 1155.52] around and I feel easily overwhelmed if
[1153.20 - 1156.96] I don't just focus on listening for what
[1155.52 - 1160.72] God has for
[1156.96 - 1162.84] me so she's involved with a 100 plus
[1160.72 - 1166.20] million doll
[1162.84 - 1168.32] deals 100 plus million dollar deals but
[1166.20 - 1169.32] remember everybody Ashley just lives a
[1168.32 - 1171.92] simp
[1169.32 - 1173.96] humble life she can't even afford legal
[1171.92 - 1175.96] representation and again she's the
[1173.96 - 1178.12] victim when she gets called out for the
[1175.96 - 1180.52] falsities that she originated and took
[1178.12 - 1183.76] to the media with the expressed intent
[1180.52 - 1183.76] of harming Anthony and the
[1183.80 - 1191.44] community um oh my
[1188.96 - 1196.76] um yeah we're hopeful that once the
[1191.44 - 1200.64] article's out um one of the directors or
[1196.76 - 1200.64] producers that Britain works with well
[1200.92 - 1205.12] uh you know become interested in telling
[1203.28 - 1208.96] the story really well I think it's going
[1205.12 - 1211.76] to take that because Anthony is so um he
[1208.96 - 1214.68] has such a presence and if it just stops
[1211.76 - 1216.28] at the article I'm guessing that like
[1214.68 - 1218.60] there would be some buzz in the medical
[1216.28 - 1220.24] medium Community for a few months but
[1218.60 - 1223.60] like really I think then it would kind
[1220.24 - 1226.16] of die down ultimately the
[1223.60 - 1228.32] way to really get the word out is like
[1226.16 - 1229.36] would be like a Netflix documentary you
[1228.32 - 1233.12] know
[1229.36 - 1236.08] so um once you hit that level of like
[1233.12 - 1239.16] being exposed there's kind of no there's
[1236.08 - 1239.16] no coming back from
[1239.24 - 1245.88] that there's kind of no coming back from
[1242.76 - 1248.40] that that's what Ashley wants for
[1245.88 - 1250.92] Anthony and let me be clear that nobody
[1248.40 - 1253.00] over here cares if Ashley has money or
[1250.92 - 1255.04] not that's not the problem it's the fact
[1253.00 - 1257.08] that she's being ridiculously dishonest
[1255.04 - 1259.36] about it and even publicly rebutting
[1257.08 - 1261.40] what her own close friends who know her
[1259.36 - 1263.88] situation personally said about her
[1261.40 - 1265.88] wealth at the same time as Ashley's
[1263.88 - 1269.32] trying to convince everyone that she's
[1265.88 - 1271.52] so perfectly honest and morally
[1269.32 - 1273.56] Superior the truth is that Ashley will
[1271.52 - 1275.48] throw anybody under the bus even her own
[1273.56 - 1277.04] friends who threaten The Masks she's
[1275.48 - 1279.64] wearing as she's trying to portray
[1277.04 - 1281.04] herself to be an everyday innocent Mommy
[1279.64 - 1282.28] so that people are more likely to
[1281.04 - 1285.40] believe her
[1282.28 - 1287.00] lies Ashley's misrepresenting herself
[1285.40 - 1289.36] just like she's misrepresented the
[1287.00 - 1291.60] entire Stephanie story and just like she
[1289.36 - 1294.00] continues to misrepresent Medical medium
[1291.60 - 1295.68] information with every lie and every
[1294.00 - 1299.20] falsity she's out there
[1295.68 - 1301.96] pedaling here is again Ashley's response
[1299.20 - 1305.20] to what Taylor and Robbie said about
[1301.96 - 1307.84] her that said we don't own a plane like
[1305.20 - 1312.08] they said in the
[1307.84 - 1314.08] podcast they don't own a plane hm maybe
[1312.08 - 1316.40] Ashley doesn't have a plane but her
[1314.08 - 1318.88] family does or at least they did there's
[1316.40 - 1320.96] obviously a reason why Robbie and Taylor
[1318.88 - 1323.88] said what they did and Ashley's being
[1320.96 - 1325.36] dishonest again just a minute ago you
[1323.88 - 1327.52] heard what we read from Ashley from
[1325.36 - 1331.04] another time in which she said
[1327.52 - 1335.52] explicitly that her family has homes and
[1331.04 - 1336.96] cars and planes all over the globe if
[1335.52 - 1340.48] that wasn't enough there's also an
[1336.96 - 1342.28] article on businesswire.com from 2017
[1340.48 - 1344.68] about Ashley's father that
[1342.28 - 1347.20] reads Dallas real estate entrepreneur
[1344.68 - 1350.12] and philanthropist Jean e Phillips
[1347.20 - 1352.24] offered his private plane for a
[1350.12 - 1354.40] humanitarian flight to St Thomas in the
[1352.24 - 1358.40] US Virgin Islands last
[1354.40 - 1362.36] week her father offered up his plane not
[1358.40 - 1364.40] a plane his plane there are also
[1362.36 - 1366.16] multiple currently public posts on
[1364.40 - 1367.64] Ashley's mother's Instagram account in
[1366.16 - 1371.28] which the family can be seen on a
[1367.64 - 1371.28] private jet like in this
[1373.60 - 1381.52] video messing with the
[1376.92 - 1381.52] dogs look at those dogs trying to bite
[1381.56 - 1388.24] [Music]
[1384.16 - 1388.24] me crazy dogs
[1394.84 - 1398.80] right he wants to do it
[1404.76 - 1410.12] again if you're listening to the podcast
[1407.52 - 1412.36] version of this episode what you just
[1410.12 - 1415.28] heard is the sound to a video of
[1412.36 - 1417.28] Ashley's family on a private jet that
[1415.28 - 1421.04] seems to be on its way to the location
[1417.28 - 1422.72] tagged of kukio Hawaii it appears as
[1421.04 - 1424.60] though Ashley's mother is recording the
[1422.72 - 1426.68] video while Ashley's dad is holding
[1424.60 - 1429.16] Ashley's daughter on his lap as he's
[1426.68 - 1432.12] showing her something on his phone and
[1429.16 - 1436.68] Ashley herself is in plain view talking
[1432.12 - 1439.76] to someone behind him on the private jet
[1436.68 - 1443.96] it was posted on June 25th of 2019 with
[1439.76 - 1445.32] the caption quot memories Priceless as
[1443.96 - 1448.60] if from a trip they had taken in
[1445.32 - 1451.56] previous years it gets even crazier
[1448.60 - 1455.84] there are two posts one from July 7th of
[1451.56 - 1457.76] 2018 and one from July 15th of 2018 with
[1455.84 - 1460.96] photos of Ashley's kids on a private
[1457.76 - 1463.92] plane with Ashley's dad the July 7th
[1460.96 - 1465.48] 2018 post is captioned quote we are
[1463.92 - 1468.36] headed to
[1465.48 - 1470.32] Pennsylvania this was 4 months before
[1468.36 - 1472.76] before Stephanie passed away and
[1470.32 - 1475.96] Pennsylvania is where Stephanie
[1472.76 - 1478.96] lived Ashley's family took the private
[1475.96 - 1482.24] jet that Ashley's now claiming that they
[1478.96 - 1485.20] don't have or have access to to the very
[1482.24 - 1488.08] state in which Stephanie lived just four
[1485.20 - 1492.36] months before Stephanie died and
[1488.08 - 1495.40] yet Ashley did not visit Stephanie once
[1492.36 - 1497.64] during the entire time she was sick we
[1495.40 - 1502.68] know this because in a blog post Ashley
[1497.64 - 1502.68] wrote on 7th of 2020 she said
[1503.04 - 1508.80] this Steph went back home after a few
[1505.96 - 1512.12] months and a relationship turned into
[1508.80 - 1514.12] texts and occasional phone calls she was
[1512.12 - 1517.20] the kind of friend I didn't talk to
[1514.12 - 1519.72] every day but I never worried about it
[1517.20 - 1521.88] because I knew the second I saw her
[1519.72 - 1525.64] again it would be like we hadn't missed
[1521.88 - 1528.64] a day unfortunately I wouldn't have that
[1525.64 - 1528.64] chance
[1530.20 - 1535.84] here Ashley is referring to a time when
[1533.00 - 1538.36] Stephanie stayed with her in
[1535.84 - 1541.48] 2016 Ashley is saying in this post that
[1538.36 - 1544.84] she never saw Stephanie again after that
[1541.48 - 1549.92] time Stephanie passed away on November
[1544.84 - 1553.04] 13th of 2018 over 2 years later in an
[1549.92 - 1556.04] Instagram post from March 6th of 20120
[1553.04 - 1558.44] Ashley said something similar staff went
[1556.04 - 1561.16] back home to Pennsylvania a few months
[1558.44 - 1564.76] later and a relationship turned into
[1561.16 - 1566.68] texts and occasional calls she was the
[1564.76 - 1569.48] kind of friend I didn't talk to every
[1566.68 - 1572.76] day but who I knew I would never miss a
[1569.48 - 1575.92] beat with the second I saw her again
[1572.76 - 1578.92] unfortunately I never
[1575.92 - 1581.56] would Ashley's saying she would never
[1578.92 - 1584.52] get the chance as if Stephanie had died
[1581.56 - 1586.20] right after that but Ashley had over two
[1584.52 - 1588.76] years of a
[1586.20 - 1590.96] chance for someone who claim claims to
[1588.76 - 1593.52] have cared so much about Stephanie that
[1590.96 - 1595.72] Stephanie is the reason why she is so
[1593.52 - 1598.04] determined to blatantly harm Anthony and
[1595.72 - 1600.64] the medical medium Community it seems
[1598.04 - 1603.28] just a little strange that Ashley did
[1600.64 - 1606.36] not visit Stephanie once while Stephanie
[1603.28 - 1608.52] was sick for two years Ashley clearly
[1606.36 - 1612.36] has the means her family according to
[1608.52 - 1615.16] her own words has quote cars and planes
[1612.36 - 1618.28] and houses all over the globe and Ashley
[1615.16 - 1620.32] appears to even have been on one of said
[1618.28 - 1622.40] private planes with her family to
[1620.32 - 1625.52] Pennsylvania just a few months before
[1622.40 - 1629.12] Stephanie died in Pennsylvania and yet
[1625.52 - 1632.04] Ashley still did not visit her instead
[1629.12 - 1633.96] during that time that Stephanie was sick
[1632.04 - 1636.96] Ashley was traveling to run Retreats
[1633.96 - 1639.56] with her friends here is a text that
[1636.96 - 1643.00] co-plot Taylor call had sent to a friend
[1639.56 - 1643.00] on November 6th of
[1643.52 - 1650.44] 2018 I'm good just now back from
[1646.92 - 1653.36] California the retreat was wonderful but
[1650.44 - 1656.44] loads of work Gretchen was sick and in
[1653.36 - 1659.68] the hospital the whole time so it was me
[1656.44 - 1663.44] Ash and Mel full
[1659.68 - 1666.52] on that text was sent just seven days
[1663.44 - 1669.16] before Stephanie passed away so for over
[1666.52 - 1671.60] two years despite Ashley taking multiple
[1669.16 - 1674.00] trips despite her having the time to run
[1671.60 - 1676.40] Retreats despite the family using a
[1674.00 - 1678.52] private jet to visit Pennsylvania where
[1676.40 - 1681.56] Stephanie lived all while Stephanie was
[1678.52 - 1684.52] sick Ashley didn't visit Stephanie
[1681.56 - 1686.68] once instead Ashley was using that time
[1684.52 - 1689.76] trying to become something in the health
[1686.68 - 1692.04] industry using the medical medium name
[1689.76 - 1693.92] in Ashley's blog post from 2020 where
[1692.04 - 1695.48] she began pedalling her original false
[1693.92 - 1700.00] story line about what happened with
[1695.48 - 1704.16] Stephanie she told a massive additional
[1700.00 - 1706.64] falsity I have absolutely no agenda I
[1704.16 - 1710.52] don't make money off clients or my
[1706.64 - 1712.56] Instagram I in potentially never have
[1710.52 - 1716.24] and the reason for that is because of
[1712.56 - 1717.76] how highly I value the truth I know it's
[1716.24 - 1720.72] hard to trust people in the current
[1717.76 - 1723.12] climate of social media and no one is
[1720.72 - 1727.28] perfect but I want you guys to be able
[1723.12 - 1727.28] to trust me as much as you choose
[1727.56 - 1733.16] to As Nice And as trusting as that might
[1730.68 - 1735.84] sound it's far from the truth and it's
[1733.16 - 1738.64] incredibly manipulative Ashley clearly
[1735.84 - 1740.12] had an agenda all along and Ashley has
[1738.64 - 1742.60] very much made money off of her
[1740.12 - 1744.96] Instagram or at least she's tried to and
[1742.60 - 1747.28] she had every intention to do so I'm
[1744.96 - 1749.32] going to go through some examples first
[1747.28 - 1752.00] of all Ashley once had a platform on
[1749.32 - 1753.68] Instagram of around 20,000 followers she
[1752.00 - 1756.08] had this platform mostly because the
[1753.68 - 1757.80] medical medium account was reposting her
[1756.08 - 1760.48] and that's largely how her account grew
[1757.80 - 1762.44] to what it was at the time Ashley then
[1760.48 - 1764.12] used that platform built from the
[1762.44 - 1766.20] medical medium Community to sell a
[1764.12 - 1768.36] myriad of different digital products and
[1766.20 - 1770.28] in-person events
[1768.36 - 1772.08] one type of digital product Ashley made
[1770.28 - 1774.76] money from was her ebooks that she
[1772.08 - 1777.08] marketed on her Instagram account there
[1774.76 - 1778.96] were three different ebooks and we have
[1777.08 - 1780.44] receipts that were submitted To Us by
[1778.96 - 1783.92] people who had purchased them from
[1780.44 - 1787.28] Ashley in 2018 2019 and
[1783.92 - 1790.52] 2020 two of them were $7 each for PDF
[1787.28 - 1794.12] copies and $15 each for hard copies and
[1790.52 - 1799.24] one of them was $20 for a PDF copy and
[1794.12 - 1801.20] $25 for a hard copy in 2018 through 2020
[1799.24 - 1803.52] Ashley was promoting her offerings a lot
[1801.20 - 1805.56] on social media Ashley shared
[1803.52 - 1807.60] screenshots directly on her Instagram
[1805.56 - 1809.44] stories that customers had taken of
[1807.60 - 1812.16] their receipts from purchasing Ashley's
[1809.44 - 1814.08] ebooks at the time of course Ashley
[1812.16 - 1815.96] would share these receipts to try to
[1814.08 - 1818.60] encourage more people to buy her ebooks
[1815.96 - 1821.12] through her Instagram Ashley promoted
[1818.60 - 1823.40] her ebooks constantly on her Instagram
[1821.12 - 1825.00] page there were so many promotional
[1823.40 - 1827.64] posts but we're going to read off the
[1825.00 - 1829.96] captions for just a few of them in one
[1827.64 - 1831.76] post Ashley made during that time period
[1829.96 - 1835.24] She
[1831.76 - 1837.36] said January 1st is coming and I know a
[1835.24 - 1840.56] lot of us will use the momentum of a new

[1914.60 - 1919.12] name out there more and to get her

[1956.40 - 1961.32] there Ashley did another giveaway
[1958.88 - 1962.92] promotional post for her eBooks on May
[1961.32 - 1966.36] 23rd of
[1962.92 - 1968.80] 2019 six months after Stephanie passed
[1966.36 - 1972.12] away this one
[1968.80 - 1976.12] said I'm giving away another hard copy
[1972.12 - 1978.44] of each of my recipe books to enter tag
[1976.12 - 1982.00] your food bestie and tell me one of your
[1978.44 - 1984.76] favorite things to eat together P.S if

[1984.76 - 1990.16] person like me and you just got to have
[1987.52 - 1993.56] them they're available for purchase on
[1990.16 - 1998.12] my website now at the link in my profile
[1993.56 - 1998.12] made the odds be ever in your
[1999.20 - 2004.24] favor but what takes the cake out of all
[2001.60 - 2006.76] of this is that Ashley actually released
[2004.24 - 2010.36] her second ebook the day after Stephanie
[2006.76 - 2012.96] passed away in her November 14th 2018
[2010.36 - 2014.80] promotional post Ashley even casually
[2012.96 - 2017.16] mentioned in the caption that a friend
[2014.80 - 2018.52] of hers had died last night but that she
[2017.16 - 2020.84] felt like it was still the right thing
[2018.52 - 2024.08] to do to launch and start selling her
[2020.84 - 2025.88] next ebook anyway Ashley is the daughter
[2024.08 - 2028.16] of a billionaire it's not like she
[2025.88 - 2031.24] needed the money she had no publisher
[2028.16 - 2033.16] and no deadline this was an ebook Ashley
[2031.24 - 2035.40] self-published she had the freedom to
[2033.16 - 2037.00] release it at any time of her choosing
[2035.40 - 2038.32] and she decided that the day after
[2037.00 - 2041.08] Stephanie died
[2038.32 - 2043.04] was the right time and then in the
[2041.08 - 2045.16] caption of the promotional post Ashley
[2043.04 - 2047.80] said
[2045.16 - 2051.00] this I could use your help getting the
[2047.80 - 2052.88] word out about this little book I just
[2051.00 - 2055.04] didn't have the energy to do the
[2052.88 - 2060.00] giveaways and the hype stuff to build
[2055.04 - 2062.80] momentum for it but that's the way life
[2060.00 - 2065.00] goes Ashley offered to donate some of
[2062.80 - 2067.28] the proceeds of her book sales to relief
[2065.00 - 2069.80] efforts for the woy fires that were
[2067.28 - 2072.52] going on and affecting Ashley personally
[2069.80 - 2074.20] at the time but not all of the proceeds
[2072.52 - 2076.32] and again Ashley is the daughter of a
[2074.20 - 2078.00] billionaire she doesn't need sales from
[2076.32 - 2081.08] the medical medium Community to donate
[2078.00 - 2085.04] to a cause what a bizarre time to try to
[2081.08 - 2087.24] make money not even 24 hours after
[2085.04 - 2089.20] Stephanie died that's the kind of thing
[2087.24 - 2093.20] you do when you don't care about the
[2089.20 - 2096.44] person who died but to each their
[2093.20 - 2098.08] own so not only did Ashley lie about
[2096.44 - 2100.28] never making money or trying to make
[2098.08 - 2102.76] money off of her Instagram clearly she
[2100.28 - 2104.68] did but Ashley even tried to make money
[2102.76 - 2107.64] off of her Instagram the very next day
[2104.68 - 2109.48] after Stephanie passed away and Ashley
[2107.64 - 2112.04] was not only making money on Instagram
[2109.48 - 2114.44] with her ebooks but she was also trying
[2112.04 - 2117.56] desperately to make a name and a brand
[2114.44 - 2119.72] for herself Ashley used the name of her
[2117.56 - 2121.72] weight loss ebook and made a separate
[2119.72 - 2123.76] Instagram account for it she did
[2121.72 - 2125.88] Instagram lives promoting it she made a
[2123.76 - 2128.20] Facebook group for it she created an
[2125.88 - 2129.96] Instagram hashtag for it and she used
[2128.20 - 2131.48] the hashtag in a bunch of her posts and
[2129.96 - 2134.04] encouraged other people to use the
[2131.48 - 2136.64] hashtag too and Ashley wanted to do a
[2134.04 - 2139.60] retreat in 2020 cator around this brand
[2136.64 - 2142.08] she created one Instagram post she had
[2139.60 - 2145.20] made a few years ago said
[2142.08 - 2149.00] this I'm over here dreaming up holding
[2145.20 - 2152.16] some Retreats this year based on my meal
[2149.00 - 2154.84] plan Ashley also participated in a vegan
[2152.16 - 2156.92] bundle with one of her ebooks another
[2154.84 - 2158.28] Avenue of Ashley making money off of her
[2156.92 - 2160.04] Instagram
[2158.28 - 2161.88] we have a receipt that was submitted to
[2160.04 - 2164.96] us from someone who purchased the bundle
[2161.88 - 2168.52] with Ashley's ebook in it for $50 from
[2164.96 - 2171.16] Ashley on February 7th of 2020 which was
[2168.52 - 2173.60] just 4 days before Ashley started coming
[2171.16 - 2175.52] out against medical medium and publicly
[2173.60 - 2178.32] spreading false stories about
[2175.52 - 2180.16] Stephanie think about this Ashley was
[2178.32 - 2184.24] making money off of the medical medium
[2180.16 - 2187.08] community Through Instagram 4 days
[2184.24 - 2188.68] before coming out with her false story
[2187.08 - 2191.04] for anyone who doesn't know how bundle
[2188.68 - 2192.36] companies work I'll give you an example
[2191.04 - 2194.24] I was asked to be an affiliate for a
[2192.36 - 2196.68] bundle company multiple times over the
[2194.24 - 2198.44] past year I chose not to participate but
[2196.68 - 2200.68] I was sent all of the information about
[2198.44 - 2202.76] how the commission structure works the
[2200.68 - 2204.28] vegan bundle that Ashley participated in
[2202.76 - 2206.40] was a different type of bundle than the
[2204.28 - 2207.68] one I was asked to be a part of but the
[2206.40 - 2209.48] structure for all of them is very
[2207.68 - 2211.60] similar so I'm going to read off parts
[2209.48 - 2213.24] of the pitch that I received to give you
[2211.60 - 2214.96] a peek into how much money Ashley could
[2213.24 - 2217.72] have made from being a digital product
[2214.96 - 2219.20] contributor in the vegan bundle and
[2217.72 - 2222.00] selling and marketing it directly from
[2219.20 - 2225.16] her Instagram account the pitch I
[2222.00 - 2227.60] received said this in short we have over
[2225.16 - 2230.24] 100 creators come together and each add
[2227.60 - 2232.92] their book or course as an affiliate you
[2230.24 - 2235.24] would make $19 per bundle you sell I
[2232.92 - 2237.68] sold 800 bundles are last
[2235.24 - 2239.48] launch in the bundle companies Creator
[2237.68 - 2240.96] section of their website participating
[2239.48 - 2243.56] in the bundle is marketed to have the
[2240.96 - 2248.60] following benefits it says why should I
[2243.56 - 2252.08] join one high earnings two huge exposure
[2248.60 - 2254.36] three followers love it and then in the
[2252.08 - 2256.32] commission breakdown section it says if
[2254.36 - 2258.16] you contribute with one or several of
[2256.32 - 2261.44] your digital products in the bundle you
[2258.16 - 2265.20] get 70% Commission of the net profit
[2261.44 - 2267.08] which is $33 per bundle sold as somebody
[2265.20 - 2269.04] contributing an ebook Ashley could have
[2267.08 - 2271.48] gotten a similar commission making
[2269.04 - 2273.92] around $33 per bundle she sold through
[2271.48 - 2275.68] promoting it on her Instagram the person
[2273.92 - 2278.08] who reached out to me with this proposal
[2275.68 - 2281.24] said that they sold 800 bundle during
[2278.08 - 2283.16] one 10day launch as an example so just
[2281.24 - 2285.36] to piece all this together for everyone
[2283.16 - 2288.04] if Ashley with her 20,000 followers at
[2285.36 - 2289.84] the time would have sold even half of
[2288.04 - 2292.36] the example amount that I was given for
[2289.84 - 2296.08] a similar bundle and therefore made 400
[2292.36 - 2297.84] sales at $33 commission per bundle sold
[2296.08 - 2300.36] Ashley would have made
[2297.84 - 2302.88] $13,200 in 10
[2300.36 - 2304.64] days and again all of this is done
[2302.88 - 2307.52] through marketing the bundles on
[2304.64 - 2310.00] Instagram meaning that Ashley in fact
[2307.52 - 2311.40] made money or tried to make money off of
[2310.00 - 2315.72] her
[2311.40 - 2318.08] Instagram once again Ashley misled
[2315.72 - 2320.76] people we not only have proof that
[2318.08 - 2323.16] Ashley did in fact make money or try to
[2320.76 - 2324.80] make money off of her Instagram but we
[2323.16 - 2327.24] also have proof that she got new
[2324.80 - 2328.84] customers and likely made more money
[2327.24 - 2330.32] after she started pedaling her false
[2328.84 - 2332.68] storyline about
[2330.32 - 2335.72] Stephanie here's a comment somebody made
[2332.68 - 2339.16] to Ashley on Instagram on February 11th
[2335.72 - 2341.08] of 2020 it says hi Ash I had no idea who
[2339.16 - 2342.28] you were until today when your post
[2341.08 - 2345.16] about your dear friend started
[2342.28 - 2346.52] circulating social media first I'm so
[2345.16 - 2348.68] sorry for the losses that you've
[2346.52 - 2350.32] experienced and I'm hopeful that by
[2348.68 - 2352.36] sharing this that it will help those of
[2350.32 - 2354.04] us who follow Anthony make those hard
[2352.36 - 2356.40] decisions about the inner section of
[2354.04 - 2359.00] holistic wellness and life-saving modern
[2356.40 - 2361.00] medicine so many of us have been so sick
[2359.00 - 2363.04] for so long and we are vulnerable to a
[2361.00 - 2365.44] message of healing even if it's tainted
[2363.04 - 2367.40] or imperfect in some way thank you for
[2365.44 - 2369.12] sharing your truth I think it's so
[2367.40 - 2371.36] important to not follow anything or
[2369.12 - 2373.76] anyone blindly although so many have
[2371.36 - 2375.64] experienced healing with Anthony and I
[2373.76 - 2378.08] was super excited to order all of your
[2375.64 - 2382.04] books sending you lots of
[2378.08 - 2385.08] love to begin with that person believed
[2382.04 - 2387.80] I did what Ashley said I did Ashley
[2385.08 - 2391.60] created a false story and that person
[2387.80 - 2394.32] believed it and now that person believes
[2391.60 - 2396.48] Ashley is doing a justifiable action
[2394.32 - 2399.60] most likely that person will never hear
[2396.48 - 2402.16] the truth and they're probably just gone
[2399.60 - 2404.64] they left thinking that I hurt somebody
[2402.16 - 2408.96] second she purchased all of Ashley's
[2404.64 - 2411.24] books so Ashley made money selling books
[2408.96 - 2414.04] on a platform that was built off of
[2411.24 - 2417.32] medical medium and then at the same time
[2414.04 - 2420.52] using a false story to do so in that
[2417.32 - 2422.88] instance oh yeah and Ashley claimed that
[2420.52 - 2425.76] she never made money on her Instagram
[2422.88 - 2428.96] and here it is little old honest Ashley
[2425.76 - 2431.32] once again being dishonest
[2428.96 - 2434.08] even better than that Ashley's ebooks
[2431.32 - 2436.60] are still available for purchase to this
[2434.08 - 2438.48] day multiple people submitted receipts
[2436.60 - 2440.40] to us from their purchases of Ashley's
[2438.48 - 2443.08] ebooks in December of
[2440.40 - 2445.44] 2023 and Ashley wanted to make a whole
[2443.08 - 2448.24] lot more money off of the medical medium
[2445.44 - 2450.64] community Through many different Avenues
[2448.24 - 2452.40] this was what she wanted one
[2450.64 - 2456.40] money-making Avenue was through running
[2452.40 - 2458.32] big Retreats first in 2016 Ashley began
[2456.40 - 2460.52] by sending an email to let Anthony and
[2458.32 - 2462.88] his wife know that she wanted to host a
[2460.52 - 2464.40] retreat in Santa Monica California and
[2462.88 - 2467.44] she asked them if they would would give
[2464.40 - 2470.08] her and her Retreat a shout out then
[2467.44 - 2472.72] later on in 2016 Ashley submitted a
[2470.08 - 2474.40] business proposal to Anthony Ashley
[2472.72 - 2476.32] wanted to do medical medium Retreats
[2474.40 - 2478.20] with Anthony using the medical medium
[2476.32 - 2480.80] name in the summer of
[2478.20 - 2483.32] 2017 in the business proposal which I
[2480.80 - 2485.80] have in front of me Ashley included a
[2483.32 - 2488.60] cost analysis and financial forecast for
[2485.80 - 2492.28] 150 attendees with a cost of attendance
[2488.60 - 2494.92] of $3,000 per person and a total revenue
[2492.28 - 2494.92] amount of
[2495.28 - 2500.92] $450,000 it's worth noting that in this
[2498.00 - 2503.36] 2016 business proposal Ashley listed
[2500.92 - 2504.76] Robbie Barbaro on the retreat itinerary
[2503.36 - 2507.00] as someone who would have been teaching
[2504.76 - 2510.48] classes at the medical medium Retreat
[2507.00 - 2512.72] that she wanted to run and profit from
[2510.48 - 2515.60] Ashley also stated in her business
[2512.72 - 2518.36] proposal that quote by looking ahead to
[2515.60 - 2522.00] 2018 the quote event could grow up to
[2518.36 - 2524.56] 250 people if desired this shows that
[2522.00 - 2527.24] Ashley's desire was to do medical medium
[2524.56 - 2529.72] Retreats for years to come and to make
[2527.24 - 2533.16] even more money with more people at
[2529.72 - 2535.24] $3,000 per person with 250 people like
[2533.16 - 2537.52] Ashley desired the revenue would have
[2535.24 - 2537.52] been
[2538.56 - 2545.16] $750,000 and then came a pivotal moment
[2541.96 - 2548.40] in history Anthony turned it all down
[2545.16 - 2551.12] and said no to Ashley's big Retreat
[2548.40 - 2552.88] proposal I've always felt Ashley was not
[2551.12 - 2555.68] looking out for the community and The
[2552.88 - 2558.40] Chronic eel so much she was more into
[2555.68 - 2559.80] what can Ashley get out of this and that
[2558.40 - 2562.68] concerned
[2559.80 - 2564.92] me Ashley got turned down and then
[2562.68 - 2567.16] Ashley still had her mindset on doing
[2564.92 - 2569.44] Retreats so she went forward with trying
[2567.16 - 2571.76] to do them on her own we have a
[2569.44 - 2573.48] screenshot from Ashley's old website in
[2571.76 - 2576.56] which she had a spot she was using to
[2573.48 - 2581.08] Market upcoming Retreats under upcoming
[2576.56 - 2582.96] events it says summer Retreat 2017 check
[2581.08 - 2585.76] back for more information
[2582.96 - 2587.60] soon Ashley was trying to Market her own
[2585.76 - 2590.48] retreat but it seems as though this
[2587.60 - 2592.16] Retreat never ended up taking place
[2590.48 - 2593.96] however Ashley still kept trying to move
[2592.16 - 2597.00] forward to make her big retrieve
[2593.96 - 2601.84] business plans happen here is a text
[2597.00 - 2601.84] Ashley sent to someone on April 29th of
[2602.00 - 2607.12] 2018 would be fun to buy a small house
[2605.20 - 2611.00] there and just set it up to do retreat
[2607.12 - 2614.72] SS like comfy bunk beds in each room and
[2611.00 - 2617.44] make it hold 10 to 12 people and then I
[2614.72 - 2621.72] could fly into lead Retreats once a
[2617.44 - 2624.16] month and make like 30 grand house would
[2621.72 - 2624.16] pay for
[2624.60 - 2630.56] itself and here is another text she sent
[2627.44 - 2633.32] to the same person 3 days
[2630.56 - 2635.08] later it would make even more sense for
[2633.32 - 2639.68] me to just do like a full month of
[2635.08 - 2643.68] Retreats twice a year and bring in
[2639.68 - 2646.52] 240k less with costs of course how much
[2643.68 - 2649.44] cash do I need in the bank do you think
[2646.52 - 2652.08] to get a loan on these houses I'd want
[2649.44 - 2654.60] to do it without my
[2652.08 - 2658.24] trust she's the daughter of a
[2654.60 - 2661.16] billionaire family she has a trust fund
[2658.24 - 2663.52] and she was trying to use medical medium
[2661.16 - 2665.36] to make it big in the health industry
[2663.52 - 2667.84] and she didn't want to dip into her
[2665.36 - 2671.56] trust and I can promise you this her
[2667.84 - 2673.84] trust fund doesn't just have $20,000 in
[2671.56 - 2675.96] it I'm sure it
[2673.84 - 2677.84] doesn't we've got the daughter of a
[2675.96 - 2679.60] billionaire with a trust fund who's
[2677.84 - 2681.80] trying to act like she can't even afford
[2679.60 - 2683.76] a lawyer but she does have a lawyer by
[2681.80 - 2685.28] the way everybody should know that and
[2683.76 - 2687.68] she was trying to do medical medium
[2685.28 - 2690.80] Retreats so that she could make
[2687.68 - 2692.64] $240,000 a year from the chronically ill
[2690.80 - 2694.48] only have to show up for two months out
[2692.64 - 2698.12] of the year and she didn't want to dip
[2694.48 - 2699.88] into her trust fund amazing
[2698.12 - 2702.00] next I'm going to play voice text that
[2699.88 - 2705.08] Ashley sent to Anthony around that same
[2702.00 - 2707.24] time in 2018 asking him again about
[2705.08 - 2709.92] doing Retreats note that we are
[2707.24 - 2713.00] redacting the name of her child for
[2709.92 - 2715.64] privacy as you'll hear in the audios the
[2713.00 - 2717.72] Retreats were her and her friend's ideas
[2715.64 - 2720.72] Ashley reached out multiple times over
[2717.72 - 2723.84] the course of 17 days trying to get me
[2720.72 - 2725.60] on the phone trying to get me involved
[2723.84 - 2728.36] and still trying to use the medical
[2725.60 - 2730.80] medium name on them and get me to
[2728.36 - 2733.60] promote them and I was not interested
[2730.80 - 2735.20] and told her no this was many months
[2733.60 - 2737.08] after Stephanie was diagnosed with
[2735.20 - 2739.64] cancer and Ashley was trying to do
[2737.08 - 2739.64] business with
[2740.00 - 2744.00] me hey it's Ash I
[2747.76 - 2753.32] know got too
[2750.04 - 2755.04] bigle okay Budd um okay I know you
[2753.32 - 2756.44] talked to gret about this that she and I
[2755.04 - 2759.20] are trying to get some Retreat stuff
[2756.44 - 2761.04] going and she's doing one in Hawaii that
[2759.20 - 2763.76] I'm going to help her do the food for
[2761.04 - 2767.56] which will be really fun but we've also
[2763.76 - 2769.48] been talking about this main idea and um
[2767.56 - 2771.40] we're getting a proposal from them to do
[2769.48 - 2773.84] a retreat for a smaller group like you
[2771.40 - 2776.32] and I talked about of about 30 people
[2773.84 - 2779.40] this coming September and I just wanted
[2776.32 - 2781.56] to get a feel from you because I wasn't
[2779.40 - 2783.08] sure I kind of felt like you weren't
[2781.56 - 2785.12] really wanting to be involved in that
[2783.08 - 2787.92] which is totally fine I just wanted to
[2785.12 - 2789.20] make sure before we go ahead and see
[2787.92 - 2792.08] like is that something that you would
[2789.20 - 2796.00] want to do through medical medium at all
[2792.08 - 2798.12] and um if not we're going to just Market
[2796.00 - 2799.60] it as like a family Retreat where like
[2798.12 - 2802.60] the food happens to follow medical
[2799.60 - 2803.80] medium healing um guidelines and you
[2802.60 - 2805.72] know we'll be we'll run all our
[2803.80 - 2808.44] marketing by you guys just to make sure
[2805.72 - 2810.20] it's like on the up and up but um it
[2808.44 - 2812.24] wouldn't be like we would make sure to
[2810.20 - 2814.28] make it clear it's not like affiliated
[2812.24 - 2816.04] with medical medium so that's kind of
[2814.28 - 2817.76] what I'm thinking because I sort of got
[2816.04 - 2820.76] the vibe of like you're not sure about
[2817.76 - 2823.24] that yet but correct me if I'm wrong
[2820.76 - 2826.52] okay if you guys would like to
[2823.24 - 2828.48] be like have medical medium be the pH of
[2826.52 - 2831.28] something like that the idea I mean the
[2828.48 - 2833.92] retreat is just on a beautiful Retreat
[2831.28 - 2836.44] facility and there's hiking and beaches
[2833.92 - 2838.20] and a lake and we're not going to plan
[2836.44 - 2840.76] like too much for people it's mostly
[2838.20 - 2843.76] about you know a chance to get together
[2840.76 - 2845.56] with other people and all the food you
[2843.76 - 2847.96] know have the food done for you and just
[2845.56 - 2850.40] to rest and maybe there'll be like a
[2847.96 - 2852.16] cooking demo and some like guided
[2850.40 - 2854.96] meditations or something like that but
[2852.16 - 2858.52] nothing nothing super structured nothing
[2854.96 - 2860.12] real um formal it'll just be an
[2858.52 - 2863.72] opportunity for people to come take
[2860.12 - 2863.72] advantage of the
[2864.96 - 2869.28] location all I have to say just let me
[2867.08 - 2871.64] know if it's something you guys did do
[2869.28 - 2875.00] end up feeling like you want to be more
[2871.64 - 2877.32] through the mm Banner or if you're if
[2875.00 - 2880.32] you'd rather us just kind of take the
[2877.32 - 2882.24] lead and run with it and like I said
[2880.32 - 2885.04] we'll be we you know I'll check with you
[2882.24 - 2886.68] in case to make sure all our marketing
[2885.04 - 2888.80] is really clear in that case that it's
[2886.68 - 2892.16] not through you guys and and we won't
[2888.80 - 2892.16] we'll be careful with the wording and
[2893.24 - 2899.80] everything that first audio was sent on
[2896.00 - 2902.96] April 27th in 2018 Ashley did not get a
[2899.80 - 2905.68] response from Anthony and then Ashley
[2902.96 - 2907.88] sent another one nudging him further on
[2905.68 - 2910.52] May 14th
[2907.88 - 2913.88] hello good morning good afternoon I
[2910.52 - 2916.08] don't know where you are um this is the
[2913.88 - 2919.08] week we have to make a decision about
[2916.08 - 2921.20] the main Retreat we got a proposal back
[2919.08 - 2926.24] from Catherine at Point
[2921.20 - 2927.84] Lookout it suggests a cost of about
[2926.24 - 2931.00] 41,000
[2927.84 - 2934.28] and that's with an estimate of 30 people
[2931.00 - 2936.32] 30 adults and 10 children so the cost
[2934.28 - 2937.64] per person comes down to a little like
[2936.32 - 2939.64] around
[2937.64 - 2941.56] $1,100 per
[2939.64 - 2944.96] person
[2941.56 - 2947.40] so I think it has the potential to be a
[2944.96 - 2950.04] pretty good little test trial you know
[2947.40 - 2951.56] if we are thinking of a retreat cost of
[2950.04 - 2953.24] around
[2951.56 - 2955.56] $3,000
[2953.24 - 2957.96] um and it's really cool because if it
[2955.56 - 2961.96] did work next year we could do the same
[2957.96 - 2963.40] thing for 150 people and all of a sudden
[2961.96 - 2965.80] then it would really be generating some
[2963.40 - 2967.76] income let me know your thoughts it's
[2965.80 - 2969.88] obviously no pressure but we just are
[2967.76 - 2971.68] going to have to make some decisions
[2969.88 - 2974.96] about it this week
[2971.68 - 2976.40] so um any insight into what you're
[2974.96 - 2979.76] thinking and whether you guys would want
[2976.40 - 2982.40] to be involved would be awesome okay
[2979.76 - 2982.40] love you
[2984.96 - 2989.20] bye Ashley's saying here that the
[2987.24 - 2992.00] retreat she had been planning would just
[2989.20 - 2995.00] be a test trial she said that she wants
[2992.00 - 2998.20] to charge people $3,000 for the retreat
[2995.00 - 3000.64] and ultimately at some point host 150
[2998.20 - 3003.80] people which if you do the math would
[3000.64 - 3007.00] bring in almost half a million dollars
[3003.80 - 3010.00] half a million for one
[3007.00 - 3013.36] Retreat Anthony how did you respond to
[3010.00 - 3014.92] this prodding from Ashley I turned her
[3013.36 - 3017.88] down
[3014.92 - 3019.96] again right and then after you turned
[3017.88 - 3022.28] her down Ashley still tried to pursue
[3019.96 - 3024.88] doing Retreats on her own to whomever
[3022.28 - 3027.00] she could sell them to Ashley did end up
[3024.88 - 3029.60] hting a retreat later on with now
[3027.00 - 3031.40] co-plot Taylor and Gretchen and they had
[3029.60 - 3033.92] a total of 12
[3031.40 - 3036.16] attendees I'm sure that 12 attendees
[3033.92 - 3039.56] made Ashley a lot less money than the
[3036.16 - 3041.68] 150 to 250 attendees that Ashley was
[3039.56 - 3044.00] hoping to get from doing Retreats with
[3041.68 - 3046.20] Anthony using his name and
[3044.00 - 3048.84] likeness Ashley's retreat with Taylor
[3046.20 - 3052.64] and Gretchen took place in aahu Hawaii
[3048.84 - 3055.36] from October 15th through the 21st in
[3052.64 - 3058.16] 2018 this Retreat ended just 3 and A2
[3055.36 - 3059.48] weeks before Stephanie passed pass away
[3058.16 - 3061.32] in the marketing that was done to
[3059.48 - 3064.04] promoted on Instagram the details of the
[3061.32 - 3066.48] retreat included quote all organic
[3064.04 - 3069.36] plant-based grainfree meals in line with
[3066.48 - 3072.12] the medical medium protocol and quote
[3069.36 - 3075.16] cooking classes led by
[3072.12 - 3078.00] Ashley so again Ashley was too busy to
[3075.16 - 3079.76] visit Stephanie once while she was sick
[3078.00 - 3081.24] but she certainly wasn't too busy to
[3079.76 - 3083.76] travel from where she was living in
[3081.24 - 3085.36] California to Hawaii and run Retreats
[3083.76 - 3088.52] using medical medium
[3085.36 - 3091.04] information and then even over a year
[3088.52 - 3092.92] after Stephanie passed away Ashley was
[3091.04 - 3095.16] still trying to run medical medium
[3092.92 - 3096.88] Retreats Ashley ended up trying to sell
[3095.16 - 3098.68] a retreat that she would have hosted
[3096.88 - 3101.04] along with Gretchen in
[3098.68 - 3104.20] 2020 initially The Retreat dates were
[3101.04 - 3107.20] going to be August 31st to September 5th
[3104.20 - 3108.92] of 2020 initially Ashley had said that
[3107.20 - 3111.32] she wanted to add a second week to that
[3108.92 - 3113.88] but then she changed her mind Ashley
[3111.32 - 3116.96] marketed this Retreat all over her
[3113.88 - 3119.08] Instagram in early 2020 just literal
[3116.96 - 3122.56] weeks before she came out with her false
[3119.08 - 3124.56] Stephanie story in one Instagram post
[3122.56 - 3126.44] Ashley started describing the retreat by
[3124.56 - 3128.60] saying
[3126.44 - 3132.16] this cost is
[3128.60 - 3136.68] $3,800 for the week all meals daily
[3132.16 - 3136.68] hiking and yoga and celery juice
[3136.80 - 3142.00] included in that same Instagram story
[3139.52 - 3144.44] post Ashley included a blurry photo of
[3142.00 - 3146.60] random people swimming in the ocean she
[3144.44 - 3148.04] Drew an arrow pointing to two of them
[3146.60 - 3151.16] and said
[3148.04 - 3155.24] this I recognize that these are random
[3151.16 - 3155.24] people but this could be you and
[3156.96 - 3163.32] me in the next Instagram story Ashley
[3160.08 - 3166.20] said this I know it's expensive but if
[3163.32 - 3170.64] you find a Budd and save $10 a day
[3166.20 - 3170.64] between now and then you can both
[3170.96 - 3175.60] come Ashley then did a series of
[3173.88 - 3178.72] promotional Instagram stories for the
[3175.60 - 3183.00] retreat one said
[3178.72 - 3186.00] this OMG you guys I booked it I'm
[3183.00 - 3188.16] freaking out who will come eat dinner at
[3186.00 - 3191.72] this table with
[3188.16 - 3194.04] me she also included a poll in this post
[3191.72 - 3197.28] with one option being yes and the other
[3194.04 - 3200.32] option being yes also next to a photo of
[3197.28 - 3202.72] an outdoor table overlooking the beach
[3200.32 - 3204.92] then Ashley posted a very blurry photo
[3202.72 - 3209.64] of a bed and said
[3204.92 - 3212.92] this there are so few spaces six each
[3209.64 - 3212.92] week is this your
[3213.08 - 3218.68] bed Ashley did many other promotional
[3215.88 - 3220.60] posts for this Retreat on her Instagram
[3218.68 - 3223.12] and then she said
[3220.60 - 3226.00] this and for those of you who feel like
[3223.12 - 3228.80] you're missing out don't worry I'll do
[3226.00 - 3232.00] something here in laay in May more on
[3228.80 - 3235.40] that after I fill up
[3232.00 - 3238.92] Hawaii so Ashley planned to continue on
[3235.40 - 3240.68] doing retreats and making money Ashley
[3238.92 - 3243.60] then had two long-standing story
[3240.68 - 3245.36] highlights up on her Instagram in 2020
[3243.60 - 3247.28] one was for marketing her Retreat and
[3245.36 - 3250.00] the other was for marketing one of her
[3247.28 - 3252.40] ebooks in addition to those Retreats on
[3250.00 - 3254.52] her former website Ashley marketed a
[3252.40 - 3256.16] variety of different offerings a dinner
[3254.52 - 3259.08] party she hosted in
[3256.16 - 3260.32] 2018 a wellness week private retreat for
[3259.08 - 3263.08] two people in
[3260.32 - 3266.44] 2019 a cooking class and meal planning
[3263.08 - 3269.28] workshop that Ashley charged $150 per
[3266.44 - 3271.00] person for in 2018 and a virtual meal
[3269.28 - 3273.76] planning workshop that Ashley charged
[3271.00 - 3276.36] $60 per person for in
[3273.76 - 3278.52] 2018 Ashley also had an Amazon
[3276.36 - 3280.68] storefront she linked products like
[3278.52 - 3283.20] vimer G's barleygrass juice powder which
[3280.68 - 3286.12] Ashley described by saying
[3283.20 - 3289.40] this one of the supplements I take every
[3286.12 - 3291.60] single day I filed it under Beauty
[3289.40 - 3293.68] because it has helped my hair growing so
[3291.60 - 3296.68] thick and
[3293.68 - 3298.48] shiny Ashley had plenty of plans for
[3296.68 - 3300.64] making money off of the medical medium
[3298.48 - 3304.12] community Through many other avenues as
[3300.64 - 3306.16] well in 2016 Ashley submitted a proposal
[3304.12 - 3308.04] to Anthony's wife in which Ashley
[3306.16 - 3310.76] offered to invest in getting a YouTube
[3308.04 - 3313.72] channel going for medical medium Ashley
[3310.76 - 3316.12] proposed doing a 5050 Revenue split
[3313.72 - 3318.40] Ashley wanted 50% of all of the medical
[3316.12 - 3319.96] medium YouTube earnings this is
[3318.40 - 3323.28] something that never ended up panning
[3319.96 - 3325.44] out and so just so everyone is clear to
[3323.28 - 3328.64] this day I do not accept money from
[3325.44 - 3331.68] YouTube this was Ashley calculating and
[3328.64 - 3333.92] planning some kind of financial Endeavor
[3331.68 - 3336.16] that she wanted to do with me that
[3333.92 - 3338.80] wasn't about money going back into the
[3336.16 - 3341.36] community with more free resources
[3338.80 - 3344.48] instead it was Ashley hoping to make
[3341.36 - 3347.52] money for herself classic
[3344.48 - 3349.84] Ashley we also have texts that Ashley
[3347.52 - 3354.84] sent to a health practitioner friend on
[3349.84 - 3358.12] November 7th of 2017 they said
[3354.84 - 3361.36] this what if we did an ebook
[3358.12 - 3364.56] specifically for the postpartum period
[3361.36 - 3367.32] And if we kept it short and sweet we
[3364.56 - 3369.20] could release it for like $10 or
[3367.32 - 3372.56] [Music]
[3369.20 - 3374.92] something we could possibly talk to an
[3372.56 - 3377.56] and rage and see if they want to do it
[3374.92 - 3379.20] through medical medium like we could
[3377.56 - 3382.24] design the whole thing but they could
[3379.20 - 3386.48] release it as an mm ebook or something
[3382.24 - 3388.64] so much more reach that way
[3386.48 - 3391.32] again this was taking place during the
[3388.64 - 3393.72] time that Stephanie was sick instead of
[3391.32 - 3395.84] visiting Stephanie Ashley was using that
[3393.72 - 3398.20] time trying to become something in the
[3395.84 - 3400.80] health industry using the medical medium
[3398.20 - 3404.80] name another text she sent to the same
[3400.80 - 3408.72] friend on March 27th of 2018
[3404.80 - 3411.52] reads I know I wrote a whole book last
[3408.72 - 3417.84] year and then realized I had to do a
[3411.52 - 3417.84] proposal and still haven't started lol
[3418.04 - 3424.24] on May 15th of 2018 the friend asked
[3421.56 - 3426.00] when is your ebook launch so exciting
[3424.24 - 3429.96] and Ashley
[3426.00 - 3433.28] replied H probably in another two weeks
[3429.96 - 3436.04] or so I know so much exciting stuff
[3433.28 - 3439.24] these days I'm cooking for Gretchen's
[3436.04 - 3442.08] retreat in October I decided to host the
[3439.24 - 3446.32] one-day cooking class of my very own
[3442.08 - 3448.72] this August and the ebook
[3446.32 - 3451.72] I'm talking to an agent today about
[3448.72 - 3457.84] doing my own cookbook we're remodeling
[3451.72 - 3461.08] the playroom and the yard my head is
[3457.84 - 3463.04] spinning around this time Ashley had
[3461.08 - 3465.76] asked me to co-author a medical medium
[3463.04 - 3467.20] recipe book with her and I said no and
[3465.76 - 3469.76] turned her
[3467.20 - 3471.64] down it looks like after Ashley got
[3469.76 - 3473.68] turned down on co-authoring a medical
[3471.64 - 3477.44] medium book Ashley then went around
[3473.68 - 3479.36] trying to pursue a book deal on her own
[3477.44 - 3481.72] and Ashley was desperately trying to
[3479.36 - 3485.52] grow a following on social media here is
[3481.72 - 3485.52] a text she sent to a friend in
[3485.72 - 3490.28] 2017 had a meeting with a marketing
[3488.20 - 3493.32] consultant
[3490.28 - 3495.72] yesterday the friend responded by asking
[3493.32 - 3498.12] is this for your brand for your book and
[3495.72 - 3498.12] Ashley
[3498.40 - 3503.60] replied I basically just have to get my
[3501.04 - 3506.88] numbers up before I post all the random
[3503.60 - 3509.08] baby photos and stuff yeah
[3506.88 - 3511.96] every time I post something other than
[3509.08 - 3515.44] food I lose about 10 followers which
[3511.96 - 3517.72] adds up so I have to sort of streamline
[3515.44 - 3522.04] and
[3517.72 - 3525.16] focus in the same text thread Ashley
[3522.04 - 3527.76] said up for a little friendly
[3525.16 - 3530.32] competition I just want to like I don't
[3527.76 - 3533.28] know I need some inspiration to get
[3530.32 - 3534.76] serious about growing my insta so I
[3533.28 - 3537.92] thought you might be down for a little
[3534.76 - 3542.28] challenge like one to gain 10K or
[3537.92 - 3545.36] something we can put some fun Stakes on
[3542.28 - 3547.48] it Ashley was regularly asking this
[3545.36 - 3550.24] person for advice on how to grow her
[3547.48 - 3551.12] social media following in another text
[3550.24 - 3555.00] she
[3551.12 - 3557.20] asked question did your IG growth slow
[3555.00 - 3559.72] down so much because you're only posting
[3557.20 - 3563.40] less frequently how many times do you
[3559.72 - 3568.08] think one needs to pose to
[3563.40 - 3571.08] grow after receiving advice at said this
[3568.08 - 3573.64] okay I've been trying to post one today
[3571.08 - 3576.68] and I like lose followers at that rate
[3573.64 - 3578.96] LOL it seems like if you start a YouTube
[3576.68 - 3581.96] channel you get way more followers
[3578.96 - 3581.96] without posting as
[3582.28 - 3588.28] much after receiving advice again a
[3585.40 - 3591.16] couple days later Ashley said
[3588.28 - 3593.92] this I finally have been consistent
[3591.16 - 3596.76] enough with insta where I'm not losing
[3593.92 - 3599.56] followers at least once a day posting
[3596.76 - 3602.68] results in like super slow growth like
[3599.56 - 3605.76] 10 new a day or
[3602.68 - 3608.44] so on a later date frustrated with not
[3605.76 - 3611.08] seeing the growth she so desired Ashley
[3608.44 - 3611.08] sent this
[3612.76 - 3621.68] text I'm posting twice a day on IG
[3617.04 - 3621.68] really top quality photos and seeing no
[3621.76 - 3626.68] growth she got some more advice from
[3624.28 - 3628.60] this person on Switching up her hashtags
[3626.68 - 3630.32] and then several hours later Ashley
[3628.60 - 3633.72] texted
[3630.32 - 3636.28] back okay I changed them up to see if it
[3633.72 - 3638.24] helps got a little boost from switching
[3636.28 - 3641.04] them
[3638.24 - 3643.60] up okay so Ashley had a meeting with an
[3641.04 - 3645.16] agent about getting herself a book deal
[3643.60 - 3647.12] Ashley had a meeting with a marketing
[3645.16 - 3649.24] consultant and then she was trying
[3647.12 - 3651.92] really hard to grow her social media
[3649.24 - 3654.48] following Anthony can you explain for
[3651.92 - 3656.96] listeners how book deals work and why
[3654.48 - 3659.76] this was so important to her
[3656.96 - 3661.88] it was a different world back in 2018 it
[3659.76 - 3664.36] was before influencers could become
[3661.88 - 3667.60] famous on social media you either got
[3664.36 - 3669.88] somewhere on television acting music
[3667.60 - 3672.64] getting signed in a record deal
[3669.88 - 3675.28] something in sports or in publishing
[3672.64 - 3677.20] getting a book deal maybe it was before
[3675.28 - 3678.68] the time period we're living in now
[3677.20 - 3680.96] where someone hits their grandmother
[3678.68 - 3683.08] over the head with a 2x4 and gets 20
[3680.96 - 3685.04] million views and the person who hit the
[3683.08 - 3686.44] grandmother over the head with the 2x4
[3685.04 - 3689.64] has endorsement deal
[3686.44 - 3693.00] the world has changed Ashley was
[3689.64 - 3695.44] desperate to get a book deal desperate
[3693.00 - 3697.88] to become somebody Ashley wanted to
[3695.44 - 3701.24] co-author a book with me she was very
[3697.88 - 3704.08] entitled and raised that way and she
[3701.24 - 3707.32] expected to co-author a book with me she
[3704.08 - 3710.64] expected it I said no for a multitude of
[3707.32 - 3713.04] reasons and I'm so glad I said no
[3710.64 - 3715.92] because this is the kind of person she
[3713.04 - 3718.92] is back then I noticed that when I spoke
[3715.92 - 3720.88] to Ashley she would say something and
[3718.92 - 3723.92] then the second time she said it it
[3720.88 - 3726.20] would be different I didn't trust her I
[3723.92 - 3728.64] said no so Ashley tried to get a book
[3726.20 - 3730.84] deal on her own and in order to get a
[3728.64 - 3733.36] book deal on her own she needed a
[3730.84 - 3735.52] certain number of followers so Ashley
[3733.36 - 3737.76] was trying to learn from people like
[3735.52 - 3740.32] Robbie her best friend one of the other
[3737.76 - 3742.20] plotters how to build followers on her
[3740.32 - 3745.00] Instagram
[3742.20 - 3746.56] Facebook that makes sense so clearly
[3745.00 - 3749.00] Ashley was trying to make a name for
[3746.56 - 3751.68] herself and build a platform for herself
[3749.00 - 3754.72] she ultimately wanted to be famous she
[3751.68 - 3756.08] was definitely also trying to make money
[3754.72 - 3757.84] the claims Ashley made when she was
[3756.08 - 3759.76] trying to get people to trust her with
[3757.84 - 3761.72] her fake Stephanie story that she never
[3759.76 - 3764.16] made money off of her Instagram and
[3761.72 - 3767.52] intentionally never did because of how
[3764.16 - 3770.56] much she quote values the truth are flat
[3767.52 - 3773.84] out lies Ashley was using Instagram to
[3770.56 - 3775.40] sell ebooks Retreats bundles and more
[3773.84 - 3778.00] and let's be clear making money off of
[3775.40 - 3780.20] Instagram is fine that's not the problem
[3778.00 - 3783.40] but why did Ashley feel the need to lie
[3780.20 - 3785.88] about it furthermore Ashley even tried
[3783.40 - 3787.76] to pursue another Avenue for profit by
[3785.88 - 3790.40] offering to invest in a brand that
[3787.76 - 3793.60] Anthony endorses here is the text she
[3790.40 - 3797.16] had sent to the owner of that
[3793.60 - 3799.12] company also bear this in mind if you
[3797.16 - 3801.88] ever decide you want to do a big push
[3799.12 - 3804.88] with vimergy and take on some investment
[3801.88 - 3808.16] and try and grow it up quick let me know
[3804.88 - 3808.16] i' do it with y'all in a
[3808.20 - 3814.04] heartbeat there you have it Ashley got
[3810.92 - 3818.28] turned down on this proposal as
[3814.04 - 3821.40] well Ashley Foster always gets her way
[3818.28 - 3824.88] no one's allowed to tell Ashley no if
[3821.40 - 3827.96] they do Ashley will turn on them anyone
[3824.88 - 3829.40] who tells her no will pay the price it's
[3827.96 - 3832.40] who she
[3829.40 - 3834.60] is not only did Ashley eagerly want to
[3832.40 - 3837.16] invest in vimergy but this is also a
[3834.60 - 3839.40] company that has products that before
[3837.16 - 3841.72] Ashley got upset and turned on everyone
[3839.40 - 3844.92] Ashley said she used every day and that
[3841.72 - 3845.64] helped her hair quote grow in so thick
[3844.92 - 3848.16] and
[3845.64 - 3850.32] shiny now after being turned down by
[3848.16 - 3852.60] them years ago Ashley and her hateful
[3850.32 - 3854.24] group repeatedly attacked this company
[3852.60 - 3856.96] along with Anthony and the medical
[3854.24 - 3859.28] medium Community after we released the
[3856.96 - 3860.88] plotter podcast episodes last year in
[3859.28 - 3863.12] another post Ashley made as she was
[3860.88 - 3866.44] trying to say face she said
[3863.12 - 3869.04] this something that really bothers me me
[3866.44 - 3871.76] is how Anthony claimed in his podcast
[3869.04 - 3873.92] that we were doing this for money but at
[3871.76 - 3876.48] the same time claims that we must be
[3873.92 - 3880.08] part of some evil plot because we have
[3876.48 - 3884.52] money which one is
[3880.08 - 3886.80] it this is inaccurate if you listen back
[3884.52 - 3889.84] this instead is what was actually said
[3886.80 - 3889.84] in our first podcast
[3889.88 - 3895.04] episode what I learned is that the
[3893.12 - 3897.80] strategy of this group is to try to
[3895.04 - 3900.96] capture people people like those young
[3897.80 - 3903.24] women with a manipulated story of a
[3900.96 - 3905.32] deceased person who isn't here anymore
[3903.24 - 3907.60] to speak for herself or to defend the
[3905.32 - 3909.36] truth of what actually happened they
[3907.60 - 3911.40] might throw in some other random
[3909.36 - 3913.48] misinformation to add to their story of
[3911.40 - 3915.52] why you shouldn't trust medical medium
[3913.48 - 3917.96] because they try to act like they have
[3915.52 - 3920.60] some special information that you just
[3917.96 - 3922.32] don't know even though all these people
[3920.60 - 3924.24] still admitted to applying medical
[3922.32 - 3926.84] medium information into their own lives
[3924.24 - 3928.92] yet they say that they don't trust you
[3926.84 - 3930.24] they just don't they they explicitly say
[3928.92 - 3933.36] that they don't credit The Source they
[3930.24 - 3935.52] use it and don't credit the source and I
[3933.36 - 3938.64] literally heard them out on all of their
[3935.52 - 3940.72] points for a total of over 17 hours and
[3938.64 - 3943.84] I can tell you that everything that they
[3940.72 - 3945.96] think they have is a bunch of Twisted
[3943.84 - 3948.24] misinformation their false narrative
[3945.96 - 3950.56] story is the guise that they're using
[3948.24 - 3953.28] but what these calls also made clear to
[3950.56 - 3955.68] me is that some of these sources are
[3953.28 - 3958.04] part of this plan because they're
[3955.68 - 3960.88] actually being driven by some of it is
[3958.04 - 3964.60] misplaced grief some of it is people
[3960.88 - 3966.76] being driven by guilt but most of them
[3964.60 - 3968.64] disturbingly are being driven by
[3966.76 - 3970.64] self-interests and what they would stand
[3968.64 - 3974.44] to gain financially and otherwise from
[3970.64 - 3974.44] the impact of a medical medium
[3974.84 - 3980.32] takedown I stand by all of that Ashley
[3977.84 - 3983.32] always gets it wrong first as you can
[3980.32 - 3985.76] hear it was me who said this not Anthony
[3983.32 - 3987.80] hi Ashley I did not say that you were of
[3985.76 - 3989.52] a plot because you have money your
[3987.80 - 3992.64] friend Taylor called you out for having
[3989.52 - 3995.00] a lot of money like private jet plus her
[3992.64 - 3997.64] words I said that I suspected that the
[3995.00 - 3999.20] plotters had mixed motives we didn't
[3997.64 - 4001.84] mention the fact that some of them have
[3999.20 - 4003.16] money and some of them don't have money
[4001.84 - 4004.88] and there are plenty of extremely
[4003.16 - 4006.28] wealthy people out there including
[4004.88 - 4008.24] billionaires and Daughters of
[4006.28 - 4011.04] billionaires who never stop wanting to
[4008.24 - 4014.00] make more money what Ashley said is a
[4011.04 - 4016.04] false dichotomy in fact Ashley knows
[4014.00 - 4018.52] that this is a false dichotomy
[4016.04 - 4021.36] in text messages she sent to a friend in
[4018.52 - 4023.92] 2017 Ashley used the following words to
[4021.36 - 4025.84] describe her own father who had long
[4023.92 - 4028.20] since been a billionaire and his
[4025.84 - 4028.20] business
[4028.72 - 4034.32] dealings he's trying to build something
[4031.36 - 4037.40] bigger and bigger and bigger I think
[4034.32 - 4040.24] he's just addicted to the game he's a
[4037.40 - 4044.12] real true addict the rush of the
[4040.24 - 4046.68] gambling element is so addictive to
[4044.12 - 4048.72] him well Ashley was applying medical
[4046.68 - 4050.88] medium information she wanted to do
[4048.72 - 4053.60] high-profit Retreats without dipping
[4050.88 - 4056.20] into her trust fund admitting in that
[4053.60 - 4059.20] very text that she has money but that
[4056.20 - 4060.88] she wants to make more Ashley was
[4059.20 - 4062.88] selling eBooks she was working with
[4060.88 - 4065.00] bundle companies she wanted to be an
[4062.88 - 4066.60] author she was meeting with marketing
[4065.00 - 4068.24] consultants she wanted to grow a
[4066.60 - 4070.40] following she wanted to run the medical
[4068.24 - 4072.52] medium YouTube channel for 50% of the
[4070.40 - 4074.64] earnings she wanted to have a stake in a
[4072.52 - 4076.32] company endorsed by medical medium and
[4074.64 - 4078.80] more
[4076.32 - 4080.76] Ashley also talked about wanting to do a
[4078.80 - 4084.08] positive medical medium documentary on
[4080.76 - 4087.00] Me on the light blast years ago she had
[4084.08 - 4088.12] her sight set on it she was obsessed
[4087.00 - 4090.68] with
[4088.12 - 4092.68] it okay so this is going to be shocking
[4090.68 - 4095.68] for people listening to hear to hear
[4092.68 - 4098.12] that so Ashley has wanted to make a
[4095.68 - 4100.60] documentary in some way shape or form
[4098.12 - 4103.44] about you for a long time this goes way
[4100.60 - 4105.76] back one of the most interesting things
[4103.44 - 4107.64] I've seen from Ashley is that one of her
[4105.76 - 4110.48] longest standing goals has been to
[4107.64 - 4113.24] become successful specifically in the
[4110.48 - 4115.80] film industry in a blog post Ashley
[4113.24 - 4120.24] wrote in 2010 she described a rule book
[4115.80 - 4123.04] she had for herself one of her rules was
[4120.24 - 4126.36] this right did you write
[4123.04 - 4128.60] today right and the writing you do today
[4126.36 - 4131.80] must eventually lead to a successful
[4128.60 - 4131.80] career in the film
[4132.72 - 4137.12] industry as you just heard Ashley has
[4135.48 - 4140.48] always wanted to be successful in the
[4137.12 - 4142.68] film industry Ashley's husband is also a
[4140.48 - 4145.56] documentary cinematographer I'm sure
[4142.68 - 4147.68] that he wants to be well known for that
[4145.56 - 4149.64] can you describe for everyone Anthony
[4147.68 - 4151.68] what the proposal that Ashley made to
[4149.64 - 4153.56] you years ago for a positive medical
[4151.68 - 4156.84] medium documentary was
[4153.56 - 4159.04] like Ashley was so fixated at wanting to
[4156.84 - 4161.76] do a documentary she asked me about it
[4159.04 - 4164.64] first on the phone she asked a mutual
[4161.76 - 4166.84] friend about it over and over again that
[4164.64 - 4169.84] mutual friend brought it up to my wife
[4166.84 - 4172.44] and I again and was in conversation with
[4169.84 - 4174.56] Ashley about it Ashley wanted to write
[4172.44 - 4176.84] and control the content of the
[4174.56 - 4179.60] documentary she wanted her husband to
[4176.84 - 4182.12] film it and she wanted her sister to
[4179.60 - 4185.04] edit it over the years I've been
[4182.12 - 4187.40] approached many times by big producers
[4185.04 - 4189.96] media companies and networks about doing
[4187.40 - 4192.08] a medical medium documentary or TV show
[4189.96 - 4194.36] my wife and I thought it'd be great to
[4192.08 - 4196.04] get people's healing stories and more
[4194.36 - 4199.24] information out there there to help the
[4196.04 - 4201.96] chronically ill at some point but we
[4199.24 - 4204.44] wouldn't have gone to Ashley to do a
[4201.96 - 4206.76] documentary we entertained Ashley's
[4204.44 - 4210.00] ideas but then we quickly became
[4206.76 - 4213.24] concerned about what Ashley was
[4210.00 - 4215.44] saying so I have that text thread in
[4213.24 - 4217.56] front of me your wife initiates a
[4215.44 - 4219.36] conversation with Ashley about it after
[4217.56 - 4221.76] Ashley had been prodding about doing a
[4219.36 - 4223.24] documentary for a while Ashley says that
[4221.76 - 4225.60] she had thought about doing the
[4223.24 - 4228.16] documentary idea a lot and then she gets
[4225.60 - 4229.20] into her proposal she starts describing
[4228.16 - 4232.12] some of her
[4229.20 - 4235.08] ideas I like the idea of following a new
[4232.12 - 4237.72] client we could even fake that part of
[4235.08 - 4237.72] it
[4237.96 - 4243.44] LOL it can be an actor that recreates a
[4240.76 - 4246.00] storyline that is true that's frequently
[4243.44 - 4246.00] done for
[4246.76 - 4251.84] documentaries this sounds super sketchy
[4249.88 - 4253.32] very weird of Ashley to suggest being
[4251.84 - 4256.08] dishonest and to say that that's
[4253.32 - 4258.64] frequently done in documentaries
[4256.08 - 4260.84] after your wife politely responds
[4258.64 - 4262.96] interesting Ashley right away changes
[4260.84 - 4267.40] her mind on the idea that she herself
[4262.96 - 4270.20] just presented the actor idea is no good
[4267.40 - 4275.76] if someone got wind of it it would be
[4270.20 - 4275.76] real bad but it is common
[4276.08 - 4281.76] LOL these were more signs we saw first
[4279.40 - 4284.68] hand of Ashley being manipulative and
[4281.76 - 4287.24] dishonest it made us really really
[4284.68 - 4287.24] uncomfortable
[4287.28 - 4291.12] right after Ashley's last message your
[4289.24 - 4293.60] wife changes the subject and ends the
[4291.12 - 4296.28] documentary conversation so I'm guessing
[4293.60 - 4299.44] you guys had turned her down on that
[4296.28 - 4301.96] sketchy proposal as well yeah in the
[4299.44 - 4304.24] nicest way possible she kept asking
[4301.96 - 4306.36] about it and prodding and it's something
[4304.24 - 4309.40] we were never going to do with her we
[4306.36 - 4311.52] didn't want to disappoint Ashley but we
[4309.40 - 4314.92] just were not on the same page about it
[4311.52 - 4318.20] at all for Ashley to suggest altering a
[4314.92 - 4321.12] docu doumentary so it becomes dishonest
[4318.20 - 4322.96] was unimaginable for a medical medium
[4321.12 - 4326.40] documentary we were sitting there
[4322.96 - 4329.48] wondering why on Earth is Ashley telling
[4326.40 - 4332.92] us this is how you do a documentary you
[4329.48 - 4335.12] fabricated in a dishonest way this was a
[4332.92 - 4338.88] shocker to
[4335.12 - 4341.24] us yeah so Ashley wanted her hand in
[4338.88 - 4343.80] every pot with you I'm sure that she saw
[4341.24 - 4345.40] you as a ticket to success everybody
[4343.80 - 4347.60] knows that you're one of the biggest he
[4345.40 - 4349.56] authors in the world Ashley was trying
[4347.60 - 4351.76] to use the medical medium name to get
[4349.56 - 4353.40] herself and her husband somewhere and
[4351.76 - 4356.60] she ended up getting turned down from
[4353.40 - 4358.56] basically every angle Ashley had spent
[4356.60 - 4360.44] years trying to pursue all these
[4358.56 - 4362.52] different Avenues and they were
[4360.44 - 4364.84] unsuccessful Ashley was struggling to
[4362.52 - 4367.00] grow a following she got turned down on
[4364.84 - 4369.16] co-authoring a book with you getting a
[4367.00 - 4371.24] book deal on her own evidently didn't
[4369.16 - 4373.56] work out she got turned down on
[4371.24 - 4375.60] investing in a company endorsed by you
[4373.56 - 4377.52] the medical medium YouTube channel deal
[4375.60 - 4380.20] that Ashley proposed didn't work out for
[4377.52 - 4382.28] her she got turned down on her proposal
[4380.20 - 4384.56] to partner with you to do medical medium
[4382.28 - 4387.36] Retreats her independent Retreat only
[4384.56 - 4389.64] filled 12 spots Ashley never made it in
[4387.36 - 4391.68] the film industry like she wanted to she
[4389.64 - 4393.52] got turned down on her proposal to do an
[4391.68 - 4395.56] inspirational documentary about medical
[4393.52 - 4398.16] medium that she wanted her husband to
[4395.56 - 4401.88] film and her sister to
[4398.16 - 4403.76] edit was Ashley upset with you I mean
[4401.88 - 4406.08] how did she respond to all of this
[4403.76 - 4409.08] rejection at the time
[4406.08 - 4411.64] she was disappointed and frustrated
[4409.08 - 4414.64] Ashley wanted desperately to have a hand
[4411.64 - 4416.40] in Everything Medical medium everything
[4414.64 - 4419.72] she wanted a piece of everything I was
[4416.40 - 4422.04] doing and now look what she's doing
[4419.72 - 4424.36] because she didn't get her way Ashley's
[4422.04 - 4427.44] not used to being told no it's an
[4424.36 - 4429.60] entitlement and an ego thing when Ashley
[4427.44 - 4431.88] realized she wasn't going to be able to
[4429.60 - 4434.72] get all of these high-profile business
[4431.88 - 4435.68] deals with me she flipped the switch was
[4434.72 - 4437.64] flipped
[4435.68 - 4440.40] and she started making things up that
[4437.64 - 4443.12] didn't exist she started working on her
[4440.40 - 4445.88] false story lines and any communication
[4443.12 - 4448.16] she had with me of any kind or anybody I
[4445.88 - 4450.84] was associated with she started to try
[4448.16 - 4453.20] to twist and rewrite history so she
[4450.84 - 4456.16] could tell people a disturbing story
[4453.20 - 4458.44] that never existed and then she decided
[4456.16 - 4461.52] to take her stories to the media to try
[4458.44 - 4464.28] to hurt me and the
[4461.52 - 4466.28] community and you turned her down on
[4464.28 - 4469.00] these deals years ago because you had
[4466.28 - 4471.24] concerns about her intentions I turned
[4469.00 - 4473.76] her down for multiple reasons first of
[4471.24 - 4476.12] all every time someone I knew would talk
[4473.76 - 4477.96] to Ashley they would be left shaking
[4476.12 - 4479.84] their heads because it seemed that
[4477.96 - 4483.32] nothing that came out of Ashley's mouth
[4479.84 - 4486.92] was totally accurate she was 5050 at
[4483.32 - 4490.60] best 50% mixed in accurate things with
[4486.92 - 4492.88] 50% mixed in completely wrong inaccurate
[4490.60 - 4495.16] information and it was obvious to me
[4492.88 - 4496.96] that Ashley was only wanting to be be
[4495.16 - 4499.24] involved with medical medium because of
[4496.96 - 4502.36] her wanting to start a business
[4499.24 - 4505.16] involving me or use me to launch her
[4502.36 - 4507.68] business and I knew this about Ashley
[4505.16 - 4510.56] it's not that I'm saying it's bad she
[4507.68 - 4513.48] wants to become somebody it's bad that
[4510.56 - 4517.56] her desire was to become somebody using
[4513.48 - 4519.76] me and then when I said no afterwards
[4517.56 - 4522.04] trying to destroy the medical medium
[4519.76 - 4525.36] community and me because she didn't get
[4522.04 - 4527.64] her way even if there was a world Where
[4525.36 - 4530.32] I Was Naive enough to give Ashley all
[4527.64 - 4532.64] that she wanted a book deal with me big
[4530.32 - 4536.24] Retreats with my name on them
[4532.64 - 4539.32] $750,000 like pop documentaries for her
[4536.24 - 4541.36] and her husband money made from those
[4539.32 - 4543.56] Ventures which could have equated to
[4541.36 - 4546.32] Millions would have been taken from the
[4543.56 - 4548.64] community and not invested back into the
[4546.32 - 4551.56] community on any level it would have
[4548.64 - 4555.00] been selfs serving as we'll cover later
[4551.56 - 4557.32] on Ashley is so cheap she wouldn't Buy
[4555.00 - 4559.56] Stephanie a coach plane ticket to help
[4557.32 - 4563.00] Stephanie get out to Ashley's family's
[4559.56 - 4565.44] Pebble Beach mansion and money that I've
[4563.00 - 4567.64] made from working around the clock a big
[4565.44 - 4569.72] portion of that money goes back into
[4567.64 - 4571.96] producing free everything for the
[4569.72 - 4574.52] community if there was a world where I
[4571.96 - 4577.40] was naive enough to let Ashley go into
[4574.52 - 4579.20] multiple business deals with me all that
[4577.40 - 4581.60] money would have been
[4579.20 - 4583.72] squandered Penny pinched and
[4581.60 - 4585.28] self-serving for her children and her
[4583.72 - 4587.72] lifestyle so that she can can have
[4585.28 - 4590.80] expensive vacations and grandiose
[4587.72 - 4592.88] dinners with friends all while I will
[4590.80 - 4595.04] still be standing in my kitchen eating a
[4592.88 - 4598.12] steamed potato standing up working 20
[4595.04 - 4601.84] hours a day to get the next book out so
[4598.12 - 4604.12] people can heal an example of how Ashley
[4601.84 - 4607.52] works is that she wanted to make all
[4604.12 - 4610.36] this money from you the community that
[4607.52 - 4613.28] doesn't have money so she's didn't have
[4610.36 - 4616.48] to touch her trust fund a trust fund
[4613.28 - 4618.72] with an exorbitant amount of money in it
[4616.48 - 4621.28] it would have been unfair to the
[4618.72 - 4624.76] community that Ashley was making a
[4621.28 - 4626.92] killing off their backs I could not live
[4624.76 - 4629.32] with that so I chose not to do a
[4626.92 - 4631.76] documentary with her I chose not to let
[4629.32 - 4633.80] her co-author books with me and I chose
[4631.76 - 4636.68] not to go into the retreat business with
[4633.80 - 4639.72] her using my name Ashley would have made
[4636.68 - 4642.88] a killing so that she could avoid using
[4639.72 - 4645.52] her trust fund from her billionaire
[4642.88 - 4648.08] father now after I turned her down and
[4645.52 - 4650.24] she didn't get what she wanted Ashley is
[4648.08 - 4653.04] trying to become famous through
[4650.24 - 4655.60] pretending to be a whistleblower
[4653.04 - 4658.16] spreading lies false claims and
[4655.60 - 4661.24] disinformation and trying to frame me
[4658.16 - 4664.16] along with her partner Tony tazone
[4661.24 - 4666.96] Stephanie's brother who as one of the
[4664.16 - 4669.52] plotters said is just looking for
[4666.96 - 4672.48] someone to blame according to another
[4669.52 - 4675.32] plotter Tony has multiple fake accounts
[4672.48 - 4679.20] on social media platforms and and he may
[4675.32 - 4682.48] not realize it but he's doing Ashley's
[4679.20 - 4685.12] bidding she's stoking the Flames of his
[4682.48 - 4687.56] grief and anger and Tony doesn't know
[4685.12 - 4691.04] why Ashley's really on this Mission
[4687.56 - 4693.80] she's using him Ashley has recruited
[4691.04 - 4697.12] other people to spread her lies for her
[4693.80 - 4699.04] we have Insider information that she's
[4697.12 - 4702.60] promising the people who are supporting
[4699.04 - 4705.32] her a spot in a documentary ultimately
[4702.60 - 4707.92] Ashley's goal is now to make it
[4705.32 - 4710.08] somewhere in the film industry by trying
[4707.92 - 4712.56] to get a deal for a negative hitpiece
[4710.08 - 4716.36] documentary about me and to take the
[4712.56 - 4718.72] medical mum Community down in the
[4716.36 - 4720.04] process I also want to ask you this
[4718.72 - 4723.28] because I know that there will be people
[4720.04 - 4726.36] out there wondering about spirit and if
[4723.28 - 4729.36] Ashley was capable of all of this
[4726.36 - 4730.96] spinning stories and lying to harm you
[4729.36 - 4734.28] and attacking the medical medium
[4730.96 - 4736.96] Community then can you explain why why
[4734.28 - 4739.76] did let you engage with her at all
[4736.96 - 4742.84] Spirit told me not to engage with Ashley
[4739.76 - 4746.56] and I voiced that to my friends Ashley
[4742.84 - 4749.04] was a friend of a friend I communicated
[4746.56 - 4751.84] with Ashley very little I kept her at
[4749.04 - 4754.60] arms length when I got off the phone
[4751.84 - 4757.80] after one of my first calls with her I
[4754.60 - 4760.92] said to my wife no she is not a good
[4757.80 - 4764.84] person she seems empty and soulless and
[4760.92 - 4767.60] not genuine and Spirits given me a war
[4764.84 - 4769.64] warning but I gave it a chance because I
[4767.60 - 4772.28] always keep faith that people will heal
[4769.64 - 4775.32] their mental state Spirit gave me the
[4772.28 - 4778.28] potential that Ashley could be an
[4775.32 - 4780.40] ill-intentioned person but you can only
[4778.28 - 4783.16] hope that someone uses their free will
[4780.40 - 4786.04] to do good things and not harmful things
[4783.16 - 4788.24] despicable things abusive things and I
[4786.04 - 4790.04] didn't want to let a mutual friend down
[4788.24 - 4793.28] who was wanting me to connect with
[4790.04 - 4796.96] Ashley for somebody that said I saved
[4793.28 - 4800.28] her and her sister's life and to turn so
[4796.96 - 4803.32] dark and to lie so much really brings me
[4800.28 - 4805.96] a new understanding of what people can
[4803.32 - 4808.32] be I mean you expect out there in the
[4805.96 - 4812.20] world for things to go wrong but you
[4808.32 - 4815.68] never expect a mom to be so conniving
[4812.20 - 4819.28] and just plain evil she built the whole
[4815.68 - 4821.68] thing off of originally I never told
[4819.28 - 4825.36] Stephanie to see a doctor which was a
[4821.68 - 4828.08] lie that alone is sick if you think are
[4825.36 - 4831.40] falsities lies and fabricated stories
[4828.08 - 4833.32] about me are harmful and ridiculous now
[4831.40 - 4835.84] what would have happened if I didn't
[4833.32 - 4838.72] keep Ashley at arms
[4835.84 - 4841.40] length I mean just in what we've exposed
[4838.72 - 4843.68] in this episode alone Ashley has been
[4841.40 - 4845.80] wildly dishonest about her wealth she
[4843.68 - 4848.12] said quote there's nothing crazy going
[4845.80 - 4850.00] on over here when she is in fact the
[4848.12 - 4854.32] daughter of a late multi-billionaire
[4850.00 - 4856.36] with cars and homes and planes all over
[4854.32 - 4858.60] the world world and she grew up in a
[4856.36 - 4861.56] mansion according to the Daily Beast
[4858.60 - 4863.00] next door to former US President George
[4861.56 - 4865.80] W
[4863.00 - 4868.08] bush just a good old humble nextdoor
[4865.80 - 4870.60] neighbor nothing crazy going on over
[4868.08 - 4872.76] here she lied about not having a private
[4870.60 - 4874.92] jet she lied about not having vacation
[4872.76 - 4877.48] homes she lied about not making money
[4874.92 - 4879.32] off of Instagram she lied about never
[4877.48 - 4880.08] having the intention to make money off
[4879.32 - 4883.24] of
[4880.08 - 4885.08] Instagram Ashley in fact had every
[4883.24 - 4887.76] intention to make money off off of her
[4885.08 - 4889.40] Instagram and also specifically to
[4887.76 - 4891.44] repeatedly make
[4889.40 - 4893.72] $240,000 off of the medical medium
[4891.44 - 4895.88] Community without dipping into her trust
[4893.72 - 4898.84] fund by doing Retreats two months out of
[4895.88 - 4901.36] the year plus to gain a whole lot more
[4898.84 - 4904.04] money and fame off of other Ventures she
[4901.36 - 4906.60] wanted you to set up for her Ashley lied
[4904.04 - 4908.60] about having No Agenda her agenda is
[4906.60 - 4911.16] Despicable and Crystal Clear for
[4908.60 - 4913.40] everyone to see Stephanie was sick for
[4911.16 - 4915.84] two whole years and despite Ashley
[4913.40 - 4917.80] having all of the means in the world the
[4915.84 - 4920.08] convenience of a private jet that even
[4917.80 - 4922.76] went directly to Pennsylvania where
[4920.08 - 4924.92] Stephanie lived and somehow the time to
[4922.76 - 4926.64] be able to travel for other purposes
[4924.92 - 4928.36] like to host Retreats that she was
[4926.64 - 4931.80] trying to make money off
[4928.36 - 4934.32] of Ashley did not visit Stephanie
[4931.80 - 4937.48] once what Ashley's doing is not about
[4934.32 - 4939.96] Stephanie Ashley has exploited and used
[4937.48 - 4942.28] Stephanie now along with multiple others
[4939.96 - 4944.04] as well and because her Twisted
[4942.28 - 4946.32] Stephanie story didn't do the damage she
[4944.04 - 4948.64] desperately wanted it to Ashley's now
[4946.32 - 4951.36] twisting and manipulating and spinning
[4948.64 - 4953.68] more stories whatever she can do to harm
[4951.36 - 4955.40] you and the community Ashley has a
[4953.68 - 4957.20] vendetta against you because she didn't
[4955.40 - 4959.72] get what she wanted from you that's
[4957.20 - 4962.36] clear she didn't get the success the
[4959.72 - 4964.60] fame The Retreat deal the book deal the
[4962.36 - 4967.20] followers or the positive documentary
[4964.60 - 4969.00] deal that she wanted and now that she
[4967.20 - 4971.04] didn't get what she wanted from you
[4969.00 - 4973.16] she's running a smear campaign against
[4971.04 - 4975.00] you and still out there obsessively now
[4973.16 - 4976.88] wanting to do a negative HIIT piece
[4975.00 - 4979.20] documentary about you so that she can
[4976.88 - 4981.88] become famous and successful that
[4979.20 - 4984.84] way this isn't some whistleblower who
[4981.88 - 4987.52] walked away because of Integrity Ashley
[4984.84 - 4989.44] is trying hard to convince her followers
[4987.52 - 4992.52] that she is such an honest and
[4989.44 - 4994.52] transparent person yet Ashley has not
[4992.52 - 4996.60] publicly disclosed the fact that she had
[4994.52 - 4999.80] every desire to make money and become
[4996.60 - 5001.92] somebody using medical medium Ashley has
[4999.80 - 5003.92] not disclosed the fact that she made all
[5001.92 - 5006.48] of these business proposals to Anthony
[5003.92 - 5008.00] and that she got turned down all right
[5006.48 - 5009.36] around the same time as what was
[5008.00 - 5012.08] happening with
[5009.36 - 5013.64] Stephanie Ashley has not disclosed that
[5012.08 - 5015.48] she was still marketing and trying to
[5013.64 - 5018.08] sell Retreats using medical medium
[5015.48 - 5021.16] information to the community for over a
[5018.08 - 5023.52] year after Stephanie passed away and all
[5021.16 - 5026.88] the way up until literal weeks before
[5023.52 - 5030.08] she came out with her false story about
[5026.88 - 5032.52] Stephanie it's hard to think that Ashley
[5030.08 - 5034.68] is this motive driven person when she's
[5032.52 - 5038.20] breastfeeding or acting like she's this
[5034.68 - 5040.80] welltoo authentic or honest Mom it's
[5038.20 - 5044.20] really a good cover like she's just a
[5040.80 - 5046.08] whistleblower to stop a mean man the
[5044.20 - 5049.16] story she's telling people never
[5046.08 - 5052.48] happened but a mom who seems so honest
[5049.16 - 5055.00] in every sense it can win somebody over
[5052.48 - 5057.28] it can win a journalist over it can win
[5055.00 - 5059.68] other people over especially people who
[5057.28 - 5062.60] are looking for reason and not like me
[5059.68 - 5065.96] her cloak in Disguise is this wholesome
[5062.60 - 5068.72] mother with seemingly so much wisdom who
[5065.96 - 5071.48] cares so deeply about the world from the
[5068.72 - 5074.52] outside raises her children with the
[5071.48 - 5077.52] best of values and then she seeks out
[5074.52 - 5080.76] journalists they see this she puts on
[5077.52 - 5083.16] this front how can she be wrong
[5080.76 - 5085.40] influencers who weren't friends of mine
[5083.16 - 5088.00] but were acquaintances she would
[5085.40 - 5091.32] befriend them purposely to try to sell
[5088.00 - 5093.64] them these stories that I'm a fraud and
[5091.32 - 5096.84] she's worked really hard at it for years
[5093.64 - 5099.40] now and in reality the truth she has a
[5096.84 - 5101.72] condition either born out of jealousy
[5099.40 - 5104.04] and hatred towards me or just a
[5101.72 - 5107.32] different illness where she just can't
[5104.04 - 5109.84] help but to lie and makeup stories as
[5107.32 - 5112.60] you'll learn in these episodes to come
[5109.84 - 5115.32] Ashley can't get anything right or
[5112.60 - 5118.60] anything straight not just her own
[5115.32 - 5121.24] madeup stories but factual worldly
[5118.60 - 5123.72] understandings that can actually be fact
[5121.24 - 5126.32] checked and she'll still be completely
[5123.72 - 5126.32] off the mark
[5126.60 - 5130.72] We've Only Just Begun exposing Ashley
[5128.72 - 5132.84] and her group so buckle your seat bels
[5130.72 - 5134.64] everybody and stay tuned for the next
[5132.84 - 5137.28] episode in this
[5134.64 - 5139.72] series as we are in the process of
[5137.28 - 5141.72] exposing Ashley and her organized
[5139.72 - 5144.16] hateful group for who and what they
[5141.72 - 5146.12] really are it's important to take note
[5144.16 - 5148.64] of their tactics and patterns that are
[5146.12 - 5151.08] likely to follow the plotters have a
[5148.64 - 5154.28] documented history of initiating attacks
[5151.08 - 5156.44] using lies and misinformation and then a
[5154.28 - 5159.52] on getting called out and corrected
[5156.44 - 5162.12] trying to flip it and play victim that
[5159.52 - 5164.72] is not going to work here all this group
[5162.12 - 5166.96] has done is spread verifiable lies and
[5164.72 - 5169.64] falsities they've carelessly attacked
[5166.96 - 5171.76] and harmed many innocent people they've
[5169.64 - 5173.52] used an exploited deceased individuals
[5171.76 - 5176.24] and others in the process of trying to
[5173.52 - 5178.80] get what they want they've repeatedly
[5176.24 - 5180.68] explicitly expressed the intent to harm
[5178.80 - 5182.40] medical medium and they've even
[5180.68 - 5184.68] deliberately tried to stop Anthony from
[5182.40 - 5187.32] doing a free event to support and raise
[5184.68 - 5189.48] money for the community we have every
[5187.32 - 5191.92] right to set the record straight and to
[5189.48 - 5193.84] defend the truth with facts and evidence
[5191.92 - 5195.40] and to defend the chronically ill
[5193.84 - 5198.24] against the malicious attacks of this
[5195.40 - 5201.72] group and we are going to continue to do
[5198.24 - 5204.44] so we expect the plotters to evade and
[5201.72 - 5206.32] ignore what they have done wrong we
[5204.44 - 5209.24] expect them to continue to lie and
[5206.32 - 5212.24] spread falsities we expect them to Pivot
[5209.24 - 5214.72] onto something new they'll make up and
[5212.24 - 5217.60] we expect them to skew and Al altered
[5214.72 - 5219.88] data and to hide critical pieces of
[5217.60 - 5222.84] evidence that undermines their entire
[5219.88 - 5225.76] campaign we also expect the plotters to
[5222.84 - 5227.96] fabricate explanations as they do
[5225.76 - 5230.92] everything they can to try to discredit
[5227.96 - 5234.52] what we're exposing them for having done
[5230.92 - 5236.88] and said in their own words but we are
[5234.52 - 5240.72] using their own text messages voice
[5236.88 - 5243.44] messages social media posts words that
[5240.72 - 5245.00] they spoke on recorded calls and other
[5243.44 - 5247.88] publish material
