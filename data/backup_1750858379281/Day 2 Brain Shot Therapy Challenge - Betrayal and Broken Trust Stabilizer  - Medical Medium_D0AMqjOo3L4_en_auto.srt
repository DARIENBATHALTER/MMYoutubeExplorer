trust stabilizer like why

55
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,920
is this in here I asked Spirit of

56
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,800
compassion

57
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,140
why do you want a betrayal and broken

58
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,640
trust stabilizer and it's very

59
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,200
compassion told me what I was sitting at

60
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,940
my desk and I was writing the

61
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:15,480
information down

62
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:18,900
which SOC said was people have these

63
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:20,340
wounds they get injured in the brain

64
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,739
from all kinds of different things

65
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:25,500
breakups relationship breaks up breakups

66
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:27,720
confrontations divorces all kinds of

67
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,700
other issues bad news all kinds of

68
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:32,700
stress all kinds of broken trust all

69
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:35,340
kinds of let downs and it compiles

70
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:37,379
inside the brain little injuries in the

71
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,120
blood vessels and we need to heal and

72
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:42,000
fix it and then the emotional wound

73
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,819
stays in there and it percolates and it

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,040
festers and it rots inside of us and

75
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:48,720
then we carry it on and we bring it on

76
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,120
that's what happens we bring it on to

77
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,459
other people too when we're injured and

78
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,440
we got those emotional injuries inside

79
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:58,080
our brain and it's not cleared it's not

80
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,659
lifted it's not healed

81
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,860
then we're actually holding on to those

82
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:03,599
wounds

83
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:05,760
and that's why so it's like okay

84
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:09,019
incredible this is going to be an

85
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:12,599
amazing brain shot therapy right here

86
00:04:09,019 --> 00:04:16,260
powerful brain shot therapy and one of

87
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:17,940
the most important so let's move on a

88
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,919
little bit here too let's go on to the

89
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:21,720
next little thing brain shot

90
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:24,180
therapy

91
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,940
so I'm in the book right now

92
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:29,040
medical medium brain shot therapy offers

93
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:31,919
instant relief

94
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,620
instant relief while it's actually

95
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,660
healing everything from deep within

96
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:38,340
within that issue like betrayal and

97
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,680
broken trust

98
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:43,560
they're designed to be highly absorbable

99
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:46,860
in the mouth this is incredible

100
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:49,199
so the brain shot therapies were created

101
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,400
to absorb quicker than anything else in

102
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,419
the mouth

103
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:56,820
so when they enter into your mouth

104
00:04:54,419 --> 00:05:01,080
they absorb faster

105
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:04,560
now if you had just spinach or a mango

106
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:07,979
by itself it would not do that what's

107
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:10,340
incredible about this it has to be the

108
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:15,419
mango the spinach

109
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:18,360
the celery the okay turmeric

110
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:20,340
the lime

111
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,500
in the ingredients and the levels that

112
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:26,520
they are in the order that they are

113
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:28,500
for that incredible power to kick in so

114
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,120
they absorb so quick when they enter the

115
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:32,340
mouth and what does that mean when it

116
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:35,460
absorbs so quickly when it enters the

117
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:38,639
mouth it goes to the brain fast it

118
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:40,919
drives to the brain so

119
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:44,280
I've tried this betrayal shot a few

120
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:46,020
times last week since I did it all my

121
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,780
symptoms started feeling better like

122
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:50,639
healing betrayals let me heal other

123
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:53,160
things too now that's incredible because

124
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:57,419
that's how it works

125
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:59,580
when you're clearing the house of injury

126
00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:01,740
that we don't know that's sitting in

127
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:04,680
here I mean it'll just sit in there for

128
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:07,380
years we live our life we've been hurt

129
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:10,199
and that resolve never really happened

130
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:12,300
inside here the result never really

131
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:14,039
happened inside the tissue it never

132
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:17,639
really happened inside the brain tissue

133
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:19,740
the soul all of it combined so it sits

134
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:22,020
with us and sits with us

135
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:25,020
and it just kind of percolates through

136
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:27,060
us and doesn't go away and we try a lot

137
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:29,280
of things to get it to go away

138
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:31,020
we do we try a lot of different stuff we

139
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,419
do the yoga and we do all kinds of other

140
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:36,240
things and we we exercise we do all

141
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:39,539
these things to try to get that to go

142
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,520
away we go on spiritual retreats

143
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:45,240
we do all these meditations right but

144
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:48,660
but we need also a real kicker a real

145
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,120
kicker something the boom really hit it

146
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,620
so that everything else you're doing

147
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:54,600
also helps so all the things that you're

148
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,400
doing your meditations

149
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,900
out there so many people doing different

150
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,280
meditations in the world all the things

151
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,960
you're trying your yoga whatever it is

152
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,419
your exercises everything that you're

153
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,940
doing your nature walks

154
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:08,220
everything that's helping with emotional

155
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:10,800
injuries of the past

156
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:14,940
are there to help but we want something

157
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:17,880
to slam that betrayal out of you kick it

158
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:19,800
so hard out of you activate that push to

159
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,479
get it out so that when you do all those

160
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,940
other things

161
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:26,940
healing happens

162
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:30,660
the adrenal fight or flight shot was so

163
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:32,340
calming things got very still I felt

164
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,500
that too when I took one it took one

165
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:37,319
recently I could see my thoughts going

166
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,880
by but was not attached to them that's

167
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:40,979
incredible the adrenal fight or flight

168
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,560
shot here's the thing about these brain

169
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:44,940
shots they're going to do a lot of

170
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,680
different things and you're going to

171
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:50,220
experience that

172
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:52,220
I was promised that from above when I

173
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:55,199
was put putting the information in here

174
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:57,000
and and I was like well this is going to

175
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,580
be incredible so that means that someone

176
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,440
who's doing this adrenal fight or flight

177
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:06,000
they're doing this brain shot this is

178
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:08,280
gonna happen as an SOC was just like yes

179
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,560
but you have to prepare them I'm like

180
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,960
what do you mean prepare them how can I

181
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,639
prepare them I don't I don't understand

182
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:16,680
well I remember sitting on my desk and

183
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,419
SOC said you have to prepare them you

184
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,879
have to foreword them

185
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:23,340
so they're not caught off guard because

186
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:26,220
they're that potent because people don't

187
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:28,919
get instant relief out there

188
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:32,700
and so when you get instant relief it's

189
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:35,760
like boom and so it's about being

190
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:37,740
prepared because when you do that expect

191
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,659
it to happen

192
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,339
it's important so you're not caught off

193
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:43,560
guard they're that powerful is what I

194
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:45,660
mean they're not powerful

195
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:47,820
and that's a big deal

196
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:50,040
here's a comment so excited for this one

197
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:52,260
try the negative energy exposure and

198
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,880
this effect was amazing I felt so calm

199
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:56,399
and happy first time in months when I

200
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,600
did the negative energy exposure I felt

201
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,640
tingles

202
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,860
tingles

203
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,779
that was the the it was a negative

204
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:06,000
energy that was releasing and leaving

205
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:07,620
tingles

206
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,160
here's a comment right here what happens

207
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:15,120
in the body with the shots is real

208
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:18,120
oh it's real oh it's real you can't

209
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,040
avoid it you can be somebody that's like

210
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:23,100
somebody that's just like no nothing's

211
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:25,560
gonna happen whatever you do the brain

212
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:28,440
shot therapy you sit down with it for a

213
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:30,360
second it's gonna happen

214
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,399
here's a comment I noticed an instant

215
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,440
feeling in my head after the day one

216
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:38,399
negative energy exposure shot that one

217
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:40,860
was so potent this is day two betrayal

218
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,019
and broken trust stabilizer

219
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:45,660
and I am

220
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:48,899
absolutely thrilled and excited about

221
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:51,899
this one because I know all of us

222
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:54,899
carry a little bit of hurt

223
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:56,220
some of us carry a lot of hurt some of

224
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:58,440
us carry

225
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:01,019
you know a moderate amount of hurt some

226
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:04,440
of us carry a little bit of hurt

227
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:07,260
some of us get exposed to problems that

228
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,959
come our way some of us had it years ago

229
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:13,440
here's a comment I cannot believe how

230
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:14,899
this works my husband and I both feel so

231
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,580
calm

232
00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:20,700
well that's the thing you don't even

233
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:23,700
have to believe there's people that

234
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:26,580
aren't believing that these can work and

235
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:29,760
they're trying them and they're like I

236
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:31,800
can't believe it I didn't think that was

237
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,300
going to happen or what's going on

238
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:37,320
here's a comment right here my brain

239
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:40,680
works so much better on these oh yeah

240
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,760
you don't have to be a believer and I've

241
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,080
said that about medical medium

242
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,399
information in the past you don't have

243
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,260
to believe it

244
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,880
do your celery juice and get rid of

245
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:49,980
those problems and start healing up all

246
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:52,260
those symptoms right you don't have to

247
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:54,839
believe in celery juice for it to work

248
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:56,399
because it works when it comes down to

249
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:58,140
these brain shot therapies you don't

250
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,839
have to believe

251
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:03,019
in the brain shot therapy just get ready

252
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:06,120
because it works

253
00:11:03,019 --> 00:11:08,880
and you can be the judge of it you can

254
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:12,899
be the judge of it they're really potent

255
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:16,019
they're really powerful but

256
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:18,600
get ready for the trolls

257
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:20,519
because that's what happens

258
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,320
get ready for the people that want to

259
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:25,079
stop the healing from happening in the

260
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,899
communities get ready for them because

261
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:30,000
they're going to be paid to pretend

262
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:31,320
they're doing the shot and pretend it

263
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,180
didn't work for them

264
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,120
let's get ready for that because that

265
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:38,459
will be on its way because this is

266
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,200
exploding out there

267
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:42,300
books are getting around the world

268
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,160
people are having life-changing results

269
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:48,660
from these brain shot therapies and what

270
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:50,399
that does is that creates a problem with

271
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:53,399
Darkness

272
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,399
companies

273
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,519
and what happens is then all of a sudden

274
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,320
the paid four stuff comes in like oh

275
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:07,560
those those didn't work those brain

276
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:10,380
shots for me and they never even try it

277
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:13,019
the 5G shot is amazing it's really

278
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:14,760
helping my whole family

279
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:17,279
incredible it's amazing comment right

280
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:21,300
there that's so good I love the 5G shot

281
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:24,140
for sure love it so what happens is if

282
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:27,120
whether you believe it or not if you do

283
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:29,839
administer these into your life you're

284
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:33,360
gonna feel them and they're gonna be

285
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:36,180
life-changing I was told that's how it

286
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,920
would work and it does it does it for

287
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:39,600
anybody I know who's using this and

288
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,240
everything else

289
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,920
all right so I mean

290
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,779
I talk a little bit about this the

291
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:49,399
medical medium brain shot therapy is

292
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:49,399
Uncharted Territory

293
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,839
never been done before

294
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,100
it doesn't matter what kind of alchemy

295
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:57,660
somebody thought they were mixing a

296
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:01,560
bunch of fruits and vegetables in some

297
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:03,660
shots or glasses or drinks this is an

298
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:06,000
entirely different situation it's

299
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:08,660
specifically for

300
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,639
these targeted areas

301
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:13,380
specifically for what someone's dealing

302
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:14,700
with with the right combinations but we

303
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:17,339
would never know what the right

304
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:20,160
combinations are I would never know in a

305
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:24,899
million years even if I was a guy that

306
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:27,240
was an avid juicer I was a juicing fan I

307
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:29,399
would never know what to put together it

308
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,260
would be impossible there's no food

309
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:33,300
science that would know there's no

310
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:35,579
science research that would know there's

311
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:37,860
no nutritionist that would know I would

312
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:40,500
never know no one would know what

313
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:43,500
exactly you need to put together just

314
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:46,019
right to make that happen so something

315
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,760
changes inside the brain it comes from

316
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:50,519
above it's the only place it could be

317
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:53,540
known for known from it's the only place

318
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:53,540
we can get that information

319
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:58,860
these are special

320
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:02,700
configurations synergistically combined

321
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:05,160
just right to crack the code

322
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:08,480
of how a fruit

323
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,480
an herb

324
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:16,560
have a fruit herb how a leafy green

325
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:19,579
how a wild food and vegetables can work

326
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,579
as medicine

327
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:24,600
while creative juices juice concoctions

328
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:26,399
are out there can make all the Creative

329
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,560
Juice concoctions we want we can put

330
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,000
together all these things it's not going

331
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,040
to do this

332
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,040
these brain shots

333
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:36,720
come from above the healing shots of

334
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,240
medical medium brain shot therapy are

335
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,040
tools that come from above these brain

336
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,320
shots are composed of specific

337
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:46,019
combinations of ingredients working

338
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:48,420
together systematically you guys for

339
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:51,180
specific reasons that only a source

340
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:54,240
above could know

341
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:57,120
the relationships among these

342
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,560
ingredients are intricate and unknown to

343
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,440
anyone

344
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,959
so the relationship that these have

345
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,339
together in all these brain shot

346
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:06,660
therapies there's 30 brain shot

347
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:08,339
therapies if you don't know the medical

348
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:10,560
medium books I'm reading right out of

349
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:13,740
brain saver if you don't have one go to

350
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:16,320
amazon.com us or wherever so there's 40

351
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:18,779
off right now at amazon.com us right now

352
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,240
get both the books they're both critical

353
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:23,040
they're both needed

354
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:25,079
can't just have one you have to have

355
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,360
both and the reason why they were all

356
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:30,120
one big book originally too big to

357
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:33,800
publish weighed 10 pounds they had to

358
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,800
cut it into two huge books

359
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:38,279
and that's the whole point so we got the

360
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,680
brain saver book and we got the brain

361
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:42,660
saver protocols right you have to have

362
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:44,399
both of them right there

363
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:47,480
and that's the whole point there were

364
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:49,680
one huge book like I just said the

365
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,600
relationships among these ingredients

366
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,600
are intricate and unknown to anyone

367
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:58,040
until now this knowledge from above

368
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,040
was untapped

369
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:02,100
this is one of the huge surprises out of

370
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:04,500
the brain saver books I wanted to

371
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:06,240
everybody to experience

372
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:09,720
but here's the thing

373
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,760
brain shot therapies build on

374
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,680
themselves

375
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,660
and man when you do the brain shot

376
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,639
therapy cleanses

377
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:19,260
there's seven different brain shot

378
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:21,300
therapy cleanses and that leads us to

379
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:23,519
the next part we're doing

380
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:26,519
the entry level

381
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:29,040
and we're doing a 10-day entry level

382
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:32,040
here's a comment I can feel it change

383
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:35,160
within myself that I just can't explain

384
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:37,560
I find myself looking at the trees

385
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:39,300
outside my window and feeling completely

386
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,519
connected

387
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:44,639
that's what happens when the brain shots

388
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,139
get to the brain when those the right

389
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,880
combinations

390
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:50,160
another comment I did the burnout

391
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:52,800
stabilizer one of my favorites because I

392
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:55,380
am trying to purposely burn myself to

393
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,000
the ground working 20 hours a day and

394
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:59,399
burning the candles before end I like

395
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,259
the burnout stabilizer too so I did the

396
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:03,180
burnout stabilizer this morning and I

397
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:04,679
felt tingling running through my brain

398
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:07,380
well that's the thing A lot of people

399
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:10,679
are going to feel that tingling I felt

400
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:12,959
the tingles going down my neck and my

401
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:14,939
spine on the negative energy exposure

402
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,160
shot

403
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:19,079
incredible it's incredible it feels like

404
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,280
electricity can't wait to try the next

405
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,600
one and that's another thing we're going

406
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,100
to talk about electricity a little bit

407
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,299
what happens with betrayal and broken

408
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:27,059
trust

409
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:29,460
so if we get betrayed or if we have

410
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:32,040
broken trust happen in our life we've

411
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:34,500
been let down something happens in the

412
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,700
brain it heats up the electricity goes

413
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,960
crazy

414
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,960
so we got to talk about that

415
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,860
so yeah so anyway

416
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:46,020
we're in the medical medium brand shot

417
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:47,520
therapy we're going to talk about the

418
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:49,799
levels so we're going to talk about the

419
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,240
entry level next in a little bit but

420
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:55,400
first first

421
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,400
we're gonna go to page 76.

422
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:02,299
I'm going to read a little bit about

423
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:02,299
what happens in our brain

424
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:08,700
as we go through life we come across

425
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:12,360
difficult situations betrayal loss

426
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:14,820
heartbreak loneliness confrontation

427
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:17,940
all of us experience these one way or

428
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:19,919
another somehow or some way in

429
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:22,500
boy is that true

430
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,900
we get emotionally hurt

431
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:27,059
if we don't recognize we've been

432
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:29,520
emotionally hurt it doesn't do Us

433
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:31,860
justice

434
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:34,740
we have to have that validation that

435
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:36,840
we've been emotionally hurt

436
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:38,880
and the physical aspect of this goes

437
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,380
wholly ignored and here's the most one

438
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,700
of the most incredible parts of what

439
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:43,620
we're talking about today and it's in

440
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:45,360
the brain saver books when we get

441
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:47,400
emotionally hurt

442
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,020
something happens physically to our

443
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,539
brain

444
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:55,020
that's completely ignored medical

445
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:57,380
research and science doesn't know

446
00:18:55,020 --> 00:19:00,240
other health books whatever don't know

447
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:03,620
we need to address the physical core

448
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,620
strength of the brain

449
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:08,880
so that no matter what we're

450
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,860
experiencing emotionally or what we're

451
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,660
thinking that inner core strength of our

452
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:14,340
brain can survive emotional injuries so

453
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:16,919
the point is you guys we're gonna always

454
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:18,780
have some kind of inconsistency in our

455
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:20,400
life and we're going to have some kind

456
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:22,679
of emotional blow whether it's mild

457
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,020
small small to somebody else bigger to

458
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:27,059
another whatever it is

459
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:28,620
baby just somebody else smaller to

460
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:31,200
another whatever it is we're gonna

461
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:34,320
always have something come our way

462
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:37,440
that's just life on planet Earth

463
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:39,419
and so but we can actually do some real

464
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,400
healing inside the brain strengthening

465
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:43,020
the core of the brain you strengthen the

466
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,059
core of the brain

467
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:46,919
then we have an entirely different story

468
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:48,600
going on then we can handle emotional

469
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:50,280
blows now we're talking about the

470
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,140
Betrayal and broken trust stabilizer

471
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:54,960
shot which is incredible that's one way

472
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:57,720
to really get down into it strengthen

473
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:01,880
the brain to help it heal from emotional

474
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,880
blows so we're less triggered as well

475
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:08,820
when we have loss or betrayal our

476
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:10,620
physical brain can become injured how do

477
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:13,080
you like that

478
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:15,419
what science research

479
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:18,900
what are best psychiatrists

480
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:20,880
would our best anybody in health and

481
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,679
wellness in the world

482
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,360
doesn't know

483
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:25,799
is that when we have any kind of

484
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:29,120
emotional blow something happens

485
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:31,740
physically inside our brain

486
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,840
so when something goes wrong and we're

487
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:35,700
betrayed our physical brain can become

488
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,320
injured especially if our brain doesn't

489
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:40,080
have what it needs and that's the

490
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:42,419
problem too we need to have what our

491
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,880
brain needs like we need the information

492
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:46,559
right we need the things we need for our

493
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,299
brain you guys this is exciting because

494
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,620
we're doing this betrayal shot I can't

495
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:51,679
wait I'm actually

496
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:54,600
I want to jump to it right away actually

497
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:56,520
part of what injures the brain is not

498
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:59,160
the broken trust itself so our trust

499
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:01,020
gets broken but that's not all that is

500
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:03,720
what it's about

501
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:07,440
it's the fire that occurs when an event

502
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:09,539
like this happens it's the fire

503
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,280
you get upset because we've been let

504
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:14,820
down and betrayed or some kind of broken

505
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:19,380
trust fire occurs in the brain our brain

506
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:21,059
ignites it lights up it gets hot

507
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:22,500
so if there was an old breakup

508
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:24,360
relationship if there was a

509
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:26,460
misunderstanding if we were upset about

510
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:28,980
something if somebody broke our trust or

511
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:31,799
let us down or whatever it is

512
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:34,740
there's a fire that just explodes inside

513
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:36,780
our brain and that fire is where we get

514
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:39,299
in trouble that fire is the heating up

515
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:42,179
of the brain an intense electrical heat

516
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:44,880
someone had something right two years

517
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:46,980
ago when they called somebody hot-headed

518
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,960
or blow off steam

519
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:51,360
300 years ago when they called somebody

520
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,520
hot-headed they had that right

521
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,600
that was one thing that actually had

522
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,780
right

523
00:21:54,600 --> 00:22:00,419
was we can get hot-headed or need to

524
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:03,840
blow off steam

525
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:05,460
not that someone needs to be angry for

526
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:08,580
this to happen so that's another Point

527
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:12,120
too you don't have to be angry

528
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:14,039
for the brain to just burn up in heat

529
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:16,020
the electricity of the brain you don't

530
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:18,600
have to be mad

531
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:22,020
you don't have to be angry you could be

532
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:24,539
quiet you can be peaceful looking you

533
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:28,919
can be laying in your bed but upset

534
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:30,780
internally you can be lying there upset

535
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:33,299
someone's looking at you and you're not

536
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:35,580
reacting you're just standing there or

537
00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:37,640
lying there in bed but inside you're

538
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:40,980
hurting and you're hurting deep inside

539
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:43,260
why did that person break up with me how

540
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:45,000
come it didn't work out what went wrong

541
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:47,520
with this other thing

542
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,100
and whatever it is that's happening in

543
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,200
your life any kind of letdown how come I

544
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:53,880
didn't how come they didn't accept me

545
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,400
into the school I wanted to go into

546
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:58,440
whatever it is how come I didn't get

547
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:01,440
that job how come I was fired whatever

548
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:03,059
it is when you're sitting down lying

549
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,940
down standing there whatever and you're

550
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:09,140
thinking about it you're burning hot and

551
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:09,140
that's just how it goes

552
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:13,860
sometimes we're not even showing emotion

553
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,720
and the fire within our brain Burns

554
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:18,539
hotter than ever you could be lying in

555
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:21,360
bed hurt by betrayal not expressing a

556
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:24,900
word hurt by a friend a friend could

557
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:26,820
have hurt you and someone who saw you

558
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,260
wouldn't even know you were burning up

559
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,760
inside

560
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:32,340
more

561
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:35,340
coming here because publicly known

562
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:38,159
medical research in science only knows a

563
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:39,659
tiny fraction about the brain

564
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,460
so that means research and science

565
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:44,159
really doesn't know a lot about how the

566
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:46,500
brain works

567
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,720
if by some miraculous chance the Earth

568
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:51,720
is still alive a thousand years from now

569
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,640
and not blown up and not

570
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:55,559
tor

571
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:58,500
and broken

572
00:23:55,559 --> 00:24:03,140
if the Earth actually exists and life is

573
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:03,140
on the earth a thousand years from now

574
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:09,720
we're still not going to know if the if

575
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:11,460
the Earth is just a rock that's dead

576
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:14,220
floating in space

577
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:15,780
no matter what we're still not gonna Not

578
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:17,280
Gonna Know science and research does not

579
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,780
have advanced enough information and

580
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,460
they never will about this what happens

581
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:23,159
when we get emotionally hurt and the

582
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:25,080
injuries that happen inside the brain

583
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:26,760
even though the overheating of our

584
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:29,220
physical brains can't be weighed or

585
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:32,159
measured it is just as real as the burn

586
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:35,280
you feel from touching a hot stove

587
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:37,320
it's as real as spilling hot coffee on

588
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:39,960
your lap it says real is walking

589
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:42,059
barefoot across scalding parking lot at

590
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,980
the beach this heating of the brain

591
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:46,260
occurs instantly when we experience an

592
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:47,340
emotional challenge of any kind what I'm

593
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,840
trying to tell you right here I'm

594
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:50,220
reading some information in here but

595
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:52,620
what I'm trying to say is the Betrayal

596
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:55,799
broken trust stabilizer

597
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:59,580
takes down the heat

598
00:24:55,799 --> 00:25:01,260
but it also helps to heal that betrayal

599
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:03,360
that happened to us

600
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:05,700
it helps to heal from any of those

601
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,860
emotional injuries that happen to us it

602
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:11,100
helps to heal the physical injury inside

603
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:13,740
the brain so when you take that brain

604
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:15,840
shot therapy all kinds of stuff can

605
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:17,159
happen and everybody can experience a

606
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,900
little bit of a different situation

607
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:20,820
because they may have been hurt

608
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:23,880
emotionally different than someone else

609
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:26,360
was hurt emotionally many years ago or

610
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,360
recently

611
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:32,760
so when we do this brain shot

612
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:35,400
this stabilizer

613
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:38,039
something can change

614
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:40,080
and it will first of all anything

615
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:42,539
percolating like old betrayal that's

616
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:47,340
been stuck inside the brain circulating

617
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:50,100
within the neurons can get blasted out

618
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:53,100
knocked out pushed out by the brain shot

619
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:55,440
therapy second any injuries that were

620
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:57,059
sustained along the way from any kind of

621
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,820
emotional hardship

622
00:25:57,059 --> 00:26:01,980
creating blood vessel damage

623
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:03,659
overheating of the neurons and nerves

624
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:05,039
inside the brain and the nerve cells and

625
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:07,980
the glial cells

626
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:10,320
can start to heal because there's

627
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:13,799
something within this combination nobody

628
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:16,559
ever knew existed

629
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:18,779
and in this combination

630
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:21,179
is the secret

631
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:24,559
to unlocking the Betrayal and broken

632
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:24,559
trust injuries

633
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:34,460
yeah

634
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,460
amazing

people struggling

656
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:33,419
there's a lot of toxicity

657
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:35,460
the onslaught of domestic chemical

658
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:37,860
warfare in our homes like the air

659
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:40,860
fresheners and the scented candles

660
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:42,900
and the cleaning agents and the

661
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:46,620
pesticides herbicides and the

662
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:49,440
insecticides all of that

663
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:52,020
it's all in our face every day

664
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,940
when you embark on these cleanse options

665
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:56,700
and we're doing level one and it's a

666
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:58,980
10-day cleanse

667
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:01,440
you're using your free will and your

668
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:05,220
intention to clean and project this

669
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:07,880
stuff out of your body that means that

670
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:11,159
if it's not if we're not just up against

671
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:14,940
actual physical chemicals we're also up

672
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:17,159
against betrayal and broken trust

673
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:20,400
we're up against that as well

674
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:22,620
that can Harbor inside of us just like a

675
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:25,500
toxic chemical can just like a heavy

676
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:26,700
metal can just like anything can inside

677
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,679
our brain

678
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:30,720
so we're going to be using the Betrayal

679
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:32,820
and broken trust stabilizer to propel

680
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,679
and rocket that out here's a comment yes

681
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:37,500
felt the tingle with the burnout shot

682
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:40,020
and a boost of extra energy

683
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:43,020
and with the negative energy exposure

684
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:44,640
shot I felt so happy that I called a

685
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:46,500
friend and we had a hilarious

686
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:49,679
conversation and you know when you have

687
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:51,299
that hilarious conversation that joy and

688
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:53,880
you're actually laughing and you feel

689
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:55,679
light-hearted the healing that happens

690
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:58,440
from that alone

691
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:01,919
so the negative energy exposure shot

692
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:03,179
was activating that joyous healing

693
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:06,179
inside

694
00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:08,279
it's really incredible

695
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:10,860
the brain shot therapy cleanses and

696
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:13,980
we're doing the entry level you guys

697
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:16,559
are Beyond just the physical

698
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:18,299
these are also metaphysical that's the

699
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:21,120
whole point

700
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:22,140
it's all about the soul it's all all

701
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:25,260
about

702
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:27,240
our emotional state mental state

703
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:30,120
here's a comment I got my life back

704
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:31,440
because of those shots they're truly a

705
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:33,240
miracle

706
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,880
Hal Bernadette

707
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:38,580
I am so happy that you got your life

708
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:40,919
back because of these shots

709
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:42,480
they're so potent they're that powerful

710
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:44,520
and they're miraculous I mean that's

711
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,020
what I'm telling my friends it's what

712
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:48,240
I'm telling people that are just opening

713
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:49,620
people that I know that they contact me

714
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,179
and they're like hey I just opened the

715
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:54,020
book I'm doing the brain shot and my

716
00:29:51,179 --> 00:29:54,020
life just changed

717
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:58,860
it's about the subconsciousness the

718
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:02,940
consciousness

719
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:05,820
our soul and our physical brain all of

720
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:07,799
that needs house cleaning and the brain

721
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:09,960
shot therapies help to house clinging

722
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:12,120
all of that

723
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,559
the brain shot therapies also help to

724
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:16,500
connect our subconsciousness

725
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:18,779
Consciousness to our physical brain

726
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:21,360
to our soul

727
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:22,980
so many people get disconnected

728
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,440
their subconsciousness and their

729
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:27,480
Consciousness completely disconnected

730
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:30,120
their soul and their subconsciousness

731
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:31,799
completely disconnected

732
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:34,799
their Consciousness and their physical

733
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:36,779
brain completely disconnected so people

734
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:38,159
walk around disconnecting what you're

735
00:30:36,779 --> 00:30:40,380
going to find when you're doing these

736
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:44,159
brain shot therapy cleanses is you're

737
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:45,840
going to find a connection happening

738
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:47,640
and you're gonna be like wait a minute

739
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,740
just like that comment I read earlier

740
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:51,539
when someone was saying they were

741
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:54,600
looking out their window I think right

742
00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:56,700
and they're looking at the trees

743
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,380
and feeling so connected

744
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:01,140
what happens is with the brain shot

745
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:03,840
therapy cleanses

746
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:07,020
and the brain shot therapy cleanses is

747
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:09,899
that in the shots they're connecting

748
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:12,539
pieces that are disconnected in US

749
00:31:09,899 --> 00:31:16,080
when our subconscious Consciousness is

750
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:18,779
too far from our consciousness

751
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:21,720
when our physical brain itself is

752
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:23,760
disconnected from our soul

753
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,440
when our soul is disconnected from her

754
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:28,380
consciousness

755
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,899
all this that's happening inside here

756
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:32,760
and so what the brain shots are doing is

757
00:31:30,899 --> 00:31:33,899
starting to actually bring it all

758
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:36,539
together

759
00:31:33,899 --> 00:31:39,120
and when that comes together

760
00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:41,279
these experiences happen

761
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:45,360
and you're you're actually witnessing

762
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:47,340
yourself what these experiences are like

763
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:50,039
here's the part that I was reading about

764
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:53,279
yesterday

765
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:55,559
these cleanses purify your brain Temple

766
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:57,360
so this is your temple right here

767
00:31:55,559 --> 00:32:00,500
I know that a lot of people say well my

768
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,500
body is my temple

769
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:06,380
my physical body is my temple that's the

770
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,380
temple

771
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,440
that's the temple

772
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:13,100
the temple is the place where the soul

773
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:13,100
resides

774
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:17,960
the true Temple is here

775
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:23,039
it's the brain because the true Temple

776
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:25,320
has the ghost in the machine the true

777
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:27,899
Temple has

778
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:31,380
the soul

779
00:32:27,899 --> 00:32:34,260
inside the physical brain

780
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:36,860
so you're purifying your temple your

781
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,860
brain Temple

782
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:40,500
here's the incredible part that I was

783
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:42,360
reading yesterday

784
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:45,059
you're intuitive

785
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:47,460
psychic telepathic Clairvoyant skills

786
00:32:45,059 --> 00:32:49,860
will start to surface

787
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:51,299
think about that for a minute

788
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:53,760
so when you're doing these brain shot

789
00:32:51,299 --> 00:32:56,520
therapy cleanses like the entry level

790
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:58,740
right now or 10 day cleanse or on day

791
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:01,279
two if you just got here

792
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:04,140
we're working on

793
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:06,600
surfacing your intuitive psychic

794
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:08,940
telepathic skills

795
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:12,419
your Clairvoyance skills that everybody

796
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:14,700
has inside of them everybody has the

797
00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:18,120
ability inside of them

798
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:19,799
but we're actually clearing the air

799
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:21,659
we're reading things that shouldn't be

800
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:23,700
in the brain we're also jump starting

801
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:24,960
the brain

802
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:28,500
and that's what these brain shot

803
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:30,899
therapies do they shock the brain

804
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:33,059
out of triggers

805
00:33:30,899 --> 00:33:35,760
pushing away things that shouldn't be

806
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:38,580
there reigniting and rewiring and here's

807
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:41,820
one of my favorite parts

808
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:44,159
these spiritual and physical cleanses

809
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:46,799
like the brain shot therapy

810
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:49,380
is rewiring

811
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:51,059
our brain

812
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:54,299
and that's another reason why people

813
00:33:51,059 --> 00:33:58,740
have profound experiences

814
00:33:54,299 --> 00:34:01,200
because of rewiring is happening

815
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:03,000
so there's multitude a multitude of

816
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,740
things in the process when you do these

817
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,539
brain shot therapies it's healing the

818
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:08,460
physical brain

819
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:11,339
it's healing the soul

820
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:13,080
metaphysical brain it's connecting the

821
00:34:11,339 --> 00:34:14,399
subconscious Consciousness and the

822
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:17,099
consciousness

823
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:17,940
it's rewiring and reconnecting

824
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:19,440
everything

825
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:22,320
and when you think about all that and

826
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:26,280
you put that all together

827
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:29,520
it's no wonder why they work

828
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:30,540
instant relief is happening and of

829
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,760
course you're doing the other medical

830
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:34,800
medium tools because you want to work on

831
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:37,440
other problems and you want to work

832
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,940
deeper into other areas

833
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,099
because the books have lots of

834
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:42,480
information in them but the brain shot

835
00:34:41,099 --> 00:34:45,359
Therapies

836
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:47,540
are profound and Powerful all on their

837
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:47,540
own

838
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,839
so let's head to the brain shot therapy

839
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:53,339

00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,359
water

884
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:08,520
because remember you're cleansing now

885
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:11,280
here's the thing don't put the water

886
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:13,800
right next to the brain shot

887
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,780
so when you do your brain shot

888
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,700
don't just guzzle some water it's like

889
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:19,200
here's my brain shot going down oh I'm

890
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:21,859
gonna drink a whole bunch of water now

891
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,859
don't do that

892
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:25,980
got to keep a light heart it's important

893
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:28,200
life is hard enough a little fun and

894
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:31,020
humor is always the way to go you guys

895
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:34,079
know it's important but here's the thing

896
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:38,359
don't do water with your shot don't

897
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:38,359
juice your shot and dump water in there

898
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:45,599
don't dilute this shot don't dilute the

899
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:48,839
medicine but you do need 50 ounces a

900
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:50,579
minimum of 50 ounces of water every day

901
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:52,980
when you're doing the brain shot therapy

902
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:55,619
cleanse now we're in the entry level

903
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:58,800
so back to this again we're drinking one

904
00:37:55,619 --> 00:38:02,160
shot per day but here's the thing

905
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:05,339
you can do two or three shots a day I'm

906
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:07,859
doing three shots a day yesterday I did

907
00:38:05,339 --> 00:38:09,420
three negative energy exposure shots you

908
00:38:07,859 --> 00:38:11,760
could do One A Day and that's fine

909
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:14,579
they're really powerful I did three and

910
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:17,040
I did them periodically through the day

911
00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:19,680
today I'm doing three betrayal and

912
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:21,900
broken truss stabilizer shots

913
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,760
and I'm gonna space them out I'm not

914
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:26,579
gonna do them like every 10 minutes and

915
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:29,760
send them down I'm gonna do one wait a

916
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:33,680
little while till later do another then

917
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,680
maybe at the end of the day do one more

918
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:41,880
try to wait 15 to 30 minutes before you

919
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:43,740
do something else like eat

920
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:46,200
so before you eat something so when you

921
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:48,900
do your brain shot stabilizer your brain

922
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:51,060
shot exposure your brain shot shifter

923
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:53,300
whichever one you choose out of 30 brain

924
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:53,300
shots

925
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:57,839
when you do it

926
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:59,579
don't just eat something like five

927
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:01,500
minutes later two minutes later don't

928
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:04,280
down a whole bunch of foods yet give it

929
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:06,720
some time try to give it 15 minutes

930
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:08,160
minimal there's more details in the book

931
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,599
and that's what's incredible about even

932
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,460
with children doing the brain shot

933
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:13,740
therapy too so you can get all the

934
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:15,540
details about children doing the brain

935
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:17,520
shot therapy

936
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:20,579
and in adults

937
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:23,359
and all the details around it

938
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:23,359
so we're doing

939
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:29,640
our shot so let's get ready for it here

940
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:31,619
I'm actually really excited you guys so

941
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:33,599
we're in the stabilizer shots these

942
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:34,440
brain shots are designed to stabilize

943
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:36,540
you

944
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:40,260
that's the whole point

945
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:41,700
it's about stabilizing it's about also

946
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:44,820
uprooting

947
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:47,700
and propelling out of you it's also

948
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:49,859
about rewiring so all these things

949
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:51,540
matter

950
00:39:49,859 --> 00:39:55,320
we're in the Betrayal and broken trust

951
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:58,500
stabilizer right there we're entry level

952
00:39:55,320 --> 00:40:01,260
it's 10 days we're on the second day

953
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:04,040
and we're getting ready to do it

954
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:04,040
so let's roll

955
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:12,260
so

956
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:12,260
I'm gonna get the juicer out right here

957
00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:17,040
I'm excited about this you guys got your

958
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:19,099
juicer

959
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:22,020
now you can use any juicer this is the

960
00:40:19,099 --> 00:40:24,480
mm1500 right here it's on sale it's 20

961
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:25,800
off right now

962
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,140
and we're going to be doing the Betrayal

963
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:30,420
and broken trust stabilizer shot

964
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:32,339
I have the juicer ready now what's

965
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:34,020
incredible about this juicer and it's

966
00:40:32,339 --> 00:40:35,760
why I like it it's not just that I work

967
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:38,160
with them I work with them because it

968
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:41,099
squeezes it has a compression it

969
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:42,839
squeezes as much juice that can possibly

970
00:40:41,099 --> 00:40:45,599
be squeezed and I can't find that with

971
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:48,300
other juicers so with the rising costs

972
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:51,720
of food this juicer actually saves me

973
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:53,640
money so every time I use it it's paying

974
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:55,140
for itself over and over again and

975
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:57,119
that's what I love about it and that

976
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:59,460
that right there that's one thing out of

977
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:03,060
a bunch of things I love about it so

978
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:05,640
it's about the dryer pulp in the basket

979
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:10,619
where it's so dry

980
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:12,960
and this is the mm1500 it's 20 off

981
00:41:10,619 --> 00:41:14,880
at Omega right you'll see the link in

982
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:17,960
the description so this is the one it's

983
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,960
the mm-1500

984
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:23,700
it's also really quiet if you don't want

985
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:25,500
a screaming loud juicer so I love it all

986
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:27,720
on its own for that

987
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:30,119
and there's also no the metal gear it

988
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:32,760
doesn't have metal gears rubbing against

989
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:34,500
each other like other juicers do where

990
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:36,000
they're grinding the metals rubbing

991
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:38,400
against each other

992
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,839
and so I thought I'd show you guys this

993
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,400
because it's the one I use everybody

994
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:43,440
asked me about a juicer or whatever

995
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,119
what's the best kind this is the one and

996
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:48,060
it's on sale right now so let's start

997
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:50,280
right up half inch

998
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:53,660
of turmeric going in here so I'm gonna

999
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:53,660
put a piece of turmeric in here

1000
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:59,760
excited

1001
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:00,910
all right next one is going to be frozen

1002
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,780
mango

1003
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:06,859
[Music]

1004
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:06,859
about a half a cup

1005
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:19,200
half a cup of Frozen mango now you can

1006
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:21,599
use fresh mango you're allowed to do

1007
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:23,520
that of course if I had a fresh mango I

1008
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:26,520
would be doing

1009
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:28,859
a fresh mango but the Frozen mango works

1010
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:31,560
really incredible it's

1011
00:42:28,859 --> 00:42:33,960
a great a great way of doing it I love

1012
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:35,339
Frozen mango personally

1013
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:37,560
put a little bit more I'm going to get

1014
00:42:35,339 --> 00:42:39,000
about a half a cup in here just grabbing

1015
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:42,079
some pieces

1016
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,079
that aren't so Frozen

1017
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:45,720
okay

1018
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:48,839
okay

1019
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:52,099
now I'm going to do a half a peeled lime

1020
00:42:48,839 --> 00:42:52,099
you guys have your lime

1021
00:42:55,560 --> 00:43:00,619
so I'm going to cut the slime in half I

1022
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,619
peeled it already

1023
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:05,780
there you go

1024
00:43:02,819 --> 00:43:05,780
now it's going to go in

1025
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:11,460
now I'm gonna go with a quarter cup

1026
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:14,040
of tightly packed spinach

1027
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:15,540
now the way of doing it in my hand where

1028
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,920
I can kind of measure it I've actually

1029
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:18,780
done this where I've done this in my

1030
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:20,520
hand then I put into measuring cup so I

1031
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:22,319
know exactly what I'm doing so I'm going

1032
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:26,000
with a quarter cup

1033
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:26,000
of tightly packed spinach

1034
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:32,700
if you had anything happening in your

1035
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,520
life any kind of Betrayal on any level

1036
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:38,099
even on the most mildest form

1037
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:40,020
like you sat on the phone

1038
00:43:38,099 --> 00:43:43,880
with the phone company waiting to get

1039
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:43,880
help and they disconnected you

1040
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:48,480
and you waited for two hours

1041
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:51,319
get the Betrayal broken trust shot out

1042
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,319
right away

1043
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:55,560
so we're doing a quarter cup of spinach

1044
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,570
in there and then a half a stock of

1045
00:43:55,560 --> 00:44:00,469
celery

1046
00:43:56,570 --> 00:44:00,469
[Music]

1047
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:11,540
okay here we go

1048
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:15,560
let that do its thing

1049
00:44:16,859 --> 00:44:22,560
and then we're gonna do a 16th of a

1050
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:25,079
teaspoon of cinnamon but the cinnamon is

1051
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:27,359
going to go into the juice when you mix

1052
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:29,339
it up at the egg so you don't want to

1053
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:31,440
put your cinnamon in here I mean you

1054
00:44:29,339 --> 00:44:32,760
probably could put it in your juicer

1055
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,020
right there but it's probably not the

1056
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:36,000
best way to go

1057
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:37,440
you could you really need to just put it

1058
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,859
in the container wherever your juice

1059
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:44,599
ended up and you put that 16th of

1060
00:44:40,859 --> 00:44:44,599
of a teaspoon of cinnamon in there

1061
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,760
all right

1062
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,400
I'm excited

1063
00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:01,020
so you got your little strainer and then

1064
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:02,940
we can do is kind of massage any

1065
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:04,680
leftover juice

1066
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:06,119
through the

1067
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:09,619
strainer

1068
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:09,619
whatever strainer that you have

1069
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:13,940
[Music]

1070
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:17,950
I'm like a little nervous because I've

1071
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:20,339
been betrayed

1072
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:22,020
[Music]

1073
00:45:20,339 --> 00:45:23,460
I know there's people that don't want to

1074
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:24,860
think they've been betrayed once in a

1075
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:26,099

1077
00:45:26,099 --> 00:45:30,119
and that's okay but it can still sit

1078
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:32,579
inside of them

1079
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:33,900
and wreak havoc and if we don't get it

1080
00:45:32,579 --> 00:45:36,900
out of us

1081
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:37,859
it can stay in there and then be like a

1082
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:41,400
silent

1083
00:45:37,859 --> 00:45:42,190

16th of a teaspoon

1088
00:45:55,079 --> 00:46:00,420

1089
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:02,160
with that broken trust those wounds we

1090
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:03,900

00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:14,280
somewhere somehow

1095
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,300

1096
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:17,520

I connect with it because I know what

1108

it's going to do and I already feel it I

1109

feel something kind of a sensation

1110
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:55,680

and right into your throat getting right

1121
00:47:25,859 --> 00:47:32,119
to the brain

1122
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:32,119
I feel it going to my forehead

1123
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:35,819

1124
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:37,140
so many things that have happened in my

1125
00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:40,640
life

00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:40,640

my publisher said we can't print it it's

1205
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:12,540
too big it would be 10 pounds they had

1206
00:51:10,619 --> 00:51:15,839
to be broken into two massive books

1207
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:18,059
they're packed with information

1208
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:20,400

I don't know I mean

1216
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:43,619
I I believe that even if like the worst

1217
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,839

1218
00:51:43,619 --> 00:51:47,940

00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:54,900

with a huge healing release I that's I

1224
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:01,800

1225
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:05,540
I already cried does that make any sense

1226
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:05,540
Michelle says such a release

1227
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:09,480
Rachel Clark says I just want to hug

1228
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:11,339
myself

1229

Suzanne says

1230
00:52:11,339 --> 00:52:16,140
I am with chills in my entire body ready

1231
00:52:14,099 --> 00:52:18,480
for another shot

1232
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:20,280
I'm doing three of these shots today is

1233
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:22,440
what I'm doing I'm doing three of them

1234
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:23,350
I'm gonna do one leader and then one

1235
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,660
later on

1236
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:27,059
[Music]

1237
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:28,859
Sharon says I've been doing the advanced

1238
00:52:27,059 --> 00:52:31,380
cleanse with three shots a day and

1239
00:52:28,859 --> 00:52:34,380
experience profound Clarity do you guys

1240
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:37,680
have the mm1500 it's 20 off right now

1241
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:41,220
which is unbelievable it's the mm-1500

1242
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:43,680
it squeezes all the juice out of the

1243
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:45,839
ingredients so that you save money and

1244
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:47,940
you're not buying double the celery

1245
00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:49,740
double the spinach double the turmeric

1246
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:51,900
double the kit whatever it is that's

1247
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:54,119
going to be in these double the mango

1248
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:55,680
you're not buying double and having to

1249
00:52:54,119 --> 00:52:57,780
run double through to get that much

1250
00:52:55,680 --> 00:53:00,780
juice like all the other juicers

1251
00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:03,420
this is the juicer that actually saves

1252
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:05,579
the community money if you guys are

1253
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:07,619
juicing and doing this it saves me money

1254
00:53:05,579 --> 00:53:10,079
because it pays for itself over and over

1255
00:53:07,619 --> 00:53:12,059
again because of that very squeezing

1256
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:14,040
method that's in there

1257
00:53:12,059 --> 00:53:17,579
anyway just thought I'd tell you so you

1258
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:20,280
know Mildred said what's in this shot

1259
00:53:17,579 --> 00:53:22,319
that makes me want to dance

1260
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:24,599
that's the thing you're unique and

1261
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:26,460
everybody might have a unique experience

1262
00:53:24,599 --> 00:53:28,680
with these brain shot therapies keep

1263
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:30,119
that in mind because you're unique and

1264
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:32,099
what has happened to you in your life or

1265
00:53:30,119 --> 00:53:33,839
what you're going through is unique so

1266
00:53:32,099 --> 00:53:35,400
experience different things like I'm

1267
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:37,740
experiencing this thing where I thought

1268
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:39,780
I just cried for an hour but I didn't

1269
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:41,579
but yet it feels like that and my eyes

1270
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:42,720
are kind of like welled up as if I did

1271
00:53:41,579 --> 00:53:45,599
cry

1272
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:47,760
and I feel this light-heartedness but at

1273
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:49,319
the same time like something left that

1274
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,960
shouldn't have been there

1275
00:53:49,319 --> 00:53:54,660
Karen says wow that shot is crazy good I

1276
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:57,059
wasn't expecting anything to happen my

1277
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:59,520
eyes started to almost water that's the

1278
00:53:57,059 --> 00:54:02,520
whole point like I cried I felt tingling

1279
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:03,900
in my mouth of all places I feel great

1280
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:05,400
now and what you're going to notice with

1281
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:07,319
the brain shot therapies many of them

1282
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:10,079
are going to create this this tingling

1283
00:54:07,319 --> 00:54:12,300
this mysterious tingling of healing

1284
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:14,099
because you're rewiring the rewiring is

1285
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:16,680
happening inside your brain

1286
00:54:14,099 --> 00:54:19,500
so keep that in mind

1287
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:21,599
and and one thing like Karen said I

1288
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:22,920
wasn't expecting anything to happen well

1289
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:25,140
that's why I was trying to forewarn

1290
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:26,760
everybody because people are not going

1291
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:28,319
to expect an instant result but you're

1292
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:30,599
going to get an instant result from the

1293
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:33,420
brain shot therapies I have to forewarn

1294
00:54:30,599 --> 00:54:36,000
you I don't want you caught off guard

1295
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:38,040
