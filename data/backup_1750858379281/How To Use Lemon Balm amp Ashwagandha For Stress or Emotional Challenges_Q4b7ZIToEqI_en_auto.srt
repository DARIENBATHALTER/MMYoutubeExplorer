1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,420
happens every day every time I talk to a

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:07,980
friend or somebody I know or anyone it's

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,980
like they've gone through something

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,599
whether it's Mercury retrograde causing

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,040
problems whether it's

6
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:15,780
something happening in their family

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,980
their personal life their work

8
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:21,060
relationships any kind of friendships

9
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:23,699
something's always happening and if it's

10
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:26,460
not that it's something else and I hear

11
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:28,320
it all the time out there it's like not

12
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,660
only do people have to deal with

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,899
different struggles different emotional

14
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,360
hardships trust issues right so many

15
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:37,860
people carry these trust issues because

16
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,440
they've been wronged

17
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:43,020
and betrayed that happens out there all

18
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,420
the time and people will be like what do

19
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,920
you do what do you do you know I'm so

20
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,660
stressed out when it's crazy how

21
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,239
stressed out I am and I'm like lemon

22
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:54,980
balm I have to say it like a zillion

23
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:57,719
times I think I've said it a billion

24
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:58,860
trillion times in the last whatever

25
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:02,460
years

26
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:06,000
and it's like really lemon balm like

27
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,979
yeah lemon balm so you almost can't even

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,439
you almost can't even say it one

29
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:14,040
trillion more times but that's what I

30
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:16,380
use myself all the time right and I find

31
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,380
so much peace in it because you can when

32
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:22,680
it's a good lemon balm you can feel it

33
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:24,900
like I mean you feel it right away and

34
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,659
there's a huge difference so that's the

35
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:30,600
beverage you guys know I backed these

36
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:33,780
guys 100 with my endorsement I stand

37
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,560
behind this company because I'll tell

38
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,740
you

39
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,119
dispose my mind is that

40
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,540
there's never going to be something

41
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,280
hidden in here and by law supplement

42
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,520
companies are allowed to hide a small

43
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,200
percentage of ingredients they don't put

44
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,720
on the bottle

45
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,899
and that's what they almost all do out

46
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,939
there and this company says uh-uh it

47
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:58,920
ain't gonna happen we're never sticking

48
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:01,380
something hidden in these and then

49
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,500
they're third independently tested the

50
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:07,020
quality is off the chart so what they do

51
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,360
is they go for the highest quality tier

52
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,640
so if you started a supplement company

53
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,160
tomorrow and you said hey I want to do

54
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,860
like whack-a-mole supplements or

55
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,780
something or I want to do like you know

56
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:21,480
greatest supplements on the planet

57
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,040
company and you want to start one

58
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,420
what's going to happen is you're going

59
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,060
to look at all these options with

60
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:30,120
suppliers and you're going to find oh

61
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:32,640
here's our this is good quality but it's

62
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:36,120
going to be still at the bottom tier

63
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,640
right to go to the highest tier highest

64
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,160
quality of lemon balm or the highest

65
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,080
quality of ashwagandha or the highest

66
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,760
quality propolis which is incredible

67
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,580
from Memphis right

68
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:50,040
you like Bemidji only goes to the

69
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,599
highest where they're like you are the

70
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,060
only ones

71
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,700
like sourcing this out you are the only

72
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:59,160
ones asking for this the highest quality

73
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:01,760
and it's incredible and these are the

74
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:04,019
differences so it's those very things

75
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,260
and so anyway

76
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:09,000
stress which I'm under a lot right I

77
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:12,659
mean you guys know

78
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,879
you guys know right it's a Lemon Ball

79
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:16,560
that's what gets me through like that's

80
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,360
one of the things that gets me through

81
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,620
and you may be under like another kind

82
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,200
of stress or a different kind of stress

83
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:24,720
something different and

84
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:28,680
and so yeah I mean I recommend lemon

85
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:31,140
balm for like anything like it's a nerve

86
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,879
Vine it's good for the nerves all of

87
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:35,640
that and then you got the ashwagandha so

88
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,319
I like these two both of these together

89
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,060
you can have them together you can have

90
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:42,239
them separate at different times

91
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:44,940
but I like them together as well right

92
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,379
so there's the ashwagandha ashwagandha

93
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:48,659
is popular out there

94
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:51,659
a lot of people take ashwagandha

95
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:52,860
but until you've taken the best do you

96
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:55,379
realize

97
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:57,000
what ashwagandha really is and that's a

98
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:59,400
whole leather that's a whole nother

99
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,140
thing anyway any kind of stress and

100
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,900
people go through so many emotional

101
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:06,060
hardships and maybe their adrenaline is

102
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,459
just off the chart because you're going

103
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:11,459
through something maybe they're just

104
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:13,500
dealing with any kind of thing that's

105
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:15,780
you know where you need something for

106
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,400
