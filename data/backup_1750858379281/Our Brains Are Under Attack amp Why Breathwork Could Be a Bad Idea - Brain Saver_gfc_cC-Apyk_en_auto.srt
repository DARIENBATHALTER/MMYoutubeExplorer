1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:06,960
our brains are under attack

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:08,400
our brains are under attack

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,200
that's what's happening I want to read a

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,900
quote we're doing the brain saver books

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:16,080
right here you guys check this out

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:19,260
if you're someone who wakes up in the

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,600
morning and shakes their head wondering

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:24,660
why there's a lack of answers out there

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,880
for the chronically suffering

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:30,380
now you understand why because you've

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,380
read the brand saver books

12
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,300
you're learning the answers you're

13
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,399
learning the truth so you can do

14
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,200
something about your health and your

15
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,719
family's health because your family's

16
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:46,440
health is critical it's important by

17
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:49,200
knowing what that critical truth is that

18
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,780
for one toxic heavy metals are

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,440
saturating our brains and we can remove

20
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:58,860
them to enjoy a better quality of life

21
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:02,640
we supersede the machine

22
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:05,640
We rise above the so-called authority of

23
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,680
our well-being so that well-being is in

24
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,580
our own hands

25
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,020
We rise above the machine

26
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,640
so I want to talk a little bit about

27
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,140
some we're in the brain saver books you

28
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,560
guys and we'll pop these down right here

29
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,560
really quick

30
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,580
so I'm in a section right here chapter

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,380
15 The Brain saver book both of these

32
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,939
brain saver books are just absolutely

33
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,860
phenomenal

34
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:30,299
packed with information you guys know

35
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,280
and you've got the brain shot therapies

36
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:34,140
and everything else this section is

37
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,579
called evolving backwards and I was

38
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,200
talking a little bit about our brain and

39
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:39,900
our immune system earlier before right

40
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,220
but now I'm talking about a couple of

41
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,220
other things so let's go into it a

42
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:46,740
little bit we think humans are evolving

43
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:49,920
and advancing right we think humans are

44
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:52,200
advancing and evolving

45
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,899
we know that's not true

46
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,299
what's really evolving are the toxic

47
00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:00,119
chemicals we're exposed to

48
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:03,000
the EMF were exposed to that's what's

49
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:06,659
evolving we're up against the pathogens

50
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,399
we're exposed to that's what's evolving

51
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:11,879
we're up against

52
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:14,879
brain betrayers our brain becomes

53
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:17,400
betrayed designed by Industries to

54
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,540
supposedly make our lives better so they

55
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,660
say they're trying to make our lives

56
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:23,760
better but yet they betray us we confuse

57
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:26,340
the long-standing theory that humankind

58
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,739
is evolving with the advancements in

59
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,000
technology that we see all around us so

60
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:31,560
we're thinking there's so much

61
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,840
technology I'm here talking to you

62
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,520
because of technology technology means

63
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,920
whoa technology is advancing then

64
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,660
everything's advancing that we're but

65
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,980
we're getting more chronically ill and

66
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,260
chronically sick that's what's

67
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:45,360
incredible about it all we see

68
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:48,360
advancements in life-saving surgical

69
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,700
medicine too right advancements in how

70
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,400
far we can reach into space with our

71
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:55,620
telescope whoa that's all technology it

72
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,379
gives us the misperception that

73
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:03,000
humankind is getting ahead by Leaps and

74
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:05,640
Bounds in some ways that we may be true

75
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,500
some ways that may be true when it comes

76
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,239
to technology

77
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,220
but what about our physical brain so

78
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:12,959
let's go into that what about our

79
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:15,540
physical brains and bodies what about

80
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,519
the physical existence of humankind is

81
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,920
that evolving

82
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,120
just want to ask you like is humankind

83
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,879
evolving

84
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,159
life expectancy will decrease did you

85
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:27,720
know I was the only oh my God I hate

86
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,400
saying this

87
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,260
I was the only one that said it was

88
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,180
decreasing all these decades

89
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,920
and they're like no life expectancy is

90
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,780
better than ever it's better than ever

91
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,580
all the clinics are saying so medical

92
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,319
research and science is saying life

93
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,640
expectancy is incredible it's only

94
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,140
getting better and I was like no it's

95
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:46,680
not they're just not telling anybody

96
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:50,159
they're not telling anybody that

97
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:54,180
actually it's not

98
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:57,480
it was decreasing all along and now it

99
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:59,280
is decreasing it has dropped it's out

100
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,040
there it has dropped

101
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:05,459
life expectancy will decrease at a

102
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:08,060
gradual Pace during this decade and then

103
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:10,980
life expectancy will decrease at an

104
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:12,840
unprecedental drastic Pace over the next

105
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:14,280
decade and Beyond what's going to happen

106
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,420
here and reading on the brain saver

107
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,479
books

108
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:20,760
life expectancy I hate being kind of a

109
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,280
bummer

110
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,840
but after 10 years it's gonna

111
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:30,080
decrease

112
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:30,080
at a drastic Pace a drastic pace

113
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,120
over the next decade and Beyond at

114
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:38,100
drastic Pace already The New Normal is

115
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,979

Eating Disorders whatever it is they

125
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:08,820
have a symptom

126
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:11,639
virtually every human being on the

127
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:13,560
planet experiences at least one symptom

128
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:16,320
at

129
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,300
this point where we stand right now in

130
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,979
history so right now in history at this

131
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:22,080
point every single human being on the

132
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:24,380
planet does experience at least one

133
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,380
symptom

134
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,620
there are different levels from very

135
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,199
mild to devastatingly severe symptoms

136
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:33,240
you guys know about that there's The Not

137
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,979
So Sick group those who are experiencing

138
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,660
symptoms and still functioning you see

139
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:38,460
them out there they're all at the stores

140
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,960
they're filing into the drug stores

141
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,580
they're in the grocery store you think

142
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,020
everybody is fine and dandy in the

143
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:46,380
grocery store everybody's got a symptom

144
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:48,419
I know so they all have a symptom or or

145
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:50,940
more

146
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:52,380
those who are experiencing symptoms and

147
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:54,479
still functioning working being

148
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:56,520
productive even playing all day if they

149
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,900
have that privilege of playing all day

150
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,759
there's people out there that have the

151
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,440
privilege of playing all day

152
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,660
they could play play play it doesn't

153
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:07,020
matter they could be big trust funders

154
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:08,940
they can play so either way they still

155
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:11,699
have a symptom then there's the sick

156
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:14,340
group those who are frightfully ill out

157
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:15,900
there those for whom each day is about

158
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,699
surviving then there's a people there's

159
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,020
people that are really struggling and

160
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:20,100
suffering and they're just trying to

161
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:22,199
survive

162
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,419
this increase in sickness like never

163
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:27,720
before is only going to keep developing

164
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:29,400
over time in the next 10 years in this

165
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:32,120
10 years here worse than the next 10

166
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,120
years drastic

167
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,600
so are we evolving in that in the right

168
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,479
direction or backwards that's the

169
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:41,520
question right here the book's asking

170
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:43,979
are our physical bodies any different

171
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,620
than they were in ancient Rome 2500

172
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:48,840
years ago and if you believe that we

173
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,699
have evolved since then are we evolving

174
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,979
faster than what's evolving around us

175
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:55,560
now that's destroying us

176
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:57,419
so we're up against so much

177
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,460
toxins more than ever before the

178
00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:01,319
pathogens more than ever before heavy

179
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:04,199
metals more than ever before

180
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:07,259
and the list goes on we need to be aware

181
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:09,360
that we are going backwards not forwards

182
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:11,639
but nobody cares

183
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:16,100
you guys do with their physical health

184
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:16,100
in the next one to five years

185
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,639
we're going to see chronic illness rise

186
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,440
to levels no one could ever imagine so

187
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,780
in the next one to five years we're

188
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:28,080
going to see chronic illness rise to a

189
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:29,699

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,900
about that about them being so heavy and

194
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:42,440
everything I'm going to bring this over

195
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,440
a little bit

196
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:50,220
so and that's because instead of our

197
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:52,319
bodies advancing everything wrong about

198
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,720
the world is evolving

199
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,220

00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,440
environmental pollution is involved is

becoming bigger the chemical industry is

204
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:07,080
evolving creating new chemical soups by

205
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:09,180
the hour Around the World Around the

206
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,979
Clock the pharmaceutical industry is

207
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,780
evolving even overreaching and

208
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:14,819
controlling the nutraceutical industry

209
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:17,360
and not always evolving in our best

210
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:17,360
interests

211
00:08:17,419 --> 00:08:21,240
pathogens are evolving more and more new

212
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:23,220
strains of pathogens that have been

213
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,900
released from Labs over the last hundred

214
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,819
years and keep people sick with chronic

215
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,680
illness or mutating and strengthening as

216
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:30,780
we pass those pathogens around to each

217
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,760
other whether through our family line or

218
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:36,060
any other means of exposure

219
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:38,880
everything's evolving around us

220
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:41,279
but the industry is in and the world of

221
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,719
health is not saying hey hey we have to

222
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,919
do something about it we got to protect

223
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,779
our brain

224
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,480
we have to take care of our brain we

225
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:50,279
have to look out for our health not

226
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,899
doing that instead it's all gimmicky

227
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:54,000
trendy stuff it's like take your

228
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:56,459
Omega-3s make sure you do your

229
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,040
probiotics

230
00:08:56,459 --> 00:09:02,640
make sure you make sure you take your

231
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:05,519
vitamin D right and it's all about that

232
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:08,040
and it's not it's not medicine is not

233
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,540
evolving enough to keep up with

234
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,700
everything that's why there's hundreds

235
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,860
of symptoms with no answers and there's

236
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:16,260
hundreds of symptoms where people are

237
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:18,899
struggling and suffering and it's like

238
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:20,820
the lotto in a way to get some relief

239
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:23,100
out there maybe you'll get relief for a

240
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:25,500
second maybe you won't

241
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:28,140
that's very difficult

242
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:31,080
so the world of sicknesses is getting

243
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:33,540
worse the the attack on our brains is

244
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:36,120
evolving but our brains are not evolving

245
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:38,279
enough to override the attack so we need

246
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,760
help and support the brain saver books

247
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:40,760

345
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:26,339
so I just want to give you that

346
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:28,620
forewarning if you just got here it's

347
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:30,779
the first live view caught talking about

348
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:33,060
brain saver the brain shot therapies are

349
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:34,200
quick acting fast acting for quick

350
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,940
relief

351
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,339
but they're intense and you'll

352
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:41,040
experience that now people are not used

353
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:42,480
to immediate relief in alternative

354
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,240
medicine

355
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,459
it's really really rare

356
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,740
and medical meeting books creates this

357
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:51,600
situation where you heal and you get

358
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:53,339
relief where you get relief and heal but

359
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,839
the brain shot therapies are even more

360
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:57,959
intense

361
00:13:54,839 --> 00:14:00,839
and so when you do experience them this

362
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:03,120
one's a trauma shock and loss stabilizer

363
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:05,639
when you do experience them I don't want

364
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:09,180
you caught off guard

365
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:11,220
because you're gonna feel it when you

366
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:13,139
actually use these brain shot therapies

367
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:16,139
so I just don't want you caught totally

368
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:19,940
off guard I want you to be just

369
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:19,940
in The Knowing of what's Happening

370
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:24,779
so Allison has question extractor is

371
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:27,120

372
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:29,220
smoothie no it's not better than the

373
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,320

someone else may not need the extractor

380
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:45,420
somebody else can use the extractor what

381
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:49,260

can also do the advanced heavy metal

398
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:30,060
detox movie and then the seven levels of

399
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:32,880
heavy metal detox where there's other

400
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:36,480
things to do that are recommended in

401
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:39,779
that level so it's really comprehensive

402
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:42,120
and you can find your way and find what

403
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:43,800
feels and works best for you

404
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,720
because you're different than another

405
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:48,060
person and why are you different because

406
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,500
you have different things going on so

407
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:52,139
there's something called the nerve gut

time speaking their truth and they're

00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:52,920
the dream shifter that's incredible all

434
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,199
on its own so I don't know if you guys

435
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:57,540
keep track of your dreams if your dreams

436
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:59,579
mean anything to you A lot of people

437
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:01,199
don't dream and then there's a lot of

438
00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:02,220
people who have nightmares and a lot of

439
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,860
people that

440
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:06,860
wish they had better dreams and there's

441
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:10,319
also people that want to find messages

442
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:13,500
in their dreams too there's also people

443
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:15,179
that want to be reached by loved ones in

444
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,140
their dreams they want to be reached by

445
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:18,600
people

446
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:20,339
in their dreams too they want to connect

447
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,679
spiritually in their dreams their dreams

448
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:25,799
mean a lot because dreams do mean a lot

449
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:27,780
for sure so this is the dream shifter

450
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:29,160
I recommend trying the dream shifter

451
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:32,100
someday

452
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:35,039
because get ready for that

453
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:37,380
I mean that's a really that's a really

454
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:39,660
incredible one all in its own

455
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:43,320
so there's over there's sorry there's 30

456
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:45,360
brain shots but there's seven brain shot

457
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:47,520
therapy cleanses

458
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,960
so the craving shifter I know so many of

459
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,280
you struggled now we're going into the

460
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,600
holidays and I want to talk about this

461
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:54,000
for a little bit we're heading into the

462
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,840
holidays got the Halloween candy coming

463
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,480
up

464
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,980
and then we got Thanksgiving coming up

465
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:02,700
depending on where you are in the world

466
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:04,380
and such and then you got Christmas

467
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:07,260
coming up

468
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:09,539
and then you know so either way

469
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:11,039
the holidays are on and then New Year's

470
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:14,039
right you got the new year so you got

471
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:16,320
the holidays coming up for everybody

472
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:17,640
and there's a bunch of holidays I

473
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,020
haven't even mentioned that I haven't

474
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,600
got the chance but the point is is

475
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:24,840
there's holidays all over the world

476
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:27,720
everywhere and what happens is we end up

477
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:29,940
having like craving problems

478
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:32,100
so we end up like eating whatever we can

479
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,840
like Cake's cookie Donuts whatever it is

480
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,039
or overeating or eating things that

481
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,539
we're not supposed to eating so much

482
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:39,059
especially for struggling we're

483
00:18:36,539 --> 00:18:40,380
chronically sick and we know we're maybe

484
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:42,720
not supposed to eat certain things

485
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:44,460
because we've learned but the craving

486
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,380
shifter is something that I recommend

487
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:48,000
for the holidays so that alone is

488
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:53,160
incredible in the book and the Brain

489
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:55,380
saver books is the craving shifter

490
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:57,900
I mean be the judge of that one try that

491
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:59,700
one and whoa you know

492
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:02,640
a friend of mine right now is doing that

493
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:05,400
one like on and off all day now a lot of

494
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,559
people have food fear

495
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,600
they've developed it along the way they

496
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:12,419
have food fear for a lot of reasons so

497
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,340
maybe Eating Disorders or food fear that

498
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:16,140
one right there is something that you

499
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:17,940
might want to try if you're a food for

500
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:20,520
your kind of you know like if you're in

501
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:22,140
that zone where you're kind of stuck

502
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:24,539
a lot of people need their energy

503
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:26,820
shifted

504
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:28,320
so it's not just about fatigue that's a

505
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,640
whole other thing too you could use it

506
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,860
for that but the point is this energy

507
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,720
shifter that's a great one too so it

508
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:35,520
says at the midpoint of a long day when

509
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,200
you're desperate for an energy boost you

510
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,020
know that like long name it's hitting

511
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,880
you or when you feel unbalanced as if

512
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:43,620
you don't have enough energy the energy

513
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:46,380
shifter is good for that if you're

514
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:49,020
feeling that your energy is off

515
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:50,340
then you're not on point right or

516
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:52,140
someone says something to you and you're

517
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:54,539
like why are you like you are right now

518
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:56,880
like what's going on are you okay are

519
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:58,860
you okay do the energy shifter if you

520
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,620
feel like you have too much energy and

521
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:04,500
you're hoping to calm down and you know

522
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:06,059
kind of like de-escalate right so

523
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,460
there's that thing too where you're just

524
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:10,140
like the the energy is like going going

525
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:11,820
but then you're gonna burn out so you

526
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:15,179
might want the energy shifter so you can

527
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:18,780
like burn it just right so you don't

528
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:21,900
just blow all your energy in one shot

529
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:23,760
if you're removing caffeine from your

530
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,960
life do the energy shifter so that's one

531
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,400
right there so if you're trying to get

532
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,720
rid of the caffeine trying to break the

533
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,340
coffee addiction you're trying to break

534
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,539
the cacao addiction the chocolate

535
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:32,700
addiction

536
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:34,980
when you want to wind down at the end of

537
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,900
the day so you can recalibrate because

538
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,220
you come home or you're it's the end of

539
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:40,740
the day and you're already home but

540
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:42,120
you're feeling really weird so it's the

541
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:44,640
end of the day you feel kind of like

542
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:47,340
confused or lost or you're not kind of

543
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,780
feeling quite right or your Energy's low

544
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:51,059
at the end of the day you want to

545
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:53,520
recalibrate before the night moves on

546
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:55,679
that's another time to use it

547
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:58,260
the energy shifter is also ideal for

548
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,480
overreactive or under reactive adrenals

549
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:03,440
so if you got some like overreacting

550
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,400
adrenals under reacting you know

551
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,260
adrenals sorry

552
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,480
got a lot of words going on in my brain

553
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:11,940
and mouth right here and

554
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:15,059
so low blood sugar that's another one

555
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:18,600
too hypoglycemia Sensations such as

556
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:21,360
edginess exhaustion feeling emotional

557
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:23,820
for unexplained reasons or you're

558
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:26,100
getting triggered really easily so check

559
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:27,539
that out so the energy shift is great if

560
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,919
you're feeling like you're getting

561
00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:31,020
triggered

562
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:32,580
like easily triggered like you're just

563
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:34,500
like oh my God I can't handle this

564
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:37,500
everybody's triggering me

565
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:39,659
so that's a whole another reason to use

566
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:41,580
that

567
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:43,440
these are so great then there's the

568
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:45,000
nerve shifter so I want to talk about

569
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,919
the nerve shifter just for a couple of

570
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
minutes which is really powerful on its

571
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:50,039
own I don't know if you guys had a

572
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,500
chance to try this one

573
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:54,900
when you're feeling shaky or anxious

574
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,580
like have you ever felt anxious or shaky

575
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:58,500
so it's not just the normal anxiety

576
00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:00,539
you're dealing with anxiety too but

577
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:03,059
you're shaky you're shaky you got like

578
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:05,760
the shakes If you experience random

579
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:08,159
spasms Twitches ticks are shifting and

580
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,740
moving pain throughout your body

581
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:12,299
like you know the random spasms and the

582
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:14,220
Twitches and the ticks and all of that

583
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:16,440
when you're struggling with any kind of

584
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:18,299
neurological onset or episode so the

585
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,679
nerve shifter a lot of people that

586
00:22:18,299 --> 00:22:21,780
they'll have their neurological symptoms

587
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:24,059
neurological problems

588
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:25,740
maybe you know you're just you're just

589
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:28,140
in a place where you have all the stuff

590
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:29,520
going on and you want to do something

591
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:32,760
because you're getting into an episode

592
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:34,679
so there's a nerve episode coming on and

593
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:37,559
you want to use the nerve shifter that's

594
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:40,320
a big deal right there on its own

595
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:42,600
to break a nervous feeling about the

596
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,039
moment you're in so if you're in this

597
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,780
moment you've got this nervous feeling

598
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:47,820
going on just get the nerve shifter out

599
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,900
the future or something that happened in

600
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:50,340
the past if you're thinking about

601
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,960
something that happened in the past and

602
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:55,380
it's bothering you like why did I say

603
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:57,419
that why did I say that to that person

604
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:59,400
like what was I thinking I don't know

605
00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:01,140
how it even came out of my mouth but it

606
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,880
did get the nerve shifter out because

607
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:06,140
now you're focused on that you're really

608
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,140
upset you're worried about it

609
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:12,000
to calm restless leg syndrome so if

610
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:13,980
you've got restless leg syndrome if you

611
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,240
can't you know deal with like if you

612
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,380
can't deal with the restless legs

613
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,000
because it's getting out of control

614
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:20,760
you're having an episode you're trying

615
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,620
to get to sleep do the nerve shifter

616
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,539
and then if you're gonna take a flight

617
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:26,580
somewhere or you're taking a trip that's

618
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:28,320
another time to use the Nerf shifter too

619
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:30,900
that's incredible the nerve shifter is

620
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,940
also an excellent tool to use for

621
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:35,039
weddings and other events that have

622
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:36,840
great meaning to you so it's like send

623
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:40,020
out a nerve shifter before you go to

624
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:42,360
your friend's party or whatever it is

625
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:43,620
so these are really potent these are

626
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,179
really powerful and what you're going to

627
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:47,039
find is you're gonna like you're gonna

628
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:49,260
like some

629
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,700
so much that you're gonna just keep them

630
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:52,020
there but always know that there's these

631
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,880
other ones you can always try and then

632
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:55,980
you might be surprised like whoa that

633
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,539
just hit me like it did this is a big

634
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:59,220
one I talked about a little bit the

635
00:23:57,539 --> 00:24:01,799
other day obsessive thoughts shifter

636
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:04,679
this is a huge one right here mind

637
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:07,320
racing thoughts you can't fall asleep

638
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:09,360
you can't rest you don't feel at peace

639
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,860
because the thoughts are coming in and

640
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,780
they keep on coming in or they're doing

641
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:14,520
this the Vicious Cycle they're just

642
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:16,440
spinning around in your head the

643
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:18,900
thoughts are moving around in your head

644
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:21,659
they're just in your brain going

645
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:23,880
swimming around or they feel like it's

646
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:25,440
painful and it's repetitive it's just

647
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,179
repetitive and you can't get rid of

648
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,360
those thoughts if you're stuck with them

649
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:32,940
could be anything and maybe somebody or

650
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:35,280
something triggered you so it became

651
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:37,440
worse and now you got those obsessive

652
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:39,780
thoughts and it's much worse and you're

653
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:43,080
struggling with it that can happen too

654
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:44,640
the obsessive thoughts shifter love it

655
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:46,020
so let me give you a couple of things

656
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,880
about it right here that's really

657
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:49,679
incredible because this is one of my

658
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:52,500
favorites for people because I see so

659
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:55,500
many people struggle out there

660
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:58,020
try this shot when you're trying to

661
00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:00,059
break repeated painful thought patterns

662
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:01,320
resulting from a difficult situation or

663
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:04,320
hardship if you're under a hardship

664
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:06,960
stressful situations anything like that

665
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:09,360
this can help break that pattern there's

666
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,700
a question I want to read here

667
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:14,220
um meditation and breathing are proven

668
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:16,860
to reduce long-term nerve feelings it

669
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:19,860
would be nice if he discussed all

670
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:21,659
strategies instead of just a drink okay

671
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:23,880
so first of all

672
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:25,860
something you have to understand when

673
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:28,260
people have neurological problems

674
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:30,240
tightness in the chest

675
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:32,460
Skin's burning

676
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,919
they're having panic attacks

677
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:38,100
the last thing they need to be doing is

678
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:39,600
intense breathing exercises so

679
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:41,820
I'm not trying to say you're not

680
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,740
experienced I'm not trying to say you

681
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:45,059
don't have experience whatever it is I'm

682
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:48,059
not trying to

683
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:51,779
be judgmental or anything

684
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:54,779
but it's critical to know that people

685
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:57,600
who have asthma

686
00:25:54,779 --> 00:26:00,419
people that have neurological asthma

687
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,260
people that have gastroparesis nerve

688
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:04,020
related

689
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:06,900
people who have trigeminal neuralgia

690
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:08,820
people that have vertigo and dizziness

691
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,559
people that have balance issues are you

692
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:13,140
following me because I saw that question

693
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:14,520
I wanted to read that balance issues

694
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:16,559
dizziness

695
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:18,360
vertigo

696
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,520
people that are struggling where they're

697
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:22,080
very weak and they're fatigued with

698
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:24,419
neurological fatigue let's keep on going

699
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,340
people that have numbness in their

700
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:28,919
fingers and hands

701
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:31,260
real physical neurological problems

702
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:32,940
which the Chronicles suffer from you

703
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:35,880
can't sit there and do all that intense

704
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:37,799
breathing exercise you'll end up a

705
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:40,020
possibly in the hospital with a massive

706
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:42,179
panic attack up all night because your

707
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:43,980
nerves are jacked up now

708
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:45,480
and then you'll also create too much

709
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:47,400
brain Heat

710
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:49,440
so when you read the book you'll read

711
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,700
about that it's not that I don't want

712
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,799
you to breathe if you don't want to

713
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:55,140
breathe that's not it at all and it's

714
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:57,059
not that a deep breath in a meditation

715
00:26:55,140 --> 00:27:00,480
is a bad thing

716
00:26:57,059 --> 00:27:02,100
but breathing exercises are for the not

717
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,059
so sick or the people who aren't sick

718
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,980
yet

719
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:06,840
that's what that's for

720
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:08,640
if you have experience with health

721
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,840
experience with other ones that are sick

722
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,539
and I have

723
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:15,240
Decades of experience here

724
00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:18,179
I know for a fact through Decades of

725
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:19,980
experience tingles numbness dizziness

726
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:22,320
balance issues

727
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:24,240
asthma neurological asthma tightness in

728
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,480
the chest tightness in the throat

729
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:29,100
trigeminal neuralgia

730
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,539
gastroparesis stomach problems you can't

731
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:33,960
sit there and do all that breathing

732
00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:35,460
exercise stuff you do it you're going to

733
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:38,340
be hurting

734
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:39,840
so I just want you to think before you

735
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:41,460
throw stuff out there because it sounded

736
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,799
like it was a little snarky like I don't

737
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:46,320
know what I'm talking about and I'm just

738
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:47,940
trying to get you to drink a drink and

739
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,500
you know and you're gonna teach me

740
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:51,299
something here you're gonna teach me

741
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:54,000
that why doesn't he just have all that

742
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:57,240
great breathing exercise stuff if it was

743
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,880
that great I'd be tooting it and tooting

744
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,919
it for decades for people

745
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:04,679
when you read the books you will learn

746
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:06,539
about how the balances go off when you

747
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:08,760
do the heavy heavy breathing exercises

748
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:11,460
how your oxygen levels go off the chart

749
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:14,100
and start to eat up neurons you have to

750
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:16,200
understand very important information is

751
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:19,500
in these brain books helping you and

752
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:21,419
protecting you from serious breathing

753
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:23,940
exercises when you're not feeling well

754
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:26,700
it's critical to know

755
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:29,539
I'm not anti-taking breath some breaths

756
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:33,179
in I'm not anti-breathing deeply I'm not

757
00:28:29,539 --> 00:28:35,400
anti-breathing in a meditation but heavy

758
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:36,960
breathing exercises does not work with

759
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,760
the chronically sick with neurological

760
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,480
problems and in 10 years there's so many

761
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,980
people they're going to have

762
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,480
neurological problems

763
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:44,220
and they're going to learn as they try

764
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:47,279
breath work that it's going to tank them

765
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:50,760
and send them down the drain

766
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:52,260
so and I I get it I'll probably lose a

767
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,400
couple of followers that aren't really

768
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:55,500
sick and they don't have the

769
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:57,000
neurological problems they don't have

770
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,039
the true vagus nerve issues and

771
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,500
trigeminal nerve issues and facial nerve

772
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:03,059
issues and I get it they'll probably be

773
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,500
like oh he doesn't know what he's

774
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:06,179
talking about but when you get sick

775
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:08,220
someday really sick and you got

776
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:10,020
neurological symptoms mark my words here

777
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:11,400
you'll be picking up the brain saver

778
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:14,760
book and you'll be reading it and being

779
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:17,279
like why didn't I know this five years

780
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:18,659
ago and why did I think I knew

781
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:20,840
everything

782
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:20,840
foreign

783
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:27,480
I'm going to read you a little section

784
00:29:24,539 --> 00:29:31,500
right here on page 84. let me see it's

785
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:33,419
84. I think it's in the brain saber book

786
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:37,200
so I want to read a little something for

787
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:39,899
you so let me go to page 84.

788
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,399
maybe 484 let's go let's go I think it's

789
00:29:39,899 --> 00:29:44,120
in here

790
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:44,120
and it is

791
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,039
so if you got a second the person who

792
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,260
was complaining that there's not enough

793
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:54,299
breath work in the books there's only

794
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:55,799
life-saving information in the medical

795
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:57,659
medium books that have saved people's

796
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:58,980
lives

797
00:29:57,659 --> 00:30:02,340
okay

798
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:05,600
taking care with breath work get ready I

799
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:05,600
want to read a little something here

800
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:10,700
so let me just find it here

801
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,240
okay

802
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:23,100
here's what an imbalance of electrical

803
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,380
brain supplies in the bloodstream looks

804
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:27,000
like in practice

805
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:29,340
I'll just go one more time you ready

806
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,960
this is Advanced information

807
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:33,779
the person who was throwing the breath

808
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:36,299
work at me can you follow along

809
00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:38,279
here's what an imbalance of electrical

810
00:30:36,299 --> 00:30:40,620
brain supplies in the bloodstream looks

811
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:42,360
like in practice

812
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:45,840
in the bloodstream

813
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:47,220
ready if someone already has crippling

814
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:50,039
anxiety

815
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:51,960
and they're not eating an even close to

816
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:53,640
the balance of foods and liquids they

817
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:56,580
need to keep their glucose and water

818
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:59,399
levels high in the bloodstream

819
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:01,140
you following me with that and then they

820
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:02,880
go through some type of emotional

821
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:05,880
turmoil

822
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,919
their adrenaline will be elevated

823
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:10,919
get this

824
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:14,100
their glucose in water will be reduced

825
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:15,419
and their breathing will be increased

826
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:18,960
fondly

827
00:31:15,419 --> 00:31:20,880
driving in more oxygen to the brain

828
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,520
heightened oxygen and heightened

829
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,500
adrenaline creating elevated heat on the

830
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:27,720
brain's electrical grid without glucose

831
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:30,059
and water to suppress the heat can even

832
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:32,279
lead to hyperventilation in some

833
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:35,100
situations it's why people who do breath

834
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:38,399
work who have neurological problems end

835
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:40,140
up in a big problem a massive big

836
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:43,260
problem I hope the person with the

837
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:45,659
breath won't work uh Judgment at me is

838
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:47,700
still listening and if they're not I

839
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:49,020
don't know what to tell you maybe you

840
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:51,059
know maybe you'll just leave because

841
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:54,059
it's all free because we do everything

842
00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:56,279
free so it's probably not valuable

843
00:31:54,059 --> 00:31:58,140
okay

844
00:31:56,279 --> 00:31:59,520
so let's go into this height and oxygen

845
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:01,260
and heightened adrenaline creating

846
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,880
elevated heat on the brain's electrical

847
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:04,559
grid without glucose and water to

848
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,020
suppress the heat can even lead to

849
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:09,240
hyperventilation in some situations the

850
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:11,940
electrical Sparks check this out

851
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:15,000
the electrical Sparks on the grid run

852
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:18,240
hotter and more sporadically and can

853
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,520
even go Rogue with brain electricity

854
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,980
becoming Reckless the electrical grid

855
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:25,440
becomes extra hot and travels to places

856
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:27,299
it's not supposed to travel in the brain

857
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,760
for what is occurring in the person's

858
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:31,860
life this can take a person to the level

859
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:34,260
of being completely overwhelmed push

860
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:36,659
them into a panic attack or shut them

861
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:38,279
down so they're less responsive lying

862
00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:40,200
curled up in bed feeling wrecked I'm

863
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:42,360
trying to talk about what happens with

864
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,980
breath work where literally it can throw

865
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:46,440
somebody into a horrible panic attack

866
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:49,500
I'm giving you the actual medical medium

867
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:51,840
science into how that can happen that's

868
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:54,000
so farther ex that's so far Advanced

869
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:56,539
past science and past anybody who's into

870
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,539
breath work

871
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:01,140
I always told you guys I'm not smart I'm

872
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,640
just a messenger with this Advanced

873
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:04,620
information

874
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,480
the balances get off when someone

875
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:08,399
doesn't have enough electrolytes and

876
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,840
glucose in their brain so the balance

877
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:11,820
goes off and they don't have enough

878
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,140
water electrolyte and glucose in the

879
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:14,760
brain and that's what happens people

880
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:16,919
with chronic that are chronically ill

881
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,419
don't have enough of that in them and

882
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:21,480
people who aren't chronically ill don't

883
00:33:18,419 --> 00:33:24,299
have enough of that in them either

884
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:26,880
taking care with breath work so let's

885
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:28,980
walk down that aisle a little bit if you

886
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,779
guys got a second we're often taught to

887
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:33,899
use breath work to help regulate

888
00:33:30,779 --> 00:33:36,059
emotions deep breathing and breath work

889
00:33:33,899 --> 00:33:39,059
certain types of it

890
00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:41,820
do have some value I'm not negating

891
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:43,740
breathing I'm not saying breathing's bad

892
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:44,880
I'm not saying you can't do a little

893
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:48,179
breath work

894
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:50,820
but at the same time breath work is not

895
00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:53,399
what people think it is

896
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:55,919
what people don't realize is that there

897
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:58,440
is such a thing as too much oxygen

898
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:00,720
uh-huh

899
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:02,159
even though we're in a world lacking

900
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,080
oxygen

901
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:05,940
we're also in a world where people are

902
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,980
lacking what they need in their diet if

903
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:09,839
you're not keeping a balance with other

904
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:12,119
brain supplies such as glucose Trace

905
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:13,800
mineral salts and water then driving up

906
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:15,419
oxygen to your brain heats up your

907
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,339
electrical grid and that can be

908
00:34:15,419 --> 00:34:19,320
traumatizing to the brain and body on

909
00:34:17,339 --> 00:34:21,060
top of which people are often doing

910
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:23,220
breath work while also consuming

911
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:24,540
caffeine which dries up adrenaline

912
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:26,820
putting their brain and bloodstream

913
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:30,720
further out of balance what I'm trying

914
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:32,220
to say this is really like incredible

915
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,780
information here

916
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:35,700
is that

917
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:38,339
it's Advanced information if you don't

918
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:40,619
have what your brain needs

919
00:34:38,339 --> 00:34:42,240
and you're chronically sick and you're

920
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:44,040
sitting there trying to drive an oxygen

921
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:46,740
to the brain through breath work

922
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:48,240
the nerves can't handle it the brain

923
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:50,159
heats up and the nerves can handle it

924
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:53,580
throws you into panic attacks throws you

925
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:56,159

00:35:55,619 --> 00:35:59,880
to say it but everybody seems to be the

952
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:01,800
one size fits all out there

953
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:03,180
it's really sad because we got a whole

954
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,700

961
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:23,579
if you're really sick and struggling and

962
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:25,020

974
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,280
difficult for people with anxiety and

975
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,940
even worsens it for most anxiety

976
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,940

989
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:26,820
five minutes because the brain got

990
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:27,720
intensely hot and the neurons had an

991
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:29,880

they're going to go out and next thing

1003
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:53,579
you know it'll be on some invited on

somebody's podcast and spreading it

1005
00:37:53,579 --> 00:37:57,240
around and not citing it back to Medical

1006
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:59,280
medium it's a sick world I never

1007
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:00,839
expected it to be that sick meaning

1008
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,060
demented

1009
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:04,740
and evil and dark I never expected that

1010
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:06,359
when I was a kid I thought everybody was

1011
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:08,280
going to be happy and loving and want

1012
00:38:06,359 --> 00:38:10,500

00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:14,060
else can find their way backward to heal

1015
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:18,000
breath work is really difficult for

1016
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:20,400
people with anxiety and even worsens it

1017
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,140
for most anxiety sufferers it worsens it

1018
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,400
for anxiety sufferers stick a bunch of

1019
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,960
people who aren't feeling well in a

1020
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,339
breath work class and you got a whole

1021
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,380

1025
00:38:31,859 --> 00:38:34,440
don't see me recommending breath work

1026
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:36,599

anxiety and breath work it makes me feel

1030
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:45,359
awful it actually hurts people more than

1031
00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:47,400
helps them

1032
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:49,140
people who are not so sick who don't get

1033
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:51,060
affected by it yet it's still hurting

1034
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:53,640
them they're just not feeling the hurt

1035
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:55,260
yet but they will later down the road so

1036
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:57,720
the person who judged me on this I hope

1037
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:58,920
they're still watching you'll see the

1038
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,359

1041
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,119
more than me

1042
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:09,480
breath work is really difficult for

1043
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:11,099
people with anxiety and even worsens it

1044
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:13,740
for most anxiety suffers especially

1045
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:16,500
those with sensitive vagus nerves

1046
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:19,260
sensitive vagus nerves reading out a

1047
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:21,060
brain saver you guys

1048
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:22,859
do you know how many people have

1049
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:24,300
sensitive Vegas nerves so let's go do a

1050
00:39:22,859 --> 00:39:26,280
breath work class and let's just make

1051
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:28,800
our Vegas nerves freak out and so we end

1052
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:30,720
up in the hospital overnight

1053
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,859
causing neurological symptoms such as

1054
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,480
tightness of the chest and remember

1055
00:39:31,859 --> 00:39:35,700
breath work was something that came

1056
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:37,859
about over a dude that was never well

1057
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:40,380
not had symptoms but not sick

1058
00:39:37,859 --> 00:39:42,900
neurologically

1059
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:45,480
so it's like a dude thing

1060
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:48,240
breath work was initially a dude thing

1061
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:51,119
it was a dude thing

1062
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:52,440
and then it eventually got into the yoga

1063
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:54,540
community and everything else yoga

1064
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:57,480
wasn't really all breath work

1065
00:39:54,540 --> 00:40:00,300
30 years ago yoga wasn't all about

1066
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:02,099
breath work yes breath work was involved

1067
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:04,500
but now they've like they're they're

1068
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:05,820
mixing it now it's like breath work and

1069
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,320
they get all these people that are just

1070
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,880
like they can't handle it so they quit

1071
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:10,619

1072
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:13,760

00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:36,859
assist fit the physical body

1108
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:41,760
the body doesn't only survive on oxygen

1109
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:44,880
so you want to be a breatharian and just

1110
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:47,099
die somewhere in a desert

1111
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:49,079
so oxygen is how we only survive we only

1112
00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:51,720
survive with oxygen

1113
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:53,579
that's it so quit your quitcher than

1114
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:55,800
your your tonics

1115
00:41:53,579 --> 00:41:57,780
quit your don't do brain shot therapy

1116
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:00,119
don't do heavy metal detox cleanses

1117
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:02,940
don't do celery juice don't do any kind

1118
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:06,260
of supplementation just do oxygen and

1119
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:06,260
just die in a desert somewhere

1120
00:42:06,359 --> 00:42:10,079
Michelle L none of that crap helped me

1121
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:12,060
ever and you went through a lot Michelle

1122
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:15,420
I've seen comments before

1123
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:17,160
sunrid yes that's me my Vegas nerve

1124
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:18,960
stress out with breath work and that's

1125
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,940
what they don't understand the breath

1126
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:25,200
work

1127
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:27,480
the breath work trashes the vagus nerves

1128
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,460
but don't be afraid to breathe or do

1129
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:30,960
gentle breathing exercises if you want

1130
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:34,140
to incorporate that into your life I

1131
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:38,160
talk about it in the brain saver books

1132
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:40,940
yeah but there's a difference of what is

1133
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,940
happening here

1134
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:46,400
very important

1135
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:53,160
but I love being schooled

1136
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:55,380
35 years of getting people better eight

1137
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:57,000
books that have saved millions of lives

1138
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:59,640
around the planet

1139
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:02,280
but you you want to school me

1140
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:03,839
people get adrenaline high from heavy

1141
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:05,520
breath work and that's the next thing I

1142
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:07,440
want to talk about read the books I talk

1143
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:10,140
about it inside the books people go on

1144
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,760
adrenaline highs when they do intense

1145
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:14,339
breath work and they're not sick or

1146
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:17,220
suffering with all kinds of problems yet

1147
00:43:14,339 --> 00:43:19,560
I know people that actually weren't sick

1148
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:21,720
doing breath work for a few years

1149
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:23,339
feeling great but then they got sick and

1150
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,720
then they went to their old staple I'm

1151
00:43:23,339 --> 00:43:26,880
going to do my breath work and get

1152
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:28,260
myself better but they were sick and

1153
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,359
they didn't realize you can't mix the

1154
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:31,980
both the two and they start doing their

1155
00:43:30,359 --> 00:43:33,599
breath work and they started doing it

1156
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:35,640
all and started following all the breath

1157
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:37,800
word Kings and they're doing it and they

1158
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:39,540
ended up like this seizuring on the

1159
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:41,339
ground wondering why and that they're

1160
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:43,140
literally at the doctor's office the

1161
00:43:41,339 --> 00:43:44,400
next day going what's wrong with me and

1162
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:45,839
the doctor's like what were you doing

1163
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,660
it's like I was doing breath because I

1164
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:52,339
wasn't the reason they were sick the

1165
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:52,339
breath work just ignited the fire

1166
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:59,220
you have to smother a fire

1167
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:02,040
take the oxygen down

1168
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:05,700
too much oxygen to a fire makes it

1169
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:08,339
hotter and faster and spreads

1170
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:10,020
and so what happens is when you have

1171
00:44:08,339 --> 00:44:11,280
electricity in your brain so let's go

1172
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:12,599
into it a little bit this turned out to

1173
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,859
be a breath work talk when you have

1174
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:16,619
electricity in your brain swimming

1175
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:18,180
around you got the match that's your

1176
00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:20,099
fire

1177
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:22,079
if you don't have enough glucose in

1178
00:44:20,099 --> 00:44:24,180
electrolytes and hydration inside the

1179
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:26,040
brain and glycogen storages inside the

1180
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:27,960
brain and you want to bring in all that

1181
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:30,060
oxygen but you don't have anything else

1182
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:31,319
in there to keep the fire down and you

1183
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:32,760
want to bring in the oxygen you're going

1184
00:44:31,319 --> 00:44:34,319
to blow that fire up and your Vegas

1185
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:35,640
nerves are going to be spasming out

1186
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:37,680
you're going to be tightness to the

1187
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:41,660
chest you're going to be all whacked out

1188
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:41,660
you're going to be in a bad situation

1189
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,780
and don't you know don't if you don't

1190
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,400
have the brain saver books

1191
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:51,960
and you're sitting here judging me and

1192
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,720
you want to throw breath work nonsense

1193
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:56,220
at me like you know and and judge me on

1194
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,780
that you don't even have these credible

1195
00:44:56,220 --> 00:45:00,839
books with all the life-saving medical

1196
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:02,400
information and stuff you read 10 lines

1197
00:45:00,839 --> 00:45:04,079
in just the first chapter and it's

1198
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:07,319
unbelievable how much info's in here

1199
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:10,680
what people notice is Medical

1200
00:45:07,319 --> 00:45:12,540
medium info makes sense it's very

1201
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:14,099
complex information but it makes sense

1202
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:16,380
so people don't realize that medical

1203
00:45:14,099 --> 00:45:18,240
meme information makes so much sense all

1204
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:21,619
the time so all you have to do is just

1205
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,619
read it or be open to it

1206
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:24,079
foreign

1207
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,640
I'm not picking on anybody for schooling

1208
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:35,160
me

1209
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:36,359
but you gotta kind of you know know what

1210
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,780
you're talking about if you're going to

1211
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:38,780
school me

1212
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:43,319
little medium information is not common

1213
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:46,800
sense it's

1214
00:45:43,319 --> 00:45:48,720
not common sense it sense that nobody

1215
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:52,859
knew

1216
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:55,200
and then they learn and it makes sense

1217
00:45:52,859 --> 00:45:57,000
common sense is just crap out there oh

1218
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:59,099
it's Common Sense oh really

1219
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,319
and then someone you know gets hurt Oh I

1220
00:45:59,099 --> 00:46:03,300
thought I was doing it right

1221
00:46:01,319 --> 00:46:05,700
the truth hits you when you read the

1222
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:08,880
brain saver books truth just hits you

1223
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:11,640
it's just whoa it's there

1224
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:13,260
Michelle L says it's insulting aw to you

1225
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:16,740
and to us

1226
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:18,420
yeah but here's how it works Michelle

1227
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:20,220
that person or that per or another

1228
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:22,319
person or another person you're just

1229
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:24,839
gonna leave their comfort zone of not so

1230
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:26,280
sick and they're gonna get sick someday

1231
00:46:24,839 --> 00:46:27,660
and then they're going to get the

1232
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:29,400
medical medium books after they visit

1233
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:31,200
their 10th neurologist and 10th

1234
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:32,940
functional medicine doctor they're going

1235
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,500
to get to the medical medium books and

1236
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:36,060
you know what's going to happen they're

1237
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,319
going to heal themselves and they're

1238
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:39,780
still going to on the medical

1239
00:46:37,319 --> 00:46:41,339
medium name and the medical medium

1240
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:42,900
Community because they're just going to

1241
00:46:41,339 --> 00:46:44,280
do it spitefully they're going to do it

1242
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:45,839
behind the scenes and they're not going

1243
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:47,400
to come clean on their mistakes and

1244
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:49,440
they're just going to like take the info

1245
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:51,240
and poach it for themselves heal

1246
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:53,760
themselves and still tote how apple

1247
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:55,980
cider vinegar did it or some collagen

1248
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:58,520
did it or some charcoal did it or

1249
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:58,520
something else

1250
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:05,880
Kerry Rose said this happened to me my

1251
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:07,859
chiropractor told me to do these big

1252
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:09,780
breath work exercises I ended up

1253
00:47:07,859 --> 00:47:13,079
crippled in pain in my neck and

1254
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:14,160
shoulders anxiety was so much worse it's

1255
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:17,339
real

1256
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:20,400
it's real you guys

1257
00:47:17,339 --> 00:47:22,560
it's real I've seen it mess people up

1258
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:25,680
I've seen it mess people up for years

1259
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:27,599
but it tells me that people don't have

1260
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:31,200
experience with the chronic wheel then

1261
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:32,880
how come I have to know all these things

1262
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,980
it's like people don't have the

1263
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:36,839
experience then when they say things

1264
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:38,579
they don't have the experience with the

1265
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:40,079
chronically all these years it's obvious

1266
00:47:38,579 --> 00:47:42,000
they got into Health who knows how many

1267
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:43,500
years ago played arounds bought an eat

1268
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,839

they already had they didn't have a lot

1272
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,980
of exposure a lot of bugs in them and

1273
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:55,560
they were like okay I got a free ride in

it's real this information of what's

1277
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:02,839
Happening

1278
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:08,819
laughs

1279
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:10,380
yeah I can't even understand how anyone

1280
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:12,720
can do that I know but they do it by the

1281
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:14,700
hundreds and thousands out there

1282
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:17,700
Death By A Thousand Cuts it's what they

1283
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:19,440
try to do out there oh quick

1284
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:22,200
just cleaning your book kind of thing

1291
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,640
that there's marks all over it and they

1292
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:40,920
think they have a used book and then

1293
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:43,020

gave pristine books to Amazon and other

1297
00:48:50,339 --> 00:48:57,300
um you know other warehouses and the

1298
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:59,160
conveyor belt got them dirty so I wanted

1299
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:01,079
to say you can take a little dish soap

1300
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:03,359
with a damp towel and clean off your

1301
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:05,040
covers creative heart says a lot of

1302
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:06,780
people wonder why they don't feel good

1303
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:09,380
after doing breath work thanks for

1304
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:09,380

1305
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:13,260
look

1306
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:15,180
I like explaining I like meaning like

1307
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:17,880
explaining what's in here because this

1308
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:19,800
is where it's all at

1309
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:21,780
that's what's incredible so what I do is

1310
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:24,599
I take like a handy wipe

1311
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:27,540
handy wipes tend to work good too

1312
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:29,460
I gotta kick me sign on my back is what

1313
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:31,140
I have you guys know that

1314
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:34,800
and all we you know which is terrible

1315
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:37,740
anyway but s life right

1316
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:39,900
boom Handi wipe cleans the grease off

1317
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:41,579
wow medical medium books come out nice

1318
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:43,740
and clean

1319
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:45,780
quality of medical media books equality

1320
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:47,819
is incredible because I don't want any

1321
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:49,980
cheap stuff you guys can you leave some

1322
00:49:47,819 --> 00:49:52,440
reviews for the protocols book and for

1323
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:53,880
brain saver just so the trolls don't get

1324
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:56,220
ahead of us

1325
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:57,960
and leave the illegal reviews they don't

1326
00:49:56,220 --> 00:50:00,420
buy the books they don't purchase them

1327
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:02,400
and they leave reviews it's evil

1328
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:04,740
so if you can leave some reviews if you

1329
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:06,599
like the books right just doing a quick

1330
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:09,180
little cleanup right here

1331
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:11,700
and a reminder

1332
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:15,599
that these books

1333
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:18,000
were stored in a warehouse that had no

1334
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:21,119
plug-in air fresheners no chemical

1335
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:23,460
toxins none of that kind of stuff and

1336
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:25,020
the publisher did that for me and my

1337
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:27,839
people

1338
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:29,640
so if you do get a book that smells and

1339
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:32,339
needs to air out for a little while it's

1340
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:35,099
not because of us it's because of the

1341
00:50:32,339 --> 00:50:37,380
scented candles in a warehouse

1342
00:50:35,099 --> 00:50:40,200
um somewhere else

1343
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:41,880
maybe a you know whatever the the chain

1344
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,900
that you got the store from whatever it

1345
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:45,119
is

1346
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:46,440
you know that's another story so I'm

1347
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:50,760
just letting you know air them out but

1348
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:53,760
the books are pristine and we're stored

1349
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:55,980
without that chemical that's always in

1350
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:58,619
those warehouses

1351
00:50:55,980 --> 00:51:00,839
laundry detergents and stuff like that

1352
00:50:58,619 --> 00:51:02,160
none of that was stored around the

1353
00:51:00,839 --> 00:51:04,140
medical medium books like everybody

1354
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:05,760
else's books

1355
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:09,119
and it was done

1356
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:10,740
purposely to look out for you guys

1357
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:12,480
a lot of thought goes into these

1358
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:15,059
incredible books I just want you to know

1359
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:18,059
a lot of thoughts go into it

1360
00:51:15,059 --> 00:51:19,920
um I know I do a lot of like lives and

1361
00:51:18,059 --> 00:51:21,480
stuff like that and a lot of I do the

1362
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:24,119
podcasts and lives and I do everything

1363
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:25,680
and there's no pay walls and stuff like

1364
00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:27,960
that I just don't want to recreate that

1365
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:30,660
there's no courses there's no this and

1366
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:32,400
that I know that people poached bits and

1367
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:33,780
pieces from the medical medium books and

1368
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,520
they create their own courses out there

1369
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:38,579
in the world and add in all this bad

1370
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:42,599
stuff it's really a sad world out there

1371
00:51:38,579 --> 00:51:44,960
I think people are just desperate to be

1372
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:44,960
somebody

1373
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:49,319
um

1374
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:52,440
whatever I don't know all I'm saying is

1375
00:51:49,319 --> 00:51:54,720
that I'm keeping this stuff free

1376
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:56,640
I hear every time I have people tell me

1377
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:59,460
all the time that if you make everything

1378
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:02,280
for free people think it doesn't have

1379
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:04,140
value I know you guys don't believe that

1380
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:06,359
but that's what I'm told anyway I'm

1381
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:08,520
keeping it free like I do it's free

1382
00:52:06,359 --> 00:52:10,980
wherever I can

1383
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:12,480

1384
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:14,280
road for the book to get into the

1385
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:16,319
library which takes me time to get them

1386
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:18,300
into a library then wait for that day

1387
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:21,660

I don't oh look out for imposters you

guys and there's imposters

1415
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:23,700
and the imposters are getting people

1416
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:25,200
upset out there because they take their

1417
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:26,400
money and they say terrible things and

1418
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:28,440
they do terrible things so there's

1419
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:31,319
imposters out there that do terrible

1420
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:33,420
things and so then people go out and

1421
00:53:31,319 --> 00:53:35,880
they'll say they they use the imposters

1422
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:37,980
use my name Anthony William the medical

1423
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:40,380
medium and then they try to get a

1424
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:42,780
consult with somebody they tell the

1425
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:45,240
person I'm gonna fix you and the person

1426
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:48,480
then does a consult with them and then

1427
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:50,180
they do terrible horrible things

1428
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:53,099
and then the person who's been wrong

1429
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:55,740
goes online and says terrible horrible

1430
00:53:53,099 --> 00:53:58,380
things about me when I had nothing to do

1431
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:59,760
with it and I don't do consults

1432
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:01,920
so

1433
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:03,540
keep an eye out for that it's really sad

1434
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:07,140

00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:09,240

1439
00:54:12,599 --> 00:54:15,839

1440
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:18,359
there is to talk well there's tons to

1441
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:21,780

1443
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:26,040
you get them in your hands

1444
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:28,980
just know they're living words inside

1445
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:30,599
these books the energy is in these books

1446
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:34,200
you can feel it

1447
00:54:30,599 --> 00:54:36,300
you can feel it it's there and they're

1448
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:37,260
not dead books with dead words on the

1449
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:41,520
pages

1450
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:43,500
and that is obvious when you hold them

1451
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:47,520
keep in mind though it's a lot of

1452
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:49,800
information in every single line is

1453
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:52,380
packed with a message

1454
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:54,359
for everybody cold white spring I told

1455
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:56,720

many of you mattress Island you've been

1482
00:55:48,359 --> 00:55:51,540
through hell and back

1483

and

1484
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:55,680
I know that a lot of people don't

1485
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:56,940
understand what it's like to be in your

1486
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:59,819
shoes

1487
00:55:56,940 --> 00:56:01,500
and when you feel hopeless and you feel

1488
00:55:59,819 --> 00:56:02,400
like you have no answers and you're

1489
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:05,040

00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:09,180
can relate to the hurt you have in your

1492
00:56:07,859 --> 00:56:10,920
life and all that

1493
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:12,480

1494
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:14,220
