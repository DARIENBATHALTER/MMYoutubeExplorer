that episode

70
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,920
it's a mind blower so i'm going to juice

71
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,840
some celery because

72
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,560
then i thought about it because the

73
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,560
thing is most of the people that i know

74
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,680
that got off of caffeine so most of the

75
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,080
people that i know

76
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,120
they used celery juice to get off of it

77
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,879
and

78
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,239
would be like well how's that how's that

79
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,440
going to work it

80
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,120
does it has that kind of power because

81
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,040
what the celery juice does is it

82
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,560
it's a complete electrolyte and when

83
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,760
that complete electrolyte

84
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,040
goes to the brain that's when you can do

85
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,560
the switch off

86
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,720
then i talked about that so in the

87
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,959
episode you got to check this out okay

88
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,959
in the episode you got to hear how that

89
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:48,239
works by the way this juice right here

and it squeezes every last drop and

105
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,560
that's what i love about it it squeezes

106
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,360
every last drop out of it

107
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,280
that's what i dig about it but so back

108
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,159
to this whole thing with the caffeine

109
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,720
episode it's like it's like well okay

110
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,640
there's a heat

111
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,920
i put healing tools in that episode

112
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,519
powerful healing tools

113
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,920
so you can get off the caffeine if you

114
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,280
want all right and i talk about like

115
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,319
what caffeine does

116
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,159
to our adrenals what it does to the to

117
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,599
the emotional center of the brain how we

118
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,319
get dependent on it

119
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,120
and how it kind of sucks the life out of

120
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,680
us

121
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,000
it's not an even trade-off and i talk

122
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:51,040
about that about caffeine how caffeine

123
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,720
is not an even trade-off you guys it's

124
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,560
not i'm about to juice some celery juice

125
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,720
if you just got on here some celery

126
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,840
so but the even trade-off i'm talking

127
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,319
about is what

128
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,439
that caffeine does it's a powerful

129
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,599
diuretic

130
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,760
and it sucks out your trace minerals

131
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,680
trace minerals that are in here

132
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,959
so it draws out those trace minerals out

133
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,560
of your cells

134
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,319
that's what caffeine does it acts like

135
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,760
that powerful diuretic that just sucks

136
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,799
the life out of you it's like the

137
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,639
vampire

138
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,079
is what it is you have your cup of

139
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,199
vampire that's what you do

140
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,120
it's like i'm gonna have my cup of

141
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,520
vampire right now and

142
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,520
so because it will suck the trace

143
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,840
minerals and nutrients out of you

144
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,160
just draw it out of you and then what's

145
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,840
replacing it that's what i want to know

146
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,520
like where are you replacing all those

147
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,120

148
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,759
trace minerals like where is it coming

machine

190
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,680
any of the mega machines over the years

191
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,840
it's like well why is that

192
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,039
better how come it's always a better

193
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,759
experience for me

194
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,199
and that's why i like the omega machines

195
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,080
so it's like why is it a better

196
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,520
experience experience

197
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,600
for me and everybody's asked me for

198
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,080
years i hardly talk about they always

199
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,800
ask

200
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,440
what do you do like you sell it so i

201
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,600
said

202
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,039
no what do you do and i'm like what do

203
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,680
you mean what do i do

204
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,080
i told you i choose celery every day for

205
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,360
well

206
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:26,000
over 35 years or more and it's like well

207
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,560
you know like what machine what tools

208
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,720
they're like

209
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,600
the mega just that's the one and this

210
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,120
one's the uh

211
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:36,240
mm-900 hds just so you know

212
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,000
so you can check that out but

213
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,160
the key about this what i like about

214
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,759
this machine is this stuff comes out so

215
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,759
dry it's ridiculous

216
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,440
so you save money at the end of the year

217
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,479
that's how i experience it

218
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:51,680
like my experience is i actually

219
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:55,120
save because i'm juicing less

220
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,520
celery and when i'm juicing less celery

221
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,720
then boom it's like okay well i'm buying

222
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,199
less celery

223
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,000
that's what i love about this model it's

224
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,360
like i'm buying

225
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,479
less celery because i'm juicing less

226
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,680
and i'm getting more juice per stock and

227
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,440
everybody's got their opinion on what

228
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,759
juice do they like if you guys

229
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,360
if you have a juicer use that juicer you

230
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,720
guys got a juicer that you like a

231
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,319
favorite juicer you like just

232
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,479
keep using that juicer you know i tell

233
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,560
people if

234
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,319
if you love doing it with a blender do

235
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,560
it with a blender

236
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,639
i've been saying that for years i always

237
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,960
tell people would you have a blender

238
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,039
because if you got a blender just just

239
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,560
um strain it through a cheesecloth a nut

240
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,639
cloth

241
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,960
a nut bag or a cheesecloth that's what

242
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,560
you do because you want to strain it you

243
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:44,879
want to strain your celery

244
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:47,120
juice is what you want to do so um

245
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,560
but anyway but if you're interested in

246
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,919
if you don't have a machine or something

247
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,639
that you like and you're looking for a

248
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,240
machine

249
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,919
this is my favorite right here the

250
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,120
mm-900 hdf

251
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:59,440
link is in the description so

252
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,199

you know people need

258
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:13,759
but um i want to tell you guys did you

and

283
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,399
shut it off here so got some celery

284
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,640
juice right there

285
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,399

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,000
count the stalks you can you know

287
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,640
like count them or something if you want

288
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,040
but this is really dry to the bone

289
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,560
i love it it's light and fluffy and

290
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,000

and 60 you can save off this machine

321
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,720
right now which is really cool but if

322
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,440
you're somebody that wants to get off

323
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,880
caffeine

324
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,279
because they know a lot of people do

325
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,519
they're like dying to get off of it

326
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,800
it's this is a great tool now why is

327
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,480
celery juice a great tool it's a

328
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,399
complete electrolyte

329
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,160
because what we do is we try to gather

330
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,680
electrolytes all through our life we're

331
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,640
always trying to gather an electrolyte

332
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,399
every food we eat

333
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,839
it's like electrolyte electrolyte we're

334
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,480
trying to get little pieces but the

335
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,800
celery juice is a complete electrolyte

336
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,240
the power of that is incredible so when

337
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,040
it's a complete electrolyte

338
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,880
changes the game big time because what

339
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,240
happens is caffeine goes into the

340
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,000
emotional center of the brain it goes

341
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,320
into all the neurons in the brain

342
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,440
it triggers off adrenaline so adrenaline

343
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,680
floods your brain

344
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,680
and that can wear you down over time

345
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,600
burn out the neurotransmitters

346
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,680
burn out the neurons but yeah it gives

347
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,800
you a rush it gets you through your day

348
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,720
it can help push you through your day

349
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,040
and i totally get it so many people need

350
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,120
that

351
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,680
because without it they can't function

352
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,600
but what i like doing is restoring

353
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,720
the like fixing the problem and

354
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,880
restoring

355
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,320
what's missing so that's what i like to

356
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,959
do so the celery juice

357
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,399
the health benefits that i like and talk

358
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,959
about in the medical medium books is

359
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,880
like

360
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,320
is it's about that complete electric

361
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,240
going to your

362
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,399
neurons you know helping those

363
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,160
electrical impulses fire up

364
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,800
like rehydrating and restoring

365
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,399
neurotransmitters you've got to have

366
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,880
those neurotransmitters working

367
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,920
they've got to be working so that's a

368
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,120
big deal right there you're drinking

369
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,800
celery now sarah

370
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,320
and you're doing your jelly juice now

371
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:50,639
incredible you guys are amazing

372
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:52,959
so so um so the reason why

373
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,839
there's there's no trade-off that's

374
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,360
actually good with

375
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,160
caffeine got to remember that it's not

376
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,639
an equal trade-off it's like the vampire

377
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,399
it just sucks the life out of us over

378
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,880
time i talk about in the episode as far

379
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,920
as it

380
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,320
aging us so i know you'll hear all the

381
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,639
time

382
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,600
anti-aging anti-aging anti-aging no

383
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,160
actually

384
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,639
you know caffeine anything with caffeine

385
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,000
in it's

386
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:19,040
not anti-aging it's the opposite

387
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,720
overtime caffeine is the boy who cried

388
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,720
wolf with the adrenals where it's fight

389
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,880
or flight fight or flight all the time

390
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,320
so what i like about the celery juice is

391
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,959
it's like restoring

392
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,639
what has been taken from you all that

393
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,440
adrenaline that's been pumping out of

394
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,639
your adrenals

395
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,560
every year while you're doing your

396
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,320
caffeine right and

397
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,800
who's doing that who's restoring your

398
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,639
adrenals like who's doing that you guys

399
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,760
who's restoring the adrenals

400
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,160
who's restoring you know the

401
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,600
neurotransmitters

402
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,920
and that's what i love about the celery

403
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,240
juice so it's like it's one thing

404
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,200
you know and what i like about this

405
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,839
juicer

406
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,440
way better than any juicer i've used if

407
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,040
you have a juicer you like just use that

408
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,720
one if you have a blender you like use

409
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,600
that one but this is the juicer that i

410
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,560
like

411
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,560
it's it the the pulp is light as air

412
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,040
it's fluffy and light i mean hardly

413
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,120
juiced

414
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,720
anything like anything there's barely

415
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,279
any pulp in this right here

416
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,560
and i got a full container right now of

417
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,000
celery juice i'm just going to show you

418
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,000
right now

419
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,480
and i didn't even scratch the surface

420
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,600
which how much i washed a lot of celery

421
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,120
right here

422
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,959
and i mean i washed a lot of it and

423
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,639
didn't even burn through i still got a

424
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,079
pile right here didn't even burn through

425
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,000
like hardly any of it right there and

426
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,519
that's what i like about this juicer

427
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,160
and someone said to me the other day

428
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,760
well you like your juicer but that means

429
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,279
you've only used that juicer

430
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,920
company probably that juicer brand i'm

431
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:43,519
like uh no i've tried every

432
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:45,680
single juicer that was available

433
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,880
over the years every one i'd be like

434
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,000
okay i'm gonna try that one and be like

435
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,160
whoa that's a hassle

436
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,079
cleaning that or hey let me try this one

437
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,399
no that's not giving me that much juice

438
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,480
or

439
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,519
let me try this one that's not so great

440
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,120
and that's

441
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,240
my experience you know you might have a

442
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,440
better experience you might have a

443
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,800
better experience with

444
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,800
your juicer you might have a better

445
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,160
experience with your blender

446
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,000
you might have a better experience with

447
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,440
something whatever you guys do but i

448
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,320
love this one it's twenty percent off

449
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,160
which is so cool

450
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,480

451
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,800

to that caffeine episode you guys can't

466
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,800
miss the caffeine episode you can't and

467
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,800
i mean seriously you'll be blown off

468
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,800
your seat when you hear that episode

469
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,079
so medical media podcasted apple podcast

470
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,800
but i got a lot going on

471
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:52,480
so i can't be cleaning a juicer all day

472
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,639
long you know i can't be

473
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,680
cleaning a juicer i i use celery juice

474
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,160
twice a day

475
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,959
a lot of days it's twice a day or i'll

476
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,079
do a big

477
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:03,600
load of it in the morning right and i

478
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,920
just don't want to sit there cleaning a

479
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,360
juicer all morning long so this is why i

480
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,839
like this juicer

481
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,800
i like it because for me for some reason

482
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,399
it's just so much

483
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,160
easier and i've tried a lot of them like

484
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,680
oh my god what do i got to scrub and do

485
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,639
and this one's less of all that

486
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,680
my opinion um people ask me what my

487
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,360
favorite juicer is

488
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,800
so i thought i'd show you guys you know

489
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,920
i thought i'd show you guys i've showed

490
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,079
you before

491
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,600
but everybody forgets or something you

492
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,199
know they don't forget and then

493
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,639
they start bombarding me with what's

494
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,560
your favorite juicer over and over again

495
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,240
until it finally gets to a point where

496
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,920
it's like oh my god i have to i have to

497
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,240
do this but the perfect thing is

498
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,079
it's like wait a minute i you know if

499
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,519
you really need to get off caffeine like

500
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,800
if you're somebody that wants to get off

501
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,399
the caffeine and you're someone that's

502
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,079
trying to get off the caffeine

503
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,759
or anything like that that you got an

504
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:50,160
option it's like the celery juice is

505
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,839
that way to break withdrawal

506
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,600

whatever it was the caffeine addiction

593
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,919
and

594
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:35,440

595
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,080
of your youth is what it does over the

596
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,720
years

597
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,480
and no one talks about that i talk about

598
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,720
that in the episode how that works

599
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,440
because it can rob you of your youth

600
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,600
and it's really important to know and so

601
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,000
it's like what are you doing to

602
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,679

strain

659
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,320
you guys could blend it strain it

660
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,720
through a nut bag or a cheesecloth okay

661
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,720
totally and it only takes a few minutes

662
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,720
to make juice with this it's incredible

663
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,760
only takes a few minutes and it saves so

664
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,919
much time

665
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,679

666
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,480
i look i told you

667
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,039
this saves you money with how much juice

668
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,919
you get

669
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:53,600
out of a stock that's the difference i

670
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:56,000
barely used any celery

671
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,960
i got a pile here i haven't even touched

672
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,559
you see the pile

673
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,200
haven't even scratched the surface of

674
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:02,080
that pile and it's saving me money every

675
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,960
year my experience

676
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:06,559
is i save lots of money on salary every

677
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,760
single year with this model so it's like

678
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:10,640
okay what's the trade-off

679
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,880
well it's 20 off right now get a deal on

680
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,960
it number one and then whatever it costs

681
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,640
you actually make back by the end of the

682
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,520
year plus some

683
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,520
so i like a machine that pays for itself

684
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,600
that's my whole thing and it's quiet

685
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,280
it's quiet in the morning in case you

686
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,640
got you know family or something you

687
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,720
don't want to wake up and you don't want

688
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,520
to run a loud machine this one's really

689
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,919
quiet

690
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,679
but my deal is like i like i like

691
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,840
knowing i have a machine that's

692
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,360
paying for itself and that's what i like

693
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,320
knowing so it's like what you're paying

694
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,720
for yourself

695
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,559
that's pretty awesome and this machine

696
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,039
for me has already paid for itself

697
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:46,000
over and over and over again but you

698
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:48,240

how cool is that

873
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,520
uh sabine says how do you store the

874
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:20,320
celery when you pre-washed it

875
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,760
you know what i do i take i take a like

876
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:25,360
a dish washing cloth

877
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:28,480
like a dry clean one and after i wash

878
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:30,720
the celery i kind of just wrap it in it

879
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,840
and just wrap it in it i got one right

880
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,840
here you guys

881
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,039
that's the cloth right here so what i do

882
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,279
is i pre-wash it

883
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:38,799
and i wrap it in there like that and you

884
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,159
know put a big hunk of it

885
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,000
just like you see all the celery right

886
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,200
here and i put it in the fridge and i

887
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,559
just have it sitting there it's going to

888
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,120
be in there for a day

889
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:48,559
or two right that's one way to do it

890
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,080
there's other ways you guys can come up

891
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:52,080
with your own way of doing it too

892
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,080
i mean there's other ways you can also

893
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:56,159
do you have a damp cloth wrapped around

894
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,840
it which is a great way of doing it too

895
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,679
there's nothing wrong with that at all

896
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,559
so yeah so

897
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:04,159
um anyway so the bottom line okay

898
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,039
medical media podcast did you check out

899
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,880
the caffeine

900
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:08,960
episode link is in the description have

901
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,600
you done the meditations

902
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,159
and have you shared them have you shared

903
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,360
them

904
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:16,159
um lorraine l says brain meditation is

905
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,880
otherworldly

906
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:19,279
that's the greatest compliment like i

907
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,919
could

908
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:23,840
get because you know i don't know if you

909
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,720
guys know but i'm discriminated against

910
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,039
because of

911
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,320
my source of spirit of compassion since

912
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:30,399
i was age four

913
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,080
and when i was age four and spirit of

914
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,960
compassion started speaking to me which

915
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,880
people are like well

916
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,559
wait a minute what is that how does that

917
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,919
work and the millions have actually

918
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:39,600
healed around the world because of the

919
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:42,720
medical medium information

920
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:44,399
and and when you when like lorraine when

921
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,919
you know that it's otherworldly because

922
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:49,200
it's not man-made like

923
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,840
i'm not me i can't make a meditation

924
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,880
like that

925
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:56,159
like i can't and it comes from above

926
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,120
so it works it's not hit or miss it it

927
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,799

it's not good for you that's just not

990
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:57,600
really

991
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:58,960
like that's not helping really anybody

992
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:02,240
but it's another

993
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:04,000
to say here's why you should probably

994
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,679
get off your caffeine

995
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,440
listen to the episode so you can just

996
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:10,799
your mind just blow like

997
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:13,120
bro like right that information comes in

998
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:14,799
and you know like okay here's what's

999
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,760
going on well what can i do

1000
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:19,200
what can i do now you know aw you told

1001
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,080
me what's going on with caffeine what

1002
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:24,320
can i do

1003
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:27,039
well then tools to restore

1004
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:28,159
and that caffeine sits in that emotional

1005
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:30,000
center of the brain

1006
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:32,159
it attaches itself to all kinds of

1007
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,120
neurotransmitters attaches itself

1008
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:36,399
to neurons sits in there a long time

1009
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,240
just causes a lot of trouble

1010
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:40,880
withdrawal becomes impossible for most

1011
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:43,840
people do something about it if you want

1012
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,840
that's the whole point

1013
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:47,919
sharon says celery juice kills my

1014
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:48,640
stomach just a tiny little tiny little

1015
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:50,080
bit

1016
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,679
tiny a little bit if you want talk to

1017
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,519
your doctor about it if you're concerned

1018
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:56,080
or anything we could do a tiny little

1019
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:57,840
tiny little bit of it and because what

1020
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,760
that celery juice does it's so

1021
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:02,720
healing in so many ways it kills off

1022
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:05,679
bacteria in people's guts bad bacteria

1023
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,440
kills off pathogens and viruses so you

1024
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,960
know so that's the whole thing

1025
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,640
and that's what's so powerful about it

1026
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,080
you can also you know you can also just

1027
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,480

1057
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,840
one that did it

1059
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,880
like oh yeah and oh yeah you know yeah

1060
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,600
it's

1061
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,559
packed with information it's packed with

1062
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:18,799
information

1063
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:21,360
and and i'm honored you're listening um

1064
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:23,679
so vegan sabina says coffee is a drug

1065
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:26,080
it's pretty intense stuff i mean

1066
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:26,960
it's print caffeine is pretty intense

1067
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:30,000
stuff and

1068
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:33,600
we get trapped in it and stuck to it

1069
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,120
and married to it and attached to it

1070
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,640
so it's really tricky you know it's

1071
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:39,519
really tricky and getting off of it

1072
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:41,600
it's another story but i got the mm-900

1073
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,480
hds right here so this is the model that

1074
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,720
i use

1075
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,159
my favorite model my favorite company

1076
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,279
but this is the one that squeezes every

1077
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:50,399
last bit of juice

1078
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,960
out of those stocks i personally save

1079
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:52,960
money

1080
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,039
from using this machine it's paid for

1081
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,640
itself over and over again

1082
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:58,960
you know and because when people say

1083
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,880
well juicers are expensive well this one

1084
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,240
it really isn't that expensive at all

1085
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,399
compared to some of the juicers out

1086
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:07,760
there oh my god they're off the charts

1087
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:10,159
and this one pays for itself and it's 60

1088
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,800
off right now 20 off like it's it's

1089
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,800
crazy

1090
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,399
so but this is the one that i like to

1091
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,560
use because i save money

1092
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:19,040
but i know i'm saving money by the end

1093
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:22,159

00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,800
platform in which i launched

1113
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,639
the medical medium podcast all the other

1114
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,280
platforms little pits and bits and

1115
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,280
pieces

1116
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,200
will be kind of taken out and everything

1117
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,920
and you know it's going to be

1118
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,560
just you know not going to be what it is

1119
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,320
so you want to

1120
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,320
want to listen to that apple podcast

1121
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,800
margaret valentine how is that different

1122
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:13,280
from the other omega juicers

1123
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,960
this one's specific for celery juice you

1124
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,359
can use it for other things too

1125
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:19,520
but it's specific for celery juice so it

1126
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:22,240
actually has in this control

1127
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,119
right here it actually has a tool in

1128
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:26,400
here

1129
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:29,520
okay that allows you to squeeze

1130
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,000
every last drop practically out of there

1131
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,800
i mean it's

1132
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,839
amazing just amazing as far as like dry

1133
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,640
to the bone

1134
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:37,680
and you use less celery because of it

1135
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,000
and

1136
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,680
i haven't found that experience and i've

1137
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,160
i've purchased

1138
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,880
every juicer that's in this realm and

1139
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,960
even above

1140
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,359
meaning price wise to be like okay i

1141
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,880
just i'm biting i'm biting let me do it

1142
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:52,320
they're trying you know you go in there

1143
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,359
you look for different juicers like

1144
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,040
what's this company do and they're

1145
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,720
selling some juicer let me get it

1146
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,079
and then you're like what i'm killing

1147
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:00,240
myself to clean it

1148
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,839
and then at the top not this juicer but

1149
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,480
trying other juicers and killing myself

1150
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:03,599
to clean them

1151
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,599
and then it's not squeezing all the

1152
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,119
juice out of them and then i'm like

1153
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:09,040
it's costing me money to juice celery

1154
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:10,240
it's like what this makes no sense this

1155
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,680
is the one i believe in

1156
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,079
but just use the juicer you love it's

1157
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:17,440
it's perfectly fine you guys know that

1158
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:20,079
um sandra says it produces more juice

1159
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:22,000
than some of the others i've noticed yes

1160
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:24,800
sandra it does

1161
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,400
it does it's that's what i love about it

1162
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,760
i love about it so

1163
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,760
and you know it's like everybody's

1164
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:32,320
always asking me what juicer i use

1165
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,760
but i'm like okay well you use sour

1166
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,400
juice to get off caffeine let's just

1167
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,480
like

1168
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,400
juice some celery so everybody has like

1169
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,440
they can see like wait a minute i can

1170
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,560
get off caffeine

1171
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:44,480
i can do this susan darling hey how are

1172
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,040
you after juicing celery juice for a

1173
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,920
week

1174
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:50,079
i could not tolerate caffeine so celery

1175
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:52,320
juice made me want to come off caffeine

1176
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:53,599
i'll tell you why that's really cool

1177
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,720
i'll tell you why

1178
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:58,480
because it's a complete electrolyte so

1179
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:00,000
the trace mineral salts the subgroup of

1180
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,079
sodium that it has okay

1181
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,280
sodium cluster salts i talk about in the

1182
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:06,079
medical medium books

1183
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,359
go to the brain to where you're caffeine

1184
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:10,000
dependent

1185
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:10,640
so we get caffeine dependent in the

1186
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,079
brain

1187
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,240
that's what happens we get cathy

1188
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:16,880
dependent and we get caffeine dependent

1189
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,359
in the emotional center of the brain and

1190
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,200
then

1191
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:20,560
we're like oh my god we're in trouble

1192
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,680
when you get off that caffeine we're

1193
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:24,160
like withdrawal

1194
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,720
we just we get emotional we start losing

1195
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,440
it

1196
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:29,599
we all of that and so what the celery

1197
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:32,079
just does it's trading off

1198
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:33,280
it's also putting something back into

1199
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:35,599
you that caffeine

1200
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,720
sucking out of you and it's really an

1201
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:39,920
amazing thing so

so yeah and i'm so proud of you guys so

1297
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:45,920
this is this is the deal

1298
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,520
is that when i get up in the morning i

1299
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,359
don't have a lot of time

1300
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,960
i'm working on the podcast trying to get

1301
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:53,119
you guys episodes

1302
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,880
i'm working on the book the next book to

1303
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:58,240
deliver you guys

1304
00:40:54,880 --> 00:41:00,560
and i'm just i'm working 20 hours a day

1305
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:02,240
right now and getting probably three to

1306
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:05,599
four hours of sleep some night so

1307
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:08,720
i'm working 20 hours a day and

1308
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:09,599
i don't have time to spend all this time

1309
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,359
cleaning and

1310
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:13,040
juicing and all that so i like this

1311
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:14,160
model because of that it just saves me

1312
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:17,520
time and a whole bit

1313
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:19,200
um you know start if you if you have a

1314
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:22,560
lot of symptoms you can always start

1315
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:23,760
slow with the celery juice

1316
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,359
if you got a lot of symptoms you could

1317
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,599
always start slow you don't have to do

1318
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:29,119
32 ounces you don't have to do 30 ounces

1319
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,160
you don't have to do 28 ounces start

1320
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:31,760
slow if you want

1321
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,520
you can do that you guys can do that

1322
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:36,640
start with four ounces you can do that

1323
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,640
as well start with four ounces

1324
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,280
you can definitely do that nothing wrong

1325
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:44,720
at all but what it does is

1326
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:46,240
celery juice is a pathogen killer

1327
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:48,079
so what it does is it breaks down

1328
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,920
membranes and pathogens

1329
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:51,599
the membrane around pathogens and it

1330
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,880
starts to weaken them

1331
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:55,440
and that's what's incredible and people

1332
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:57,280
are sick because of epstein-barr viruses

1333
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,800
cytomegalovirus shingles virus they're

1334
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,440
sick because of streptococcus different

1335
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,800
kinds of

1336
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,200
you know bacteria they're sick from all

1337
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:05,839
this stuff i talk about it all the time

1338

juicer it pays for itself to me that

1493
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:55,280
matters

1494
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,359
and because i've used every juicer out

1495
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,800
there and um

1496
00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:01,920
check out the medical mean podcast at

1497
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:04,319
apple podcast link is in the description

1498
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:05,680
and dorothy says how much coffee is too

1499
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:09,119
much dorothy you know what's

1500
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:10,079
crazy is that sometimes just a drop of

1501
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:12,319
coffee

1502
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:13,680
if someone sensitive can throw them in

1503
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:16,720
an anxiety attack

1504
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:18,240
like panic attack a drop there's people

1505
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:20,079
out there that if they smell it in a

1506
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:22,800
coffee shop

1507
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:24,319
and and they smell that caffeine and the

1508
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,760
caffeine starts going into the lungs

1509
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:27,280
into and gets to the brain and they're

1510
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,599
breathing in in their sinuses

1511
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:31,359
they literally start falling apart it

1512
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:33,040
all depends on what the person's level

1513
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:33,839
is that can handle that kind of toxin

1514
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,000
and poison

1515
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:37,599
because caffeine's a toxin and poison

1516
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,839
it's a bad toxin and poison

1517
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:41,599
so it all depends like how much coffee

1518
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:42,960
is too much some people can handle a lot

1519
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:44,559
of coffee all day long

1520
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:46,319
doesn't mean it's not robbing you of

1521
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:48,000
your youth taking from you taking your

1522
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:49,359
trace minerals taking your

1523
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,960
beating down your neurotransmitters but

1524
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:52,400
there's people out there with sensitive

1525
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,200
nervous systems and they've been through

1526
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,960
hell and back

00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:56,800

1528
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:59,839
thimble of coffee and
