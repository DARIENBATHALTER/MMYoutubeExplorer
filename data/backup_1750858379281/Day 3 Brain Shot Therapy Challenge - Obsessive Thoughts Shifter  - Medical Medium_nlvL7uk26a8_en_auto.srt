35
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:21,140
little bit of a forewarning

36
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:23,099
because it works

37
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:26,099

I'm saying that because I don't want you

39
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:29,520
caught off guard

40
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:33,360
it works

41
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:36,540
how why how is it possible

42
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:39,420
can a human being

43
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:43,140
figure out the combination

44
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:45,780
to stop obsessive thoughts

45
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,099
how is that possible no human being

46
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,440
can't

47
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:51,900
there's no doctor

48
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:55,500
there's no lawyer

49
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:58,860
there's no scientist there's no lab

50
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:02,160
technician there's no food science

51
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:04,920
person there's no podcast person there's

52
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:07,620
no person in health that can do it not

53
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:10,319
even me I can't do it or figure out how

54
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:15,300
it works it came from above

55
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:18,300
it came from above and that's how it

56
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:21,959
works right there because it can't be

57
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:25,080
done by a human they won't know it's not

58
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:28,200
possible there's no science a thousand

59
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:31,500
years from now that can say if you put

60
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:34,260
this much radish and this much celery

61
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:37,500
and this much sage and this much apple

62
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:40,799
together that you can literally start

63
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:44,580
changing and rewiring thought patterns

64
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:47,459
in here the electricity so that OCD or

65
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:50,940
obsessive thoughts starts to calm down

66
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:52,620
and starts to go away that can't be done

67
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,840
in science today

68
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:58,500
there's no

69
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:00,360
there's no Harvard grad there's no Ivy

70
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:03,000
League school grad there's no University

71
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,340
there's nowhere there's no scientist no

72
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,720
one can figure out that when you put

73
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,940
Apple

74
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,459
celery in the right amounts

75
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:14,040
radish design amounts and Sage of the

76
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:16,040
right amounts that something happens

77
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,959
some kind of chemistry happens

78
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:21,419
synergistically the combination does

79
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,040
something no one ever knew and what I

80
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:24,060
was taking down that information from

81
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,280

that's what this is no it's not

157
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:53,819
and this is information from above

158
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:58,319
putting specific combinations together

159
00:07:53,819 --> 00:08:01,440
creating a medicinal shot for specific

160
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,240
reasons no one would ever know no one on

161
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,280
this planet including me would never

162
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:08,880
know in a million years

163
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,560
that if you put this group together of

164
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:13,919
ingredients you see

165
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,620
that OCD and obsessive thoughts

166
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,000
start to calm down and dissipate and

167
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,280
disappear

168
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,319
and that's from one shot you do them

169
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,900
regularly for severe cases and

170
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,180
improvements happen improvements happen

171
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:30,060
and but nobody on the planet would ever

172
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:33,120
know this it would not even be possible

173
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:34,740
which actually goes to show us along

174
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,599
with the other medical medium books that

175
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:39,060
the information works and that's why

176
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:41,159
they're the most popular book health

177
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:43,080
book series in the world for health

178
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:45,420
there's a reason because it works but

179
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,519
the brain shot therapy is incredible

180
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:51,120

response to medicinals in liquid form

184
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,240
going directly to the brain and what

185
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:03,899
these do is they absorb quickly remember

and when I did it I felt how it went

190
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:16,860
into the mouth you'll feel that with

191
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:19,019
these you will actually feel the

192
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:21,240
difference when you do the brain shot

193
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:24,000
therapy you will feel the quick

194
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:26,640
absorption happen in your mouth you'll

195
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,820
feel it go into the cells of your mouth

196
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:32,760
it'll hit your blood vessels quick

197
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:35,459
Apples by themselves won't do that Apple

198
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:38,519
Juice by itself won't do that it won't

199
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:41,160
absorb that quick it's the combination

200
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:44,040
of the sage the Apple the radish the

201
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:46,380
celery it's the combination that makes

202
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,540
quick absorption happen

203
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:51,120
and it drives into the blood vessels and

204
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:53,040
it gets to the brain fast

205
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:56,160
Kristen says I have done brain shot

206
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:59,040
therapy so I have done brain therapy

207
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,839
shots two days now and notice how deeply

208
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,540
I am sleeping

209
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:04,740
not sure if it if it's related but makes

210
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,500
sense to me

211
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:09,540
well it's okay if you're not sure or not

212
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:12,360
but it's working and you're sleeping

213
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:15,000
deeply and that's okay you can be

214
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,800
somebody that's like wow let me try this

215
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,240
and see what it does here's what's

216
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,880
incredible

217
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,040
it could be a day later

218
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:26,220
and the incredible results start kicking

219
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:28,260
in it can be instant means it's

220
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:30,720
happening for you in the moment you may

221
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:33,660
see things within seconds you may see

and give you results the next day

224
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:42,899
or the day after but then if you do it

225
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:46,620
again and keep on doing it again it

226
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:49,800
builds on itself you guys it builds upon

227
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:52,380
itself making more profound effects

228
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:54,959

229
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:57,240

absorbable in the mouth that's one of

235
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,540
the big things right there the valuable

236

healing components of all of these gets

driven into the brain quick

238
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:19,860
the brain gets them fast

239
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:22,980
big part of it and then it's the

240
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:25,079
combination the specific combination

241
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:27,120
synergistically combined that gets to

242
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:29,279
the brain really quick it does its thing

243
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,720
once it gets to the brain that's a whole

244
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,540
other thing now these are special

245
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,600
configurations synergistically combined

246
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:38,220
just to crack the code

247
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,800
of how

248
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:42,839
these Godly ingredients right these

249

ingredients can get to our brain

251
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:52,260
this shot was so delicious and helped me

252
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:53,700
to follow sleep for real fall asleep for

253
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:57,120

254
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:58,920
I'm for real I did it yesterday evening

255
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,980
amazing

256
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:03,540
incredible so you guys

257
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,560
we're just going to read a little bit

258
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,540
more

259
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,339
while Creative Juice concoctions out

260
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:10,620
there offer their benefits right because

261
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:14,040
their juices

262
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:15,540
it isn't what this is so if you take a

263
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,560
whole bunch of stuff I'm gonna juice I'm

264
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:18,839
gonna get into juice I'm gonna put

265
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,279
apples I'm gonna put carrots in here I'm

266
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:22,760
gonna put all this stuff and I'm gonna

267
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:25,260
juice whatever it's not the same thing

268
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:28,260
entirely different

269
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:30,839
that's the key

270
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:33,300
the healing shots of the medical medium

271
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:35,940
brain shot therapy are tools that come

272
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:37,320
from above I can't say it enough but

273
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,540
it's important to know and it's

274
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,519
important to know why they work

275
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:43,980
you can't give me I I can't get the

276
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,139
credit when it's from above

277
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,880
because I would never know how to put

278
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:50,579
that together it's not even possible

279
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:52,380
nobody no scientist no one can

280
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:54,240
the healing shots of medical medium

281
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:57,180
brain shot therapy are tools that come

282
00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:00,180
from above these brain shots are

283
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:01,579
composed of specific combinations of

284
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:05,399
ingredients that work together

285
00:13:01,579 --> 00:13:09,180
systematically for reasons Precision

286
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:11,339
reasons only a source above can know

287
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:13,440
Rhonda said I was having a really rough

288
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:14,940
morning the other day and tried the

289
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,519
obsessive thought shifter which we're

290
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:20,399
doing today and it changed my entire day

291
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:23,160
I noticed it changed quickly I had such

292
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:25,560
a beautiful calm come over me

293
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:28,980
Kimberly says my little girl has had her

294
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:31,920
life debilitated by OCD since she was a

295
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:34,860
toddler oh my God probably earlier she

296
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:38,399
knows all about Anthony and SOC we

297
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:40,800
started the OCD shot yesterday she calls

298
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:43,860
it her angel juice

299
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:46,560
because she knows there is no doctor

300
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:48,480
that knows how to help her we still pray

301
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:51,540
to the unknown angels as well incredible

302
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:54,180

these combos how they don't cause me any

368
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:25,560
nausea incredible and I'm finding that

369
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:27,600
too as far as the gentle nature of them

370
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:29,940
as I'm doing them

371
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,820
they're so gentle at the same time

372
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:34,920
potent and Powerful life-changing but

reading out of the brain saver book

402
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,360
right here

403
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:46,500
so

404
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,840
emotional injury

405
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:51,480
really interesting section inside the

406
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:54,600
brain saver book emotional injury

407
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:57,299
when we say we've had emotional wounds

408
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:59,160
and Scar scars in life

409
00:17:57,299 --> 00:18:01,140
this description is more accurate than

410
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,000
we know so when we say like I'm I've

411
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:05,460
been emotionally hurt

412
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:09,299
I have an emotional wound

413
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:12,240
when we say that it's real

414
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:15,780
a lot of people don't give the person

415
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:18,840
validation for an emotional wound

416
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:20,580
like if you've been emotionally hurt

417
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:23,160
it's real

418
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:25,140
you're emotionally hurt I know that a

419
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:27,480
lot of people want to shake it off they

420
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:29,220
don't want to believe it's real a lot of

421
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:31,980
people won't give anybody the validation

422
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:33,960
about emotional hurt right but when

423
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:35,160
someone says hey I've been emotionally

424
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,919
hurt

425
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:40,380
it's actually more real than anybody

426
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,059
knows so when we say we've had emotional

427
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:45,059
wounds like I've had an emotional wound

428
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:46,080
in my life I got an emotional scar in my

429
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:48,780
life

430
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,700
somebody like what what is that it's

431
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:53,100
actually true

432
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:56,100
the description is more accurate when we

433
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:57,539
say I've been burned before have you

434
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,580
ever said that I've been burned before

435
00:18:57,539 --> 00:19:01,039
I've said that in my life man I've been

436
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:04,260
burned

437
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:05,520
I've been burned bad on that one do you

438
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,660
ever say that in your life like I've

439
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,700
been burned

440
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:10,080
we really mean it

441
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:13,260
it's real

442
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,960
we really mean it that's because when we

443
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:17,700
go through

444
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:20,039
upsetting and traumatizing experiences

445
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:22,440
we can experience physical injury in the

446
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:24,840
emotional centers of the brain so in the

447
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:28,020
emotional centers of the brain you guys

448
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:29,580
we can experience real physical injuries

449
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:31,620
now why am I even talking about this

450
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:33,380
because obsessive thought shifter is

451
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:36,600
healing

452
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:40,200
these injuries

453
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:43,140
a lot of times OCD or obsessive thoughts

454
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,760
occur from an injury your boyfriend

455
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:47,280
breaks up with you or your boyfriend

456
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:49,559
cheats on you and you can't stop

457
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,660
thinking about it your girlfriend cheats

458
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:54,559
on you and you can't stop thinking about

459
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:56,820
it and you're laying up all night long

460
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:58,799
wrecked by it

461
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,960
because the obsessive thoughts it

462
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:03,720
becomes obsessive

463
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,940
I I better drive by my girlfriend's

464
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,340
house I better drive by my boyfriend's

465
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,179
house I better drive by my partner's

466
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:12,539
house

467
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:14,580
because you're obsessed you've been hurt

468
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:15,900
I better check my boyfriend's phone I

469
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,940
better check my girlfriend's phone

470
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:20,220
because are they cheating on me that's

471
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:21,900
happened so many times to people and

472
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,820
what happens is that obsessive thought

473
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:25,679
really cranks up because there's an

474
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:29,760
injury that occurs

475
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:33,000
we actually get injured

476
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:35,220
that's just one example of hundreds of

477
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,220
examples of how people get emotionally

478
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:40,380
injured right that's just one

479
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:42,179
we can ex we can experience physical

480
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:44,820
injuries in the emotional center of the

481
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:49,020
brain from any kind of hurt or any kind

482
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:52,140
of upset anything traumatizing losses

483
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:55,440
anything struggles

484
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:57,900
anything that we go through in life

485
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,820
we can get injured but nobody talks

486
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:02,760
about this real injuries happen inside

487
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:05,760
the emotional centers of the brain real

488
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:07,799
injuries occur what I'm saying is even

489
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,440
if it's on the mildest injury the

490
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:12,780
mildest form the most gentle mildest

491
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:15,000
form of injury we can still get the

492
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:17,520
obsessive thoughts

493
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,500
we can still get the OCD we can still

494
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:22,980
get these things now you can get OCD

495
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:24,960
without an emotional blow I want to make

496
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:26,280
that clear

497
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,340
because

498
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:31,919
serious cases of OCD

499
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:33,720
come from the toxic heavy metals but

500
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,900
what I love about the obsessive thought

501
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:40,559
shifter it rewires the brain so we can

502
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:43,799
move around those Metals we can move the

503
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:47,640
electricity around those Metals so when

504
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:50,159
we have OCD and we're suffering from OCD

505
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:52,740
like repetitive thoughts that you have

506
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:55,260
to act on that you feel compelled to act

507
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:58,080
on right those are toxic heavy metals

508
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:59,880
creating that variety of OCD

509
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,940
the reason why the obsessive thought

510
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:06,179
shifter works is because a spirit of

511
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:09,059
compassion knew what to put together to

512
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:11,940
give somebody that instant relief to

513
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:13,440
re-route that electricity inside the

514
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:16,500
brain

515
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:19,140
so that someone can get relief until

516
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:21,240
they can do like get the medals out

517
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,740
until they can do other medical medium

518
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:26,220
tools

519
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:28,620
so the obsessive thought shifter is

520
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:31,200
geared for somebody struggling with

521
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:33,299
obsessive thoughts whether they have a

522
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,520
severe case of OCD where they're at they

523
00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:39,539
have to be compelled to act

524
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:42,120
on what their repetitive thoughts are

525
00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:43,980
because that's serious heavy metal heavy

526
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:47,220
metal toxicity

527
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:50,539
so the obsessive thought shifter

528
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:53,280
what that does is it rewires electricity

529
00:22:50,539 --> 00:22:54,720
so that it can drive down to different

530
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,940
neurons

531
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,159
and get away from that spot for the

532
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:01,200
moment to break the obsessive thoughts

533
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:04,280
that's how critical this is that's how

534
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,280
important this is really

535
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:09,299
so

536
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:11,820
when it comes down to it

537
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:14,039
keep this in mind you may have you may

538
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:16,020
not have toxic heavy metals but you have

539
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:18,059
obsessive thoughts in general you've

540
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:20,820
been hurt emotionally

541
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:22,320
so that happens to a lot of people

542
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:24,240
where they have some kind of emotional

543
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:27,299
trauma to break up a relationship a

544
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:30,360
divorce or some kind of struggle or an

545
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:33,360
emotional confrontation or something has

546
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:34,980
happened to them or something like you

547
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,600
know a fire broke out or something

548
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:39,659
happened where they were traumatized

549
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:43,100
whatever it is anything we go through

550
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:45,120
on the smallest level to largest level

551
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:47,520
emotional injuries occur in blood

552
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,440
vessels and neurons inside the brain

553
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,480
and with the obsessive thought shifter

554
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:54,720
does is it's there

555
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:56,760
to actually heal blood vessels to an

556
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,520
emotional Center centers of the brain

557
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:01,799
help them heal and then reroute

558
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:04,559
electricity too so more healing can

559
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:06,960
happen which is even incredible

560
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:10,080
rise of Melton says I had a few of the

561
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:12,360
OCD shots the past few days and I

562
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,700
noticed I was able to stop the OCD

563
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:17,159
thoughts

564
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:19,080
that's how powerful it is so proud of

565
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:21,419
you by the way Bernadette says my

566
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:24,179
dizziness got instantly better

567
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:26,480
and went almost away after just a few

568
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:30,000
shots it's unbelievable and by the way

569
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,679
these shots they're healing what I what

570
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,360
what is said that Spirit of compassion

571
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,919
said in the books what I wrote down in

572
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:38,220
the books they're healing

573
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:40,620
but they they do heal other things too

574
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:42,659
with it that are connected which is

575
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:44,880
which is really incredible

576
00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:48,120
Judy says my face always tingles after

577
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:50,100
the shots and so does mine

578
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:52,799
so does mine some people their face

579
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:55,260
doesn't tingle after the shots my face

580
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:57,600
might I get tingles when I do the brain

581
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:59,460
shot Therapies

582
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,679
so um

583
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:03,600
here with Marie said I think she had a

584
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,760
comment there too I'll read so so many

585
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,980
things are happening when we do the the

586
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,419
brain shot therapies so many things that

587
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,080
are healing so let me read on a little

588
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:12,240
bit

589
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,100
Patricia says hello I'm so happy I did

590
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,860
last night with my husband you say he

591
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:20,400
did a brain shot he does not believe but

592
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:21,780
he felt a big change he doesn't have to

593
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,539
believe

594
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:26,640
in the shifters

595
00:25:24,539 --> 00:25:28,320
right and the exposure shots and the

596
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,880
stabilizer shots he doesn't have to

597
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,620
believe in medical medium he doesn't

598
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:34,260
have to believe in me

599
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:38,100
doesn't have to have any any faith in me

600
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:39,539
or believe that I have anything to offer

601
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:41,580
but when

602
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:44,700
he does the shots he's gonna feel it

603
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:46,799
when you do the shots you'll feel it

604
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:50,159
see here's a question here a comment we

605
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:52,740
already tried this shot and it is so

606
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:55,620
delicious and it works I felt then much

607
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:58,260
better much more energy than ever

608
00:25:55,620 --> 00:26:00,000
and what's incredible is if you like the

609
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:01,500
taste of the shot it's it's a plus

610
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,580
remember with Spirit of compassion I

611
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,320
said it's Spirit compassion No One's

612
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:05,760
Gonna like the taste of these shots

613
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,559
I remember writing them down I was

614
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:10,020
sitting at my desk I was like

615
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:12,299
I was like sfc No One's Gonna like the

616
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:14,700
taste or flavors of these shots these

617
00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:17,100
are not put together for fun these are

618
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:18,480
not put together for taste

619
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:20,700
Spirit of compassion said they're not

620
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,500
supposed to be for fun and taste if you

621
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:25,559
have fun doing them if you have fun

622
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:29,159
drinking them then that's an added Plus

623
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:30,960
they're to work that means someone might

624
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:32,700
not like the flavor someone might think

625
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,559
it's okay someone might think it's me

626
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:36,179
oat mediocre someone might think it's

627
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:38,159
absolutely disgusting and someone might

628
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:42,539
think it tastes great

629
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:44,880
but it's not there for the delicious

630
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:46,860
thing about it the delicious part about

631
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,900
it like the concoctions are made to be

632
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:51,120
flavorable and fun right that's not what

633
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:53,400
it is this is about medicine from above

634
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,620
medicinals from above fixing and

635
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:58,140
rewiring actual brain problems real

636
00:26:55,620 --> 00:27:00,380
problems with the brain and nervous

637
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,380
system

638
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:05,520
and that's what it was about so it's not

639
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:07,799
about how good they taste but if they

640
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:10,140
taste good to you for I'm going to just

641
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:11,580
be straight out here some of them I just

642
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:13,799
don't like the flavor

643
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:16,980
but I like what it does

644
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:20,480
but I don't like the flavor like I

645
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:20,480
I did a couple of them and I was like

646
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:26,640
but yeah I like what it's doing for me

647
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:29,039
does the mm obsessive shot help with

648
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,140
obsessive actions as well

649
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:33,179
yes it does

650
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:35,340
it does and stories are coming through

651
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:37,020
about that all over the place for sure

652
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:38,580
it's really incredible

653
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:40,320
so let me read a little bit about what's

654
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:41,700
happening in here so this is so

655
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,620
important

656
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:45,179
when we go through an upsetting or

657
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:46,620
traumatizing experience we can

658
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:48,659
experience physical injuries in the

659
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:51,299
emotional centers of the brain from the

660
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:55,380
intense heat generated that's the thing

661
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:58,080
something happens he is generating brain

662
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:59,220
heat our heat our brain starts to burn

663
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,779
up

664
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:03,539
it does

665
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:05,460
when we're showing emotions on the

666
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:07,620
outside or not you don't even have to be

667
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:09,960
reacting you could be so pissed off or

668
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:11,700
upset and internally you feel it and

669
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:14,520
your brain is heating up and that's the

670
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:16,640
thing that burning and heating confuse

671
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:19,440
brain tissue right that's what happens

672
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,000
and then we get in trouble we have all

673
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,179
kinds of different emotional symptoms

674
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,460
and other symptoms

675
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:28,320
these brain wounds can then influence

676
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:29,880
how we think feel and behave and that's

677
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,220
another thing when we get injured

678
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:34,620
emotionally then these wounds in the

679
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:37,440
brain can actually alter how we think

680
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:39,059
behave and feel this I'm reading you

681
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,860
guys right out of the brain saver books

682
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:42,120
I hope you have one get one as soon as

683
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:44,220
you can

684
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:48,840
here's a section right here scorched

685
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:51,000
brain tissue scorched brain tissue

686
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:53,279
for example when you're lying in bed

687
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,880
fixated on something hurtful someone

688
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:59,460
said or some misjustice that occurred

689
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,980
that was out of your control or a hurt

690
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:03,600
you experience from betrayal in a

691
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:06,539
relationship and the hurt feels

692
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:09,960
impossible to resolve so it takes over

693
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:11,279
your mind and dominates your thoughts

694
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,900
so if there's been some kind of

695
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:14,400
misjustice it could be small in your

696
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,960
life but it could dominate your thoughts

697
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,340
and take over and then the brain heat

698
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,440
happens

699
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:22,740
Kendra says my body craves these juices

700
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:25,500
shot shots but I don't have an intense

701
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:28,080
reaction like other people report am I

702
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:30,360
doing something wrong I feel more so

703
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:33,240
than I am getting slightly better long

704
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:36,419
term with each shot and my appetite has

705
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:38,220
decreased but I do not have a strong or

706
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:39,720
immediate relief thank you so much for

707
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:41,700
all you do

708
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:43,919
so Kendra so what you're doing is you

709
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:45,299
are experiencing some some symptom

710
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,640
relief or you're experiencing

711
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:49,919
improvements so that's what's happening

712
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:51,419
right there you said you feel you feel

713
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,399
more as you're getting slightly better

714
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:55,020
long term with the shots and that's

715
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:56,460
incredible but that's what you needed

716
00:29:55,020 --> 00:30:00,299
and that's what was happening in your

717
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:03,360
body for you to have but keep in mind

718
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:05,760
they surprise you so you can be in the

719
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,320
the trajectory of actually just getting

720
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,940
better like you're doing or you've got

721
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:10,559
this longer term getting better each

722
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:12,539
shot so every time you have a shot

723
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:14,220
you're getting better and your appetite

724
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:17,279
has decreased so you're getting better

725
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:20,399
in all these ways appetite decreasing is

726
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:23,100
a good one so as you're doing that all

727
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:25,380
of a sudden a surprise comes

728
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:27,120
when you do another shot and then you

729
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:28,919
start feeling it in different ways so

730
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:31,260
things are going to happen along the way

731
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:33,120
in different on different levels plus

732
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:35,039
which shot are you using it's the same

733
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:37,679
shot all the time are you trying some

734
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:39,720
different shots too so keep up the good

735
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:43,100
work keep on doing that healing keep on

736
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:43,100
moving forward that's incredible

737
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:47,279
so

738
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,740
let's go into a little bit more about

739
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:52,260
how this works the electrical patterns

740
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:54,899
in your brain don't just swirl around

741
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:57,059
your entire brain and circulate

742
00:30:54,899 --> 00:31:00,059
part of your brain's electrical patterns

743
00:30:57,059 --> 00:31:02,460
can actually lose circulation because

744
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:04,740
the hurt that occurred has become such a

745
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:06,539
singular Focus that it is driven in

746
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:08,279
pinpointed electricity into a specific

747
00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:11,279
area this is the most one of the most

748
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:13,080
profound things the information in the

749
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:15,720
brain saver books is just mind-blowing

750
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:19,200
so listen to what this was

751
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:23,220
when you have some kind of experience

752
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:26,640
your electricity doesn't just FL free

753
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:29,100
flow everywhere in your brain

754
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:32,279
when you're having some type of

755
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:35,460
emotional upheaval or experience the

756
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:37,200
electricity gets pinpointed to a

757
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:41,580
specific area in the emotional center of

758
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:43,740
the brain and it keeps on hitting there

759
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:46,140
because your neurons where you've been

760
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:48,059
hurt is where that electricity is being

761
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:50,340
driven this is Advanced original medical

762
00:31:48,059 --> 00:31:52,799
medium information this isn't from some

763
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:54,059
Neuroscience crap or some telomere crap

764
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:56,760
or something out there because there is

765
00:31:54,059 --> 00:31:59,399
nothing out there that is like this the

766
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:02,640
information of these books is new to the

767
00:31:59,399 --> 00:32:04,320
world unique and extremely Advanced it's

768
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,820
decades and decades ahead of time it

769
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,380
could be a hundred years or more ahead

770
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:09,299
of science research

771
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:12,659
Rhonda says it's a relief to know there

772
00:32:09,299 --> 00:32:15,299
is a reason for my difficulties

773
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:17,220
and that I am not just broken it gives

774
00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:19,320
me hope you're not broken

775
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:21,059
you're not broken

776
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:23,580
no way

777
00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:24,960
no there's real reasons why we go

778
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:28,260
through what we go through There's real

779
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:30,360
reasons to what happens in our brain

780
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:32,279
real problems that happen in here

781
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:34,620
physically

782
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:37,740
so here's what goes on if you have any

783
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:40,500
kind of emotional hardship on any level

784
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:43,200
you get burnt tissue because electricity

785
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:45,480
is pinpointing to that area where the

786
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:48,299
neurons are in that emotional section

787
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:49,980
so if you had really bad relationships

788
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:53,039
there's a certain area of the brain

789
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:55,260
where that is located hurt from

790
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:57,179
relationships is in a certain area of

791
00:32:55,260 --> 00:33:00,240
the emotional center of the brain that

792
00:32:57,179 --> 00:33:03,240
means electricity in that area

793
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:05,279
only circulated in that area really

794
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:07,860
pinpointing and driving into that area

795
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:10,440
because it hurt was so bad from that

796
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:13,080
emotional hurt

797
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:16,580
and so there we get the injury

798
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:16,580
and it needs to be healed

799
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:21,240
part of your brain's electrical patterns

800
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:23,760
can actually lose circulation because

801
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:26,159
the hurt that occurred has become a

802
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:27,659
singular Focus directly pinpointing one

803
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,960
area of the emotional center of the

804
00:33:27,659 --> 00:33:29,960
brain

805
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:34,380
it can feel impossible to keep your mind

806
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,700
distracted with other thoughts in this

807
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:39,240
situation you've been hurt it's

808
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:42,600
impossible to break the thought pattern

809
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:45,559
if you went to the store and the cashier

810
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:47,100
made a mistake an honest mistake and

811
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:49,559
they

812
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:51,419
you know typed in a few extra dollars

813
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:53,220
for something that wasn't in your

814
00:33:51,419 --> 00:33:54,779
grocery bag or something like that and

815
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,980
you figured it out and was like oh my

816
00:33:54,779 --> 00:33:57,720
god

817
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:59,460
um there's 20 extra dollars that I

818
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:01,799
didn't get in here that I had to pay for

819
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:03,779
but where are my apples and where I'm or

820
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:05,640
whatever you're gonna actually focus on

821
00:34:03,779 --> 00:34:07,380
it it's gonna then keep on circulating

822
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:09,060
to that area of the brain and it's going

823
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:12,200
to pinpoint that section it's going to

824
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:12,200
become obsessive

825
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:17,820
you guys are not saying neurosciences is

826
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,679
crap out there I'm just letting you know

827
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:20,879
okay I know a lot of you guys are like

828
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,919
you come here and you're like wait a

829
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:25,080
minute I've always said neurosurgeons

830
00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:28,139
which I know an incredible neurosurgeon

831
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:30,300
I always said that brain surgeons are

832
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:31,980
needed there's a lot of incredible

833
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:34,200
doctors out there there's a lot of

834
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:37,859
incredible scientists but what happens

835
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:41,580
is that if you've been sick long enough

836
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:44,159
you know the answers aren't there

837
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:46,980
I'm just being honest about that I can't

838
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:50,040
lie and say the answers are there

839
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:52,320
I can't lie to you and say that your

840
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:54,839
20th neurologist is going to have an

841
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,760
answer for your OCD

842
00:34:54,839 --> 00:34:58,500
or for your bipolar or for your

843
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,700
depersonalization or depression or

844
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:02,339
anxiety

845
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:04,740
I can't say that Neuroscience figured

846
00:35:02,339 --> 00:35:07,859
out why someone has depression because

847
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:09,720
they haven't I can't lie and make up and

848
00:35:07,859 --> 00:35:14,160
stick up for neuroscience

849
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:17,099
I can't stand here and lie to your faces

850
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:18,839
and pretend that Neuroscience figured

851
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:20,400
out why people have Alzheimer's when

852
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:23,579
they didn't

853
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:25,500
and I can't lie to your faces and sit

854
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:27,000
here and tell you that Neuroscience has

855
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,980
all the answers

856
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,680
to why someone's suffering from

857
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:34,740
schizophrenia from Mania from psychosis

858
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:37,560
from Neurosis to depersonalization to

859
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:39,839
like crippling anxiety to all kinds I

860
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:41,760
can't I can't lie to you what am I am I

861
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:44,220
supposed to am I supposed to stick up

862
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:46,200
for Neuroscience when they don't have

863
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:49,260
the answers all the clinics don't have

864
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:51,780
the answers but guess what's crazy

865
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:55,020
is that Neuroscience takes information

866
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:57,720
from these books and then they take it

867
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:59,520
that's what's crazy medical medium was

868
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:01,680
the only place that said Alzheimer's is

869
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:03,420
caused by toxic heavy metals and now

870
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,040
Neuroscience is starting to kind of talk

871
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:07,740
about that a little but they have no

872
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:10,380
papers or research to Showcase they got

873
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:12,300
it from published material

874
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:13,859
science has taken the multiple sclerosis

875
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:15,960
information from me that I published

876
00:36:13,859 --> 00:36:19,020
years ago about Epstein-Barr the point

877
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:20,520
is is that what am I supposed to do I

878
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:22,920
know that somebody got upset about the

879
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:24,480
Neuroscience comment but am I supposed

880
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:26,099
to sit here and pretend Neuroscience has

881
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,500
all the answers and lie to you that's

882
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:31,560
insane that's actually demented

883
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:33,599
I published in great details out there

884
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:35,540
about what happened with MS and

885
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:39,359
Epstein-Barr and great details about

886
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:41,280
Alzheimer's and toxic heavy metals and

887
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:43,560
science doesn't have any of that to

888
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,780
offer out there but it's here and it

889
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:47,280
gets poached and you guys know that but

890
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:48,660
I know that somebody got upset about the

891
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,339
Neuroscience thing and it breaks my

892
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:53,099
heart because I'm

893
00:36:50,339 --> 00:36:54,720
I know that when someone's really sick

894
00:36:53,099 --> 00:36:56,280
and they and they're going to

895
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:59,339
neurologists and they're getting their

896
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:01,079
50th MRI on their brain and they're on

897
00:36:59,339 --> 00:37:03,000
all these antidepressants and they're

898
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:05,700
suffering that there's no answers out

899
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,400
there and a telomere a telomere theory

900
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:09,780
is not going to fix them

901
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:11,760
schizophrenia Mania depression anxiety

902
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:13,200
OCD Eating Disorders they're all in the

903
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,540
brain saver books right here with

904
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:19,020
detailed information so that you know

905
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:21,720
what to do but the painful thing is am I

906
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:23,280
supposed to just lie and so you guys

907
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:24,660
Neuroscience has it all sewed up they

908
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,099
have all the answers out there go to

909
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:28,079
your best clinic and they'll have all

910
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:30,180
the answers are you kidding I can't do

911
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:32,220
that I can't lie to your faces like that

912
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:34,200
so I have to be honest and if it and

913
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:36,720
that Honesty hurts you

914
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:38,400
I don't know what to do I I don't know

915
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,260
what to do I would take one of these

916
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,520
brain shots if the honesty hurts you I'd

917
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:44,400
go and take one of these brain shots

918
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:48,000
you'll see there's 30 shots

919
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:50,220
Robin said Robinson said no the truth is

920
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,960
important and it's true they don't have

921
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:53,579
the answers

922
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:56,099
they don't and you know what I noticed

923
00:37:53,579 --> 00:37:57,839
is even the theorists all the you know

924
00:37:56,099 --> 00:38:00,240
the people that are theorizing about

925
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:02,220
Neuroscience beliefs where they're just

926
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:04,560
like talking about all this grandioso

927
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:06,180
ideas about neuroscience and people's

928
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,920
thought patterns and stuff where does

929
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:10,260
that get anybody when

930
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:12,240
does that get anybody

931
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:15,720
when your child's suffering went from

932
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:17,760
crippling OCD or a mom is suffering from

933
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:19,800
crippling depression where does that get

934
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,660
anybody I I don't understand we need

935
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:25,020
answers we need things we need answers

936
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:29,640
now and it's critical

937
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:31,560
Bree says do I follow yes they do my I

938
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:34,079
follow my father regularly to the

939
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:38,040
neurologist for his Parkinson's and he

940
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:39,300
can never give my father an answer

941
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:41,460
well the thing is they don't have

942
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:44,040
answers for Parkinson's but Parkinson's

943
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:46,079
answers are in the brand saver books and

944
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:47,520
we have to do something now we have to

945
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:50,880
change lives we have to get people

946
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:52,980
better so I'm sorry I'm sorry you guys

947
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,660
anybody out there that got hurt if I say

948
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:57,300
Neuroscience is crap I get it it

949
00:38:54,660 --> 00:39:00,180
probably sounds I get it I sound

950
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:03,000
probably I don't know sarcastic and and

951
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:06,540
too you know I sound like ridiculous

952
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:09,300
saying it that way and and the irony is

953
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:11,460
I know really good brain surgeon can

954
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:12,900
really help with somebody's aneurysm and

955
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:14,579
and it depending on where it is in the

956
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:16,680
brain they could only do so much brain

957
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:18,060
surgeons they can only touch upon the

958
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:20,520
outside of the brain a little bit they

959
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:22,920
can't do too much but the point is it

960
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:24,660
saves lives like good brain surgeon save

961
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,940
lives car injuries and stuff like that

962
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:28,980
all kinds of stuff car accidents but I'm

963
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:31,020
talking about all the mystery stuff

964
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:32,099
and I'm talking about all the millions

965
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,720
and millions of people actually the

966
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:35,880
billions on this planet that can't even

967
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:38,400
function because of their brain fog's

968
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:39,480
really bad and the depression anxiety is

969
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,859
so bad

970
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,900
and

971
00:39:40,859 --> 00:39:45,180
I get it I would probably not have the

972
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:48,900
right to say that Neuroscience is crap

973
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:51,420
if people didn't heal already from all

974
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:53,280
the amazing books from from above the

975
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:56,460
medical lean books so I want to read a

976
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:58,740
little bit more if you guys got a second

977
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:00,359
so

978
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:02,820
so here's an important point right here

979
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:05,099
all on its own it can feel impossible to

980
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:07,920
keep your mind distracted when our

981
00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:09,599
thoughts are just taking over right to

982
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,339
Simply change your brain's electrical

983
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:14,640
patterns back to normal circulation

984
00:40:11,339 --> 00:40:16,619
because the emotional injury has been so

985
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,420
shocking so it's hard to switch gears

986
00:40:16,619 --> 00:40:20,579
right it's like I got this emotional

987
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:22,859
blow I'm going to try to go outside and

988
00:40:20,579 --> 00:40:24,180
walk it off my boyfriend broke up with

989
00:40:22,859 --> 00:40:26,180
me and I'm going to try to get on the

990
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:28,500
treadmill and do a really good workout

991
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:30,119
my you know girlfriend broke up with me

992
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:33,240
so I'm gonna go to the gym with the boys

993
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:35,940
and just try to push some weights you

994
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:38,400
know my whatever my doctor told me this

995
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:40,320
something ridiculous I feel hopeless so

996
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,000
I'm gonna go and buy an ice cream

997
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:44,940
somewhere and try to break my thoughts

998
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,940
like whatever happens like all of us do

999
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:49,320
different things right whatever happens

1000
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:52,140
it's hard to break those thought

1001
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:54,660
patterns when we're hurt in some way

1002
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:56,880
so that hurtful experience can become an

1003
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:59,099
obsessive cycle that can replay over and

1004
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:03,060
over and over again in your mind

1005
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:06,359
and then cauterization occurs from the

1006
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:08,579
intense heat generated in one area

1007
00:41:06,359 --> 00:41:11,339
and that's why we get in trouble this

1008
00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:13,800
intense heat generates in one area and

1009
00:41:11,339 --> 00:41:16,020
then we're stuck and then we got the

1010
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:17,460
obsessive thoughts and then we got the

1011
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:19,440
emotional hurt

1012
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:21,060
and then we're in a difficult situation

1013
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,859
we can have a little bit of depression

1014
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:25,140
we can have depersonalization we can

1015
00:41:22,859 --> 00:41:28,140
have it all and then we can have that

1016
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:30,540
emotional injury that no one understands

1017
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:33,060
that no doctor understands and no

1018
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:34,800
scientist understands and no drug

1019
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:38,880
company understands and we just don't

1020
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:42,060
know what to do and we're stuck but

1021
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:45,359
we're getting out of that Inky says yes

1022
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:47,520
they fixed my aneurysm but mm fixed my

1023
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:50,280
crippling anxiety because the experts

1024
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:52,320
had no answers incredible I'm so glad

1025
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:54,900
you're here and that's so true because

1026
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:56,940
and I'm so glad that that you're getting

1027
00:41:54,900 --> 00:42:00,119
answers and I'm so glad that yes

1028
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:01,920
conventional exactly fixture your

1029
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:03,540
aneurysm and I know brain surgeons like

1030
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,640
I said one particular that actually does

1031
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:08,339
a good job with that let's see my

1032
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:11,400
neurologist didn't have any answers all

1033
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:14,880
they did was put me on meds when I said

1034
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:18,180
how do I get off these meds they said

1035
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:21,420
try try taking you off and see if you

1036
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:23,599
think the comment went up see if you get

1037
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,599
better

1038
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:29,040
um and if not we'll up your dose that's

1039
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:30,599
what the answer is the comment so that's

1040
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,579
incredible I've heard that so many times

1041
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:33,960
where they don't have an answer to why

1042
00:42:32,579 --> 00:42:35,640
you're suffering or struggling and then

1043
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:37,619
they say Hey you know take these meds

1044
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:39,420
okay we can lower the dosage and see and

1045
00:42:37,619 --> 00:42:42,480
then up the dosage and say

1046
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:44,760
I tried weaning myself off meds without

1047
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,740
my doctor's permission symptoms didn't

1048
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:49,079
change until I started implementing

1049
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:50,700
medical meaning protocols have been off

1050
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:53,760
pills for one and a half years

1051
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:56,579
symptom-free incredible

1052
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:59,040
absolutely incredible and the amazing

1053
00:42:56,579 --> 00:43:02,400
thing is I don't see that other places

1054
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:05,160
I don't I don't see that out there I see

1055

00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:37,920
it's your free will it's your intention

1110
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,819
to want to heal that's a big part of it

1111
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,700
all

1112
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:44,180
because it's you it's you using your

1113
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:46,859
free will and your intention to project

1114
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:49,079
anything out of your brain that

1115
00:45:46,859 --> 00:45:51,180
shouldn't be there to rewire your brain

1116
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:54,000
as well so it's your intentions your

1117
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:58,079
free will to rewire the brain that's

1118
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:00,180
critical that matters right and here's

1119
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:03,060
the incredible thing your brain Harbors

1120
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:05,819
Knowledge from the past your brain

1121
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:08,400
that's incredible your brain Harbors

1122
00:46:05,819 --> 00:46:10,920
Knowledge from the present Knowledge

1123
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:14,220
from the past your brain will Harbor

1124
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:16,500
Knowledge from the future too and you

1125
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:18,300
you tap into your intuitive psychic

1126
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:19,680
telepathic Clairvoyant skills and I've

1127
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:23,099
been saying that over and over again for

1128
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:26,460
a reason the brain shot Therapies

1129
00:46:23,099 --> 00:46:29,460
help you tap into that making that

1130
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:31,319
stronger so you make good decisions in

1131
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:33,240
your life so you use your free will and

1132
00:46:31,319 --> 00:46:34,740
your intentions to make better decisions

1133
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:36,720
in your life do you ever have that

1134
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:40,260
situation you're like why did I do that

1135
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:41,819
why did I make that decision what was I

1136
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:44,520
thinking about

1137
00:46:41,819 --> 00:46:47,099
what was I thinking why did I do that

1138
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:48,960
did you ever have that happen right

1139
00:46:47,099 --> 00:46:52,380
ever like that happens to a lot of

1140
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:54,660
people it's like why did I do that oh my

1141
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:56,940
God what was I thinking

1142
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:59,099
well you know what happens here like I

1143
00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:00,720
don't know if that was a good decision I

1144
00:46:59,099 --> 00:47:02,160
don't know what what happens is when

1145
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,599
you're doing the brain shot therapy

1146
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:06,240
cleanses

1147
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:07,680
you're tapping into your intuitive

1148
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:10,200
you're psychic your telepathic your

1149
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:13,859
Clairvoyant powers that everybody has

1150
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:15,839
deep inside you're igniting that and

1151
00:47:13,859 --> 00:47:17,819
you're projecting the crap out of your

1152
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:19,980
brain that shouldn't be there and you're

1153
00:47:17,819 --> 00:47:22,859
rewiring the electricity how incredible

1154
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:24,960
is this and it matters

1155
00:47:22,859 --> 00:47:28,200
so

1156
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:30,480
let's go what are we doing here we're

1157
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:32,880
doing the obsessive thought shifter

1158
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:35,220
show you which one

1159
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:37,380
and we're going this page four

1160
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:38,819
72 right here because we're in the

1161
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:40,619
shifter shot so here's how it works

1162
00:47:38,819 --> 00:47:43,980
there's exposure shot stabilizer shots

1163
00:47:40,619 --> 00:47:46,560
and shifter shots we are in the shifters

1164
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:49,440
what I love about the shifters is they

1165
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:52,560
got a power to them that's different

1166
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:55,500
than than say the exposures when you do

1167
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:58,319
an exposure shot you feel the immediate

1168
00:47:55,500 --> 00:48:00,780
relief but it's something different that

1169
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:02,700
happens inside our brain so the reason

1170
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:04,980
why they're classified Spirit of

1171
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:07,859
compassion told me originally they do

1172
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:10,859
different instant relief fixes they do

1173
00:48:07,859 --> 00:48:14,940
different it's a different way the brain

1174
00:48:10,859 --> 00:48:17,280
heals so we're in the shifters obsessive

1175
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:19,920
thoughts shifter so that's an entirely

1176
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:21,420
different classification to help our

1177
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:25,400
brain heal

1178
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:28,619
we were doing a stabilizer yesterday

1179
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:30,599
betrayal and broken trust stabilizer

1180
00:48:28,619 --> 00:48:32,760
so you have the exposures the 10

1181
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:35,400
exposures that Spirit of compassion gave

1182
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:37,020
me the 10 stabilizers and the 10

1183
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:40,140
shifters

1184
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:42,720
so but I find that the shifters have

1185
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:44,339
their own way of working just like the

1186
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:46,319
stabilizers have their own way of

1187
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:49,079
working and just like the exposures have

1188
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:51,960
their own way of working

1189
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:54,480
the world is getting so complicated in

1190
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:56,040
so many ways and we're being pushed in

1191
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,480
so many different directions do you guys

1192
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:59,400
agree

1193
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:00,599
is that is that just Spirit of

1194
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:02,880
compassions

1195
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:05,280
like thought on that or do you guys

1196
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:07,380
agree I I mean you guys don't have to

1197
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:09,599
agree but the world is getting so

1198
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:11,400
complicated in so many ways and we're

1199
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:14,400
being pushed in so many different

1200
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:16,440
directions it's easy to get confused or

1201
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,240
stuck in a pattern that is not helpful

1202
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:20,760
to the healing process and that's easy

1203
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:23,339
right now this world is a brain screw

1204
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:25,079
right now and it can throw us into

1205
00:49:23,339 --> 00:49:27,420
getting stuck into a pattern because

1206
00:49:25,079 --> 00:49:29,579
this world is such a brain screw

1207
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:31,319
and I'm not trying to pull that like

1208
00:49:29,579 --> 00:49:33,240
thing where you got that really really

1209
00:49:31,319 --> 00:49:36,540
old guy that's like

1210
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:38,640
back in my day when I was young I had to

1211
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:40,440
walk through the snow barefooted five

1212
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:42,839
miles to get to the school when I got

1213
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:44,880
there the school teacher could stick a

1214
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:47,400
dunce hat on my head and smacked my

1215
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,420
wrist with a ruler and made me skip my

1216
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,280
lunch

1217
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:52,460
and then I had to walk five miles back

1218
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:55,020
barefooted and all the ice

1219
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:57,599
and that's what I used to have to do

1220
00:49:55,020 --> 00:50:00,060
right I'm not saying that you know

1221
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:02,280
it's just it but the world has

1222
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:05,160
definitely changed for real it's got

1223
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:06,660
complicated so we get pushed in so many

1224
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:08,460
different directions it's easy to get

1225
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:11,760
stuck in a pattern this is how people

1226
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:15,480
get stuck into so many patterns

1227
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:17,819
okay so it's easy to get confused right

1228
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:19,500
these brain shots are designed to help

1229
00:50:17,819 --> 00:50:21,900
shift

1230
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:24,720
it's a shifter these brain shots are

1231
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:27,660
designed to help shift our Direction so

1232
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:29,760
our body can shift and heal and our

1233
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:30,839
emotional frame of mind can break a

1234
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,000
pattern

1235
00:50:30,839 --> 00:50:35,819
of confinement

1236
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,200
so here's how it works you got OCD you

1237
00:50:35,819 --> 00:50:38,880
got obsessive thoughts you have anything

1238
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:41,520
like that when you do this obsessive

1239
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:43,920
thought shifter it's breaking a pattern

1240
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:46,319
and it will reduce triggers so if you're

1241
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:49,079
somebody with OCD you'll get triggered

1242
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:50,940
less into an OCD pattern you see how it

1243
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:52,859
works you actually get triggered less

1244
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:54,960
into an OCD pattern

1245
00:50:52,859 --> 00:50:56,940
how powerful is that

1246
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:59,240
that's that's just it's mind-blowing

1247
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:59,240
really

1248
00:50:59,579 --> 00:51:03,540
so we're doing the obsessive thought

1249
00:51:01,079 --> 00:51:07,160
shifter that's where we are right now

1250
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:07,160
so let's get into it a little bit

1251
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:16,099
you guys when you think about it

1252
00:51:13,859 --> 00:51:21,119
when you think about it

1253
00:51:16,099 --> 00:51:23,339
if we have the ability if we have a

1254
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:25,260
if we have an ability

1255
00:51:23,339 --> 00:51:26,460
to break a pattern that we've been stuck

1256
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:29,160
with

1257
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:31,380
it's it's a miracle so what I call these

1258
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:33,059
brain shot therapy cleanses I call them

1259
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:34,559
Miracles I call these brain shots

1260
00:51:33,059 --> 00:51:37,980
miracles

1261
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:40,079
and that's a big part of like all of it

1262
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:42,300
when you think about it like whoa It's

1263
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:44,460
like a miracle just happened how is this

1264
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:47,940
possible it's possible because it's

1265
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:49,440
information from above now with the

1266
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:50,819
obsessive thought shifter there's a few

1267
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:53,720
words in here before we get started

1268
00:51:50,819 --> 00:51:53,720
we're about to make it

1269
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:58,859
try this shot when you're trying to

1270
00:51:56,520 --> 00:52:01,020
break repeated painful thought patterns

1271
00:51:58,859 --> 00:52:03,540
resulting from a difficult situation or

1272
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:05,339
hardship you had some type of

1273
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:06,599
Confrontation some kind of difficult

1274
00:52:05,339 --> 00:52:08,640
situation

1275
00:52:06,599 --> 00:52:10,740
something's creeping up from the past

1276
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:13,380
that's bothering you something you feel

1277
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:14,880
like you know you you're stuck with

1278
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:16,800
thinking and you're thinking about and

1279
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:18,599
thinking over and over again you can

1280
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,579
definitely use a Shot For This

1281
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:23,400
here's another one too you experience

1282
00:52:20,579 --> 00:52:25,440
chronic OCD or you're going through a

1283
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:27,240
relapse or heightening of OCD symptoms

1284
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:30,119
so if you're somebody and you're having

1285
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:32,460
a relapse or a heightened sense of OCD

1286
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:34,440
where your OCD got triggered again and

1287
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:37,200
now you're you're really struggling with

1288
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:38,400
that OCD it's time to use this brain

1289
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:41,099
shot

1290
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:44,160
this brain shot covers all forms and

1291
00:52:41,099 --> 00:52:46,200
varieties of OCD how about this one I

1292
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,700
know that this one is not a big deal and

1293
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:49,440
I get it because I was saying this the

1294
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:52,079
other day and it's not that big of a

1295
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:53,880
deal if you're stuck with a song playing

1296
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:56,700
in your head but let me tell you guys

1297
00:52:53,880 --> 00:53:00,480
something I heard a song the other day

1298
00:52:56,700 --> 00:53:03,540
that drove me bat crazy right it

1299
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:06,720
was in my head it was a song that I

1300
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:09,240
liked like 20 years ago I liked it for

1301
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:10,800
five seconds and then it got stuck in my

1302
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:12,839
head and I was trying to get work done

1303
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:15,359
Spirit of compassion was talking to me

1304
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:17,940
and I was like I had the song playing in

1305
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:19,920
my head while I was trying to work

1306
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:22,440
and I don't know about you but the song

1307
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:25,200
playing in my head thing that's I I just

1308
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:27,359
took out I took out the juicer I just

1309
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:28,740
said that's it I took out the mm 1500

1310
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:31,319
and I was just like I'm making this

1311
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:33,119
obsessive thoughts

1312
00:53:31,319 --> 00:53:36,960
so repetitive thoughts that are

1313
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:39,180
disturbing you continue to play

1314
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:41,940
repetitive thoughts that disturb you in

1315
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:43,020
any way that continue to repeat and

1316
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:45,000
replay

1317
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:47,700
or repetitive thoughts that are causing

1318
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:49,859
you to make repetitive decisions and

1319
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:51,480
actions so it's like whoa this

1320
00:53:49,859 --> 00:53:52,920
repetitive thought is making me actually

1321
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:54,540
do an action

1322
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:56,760
here's one right here you're hearing

1323
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:58,940
voices in your head or experiencing

1324
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:00,839
thoughts that are upsetting

1325
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:02,700
unproductive so you're trying to fall

1326
00:54:00,839 --> 00:54:06,119
asleep and you're just healing you're

1327
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:08,040
hearing yourself even yourself talk

1328
00:54:06,119 --> 00:54:11,220
and you just want to just go to sleep

1329
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:13,740
and you just want to not be involved

1330
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:16,440
and then there's a memory of a past

1331
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:18,000
experience keeps Rising it could be an

1332
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:20,040
experience that happened last week

1333
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,160
that's a past experience it could be an

1334
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:25,020
experience that happened a month ago

1335
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:27,720
that's a past experience it could be an

1336
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:29,760
experience that happened a year ago 20

1337
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:31,200
years ago and now it's creeping up and

1338
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:33,420
what happens is a lot of us we have

1339
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:36,660
experiences that happen in our life and

1340
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:38,579
they creep up years later and how do you

1341
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:40,260
break it now you're seeing counselors

1342
00:54:38,579 --> 00:54:42,660
and therapists

1343
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:44,160
a memory of a past experience keeps

1344
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:45,780
arising in your mind and it's not

1345
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:48,180
helpful to keep thinking about it you

1346
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:50,819
got to get the obsessive thought shifter

1347
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:53,579
out and slam them down

1348
00:54:50,819 --> 00:54:56,640
Krista says and the songs never stop

1349
00:54:53,579 --> 00:54:58,740
every word triggers a new song it's hard

1350
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:01,020
to think I'm serious that happens to me

1351
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:03,300
like I was in the car

1352
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:05,220
with a friend and they turned on the

1353
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:06,960
radio and I was like don't turn on the

1354
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:10,140
radio right now just they turned it on

1355
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:11,940
and this really dumb song came on

1356
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:13,680
and it was like that was it I was like

1357
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:15,000
thanks I really appreciate it I told my

1358
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:16,140
friend thank you very much because now

1359
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,660
I'm going to be dealing with that song

1360
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:20,460
Until I do these success thought shifter

1361
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:22,160
so here we are let's get into this a

1362
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:25,079
little bit

1363
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:27,319
you guys I'm gonna get the mm 1500 out

1364
00:55:25,079 --> 00:55:27,319
here

1365
00:55:31,319 --> 00:55:36,900
so you guys the mn1500 is on sale just

1366
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:39,480
so you know it's my favorite because

1367
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:43,079
it's 20 it's 20 off but it's my favorite

1368
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:45,359
because of what it does so it's

1369
00:55:43,079 --> 00:55:46,859
extraction method is just remarkable I

1370
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:49,619
don't think anything touches it out

1371
00:55:46,859 --> 00:55:53,400
there so it saves me money when I juice

1372
00:55:49,619 --> 00:55:56,880
so it squeezes out everything and what

1373
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:58,740
the deal is when you get it when you

1374
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:00,480
have a juicer and you can use any juicer

1375
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:02,640
for this but when you have a juicer that

1376
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:04,260
squeezes everything out

1377
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:06,240
you're getting all the phytochemical

1378
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:09,240
compounds that make the shot like that

1379
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:10,859
make it work really strong and that's

1380
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:13,559
another thing too

1381
00:56:10,859 --> 00:56:15,119
if someone's like you know well I did it

1382
00:56:13,559 --> 00:56:18,119
but I'm not really getting the best

1383
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:20,280
results did they use a blender what did

1384
00:56:18,119 --> 00:56:21,480
they do all of it and you guys know I

1385
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:24,599
work with

1386
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:26,819
Omega on the mm 1500 900 but the reason

1387
00:56:24,599 --> 00:56:29,760
why I work with them is because of what

1388
00:56:26,819 --> 00:56:33,839
it does it's got that celery end cap on

1389
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:35,880
here it's got the compression and so it

1390
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:37,980
saves me money because I'm always buying

1391
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:39,720
less produce and I'm doing these shots

1392
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:41,700
I'm buying less produce I do my celery

1393
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:44,520
juice every day I buy less celery

1394
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:46,980
because it's squeezing so much out that

1395
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:48,660
you're not throwing away that juice

1396
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:50,400
extraction you're not throwing it away

1397
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:52,380
so that's where you know why I really

1398
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,700
love it it's quiet there's like a bunch

1399
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:56,579
of reasons it doesn't have the metal

1400
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:59,099
gears rubbing all that stuff I just love

1401
00:56:56,579 --> 00:57:01,260
the machine it saves others money it

1402
00:56:59,099 --> 00:57:03,240
saves families money and all that it's

1403
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:07,020
like incredible because it does what it

1404
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:08,160
does and it's 20 off right now mm 1500

1405
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:09,540
just so you know if that's if you're

1406
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:12,300
looking for a juicer if you've got a

1407
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:13,920
juicer use a juicer you're you have

1408
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:15,540
all right I'm excited about this

1409
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:19,280
actually

1410
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:19,280
let's go one radish

1411
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:24,480
we got the radish right here

1412
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:27,240
what I'm gonna do is cut that radish in

1413
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:29,579
a couple of pieces and send it down

1414
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:31,380
you guys making it with me right now

1415
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:34,619
radish is first

1416
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:36,839
I got my radish right there

1417
00:57:34,619 --> 00:57:38,700
now if you got a small radish use a

1418
00:57:36,839 --> 00:57:41,940
small radish I think this radish was

1419
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:46,099
actually a pretty decent size

1420
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:46,099
seeing bigger radishes but

1421
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:53,180
get the radish in there the other one's

1422
00:57:49,619 --> 00:57:55,319
eighth cup Loosely packed fresh Sage

1423
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:59,700
eighth of a cup

1424
00:57:55,319 --> 00:58:02,339
of loosely packed fresh Sage

1425
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:03,720
so I'm gonna get some Sage leaves off of

1426
00:58:02,339 --> 00:58:05,520
here

1427
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:07,079
eighth of a cup

1428
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:09,599
crunching them down in my hands because

1429
00:58:07,079 --> 00:58:13,339
I got a measuring cup in my hand that's

1430
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:13,339
how I do it there we go

1431
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:19,020
all right send it down in here

1432
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:20,880
next one is a half of Apple of course

1433
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:22,740
you can do one apple it depends on the

1434
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:25,079
size of your Apple tip you got a really

1435
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:27,780
large Apple

1436
00:58:25,079 --> 00:58:29,940
do a half of Apple if you got a small

1437
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:33,559
apple that's a small one there

1438
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:33,559
you can just do a small apple

1439
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:38,180
so let's go this is a small apple right

1440
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,180
there

1441
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:43,339
so half of Apple

1442
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:48,960
you'll do one apple if you want

1443
00:58:46,859 --> 00:58:50,819
I'm gonna do like three quarters of this

1444
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:52,440
apple it's a little bigger it's not that

1445
00:58:50,819 --> 00:58:55,160
small of an apple

1446
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:55,160
there we go

1447
00:58:59,339 --> 00:59:03,319
and then one stalk of celery

1448
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:08,769
[Applause]

1449
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:15,480
try to do them in order if you can to

1450
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:17,780
the ingredient list in the book

1451
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:17,780
foreign

1452
00:59:18,059 --> 00:59:36,880
there's my shot

1453
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:36,880
[Music]

1454
00:59:39,559 --> 00:59:44,880
if you've been doing these lately you

1455
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:45,960
know the feeling you get before you do

1456
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:48,000
them right

1457
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:50,520
it's a feeling that you know something

1458
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:52,859
good is gonna happen

1459
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:54,660
because you know they work

1460
00:59:52,859 --> 00:59:57,420
and if you've tried them and you know

1461
00:59:54,660 --> 01:00:01,260
they were you can feel

1462
00:59:57,420 --> 01:00:03,119
what's in your hand the energy

1463
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:05,280
the light

1464
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:08,160
The Light Within the books The Light

1465
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:10,260
Within the ingredients The Light Within

1466
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:12,720
the shot when they're mixed is that
