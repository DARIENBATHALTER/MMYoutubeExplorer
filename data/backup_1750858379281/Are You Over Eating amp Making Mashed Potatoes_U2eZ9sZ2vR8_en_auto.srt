52
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,640
now

53
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,079
you guys i'm making a mashed potato with

54
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,000
some peas

55
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,680
and it's a simple dish you can throw

56
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,520
spices in there if you want you can do

57
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,000
that you can throw onion powder in there

58
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,600
you can throw garlic powder in there you

59
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,280
can throw a little garlic in there too

60
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,079
if you really want i'm keeping it real

61
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,000
simple

62
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,680
to show that that you know for other

63
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,360
people who are sensitive garlic or

64
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,719
sensitive with onion or something that

65
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,119
they can have it's so

66
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,640
simple how cool is that it'll be fun

67
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,520
though it really will be and it'll taste

68
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,759
good too

69
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,200
and if you really wanted to add a little

70
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,040
bit of sea salt or

71
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,879
a little bit of a high quality salt

72
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,040
because you're doing salt anyway

73
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,080
because i realize i can't get people off

74
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,640
of salt

75
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,400
if i want to get them off of salt that i

76
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,879
can't get a lot of people off of it

77
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,920
it's like salt salt salt on everything

78
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,280
salt and all the food

79
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,879
lorraine l good to see you uh glad you

80
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,440
guys are coming on really do

81
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,800
lorraine wow man you i all i know is

82
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,519
i've been reading your comments on

83
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,879
youtube

84
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,640
and my mind gets blown because

85
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,160
i think i think someone's on there i

86
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,840
think it was some dude on there and he

87
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,360
was really nice guy

88
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,360
he was a really nice guy and he was

89
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,200
talking about how

90
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,959
on youtube he was talking about how i

91
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,680
think of whatever is that

92
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,480
that medical medium information can help

93
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,040
some people

94
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,959
but not help others and you were like

95
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,400
well it depends on how you look at it

96
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,400
there's so many different options

97
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,239
there's a thousand different protocols

98
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,440
you can customize it to what's happening

99
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,760
in your life

100
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,720
and and that's the difference and the

101
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,879
difference is that

102
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,560
you can heal with the information

103
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,159
because there's so much you got the

104
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,640
spiritual information

105
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:19,120
you got the the physical causes you've

106
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:22,159
got supplements and dosages

107
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,040
and so i think people jump the gun a lot

108
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,480
and they'll say

109
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:29,599
like you know i didn't get better on mm

110
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:32,000
when when millions have around the world

111
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,280
and because they applied the tools they

112
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,599
applied them

113
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,640
so it's really a matter of like reading

114
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:40,000
the books

115
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:42,159
learning and healing

116
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,319

information in there too i think what

123

125
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,799

were stuck

127
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,959
home and they were locked in so many

128
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,959
people were locked in

129

and stuck with the plague and everything

130
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,799
and they were just eating

131
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,080

132
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,760

133
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,720

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,720
it's family maybe siblings maybe it's

190
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,639
friends

191
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,759
someone's putting pressure or you've got

192
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,199
a busy schedule like

193
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,960
how am i going to get this done how am i

194
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,560
going to get that done i'm overwhelmed i

195
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,039
got to make this phone call i got to do

196
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,400
this

197
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,240
how am i going to survive what am i

198
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,120
doing in my life and you know whatever

199
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,080
is happening

200
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,759
it's it overheats the brain boom

201
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,120
electricity is going on electricity is

202
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:29,039
going on right

203
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:31,199
and now now some other stuff happens too

204
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,880
electricity is pumping through your head

205
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,240
so what happens

206
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:38,720
and your adrenals start pumping

207
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,440
brain starts overheating adrenals start

208
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,280
cranking

209
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,800
brain starts overheating adrenals start

210
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,680
cranking that's what happens right there

211
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,560
to everybody

212
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,240
okay and then here comes the food here

213
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,319
comes the food maybe

214
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,400
maybe you're somebody avoiding the food

215
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,800
maybe you're you're doing the caffeine

216
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,319
you're

217
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,919
you're cranking the chocolate the matcha

218
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,840
tea maybe you're cranking the coffee

219
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:00,240
espressos and you're trying to

220
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,680
avoid the inevitable you're trying to

221
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,919
avoid

222
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,960
you know eating and then when you do eat

223
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,360
at the end of the day

224
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,800
it's a whole bunch of stuff and so we're

225
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,319
gonna talk about glucose mineral salts

226
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,840
how that's missing

227
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:16,479
uh how why we get so hungry in our

228
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,639
brain because that's where the hunger's

229
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,280
really really stemming from

230
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,720
it's from the brain liver too it's

231
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,319
another one i'll cover that a little bit

232
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,880
so let me just get going with the food

233
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,000
too

234
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:31,039
a little bit so good

235
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,840
good that you guys are coming on what

236
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:36,319
happens to

237
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:39,520
almost everybody is insulin resistance

238
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,319
is stopping sugar from getting to your

239
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,240
brain

240
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,000
right there so that's happening to

241
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,599
everybody really so

242
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,599
you got glucose right so

243
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,560
okay you guys got the glucose

244
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,800
so everything you eat that's a

245
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,680
carbohydrate you eat some fruit you have

246
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,319
some

247
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,240
whatever you have like potato fruit if

248
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,360
you have something else that's sweet

249
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,720
right whatever it is that glucose is how

250
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,639
your brain functions

251
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,400
right there it's that glucose glucose

252
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,479
has to get to your brain

253
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,160
it's hard to get to the brain when all

254
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,160
this fats in the way so when you're

255
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,639
eating all this fat

256
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,280
it's hard to get the glucose to your

257
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,360
brain

258
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,120
the fat stops the glucose from getting

259
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,039
to your brain

260
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,400
that's what happens you get the insulin

261
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,919
resistance

262
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:30,560
your cells want to take in that sugar

263
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,440
but the fats in the way that's how it

264
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,200
works

265
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,599
so you're gonna inevitably overeat

266
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,959
because your brain is gonna be starving

267
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,719
chris good to see you

268
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,000
yeah mangoes you know i'll do two or

269
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:44,560
three manuals in the morning

270
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,640
right heard from someone that the brain

271
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,080
needs fat not glucose it's

272
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,560
misinformation out there

273
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,720
that's a sad thing so michelle michelle

274
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,560
brown thanks for that comment

275
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,080
of course you're going to hear that but

276
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:01,200
did you know that your brain

277
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,880
check this out you guys did you know

278
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,120
jerry says i definitely used to feel

279
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,200
like that especially around my period

280
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,880
since 369 since the medical meaning

281
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,680
three six nine it

282
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,440
it disappeared completely because when

283
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,360
you're doing the 369 you were getting

284
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,680
glucose

285
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,600
and you were getting mineral salts so

286
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,279
glucose and mineral salts okay that's

287
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,040
what you guys were getting right

288
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,519
and we're doing some medical medium

289
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,800
school you guys cool with that

290
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,480
you guys cool with a little medical

291
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,240
medium school today are you guys alright

292
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,880
with that are you guys sick of school

293
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,360
what's up so that's because you're

294
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,000
getting

295
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,360
your mineral salts and your glucose and

296
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,480
that was stopping

297
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,200
the want for overeating so that really

298
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,640
helps so

299
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,839
check this out you love medical medium

300
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,279
school lissieco good to see you today

301
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,880
here's an important thing to understand

302
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,680
right we're told that the brain needs

303
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,959
fat

304
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:56,640
that's misinformation the brain needs

305
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,519
sugar in five seconds if your brain

306
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,640
doesn't get

307
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:04,160
glucose sugar in five

308
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:07,279
seconds it starts to die

309
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,640
you will die if your brain doesn't get

310
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:11,279
sugar in time

311
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,800
did you know that did you guys know that

312
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,040
very important to know okay

313
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,880
so let's cover that a little bit now why

314
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,240
is there so much misinformation out

315
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,800
there

316
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,480
it's really sad because no one knows why

317
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,120
anybody's sick so then if no one knows

318
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,720
why

319
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,240
no one's sick no one knows what causes

320
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,440
chronic illness no one knows why people

321
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,480
are suffering and struggling and you

322
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,640
learn that

323
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:35,040
when you get sick you learn that fast

324
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,760
you learn that when you don't get better

325
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,760
better

326
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,279
and you just keep on spiraling in

327
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,040
sickness and you've been to your 10th

328
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,240
functional medicine doctor and your 10th

329
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,480
specialist

330
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,279
and your 10th neurologist and you can't

331
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,200
get better

332
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:49,279
and you realize nobody knows why

333
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,600
anybody's sick and no one really they're

334
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:55,120
all just it's all guessing games okay

335
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:59,760
and what happens is if your brain

336
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:03,200
doesn't get sugar in under 10 seconds

337
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:05,600
it starts to die guess what

338
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,760
if your brain doesn't get fat within 10

339
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:12,560
seconds

340
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:15,680
it starts to heal it starts to heal

341
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,920
interesting interesting okay

342
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,440
think about how important that is if

343
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:24,480
your brain doesn't get sugar

344
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:26,800
within 10 seconds it starts to die

345
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,760
really important information really

346
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,279
really is

347
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,440
get a little seam in this pan try to

348
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:36,640
cool this pan off a little bit too

349
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:39,040
have that baby pump in okay

350
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,279
your brain is made out of hardened

351
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,720
glycogen you guys

352
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,560
your brain is made out of hardened

353
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,880
glycogen you know what that is

354
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:50,800
sugar your brain is made out of sugar

355
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:53,360
it's only got traces of fat in the brain

356
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,320
did you know if you eat a brain it's

357
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,680
sweet

358
00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:01,040
did you know it's sweet

359
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:04,639
it's actually sweet it's glycogen

360
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:07,680
that's been concentrated and hardened

361
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,639
glucose running through the brain is the

362
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,440
only way

363
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,000
to truly keep the brain alive you remove

364
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,839
it

365
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,800
you die that's it interesting

366
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,240
isn't that incredible right so where did

367
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,760
the theories come from about your brain

368
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,040
needs fat

369
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:29,519
it was a theory to sell

370
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:31,680
products fat-based it was a trend

371
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,120
a trend so it's like well your brain

372
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,800
needs fat because there's fat in your

373
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,600
brain there's a little bit of fat in

374
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,360
your brain

375
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,959
a little bit other than that brain

376
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,959
tissue is made out of glycogen

377
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,040
you know it's disappointing really when

378
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,240
i think about it

379
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:51,360
like how come people can't get it right

380
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,200
out there what's going on out there

381
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,279
and back to the same thing nobody knows

382
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,560
why you got hashimoto's thyroiditis

383
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,560
nobody knows why you got eczema

384
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,639
psoriasis did you know i saw somebody

385
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,560
i saw somebody that someone showed me

386
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:05,279
something right

387
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,399
that someone took medical medium

388
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,040
information

389
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,399
which is that psoriasis is caused by

390
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,880
toxic heavy metals

391
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,160
copper specifically right and they took

392
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,920
that and they get incited back to

393
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,760
medical medium there's no study

394
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,959
there's no science behind it and a

395
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,240
doctor

396
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:24,399
put it on his thing that psoriasis toxic

397
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,000
heavy metals right

398
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,600
well the only reason why the doctor knew

399
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,880
that was because of medical media books

400
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:33,040
and information

401
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:36,000
okay it's almost like so you don't have

402
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,440
anything on chronic illness unless you

403
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,680
take it for a medical medium

404
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,279
fact that's what i'm seeing out there

405
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,560
it's really sad or they'll just say it's

406
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,760
all in your gut and in the end you'll

407
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,000
just stay sick

408
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,120
libya says he supports people who eat

409
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,440

411
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,199

412
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,000
this isn't vegan propaganda anti-animal

413
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:57,360

darlene says oh my god i'm eating a

lemon balm love hey

429
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,519
another voice of reason podcast doctors

430
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,560
always steal

431
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:30,399
mm info fact

432
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,000
podcast doctor so we steal medical

433
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,839
medium information i'm going to take the

434
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,480
skin off the potato first of all

435
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,240
i always eat the skin on potatoes so

436
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,959
it's an incredible nutritious part of

437
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,279
the potato

438
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,800
absolutely but i'm making a fun mashed

439
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,959
potato dish

440
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:48,160
right so i'm kind of removing some of

441
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:51,600
the skin on here

442
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:54,399
podcast doctors steal

443
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,160
medical medium information it's not

444
00:14:54,399 --> 00:15:00,720
published anywhere else

445
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:02,480
the medical medium books right and

446
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,320
they take it so now all of a sudden

447
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,000
psoriasis is caused by toxic heavy metal

448
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,120
there's no study

449
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,079
they haven't discovered in science

450
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,320
it came from spirit of compassion that

451
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:17,279
the cause of psoriasis

452
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,360
is copper a toxic heavy metal it's cause

453
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:24,320
of partly cause of

454
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:26,320
eczema two right so

455
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,160
when it comes down to everything like

456
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,399
information about the brain if you want

457
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,240
to know more about the brain

458
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,680
you're not going to hear reason out

459
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,399
there because when they say your brain

460
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,320
needs fat

461
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,680
and your brain is made out of fat two

462
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,360
strikes against

463
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,759
the industry right there they alter the

464
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,880
fraud industry the fraud alternative

465
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,120
industry

466
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,839
problem is with the alternative industry

467
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:51,279
basically most of it's all fraud

468
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,880
and you know all my friends are

469
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,720
alternative doctors

470
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,040
incredible ones though at least they

471
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,040
they they know the difference right

472
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,440
but and then there's the conventional

473
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,440
system too is is fraudulent

474
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,279
it's completely fraudulent especially in

475
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:09,040
the virus world

476
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:10,959
really fraudulent and with virus

477
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,399
all it's always the wrong information

478
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:14,560
about viruses

479
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,759
the wrong information about all of it

480
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:19,759
i'm taking the skin

481
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:21,360

talking about overeating we're talking

499
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:59,440
about

500
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:02,399
uh emotional eating too right

501
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:05,039
and how stress plays a role the brain

502
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:08,480

so you guys check out medical mean

504
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,959
podcast at apple podcast

00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:15,360
you know if you can catch up on some of

506
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,120
the episodes the blood draw episode is

507
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,439
really critical to know

508
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,520
because you're just going to get caught

509
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,959
getting too much blood taken from you

510
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,400
you're going to lose your immune system

511
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,559
part of your immune system it's going to

512
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,360
make you susceptible to other problems i

513
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,039
think

514
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,840
i have to bring up the blood draw

515
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,480
problem once in a while because if i

516
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,919
don't

517
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,360
if i don't people are just going to

518
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,400
forget they're going to get their blood

519
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,080
tests

520
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,440
the doctor's going to take too much

521
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,120
blood

522
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,600
and you're going to get you know five

523
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,039
vials five full vials seven full vials

524
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,799
eight full vials of blood and

525
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,080
want to remind everybody if you guys can

526
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,760
tell everybody about the blood draw

527
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,360
podcast episode

528
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:55,280
maybe share the link or let people know

529
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:56,640
it's medically podcasted apple podcast

530
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,240
because what happens is there's a whole

531
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,960
bunch of people i hear every day i just

532
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:03,200
had 27 vials taken and just had 15 vials

533
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,039
taken i just had 12 vials taken

534
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,880
and it's like okay great a big part of

535
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,320
your immune system was removed

536
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,160
now you're more susceptible to the

537
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,200
plague that's happening out there

538
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,960
one of the reasons why the plague got so

539
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,720
annoying was because of

540
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:20,000
all the blood draws prior that was a big

541
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,600
reason right there

542
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,559
all the blood draws prior right

543
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,120
and people just they were going into the

544
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,200
plague

545
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,039
with a weakened immune system just from

546
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,640
blood testing alone

547
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,799
just from blood testing alone so i

548
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,640
peeled some potatoes here took the

549
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,720
skin off these are steamed by the way

550
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:42,640
these are steamed potatoes

551
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:44,400
they're not raw steamed potatoes it's

552
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,080
the only way to cook a potato really

553
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,760
that's the best way to do it it's having

554
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,520
a steamed potato so i'm giving you kind

555
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,520
of the rundown on that right there

556
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,760
let me mash these up if you guys got a

557
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,240
second thank you for coming on here lots

558
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,559
to talk about

559
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,760
susan gabriel said i recently told a

560
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:02,799
technician

561
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,120
only two have files she said it wouldn't

562
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:06,640
be

563
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:09,679
enough i said it's plenty she said okay

564
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:13,679
you fought for it you fought for it

565
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:16,160
you you fought for it you took control

566
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,520
over your health and you fought for it

567
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,559
and you won

568
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,799
you won and it matters it

569
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,760
matters austin good to see you it

570
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:27,520
matters

571
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:30,640
it really really does because

572
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:33,360
when you get that blood taken

573
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,880
you lose your immune system you do guess

574
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,440
where the immune system is

575
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,080
it's in your bloodstream i love when you

576
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,000
hear

577
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,280
the whole thing of the theory of your

578
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,840
immune system's all in your gut

579
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,360
it's not all in your gut it's not your

580
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:48,320
immune system isn't

581
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,880
micro biome that's not your immune

582
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,640
system

583
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,480
i bet you i'm pissing off somebody right

584
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,880
now i'm sure because there's so much

585
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,160
brainwashing and the colts out there

586
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,840
about you know your immune system being

587
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,200
all in your gut all in your gut

588
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,679
everything's in your gut

589
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,799
all the zelda all the gut products and

590
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:06,880
the gut potions

591
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:08,480
and the gut powders and the gut tests

592
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,919
where you do the stool samples and

593
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,679
you're looking for all the gut

594
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,679
microbiome issues and everything else

595
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,960
meanwhile people just don't get better

596
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,400
they don't get does that fix your

597
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,159
hashimoto's thyroiditis because i'm

598
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,720
scratching my head over here

599
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:22,000
does that fix a four-year-old's eczema

600
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,440
that's raging

601
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,120
and the four-year-old can't even the

602
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,880
skin's cracking off the four-year-old

603
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:30,000
the mom and dad are in

604
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,720
perils does that fix that i'm just

605
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,240
curious

606
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:36,559
um you know the gut gut health is isn't

607
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,720
isn't everything for immune system the

608
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,559
immune system is in your bloodstream and

609
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,840
i've i've talked to doctors recently

610
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,960
about this and they said well tell me

611
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,600
more about this because

612
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,039
because the the trend is your immune

613
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,960
system is all in your gut

614
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:52,240
yeah there's a lot of immune system

615
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,240
around the gut for sure but the majority

616
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,679
is everywhere else in the body it's

617
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,559
protecting your brain it's in your

618
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,840
bloodstream

619
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:00,400
so your immune system is in your

620
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,080
bloodstream that's the whole point

621
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,760
your blood circulating every single

622
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,280
vessel every single organ in your body

623
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,120
and it has to have white cells and white

624
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,640
blood cells in it it has to

625
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,000
that's how you stop a pathogen from

626
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,760
going to the brain that's how you stop

627
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,960
infections that's how you stop sepsis

628
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,840
that's how you stop

629
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,200
blood uh poisoning and then you've got

630
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,640
bacterial infections in the blood and

631
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,240
then you just die of sepsis in the

632
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,320
hospital it's because your immune system

633
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,400
is all in your blood that's the majority

634
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,480
of it there's a large amount in the gut

635
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,320
not in the intestinal lining and that's

636
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,200
the big issue right there so if you want

637
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,720
details because details matter it's not

638
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,880
your microorganisms

639
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,640
that are inside your gut creating your

640
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,120
immune system it's not good bacteria

641
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,360
that are

642
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,039
inside your intestinal inside your

643
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,000
intestinal tract that doesn't create an

644
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,240
immune system

645
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,320
i'm just letting you know good bacteria

646
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,440
has nothing nothing to do with creating

647
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,559
immune cells so it's important right to

648
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,280
know that

649
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,080
so yes you have you have white blood

650
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,000
cells

651
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,240
your immune system is circulating

652
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,799
throughout every blood vessel around

653
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,400
your gut

654
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:02,159
every blood vessel around every organ

655
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,840
but it's not inside your intestinal

656
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,280
tract you guys got to get that part

657
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,679
straight anyway

658
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:09,280
okay you got your you got your lymphatic

659
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,919
system right your lymphocytes

660
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:13,520
so that's another place that that's

661
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:15,280
another place right there your lymphatic

662
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,000
system and it circulates around your

663
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,840
torso

664
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,120
most of your lymphatic system is around

665
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,159
your torso right so you got your

666
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,159
lymphocytes

667
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,520
but that's not the lining inside your

668
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,200
gut

669
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,120
that's not your good bacteria

670
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,200
microorganisms inside you god this is so

671
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,480
important to know details matter

672
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,320
because here's what's going to happen

673
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,760
you go to your gut health doctor he's

674
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,080
going to take 20 vials of blood and

675
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,360
destroy your immune system

676
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,120
while he's telling you how your immune

677
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,480
system is all in your gut

678
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,840
you don't see the irony that because i'm

679
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,559
kind of like scratching my head on that

680
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:47,840
one i'm like okay um

681
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:48,720
okay you went to the you went to the

682
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,280
doctor

683
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,520
all right he took 20 vials of blood

684
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,679
specialists he's a gut health guy too

685
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,600
functional doctor whoever it is and he

686
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,360
took you know 18 miles of blood

687
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,679
he just annihilated your immune system

688
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,960
for the next three to six months

689
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,400
killed your red blood cells for the next

690
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,840
three to six months it takes a long time

691
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,200
to get these blood cells back it doesn't

692
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,280
take three days

693
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,559
and but yet he's telling you

694
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,240
everything's in your gut so here's some

695
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,360

and meanwhile just wiped out your immune

700
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,039

00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,600

plantar fasciitis digititis you got all

724
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,880

and what happens is right you get all

728
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,960
that

729
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,000
okay we're already compromised so we go

730
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,840
to the doctor

731
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,440
and then we get eight vials drawn seven

732
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,279
vowels drawn ten vowels drawn

733
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,720
and they're removing our immune system

734
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,000
but see no one knows what's wrong with

735
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,760
you so you go to your good health doctor

736
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,200
he doesn't know why you're sick

737
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,520
he doesn't know you got epstein-barr

738
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,799
shingle sedimentary virus streptococcus

739
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,159
you got toxic heavy metals he doesn't

740
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,080
know that

741
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,360
so you go there he doesn't know what

742
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,799
causes your hashimoto's

743
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,240
but then they remove a whole bunch of

744
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:33,600
your immune system and then start saying

745
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,799
oh you got to get your gut it's all your

746
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,760

00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,440
doctor for a little while

790
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,200

of their immune system squeezed out of

795
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,320
them and then told their immune system

draw thing because here's what happens a

821
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,600
little time goes by people forget about

822
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,960
it or they didn't learn about it and

823
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,520
they're getting life sucked out of them

824
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,880
and then they're

825
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,520
they're going backwards and they're like

826
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,360

been doing

856
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:12,240

857
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:16,480

blow the roof off this house off the

860
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:25,039
ceiling or whatever

861
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,039
blow the roof off the universe

862
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,840
a book that's gonna blow the roof off

863
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:32,320
the universe

864
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:36,240
okay i mean seriously it's it's

865
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:39,760
it's the book's gonna be

866
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:41,039
insane uh and i'm only saying that the

867
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,480
spirit of compassion is giving me the

868
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,039
information in my mind is being blown

869
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,000
every second

870
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:47,679
when my mind's being blown i'm like whoa

871
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,039
so what happens is we get addicted to

872
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,320
adrenaline that's something

873
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:51,919
well first of all let me just go into

874
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,240
the brain a little bit more just a

875
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:57,279
little touch more about the brain

876
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,640
let me cover that a little bit more

877
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,000
i'm just making sure these are mashed

878
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,440
and they look really nice i'm mashing

879
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,960
some potatoes right here it's a comfort

880
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:07,039
food right here for people

881
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:09,840
it's great i make it for family

882
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,840
too sometimes

883
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:17,600
so we're told that the brain

884
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:21,840
needs fat and it's made out of fat wrong

885
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:24,240
right there i'm sorry but it's wrong

886
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,600
science battles itself constantly by the

887
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,120
way okay

888
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,720
you know what science said about

889
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:32,080
caffeine

890
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:34,080
back in the 80s top science science that

891
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:36,080
could never be disputed

892
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,200
conventional science it could never be

893
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,200
disputed you know what

894
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,399
conventional science said in 1980s

895
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,760
caffeine will cause heart disease

896
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:46,720
caffeine will worsen all your

897
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:48,880
neurological diseases

898
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,480
caffeine will cause diabetes make it

899
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,760
worse and worse

900
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:55,520
right so that was the studies that came

901
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,120
out in the 1980s did you know that

902
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,880
so the studies that came out in the

903
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:02,480
1980s

904
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:04,320
were were straight up about caffeine

905
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:07,360
causing all this damage right

906
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:09,520
but then the caffeine industry said

907
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,279
we're gonna do our own studies

908
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,799
so as the years go by it's like caffeine

909
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:15,440
is good for you

910
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:16,559
cacao is good for you coffee is good for

911
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,159
you

912
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,679
right and so they went against

913
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,279
conventional science whose science is

914
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:23,360
right

915
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:24,480
science battles science all the time i'm

916
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,520
actually going to talk about it on

917
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,679

i think we're going to really kind of

921
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:36,640

00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,360
some of you guys are eating chicken it's

936
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:08,720
not the healthiest fat we know that

937
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:11,200
right chicken fat clog up the heart

938
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,480
kill you down the road right i'm not

939
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,240
saying you can't eat chicken

940
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,399
the reason why medical medium

941
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,679
information is pro people who eat animal

942
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:20,559
proteins too

943
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:22,399
is because chicken isn't going to feed

944
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:24,159
all the viruses

945
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:25,760
that keep everybody sick so if you're

946
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,960
somebody that's into chicken yeah you

947
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,120
can have a little bit but you eat too

948
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,279
much chicken you can kill yourself

949
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:33,039
but i've also seen plant-based people

950
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:33,600
kill themselves by eating too many nut

951
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:35,279
butters

952
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,720
and too much fats and too much oils

953
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:38,080
they'll kill themselves too

954
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,120
but get themselves sick down the road

955
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,399
have a heart attack you don't think

956
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,279
plant-based people don't have heart

957
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:43,279
attacks

958
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:45,039
yeah they have heart attacks they eat

959
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:46,640
too much fat everybody's eating too much

960
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:48,240
fat and then we fat ourselves to death

961
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,880
and now we're told oh god have fat

962
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,360
healthy

963
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:53,200
much fat as you can your brain needs it

964
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,080
did you know fat stops glucose from

965
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,679
getting to your brain

966
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,000
and your brain dies within 10 seconds of

967
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:00,080
not

968
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,120
getting that glucose i told you guys

969
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,120
that a couple minutes ago

970
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,600
so

971
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:12,240
i want to finish this a little bit okay

972
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:14,399
so when you're doing all the avocado

973
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,000
nuts and seeds nut butters oils

974
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:18,240
right when you're doing all that

975
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,559
avocados nut butters

976
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,799
oils right when you're doing all that

977
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:25,120
okay

978
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:26,880
you're stopping glucose from getting to

979
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:29,600
the brain at its maximum

980
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,200
so it's always like a like a lesser

981
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:34,640
amount getting to the brain

982
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,559
and you get hungry fat makes you want to

983
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,080
eat more and more fat people say sugar

984
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:40,399
makes me want to eat more and more sugar

985
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,919
oh no that's sugar with fat

986
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:43,679
that makes you want to eat more and more

987
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:45,279
sugar that's sugar with

988
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:49,200
fat that makes you want to eat more and

989
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:49,200
more sugar that's what that is okay

990
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:54,960
that's important to know got some mashed

991
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,840
potatoes here i'm going to put some lime

992
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,840
in here

993
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:04,240
mashed potatoes in the pan right

994
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,760
see if we could squeeze this slime i'm

995
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,120
having a problem here with this one this

996
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,039
one's slippery

997
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:11,200
potato can be a little slippery when

998
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:14,640
it's on your hands

999
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:18,000
tik tok the handle not the app

1000
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:20,960
tick tock the handle says

1001
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,080
seeds so that you're talking about flax

1002
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,840
seeds

1003
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:26,320
look you can they're healthy they're

1004
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:27,519
healthy fats flax seeds and avocado if

1005
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,039
you guys are gonna eat fats that's the

1006
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:31,519
ones to do sesame seeds

1007
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:33,360
hemp seeds pumpkin seeds those are the

1008
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:34,399
best ones sunflower seeds are good too

1009
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,600
right

1010
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:40,240
you can do that but keep in mind if

1011
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,240
you're sick

1012
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:45,039
too much fat is not going to let you

1013
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:48,240
heal all the way

1014
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:48,640
animal protein or plant-based keep that

1015
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,360
in mind

1016
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:53,279
animal protein or plant-based animal

1017
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,480
protein people are now eating avocados

1018
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:54,799
and nuts and seeds they didn't used to

1019
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,399
eat

1020
00:33:54,799 --> 00:34:00,960
eat all that but now they do

1021
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:03,440
and but keep in mind about this this is

1022
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,440
important

1023
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:09,280
that

1024
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:10,560
got some mashed potatoes in here a

1025
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,919
little bit i'm gonna put some peas in

1026
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,760
here too

1027
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:15,040
keep in mind that the more fat you dump

1028
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,119
in your system

1029
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:19,119
the less glucose gets to the brain so

1030
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:21,839
you're gonna have eating

1031
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:23,119
like eating issues you're gonna be like

1032
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:25,679
i'm hungry

1033
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:27,679
all the time that's your brain saying

1034
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:29,359
i'm hungry because you're not letting me

1035
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:31,280
get enough glucose

1036
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:32,639
you're not giving me three mangoes when

1037
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,320
i need in the morning you're not giving

1038
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:36,320
me the heavy metal detox smoothie with

1039
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,919
the glucose with the bananas

1040
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,079
you're you know in the industry wants

1041
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:41,599
you afraid of bananas be open-hearted

1042
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:44,240
good to see you

1043
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:44,639
the industry wants you afraid of bananas

1044
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,320
right

1045
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:48,079
the industry wants you afraid of that

1046
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,639
they want you they don't want you eating

1047
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,639
bananas

1048
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:55,839
they don't watch eating bananas no way

1049
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:58,240
can add a little bit more water to this

1050
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:59,599
that's what i'm gonna do the industry

1051
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,040
doesn't want you having bananas they

1052
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,320
think it's too much sugar

1053
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,400
so what's going to happen is you're

1054
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,720
going to be on fat fat fat

1055
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,720
and then you're eventually going to eat

1056
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:10,000
the bad sugar is what you're going to do

1057
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:14,480
you're going to have the bad

1058
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,480
sugars what's going to happen so

1059
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,240
adding a little touch of water to the

1060
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,800
mashed potatoes which will eventually

1061
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,720
dry up

1062
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,839
but you need it when you're putting in

1063
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,400
some peas

1064
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:26,320
and that's a thing there too so i'm

1065
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:29,200
going to pop in some peas into this

1066
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:31,839
pan's going to get nice and hot there we

1067
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,839
go

1068
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,839
you have to add a little bit of moisture

1069
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,079
into the pan or you get a hash brown

1070
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:39,440
a hash brown pancake so that's what

1071
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:42,000
you'll get

1072
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,839
ashley kevin good to see you i said no

1073
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,720
no it's so nice to see you too as well

1074
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:47,520
okay

1075
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,320
so we're gonna make some mashed potatoes

1076
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,400
like we're doing

1077
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,000
i have some lettuce here too i just put

1078
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,760
some lime in there i'm gonna pop some

1079
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,320
lemon in a little bit as well

1080
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:58,160
it's a basic dish so what happens is if

1081
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,000
you're not getting critical critical

1082
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,839
needed nutrients to the brain

1083
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,200
on a regular basis the brain will go

1084
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:04,640
deficient and if your brain goes

1085
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,760
deficient of glucose if it goes

1086
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:09,119
deficient because

1087
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:13,440
we're eating too much fat fat

1088
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:16,880
blocks sugar from entering brain cells

1089
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,440
but the survival of life allows some to

1090
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,200
enter

1091
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,599
some to enter but we go into a

1092
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:24,800
deficiency

1093
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:26,400
is what we do that deficiency makes us

1094
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:30,000
now hungry and then

1095
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:31,760
we're doing more fat or bad sugar with

1096
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,599
fat because their body's like why am i

1097
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,359
sugar craving but yet you're eating fat

1098
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:36,560
with sugar why am i sugar craving but

1099
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,240
you're eating fat with sugar

1100
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,000
you're still blocking the glucose from

1101
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,480
getting to the brain

1102
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,320
is what you're doing see how it works

1103
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,560
that's how it works

1104
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,520
tom posky says do carnival peep

1105
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:50,160
carnivore

1106
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,720
people survive because of sugar in the

1107
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,200
meat

1108
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,480
it's how they survive sugar in the meat

1109
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:58,000
it's not enough

1110
00:36:54,480 --> 00:37:00,640
it's not enough it's not enough because

1111
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,880
because you got fat in the meat too but

1112
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:05,440
you survive on carnivore

1113
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,320
you can you can survive on carnivore

1114
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,440
because

1115
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:11,040
the the sugar meats meats meat has sugar

1116
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,800
in it i love when people say well i'm on

1117
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,800
a sugar-free diet i'm eating just meat

1118
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:17,280
i'm like that's funny

1119
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,800
because the cow had a lot of sugar in

1120
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,839
its blood

1121
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:24,720
and that red meat is all sugar and

1122
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:24,720
that's what that is

1123
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,320
sugar and eggs or sugar you know why

1124
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,240
there's a lot of sugar in eggs

1125
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,599
you guys know that eggs are sweet when

1126
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,200
you have an egg they're sweet did you

1127
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:34,800
know cheese is sweet too

1128
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,680
let's cover the egg the egg's an

1129
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:41,440
important one as far as like sweetness

1130
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:45,520
okay when you have

1131
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:48,560
an egg you'll notice it's kind of sweet

1132
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:49,520
right it is there's a reason why it's

1133
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,400
sweet

1134
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,960
it's sweet because glucose is how the

1135
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:57,119
chicken

1136
00:37:52,960 --> 00:38:00,240
the chick can actually start to become

1137
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:02,839
a chicken like grow develop

1138
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:04,000
glucose is critical you don't have

1139
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:06,800

protein

1150
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:26,040
this is an anti-animal protein uh talk

1151
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,440
we're doing right now this is an

1152
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:30,640
anti-plant-based

1153
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:32,480
vegetarian vegan talk it's not it at all

1154
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,079
you can fat yourself to death as a vegan

1155
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,440
and a plant-based person

1156
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:37,040
you can still get a heart attack down

1157
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,839
the road you can still stay sick and not

1158
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,760

00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:57,040
this vicious cycle and they're just in

1167
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:59,040
this vicious cycle vicious cycle they

i'm just giving you guys a 4-1-1 that's

1193
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,839
the goal right there

1194
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,920
the more stress you're under the more

1195
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:54,640
glucose you need not the more fat you

1196
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,400
need

1197
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:58,400
the more stress you're under the more

1198
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:01,280
sugar you need for your brain

1199
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,839
but we end up craving pizza so we crave

1200
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,640
the bad

1201
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:05,920
sugar we end up creating ice cream so we

1202
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:09,440
crave the bad sugar

1203
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:12,480
we end up craving uh spaghetti

1204
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:14,400
because because we we you know but

1205
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,040
there's fat on everything with this

1206
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,760
sugar

1207
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:19,200
your pizza is fat and sugar so the sugar

1208
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,480
never gets to the brain

1209
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,720
mashed potatoes are coming out really

1210
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,720
nice right now

1211
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,960
so the sugar the glucose never gets to

1212
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,359
your brain because you're doing too much

1213
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,200
fat

1214
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:30,720
but we end up craving the pizza again

1215
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,079
and then again and again and we eat

1216
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,680
ourselves sick and then we crave it

1217
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:36,880
again and we eat ourselves sick

1218
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:38,240

1219
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,240
nachos

1220
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:41,839
because we're craving all that cheese

1221
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,680

1222
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:45,280

your corn shell

1228
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:56,560
taco shell

1229
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,800

cali smith i'd love to hear some tips

1283
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:50,160
on how to get yourself to eat more of

1284
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:53,520
the healing foods

1285
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:53,520
when you don't enjoy them

1286
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:59,359
you got to bring in the fruit because

1287
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:00,480
fruit is satisfying in many ways because

1288
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:02,560
it's so sweet

1289
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,160
it's actually not really that sweet when

1290
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:06,240
you think about it a banana doesn't have

1291
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,920
that much sugar in it but it's but still

1292
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,839
it's sweet

1293
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:12,960
sweetness counts when it comes down to

1294
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:15,680

you can really make this taste so good

1332
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,480
taste buds change over time when you

1333
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,359
incorporate pieces in we need some

1334
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,960
willpower too

1335
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:32,960
takes a little time to get the willpower

1336
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:36,240
going where

1337
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:38,240
taste buds change they develop

1338
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:40,240

need i say more

1345
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:58,400
but we're taught we're taught to keep

1346
00:44:55,359 --> 00:45:00,880
our addictions around did you know that

1347
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:02,880
we're taught that if you want to lose

1348
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,960
weight you better just stop eating

1349
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,960
and you better get on caffeine and then

1350
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,160
now you're on caffeine all day long and

1351
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,760
you stopped eating and now you're eating

1352
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:11,760
your one meal a day at the end of the

1353
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:13,520
day that ain't gonna last long

1354
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:15,599
you'll burn those adrenals out they'll

1355
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:17,359
come crashing down down the road

1356
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:18,960
all kinds of problems will happen you'll

1357
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:20,160
age fast because you're running on

1358
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,760
caffeine all the time

1359
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:24,640
your adrenals will they will not forgive

1360
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:27,839
you

1361
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:29,760
when you caffeine them to crazy land

1362
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:31,599
when you caffeine your adrenals to crazy

1363
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,400
land when you caffeine the heck out of

1364
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:35,520
them

1365
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:37,119
over the years then when you do eat

1366
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:40,560
you're dumping in all that fat whether

1367
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:40,560
it's plant-based or animal-based

1368
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,200
you know spirit of compassion is the

1369
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:52,000
voice of reason not me

1370
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:52,000
i'm just i'm just delivering the message

1371
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:58,960
adrenals are working hard anyway you're

1372
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:02,160
up against a little bit of stress

1373
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:04,079
you had a breakup maybe you're falling

1374
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:06,720
out with a friendship

1375
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:07,280
maybe a business partner maybe a family

1376
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:10,319
member

1377
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:11,760
maybe a sibling some stress there our

1378
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:14,400
adrenals are already

1379
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:16,160
under stress were you driving on the

1380
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,680
road and had a little accident boom your

1381
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,720
adrenals are running for a day and a

1382
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:21,119
night

1383
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,720
we already have adrenals pumping all the

1384
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:24,240
time we already get little bits of fight

1385
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,760
or flight all the time they're working

1386
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:27,359
overtime so all of a sudden let's just

1387
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:29,520
dump a whole bunch of caffeine in there

1388
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:31,359
and just blow them the out

1389
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:34,720
just blow those adrenals out just

1390
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:36,240
annihilate them let's just do that

1391
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:38,720
now make sure let's just do a lot of

1392
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:41,040
high fat too and soak up that adrenaline

1393
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:43,599
and then get it you know addicted with

1394
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:45,280
adrenaline get dictated with the fat

1395
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:46,640
let's make sure we do lots of chocolate

1396
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,480
too

1397
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,760
let's go into our happy place and tank a

1398
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:52,079
bunch of chocolate

1399
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,760
i get it i get it life is hard but we

1400
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:54,640
have to do some things to take care of

1401
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,440
ourselves too

1402
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:59,440
we got to do some celery juice dr fon

1403
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:02,720
might as well face it we're addicted

1404
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:05,760
i get it so you dump

1405
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:07,920
all the fat in your adrenals are pumping

1406
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:10,720
to thin it out to try to save your life

1407
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:12,079
every day your heart is trying to pump

1408
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,359
your blood and it's really

1409
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:15,040
thick and it's trying to pump it pump

1410
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:15,920
and pump and pump it but there's so much

1411
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:18,560
fat in the blood

1412
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:19,119
that's hard to pump it and then adrenal

1413
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,800
drainage

1414
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:22,240
adrenals have to release more adrenaline

1415
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,040
to thin out that blood and thin out that

1416
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:26,160
blood

1417
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:27,599
and then all to try to get glucose to

1418
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:29,280
your brain

1419
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:31,200
always try to get some glucose here

1420
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,559
because guess what in five

1421
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:38,559
seconds if the brain doesn't have

1422
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:42,000
glucose it starts its journey of death

1423
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:43,440
in 10 seconds it can die 10 seconds

1424
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,240
without glucose your brain can start

1425
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:46,160
dying

1426
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:48,960
tissue when your brain starts dying

1427
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:53,839
without glucose 10 seconds

1428
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:53,839
10 seconds

1429
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:04,960
yep yep

1430
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:07,599
less than that 10 seconds is just

1431
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:09,119
starts with that lesson so we're taught

1432
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:10,400
to be high chasers are you guys high

1433
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:13,599
chasers

1434
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:15,440
right i got some peas in here they're

1435
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:17,119
they're i put frozen peas in here such a

1436
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:18,240
simple dish frozen peas come on we're

1437
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:21,440
getting frozen peas

1438
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:22,559
alex lange aw sometimes i feel better

1439
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:25,280
when i eat fat

1440
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:26,960
like avocados or seeds sometimes i feel

1441
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:30,480
worse

1442
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:34,160
alex good to see you honored you're here

1443
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:37,359
what happens is when we eat fat

1444
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:38,559
we get the adrenaline surge we get the

1445
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:40,480
adrenaline surge

1446
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:41,839
because the adrenaline has to thin out

1447
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,880
thin out the fat it has to thin the

1448
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:45,040
viscosity to level us

1449
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:46,800
break it down the consistency has to

1450
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:50,559
break that fat consistency down

1451
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,559
that's what happens um

1452
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,319
you know basically

1453
00:48:54,720 --> 00:49:02,559
so you need gasoline

1454
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:03,839
to break down that butter

1455
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:05,760
i'm not telling you eat gasoline that's

1456
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:08,720
not at all what i'm saying is your

1457
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:11,760
adrenaline acts like gasoline

1458
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:12,720
to break up that butter you drop down

1459
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,160
some bread and butter

1460
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,680
you eat a stick of butter you have

1461
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,000
butter in a dish you got butter in your

1462
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,280
pan

1463
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,200
you got i don't care how wholesome the

1464
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:20,160
butter is i don't care i don't care if

1465
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:23,200
you went out there

1466
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:25,520
and milked the cow and churns your own

1467
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,520
butter

1468
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:31,040
it's still going to be filling up your

1469
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:31,440
bloodstream so that your adrenals have

1470
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,839
to

1471
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:35,839
thin it out it has to thin it out

1472
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:36,880
because when you have too much fat in

1473
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:38,559
your bloodstream

1474
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,160
too much fat in your bloodstream you

1475
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:41,200
can't get all the glucose you need to

1476
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:46,000
the brain so you go

1477
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:50,240
you go you go 50 glucose to the brain

1478
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,240
now you're 30 glucose to the brain

1479
00:49:52,559 --> 00:50:00,640
now you're less

1480
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:03,280
i get it again medical medium the

1481

medical medium channels

1482
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:07,359

1505
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,720
like the people at the top giving you

1506
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:48,400
all that information that's wrong

1507
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:50,240
people die of strokes and heart attacks

1508
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:52,160
all the time at all ages whether a

1509
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:54,000
plant-based vegan vegetarian alike

00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:56,960
pescetarian i don't know come up with

1511
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,839
something else right animal protein keto

1512
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:00,480
carnivore

1513
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:02,400
carnivore i i i worry about carnivore

1514
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:05,119
the carnivore diet for people

1515
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:07,200
i worry about people with it because

1516
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:09,680
carnivore diets the atkins diet and it

1517
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:13,119
and it really killed a lot of people

1518
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:13,119
um that's what i was told

1519
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:21,119
you know the it's just i was told that

1520
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,319
by a lot of doctors this is looking good

1521
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:25,520
here

1522
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:26,720
over the years that they saw a decline

1523
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:28,319
in their patients with done

1524
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:30,000
unlike the atkins diet i was told that

1525
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:32,960
all the time so this is done i'm going

1526
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,960
to put this in a bowl

1527
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:39,280
the carnivore diet's the same thing it's

1528
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:40,720
just a remake of it

1529
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:43,599
you know reason why people feel a little

1530
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:46,319
bit better they feel a little bit better

1531
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:47,839
um this is a real comfort for sure but

1532
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:48,960
here's the thing the butter's not in

1533
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:51,680
here

1534
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:52,880
okay the butter's not in here now if

1535
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:54,240
you're gonna be someone and you're gonna

1536
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,440
eat that anyway and i'm not gonna be

1537
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:57,359
able to stop you from eating it every

1538
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,720
day three times a day right i'm like i'm

1539
00:51:57,359 --> 00:52:00,079
just telling you maybe bring it down

1540
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:02,319
right i'm not trying to say i'm just

1541
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:04,160
trying to punish you guys

1542
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:06,079
be the food police or something that's

1543
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:07,520

1544
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:08,800
and you've got symptoms you've got aches

1545
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:10,319
and pains you've got chronic fatigue

1546
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,720
your brain fog is off the chart you've

1547
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:12,480

1548
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:14,319
anxiety crippling anxiety you've got

1549
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,040
depression you've got depersonalization

1550
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:18,160
you've got

1551
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:19,280
whatever whatever is going on lower the

1552
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,800
fats

1553
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,920
yeah you need other tools too you need

1554
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,280
your cellar juice you need your heavy

1555
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,800
metal detox smoothies

1556
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:26,880
you need your supplement protocols you

1557
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:28,480
need to know how to take the b12 like

1558
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:30,160
people are afraid to take b12 because

1559
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,520
like well my b12 registered pretty good

1560
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,960
on my blood test well

1561
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:34,720
i talk to doctors all the time and i'm

1562
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,160
like well what is your brain

1563
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:37,599
what blood tests determine what what

1564
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,640
kind of b12 is actually in your brain

1565
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:39,839
there's no blood test that could

1566
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:41,200
determine that

1567
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:42,960
did they stick a needle inside your

1568
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:44,240
skull right into your brain draw it out

1569
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:47,040
and be like yeah your brain

1570
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:48,400
brain has plenty of b12 nobody knows

1571
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,839
nobody knows how the central nervous

1572
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,960
system works out there but what i get

1573
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:52,240
from spirit of the compassion is you've

1574
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,839
got to have your b12

1575
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:55,440
that's got to be the right one of course

1576
00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:59,119
that's the vimergy by the way i'm not

1577
00:52:55,440 --> 00:53:01,839
sponsored but that's the vimergy b12

1578
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:01,839
so

1579
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:08,800
i'm just saying that a lot of people are

1580
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:10,480
taught a lot of bad habits and we're not

1581
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:11,839
taught anything from the start that's

1582
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:14,160
that we're not taught

1583
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:15,200
how to eat right from the start that's

1584
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:17,200
the whole thing

1585
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,880
you know what's funny if you were taught

1586
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:22,480
how to eat right from the start

1587
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:24,480
okay if you were taught how to eat right

1588
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:27,680
from the very beginning

1589
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:29,119
all right you guys you would

1590
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:30,960
you would there'd be a whole different

1591
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:32,319
game going on

1592
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:33,680
whole different game going on so if

1593
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:34,960
everybody was throwing the cheeseburger

1594
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:36,079
if you were taught how to eat right

1595
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,160
right from the start

1596
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:40,640
for years like everything the

1597
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:42,160
institutions taught us how to eat right

1598
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:43,359
medical science and research taught us

1599
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,880
how to eat right which they don't

1600
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:46,800
obviously right

1601
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:48,240
institutions taught us how to eat right

1602
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,880
school systems taught us how to eat

1603
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,400
right

1604
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:52,640
our families taught us how to eat right

1605
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:54,400
because of that being passed down right

1606
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:56,720
if we all knew if we all knew how to

1607
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:58,000
take care of ourselves

1608
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:59,520
well a couple things would go wrong

1609
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,200
terribly the medical industry would just

1610
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:03,040
collapse so they can't have that they

1611
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:04,800
need you to eat wrong

1612
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:06,240
you know and i never did i ever tell you

1613
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,599
guys

1614
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:09,040
there's a whole bunch of plants in

1615
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:10,000
alternate medicine you know what plants

1616
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:13,280
are

1617
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:15,760
no plants are there experts

1618
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:16,640
planted in alternative medicine by

1619
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,160
conventional

1620
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:20,880
the conventional industry the medical

1621
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:24,400
industry to try to keep on

1622
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:27,040
feeding people the bad trends and and

1623
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:31,040
ingraining it in everybody

1624
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:33,760
so that you stay sick so there's molds

1625
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:35,119
and plants all in the industry

1626
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:36,480
alternative industry you guys don't even

1627
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:38,480
know it

1628
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:39,680
the friendliest faces you guys have no

1629
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,359
idea

1630
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:43,440
and they they were given money they were

1631
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:44,000
given deals deals were made contracts

1632
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:46,319
were signed

1633
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,920
and they were put out there to make sure

1634
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:49,920
that you hear the same old crap

1635
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:51,359
your brain needs lots of fat that's a

1636
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,000
great way to make sure your alzheimer's

1637
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:54,640
gets so much

1638
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,240
worse down the road you can add hot

1639
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,599
pepper to this right here so i got some

1640
00:54:56,240 --> 00:55:00,400

but that's mashed potatoes with peas

1648
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:14,880
the peas aren't cooked to death they're

1649
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:16,640

1650
