00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,199
you guys want your brains to shrink

191
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,479
because your brain will shrink when it

192
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:02,560
bathes in acids for too many years

193
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,840
that's what will happen your brain will

194
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,960
shrink

195
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:09,840
when it's bathing in a bowl of acid your

196
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,919
skull becomes like a bowl of acid more

197
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,240
kombucha tea

198
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:17,120
more vinegar do vinegar shots let me do

199
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,919
my apple cider gummies more

200
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,080
more caffeine

201
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,120
did i say that one already more kombucha

202
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,319
tea

203
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:29,199
say that one already probably point is

204
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:31,120
is that all these things we do make us

205
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,039
really acidic and then our diets are

206
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,000
really acidic they are

207
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:38,800
and so we basically bathe in assets and

208
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,759
we we're not putting anything back in

209
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,479
we're not putting anything back in we're

210
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,919
not nothing's going back in here

211
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,840
because you know why

212
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,000

00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,919

people and trolls working for corporate

389
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,800
at the other juicer companies to try to

off free shipping that's the whole thing

423
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:04,079
so i'm gonna run some kale through here

424
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,920
okay

425
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,279
so i got a kale leaf right here and i'm

426
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,440
gonna put it in

427
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,480
right

428
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,399
now

429
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,320
what i love to do is i love to juice

430
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,000
leafy greens and i'll mix a little bit

431
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,079
of celery with it

432
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,720
there's nothing wrong with that because

433
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:22,560
you can use celery juice to juice with

434
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,440
other things but if you want the benefit

435
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:27,279
of celery by itself that's another game

436
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,360
but if you want the benefit of leafy

437
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:31,519
greens by themselves you can put a

438
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,920
celery stick or two in there too but you

439
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:36,399
get the benefits of the leafy green if

440
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:39,120
you want the celery by itself you do the

441
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:42,720
celery by itself right

442
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,720
so i'm running a little kale in here

443
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,320
what i love about the juicer it's quiet

444
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:52,160
i can juice it five in the morning and i

445
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,240
don't wake up the house

446
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,480
it's just what i love about it anthony

447
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:59,360
best thing i bought myself deborah said

448
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,360
deborah for bone

449
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:06,000
we're on this we're on the power of the

450
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,639
leafy greens is what we're talking about

451
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,759
i'm running leafy green through the

452
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,320
juicer

453
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:15,040
so right now i'm running hail through

454
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:17,519
the juicer just so you know g culligan

455
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,720
says are you juicing kale yes dinosaur

456
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,040
kale

457
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,120
which is a form of medicine now the

458
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,680
thing about dinosaur kale it's

459
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,759
practically an herb

460
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,120
it should not be listed as just

461
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:32,079
professors

462
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,880
right it shouldn't be listed as

463
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:39,199
kale as in just kale it shouldn't be

464
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,199
listed as just a green

465
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,040
yeah i mean that's so gabriella says i

466
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,720
didn't buy it because some videos on

467
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,040
youtube say the juicy's coming out a

468
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,720
little bit warm right

469
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,360
yeah

470
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,360
not mine

471
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:04,000
all juicers by the way every last one of

472
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:07,039
them

473
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,280
you know it doesn't come out icy cold

474
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:11,039
but mine doesn't come out hot my juice

475
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,839
doesn't come out hot it comes out pretty

476
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:17,439
much the same temperature

477
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:18,720
so i'm so i'm juicing right now the kale

478
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,319
we're talking about the power of leafy

479
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,240
greens so let's talk about that a little

480
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,839
bit

481
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,360
so

482
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:28,240
kale

483
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:30,640
really should be

484
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:34,160
considered an earth

485
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:36,559
it should take the herb title

486
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,799
is what it should do

487
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:40,320
because it has that kind of power

488
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,600
prevention realm good to see you it

489
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,120
depends on the temperature of the

490
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,039
produce you hit it right on the nose you

491
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:48,480
said it better than i would that's so

492
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:50,480
true when you do when you do juice you

493
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,320
juice it cold your produce when it's

494
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,480
cold

495
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:57,520
kat ledoux says this is a cold pressed

496
00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:00,000
juice or not warm at all not cold either

497
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,600
but it doesn't heat it exactly but see

498
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,520
what happens is did you hear what

499
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,600
happened you guys

500
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,440
you hear that and i feel bad someone saw

501
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,360
some youtube videos

502
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,760
people know this juicer is medical

503
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,840
medium connection like this is the

504
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,400
connect this juicer they all know that

505
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,080
the mm-900 is is a medical medium thing

506
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,520
because of the fact that i'm working

507
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,480
with the company for with this juicer

508
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,440
right

509
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,840

510
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,000

on every level

513
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:34,080
because of the fact that i hear a voice

514
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:36,160
people

515
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,320

560
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,640
you guys care and that just knowing you

561
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,480
care just

562
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,480
this makes me feel like warm and fuzzy

563
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,720
inside

564
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,720
all right

565
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,840
okay so

566
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,840
here we go

567
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,360
i just want to show you one thing right

568
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,640
here which is incredible we're talking

569
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,720
about the powers of leafy greens if you

570
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,480
guys already have a juicer and you say

571
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,159
well oh he's just trying to show us the

572
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,600
juicer let me go just stick around

573
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,280
because we're talking about leafy greens

574
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,039
things you need to know why it's

575
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,400
critical i was talking about the acidity

576
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,320
in the body i also want to talk about

577
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,080
antioxidants because leafy greens have a

578
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,000
really high level of antioxidants and i

579
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,840
want to talk about oxidation and how we

580
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,960
slowly oxidize

581
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:05,039
and that's important to know so the pulp

582
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,280
is dry right

583
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,960
that pulp is really dry compared to any

584
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,280
other juicer so

585
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,600
you would have to run double that kale

586
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,760
through there to get what you what you

587
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:18,080
just see in that tray

588
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,240
you would have to run double the celery

589
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,159
sticks and double the kale to see what's

590
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,200
in that tray right there and this stuff

591
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:27,840
is dry it's like bone dry in there okay

592
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:30,480
so i wanted to show you that

593
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:34,080
so let's do a little bit of a let's

594
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,080
strain this really quick okay

595
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:42,640
so what i'm doing is

596
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:45,840
pouring this in here we're making a

597
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:49,280
really strong leafy green shop

598
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:51,120
this is two celery sticks right

599
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,159
two celery sticks

600
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,240
and

601
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:56,400
a bunch of kale a whole bunch of kale in

602
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:59,200
there right of course i

603
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:02,400
think i made a mess so i'm just getting

604
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,000
this out getting this in here

605
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,520
and any left over you can let it drip

606
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,520
right back into the container if you

607
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,880
want to but i'm making a very potent

608
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:13,640
little

609
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,640
leafy green drink for the moment

610
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:20,640
get that back up here

611
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,640
that's why we're live

612
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,799
nothing better than bloopers pamela why

613
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,360
do you have to strain it after you

614
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:29,200
juiced it you don't have to strain this

615
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,760
one after you juice this one

616
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,840
you don't have to at all right

617
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,679
but i usually strain because i'm trying

618
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,039
to strain the celery

619
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,880
that's why

620
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,720
okay

621
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,440
and all juices

622
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:46,000
any juicer you do you got to strain it

623
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,480
every single juice you have to strain

624
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
any juicer you have to

625
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,640
so anyway

626
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,159
here we go so this is a really really

627
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,120
potent

628
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,000
kale tonic right there

629
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,480
all right

630
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,679
it's these pa the power of these leafy

631
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,679

okay

646
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:35,120
to move our health forward fast

647
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:37,360
you need the antioxidants

648
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,200
you need something called phytochemical

649
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:42,640
compounds

650
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,960
chlorophyll does not work

651
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:48,400
by itself

652
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:50,320
chlorophyll has to be with every other

653
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:53,039
chemical compound

654
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:56,080
if you buy a chlorophyll supplement and

655
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:58,080
do the green drops in the water you are

656
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,799
never going to get any chlorophyll that

657
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:03,120
works the body will pee it out or you'll

658
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:06,320
just go to bathroom and eliminate it out

659
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:08,960
chlorophyll cannot be separated from the

660
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,720
rest of the properties in the green

661
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,360
i you guys are going to repeat myself

662
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,279
chlorophyll cannot be separated and work

663
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:17,600
if it's separated from the rest of the

664
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:19,919
phytochemical compounds from the leafy

665
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,840
greens it's empty and does not work by

666
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:24,000
itself chlorophyll supplements are one

667
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,520
of the biggest scams in snake oil and

668
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,559
everything else you want to call it out

669
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,159
there

670
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:30,000
and anytime you see somebody playing

671
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,360
around with chlorophyll as if they're

672
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,919
doing something for themselves and

673
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,840
trying to sell chlorophyll prop stuff it

674
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,840
never helped anyone in the past it never

675
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,679
will it doesn't make you alkaline it

676
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,000
can't neutralize acids it can't turn

677
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:44,320
your life around chlorophyll on its own

678
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,960
cannot work this is really important to

679
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,640
know if you only take that nugget here

680
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,240
and that's it

681
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,720
you're helping yourself so you don't

682
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:55,440
fall into the chlorophyll trap it's the

683
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,960
chlorophyll trap out there

684
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,159
keep that in mind if

685
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:02,640
if it's the only thing you take so when

686
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:05,679
you when you see out there somebody like

687
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:09,039
tom i'm doctor sean susha i'm doctors

688
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:10,320
intro i'm doctor

689
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:12,640
and i have to tell you about this

690
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,400
chlorophyll supplement we have it's a

691
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,320
great chlorophyll supplement and it's

692
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,320
made me rich i have a mansion because of

693
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:21,200
it in a yacht

694
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:23,840
oh all the instagram influencers are

695
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,840
using chlorophyll now because of me top

696
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,520
five ways to get yourself better make

697
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:30,000
sure you do your chlorophyll drops if

698
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:32,240
you get suckered into that

699
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,400
you're being screwed over

700
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,159
chlorophyll can only stay intact and

701
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,840
actually work if the phytochemical

702
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,279
compounds and the antioxidants and the

703
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,679
polyphenols and everything else is

704
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:43,760
connected with it if it's all connected

705
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,520
in the same spot where it came from it

706
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:48,799
can't be separated into a supplement

707
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,799
where you remove the chlorophyll

708
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:55,200
leafy greens

709
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,559
megan you're laughing leafy greens

710
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,240
plus the chlorophyll supplements they

711
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:02,240
add natural flavor citric acid and

712
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:04,559
alcohol and a terrible glycerin too

713
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,559
right

714
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:11,039
leafy greens have antioxidants them to

715
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:13,520
turn your life around

716
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:15,440
that's a type of antioxidant that's not

717
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,760
registered on the scale of research in

718
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,080
science and what they're doing with food

719
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,240
science food science hasn't picked up a

720
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,080
fraction of what's in a leafy green

721
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,400
they're not even studying leafy greens

722
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,640
and what's in there

723
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,880
so it's important to know why does

724
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,520
juicer why does the juicer parsley turn

725
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:36,000
into gel that's not that's

726
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,120
actually partially does that in any

727
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,559
juicer

728
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:41,919
because parsley has chemical compounds

729
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:45,520
okay

730
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:46,880
that dry really quick parsley juice

731
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,919
dries

732
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:52,559
exceptionally fast when it's juiced it's

733
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,480
instantly drying

734
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:57,120
because what it what it has is an

735
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:59,440
alkaloid in parsley that reverses the

736
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,360
minute you juice it it's reversing the

737
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,360
process not the juicing process but what

738
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:05,679
it's doing is the plant has protective

739
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,760
measures so when a deer comes along and

740
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:09,760
eats it so this is important to know

741
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,840
okay all right this is really important

742
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,520
now

743
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,520
this is probably one of the most

744
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:18,720
important things you can learn about

745
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,720
parsley by the way

746
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:26,799
okay so what's happening is when a deer

747
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:26,799
comes along parsley's a wild food

748
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,279
it's actually a wild food it's not

749
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,480
growing wild anymore where you where

750
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:35,760
they're picking it and putting in the

751
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,919
supermarket they're growing it for you

752
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:40,559
parsley is a leafy green which is an

753
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:42,640
herb and i call herb leafy green is so

754
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:45,760
powerful and so strong

755
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:49,120
because it's wild

756
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:52,240
that when a deer comes along

757
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:54,080
and goes into somebody's garden

758
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,640
right

759
00:27:54,080 --> 00:28:00,120
hey i really like that parsley let me

760
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,120
have some of that

761
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:07,840
the parsley quickly sends an alkaloid to

762
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:10,399
the injured area of the plant to seal up

763
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,799
the juices to stop the juices from

764
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,799
running

765
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:19,360
isn't that incredible when you juice

766
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:22,559
parsley that phytochemical compound that

767
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:24,720
alkaloid is trying to try to literally

768
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:27,520
stop the juice from occurring it's

769
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:30,080
trying to harden the juice

770
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:32,559
so your juice is becoming gel when it's

771
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,559
parsley this this this is incredible

772
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:36,640
information it's it's medical medium

773
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:38,159
information it's not out there

774
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,399
because i don't use anybody's

775
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,080
information never have never will it's

776
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:44,399
all medical media and that's why

777
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,760
everybody gets better who's applying it

778
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:47,760
and everything else as they're going you

779
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,120
know using the information and changing

780
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,279
their lives

781
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:54,080
that's why nobody knew what celery juice

782
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:55,360
did ever yeah celery grew before i was

783
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,399
alive

784
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:00,000
yeah the 1800s they grew it yeah people

785
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:01,279
ate it in their crew today and they've

786
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,120
chopped it up and threw it in their tuna

787
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:04,399
salads but nobody knew how to use it

788
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:07,840
therapeutically and what it did for

789
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:10,000
anybody that's medical medium info

790
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:12,320
but anyway the whole point is parsley

791
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,520
has that phytochemical compound to stop

792
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,159
it

793
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:19,039
from bleeding

794
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:20,720
and so when you juice parsley you see it

795
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:22,720
gel quick

796
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,240
is what happens

797
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,080
so that's something that we should

798
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,520
that's good that we covered right now

799
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,840
okay

800
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,840
so

801
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,399
all right back

802
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,080
back to work

803
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,279
we're here you guys

804
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,559
all right so let's talk about this a

805
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:43,840
little bit

806
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,840
what you have in here

807
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,600
okay

808
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,880
is the skull thickener

809
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,880
basically what you're doing is you're

810
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:57,520
putting back

811
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,360
calcium nutrients other other other

812
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:01,919
chemical compounds

813
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:04,159
back into the bones because you're

814
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:06,080
neutralizing the acids inside the body

815
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:08,799
so you neutralize your acids inside the

816
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:11,760
body that's how you really do it not

817
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:14,720
from a fraudulent alkaline ionizer water

818
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:17,440
machine which poisons you

819
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:20,080
i can't tell you how many attacks i get

820
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,480
how many fake crap and fake stories and

821
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:25,360
fake all kinds of garbage and everything

822
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:27,760
else always gets propelled

823
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:30,559
by somebody behind the scenes that's

824
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,559
selling alkaline ionizer water machines

825
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:34,399
every time medical medium is under a new

826
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:36,960
attack

827
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:38,799
a new form of evil

828
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,880
it's always because the person who

829
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:43,520
started it we always find out it goes

830
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,279
right back to the alkaline ionizer water

831
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:47,120
crew

832
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:49,600
that's what we always find out

833
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:52,480
when we start doing our research

834
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:55,120
every fake story fake jab fake hit piece

835
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:57,519
fake everything every attack you trace

836
00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:00,720
it back to the alkaline ionizer water

837
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:03,760
crew how come isn't that interesting

838
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,840
because i've told everybody something

839
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:08,320
very important the alkaline ionizer

840
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:10,000
water machines do not make you alkaline

841
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,279
they poison you with toxic heavy metals

842
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,559
from electricity hitting the metal

843
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:16,720
plates inside no matter what brand it is

844
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:20,000
and you know what bring it on man bring

845
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:23,360
it on so anyway the point is that makes

846
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,799
you alkaline right there

847
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:27,919
and that alkaline

848
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:31,039
alkalinity is critical to saving your

849
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:34,720
bones your teeth and everything

850
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:38,480
is wheatgrass juice a healing food yes

851
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:41,039
yes plung yes it is in fact you can run

852
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:43,519
your wheatgrass through this juicer

853
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:45,600
because i do i run wheatgrass for this

854
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:47,840
juicer too absolutely wheatgrass is

855
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,840
amazing

856
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,640
love wheatgrass

857
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:54,000
love it love it love it all right you

858
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,679
guys let's let's do something else at

859
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,279
the juicer we're having some fun this is

860
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:00,640
a kale tonic right here which is

861
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:02,320
absolutely incredible

862
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,159
let's run a little parsley through it

863
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,080
too

864
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:07,600
so many juicers out there have metal

865
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:10,480
gears

866
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:12,320
metal gears that go like this

867
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,559
and by the way some of those hit stories

868
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:16,240
those hit pieces on me too we find out

869
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:18,640
they come from the apple cider

870
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,799
corporations

871
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,080
we find out they come from the caffeine

872
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:24,399
industry

873
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,840
all the hits on medical media we trace

874
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:28,960
them back to the caffeine industry we

875
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:31,120
trace back the apple cider companies

876
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,679
kombucha tea companies that pay all

877
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,799
their people to try to take out medical

878
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:36,880
media

879
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:38,559
it's amazing anyway and the juicer

880
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,840
companies now are starting to do like

881
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:43,600
they're starting to like pay all their

882
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:45,360
trolls to say oh the mm-900 sucks oh it

883
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:48,480
sucks oh it does

884
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:50,399
it's only paid for itself about 20 times

885
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,640
already for me

886
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:53,919
anyway the metal gears in these juicers

887
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,440
and that's another reason why the juicer

888
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:57,039
companies hate me because they all many

889
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,960
of them are using metal gear so that

890
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:00,799
this is the the cold pressed juicers are

891
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,919
using metal gears the metal gears do

892
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:03,760
this

893
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:05,600
and you know what happens here's a gear

894
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:08,000
here's a gear there's the two gears you

895
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:11,000
ready you turn on the machine cranking

896
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
means

897
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,840
okay that's really smart what is that

898
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,559
that's metal on metal that's like your

899
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:20,480
car breaks when you lose your car brakes

900
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:22,480
and the rotors being hit by a metal

901
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:25,760
brake pad and you're like screeching

902
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:27,679
down the road going

903
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,760
that's real smart and then when you take

904
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:32,480
your car into the mechanic the mechanic

905
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:35,200
has to blow off all that brake metal

906
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:37,279
dust and say you need new rotors sir

907
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,120
you need new rotors man so there's

908
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:40,640
that's that so when you get the juicers

909
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,840
that have the metal gears going like

910
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:46,559
this it wears and tears and guess what

911
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:48,720
i've seen that i purchased those juicers

912
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:50,720
i've used them and i saw the wear and

913
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:53,279
tear on the metal gears

914
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,519
and was like oh that's metal going

915
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:58,720
in me

916
00:33:55,519 --> 00:34:00,880
that's particles of metal going into me

917
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,360
oh that's real smart

918
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,880
that's why i like this juicer

919
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:07,840
all right let's have some fun

920
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,840
just a little bit more

921
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,359
i'm gonna juice a little bit of ginger

922
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:19,280
so i'm gonna take i have two of these

923
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:21,040
right because every time i lend out my

924
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,879
juicer i never get it back so i happen

925
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,480
to have another one but i don't want to

926
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:26,720
like waste time cleaning this even

927
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,879
though it's only a four minute process

928
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:30,800
what i'm gonna do is

929
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:34,679
pop on another one really quick and

930
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,679
juice a little bit of ginger

931
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,320
so let's do that

932
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,159
so i'm gonna make a ginger turmeric shot

933
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:43,520
right

934
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,720
i don't know if you guys are excited

935
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:48,520
about that but i'm gonna do a little

936
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,520
ginger tumeric shot

937
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:55,760
you guys i was just live on amazon so

938
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,280
even though this was a leafy this is a

939
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,599
leafy green show we're doing the power

940
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,440
of leafy greens right

941
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:03,760
i still have cucumbers here and i got

942
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,440
like zucchinis and i got sweet potatoes

943
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:08,079
right here

944
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:11,119
and i just gobbled down half my stew

945
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:12,720
so i just i just made on amazon live

946
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:14,720
this incredible stew right here but i

947
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,880
gobbled it down in between

948
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:19,200
and says my old juicer with the metal

949
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,960
gears had magnet at the bottom of the

950
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,040
juice collection container now this

951
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:25,440
makes sense

952
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:28,680
dear lord that's the scariest thing i've

953
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,680
ever heard

954
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:37,359
that's some scary stuff

955
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,359
that's some scary stuff

956
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:45,560
yeah it had a magnet at the bottom

957
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:50,720
exactly

958
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:52,240
see and meanwhile those fairy companies

959
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,640
are throwing people on my feet

960
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:56,320
everywhere commenting like oh the mm-900

961
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,520
sucks

962
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,359
and they're paid by these juicer

963
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:02,720
companies it's like is there any like

964
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:02,720
integrity left man

965
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,720
whatever

966
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:09,280
all right let's go let's do some let's

967
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:11,520
go some ginger and turmeric

968
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,200
the thing is like this look

969
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,520

you know

971
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:21,200

972
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:23,359
is just up front

973
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:25,040
and and just straight out

974
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:26,960
if the juicer has metal gears it's got

975
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,880
metal gears it's an ionizer water

976
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,400
machine it's got metal plates and it's

977
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,880
leaching toxic heavy metal corroded

978
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:35,280
metals gotta be straight out about it

979
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:39,480
i mean it just is what it is

980
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,480
all right so what i'm doing you guys

981
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,520

through your juicers how many of you

1001
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,480
guys run turmeric through your juicers

1002
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,599
right how do we clean turmeric stains

1003
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,280
now

1004
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:31,599
turmeric stains are never any fun i use

1005
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,280
bon ami but it's never any fun it just

1006
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:35,040
isn't

1007
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,480
you know

1008
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,240
so what i'm going to do is i'm going to

1009
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:41,040
run a little bit of this let me get my

1010
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:43,680
cap back on because i i actually

1011
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:45,440
put it over here

1012
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:48,079
so i want to show you something about

1013
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,079
this cache

1014
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:53,119
why do you have to change the attachment

1015
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:56,320
to make the shot i don't actually have

1016
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:58,560
to i want the shot to see i just ran

1017
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,480
really dark rich

1018
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:03,040
leafy greens in here

1019
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:05,280
so pia what happened was but i want to

1020
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:08,720
make a turmeric ginger shot

1021
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:10,160
and i want to see the the turmeric color

1022
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,800
and you're not going to see the turmeric

1023
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:15,359
color from the turmeric ginger shot

1024
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,880
because i would have to clean the unit

1025
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:18,240
and spend like three four minutes

1026
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,440
cleaning the unit i don't want to waste

1027
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,599
your guys time

1028
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,680
so that's all so i just i put another i

1029
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:25,040
put another unit on here so i didn't

1030
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:27,599
have to do that it's just that that

1031
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:29,599
leafy green that's gonna you won't see

1032
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:30,560
the turmeric ginger shot it'll just look

1033
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,800
like that

1034
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:34,079
it'll look like this you won't be able

1035
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,839
to see it so i want you to be able to

1036
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:37,119
see it if you make a ginger turmeric

1037
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:38,320
shot you know one day it's just that i'm

1038
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:39,920
trying to do a bunch of things at once

1039
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:42,000
that's why

1040
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:44,079
so i'm cutting some ginger here now the

1041
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,720
thing is with ginger

1042
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:48,160
okay it's really strong you don't need a

1043
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,640
lot

1044
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:53,040
that's for sure that ginger is that

1045
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,880
ginger bites you know the one thing

1046
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:57,119
about ginger that i've always found is

1047
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,480
it it's sometimes it's hotter than

1048
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:01,040
cayenne to me

1049
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,880
for me which is really i mean i i

1050
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:05,520
haven't heard that too often but

1051
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:07,760
sometimes ginger can be so

1052
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:10,320
so spicy right

1053
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,760
so you want to sip it probably over time

1054
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,440
and not go

1055
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,040
throw it down right

1056
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:18,160
so i'm going to do that and i got some

1057
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:21,520
turmeric over here too

1058
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:25,599
okay now turmeric i peel the skin

1059
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:27,520
right if you're interested in the um

1060
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:29,680

the link in the description and see all

1071
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:50,000
the previous lives on there what i do is

1072
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:52,240
i like to peel the turmeric i take the

1073
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,680
skin off of tumeric

1074
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:57,119
this is a rhizome that's really potent

1075
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,720
turmeric right

1076
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:00,640
but you want to get the skin off you

1077
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,560
don't have to get the skin off you can

1078
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:06,240
keep it with the skin on

1079
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:07,680
but the skin's got a really potent

1080
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:10,560
potent um

1081
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:12,319
chemical compound in the alkaloid family

1082
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:14,240
that makes it

1083
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:16,319
not as tasty

1084
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:18,400
you can keep the skin on i like to take

1085
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:20,160
the skin off there's nothing wrong with

1086
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,680
peeling back the skin

1087
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,680
on on that

1088
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:25,760
that tumeric okay

1089
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:28,079
now i leave the skin on the ginger and

1090
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,599
you can peel back the ginger skin too

1091
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:31,200
you don't have to keep that on there too

1092
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:34,240
but i do keep it on a lot of times all

1093
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:35,680
right so what i'm doing is

1094
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,839
i'm gonna run

1095
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:39,119
this in

1096
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:42,400
here okay

1097
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:42,400
so i got the juicer on

1098
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,000
i'm gonna put turmeric through here

1099
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:56,720
i'm gonna put some ginger pieces in here

1100
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:00,240
that's just pouring out nicely

1101
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,240
i know you guys might not be able to see

1102
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:09,839
nice piece of turmeric i'm running some

1103
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,839
ginger through here

1104
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:14,319
this is a celery juicer model but it

1105
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:16,720
juices other things better than any

1106
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:20,319
juicer out there now i run a celery

1107
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:22,000
stick through here is what i do okay now

1108
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:24,160
run a celery stick through you can drink

1109
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000
it straight just like that the juice is

1110
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,920
in here you can make a shot just like

1111
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,800
that i tend to run

1112
