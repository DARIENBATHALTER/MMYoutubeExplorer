19
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,360
you guys you get sick

20
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,160
okay and then you're on your own all

21
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,680
right

22
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,200
you get sick and you're on your own and

23
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,280
you might be somebody that's like

24
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,120
that's not true you know i had a symptom

25
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,960
i went to my doctor

26
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,559
my doctor's giving me some information

27
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,000
you know i have support and that's good

28
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:01,199
but what happens if you're

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,280
on your fourth doctor and your fifth

30
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,040
doctor and then your specialist and now

31
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,479
your neurologist

32
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,320
and you're now you know at another

33
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,720
doctor and so forth and it goes on like

34
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,360
that

35
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,439
and it ends up like oh my god i really

36
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,799
am on my own research in science doesn't

37
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,520

38
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,119
and how come i'm still sick yeah i go to

39
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,840
my doctor and i'm getting help but why

40
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:23,200
am i still

41
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:26,479
sick and it's because you know the

42
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,439
health and wellness uh health scene

43
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,240
all of it's always been the wild wild

44
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:33,280
west

45
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,759
and don't get fooled by flash and

46
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,280
trends that are like you know the

47
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,960
recyclable

48
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,600
they're like recycled and they're in the

49
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,720
out of the old trend recycle bin from

50
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,520
the past

51
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,200
you know and they can those trends can

52
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,240
actually be really deceiving they can

53
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,119
appear like

54
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,799
they work or they're good or you know

55
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,079
hey apple cider vinegar

56
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,680
can fix your lupus no it can't um

57
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,840
activated charcoal can fix your

58
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,320
gastroparesis no it can't

59
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,159
um you know it's like you know it's like

60
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,840
it's always been like that

61
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,239
and research in science doesn't know why

62
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,879
people are sick and it's really sad

63
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,400
and if you're not sick and you're not so

64
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:13,440
sick and you only got a little bit of a

65
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,000
symptom

66
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,360
you can play around in that land and

67
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,599
those mirages seem

68
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,200
real you know it's kind of fun hey do

69
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,720
some fermented foods

70
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,720
hey do a little apple cider vinegar

71
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,120
whatever and you can do that but the

72
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,440
bottom line is when you're really sick

73
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,519
and you're really looking for answers it

74
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,519
really has been the wild wild west and

75
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,000
you know what i think about in the past

76
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,879
all like 35 years of being in here and

77
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
doing this

78
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:41,120
35 years of this and i think about it so

79
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,599
many people

80
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,800
their stories what they've gone through

81
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,599
being really sick and they

82
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,239
tried all the things you see out there

83
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,400
now

84
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,800
they've tried it all they've tried the

85
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,959
food combining they tried the

86
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,879
they tried to you know they tried to

87
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,480
know wheat and the food combining and

88
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,159
the apple cider vinegar and activated

89
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,599
charcoal and the fish oil and the

90
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,640
probiotics and

91
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:07,040
you know in the candida cleanses and

92
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,360
did all of that and they've tried that

93
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,920
and the parasitical cleanses and

94
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,560
and their stories haven't been heard

95
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,159
because it's

96
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,840
long before social media and now

97
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,440
everybody's swimming in the same stuff

98
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,560
the same recycled stuff

99
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,440
that old stuff that's come back people

100
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,200
are playing in it

101
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,799
people are you know doing stuff but when

102
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,840
you're really sick we need more than

103
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,920
that

104
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,519
and it's important so what kind of

105
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,599
symptom do you have

106
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,599
you know what's the symptom do you have

107
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,920
what's the condition do you have like

108
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,360
you

109
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,280
have let's talk about it because i want

110
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,760
to answer some questions and everything

111
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,400
so um so that's let's do that so let's

112
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,360
do that

113
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,319
and the bottom line is for so many

114
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,720
people out there

115
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,480
when you really get sick and you're

116
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,480
really bogged down and you lose that

117
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,920
quality of life with your symptom

118
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,920
and then your condition and you're

119
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,280
getting a diagnosis after diagnosis

120
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,640
after diagnosis

121
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:03,599
and you know it's really difficult and

122
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,640
what i like is i like to know where's

123
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,040
the answers

124
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,319
where are they like are there answers

125
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,680
because reasons research and science

126
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,120
doesn't have the answers since that's

127
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,040
what medical medium information has

128
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,439
always been about if you're new here

129
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,120
you're you're in a land of let's get

130
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,160

131
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,040
answers let's down to

132
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,880
get down to the root causes and you know

133
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,759
let's not get lost and have the blind

134
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,240
leading the blind

135
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,520

136
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,040
so i'm going to look over here to the

137
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,840
monitors and

138
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,080

140
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,280
pounds feeling healthier

141
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,560
thank you so much for opening my eyes to

142
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,120
a lot of misinformation

143
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,000
okay that's an incredible that's an

144
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,160
incredible comment

145
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,199
right there there linda in you know i

146
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,520
hope everybody

147
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,880
like sees or hears that comment and

148
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,160
what's that about it's like

149
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,000
there's tremendous amounts of

150
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,360
misinformation out there and

151
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,520
but it seems like all that

152
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,639
misinformation is good because when not

153
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,440
so sick people

154
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,039
use it it's deceiving so linda must have

155
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,320
really been through something she must

156
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,759
have been really going through some

157
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,840
things like the weight

158
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,360
and and you weren't feeling good and you

159
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,639
must have tried some things right linda

160
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,160
because that's the whole thing and

161
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,240
but what you'll find right now with

162
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,800
social media and everything is that

163
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,080
you know the same old recycled stuff all

164
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,600
swimming around out there and when

165
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,960
you're not so sick and you're a person

166
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,000
with a symptom and you're trying this

167
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,240
and this and you're

168
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,360
selling this or doing that what happens

169
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,199
is it looks like hey

170
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,039
maybe that person's got the answer maybe

171
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,360
that's it but when in the end

172
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:31,520
it's all back to the same old recycled

173
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,520
bin of old health information

174
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,759
and never got people who really were

175
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,000
struggling better and that's that's

176
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,039
it makes all the difference it just does

177
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,240
you guys

178
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:44,080
is there anything you would so um surrey

179
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,479
tuck says is there anything you would

180
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:50,160
recommend for a seven-year-old boy

181
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:53,520
who has just started developing ticks so

182
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:56,720
okay so what i would do okay if my child

183
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,160
was developing ticks okay um you know i

184
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,680
would i would bring this

185
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,800
information to the doctor first of all i

186
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,720
would bring the information to the

187
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,720
doctor with ticks and spasms because

188
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:09,199
ticks and spasms and twitches

189
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,639
all that's neurological so what i would

190
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,880
do is i would bring

191
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,120
the medical medium information to my

192
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,639
doctor but i would look into the book

193
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,160
and you start seeing that

194
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:22,639
toxic heavy metals play a role they're

195
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,160
the cause of so much of that and i get

196
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,960
asked by doctors all the time

197
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,240
and what happens is people don't realize

198
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,479
half of my day

199
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,000
like a big part of my day is answering

200
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,759
doctor's questions

201
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
so that's what happens so doctors

202
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,759
contact you know they contact

203
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,680
us i get on the phone with them and

204
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,280
they're saying what do i do when i have

205
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,720
children with ticks what do i do and i

206
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,680
have children with spasms and i'll tell

207
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,759
the doctors look

208
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,199
you're looking at toxic heavy metals

209
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,160
you're looking at mercury you're looking

210
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,479
at aluminum

211
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,080
so what i tell the doctor is look here's

212
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,120
the stuff here's the different protocols

213
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,080
you can work with

214
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,759
and so they learn about this and and and

215
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,360
so a big part of my day is answering

216
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,800
doctor questions and that's one of the

217
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,680
questions that i answer for doctors all

218
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,319
the time

219
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,360
and it's really important so and i tell

220
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,360
doctors hey

221
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,199

223
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,759
um you know and that's what i tell

224
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:17,759
doctors to help their patients with so

225
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:20,400
it's a really good question

226
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:23,440
why do i keep getting sinus and ear

227
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:26,160
infections that's from tina thomas

228
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,919
um so you obviously been to your doctor

229
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,520
you've been to your practitioners and

230
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,280

236
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,080
and i mean once again though i would i

237
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,759
mean if i was dealing with that dealing

238
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,800
with ear infections dealing with sinus

239
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,160
infections

240
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:49,520
um and i had an ent that that uh

241
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:52,879

245
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,960
always what they're always um

246
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,319
ears nose and throat doctors are always

247
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,080
concerned about is look i don't want to

248
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,120
use too many antibiotics on my patients

249
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,759
that's what i hear

250
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,759
you know and they'll ask me like how do

251
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,160
you do this how do you avoid the

252
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,479
antibiotics because doctors don't

253
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,080
want to keep on prescribing antibiotics

254
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:17,360
every 10 seconds i mean i talked to so

255
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,280
many doctors they're like look

256
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,400
i've been prescribing antibiotics for 20

257
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,160
years in my practice

258
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,240
all the time for all these different

259
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,039
things what do i do and i said well

260
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,800
first of all

261
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,560
it's about getting down to the true

262
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,800
cause of the root cause like if it's

263
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,360
bacteria you're concerned about

264
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,959
what bacteria is and so the doctors

265
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,399
think and i had me and he talked to me

266
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:37,200
last week and he said what do you think

267
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,959
and i said well

268
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,360
would i would the information i got from

269
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:43,360
spirit of compassion is it streptococcus

270
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,959
and and the cnt was like you know that

271
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,680
makes a lot of sense

272
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:49,200
because um in in his wheelhouse it just

273
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,800
made tremendous amount of sense

274
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,480
and there's over 50 groups of

275
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,120
streptococcus and there's hundreds of

276
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,959
strains

277
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,720
hundreds of strains but there's over 50

278
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,920
groups many of them unidentified by

279
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,200
research and science

280
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,959
and and they get antibiotic resistance

281
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,399
so at this time i talked to the cnt

282
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,680
about it and everything i was talking to

283
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,680
them and i told them what happens is

284
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,440
they get more antibiotic resistant

285
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,640
and then you take antibiotics again and

286
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,240
you got the years nose and throat

287
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,680
infections take the antibiotics again

288
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,480
and the sinus infections chronic

289
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,920
sinusitis

290
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,240
but i talked about in cleanse the heal

291
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,160
when i was telling him i talked about it

292
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,160
that it's down to figuring out

293
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,080
streptococcus what to do to support it

294
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,920
i'm not against antibiotics you know i

295
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,959
never were because what happens is when

296
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,360
people

297
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,959
they haven't learned how to take care of

298
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,720
themselves and they haven't learned how

299
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,920
to heal and they haven't learned what to

300
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,080
do

301
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,000
and they get into a jam and it's whoa

302
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,640
what do i do i gotta get to my doctor i

303
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,959
gotta get the

304
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,160
antibiotic for my uti i gotta get the

305
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,839

my sinus infection i have to get the

307

antibiotic for the sty i have

308
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,600
and this all streptococcus you know and

309
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,360
so um

310
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,640
so it's good to learn in everything if

311
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,080

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,120
get it so just

373
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,040
what i would do what i would do though

374
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,880
with with with that is

375
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,079
morning cleanse is something you can do

376
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,120
it's easier

377
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:56,480
that's something right there so uh

378
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,480
you know when you're that busy and you

379
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,480
got that much going on maybe just start

380
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,040
with the celery juice you want to lose

381
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,480
weight

382
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,200
start with the celery juice to get the

383
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:08,399
liver less stagnant less sluggish

384
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,440
and you know just do that and that's one

385
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,800
thing you can start

386
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,040
i'm not saying that's going to get the

387
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,920
weight off it's a place to start so you

388
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,920
can get improvements wherever you can

389
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,839
and then maybe move into the morning

390
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,880
cleanse where it's just the morning

391
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,800
cleanse

392
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,720
because i know you have to work hard i

393
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,639
know you have kids i know you're you're

394
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,920
in you have 10 jobs

395
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,399
so that's what it sounds like you have

396
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,959
10 jobs going on and so

397
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,639
with that just maybe maybe look into the

398
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,920
morning cleanse go straight to that

399
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,680
in cleanse the heel that's what i

400
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,519
recommend and just say what can i do in

401
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,760
here whoa i could do the lemon water

402
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,360
how about that that could at least flush

403
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,200
your system in the morning

404
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,560
so the liver starts waking up so you can

405
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,560
start losing a little bit of weight

406
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,240
that's one way of doing it you do lemon

407
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,519
water maybe try to get a celery juice if

408
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,079
you can't do the celery juice

409
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,279
do the lemon water and then and then do

410
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,040
the rest of the morning cleanse where

411
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,959
you just eat some fruit in the morning

412
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,880
to get you through the morning so you're

413
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,560
not doing any fats in the morning

414
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,839
so this way your liver gets a chance and

415
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,200
you can start losing a little bit of

416
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,519
weight that could really help

417
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,560
and maybe it you know in the lemon water

418
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,519
is not eight ounces

419
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,800
it's 16 to 32 ounces of lemon water kind

420
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,480
of keep that in mind like

421
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,760
that's a really big orange juice right

422
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,200
here fresh squeezed orange juice from a

423
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,639
dinner tonight

424
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,040
and that's really big one i still have

425
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:24,399

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,800
let any kind of stupid talk out there

435
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,880
about

436
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,160
someone saying i tried it for seven days

437
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,160
it didn't work for me oh

438
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,600
okay great you know i love when people

439
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,079
do that out there when they're not so

440
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,480
sick

441
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,120
when you suffer from migraines that

442
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,040
means

443
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,240
you're really struggling you got a lot

444
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,079
going on there and

445
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,440
what i've noticed is the people who pick

446
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,519
on celery juice

447
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,959
the people who pick on celery juice are

448
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,320
people who

449
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,000
they don't know what it's like to suffer

450
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,000
from migraines you see

451
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,600
you see what i'm saying right they'll

452
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,560
just be like they got a little bit of

453
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,000
this or a little bit of that and they're

454
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,519
trying all these fun things and they're

455
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,279
doing their social media thing but

456
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,720
then they'll say i tried celery juice it

457
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,839
didn't work or

458
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,040
they won't talk about seller juice

459
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,160
because there's no money to be made off

460
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,240
of it you know you can't get a

461
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,839
sponsorship for celery juice on social

462
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,320
media you know so there's no money to be

463
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,959
made

464
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,120
so people keep it quiet you know and but

465
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,399

00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,079
fibroids is i talk about what causes

487
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,240
fibroids

488
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:08,320
and so when you go in here you'll see

489
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,880
what causes them and then

490
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,760
you'll learn what foods to avoid for

491
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,760
fibroids

492
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:17,279
fibroids are hungry they are hungry

493
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,880
they actually have these little blood

494
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:22,399
vessels that come out of them

495
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:24,880
and they they draw in nutrients

496
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,000
and nutrients that they like that

497
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,639
fibroids like and

498
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,839
in order to stop growing fibroids what

499
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,079
happens with a lot of women that gets

500
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,399
fibroid surgeries

501
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:35,519
um and and that's really difficult to go

502
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,320
through that

503
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,920
and what i like to do okay and i have a

504
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,279
friend that came to me recently with

505
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,199
fibroids and i said

506
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,480
you know um how are they doing my friend

507
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,680
said well my doctor says you're getting

508
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,800
better and better from

509
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,120
from all the stuff that you're

510
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,680
recommending and so they're avoiding

511
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,480
surgery

512
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,399
because her fibroids are getting better

513
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,000
and so she did a check-in recently an

514
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,360
old friend of mine she says look my

515
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,360
doctor's amazed

516
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,279
my you know i'm doing the celery juice

517
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,959
i'm staying off of eggs

518
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,040
i'm staying off of eggs my doctor was

519
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,480
very worried about that thought i needed

520
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,680
the egg protein

521
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,440
and then um i let my doctor know that

522
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,519
the anthony you said that eggs feed

523
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,560
fibroids the doctor learned something

524
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,600
and learned that

525
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,240
fibroids actually eat um eat by products

526
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,920
from eggs

527
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,279
and draw them up their draw them up

528
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,480
their blood vessels and they grow grow

529
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,320
grow

530
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,000
so that was just one example there so i

531
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,920
would just learn i would learn what

532
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,880
causes the fibroids go into the section

533
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,720
here you'll see the different

534
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,079
supplementation and protocols

535
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:36,000
you can take it to your doctor too

536
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:38,079
whatever works

537
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,040
so and there's there's thousands of

538
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,959
combinations

539
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,480
in here in cleanse the heel and medical

540
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,920
medium information medical medium books

541
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,839
it's not one protocol

542
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,600
customize it to yourself whether you're

543
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,600
plant-based whether you're you know

544
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,279
vegetarian whether you're animal protein

545
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,720

546
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:55,839
whatever whether you're keto

keto animal keto plant whatever you like

548
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,440
the whole point is it's about answers

549
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,920
and what to do and the protocols that

550
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,000
you can

551
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,279
go into your diet belief system with

552
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,319
because everybody gets sick

553
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,400
that's the whole thing you guys

554
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,280
everybody gets sick whether anybody

555
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,600
likes it or not

556
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,199
or knows about that or not everybody

557
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,360

and you'll read in the medical meaning

570
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,440
books like fatty liver

571
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,799
that's a stagnant sluggish liver and

572
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,600
high fat diets

573
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:53,600
years of high fat diets will lead to a

574
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,919
fatty liver and

575
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,280
hashimoto's is viral so you go in here

576
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,360
into the back of the book and you'll see

577
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,440
hashimoto's thyroiditis

578
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,720
thyroid nodules hypothyroidism

579
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,000
hyperthyroidism

580
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,000
and you're learning here that

581
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,600
epstein-barr virus creates all those

582
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,960
thyroid problems and you learn about

583
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,520
that and you'll learn about well what do

584
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,360
i do

585
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,840
and the book talks about that it walks

586
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:16,480
you through

587
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:18,240
um and so much information about that

588
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,840
of how it works epstein-barr isn't just

589
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,080
this one virus so

590
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:24,000
medical medium information is very

591
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,480
advanced extremely advanced and far

592
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,919
ahead of research and science by decades

593
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,400
and what research and science doesn't

594
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,640
know

595
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,160
is that there's over 60 varieties now of

596
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,360
epstein-barr virus

597
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,559
and in those 60 varieties there's

598
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,360
different kinds

599
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:40,880
and they're not easy detectable they get

600
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,480
into the thyroid

601
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,440
science research doesn't know this or

602
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,200
how it works um it creates hashimoto's

603
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,720
it sits in the liver first makes the

604
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,559
liver all stagnant and sluggish then

605
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,360
when you're doing the high fat diets

606
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:55,200
you get you know it gets problematic if

607
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:58,799
i had a fatty liver

608
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:01,200
um i would be like no eggs no butter

609
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:03,200
no milk no cheese that's what i would do

610
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,440
no eggs milk butter cheese

611
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,720
gone right and if i was an animal

612
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,799
protein person

613
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,559
i would i would minimize my animal

614
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,320
protein i'll just drop them down

615
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,919
and make sure i'm getting more of other

616
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,679
things i talk about in the books

617
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,679
go to library get the book for free so

618
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:19,120
you can learn that's what i recommend

619
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,280
don't even buy the book go to the

620
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,000
library get the book out so you didn't

621
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,840
pay for it

622
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,679
and start learning you know go do that

623
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,480
too you'd also get it on amazon if you

624
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,000
don't want to

625
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,039
try to get the book out of the library

626
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,440
and you really want the book or

627
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:35,679
something say amazon it's a sale 51

628
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:38,400
off um so lena says body swelling and

629
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:40,160
chronic bloating so you know it comes

630
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,160
down to chronic bloating which is really

631
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,360
hard for so many people i talked about

632
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,720
bloating because

633
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,559
bloating can make it so you can't

634
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,080
breathe you feel like you can't breathe

635
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,280
good you can't feel like you can't take

636
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,440
a deep breath

637
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,640
you can't get air in it gets in the way

638
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,080
when you're walking

639
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,840
it gets in the way when you're just

640
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,600
driving when you're driving the car

641
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,679
i know people that when they're driving

642
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:02,480
driving their car and they're bloated it

643
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:04,159
just makes it so difficult and so hard

644
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,520
carrying things makes it so hard so i'm

645
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,520
so sorry you're going with you know the

646
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:10,400
chronic bloating and the swelling

647
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,600
um and you know and i've talked about

648
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,159
this for years and what i

649
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,679
i this is a question that i always get

650
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,880
asked by doctors

651
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:20,320
um that's another thing too so and

652
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,720
doctors would be like well i got this

653
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:25,919
patient you know and what do i do

654
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,520
and chronic bloating and and you know

655
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,440
and so i'm like okay first of all

656
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,960
we we got a liver issue and that's what

657
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,159
i would tell you know a doctor and they

658
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,440
would also send me looking they're

659
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,200
looking for liver enzymes they're

660
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,480
looking for liver problems

661
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,480
and that's one thing that's really

662
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,400
helpful um the other thing with

663
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,760
with that kind of bloating and that kind

664
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,679
of uh everything

665
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,000
is just know that your hydrochloric acid

666
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:48,480
is low and i've taught doctors that how

667
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,960
hydrochloric acid becomes really low

668
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,240
um and learn the true cause of bloating

669
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,840
so what i would do is

670
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,200
once again cleanse the heal learn the

671
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,320
true cause of bloating you can bring it

672
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,000
to your practitioner

673
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,159
but there's so so much you can do with

674
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,480
that there's so much you can do

675
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,360
um but bloating is one of those things

676
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,679
where if

677
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,120
i had bloating i'd get rid of milk

678
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:10,480
cheese butter

679
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,679
eggs gone i'd get rid of gluten gone

680
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,400
because those are gonna feed

681
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,919
any kind of bugs so with a lot of

682
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,919
different bloating cases you'll have

683
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:19,039
streptococcus in the intestinal tract

684
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,400
that's causing the bloating your

685
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,159
hydrochloric acid is low

686
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,240
so i get rid of those foods is what i

687
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,919
would do and then i would get the celery

688
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,440
juice going every single morning lemon

689
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,840
water going every single morning and i

690
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,720
would

691
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,559
start to rebuild my hydrochloric acid

692
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,200
because i start getting my liver bile

693
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:37,360
reserves back up getting my liver back

694
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,320
i mean that's already the start right

695
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,600
there which is so

696
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:43,360
important um karen says

697
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,720
inflammation i've tried your celery

698
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,720
juice it's helping

699
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,240
so okay karen so that's awesome because

700
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,280
inflammation is a mystery

701
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,480
to science research so so alternative

702
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,840
medicine doesn't know what causes

703
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,159
inflammation they think a

704
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,919
food causes inflammation so they're not

705
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,360
really advanced yet i know that's going

706
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:00,640
to get someone upset right now you're

707
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,559
like how's he saying that

708
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,480
well it's true it's true alternate

709
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:06,080
medicine they don't know what causes

710
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,120
inflammation it's mysterious to

711
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,720
alternative medicine

712
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,159
it's mysterious to conventional medicine

713
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,520
unless you've been injured that's

714
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,679
different

715
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,320
so with alternative medicine they'll say

716
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:18,559
well gluten causes

717
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:20,080
inflammation not true how come there's

718
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:22,799
all these people that could eat

719
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,600
all the gluten they want all the cheese

720
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,440
pizza

721
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,960
and they can eat dairy and they can eat

722
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,280
whatever they want and they can have

723
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,480
they can eat and you probably people you

724
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,440
guys probably know some friends that can

725
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,960
eat whatever they want they're not

726
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,760
talking about inflammation are you

727
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,919
kidding

728
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,799
and because what it is it's not the

729
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,039
gluten

730
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,000
that causes inflammation it's like

731
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,880
gluten and things like

732
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,720
that that help feed a buggy in us that

733
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,600
causes inflammation so it's

734
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,280
bugs inside of us pathogens that create

735
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,240
the inflammation

736
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,760
not our body and not the foods and

737
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,440
that's why i don't have a food diet

738
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,799
belief system because i think someone

739
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,159
can eat it whatever they want they got

740
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,760
nothing going wrong with them

741
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,280
i also you know and i also think they

742
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,280
need to be eating really clean

743
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,799

trying to show the book because i'm

764
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,120
trying to sell the book or something

765
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,960
like that well can i tell you something

766
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,720

768
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,159
have people come

769
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,520
i mean i'm worldwide known we know that

770
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,559
millions of books are out there around

771
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,240
the world

772
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,840
i can turn this into two thousand dollar

773
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,799
programs tomorrow and

774
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,559
forget selling a book i can sell massive

775
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:03,679
amounts of programs and have paid

776
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:05,120
people pay tons of money i don't i try

777
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,279
to make this a free resource

778
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,799
it's a medical textbook i killed myself

779
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,640
basically to write it with spirit of

780
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:14,400
compassion because

781
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:17,440
to put this together in just a year is

782
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,960
is unheard of and so when

783
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,640
when you get this book though i mean

784
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,559
just look go to the library get it for

785
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,360
free or amazon.com or something so i'm

786
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,360
not trying to

787
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,440
push a book on you but what i do want

788
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,320
you to have is the answers and with lyme

789
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,400
disease

790
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,240
so we've got chronic lyme disease you're

791
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,600
dealing with fatigue chronic headaches

792
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,400
and neck pain

793
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:38,000
and what happens is that science

794
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,600
research doesn't know what causes lyme

795
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,600
disease anymore so they moved it out of

796
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,640
the category of bacteria

797
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:46,320
and they moved it into autoimmune now

798
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,400
that's partly because of medical media

799
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,000
information all the books

800
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:53,360
that went out talking about the truth

801
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,600
about lyme pushed it out of the bacteria

802
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,279
category so now it's in the autoimmune

803
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,720
category right where

804
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,000
it belongs for science and research

805
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,120
because they don't know the cause of it

806
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,279
so learn the cause

807
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,600
it's viral so lyme disease is viral so

808
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:07,600
when you look at the symptoms fatigue

809
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,600
that's viral so you can actually find

810
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,960
that information in here you'll see

811
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,360
you'll see in the lyme section you'll

812
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,120
see protocols you'll see dosages of

813
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,400
protocols take it to your doctor

814
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,760
take it to your doctor and you can take

815
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,720
a look at it if i was diagnosed with

816
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,480
lyme disease

817
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,240
i'd be going through here in the

818
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,640
protocol supplements and dosages and

819
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,640
learn

820
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,159
how to do it you can read all about it

821
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,679
you know talk to your practitioner about

822
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,480
if you've got a practitioner you love

823
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,360
dr you love but um and that's the

824
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,360
biggest

825
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,360
that's the biggest question i get with

826
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,960
doctors doctors contacting me

827
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,159
like every single day i have to donate a

828
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,960
certain part of my day and talk to

829
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:41,120
doctors

830
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,080
um because they reach out and when the

831
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,120
biggest question is

832
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:47,440
lyme disease anthony you you basically

833
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,400
pushed lyme out of the bacteria category

834
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,520
because now

835
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,919
science research doesn't know what

836
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,200
causes lyme the lyme labs still don't

837
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,320
want to lose their business

838
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,600
they don't want to lose their business

839
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,880
so they're still testing for they're

840
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,240
still saying they're testing for

841
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,159
bacteria

842
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,400
what a scam that whole thing is and then

843
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,080
with with all that but it's really viral

844
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,760
and it's really sad how it works i want

845
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,720
you to have the answers you know it's

846
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,960
not about

847
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,400
i don't care who i get upset out there

848
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,320
you know in the industries

849
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,159
it's i just want you to have the answer

850
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,720
because when you're sick

851
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:18,799
and your body hurts and you get fatigue

852
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,840
and you have all these diagnoses and

853
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:23,279
you're still sick and still sick and you

854
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,039
probably are smart enough to know at

855
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:27,120
that point that

856
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:28,799
the health trends aren't what's fix it

857
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,000
going to fix it no apple cider vinegar

858
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,400
is going to fix that

859
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,480
i mean what a joke that is right i mean

860
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,000
what happens is when you're not so sick

861
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,000
and you can play around with all these

862
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,600
fun things on a circuit and spread

863
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,039
it around and everybody thinks it's an

864
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,919
answer to have apple cider vinegar as an

865
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,919
answer

866
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,039
it's amazing but the bottom line is i

867
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,559
know you've been through hell and back

868
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,120
if you're that sick and you dealt with

869
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:53,840
lyme

870
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:53,840
i want you to have the answers

871
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,720
so linda says i'm trying to figure out

872
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,440
what causes my husband's ulcerative

873
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,080
colitis

874
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,039
ulcerative colitis is brutal i here's an

875
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,360
example here

876
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,640
is that people don't really get it

877
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,279
unless they've gone through something

878
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,880
like that

879
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:16,559
it's like same thing with like the lyme

880
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,960
disease before they like

881
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:20,640
you don't know what it's like to be sick

882
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,520
unless you've been there you know i've

883
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:25,039
really been there

884
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:28,399
ulcerative colitis just awful and

885
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:30,080
um it's women get ulcerative clients men

886
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,200
get ulcerative colitis it's really a

887
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,279
tough one and

888
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,960
um and that's a question i also get

889
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,080
asked by doctors too is colitis and

890
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,000
different things like that and there's

891
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,640
different levels of colitis there's

892
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,600
there's mild bleeding with ulcerative

893
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,799
colitis there's

894
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,279
heavy and extreme bleeding with

895
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:48,320
ulcerative colitis there's cramping

896
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:49,200
brutal pain and there's also there's

897
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,799
also

898
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,480
forms of colitis that you don't

899
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,880
hemorrhage and you're not bleeding at

900
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,080
all

901
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,600
but you but you got colitis and when you

902
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,600
look and cleanse the heel

903
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,520
you'll see the shingles section so

904
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,760
that's where i would go in the shingle

905
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:06,640
section you'll find colitis

906
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,679
and what i've always recommended with

907
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,840
anybody

908
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,360
like any any doctors that have sent

909
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,360
their people to me

910
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:15,520
years ago when i used to help people out

911
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,760
and you know years and years ago

912
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,760
what what i would always do is is do the

913
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,600
mono eating cleanses when it comes down

914
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,559
to colitis it'd be the mono eating

915
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,960
cleanses

916
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:26,240
and that that i found was always the

917
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,720
best options

918
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,159
and and i get asked it all the time by

919
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,919
doctors now they're always like well

920
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:33,120
what do we do for colitis

921
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,480
what do we do with our patients for

922
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,640
clients and i'm like look the mono

923
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:39,200
eating cleanse is for colitis and

924
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,159
take a look at that and so it's just but

925
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,799
yeah it

926
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,000
the shingles virus is behind the whole

927
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:46,080
colitis thing it's

928
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
it's it's in the lining of the in the

929
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,679
intestinal tract so shingles sits in the

930
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,039
lining of the intestinal tract

931
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:55,039
you can talk to your doctor bring the

932
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:55,039
information i recommend that all the

933
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,840
time

934
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,039
so rebecca you got neurological stuff

935
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:06,399
going on so your question is involuntary

936
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:09,440
movements

937
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:11,120
yeah that's the jerking um the whole

938
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,720
jerking thing is really

939
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,399
really hard for people when they have

940
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,159
that so right sometimes it happens when

941
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:17,840
you're right before you even fall asleep

942
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,200
but it's like crazy where the jerks keep

943
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,880
on waking you up you're falling asleep

944
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,159
and then you're jerking waking you up

945
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,440
you're falling asleep and then you're

946
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,480
it's just unbelievable what happens and

947
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,240
you're probably having them during the

948
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,159
daytime too from what it looks like

949
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,360
voluntary movements vibrations

950
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,799
vibrations when you feel like your

951
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,720
body's humming and buzzing and your

952
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:34,559
body's like vibrating and you're

953
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,559
you're doing this hummingbuzzy vibrating

954
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,960
thing that's really difficult too those

955
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,799
are

956
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,000
mysterious neurological symptoms to

957
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:43,279
research in science they

958
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,520
don't know what that stuff is and back

959
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:46,559
like oh my god like and that's the

960
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,320
difference right there where you're

961
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:50,559

research and science having all the

965
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,159
answers you know

966
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:57,840
you know that you've probably been to

967
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,360
god knows how many doctors with that how

968
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,440
many neurologists is worth

969
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,480
like with that so just know my heart

970
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,720

understand not the person who's

973
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:09,840
a troll or not so sick or not sick and

974
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,000
they just

975
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:14,320
don't even understand just throw like

976
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,080
fish oil out and do probiotics it's all

977
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,720
in your gut like all the stupid stuff

978
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,960
non-stop

979
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,559
meanwhile it's candida or something

980
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,679
meanwhile you're suffering and there's

981
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:23,200
real issues so

982
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:25,200
come down the involuntary movements

983
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,760
vibrations hair loss tingling hands and

984
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,399
feet

985
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,279
neurologists said anxiety that right

986
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:31,600
there

987
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:33,679
is tough for me tough tough tough to

988
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:36,960
hear that to hear that because

989
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:40,640
i heard that for over 35 years

990
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:42,559
from patients right that you know where

991
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,840
the doctor will send somebody to try to

992
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:45,360
find me for help

993
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,320
that somebody you know that somebody

994
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,760
would tell me all the different

995
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,600
neurologists they've been to and how

996
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:52,559
certain neurologists would be like

997
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,600
it's anxiety it's all in your head

998
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,200
you're making it up

999
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,880
you know what the new thing is right now

1000
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,840
rebecca is that

1001
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,480
what you know young women are being told

1002
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,399
now

1003
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,080
is that they're creating it with their

1004
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:06,559
thoughts you know and they're not

1005
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,000
good enough they're creating it they're

1006
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:09,440
not thinking positive and that's why

1007
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,799
they have tingles and numbness and

1008
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,480
that's why they have all these symptoms

1009
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:14,480
of vibrations it's so sad what's

1010
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,480
happening that's the new crazy

1011
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,760
you just you tell young women that

1012
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,399
they're just creating it with their

1013
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,600
thoughts

1014
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:21,039
and they're they're with their they're

1015
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,640
not positive thoughts and they need to

1016
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,840
better themselves that's a new way of

1017
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,760
saying it's all in your head and you're

1018
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,880
crazy to a new generation it's just it's

1019
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:30,720
actually sick

1020
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:32,399
um and but yeah so just know that

1021
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,840
i feel for you so what i would do

1022
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:35,519
there's a neurological section here

1023
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,840
you'll see with body vibration

1024
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,880
with body vibrations you'll hear tingles

1025
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,120
hands and feet

1026
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,640
so what i would do is get the book out

1027
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:45,200
library for free if you want

1028
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,720
and take a look at the different the

1029
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,799
your symptoms and line them up to

1030
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,000
symptoms inside the back of the book and

1031
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:51,600
if you're new here and you're wondering

1032
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,880
what is he even talking about well in

1033
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,360
the back of the book

1034
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,480
you'll see look i just opened it to just

1035
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:01,120
whatever and it says

1036
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:02,640

1038
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,320
it up to hair thinning and loss and it

1039
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:09,120
tells you what's causing that

1040
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:10,640
and i just turn the page fibromyalgia

1041
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,640
and so forth and it keeps them going but

1042
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,279
there's neurological

1043
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,720
section in here so and you can learn

1044
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:18,640
what's causing it so you can get a

1045
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:23,120
chance to get better and all that

1046
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:23,120
and it's just not easy okay so

1047
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,039
so angela you're doing lemon water proud

1048
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,440
of you incredible

1049
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:33,840
celery juice per your instructions still

1050
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,399
seem to be having some congestion

1051
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:38,640
breathing issues asthmatic like symptoms

1052
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:41,120
and coughing mucous inflammation doctors

1053
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:44,399
can't find anything any suggestions

1054
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,679
angela um what are you what are you

1055
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:47,360
eating that's one thing

1056
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:49,600
think about that i ask everybody this so

1057
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,440
i'm asking everybody this right now okay

1058
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,799
you got some symptoms going on you're

1059
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,159
doing some good stuff though

1060
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,679
so you're doing the lemon water you're

1061
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,399
doing the celery juice that's a part of

1062
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:59,200
it there

1063
00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:00,640
are you eating any eggs um because

1064
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,039
that's not that's gonna

1065
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,080
are you doing one one or two eggs a

1066
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:07,360
month

1067
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,480
will keep those symptoms there is what

1068
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,919
they'll do because

1069
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,440
because with the doctor so no these are

1070
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:13,039
pathogens because they talk to doctors

1071
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,880
all the time and i teach doctors about

1072
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:15,679
this what your very question have been

1073
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,080
asked

1074
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,039
i have to talk to about five ten doctors

1075
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,360
every single day

1076
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:22,159
so every morning so i have a like that's

1077
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,320
what i do

1078
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:26,320
and it's to teach them so they can help

1079
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:28,159
heal more patients and more patients and

1080
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,519
and you know many of them don't set it

1081
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,960
back to the medical medium information

1082
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:32,880
it just spreads out and spreads out so

1083
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,600
then when i say metal somebody says oh

1084
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,120
he didn't

1085
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:37,200
he didn't start out the metal talk

1086
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:39,919
metals are around you know it's crazy

1087
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,720
so but the bottom line is um with what

1088
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:42,799
you're dealing with

1089
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,480
are you doing eggs are you doing butter

1090
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:46,320
are you doing dairy products

1091
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,320
is gluten in there once in a while these

1092
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,240
will all feed pathogens to keep these

1093
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,559
symptoms there

1094
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,240
and so keep that in mind there are you

1095
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:55,679
doing nutritional yeast are you doing

1096
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:59,039
natural flavors are you doing

1097
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:01,279
corn are you doing soy those will

1098
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:02,960
make or break when you're in this

1099
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:04,399
condition where you're dealing with all

1100
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:07,120
this stuff going on

1101
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:09,200
those will make our break so how clean

1102
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,240
is it are you plant based have you done

1103
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,359
the 369

1104
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:15,200
cleanse yet the 369 advanced cleanse

1105
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:17,200
so how far have you gone have you done

1106
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,639
the mono eating cleanse

1107
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,000
you talk to your doctor and say look i

1108
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,800
want to do mono-eating cleanse but your

1109
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,240
doctor doesn't know

1110
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,839
they can't find anything but you can

1111
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,800
still talk to them about doing any of

1112
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:26,879
this and

1113
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,599
mono-eating cleanse and then see where

1114
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:31,520
that goes after a while you know

1115
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:33,040
you don't have to be plant-based you can

1116
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,839
be doing animal products

1117
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:37,359
but but try not to do certain ones like

1118
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:40,480
eggs and dairy products

1119
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:41,440
but there is a way out there is a way

1120
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,000
out and

1121
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,599
so you've got to customize the protocol

1122
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,119
try to get some guidance if you can

1123
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:49,520
from a practitioner of course if you

1124
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:51,280
want or do it on your own but i

1125
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:55,919
completely understand

1126
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:55,919
what you're going through so

1127
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:03,760
guinea hernia please discuss protocols

1128
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:07,520
sand chad one one protocol

1129
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:09,839
don't overeat don't overeat small meals

1130
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:11,040
small meals every two hours i get asked

1131
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:14,079
this all the time

1132
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,720
all the time um doctors ask this all the

1133
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,320
time

1134
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,760
and i'm saying that a lot because

1135
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,000
basically

1136
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,280
people say well be transparent anthony

1137
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,200
what do you do in a day

1138
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,200
you want to know what my day is my day

1139
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,720
stinks

1140
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:29,440
so my day is waking up really early in

1141
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:31,920
the morning hearing spirit of compassion

1142
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,520
writing down information from for the

1143
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,800
next book so i can work on getting

1144
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,040
people better

1145
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,240
and then i gotta go okay who's lined up

1146
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,280
all the doctors that need to talk to me

1147
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,000
and ask questions because they're

1148
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,680
they're they're

1149
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,520
trying to contact me that's a part of

1150
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:45,359
the day it's exhausting

1151
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,640
and then and then the next part of the

1152
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:48,800
day is just

1153
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,920
all the other projects and things to do

1154
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,599
and it's it's just

1155
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,280
it's just and how to get disseminate

1156
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,599
free information out constantly it's

1157
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,160
just

1158
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:57,119
it's just endless but um first of all

1159
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,079
with the hernias

1160
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:00,640
don't overeat small meals that that's

1161
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:03,440
critical

1162
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,880
small meals and um and be cautious

1163
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,440
you're not eating foods

1164
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,240
that will bloat you up because you don't

1165
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,280
want that

1166
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:13,520
one like moment where you get

1167
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,960
extra bloated and you pop the cork and

1168
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,720
now you're getting surgery

1169
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,320
emergent emergency surgery or something

1170
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,000
like that you know and i always tell

1171
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,839
tell you that i got a friend who's got a

1172
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,680
hernia and it's like

1173
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:26,320
any guinea hernia and i'm just like look

1174
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:29,040
just of course don't lift anything heavy

1175
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,960
but if you're bloated or you're stuffed

1176
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,800
that's when it could go wrong you know

1177
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,160
when you're really stuffed so you just

1178
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,280
want to you know you want to eat light

1179
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,520
but consistently

1180
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,880
so it's not like all in one moment

1181
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:42,160
that's just one thing i can

1182
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,160
give you anyway that's helpful

1183
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:49,280
candida so alan so candida

1184
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:52,480
okay well candida was a bad idea

1185
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:55,680
and a bad theory back in the 80s and 90s

1186
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:57,680
and it led

1187
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,599
thousands and thousands of people astray

1188
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:02,480
into never never land of

1189
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:04,160
never getting better so if we're still

1190
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:08,560
playing around in candida land

1191
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:11,920
it's amazing how these dead theories

1192
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:14,000
are just they just recirculate and they

1193
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,280
they're still out there it's beyond me

1194
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,640
that they're still out there because

1195
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,760
candida is not the problem of why

1196
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,640
somebody's sick

1197
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,079
and so when when you still see that out

1198
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:25,359
there candida cleanses i'm like

1199
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:28,160
dear god dear god i mean it's the land

1200
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:29,119
of just stupidness out there it's it's

1201
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,280
amazing not you

1202
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:32,240
but the information and all the the you

1203
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,520
know going out there all the

1204
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,280
misinformation

1205
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,640
and so it's easy to get trapped in it

1206
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,640
it's easy to get trapped into the

1207
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,359
candida thought and candida what they

1208
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,800
did was

1209
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:43,200
no one got better with the candida

1210
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,400
thought so now they call it microbiome

1211
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,160
and they're going to call it sibo like

1212
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,599
they call sibo and then microbiome and

1213
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,839
it's like okay and then

1214
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,520
you know and that's but that's not why

1215
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:53,440
people are sick it's really sad

1216
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:55,040
and but what they will offer is they'll

1217
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,880
say stay off of gluten stay off of this

1218
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,680
they'll stay off of medical medium no

1219
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,440
foods

1220
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,200
that i've been teaching about for 35

1221
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,800
years they'll say stay off of this stay

1222
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,160
off of the stay off of this

1223
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,800
and then the person's getting a little

1224
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:08,400
better and then they think hey that's my

1225
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,839
candida is getting better my

1226
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,520
my microbiome is getting better and

1227
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:13,280
that's not how it works it's just that

1228
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,160
when you're staying off those no foods

1229
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,640
by default

1230
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:18,000
you're not feeding streptococcus that's

1231
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:20,640
creating your intestinal

1232
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,320
tract problem so they don't know it but

1233
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,880
you're starving your streptococcus so

1234
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,880
it's just

1235
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,079
it it's incredible how it works out

1236
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,760
there but um

1237
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:29,200
just really i mean if you're into

1238
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,040

00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:33,680

so melissa says hello why is my anemia

1249
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,560
such a huge problem these days so why is

1250
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,320
your anemia

1251
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,760
that you're dealing with huge problem

1252
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,000
well you know what what happens with

1253
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,200
anemia is iron feeds the epstein-barr

1254
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,720
virus so

1255
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,400
and this is something i've talked about

1256
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,000
forever i talked about this in books

1257
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,400
i've talked about this in other

1258
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,880
other places and i've lectured about it

1259
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:16,079
in many places and have lectured that

1260
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:19,520
that with anemia that's what happens is

1261
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:22,160
iron feeds pathogens if you have

1262
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:24,160
pathogens so once again it's like wait a

1263
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:26,079
minute here you know like what can i do

1264
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:28,079
i would start with the anti-bug cleanse

1265
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:31,839
i would talk to you can talk to your

1266
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:31,839
doctor about it get cleansed of heal

1267
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,440
okay melissa high blood sugar not

1268
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,599
genetic

1269
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,960
high blood sugar is not genetic that's

1270
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:42,240
an example of

1271
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,720
they don't know why someone has a

1272
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:46,880
problem so research in science will

1273
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,560
peg everything genetic it's body shaming

1274
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,320
it's like your genes are bad so

1275
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,680
you got crappy genes how about that

1276
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,400
that's what they that's what they want

1277
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,240
you to think

1278
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,760
i mean think about that isn't that sick

1279
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,440
it's like you

1280
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,960
this is what they do if you get sick

1281
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,079
they say your body's attacking itself

1282
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,640
you have autoimmune

1283
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:04,480
okay now i'm not saying people don't

1284
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:06,800
have symptoms and they're not suffering

1285
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:09,119
but autoimmune theory is actually

1286
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,960
a botched job total body shop it's not

1287
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:12,400
even real their theory about the body

1288
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,359
attacking itself because it doesn't so

1289
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,680
they'll just say

1290
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:16,480
your body's attacking itself body

1291
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,240
shaming

1292
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,079
they'll make you feel like crap that

1293
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:22,240
your body's bad and it's attacking

1294
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:23,280
itself they'll say it's genetic

1295
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,359
right they'll say your condition's

1296
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,720
genetic make body shaming again make you

1297
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:28,400
feel like

1298
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,480
a piece of crap because that's what they

1299
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,520
want you to feel like not the doctors

1300
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,280
but the industry

1301
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:35,280
and then they'll say you they'll also

1302
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,880
say um it's your hormones

1303
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,640
come on i mean you know what i mean like

1304
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,079
unbelievable it's your hormones

1305
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,920
that's what they'll say they'll pull

1306
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,240
that card because it's blaming the woman

1307
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,839
now

1308
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,520
she has bad hormones or she's just i

1309
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:47,119
mean they're they're great hormone

1310
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,079
doctors don't get me wrong incredible

1311
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:50,880
ones that actually

1312
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:51,280
naturally work with hormones to to to

1313
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,200
help

1314
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,640
actually band-aid everything but the

1315
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,760
point is the industry loves to think

1316
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,960
it's all hormones

1317
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,079
then the industry loves to think it's

1318
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,160
all in your head so they just want to

1319
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:01,920
body shame body shame body shame but not

1320
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:04,640
give you answers and diabetes

1321
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,440
is not um genetic it's not that's not

1322
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,200
genetic

1323
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,280
you know um blood sugar problems high

1324
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:11,119
a1c not genetic and all that

1325
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,720
but you got to get your liver in a

1326
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:14,560
better place

1327
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,160
you got to drop the fats in the diet

1328
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,200
down got to learn how to maybe eat a

1329
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,200
little differently

1330
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:22,319
and then you'll see all that stabilize

1331
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,319
you'll see it stabilized

1332
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:27,680
floaters just so you know i got a whole

1333
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,680

what to do all

1336
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,000
the different stuff what's the cause

1337
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,560
what i don't

1338
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,160
what i don't like out there okay there's

1339
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:40,240

all of it in the health scene okay and

1341
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,560
it's interesting

1342
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:45,440
but yet nobody knows what causes

1343
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:47,520
anything so why is

1344
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,960
why is someone really an expert when

1345
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,160
they don't know the true cause of why

1346
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,599
you're sick

1347
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,839
if they don't know the true cause of why

1348
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:56,000
you have floaters why are they an expert

1349
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:57,200
oh here's apple cider vinegar here's

1350
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,200
activated charcoal

1351
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,240
here's corella here's fish oil here's

1352
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,800

00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:04,880
here's whatever here's collagen i mean

1354
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,359
it's it's insane really here's bentonite

1355
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,079
clay

1356
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:09,359
all that stuff's bad but the bottom line

1357
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:11,520
is it's it's

1358
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:12,800
it's really amazing you know oh here's

1359
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:15,040
food combining but yet you don't know

1360
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,960
why somebody's sick

1361
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,960
not like you know ranking on everything

1362
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:20,960
totally i'm just saying that

1363
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,640
it everybody's a health expert is that

1364
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,680
what it is now when nobody knows why

1365
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,359
anybody's sick

1366
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:26,720
no one knows why you have tinnitus

1367
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:27,599
ringing in the air nobody knows why you

1368
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,880
have vertigo or

1369
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:30,240
clothes in the eyes the tickles and

1370
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,599
numbness and that's the difference

1371
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,119
between medical medium information

1372
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:35,599
whether anybody likes it or not it's

1373
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:38,560
just the truth

1374
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:40,560
it's tammy white i have heard you say at

1375
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:42,640
one time or in your books

1376
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:45,040
that some people who do celery juice

1377
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:47,119
might get diarrhea

1378
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:49,200
i get it so bad and this is all i can

1379
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:51,040
figure out that might be causing all the

1380
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:53,839
intestinal distress

1381
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:55,440
um options that will do similar to

1382
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:56,000
celery juice first of all so you never

1383
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,680
had

1384
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,440
tim you never had intestinal distress

1385
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,400
before and you never had diarrhea at all

1386
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:03,359
before

1387
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,160
um or is this like your intestinal tract

1388
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:06,560
and gut problems

1389
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:08,160
all perfect like your gut's great you

1390
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:10,720
had nothing wrong with your gut

1391
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:12,079
everything's stable with it no bloating

1392
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,359
no anything and then you did celery

1393
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:13,920
juice and then you have the diarrhea i'm

1394
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:15,440
just

1395
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:18,000
just asking questions so you can think

1396
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:20,640
about it and the other thing is

1397
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,319
do small amount do a really small amount

1398
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,839
so what i would recommend

1399
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:25,280
because what happens is if you're

1400
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:26,400
getting diarrhea first of all i'm really

1401
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,960
glad that you got the books and you're

1402
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,160
reading them

1403
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,000
when you're when you're getting the

1404
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:31,280
diarrhea from celery juice lower the

1405
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,680
amount of celery juice because that

1406
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,160
means

1407
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:36,160
that celery juice is killing something

1408
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:37,920
so it's it's killing something it's

1409
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,280
killing a die off so what happens is

1410
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,280
what everybody walks around with they

1411
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:43,040
walk around chances are if you're

1412
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,400
taking care of yourself and you're

1413
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:46,000
getting these books that means you do

1414
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,520
have something going on in your body

1415
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,880
that you're concerned about you're not

1416
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:51,440
just feeling perfect and then you

1417
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,800
decided to do medical medium information

1418
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,240
most everybody does medical mean

1419
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,599
information they get sick so they need

1420
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,960
to do mental health information so

1421
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:59,839
what's happening is

1422
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:01,440
is realize that is that you got

1423
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:02,160
something that the celery juice is

1424
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,280
actually

1425
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:08,720
destroying pathogens and when one

1426
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:11,680
little bug dies like one little bug

1427
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,720
dies we can have a reaction to that bug

1428
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:15,440
dying

1429
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:17,119
so when you kill off one little tiny bug

1430
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,480
kill off a little bit of streptococcus a

1431
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:20,319
little bit of staph

1432
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,599
a little bit of c-diff you kill a little

1433
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:23,520
bit of you know all this

1434
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:25,040
and then that's that's something right

1435
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:27,040
there you kill a little bit of

1436
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,720
um shingles a little bit of epstein bar

1437
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:31,119
but bacteria especially any of it when

1438
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:32,880
that celery juice is going through

1439
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:34,240
your intestinal tract it's it's a

1440
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,760
cleanser it

1441
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,040
people underestimate the amount of power

1442
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,480
it has it's different than a celery

1443
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,800
stick a celery stick

1444
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,160
that's not going to do anything but when

1445
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:44,079
you do the celery juice so what i would

1446
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:46,480
recommend is

1447
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:48,720
first of all are you don't do any eggs

1448
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:50,880
don't do any dairy don't do any gluten

1449
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,680
no corn no soy make sure that stuff's

1450
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,160
out

1451
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:55,359
and be cautious with all that stuff do

1452
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:57,599
small amounts

1453
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:58,640
of celery juice if you want to try that

1454
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:00,400
that's what i would recommend to

1455
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:02,240
somebody asking me this if this was me

1456
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:04,079
happening i'd be like okay four ounces

1457
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:06,400
so i'd be like well what's this is this

1458
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:09,920
four ounce six ounces what is this so

1459
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:12,000
i would do a small amount each day

1460
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:13,359
and see where that line is drawn because

1461
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,839
it's going to go in there it's going to

1462
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:15,760
start

1463
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:18,079
breaking down pathogens killing off

1464
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:21,680
bacteria and all that is what it's going

1465
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:21,680
to start to do so that's what i would do

1466
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:30,480
so um

1467
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,680
yeah anyway so but i'm proud of you for

1468
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,440
even drinking it

1469
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:35,520
start really little if you need to

1470
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:38,880
graduate go right to

1471
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:42,160
um you know i don't recommend

1472
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:43,280
ever having something mixed with your

1473
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:45,200
celery juice okay

1474
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,400
but if you really have to i mean i have

1475
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,359
mentioned if you really have to

1476
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,119
acclimate

1477
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:50,800
do some apple in there do a little bit

1478
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:52,319
of apple a little bit of celery juice

1479
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,480
and see if you still get the same thing

1480
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:56,079
and you just work your way up back to

1481
00:45:54,480 --> 00:46:01,119
where your straight celery again or just

1482
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:04,240
a little bit of celery

1483
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:06,000
so there's a couple questions um

1484
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:08,000
i'm looking at my monitors for questions

1485
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,000
you guys so erica

1486
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,040
i bought cleanse the heel and reading it

1487
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,920
now

1488
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:17,280
amazing incredible i can't really find

1489
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:20,560
any info on balancing hormones

1490
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:22,400
i'm i am going through early menopause

1491
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:25,119
and all the doctors keep telling me to

1492
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:28,000
do keto can you give me any advice

1493
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:29,839
so if you go into the protocols you'll

1494
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:33,280
see in the back of the book

1495
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:33,280
menopause symptoms

1496
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:43,839
and i'm just looking hormonal hormonal

1497
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:43,839
problems and i'm just looking for it now

1498
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:50,000
so they're both in this same section but

1499
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,560
i'm just trying to find it as we speak

1500
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,760
because

1501
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:55,520
i'm wondering if i wonder why that's not

1502
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,599
there for you

1503
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,960
so i have two things going on here so i

1504
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:01,280
want to show you one

1505
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,280
here

1506
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,599
so you'll see hormonal problems right

1507
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:07,599
there

1508
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:11,839
and then

1509
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:20,160
sorry about it's taking so long isn't

1510
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:20,160
then you'll see

1511
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:25,590
and then you'll see menopause symptoms

1512
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,280
right there

1513
00:47:25,590 --> 00:47:29,359
[Music]

1514
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,880
but um so we can do is you can talk to

1515
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:32,000
your practitioner doctor you can take

1516
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,720
this to them

1517
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,559
and you can look you can you can but if

1518
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,760
you read the whole chapter

1519
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:40,319
you can learn how to take the

1520
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:42,640
supplements as far as how to do it

1521
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:44,480
but learning the true cause is the key

1522
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:46,400
so when you see this

1523
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:47,760
you'll see menopause symptoms but you'll

1524
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,960
you'll read it you'll learn what the

1525
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:51,200
true cause because

1526
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:52,000
menopause is supposed to be like it used

1527
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:55,280
to be

1528
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,839
before the 1940s which was women

1529
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:59,119
just their period stopped and they felt

1530
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:01,280
better than ever

1531
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:02,880
that's what menopause used to be so that

1532
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:05,520
was the change back then

1533
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,319
it was called the change you just felt

1534
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:09,200
better

1535
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:11,040
so but then because of pathogens and

1536
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:13,760
viruses like epstein-barr

1537
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:14,400
stagnant livers causing hot flashes and

1538
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,720
all this

1539
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:18,079
we've gotten to the age of menopause

1540
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:20,480
symptoms

1541
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:21,920
and it's being blamed on menopause but

1542
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,119
menopause isn't why

1543
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:24,960
you have the symptoms you have to

1544
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:26,160
realize wait a minute what's going on

1545
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,680
here so you'll look at all the different

1546
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,640
supplement protocols you'll see what

1547
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,920
angle to take

1548
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,599
you can talk to your practitioner about

1549
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:33,200
it if you wanted to too that's what i

1550
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:35,760
would do if i was going through it

1551
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:37,680
um keto keto will make it worse so keto

1552
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:40,960
makes menopause symptoms worse

1553
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:42,880
because because the keto is high fat

1554
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:45,599
so what you'll find is the higher fat

1555
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:47,359
you go because that's part of how the

1556
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:49,040
the menopause symptoms are even here

1557
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:50,480
it's because your whole diet your diet

1558
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:52,400
throughout your life was probably just

1559
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:54,160
high in fat because everybody says it's

1560
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:57,920
just everybody says

1561
00:48:54,160 --> 00:49:01,119
whether it's milk cheese butter eggs

1562
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:03,520
meat chicken avocado nut butters

1563
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:05,119
oils olive oil whatever you know

1564
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,440
whatever it is coconut oil whatever it

1565
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:07,520
is

1566
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:09,599
peanut butter all of that is high fat

1567
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:12,480
and we we tuna fish

1568
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:14,400
tuna fish salmon whatever right we tend

1569
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:16,000
to be all high fat and that's what we do

1570
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,319
so keto is just

1571
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,920
yeah you're removing gluten but you

1572
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:22,400
should be removing that anyway

1573
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,960
so what i would do is is anybody dealing

1574
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,960
with like

1575
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,480
the hormonal issues menopause symptoms

1576
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:28,160
try something like

1577
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:30,000
try just the mono eating cleanse for a

1578
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:31,280
little bit or try maybe the anti-bug

1579
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,800
cleanse or

1580
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:36,160
do 369 original the original 369 cleanse

1581
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,119
if you want or advanced and you'll

1582
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,640
notice that

1583
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:39,839
as you're doing that and then you look

1584
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,280
at some of the supplementation and

1585
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:42,240
menopause symptoms and hormonal

1586
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,839
imbalances

1587
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:45,440
you'll notice once you bring some of the

1588
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:47,839
subs in the supplements in

1589
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,640
with doing the foods and not having to

1590
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:50,079
do keto

1591
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:51,920
you'll notice some of these menopause

1592
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:53,280
symptoms going away

1593
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:55,760
and you'll be like oh my god why are

1594
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:58,240
they going away because it

1595
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:59,200
menopause is different than the symptoms

1596
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:01,200
menopause is

1597
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,640
the change of life the period stops

1598
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,839
you're getting older that kind of thing

1599
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,800
it's normal you're really getting

1600
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:06,400
younger and

1601
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,720
your period stops and then what happens

1602
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:10,720
is you're not supposed to have symptoms

1603
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:12,240
if you have symptoms that's other things

1604
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:14,400
really being the problem

1605
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:16,000
and that's advanced information and

1606
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:18,319
teaching a lot of doctors that now a lot

1607
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,079
of hormone doctors that too

1608
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:22,720
reggie says anthony what's the problem

1609
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:26,000
with ionized water

1610
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:28,400
i've had a machine for years the problem

1611
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,040
is reggie that um there's a bunch of

1612
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,119
problems

1613
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:32,800
a bunch of them one is the filters on

1614
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:34,480
them are terrible so you're just getting

1615
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,920
sink water and so

1616
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,440
and you're getting you can get toxic

1617
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,880
heavy metals from your sink water you

1618
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,400
can get other things that it won't it's

1619
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:43,359
not a purifier

1620
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:45,280
so the alkaline ionizer water machines

1621
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:46,720
aren't pure fire so i recommend a

1622
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,720
purifier so you're not

1623
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:50,400
drinking water that has stuff in it that

1624
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:52,559
shouldn't be in there so that's one

1625
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:54,079
and i know the ionizer sales people the

1626
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:55,440
pyramid scheme and all that that's

1627
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:57,599
happening they'll just tell you that

1628
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:00,000
yeah it's clean water it's clean water

1629
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:01,920
it's just not true um and you can even

1630
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,760
look into it it's not true but

1631
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,960
the thing is the other problem is it's

1632
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,720
ionized so

1633
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,480
what happens is their metal plates are

1634
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:10,240
in the machine and those metal plates

1635
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:12,880
they get corroded over the years

1636
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:15,040
so if i took apart your ionizer i would

1637
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:17,040
find these two corroded plates and where

1638
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:20,240
did all those metal particles

1639
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:21,920
go and off those titanium plates and you

1640
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:23,680
know platinum titanium whatever you

1641
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:25,680
where did all the metal go they turn

1642
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,960
they turn black they get all pitted and

1643
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:30,319
decayed

1644
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:31,119
and and um and so that has to go

1645
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:34,400
somewhere

1646
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:35,520
and it it goes in us so what i would do

1647
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,599
is i would

1648
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:39,440
i would you know consider like you know

1649
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:41,040
the heavy metal detox cleanse may be

1650
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,400
bringing into your life pulling out some

1651
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:44,559
metals that might have been in there

1652
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:45,839
the other thing is charge so you got the

1653
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:47,119
metal plates in the machine

1654
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:48,880
and then there's electricity going to

1655
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:50,800
the metal plates and it's

1656
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:51,920
it's it's charging it's changing those

1657
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:54,240
structure of the water

1658
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,920
through experimentation it's like and so

1659
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:58,000
that ionization

1660
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:59,280
is means it changes the water it kills

1661
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,240
the water so

1662
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:02,800
you know and i get it i mean we get sold

1663
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,960
these

1664
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,640
and but we never get taught taught

1665
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:08,000
what's happening or how it works or

1666
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:11,359
what's going on

1667
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:13,200
so and there's actual research on this

1668
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:15,680
there's actual this isn't just me

1669
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:17,119
i mean there's actual research and now

1670
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:19,599
science

1671
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:20,400
looking into this and figuring it out

1672
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:23,359
and there's

1673
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,839
researchers out there there's a there's

1674
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:25,280
a lot of

1675
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:26,880
water researchers out there that

1676
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,640
actually check the wall they test the

1677
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,839
water what happens when you ionize it

1678
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:31,920
how the water dies

1679
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:33,760
versus water that wasn't and then it's

1680
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:34,960
also like i said you got those plates

1681
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:36,400
and those metal plates

1682
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:38,160
are conduct you know electricity going

1683
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,960
to the metal plates look i know it gets

1684
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,640
people upset

1685
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:42,960
i hope you're not upset i'm just looking

1686
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:44,640
out for people i you know i would get a

1687
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:46,319
water purifier

1688
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,839
any other water options are better than

1689
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:50,400
that i'm just you know

1690
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:52,079

1700
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:12,079

detox with uh hyperthyroidism

1717
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:49,599
uh have headaches every day please uh i

1718
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:52,079
would if i had hyperthyroidism because

1719
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:54,480
once you learn what hyperthyroidism is

1720
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:56,000
and you look in the book and you see

1721
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:58,160
what hyperthyroid is it

1722
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,839
is then yeah it's it's it's helpful of

1723
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,880
course it is it's so gentle it doesn't

1724
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:04,880
do anything

1725
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:04,880
wrong it just only does the right things

1726
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:10,240
shelley says thank you so much for

1727
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:13,440
helping us and taking all the negativity

1728
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:14,720
for us yeah you know what's funny my god

1729
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:17,040
i do and it's

1730
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:18,240
it's hilarious because you know i got a

1731
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:21,520
thick skin

1732
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:22,640
so and it's kind of hilarious because

1733
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:24,000
you know when you're discriminated

1734
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:26,079
against your whole life for hearing

1735
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,760
a voice think about that okay if you

1736
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:30,800
really think about that

1737
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:32,000
okay at age four spirit of compassion

1738
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,079
started speaking to me

1739
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,000
okay from the outside of the ear

1740
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:36,559
perfectly clear so it's not inside my

1741
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,200
head

1742
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:41,680
and when i was six seven years old i was

1743
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:44,400
sitting there reciting information

1744
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:45,359
okay reciting information to my family

1745
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:47,119
to my parents

1746
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:48,880
that was advanced medical information

1747
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:50,400
about viruses and how they mutate about

1748
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:51,440
toxic heavy metals how they oxidize in

1749
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,440
her brain

1750
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:54,720
this is when i'm 60 years old because

1751
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:56,400
it's coming from up here

1752
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:59,280
my life has never been easy because of

1753
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:01,119
it and what happens is i found out that

1754
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:02,480
when you get more and more people better

1755
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:03,920
and they recover and heal

1756
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:06,000
there's an opposition that builds

1757
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:07,839
against you and they make up lies

1758
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,680
and they'll say i tried zarya juice it

1759
00:55:07,839 --> 00:55:11,359
doesn't work or whatever or they'll say

1760
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:13,280
anthony's a bad person and they'll make

1761
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:15,200
up a story but what happens is you you

1762
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:16,559
learn quickly that you're not allowed to

1763
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,839
get millions of people better because

1764
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:18,319
that's what medical media books have

1765
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:20,720
done

1766
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:22,160
you learn that you get a lot of jealous

1767
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:23,200
people in the health field and held

1768
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:25,440
scene that don't

1769
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:27,040
understand the gift or they're jealous

1770
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:28,880
because

1771
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:31,200
why is he allowed to get all this

1772
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:32,160
advanced medical information so the crap

1773
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:34,480
i get

1774
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:35,920
for breaking all the rules and letting

1775
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:37,359
you guys know the true causes of

1776
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:40,799
conditions and

1777
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:42,799
and you know going against you know

1778
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:43,920
popular trends that are only popular

1779
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:45,040
because there's millions of dollars

1780
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:47,520
behind them

1781
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:49,040

then you learn well what are the true

1860
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:36,480
causes

1861
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:37,040
um with with eye problems i tend to love

1862
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,960
to do

1863
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:40,720
food stuff too of course the different

1864
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:41,920
food stuff you might want to pick out a

1865
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:43,200
cleanse that maybe your doctor

1866
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:45,920
recommends out of here or

1867
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:47,599
likes or feels is is adequate for you

1868
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:51,200
you can go into the food sections

1869
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:51,760
i would avoid eggs dairy milk cheese

1870
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,760
butter

1871
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:55,040
which is dairy i would avoid that on a

1872
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:56,319
diet keep the gluten out of the diet

1873
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:56,960
that's the first step i would do

1874
00:58:56,319 --> 00:58:58,400
personally

1875
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:00,960
whether your animal protein or your

1876
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:02,720
plant-based just obviously plant-based

1877
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:04,000
you're not going to be doing

1878
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:05,200
those foods but gluten you would be

1879
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,319
doing so i would avoid that if you're

1880
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:08,640
plant-based but

1881
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:10,720
and um i would clean some of that up

1882
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:12,559
just to start with and over time you

1883
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:13,040
might see just with that alone because

1884
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:14,880
it's not

1885
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:16,960
feeding the very true cause which i have

1886
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:18,640
listed in here is a virus

1887
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:20,160
once that virus isn't getting the food

1888
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:22,079
it likes the

1889
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:23,760
the eye pressure tends to come down so

1890
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:25,760
i've watched this for years where

1891
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:27,440
then the eye pressure tends to come down

1892
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:28,720
in the eyes and the reason why is

1893
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:30,799
because the virus isn't

1894
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:33,839
taking advantage of all of the foods and

1895
00:59:30,799 --> 00:59:33,839
other stuff

1896
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:38,960
okay admiral hi anthony how long does it

1897
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:41,599
take to get

1898
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:42,720
the body's trust back the body's

1899
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:44,640
trespass is a really good

1900
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:46,079
question i have a history of eating

1901
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:50,319
disorder sometimes

1902
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:52,640
i'm afraid i'm not gonna get it back um

1903
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:54,720
your your body loves you unconditionally

1904
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:56,319
okay your body loves you unconditionally

1905
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:58,400
you always need to remember this

1906
00:59:56,319 --> 00:59:59,520
you're a good person too you didn't do

1907
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:01,200
anything wrong

1908
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:02,640
none of this is your fault really

1909
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:05,119
important to know okay

1910
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:06,240
so keep that in mind have compassion for

1911
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:08,720
yourself all right and

1912
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:10,559
and be light-hearted like it is not your

1913
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:13,119
fault there's reasons why

1914
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:14,960
we get we get eating disorders there's

1915
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:16,400
re real reasons why

1916
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,160
and i talk about that in the medical

1917
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:21,520
medium books right here and

1918
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:22,960
and you know and so there's

1919
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:24,559
sometimes we get really sensitive

1920
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:26,319
hypersensitive nervous systems and our

1921
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:27,440
vagus nerve gets sensitive and we get

1922
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:29,119
anxiety

1923
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:31,119
because we're either low grade viral or

1924
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:33,280
we got some toxic heavy metals and then

1925
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:34,640
it triggers off an eating disorder or

1926
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:36,160
you know we've been through hell

1927
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:38,160
you know and back we had a really

1928
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:40,160
difficult experience

1929
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:41,760
an emotional experience or a really big

1930
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:44,240
upset in our life or a loss

1931
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:45,440
and that can trigger it off and when i

1932
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:47,520
talk about how

1933
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:49,280
you know your your your body loves you

1934
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:50,480
