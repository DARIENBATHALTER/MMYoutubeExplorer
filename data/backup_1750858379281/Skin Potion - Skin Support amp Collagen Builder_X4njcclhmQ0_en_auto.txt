[81.08 - 86.08] power right here in my hand so I just
[83.92 - 90.20] want to show you it's one thing right
[86.08 - 92.80] there what you also see is the vimergy
[90.20 - 94.40] mm right there okay and this is going to
[92.80 - 97.24] be very interesting cuz I'm going to
[94.40 - 99.76] show you guys what I'm going to make and
[97.24 - 101.24] why it's important because right there
[99.76 - 105.72] you're talking about the collagen
[101.24 - 107.68] Builder the micro immune power with the
[105.72 - 111.32] organic bamboo
[107.68 - 113.32] silica you can't fix the skin from the
[111.32 - 114.36] outside by the way you guys know I work
[113.32 - 118.20] with
[114.36 - 121.16] vimergy you can't fix the skin from the
[118.20 - 124.36] outside we can try all all we want we
[121.16 - 127.52] can try our hardest we can do everything
[124.36 - 130.60] we can slather all kinds of stuff on our
[127.52 - 132.68] bodies we can be slathering all kinds of
[130.60 - 135.80] essential oils we can get ourselves
[132.68 - 138.72] soaking wet with oil and everything and
[135.80 - 141.76] hop in bed at night we can do a seaweed
[138.72 - 143.88] wrap with oil all over us hop in bed at
[141.76 - 145.80] night wake up in the morning and do it
[143.88 - 148.12] again the next day we can put whatever
[145.80 - 150.00] we want on the surface of our skin it's
[148.12 - 152.84] not going to be enough it's not going to
[150.00 - 155.24] fix the elasticity problem that people
[152.84 - 157.28] get this is important the reason why I'm
[155.24 - 159.48] even doing this right now is because oh
[157.28 - 162.24] my God if I hear it one more time my
[159.48 - 164.68] skin my skin medical medium my skin what
[162.24 - 166.24] do I do hey medical medium I just found
[164.68 - 168.24] your book and I have skin problems
[166.24 - 171.00] what's the best route to go like it's a
[168.24 - 173.08] skin skin skin and what about stretch
[171.00 - 175.48] marks why do we get stretch marks and
[173.08 - 177.56] why do they stay there people gain
[175.48 - 180.28] weight they lose the weight and the
[177.56 - 183.76] stretch marks are there how how do we
[180.28 - 186.60] best help those stretch marks heal and
[183.76 - 189.84] do their thing all this matters you have
[186.60 - 192.96] to build the skin from the inside out
[189.84 - 195.96] it's critical mm info for
[192.96 - 198.96] years Delia says yeah my sister really
[195.96 - 201.08] messed her skin on her face up by doing
[198.96 - 202.84] micro needling she has a lot of
[201.08 - 204.80] discoloration from it too so I want to
[202.84 - 207.68] talk about that with the if you've done
[204.80 - 210.04] the micro needling and hey you might not
[207.68 - 211.96] be off the hook right there I want to
[210.04 - 214.28] talk about this isn't about tattoos
[211.96 - 216.88] being bad or good but I want to talk
[214.28 - 219.68] about instead of what I've always talked
[216.88 - 222.76] about right about ink I want to talk
[219.68 - 224.52] about the surface of the skin I want to
[222.76 - 226.20] talk about that with the inks if you're
[224.52 - 227.60] some of dealing with tattoos and you've
[226.20 - 229.24] done all this kind of ink and you've
[227.60 - 230.96] done whatever maybe you just got a
[229.24 - 232.80] little bit of ink behind your ear maybe
[230.96 - 234.60] you have it on the back of your neck
[232.80 - 236.08] maybe you shaved your head one day and
[234.60 - 238.08] you have it on your head maybe you got
[236.08 - 240.28] it on your leg maybe you got it on your
[238.08 - 243.52] lower back wherever the ink
[240.28 - 245.84] is the skin gets affected so I want to
[243.52 - 250.36] kind of give you guys a oneone on what
[245.84 - 253.36] happens when we have Micro injuries on
[250.36 - 256.52] our skin and how that plays a role on
[253.36 - 258.88] all of our skin did you hear that so
[256.52 - 261.40] when you're micro needling your face
[258.88 - 263.64] right which don't do and you can do
[261.40 - 266.60] whatever you want I'm just saying I tell
[263.64 - 270.08] my family and friends don't do with the
[266.60 - 273.08] micro needling but what happens is your
[270.08 - 275.44] skin is the whole organ that's the big
[273.08 - 280.04] old organ right that's your
[275.44 - 285.00] organ and if you let's take an example
[280.04 - 287.88] here if you hurt a part of your
[285.00 - 289.40] stomach a little part of it the entire
[287.88 - 291.72] stomach gets
[289.40 - 293.52] affected if you hurt a little part of
[291.72 - 296.64] your liver the entire liver gets
[293.52 - 297.48] affected if you hurt a little part of
[296.64 - 302.04] your
[297.48 - 307.32] skin the entire organ gets affected by
[302.04 - 309.96] it it compromises the entire organ your
[307.32 - 312.20] skin and so it's critical to be doing
[309.96 - 314.68] the right stuff it's critical to build
[312.20 - 317.28] up that collagen From the Inside Out
[314.68 - 318.96] heal up the skin from the
[317.28 - 322.36] inside
[318.96 - 324.16] out not from the outside in I know so
[322.36 - 326.08] many of us is always like outside in
[324.16 - 329.56] outside in outside
[326.08 - 330.76] in really it's inside out that's the key
[329.56 - 332.20] so I want to talk about we're going to
[330.76 - 335.24] make we're going to make a Skin Potion
[332.20 - 340.00] right here I'm excited about that this
[335.24 - 343.08] is the vimergy micros immune power with
[340.00 - 347.92] the organic bamboo
[343.08 - 351.40] silica this is the vimergy MSM with the
[347.92 - 354.04] bamboo silica we're going to be joining
[351.40 - 358.48] these two we're going to be putting
[354.04 - 361.40] these two together and vimergy is going
[358.48 - 365.80] to give any anyone who's actually
[361.40 - 369.16] getting this a free lemon balm and 5%
[365.80 - 371.88] off of the MSM on top of it so the free
[369.16 - 374.20] lemon bomb which is nerves and nervous
[371.88 - 375.88] system which believe it or not when
[374.20 - 379.00] you're dealing with nerves and your
[375.88 - 381.68] calming nerves it's helpful for what
[379.00 - 383.80] it's helpful for your skin I'll talk
[381.68 - 386.12] about that in a little bit too so this
[383.80 - 388.04] is really exciting Wendy says my skin is
[386.12 - 390.32] now better than ever following medical
[388.04 - 392.72] mean and protocols look
[390.32 - 394.72] medical meum protocols have always been
[392.72 - 397.24] incredible for the skin but a lot of
[394.72 - 399.88] people they have skin injuries and don't
[397.24 - 402.64] realize this they just have all these
[399.88 - 406.48] kind of micro injuries on their SK
[402.64 - 409.96] mosquito bites create micro injuries on
[406.48 - 412.88] the skin course acne creates micro
[409.96 - 416.16] injuries on the skin micro needling
[412.88 - 418.80] creates mic micro injuries on the
[416.16 - 421.64] skin small tattoos all around the body
[418.80 - 426.36] or large tattoos create all kinds of
[421.64 - 427.20] injuries to the Skin So and the skin
[426.36 - 430.24] gets
[427.20 - 432.44] affected on the
[430.24 - 435.64] hole on the
[432.44 - 438.80] hole well don't worry I just only did it
[435.64 - 442.52] here or don't worry I've only micro
[438.80 - 445.52] needled here but the skin gets affected
[442.52 - 448.32] everywhere because it is the organ it
[445.52 - 450.04] feels it everywhere it knows it
[448.32 - 451.68] everywhere
[450.04 - 454.32] and so that's
[451.68 - 456.20] important so I want to just cover all
[454.32 - 458.96] that plus a bunch of others you guys
[456.20 - 463.28] just got here right we're talking about
[458.96 - 463.28] the skin we're talking about a Skin
[463.56 - 470.20] Potion the micro C and we're talking
[467.00 - 473.36] about the MSM combined so I'm going to
[470.20 - 476.88] show you the potion combined right we're
[473.36 - 480.20] talking about the organic bamboo silica
[476.88 - 483.36] we're talking about the MSM no caking
[480.20 - 483.36] agents no
[483.56 - 488.72] impurities I mean that alone is insane
[486.48 - 490.44] no one realizes all the powders they get
[488.72 - 492.84] all the different supplement powders out
[490.44 - 494.64] there everything from protein Powers
[492.84 - 498.96] every kind of powder it's
[494.64 - 503.12] loaded with impurities load
[498.96 - 506.96] it load it with impurities and anti-king
[503.12 - 509.68] agents load it with that and they're
[506.96 - 511.80] allowed to do it and vimer will not do
[509.68 - 513.64] that will not do that how are you going
[511.80 - 516.04] to help your skin when all these
[513.64 - 517.84] impurities are thrown into all of the
[516.04 - 520.28] supplements out there and the powders or
[517.84 - 523.52] anything how are we going to
[520.28 - 525.12] actually help the skin when all this
[523.52 - 527.64] garbage is put into all these
[525.12 - 529.12] supplements out there someone please
[527.64 - 532.68] tell me cuz I'm scratching my head on
[529.12 - 535.60] that it has to be good stuff and the
[532.68 - 537.44] skin has to be healing has to be
[535.60 - 539.88] strengthening and enhancing on the
[537.44 - 544.04] inside out
[539.88 - 547.32] important to know you cannot eat a
[544.04 - 551.16] sheep's eyeball to fix your eyeball you
[547.32 - 555.76] cannot eat a Bine heart to fix your
[551.16 - 559.36] heart you cannot eat a kidney to fix

[572.20 - 578.28] news but you cannot fix your liver by
[575.04 - 582.04] eating liver it's
[578.28 - 584.04] Insanity absolute lunacy that's
[582.04 - 585.80] lunacy so if you think you're eating
[584.04 - 588.04] liver out there or you get some kind of
[585.80 - 589.56] liver supplement or whatever it is or a
[588.04 - 590.88] heart supplement and you're eating it
[589.56 - 592.44] thinking it's going to help you in
[590.88 - 594.44] somehow or some
[592.44 - 597.48] way it's
[594.44 - 600.00] lunacy I hate to break the news to you
[597.48 - 602.76] this isn't about judg guy one or
[600.00 - 605.16] anything it doesn't work you can't eat
[602.76 - 606.76] someone's brain and fix your brain even
[605.16 - 609.56] if it's a human brain even if you're
[606.76 - 612.32] actually eating a human
[609.56 - 615.32] brain like they make it legal in this
[612.32 - 618.60] sick world and you're actually able to
[615.32 - 620.40] eat a human brain it's not going to fix
[618.60 - 623.28] your brain it doesn't work like this
[620.40 - 626.88] we've been sold this for a very long
[623.28 - 629.40] time and in the supplement World they
[626.88 - 631.32] still sell it they still push it there's
[629.40 - 633.76] something about it oh I'm going to get
[631.32 - 635.80] this liver I'm going to eat this liver
[633.76 - 637.60] right here that's that's dried and
[635.80 - 639.12] dehydrated I'm going to put this in my
[637.60 - 641.28] smoothie I'm going to eat this liver and
[639.12 - 643.12] put this in something because it's going
[641.28 - 644.96] to fix me right that liver I'm going to
[643.12 - 647.80] eat is going to fix me oh this must be
[644.96 - 651.32] good for me it's not it's not good for
[647.80 - 654.28] you in fact it's worse for your skin
[651.32 - 657.44] it's worse for your
[654.28 - 660.96] skin you can't eat muscle
[657.44 - 663.96] tissue to give give you muscle tissue it
[660.96 - 666.84] doesn't work and you can't eat an
[663.96 - 670.00] intestinal tract to fix your intestinal
[666.84 - 672.88] tract you just can't it won't work and
[670.00 - 675.28] it doesn't work these are critical piece
[672.88 - 678.04] pieces of information landmarks that's
[675.28 - 681.64] what they are they are landmarks to
[678.04 - 686.80] understand and you can't eat
[681.64 - 689.92] skin you can't eat skin to fix your
[686.80 - 692.32] skin it's not going to happen you don't
[689.92 - 695.00] think that's the serious thing out there
[692.32 - 697.00] it's serious because it's in the mindset
[695.00 - 698.96] of the supplement World about eating
[697.00 - 701.16] liver and fixing your liver about eating
[698.96 - 703.56] something and fixing it that's what
[701.16 - 705.20] we're taught out there and it's Insanity
[703.56 - 707.60] it's actually
[705.20 - 709.16] Insanity for some reason people in
[707.60 - 710.92] health whoever actually supports it
[709.16 - 712.72] which there's tons of people out there
[710.92 - 716.48] they've lost their minds because you
[712.72 - 720.96] cannot eat skin to fix your skin you
[716.48 - 720.96] can't eat collagen to fix your
[721.12 - 726.68] collagen millions and millions and
[723.92 - 729.24] millions of bottles and jars and
[726.68 - 734.32] packages of collagen have been sold to
[729.24 - 736.72] the suckers for years that's right
[734.32 - 739.84] millions billions of dollars have been
[736.72 - 739.84] made off of
[739.92 - 744.00] collagen and everybody or almost anybody
[743.04 - 746.88] and
[744.00 - 748.08] everybody has purchased that thinking
[746.88 - 749.48] they're going to actually build their
[748.08 - 751.48] collagen how how many years have you
[749.48 - 753.68] seen it how many people do you know were
[751.48 - 756.72] putting collagen inside their smoothies
[753.68 - 759.72] and collagen inside mixes tell me have
[756.72 - 762.16] you done it how many people do you know
[759.72 - 764.16] how many ads have you seen how much
[762.16 - 767.12] information is out there about collagen
[764.16 - 769.32] and taking collagen to help your
[767.12 - 772.40] collagen you've seen
[769.32 - 776.44] that it doesn't work you can't take
[772.40 - 779.80] collagen and fix your collagen you can't
[776.44 - 781.52] take a beef liver and fix your liver you
[779.80 - 783.52] can't eat somebody's pancreas to fix
[781.52 - 785.64] your pancreas you can't do it and you
[783.52 - 788.08] can't eat somebody's nose to fix your
[785.64 - 790.36] nose and you can't eat their damn ear to
[788.08 - 792.04] fix your ear it doesn't happen it
[790.36 - 794.48] doesn't work and the reason why I'm
[792.04 - 796.84] saying this is because collagens don't
[794.48 - 799.76] work out
[796.84 - 804.40] there and so if you're looking at skin
[799.76 - 806.72] cuz I'm I'm driven mad about skin stuff
[804.40 - 809.60] I hear it all the time like my skin my
[806.72 - 812.20] skin what about this on here what about
[809.60 - 814.24] I put this on here what about I put that
[812.20 - 815.80] on there and what if I do this how about
[814.24 - 817.52] if I take all this
[815.80 - 819.28] collagen if you're somebody that's
[817.52 - 821.20] worried about skin you have to build and
[819.28 - 823.28] repair from the inside out and it has to
[821.20 - 825.56] be stuff that's potent and Powerful the
[823.28 - 828.04] building blocks have to be there that's
[825.56 - 829.44] really important the building blocks
[828.04 - 832.92] have to be
[829.44 - 833.96] there now I'm not a skin model and I'm
[832.92 - 837.48] not
[833.96 - 840.52] a person that's like my skin my skin let
[837.48 - 843.48] me do selfies let me go you know and do
[840.52 - 847.20] selfies and post selfies of my beautiful
[843.48 - 849.96] skin but for my age my skin is doing
[847.20 - 851.52] pretty good pretty darn good and people

[880.16 - 887.44] lifts none of that I don't do any of
[883.40 - 890.64] that critical to know but what I can
[887.44 - 892.44] tell you is there's things you can avoid
[890.64 - 895.28] and things you can do to help keep your
[892.44 - 897.40] skin good and strong and today I'm
[895.28 - 901.40] talking about a Skin Potion I'm going to
[897.40 - 904.48] make I'm also sh you the micro immune
[901.40 - 907.40] power and collagen
[904.48 - 912.27] supporter right there with the organic
[907.40 - 914.12] bamboo silica you mix that with the
[912.27 - 916.80] [Music]
[914.12 - 919.56] MSM and
[916.80 - 921.96] boom you know and look I don't do a lot
[919.56 - 924.28] of things that destroy skin I don't do
[921.96 - 927.64] the vinegar that destroy skin I don't do
[924.28 - 930.08] the caffeine that destroys skin I don't
[927.64 - 932.76] do stuff like that that but even
[930.08 - 935.40] regardless of all those things there are
[932.76 - 937.68] things we can do to actually pick up the
[935.40 - 938.88] speed on Damage Done throughout the year
[937.68 - 940.60] so the reason why I was bringing up
[938.88 - 943.32] micro micro
[940.60 - 949.72] needling because it got really popular
[943.32 - 949.72] and I was like oh my God what are people
[950.52 - 956.96] doing that's that should be called micro
[954.16 - 959.96] scarring not micro needling that should
[956.96 - 961.92] have been called micro scaring
[959.96 - 964.00] ing all
[961.92 - 966.08] right I want to talk about the skin a
[964.00 - 967.88] little bit more what you see in front of

[998.28 - 1004.88] it is it's so darn clean and so amazing
[1002.64 - 1007.52] there's a direct link and it puts the
[1004.88 - 1010.00] products in the cart for you with the
[1007.52 - 1011.36] discount link is in the profile and in
[1010.00 - 1012.72] the description I want to make that
[1011.36 - 1014.32] clear let me make the potion really
[1012.72 - 1015.60] quick we're going to cover though a
[1014.32 - 1018.52] little bit about
[1015.60 - 1020.64] ink not the normal Ink Show though we're
[1018.52 - 1022.52] talking about the actual skin that gets
[1020.64 - 1025.16] scarred when we get ink because of the
[1022.52 - 1025.16] needle going
[1028.04 - 1031.44] in you want the
[1032.12 - 1036.04] butterfly you want Casper the
[1036.68 - 1042.24] ghost what do you want do you want a
[1039.48 - 1044.92] viking right the whole thing you want a
[1042.24 - 1047.28] viking with skulls around it do you want
[1044.92 - 1049.44] a rainbow what do you like as a tattoo
[1047.28 - 1051.84] do you want some scrip on there do you
[1049.44 - 1053.72] want something cool written what kills
[1051.84 - 1055.56] you does what kills you makes you
[1053.72 - 1057.60] stronger what what is it that you want
[1055.56 - 1061.04] on there I'm not judging anybody I'm
[1057.60 - 1064.84] just saying that as an organ as a whole
[1061.04 - 1067.92] the whole organ senses anything that
[1064.84 - 1070.20] happens to it you know if something if
[1067.92 - 1072.88] you get pinched here you get a mosquito
[1070.20 - 1077.28] bite here your entire
[1072.88 - 1081.92] organ is in the no it's actually in the
[1077.28 - 1085.04] know of it you do some micro needling or
[1081.92 - 1086.32] you try some other exfoliation it's
[1085.04 - 1090.44] another thing
[1086.32 - 1093.76] too for years I've watched people get
[1090.44 - 1093.76] exfoliated to
[1094.40 - 1097.60] death the
[1097.64 - 1102.92] exfoliations you got to be cautious on
[1100.16 - 1106.04] how deep those go how rough those
[1102.92 - 1108.00] are and you got to be careful or you got
[1106.04 - 1110.80] to be doing stuff from the inside out to
[1108.00 - 1113.96] help repair and take care
[1110.80 - 1113.96] of all
[1114.04 - 1120.00] right I got a little skin tissue model
[1117.92 - 1123.56] right
[1120.00 - 1127.52] here when it comes down to skin repair
[1123.56 - 1131.96] it has to start from deep down into the
[1127.52 - 1136.12] Derma it has to be down deep in the
[1131.96 - 1139.08] Derma here we got to go low you want to
[1136.12 - 1140.92] work on skin and keep skin good good you
[1139.08 - 1143.36] don't want stretch marks taking over
[1140.92 - 1145.64] when you gain weight and then you lose
[1143.36 - 1148.72] the weight and you lost all the L right
[1145.64 - 1151.68] elasticity of the skin and you got the
[1148.72 - 1155.36] skin is is way too
[1151.68 - 1156.76] played and it's not bouncing back and
[1155.36 - 1158.56] everybody's trying to get the tummy
[1156.76 - 1160.88] tucks and they're trying to get all the
[1158.56 - 1162.76] different surgeries and Tucks their skin
[1160.88 - 1164.64] won't work with them or maybe you just
[1162.76 - 1166.12] gained a little bit of weight and then
[1164.64 - 1166.96] you got the stretch marks from a little
[1166.12 - 1171.00] bit of
[1166.96 - 1173.28] weight the way we have to address all of
[1171.00 - 1176.00] this is always remember no matter what
[1173.28 - 1180.08] that when we're addressing skin it has
[1176.00 - 1185.96] to be from the bottom up it has to be
[1180.08 - 1187.40] from the ground up so from the ground up
[1185.96 - 1191.92] it can't be
[1187.40 - 1196.16] surface it can't even be follicle
[1191.92 - 1198.28] level it has to be right at the base
[1196.16 - 1202.32] which is what I call the foundation of
[1198.28 - 1207.84] of your skin deep within the Derma and
[1202.32 - 1211.00] right under the Derma right under the
[1207.84 - 1213.20] skin it's like when you peel that skin
[1211.00 - 1216.00] off of a
[1213.20 - 1217.48] chicken when you peel that chicken skin
[1216.00 - 1222.96] off of a
[1217.48 - 1226.88] chicken you want to go between that
[1222.96 - 1230.20] bottom layer of that skin to the flesh
[1226.88 - 1233.20] basically we're talking about
[1230.20 - 1235.24] building that
[1233.20 - 1237.56] deep that
[1235.24 - 1240.52] deep cuz I know that a lot of people
[1237.56 - 1242.48] don't realize how it works with the skin
[1240.52 - 1245.16] they think it's either surface or just
[1242.48 - 1250.32] below the surface it's
[1245.16 - 1253.96] not if you want skin stuff to happen
[1250.32 - 1256.16] it's got to be Boom at the root at the
[1253.96 - 1258.48] root and not at the root of a follicle
[1256.16 - 1260.80] we got to go even deeper than that we
[1258.48 - 1263.08] have to go under the follicle it has to
[1260.80 - 1266.16] be down there and it has to be so deep
[1263.08 - 1268.84] where literally it's just under the
[1266.16 - 1271.52] first layer of Derma it's actually just
[1268.84 - 1273.76] under so it's between that first layer
[1271.52 - 1277.52] of Derma and basically everything else
[1273.76 - 1280.80] in your body it's between
[1277.52 - 1282.76] there and that's key and I want people
[1280.80 - 1285.80] to know
[1282.76 - 1288.44] this it's not out the it's not on the
[1285.80 - 1291.88] outside it's not down under underneath
[1288.44 - 1294.52] the outside it's down so
[1291.88 - 1297.16] low it's
[1294.52 - 1299.08] basically at the bottom and then even
[1297.16 - 1304.12] under that where
[1299.08 - 1307.32] there's fluid to your actual physical
[1304.12 - 1308.36] body Ashley says okay so how do we get
[1307.32 - 1312.56] to the
[1308.36 - 1313.64] root so important to know right it's all
[1312.56 - 1317.20] about
[1313.64 - 1321.64] immune power it's all about immune
[1317.20 - 1325.24] system our immune system patrols that
[1321.64 - 1329.48] area our immune system needs
[1325.24 - 1331.96] antioxidants in that area antioxidants
[1329.48 - 1335.80] are one of the critical
[1331.96 - 1338.00] Builders right there silica one of the
[1335.80 - 1340.84] critical
[1338.00 - 1344.88] Builders stopping oxidative stress
[1340.84 - 1351.00] because oxidative stress lands in the
[1344.88 - 1351.00] Deep depths of the skin oxidative
[1352.60 - 1357.76] stress fight ORF flight every time I see
[1356.12 - 1359.60] anybody in fight or flight or know
[1357.76 - 1363.04] somebody's in fight ORF flight or I'm in
[1359.60 - 1366.00] fight or flight I'm thinking skin I'm
[1363.04 - 1371.08] like my Skin's going to pay the
[1366.00 - 1371.08] price my Skin's going to age
[1371.12 - 1375.60] overnight my Skin's going to take the
[1373.48 - 1377.96] hit anytime I see anybody talking about
[1375.60 - 1379.16] fight ORF flight or anything happen
[1377.96 - 1382.68] happening fight ORF
[1379.16 - 1385.92] flight first thing I think about is skin
[1382.68 - 1389.08] I'm like skin whoa whoa that was really
[1385.92 - 1391.28] stressful skin whoo because what happens
[1389.08 - 1393.68] is and when you're in firefight and all
[1391.28 - 1396.36] that epinephrine is just coursing
[1393.68 - 1398.80] through the body it's so corrosive it's
[1396.36 - 1402.92] like battery acid when we're under
[1398.80 - 1406.12] stress oxidative stress
[1402.92 - 1408.20] oxidizing it winds up trying to find
[1406.12 - 1409.84] itself escaping through your skin when
[1408.20 - 1412.40] you're under stress and you're going
[1409.84 - 1415.00] through all this stuff emotionally
[1412.40 - 1417.80] mentally you might stink
[1415.00 - 1420.56] more you might stink
[1417.80 - 1422.56] more you're under stress you start
[1420.56 - 1425.28] stinking in the armpits you start
[1422.56 - 1429.56] sweating it starts to wreak you're under
[1425.28 - 1429.56] you have a really stressful day you're
[1430.72 - 1435.56] stinking so Manny says is that why we
[1433.32 - 1438.40] look terrible after something stressful
[1435.56 - 1442.08] exactly the skin takes a hit
[1438.40 - 1445.12] when we're up against oxidative stress
[1442.08 - 1447.72] that's why it's critical to battle
[1445.12 - 1450.36] oxidative sh
[1447.72 - 1451.72] stress using sh for a second which is my
[1450.36 - 1455.20] next thing I want to talk about by the
[1451.72 - 1456.80] way that's why but it's critical to know
[1455.20 - 1459.20] that when you're up against that stress
[1456.80 - 1461.20] and you're up against all that different
[1459.20 - 1463.60] emotional turmoil or something's
[1461.20 - 1465.64] happening or it's losses or something's
[1463.60 - 1467.16] going on in your life you don't feel
[1465.64 - 1468.84] like you're getting enough wins in your
[1467.16 - 1471.08] life you got people breathing down your
[1468.84 - 1473.04] neck You' got psychic attacks coming
[1471.08 - 1474.56] whatever it is that you're dealing with
[1473.04 - 1476.92] it's that kind of stress that's
[1474.56 - 1478.84] producing that kind of epinephrine that
[1476.92 - 1481.08] is coursing through the veins and the
[1478.84 - 1483.64] bloodstream and it winds up trying to
[1481.08 - 1486.32] escape through the skin desperately and
[1483.64 - 1488.52] rise out of
[1486.32 - 1491.16] it which leads to the next part I'm
[1488.52 - 1494.48] trying to talk about which then we get
[1491.16 - 1495.80] in trouble if we're if we're challenged
[1494.48 - 1498.04] like that our immune system is
[1495.80 - 1500.92] challenged we end up getting in a a
[1498.04 - 1503.20] place where bugs that reside inside of
[1500.92 - 1506.16] us start to rise up a little bit
[1503.20 - 1507.84] remember you're looking at here immune
[1506.16 - 1511.36] so you're looking at the micro and
[1507.84 - 1513.88] you're seeing immune immune system we're
[1511.36 - 1518.32] up against all this oxidative
[1513.88 - 1520.12] stress our immune system drops all that
[1518.32 - 1522.72] adrenaline's coursing through our veins
[1520.12 - 1524.96] leaking up through the skin that's why
[1522.72 - 1526.84] we have a bad skin looking day when
[1524.96 - 1530.28] we've been through hell and back with
[1526.84 - 1534.00] stress and then bugs want to
[1530.28 - 1536.72] play well my acne is really coming out
[1534.00 - 1538.96] bad I don't know my acne is really bad
[1536.72 - 1540.32] these days pimples they're coming out
[1538.96 - 1545.08] all this kind of
[1540.32 - 1546.68] stuff and that's where oxidative strep
[1545.08 - 1551.60] comes
[1546.68 - 1555.84] in that's where oxidative strep comes
[1551.60 - 1556.68] in so what I love about the Skin Potion
[1555.84 - 1558.92] I'm
[1556.68 - 1560.52] showing which I'm going to show you guys
[1558.92 - 1563.76] I'm going to make it in front of you in
[1560.52 - 1566.20] a minute it's simple it's easy it's fun
[1563.76 - 1569.28] actually tastes good everything's great
[1566.20 - 1571.60] what I'm showing you is immune system
[1569.28 - 1575.92] and then building blocks for
[1571.60 - 1577.20] skin immune system building blocks for
[1575.92 - 1579.60] the
[1577.20 - 1582.20] skin we're up against a little too much
[1579.60 - 1584.28] stress we're in fight or flight we got
[1582.20 - 1587.00] the adrenals pumping the adrenaline's
[1584.28 - 1588.64] corrosive it's going through the veins
[1587.00 - 1592.24] it's surfacing through the skin it's
[1588.64 - 1594.60] leaking out of our pores and it stinks
[1592.24 - 1600.60] and it's corrosive and it smells and
[1594.60 - 1603.48] it's leaking out of our our armpits it's
[1600.60 - 1606.44] everywhere and it smell it's on our
[1603.48 - 1609.88] feet it's why people's feet can smell
[1606.44 - 1612.40] really bad from fight or flight all that
[1609.88 - 1614.64] stress and all that adrenaline soaking
[1612.40 - 1617.20] and purging through her body and can
[1614.64 - 1619.36] make your feet really smell Christy says
[1617.20 - 1622.20] I've had the the flu these past 3 days
[1619.36 - 1622.20] my skin looks
[1622.44 - 1628.32] horrible and that's why I was saying we
[1625.16 - 1631.68] get stressed out our immune system drops
[1628.32 - 1634.12] pathogens can raise up like the
[1631.68 - 1636.76] strep adrenaline courses through our
[1634.12 - 1639.60] body we need immune system support and
[1636.76 - 1641.12] we need skin support and that's what the
[1639.60 - 1644.64] micro C
[1641.12 - 1646.92] is there's Rhyme or Reason here this
[1644.64 - 1650.76] isn't like a supplement and I'm trying
[1646.92 - 1653.60] to so a supplement that's insane there's
[1650.76 - 1656.60] Rhyme or Reason to why things are
[1653.60 - 1656.60] powerful and
[1656.76 - 1662.56] helpful we're stressed
[1659.16 - 1666.12] out our body starts to break down
[1662.56 - 1669.72] oxidative stress starts to
[1666.12 - 1672.56] occur our cells start to take the hit
[1669.72 - 1675.60] free radicals start to rise up and
[1672.56 - 1678.04] saturate cells adrenaline starts to move
[1675.60 - 1682.12] all through the bloodstream
[1678.04 - 1684.48] and puts stress on our
[1682.12 - 1687.52] Landmark which is
[1684.48 - 1690.12] this the bottom of our
[1687.52 - 1694.12] Derma so we're going through
[1690.12 - 1696.68] life if you had a hard life and haven't
[1694.12 - 1698.72] had a chance to protect yourself protect
[1696.68 - 1702.00] your skin and if you've had a hard life
[1698.72 - 1704.48] the skin will show it the skin will show
[1702.00 - 1706.80] it if you haven't had a chance to
[1704.48 - 1710.64] protect yourself and all of this as it's
[1706.80 - 1713.40] happening will actually go and hit the
[1710.64 - 1716.64] bottom of the
[1713.40 - 1716.64] Derma the
[1717.04 - 1721.84] sponge so I want to show you something
[1719.48 - 1721.84] really
[1725.16 - 1729.96] quick so the bottom of the
[1730.08 - 1735.92] Derma acts as a
[1732.52 - 1737.64] sponge that's what it acts as take a
[1735.92 - 1741.00] look at this sponge right here in my my
[1737.64 - 1744.36] hand if you can okay I'll show you guys
[1741.00 - 1745.72] on Tik Tok show you guys on IG see this
[1744.36 - 1750.52] sponge right
[1745.72 - 1755.32] here sponge is actually absorbing our
[1750.52 - 1758.80] skin goes up and down it
[1755.32 - 1761.56] absorbs like a sponge you don't hear
[1758.80 - 1764.24] this out there you won't hear this out
[1761.56 - 1768.08] there of course mm
[1764.24 - 1769.92] info but what it does is it acts as a
[1768.08 - 1771.20] sponge see the bottom of the Derma right
[1769.92 - 1772.16] there and you see the sponge I'm holding
[1771.20 - 1774.68] right
[1772.16 - 1776.56] here when you're under stress all those
[1774.68 - 1778.72] free radicals are pouring through your
[1776.56 - 1781.28] system along with that adrenaline
[1778.72 - 1781.28] emotional
[1782.00 - 1786.52] challenges what's happening is the
[1784.40 - 1789.56] bottom of your Derma right underneath
[1786.52 - 1792.36] there is starting to soak it all up it's
[1789.56 - 1792.36] soaking up the
[1796.32 - 1801.16] adrenaline and as it soaks up the
[1798.80 - 1802.76] adrenaline it tries to rid it as quick
[1801.16 - 1805.84] as it
[1802.76 - 1809.40] can we got a little camera action going
[1805.84 - 1809.40] here let's see what we can
[1809.44 - 1815.12] do we're having fun
[1812.28 - 1817.28] today this is this is an advanced skin
[1815.12 - 1818.36] course right here just so you know
[1817.28 - 1819.52] you're not going to learn this stuff
[1818.36 - 1821.00] anywhere else you're not going to see it
[1819.52 - 1823.44] anywhere else it's an advanced skin
[1821.00 - 1826.12] course on how it works with your skin
[1823.44 - 1828.36] plus stress plus adrenaline so the
[1826.12 - 1831.48] bottom of your Derma right here right
[1828.36 - 1833.56] where your skin even starts and even
[1831.48 - 1835.80] before it starts right before that deep
[1833.56 - 1838.72] layer even
[1835.80 - 1840.96] starts that area right there acts as a
[1838.72 - 1842.40] sponge that's what it does that's why
[1840.96 - 1845.00] you can get dehydrated if you get
[1842.40 - 1846.28] dehydrated your skin feels dehydrated
[1845.00 - 1847.92] did you ever see that where you're
[1846.28 - 1849.80] really dehydrated you ever run into
[1847.92 - 1852.52] somebody and you can pinch their skin
[1849.80 - 1855.84] and nothing bounces back you pinch their
[1852.52 - 1860.64] skin nothing bounces back like you pinch
[1855.84 - 1862.28] it and it's like stuck or halfway stuck
[1860.64 - 1864.40] did you ever see that you guys where you
[1862.28 - 1868.60] pinch their
[1864.40 - 1871.80] skin because the Derma at the base is a
[1868.60 - 1872.88] sponge basically it's sitting there and
[1871.80 - 1875.28] it it's
[1872.88 - 1877.96] absorbing and then it's
[1875.28 - 1880.36] releasing it sponges up all the
[1877.96 - 1882.72] adrenaline from flight uh fight ORF
[1880.36 - 1884.80] flight right here all the adrenaline
[1882.72 - 1889.16] from any kind of emotional stress
[1884.80 - 1889.16] whatsoever it sponges it up
[1889.20 - 1894.64] and then it tries to push it through the
[1892.04 - 1896.64] surface of the skin if it
[1894.64 - 1898.12] can and here's the thing you might be
[1896.64 - 1900.00] some of you exercise a lot you're like
[1898.12 - 1901.68] well I sweat it all out I exercise I
[1900.00 - 1905.08] sweat it all out that's
[1901.68 - 1908.64] great that's great all that adrenaline
[1905.08 - 1910.96] you're yeah coursing through with all
[1908.64 - 1912.52] that sweat that's right right through
[1910.96 - 1913.92] your skin tissue then what are you doing
[1912.52 - 1917.68] to protect your skin and collagen
[1913.92 - 1919.20] because guess what that is damaging to
[1917.68 - 1921.76] the skin I'm not saying exercise is
[1919.20 - 1923.48] damaging I'm saying in general as all
[1921.76 - 1925.32] that oxidative stress and adrenaline and
[1923.48 - 1928.04] free radicals go rushing through that
[1925.32 - 1930.48] sponge inside the Derma inside the skin
[1928.04 - 1932.20] and it forces its way through the skin
[1930.48 - 1934.68] what are we doing to protect the skin
[1932.20 - 1937.68] because that's how our skin ages really
[1934.68 - 1937.68] quick and really
[1939.80 - 1944.04] fast and what are people going to do
[1941.96 - 1946.84] they're going to micro needle they're
[1944.04 - 1948.36] going to exfoliate the crap out of their
[1946.84 - 1951.00] skin skin their
[1948.36 - 1953.08] exfoliations left and right they're
[1951.00 - 1956.32] going to try scrubs they're going to be
[1953.08 - 1957.88] scrubbing their skin left and right
[1956.32 - 1959.48] because that's what they're going to do
[1957.88 - 1961.28] and I understand why and then they're
[1959.48 - 1963.96] going to use all kinds of different
[1961.28 - 1966.08] ointments and different creams that have
[1963.96 - 1967.76] all kinds of fragrances in them that
[1966.08 - 1973.12] hurt our
[1967.76 - 1977.00] skin once again it's from the inside out
[1973.12 - 1980.48] and it's about getting to the deep under
[1977.00 - 1983.88] underneath layer into that sponge into
[1980.48 - 1985.84] that Derma right here okay I'll move
[1983.88 - 1989.12] this here so you guys can see a closeup
[1985.84 - 1993.92] down here it's about that layer right
[1989.12 - 1997.52] there you see it underneath the
[1993.92 - 2000.84] folicles way further deep underneath the
[1997.52 - 2004.64] follicles that's where it
[2000.84 - 2008.04] counts that's how you heal the surface
[2004.64 - 2012.84] that's how you heal the middle it has to
[2008.04 - 2015.00] be addressed right here at the base and
[2012.84 - 2016.56] we can't control every situation we
[2015.00 - 2018.88] can't control the stress runder the
[2016.56 - 2021.28] oxidative stress we can't control
[2018.88 - 2026.00] someone else and what they do we can't
[2021.28 - 2029.44] control the weather we can't control a
[2026.00 - 2031.84] hurricane we can't control the evil that
[2029.44 - 2034.12] happens on this planet and there's a lot
[2031.84 - 2038.08] of evil happening on this planet we know
[2034.12 - 2040.36] that can't control any of that
[2038.08 - 2043.16] but so many people are worried about
[2040.36 - 2047.20] their skin I hear it until the cows come
[2043.16 - 2048.84] home every single day out there and so I
[2047.20 - 2050.32] wanted to talk about it a little bit
[2048.84 - 2054.04] because I see the confusion out there
[2050.32 - 2056.44] about skin it's vast it's great the
[2054.04 - 2059.16] confusion and I want to talk about why
[2056.44 - 2061.04] our skin falls apart from stress and if
[2059.16 - 2064.12] we're not doing anything for the stress
[2061.04 - 2065.48] and here's why I like this take a look
[2064.12 - 2067.52] this is the whole point here I'll get a
[2065.48 - 2071.44] closeup on this as well here's why I
[2067.52 - 2073.44] like this the micro immune power you put
[2071.44 - 2076.40] this with the MSM and I'm going to do it
[2073.44 - 2078.16] right now and make a potion you put this
[2076.40 - 2080.44] together you're talking about that
[2078.16 - 2083.32] organic bamboo silica you're talking
[2080.44 - 2085.88] about the two types of vitamin C that
[2083.32 - 2089.12] doesn't Scorch your stomach
[2085.88 - 2091.40] lining it's buffered it's not like that
[2089.12 - 2093.88] ascorbic acid out there that tears
[2091.40 - 2095.72] people's guts up right it makes people
[2093.88 - 2097.32] get the runs and the diarrhea and it
[2095.72 - 2098.68] makes them not feel good and you can't
[2097.32 - 2101.16] take enough of it and I'm not talking
[2098.68 - 2103.00] about that other junk too that ascorbic
[2101.16 - 2106.00] acid that's in the fat
[2103.00 - 2107.96] lipids uh good luck getting that vitamin
[2106.00 - 2111.32] C to
[2107.96 - 2114.80] cells that's awful and there's no
[2111.32 - 2117.60] anti-caking agents in here this stuff is
[2114.80 - 2120.96] pure and that right there is incredible
[2117.60 - 2123.68] and what do you do you're battling
[2120.96 - 2125.32] stress with all of it you're supporting
[2123.68 - 2127.20] the immune system you got building
[2125.32 - 2129.04] blocks for the collagen right there
[2127.20 - 2132.36] you're not getting fooled or tricked or
[2129.04 - 2135.64] duped and sold collagen which as I said
[2132.36 - 2138.68] before doesn't fix collagen or create
[2135.64 - 2141.08] collagen and then you got the silica
[2138.68 - 2143.80] which is critical for the skin and the
[2141.08 - 2147.04] Derma and then combined with the
[2143.80 - 2148.40] oxidative free radical breaker which is
[2147.04 - 2151.24] the vitamin C and the two kinds of
[2148.40 - 2153.80] vitamin C that's buffered and you
[2151.24 - 2155.16] combine that with the lemon balm for the
[2153.80 - 2157.32] nervous
[2155.16 - 2160.84] system that's what I'm talking about you
[2157.32 - 2164.84] get a free lemon bomb with the micro C
[2160.84 - 2166.44] and 5% off on the MSM unbelievable let's

[2182.32 - 2187.52] working on this I got my skin right here
[2185.04 - 2191.84] let's get the stomach out of here
[2187.52 - 2191.84] little bit maybe we'll move the liver as
[2198.24 - 2204.64] well I'm going to eat liver like a
[2202.76 - 2207.32] [ __ ] all
[2204.64 - 2209.96] right now look I get it people like to
[2207.32 - 2212.40] taste the liver it's it's it's a food
[2209.96 - 2215.92] for survival back years ago back if you
[2212.40 - 2218.00] go 100 years ago and you ran out of meat
[2215.92 - 2219.04] but you had a de hydrated liver you
[2218.00 - 2221.96] better believe it you're going to be
[2219.04 - 2221.96] eating that liver for
[2222.12 - 2228.04] survival for survival you'll eat
[2224.80 - 2229.68] dirt you'll eat anything but it's a bad
[2228.04 - 2232.64] idea it's filled with toxins the liver
[2229.68 - 2234.92] is filled with so many toxins you know
[2232.64 - 2236.48] when I see people like dehydrated liver
[2234.92 - 2239.84] and smoothies and stuff like that out
[2236.48 - 2243.08] there in the health field in the health
[2239.84 - 2245.40] realm I I don't want to laugh I don't
[2243.08 - 2247.36] think it's funny because I realize what
[2245.40 - 2249.68] it's going to do to people's skin
[2247.36 - 2251.68] because liver is so filled with it's the
[2249.68 - 2254.64] toxic waste dump of the animal I don't
[2251.68 - 2258.80] care if it's the grass-fed of all Grassi
[2254.64 - 2261.16] fed beef there is B Vine grass-fed I
[2258.80 - 2264.08] don't care the liver still has filled
[2261.16 - 2266.16] with poison and toxin inside that cow
[2264.08 - 2267.76] and this isn't an anti- cow talk I'm
[2266.16 - 2270.08] just saying it's filled the toxins and
[2267.76 - 2273.32] poisons just like our livers fill the
[2270.08 - 2276.12] toxins and poisons right and that liver
[2273.32 - 2277.96] you eat that and that goes to the skin
[2276.12 - 2281.48] all those time toxins and
[2277.96 - 2283.52] poisons all right let's do this now this
[2281.48 - 2286.12] is kind of fun I think this is actually
[2283.52 - 2290.40] really fun all
[2286.12 - 2293.36] right let's go I'm going to get some
[2290.40 - 2295.52] water get a little bit of water here
[2293.36 - 2298.40] this is warm water so to make the Skin
[2295.52 - 2301.00] Potion you need some warm water not hot
[2298.40 - 2305.08] water important to understand do not get
[2301.00 - 2307.48] that tea kettle boiling where it is
[2305.08 - 2309.40] really really hot and you're dumping in
[2307.48 - 2312.44] that really really hot water don't do
[2309.40 - 2315.88] that please in order to make the Skin
[2312.44 - 2318.88] Potion okay you want water that's warm I
[2315.88 - 2322.08] feel this it doesn't hurt to leave your
[2318.88 - 2323.68] hands on on it you stick your finger in
[2322.08 - 2326.76] there you don't get
[2323.68 - 2328.32] burned that's the kind of water I like
[2326.76 - 2330.80] all right first of all I'm going to put
[2328.32 - 2334.16] some powders in
[2330.80 - 2335.52] there and I'm going to move little this
[2334.16 - 2338.52] out of the
[2335.52 - 2338.52] way
[2338.80 - 2343.32] okay I think I'm going to make some room
[2348.68 - 2353.56] here okay first things first we're going
[2351.20 - 2353.56] to put a
[2353.68 - 2358.52] scoop in
[2356.24 - 2362.08] here of the micro
[2358.52 - 2362.08] C immune
[2362.72 - 2367.44] power okay then we're going to put two
[2365.68 - 2370.52] capsules
[2367.44 - 2372.80] of the MSM the bamboo
[2370.52 - 2376.56] silica right
[2372.80 - 2380.48] here two capsules
[2376.56 - 2380.48] inside our little
[2382.36 - 2389.16] cup I'm opening capsules if you guys
[2385.64 - 2391.56] want to know I just opened up these
[2389.16 - 2395.40] capsules
[2391.56 - 2398.20] okay then I'm looking
[2395.40 - 2399.60] for a little knife here because I'm
[2398.20 - 2402.00] going to put
[2399.60 - 2403.36] orange you can choose lemon but I'm
[2402.00 - 2405.88] going to put orange and there's a reason
[2403.36 - 2409.28] why orange is going in here it's not for
[2405.88 - 2412.04] flavor and it's not for Taste although
[2409.28 - 2414.12] it does taste good because it's a juicy
[2412.04 - 2417.04] orange we're going to squeeze half an
[2414.12 - 2420.12] orange in here the reason is because
[2417.04 - 2422.60] what's in this orange are two things one
[2420.12 - 2425.08] is calcium there's a little bit of
[2422.60 - 2427.08] silica and orange too and there's
[2425.08 - 2427.92] vitamin C
[2427.08 - 2430.48] three
[2427.92 - 2433.08] things what we have in this orange are
[2430.48 - 2436.20] three things but I need those three
[2433.08 - 2439.16] things because I am introducing those
[2436.20 - 2443.76] three things in its living form fresh
[2439.16 - 2443.76] out of an orange to the pure
[2444.28 - 2447.28] form
[2448.68 - 2453.28] here so what we're doing is we're
[2454.28 - 2459.96] introducing the actual C
[2456.88 - 2463.52] energetic blend of these
[2459.96 - 2465.80] together now here's the cool
[2463.52 - 2469.60] thing the orange in there not only makes
[2465.80 - 2471.92] it taste good but what it's doing is
[2469.60 - 2475.52] that vitamin C inside the orange right
[2471.92 - 2481.08] there is connecting to the two kinds of
[2475.52 - 2481.08] pure vitamin C in here in the immune
[2481.12 - 2487.40] power we're mixing
[2484.00 - 2490.08] them at the same time we're
[2487.40 - 2492.68] connecting the
[2490.08 - 2497.20] calcium the vitamin
[2492.68 - 2499.96] C and silica to the
[2497.20 - 2502.28] MSM we're connecting the silica that's
[2499.96 - 2504.04] naturally in an orange there's a little
[2502.28 - 2506.60] bit in an orange we're connecting that
[2504.04 - 2509.56] to the organic bamboo silica we're
[2506.60 - 2512.08] connecting that to the two other
[2509.56 - 2515.20] varieties of vitamin C powerful vitamin
[2512.08 - 2517.60] C and we're putting it all together and
[2515.20 - 2522.08] we're making our skin
[2517.60 - 2522.08] potion so we got our orange squeezed in
[2523.56 - 2526.92] there if you go all the way back to the
[2525.76 - 2529.16] beginning here you'll see why I
[2526.92 - 2533.08] recommend vitamin C
[2529.16 - 2533.08] silica yep for your
[2535.08 - 2540.04] skin and if you go way before this video
[2538.24 - 2541.92] right here that we're creating we're
[2540.04 - 2544.32] live right now but way before this is
[2541.92 - 2546.52] why I've been talking about it for
[2544.32 - 2548.28] decades all right so let's get some warm
[2546.52 - 2552.00] water in
[2548.28 - 2552.00] here and we're going to mix
[2553.52 - 2558.24] it and you have the Skin Potion right
[2558.72 - 2562.52] there get a little spoon
[2571.96 - 2578.76] out now what I recommend is don't drink
[2575.60 - 2581.96] it right right away give it a couple of
[2578.76 - 2584.32] minutes give it a good spin a good mix
[2581.96 - 2587.16] and give it a couple of minutes and I
[2584.32 - 2588.48] like to sip on it and take it with the
[2587.16 - 2590.80] lemon
[2588.48 - 2593.52] balm is what I like to
[2590.80 - 2595.36] do a little lemon bomb to relax the
[2593.52 - 2596.52] nerves and calm you can take the lemon
[2595.36 - 2598.60] bomb
[2596.52 - 2600.20] before because what I'm doing with the
[2598.60 - 2602.04] lemon
[2600.20 - 2605.08] bomb is
[2602.04 - 2608.20] reducing stress inside the
[2605.08 - 2611.24] body so that's what I'm doing reducing
[2608.20 - 2613.40] stress and then I'm using this right
[2611.24 - 2618.00] here the Skin
[2613.40 - 2621.28] Potion to battle the free radicals to
[2618.00 - 2623.56] battle the oxidative stress to battle
[2621.28 - 2627.56] the corrosive
[2623.56 - 2630.64] adrenaline and to feed the bottom of the
[2627.56 - 2632.92] Derma it's about feeding the bottom of
[2630.64 - 2635.24] the Derma that
[2632.92 - 2636.84] sponge if you don't have orange you can
[2635.24 - 2640.72] use lemon or
[2636.84 - 2643.04] lime but orange is my
[2640.72 - 2644.48] favorite now What's Happening Here is
[2643.04 - 2645.84] I'm giving it a minute and I'm about to
[2644.48 - 2647.20] start sipping it and I want to talk
[2645.84 - 2650.16] about what happens when you're sipping
[2647.20 - 2650.16] this Skin
[2651.12 - 2656.64] Potion I'm going to do a sip right now I
[2653.48 - 2656.64] think it's been a couple of minutes just
[2659.56 - 2666.60] about you feel this when you just sip
[2663.28 - 2668.56] it you feel it you give it just
[2666.60 - 2671.04] 20 seconds and you instantly start
[2668.56 - 2674.88] feeling it you feel it actually get to
[2671.04 - 2677.20] places fast there's nothing
[2674.88 - 2680.16] inhibiting this from getting to where it
[2677.20 - 2682.00] needs to go there's nothing in the way
[2680.16 - 2684.28] of it there isn't a whole bunch of fatty
[2682.00 - 2686.44] lipids in there this isn't one of those
[2684.28 - 2689.80] supplementation things where you got
[2686.44 - 2691.48] ascorbic acid mixed with all this fat
[2689.80 - 2693.76] which doesn't get to where you need to
[2691.48 - 2696.76] go it cancels out itself actually it
[2693.76 - 2699.76] cancels itself out this is just
[2696.76 - 2702.36] literally straight mainlining it right
[2699.76 - 2705.44] here make sure it's stirred
[2702.36 - 2708.04] enough because the
[2705.44 - 2710.56] bottom might get stuck there as you pour
[2708.04 - 2712.68] the liquid in so just like anything any
[2710.56 - 2715.76] kind of powder you place
[2712.68 - 2717.72] into make sure it stirred
[2715.76 - 2719.72] enough now you're welcome to put a
[2717.72 - 2721.64] little bit more orange than what I did I
[2719.72 - 2723.08] just put like kind of a quarter of I
[2721.64 - 2727.88] didn't squeeze the whole thing in but
[2723.08 - 2730.32] you're allowed to put more in there
[2727.88 - 2730.32] and that's
[2731.40 - 2735.12] fine I'm going to give it a
[2738.76 - 2744.64] second it's strong you feel
[2742.72 - 2748.56] it it's
[2744.64 - 2750.92] intense it goes in quick it goes into
[2748.56 - 2753.08] the bloodstream fast for people that are
[2750.92 - 2755.96] asking there's a direct link that puts
[2753.08 - 2757.76] the products in one cart check it out
[2755.96 - 2760.72] out the link is in the profile link is
[2757.76 - 2763.12] in the description it puts both all
[2760.72 - 2766.48] three products
[2763.12 - 2766.48] in one
[2766.84 - 2771.08] cart we're going to take some lemon bomb
[2768.92 - 2773.28] in a minute too let me see if I can find
[2771.08 - 2776.92] a little bit of a shot
[2773.28 - 2779.96] glass or I'll find it in a little
[2776.92 - 2782.40] bit okay
[2779.96 - 2786.84] now couple things to
[2782.40 - 2789.92] know it just feels good it feels good
[2786.84 - 2792.56] very strong very
[2789.92 - 2794.68] potent when you let it co through your
[2792.56 - 2797.48] bloodstream just
[2794.68 - 2800.52] imagine how it's finding its
[2797.48 - 2804.56] way to
[2800.52 - 2807.12] here it's finding its way to
[2804.56 - 2810.04] here the
[2807.12 - 2813.32] bottom of your skin the bottom of your
[2810.04 - 2817.48] Derma imagine it's finding its way
[2813.32 - 2820.04] there that's where it's heading
[2817.48 - 2823.20] to help clean that up now what happens
[2820.04 - 2824.36] is when you gain weight and you lose
[2823.20 - 2827.00] weight do you ever notice that some
[2824.36 - 2828.84] people they lose weight their skin the
[2827.00 - 2830.88] stretch marks just somehow just
[2828.84 - 2833.60] disappear and some people they lose
[2830.88 - 2837.36] weight a stretch marks are still there
[2833.60 - 2839.76] even two people relatively at the same
[2837.36 - 2842.20] weight roughly might not be give or take
[2839.76 - 2845.00] a pound or two different but give or
[2842.20 - 2848.84] take either way they lost weight they
[2845.00 - 2853.32] weighed similar they had enough weight
[2848.84 - 2855.64] on their body that was equal um Miller
[2853.32 - 2857.28] says can we drink it every day or how
[2855.64 - 2858.04] often could it be used every day you can
[2857.28 - 2861.20] use
[2858.04 - 2862.24] it you can drink it every single day how
[2861.20 - 2866.12] much
[2862.24 - 2867.64] water a one cup to two cups is fine if
[2866.12 - 2869.60] you really have to do a half a cup for
[2867.64 - 2871.12] some reason you can but one to two cups
[2869.60 - 2873.96] of
[2871.12 - 2877.72] water if you need to do less for some
[2873.96 - 2877.72] reason you can
[2880.76 - 2885.48] but you feel it every time you take a
[2883.40 - 2887.48] sip of
[2885.48 - 2889.32] this you feel it going through the
[2887.48 - 2891.24] bloodstream because it gets there quick
[2889.32 - 2893.48] because it's not being
[2891.24 - 2896.44] inhibited so I want to cover stretch
[2893.48 - 2897.96] mark talk a little bit let's go into
[2896.44 - 2900.64] that I think stretch marks are a big
[2897.96 - 2903.60] deal for a lot of people a lot of people
[2900.64 - 2907.04] are upset by stretch marks they feel
[2903.60 - 2911.00] that they feel upset they feel like
[2907.04 - 2914.40] betrayed they work so hard to lose their
[2911.00 - 2916.48] weight they work really hard and then
[2914.40 - 2918.88] they have the stretch marks and they're
[2916.48 - 2921.52] like wow I did all this work I got rid
[2918.88 - 2923.12] of some excess unwanted pounds and now
[2921.52 - 2926.80] I'm dealing with stretch
[2923.12 - 2929.24] marks reason for those stretch
[2926.80 - 2931.32] marks obviously is because you're
[2929.24 - 2935.44] expanding right when you gain weight we
[2931.32 - 2939.60] expand we swell we expand so then we get
[2935.44 - 2942.40] more more more tissue growth more skin
[2939.60 - 2945.92] because we're actually stretching the
[2942.40 - 2947.08] skin our body overcompensates more skin
[2945.92 - 2952.08] is
[2947.08 - 2956.16] produced but even with that if someone
[2952.08 - 2958.00] gains a few pounds or 10 lb 15 or 20 lb
[2956.16 - 2959.92] and they lose the weight some people
[2958.00 - 2962.80] their stretch marks are a lot worse than
[2959.92 - 2966.40] some other people the reason for
[2962.80 - 2968.68] that is the very base the Landmark I'm
[2966.40 - 2970.76] talking about that we want to protect
[2968.68 - 2973.12] and we want to support that very
[2970.76 - 2975.40] landmark and
[2973.12 - 2977.60] base is
[2975.40 - 2980.40] deficient it's
[2977.60 - 2983.40] deficient and it's saturated and soaked
[2980.40 - 2984.80] up with toxins and free radicals that
[2983.40 - 2987.04] have been there for
[2984.80 - 2989.20] years and it's sufficient of things that
[2987.04 - 2989.20] it
[2989.84 - 2993.36] needs so that
[2993.76 - 3000.88] sponge got overs saturated with too much
[2996.60 - 3002.36] poisons fight ORF flight too many toxins
[3000.88 - 3004.24] right here at the base right here at the
[3002.36 - 3006.72] bottom too much
[3004.24 - 3009.24] adrenalin and it got
[3006.72 - 3010.68] damaged and when that base that bottom
[3009.24 - 3013.44] of that Derma gets
[3010.68 - 3016.56] damaged we don't it doesn't bounce back
[3013.44 - 3019.96] easy the staticity is
[3016.56 - 3024.16] gone collagen
[3019.96 - 3026.72] weakens we lose Vitality in the bottom
[3024.16 - 3030.60] of our Derma
[3026.72 - 3030.60] that's where it starts to really
[3031.36 - 3034.72] disappear and if you're dealing with
[3033.16 - 3036.00] somebody with a stagnant sluggish liver
[3034.72 - 3038.16] which is a big part of it all because
[3036.00 - 3039.56] that's saturated with toxins and poisons
[3038.16 - 3041.12] right Dr fine you're saying it right
[3039.56 - 3043.96] there it's stagnant sluggish liver
[3041.12 - 3046.08] possibly you're talking about this
[3043.96 - 3049.12] too it doesn't
[3046.08 - 3051.28] help in fact that's a big deal on its
[3049.12 - 3053.20] own some people might have a really
[3051.28 - 3055.20] toxic liver because they're so toxic
[3053.20 - 3056.36] that the Derma got filled up with a lot
[3055.20 - 3058.88] more
[3056.36 - 3061.44] toxins and saturate it with a lot more
[3058.88 - 3064.32] adrenaline and then when they lost the
[3061.44 - 3065.60] weight the elti the elasticity is
[3064.32 - 3068.92] actually
[3065.60 - 3072.28] gone they don't have that play that room
[3068.92 - 3074.92] to play anymore it doesn't Revitalize
[3072.28 - 3077.40] easy it doesn't bounce back quick at all
[3074.92 - 3081.16] and then we have the stretch
[3077.40 - 3082.68] mark left over so what we're doing here
[3081.16 - 3084.84] we're talking about building the
[3082.68 - 3087.40] building blocks we're talking about down
[3084.84 - 3090.04] there in that area we're talking about
[3087.40 - 3094.20] restoring collagen because you can't eat
[3090.04 - 3098.04] collagen to actually rebuild collagen it
[3094.20 - 3101.28] doesn't work we have to rebuild the base
[3098.04 - 3103.88] have to rebuild the landmark and the
[3101.28 - 3107.24] foundation because in there is the
[3103.88 - 3110.24] secret to fixing lots of scarring that's
[3107.24 - 3114.36] occurred at least slowing down
[3110.24 - 3117.88] scarring CU scarring can continue on its
[3114.36 - 3119.88] own kind of like keloids do a lot of
[3117.88 - 3122.08] people they have scarring on the skin
[3119.88 - 3124.36] but the scarring can
[3122.08 - 3127.08] continue long
[3124.36 - 3128.68] past the time where you got the scar so
[3127.08 - 3130.80] if you're micro
[3128.68 - 3133.16] needling which is you know which people
[3130.80 - 3136.36] have done you get tiny little scars over
[3133.16 - 3138.96] time they can build we want to avoid
[3136.36 - 3140.32] that same way when people get tattoos
[3138.96 - 3143.40] the skin is
[3140.32 - 3145.80] scarred a lot of people
[3143.40 - 3149.52] lose they lose the
[3145.80 - 3151.80] look of their tattoo they lose the shine
[3149.52 - 3154.28] of it not just because the toxic heavy
[3151.80 - 3155.60] metals are are diminishing and leaving
[3154.28 - 3157.28] and going into their bloodstream and
[3155.60 - 3159.68] organs not because that this isn't a
[3157.28 - 3162.32] toxic heavy metal talk but because of
[3159.68 - 3166.16] also the skin has been scarred from the
[3162.32 - 3167.92] tattoo work and over time some people
[3166.16 - 3171.04] their their tattoos will fade even
[3167.92 - 3173.52] faster because the skin is actually
[3171.04 - 3175.56] building little scars micro scars that
[3173.52 - 3178.40] we can't see so that's why why it's
[3175.56 - 3180.88] important to actually help our skin when
[3178.40 - 3182.40] if we have tattoos to help our skin if
[3180.88 - 3184.56] we've done something with our skin to
[3182.40 - 3187.28] help it if we want that elasticity back
[3184.56 - 3189.36] to help it if we want it to look better
[3187.28 - 3192.16] if we've been under a lot of stress we
[3189.36 - 3194.00] want that skin looking good and bouncing
[3192.16 - 3198.08] back if we've gained weight we want
[3194.00 - 3198.08] stretch marks to be eased
[3198.20 - 3205.48] down all of that matters Deonte says I
[3202.12 - 3207.68] don't understand when put in the lemon
[3205.48 - 3210.68] with a lemon
[3207.68 - 3210.68] bomb
[3212.24 - 3218.16] okay so the lemon
[3214.88 - 3220.80] bomb add a little bit of water to
[3218.16 - 3225.32] this can be
[3220.80 - 3225.32] before in the middle or
[3225.68 - 3231.92] after you can do the lemon bomb before
[3229.40 - 3234.48] right now I'm in the middle of of doing
[3231.92 - 3237.60] this and I want to show you the lemon
[3234.48 - 3239.84] bomb I I showed you guys up against
[3237.60 - 3241.60] other lemon bombs right how incredible
[3239.84 - 3243.32] this lemon balm is remember I did that
[3241.60 - 3245.16] where I brought other lemon balbs in I
[3243.32 - 3247.36] showed you the difference and what's in
[3245.16 - 3249.60] those lemon balbs and
[3247.36 - 3252.16] everything so that's the lemon balm
[3249.60 - 3255.84] right there so you can take that lemon
[3252.16 - 3258.36] balb before you actually do your skin
[3255.84 - 3261.32] potion in the middle of the Skin Potion
[3258.36 - 3261.32] which I'm in the middle of
[3261.52 - 3266.72] it you can sip the Skin Potion for a
[3264.84 - 3269.80] couple coup of
[3266.72 - 3272.16] hours you can literally nurse it if you
[3269.80 - 3275.68] want to and give yourself
[3272.16 - 3278.32] infusions of the Skin Potion you don't
[3275.68 - 3282.00] have to just send it all down one
[3278.32 - 3283.88] shot you can do less water if you'd like
[3282.00 - 3286.88] you can just do a half a cup of water if
[3283.88 - 3289.36] you really like but you you can nurse
[3286.88 - 3290.68] it that's what you should do too I mean
[3289.36 - 3292.36] that's one option unless you're in a
[3290.68 - 3297.08] rush or something like that give
[3292.36 - 3297.08] yourself like small infusion
[3298.92 - 3302.28] and you can do your lemon bomb in the
[3307.04 - 3311.72] middle
[3308.80 - 3314.28] bartender give me

[3319.32 - 3322.88] Fergenson might be stuck on the toilet
[3321.28 - 3323.72] and right now I don't want to disturb
[3322.88 - 3326.64] both of
[3323.72 - 3328.60] them re watch this live after it's
[3326.64 - 3330.52] posted please because it's it's loaded

[3379.92 - 3383.92] information out there they're tortured
[3382.12 - 3385.92] by what they're worried about with their
[3383.92 - 3388.08] skin
[3385.92 - 3390.12] I think everybody everybody is beautiful
[3388.08 - 3393.28] I think you know it's not that I think
[3390.12 - 3395.64] that people though they have a hard time
[3393.28 - 3399.80] they want their skin looking a certain
[3395.64 - 3403.68] way and I understand I understand the
[3399.80 - 3406.28] pain so many people go through with skin
[3403.68 - 3409.12] issues their face their
[3406.28 - 3412.16] skin on their hands their arms all these
[3409.12 - 3414.88] different places but I just want people
[3412.16 - 3418.04] to have an opportunity that's you know
[3414.88 - 3421.64] you know extremely valuable and in their
[3418.04 - 3424.36] hands choices and options that matter
[3421.64 - 3426.16] and help so when it comes down to skin
[3424.36 - 3428.28] this the Skin Potion I was talking about

[3434.76 - 3439.40] if you haven't subscribed but you guys
[3437.08 - 3441.56] know that already someone just ask odd
[3439.40 - 3446.48] parrot said on Instagram what's in the
[3441.56 - 3449.04] Skin Potion it's the micro immune power
[3446.48 - 3450.08] I'll show you right on IG right there
[3449.04 - 3453.16] it's
[3450.08 - 3456.84] that and it's the
[3453.16 - 3457.88] MSM right there it's a combination along
[3456.84 - 3460.28] with the
[3457.88 - 3463.04] orange because what I'm doing is
[3460.28 - 3465.04] introducing vitamin C from the orange to
[3463.04 - 3467.64] the two kinds of vitamin C incredible
[3465.04 - 3469.68] vitamin C in
[3467.64 - 3472.04] here and
[3469.68 - 3473.40] that's but there's one more thing I did
[3472.04 - 3475.24] forget to tell you because there's so
[3473.40 - 3476.96] many different things is the glucose
[3475.24 - 3480.60] from the orange the reason why I like
[3476.96 - 3484.00] the orange the best as the activator
[3480.60 - 3486.44] here in this potion is because of the
[3484.00 - 3488.84] glucose it helps it Mainline into your
[3486.44 - 3491.08] bloodstream quick because there's no fat
[3488.84 - 3494.20] inhibiting there's no fat in the way and
[3491.08 - 3497.00] the micro C and the
[3494.20 - 3499.60] MSM get into the glucose of the orange
[3497.00 - 3503.00] and travels really quickly into the
[3499.60 - 3503.00] bloodstream and that's what I
[3503.72 - 3508.76] love just you know the link in the
[3505.72 - 3512.28] description Link in the profile puts in
[3508.76 - 3515.32] one cart the discount and the products
[3512.28 - 3520.20] so it puts the micro C it puts the lemon
[3515.32 - 3523.88] balb it puts the MSM the 5% off the free
[3520.20 - 3527.80] lemon bomb in one product right there
[3523.88 - 3528.96] and then we add that to the Living Water
[3527.80 - 3531.64] of the
[3528.96 - 3532.72] orange and the living glucose from the
[3531.64 - 3534.72] orange because that's what you're
[3532.72 - 3536.60] dealing with the living glucose from
[3534.72 - 3540.04] from the
[3536.60 - 3543.08] orange all right you guys we talked
[3540.04 - 3545.52] about oxidative stress we talked about

[3545.52 - 3549.72] foundation we talked about collagen how
[3547.72 - 3552.16] it doesn't work we're talking about
[3549.72 - 3553.04] building collagen and building the
[3552.16 - 3555.48] immune
[3553.04 - 3558.00] system and we can't ever get enough
[3555.48 - 3561.44] vitamin C with the world we live in the
[3558.00 - 3564.68] right kind of vitamin c does wonders
