and people can't pinpoint they don't

234
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,440
understand it personality disorders

235
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,480
toxic you don't think anybody has a

236
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:49,519
personality disorder believe me they do

237
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,399
lissa what is the personalization

238
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,240
right

239
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,760
what is the personalization

240
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,080
feeling numb

241
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,800
you don't feel anything

242
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:01,040
you don't you you can't connect

243
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,800
you can't connect to yourself you can't

244
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,519
connect to others

245
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:08,399
others it's like are you there are you

246
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:11,279
there it's like a form of depression

247
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:13,920
but yet you don't know you're depressed

248
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:16,080
you don't know you're really depressed

249
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,399
or it's a feeling of always feeling like

250
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,560
you're missing out on something you're

251
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:23,440
missing out on something you don't know

252
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:26,160
what it is you're lost and you can't

253
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,800
find yourself or find out where you're

254
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:31,839
going depersonalization

255
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,760
you feel lost all the time you feel like

256
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,279
you're supposed to be somewhere else but

257
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,839
you don't know where you're supposed to

258
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,360
be or you feel numb and you're just

259
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,120
laying in bed when you wake up in the

260
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,040
morning and you feel kind of dread

261
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,519
inside of you you don't want to greet

262
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:49,120
the day and you feel numb these are all

263
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:51,279
different versions of depersonalization

264
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,160
smith and pepper said that's me for sure

265
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,920
jekyll and hyde or depersonalization

266
00:09:54,160 --> 00:10:00,000
right

267
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:01,760
so it's important to get the medals out

268
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,360
it's a critical time this is the

269
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,320
preliminary

270
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,560
time to get us prepared

271
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,320
i got everything right here to talk

272
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,680
about how we should get prepared we're

273
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,600
going to talk about metals how we get

274
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,519
metals how all that happens we're going

275
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,320
to talk about it really important right

276
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:21,040
there what are your reviews on amalgams

277
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:24,000
the fillings can we do heavy metal with

278
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,720
amalgam fillings absolutely if i had a

279
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,040
whole bunch of amalgams in there i would

280
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,200
be doing the heavy metal detox cleanse

281
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,120
because you're trying to get metal

282
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,560
that's escaping so you're trying to get

283
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,800
mercury that's escaping that's what

284
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,320
you're doing so

285
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,360
if you're somebody

286
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,680
right

287
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,320
that you got all that mercury filling

288
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:47,279
silver fillings in your teeth or had

289
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,560
them at one point in your teeth

290
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,880
ow

291
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:53,279
ow oh my god

292
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,560
if you had if you're somebody that has

293
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,399
all that

294
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,600
in your teeth right

295
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:02,079
or had them keep in mind that it's

296
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,279
you're not trying to use the heavy metal

297
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:08,560
detox movie to get the amalgam out

298
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:11,440
you're you're using it for the bleed

299
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,600
the bleed over right the filling is

300
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,920
bleeding over

301
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:19,200
it's outgassing

302
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:21,040
out pocketing so you're catching what's

303
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,640
leaving that's what you do when you're

304
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,279
doing the heavy metal detox smoothie

305
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,200
right there okay

306
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,440
if you're somebody that had braces

307
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,399
someday or you had braces a long time

308
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:35,120
ago right so you had the braces it's a

309
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:37,360
lot of metal and it gets into our system

310
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:41,440
it gets into our nerves it gets into our

311
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:43,920
throat it gets into our thyroid

312
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,240
so we're trying to get medals out that's

313
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,680

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,519
dropping that right now so you know you

have to have the spirulina you have to

442
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:22,639
have the barley grass ready barley grass

443
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:26,000
juice powder

444
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:28,639
not barley grass

445
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,680
barley grass

446
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,440
won't do the trick it has to be the

447
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,480
juice powder

448
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:39,120
that's what travels beyond

449
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,600
and into the bloodstream to the brain

450
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,360
here's how it works if you do barley

451
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,000
grass

452
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:49,759
you're not going to get the barley grass

453
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,320
to the brain it's 99 of it's gonna stay

454
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:57,120
in the intestinal tract you have to get

455
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:59,040
the barley grass juice powder

456
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,839
very important

457
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,839
all right spirulina it's another one

458
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,199
right there

459
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:08,720
spirulina critical

460
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:11,280

that's important to know it's the dolls

526
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,120
kelp doesn't do that

527
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,559
i wish kelp did

528
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,720
but it doesn't

529
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,960
so it's and it this is incredible for

530
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,720
when dolls is hard to find because if

531
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,280

little bit

534
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,640
right but sometimes this is hard to find

535
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,480
so then

536
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,720

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,240
thank you for sharing that very much

544
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:19,760
so we got the dolls

545
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,200
right the energy dolls we got the

546
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,280
spirulina

547
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,880
memory spirulina we got the barley grass

548
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,120
cheese powder

549
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,960
these are the highest quality levels of

550
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,400
this if you can find if you can't find

551
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,960
this stuff and you use some other barley

552
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,440
grass make sure it's a juice powder

553
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,440
right the prevention realm good to see

554
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,840
you love how gentle but powerful this

555
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,480
cleanses that's the key that's the key

556

right there so

557
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:48,559
one of the reasons why the cleanse works

558
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:51,679
is because it's powerful

559
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:55,039
another reason why it works is because

560
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:57,760
it's gentle

561
00:20:55,039 --> 00:21:00,240
it makes it so you can do it it makes it

562
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:03,280
so children can do it it makes it so we

563
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,080
can get metals out right

564
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,600
so

565
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:10,720
five of these ingredients work together

566
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,200
synergetically synergistically they work

567
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,760
together

568
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:16,080
systematically

569
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:18,720
to get the metals out of the brain and

570
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,559
brainstem and neurons and out of the

571
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,240
liver and out of the organs and out of

572
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:24,640
your endocrine glands and out of your

573
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:27,360
thyroid and out of your body and that's

574
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:30,799
how people get better and move forward

575
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,000
which is so important right there

576
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,520
so we're talking about the wild

577
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,880
blueberries that's one thing you got to

578
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,640
have the wild blueberries these are the

579
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,720
frozen wild blueberries but do you do

580
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,159
the best you can if you don't have this

581
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,919
did you try to get a wild blueberry

582
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,919
powder if you don't have that try to get

583
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,440
the wild blueberry juice but getting or

584
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,960
if you don't have any wild blueberry

585
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,600
throw some blackberries in there it

586
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,600
won't do the same but it helps the good

587
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,919
news is you have the other ingredients

588
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,000
you have the dolls right and you have

589
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,200
these other things okay

590
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,360
here's the other thing you can start

591
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,640
with a small amount of the smoothie so

592
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:05,440
you can start with a smaller amount of

593
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:08,159
the heavy metal detox smoothie you guys

594
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,520
you can start with with a small

595
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:12,159
amount

596
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:15,600
right so when you make your smoothie you

597
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,960
can do a smaller one if you're sensitive

598
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,799
if you're somebody who's sensitive you

599
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,400
do a smaller one

600
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,320
it's incredible because it's for

601
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,760
sensitive people to begin with because

602
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,679
people are sensitive because they have

603
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,240
all these metals to begin with their

604
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:30,480
nerves are all jacked up that's what's

605
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,400
happening so people are walking around

606
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,000
their nerves are all jacked up is what's

607
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,360
happening right

608
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,280
and

609
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,799
they got the personalization the anxiety

610
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,120
they got the depression people got

611
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:42,400
schizophrenia they got bipolar they got

612
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,480
mania

613
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,400
or somebody's just like

614
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,440
when they're up they're like manic

615
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,360
they're manic and manic and manic a lot

616
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,720
of people just have anxiety and they'll

617
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,400
have a panic

618
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,640
and they'll have all of that to the

619
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,480
panic and it feels like it feels like

620
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,840
they're just all over the place all

621
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,000
through their bodies so that's a whole

622
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,520
nother thing right there that people go

623
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,400
through

624
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,559
right

625
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,559
so

626
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:10,159
i'm making some room over here

627
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:14,960
power of compassion when i first started

628
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:18,320
medical medium i did exactly the same

629
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:20,159
mistake i used barley grass powder not

630
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,159
the juice powder thank you for letting

631
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,919
everybody know this is why i have to say

632
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,480
it over and over again this is why it's

633
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,640
a critical piece of this

634
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,600
it can't be the barley grass powder and

635
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:34,320
i'll tell you why barley grass powder

636
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:37,039
is scratchy

637
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,880
it scratches the lining of the

638
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:41,919
intestinal tract because it's a

639
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:44,159
dehydrated grass

640
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,679
this is a juice powder and it's not

641
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,159
scratchy

642
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:50,880
it dissolves quick absorbs fast

643
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:53,279
assimilates instantly it gets into your

644
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:56,000
bloodstream fast and it doesn't irritate

645
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:58,240
the lining of the intestinal tract

646
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
barley grass can make somebody go oh i

647
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,520
tried that medical medium smoothie

648
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,039
that's awful

649
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,960
wow

650
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:07,440
and then they tell somebody else online

651
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,159
like yeah don't do his stuff it bothered

652
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,279
me

653
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,960
and then someone else who had

654
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,720
schizophrenia that could have healed is

655
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,919
like okay i won't i'll listen to you and

656
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,240
then they got their and then their

657
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,840
schizo for the rest of their life

658
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,919
marjorie said

659
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,840
yep haven't had a panic attack since

660
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,200
starting medical medium on facebook

661
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,480
thank you marjorie for being here that's

662
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,240
so important

663
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,159
panic attacks

664
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,400
panic attacks

665
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,559
are brutal for so many people you go

666
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,880
numb your arms go dumb you feel like you

667
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,880
can't even leave to the next room you

668
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,720
feel like you're trapped

669
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,240
you can you know people pass out i

670
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,760
always tell people you pass out from a

671
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,799
panic attack you're gonna be okay

672
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:46,320
because you're gonna wake up and be okay

673
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:48,320
sue says i made the mistake with the

674
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,159
barley grass at first

675
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,559
still was healing with the other four

676
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,799
amazing because you were then when i got

677
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:56,720
the vimergy barley grass juice powder i

678
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:59,039
really started to heal because you

679
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:02,159
elevated it to that next level right on

680
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:03,840
sues right on uh youtube thank you

681
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,880
exactly did you get do you guys hear

682
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,559
that

683
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,880
it made that much of a difference so

684
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:10,880
when it's the vimergy one it takes it to

685
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,480
that next level

686
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,640
it really does

687
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,400
it does

688
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,080
what i love about the vimergy company is

689
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:21,440
they know

690
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:24,080
they understand people's sickness and

691
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,679
chronic illness and supplement companies

692
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,720
don't know

693
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:30,559
really or understand or can relate or

694
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,039
anything they don't have that they're

695
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:36,080
just like robots supplement companies

696
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:38,400
are robots they put out stuff that are

697
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,840
trendy to try to just get things sold

698
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,360
there's a difference when you're

699
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,120
creating things

700
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,880
to stop illness

701
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,480
that's an entirely different thing and

702
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,919
that's what the vimergy company does

703
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,720
that's why i stand behind their stuff

704
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:52,480
100 and i've become friends with them

705
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,400
all along the way because of what

706
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,919
they've done i try to become friends

707
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,760
with all the other supplement companies

708
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:59,760
but you know what they say to me we're

709
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:03,039
not taking our natural flavors out sorry

710
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:04,799
aw we don't want to talk to you anymore

711
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:07,120
and then another supplement come we'll

712
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:09,360
we'll talk aw stop telling us to take

713
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:11,760
your sip to take citric acid out of our

714
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,039
supplements go somewhere else i'll be

715
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,880
like fine i'm not going to recommend

716
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:17,120
your stuff that happens all the time

717
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,799
because they don't want to come clean

718
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,600
selena says

719
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:24,240
aw i have dulse flakes is the is the

720
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:27,039
right amount two tablespoons you can do

721
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,799
you can do whatever you feel but i would

722
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:30,880
personally i would go with you know one

723
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,640
tablespoon is what i would go with so if

724
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,039
that was me selena and i had the dull

725
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,880
flakes i would do one tablespoon

726
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:39,760
definitely and then there's a dulce

727
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,600
liquid if you ever get the dulce liquid

728
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,600
do two dropper falls of the dulce liquid

729
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:46,080
right there but it makes that much of a

730
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,840
difference i'm trying to show you guys

731
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,600
how much it makes of a difference right

732
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,559
let me give you a rundown on spirulina

733
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,360
okay

734
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,440
right

735
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:56,240
so i used to recommend another spirulina

736
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,880
company because at the time it was all

737
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,960
that we had out there right

738
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:04,559
and then i found something in their

739
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:07,360
bottle of spirulina something that was

740
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:10,400
not a good thing i contacted the

741
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:12,880
spirulina company that i recommended to

742
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:15,279
all these people for quite a while for a

743
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,679
good few with a good few years right

744
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:20,080
contact them and said it's aw the

745

i'm showing you guys what you need cena

803
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:24,000
says cinnapang says how about bloating

804
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:26,960
after taking heavy metal detox for over

805
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,039
a half year so what it is is you got the

806
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,640
bloating right that's what's happening

807
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:32,320
it's not the heavy metal detox causing

808
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,919
the bloating you have the bloating so

809
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,360
you must have the bloating with other

810
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:37,120
things you're eating other foods you're

811
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,200
eating other things you're doing heavy

812
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:42,000
metal detox smoothie is there to pull

813
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:44,399
out the metals right that's its job to

814
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,360
pull out the metals and chemicals too

815
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:47,919
okay

816
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:50,960
but we still have to build up your hcls

817
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:52,960
if that was me i would want my ac my hcl

818
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:56,000
built up so i would be doing my celery

819
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:58,559
juice 32 ounces every day to attack that

820
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,279
bloating so i'd be doing my celery juice

821
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:03,200
right okay so the heavy metal detox

822
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:05,120
smoothie isn't the heavy metal detox

823
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,279
cleanse the heavy metal detox cleanse

824
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:10,080
right takes it to another level plus

825
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:12,320
there's bloating protocols

826
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,760
in here so that's another thing too

827
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,840
there's actually you've got to find your

828
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,600
true cause of your bloating find out

829
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:20,399
what it is learn what your bloating is

830
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:22,799
caused from is it from your hcl being

831
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:25,120
too low is it from your liver being

832
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:26,960
sluggish and stagnant what other things

833
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:29,360
do you have going on in your diet that

834
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:32,240
are actually bogging down your liver and

835
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:34,399
there's protocols in here for bloating

836
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,399
to look at and do and add to it the

837
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:39,520
heavy metal detox smoothie

838
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:43,120
is not meant to be this ant type loader

839
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:45,520
it is actually meant to pull metals out

840
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:48,559
so you get rid of all the heavy metal

841
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:51,120
conditions right anxiety depression

842
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:52,640
panic vitiligo eczema psoriasis

843
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:58,080
depersonalization

844
00:30:52,640 --> 00:31:00,480
mania bipolar ocd ptsd right it's it's

845
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,670
meant to get all that cleaned up and

846
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,440
fixed

847
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:05,600
[Music]

848
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:08,159
all right

849
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:10,960
let's talk let's talk shop

850
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:12,720
we're doing it how do we get metals

851
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,159
right well let's finish up we're talking

852
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,679
about the different things we need so we

853
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:17,760
talked about we need the barley grass

854
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:19,440
juice powder we need the spirulina we

855
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,679
need the wild blueberries i talked about

856
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,760
why it's critical to use the vimergy

857
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,440
brand if you can't use the vimergy brand

858
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,679
make sure you try to get a barley grass

859
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,240
juice powder somewhere and if you do

860
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:32,159
pick a spirulina i hope you don't pick

861
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,240
some of the bum companies out there so

862
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:35,760
do your best to try to get the right one

863
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,120
if you can

864
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,440
so

865
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:41,200
cilantro is something that's really

866
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,600
important

867
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,679
and we have the cilantro right here we

868
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:48,720
got a celery stick somewhere attached to

869
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:48,720
it there we go

870
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:55,200
so we got the cilantro

871
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:58,399
if you don't like the taste of cilantro

872
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:01,200
you got some metals sure you can love

873
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:03,679
cilantro and still have metals but i do

874
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:06,960
find when someone doesn't like the taste

875
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:10,240
of cilantro they have the metals more in

876
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:13,039
this region of their body

877
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:15,039
if someone likes the taste of cilantro

878
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:16,960
they may have metal somewhere else it

879
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:19,519
could be in their brain or their liver

880
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,039
or intestinal tract right it could be

881
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:25,039
there

882
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:27,440
okay so that's something to know

883
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:30,320
but if someone doesn't like the taste of

884
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:32,960
cilantro we're talking about metals

885
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:35,840
being somewhere near the hypoglossal

886
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,600
nerve okay the hyperglossal nerve in the

887
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,600
mouth that's important to know right

888
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:43,840
there so what i'm going to do is i'm

889
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,840
going to move this back over here

890
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,200
there we go

891
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,919
nice

892
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,120
so let's take a look

893
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:01,120
a lot of people go i don't like cilantro

894
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:02,399
i don't like the taste of cilantro

895
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,360
yucky

896
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:07,519
awful a lot of people do that cilantro

897
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,600
is terrible tastes like soap it tastes

898
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:12,000
like soap to me

899
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:15,039
that means you got your mercury close to

900
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,039
the hypoglossal nerve

901
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:20,080
that's what it means

902
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:23,120
you got you got your mercury

903
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:26,480
close to that nerve

904
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:27,919
and it's throwing off your taste buds

905
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,600
right there

906
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:32,960
that's what that means

907
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:35,279
so many people have metal in them

908
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,360

00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,200
it's loaded with toxic heavy metals

a whiff of metals going into our system

918
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:58,640
they vaporize in the cologne

919
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,320
toxic heavy metals that cologne

920
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,799

no one ever

963
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:43,200
is held accountable or responsible

964
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:45,200
for that person who listens and drinks

965
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,400
out of a copper thermos for the next

966
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,240
five years

967
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,400
and they lose their mind

968
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:53,200
from neurological symptoms

969
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,440
no one's responsible in the trend world

970
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:57,839
no one's responsible for alkaline

971
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:00,160
ionizer water machine poisoning

972
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:02,000
anybody who drinks out of the alkaline

973
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:04,400
ionizer water

974
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,040
machines will end up with neurological

975
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,000
problems and no one's held responsible

976
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,800
no

977
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,839
no

978
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,200
because the metal plates

979
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:15,040
flake and that metal that the

980
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,280
electricity hits inside the ionizer

981
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,240
water machines oxidizes and flakes the

982
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,920
metal

983
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,440
and they will go insane down the road

984
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,000
with heavy metal poisoning and

985
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:26,960
neurological problems

986
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,040
including tongue problems ear problems

987
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:32,000

988
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:33,440
from alkaline eyes on our water machine

i'm doctor stewart

1001
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:03,520
i'm doctor

try my fish oil because it's important

1003
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:09,440
and i have a lot of other doctors using

1004
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:11,200
fish oil too everybody try my fish oil

1005
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,440
but no one's held responsible for when

1006
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:15,599
this crap gets into the brain

1007
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:18,160
because it's loaded with methyl mercury

1008
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:19,760
homeopathic style inside fish oil i

1009
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,839
don't care whose fish oil is i don't

1010
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:24,320
care if a martian

1011
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:28,079
the planet mars comes down

1012
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:30,480
and says here's your fish oil from mars

1013
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:33,760
pure no mercury in mars

1014
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,760
it's still got mercury in it

1015
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,800
all right so here's how fish oil is made

1016
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,040
and processed

1017
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,040
right

1018
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,880
they don't use one type of fish unless

1019
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:49,839
it's something like a krill oil which is

1020
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:52,240
still loaded with toxic heavy metals

1021
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:55,440
they don't use one

1022
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:56,640
type of fish with your fish oil

1023
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:00,160
they use

1024
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:04,560
hundreds of fish hundreds of fish heads

1025
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:06,880

00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,560
this dummy's guts are about to fall out

1117
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:34,319
right here

1118
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:36,800
so they're about to pile out right

1119
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:38,800
so you got your vagus nerve you guys see

1120
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,160
this on tick-tock you guys okay over

1121
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,720
there on youtube

1122
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,240
okay you got your vagus nerves

1123
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,119
right

1124
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:48,560
so

1125
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:51,760
your vagus nerves

1126
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:54,000
it's come out of the brain stem

1127
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,599
and when they're inflamed

1128
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,839
when they're inflamed all right right

1129
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:57,839
there

1130
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:04,240
right the brain stem down in here when

1131
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:07,839
the nerves are inflamed

1132
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:10,079
okay anxiety starts

1133
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:13,040
now your brain stem can be slightly

1134
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:14,800
inflamed with mild inflammation

1135
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:16,640
and that will create an anxiety right

1136
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,920
there you might even get like heart

1137
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,680
racing

1138
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:23,280
because of the vagus nerves receiving

1139
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:23,280
information that's trailing down there

1140
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:27,119
all right

1141
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:29,599
so that's one way the brain stem being

1142
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:31,680
inflamed or the vagus nerves themselves

1143
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:35,280
can be inflamed

1144
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:35,280
toxic heavy metals

1145
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:40,720
can cling to the vagus nerves and the

1146
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,720
brain stem

1147
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,240
keep that in mind

1148
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:46,720
all right they can cling to the vagus

1149
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:49,119
nerve and the brain stem

1150
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:51,200
toxic heavy metals can also get into the

1151
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:53,119
brain itself

1152
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:55,839
and they when they get into the brain

1153
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:58,880
itself right

1154
00:42:55,839 --> 00:43:00,720
they can attach to neurons

1155
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:02,560
when toxic heavy metals attach to

1156
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:05,359
neurons

1157
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:09,599
they can short-circuit neurotransmitter

1158
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:13,680
chemicals and electrical impulses

1159
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:16,480
anxiety isn't just one size fits all

1160
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:19,280
anxiety your anxiety is different than

1161
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:21,119
anybody else's anxiety and your anxiety

1162
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,319
is different than anybody else's anxiety

1163
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:25,520
and your anxiety is different than

1164
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:27,760
anybody else's anxiety but metals play a

1165
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:29,599
role and this is very important

1166
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:32,000
everybody's anxiety is different you

1167
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:34,400
guys there's no anxiety disorder or

1168
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,280
anxiety problem that's the same in any

1169
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:39,280
one two three four person they're all

1170
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:41,119
unique and different

1171
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:44,880
that's why i like medical medium

1172
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:46,960
information it's to customize so you can

1173
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:49,119
you're going to have a different form of

1174
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:52,000
anxiety that means when you use the

1175
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:54,640
heavy metal detox smoothie

1176
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,319
it's geared to getting metals out of

1177
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:59,760
your vagus nerve if that's where they

1178
00:43:56,319 --> 00:44:02,079
are and causing your anxiety or if your

1179
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:04,400
metals are in your brain stem

1180
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:06,640
causing your anxiety

1181
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,640
right

1182
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:11,760
or if your metals are in your neurons

1183
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:14,640
inside your brain

1184
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:16,160
causing anxiety so if they're inside

1185
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:18,480
your brain

1186
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:20,000
medical medium heavy metal detox cleanse

1187
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,079
is geared

1188
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,400
for the person who has them inside their

1189
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:24,400
brain

1190
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:31,520
in the brain or on the brainstem

1191
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:33,440
or on the vagus nerves themselves

1192
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:36,079
how do they how does how does have

1193
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,599
having metals create this when you have

1194
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:39,119
metals in your brain your short

1195
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:40,800
circuiting neurotransmitters electrical

1196
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:44,079
impulses sending down signals down the

1197
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:45,760
vagus nerves that are causing that

1198
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:48,400
problem right

1199
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:49,440
that's one right there one way

1200
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,280
um

1201
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:53,040
eo fruits and vegetables says i suffer

1202
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,160
from panic attacks following six months

1203
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,760
of keto

1204
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:58,960
you're not the only one that suffer from

1205
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:00,960
panic attacks following months of keto

1206
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,880
it felt like i was in a tornado of my

1207
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,720
own thoughts and the room was spinning

1208
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,079
haven't had one since starting medical

1209
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:08,960
medium two years ago and i'll tell you

1210
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:10,880
why because the keto diet is not

1211
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,839
the keto diet is a one size fits all

1212
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,520
approach

1213
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:15,200
terrible approach

1214
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,960
that's a one size fits all what you'll

1215
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:19,119
notice is medical medium information was

1216
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,640
only customized is the only one out

1217
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:22,000
there that was customized for people

1218
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,760
with all their different problems and

1219
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,800
then so what happened was because of

1220
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:27,520
that

1221
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:29,280
the one size fits all groups like keto

1222
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,640
and everybody else they decided to you

1223
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,319
know attack medical mediums saying

1224
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:34,319
medical mediums one size fits all that's

1225
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:36,480
funny because medical medium is not

1226
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:37,200
and never was

1227
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,119
so

1228
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:41,280
medical medium is not just plant-based

1229
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:42,960
it's not just animal-based that proves

1230
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:46,480
it's not one-size-fits-all just all on

1231
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:48,240
its own right there

1232
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,800
all right let's get going here so what

1233
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:53,440
happens is your vagus nerve runs down

1234
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:55,200
and travels down through the body and it

1235
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,119
attaches itself to the stomach it

1236
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:59,520
attaches itself to the intestinal tract

1237
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:01,920
to the colon it attaches itself to all

1238
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:04,079
the abdom all the organs in the abdomen

1239
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:06,640
right especially it gets down here to

1240
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:08,359
the intestinal tract and colon

1241
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:11,040
so when that vagus nerve is

1242
00:46:08,359 --> 00:46:13,040
hyper-inflamed or partially inflamed or

1243
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:14,640
low-grade inflamed

1244
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:16,720
you're going to have mixed signals

1245
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:18,160
coming down and these mixed signals are

1246
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:19,520
going to come down and you're going to

1247
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:21,119
get panic you're going to feel like

1248
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:22,480
you're heart racing sometimes so let's

1249
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:24,400
take a look right here take a look at

1250
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,560
the heart

1251
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:29,280
toxic heavy metals inflame the vagus

1252
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:30,880
nerve or brain stem or brain creating

1253
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,640
heart palpitations right here could you

1254
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,560
guys check out the tic tac video i did

1255
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:36,800
heart palpitations

1256
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:38,960
after this live you guys have to check

1257
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:41,280
out the tick tock exclusive tick tock

1258
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:42,400
video i did on heart palpitations if you

1259
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:45,119
can

1260
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,720
it's really a great thing to do okay so

1261
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:48,560
if you if you can do that that would be

1262
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,760
amazing so you guys on tik tok check it

1263
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:51,520
out when you can you guys probably

1264
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,359
already know about it anybody who's not

1265
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:56,400
on tick tock check it out later an

1266
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:58,720
exclusive video so let's go now

1267
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:00,560
so as the vagus nerve travels down here

1268
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:02,800
okay as the vagus nerve travels down

1269
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,800
here

1270
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:08,160
it's also sending messages to the heart

1271
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,160
giving you that heart palpitation of the

1272
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:12,480
heart racing so if you have panic part

1273
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:14,800
of that panic attack is your vagus nerve

1274
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,560
creating that heart to do this

1275
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:18,800
that's part of the panic attack right

1276
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,800
there

1277
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:24,400
that's what happens heart palpitations

1278
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:26,800
the same way it can send a signal to

1279
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:28,400
the heart that flips the heart like a

1280
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:30,400
fish

1281
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,680
like this

1282
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,040
and then you feel your heart go in your

1283
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,319
throat you're like oh my god what was

1284
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,160
that

1285
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:37,599
and it almost makes you cough you have a

1286
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,800
heart palpitation that could be the top

1287
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:40,720
of the heart because the vagus nerve

1288
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,800
sending a master chop power and you're

1289
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:44,480
and you almost choke

1290
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:46,319
because that heart palpitation feels

1291
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:48,079
like it went into your upper chest up

1292
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:49,280
into your throat

1293
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:52,559
right

1294
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:54,400
so you can have heart palpitations and

1295
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:56,800
you can have

1296
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:58,000
panic or just anxiety here's another

1297
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,440
thing with the vagus nerve right here

1298
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,960
with anxiety so when you have toxic

1299
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:02,160
heavy metals if you guys just rolled in

1300
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,280
we're doing the heavy metal detox

1301
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,720
cleanse starting tomorrow this is the

1302
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,319
preliminary we're talking about what we

1303
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:07,760
need all the stuff we need and

1304
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:08,720
everything stick around so you can hear

1305
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,839
that again

1306
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,359
but right now we're talking about the

1307
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:13,520
vegas they're being affected by toxic

1308
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:16,640
heavy metals so when we have toxic heavy

1309
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:17,440
metals like mercury and copper

1310
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,800
right

1311
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,960
and mercury

1312
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:23,520
see the fish oil mercury

1313
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:25,839
when we have toxic heavy metals

1314
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:28,400
that come from colognes and perfumes

1315
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:31,040
toxic heavy metals in our brain and

1316
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:33,280
nervous system our vagus nerve our brain

1317
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:36,319
and our vagus nerve we get mixed

1318
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:39,200
messages right down here to the heart

1319
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:41,280
causing heart to be afib mysterious afib

1320
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:44,160
mysterious tachycardia

1321
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:46,079
mysterious ectopic heartbeat mysterious

1322
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:47,920
heart palpitations

1323
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:50,079
right then we get other things that are

1324
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:51,280
mysterious we get anxiety with tightness

1325
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:52,640
of the chest how many of you guys have

1326
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,559
ever experienced tightness to the chest

1327
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:55,760
with your anxiety

1328
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:58,079
have you guys ever experienced that

1329
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,960
tightness of the chest

1330
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:01,040
right

1331
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,720
it takes metals

1332
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:04,559
it takes metals

1333
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:06,240
in your system

1334
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:08,720
for that to happen so many of you guys

1335
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:11,119
had that tightness of the chest right

1336
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:13,520
so that's the vagus nerve

1337
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:15,359
being slightly inflamed creating that

1338
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:17,040
tightness of the chest it's the vagus

1339
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:18,160
nerve being slightly inflamed creating

1340
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,839
tightness at the chest i'm letting you

get you can't you feel like you can't

1356
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:54,960
get air into your lungs so what happens

1357
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:56,319
is the vagus nerves because of toxic

1358
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,160
heavy metals

1359
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:59,680
the vagus nerves when they get inflamed

1360
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:01,280
you guys

1361
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:03,440
you feel like you can't get that deep

1362
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,480
breath in i suffer from anxiety for 54

1363
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,559
years

1364
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:08,160
gina says you feel like you can't get

1365
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:10,400
that deep breath that you feel like you

1366
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:12,559
can't breathe you feel like you can't

1367
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:14,480
take in that air and it could even get

1368
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:16,319
you in the throat elizabeth

1369
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:18,400

1371
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:22,640
be open to heart it said yes

be open-hearted good to see you by the

00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:25,760
way you leave comments on youtube but i

always read them so it's ah it always

1375
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:29,119
makes sense

1376
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:31,040
and so we get the tightness of the chest

1377
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:34,800
and all that yvonne says anyone here

1378
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:34,800

1379
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:40,960
that made me laugh don't make comments

1380
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:44,079
that are negative he has saved my life

1381
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:47,280
in many other people's lives

1382
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:50,160
i went to 13 doctors and no one tested

1383
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:52,400
me for ebv most doctors know nothing

1384
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:54,000
about chronic illness he's the only one

1385
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:56,720
who teaches the truth about chronic

1386
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,920
illness and it and its causes because he

1387
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,960
cares

1388
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,839
he makes

1389
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:04,000
zero money when we are sick

1390
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:06,480
but guess who does make money when we

1391
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,000
are sick think about it right i'm

1392
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,680

you went through a lot

1410
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:44,559
you went through a lot

1411
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:46,960
and you can't measure that

1412
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:50,480
any you any of what you guys have gone

1413
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:52,720
through any of it it's not measurable it

1414
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:54,000
goes into the spiritual realm

1415
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,839
you guys have been through hell and back

1416
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,160
many of you it goes into the spiritual

1417
00:51:55,839 --> 00:52:00,000
realm you guys are spiritual powers now

1418
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:05,040
because you because what it is is you

1419
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:06,160
can't measure that what you went through

1420
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:09,200
only

1421
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:11,520
from above that's who sees that okay god

1422
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,720
sees that the angels say that christ

1423
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:14,400
sees that

1424
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,760
the light sees that the creator sees it

1425
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:18,400
whatever anybody believes is what i'm

1426
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:20,240
saying sees that of what you went

1427
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:22,880
through

1428
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:25,119
can't be measured down here

1429
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:26,880
julie says i just got a new couch and

1430
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:28,319
because of all the chemicals sprayed on

1431
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,920
it that's rough

1432
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:31,599
i get this tightness in my chest and

1433
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:33,119
shortness of breath is this the same

1434
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:35,040
thing yes so what it is julie is what it

1435
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:37,200
means is you got the hypersensitivities

1436
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:40,640
right so what i tell a lot of people and

1437
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:42,480
and and a family member who a family

1438
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:44,559
member of mine came to me like back a

1439
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:46,400
few years ago and said look i need these

1440
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:48,880
medals out i'm ready and i'm like all

1441
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:52,240
right let's do it

1442
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:53,760
and what happened was right before that

1443
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:55,280
they had the metals in their system and

1444
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:57,440
it takes time to get the metals out and

1445
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:58,720
the metals are also in chemicals that

1446
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:01,040
are on like new couches and all that

1447
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:03,440
stuff and what happens is it triggers

1448
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:05,200
our vagus nerves so when we breathe in

1449
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,880
that chemical there's certain chemicals

1450
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:08,640
they spray on new furniture not all new

1451
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:10,400
furniture but a lot of furniture they

1452
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:12,400
spray these new chemicals on there and

1453
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:14,160
the new chemicals they

1454
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,359
they trick out our vagus nerves because

1455
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,720
their vagus nerves are already

1456
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:18,160
hypersensitive from everything we've

1457
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:19,520
been through including metals and all

1458
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,880
that

1459
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:23,200
it really is

1460
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:24,559
that's really what people go through so

1461
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,920
we're talking about metals we're talking

1462
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:27,200
about why to get them out we're talking

1463
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:29,280
about how we get them we're talking

1464
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:30,960
about the vagus nerves phrenic nerves is

1465
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:33,680
another one too vagus nerve is my

1466
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:35,359
problem patty says okay

1467
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:37,119
yeah yeah i mean

1468
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:39,200
and the thing is is phrenic nerves is

1469
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:40,640
another thing too okay phrenic nerves

1470
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:42,480
run through the chest they come off the

1471
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:44,160
spine area they run through the chest

1472
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,599
they run they run off the spine up here

1473
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:47,760
they run down

1474
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:50,240
phrenic nerves get inflamed olivia

1475
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:52,079
westman says what should we take for

1476
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:53,599
heart palpitation so we have the heart

1477
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:54,400
right here

1478
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:55,520
okay

1479
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:58,559
so

1480
00:53:55,520 --> 00:54:00,800
heart palpitations that are mysterious

1481
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:03,119
that are derived from neurological

1482
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:05,440
they're mysterious they're derived from

1483
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:06,880
messages coming

1484
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:09,599
from

1485
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:10,960
the brain or brain stem

1486
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:13,440
right

1487
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:15,359
or vagus nerve so these are messages

1488
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,720
getting skewed along the way before they

1489
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:18,559
get to the heart and then when they get

1490
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:21,119
to the heart

1491
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:21,119
they do this

1492
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,359
right here

1493
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:25,440
see

1494
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:27,599
it's like morse code

1495
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:30,000
all of a sudden an electrical impulse is

1496
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:31,200
going to the heart in a different way

1497
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,480
and so now we're getting the hard part

1498
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,760
so here you are you're going along

1499
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,960
you're going along you're going along

1500
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:37,200
and then

1501
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:39,119
what the heck what

1502
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:41,599
what the heck was that

1503
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:43,280

1504
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:44,960

it's my first set of heart palpitations

1506
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:47,440
and every time someone gets the first

1507
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:49,440
set of heart palpitations they run to

1508
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:50,880
the emergency room and they get all the

1509
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:52,559
tests and everything's checked out well

1510
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:54,079

right

1541
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:59,440
it's not one size fits all medical

1542
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:00,960
medium information is far from that it's

1543
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:03,760
the opposite

1544
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:05,839
and that's why so many people heal

1545
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:07,359
so many people heal from the medical

1546
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:10,559
medium cleanses like the heavy metal

1547
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:13,520
detox cleanse because it's customized

1548
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:15,359
for all these different conditions

1549
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:16,880
so what happens when panic attacks turn

1550
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:18,559
into fatigue

1551
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:20,799
if you check out medical medium cleanse

1552
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:22,799
to heal you can learn what i always tell

1553
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:24,880

1554
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:26,880

validated and it has to be understood so

01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:16,799
one thing

1685
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:18,240
about the metals
