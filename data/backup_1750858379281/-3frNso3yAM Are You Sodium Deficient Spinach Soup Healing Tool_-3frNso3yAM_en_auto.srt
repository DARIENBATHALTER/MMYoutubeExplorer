to make it and I'm going to make it I

8
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:19,039
got the spinach here I got the celery

9
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,000
here I got the tomatoes here got a

10
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,400
little basil got some oranges I'm really

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,160
pumped up about this and we're talking

12
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,679
about low sodium low sodium sodium

13
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:30,720
crisis or somebody with low sodium

14
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:33,280
somebody not able to retain sodium or

15
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,440
somebody that's actually maybe doing it

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,920
wrong and they don't know it but they

17
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,440
need to do different things to keep

18
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,800
their sodium up to par um hey let's go

19
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:46,120
into that right now too so and I have

20
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:46,120
some tea right here Lem bomb

21
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,840
tea nice good to see you guys coming on

22
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,199
here we're going to be talking about a

23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,160
lot about sodium how much sodium are you

24
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:58,760
on are you doing sodium are you adding

25
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,000
sodium to all your stuff so what you

26
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,280
hear in the health movement

27
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,559
is you'll hear and you've been hearing

28
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,119
this probably for years I mean it's

29
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:08,600
going on I think 20 years maybe 30 years

30
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:11,000
as you'll hear out there take salt and

31
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,799
put it in some water give yourself some

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,560
salt water you know take a pinch of salt

33
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,520
or a bunch of salt and throw it in take

34
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,600
a teaspoon of salt or more and throw it

35
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:20,400
in your water you have to have salt in

36
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,479
there do the rock salt do the sea salt

37
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,320
do the high quality salt and so that's

38
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:27,079
been a big one in the health movement

39
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,759
it's ridiculous it's actually not even

40
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:31,960
correct for somebody what they need and

41
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,840
it it's one of those snake oil things

42
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:36,119
that are out there and it's just being

43
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,560
passed around there's no science to it

44
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:40,600
there's no real science to it it's just

45
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,240
one of those things where it was a good

46
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:45,159
idea hey put salt in your water that

47
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,960
will keep you stable and so forth but

48
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:48,960
really it doesn't it dehydrates you

49
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,040
further doesn't allow the water that

50
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,200
you're drinking to work for you and it's

51
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,000
not the right kind of salt so let's talk

52
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,159
about different salts as we're doing

53
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,439
this right now and you guys if you just

54
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,479
came on here I'm making the healing

55
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,479
spinach soup the medical medium spinach

56
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:01,840
soup

57
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,320
I'm really excited about it it's a

58
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,680
powerful healing tool I mean if you use

59
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,720
the spinach soup correctly meaning you

60
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:11,040
make it and you consume it you make it

61
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,319
right and you consume it on a regular

62
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:17,200
basis what it can do for you how it can

63
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:19,840
just change fibromyalgia ra you know

64
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,120
eczema psoriasis chronic fatigue

65
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,920
syndrome Lyme disease like what it can

66
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:27,000
do for you is a miracle multiple

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:30,519
sclerosis you can literally live on that

68
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,720
spinach soup every single day

69
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:34,440
and clear up problems like neurological

70
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:38,000
problems aches and pains tingles and

71
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,760
numbness stiffness of the neck um knee

72
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,080
problems inflammation all through the

73
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,319
body I mean how it can help is just a

74
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,959
miracle so we're going to go into that

75
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:49,400
but we're talking about sodium and

76
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,000
interesting spinach has a lot of sodium

77
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,720
in it spinach does but there's a

78
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,120
difference between that and throwing

79
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,440
sodium in water so let's talk about the

80
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,440
two different sodiums out there so

81
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,120
there's commercialized sodium out there

82
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,599
that kind that's thrown in junk food

83
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:07,480
processed food fried greasy food out

84
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:09,159
there it's the commercialized salt it's

85
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,480
also the salt that you see in the

86
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:14,480
grocery stores that's not like Himalayan

87
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,879
rock salt it's not like sea salt or

88
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,280
something like that or a really high

89
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:20,760
quality sea salt instead it's the

90
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:23,720
commercialized junk salt it's what I

91
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,440
have called All These Years road salt

92
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:30,000
it's in all the food it's in all the

93
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:35,080
restaurants restaurants don't buy 50 $60

94
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:39,760
bags of salt like a $60 bag of black

95
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:41,599
salt a $60 bag of you know rock salt

96
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,280
people don't do that in restaurants and

97
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:48,120
restaurants out there worldwide it's

98
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:50,720
just salt it comes in a 50 lb Satchel 50

99
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:53,280
lb bag and that's what goes and it's you

100
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,000
know it's all about how you can make

101
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,720
that meal as cheap as possible for the

102
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,040
bottom line that's what restaurants do

103
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:03,599
out there I mean that is the reality

104
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:05,760
that's life out there on planet Earth so

105
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,760
what happens is people get road salt

106
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,640
they get

107
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:14,159
commercialized Den nutrient ised salt

108
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:16,840
that's what they do and it's all about

109
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:19,120
you know getting that in all the food to

110
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:21,160
make people like it and make them crave

111
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,639
it that's the key and then there's

112
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:28,160
hidden salts hidden

113
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:30,199
msgs yeast extracts which are msgs and

114
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,479
you'll notice yeast extracted is in

115
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:35,759
everything these days now I mean it's

116
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:39,120
gone from here to here like it used to

117
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,960
be just in one item here one item there

118
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,360
in the past now it's in everything

119
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:47,880
organic foods packaged Foods soups

120
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:52,440
sauces you see yeast extract everywhere

121
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:55,840
what that is is MSG toxic MSG and it's

122
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:59,840
thrown in everything toxic MSG with

123
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:01,120
added road salt commercialized sodium

124
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,919
other different

125
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:08,639
chemicals thrown in tagged and named as

126
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:10,360
yeast extract thrown in everything out

127
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,360
there that you see now you'll see it in

128
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:15,360
sauces and soups like I said you'll see

129
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,720
it in packaged Foods canned stuff you'll

130
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,319
just see yeast extract everywhere out

131
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,039
there so you got to look out for that

132
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:26,080
the yeast extract is not good but it's

133
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:28,240
another form of bad sodium another form

134
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,319
of bad sodium really important to know

135
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,919
so I'm trying to cruise through this

136
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:33,360
information cuz I got a lot of

137
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:35,360
information and I'm trying to like I'm

138
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,479
trying to spill it out the best I could

139
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,639
for you guys so let's hit it so you got

140
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:41,960
the commercialized rock salt I mean not

141
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:45,080
rock salt commercialized road salt you

142
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:47,120
have that called it that for years it

143
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:49,639
doesn't have the nutrients it doesn't

144
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,960
have the profile in it and then you have

145
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:54,360
other salts bleached salt yeah they

146
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,639
actually have

147
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,319
bleached sodium if you can imagine not

148
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:01,280
only just commercialized it but they

149
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:04,440
bleach bleached it that's a whole

150
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,919
another game too now that's not as

151
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:11,800
popular anymore but back in the 60s and'

152
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:16,919
7s salts were bleached so we've learned

153
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:19,319
to acclimate and learn to like salt even

154
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:22,120
if we don't realize it we've learned to

155
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:24,880
like it we become addicted so we're a

156
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:27,720
society today that is addicted to Salt

157
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:31,039
now a lot of coffee shops put salt in

158
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:34,599
the water in the machines so it becomes

159
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:36,880
coffee Salt Water coffee they don't

160
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:40,319
advertise it you don't know it nobody

161
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,639
knows it but sodium is in a lot of

162
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:45,000
coffees out there it's in a lot of

163
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,919
coffee shops it's in a lot of um coffee

164
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,400
chains not in everyone not in everywhere

165
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,400
so you might know somebody be like they

166
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,400
don't put sodium in their coffee there

167
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,840
you go medical medium but let me tell

168
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,720
you a lot of them do and there's a

169
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,440
reason for that they want it salt they

170
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,680
want their coffee salty and then when

171
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,599
you add your sugar and your milks or

172
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,960
whatever you add your soy whatever it is

173
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:10,479
that's people like in their coffee you

174
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:12,720
add that in and then that plus the

175
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,160
sodium that's additionally added you

176
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,919
have yourself a coffee that becomes

177
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,520
really addictive and so you keep on

178
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:20,319
going to that coffee chain to that

179
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,080
coffee place and you can do that you

180
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,560
know for a lifetime I mean you can go to

181
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,240
the same coffee chain for a lifetime

182
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:29,000
because of it and people say I like that

183
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:30,919
coffee so it's the sodium in that you

184
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,560
know in that coffee you're drinking

185
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:36,240
that's really kind of makes it really

186
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,919
kick in for a double addiction so not

187
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,520
only do you have the caffeine addiction

188
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:42,479
right there but you have the sodium and

189
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,599
the caffeine combined surprise surprise

190
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:49,800
surprise nobody knew that

191
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:52,120
ha but yes it's true so it's sodium

192
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:55,400
thrown in everybody's coffee that they

193
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:57,120
buy at the coffee chains uh-huh so

194
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,919
there's that one so let's go into the M

195
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,599
MSG a little bit too okay yeast extract

196
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:04,639
is being thrown in

197
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:07,199
everything because it's another cheat

198
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:10,159
way of getting sodium in there so you

199
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,879
actually have a burst of flavor you can

200
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:14,159
look at the package the package of the

201
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:16,319
food the package of the can okay and

202
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:19,360
you'll see a certain amount of sodium

203
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:22,759
but yet it tastes so good it tastes so

204
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:26,120
salty why why why a lot of times yeast

205
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:28,479
extract is thrown in there but they

206
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,680
don't add it they don't meaning they

207
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,360
don't add that Sal salt level they don't

208
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:37,719
put it to the ingredient list you see

209
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:41,039
how it works 300 mg 300 mg of sodium one

210
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:45,120
gram of Mill one gram of sodium two gram

211
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:48,480
of sodium but yeast extract really

212
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,240
potent form of sodium takes it to now Bo

213
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,720
off the charts so there's a lot of

214
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,360
packaged food and a lot of canned food

215
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,000
and stuff even healthy stuff I'm talking

216
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,600
about like organic or healthy stuff or

217
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,800
all natural whatever you want to call it

218
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,480
organic this that non GMO and you're

219
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,200
like oh these these chips are really

220
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,360
good this is really oh this is my

221
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,920
favorite chip right here yeah oh let me

222
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,399
look at the sodium honey we better look

223
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,680
at the sodium are you getting too much

224
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:11,720
sodium in you and it's like yeah it says

225
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,839
300 milligrams that's about pretty much

226
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:16,480
the level I see another whatever you

227
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,640
know and then but it tastes so good

228
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,720
because the yeast extract is a whole

229
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,920
another level of sodium that they are

230
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,640
cheating people and people don't

231
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:28,760
understand this and that's the thing you

232
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:30,399
know like um these are hidden things

233
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,120
that no one's talking about instead

234
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,959
they're talking about other things

235
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,680
medical medium brought to town over the

236
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:37,279
years talking about the fragrances now

237
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,920
they're talking about the citric acid

238
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,640
now CU a medical medium they're talking

239
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,360
about right they're talking about so

240
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,000
many different things they're talking

241
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:48,440
about the natural flavors now

242
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,800
but yeast extract that's a whole another

243
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,519
one so I want to get that out there

244
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,160
because people need to look out because

245
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:56,600
it's rocket it it's taken off and I want

246
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,200
people to look out for their health and

247
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:01,680
their well-being and that yeast extract

248
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:04,760
is is toxic it's toxic not just because

249
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,240
of the MSG which is one reason why it's

250
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,519
toxic I mean they're actually selling

251
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,880
MSG more than ever before now people are

252
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:13,800
sprinkling that stuff looks like white

253
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:16,279
asbest they're just sprinkling that

254
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,399
stuff on everything you know MSG people

255
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:20,519
are buying MSG MSG is good for you now

256
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,200
it's like absurd it's insane but that's

257
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:24,560
what I mean how do you heal chronic

258
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:27,240
illness when so much is happening out

259
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,800
there like this so so let's get into it

260
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,720
a little bit more in the sod world the

261
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:34,200
yeast extract is a hidden sodium right

262
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:36,880
there you got to look out MSG natural

263
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:40,200
flavor hidden sodium in a lot of

264
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:44,040
situations natural and organic flavoring

265
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:46,839
right sodium it's another level of it

266
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:48,600
MSG another level of it and then it

267
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:51,279
doesn't have to go on the package so you

268
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,959
don't see it on the package instead but

269
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:55,639
it's in there and you taste it and you

270
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:58,200
become like a sodium demon like it takes

271
00:10:55,639 --> 00:11:02,360
over you that's like a literally an

272
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:04,760
addiction and you know people have to

273
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,480
deal with that I'm going to have a

274
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,120
little sip of Lem mom tea and then I'm

275
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,240
going to continue if you guys are okay

276
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:13,600
damn so addictive right Kim

277
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,600
exactly all

278
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,399
right let's

279
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,200
go talk about sodium deficiencies in

280
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:23,000
people like they end up going to a

281
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:26,800
hospital and they get their blood tested

282
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,120
they're sodium levels are down and first

283
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,320
of all there's a couple things to

284
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,040
understand a lot of people go to thep

285
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,800
hospital it's not because of a sodium

286
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,959
deficiency but they don't know why the

287
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,399
person's really struggling they don't

288
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,160
know why the person ended up there with

289
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,920
a fainting spell or whatever it is they

290
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,360
don't know why the person ends up um

291
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,959
they're not sure what's going on the

292
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,160
person goes to the hospital not sure

293
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:46,560
they having a heart attack they having a

294
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,160
stroke what's wrong with them did they

295
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,279
faint are they dehydrated right all

296
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,800
these things that have to be checked out

297
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:53,959
all the boxes have to be checked when

298
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,519
people go to the hospital

299
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:58,240
so what happens to a lot of people that

300
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:00,320
get food poisoning or they get sick

301
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,360
their sodium level strong drop their

302
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,839
sodium levels drop and depending on what

303
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,680
time of day and what time of night and

304
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,360
so forth depending on what kind of

305
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,160
stress they're under how hydrated they

306
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,160
are depending on how much water they

307
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:15,880
consumed if they're consuming too much

308
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:18,560
water your sodium could drop if they're

309
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:20,040
consuming too much water and they're not

310
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,519
consuming enough like coconut water

311
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,120
they're not having spinach soup they're

312
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,920
not having enough celery juice maybe

313
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,120
they're only doing 8 O 16 ounces of

314
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:30,720
celery juice but it's not enough for

315
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:33,000
what they might need but a lot of people

316
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,000
out there just in the conventional world

317
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,639
alone end up at the hospital with low

318
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,160
sodium and a lot of people end up in the

319
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,480
hospital because they've had a stomach

320
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,720
flu stomach bug or a flu or they don't

321
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,680
feel good or covid or something and they

322
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:50,399
they end up in the oh I said the word

323
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,480
we'll see what happens they end up in

324
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,560
the hospital and they do all these tests

325
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,199
they're like what's wrong with these

326
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:57,199
people and they find that their sodium

327
00:12:55,199 --> 00:13:00,360
might be low in that

328
00:12:57,199 --> 00:13:01,800
moment and um so they instantly go well

329
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:04,360
okay we got to hook you up with a salt

330
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:06,440
bag you got to get an IV bag got to get

331
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,480
IV and you get the you know the the the

332
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:10,320
salt bag is what they do they hook you

333
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,079
up they bring your sodium levels up

334
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,360
they're like okay we're we're good we

335
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:19,639
brought your sodium levels up but people

336
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:22,440
don't realize that one thing is sodium

337
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:24,920
levels that the conventional medical

338
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:28,600
model lives

339
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:33,160
on is sodium levels that are determined

340
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:37,279
from high salt diet for decades for

341
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:38,360
decades in the last 60 70 80 years they

342
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:43,639
been

343
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:47,920
determining that salt level that number

344
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:49,800
that they believe a normal human being

345
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:53,800
should sustain or

346
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:56,560
hold that number is too high to begin

347
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:59,519
with in the conventional model this is a

348
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:01,079
mistake made now you have to realize

349
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:04,040
they' come up with a lot of different

350
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:06,759
numbers throughout the decades one

351
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:10,600
number back in the late

352
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:13,000
40s mid to late 40s was B12 so they were

353
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:16,399
able to determine hey we can look at B12

354
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:19,920
in people and said the 1950s and 1960s

355
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:23,880
came along and it was all about B12 but

356
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:27,519
they determine somebody's number but

357
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:29,279
they don't realize in a B12 situation

358
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,680
how life has changed the amount of

359
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:35,399
stress people are under the amount of

360
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:38,199
pollution people are under the amount of

361
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:40,720
um radiation people experience would

362
00:14:38,199 --> 00:14:43,240
don't even realize it and you and here's

363
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,639
a side note right here don't mean to go

364
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,560
off a beaten path but you got to be

365
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:50,320
really careful when you're hiking on

366
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:52,839
trails and you're in in mountainous re M

367
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,360
mountainous regions and stuff like

368
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:58,040
that you got to be careful that you know

369
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:01,040
there's a lot of testing that is

370
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:03,199
occurred out there in different places

371
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,600
in different lands and there's a lot of

372
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:07,440
radioactive areas and you got to be

373
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:11,040
careful because people walk right into

374
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:13,720
radioactive areas and then you know 6

375
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:16,240

guys remember the podcast that I put out

459
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,039
it's about

460
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:57,000
damaging and problematic

461
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:59,760
supplements right one thing that has

462
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:04,640
happened with medical medium for quite

463
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:06,799
some time is I get attacked severely by

464
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,000
Massive money-making Industries now I

465
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,039
know a whole bunch of people are out

466
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,240
there they're on social and they're on X

467
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:15,039
and everything and they're trying to

468
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:16,960
solve all these different injustices and

469
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,440
health and everything else and I get it

470
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,960
and there's a lot of different problems

471
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:25,400
out there right but they're

472
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:27,640
overlooking like other big problems that

473
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,200
are causing serious serious problems

474
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,960
with people they're overlooking that

475
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,600
medical medium doesn't do that right I

476
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,720
already broke all the information out on

477
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:37,159
all the fragrances I already broke all

478
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,480
the information out on that original

479
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:40,159
information of when you go through the

480
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,480
airports and your luggage goes through

481
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:43,039
that you have to throw your luggage out

482
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:45,080
after a certain amount of time so you

483
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:47,080
don't have your baby or child just you

484
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:49,000
know you know standing next to that

485
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:50,840
luggage how it's loaded with radiation

486
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,880
I've already done so many things right

487
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:55,559
the blood draw I talked about the blood

488
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,840
draw crisis I've I've put out things

489
00:19:55,559 --> 00:20:00,000
that are actually brain bending

490
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,240
mindbending because it's just it's

491
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,400
incredible information to educate people

492
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,640
so they can heal information from s so

493
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:11,440
right or how what I've never known of so

494
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:14,200
much of it but what happened was I put

495
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,360
out the podcast just like other podcasts

496
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:19,720

497
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:23,600
people off and I put out the problematic

498
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:26,200
and damaging supplement podcast and you

499
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:29,600

00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:39,159
so bullets are flying I'm missing a lot

546
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:41,720
of episodes right now on Apple because

547
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:44,520
what happens is that medical medium for

548
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:47,559
years has been exposing like the real

549
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:51,120
evil right the real evil and

550
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:54,440
so because of that I'm always attacked

551
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:56,400
and just always all kinds of things like

552
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,840
that and you guys know this I mean I I

553
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,240
haven't talked too much about it over

554
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,039
the years but I took a little bit about

555
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:03,039
it

556
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:05,120
right like for instance this whole

557
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:07,159
sodium thing this will get me a bunch of

558
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:10,520
crap too just so you know you don't know

559
00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:13,440
it but the whole throw salt and water

560
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:15,840
thing is like a demon in the health

561
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,679
movement just see now every trainer

562
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:21,159
tells every single client throw salt in

563
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:23,120
water every single bodybuilder throws

564
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:25,360
salt in water every single health coach

565
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,559
throw salt and water every s single

566
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:30,679
naturopath chiropractor throws salt in

567
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:32,520
water that's a demon in the industry all

568
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:35,799
on its own like the crap I'm going to

569
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:37,840
get for the talking about how that's BS

570
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:40,440
to throw salt in water how it's

571
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:43,039
problematic and there's and all kinds of

572
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:44,559
things about it so but this is how it

573
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:46,520
works I mean you know and you get

574
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:49,240
original unique information from medical

575
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:51,159
medium all these years when nobody was

576
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:52,520
doing anything if you even go back five

577
00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:55,960
six seven years

578
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:57,440
ago right8 years ago 9 years ago and I

579
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,760
was publishing information that was

580
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,520
mind-blowing people didn't didn't even

581
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:03,880
know on any level so much of it's been

582
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,320
poach and stolen but the point is is

583
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,080
like what was everybody doing all they

584
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:09,279
had was some eat better books out there

585
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:11,400
it was like paleo books that was it just

586
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:13,279
you know some eat better books was about

587
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,640
it nobody knew anything about what

588
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:18,360
caused illness sickness symptoms

589
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:21,039
conditions true causes nobody uttered

590
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:24,720
heavy metals it was just um it was

591
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:26,559
ridiculous so so a lot of years I I put

592
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,080
up with a lot throughout the years you

593
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,120
guys have no idea how many times I've

594
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,240
been a

595
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:34,080
attacked and jabbed at and stabbed in

596
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,159
the back and everything else because

597
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,880
you're not supposed to do that you have

598
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:40,640
to behave and you have to just you have

599
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,640
to act like a Roman you have to be a

600
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:45,279
Roman you have to behave you can't look

601
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:48,200
out for the chronically ill God forbid

602
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:49,919
you do something that's really for the

603
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,880
chronically ill like really looking out

604
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,559
for them stopping them from from

605
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:56,000
saturating their intestinal tract and

606
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:58,159
colon with with uh colostrum and

607
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,240
charcoal stopping them from destroying

608
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:03,399
their teeth and bones with ACV like the

609
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:05,880
industries became monsters billion

610
00:25:03,399 --> 00:25:08,799
dollar in Industries so all it takes is

611
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:11,960
me putting something out there and they

612
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:15,720
still they still fear a little old me

613
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:17,039
it's ridiculous all right let's go into

614
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,600
sodium a little bit more and I'm going

615
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,760
to be making a spinach soup in a couple

616
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,360
minutes too which you see is this

617
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,159
beautiful pile of spinach right here

618
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,559
which I'm excited about I'm going to I'm

619
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:28,799
going to like show you tricks on like

620
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:30,760
making a really good spinach soup and it

621
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:32,320
it has to do too with good oranges and

622
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:34,039
good tomatoes but if you can't get good

623
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,919
oranges and good tomatoes we can do

624
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:38,159
something else but we can still make

625
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,799
that spinach soup and get it to taste

626
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:42,520
great in the whole

627
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:44,120
bit all right so let's hit a little bit

628
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:45,760
more in the sodium front there's all

629
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:49,880
these hidden sodiums and then there's

630
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:53,159
also techniques like putting sodium in

631
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:55,640
water and drinking that in that fashion

632
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:58,080
all the time it's not a great idea for a

633
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:00,840
lot of reasons um you're salty when you

634
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:04,760
put in water and you do it that way you

635
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:08,240
salt your organs you can actually get a

636
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:10,840
liver shut down or a case of

637
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:14,960
pancreatitis if you salt your water too

638
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:19,039
heavy just so you know you can put your

639
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:22,799
liver in a catastrophic situation if you

640
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:25,840
throw salt in your water yeah because

641
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:27,760
what happens is it's a Mainline to

642
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,679
putting salt into your liver it's

643
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:33,880
different if you made a tomato sauce and

644
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:35,399
Grandma threw some salt in it there's a

645
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,360
big difference and still that's not the

646
00:26:35,399 --> 00:26:39,000
best thing in the world because

647
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:41,240
everybody's so salted out but the point

648
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,679
is when you salt water and you're

649
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,480
somebody with chronic illness and you're

650
00:26:42,679 --> 00:26:46,279
just listening to some trainer out there

651
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,200
whatever it is and you see them online

652
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:51,120
you see them on social you see them on

653
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:53,880
YouTube and you see people everybody I

654
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,720
wasn't doing great until I put sodium

655
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:58,399
till I put salt in a glass of water

656
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:59,919
every single day and by the way go to to

657
00:26:58,399 --> 00:27:02,200
my website and you can buy my little

658
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:04,399
sodium packs at the same time whatever

659
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,799
it is the point is you can put your

660
00:27:04,399 --> 00:27:08,880
liver into

661
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:09,880
catastropic shut down you can go into

662
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,440
liver

663
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:16,080
failure if you overs salt water and you

664
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:19,200
don't have a meal around it you don't

665
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:20,520
have food to try to uptake that sodium

666
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,000
so you're somebody and you're working

667
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,679
out you didn't eat anything that day

668
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,159
you're intermittent fasting or something

669
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,320
you're doing anything like that and

670
00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:28,360
you're sitting there and you're just

671
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,000
throwing salt in water because somebody

672
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,559
told you it's a great idea and you're

673
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,919
training in the gym whatever it is and

674
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:35,159
you're running on your treadmill I don't

675
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:39,679
know taking a walk and you're just doing

676
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:44,960
that you're damaging your liver that's

677
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:44,960
what you're doing it's crazy all right

678
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,799
so yeah all right and I see somebody see

679
00:27:49,399 --> 00:27:52,519
somebody popping up some certain

680
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:55,320
influencer names and stuff like that

681
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:57,919
through there and I just saw one that

682
00:27:55,320 --> 00:28:00,399
has stolen all my liver information in

683
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:03,080
the just the last 3 4 years they they

684
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:04,600
read Liver Rescue one that you you know

685
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:06,600
think is a great person with a lot of

686
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,480
Integrity I just saw that and that

687
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:11,760
person I won't say their name that

688
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:13,200
person hijacked half of Liver Rescue and

689
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,120
then they were teaching it on their

690
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,720
YouTube channel and everything else it's

691
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,799
sickening and I just saw that person

692
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:21,640
like hey yeah this person yeah that

693
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:23,000
person took Liver Rescue information

694
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,480
it's stuff I got to live with but

695
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,880
whatever okay let's go back a little bit

696
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,799
more into the

697
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:32,440
sodium aspect of things it's key it's

698
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:35,279
key to have sodium come from places

699
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:37,760
where other trace minerals are attached

700
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:40,880
okay so that means if you use a good

701
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:43,320
sodium like sea salt right it's going to

702
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,240
have other trace minerals if it's a high

703
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:48,039
quality sea salt it's if it wasn't

704
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:51,399
stripped it's going to have some trace

705
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:53,559
minerals if you use a good rock salt or

706
00:28:51,399 --> 00:28:55,640
something like black salt it's going to

707
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:58,200
have those trace minerals there right

708
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:01,159
it's going to help but you still can't

709
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:02,480
abuse that and throw that in water and

710
00:29:01,159 --> 00:29:04,159
that's what you're doing you're just you

711
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:07,440
know throwing that water and sending it

712
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:09,840
down you still can go into liver shock

713
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,600
and shut your liver down for half a day

714
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,120
and if somebody's really sick you can

715
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,679
shut it down even longer and in

716
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:17,240
eventually into liver failure if you

717
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,799
don't know what you're doing and then

718
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,039
nobody knows what happened to you you go

719
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,880
to the hospital nobody knows what

720
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:24,440
happened to you so that happens to

721
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:28,399
people every day because of salt thrown

722
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:30,799
in water okay so let's keep that in mind

723
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:33,200
so even when you use these good salts

724
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:35,720
like a good Himalayan rock salt like a

725
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,760
good sea salt or a good black salt even

726
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:41,039
if you use that you got to be careful

727
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:44,559
and use them sparingly I'm not totally

728
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:46,559
against those salts I'm not you can use

729
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:48,880
a little bit even on medical medium

730
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:51,519
dishes but you got to be easy on the

731
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,559
sodium too you can't use a lot of that

732
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:56,200
you blow out your pallets you'll blow

733
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:58,760
out your your taste buds and you'll get

734
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,559
you'll acclimate to an addiction level

735
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,519
of

736
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:03,559
acclamation and you'll you'll then

737
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:05,360
you'll be like addicted to sodium and

738
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:07,240
you won't be able to live without it

739
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,559
when you're cooking or making your food

740
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:11,960
or making your raw dishes you won't be

741
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:13,559
able to live without it and what's going

742
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:16,080
to happen is you're going to lose your

743
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:18,320
taste to food you're going to lose your

744
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,760
taste to other things and you won't be

745
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:23,559
able to acclimate to those other things

746
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:26,320
you need like parsley being heavy on

747
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:27,640
parsley people are adverse to parsley

748
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,120
they don't want to be they don't want to

749
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:32,240
put lot of parsley in their food they

750
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:34,519
can't handle it so in including like a

751
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,279
lowfat dish or meal they don't want a

752
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:38,000
lot of parsley do you ever see anybody

753
00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:40,760
put a head of parsley on a piece of

754
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,320
salmon or a fish do you ever see that no

755
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:44,320
they won't it's like a Sprinkle of

756
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,360
parsley on dishes whether it's fish

757
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:48,039
whether it's meat whether it's something

758
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:50,480
else whether it's a steak whether it's

759
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:52,519
whatever the sprinkle of parsley right

760
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,679
somebody makes an egg omelette how much

761
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:56,760
parsley is going in an egg omelette

762
00:30:54,679 --> 00:30:58,840
probably none really it's probably just

763
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:00,159
a few like red pepper are put in there

764
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,840
and a couple of other things right

765
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:05,240
onions right in your in your egg

766
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:07,200
omelette the point is leafy greens are

767
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:09,480
not eaten enough and leafy herb greens

768
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:12,840
are not eaten enough they're not in

769
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:16,519
people's diets they're not there and we

770
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:18,320
need those because those contain sodium

771
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:21,279
but the right kind of

772
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:23,559
sodium and we also need those because we

773
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:25,279
need to acclimate to their flavors just

774
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:26,600
like cilantro how many of you guys now

775
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:28,760
have gotten a lot of metals out of your

776
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:30,720
system you've also acclimate it to the

777
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:32,679
flavor of cilantro you can only do so

778
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,279
much and now you can do a lot of it you

779
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:37,440
can only do a little bit now you can do

780
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:40,159
a lot of it right the cilantro it's this

781
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:42,240
is important to know and what happens is

782
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:44,080
that if you overs salt everything and

783
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,440
you're killing everything with salt

784
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,840
you're never going to acclimate the

785
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,279
foods that will be very important to you

786
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:52,360
when you consume them on the right

787
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:54,360
levels and the amount of you know of the

788
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:56,440
amounts you need and that calls for

789
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:58,519
spinach too if you're overs salting

790
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:01,399
everything you're never going to enjoy a

791
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:03,399
piece of spittage really truly enjoy it

792
00:32:01,399 --> 00:32:06,120
because that's where the sodium should

793
00:32:03,399 --> 00:32:09,240
come from same thing with celery as

794
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:11,679
well so when we're overs salting our

795
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:13,200
food with the good salt because that's

796
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,840
what you're thinking too some of you

797
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,279
guys because I know some of you guys are

798
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:19,080
like I use the best salt you know I use

799
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:22,200
I use the you know the best Himalayan

800
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:25,279
salt I use the black salt I use the you

801
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:27,480
know the the good sea salt from way up

802
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:31,000
North I understand those are the ones to

803
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:34,679
use but if you overdo it you're never

804
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:37,279
going to acclimate properly to the foods

805
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:39,960
that your body and your organs need and

806
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:44,159
want you're never going to be able to

807
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:48,240
acclimate to that spinach to that celery

808
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:50,000
to those herbs to Lemon you're not going

809
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,080
to be able to really acclimate in the

810
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,360
places you need to do so which are

811
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:57,600
critical for healing and here goes the

812
00:32:54,360 --> 00:33:00,000
next the next level the sodium in celery

813
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,200
is not the same sodium that they're

814
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,240
putting in all the food it's also not

815
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:07,639
the same sodium as the rock salt and the

816
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:10,039
good SE salt and the black salt is

817
00:33:07,639 --> 00:33:12,080
either it's they have a subgroup of

818
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:15,440
sodium in celery I've talked about that

819
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:19,200
sodium cluster salts okay it's not only

820
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:22,720
a macro macro sodium is in celery which

821
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:26,440
is the best sodium the best one not only

822
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:30,720
a macro but a micro sodium in celery so

823
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:33,080
the celery has a micro and macro sodium

824
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,600
in it very important to know there's a

825
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:39,039
reason for that right this is medicinal

826
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:43,120
sodium this is a different kind right

827
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:46,080
spinach spinach leaves spinach the plant

828
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:50,279
the stems have also sodium in there as

829
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:52,840
well now the sodium in spinach is bound

830
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:55,559
so what the difference is it's bound to

831
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:58,440
other minerals they won't

832
00:33:55,559 --> 00:34:00,559
separate they won't separate

833
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:02,639
so what happens is when you take a rock

834
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:04,840
salt Himalayan rock salt when you take a

835
00:34:02,639 --> 00:34:07,799
sea salt and you take black

836
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:10,879
salt black Salt's a little different I

837
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:14,520
like it I like it better in many ways if

838
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:18,440
you take the Himalayan salt and the sea

839
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:23,440
salt and you throw it in water the trace

840
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:28,119
minerals don't stay bound they

841
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:30,679
separate and they lose their viscosity

842
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:33,119
so this is important to know when you

843
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:35,079
have sodium coming out of spinach it's

844
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:38,000
why it's one of the reasons it's so

845
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:41,599
healing when you have sodium out of

846
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:44,359
spinach in your diet in your bloodstream

847
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:47,399
it stays bonded to certain trace

848
00:34:44,359 --> 00:34:51,000
minerals which makes that sodium last

849
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:53,440
longer in your system and not a flash in

850
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,879
the pan and then boom it's in your organ

851
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,960
and that's it so here's the key right

852
00:34:54,879 --> 00:35:00,800
here big one right here when you're do

853
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:04,280
sodium in the water like a good salt

854
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:07,520
that I talked about rock salt sea salt

855
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:10,680
okay it's a flash in the pan in your

856
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:12,920
bloodstream it's like treating something

857
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:15,599
with medications

858
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:18,800
conventionally that's what it is it's

859
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:19,640
like treating something conventionally

860
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,359
with

861
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:24,720
medications

862
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:27,839
right keep that in mind it's not the

863
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:30,000
Deep rooted Long Haul of fixing things

864
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:34,960
and healing things it's the conventional

865
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:38,280
model mindset you put salt in there it's

866
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:41,200
in your bloodstream and gone it's a

867
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:44,280
shining star and then it burns

868
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:48,480
out understand that this is a big

869
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:50,640
one so people are getting salt hits and

870
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:53,359
that's what happens with yeast extract

871
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:56,280
and natural flavoring those are msgs

872
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:59,560
those are salts salt

873
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:03,800
hits so you're getting these quick you

874
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:06,839
know these quick highs like salt drug

875
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:08,359
highs you guys see what I'm saying so

876
00:36:06,839 --> 00:36:10,000
what happens is when your trainer's like

877
00:36:08,359 --> 00:36:12,720
yeah you just put salt in water that's

878
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,440
what you need to do get the good salt

879
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,680
you know make sure it's the rock salt or

880
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:19,040
whatever Himalayan and you do that and

881
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:21,760
you're getting a quick hit so you're

882
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:24,480
getting what's called like a salt High

883
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:28,200
it only sits in your bloodstream for a

884
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:30,839
certain amount of time gets discarded or

885
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:32,800
a hunk of it gets buried and

886
00:36:30,839 --> 00:36:34,119
crystallizes so what's happening to a

887
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,520
lot of people's brains is they're

888
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:41,160
getting crystallizations from salt

889
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:42,760
deposits in their brains namely MSG is

890
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:46,920
one of them or

891
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:49,760
MSG bound to other

892
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:54,480
salts so what happens is

893
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:57,319
that sodium can build up over time

894
00:36:54,480 --> 00:37:01,119
Harbor a nice safe haven in your brain

895
00:36:57,319 --> 00:37:03,760
or brain stem and become crystallized as

896
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:06,680
the years go on and you can literally

897
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:09,960
have these salt deposits in your brain

898
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:11,760
that MRIs will be able to detect as

899
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:14,359
years go on and you're getting older and

900
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:18,319
older and they're just going to say Mrs

901
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:23,119
Smith you have Alzheimer's really you

902
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:24,480
got Metals salt deposits scar tissue and

903
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:25,960
all kinds of other things growing in

904
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,240
there so you want to minimize whatever

905
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:30,599
can grow in your head Dr Fawn right

906
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:33,280
there blood tests change dayto day just

907
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:36,040
because it's low in serum doesn't mean

908
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:39,000
it's an accurate reading correct of

909
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:41,640
what's in the cell even if you use

910
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,160
Spectra cell or other nutritional

911
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:45,839
analysis I agree that's actually really

912
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:48,920
good that's really good thank you Dr

913
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:51,119
Fawn MD amazing doctor and that's

914
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:53,560
actually um amazing information thank

915
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:55,920
you for bringing that to our

916
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:58,560
attention which takes me to another area

917
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:02,359
I want to go really quick which is is

918
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:06,720
okay the reading the salt reading in

919
00:38:02,359 --> 00:38:11,680
your blood work in your blood test okay

920
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:15,640
salt reading should be lower than it is

921
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:20,040
is what it should be they have it on the

922
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:23,720
modern world's salt level the modern era

923
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:27,800
salt level they have it in the 1950s

924
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:31,240
spectrum of where sodium should be with

925
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:37,280
everybody had the salt shaker and every

926
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:41,920
single meal was salted heavily with not

927
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:46,720
Himalayan rock salt not pink rock

928
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:50,319
salt not black salt not sea salt

929
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:52,079
everybody's Shaker had the road salt in

930
00:38:50,319 --> 00:38:55,480
it the

931
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:58,520
1950s is the stat they use for how much

932
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:01,680
sodium should be in your bloodstream

933
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:05,680
that's what they determin should be your

934
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:09,319
sodium level it was in in a day in an

935
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:13,160
age of every single meal had a salt

936
00:39:09,319 --> 00:39:15,119
shaker at the table and every man salted

937
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:18,359
the crap out of their food didn't matter

938
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:20,960
what it was this is what happened okay

939
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:24,079
doctors weren't like watch your sodium

940
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:28,520
Mr Smith watch your sodium Mrs Smith no

941
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:29,960
they weren't it was like that so it was

942
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:31,800
everybody was salting the heck out of

943
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:34,440
their food that's what they were doing

944
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:36,440
that was the 1950s and it was the road

945
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:39,480
salt and that's the measurement they're

946
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:41,359
throwing on you today there it is they

947
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:43,760
never adjusted it they never did the

948
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:46,440
science to actually really determine

949
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:48,680
what's good what's bad and so what

950
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:50,520
happens is if you threw up one night you

951
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:53,119
got a little food poisoning maybe you

952
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:54,760
got like you know the neuro virus maybe

953
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:56,240
you got the stomach flu something hits

954
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,880
you you've been throwing up for a couple

955
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,000
days you can't really hold food down you

956
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,520
go to the hospital they're going to say

957
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,240
it's your

958
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:04,119
sodium they're going to say it's your

959
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,760
sodium your sodium is low you're in

960
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:07,280
you're in a sodium crisis this what it

961
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,680
is say you're somebody with a

962
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,240
neurological problem where you have a

963
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:13,200
weak neurological system and you're

964
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:15,720
having a flare up or you're have you're

965
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:17,240
you're partially dehydrated you don't

966
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,079
have enough glucose to your nervous

967
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:20,720
system and you end up in the hospital

968
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:22,640
that night because your husband brought

969
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:24,520
you in and you're going into the

970
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:26,680
hospital again because you can't really

971
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:28,319
feel your arms well that it's not a

972
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:30,000
stroke you been down this road you had

973
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:31,440
every test they think it's multiple

974
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,839
sceris they don't know what it is you're

975
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,040
back in the hospital they're going to

976
00:40:32,839 --> 00:40:36,240
say ma'am your sodium's low and that's

977
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,680
why you're dealing with this your

978
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:41,160
sodium's low and that's what they're

979
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:42,640
going to tell you that's how it rolls so

980
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:45,440
keep that in

981
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:48,319
mind if you're if especially if you're

982
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:50,760
not able to get what you need in in you

983
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:53,119
it's another thing your sodium is low

984
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:56,079
back in the 1950s the TV dinners were

985
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:58,359
born the TV dinners were so high in salt

986
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:00,599
it was off the charts everybody was

987
00:40:58,359 --> 00:41:04,119
saturated in salt in the 1950s that's

988
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:06,960
the test they use still to this day and

989
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:08,960
that's what's going on there all right

990
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:12,359
how do you how do you actually sustain

991
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:16,400
sodium so you're not having to rely on

992
00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:18,800
water and salt water and

993
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:21,760
salt you have to bring enough sodium

994
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:25,960
into your diet that naturally occurs in

995
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:28,119
plants and herbs that is the key right

996
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:31,160
here okay

997
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:34,400
so in this glass right here I have lemon

998
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:37,319
balm not particularly high in

999
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:40,240
sodium I have honey in here

1000
00:41:37,319 --> 00:41:45,000
too and I have

1001
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:46,359
water okay this is not a salty Brew in

1002
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,440
my

1003
00:41:46,359 --> 00:41:53,000
hand all right if I eat a celery stick

1004
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:56,119
and drink some tea I'm bringing those

1005
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:59,280
sodium cluster salts into the mix into

1006
00:41:56,119 --> 00:42:01,240
the bloodstream and it could sustain and

1007
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,280
sit in my blood for quite a while a lot

1008
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:04,160
longer than any kind of salt hit so if

1009
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:07,760
you

1010
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:10,160
take Himalayan rock salt or a sea salt

1011
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:13,319
and you throw it in

1012
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:15,880
here okay and mix it up it's only going

1013
00:42:13,319 --> 00:42:17,240
to give you a quick hit that quick hit

1014
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:19,520
will be in your bloodstream for a very

1015
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:22,760
short time any excess will either be

1016
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:26,599
urinated out or will go into your liver

1017
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:29,119
or in another organ eventually for

1018
00:42:26,599 --> 00:42:31,359
storage it may never come back

1019
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:34,000
out keep that in

1020
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:35,839
mind when you're doing something like

1021
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,800
healing tools like the medical medum

1022
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:40,559
spinach soup something changes it's also

1023
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,599
addicting so it makes you feel good for

1024
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:45,640
a minute and then makes you feel like

1025
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:48,079
you need more salt is really highly

1026
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:51,240
addictive so that's another thing too

1027
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:54,599
and like I said your acclamation drops

1028
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:57,680
for things that you need salt from and

1029
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:59,440
it raises from for chips and stuff like

1030
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:02,720
that okay so let's hit

1031
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:03,960

is usually added to like better stuff

1084
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:14,319
out there you'll see sea salt you'll

1085
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:17,000
hear that so I want I want everybody to

1086
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:18,520
know it's okay to use a little bit of

1087
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,280
salt if you want to use a little bit of

1088
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:23,200
salt it's okay to use a little bit of a

1089
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:27,480
high quality himalay uh rock salt or a

1090
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:29,839
sea salt okay so like the meals the

1091
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:32,240
medical medium meals at Cafe Gratitude

1092
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:34,839
on October 15th they're easy on the salt

1093
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:38,400
and they use a really high quality sea

1094
00:45:34,839 --> 00:45:40,960
salt okay but remember it's not thrown

1095
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:43,440
in water and just thrown in water plus

1096
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:46,880
they're easy on it so I like a little

1097
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:49,319
bit of that here and there okay and I

1098
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:51,960
like that but what happens is that

1099
00:45:49,319 --> 00:45:54,119
restaurants put a ton of salt in stuff I

1100
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:57,119
mean they just put grams and grams and

1101
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:58,960
grams of salt in stuff and those crunchy

1102
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:00,240
chips Yep they're they're going to be

1103
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,720
salty and they're going to have that

1104
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:05,680
edge so here's the key what has you

1105
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:09,559
coming back for those chips so you stay

1106
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:12,680
addicted is the salt the salt content

1107
00:46:09,559 --> 00:46:14,240
keep that in mind along with stuff like

1108
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:16,240
yeast extract in a lot of those

1109
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:17,640
different chips along with natural

1110
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:20,079
flavors in a lot of those different

1111
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:23,720
chips all different forms of sodium

1112
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:26,400
thrown in there okay and MSG and so

1113
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:29,079
forth so that keeps you going it's this

1114
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,599
addiction to Salt that's a big part of

1115
00:46:29,079 --> 00:46:33,920
what it is so you're going to want to go

1116
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:37,280
and get those chips cuz you want that

1117
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:40,480
salt if you don't have salt on those

1118
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:42,839
chips you will not be eating them I

1119
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:45,800
promise you this if they were

1120
00:46:42,839 --> 00:46:48,640
saltless you would have three chips a

1121
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:50,880
week at best and you'd be looking for

1122
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:52,400
salt from something else to to dip the

1123
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:55,400
chip in something

1124
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:57,359
salty so you got to understand it is the

1125
00:46:55,400 --> 00:47:00,160
salt that you're addicted to

1126
00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:02,599
and that salt over time with on that

1127
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:05,400
level builds up in our organs and so

1128
00:47:02,599 --> 00:47:10,119
forth but it also knocks your ability

1129
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:12,680
away your natural ability to gravitate

1130
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:15,480
and consume things like the spinach

1131
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:19,960
right here it takes

1132
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:22,079
away your natural like pallet and your

1133
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:24,000
body's natural connection to something

1134
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:25,520
like spinach instead you're going to

1135
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:30,720
hear something out there spinach is bad

1136
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:33,200
for you Ates aoic acid that's not true

1137
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:35,359
that's not true and this is a raw

1138
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,920
spinach soup there's a big difference

1139
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:38,680
spinach is one of those things that if

1140
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:42,160
you cook

1141
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:44,040
spinach some tannins can come out okay

1142
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:46,640
and that could be that that could be you

1143
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:48,480
know one thing too it happens when you

1144
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:50,640
cook spinach a little tannin will come

1145
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,920
out it'll make it taste weird even

1146
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:56,119
slightly

1147
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:58,200
bitter when it's raw it is perfect

1148
00:47:56,119 --> 00:48:01,000
absolutely perfect perect some are over

1149
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:02,800
there let's see I've been addicted to

1150
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:05,040
chips for my whole life recently I

1151
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:07,640
started having spinach soup and I don't

1152
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:09,720
desire chips as much is that a

1153
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:11,920
coincidence you're getting the right

1154
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:13,559
amount of salt from the spinach soup

1155
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:15,079
into your bloodstream and into your body

1156
00:48:13,559 --> 00:48:17,400
and then you're intuitively connecting

1157
00:48:15,079 --> 00:48:19,240
to all of that psychically intuitively

1158
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:21,920
all that you're connecting to that that

1159
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:24,079
whole thing and then it's making it so

1160
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,839
you're like I don't want those chips as

1161
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:29,839
much I don't want to eat those chips as

1162
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:34,319
much this inredible that is incredible

1163
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:38,400
okay so here's how the industries work

1164
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:40,960
salt something and you will be a buyer

1165
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:44,119
and consumer for a

1166
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:45,960
lifetime make the chip somewhat a better

1167
00:48:44,119 --> 00:48:48,400
healthier chip so-called better

1168
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:51,160
healthier chip and salt the crap out of

1169
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:53,040
it and you will eat even more of them

1170
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:56,480
because in your mind they are a

1171
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:59,359
healthier chip so then you feel safer

1172
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:01,599
and better to actually consume that chip

1173
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:03,760
and you're going to be addicted to that

1174
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:05,720
chip because of the amount of salt on

1175
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:07,799
that chip and you are going to be a

1176
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:10,040
buyer of that chip for the rest of your

1177
00:49:07,799 --> 00:49:11,440
life what that sodium is going to do

1178
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:13,520
over time it's going to build up in your

1179
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:15,680
organs and your liver and your brain and

1180
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:20,280
create problems another thing it's going

1181
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:23,480
to do it's going to stop you from making

1182
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:26,960
the connection you need to make to a

1183
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:30,880
medical medium healing tool or a a

1184
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:34,280
healing herb or healing green it's going

1185
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:37,359
to prevent you from acclimating to

1186
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:40,520
something that could save your life and

1187
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:42,280
return your health back and you'll be

1188
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:45,160
addicted to this other stuff that the

1189
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:46,880
salt's in you'll be prevent it'll be

1190
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:49,319
preventing you from actually learning

1191
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:51,720
how to consume the right kind of salt

1192
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:54,520
which is what you see in my hand and

1193
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:57,200
you'll actually you'll you'll pay for it

1194
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:58,280
one way or another as

1195
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,839
time goes

1196
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:02,720
on

1197
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:06,359
M God you guys are so addicted to

1198
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:09,119
chips totally understand not making fun

1199
00:50:06,359 --> 00:50:11,400
of anybody here baby in over there it's

1200
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:14,799
like the more I put salt on my meals the

1201
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:17,960
more I have cravings for chips or

1202
00:50:14,799 --> 00:50:20,480
something yes that's another thing too

1203
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:22,760
that's how you eat more chips so the

1204
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:28,640
thing is with chips eat chips to your

1205
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:28,640
sick eat chips to your sick

1206
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:35,319
the salt makes you want to eat the whole

1207
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:38,040
bag eat the crap out of them and then

1208
00:50:35,319 --> 00:50:40,760
the next day eat another whole bag the

1209
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:43,280
next night another whole bag it makes

1210
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:44,319
you want more and more of it because of

1211
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,280
the

1212
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:48,799
salt

1213
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:50,119
yep all right rund down on sodium

1214
00:50:48,799 --> 00:50:51,720
problems like I said I talked about

1215
00:50:50,119 --> 00:50:55,280
before the conventional model for the

1216
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:57,640
blood test is wrong it was gauged on the

1217
00:50:55,280 --> 00:51:00,160
1950s when everybody body was using road

1218
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:03,359
salt and it was done that way and

1219
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:06,240
everybody had a salt diet okay we still

1220
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:09,359
have salt diets now better salts like I

1221
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:12,280
said are happening yes chips have oil

1222
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:15,559
too but try to eat those chips with just

1223
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:18,880
oil with no salt and you will not be

1224
00:51:15,559 --> 00:51:20,160
happy you will be a miserable miserable

1225
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:23,480
consumer

1226
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:26,079
customer if you just have the chip with

1227
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:28,480
the oil on it a healthier chip with

1228
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:30,799
healthier oil on it maybe avocado oil

1229
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:33,119
whatever it is and you don't have the

1230
00:51:30,799 --> 00:51:35,599
salt in there you will not waste your

1231
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:37,880
money on those chips anymore that will

1232
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:37,880
be

1233
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:45,400
that all

1234
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:46,760
right how come people have low sodium in

1235
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:49,040
many

1236
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:51,240
situations they have low

1237
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:54,440
sodium because they're not getting any

1238
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:57,680
of the correct vital real sodium they

1239
00:51:54,440 --> 00:52:01,760
need to be getting from celery G juices

1240
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:05,040
from lemons yes lemons from spinach yes

1241
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:07,799
spinach even a cilantro has a little bit

1242
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:10,960
in there they're not getting it from

1243
00:52:07,799 --> 00:52:14,839
Tomatoes tomatoes have a little bit of

1244
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:17,400
natural occurring sodium in it which is

1245
00:52:14,839 --> 00:52:19,880
incredible

1246
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:23,559
tomatoes so these are things that are

1247
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:24,799
critical for people for their healing

1248
00:52:23,559 --> 00:52:29,040
that's the kind of

1249
00:52:24,799 --> 00:52:32,240
sodium that resets everything oh man I

1250
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:34,240
hate that word reset I hate that word

1251
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:37,079
everybody uses that word every time they

1252
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:40,119
think they got a new idea a new plan in

1253
00:52:37,079 --> 00:52:41,920
health a new whatever it's like a reset

1254
00:52:40,119 --> 00:52:44,720

new program reset reset meanwhile not

1256
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:49,520
really it's not really it's not really a

1257
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:53,040
reset not a real

1258
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:55,280
reset but good you know good marketing

1259
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:57,079
all right you guys let's start baking

1260
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:59,240
some spinach soup so much more to talk

1261
00:52:57,079 --> 00:53:02,599
about sodium so the way you sustain

1262
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:05,559
sodium in your in your

1263
00:53:02,599 --> 00:53:09,760
system

1264
00:53:05,559 --> 00:53:11,599
okay is by getting sodium that's bonded

1265
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:14,280
and attached to other

1266
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:17,280
minerals it stays in the bloodstream

1267
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:20,839
longer and when it enters an organ it

1268
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:23,319
doesn't get dumped as trash meaning and

1269
00:53:20,839 --> 00:53:27,319
piled in some corner you got to

1270
00:53:23,319 --> 00:53:30,480
understand that sodium won't hold a bond

1271
00:53:27,319 --> 00:53:33,960
when it's in sea salt like I said it

1272
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:36,000
won't hold the bond when it's in say

1273
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:38,520
Himalayan rock salt of some kind or pink

1274
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,920
salt it won't hold a bond long enough

1275
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:43,680
inside the body it's a quick fix meaning

1276
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:46,760
it's a quick hit is what it is it's a

1277
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:50,000
quick hit it won't hold the bond and

1278
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:51,960
when it won't hold the bond then it gets

1279
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:54,839
stored in the liver somewhere as a

1280
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:57,880
deposit of garbage stored in the brain

1281
00:53:54,839 --> 00:54:02,079
as a deposit of garbage just like guess

1282
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:06,200
what MSG same thing

1283
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:08,880
stores and becomes garbage trash trash

1284
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:11,280
salt even if it was a great salt what

1285
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:13,440
I'm saying is if you throw it in water

1286
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:15,400
that happens if you use a little bit of

1287
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:19,680
the pink salt and a really high quality

1288
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:21,799
sea salt in your food I'm okay with that

1289
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:23,520
or should I say Spirit of compassion is

1290
00:54:21,799 --> 00:54:25,599
okay with

1291
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:28,240
that because that's where I got that

1292
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:30,640
piece of information

1293
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:32,040
from got to get got to give Spirit

1294
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:34,480
credit

1295
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:36,440
sometimes ASO over there on YouTube

1296
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:39,200
spinach soup makes it so easy to get

1297
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:40,559
tons of greens exactly which is what

1298
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:42,200
we're going to do right now which I'm

1299
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:45,599
excited I have mine plugged in right

1300
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:49,839
here my machine I'm pumped up about

1301
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:53,280
this see I've cared myself and many

1302
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:56,400
clients from potato chip addictions

1303
00:54:53,280 --> 00:55:00,799
using spinach soup and leafy greens they

1304
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:03,000
reduce salty crunchy Cravings

1305
00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:08,319
boom

1306
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:11,240
boom amazing seriously really is all

1307
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:13,599
right this is how you hold your sodium

1308
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:16,839
it's bonded doesn't get thrown out like

1309
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:19,799
trash or stored in an organ like trash

1310
00:55:16,839 --> 00:55:21,599
okay especially when you put like on

1311
00:55:19,799 --> 00:55:24,599
like okay for instance when you put like

1312
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:27,839
a sea salt a high quality sea salt on

1313
00:55:24,599 --> 00:55:30,960
food that's not garbage garbage food you

1314
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:33,200
put it on food like this or food like

1315
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:35,200
you know like a medical medium potato

1316
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:37,720
salad or something and you put it on

1317
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:40,559
that kind of food it's different you can

1318
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:43,000
get away with it you can use it that's

1319
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:44,960
why at Cafe Gratitude we're using some

1320
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:48,839
we we're staying easy on it which is

1321
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:50,280
incredible but we're using some it works

1322
00:55:48,839 --> 00:55:52,000
but you don't want to be putting it in

1323
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:53,400
throwing it in your water like your

1324
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,920
trainer's telling you and you're

1325
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:57,160
guzzling it down and you think you're

1326
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:58,640
doing your body good your your Skin's

1327
00:55:57,160 --> 00:56:00,799
going to turn to crap down the road

1328
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:02,160
you're going to dehydrate your Derma

1329
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:04,280
it's going to be it's going to be a

1330
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:05,799
quick hit in your bloodstream then gone

1331
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:08,200
it's going to store in your brain and

1332
00:56:05,799 --> 00:56:10,720
liver that's a different

1333
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:13,240
story and then when you do things like

1334
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:16,039
this the spinach you're bonding that

1335
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:19,480
sodium to minerals they stay in your

1336
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:22,880
bloodstream and they regulate they

1337
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:26,400
regulate that's what I needed to say

1338
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:28,880
this whole time

1339
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:31,039
sodium from the celery sodium from the

1340
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:33,880
spinach regulat so what I'm going to do

1341
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:35,960
is I'm just GNA to just knock this down

1342
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:37,960
a little bit I want a lot in here so I

1343
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:40,920
want to show you guys what I

1344
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:43,160
do okay someone might just do that and

1345
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:45,799
that's all they do they put like a cup

1346
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:48,119
in there couple of Cups I'm going to put

1347
00:56:45,799 --> 00:56:50,520
more now it's not crushed and chopped

1348
00:56:48,119 --> 00:56:53,079
finely and put into like um measuring

1349
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:58,240
cup but what I want to do is I'm putting

1350
00:56:53,079 --> 00:56:58,240
a lot in here I'm making a thick one

1351
00:56:58,359 --> 00:57:03,359
like kind of like a dip so it isn't

1352
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:06,119
going to be a real liquidy spinach soup

1353
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:07,760
it's going to be like a thick dip okay

1354
00:57:06,119 --> 00:57:11,319
and I'm not putting anything else in

1355
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:13,920
here yet so keep that in mind all

1356
00:57:11,319 --> 00:57:15,720
right putting some more spinach in here

1357
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:18,599
like this look how much I got going on

1358
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:21,319
in here look at

1359
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:24,319
that half of a big

1360
00:57:21,319 --> 00:57:26,280
container and I'm using a food processor

1361
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:28,240
now you can make it your consistency

1362
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:30,480
want with the food processor you can

1363
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:31,960
actually pulse it like I'm doing see

1364
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:34,920
right

1365
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:37,280
there okay so I got a decent amount of

1366
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:39,760
spinach in there and I can get more in

1367
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:41,160
there too I'm not going to put a lot of

1368
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,920
celery in here that's why the recipe

1369
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:44,440
doesn't call it calls for like one stick

1370
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:47,160
a half a stick you can do a quarter

1371
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:49,319
stick I'm just going to do um a quarter

1372
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:52,039
of a stick it's extra sodium it's a

1373
00:57:49,319 --> 00:57:53,760
different variety of sodium so you're

1374
00:57:52,039 --> 00:57:56,240
looking at two different kinds of sodium

1375
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:58,280
right here you're looking at celery

1376
00:57:56,240 --> 00:58:00,480
sodium you're looking at spinach

1377
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:02,440
sodium I'm going to put a little bit of

1378
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:04,200
Basil in here not a lot but I'm going to

1379
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:06,280
put you can put more in if you want I'm

1380
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:09,839
going to throw some basil in here to

1381
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:14,559
give it a little bit of a twist into it

1382
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:16,200
there okay all right

1383
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:18,640
tomatoes

1384
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:21,160
so you know two three mediumsized

1385
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:22,520
tomatoes are great you can do a little

1386
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:27,520
less if you really wanted to a little

1387
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:27,520
bit more there's sodium in tomatoes

1388
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,960
there is sodium in

1389
00:58:32,039 --> 00:58:40,720
tomatoes yes different form of

1390
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:42,400
sodium these all hold a bond and as they

1391
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:45,640
hold a

1392
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:47,880
bond you're going to have a regulation

1393
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:50,359
of sodium in your bloodstream so you're

1394
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:52,760
not you don't become an addict you don't

1395
00:58:50,359 --> 00:58:55,240
become a sodium crack addict cuz that's

1396
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:57,240
what happens sometimes it can be hard to

1397
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:59,240
get good taste T ing Tomatoes I want to

1398
00:58:57,240 --> 00:59:00,920
head into that field right now okay I

1399
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:03,160
got to tell you guys something you get a

1400
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:05,200
sweeter tomato like an heirloom tomato

1401
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:07,839
spinach soup tastes extraordinary out of

1402
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:11,240
this world if you get a tomato that's

1403
00:59:07,839 --> 00:59:13,319
sweet and it's not so acidy the Tomato

1404
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:16,240
the the spinach soup tastes absolutely

1405
00:59:13,319 --> 00:59:18,799
incredible okay these aren't really that

1406
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:20,760
acidy they're on the sweeter side this

1407
00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:22,880
is a good tomato I'm using right now and

1408
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:25,319
when you use a good tomato boom you can

1409
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:26,960
just live off of this it tastes so damn

1410
00:59:25,319 --> 00:59:29,160
good and if you're worried about protein

1411
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:31,000
oh my God my God my God the whole

1412
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:32,960
protein thing protein protein protein

1413
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:36,559
protein you're getting a lot of protein

1414
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:38,839
from your spinach it pains me to say it

1415
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:40,720
because honestly the whole protein scare

1416
00:59:38,839 --> 00:59:42,720
and protein fear based crap that's

1417
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:45,000
happening out there is unbelievable and

1418
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:46,240
ridiculous for a billion reasons and

1419
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,599
someday we're going to explore all of

1420
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:50,079
them but the point is is you're getting

1421
00:59:48,599 --> 00:59:51,680
plenty of that if that's your if that's

1422
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:54,079
your stuff you know that's your thing

1423
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:56,440
okay so I got a um orange right here

1424
00:59:54,079 --> 00:59:59,799
another key

1425
00:59:56,440 --> 01:00:01,920
if you get a good orange a sweet orange

1426
00:59:59,799 --> 01:00:05,680
one that's not that like you know what I

1427
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:09,240
mean like um sharp one that's not as

1428
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:12,720
sharp if you get an orange that's smooth

1429
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:16,440
and it's sweet and you have tomatoes

1430
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:19,599
that are sweet and also smooth not as

1431
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:21,319
bitey you can make this taste so good

1432
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:23,200
now if you if you can't do that and you

1433
01:00:21,319 --> 01:00:24,799
got whatever tomato and that tomato

1434
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:26,799
seems really like kind of more unlike

1435
01:00:24,799 --> 01:00:29,200
the you know acidic side where it's

1436
01:00:26,799 --> 01:00:32,760
acidy even though it's an alkaline fruit

1437
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:34,680
even though if you get one of

1438
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:36,400
those then you might want to put a

1439
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:38,559
little honey in it so I got some honey

01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:47,119
them they don't it's the combination of

1544
01:05:43,359 --> 01:05:49,119
all of it put together and the sodium

something okay like influencers these

1573
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:05,760
days they won't hold anything unless

1574
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:08,119
they're getting paid that's just how it

1575
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:08,119
works

1576
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:15,680
now nobody's paying me for the spinach

1577
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:17,920
soup I just want the chronically eel to

1578
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:23,000

1579
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:23,000
matters this is a tool that does

1580
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:28,520
it and if you make it right

1581
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:29,880

say you don't get a really good tomato

1585
01:07:34,079 --> 01:07:38,599
say you don't get a really good orange

1586
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:41,839
all right maybe your spinach isn't the

1587
01:07:38,599 --> 01:07:45,799
best tasting spinach what you do is you

get your honey and you just put that's

1589
01:07:45,799 --> 01:07:53,640
it so a little bit of honey that's all

1590
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:56,200
just like that and then you mix it

1591
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:59,160
up right you mix a little bit of that

1592
01:07:56,200 --> 01:08:02,279

01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:21,960
on your counter and let it warm up when

1621
01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:26,199
you make it it'll just be room

1622
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:27,920
temperature that's the way I eat it

1623
01:09:26,199 --> 01:09:30,040
can I have

1624
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:34,600

1625
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:36,799

1626
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:38,759
gout ask your doctor what's right for

1627
01:09:36,799 --> 01:09:40,279
you but you better believe it I've had

1628
01:09:38,759 --> 01:09:42,159
people I've known in my life and so

1629
01:09:40,279 --> 01:09:43,239
forth they're doing spinach soup for

1630
01:09:42,159 --> 01:09:46,040
their

1631
01:09:43,239 --> 01:09:50,000
gout just don't do your spinach soup

1632
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:52,359
with a big fat steak cuz if you got Gout

1633
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:54,480
and and and I'm not making fun of meat

1634
01:09:52,359 --> 01:09:56,880
don't do your spinach soup with a big

1635
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:59,440
pile of beans either and don't do your

1636
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:01,360
spinach soup with a big pile of nuts if

1637
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:03,360
you got Gout you don't want to be eating

1638
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:06,000
a lot of protein if you eat a lot of

1639
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:07,400
dense protein like animal protein which

1640
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,880
doesn't mean that's the protein that

1641
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:12,080
works whatever but the point is if

1642
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:15,199
you're doing any kind of protein a high

1643
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:16,760
protein spinach protein much different

1644
01:10:15,199 --> 01:10:19,000
it's a different kind of protein but if

1645
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:20,440
you do like a whole bunch of bean

1646
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:23,400
protein where you're just doing a big

1647
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:26,400
pile of beans and you got Gout you might

1648
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:28,320
get in trouble if you do a big pile of

1649
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:29,880
nuts and you got Gout you're going to be

1650
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:32,280
in trouble you you'll get in trouble if

1651
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:33,920
you do a big pile of meat and you got

1652
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:35,800
Gout you're going to be in trouble so

1653
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:39,120
what I'm saying is yes a spinach soup is

1654
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:42,520
great for gout it's great for for

1655
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:46,000

1672
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:31,400
was so bad I've watched them go from

1673
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:33,440

1674
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:35,480

censorship and remember when my T

1731
01:13:43,719 --> 01:13:46,880
remember when Tik Tok I don't think you

1732
01:13:45,159 --> 01:13:50,520
guys remember but I was heading up to

1733
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:53,120
like a million subscribers on Tik Tok

1734
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:54,800
and my Tik Tok videos were were in the

1735
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:57,280
millions of views we were getting the

1736
01:13:54,800 --> 01:14:01,960
wor out about chronic illness and Tik

1737
01:13:57,280 --> 01:14:05,880
Tok they got rid of the entire account

1738
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:08,120
and they didn't allow a way to reach

1739
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:11,000
them they did it so they didn't leave

1740
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:13,480
any data behind for me to ever contact

1741
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:15,760
them and when I F found finally found

1742
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:17,239
somebody in there they wouldn't help

1743
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:18,679
when I found somebody through somebody

1744
01:14:17,239 --> 01:14:21,560
else and everything and they wouldn't

1745
01:14:18,679 --> 01:14:24,840
help and then if I told you the rest of

1746
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:26,199
the story your mind would be blown what

1747
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:29,520
happen happened with that Tik Tok

1748
01:14:26,199 --> 01:14:32,920
account with what they did your mind

1749
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:35,320
would be blown they purposely deleted it

1750
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:39,440
and then they waited exactly 6 months to

1751
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:42,400
the day before they changed the a guard

1752
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:44,639
that I was in contact with and when they

1753
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:46,840
changed that Guard the guard said

1754
01:14:44,639 --> 01:14:49,679
exactly 6 months to this day we can't

1755
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:52,679

1756
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:56,159
actually guarding over the six-month

1757
01:14:52,679 --> 01:14:58,120
period so I couldn't get my account back

1758
01:14:56,159 --> 01:15:00,639
talking about sick that's

1759
01:14:58,120 --> 01:15:03,400

1763
01:15:07,639 --> 01:15:13,159

1799
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:44,239
yourself drown yourself your lungs can

1800
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:47,560
fill up with water your bloodstream can

1801
01:16:44,239 --> 01:16:49,400
thin out too much with water so medical

1802
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:51,840
medium information was always about

1803
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:56,000
adding solids to water do you guys get

1804
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:58,000
what that is adding solids to it right

1805
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,840
adding lemon this isn't a lemon right

1806
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:06,480
here I can grab one really quick but

1807
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:11,120
adding lemon to your water lemon holds

1808
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:14,679
sodium it holds other solids

1809
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:19,800
calcium the minerals the metals soft

1810
01:17:14,679 --> 01:17:22,440
Metals we need magnesium right so lemons

1811
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:26,040
hold these and so what happens is when

1812
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:29,159
you squeeze lemon in water you you just

1813
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:31,639
diverted a chance to

1814
01:17:29,159 --> 01:17:33,800
drown doesn't mean you still can't drown

1815
01:17:31,639 --> 01:17:36,000
yourself it you know with drinking too

1816
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:37,800
much water but you advert you completely

1817
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:40,520
adverted you you've diverted that

1818
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:44,239
possibility to happen easily so what

1819
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:48,560
happens is with lemon lemon in water it

1820
01:17:44,239 --> 01:17:51,199
allows okay th that sodium to get to

1821
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:53,920
where it needs and hold and stay bonded

1822
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:57,560
with other trace minerals to keep

1823
01:17:53,920 --> 01:18:00,560
electrolytes high so your water isn't

1824
01:17:57,560 --> 01:18:03,560
thinning your bloodstream out

1825
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:03,560
empty

1826
01:18:05,199 --> 01:18:10,080
empty so Spirit of

1827
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:13,040
compassion wanted people to be on lemon

1828
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:14,719
water because of flushing the liver of

1829
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:19,120
poisons and

1830
01:18:14,719 --> 01:18:22,360
toxins flushing the body of poisons and

1831
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:25,280
toxins one of those ways of doing it is

1832
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:28,760
lemon has detoxification

1833
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:32,360
like detoxifying

1834
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:34,840
minerals that can help push out garbage

1835
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:37,920
junk and pull it out

1836
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:40,280
right if you're somebody who all they

1837
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:42,280
have is distilled water you have to add

1838
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:45,600
some trace minerals into that water you

1839
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:47,480
have to add lemon into that water at

1840
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:50,000
least lemon into that water so if you're

1841
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:51,639
a distilled water person now you're like

1842
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:55,400
You' got rid of all the

1843
01:18:51,639 --> 01:18:59,000
solids okay r o reverse o mosis there's

1844
01:18:55,400 --> 01:19:03,159
still solids in there keep that in mind

1845
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:06,639
most Ro systems leave some solids in the

1846
01:19:03,159 --> 01:19:09,040
water distilled water

1847
01:19:06,639 --> 01:19:11,080
distillers they get rid of all the

1848
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:12,920
solids and then you got and then you're

1849
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:14,600
drinking that water if you drink too

1850
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:16,040
much of that distilled water and you're

1851
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:18,199
drinking way too much of it now we're in

1852
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:20,159
a water topic I got to do I got to do

1853
01:19:18,199 --> 01:19:23,639
another live on this maybe I'll do a

1854
01:19:20,159 --> 01:19:26,040
podcast or something but you're drinking

1855
01:19:23,639 --> 01:19:29,159
distilled water you can get in trouble

1856
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:32,960
because there's no solids in that

1857
01:19:29,159 --> 01:19:35,239
water okay plus distilled water might

1858
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:37,600
take something from you that's good

1859
01:19:35,239 --> 01:19:40,000
because you're using water you need you

1860
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:42,920
you have to have solids in that water

1861
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:45,000
it's critical so lemon this is this is

1862
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:47,000
medical M information just so you guys

1863
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:48,679
know and if someone's poached a tidbit

1864
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:52,280
here and there throughout the years

1865
01:19:48,679 --> 01:19:55,520
there's nothing I can do but what either

1866
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:59,760
way but what I'm trying to say is

1867
01:19:55,520 --> 01:20:02,520
that that the lemon water added to water

1868
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:05,960
makes it so you have less likely chances

1869
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:08,800
to drown in it you have also

1870
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:12,080
electrolytes staying keeping that water

1871
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:13,719
strong so that you don't collapse those

1872
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:14,840
neurotransmitters so if you're somebody

1873
01:20:13,719 --> 01:20:16,560
that's chronically sick and you got

1874
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:18,199
neurotransmitter problems and you got

1875
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:20,840
neur neurological problems and you're

1876
01:20:18,199 --> 01:20:22,719
not well your nervous system struggling

1877
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:24,320
and you're just drinking water and water

1878
01:20:22,719 --> 01:20:26,400
and water it's not going to be a good

1879
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:28,000
thing you got to have you have to have

1880
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:30,280
water that has something in it solids

1881
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:33,159
like coconut water coconut water has

1882
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:34,880
solids in it so that's a whole point it

1883
01:20:33,159 --> 01:20:36,480
has sodium in there it's got different

1884
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:38,760
minerals in there trace minerals that's

1885
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:41,199
what coconut water has naturally

1886
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:42,920
occurring same thing if you something

1887
01:20:41,199 --> 01:20:44,679
similar is when you take lemon and you

1888
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:46,159
squeeze it in water you're doing the

1889
01:20:44,679 --> 01:20:50,159
same thing you're putting solids back

1890
01:20:46,159 --> 01:20:52,480
into that water but with lemon

1891
01:20:50,159 --> 01:20:54,320
water you're actually flushing out the

1892
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:56,280
liver you're actually flushing out you

1893
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:57,679
know the body's organs you're flushing

1894
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:59,719
that junk out that's medical medium

1895
01:20:57,679 --> 01:21:02,280
information I said a million times that

1896
01:20:59,719 --> 01:21:04,239
I'm not the first guy or the first

1897
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:07,080
person on this planet that decided to

1898
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:09,560
cut a lemon and squeeze it in water I

1899
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:11,800
never said that in a million years

1900
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:15,280
because it's not true just frankly it's

1901
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:18,600
not true but medical medium information

1902
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:21,159
that I put out for these decades is that

1903
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:23,800
lemon water first thing in the morning

1904
01:21:21,159 --> 01:21:25,760
is a flusher of toxins and poisons from

1905
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:27,480
the liver when the Li gathers it up all

1906
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:30,320
night long and it needs to get pulled

1907
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:32,560
out the lemon water does

1908
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:34,120
that and also bringing all the

1909
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:35,679
electrolytes back into the water that's

1910
01:21:34,120 --> 01:21:39,320
also medical Med

1911
01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:42,120
information bringing the solids back in

1912
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:43,600
like the calcium and so forth so that's

1913
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:46,280
why lemon water is so important with the

1914
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:51,080
healing process some people over drink

1915
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:54,000
plain water they over drink plain

1916
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:56,239
water and if you over drink it and

1917
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:59,560
you're electrolytes start

1918
01:21:56,239 --> 01:22:02,440
dropping including sodium too

1919
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:04,840
electrolyte starts dropping it's one of

1920
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:07,080
the electrolytes potassium gets thrown

1921
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:08,760
off your sodium pottassium your glucose

1922
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:11,080
gets thrown off glucose is part of an

1923
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:13,639
electrolyte it becomes a part of an

1924
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:15,679
electroly Jackie my son drank too much

1925
01:22:13,639 --> 01:22:19,480
water with friends one day and he felt

1926
01:22:15,679 --> 01:22:22,440
nauseous and felt like throwing up he

1927
01:22:19,480 --> 01:22:25,040
learned I think one of the most terrible

1928
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:29,000
things is like water drinking contests

1929
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:31,040
every five years they all forget that

1930
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:34,600
somebody died in the middle of a water

1931
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:37,400
drinking contest every five years and so

1932
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:40,679
there's uh you know

1933
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:43,960
hazing that's a prime example somebody

1934
01:22:40,679 --> 01:22:45,920
died like 25 years ago from a hazing

1935
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:48,480
where it was a contest to drink the most

1936
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:51,880
water for a whole bunch of newbies at a

1937
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:53,800
fraternity and um you know some kid

1938
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:55,199
drown right in front of everybody and

1939
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:56,880
you can't save them they're drowning

1940
01:22:55,199 --> 01:22:58,040
they're on the floor flapping around and

1941
01:22:56,880 --> 01:23:00,560
then they're just they're

1942
01:22:58,040 --> 01:23:02,239
drowning and you know this is just it's

1943
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:04,320
like every five years another person

1944
01:23:02,239 --> 01:23:06,280
drowns from like a water drinking

1945
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:08,600
contest and I'm like what is going on

1946
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:10,120
here how come nobody remembers and

1947
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:12,440
nobody knows because that's what

1948
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:14,000
Everything Changes in three years and

1949
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:15,600
the same thing with all the influencers

1950
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:17,000
now and the podcast influencers and so

1951
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:19,080
forth the crap they were talking about

1952
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:21,360
three years ago two years ago four years

1953
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:23,199
ago is embarrassing having people do the

1954
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:24,960
worst things and now they change their

1955
01:23:23,199 --> 01:23:26,840
tune and grab some good info from like

1956
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:29,000
mm or something and now they're changing

1957
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:31,040
it no one looks back 3 years ago and

1958
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:33,840
says Whoa you were saying that you

1959
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:34,760
really are like a shape shifter you are

1960
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:37,760
a

1961
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:40,639
chameleon and a carpet bagger celery

1962
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:42,480
juice for sodium incredible a lot of

1963
01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:44,199
people are not consistent with drinking

1964
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:46,840
enough celery juice they only drink 8

1965
01:23:44,199 --> 01:23:49,800
ounces or 6 ounces I'm not sh putting

1966
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:52,040
shade on that drink 2 ounces but their

1967
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:54,639
stress levels are going you know up

1968
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:57,840
their their adrenaline is pumping they

1969
01:23:54,639 --> 01:23:59,679
need more more than just 4 ounces a day

1970
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:01,679
and quite frankly a lot of people

1971
01:23:59,679 --> 01:24:04,040
there's you know they they stop drinking

1972
01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:06,080
celery juice and they remember drinking

1973
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:07,960
it a year ago and they think they still

1974
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:11,560
drink it or something that's something

1975
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:13,840
that happens too people tend to remember

1976
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:16,480
their referencing in their brain a time

1977
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:18,199
when they drank a lot of celery juice or

1978
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:21,000
a time when they ate something really

1979
01:24:18,199 --> 01:24:22,719
good but they haven't been doing that

1980
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:24,040
and they're dabbling you know dabbling

1981
01:24:22,719 --> 01:24:24,840
and stuff they're dabbers right and

1982
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:26,960
they're

1983
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:28,040
dabblers and they're doing that but they

1984
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:31,120
they don't

1985
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:33,639
remember like yo you haven't drank

1986
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:35,679
celery in a few months you had one glass

1987
01:24:33,639 --> 01:24:37,880
of celery juice a month ago you're not

1988
01:24:35,679 --> 01:24:39,520
going to keep your sodium levels strong

1989
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:42,080
so you're going to be relying on

1990
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:43,080
addictive behavior you're going to be a

1991
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:45,400
salt

1992
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:48,040
addict a salt crack addict and you're

1993
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:49,600
going to be just doing that so it it's

1994
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:52,600
crazy that's what happens you guys and

1995
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:56,159
then next thing you know it you know and

1996
01:24:52,600 --> 01:25:00,040

1997
01:24:56,159 --> 01:25:01,600

01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:41,040
when I'm super tired which is kind of

2157
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:44,280
funny like I'm exhaustedly tired like

2158
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:47,880
I'm done and I leave the messages on

2159
01:31:44,280 --> 01:31:49,920
telegram when I'm so tired and then I

2160
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:53,360
sit there and I listen to Spirit of

2161
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:54,760
compassion and I say whatever I hear and

2162
01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:56,800
that's what that's how I leave the

2163
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:58,400
messages on telegram where I'm hearing

2164
01:31:56,800 --> 01:32:01,000
Spirit of compassion and I'm leaving

2165
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:03,280
leaving the words and I don't even know

2166
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:05,000
what I'm saying sometimes because I'm so

2167
