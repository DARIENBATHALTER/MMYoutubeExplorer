because nobody knows why anybody is sick

43
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,840
medical research and science doesn't

44
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,280
know why anybody is sick

45
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,680
they don't

46
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,479
they chalk it up to your jeans your

47
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,200
genes are bad and that's why you're sick

48
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:43,439
it's your genes or it's your body

49
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,840
attacking itself autoimmune right your

50
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,000
body is destroying itself well that that

51
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,640
theory right maybe you're just creating

52
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,320
it

53
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,040

00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:00,240
what comes around goes around it's your

57
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:02,159
karma it's gotta be that

58
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,240
oh maybe you're sick and you can't

59
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,520
function because you had your head

60
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,520
chopped off in 1602

61
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:15,920
you know and maybe something maybe you

62
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:18,400
died in a fire in 1715 somewhere maybe

63
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,400
something else happened you know and so

64
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,879
you know and what happens is we don't

65
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,480
know why anybody's sick nobody knows why

66
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,000
anybody's sick

67
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,760
and people are getting sicker and sicker

68
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,720
and faster and faster and life

69
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,840
expectancy is dropping life expectancy

70
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:37,519
is dropping and dropping

71
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:40,720
guess what they're hiding it too

72
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,840
they're hiding life expectancy they're

73
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,080
actually

74
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,879
hiding it

75
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,840
it's dropping faster than they say they

76
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:52,319
need you to be under the illusion that

77
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,560
everybody's living longer and living

78
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:57,120
healthier and living happier that the

79
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,879
illusion is there and hey if you're not

80
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,680
living longer and healthier you probably

81
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,840
just needed some fiber

82
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,400
you

83
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,640
know the world is so screwed up

84
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,760
in so many ways

85
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,200
that when

86
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:16,239
it's screwed up in the health realm it's

87
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,879
really bad because hey

again with just just my juicer meaning

144
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,479
like me juicing has paid for itself over

145
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,840
and over again i got family members that

146
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,080

147
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,479
i saved this much i'm keeping track i

151
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,680
that's incredible

152
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,680
okay let's talk about fiber

153
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,160
so the big attack

154
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,639
is you need your fiber if you've got to

155
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,720
have your fiber that's what it is and

156
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,240
it's an attack on the juicy world but

157
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,560
it's not just attack on the juicing

158
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,600
world it's attack on your your mental

159
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,919
consciousness it's attack on you because

160
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,120
you're gonna think maybe that's why i'm

161
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:09,759
sick

162
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:14,400
you can you can be someone that eats

163
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:16,160
white bread processed white dough

164
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,720
and you don't get sick

165
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,639
you can be somebody that eats gluten

166
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:24,319
filled processed

167
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:26,639
white dough white flour dough balls and

168
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,960
then fries them in oil

169
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,160
and not be sick

170
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,160
i know

171
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,199
some people over the years

172
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:38,560
literally living on fried dough and

173
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:41,680
they're not sick and they're pooping

174
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:45,520
just fine they got no fiber in their

175
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,520
diet and they're pooping

176
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,800
that's what's happening i know people

177
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:53,360
that are eating white bread a loaf of

178
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,120
white bread and butter and they can poo

179
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,599
just fine

180
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,919
and they're not sick and then

181
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:01,520
i know people that are eating fruits and

182
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,479
vegetables

183
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,479
and can't poo at all

184
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:09,599
i know people that are eating

185
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,319
plenty of fiber but they still have to

186
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:14,199
take

187
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:18,000
fiber supplements and fiber drinks and

188
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:20,800
prescribed fiber medications because

189
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,639
something's wrong inside fiber has

190
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,440
nothing to do

191
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:28,319
with something going wrong and something

192
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:31,680
being wrong inside of you it's not the

193
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:35,919
fiber that keeps cancer away it's not

194
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:38,639
the fiber that keeps disease away it's

195
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:41,280
what was in the plant that wasn't the

196
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:44,720
fiber the fiber is not where the

197
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:47,840
medicine is the medicine is in the juice

198
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,560
of the plant you guys this is so

199
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,560
critical

200
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,639
the fiber

201
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:58,960
in the plant

202
00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:02,479
is your bones in a human being

203
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:05,520
fiber growing a plant out of a ground

204
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:09,039
the fiber's just there so the plant can

205
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:11,520
erect itself and reach the sun

206
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:14,800
that's what fiber is fiber fibrin and

207
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,639
asparagus okay you guys is to get the

208
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,599
asparagus shoot

209
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:22,720
to actually reach up for the sun that's

210
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,960
what fiber's for the fiber in a plant

211
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,560
isn't there to save your life it's a

212
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,280
good thing

213
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,599
fiber is a good thing if fiber's not a

214
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,440
terrible thing fiber is not a bad thing

215
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,599
no no no

216
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,240
it's not

217
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:41,519
fiber is a good thing but the fiber is

218
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:44,800
to bring the plant to the sun it's the

219
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:48,240
skeleton is what it is and it's bringing

220
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:50,959
the plant to the sun so that the platzo

221
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,920
fiber in here

222
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:56,240
you won't be able to digest the fiber

223
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,320
the fiber will be just eliminated and

224
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,839
we'll be you'll be eliminating it you'll

225
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,240
be getting it out of your body when you

226
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:05,040
go to bathroom

227
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,360
but the fiber

228
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:12,080
is a skeleton

229
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:16,000
of the plant to get the plant to have

230
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:19,440
to have stability and strength to to to

231
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,920
not just lay like this on the ground the

232
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,160
fiber is to help the plant actually

233
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,760
become something right

234
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,920
that's what it's for

235
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,320
it's critical to know this

236
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:33,200
but the medicine that stops you from

237
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,040
getting sick is not the fiber the

238
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,399
medicine that stops you from getting

239
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,320
sick is the phytochemical compounds

240
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,200
is to trace minerals

241
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,920
fiber is not a trace mineral

242
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,360
fiber is not a trace mineral fiber is

243
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,440
not zinc

244
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,519
fiber

245
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,200
is not zinc

246
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:57,120
fiber's not boron

247
00:09:53,200 --> 00:10:01,040
fiber isn't magnesium

248
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:04,160
fiber's not anthocyanins

249
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:07,920
fiber is not resveratrol

250
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:10,079
fiber's not vitamin c fiber is not b12

251
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,519
fibers does this make any sense

252
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,760
fiber is not

253
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,760
phytochemical compounds that stop cancer

254
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,560
and stop disease

255
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:21,200
fiber is not antiviral compounds and

256
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:23,360
antibacterial compounds that's not fiber

257
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:27,040
did you guys know that it's those things

258
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,040
that stop disease and illness

259
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,800
fiber

260
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,560
is the skeleton

261
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,800
of the plant

262
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,160
so the plant can stand up straight and

263
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,200
get some sun

264
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,200
that's what fibrous

265
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,920
fiber is similar not the same thing

266
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,320
but similar by the way my skeleton lost

267
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,320
the leg

268
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,200
fiber

269
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,800
is similar to your bones

270
00:10:53,200 --> 00:11:00,040
your bones

271
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:00,040
are there so you can stand up straight

272
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,720
that's what your bones are there for so

273
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,720
you can stand up straight it's there for

274
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,519
the animal to stand up straight it's

275
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:12,320
there for the dog to stand up straight

276
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:15,440
the dog's fiber really is the bones of

277
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:18,240
the dog right so the dog can stand up

278
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,880
straight so the pig can stand up

279
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,320
straight that's the fiber that's part of

280
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,920
it meaning that's what it's like for

281
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,000
plants it's not exactly like that

282
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,800
totally like for humans but but that's

283
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,600
what i'm using its example

284
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:34,320
fiber in the plant is so the plant can

285
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,800
get to the sun so it can be seen so it

286
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,680
can rise above the other plants so

287
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:43,440
they're having a fiber war plants have a

288
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:45,920
fiber war to try to rise up off the

289
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,720
ground so they can get the sun and they

290
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:52,240
can get what they need so they can

291
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:56,120
create those nutrients

292
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,120
it's critical to know

293
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,480
right

294
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,800
good to see you guys by the way i'm

295
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:06,399
going to be juicing some celery

296
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:08,160
i'm going to talk about the mm-900 hds

297
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:11,680
fiber

298
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:14,160
can't be digested at all

299
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,600
when you have nothing wrong with your

300
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,079
gut

301
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,560
you can still go to bathroom

302
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,360
no matter what you can go to bathroom if

303
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,079
just

304
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,800
water goes in you if just juice goes in

305
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:29,360
you it's just a liquid goes in you it's

306
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,440
just bread goes in you if dough it's

307
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,959
doughnuts

308
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,720
i know people that don't have anything

309
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,720
wrong with their gut they don't have all

310
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,880
the bad bacteria that ripped apart their

311
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,279
gut they don't have all kinds of

312
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,200
different viruses yet they don't have

313
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:45,200
these things they don't have metals in

314
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,279
their brain messing up their peristaltic

315
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,200
action so because they don't have that

316
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,320
yet and maybe they're working on it but

317
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,680
they don't have it maybe they're working

318
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,040
on catching a virus maybe they're

319
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,279
working on catching bacteria maybe

320
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,440
they're working on catching so i mean

321
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:59,279
getting contamination by something but

322
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,560
what happens is they can still go to

323
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:03,760
bathroom

324
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,720
they can eat bread and butter and drink

325
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,959
beer

326
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,360
and they'll be on the toilet go in the

327
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:12,560
bathroom as if nothing was wrong they

328
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,560
didn't need any fiber

329
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,680
because

330
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,600
and then there's people that get all the

331
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,760
fiber you want but they can lose all

332
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,560
peristaltic action you guys this is

333
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:25,519
important to know there's people okay

334
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,360
that have that that eat all the fiber

335
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,200
you can put all the fiber you want in

336
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,079
them but they've got no peristaltic

337
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,240
action they can't go to bathroom they're

338
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,720
still in there because they're inflamed

339
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,839
they have problems inside the gut

340
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:42,360
problems

341
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:47,760
juicing helps to fix but meanwhile the

342
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:50,160
anti-juicing world the fiber freaks

343
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,920
the fiber cult

344
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:56,399
the fiber cult

345
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:58,720
yeah the fiber cold the fiber freaks

346
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,560
they want to scare you

347
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,320
people can put all the fiber they want

348
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,920
but if they got something corking out

349
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,839
their vagus nerve if they got

350
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,000
peristaltic action that died because

351
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:10,240
they got gastroparesis because they got

352
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,440
severe problems they got neurological

353
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,040
problems that aren't allowing

354
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,680
gastroparesis

355
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,839
fiber can't fix it

356
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:21,120
in fact they can't even eat fiber it

357
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,120
moistens their condition

358
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,519
and here's the irony fibers in

359
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:29,120
everything you're never going to be

360
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:31,199
fiber free 100 unless you want to go on

361
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,360
bread you want to go on bread you're

362
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:35,279
never going to get any fiber sure

363
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,959
you can go on a loaf of bread got some

364
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,480
mock bread right here

365
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:42,360
some fake bread

366
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,360
you can go on some bread

367
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,199
i'm talking about processed white bread

368
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:53,279
not talking about whole grain fibrous

369
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:56,079
bread

370
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:58,240

all the good things you're having i want

384
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:28,079
people to get fiber but i'm not saying

385
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:29,880
get fiber i'm saying get your antiviral

386
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:32,000
medicine get your

387
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:35,040
antibacterial medicine

388
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,800
get your phytochemical compounds and

389
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:41,759
your trace mineral salts get those right

390
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:44,320
get your critical glucose get your

391
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:47,680
sulfur which is a chemical compound and

392
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:50,240
say a food like cabbage cruciferous

393
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:53,040
chemical compounds like sulfur get that

394
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,800
in your life get anti-viral compounds

395
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,680
fiber

396
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:00,720
that's automatically there

397
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:03,279
that's automatically there

398
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,880
so we need other things from all the

399
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,639
fruits and vegetables leafy greens and

400
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,199
wild foods and everything else and herbs

401
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,199
we get we need more

402
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:14,160
we're getting more than fiber

403
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:16,320
fiber's an in it's a guarantee unless

404
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,759
there's somebody just unprocessed flour

405
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,720
only like i know some people and they

406
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:24,160
still go to bathroom fine

407
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:26,639
it's a guarantee you're fibered out

408
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,839
you've got plenty of fiber going in

409
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,880
there

410
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:33,120
you're eating your fiber it's there if

411
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:36,000
you can't go to bathroom we got another

412
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,240
problem we got inflammation around the

413
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,639
bend

414
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,639
this is a highway right here and if you

415
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,399
picture a car going through here it's

416
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:47,519
like this

417
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,519
whoa go around that bend

418
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,600
oh

419
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,960
and that's what's happening is the car

420
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,759
is going through here

421
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,920
[Music]

422
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:02,720
all around the bend right and all of a

423
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,880
sudden you've got food and it's going

424
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,039
uh

425
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,160
and it's stuck

426
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:11,120
that means

427
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,120
something's wrong

428
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,839
and you've been eating fiber your whole

429
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,319
life you can go and get the greasiest

430
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:20,319
double bacon double cheeseburger and

431
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,839
they'll be probably still more fiber in

432
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:24,640
that greasy

433
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:26,400
gross bacon double cheeseburger

434
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,199
then you can think of there's still some

435
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,199
fiber in there

436
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,720
but if you can't go to bathroom anymore

437
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,480
you got something stuck

438
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,039
you got a problem in there or you're

439
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,280
getting a mixed signal it's mixed it's

440
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:42,400
coming from the vagus nerve so the vagus

441
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,240
nerves

442
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,760
right are shooting out of your brain

443
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,559
stem

444
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:50,960
two vagus nerves

445
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,480
coming out of your brain stem

446
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,559
two

447
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,559
right

448
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:58,720
you got your vagus nerves coming out of

449
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,799
your brain stem and they're coming down

450
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,559
all through here they're rerouting and

451
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:04,880
they're sending signals to your gut and

452
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:07,360
they're telling your gut to peristaltic

453
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:10,400
action you've got a peristaltic action

454
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:12,640
go ahead and twist twist and turn get

455
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,080
the get the poo to move through get

456
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,840
whatever it is you're eating to move

457
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,360
through get your food to move through

458
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,120
get your fiber to move through whatever

459
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:22,080
you want to call it get it to move

460
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,679
through and if it's not moving through

461
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,000
we're inflamed

462
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:28,240
or there's a miss messages mixed

463
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,760
messages coming from the brain through

464
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:35,039
the vagus nerves on down the path to the

465
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:38,160
intestinal tract and guess what

466
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,160
we have a problem

467
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,679
and that's what's going on

468
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,760
so then

469
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,360
you talk to a health professional and

470
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,000
the health professional is just going to

471
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:52,640
be like you know like

472
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,360
oh all you need is a little bit of fiber

473
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,840
did you increase your water

474
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,679
how many times do i have to insult you

475
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,320
you probably never tried to increase

476
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,760
water yet oh you have

477
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,320
oh what do you mean it's the first thing

478
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,080
you learned nonsense

479
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,360
you didn't increase your water or your

480
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,520
fiber

481
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:14,400
increase your water and your fiber

482
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:17,520
if that doesn't fix it it's your jeans

483
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,919
you're just a broken toy

484
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:24,160
you're just broken your jeans are broken

485
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:26,320
if fiber and water doesn't fix it

486
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,960
then maybe you have lectin problems oh

487
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:31,360
wait a minute maybe you have celacic

488
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,799
acid problems i read an article about

489
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,280
that

490
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:36,160
maybe you got oxalate issues

491
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,640
oh

492
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:41,120
can't go to bathroom probably oxalate

493
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,120
issues

494
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,440
anyway

495
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,880
the one thing to know there's a lot of

496
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,120
different important things to think

497
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,760
about okay

498
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:54,000
the one thing to know

499
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,960
is that you can't fall into the fiber

500
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,280
trap you're getting fiber

501
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,840
you're getting fiber you can go to bed

502
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,840
at night and recite it to yourself

503
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,480
you're getting fiber

504
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,880
but you know what you're not getting if

505
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,559
you're not juicing your celery juice

506
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,280
you're not getting the sodium cluster

507
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:14,720
salts that are anti-viral antibacterial

508
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,000
you're not getting the vitamin c that

509
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,120
doesn't have to be converted by the

510
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
liver

511
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:22,880
you're not getting the things you need

512
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:27,120
and that's critical to know

513
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:29,919
pathogens inflame the intestinal tract

514
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:32,640
pathogens inflame the intestinal tract

515
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:36,080
so what happens is we get pathogens

516
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,440
inside the intestinal intestinal tract

517
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,880
there they go

518
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,159
and they get in there they find their

519
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,080
way in there and they find their way

520
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,240
real easy too they get into that

521
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,640
intestinal tract real easy they get into

522
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,720
the colon really easy when they get in

523
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,720
there and they're in

524
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,720
you've got colitis

525
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:56,880
you've got celiac

526
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:58,960
you got ibs you got sibo you got crohn's

527
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,200
you've got gastric spasms you've got

528
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:04,559
gastroparesis you've got all kinds of

529
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,960
other things it's it's the bugs inside

530
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:09,039
your gut and those bugs can get in there

531
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,120
and cause a lot of problems and if

532
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:13,600
that's not all it's the heavy metals

533
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,679
that get inside the brain and all those

534
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:18,080
toxic heavy metals and they're sending

535
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,919
signals down your vagus nerves shooting

536
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,520
out of your brain stem under here so

537
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:23,840
right under here you've got your vagus

538
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,520
nerves and the signal's going out and as

539
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,440
the signal is going out

540
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,840
you're getting a message to here that's

541
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,280
not making it twist so we're not

542
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,799
twisting

543
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,799
we're not twisting anymore

544
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,039
and if you're eating gluten you're

545
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:43,280
feeding the pathogen so it only gets

546
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,720
worse

547
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,600
fiber

548
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:50,080
won't fix it because it can't be an

549
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:53,600
antiviral your fiber's not an

550
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:55,520
antibacterial your fiber is not medicine

551
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,840
i love it when someone wakes up one

552
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:00,960
morning and they come out of a stupor in

553
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:04,080
the health field somebody maybe an md or

554
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,840
an nd or some kind of practitioner or a

555
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,760
dietitian they wake up one morning and

556
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,799
they're like

557
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,799
i think i got the problem it's fiber

558
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:14,720
i'm going to do an article now about how

559
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:17,280
fiber is so important and let me

560
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,440
research all the other bs about fiber

561
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,840
that's been talked about for years it's

562
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,080

fiber is the skeleton of the plant

591

obtain which is actually being able to

609
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:26,720
bring our lives back from juicing

610
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:29,279
this is a medicine maker you're seeing

611
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,039
herbal medicine be made in front of your

612
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:32,559
eyes right now sure we can take it for

613
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,400
granted

614
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,559
we can take it for granted

615
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:39,039
i can take this machine for granted i

616
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:40,720
can take juicing celery for granted

617
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,159
definitely

618
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,240
but when you really think what's

619
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:47,520
happening it's pretty incredible

620
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:50,080
go back to a few hundred years ago go

621
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,600
back to a few hundred years ago right

622
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,360
okay

623
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:56,159
you got someone that's trying to pull

624
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,120
water out of a well a muddy well

625
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,480
right

626
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,679
think about it

627
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,559
okay

628
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,400
and

629
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:03,440
they're slaughtering the only animal

630
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,640
they have

631
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,400
to survive

632
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,720
they're slaughtering their cow that

633
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,000
creates the dairy they need because it's

634
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,600
the winter

635
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,559
right

636
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:16,480
and they're they're now cooking animal

637
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,600
meat which i'm not against animal

638
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,600
protein eaters i'm not against

639
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,480
plant-based people right

640
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,039
okay

641
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,640
they got some leftover

642
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:27,600
grain

643
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:31,600
got some leftover barley or wheat most

644
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:34,400
likely wheat they got leftover wheat

645
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:37,440
so they have leftover wheat

646
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:39,520
they get some well water from their well

647
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,279
muddy well water

648
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:44,240
they're cooking their last animals to

649
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:46,320
survive to get to spring right

650
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,799
and if you if you knocked on their door

651
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,559
on that colonial house

652
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:52,960
and knocked down that door or wherever

653
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:55,120
they were in this world and you knocked

654
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,559
on their door and you went back in the

655
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,279
past because you're from the future

656
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:03,039
you're from 2021 and you went back in

657
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:04,480
the past and you knocked on that door

658
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:07,279
he said i want to show you guys

659
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:09,200
something and you had a stack of celery

660
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:11,360
and you brought this machine in and

661
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,919
magically had the ability to have power

662
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,600
because the story is

663
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,320
magical anyway

664
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:20,480
and you popped a juicer in front of them

665
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,440
and you said

666
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,440
we're going to clear up your

667
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,520

scurvy we're gonna get rid of any scurvy

00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:35,200
we're gonna get rid of rickets

672
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:36,960
your children aren't gonna be deficient

00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,600
we're gonna give you a fresh glass of

674
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,440
celery juice right out of the future and

675
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,279
we're going to juice it in an herbal

676
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,279
medicine maker

677
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:48,559
they would probably

678
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,559
have a heart attack

679
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,720
because their mind would be so blown

680
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,360
you couldn't

681
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,480
even when you really think about your

682
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,480
mind would be so blown

683
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,640
you guys

684
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,600
i don't i don't take it for granted i

685
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,600
know what this is

686
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:15,200
it's a way to bring back our health

687
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:17,919
it's a way to take control over our

688
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,919
lives right

689
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:22,320
and that's what this is and that's

690
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:24,640
what's really special about it

691
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,480
that's just one thing

692
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,880
but i love when nobody knows why

693
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,760
anybody's big

694
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,919
but they got so many answers out there

695
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,279
so many answers they don't know why

696
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:38,080
anybody's sick

697
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,080
nobody knows

698
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,000
it's all a guessing game

699
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:49,840
mary says doesn't fiber move poo out of

700
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,840
the system

701
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:58,399
fiber doesn't move poo out of the system

702
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,240
your intestinal tract moves the poo out

703
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:01,760
of your system

704
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,159
you can be somebody

705
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:06,480
that's literally on white bread

706
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:08,320
processed bread dough

707
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,880
doughnuts

708
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,919
and your peristaltic action

709
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,120
you're gonna you could be somebody

710
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:16,799
that's on meat which has no fiber in it

711
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,120
and you're gonna in your peristaltic

712
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:21,360
action if it's working mary

713
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,559
it's gonna push the meat out and the

714
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,080
dough

715
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:26,960
you can be somebody that lives off of

716
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,840
white bread meat sandwiches

717
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:32,080
white

718
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:34,080
processed bread meat sandwiches

719
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:36,320
and you can be eating a white bread meat

720
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:38,960
sandwich and people will poo it out

721
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:42,320
because their peristaltic action is is

722
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:45,279
doing the contorting act to get it out

723
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,880
and squeeze it out you can be on just

724
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:48,960
meat

725
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,880
plain old meat

726
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,480
and you literally your if your

727
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,720
peristaltic action is working because

728
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:57,039
you don't have any problems you'll be

729
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,120
getting it out but if you can't

730
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,960
poo because you need all this fiber then

731
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:05,279
you have a problem

732
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:06,880
a problem that you're using fiber as a

733
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:09,440
tool

734
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,679
because you can't go anymore because you

735
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,600
actually have a physical problem going

736
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:15,679
inside the body making it so you can't

737
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,799
go to bathroom

738
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,399
so then

739
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:20,480
you might be somebody or anybody that

740
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:22,159
ends up knocking on some doctors george

741
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,399
is greater practitioner's door and read

742
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:26,159
an article and it says don't juice

743
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:28,240
because it minim it gets rid of the

744
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:30,000
fiber and all of a sudden you're scared

745
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,000
but the juicing is what fixes the

746
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,240
problem inside the intestinal tract in

747
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,080
the gut so that you can get peristaltic

748
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,520
action to go to bathroom without having

749
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,279
any fiber

750
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,279
and be like someone who doesn't have a

751
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:43,440
problem in their intestinal tract i know

752
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,960
some people they can live off of donuts

753
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,919
and they'll poo it out just fine they

754
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,279
don't have any problems like fiber

755
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,279
they're like what

756
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:53,120
we need fiber for

757
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:56,640
is that just a new age word they'll be

758
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:59,120
like whatever i'm going to bathroom fine

759
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:01,039
but does your health get worse if you're

760
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:04,240
just on white bread yes for other

761
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:07,120
reasons because you don't get protected

762
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:09,279
by the antiviral compounds and the

763
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:11,799
medicine and the trace mineral salt you

764
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:13,520
don't get protected by the by the by the

765
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:15,679
anthocyanins right there see the

766
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,919
anthocyanins right there you don't get

767
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:20,320
protected by the anthocyanins

768
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:22,720
you see them right that's the purple you

769
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:25,600
don't get protected by those those are

770
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,679
the antioxidants those are the antiviral

771
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:30,000
compounds antibacterial compounds and

772
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:32,559
trace mineral salts

773
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,200
so what you'll find with the mm-900 is

774
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:38,080
it saves you money and the pulp comes

775
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,679
out dry that's what happens the pulp

776
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,360
comes out dry

777
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:45,840
it's it's not

778
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:47,520
it's not sopping wet you have a dry bowl

779
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,200
got a dry ball

780
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:51,760
link is in profile link is in the

781
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:54,240
description on on the juicer it's coming

782
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:57,200
down to the end of the sale

783
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,720
and i can't express how important

784
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,320
juicing is

785
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,159
for somebody to stay healthy and if

786
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,760
someone has talked out of juicing in

787
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:05,600
their life

788
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:08,960
use any juicer you have forget the

789
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:11,679
mm-900 the mm-900 saves people money it

790
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:13,840
squeezes every last drop it pulverizes

791
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:17,120
like no other juicer does

792
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:18,799
but if you have any juicer i'll take it

793
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:21,600
i'm on board

794
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:23,200
i'm on board keep the juicer you have

795
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,120
if you have any juicer i don't care if

796
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,039
it's a ten dollar juicer and it's got a

797
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,320
crank on it and you're and you're doing

798
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:30,559
a ten dollar juicer and you've got a

799
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:32,799
crank on it i will be patting you on the

800
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:34,880
back until you don't even get the mm-900

801
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:37,919
fine just keep what you're doing because

802
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:40,880
you're juicing and it's the juicing part

803
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:42,559
yeah this is an incredible machine

804
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,360
it saves you money you end up saved and

805
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:48,399
it pays for itself and and basically you

806
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:50,159
get into a dry ball of pulp and it and

807
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:52,080
and you're now buying half the celery

808
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:53,519
and half this and half that and if you

809
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,200
want to juice something else like a

810
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:57,120
carrot you're buying less carrots you're

811
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,279
buying less cucumbers right but the

812
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,799
point is in pomegranate the same thing

813
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:04,399
you bring less pomegranate and it adds

814
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:07,360
up adds up big time in the food prices

815
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:08,960
are going up so this machine became like

816
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,960
this blessing

817
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,360
it became this blessing

818
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:16,080
the mm-900 hds

819
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,840
i endorsed it i endorsed the company

820
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,120
because i know what it's doing and i

821
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,799
know what it's doing for people but if

822
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,159
you have any juicer you guys i stand

823
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:24,000

get the mm-900

829
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:38,799
because i know how important juicing is

830
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:43,440
if i don't have passion towards the

831
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:45,760
juicing and if i don't have a mission

832
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:48,000
towards the juicing how is it going to

833
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:50,080
stay alive to keep people alive because

834
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,039
there's always an attack

835
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:55,760
to take the good down out there with

836
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:57,679
celery juice don't add anything

837
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:00,640
don't add anything i love how the pulp

838
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:02,080
is dry i just love that it's my favorite

839
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,159
it's my favorite thing

840
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:06,720
it's barely it's damp it's it's

841
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:08,799
incredible how that works right

842
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,799
don't put any ice in there don't put any

843
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:12,640

844
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:15,440

00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:23,039
right now

849
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,360
throw it in a glass mug to show you

850
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,880
right

851
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:36,399
always strain it

852
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,240
16 to 32 ounces

853
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:39,200
right

854
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,840
and

855
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:44,000
empty stomach first thing in the morning

856
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,519
it's herbal medicine

857
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,880
that's what it is

858
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:50,880
it's herbal medicine at its best and

859
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,399
keep that in mind

860
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,200
how long will it keep us see on tick

861
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,399
tock

862
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,799
i mean you could put it in the in the

863
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:58,640
fridge for for a day

864
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:00,720
you want to drink it right away but i've

865
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,880
had celery juice in the fridge for three

866
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,799
days and i've consumed it and still

867
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:07,279
beats anything in the store that's in a

868
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:09,119
bottle or anything

869
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:11,679
so

870
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:15,200
so why does julie really good question i

871
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:17,119
want to answer that one it's fantastic

872
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,159
fiber doesn't feed first of all julia

873
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:19,760
want to answer that question but i want

874
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,240
to talk about something fiber doesn't

875
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:25,599
feed good bacteria

876
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:28,159
fiber cannot be broken down

877
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:31,040
it can't be consumed

878
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:34,079
so you we need to know how that works

879
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:36,560
that's a theory because you because the

880
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:38,639
theorists in medicine and health they

881
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,520
don't want to lose the fiber

882
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:41,760
tune

883
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,839
they want to sing the fiber tune over

884
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,119
and over again like

885
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:47,520
fiber

886
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:49,119
yeah fiber is everything it's fiber

887
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,879
right they don't want to lose that so

888
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:52,560
all of a sudden now we've learned about

889
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:54,879
there's good bacteria in the gut i bet

890
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,480
you fiber has a lot to do with that what

891
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:58,800
else right

892
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,640
hey vitamin d is important for people i

893
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,720
bet your fiber has everything to do with

894
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:05,440
that vitamin d being important okay what

895
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:07,680
else um people need vitamin c fiber i

896
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:10,000
bet you is everything to do with that um

897
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:12,880
people need it's fiber see they they

898
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,560
just lump it all into each other without

899
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:17,440
knowing why anybody's sick or how to

900
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:21,119
heal right

901
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:23,359
so fiber doesn't feed bacteria fiber

902
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:26,560
gets discarded

903
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:30,240
it gets discarded because it's waste and

904
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:32,560
it doesn't have any nutrients in it

905
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:34,320
that's how it works with fiber your body

906
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:36,240
can't break it down can't digest it nor

907
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,760
can bacteria can't break down and digest

908
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,200
fiber

909
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,280
it can't

910
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:43,599
fiber stays fiber

911
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,760
is what it does

912
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:48,240
very important now

913
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:50,320
but good bacteria

914
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:53,440
feeds on

915
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,480
the juice that cracked

916
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,760
out

917
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:59,760
of the pulp of something

918
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:02,240
you bite a lemon

919
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:05,440
you bite the lemon pulp you squeeze that

920
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:09,280
lemon juice in that good bacteria

921
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:13,440
will feed off of that lemon juice

922
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:16,800
good bacteria feeds off of the juices of

923
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:19,599
those important phytochemical compounds

924
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,359
of those important vegetables and fruits

925
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:25,599
and leafy greens and herbs

926
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:27,839
good bacteria feeds off the juices

927
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:30,160
you want to save any good bacteria you

928
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:32,000
make sure you give them lots of juice

929
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,440
that's how it works so there's a

930
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:37,359
question about coffee i don't want to

931
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:38,560
lose why does coffee move things

932
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:40,480
there's a question right here i think it

933
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:43,119
was on youtube or facebook why does

934
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:45,839
coffee move things

935
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:49,280
coffee moves things because coffee

936
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:51,760
stimulates your adrenals

937
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,920
caffeine makes your adrenals dump

938
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:56,560
epinephrine into your bloodstream

939
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:58,560
epinephrine is fight or flight

940
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:02,320
and you have to poo

941
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,320
while you're either getting killed

942
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,960
or you're running from someone trying to

943
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,200
kill you

944
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,359
see how it works

945
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:13,920
when you get scared

946
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:17,520
you your pants

947
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:20,320
there's a reason why that term exists

948
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:22,800
when you get scared out of your mind you

949
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:25,680
 your pants

950
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,839
you pee your pants

951
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:31,599
the reason why you pee

952
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:33,040
and poo your pants when you get scared

953
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:36,240
to death

954
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:38,160
is because that's an adrenaline reaction

955
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,560
to empty you

956
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:42,480
so you can have more ability to fight

957
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:46,000
and run

958
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,000
someone comes to attack you

959
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:51,440
you need to evacuate

960
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:54,720
animals in the wild

961
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:56,400
eliminate everything inside of them

962
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,240
before the deer

963
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,800
you chase a deer

964
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:03,200
if a wolf chases a deer the deer will

965
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,760
empty out its entire

966
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:07,839
innards basically

967
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,320
all the deer poop will go flying out of

968
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:12,079
the deer as it's running it's fight or

969
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,680
flight

970
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:16,160
we have it too

971
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,760
when you drink caffeine you told your

972
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:20,000
adrenals

973
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:23,119
were fight or flight you're either gonna

974
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:26,240
get killed or be killed or run

975
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:28,079
kill or be killed or whatever

976
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:31,119
fight or flight whatever

977
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:32,960
and so coffee all that caffeine makes

978
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:35,040
the adrenals go oh my god there's a

979
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:38,880
problem oh i gotta go to the bathroom

980
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,880
now i gotta do my bowel movement

981
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:44,839
caffeine's a poison too

982
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:49,359
and poisons need to be

983
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:49,359
eliminated so it's a combination of that

984
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,720
you know what's interesting about

985
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:58,079
medical medium information

986
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,079
thank god you guys know this

987
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:02,079
but it's information you won't hear

988
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,560
anywhere else and

989
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:07,520
and melton said that

990
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,520
milton just said

991
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:11,760
this info you won't hear anywhere else

992
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:16,960
i'm honored truly i am

993
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,400
warms my heart you know that it really

994
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,720
does

995
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,720
and people steal it and they won't cite

996
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:25,359
it back trust me that will be all

997
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:27,040
through the vegan movement in about

998
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:29,839
the vegans especially like a vegan

999
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:31,200
movement people not vegans

1000
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:33,200
but like

1001
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:35,119
the people trying to get to the top of

1002
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:37,359
the vegan movement you know to become a

1003
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:39,760
speaker or a book writer or whatever it

1004
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:42,480
is right it's happened the last 35 years

1005
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:44,880
they love taking medical medium tidbits

1006
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,160
injecting it into the vegan movement

1007
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:49,119
and then telling other people don't

1008
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:51,040
listen to that medical medium

1009
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:53,200
that's classic actually with the vegan

1010
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:55,359
movement

1011
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:57,680
i think you know what happens is that

1012
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:59,359
and again i'm pro-vegan pro-plant-based

1013
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:02,400
and i'm also pro-animal protein a

1014
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:04,480
pro-pescetarian i'm pro-vegetarian

1015
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,000
vegetarians can eat terrible

1016
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,200
