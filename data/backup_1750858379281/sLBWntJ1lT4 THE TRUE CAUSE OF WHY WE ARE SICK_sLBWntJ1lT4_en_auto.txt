[0.00 - 3.68] get sick what are the causes of sickness
[1.68 - 5.76] why does everybody go around
[3.68 - 7.28] looking for answers and they think they
[5.76 - 9.04] have an answer but they really don't
[7.28 - 10.88] have an answer and then they stay sick
[9.04 - 12.96] another two months another six months
[10.88 - 15.44] and then two years go by and then five
[12.96 - 17.04] years go by and then 10 years go by i
[15.44 - 19.92] remember people coming to my office many
[17.04 - 22.48] years ago with 30 years have gone by
[19.92 - 24.32] sick hashimoto's thyroid problems on
[22.48 - 26.00] thyroid medications all kinds of blood

[31.68 - 35.60] depression it's like how long you've
[32.96 - 37.68] been sick been sick for 25 years i'm
[35.60 - 39.60] like oh my god and then they get the
[37.68 - 41.20] answers and things start going away and
[39.60 - 44.16] as things start going away they go
[41.20 - 47.12] anthony why didn't i find you 25 years
[44.16 - 50.00] ago and i'm like well
[47.12 - 52.56] since this is 25 years ago
[50.00 - 55.52] uh 25 years before that i would have
[52.56 - 57.12] been very little so the point is is
[55.52 - 59.36] people just they go around they look
[57.12 - 61.52] around if they're trying to find help
[59.36 - 63.12] and they can't find the answers and yet
[61.52 - 64.88] this is a special time and it's not
[63.12 - 66.72] about me it's not because i'm special or
[64.88 - 69.68] anything like that is because
[66.72 - 71.84] we have answers now it's it's the
[69.68 - 73.84] information i get from the source i hear
[71.84 - 76.24] right whether somebody likes that or not
[73.84 - 79.36] or somebody thinks it sounds kind of you
[76.24 - 82.00] know crazy or whatever it is a fact it's
[79.36 - 85.20] a fact since age four i've been hearing
[82.00 - 87.44] a voice that voice tells me why people
[85.20 - 88.80] are sick and what's wrong and what they
[87.44 - 91.60] need and

[128.16 - 131.76] everything nacho waffles man it was
[130.40 - 133.84] crazy it was incredible cold white
[131.76 - 135.68] spring good to see you right you see the
[133.84 - 137.68] moose cold night spring may you see the
[135.68 - 140.56] moose yeah
[137.68 - 142.08] it's pretty funny right so
[140.56 - 144.00] nat says anthony can you help me with
[142.08 - 145.68] trigeminal neuralgia please been
[144.00 - 147.28] following protocol for two months no
[145.68 - 149.12] results yet so here's what happens now
[147.28 - 150.48] with trigeminal neuralgia right i've
[149.12 - 152.16] talked to a lot of doctors about this
[150.48 - 153.44] that have come to me because they i know
[152.16 - 155.52] doctors that deal with trigeminal
[153.44 - 156.88] neuralgia and they in their cases lots
[155.52 - 158.40] of cases and i've taught them a lot of
[156.88 - 160.64] things and one thing that's critical to
[158.40 - 162.16] know about trigeminal neuralgia
[160.64 - 164.56] is that you can have the shingles virus
[162.16 - 166.72] causing trigeminal neuralgia and you can
[164.56 - 168.80] even have the simplex one fever blister
[166.72 - 170.88] cold sore that you don't even see so you
[168.80 - 173.92] don't even have the cold sore or fever
[170.88 - 175.44] blister but it's in the nerves it's in
[173.92 - 176.56] the cranial nerve so let's do this a
[175.44 - 178.32] little bit because we're going to talk
[176.56 - 179.60] about this now why do we get trigeminal
[178.32 - 182.64] neuralgia
[179.60 - 185.36] because of a low-grade viral infection a
[182.64 - 187.28] low-grade viral infection and that
[185.36 - 188.64] low-grade viral infection are these
[187.28 - 190.24] little bugs right here that's the
[188.64 - 191.68] low-grade viral infection right here
[190.24 - 193.92] it's these bugs
[191.68 - 196.80] and these bugs sit inside of us right
[193.92 - 200.16] and so it takes time for some stubborn
[196.80 - 202.24] stubborn trigeminal neuralgia cases take
[200.16 - 203.52] time gotta make sure there's no gluten
[202.24 - 205.44] there you gotta make sure there's no
[203.52 - 207.68] eggs in there you gotta make sure
[205.44 - 211.04] there's no dairy products you gotta make
[207.68 - 213.36] sure that you're keeping the fats low
[211.04 - 215.60] low you got to make sure and then
[213.36 - 217.84] protocols what protocols are you on
[215.60 - 218.96] right and that's important too
[217.84 - 220.88] right
[218.96 - 223.04] how far are you on the protocol what's
[220.88 - 225.04] going on there if i had trigeminal
[223.04 - 226.56] neuralgia i'd be doing the protocol and
[225.04 - 227.68] i would be you know taking a look in
[226.56 - 230.16] here and you'll see all the different
[227.68 - 232.00] stuff with the protocol right here and
[230.16 - 233.76] you make sure you're on your vitamin c
[232.00 - 235.52] make sure you're on there b12 you make
[233.76 - 236.96] sure you're on your your different
[235.52 - 239.28] things that you need
[236.96 - 240.48] zinc is critical too now ask your doctor
[239.28 - 242.48] what's right for you but if i had
[240.48 - 243.52] trigeminal neuralgia
[242.48 - 246.80] i'd be
[243.52 - 248.80] i'd be 100 fat free if it was bad if i
[246.80 - 250.56] was suffering 100
[248.80 - 253.28] no fats right
[250.56 - 255.84] i'd be doing i'd be doing the papaya
[253.28 - 257.84] banana mono cleanse possibly be doing
[255.84 - 259.52] the heavy metal detox smoothie i'd have
[257.84 - 262.00] that in there you know you can pick and
[259.52 - 264.24] choose what you feel like doing but you
[262.00 - 265.76] can get there one thing's for sure is
[264.24 - 267.28] i'd stay away from the eggs the gluten
[265.76 - 268.72] the dairy products if i had a
[267.28 - 271.44] neurologist stay away from all of that
[268.72 - 273.84] keep the fats down to zero if you can
[271.44 - 276.08] and then get the antivirals in that are
[273.84 - 278.32] in cleanse the heal right because you're
[276.08 - 280.72] looking at knocking out that shingles
[278.32 - 282.96] virus and that and the
[280.72 - 284.96] simplex virus you're looking at knocking
[282.96 - 286.96] those out so you can do a simplex
[284.96 - 288.96] protocol you can be doing the shingles
[286.96 - 290.56] protocol so that's the one you want and
[288.96 - 291.84] cleanse the heal take it to your doctor
[290.56 - 294.16] ask them what's right for you but the
[291.84 - 297.36] shingles protocol so that's important
[294.16 - 299.36] right there and and sometimes those you
[297.36 - 300.88] know i'll tell you right now i've never
[299.36 - 303.28] seen the needle move for trigeminal
[300.88 - 305.84] neuralgia for anybody out there except
[303.28 - 308.16] for medical medium protocols i've never
[305.84 - 310.00] seen it move i mean i've talked to
[308.16 - 311.68] hundreds of doctors for the last 35
[310.00 - 313.36] years and trigeminal neuralgia is that
[311.68 - 314.96] kind of thing that never budges unless
[313.36 - 317.20] you do the right thing so there are
[314.96 - 320.00] answers you got to stay with it you got
[317.20 - 322.40] to you know learn how to chip away and
[320.00 - 324.56] chip away until those viral that viral
[322.40 - 326.48] inflammation is down and gone and when
[324.56 - 328.48] it's gone all of a sudden you can chew
[326.48 - 330.32] again oh my god i can chew again all of
[328.48 - 332.16] a sudden you can start feeling better
[330.32 - 334.08] what happens is
[332.16 - 335.68] cranial nerves right here so cranial
[334.08 - 338.00] nerves
[335.68 - 340.32] the trigeminal nerve right that's your
[338.00 - 343.04] cranial nerve so trigeminal neuralgia is
[340.32 - 345.20] about an inflamed cranial nerve cranial
[343.04 - 346.72] nerves are why people are sick with so
[345.20 - 348.32] many different things
[346.72 - 349.36] and this is just one thing right there
[348.32 - 350.96] so
[349.36 - 352.88] kimberly miller trying to get back onto
[350.96 - 354.32] the mono cleanse
[352.88 - 355.68] i totally get it it's not easy to get
[354.32 - 357.04] back onto the mono cleanse but i'm
[355.68 - 359.84] really proud of you for trying to do
[357.04 - 361.36] that that's incredible right there um so
[359.84 - 363.36] yeah you guys so let's talk a little bit
[361.36 - 364.96] more about why we're sick just like
[363.36 - 367.92] we're doing now and we'll keep on doing
[364.96 - 370.32] that right there so
[367.92 - 370.32] if you
[370.80 - 374.16] if you're somebody that's been
[372.08 - 376.00] struggling for a long time
[374.16 - 377.84] you've been you've been trying to find
[376.00 - 380.32] answers right
[377.84 - 382.08] you want to know why you're sick and you
[380.32 - 383.76] get answers and you get answers like
[382.08 - 385.52] things like it's all in your gut or
[383.76 - 387.12] something and that's not an answer i've
[385.52 - 388.56] seen this so so many times with people
[387.12 - 391.28] laurie says what causes a burning
[388.56 - 393.44] sensation in the mouth when eating food
[391.28 - 397.12] ebv or something else if i had a burning
[393.44 - 398.80] sensation in my mouth okay
[397.12 - 401.60] so if i had a burning sensation in my
[398.80 - 401.60] mouth right
[401.76 - 407.04] burning sensations i call it burning
[403.52 - 409.84] tongue burning gums burning mouth right
[407.04 - 412.08] that's that right there okay that's a
[409.84 - 413.60] viral issue too so keep that in mind so
[412.08 - 414.96] it's a viral issue when we go to the
[413.60 - 417.12] doctors they don't know what burning
[414.96 - 418.80] mouth burning tongue is they don't know
[417.12 - 420.84] what burning cheeks are they don't know
[418.80 - 422.96] what any of that is
[420.84 - 424.40] and unless they're learning and they're
[422.96 - 425.92] picking up medical medium information
[424.40 - 427.44] because i've noticed that that that's
[425.92 - 429.36] what's happening i noticed that the
[427.44 - 430.16] clinics are taking mm info they've never
[429.36 - 431.92] had
[430.16 - 433.20] they're taking it right out of published
[431.92 - 435.04] medical medium books and they're
[433.20 - 436.88] starting to put it on their websites
[435.04 - 439.12] like information that doesn't have a
[436.88 - 441.28] study behind it but it came from
[439.12 - 443.68] these books right so i noticed that
[441.28 - 445.52] right now there's a big like thirst for
[443.68 - 447.44] stealing information it's actually
[445.52 - 449.60] hilarious but whatever
[447.44 - 451.28] but what happens is when you go to the
[449.60 - 453.04] best clinics and you tell them you've
[451.28 - 454.56] got a burning tongue burning mouth
[453.04 - 455.92] burning gums
[454.56 - 458.40] and they'll just look at you like you're
[455.92 - 460.72] crazy they won't know
[458.40 - 463.44] they won't know that's also trigeminal
[460.72 - 466.00] neuralgia and other cranial nerves that
[463.44 - 467.92] cause the burning tongue burning face
[466.00 - 469.28] you know burning face too burning face
[467.92 - 471.92] burning cheeks
[469.28 - 473.52] burning eyes optic nerves so the burning
[471.92 - 475.36] eyes you feel like you got burning in
[473.52 - 476.40] your forehead burning in back of your
[475.36 - 479.12] eyes
[476.40 - 481.44] all of that right that's all the cranial
[479.12 - 482.88] nerves getting inflamed by viruses it
[481.44 - 485.36] means people walk around with a lot of
[482.88 - 487.20] ebv's shingles simplexes those are the
[485.36 - 489.76] most common for that
[487.20 - 491.68] right there and shingles is a big one
[489.76 - 493.20] right there people don't know about the
[491.68 - 494.56] shingles so cold white springs so maybe
[493.20 - 496.96] you said burning of shingles yeah
[494.56 - 498.72] definitely burning in joy clark i was
[496.96 - 501.36] sick for 35 years of trigeminal
[498.72 - 505.04] neuralgia with hope because i did not
[501.36 - 508.80] have the mm information
[505.04 - 513.12] i do not know how i survived now i am on
[508.80 - 515.84] round 16 of the 369 cleanse yeah
[513.12 - 518.08] zero fat is what moves the needle as
[515.84 - 520.40] well as all the supplements when not on
[518.08 - 522.64] the cleanse so trigeminal neuralgia is a
[520.40 - 524.40] shingles problem so when i look at the
[522.64 - 525.92] supplements i have right here right
[524.40 - 527.92] these are the vimergy supplements it's
[525.92 - 529.04] the best stuff out there so let me open
[527.92 - 530.80] up cleanse the heal let's just hit
[529.04 - 532.08] trigeminal neuralgia because people have
[530.80 - 533.04] it and they don't even know do you guys
[532.08 - 534.48] know that
[533.04 - 536.56] they have jaw pain they don't know it's
[534.48 - 538.32] trigeminal neuralgia they have burning
[536.56 - 539.52] gum burning gum they have a funny
[538.32 - 541.36] feeling on the tongue they don't know
[539.52 - 542.56] it's trigeminal neuralgia
[541.36 - 544.88] they don't know it's their cranial
[542.56 - 546.32] nerves that's what happens right
[544.88 - 548.48] so i'm gonna look for the shingles
[546.32 - 550.96] section right here real quick see if i
[548.48 - 552.64] can find it for you guys right

[580.88 - 585.20] leg syndrome it could be like tingles
[583.28 - 587.76] and numbness it could be neurological
[585.20 - 589.36] fatigue where you're fatigued you guys
[587.76 - 591.12] right you don't have an explanation to
[589.36 - 593.68] why you're fatigued it could be ticks

[615.44 - 620.96] shingles right here okay section the
[618.32 - 623.84] shingles virus is the true cause of
