1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,160
without right there the propolis pure

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:07,620

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,679
because it does the lemon balms and

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,360

00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:15,599

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,280
it's like Supreme quality that's what

84
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,260
counts because everybody can just say

85
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,780

86
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:36,120
shittiest crappiest piece of crap

87
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:38,519
supplement out there and call it quality

88
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,799
now that's how the world works right you

89
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:42,780
can put out the worst stuff the worst

90
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,000
quality crap and you can use the term

91
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:47,040
quality that's what supplement companies

92
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
do now they'll use oh quality our

93
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:53,459
quality is there oh sure sure there's a

94
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,280
lot of things that determine real true

95
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:58,440
quality one of the one of the things

96
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,140
that determines it is not putting in

97
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,860
hidden ingredients hidden ingredients in

98
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,739
there

99
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:06,900
like ingredients that are not disclosed

100
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:10,260
on the bottle and supplement companies

101
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:12,299
put up to 10 percent of crap inside

102
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,620
their supplements and they don't tell

103
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:15,900
anybody they don't disclose it or

104
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,579
anything that's one of the most

105
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,919
important things to know right there

106
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:22,560
that takes you into like what's called

107
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:24,060
real quality anyway before I start

108
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,860
reading about the quickening I want to

109
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,360
talk about that I just want it to go

110
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,360
over

111
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,979
this incredible what I call a gift

112
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,840
that's happening

113
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:36,960
which is amazing that beverage is doing

114
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:39,840
so if you just got on here if you get a

115
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,040
hundred dollars worth of products from

116
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,060

117
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:47,340
and then you can tack on an extra

118
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:49,620
product like it's a lemon balm that's

119
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:53,040
the product right vimorgy.com V is in

122
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:01,320

00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:06,660
on after that hundred dollars

124
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:09,360
a free 30 bottle of lemon balm right

125
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:12,500
there the nervine that's what I call it

126
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,419
the nerve Vine what does that mean

127
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:17,280
nervous system

128
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:19,080
nervous system calming the nervous

129
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,940
system and so many people are so jacked

130
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,620
up right now they're so stressed out

131
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:25,620
they're going through so much they're

132
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:29,479
dealing with so much crap out there and

133
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:31,919
it's critical to have that nerve Vine

134
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:34,620
for those things that people are up

135
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,840
against so many things that people are

136
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,460
up against so I wanted everybody's under

137
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,479
stress right now hardships losses

138
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:44,699
emotional hurt they are dealing with it

139
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:46,860
life's BS that they're handed all these

140
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:50,220
different things so it's important to

141
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:52,560
have that nerve-ind calm things down

142
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,580
and that's a big deal right there so I

143
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,860
just want to tell you about the lemon

144
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:58,320
balm the deal of imagery.com about that

145
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:00,539
like that blows my mind it just blows my

146
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:03,360
mind okay letting you know

147
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:05,460
and so it's a propolis I don't go

148
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,639
anywhere without these two

149
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:10,620
propolis right there now I can't say it

150
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,300
enough right

151
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:18,479
so the propolis pure contains over

152
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:21,740
consistently contains over well over 50

153
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:25,259
percent of active bioavailable

154
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:26,639
polyphenols like quercetin and there's

155
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:29,819
just one of them and one of the

156
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:32,699
polyphenols right it contains that

157
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:36,259
and that's incredible all on its own so

158
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:40,319
this is one incredible reason but I know

159
00:06:36,259 --> 00:06:42,360
when I tell doctor friends practitioner

160
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,160
friends out there and they're like you

161
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:47,039
know I got patience that have this going

162
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,319
on that going on and and I'm like well

163
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,819
are you doing the propolis have you told

164
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:52,380
your patients about the propolis and

165
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:54,180
then they get the patients on the

166
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:57,479
propolis and then

167
00:06:54,180 --> 00:07:00,539
just crazy stuff happens where things

168
00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:03,780
are being reversed and that is critical

169
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:06,780
so immune system is I don't even call a

170
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:09,060
propolis I call it immune system uh do

171
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:10,380
you have my bottle of immune system do I

172
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,000
have my bottle of immune system over

173
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,919
there where is it where's my immune

174
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,580
system that's what I actually call

175
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,840
propolis pure because literally it's

176
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,220
that powerful thank you for the light

177
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,960
blasting I think you're welcome can't

178
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:25,800
wait to do another one soon

179
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:28,800
so I don't go anywhere without these two

180
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:31,259
lemon balm and the propolis right there

181
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,960
and the quality of this propolis so

182
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:36,599
let's hit that for a little bit

183
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:40,039
okay

184
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:40,039
there's no alcohol in here

185
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:46,139
but not just no alcohol

186
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,520
there's no alcohol now there's a reason

187
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:49,620
why I'm saying that just think about

188
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,060
that for a second he said no alcohol he

189
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:52,020
said no alcohol why is he saying it

190
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,699
twice

191
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,319
why is he doing that is he repeating

192
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:57,240
himself no

193
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:59,819
there's not just no alcohol in this

194
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:02,039
propolis there's no alcohol what does

195
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:03,599
that mean is it a trick question it

196
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:05,039
means there's propolises out there that

197
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,259
say non-alcohol

198
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,660
that have alcohol

199
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:11,280
because of the extraction process the

200
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:15,000
extraction process

201
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:17,099
propolis pure does not have alcohol but

202
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,759
for real

203
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:23,639
does not have alcohol in there

204
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:25,860
critical to know oh yeah no I found a

205
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:28,139
propolis out there they do have you it's

206
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,819
got no alcohol in it uh

207
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:33,539
sure

208
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:36,120
sure it doesn't have no alcohol in it

209
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:38,339
sure I believe that I don't believe that

210
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,539
that's the whole point that's the

211
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:41,940
difference

212
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:43,320
and that guarantee for me knowing

213
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,459
there's no alcohol in the process

214
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:49,440
there's no alcohol in this bottle

215
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:51,839
critical because there's alcohol in

216
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,200
propolises even when they say no alcohol

217
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:57,000
or no alcohol added or no alcohol

218
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,140
there's alcohol in there I could say it

219
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,320
a thousand times I'll tell you why

220
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:04,800
because it's a big deal huge huge deal

221
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:07,019
because we need a propolis without that

222
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,779
it makes a big difference because

223
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:12,180
without it your propolis is really

224
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:13,320
stronger that's just one aspect all in

225
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:15,240
its own and then you talk about

226
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,760
beverages propolis like

227
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:20,100
that's another level of quality all on

228
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,019
its own when you taste this it's unlike

229
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,240
any propolis out there I actually dare

230
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:25,800
you to get propolises but I don't want

231
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,680
to want you to waste money

232
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:31,380
but dare you to get propolises and then

233
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:33,300
do do the taste test you take this one

234
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,620
right here the propolis pure and you do

235
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:37,019
that and then you do the others and

236
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:38,339
you'll just be like what the heck is

237
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:40,200
going on

238
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:42,000
and this is my favorite supplement of

239
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,279
all time people ask me what is your

240
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,500
favorite supplement aw I get asked that

241
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:47,820
so many times just like what's your

242
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,680
favorite this what's your favorite that

243
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:53,040
right what's your favorite my favorite

244
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:55,920
supplement of all time hands down is

245
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:58,740
this propolis pure right here to know

246
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,839
that there's one made us in a specific

247
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:02,700
way it's a precious and complex

248
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:05,399
substance from nature

249
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:07,740
that offers many benefits for health

250
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:10,920
right including the immune system which

251
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:12,360
is one of the big reasons all on its own

252
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,640
and oral health I mean you know people

253
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,440
with oral health issues

254
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,600
so many people walk around with oral

255
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:21,959
health problems

256
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:24,060
yeah propolis is critical especially

257
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:25,440
with oral health stuff very important

258
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:28,560
all on its own

259
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:31,019
so what happens with vimergy's propolis

260
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,120
it's sourced from a limited number of

261
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:35,519
carefully screened beekeeping operations

262
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,080
that's the big difference I'm I'm just

263
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,800
excited today because when I found out

264
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:42,839
about the Free bottle of lemon balm with

265
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,940
an order of a hundred dollars and then

266
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:47,220
you tack on your lemon balm for free

267
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:48,839
when I found that out I'm like I'm gonna

268
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,459
talk about I can't help it that's

269
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:53,700
amazing I'm going to talk about my

270
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:56,399
favorite supplement of all time

271
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:58,800
which is the propolis

272
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,720
so it's from a limited number of

273
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,640
carefully screened beekeeping operations

274
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,740
and that right there changes the game

275
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,140
all on its own

276
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:09,600
and in and the other thing it involves a

277
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:12,480
unique purification process

278
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,399
that results in containing well over 50

279
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,800
percent of its polyphenols you gotta

280
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,240
understand what that is like what that

281
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,339
means if you're somebody that's

282
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:24,000
interested in just knowledge about

283
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:27,060
supplementation knowledge about it

284
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,579
this is an incredible situation right

285
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:31,620
here with the Vemma G propolis pure

286
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:33,600
if you're somebody that see you're a

287
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,800
knowledge Seeker like I'm seeking

288
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,440
knowledge

289
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,820
I'm telling you some really unbelievable

290
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,040
things right here

291
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:43,220
Source from a limited number of

292
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:47,820
carefully screened beekeeping operations

293
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:49,920
that means it's not just a [ __ ]

294
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:52,140
situation

295
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,540
that's out there when people slap stuff

296
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:57,720
together and stick it in bottles

297
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:59,040
that means it's far from that

298
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,779
and that's really important to

299
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:04,019
understand and then their purification

300
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:06,000
process allows doesn't kill the stuff

301
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:07,680
and that's another thing too propolis is

302
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,140
out there when they do the purification

303
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:14,640
process they kill the active ingredients

304
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:16,680
think about that right now just you guys

305
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:19,079
I'm excited because basically remember

306
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:22,079
she's giving a gift out

307
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:26,160
they're giving a thirty dollar bottle a

308
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:27,899
four ounce bottle of lemon balm for free

309
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,660
with a hundred dollar order at

310
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:31,980
vimorgy.com but it's fmergy.com not on

311
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:34,320
Amazon

312
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:37,500
so I want to talk about this the process

313
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:40,019
of propolis

314
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:42,660
when you when you process propolis you

315
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:44,940
kill you kill all its active ingredients

316
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:46,680
that's what happens out there

317
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:48,839
but they have a unique purification

318
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:51,600
process that results in keeping the

319
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:54,240
bioactive ingredients polyphenols well

320
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,700
over 50 percent strong and bioactive

321
00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:01,220
critical right there stay calm says

322
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:01,220
propolis has helped my gum pain a lot

323
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:07,200
anybody with oral issues whatsoever this

324
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,639
is what I point to

325
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,399
people are worried about oral health

326
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,839
this is what I point to right here

327
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:15,120
this is it

328
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:17,160
Health with Haley says should you swish

329
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,920
the propolis in your mouth to help with

330
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:21,899
oral care or just swallow what I do is I

331
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,760
put it straight in my mouth and I just

332
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:26,399
let it sit there I let it move around

333
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,380
and sit in my mouth

334
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,480
a lot of people are like a lot of people

335
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:32,880
talk about things they do orally like I

336
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,079
do oil pulling or I do this well let me

337
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,720
tell you

338
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,680
this is a lot more beneficial than any

339
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,660
of that

340
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,740
you put propolis in your mouth before

341
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,660
bed

342
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:44,880
because that's what I do I put propolis

343
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:48,060
in my mouth before bed

344
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,920
just so you know I'm an older guy I got

345
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:53,040
all my teeth

346
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:55,500
I don't have implants in my mouth there

347
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,420
are no implants in my mouth

348
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,820
and you know I have the purple shock

349
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:01,019
therapy in the brain saver book just

350
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:03,540
letting you know the propolis shock

351
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:06,540
therapy instructions on putting it on

352
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:07,980
canker sores mouth sores this is a big

353
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,720
deal

354
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:11,579
and some people

355
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:14,040
you know they might have good oral

356
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:16,019
health going on where you want to keep

357
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:19,139
good oral health too

358
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:22,200
and that's a whole other level

359
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:24,180
so I'm not 20 years old I'm not 30 years

360
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:26,700
old

361
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:30,000
you know even though even though the

362
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:33,240
internet says I'm what 29 now

363
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,279
so Ali stare says I thought we could

364
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:37,860
just heal with food

365
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:41,220
so the question is I thought we can just

366
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:43,260
heal with food right what people are up

367
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:45,360
against and everybody's situation is

368
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:46,980
different I've seen a person just heal

369
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,040
with celery juice

370
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:53,399
I'm sorry but I have I have seen that

371
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:55,440
just acid reflux gone that's it I've

372
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:57,240
seen that somebody's blood pressure down

373
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,920
boom gone their blood pressure's down

374
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,380
high blood pressure's down because

375
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:03,000
celery juice right and they just did

376
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,560
celery juice I've seen that over and

377
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,480
over again out there there's a lot of

378
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,399
people with chronic sickness So when you

379
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,100
say I thought we can just heal with just

380
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:13,199
food

381
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:15,500
that is not encompassing everybody

382
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:18,300
everybody's different

383
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:20,699
everybody is different

384
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:22,860
there are people out there with a lot of

385
00:15:20,699 --> 00:15:25,920
viral inflammation a lot of pathogenic

386
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:27,720
problems a lot of toxic stuff inside of

387
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,000
them a lot of toxic junk inside of them

388
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,260
a lot of different contaminations and

389
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,380
exposures

390
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:36,660
and a lot of different support system

391
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:39,060
issues they're struggling they don't

392
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:41,579
have a great great resources they don't

393
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:45,060
have a great support system and so when

394
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:46,620
you say I thought we only need food for

395
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:48,420
healing well who are we talking about

396
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:50,459
talking about somebody with less stress

397
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:53,639
somebody with less contamination of

398
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:56,459
toxins and exposure somebody with less

399
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:59,040
less pathogenic contamination because if

400
00:15:56,459 --> 00:16:00,959
we're talking about that then maybe yeah

401
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,399
you can totally heal things up with just

402
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,720
food but then you get a whole bunch of

403
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,699
people they've been sick for 10 years

404
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,380
they've been sick for five years they're

405
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:09,360
struggling they got a lot of issues

406
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:11,220
going on they got a lot of exposure they

407
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,680
got a lot of situations a lot of stress

408
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:15,540
their adrenals are totally beaten down

409
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,880
and maxed out and they need

410
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:20,639
supplementation

411
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:23,300
you get somebody with with a real

412
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:26,100
challenging condition they need

413
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:28,380
supplementation so that's important to

414
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:30,540
know and then supplementation is a

415
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:31,920
blanket big one term what's

416
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:34,019
supplementation what are you even

417
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,639
talking about because there's a lot of

418
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:38,759
crap out there if you're talking about

419
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:41,220
liver you know packed in some kind of

420
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:43,019
chewable or you're talking about some

421
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:45,540
gummy are you talking you're talking

422
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:48,060
about some you know you know ABC Gummy

423
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:51,420
or whatever it is ACV gummy whatever it

424
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:55,320
is that's doesn't mean that's going to

425
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:59,060
help it's specific supplementation for

426
00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:02,699
specific reasons and specific quality

427
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:04,740
all that matters it's somebody's healing

428
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:06,600
could be make or break

429
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:08,160
make or break with just a few different

430
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,299
things because it's Death By A Thousand

431
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,040
Cuts

432
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:12,540
and notice I put that term out there

433
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,040
Death By A Thousand Cuts when it comes

434
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:16,020
down to health issues and what happens

435
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,579
when we're struggling with health issues

436
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:19,199
and it's Death By A Thousand Cuts and

437
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:20,939
now I see influencers out there saying

438
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,919
Death By A Thousand Cuts

439
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:24,360
Death By A Thousand Cuts no mention of

440
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:26,040
medical medium death by a thousand

441
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,660
because of course I got to throw that in

442
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,860
I can't help it

443
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,900
but

444
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:32,880
propolis is key for the immune system

445
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:35,039
strengths if you're somebody and you're

446
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,320
relying on just food

447
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:40,440
well your immune system might need a lot

448
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:42,120
more than that for whatever's going on

449
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,799
critical to know somebody's dealing with

450
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,900
mouth ulcers and all kinds of issues and

451
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:47,460
Immunity problems immune system issues

452
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,860
that's

453
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:51,600
a whole nother thing so that's why it's

454
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:54,600
critical to know

455
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,520
there are tools out there so two two of

456
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,980
my favorite supplements I don't budge I

457
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:01,440
don't go anywhere without two of them

458
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:02,580
right here the propolis and the lemon

459
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,980
balm

460
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:07,020
why should I take lemon balm because I'm

461
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:08,640
under enormous stress all the time I

462
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,600
mean I don't know if you guys know but I

463
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,640
am right

464
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,860
people are up against hardships they're

465
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,240
up against stress adrenaline lowers

466
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,860
their immune system because they're

467
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,179
always getting jacked up with adrenaline

468
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:21,059
from stress

469
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:24,600
and they need immune system support and

470
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:26,700
antioxidants the polyphenols very

471
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,559
important all on its own

472
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:31,500
I know that there are people out there

473
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:33,600
and Chip propolis is critical critical

474
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:36,000
for the immune system and then you throw

475
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,820
in toxic chemicals metals that people

476
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,980
have bugs and flu bugs and pathogens

477
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:42,419
that are going on more things that break

478
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,620
down their immune system and breaks down

479
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:45,780
their immune system and breaks down

480
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:47,220
their immune system more of that and

481
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:49,080
then we're in a whole nother game

482
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:50,100
something very important to know and I

483
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,799
do know

484
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:55,559
but there is um there are some people

485
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:58,440
that are total you know they the total

486
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:59,760
downers about supplementation

487
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,380
because they don't know the difference

488
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:05,160
they don't know the difference from

489
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:08,640
garbage junk supplementation like whey

490
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:11,400
protein powder and garbage like that and

491
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,380
all kinds of big tablets with you know

492
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,240
all kinds of junk in it with a hundred

493
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:18,660
products in it they don't know the

494
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:20,580
difference from the gelatin tablets all

495
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:22,260
the junk all the whey protein powder all

496
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:24,539
the natural flavors and everything they

497
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:27,299
don't know that difference

498
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:28,919
from there to something this pure and

499
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:30,600
this unbelievable for the immune system

500
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:32,880
so what they do is because they're

501
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:35,220
ignorant of that understanding out there

502
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,960
not the person who has the question that

503
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:38,400
said doesn't can't we just do it with

504
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,360
food no not you I'm talking about the

505
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,940
people out there there's some

506
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,520
influencers out there that will say you

507
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:47,520
know you don't need supplements ever you

508
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:49,140
don't need any of that right it's sad

509
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,760
when they say that because what are they

510
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:52,620
talking about if somebody would have

511
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:55,080
busted up immune system someone who's

512
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:57,240
struggling and suffering somebody who

513
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,620
has a lot of challenges with their

514
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,539
immune cells

515
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,799
and you're like and they hear that and

516
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:03,360
they're just confused and they're like

517
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:05,940
oh okay

518
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,140
and then they're also not being told the

519
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:10,080
difference they're not being told the

520
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:12,419
difference from just gelatin based

521
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:15,059
garbage filled with all kinds of crap

522
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:17,220
and whey protein powder and then trendy

523
00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:20,280
stuff that isn't good like charcoal

524
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:23,460
which is terrible for the for the the

525
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:25,200
intestinal tract terrible for their body

526
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:27,720
and they don't know the difference of

527
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,000
all the bad stuff out there the Clays

528
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:32,220
the bentonite clay the charcoal the

529
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,919
Pearl powder all the junk and garbage

530
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:36,960
and the trend stuff they don't know that

531
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:39,299
difference right there compared to

532
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:43,260
something that has over 50 percent of

533
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:46,500
its polyphenols bioactive quercetin

534
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:48,600
that's not dead it's alive in the

535
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,160
propolis pure and what that means I'm

536
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:53,100
talking about this

537
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:56,280
because these things need to be talked

538
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:57,660
about once in a while they just do they

539
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:00,299
need to be talked about once in a while

540
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:01,919
what comes down to moving the needle you

541
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:03,780
want something that helps to move the

542
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:07,140
needle you don't want to be dogging it

543
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:10,919
you don't want your health dogging it

544
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:15,120
and a lot of people they can't stay on a

545
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:17,280
good path they get thrown off all the

546
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:21,120
time thrown off the wagon all the time

547
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:23,100
by being influenced by so much crap out

548
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,500
there that they're being pushed off the

549
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:27,120
wagon and they don't know which way the

550
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:29,100
wind blows with their health they have

551
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,559
no idea what they should do they're

552
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:33,659
eating all kinds of crazy stuff they're

553
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:35,039
doing their cheat days and if that's the

554
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:37,380

immune system strong if you don't know

556
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,860
what is going on with your health if you

558
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:45,059
critical to have your immune system

day

00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:34,140
or if you're nervous it's a great calmer

604
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:35,880
to do the lemon balm so I wanted to talk

605
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:39,140
about that too because it's that nerve

606
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,140
Vine that's really powerful

607
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:45,720
so you guys there's so much to talk

608
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:47,580
about all right so Lev Lev says on IG I

609
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:50,280
got off my medical medium supplements

610
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:52,200
and the effects were catastrophic

611
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:54,360
such a lie that people don't need

612
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,100
supplements it makes or breaks for me

613
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,020
there's it's make or break I've talked

614
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,980
you know what's sad can I just say

615
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,720
something

616
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:02,580
if you guys are okay with this do you

617
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,679
guys have a second you know what's

618
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:07,380
freaking sad

619
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:09,900
is I've been talking about make or break

620
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:12,620
for years and years

621
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:15,299
from the very first book and way before

622
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:18,299
I've been talking about it's critical

623
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:20,520
that the chronically ill they don't get

624
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:23,280
swayed off their game

625
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:25,860
because it's make or break crap that

626
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:27,960
happens but it's easy to get lost

627
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:30,659
because you get okay first of all let's

628
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:32,940
go into this if there's it's no

629
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:34,500
Secret

630
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:36,240
that there's people that don't like me

631
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,980
out there in health the health World

632
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,900
they don't think I should have a space

633
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:41,400
in the health world even though they're

634
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:45,419
they're ripping off the medical medium

635
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:47,340
information daily and not citing it back

636
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:49,260
there's people out there health

637
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:51,780
influencers and so forth that don't

638
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:55,440
believe I deserve a space in the health

639
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:57,240
realm even though nobody even had an

640
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,059
inkling to what was wrong with anybody

641
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:02,159
just eight nine years ago when the first

642
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:05,039
book came out

643
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:07,020
even though I have 35 plus years of

644
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,520
experience of bringing people's lives

645
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:11,640
back and so there's people out there

646
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:13,740
that don't think I deserve any space at

647
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:16,320
all in the health scene

648
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:18,059
right they just don't like me so what

649
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,320
they do is they conjure up things to

650
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:22,679
break down the medical medium Community

651
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:24,900
they conjure up stuff they throw stuff

652
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:26,700
at the mm Community all the time you

653
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:28,200
don't need a supplement

654
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:30,299
you don't need to take any meanwhile

655
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,320
they take it behind the scenes meanwhile

656
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:32,700
the ones that are saying it the

657
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:35,220
influencers that are saying it to people

658
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:36,720
you don't need to take your your memory

659
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:38,820
you don't need to take your supplements

660
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:42,539
meanwhile they're they're taking

661
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:44,940
the Bemidji supplements behind the scene

662
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:48,000
because the intentions there are because

663
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:50,880
it's towards me right it's towards the

664
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,620
medical medium so you try to break down

665
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,419
the community this happens all the time

666
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:57,900
I see it all the time

667
00:25:54,419 --> 00:26:01,260
Steph Ever After says Bemidji sups have

668
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:03,900
given me my life back B12 lemon balm

669
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:05,760
ashwagandha zinc micro C

670
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:07,200
if you get a hundred dollar order at

671
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:10,380
vimergy.com

672
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:14,100
you go to venergy.com 100 order

673
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:16,380
you get a free four ounce bottle almost

674
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:19,080
four ounce bottle of the lemon balm

675
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:21,600
right here you just have to go to

676
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:24,600
vimergy.com

677
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:27,480
get your do your 100 order or more and

678
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:29,039
then tack on an additional lemon bomb

679
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,919
and then hit the code that they have

680
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:33,779
there I think it's like

681
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:36,260
f-r-e-e-l-e-m I mean that you'll see the

682
00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:36,260
code there

683
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:39,779
so

684
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:41,520
I want to go back to make or break I've

685
00:26:39,779 --> 00:26:43,559
been talking about that for years I

686
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,900
remember doing a lecture

687
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:47,760
like seven eight years ago

688
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,620
one of my lectures I was doing is a

689
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:52,080
crowd of people and I was talking about

690
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:54,120
make or break on how every little thing

691
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:56,880
matters because it's Death By A Thousand

692
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:59,640
Cuts and every little thing matters with

693
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,620
your healing process this is critical I

694
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:04,860
noticed if I don't talk about this for a

695
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:07,440
while the snakes come in

696
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:10,740
and the Sharks come in

697
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,059
and the opportunists come in and they

698
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:14,159
come into the medical medium community

699
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:16,980
and they advertise to the medical medium

700
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:19,919
Community to death or they sit there and

701
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:22,740
they just literally talk down medical

702
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:26,100
medium and try to get them parading on

703
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:28,440
their side like come do my programs you

704
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:29,880
don't have to do that and you don't you

705
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,860
could eat anything you want you could

706
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:34,320
eat all the pizzas you want you can eat

707
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:38,580
all the vegan pizzas you want it doesn't

708
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:41,279
matter too restrictive you know medical

709
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:43,860
medium doesn't want you on gluten or

710
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:45,360
dairy products he's too restrictive he

711
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:47,159
doesn't want you on eggs he's too

712
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,380
restrictive he doesn't want you on pork

713
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:51,900
fat medical medium doesn't want you on

714
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:53,520
pork fat he's so restrictive he doesn't

715
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:55,080
want you on a stick of butter every day

716
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:58,860
so you get a heart attack he's so

717
00:27:55,080 --> 00:28:01,460
restrictive anyway the point is

718
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:03,840
is that the Sharks and the stakes

719
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:05,880
Slytherin and swim into the medical mean

720
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:09,240
community and they'll say you don't need

721
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:10,620
a supplement but hey do my program and

722
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,659
I'm going to take my supplements

723
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:14,299
privately when nobody knows in my

724
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:16,919
kitchen at night

725
00:28:14,299 --> 00:28:18,779
that's what they do the supplements that

726
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:21,240
got them better and here's another thing

727
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:23,580
a lot of people got better

728
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:25,919
a lot of people that rip try to rip

729
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:27,659
medical medium down and shade throw

730
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:30,240
shade on the medical medium in the

731
00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:31,700
community they got better through the

732
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:35,039
medical medium

733
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:37,980
protocols with supplements then then

734
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:39,779
they stop citing medical medium and said

735
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:41,940
hey come over here you don't have to do

736
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:44,520

737
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:46,440
restrictive oh yeah you'll hear that

738
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:48,600
stuff all the time the wild blueberry

739
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:50,700
babe says I needed supplementation

740
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:53,520
because of the number of pathogens

741
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:56,760
toxins and poisons I've been exposed to

742
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:59,100
as well as traumas needed all the help I

743
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:01,799
can get grateful for femergy

744
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:03,179
and that takes me to another thing

745
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:06,000
yeah

746
00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:07,860
that is so incredible by the way where

747
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,659
do I get it fearing woman says Where do

748
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:12,720
I get it the lemon balm in the other go

749
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:16,200
to vimergy.com via's in Victor I am as

750
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,700
in Mary e r g y.com

751
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,620
go there you have to order a hundred

752
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:21,960
dollars worth of stuff of supplements

753
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:23,580
that you need and then you tack on the

754
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,919
30 dollar

755
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:30,080
free lemon balm

756
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:30,080
it's incredible it really is

757
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:37,740
cool I love Emoji they are really Game

758
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:40,380
Changer even if you can afford just one

759
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:43,020
is great you will have healing

760
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:46,200
and that's what I mean it's

761
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:47,460
it like the propolis is critical it's

762
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:52,620
critical for me

763
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:55,980
because I put my physical body

764
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:56,940
through the mill I run it through the

765
00:29:55,980 --> 00:30:00,000
mill

766
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:01,980
like seriously that's what I do okay

767
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,320
it's not smart

768
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:05,820
I'm not saying that it's a good idea to

769
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,700
do that it's not

770
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:11,640
but that's what I do to keep up with all

771
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:12,799
that I got to do I run my I burn myself

772
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:16,980
to the ground

773
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:18,320
like burn it to the ground and then

774
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:23,580
okay

775
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:24,600
I use the Vim to restore and build me

776
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:27,840
back up

777
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:30,600
so I can't hang in there for when I'm up

778
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:34,620
against massive stress writing the books

779
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:37,559
working hard doing no sleep 20 hour days

780
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:40,260
22 hour days

781
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:43,740
and that I want to keep myself strong

782
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:45,419
for I do I want to keep myself strong

783
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:46,980
so I just want to say like I said

784
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:49,980
there's a tremendous amount of fork

785
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:52,559
tongue snakes and lizards even though

786
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:55,200
you know whatever lizards are probably

787
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:57,960
friendly to a point and there's probably

788
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,820
some friendly snakes out there okay but

789
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,740
there's some snakes and lizards that

790
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:05,159
slide in

791
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:06,600
they do and they come on into the

792
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:08,100
medical medium Community because you

793
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,299
know what though it is too that where

794
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:11,279
they've made a name for themselves

795
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:13,200
through the medical meme community

796
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:14,820
by healing themselves with medical meme

797
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,279
information the books and the protocols

798
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:18,899
and then they tell everybody oh don't do

799
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:21,659
a supplement don't do this he's

800
00:31:18,899 --> 00:31:24,000
restrictive oh it's a cult it's a cult

801
00:31:21,659 --> 00:31:26,399
that's what it is uh really

802
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,799
okay you know and they'll say whatever

803
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:31,260
they're gonna say because they just want

804
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:33,000
to shade on everybody but then it chips

805
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:34,559
away at everybody and it's Death By A

806
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,059
Thousand Cuts because it's make or break

807
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:38,100
and as somebody just said originally

808
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:40,260
earlier they were saying

809
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:42,840
that someone persuaded them to stop

810
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:45,419
their energy supplements and then their

811
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:47,580
health went catastrophic and then they

812
00:31:45,419 --> 00:31:49,200
had to go back up it's it's it's like

813
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:52,260
that out there I've seen this over and

814
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,880
over again meanwhile which is really

815
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:56,640
interesting there's some other

816
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:59,460
supplement companies out there that are

817
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:02,580
kind of bonding with some of the Sharks

818
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:04,980
and some of the snakes yeah because it's

819
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:08,760
a compa frequentition

820
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:12,059
it's competitive crap out there it's all

821
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:13,620
about the medical meme Community how how

822
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:17,360
to break into the medical medium

823
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:20,700
Community to sell their garbage and crap

824
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:22,440
that has a percentage of unjust of

825
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:24,360
undisclosed ingredients in it that

826
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,799
aren't good that has alcohol and citric

827
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:27,840
acid and all this garbage in it and

828
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:30,240
everything else it has all that stuff

829
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:32,460
and doesn't have the quality and that's

830
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,899
the sad part all on its own anyway I

831
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:35,760
want to read about the quickening but I

832
00:32:33,899 --> 00:32:37,440
just wanted to talk about all this

833
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,240
I just don't want this company to

834
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,340
disappear someday

835
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:44,940
so I fully endorse them because this

836
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:48,120
stuff is that amazing you cannot mess

837
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:49,679
with this type of product here it

838
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:51,840
doesn't exist anywhere it will never

839
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:54,240
exist anywhere else I can honestly tell

840
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,620
you there's no way in hell ever there's

841
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:59,399
going to be a supplement company that's

842
00:32:55,620 --> 00:33:00,840
going to duplicate this or even try the

843
00:32:59,399 --> 00:33:01,919
price Point's not going to be there and

844
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:04,260
they're not going to be able to do it

845
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:06,179
I'm going to tell you right now

846
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:09,419
there's not going to be a company in the

847
00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:11,760
world to actually duplicate that

848
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:13,740
propolis pure they'll never go for the

849
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,179
price point they'll never go for the

850
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:16,919
quality they'll never go for the

851
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:19,140
carefully screened you know screened

852
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:21,659
beekeeper operations they'll never go

853
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:23,640
for any of that they won't hands down

854
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:25,140
this is the best stuff out there lupus

855
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,940
free with celery three through three I

856
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:29,880
healed my frozen shoulder Frozen

857
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:31,860
shoulders awful that's awful so many

858
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:33,480
people have suffered from that I healed

859
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:36,120
my frozen shoulder with celery juice

860
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:38,880
alone but I needed vermergy for so many

861
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:40,620
other symptoms and the shock therapy

862
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,440
which is amazing

863
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:45,539
the shock therapies from SOC are

864
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:48,600
probably one of my favorite things

865
00:33:45,539 --> 00:33:50,039
all around are the shock therapies from

866
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:52,380
SOC

867
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:54,779
I mean nobody in the health realm even

868
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:57,120
thought of anything like that no one in

869
00:33:54,779 --> 00:33:59,700
the health realm anywhere

870
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:02,820
knew to do the shock Therapies

871
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:05,940
that's Testament alone

872
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:08,240
to what's so incredible about SOC and

873
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:08,240
the information

874
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:16,200

875
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:19,679

876
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:21,060
the individual to heal so you feel you

877
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:24,659

878
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:27,359
cult like thing yep it empowers the

879
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:30,839
individual

880
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:32,580
to bring and heal themselves based on

881
00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:36,000
educating customizing their own

882
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:37,619

00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:15,380
there's the golden goodness going in

922
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,380
there

923
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:21,780
yeah

924
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,859
so I know we're hitting a lot of

925
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,359
different topics right here we're

926
00:36:22,859 --> 00:36:25,740
talking about death by a Thousand Cuts

927
00:36:24,359 --> 00:36:27,780
we're talking about make or break the

928
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:28,920
healing process talk about the Sharks

929
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:30,119
and the snakes and the lizards to

930
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:32,220
Slither into the medical meme Community

931
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:33,599
or already started there they started

932
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:35,820
out in the medical meeting Community

933
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:37,800
they got known in the medical medium

934
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:39,720
community

935
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,220
and then they just wanted to sell their

936
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:43,200
own stuff

937
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:45,420
right the programs or whatever it is

938
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,520
sell their own courses their own classes

939
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:49,920
and then they they go with that

940
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:52,800
marketing strategy which is don't ever

941
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,240
ever cite the medical medium be your own

942
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,060
thing and then they come out and they're

943
00:36:54,240 --> 00:37:00,359
like don't do this don't do that he's

944
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:02,040
he's too restrictive on his Foods

945
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:03,359
yeah because I don't want people eating

946
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:06,060
pork fat

947
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:08,400
so they don't get a heart attack

948
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:10,320
all right

949
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,940

951
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:16,980

there and there's supplement companies

974
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:06,540
out there that are trying to model after

975
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:08,280
vimergy right now and they used to have

976
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:10,320
natural flavors in their supplements

977
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:12,359
just so you know they used to have it in

978
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,880
there but no one knows about what they

979
00:38:12,359 --> 00:38:17,339
used to have and then they take it out

980
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,140
because they're like whoa yeah we better

981
00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:22,560

982
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:24,060

Janessa says propolis pure from vimergy

985
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:31,740
made my canker sores disappear in less

986
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:34,260
than 24 hours amazing when applied

987
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:38,760

00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:42,720
can I read that over and over again

989
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:44,760
because seriously Genesis probe was pure

990
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:47,880
from Bemidji that's the problem of

991
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:50,099
Bemidji made my canker sore and canker

992
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:53,180
sores I've seen be debilitating for

993
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:57,500
people disappear in less than 24 hours

994
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:57,500
amazing when applied directly

995
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:05,099

996
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:07,380
because it's miraculous and incredible

997
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:11,339
and that's in medical medium tool and

998
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:12,359
technique and it it's working and works

999
00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:14,220

1000
00:39:12,359 --> 00:39:17,040
that matters

1001
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:19,020
all of it does so I wanted everybody to

1002
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:22,520
kind of know what's going on

1003
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:22,520

1004
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:29,940
critical tools are imperative for people

1005
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:31,440
with he with problems

1006
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:32,820
problems with their healing process

1007
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:36,240
problems with what they're going through

1008
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:37,740
their bodies emotionally mentally all of

1009
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,960
it

1010
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:44,339
crispy perspective says it made mine

1011
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:47,220

1012
00:39:44,339 --> 00:39:51,119

1014
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:57,540

1015
00:39:55,560 --> 00:40:00,660
it doing for the immune system

1016
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:02,880
that people don't see is happening

1017
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:06,119
inside their body and you guys know I

go as far as they need to heal they need

1131
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:38,220
the opportunity to take as many

you can be doing your own supplement

1149
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:13,980
protocol that you customize from the

1150
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,300
medical medium books and information you

1151
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:17,220

for this

1155
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:25,500
medical medium information and medical

1156
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:26,700
medium in general talks about the food

1157
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:29,160
Wars

1158
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:31,800
and talks about how it's not about

1159
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:33,780
animal protein or plant-based if you

1160
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:35,760
want to be plant-based be plant-based if

1161
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:37,380
you want to be vegan be vegan if you

1162
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:40,020
want to be animal protein be animal

1163
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:42,839
protein but you still have to learn why

1164
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:45,480
you're sick and what to do to heal you

1165
00:45:42,839 --> 00:45:47,400
have to learn why you got sick and what

1166
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:49,500
it takes what you need to do to heal

1167
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:52,500
whether you eat animal protein whether

1168
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:54,540
you're vegan or plant-based

1169
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:56,940
right now some of the vegan communities

1170
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:59,819
I'm not saying all of them at all

1171
00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:02,520
some of the vegan communities are really

1172
00:45:59,819 --> 00:46:03,960
really coldish some of them not all of

1173
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:05,280
them there there's a couple out there

1174
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:08,220
and they're like oh we hate medical

1175
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:10,140
medium because he talks about you can

1176
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:11,640
you can do his stuff eating an animal

1177
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:14,040
protein

1178
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:16,560
and they get so angry

1179
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:18,960
they're angry because I'm not against

1180
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:21,240
somebody eating animal protein why am I

1181
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:23,339
going to be judging somebody why should

1182
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:25,319
I ever judge somebody for eating animal

1183
00:46:23,339 --> 00:46:27,480
protein and why should I judge them for

1184
00:46:25,319 --> 00:46:30,000
being a vegetarian or a vegan or a

1185
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:32,579
plant-based person who am I and what

1186
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:35,040
right do I have to judge anybody

1187
00:46:32,579 --> 00:46:37,500
for what they put in their mouth life is

1188
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:38,940
hard and some people say animal protein

1189
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:41,099
works for them you think I have the

1190
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:43,680
right to judge them and that's the whole

1191
00:46:41,099 --> 00:46:45,960
thing it's it's important to know like

1192
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:49,140
with the mm information

1193
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:51,119

00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:53,880
to heal bring in the things you need

1195
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:55,079
customize your protocol the way you want

1196
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,880
to

1197
00:46:55,079 --> 00:47:00,060
and move forward

1198
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:01,680
with your life and not be judged you

1199
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:04,260
could be a plant-based person here you

1200
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:06,060
could be an animal protein person here

1201
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:07,740
you can come straight out of keto animal

1202
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:09,359
protein and come here straight out of

1203
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:11,700
paleo animal protein and come to Medical

1204
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:13,740
medium induce medical medium tools you

1205
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:15,920
can incorporate medical meme tools into

1206
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:19,859
whatever it is you're doing it's called

1207
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:22,380
it isn't one size fits all it's called

1208
00:47:19,859 --> 00:47:25,440
customizing what you need really

1209
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:27,900
important because everybody's different

1210
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:29,880
everybody's different

1211
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:31,680
critical to know

1212
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:34,819
so just talking about some of the things

1213
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,819
that are going on out there too

1214
00:47:34,859 --> 00:47:39,359
Jess says love your books

1215
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:41,819
celery juice has helped me with my

1216
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:43,859
inflammatory pots

1217
00:47:41,819 --> 00:47:45,359
incredible

1218
00:47:43,859 --> 00:47:49,380
it really is

1219
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:52,200
love and healing says on IG mm info is

1220
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:54,599
vast I love that I can stop searching

1221
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:57,540
for answers lots of misinformation out

1222
00:47:54,599 --> 00:47:59,579
there so glad I'm not lost in that world

1223
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:01,380
anymore and I'm so glad you're not lost

1224
00:47:59,579 --> 00:48:05,040
in that world anymore

1225
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:06,780
because that world yes is scary and I've

1226
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:09,359
seen a lot of people lost in it over the

1227
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:12,240
years Lisa I was vegan and eating

1228
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:13,920
healthy and got so sick now I'm vegan

1229
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:15,540
medical medium style and healing and

1230
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,440
that leads me to one other thing right

1231
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:20,040
here

1232
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:22,200
I love when when plant-based

1233
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:24,420
medical medium Anthony William haters

1234
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:26,640
there's some plant-based influencers

1235
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:27,720
that hate medical medium Anthony William

1236
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:30,300
out there

1237
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:32,940
right and but they don't realize

1238
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:34,400
something there are so many plant-based

1239
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:36,960
people here in medical medium community

1240
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:40,079
that were doing plant-based but we're

1241
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:42,060
sick as dogs and they learned that it

1242
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:44,040
took more than just being plant-based it

1243
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:46,260
took being plant-based for them and then

1244
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:47,940
the Learned protocols and shock

1245
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:49,980
Therapies

1246
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:52,859
and all kinds of different things it

1247
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:54,780
took more right and then there's just

1248
00:48:52,859 --> 00:48:56,880
plain old raw vegan movement out there

1249
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:59,280
or plain old you know plant-based raw

1250
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:02,339
vegan influencers out there that that

1251
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:04,560
just crap on MM say it's all like

1252
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:06,900
whatever a joke say he doesn't have any

1253
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:09,960
credentials I don't have any credentials

1254
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:11,520
I'm not a doctor never said I was if I

1255
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:13,319
had credentials I'd be flaunting the

1256
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,819
many everywhere if I had a certificate

1257
00:49:13,319 --> 00:49:16,680
of being a health coach I'd be saying

1258
00:49:14,819 --> 00:49:18,720
yeah I also have a certificate as a

1259
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:21,119
health coach why not it would probably

1260
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:22,619
help me actually but I don't have any

1261
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:24,359
credentials but what happens is with

1262
00:49:22,619 --> 00:49:27,839
there's plant-based influencers out

1263
00:49:24,359 --> 00:49:30,599
there that hate mm so much

1264
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:32,760
because they think well they got it all

1265
00:49:30,599 --> 00:49:33,900
down with their plant-based thing when

1266
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:35,700
they don't realize you can be

1267
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:37,200
plant-based and sick

1268
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:39,240

real sick

1270
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:43,859
so sick and then learn how to heal while

1271
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:46,800
still being plant-based because medical

1272
00:49:43,859 --> 00:49:49,020

1389
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:48,240
by the time we mentally process

00:56:11,579 --> 00:56:16,920
brunt so women kind Bears the Brunt

1426
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:21,540
the quickening

1427
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:24,180
it's women who face the greatest

1428
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:26,940
expectations in our current day

1429
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:28,740
no no

1430
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:31,980
disrespect to men

1431
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:33,180
men also face a lot of crap we know that

1432
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:36,000
right

1433
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:38,400
but no no disrespect just acknowledging

1434
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:41,460
that right now during the quickening

1435
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:43,200
women really are faced with a lot of

1436
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:44,640
different expectations in the current

1437
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:47,099
day

1438
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:48,359
women whose bodies so often get pushed

1439
00:56:47,099 --> 00:56:51,000
to the brink

1440
00:56:48,359 --> 00:56:54,420
and chronic illness has become such a

1441
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:56,040
widespread issue for women for men and

1442
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:58,380
for children

1443
00:56:56,040 --> 00:57:00,780
if we don't interrupt the constant flow

1444
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:03,119
of misinformation

1445
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:07,140
then that's what medical medium

1446
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:10,319
information does it breaks and

1447
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:12,720
interrupts the flow of constant

1448
00:57:10,319 --> 00:57:14,819
misinformation out there if we don't

1449
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:16,800
recognize what our four mothers and

1450
00:57:14,819 --> 00:57:19,680
forefathers have gone through and

1451
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:22,260
redirect our course then the generations

1452
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:24,720
to come will have to endure unnecessary

1453
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:28,859
suffering I'm seeing it now I mean when

1454
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:31,800
I go back 35 years I'm seeing how

1455
00:57:28,859 --> 00:57:36,020
the generations

1456
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:36,020
have to endure like the new generations

1457
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:41,099
suffering to keep up with The Changing

1458
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:44,220
Times to survive we must learn to adapt

1459
00:57:41,099 --> 00:57:46,319
the only way to do that is to protect

1460
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:48,540
our health

1461
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:50,579
and not in just

1462
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:54,359
a ridiculous way

1463
00:57:50,579 --> 00:57:56,940
but in a way that matters and counts

1464
00:57:54,359 --> 00:57:59,339
the popular approach right now in books

1465
00:57:56,940 --> 00:58:01,200
articles and social media and podcasts

1466
00:57:59,339 --> 00:58:04,619
about chronic illness is to advise

1467
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:06,960
people to eliminate what are theorized

1468
00:58:04,619 --> 00:58:08,880
to be inflammatory foods from their

1469
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:11,520
diets while making theoretical

1470
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:13,020
improvements to gut health and that's as

1471
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:14,819
far as it goes

1472
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:17,099
the information out there doesn't

1473
00:58:14,819 --> 00:58:19,319
explain what actually causes autoimmune

1474
00:58:17,099 --> 00:58:21,720
disorders or chronic conditions or how

1475
00:58:19,319 --> 00:58:24,359
to rid yourself of the real root

1476
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:25,980
problems that is why people stay sick I

1477
00:58:24,359 --> 00:58:27,540
don't care how many people have adopted

1478
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:29,280
the whole inflammatory thing out there

1479
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:31,260
and they talk about it on podcasts or

1480
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:35,160
whatever they talk about

1481
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:37,619
they still don't know the root causes

1482
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:39,059
but there are genuine explanations for

1483
00:58:37,619 --> 00:58:40,880
the conditions that leave medical

1484
00:58:39,059 --> 00:58:44,040
communities

1485
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:46,740
in a stagnant place and leave patience

1486
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:48,839
without answers

1487
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:51,059
is there such thing as that patients

1488
00:58:48,839 --> 00:58:52,319
without answers

1489
00:58:51,059 --> 00:58:55,260
yeah

1490
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:59,040
sure is TJ says

1491
00:58:55,260 --> 00:59:02,420
so true aw I'm 59 and scary to see how

1492
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:02,420
much things have changed

1493
00:59:03,299 --> 00:59:08,220
the illusion is that there is a movement

1494
00:59:05,579 --> 00:59:11,099
in the medical communities

1495
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:14,040
sorry the illusion

1496
00:59:11,099 --> 00:59:17,640
this is an important word to just

1497
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:20,099
like digest for a second the illusion

1498
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:22,260
is that there is movement in medical

1499
00:59:20,099 --> 00:59:24,119
communities understanding of chronic

1500
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:26,579
illness

1501
00:59:24,119 --> 00:59:29,579
I see some like seriously some some

1502
00:59:26,579 --> 00:59:33,480
really good doctors out there

1503
00:59:29,579 --> 00:59:35,339
doing a lot of stuff trying really hard

1504
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:36,480
they still don't know why their patients

1505
00:59:35,339 --> 00:59:38,880
are sick

1506
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:41,940
I hear about it all the time the reality

1507
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:43,920
is that appearance of advancement often

1508
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:46,920
comes from false leads and guessing

1509
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:49,440
games so it's like you what happens is

1510
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:51,480
when we seek help we're getting kind of

1511
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:54,500
like

1512
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:57,180
snowed with smoke and mirrors with

1513
00:59:54,500 --> 01:00:00,420
advancements in health

1514
00:59:57,180 --> 01:00:04,819
but really it's a lot of Flash

1515
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:04,819
pomp circumstance bells and whistles

1516
01:00:06,839 --> 01:00:12,980
Jackie B says on YouTube this book has

1517
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:12,980
changed my life

1518
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:17,579
it's got the collecting Stones

1519
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:19,559
meditation journey in here but there's

1520
01:00:17,579 --> 01:00:22,920
going to be a lot more

1521
01:00:19,559 --> 01:00:23,940
of that starting on the 19th you get a

1522
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:26,359
video every day it's going to be

1523
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:26,359
incredible

1524
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:31,319
so this is important information right

1525
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:33,180
now

1526
01:00:31,319 --> 01:00:35,460
the reality is that appearance of

1527
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:37,740
advancement often comes from false leads

1528
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:39,180
and guessing games and people are still

1529
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:41,640
suffering

1530
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:44,220
still suffering that stagnation doesn't

1531
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:46,140
need to hold you back anymore there are

1532
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:50,400
powerful methods to deal with the

1533
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:52,799
challenges we face in this modern era

1534
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:55,380
medical meme information is shaped and

1535
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:57,599
changed Health all on its own just not

1536
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:59,640
only in the last few decades but

1537
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:01,680
specifically and especially in the last

1538
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:03,960
three years last 10 years

1539
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:05,940
this book is the guide to truly freeing

1540
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:08,040
yourself

1541
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:10,799
I've written it so you can truly heal

1542
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:12,780
and keep yourself from getting sucked

1543
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:15,180
into the trends and fads and mistakes

1544
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:17,160
and half truths and errors and

1545
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:18,839
distractions and deceptions about Health

1546
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:20,940
and Wellness

1547
01:01:18,839 --> 01:01:22,559
Spirit of compassion has provided this

1548
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:25,079
information so we can help today's

1549
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:26,819
children grow into healthy adults

1550
01:01:25,079 --> 01:01:28,619
and here's here's what's interesting I'm

1551
01:01:26,819 --> 01:01:30,180
not against science not against science

1552
01:01:28,619 --> 01:01:33,299
and research

1553
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:35,280
I'm in no way anti-science far from it

1554
01:01:33,299 --> 01:01:37,859
actually I don't question that the Earth

1555
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:39,839
is round I hope I don't

1556
01:01:37,859 --> 01:01:41,339
I hope I'm not bothering anybody that

1557
01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:43,440
there's a lot of people that think the

1558
01:01:41,339 --> 01:01:45,859
Earth is flat and I don't judge them on

1559
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:45,859
any level

1560
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:51,000
I don't question that the Earth is round

1561
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:51,960
or that the Earth is billions of years

1562
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:55,680
old

1563
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:57,839
or the value of the scientific method

1564
01:01:55,680 --> 01:02:01,319
What Spirit of compassion reveals in

1565
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:03,359
this book is being read here and as a

1566
01:02:01,319 --> 01:02:04,980
result becoming recognized by the

1567
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:07,740
scientific Community more and more each

1568
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:11,640
day so here's what happens scientific

1569
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:13,920
Community is poaching information that

1570
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:15,780
was only published out of this book

1571
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:18,720
right here and the other medical medium

1572
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:22,079
books but at least science is advancing

1573
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:23,099
because of this right here this book was

1574
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:26,099
published

1575
01:02:23,099 --> 01:02:26,099
2015

1576
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:33,059
but was already written in the process

1577
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:36,059
of getting printed in two thousand and

1578
01:02:33,059 --> 01:02:36,059
13.

1579
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:45,599
if you or a loved one is sick do you

1580
01:02:42,119 --> 01:02:47,460
feel you have 20 or 30 or 50 years to

1581
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:48,960
wait for answers very important right

1582
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:50,700
there so I want to read this little

1583
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:53,460
section

1584
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:56,280
the word Quicken doesn't just mean

1585
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:58,579
become faster

1586
01:02:56,280 --> 01:03:01,559
it also means spring to life

1587
01:02:58,579 --> 01:03:04,260
historically is referred to the first

1588
01:03:01,559 --> 01:03:05,520
signs of movement a fetus showed in the

1589
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:07,440
womb

1590
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:09,240
which is to say this time of the

1591
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:11,819
quickening isn't just about life

1592
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:13,799
speeding up it's also about rebirth

1593
01:03:11,819 --> 01:03:15,599
so even though things are going faster

1594
01:03:13,799 --> 01:03:17,040
than ever before with the quickening

1595
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:18,559
right now and we know that I mean you

1596
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:22,260
guys know just in the last three years

1597
01:03:18,559 --> 01:03:24,359
hasn't things gone a lot faster just in

1598
01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:25,799
the last four years how about the last

1599
01:03:24,359 --> 01:03:28,319
five years

1600
01:03:25,799 --> 01:03:30,660
do you think things were different 10

1601
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:33,119
years ago than what they are now greatly

1602
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:35,099
different in so many ways Health with

1603
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:37,380
Liz good to see you this book is one of

1604
01:03:35,099 --> 01:03:39,480
the most precious to me because of the

1605
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:41,579
Soul healing chapter I'm so grateful for

1606
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:43,079
Spirit of compassion for providing this

1607
01:03:41,579 --> 01:03:46,140
info

1608
01:03:43,079 --> 01:03:49,920
thank you health with Liz

1609
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:51,839
truly I respect your opinion and your

1610
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:54,799
experience

1611
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:54,799
and what you say

1612
01:03:55,920 --> 01:04:01,680
aren't we all looking for truth truth

1613
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:04,380
about our world the universe truth about

1614
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:06,839
ourselves about life about why we are

1615
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:08,940
here about our purpose are we not

1616
01:04:06,839 --> 01:04:11,280
looking for truth about all of that

1617
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:13,559
when we're sick we question ourselves

1618
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:15,000
how many people question themselves when

1619
01:04:13,559 --> 01:04:18,140
they get sick

1620
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,140
so many people do

1621
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:24,540
from what we were put on Earth to do we

1622
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:27,720
doubt basic truths like the body's

1623
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:30,059
ability to heal because we have haven't

1624
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:31,559
yet connected to what's really behind

1625
01:04:30,059 --> 01:04:33,540
our illnesses

1626
01:04:31,559 --> 01:04:36,059
we go from Doctor to doctor medical

1627
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:38,940
community to medical community looking

1628
01:04:36,059 --> 01:04:41,640
for an answer we lose faith in life

1629
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:45,420
itself and I can't stress that point

1630
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:47,880
enough so many people lose faith

1631
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:49,680
when they get sick

1632
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:53,099
they lose faith

1633
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:56,280
when we become well doubt melts away we

1634
01:04:53,099 --> 01:04:59,700
have energy to to to devote to our true

1635
01:04:56,280 --> 01:05:03,480
purpose we watch ourselves transform and

1636
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:05,760
we believe in the good in life again

1637
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:07,619
we get reacquainted with our path in

1638
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:10,680
this world we find our way back home

1639
01:05:07,619 --> 01:05:13,380
with peace in our heart and soul

1640
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:16,680
the truth about the world ourselves life

1641
01:05:13,380 --> 01:05:18,359
purpose it all comes down to healing and

1642
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:20,160
the truth about healing is now in your

1643
01:05:18,359 --> 01:05:21,599
hands just wanted to read that to you

1644
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:25,160
guys

1645
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:25,160
hope I did it justice

1646
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:30,000
mixed up a couple little words in there

1647
01:05:27,059 --> 01:05:32,099
but did my best

1648
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:34,500
Gabriella says it's been crazy since

1649
01:05:32,099 --> 01:05:36,359
2016.

1650
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:38,760
I agree

1651
01:05:36,359 --> 01:05:40,980
couldn't agree more

1652
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:42,480
you guys sign up to the collecting

1653
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:44,280
