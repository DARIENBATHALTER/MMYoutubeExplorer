[33.18 - 36.90] like that usually what I do is something
[35.64 - 37.92] different but I want to show you the
[36.90 - 39.60] whole thing and I'll talk about the
[37.92 - 40.92] Rosemary a little later got the celery
[39.60 - 43.68] got lemons you got a whole bunch of
[40.92 - 44.70] different stuff here uh lots of stuff to

[44.70 - 48.90] make four hummuses right so it's awesome
[46.86 - 52.76] and then I got the nut Butters the
[48.90 - 56.10] roasted nuts ready for the nut Butters
[52.76 - 57.66] how cool is this right so I'm gonna get
[56.10 - 59.94] started right now I'm just gonna prepare
[57.66 - 61.68] a little garlic I just actually took off
[59.94 - 63.18] the sheath of the garlic and now I'm
[61.68 - 65.88] just chopping it up a little bit because
[63.18 - 67.32] I'm making a chickpea garbanzo bean
[65.88 - 69.60] chickpea right there can you see that
[67.32 - 71.16] there you go perfect I'm making that
[69.60 - 72.72] hummus first
[71.16 - 74.76] now if you're wondering what other
[72.72 - 76.94] hummus is I'm making I'm making a lentil
[74.76 - 79.38] hummus I'm going to be making
[76.94 - 82.92] cannellini bean hummus I'm going to make
[79.38 - 85.68] a black bean hummus too so it's going to
[82.92 - 87.60] be incredible so let's get going
[85.68 - 90.42] so much to show you guys so much going
[87.60 - 91.86] on here so I'm gonna move these check
[90.42 - 93.72] that out right there so I want to see if
[91.86 - 96.42] you can see that pretty clear
[93.72 - 98.22] these are the garbanzo beans right there
[96.42 - 99.60] now I don't like store-bought hummus I
[98.22 - 101.34] was talking about that earlier I could
[99.60 - 102.78] talk about that later too store-bought
[101.34 - 104.40] hummus will have natural flavors in
[102.78 - 106.26] there which is toxic it'll have citric
[104.40 - 107.64] acid in there which is toxic they don't
[106.26 - 110.64] have nutritional yeast in there which is
[107.64 - 113.52] toxic so this is really healthy healthy
[110.64 - 116.58] hummus and this is the hummus that I
[113.52 - 118.32] make for friends and family and anyone
[116.58 - 120.42] that's coming over or something or for
[118.32 - 122.64] holidays which is exciting too so we
[120.42 - 128.28] move that over
[122.64 - 130.62] and I'm gonna get the mm 1500 over here
[128.28 - 133.08] now so many so many of you guys have the
[130.62 - 134.64] mm1500 you probably already make your
[133.08 - 135.78] own hummus
[134.64 - 138.96] so
[135.78 - 141.78] I'm doing that here excited
[138.96 - 145.14] so I'm going to start out with firing it
[141.78 - 148.02] up let's make the garbanzo bean hummus
[145.14 - 150.30] right off the running
[148.02 - 152.28] this is awesome that's all I could say
[150.30 - 155.10] so in this one it's going to be garbanzo
[152.28 - 158.58] beans or chickpeas same thing
[155.10 - 162.54] garlic lemon chili pepper flakes what
[158.58 - 164.70] else cumin and sesame seeds now check
[162.54 - 165.54] this out you guys I got sesame seeds
[164.70 - 168.18] here
[165.54 - 170.22] so I have sesame seeds right here and
[168.18 - 171.96] let me get this off because this kind of
[170.22 - 173.04] gets all noisy in the machine let me
[171.96 - 176.22] take that out
[173.04 - 179.28] so the sesame seeds I put into the
[176.22 - 181.08] machine instead of like see because what
[179.28 - 182.46] happens is hummus is really fattening
[181.08 - 185.22] because it'll have a lot of different
[182.46 - 187.44] oil in it or fat in it there's either a
[185.22 - 190.38] lot of olive oil or canola oil when you
[187.44 - 193.08] buy store-bought hummus it usually has
[190.38 - 195.48] the canola oil in it so that's the big
[193.08 - 198.54] thing with that so and I don't like that
[195.48 - 200.64] it'll have a blend of canola and olive
[198.54 - 203.76] oil in it so when you buy store-bought
[200.64 - 205.50] or it'll have a really low-grade tahini
[203.76 - 207.48] so what I like to do is just get the
[205.50 - 210.42] sesame seeds
[207.48 - 211.98] and when you get the sesame seeds you
[210.42 - 213.96] can do it that way it's so much better
[211.98 - 215.34] and you put it into the machine when you
[213.96 - 218.16] make your own hummus
[215.34 - 221.24] that's my favorite way of doing it
[218.16 - 221.24] so let's drop some
[221.96 - 226.08] let's drop some beans in here some
[224.40 - 228.74] garbanzos
[226.08 - 228.74] there we go
[230.22 - 236.28] I like to drop some seeds in here too
[234.42 - 237.96] now take a look at this right here which
[236.28 - 241.26] is really incredible we'll do a close-up
[237.96 - 243.96] on here as well let me cut a lemon
[241.26 - 246.30] do you see how incredible it is you can
[243.96 - 250.68] make a fat-free hummus
[246.30 - 252.54] with no oil no tahini no anything and
[250.68 - 254.82] it's the machine makes it in a way that
[252.54 - 257.16] I've never seen a blender make it
[254.82 - 259.02] I've never seen anything naked it's that
[257.16 - 262.02] incredible you want to even think about
[259.02 - 264.12] it so I'm gonna drop some more garbanzos
[262.02 - 266.70] in I'm gonna squeeze a little bit of
[264.12 - 270.86] lemon juice in here too
[266.70 - 270.86] I'm gonna put some more sesame seeds
[271.56 - 275.04] you know when I have people over during
[273.24 - 276.48] the holidays and I make it in front of
[275.04 - 279.48] them they're like you're always like
[276.48 - 281.58] blown away they're like medical Medium
[279.48 - 283.62] you're you're at it again you know like
[281.58 - 285.48] you're doing the coolest thing so I'm
[283.62 - 286.80] dropping some more sesame seeds in here
[285.48 - 289.56] just like this
[286.80 - 291.48] got to think about it how they're just
[289.56 - 294.66] using a little bit of sesame seeds
[291.48 - 297.18] you're not drowning it in oil and sesame
[294.66 - 298.44] oil or anything like that it's so
[297.18 - 300.80] incredible when you even think about
[298.44 - 300.80] that
[302.10 - 306.42] so
[303.84 - 308.84] you're watching those garbanzos come
[306.42 - 308.84] right out
[315.78 - 319.86] now you can actually put a little bit of
[317.88 - 322.50] salt if that's what you like right let
[319.86 - 324.42] me get a little bit of salt
[322.50 - 326.88] if you want a little pinch of salt in
[324.42 - 327.90] here too get a little pinch of salt in
[326.88 - 331.40] there
[327.90 - 331.40] add some more garbanzos
[332.28 - 336.54] these recipes are incredible for every
[334.32 - 339.78] day it's not just holiday this is every
[336.54 - 343.56] day you know that's how great these are
[339.78 - 344.82] for people friends family children
[343.56 - 346.68] so easy
[344.82 - 348.78] so you're watching
[346.68 - 351.06] how the garbanzos come out of the
[348.78 - 354.30] machine which is so incredible I'm gonna
[351.06 - 355.98] drop a little bit more in here this
[354.30 - 357.72] I'm going to drop a few more sesame
[355.98 - 362.10] seeds just think about
[357.72 - 364.08] like you're just using the sesame seed
[362.10 - 367.22] it's incredible a little bit more salt
[364.08 - 367.22] and a little bit more lemon
[367.50 - 371.04] it's amazing really it's actually
[369.48 - 372.96] amazing
[371.04 - 377.06] now I'm also going to add some spices
[372.96 - 377.06] you can mix the spices in later
[377.82 - 382.14] so I'm going to add a little bit of
[379.02 - 383.82] chili pepper flakes
[382.14 - 385.44] there we go
[383.82 - 387.12] that's it you can make as much as you
[385.44 - 389.58] want
[387.12 - 393.12] saves you money it's less expensive than
[389.58 - 395.10] buying it pre-made in the store
[393.12 - 397.58] which is incredible all on its own so
[395.10 - 397.58] there you go
[398.34 - 402.08] no harmful additives
[402.54 - 406.92] natural flavors are harmful
[405.06 - 408.66] in all products
[406.92 - 410.16] it's one of the greatest scams if you've
[408.66 - 411.66] heard the medical medium podcast at
[410.16 - 414.14] Apple podcast I talk about the natural
[411.66 - 414.14] flavors
[417.96 - 423.92] so there you go
[420.78 - 423.92] we got some hummus
[426.72 - 430.20] I mean you don't have to just do this
[428.64 - 433.14] for the holidays you don't have to make
[430.20 - 436.10] it for then you can make it for
[433.14 - 436.10] at any time
[440.22 - 444.98] then you just mix it you can put some
[441.96 - 444.98] spices in there too
[445.08 - 449.40] so what I'm going to add is a little bit
[446.82 - 451.76] of chili pepper flakes right here pop a
[449.40 - 451.76] few on
[451.80 - 456.84] put in my hand and sprinkle a few in
[453.90 - 459.48] there I like it spicy I Like It Hot I
[456.84 - 461.82] don't know about you guys
[459.48 - 462.72] I'm adding a little bit of cumin in here
[461.82 - 465.98] too
[462.72 - 465.98] cracking that in here
[468.60 - 471.32] and
[472.92 - 475.28] so
[475.68 - 479.94] I'm gonna move these out of the way a
[477.78 - 482.04] little bit this is some kale it's kind
[479.94 - 483.72] of in the way here
[482.04 - 487.40] there we go
[483.72 - 487.40] so can you guys take a look at that
[488.04 - 492.32] so I'm going to mix up those spices in
[490.14 - 492.32] here
[492.90 - 498.24] so what's incredible is this isn't a
[495.18 - 499.50] hummus that's greasy that's loaded with
[498.24 - 501.84] oil
[499.50 - 503.70] that's loaded with
[501.84 - 505.44] a really high fat because that's what
[503.70 - 508.14] the hummuses are it doesn't have
[505.44 - 509.34] nutritional yeast in it which is toxic I
[508.14 - 510.78] know there's many of you guys that eat
[509.34 - 512.22] new nutritional yeast and you don't know
[510.78 - 514.98] about the medical medium information
[512.22 - 517.26] about nutritional yeast just don't judge
[514.98 - 519.06] me on that right now maybe like another
[517.26 - 521.64] day kind of learn about it and be like
[519.06 - 524.64] okay let's look into that with mm info
[521.64 - 526.26] but either way and if look I'm not
[524.64 - 527.76] judging you either about if you buy a
[526.26 - 529.44] hummus and it's got nutritional yeast in
[527.76 - 531.90] it or it's got natural flavors and
[529.44 - 533.76] citric acid fine I'm not judging you at
[531.90 - 535.74] all as a bad person you're a good person
[533.76 - 538.20] you're just buying a hummus that
[535.74 - 540.30] you may not know but isn't good for you
[538.20 - 542.88] even though you think it could be good
[540.30 - 545.04] for you and that's the really kind of
[542.88 - 546.84] tricky thing all about it
[545.04 - 549.54] now you can put fresh herbs on your
[546.84 - 551.10] hummus so I just mixed it up like this
[549.54 - 553.74] just to get everything in there a little
[551.10 - 556.08] bit and then there you go there it is
[553.74 - 559.82] now I'm going to put it in a little bit
[556.08 - 559.82] of a bowl a little Bowl here
[560.70 - 566.64] let me get a spoon I'm gonna scoop it
[563.82 - 569.30] out I think I'm gonna put some fresh
[566.64 - 571.98] parsley on top
[569.30 - 574.62] to give it like a really nice look too
[571.98 - 578.04] and a little extra parsley flavor
[574.62 - 579.66] Laura Atkinson asked um over there on
[578.04 - 582.78] Facebook what machine are you using for
[579.66 - 586.02] that I'm using the mm-1500
[582.78 - 587.70] here it is it's 25 off right now the
[586.02 - 591.00] link is in the description
[587.70 - 592.50] and what this machine does a lot I think
[591.00 - 594.06] a lot of people a lot of you guys might
[592.50 - 595.50] have this machine and you already know
[594.06 - 597.90] but what it does
[595.50 - 601.62] is it makes a lot of things you make
[597.90 - 603.48] salsa hummuses nut Butters nut milks ice
[601.62 - 605.34] cream but
[603.48 - 608.34] something that's really important too is
[605.34 - 610.98] it makes green juice and it makes celery
[608.34 - 612.72] juice and it saves you money because it
[610.98 - 615.72] squeezes the juice out we'll get I'll
[612.72 - 618.50] actually make a little juice too
[615.72 - 618.50] okay
[618.66 - 624.06] so I'm going to pop a little parsley on
[621.42 - 626.10] here if you guys don't mind
[624.06 - 628.76] let's see
[626.10 - 628.76] here we are
[630.84 - 633.90] let me just chop some up maybe we can
[632.64 - 636.68] take a look too I'll give you a close-up
[633.90 - 636.68] on that as well
[638.04 - 641.00] get our camera's working
[642.90 - 649.38] there we go so we got our parsley
[646.46 - 652.34] and the parsley I'm going to sprinkle it
[649.38 - 652.34] right on top of here
[655.08 - 658.94] okay now this is going to go
[660.74 - 664.16] right in here
[667.26 - 671.76] so I want to give you a close-up on that
[668.88 - 673.92] you guys so on IG can you see that and
[671.76 - 675.66] then here you go how does that look you
[673.92 - 677.34] guys
[675.66 - 679.74] so that's the hummus right there now
[677.34 - 681.42] think about how incredible that hummus
[679.74 - 684.90] is
[681.42 - 687.36] because one reason it doesn't have all
[684.90 - 689.10] that oil in there
[687.36 - 690.90] so you know you're not bogging down your
[689.10 - 694.62] liver with all that oil
[690.90 - 696.30] and hummuses have cheap oil in them
[694.62 - 699.84] store-bought too
[696.30 - 701.46] so what that means is spoiled oil right
[699.84 - 704.34] Rancid
[701.46 - 706.74] it's bulk it's for you know big
[704.34 - 708.60] purchases for the company to actually
[706.74 - 710.52] just put it in you know each container
[708.60 - 712.02] it's just you don't like that it's not a
[710.52 - 714.12] good thing this is homemade this is
[712.02 - 715.26] actually clean which is really
[714.12 - 717.48] incredible
[715.26 - 720.18] and it doesn't get any cleaner than that
[717.48 - 722.22] okay so you can buy your chickpeas
[720.18 - 724.02] garbanzo beans that's a really good
[722.22 - 726.06] Focus right there it's fantastic
[724.02 - 728.76] and you can actually make the cleanest
[726.06 - 731.58] hummus you ever want it to make and you
[728.76 - 734.64] still have that Sesame behind it because
[731.58 - 737.34] I used the sesame seed and the sesame
[734.64 - 739.74] seed was pulverized in here
[737.34 - 741.42] so it's not like it's whole seeds now
[739.74 - 742.74] that's what's incredible about the
[741.42 - 745.02] machine
[742.74 - 747.36] you're actually looking at pulverized
[745.02 - 750.96] sesame seeds when they went through here
[747.36 - 753.36] and that's the nice subtle flavor behind
[750.96 - 755.58] there that's really nice too
[753.36 - 757.44] so Mega juicers.com they're having the
[755.58 - 759.00] biggest sale of the year right now just
[757.44 - 762.00] so you know it only goes for a couple
[759.00 - 764.16] more days this is the mm-1500
[762.00 - 766.08] stick around because your mind is going
[764.16 - 768.66] to be blown when I make nut Butters
[766.08 - 771.00] because my mind is always blown when I
[768.66 - 772.08] make nut Butters with the mm-1500 and
[771.00 - 775.74] I'm also going to show you how to save
[772.08 - 778.86] money with juices too because food costs
[775.74 - 780.90] are up the mm-1500 all it does is pay
[778.86 - 783.36] for itself over and over again pays for
[780.90 - 785.40] itself and pays for itself so I'm like
[783.36 - 789.12] pumped up about that all right

[789.12 - 792.24] really cool

[792.24 - 796.08] now you might not be making four
[793.92 - 797.88] different hummuses when you make a
[796.08 - 799.20] hummus you might make one that day and
[797.88 - 801.60] that's the one you make so we're right
[799.20 - 803.10] now we're doing more than that so we're
[801.60 - 805.50] gonna have some fun we're gonna do the
[803.10 - 808.38] cannellini bean hummus

[816.12 - 819.54] here's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna do
[817.38 - 821.16] some fresh herbs in this one so I just
[819.54 - 823.32] like the way it looks with the fresh
[821.16 - 825.00] herbs of cannellini beans I'm gonna use
[823.32 - 827.76] some arugula I'm gonna use some lemon
[825.00 - 829.80] some parsley what else uh sesame seeds
[827.76 - 831.18] again and I'm gonna use some black
[829.80 - 833.40] pepper
[831.18 - 835.32] and a little pinch of salt in this one
[833.40 - 837.66] so let me just get the black pepper just
[835.32 - 840.30] ready for a little later which is really
[837.66 - 843.48] cool I got salt the black pepper right
[840.30 - 845.46] there and I got my herbs so on the herb
[843.48 - 849.30] front this is going to be a fresh herb
[845.46 - 851.40] one so I'm gonna add the arugula into it
[849.30 - 853.68] as I'm making it so I'm going to chop up
[851.40 - 856.38] a little bit of arugula now and just get
[853.68 - 860.36] ready and prep for it real quick
[856.38 - 860.36] so let's do that here's arugula
[860.46 - 863.66] so I'm going to chop it up
[866.00 - 870.60] you can mix it into it afterwards as
[868.98 - 872.40] well which I like to do but I'm going to
[870.60 - 873.72] add a little bit in there
[872.40 - 876.06] I'll put those stems there I want to
[873.72 - 878.04] save those I don't like tossing those
[876.06 - 880.58] stems they're just so good
[878.04 - 880.58] right
[880.80 - 885.48] okay we got arugula ready what else am I
[883.32 - 887.22] going to put in there besides arugula I
[885.48 - 889.98] think that's it um
[887.22 - 891.48] some parsley too
[889.98 - 894.92] so let me chop up a little bit more
[891.48 - 894.92] parsley how about that
[897.90 - 900.50] foreign
[904.70 - 911.40] okay all right
[908.24 - 912.90] I think what's happening is that Jews
[911.40 - 915.36] are strong stuff out of focus a little
[912.90 - 918.06] bit all right let's see what we got
[915.36 - 921.50] let's fire this up

[939.12 - 944.64] right I'm going to drop some sesame
[941.64 - 947.30] seeds in here too to get pulverized so
[944.64 - 947.30] I'm excited about
[950.52 - 954.84] you need when you're making a hummus if
[953.40 - 957.30] you're just using a little bit of sesame
[954.84 - 959.88] seeds like how awesome is that would
[957.30 - 964.04] even think about it and it's so great
[959.88 - 964.04] had a few more of these cannellini beans
[965.22 - 970.86] so let's get this moving I'm going to

[1009.32 - 1013.94] so we're talking about adding medicine
[1011.72 - 1016.64] into this really I mean that's what it's
[1013.94 - 1017.90] about you're making a medicinal hummus

[1025.34 - 1029.98] got a better one right here filled up
[1027.44 - 1029.98] there we go
[1030.50 - 1034.04] so you're talking about the medicinal
[1032.30 - 1035.38] Factor when you're doing fresh herbs
[1034.04 - 1040.76] like that
[1035.38 - 1043.96] I'm gonna add some more fresh herb right

[1050.12 - 1053.32] a little bit of salt
[1053.36 - 1057.26] so many of you guys like salt so I just
[1055.28 - 1059.24] don't want to take that away from you

[1059.24 - 1061.66] want salt

[1119.30 - 1123.14] of pepper

[1123.14 - 1127.46] add a little bit of pepper to this one

[1127.46 - 1130.58] pepper on there
[1128.84 - 1134.30] because a lot of people love black
[1130.58 - 1135.74] pepper in their hummus so it gives it
[1134.30 - 1137.48] that flavor

[1196.70 - 1200.60] this is just an incredible hummus now
[1198.68 - 1202.64] think about the medicine involved in
[1200.60 - 1204.50] this one when you make your own hummus
[1202.64 - 1207.80] there's a big difference you guys
[1204.50 - 1209.96] you're putting in your fresh herbs this

[1212.36 - 1216.32] entirely different situation so what I'm

[1261.14 - 1265.40] so people who love hummus
[1263.18 - 1267.62] they love it but they don't realize

[1270.38 - 1274.22] you know a lot of people say oh there he
[1272.36 - 1275.48] goes but I'm actually just trying to be

[1464.60 - 1469.04] insane machine but you know what the
[1466.28 - 1471.02] sickest part of this machine is

[1471.02 - 1474.14] hummuses and nut Butters and nut milks

[1476.00 - 1481.28] and Salsas it's not just that it makes
[1478.58 - 1483.38] what's really sick about it

[1483.38 - 1487.16] your greens
[1484.82 - 1489.08] you really do save money in a machine
[1487.16 - 1491.78] pays for itself that's the sick part

[1541.46 - 1545.32] you can't do that in a blender by the
[1543.26 - 1545.32] way
[1545.36 - 1550.04] you can't you have to add like all that
[1547.58 - 1552.50] oil in the blender you just can't put
[1550.04 - 1554.30] like dry beans in there in the blender
[1552.50 - 1556.12] and make a hummus it just doesn't happen
[1554.30 - 1559.34] but
[1556.12 - 1561.08] the blender heats up everything too it
[1559.34 - 1563.90] just burns it all in there like the
[1561.08 - 1566.30] friction this is different
[1563.90 - 1569.42] this is like a cold pressed masticating
[1566.30 - 1573.80] juicer but it has attachments so you can
[1569.42 - 1576.14] do this which is is really a blessing
[1573.80 - 1577.94] Mary Murphy says I have this juicer and
[1576.14 - 1579.74] I have only used it for celery so far I
[1577.94 - 1581.54] can't wait to experiment more and that's
[1579.74 - 1583.28] one of the reasons why I'm doing this
[1581.54 - 1585.98] today because I never get a chance to
[1583.28 - 1587.12] show you guys what the mm-1500 does I'm
[1585.98 - 1589.22] always showing you guys you know how
[1587.12 - 1591.14] food costs are going up and produce
[1589.22 - 1593.18] costs money and everything costs money
[1591.14 - 1595.16] I always just worry about that all the
[1593.18 - 1596.66] time so I'm just being real about this
[1595.16 - 1598.10] I'm always worried about how do I get
[1596.66 - 1599.84] people with chronic illness to save
[1598.10 - 1602.54] money how do I get people to save money
[1599.84 - 1604.16] and saving money it's the only juicer
[1602.54 - 1606.20] that has such a compression where it
[1604.16 - 1609.26] actually squeezes out all the juice
[1606.20 - 1611.54] and so you buy less celery less greens
[1609.26 - 1612.86] less things you want to juice right so
[1611.54 - 1614.60] it saves you money and it pays for
[1612.86 - 1615.98] itself that's that's what I'm always
[1614.60 - 1618.50] screaming about
[1615.98 - 1620.66] but the thing is is that when I'm always
[1618.50 - 1623.42] doing that I don't get a chance to show
[1620.66 - 1626.96] you like what it does like it is a sick
[1623.42 - 1629.06] juicer like it's insane actually so I
[1626.96 - 1630.44] just made some black bean hummus now I
[1629.06 - 1631.88] want to add some spices and everything
[1630.44 - 1635.74] to it
[1631.88 - 1635.74] which I'm excited about okay
[1636.32 - 1642.62] for those who are asking yes I'm using
[1639.02 - 1644.48] canned or boxed beans today I am

[1667.04 - 1671.84] is revolutional with all these different
[1669.38 - 1674.42] things it does and it's really

[1724.94 - 1730.04] is the black bean hummus now what's your
[1727.22 - 1731.48] what you notice here this is an oil this
[1730.04 - 1734.18] isn't Grease
[1731.48 - 1736.22] this isn't just all that oil like I just
[1734.18 - 1739.34] put sesame seeds that were pulverized in

[1771.20 - 1776.30] get a good Focus right there I think
[1774.08 - 1779.90] so the chili pit you can put chili
[1776.30 - 1782.54] flakes on top a few just like this
[1779.90 - 1784.58] just to get it to look a certain way you
[1782.54 - 1786.44] can put a little bit more
[1784.58 - 1789.14] um heat on top as well so I'm going to
[1786.44 - 1790.46] drop a little bit more Chipotle
[1789.14 - 1792.20] right there

[2028.78 - 2031.78] insane so I'm just letting you know
[2030.34 - 2034.44] right now okay
[2031.78 - 2034.44] so
[2035.86 - 2041.50] this is a lentil Sage
[2038.50 - 2041.50] Rosemary
[2042.94 - 2047.74] hummus right here
[2045.04 - 2049.48] you can do what you want be you do you
[2047.74 - 2051.16] make the hummus you want with all the
[2049.48 - 2052.84] ingredients and spices you want to make
[2051.16 - 2055.18] I'm showing you four different kind of
[2052.84 - 2056.74] hummuses that I make I'm adding a little
[2055.18 - 2058.72] bit more
[2056.74 - 2061.84] here we go let's put a little bit more
[2058.72 - 2065.02] sesame seed in here do you realize how
[2061.84 - 2067.06] very little tahini was used with just
[2065.02 - 2069.16] some sesame seeds I made all these
[2067.06 - 2071.38] hummuses and that's like this saves you
[2069.16 - 2073.96] money I can't even tell you how much
[2071.38 - 2076.14] money all around to get flavorable food
[2073.96 - 2079.48] like if anything
[2076.14 - 2082.78] and I I told you guys the other day
[2079.48 - 2086.08] the the mm-1500 900 came about because
[2082.78 - 2088.72] how can I get medicine in people who are
[2086.08 - 2092.74] chronically ill and save them money
[2088.72 - 2095.98] that was all it was about is how do I
[2092.74 - 2098.44] have people save money so that it pays
[2095.98 - 2099.94] for itself because I couldn't find that
[2098.44 - 2101.56] out there with all the juicers I would
[2099.94 - 2103.60] purchase all these years
[2101.56 - 2105.34] I couldn't find a juicer that paid for
[2103.60 - 2108.76] itself it just seemed
[2105.34 - 2111.34] master that was costing money and
[2108.76 - 2114.34] people don't realize that it was like it
[2111.34 - 2115.96] never paid for itself and so the mm 1500
[2114.34 - 2119.68] 900 was
[2115.96 - 2121.60] designed to make it so the consumer
[2119.68 - 2123.16] was not only getting medicine because
[2121.60 - 2125.08] that's what I wanted I wanted medicine
[2123.16 - 2127.02] and people the other thing I wanted it
[2125.08 - 2130.90] to pay for itself
[2127.02 - 2133.78] people were always saying well they have
[2130.90 - 2136.24] problems with like resources and stuff
[2133.78 - 2138.64] like that because they don't have any
[2136.24 - 2140.32] money or resources and how are they
[2138.64 - 2142.42] going to heal if they don't have things
[2140.32 - 2144.76] a little that's what it's about it's
[2142.42 - 2148.56] about finding other options
[2144.76 - 2151.18] creating other options you know
[2148.56 - 2153.34] and that's what it's really about it's
[2151.18 - 2157.42] about saving money where you can
[2153.34 - 2159.28] it's about saving money I mean I worked
[2157.42 - 2161.92] with so many people for so many years
[2159.28 - 2165.16] and
[2161.92 - 2166.18] and it's like not everybody is Rich out
[2165.16 - 2167.98] there
[2166.18 - 2170.34] I know the other juicer companies think
[2167.98 - 2173.92] that everybody's rich
[2170.34 - 2177.94] but they're not not everybody's Rich out
[2173.92 - 2180.52] there okay so how can we heal and do it
[2177.94 - 2181.78] in a way that we can save money and
[2180.52 - 2184.48] everything and that's what it was really
[2181.78 - 2186.82] about it's a cold pressed masticating
[2184.48 - 2188.10] juicer it does so many things
[2186.82 - 2192.36] anyway
[2188.10 - 2192.36] so let's actually do this now
[2192.76 - 2197.98] this is the lentil hummus now with the
[2195.64 - 2201.34] lentil hummus I'm going to add a little
[2197.98 - 2204.28] bit of salt in there too

[2331.66 - 2336.46] right there incredible
[2334.18 - 2338.74] see guys I'm gonna just do a little
[2336.46 - 2340.78] cleaning up in front of you here and
[2338.74 - 2342.40] we're gonna make nut Butters
[2340.78 - 2345.22] three nut Butters
[2342.40 - 2347.20] I got the nuts toasted
[2345.22 - 2350.26] and we're ready for some roasted toasted
[2347.20 - 2351.76] nut butter from the mm-1500
[2350.26 - 2353.98] so let's do it I'm gonna move some stuff
[2351.76 - 2356.76] out of the way
[2353.98 - 2356.76] you don't mind
[2359.38 - 2363.46] so
[2361.24 - 2365.82] we'll do a quick little cleanup as well
[2363.46 - 2365.82] okay
[2366.88 - 2371.14] got a question right there difference
[2368.14 - 2373.72] between a 900 and 1500 the 900
[2371.14 - 2376.30] you can juice your celery
[2373.72 - 2378.58] and you save money because it's pushing
[2376.30 - 2380.44] out so much juice and the pulp's coming
[2378.58 - 2382.78] out that dry bulb right that's the
[2380.44 - 2383.92] mm-900 you can put greens you can do
[2382.78 - 2385.66] green juices
[2383.92 - 2388.00] you can do your celery juice
[2385.66 - 2389.50] and that machine can take a beaten
[2388.00 - 2391.18] that's something that people don't
[2389.50 - 2392.74] realize
[2391.18 - 2395.26] people who juice
[2392.74 - 2398.44] they'll have a juicer for like five
[2395.26 - 2400.18] years they only use it once a month
[2398.44 - 2402.04] maybe they use it for three months in a
[2400.18 - 2404.02] row and then never use it again
[2402.04 - 2406.72] and so it sits there right the medical
[2404.02 - 2408.94] medium community and like me I juice
[2406.72 - 2409.78] every day I'll juice multiple times a
[2408.94 - 2412.72] day
[2409.78 - 2416.50] I juice every single day seven days a
[2412.72 - 2421.18] week every year and so what I love about
[2416.50 - 2423.52] the mm900 and 1500 the engine
[2421.18 - 2424.54] the engine supersedes anything I've seen
[2423.52 - 2426.82] out there
[2424.54 - 2429.40] so it's the power of the engine and how
[2426.82 - 2431.92] it's well built right because what
[2429.40 - 2433.90] happens is you may get a worn out part
[2431.92 - 2435.64] but then just what call the company get
[2433.90 - 2437.86] a new part right you may get a worn out
[2435.64 - 2439.42] part but the juicer has paid for itself
[2437.86 - 2443.14] over and over again
[2439.42 - 2445.48] you have saved money and saved money and
[2443.14 - 2447.94] money can you're using the heck out of
[2445.48 - 2449.20] your juicers you try using the heck out
[2447.94 - 2451.54] of some of the other juicers out there
[2449.20 - 2453.76] they break down and the whole engine
[2451.54 - 2457.90] just breaks everything breaks about it
[2453.76 - 2459.88] these are made to get the crap kicked
[2457.90 - 2461.80] out of them they're made for juicing
[2459.88 - 2464.20] every day every day and that's what I do
[2461.80 - 2466.30] and they save money so the 900 is for
[2464.20 - 2467.26] like the green juices and for the celery
[2466.30 - 2471.52] juice
[2467.26 - 2473.92] okay which is incredible the mm-1500 I'm
[2471.52 - 2476.02] showing you all the other stuff
[2473.92 - 2477.28] which is amazing all on its own
[2476.02 - 2480.76] all right so I'm just doing a quick
[2477.28 - 2483.72] little cleanup right here
[2480.76 - 2483.72] if you guys don't mind
[2484.96 - 2490.90] these are my personal recipes I work I'm
[2487.84 - 2493.24] getting them uh if you like look these
[2490.90 - 2495.46] are my personal recipes that I do
[2493.24 - 2498.00] go to medicalmedium.com you can get the
[2495.46 - 2498.00] recipes there
[2499.24 - 2502.48] oh hold on here
[2501.22 - 2503.62] so I'm just gonna need a little more
[2502.48 - 2505.18] cleaning
[2503.62 - 2507.10] I will work on getting them at
[2505.18 - 2509.08] medicalmedium.com that's what I meant
[2507.10 - 2511.48] here all right so I'm going to remove
[2509.08 - 2513.94] this just for easiness
[2511.48 - 2515.08] you can clean this really quick but I
[2513.94 - 2517.00] don't want to waste your time giving
[2515.08 - 2519.64] that a quick clean
[2517.00 - 2522.60] so let's make some
[2519.64 - 2522.60] nut Butters
[2522.76 - 2525.42] right here
[2528.16 - 2531.70] now if you guys just got on here I'm I
[2530.14 - 2533.56] just made four hummuses but what I'm
[2531.70 - 2536.98] gonna do too is I'm gonna make Nut
[2533.56 - 2539.26] Butter I'm gonna make banana ice cream
[2536.98 - 2542.82] and then I'm also going to make some
[2539.26 - 2542.82] celery juice too some green juice
[2543.94 - 2548.46] and I want to show you what I do with
[2545.86 - 2548.46] wheat greens because
[2548.56 - 2551.92] they're not Incorporated enough in
[2550.30 - 2553.48] people's diets I don't care how clean
[2551.92 - 2555.16] they eat they're not doing enough leafy
[2553.48 - 2557.50] greens
[2555.16 - 2560.50] so let's see here's a question from
[2557.50 - 2562.90] mocha so is the 1500 more powerful no
[2560.50 - 2565.42] they're just as powerful
[2562.90 - 2567.28] it's just that the 1500 offers all these
[2565.42 - 2569.80] other things like you can make the
[2567.28 - 2571.12] sauces the hummus is the nut Butters the
[2569.80 - 2572.80] nut milks
[2571.12 - 2574.84] you can make like all these different
[2572.80 - 2576.46] things to sorbets the ice creams right
[2574.84 - 2578.86] and then you can do your green juices
[2576.46 - 2580.36] too but the 900 you can do your green
[2578.86 - 2581.74] juices and your celery juice is still
[2580.36 - 2583.42] just as powerful they're powerful
[2581.74 - 2586.90] machines
[2583.42 - 2589.24] they're okay get ready for this
[2586.90 - 2592.60] we're gonna make the first
[2589.24 - 2593.86] nut butter and let's see which one we're
[2592.60 - 2596.20] going to start with right here we're
[2593.86 - 2598.72] going to start with
[2596.20 - 2601.80] cashew butter take a look at the cashews
[2598.72 - 2601.80] let's get a quick look on that
[2603.10 - 2606.76] I just toasted these can you take a look
[2605.44 - 2609.10] at them
[2606.76 - 2611.14] so these are toasted
[2609.10 - 2614.02] you can kind of see it too
[2611.14 - 2616.36] they're a little toasty looking
[2614.02 - 2619.56] if that actually if you know what I'm
[2616.36 - 2619.56] saying right okay
[2619.66 - 2622.32] now
[2623.44 - 2628.14] before we go into making this I want to
[2625.72 - 2628.14] show you something
[2630.82 - 2635.08] this is going to be an education for a
[2633.28 - 2637.18] second you guys you gotta check this out
[2635.08 - 2638.98] Brenda says can a normal juicer make
[2637.18 - 2640.54] these things no they can't a normal
[2638.98 - 2641.98] juicer cannot make these things it's the
[2640.54 - 2643.72] mm-1500
[2641.98 - 2645.94] and a normal juicer cannot save you
[2643.72 - 2649.78] money when you're juicing or save you
[2645.94 - 2652.06] money in foods this is to battle the
[2649.78 - 2655.24] rising food costs that were starting to
[2652.06 - 2659.38] happen in 2019.
[2655.24 - 2661.90] so in 2019 food costs were Rising
[2659.38 - 2663.16] and I was worried about people with
[2661.90 - 2666.40] chronic illness
[2663.16 - 2667.66] being able to heal themselves and save
[2666.40 - 2670.84] money
[2667.66 - 2672.88] that's how these were created
[2670.84 - 2675.34] there was a real mission
[2672.88 - 2677.14] and real love behind it
[2675.34 - 2679.42] or I would have been the juicer guy for
[2677.14 - 2681.70] the last 30 years if it was just me to
[2679.42 - 2683.32] be a juicer guy like hey aw is now a
[2681.70 - 2684.58] juicer guy I would have done that for
[2683.32 - 2685.60] the last 30 years if it was just about
[2684.58 - 2688.66] that
[2685.60 - 2691.78] but it wasn't in 2019
[2688.66 - 2693.94] the mission was oh my God
[2691.78 - 2695.80] food costs are going up
[2693.94 - 2697.48] and up and up
[2695.80 - 2699.70] how do we do this
[2697.48 - 2703.90] like how do we heal people
[2699.70 - 2705.52] and so a juicer is a medicine maker and
[2703.90 - 2707.44] then when it's done right like this and
[2705.52 - 2709.30] it's squeezing out everything including
[2707.44 - 2711.16] those nutrients everything gets squeezed
[2709.30 - 2713.56] out when you make your medicine it has
[2711.16 - 2716.02] to be good and it has to save you money
[2713.56 - 2718.86] people were struggling to buy celery
[2716.02 - 2721.00] because there's juicers who are wasting
[2718.86 - 2723.40] the money
[2721.00 - 2725.44] so people were struggling they'd have to
[2723.40 - 2727.48] buy so much celery
[2725.44 - 2730.18] but they needed the celery juice to heal
[2727.48 - 2731.62] their conditions and symptoms do you see
[2730.18 - 2733.72] the problem we had
[2731.62 - 2736.24] it was like spirit and compassion and I
[2733.72 - 2738.64] were like okay they need their herbal
[2736.24 - 2740.92] medicine which is the celery juice it's
[2738.64 - 2744.34] already saved so many lives out there
[2740.92 - 2746.26] but let's let's do something to actually
[2744.34 - 2748.72] help people because to see I saw people
[2746.26 - 2751.12] going into the store and buying a lot of
[2748.72 - 2752.68] celery and then running all that celery
[2751.12 - 2754.18] through all their juicers including the
[2752.68 - 2755.80] fancy ones that have that are out there
[2754.18 - 2758.14] now that you see every day right now
[2755.80 - 2760.12] with ads and influencers
[2758.14 - 2761.98] and it was just running all that through
[2760.12 - 2763.96] yeah they'd have some juice a pile of
[2761.98 - 2766.30] juice but they were spending this this
[2763.96 - 2767.86] much more money right and so what
[2766.30 - 2769.42] happened was it was like how can we do
[2767.86 - 2771.76] this how can we get medicine herbal
[2769.42 - 2774.64] medicine in people have them save money
[2771.76 - 2776.44] have the machine pay for itself and for
[2774.64 - 2779.08] them to heal
[2776.44 - 2782.50] and now we have the brain shot therapy
[2779.08 - 2784.66] which you need a juicer and the brain
[2782.50 - 2786.46] shot therapy is incredible because it's
[2784.66 - 2788.68] there to help people heal you know it's
[2786.46 - 2790.96] in the brain saver books and so you need
[2788.68 - 2793.36] a juicer that's saving you money and
[2790.96 - 2795.70] allowing you to heal yourself
[2793.36 - 2797.80] that was the mission
[2795.70 - 2800.68] it was about getting all the juice out
[2797.80 - 2803.02] of the wild foods and herbs out of the
[2800.68 - 2806.62] herbs so you have medicine in extraction
[2803.02 - 2809.56] so these were the medicine extractors
[2806.62 - 2811.48] and so the goal was how do we do it
[2809.56 - 2812.92] where it's incredible where the metal
[2811.48 - 2815.14] isn't touching itself I saw somebody
[2812.92 - 2817.12] make a comment a while back after I did
[2815.14 - 2820.24] talked about the mm-1500 and they said
[2817.12 - 2822.52] oh yeah you're just a Salesman
[2820.24 - 2825.88] and they were like yeah metal touching
[2822.52 - 2827.68] metal whatever oh yeah the juicers out
[2825.88 - 2829.54] there either have the
[2827.68 - 2831.16] they just get all dull where do you
[2829.54 - 2833.32] think all that metal goes when that
[2831.16 - 2834.88] centrifuge is doing this
[2833.32 - 2837.40] what do you think all the metal goes
[2834.88 - 2839.44] when the parts are rubbing each other it
[2837.40 - 2842.14] goes in you in the medical mean
[2839.44 - 2843.46] Community they use juicers every day to
[2842.14 - 2846.34] heal themselves
[2843.46 - 2849.28] so I didn't want that metal involved
[2846.34 - 2851.08] it's like there's a lot of thought that
[2849.28 - 2853.36] goes into all of it is what I'm saying
[2851.08 - 2856.24] but we have a lot to make right here and
[2853.36 - 2858.70] also the mm-1500 is quiet and the mm-900
[2856.24 - 2860.62] is quiet and they're easy to clean and
[2858.70 - 2862.00] and when you make sauces it's easy to
[2860.62 - 2863.26] clean when you make nut Butters it's
[2862.00 - 2865.06] easy to clean and when you make nut
[2863.26 - 2868.48] milks it's easy to clean like it's it's
[2865.06 - 2870.10] insane how easy to clean it is
[2868.48 - 2872.62] so I just want to be real with you guys
[2870.10 - 2875.74] like what is this about I could have
[2872.62 - 2878.50] started a Juicer Company 20 years ago
[2875.74 - 2880.78] and been known as the juicer guy and
[2878.50 - 2883.78] sold a trillion juicers in the last 20.
[2880.78 - 2886.36] I didn't want to do that it's specific
[2883.78 - 2889.78] it's for people who are trying to heal
[2886.36 - 2891.58] themselves who need the medicine who are
[2889.78 - 2894.64] chronically ill who may not have a lot
[2891.58 - 2897.22] of money they're not rich
[2894.64 - 2899.74] and we got to get the medicine in them
[2897.22 - 2903.16] you know and so
[2899.74 - 2905.20] and I didn't even start my own juicer
[2903.16 - 2907.54] so I don't have a medical medium juicer
[2905.20 - 2910.06] I could have started a medical medium
[2907.54 - 2912.28] juicer you guys do you know this
[2910.06 - 2914.74] where it was a instead
[2912.28 - 2917.08] I'm helping Omega
[2914.74 - 2919.36] like get their juicer out there that
[2917.08 - 2921.88] they created like I'm actually helping
[2919.36 - 2923.98] them to get it out there for people then
[2921.88 - 2926.74] they create created it in the light that
[2923.98 - 2928.12] I was hoping to help people to say bunny
[2926.74 - 2930.16] and everything
[2928.12 - 2932.50] anyway
[2930.16 - 2934.00] blah blah blah I want to show you
[2932.50 - 2935.50] something that'll blow your mind
[2934.00 - 2938.80] what are you looking at
[2935.50 - 2940.72] can anybody tell me I took the label off
[2938.80 - 2942.40] but it's like this with every nut bugger
[2940.72 - 2943.36] it's not the specific one I have right
[2942.40 - 2945.04] here
[2943.36 - 2946.60] but you see
[2945.04 - 2948.10] the label off I'll get a close-up on
[2946.60 - 2949.96] this right
[2948.10 - 2950.92] see the label off but what do you see
[2949.96 - 2953.26] now
[2950.92 - 2954.82] you see oil sitting at the top so let's
[2953.26 - 2956.08] get a close-up of that do you know what
[2954.82 - 2957.82] do you know what you're looking at some
[2956.08 - 2959.14] of you guys
[2957.82 - 2961.42] see
[2959.14 - 2963.16] now your yours may not look like that
[2961.42 - 2967.24] yet because it didn't sit long enough
[2963.16 - 2970.00] because it was still mixed the oil
[2967.24 - 2972.22] and the nuts or seeds were still mixed

[2972.22 - 2976.96] sit for a long time it'll show you the
[2975.34 - 2979.90] scam

[3001.20 - 3005.28] you the in just like medical medium has
[3003.30 - 3008.70] always done this with podcasts and books
[3005.28 - 3011.10] always gave you the in the no
[3008.70 - 3013.08] okay you ready
[3011.10 - 3014.88] you're looking at a nut butter
[3013.08 - 3017.64] happens to be almond butter
[3014.88 - 3019.26] you're looking at that much oil
[3017.64 - 3024.12] that's oil
[3019.26 - 3027.56] is not from those nuts
[3024.12 - 3027.56] did you guys hear me
[3027.60 - 3032.36] welcome to the world of screw everybody
[3029.94 - 3032.36] over
[3032.76 - 3038.06] this is why I will only make my own nut
[3035.82 - 3038.06] butter
[3038.10 - 3042.06] right there
[3040.50 - 3043.62] and if you can't make your own nut
[3042.06 - 3045.24] butter then I'll recommend the best Nut
[3043.62 - 3048.86] Butter I possibly can or whatever out
[3045.24 - 3048.86] there I'll try to recommend something
[3049.28 - 3054.48] says OMG what
[3052.26 - 3056.28] I'm trying to tell you guys something
[3054.48 - 3057.84] we're gonna make three nut Butters I
[3056.28 - 3059.46] have toasted roasted nuts we're gonna
[3057.84 - 3062.34] make three nut Butters
[3059.46 - 3064.50] Kim Marietta says you're saying the oil
[3062.34 - 3068.28] is not from
[3064.50 - 3071.00] the nut in the jar correct
[3068.28 - 3071.00] correct
[3072.96 - 3077.94] The Nut Butter companies and the seed
[3075.78 - 3079.20] butter companies and the peanut butter
[3077.94 - 3082.82] companies
[3079.20 - 3082.82] mix in an oil
[3084.06 - 3088.26] and then if it's freshly mixed in they
[3086.16 - 3090.72] just did it and they got on the Shelf
[3088.26 - 3094.52] you won't see it do this yet
[3090.72 - 3094.52] but it's still all the same
[3095.88 - 3100.08] so the question is right there I see a
[3097.74 - 3102.54] question down there the question is what
[3100.08 - 3104.28] kind Alexis says what kind of oil are
[3102.54 - 3109.50] they adding
[3104.28 - 3111.48] they are adding a bulk rendition of the
[3109.50 - 3113.88] same oil you ready
[3111.48 - 3115.62] they did the almonds but the oil they're
[3113.88 - 3118.14] adding is not from those almonds it's
[3115.62 - 3120.36] from other almonds from some other part
[3118.14 - 3122.94] of the world that they had to purchase
[3120.36 - 3125.70] in bulk
[3122.94 - 3128.04] a lesser even quality
[3125.70 - 3132.26] that could even be rancid and then they
[3128.04 - 3132.26] put it into the mix
[3134.90 - 3140.16] and spirit of compassion says it's time
[3138.24 - 3141.54] they knew
[3140.16 - 3143.46] I'm going to show you what a real Nut
[3141.54 - 3145.56] Butter looks like
[3143.46 - 3147.66] without adding oil to it so if you're
[3145.56 - 3149.52] feeding your children nut Butters I'm
[3147.66 - 3152.82] going to show you the best Nut Butter
[3149.52 - 3154.98] you can ever make anywhere anyhow
[3152.82 - 3157.32] anyway
[3154.98 - 3159.84] all right
[3157.32 - 3161.46] and just just so you know it's every
[3159.84 - 3165.48] single nut and Seed butter
[3161.46 - 3167.82] they add the oil oh oh I forgot I forgot
[3165.48 - 3169.92] they had the oil because they can use
[3167.82 - 3171.66] less nuts
[3169.92 - 3174.30] hmm
[3171.66 - 3177.96] we're gonna charge you 16 for that
[3174.30 - 3180.06] almond butter jar 18 food costs are
[3177.96 - 3181.86] going up we're gonna charge you twenty
[3180.06 - 3182.94] four dollars for that organic almond
[3181.86 - 3184.50] butter
[3182.94 - 3186.84] but we're not going to give you that
[3184.50 - 3189.30] many almonds you see what we're going to
[3186.84 - 3192.78] do suckers is we're going to just give
[3189.30 - 3194.46] you less almonds jack up the price and
[3192.78 - 3198.24] add a whole bunch of oil in there that's
[3194.46 - 3201.66] cheaper they buy the oil cheaper
[3198.24 - 3203.94] in bulk and then they can supplement the
[3201.66 - 3206.58] oil into all of the nut and Seed Butters
[3203.94 - 3209.76] all the companies and then you get less
[3206.58 - 3211.80] almonds and less nuts you guys
[3209.76 - 3213.60] the vegans don't know this the vegan
[3211.80 - 3215.88] doctors don't know this
[3213.60 - 3217.92] the vegan experts don't know this the
[3215.88 - 3219.78] vegan authorities don't know this the
[3217.92 - 3222.06] keto authorities don't know this the
[3219.78 - 3223.98] keto trainers don't know this none of
[3222.06 - 3227.10] them know this another original and
[3223.98 - 3229.92] unique piece of information which also
[3227.10 - 3233.40] gets me in trouble because when I go and
[3229.92 - 3236.28] do this stuff and say this stuff
[3233.40 - 3239.28] I get a whole bunch of for it
[3236.28 - 3242.22] and so but I always say this
[3239.28 - 3244.26] you tell The Chronic Leo the truth it
[3242.22 - 3245.10] outweighs the big kick in the ass that
[3244.26 - 3246.96] you get
[3245.10 - 3248.46] you know like you got to tell them the
[3246.96 - 3250.38] truth because you have to get them
[3248.46 - 3251.58] better you have they have to know how it
[3250.38 - 3253.44] works in the world
[3251.58 - 3254.88] and then you can take the kick you know
[3253.44 - 3256.92] the kick and the stab in the back and
[3254.88 - 3260.96] the kick in the butt
[3256.92 - 3260.96] anyway let's go let's do it
[3261.18 - 3264.36] I mean you know people say well he's not

[3702.12 - 3708.48] when these machines
[3703.92 - 3710.16] were done and I knew like when you save
[3708.48 - 3712.56] people money and you give them something
[3710.16 - 3715.20] like would you give them options for
[3712.56 - 3718.40] Pure Food it just it feels really good
[3715.20 - 3718.40] you know because it's like
[3720.24 - 3724.28] I gotta put myself in
[3721.86 - 3724.28] there always

[3740.88 - 3746.16] oil they add into the jar that doesn't
[3743.16 - 3748.26] belong to those walnuts
[3746.16 - 3751.09] keep that in mind
[3748.26 - 3752.82] that's your pure nut butter
[3751.09 - 3755.10] [Music]

[3759.72 - 3764.34] here's a question from Leah Leah I'm
[3762.48 - 3767.60] never buying nut Butters again Dan
[3764.34 - 3767.60] neither am I
[3769.74 - 3772.22] okay
[3772.26 - 3777.48] Robin Hansen says does it need to be
[3775.02 - 3779.04] refrigerated is it soft spread yes you
[3777.48 - 3781.92] can refrigerate it
[3779.04 - 3784.56] now when it's cold it doesn't spread so
[3781.92 - 3786.48] easy right when it's out of the
[3784.56 - 3789.98] refrigerator just leave it out overnight
[3786.48 - 3789.98] it'll spread much easier
[3791.22 - 3796.94] okay now that is Walnut butter pure

[3811.20 - 3815.04] into every single Nut Butter it's a
[3813.24 - 3817.08] major scam going on with the nut Butters
[3815.04 - 3819.54] out there and Seed Butters I don't care
[3817.08 - 3821.34] what company I'm just saying this is

[3957.54 - 3960.96] cooking show we have a lot going on

[3970.26 - 3974.64] am I'm honored greatly indeed and I am
[3973.14 - 3975.78] at your service the medical medium
[3974.64 - 3978.54] cooking show
[3975.78 - 3980.84] pretty cool someone asked love life
[3978.54 - 3983.22] design asked what machine is this the
[3980.84 - 3985.14] mm-1500 link is in the description link
[3983.22 - 3987.90] is in the profile the sale is only on

[3989.40 - 3996.18] don't miss out why you can and I promise
[3993.42 - 3998.22] you this you will save money whether you
[3996.18 - 4000.02] know it or not that means you'll be
[3998.22 - 4002.48] juicing and not even know and you're
[4000.02 - 4005.12] saving money because it saves you money
[4002.48 - 4006.92] instead of the other juicers don't I'm
[4005.12 - 4009.02] not trying to harp on the other juicers
[4006.92 - 4011.84] it's just that the other juicers and
[4009.02 - 4014.18] influencers with the other juicers are
[4011.84 - 4016.28] trying to basically get into the medical
[4014.18 - 4018.08] medium community and they're just trying
[4016.28 - 4019.28] to sell these other juicers and then
[4018.08 - 4021.44] everybody
[4019.28 - 4023.72] spends all this money
[4021.44 - 4026.06] on not only the juicer but all the
[4023.72 - 4029.18] produce and everything and it's going to
[4026.06 - 4031.88] be one costly Venture the idea is to
[4029.18 - 4033.32] save money and that's what these do I
[4031.88 - 4036.02] will repeat things for new people
[4033.32 - 4038.12] because I'm I'm trying to be
[4036.02 - 4039.80] patient and I want people to actually
[4038.12 - 4042.08] have that opportunity so new people
[4039.80 - 4044.60] coming here if you notice
[4042.08 - 4045.62] some people will say how come he repeats
[4044.60 - 4047.66] himself
[4045.62 - 4050.06] well I repeat myself because new people
[4047.66 - 4051.74] come in here and they don't know what's
[4050.06 - 4054.08] going on and they have questions and I
[4051.74 - 4055.16] want to be nice and answer them okay you
[4054.08 - 4058.84] guys
[4055.16 - 4058.84] let's make another nut butter
[4061.64 - 4064.36] It's Not Butter on the list
[4066.20 - 4068.56] no
[4069.40 - 4073.46] I got some almonds here they're roasty
[4071.84 - 4076.22] they're toasty they're ready to go we're
[4073.46 - 4077.42] making our third Nut Butter I'm excited
[4076.22 - 4080.54] about that
[4077.42 - 4082.52] before I click on the machine though
[4080.54 - 4085.40] um so yeah you guys
[4082.52 - 4088.16] Walnut Butter sounds lovely Ruth said
[4085.40 - 4090.02] incredible we're always live these are
[4088.16 - 4092.36] not pre-recorded and people come on
[4090.02 - 4095.90] asking questions and that's why I repeat
[4092.36 - 4098.78] myself and so then I'm guilty of the
[4095.90 - 4101.30] crime of repeating myself and then
[4098.78 - 4104.18] you'll hear in reviews and comments how
[4101.30 - 4108.14] he always repeats himself it's like dude
[4104.18 - 4109.46] 99 of my stuff is live and people are
[4108.14 - 4110.96] coming on and I'm just trying to be
[4109.46 - 4113.78] helpful
[4110.96 - 4116.12] I want to be helpful to new people
[4113.78 - 4117.62] and um and I know that some people are
[4116.12 - 4119.24] very disrespectful when they say he's
[4117.62 - 4120.74] repeating himself you shouldn't watch
[4119.24 - 4123.20] them it's like dude don't be
[4120.74 - 4125.18] disrespectful to people that are sick
[4123.20 - 4129.74] and that are chronically ill and they
[4125.18 - 4129.74] want help and questions answered right
[4135.02 - 4140.42] doing the best we can now almonds
[4137.60 - 4141.80] roasted almonds really tough so what
[4140.42 - 4143.42] you'll notice if you throw in a whole
[4141.80 - 4146.00] bunch at the same time
[4143.42 - 4147.56] you could get like a jam and what you do
[4146.00 - 4148.82] is you do the reverse on there and there
[4147.56 - 4150.80] you go
[4148.82 - 4153.68] I want to show you guys
[4150.80 - 4155.72] every time I do the almonds
[4153.68 - 4158.24] can you put too many at once so just
[4155.72 - 4162.70] give it a second here
[4158.24 - 4162.70] all right here we go
[4162.74 - 4165.58] hold on
[4167.30 - 4173.24] raw almonds will never do that but
[4170.84 - 4175.34] you're all set
[4173.24 - 4177.86] when you do almonds though in here right
[4175.34 - 4181.22] don't drop a whole ton down like I just
[4177.86 - 4185.24] did do it this way
[4181.22 - 4189.38] feed them in slower because roasted
[4185.24 - 4191.72] toasted almonds are so tough
[4189.38 - 4193.10] you have to actually you know work with
[4191.72 - 4194.54] it a little more finesse look at this I
[4193.10 - 4197.38] want to show you something guys
[4194.54 - 4197.38] this is just incredible
[4198.74 - 4204.88] now I love making roasted almond butter
[4202.22 - 4204.88] with this machine
[4207.32 - 4210.04] watch this
[4210.50 - 4214.34] this is pure almond butter coming out
[4212.66 - 4215.96] right here Cold Light spring I've
[4214.34 - 4218.48] noticed the people who always criticize
[4215.96 - 4219.86] They Don't Really follow mm correct they
[4218.48 - 4222.02] don't know the books they don't have the
[4219.86 - 4224.78] brain saver books or any books
[4222.02 - 4226.82] guys take a close-up on this I mean see
[4224.78 - 4229.40] a close-up on this you guys look what do
[4226.82 - 4231.98] you think that's straight roasted almond
[4229.40 - 4233.84] butter the pure stuff it's coming right
[4231.98 - 4236.68] through see if I can get a little bit of
[4233.84 - 4236.68] a focus on there
[4237.20 - 4243.32] there you go look at that incredible
[4241.22 - 4245.96] Wendy says your patience is incredible
[4243.32 - 4249.10] that's how we learn we need to hear it
[4245.96 - 4249.10] more times thank you aw
[4249.74 - 4252.28] you're welcome
[4254.36 - 4257.48] someone said what kind of cracker check
[4255.98 - 4260.00] out medicalmeem.com look at the
[4257.48 - 4264.20] directory and you can find like a
[4260.00 - 4266.60] cracker or anything else you need
[4264.20 - 4269.12] so what I'm doing here is
[4266.60 - 4271.54] you can see you've got to feed the
[4269.12 - 4274.16] almonds in slower when they're roasted
[4271.54 - 4277.58] almonds are really they become like rock
[4274.16 - 4278.90] hard you know how it goes with almonds
[4277.58 - 4280.34] and you just gotta feed them like this
[4278.90 - 4281.54] and take a look the almond butter is
[4280.34 - 4282.80] coming out
[4281.54 - 4285.64] look at that
[4282.80 - 4285.64] it's just amazing
[4287.84 - 4290.92] that's your almond butter
[4291.50 - 4294.50] I want to show you the difference
[4292.70 - 4298.42] between our almond butter that we're
[4294.50 - 4298.42] making right now and the almond butter
[4299.42 - 4303.70] you got to just drop these in like this
[4301.22 - 4303.70] take a look
[4305.30 - 4309.26] I love the purple lights
[4307.46 - 4311.86] got some purple lights in the back yeah
[4309.26 - 4311.86] I love them too
[4314.00 - 4317.60] Loop is free with celery three through
[4315.86 - 4319.28] three yes I saw an article a
[4317.60 - 4321.26] nutritionist wrote criticizing medical
[4319.28 - 4325.16] medium and she did not even read the
[4321.26 - 4327.68] books too bad she she deters others from
[4325.16 - 4329.90] reading them too yes she does
[4327.68 - 4332.12] this is how it works right
[4329.90 - 4334.16] this is how dark this works you know in
[4332.12 - 4336.26] the alternative field of medicine they
[4334.16 - 4338.06] write articles when they don't even know
[4336.26 - 4340.94] anything about celery juice or medical
[4338.06 - 4342.68] medium or the books in hopes that a
[4340.94 - 4346.22] thousand people will read the article
[4342.68 - 4348.02] and never do medical needing
[4346.22 - 4349.94] that's what they do
[4348.02 - 4352.82] and it happens everywhere and then an
[4349.94 - 4354.62] influencer will do it and then a news
[4352.82 - 4356.84] station will do it and then a media
[4354.62 - 4359.00] Source will do it and then
[4356.84 - 4361.00] another media Source will do it and
[4359.00 - 4363.68] they'll do it over and over again until
[4361.00 - 4367.18] people get turned off from even thinking
[4363.68 - 4367.18] about using medical medium right
[4367.28 - 4370.82] but
[4369.02 - 4374.12] what are you gonna do
[4370.82 - 4377.72] you just put out the best books ever in
[4374.12 - 4381.88] health and you pray that angels for some
[4377.72 - 4381.88] Divine source or God
[4382.22 - 4386.60] or a friend or anybody tell somebody
[4384.74 - 4388.28] about that opportunity
[4386.60 - 4391.40] Kim says hearing the crunch is
[4388.28 - 4395.20] satisfying haha yes it actually is so
[4391.40 - 4395.20] we're doing some almond butter

[4464.24 - 4470.00] but I've had one in my fridge for two
[4467.36 - 4471.74] years then I took it out and used it so
[4470.00 - 4473.78] I'm just saying like use your own
[4471.74 - 4475.22] discretion in the sense of like how long

[4486.44 - 4491.50] actually topping it off right there
[4489.02 - 4491.50] there you go
[4492.14 - 4494.80] all right
[4496.04 - 4501.40] what you see is some almond butter right
[4499.22 - 4501.40] there
[4503.72 - 4507.98] wait
[4505.88 - 4509.84] which one do you want
[4507.98 - 4513.56] do you want that one
[4509.84 - 4517.58] or do you want the store-bought one
[4513.56 - 4520.10] that adds the extra oil from almonds
[4517.58 - 4522.08] from a different place bulk
[4520.10 - 4525.20] you don't want an almond butter that has
[4522.08 - 4527.36] 50 different almond oils
[4525.20 - 4530.06] that were stored for God knows how long
[4527.36 - 4531.94] in factories and warehouses and were
[4530.06 - 4535.46] used to actually
[4531.94 - 4537.68] fulfill a need to lessen the other stuff
[4535.46 - 4540.32] I mean it goes rancid so what you're
[4537.68 - 4542.18] looking at is rancid oil that's added to
[4540.32 - 4544.70] all the nut Butters and Seed Butters out
[4542.18 - 4547.24] there so personally I would like real
[4544.70 - 4547.24] nut butter
[4547.70 - 4553.54] and I would rather have that instead of
[4549.98 - 4553.54] the rancid stuff that's added
[4554.26 - 4558.92] so I got my nut Butters here I have
[4556.64 - 4562.30] three nut Butters let's do a last little
[4558.92 - 4562.30] work on that before we move on
[4563.42 - 4566.02] foreign
[4569.24 - 4572.33] [Applause]
[4574.10 - 4577.10] got him right here
[4575.60 - 4578.30] all right so the next thing we're doing
[4577.10 - 4579.74] is
[4578.30 - 4583.60] you guys don't mind if I make a little
[4579.74 - 4583.60] celery juice I didn't have any yet today
[4585.64 - 4590.98] didn't have any celery juice yet today
[4588.32 - 4590.98] so
[4603.08 - 4607.88] so that's next let's make some celery
[4605.36 - 4611.00] juice I might even throw
[4607.88 - 4613.46] something else there and there
[4611.00 - 4615.92] okay
[4613.46 - 4617.74] this is a major project here I've got a
[4615.92 - 4620.48] lot going on
[4617.74 - 4621.98] Joel says what's up Anthony signed up
[4620.48 - 4626.18] for the late blast yesterday and I'm
[4621.98 - 4628.16] super excited yay incredible
[4626.18 - 4632.06] Courtney M.A says aw your skin is
[4628.16 - 4635.06] gorgeous thank you very much
[4632.06 - 4635.06] okay
[4636.44 - 4640.94] Cornelia says these nut Butters could be
[4638.66 - 4644.06] a nice Christmas gift yes indeed you can
[4640.94 - 4646.94] make them throw a lid on them
[4644.06 - 4650.36] and boom you have a nice Christmas gift
[4646.94 - 4651.98] mostly crunchy Wendy says I'm making my
[4650.36 - 4656.50] celery juice right now as well cheers
[4651.98 - 4656.50] okay are you beating me to it oh no no
[4656.54 - 4661.30] I think you're beating me to it come on
[4659.30 - 4665.78] you're making it right now
[4661.30 - 4669.04] no I have to hurry up
[4665.78 - 4669.04] let's make some celery juice
[4675.44 - 4678.16] I'm excited
[4678.50 - 4684.08] all right why have the mm-1500 make your
[4682.40 - 4687.14] celery juice
[4684.08 - 4690.14] because you're gonna use less celery
[4687.14 - 4693.14] this is a medicine maker this is an
[4690.14 - 4695.54] herbal it's extraction you're witnessing
[4693.14 - 4698.06] you're witnessing me making an herbal
[4695.54 - 4700.64] extraction
[4698.06 - 4703.22] what that means is
[4700.64 - 4705.88] celery is an herbal
[4703.22 - 4705.88] medicine
[4706.70 - 4712.22] when you eat it you do not get enough of
[4709.04 - 4715.22] it you need the juice separated
[4712.22 - 4717.38] that's the attraction
[4715.22 - 4720.26] you have to juice it in order to get
[4717.38 - 4723.02] enough of it the medicine out of it
[4720.26 - 4724.04] so when a registered dietitian which you
[4723.02 - 4725.36] know there's some good registered
[4724.04 - 4728.42] dietitians out there that do medical
[4725.36 - 4729.74] medium protocols but when a registered
[4728.42 - 4732.38] dietitian that doesn't know medical
[4729.74 - 4735.62] medium information or the books
[4732.38 - 4738.20] does a hit piece and a media Outlet
[4735.62 - 4740.12] allows them to do a hit piece without
[4738.20 - 4742.52] hearing my side
[4740.12 - 4745.94] or the or the stories of people who have
[4742.52 - 4747.98] feel your skin and their body and healed
[4745.94 - 4750.74] from excellent psoriasis and healed from
[4747.98 - 4753.14] lupus when they don't allow those people
[4750.74 - 4758.00] into the article
[4753.14 - 4761.66] thank you then they're doing evil
[4758.00 - 4765.64] they're doing evil bidding
[4761.66 - 4765.64] they are dark
[4766.10 - 4771.92] what a media Source in alternative
[4769.10 - 4775.10] medicine chooses not to call up medical
[4771.92 - 4777.20] medium and say look I'm gonna have some
[4775.10 - 4778.64] registered dietitians on there to rip
[4777.20 - 4780.38] apart
[4778.64 - 4782.96] celery
[4780.38 - 4785.30] would you like to at least
[4782.96 - 4787.58] have it equal where you can talk about
[4785.30 - 4789.44] what it has done you know anybody who
[4787.58 - 4792.74] has healed from celery juice
[4789.44 - 4794.48] they don't do that the alternative
[4792.74 - 4797.30] source
[4794.48 - 4799.16] that posts an article
[4797.30 - 4800.72] They Don't Care About The Chronic Leo
[4799.16 - 4803.24] but yet they act like they do because
[4800.72 - 4805.82] they're an alternative like website
[4803.24 - 4808.52] putting out articles right they act like
[4805.82 - 4810.50] they care about people they don't
[4808.52 - 4812.54] so they have a registered dietitian or a
[4810.50 - 4814.34] nutritionist on there saying how
[4812.54 - 4816.14] cellular juice is worthless and science
[4814.34 - 4817.88] and research has not found you know
[4816.14 - 4819.56] found anything
[4817.88 - 4820.88] science of research hasn't even studied
[4819.56 - 4824.56] celery juice
[4820.88 - 4824.56] the stupidity is so great
[4827.00 - 4831.86] loving healing says anyone that picks up
[4829.34 - 4834.02] your books knows deep down the info in
[4831.86 - 4835.10] them is truth I think haters are afraid
[4834.02 - 4836.60] to read them
[4835.10 - 4839.96] you know that's really true and another
[4836.60 - 4841.34] thing too haters don't read the books
[4839.96 - 4843.82] poachers
[4841.34 - 4843.82] feel at
[4844.94 - 4849.80] m in the health Realm
[4846.74 - 4852.92] but yeah the haters they
[4849.80 - 4854.78] and they don't cite it whatever I study
[4852.92 - 4859.64] nutrition medical medium gave me answers
[4854.78 - 4859.64] nutrition couldn't that's from fsog
[4866.90 - 4870.20] now I'm just making celery juice if you
[4868.76 - 4872.02] want to make a celery kale juice you
[4870.20 - 4874.46] could if you want to make a celery
[4872.02 - 4876.14] parsley juice you could can you make
[4874.46 - 4878.00] almond milk with the machine yes you can
[4876.14 - 4880.04] make nut milks in fact it's mind-blowing
[4878.00 - 4882.98] and now here's the funny thing I was
[4880.04 - 4884.30] going to make nut milk in this in this
[4882.98 - 4885.80] video this episode even though we're
[4884.30 - 4887.78] live right now all right
[4885.80 - 4889.40] but there's so much there's so many
[4887.78 - 4891.32] things I want to show you
[4889.40 - 4893.42] live is free with celery says someone
[4891.32 - 4895.46] contacted me to ask how I got a job
[4893.42 - 4898.70] promoting you I spread your info because
[4895.46 - 4902.00] it saved my life see that's
[4898.70 - 4903.74] that's how it works it's like
[4902.00 - 4905.84] there's so much Darkness out there you
[4903.74 - 4909.62] guys
[4905.84 - 4912.20] if you spent the day with me
[4909.62 - 4915.22] and saw what I saw
[4912.20 - 4915.22] you wouldn't believe it
[4916.34 - 4920.18] it's like there's a hit piece on me
[4918.44 - 4922.10] every other day
[4920.18 - 4923.18] there's hip thesis out there that I
[4922.10 - 4925.88] don't even see
[4923.18 - 4927.98] it's just unbelievable it's private hate
[4925.88 - 4930.74] groups you name it
[4927.98 - 4932.60] but I can tell you this
[4930.74 - 4934.46] um
[4932.60 - 4936.32] they're not used to people promoting
[4934.46 - 4938.12] something without getting paid
[4936.32 - 4940.84] that's why so they'll just say oh you
[4938.12 - 4940.84] must be getting paid
[4942.26 - 4947.00] so what they'll do is a media Source an
[4944.90 - 4949.34] alternative or conventional but an
[4947.00 - 4951.44] alternative media Source just really a
[4949.34 - 4955.16] rag of a source
[4951.44 - 4957.32] literally did an article on celery juice
[4955.16 - 4960.56] smeared my name in it
[4957.32 - 4962.00] and had some nutritionist or Rd on there
[4960.56 - 4964.34] saying how it's celery juice is
[4962.00 - 4966.92] worthless right when you think about how
[4964.34 - 4969.32] awful that is right and why does it
[4966.92 - 4971.18] bother me because someone's going to
[4969.32 - 4973.96] read that and never drink celery juice
[4971.18 - 4973.96] and never heal
[4974.66 - 4980.36] they're never gonna heal because
[4978.86 - 4983.50] they're not going to think they should
[4980.36 - 4983.50] drink celery juice ever
[4983.66 - 4987.50] so they're losing a healing tool right
[4985.76 - 4990.56] so that's what it comes down to they
[4987.50 - 4993.40] lose a healing tool so I'm going to grab
[4990.56 - 4993.40] a little glass here
[4996.28 - 5002.86] now what's really cool about the mm1500
[5001.24 - 5005.38] for so many things
[5002.86 - 5007.66] so I got some celery juice right here
[5005.38 - 5010.30] [Music]
[5007.66 - 5013.92] it's a lot of celery juice okay you can
[5010.30 - 5013.92] do a close-up on the celery juice too
[5014.68 - 5017.46] there you go
[5021.76 - 5025.72] and then the pulp right here now what
[5024.10 - 5028.24] the mm-1500 does
[5025.72 - 5029.86] is it actually gives you drier pulp than
[5028.24 - 5033.34] the other juicers and what that does is
[5029.86 - 5035.26] it gives you more celery juice so that's
[5033.34 - 5036.76] where you're saving money and that's an
[5035.26 - 5038.56] incredible part about it and that's what
[5036.76 - 5040.06] I love we got more to do you guys so I
[5038.56 - 5041.98] got to make some banana ice cream am I
[5040.06 - 5044.62] going to get that ready
[5041.98 - 5047.32] Michael Moeller says Susan Craig are
[5044.62 - 5049.42] really much impressed by your
[5047.32 - 5050.62] I don't know why they gotta fly up there
[5049.42 - 5053.26] like that but
[5050.62 - 5056.38] most all Health info and people in
[5053.26 - 5058.48] health have organizations and programs
[5056.38 - 5061.00] that people pay
[5058.48 - 5063.10] into right
[5061.00 - 5064.84] and then it to promote things and get
[5063.10 - 5066.88] paid and promotion all that or affiliate
[5064.84 - 5068.32] programs it's not because it really
[5066.88 - 5070.30] works and what medical medium
[5068.32 - 5072.04] information is it's like people who heal
[5070.30 - 5073.12] and they tell somebody else or they post
[5072.04 - 5074.92] about it
[5073.12 - 5078.58] and it's just so heartwarming because
[5074.92 - 5080.20] it's like I'm healing or I healed and I
[5078.58 - 5082.00] want to spread the message and they're
[5080.20 - 5083.04] not used to that out there
[5082.00 - 5085.18] out there because
[5083.04 - 5088.78] influencers and everybody they're being
[5085.18 - 5090.52] paid to actually say this this product
[5088.78 - 5092.50] is this or this thing does that or this
[5090.52 - 5095.62] thing does that and so no one's used to
[5092.50 - 5097.84] a community that's out there talking
[5095.62 - 5100.06] about how they healed
[5097.84 - 5102.28] and they weren't paid to do it like that
[5100.06 - 5104.20] doesn't exist it's Grassroots the
[5102.28 - 5106.08] medical mean communities like Grassroots
[5104.20 - 5108.52] community
[5106.08 - 5110.26] that cares about people getting answers
[5108.52 - 5112.56] and stuff
[5110.26 - 5112.56] foreign
[5116.68 - 5120.40] all right
[5119.14 - 5123.96] see you guys
[5120.40 - 5123.96] it's time to make some banana ice cream
[5124.00 - 5127.02] so let's do it
[5130.36 - 5133.98] so I got some frozen bananas here
[5141.60 - 5148.24] now I love making banana ice cream I'm
[5145.90 - 5151.24] just gonna be honest okay it's one of my
[5148.24 - 5153.54] favorite things to make
[5151.24 - 5153.54] foreign
[5166.86 - 5171.94] bananas here
[5168.82 - 5173.68] we're ready to make it
[5171.94 - 5176.26] now what you want to do if you get your
[5173.68 - 5178.66] frozen bananas out of the freezer if
[5176.26 - 5180.28] they're too Frozen you might want to let
[5178.66 - 5181.42] them kind of like sit for a couple of
[5180.28 - 5183.46] minutes
[5181.42 - 5185.56] that's usually like
[5183.46 - 5187.18] you know a good option depending on how
[5185.56 - 5190.38] Frozen these are these are pretty darn
[5187.18 - 5190.38] Frozen Let's just give it a run
[5194.43 - 5197.50] [Music]
[5201.34 - 5205.14] I love banana ice cream personally
[5205.78 - 5211.36] it's one of my favorites I know it's a
[5208.18 - 5213.52] crack pleaser for not just holidays or
[5211.36 - 5214.60] anything but it's just a crowd pleaser
[5213.52 - 5216.34] in general
[5214.60 - 5218.62] who doesn't love banana ice cream who
[5216.34 - 5221.14] doesn't love ice cream
[5218.62 - 5223.42] but
[5221.14 - 5226.12] to think that the MN 1500 can make
[5223.42 - 5228.66] banana ice creams it's like okay what
[5226.12 - 5228.66] else can it do
[5237.06 - 5242.80] good like is this insane
[5240.52 - 5244.78] have I lost my mind
[5242.80 - 5248.02] please somebody tell me
[5244.78 - 5250.26] do I need a psychiatrist
[5248.02 - 5250.26] foreign
[5254.14 - 5258.46] yeah I like to make my banana ice cream
[5256.42 - 5260.74] tell me

[5265.24 - 5270.34] I like to make banana ice cream
[5268.24 - 5273.60] I can make it all day
[5270.34 - 5273.60] is there something wrong with that
[5276.34 - 5279.04] I'm gonna make it in a smaller one right
[5278.20 - 5281.88] now
[5279.04 - 5281.88] here we go
[5282.10 - 5285.18] where's my small
[5286.48 - 5290.51] okay
[5287.74 - 5293.32] that's just perfect
[5290.51 - 5296.14] [Music]
[5293.32 - 5297.52] so I'm making a smaller one now I just
[5296.14 - 5299.56] froze these
[5297.52 - 5301.86] so they may not have been like perfectly
[5299.56 - 5301.86] Frozen
[5301.96 - 5305.58] but they
[5303.16 - 5305.58] have much
[5309.76 - 5315.52] these were pretty ripe too whatever
[5312.78 - 5318.70] Lana says we've eaten many banana ice
[5315.52 - 5321.66] creams made by the m1500 it's absolutely
[5318.70 - 5325.08] Divine yeah I love it
[5321.66 - 5325.08] that's so great
[5332.14 - 5335.50] all right you guys something's out of
[5333.64 - 5337.30] control here this machine's sending it
[5335.50 - 5340.72] all out I got to get it back on here oh
[5337.30 - 5340.72] wow okay
[5341.92 - 5347.80] lots of ice cream coming out
[5345.22 - 5350.98] okay there we go now understand that
[5347.80 - 5353.52] this actually these are Frozen but not
[5350.98 - 5356.98] solid frozen like

[5585.46 - 5589.78] hmm
[5587.08 - 5592.02] what I love to do is to take a piece of
[5589.78 - 5592.02] kale
[5592.90 - 5596.58] I can't believe I forgot this
[5597.22 - 5603.42] I like to take a piece of kale here
[5598.96 - 5603.42] right and I like to put some hummus
[5604.78 - 5609.70] in the kale leaf because it's about
[5607.90 - 5611.50] getting those leafy greens that's what
[5609.70 - 5613.84] you have to think it's always about
[5611.50 - 5615.42] getting the leafy greens right
[5613.84 - 5618.52] so if you're going to make your hummus
[5615.42 - 5621.40] make sure you make your little hummus
[5618.52 - 5623.26] boat and you use your kale or your you
[5621.40 - 5626.76] know a mustard green or something and
[5623.26 - 5626.76] that's really important to do oh
[5628.18 - 5631.30] watch this so
[5629.86 - 5634.32] these are mustard greens right here
[5631.30 - 5634.32] they're really spicy
[5634.74 - 5639.22] set some mustard green I'm going to take
[5637.06 - 5641.68] two of these mustard greens like that
[5639.22 - 5645.54] put them together
[5641.68 - 5645.54] and then you can put a hummus
[5645.94 - 5650.64] put this spicy black bean one right in
[5648.04 - 5650.64] the mustard green
[5651.28 - 5656.28] you can also take I got some arugula in
[5654.10 - 5656.28] here
[5657.64 - 5660.88] so I got some arugula in here too and
[5659.32 - 5662.38] this is how you can do the leafy greens
[5660.88 - 5663.82] with your hummus you're adding in your
[5662.38 - 5664.78] arugula and you're having your mustard
[5663.82 - 5666.52] greens
[5664.78 - 5669.34] by the way this is amazing with the
[5666.52 - 5671.44] holidays party these are party Pleasers
[5669.34 - 5673.72] all of this
[5671.44 - 5675.70] for family ready and then you got your
[5673.72 - 5676.60] here's the leafy green way to do things
[5675.70 - 5677.98] right
[5676.60 - 5678.94] and that's what I've always done if I
[5677.98 - 5682.06] was going to have hummus or anything
[5678.94 - 5683.98] like that it's not about a chip
[5682.06 - 5685.66] in hummus
[5683.98 - 5687.82] it's about how do you get your leafy
[5685.66 - 5690.00] greens in you with almost everything you
[5687.82 - 5690.00] do
[5691.84 - 5694.84] it
[5696.88 - 5701.22] that's the way to do it right there hold
[5699.04 - 5701.22] on

[6132.24 - 6137.34] exercise very vigorously 10 hours a week
[6134.76 - 6139.26] whoa now on medical medium protocols
[6137.34 - 6141.48] it's less than two hours per week yet
[6139.26 - 6143.76] I'm more lean more defined and more
[6141.48 - 6145.98] stronger because that's what happens
[6143.76 - 6147.78] medical medium information makes it and
[6145.98 - 6150.00] protocols makes it so you can actually
[6147.78 - 6152.64] become a stronger healthier person and
[6150.00 - 6154.44] if you wanted to exercise less you're
[6152.64 - 6156.30] welcome to do so and you'll still be
[6154.44 - 6158.70] healthier than you were before medical
[6156.30 - 6161.70] medium when you're exercising more
[6158.70 - 6163.86] that's how it works
[6161.70 - 6167.28] in a nutshell maybe I'll do a podcast
[6163.86 - 6170.04] all about that you guys I love you and
[6167.28 - 6172.74] I'm gonna have like a total feast and
[6170.04 - 6174.42] pig out is what I'm gonna do
[6172.74 - 6177.78] um and I got some people coming over
[6174.42 - 6181.86] some family so hopefully uh everybody
[6177.78 - 6184.88] likes all the good stuff love you guys
