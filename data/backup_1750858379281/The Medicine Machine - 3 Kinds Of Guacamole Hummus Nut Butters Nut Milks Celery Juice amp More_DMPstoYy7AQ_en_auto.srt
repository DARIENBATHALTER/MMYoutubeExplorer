nerve acid gut stabilizer okay making

38
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,619
guacamole is this what we're gonna be

39
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:40,700
doing let's get on to it so right here

40
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:45,659
you guys this is the mm-1500 100 off 100

41
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:47,340
off on the machine right now this is an

42
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:49,740
incredible machine it is the medicine

43
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,320
maker I call that the reason why is

44
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,540
because it extracts to such a degree and

45
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,100
what happens with other juicers like the

46
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,479
basket juicers that everybody gets

47
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,520
suckered into because they think it's

48
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:02,520
easy or something to use what happens

49
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,200
with like the basket juicers is it's

50
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,479
deficient juice so you're drinking

51
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,880
deficient juice so you think you're

52
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,920
getting juice in you that's providing

53
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,440
something for you but it creates a

54
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:16,140
deficiency over time because it's not

55
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,720
extracting enough of the nutrients the

56
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:21,000
mm 1500

57
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:24,599
extracts such a large quantity of

58
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,120
critical nutrients literally leaves dust

59
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:28,379
behind to that degree almost and you

60
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,780
guys know I work with the mega and

61
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:31,800
everything this is the mm 1500 so I

62
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,080
can't wait to show you I'm going to make

63
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,640

64
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,420

00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:59,580
Butters buying nut Butters is so abusive

187
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:02,819
The Nut Butter business is so abusive on

188
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:04,979
the customer yes you don't know it but

189
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:06,660
you're being abused when you go and buy

190
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:09,360
that nut butter and I'm gonna talk about

191
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:11,639
how it sounds like crazy but it's not

192
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,139
wait till I describe how it works what

193
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:15,000
goes on with nut Butters in the whole

194
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:17,599
bit so I'm really looking forward to

195
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,599
showing you guys

196
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:22,620
you know the thing is the transparency

197
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:24,680
is not out there every food we eat every

198
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:27,180
pack of food every bottle of food

199
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,860
transparency is not out there all kinds

200
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,780
of different things it's just not there

201
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:32,580
so it's important that people know

202
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:34,260
what's going on

203
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:36,959
now what you're seeing right here is

204
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:40,320
high compression this mm-1500 you guys

205
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:43,080
know if you have a 1500 or a 900 what

206
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,420
you see right here is really dry pulp

207
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,580
because of the compression someone might

208
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:49,860
say oh well look it's not going all the

209
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:52,080
way through oh yeah well there's a

210
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,640
reason why it's held back a little bit

211
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,440
because you're looking at high

212
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,760
compression you're looking if you can

213
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,080
see here with this camera right there

214
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,959
you see how that camera's on there you

215
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:04,080
guys right now how sick is that this

216
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:09,600
isn't wet and sloppy pulp this isn't

217
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:12,300
just wet drippy sloppy pulp this is dry

218
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,519
way drier than anything out there those

219
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,620
basket juicers it's a rip a total

220
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:18,600
rip-off it doesn't get the nutrients out

221
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,640
it doesn't squeeze the juice out you got

222
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,200
to be extremely wealthy just to throw

223
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,180
your stuff in there and let the basket

224
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,580
thing spin around and you're gonna be

225
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:29,220
wealthy because you have to buy so much

226
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,899
more produce to make a juice now but if

227
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,519
you're somebody with chronic illness and

228
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:34,680
you need to heal and you need to recover

229
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:36,360
and get your life back it's important

230
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,279
that you have something that's not only

231
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:42,779
extracting the nutrients that you need

232
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:45,839
to heal but you need okay you need juice

233
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:47,700
that's free and clear from any kind of

234
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,860
other contaminants you don't know that

235
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:52,680
are in the basket juicers it's a whole

236
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:55,140
nother thing all on its own and then the

237
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,880
cost for buying loads of produce and

238
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:59,339
getting very little juice out of it

239
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,380
putting way more into the basket and

240
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:03,420
getting very little juice that's not the

241
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:04,980
way to go so anyway already I got some

242
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:06,959
juice right there

243
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:09,540
so

244
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:11,279
I'm going to shut this down

245
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,779
I got a nice little screen here you want

246
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,160
to strain your celery juice the reason

247
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,839
why you don't want to pull you want

248
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,240
don't want pulp in there you don't want

249
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,700
too much grit in there the grit and the

250
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,760
pulp slows down the digestive process

251
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:25,680
you want this stuff going Lightning Fast

252
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,200
into your bloodstream Lightning Fast

253
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,060
into your body so it gets to your bones

254
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,920
it gets to your brain the electrolytes

255
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:33,660
get to the brain that's what you need do

256
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,120
you want your neurons firing and you

257
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:37,860
want them devouring all those minerals

258
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,180
and Trace mineral salts and all the

259
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:41,100
different nutrients that are in the

260
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:43,320
celery juice you want your brain your

261
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:46,200
brain stem and your neurons to suck it

262
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:48,180
up and devour it and bring it in and

263
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:51,740
tune up with it that's what you want

264
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,740
it's critical so all right

265
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:57,300
nice nice nice first of all I want to

266
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:58,440
show you one thing okay I want to show

267
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,240

270
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,680
hummus and making celery juice right now

271
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,880
I'm gonna make three nut Butters I'm

272
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,320
gonna show you what's going on in The

273
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,839

not wet and sloppy it's not and this is

276
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:18,899
very fibrous celery right here really

277
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:21,779
fibrous when if you're gonna go and

278
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:24,420
spend money on celery okay and it might

279
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:26,940
not be the juiciest batch this is not a

280
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:28,800
juicy batch of celery I remember when I

281
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:31,740
bought this right here and I looked at

282
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:34,500
it I was like your spindly you're skinny

283
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:36,959
and spindly and small the stalks there's

284
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,459
not a lot of juice in here probably been

285
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,959
you know sitting in a warehouse for a

286
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:43,440
little while before it got into the

287
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:45,480
store and even with all that I squeeze

288
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,700
the hell out of what I put through there

289
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,560
because of this machine the mm-1500

290
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,899
right I'm going to show you the pulp the

291
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:53,820
pulp isn't wet and sloppy so if I take

292
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:56,100
this pulp out of here there's nothing

293
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:57,779
wet in this right here so let me just do

294
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:00,540

295
00:11:57,779 --> 00:12:03,240
you're not seeing all this wet and you

296
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:04,920

297
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,959
to know all on its own so I'm putting

298
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:09,000
the pole back in there right now

299
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:11,700

00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,420
all right and let me just pour this

301
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:18,240
juice into a

302
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:22,399

00:13:09,019 --> 00:13:17,220
we got the pulp which is dry 1500 mm

323
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:19,260
1500 hundred dollars off on this machine

324
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:21,240
right now it's the mm 1500 Link in the

325
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:22,440
profile Link in the description wait do

326
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,639

and all of that and you guys know I work

332
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:38,399
with the mega because these machines are

333
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:39,959
amazing this machine is I don't know but

334
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,540
the other ones I'm saying this is the

335
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:45,360
1500 that has the high compression that

336
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:47,940
squeezes the nutrients out that's what

337
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,040
I'm talking about right there pumped all

338
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:53,160
right I'm gonna make a parsley shot

stabilizer you feel your food is not

367
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:03,060
digesting and you want to change that

368
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,399
over time and build it up if you feel

369
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:08,040
like your food's not breaking down

370
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:09,959
nerve gut acid stabilizer

371
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:12,660
if you feel you have poor nutrient

372
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:15,000
absorption if you've been told you have

373
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:16,980
a microbiome or gut microflora condition

374
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,880
or problem which everybody gets told

375
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,920
that

376
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,240
they really don't know how to get people

377
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,500
better they don't know why they're

378
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,540
really sick but everybody's in the

379
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:27,180
microbiome microbiome take this take

380
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:30,300
that and this this this this 10 doctors

381
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:32,579
later 30 vials of blood here 10 vials of

382
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:34,440
blood here it's just so sad what's going

383
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:37,019
on out there you've been told you have a

384
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:38,820
microbiome biome problem right you still

385
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:41,160
don't know what's wrong with you you

386
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:43,500
feel as if you're toxic or your blood is

387
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:45,180
toxic that's what I love about this

388
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:48,779
nerve gut acid stabilizer we're going to

389
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:52,139
make it helps with the blood toxicity

390
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:53,940
which is a big deal talking really fast

391
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:56,880
here because I know I have so much to do

392
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:58,440
you feel that your liver and lymph are

393
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,720
toxic

394
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:03,180
stagnant and sluggish

395
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,920
you're feeling an acidy stomach acidity

396
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:06,660
Sensations in your throat or mouth or

397
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:09,959
acidity feelings throughout your body

398
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:11,519
your body odor is more noticeable than

399
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:13,920
usual

400
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,720
you're dealing with chronic nausea or

401
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,579
chronic bloating how many people are

402
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,260
dealing with chronic nausea or chronic

403
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:21,600
bloating out there I know a lot of

404
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:23,699
people are dealing with that it's awful

405
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,680
sometimes their bloating is so bad

406
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:27,899
they're out to here and they're just

407
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,240
bloated it's just oh God it's tough

408
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:33,779
you're trying to repair an acidic body

409
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:36,180
system and you make your body more

410
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:37,380
alkaline through the gut stabilizer so I

411
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:39,420
just wanted to read a little bit about

412
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:41,699
this next thing I'm making the nerve gut

413
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:44,339
acid stabilizer okay from the medical

414
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:45,480
medium brain shot therapy in protocols

415
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:47,160
right there

416
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:50,519
let's get into it

417
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:54,380
so I'm going to run some parsley in here

418
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:54,380
and I'm gonna get this ready right now

419
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:04,339
together

420
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,339
okay

421
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:09,000
there's a dedicated support line at

422
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,860
Omega so when you go there it's a

423
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,740
medical medium support line just so you

424
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:15,240
know for the mm 1500 900 you'll find the

425
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,679
information on this machine in the

426
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,079
description link is in description link

427
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:20,939
is in the profile

428
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:23,040
cmm1500 people

429
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:26,220
don't juice

430
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:29,940
like the medical medium Community juices

431
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:32,280
people don't put wear and tear on their

432
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:34,140
Machinery on their juicers like the

433
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:37,860
medical medium Community does

434
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:41,160
there is no community in the world that

435
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:42,720
runs stuff through juicers day in and

436
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,520
day out like the medical medium

437
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,020
Community there are people in this

438
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:48,900
community that are running brain shots

439
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:50,820
right here every single day two three

440
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:52,460
brain shots a day they're running two

441
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:56,520
celery juices a day

442
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:58,799
every single day they're doing this the

443
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:02,160
other juicers out there will never stand

444
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:05,160
up for that ever the basket juicers will

445
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:07,320
never stand up everything gets dull and

446
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:10,620
it falls apart it can't handle that

447
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:13,440
intensity it's not possible that's why

448
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:15,059
the mm-1500 is here it's here to handle

449
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,520
that and people don't realize that they

450
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:19,440
don't know how much juicing how much

451
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,840
dedication towards bringing back health

452
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,940
because the medical meaning Community is

453
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:27,299
a community of people that that were

454
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:29,100
really really sick bedridden big

455
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:31,740
difference between being not so sick

456
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:33,960
versus really sick with chronic illness

457
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:35,580
and chronic mystery illness not just a

458
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,500
little stuff here and a little stuff

459
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:38,880
there which is fine too because that's

460
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,820
that's hard on people and I understand

461
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:44,520
I'm not demeaning or undermining or

462
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:46,080
belittling that on any level but the

463
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:48,360
majority of the people in the medical

464
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:51,660
Maine Community Came From Hell

465
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:55,620
and back they were deep in the woods

466
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:58,200
deep in the dark woods with no sunshine

467
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:59,580
and they fought their way out and they

468
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,320
crawled and they fought and they

469
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:04,080
scratched their way out and they got to

470
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:06,720
the woods line and they entered into the

471
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:09,539
sunlight in the field because they found

472
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,460
answers and tools like such that we're

473
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:13,380
talking about right here like the right

474
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:15,600
juicers and the rights of doing celery

475
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:17,160
juice every single day and doing the

476
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,660
brain shots and so forth and so much

477
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,419
it's all right

478
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:23,700
I'm just gonna knock out that pulp right

479
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:28,280
there so I want to run some celery get

480
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:28,280
the nerve got acid stabilizer going

481
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,640
all right

482
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:37,940
probably gonna be a little bit of

483
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,940
celery still going in here too

484
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:44,760
parsley is really really tough

485
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:48,059
you need a powerful juicer that doesn't

486
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:51,299
destroy the nutrients but still juices

487
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:53,400
The Parsley okay sometimes you might get

488
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:55,440
a log Jam in here

489
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:58,679
when you're dealing with this much

490
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:01,559
fibrous material like the stems but the

491
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:04,140
stems of the parsley hold

492
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:07,220
these incredible minerals that help

493
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:07,220
bring people back

494
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,559
someone's someone asks me family friend

495
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:16,860
or somebody gets a hold of me and

496
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:19,380
they're like a w what do I do about this

497
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:22,200
or that and I'm like are you doing the

498
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:26,120
parsley shot are you doing the nerve gut

499
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,120
acid acid stabilizer

500
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:32,700
so right now

501
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:34,140
what I like to do is I like to do a

502
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,179
couple of different different shot

503
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:39,740
meaning like I like to do this once

504
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:39,740
twice three times a day

505
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:45,600
[Applause]

506
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:48,240
I'm running parsley through here

507
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:54,260
parsley is not easy to juice and this is

508
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:54,260
totally crushing it it is crushing it

509
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:00,360
and here's what's amazing the parsley's

510
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:03,179
coming out dry which means you're

511
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:04,559
squeezing out all the nutrients

512
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:06,000
what you'll hear out there is people

513
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,559
saying oh you want to just blend

514
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,020
everything you never want to juice

515
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:12,960
because you you um you lose all the

516
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:16,020
fiber and all that stuff but not when

517
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:19,080
you're sick and you need an infusion

518
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:21,000
you need a main line when you're sick

519
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,500
you need a main line of direct nutrients

520
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,480
and when you're using something like the

521
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:27,179
mm-1500 you're getting that many

522
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:30,620
nutrients out of it

523
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:34,760
you're getting a main line

524
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:34,760
directly into your system

525
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:41,940
all right so

526
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:43,980
foreign

527
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:45,840
probably one of my favorite things to do

528
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:48,000
is make the parsley shot which is the

529
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:51,380
nerve gut acid stabilizer I like the

530
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,380
nickname you know the parsley shot

531
00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:55,799
just putting a little bit more in there

532
00:21:53,640 --> 00:22:00,919
parsley gets thick

533
00:21:55,799 --> 00:22:00,919
really thick in the container

534
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,260
now I'm not straining this one I want

535
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:10,820
this one real thick you can strain it

536
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:10,820
you can use the strainer which is fine

537
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:15,380
I'm gonna put a little bit more

538
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:20,640
you guys if you just got on here I'm

539
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:23,100
going to be making three different kinds

540
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,200
of guacamole on medicine guacamole I'm

541
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:27,360
gonna make a spicy hot guacamole I'm

542
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,980
gonna make regular standard

543
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:32,480
guacamole

544
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:32,480
a basic guacamole

545
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:41,059
all right

546
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:41,059
I got that to go through

547
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:46,799
why am I so excited today

548
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:48,419
all right

549
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,940
okay

550
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:54,179
one of the reasons why I'm so excited

551
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:58,559
this is practically dust

552
00:22:54,179 --> 00:23:03,360
this is ripped to shreds

553
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:06,539
This is Dusty dry you can see the like

554
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:08,340
it literally as if it was a dried herb

555
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:10,440
did you ever play with dried herbs and

556
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:12,480
you see all like the dust and the powder

557
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:14,400
that's just coming off of the dried herb

558
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,860
have you ever seen that do you guys see

559
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,380
what I'm talking about good luck with

560
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:21,539
any other juicer ever seeing that you

561
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:24,980
will never see that in any other juicer

562
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:30,360
it's literally air drying as we speak

563
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:33,419
The Parsley fibers this has been ripped

564
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:37,500
to shreds but masticated crushed

565
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:40,440
carefully not overheated

566
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:41,640
this is unbelievable the nutrients that

567
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,500
just came out of there these are the

568
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,299
things that make or break

569
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:47,159
these are the things that make or break

570
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:49,860
you know I hear people out there say hey

571
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:51,360
I did mm I did it didn't get me better

572
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:53,640
and when you look and you see they did

573
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:56,580
all this cacao they ate every other day

574
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:58,440
they were doing too many fats they were

575
00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:00,720
having too many cheat days which I

576
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,580
understand I'm not judging anybody they

577
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,039
weren't on any real protocols from the

578
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:06,720
medical medium information and then they

579
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,280
weren't juicing that much and they were

580
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,780
using maybe the wrong thing like a

581
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,460
spinning basket juicer and they got

582
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:13,380
ripped off and they didn't know it's not

583
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:14,220
anybody's fault it just happens out

584
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:16,260
there

585
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:18,419
and they don't realize would you do

586
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:20,580
something where you make the nerve gut

587
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:23,100
acid stabilizer where literally The

588
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:25,200
Parsley turns to practically dust dry

589
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:26,640
when you see you see that

590
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,419
do you realize what you're getting in

591
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,480
you

592
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:34,620
it's profound it's a whole nother game

593
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:36,840
whole nother situation for healing whoa

594
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:38,460
Okay so

595
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:41,419
I'm gonna get a little spoon in here

596
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:41,419
just mix it up

597
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:49,320
okay let's pour it in a shot glass

598
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,760
if you guys just got here we're making a

599
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,380
lot of things but this is an important

600
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:54,140
one right here let's go maybe we can get

601
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:56,520
a close-up on that one too

602
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:59,460
never know there it is you guys you got

603
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:00,720
the close-up right there boom check it

604
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:02,640
out

605
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:07,159
that is

606
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,159
the medicine right there

607
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:18,659
it packs a punch it has a bite

608
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:20,880
it's all medicine

609
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:26,480
it's smooth

610
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:26,480
silky but strong but powerful

611
00:25:26,779 --> 00:25:30,140
send it down

612
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:36,360
sounds good nice

613
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:37,620
feels good

614
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,480
all right

615
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,799
okay

616
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:43,700
you guys have to understand something

617
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,700
very important

618
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:50,039
the fiber in a plant

619
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:52,200
we just poop out

620
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:54,059
that's what we do

621
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,400
now fiber is important inside our diet

622
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:58,140
but we get plenty of fiber plenty of it

623
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,700
you can eat an apple and get plenty of

624
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:01,440
fiber

625
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:03,360
you can eat some leafy greens to get

626
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,299
plenty of fiber but we're talking about

627
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:08,279
creating medicine the fiber we don't

628
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:10,919
need when we're trying to actually heal

629
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:13,860
ourselves of ailments

630
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:16,020
gut spasms gut problems Crohn's colitis

631
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:17,580
IBS

632
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:20,580
celiac

633
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:22,860
chronic fatigue syndrome fibro right

634
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:24,419
rheumatoid ra

635
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:25,860
all the different conditions that

636
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:27,779
everybody is dealing with every single

637
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:30,419
day

638
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:32,340
dizziness blurry eyes mysterious

639
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:35,039
problems ringing in the ears

640
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:37,559
vertigo tinnitus

641
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:38,940
whatever it is we need medicine it's so

642
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:40,799
important

643
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:44,039
but people will say well what about the

644
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:48,600
fiberate there the plant stem the fiber

645
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:52,640
is there to get the plant in the air

646
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:52,640
so that the sun can hit it

647
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:59,820
so the fiber is to erect the plant

648
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,140
so it's straight up and it finds its way

649
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:03,720
to the Sun

650
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:06,779
and in this case you don't need

651
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:09,600
all of the fiber you need the medicine

652
00:27:06,779 --> 00:27:11,700
that's within the herb

653
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,159
in this situation right here this

654
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:16,200
machine

655
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:19,740
completely annihilated

656
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:22,380
that parsley in a good way in a profound

657
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:24,240
way it took out nutrients a nutrient

658
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:26,460
spectrum that you would never get eating

659
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:29,220
parsley and you would never get juicing

660
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:33,720
with other juicers it created a nutrient

661
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:36,059
profile for you to move the needle

662
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,919
all right

663
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:39,840
let's get going let's make some nut milk

664
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:41,940
that's the next thing I'm gonna make

665
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,580
some almond nut milk if you guys are

666
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:46,200
okay with that

667
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:48,260
just gonna move some stuff out of the

668
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:51,620
way

669
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:51,620
there we go

670
00:27:54,500 --> 00:28:00,000
all right

671
00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:03,440
mm 1500 is going to be at work making a

672

673
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:10,400
what I'm doing is I'm going to put a

674
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,400
screen on here

675
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:16,919
that

676
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:20,179
okay and I have some soaked almonds

677
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:20,179
right here

678
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,640
okay

679
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:32,039

all right

682
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,539
let's go

683
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:45,559
I soak these almonds

684
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:51,900
you might be somebody that's not into

685
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:56,220
making your own nut milk if that's

686
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:58,860
if that's what your jam is not doing

687
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:01,380
totally fine

688
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:03,179
but you can make your own nutmo

689
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:06,480
if you guys hang out I'm gonna make

690
00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:09,240
three different nut Butters

691
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:12,240
a hummus and three different guacamoles

692
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:14,520
with the mm-1500

693
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:18,659
this is the biggest sale on this machine

694
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:21,059
ever so far it's a hundred dollars off

695
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:24,240
the price is unbelievable for what it

696
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:27,720
can do for you and what what

697
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:31,820
it has to offer

698
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:31,820
the price can't be beat

699
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:40,380
so I'm making some pure nut milk

700
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:42,000
wait a minute here you know what I

701
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:43,679
forgot

702
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,980
ah

703
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:49,740
I forgot the natural flavors and the MSG

704
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:53,880
and the carrageenan I forgot to put that

705
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:57,179
in here ah bummer I forgot to put all

706
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:58,860
the poison into the almond milk you know

707
00:29:57,179 --> 00:30:00,240
the kind that's in the bottles of almond

708
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:02,159
milk out there the kind that's in the

709
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,320
cartons all the poison in there the

710
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:06,179
undisclosed hidden ingredients you don't

711
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:09,539
even know about plus the natural flavors

712
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:12,480
which is MSG and toxic stuff plus the

713
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:14,820
carrageenan plus other garbage crap I

714
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:18,179
forgot to add that in here

715
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:20,520
darn it this is too pure what was I

716
00:30:18,179 --> 00:30:22,980
thinking

717
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:26,419
what was I thinking

718
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:26,419
someone tell me please

719
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:32,880
I forgot to put the poisonous crap in

720
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:35,700
here

721
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:38,480
and everybody's drinking and eating

722
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,480
every day

723
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:45,720
so what I love about this machine is

724
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:48,779
because it has an ability to pulverize

725
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:51,299
to such a degree it's going to extract

726
00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:53,760
nutrients out of those almonds that you

727
00:30:51,299 --> 00:30:56,039
wouldn't get from the traditional

728
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:58,020
store-bought almond milk you get out

729
00:30:56,039 --> 00:31:00,179
there every day you go and you go in

730
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:02,159
there I'm gonna get some almond milk let

731
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:05,539
me go get get another bottle of

732
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:05,539
poisonous toxic almond milk

733
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:11,960
my body deserves only the best

734
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:18,380
let me grab a cup of coffee and a

735
00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:18,380
chocolate bar on the way out

736
00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:29,360
all right the rest of that in there

737
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:33,260

00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:39,360

I'm gonna tell you right now

772
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:11,279
if you get this machine and you make

773
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:14,159
this almond milk and then you take a

774
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:16,380
store-bought almond milk and you do a

775
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:18,600
taste test difference you do this one

776
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:20,820

I don't want to but I have to deliver

801
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:29,540
important critical news

00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:29,540
to you

803
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:36,999

I'm even gonna do a close-up down here

808
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:50,540
I'm going to put this one down here

809
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,540
okay

810
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:54,320
this was never opened

811
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:58,220
the plastic is still on the top

812
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:02,520
the plastic

813
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:03,540
is still on the top I need you to know

814
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:08,640
this

815
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:11,700
you guys this is worth every single iota

816
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:15,599
of your brain cells

817
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:16,980
this is worth every single moment of my

818
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:19,020
brain cells

819
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:20,640
our brain cells are working together in

820
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:23,700
unison right now

821
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:25,619
your brain cells and my brain cells are

822
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:27,119
Computing what you're seeing I'm

823
00:35:25,619 --> 00:35:31,760
computing

824
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:31,760
my brain cells let's get into it

825
00:35:34,619 --> 00:35:37,440
see that peanut butter

826
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:41,119
that oil

827
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,119
is not from those peanuts

828
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:45,060
see that almond butter

829
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:48,619
that oil

830
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:48,619
is not from those almonds

831
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:57,020
you can't see this as it isn't clear but

832
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:57,020
it's an unopened Tahiti

833
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:03,680
and the oil on top of that unopened

834
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,680
tahini is not from those seeds

835
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:11,700
it's not

836
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:14,280
from those seeds

837
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:15,680
I hate to give you the hard

838
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:19,079
true

839
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:21,660
but it's not

840
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:23,400
this is one of the best lessons you guys

841
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:25,800
can have

842
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,720
because the oils that are placed in all

843
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:31,320
the nut Butters

844
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:33,240
to save the nut butter company's money

845
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:36,780
declines your health

846
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:38,400
it declines your health and wellness and

847
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:43,040
well-being

848
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:43,040
this is a tahini right here

849
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:52,099
better yet let me get a shot glass out

850
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:58,400
you think the oil in all your tahinis

851
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,400
all your tahinis

852
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,339
take a look

853
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:12,180
that is straight oil and that's not from

854
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:15,240
your sesame seeds

855
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:16,619
this is part of why people can't heal

856
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,240
they think they're doing something good

857
00:37:16,619 --> 00:37:20,400
for themselves

858
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,560
but they don't heal this is why vegans

859
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,300
don't heal and they go back to eating

860
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:27,060
eggs

861
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:28,380
this is why vegetarians and people who

862
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:31,140
are really mindful about their health

863
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:32,700
this is part of why they don't heal it's

864
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:33,599
simple things like this that they don't

865
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,880
know

866
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:38,839
and the medical medium has to

867
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,839
show the truth

868
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:45,420
that is pure straight oil but not from

869
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:47,339
those sesame seeds in all the tahini

870
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:49,380
bottles and jars that you guys have is

871
00:37:47,339 --> 00:37:52,560
added oil that comes from someplace else

872
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:54,480
it's bulk cheap low-grade rancid oil

873
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,920
it's in all your nut Butters and your

874
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,960
tannies

875
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,119
and that's why it is absolutely critical

876
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:02,640
you learn how to make a nut butter

877
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:04,320
if if you don't want the machine if you

878
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:08,160
don't want the mm-1500 even though it's

879
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:10,140
100 off fine then don't eat nut Butters

880
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:12,359
choose not to eat a nut butter because

881
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:13,320
it's better and safer for you not to eat

882
00:38:12,359 --> 00:38:16,800
enough butter

883
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:18,420
because of what that is right there

884
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,820
you know

885
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:22,320
let me get another shot glass or

886
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:24,240
something like that I think I got

887
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:27,079
another one somewhere I'll just rinse

888
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,079
this one out real quick

889
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,079
all right

890
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:34,560
the oil you're looking at is not from

891
00:38:32,339 --> 00:38:36,720
those nuts or those seeds

892
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:38,280
it is added to save the nut butter

893
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,320
company's money

894
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:42,480
it cheapens it

895
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,700
they're putting old rancid oil that

896
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,079
comes from bulk nuts from around the

897
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:48,060
planet

898
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:50,040
it's like people who are eating animal

899
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:53,099
beef right now right they're animal

900
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:53,760
protein eaters medical medium

901
00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:55,680
um

902
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:58,320
uh is Pro

903
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:01,500

904
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,940
vegetarian whatever and you just gotta

905
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,079

protein person fine if you want to be a

908
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:10,740
vegan fine but this is important to know

909
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:12,900
for vegans plant-based people and for

910
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:14,880
animal protein people

911
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:16,680
what are people doing now who are eating

912
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,480
animal protein they're really concerned

913
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,800
and worried about where their beef comes

914
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,800
from where their meat comes from right

915
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:26,160
they'll say they want the local butcher

916
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:28,680
that cuts a piece from that one cow they

917
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:31,260
don't want chopped meat from a thousand

918
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:32,820
cows Blended together so when they have

919
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:35,339
a hamburger

920
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:39,420
they don't want a hamburger that has the

921
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:40,920
DNA from a thousand animals

922
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:42,540
I mean that's original medical meme

923
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:44,119
information though that I brought to

924
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:46,680
that world

925
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:49,140
though regardless

926
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:50,700
you 30 years ago that was a mind blower

927
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:53,160
for people when I said that a hamburger

928
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:55,140
will have a thousand cows in it

929
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:56,400
it was like literally 35 years ago it's

930
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:57,720
one of the one of the things I was

931
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:00,119
telling people they're like that doesn't

932
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:02,520
make sense but it does

933
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:04,560
but here's the thing you don't want your

934
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:07,800
nut Butters

935
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:09,900
to have almonds

936
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:12,000
right

937
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:13,619
from one Orchard

938
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,480
but oil

939
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:17,040
from a hundred different Orchards or

940
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,720
some Orchard on the planet somewhere

941
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:21,359
else

942
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:23,520
you don't want it so separate and you

943
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:26,880
don't want it added into your nut butter

944
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:29,460
you don't want oil added into there

945
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,740
it depreciates your health

946
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:33,420
it's not good for your heart

947
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:34,680
it's not good if you have chronic

948
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:37,079
illness

949
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:39,720
people are eating all the peanut butters

950
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:42,420
all the almond butters all the tahinis

951
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:44,099
all the cashew Butters all the hazelnut

952
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:46,440
Butters and don't realize it they're

953
00:40:44,099 --> 00:40:48,060
drinking oil that's declining and taking

954
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:49,920
down their health and they don't even

955
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:51,359
know it this is the death by a Thousand

956
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,900
Cuts

957
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:58,700
this is the mm Death By A Thousand Cuts

958
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:58,700
so I got another shot glass out here

959
00:41:00,839 --> 00:41:08,339
and I just poured

960
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:10,200
two shot glasses this was never opened I

961
00:41:08,339 --> 00:41:11,520
can do it to four different tahini

962
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,800
companies five different tahini

963
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:17,460
companies this was never opened I just

964
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:22,940
opened it for you and I just poured

965
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:22,940
two of these sesame oil shot glasses

966
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:29,040
I just poured four straight ounces of

967
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:30,480
oil that wasn't from those sesame seeds

968
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,920
and you guys will be drinking it when

969
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:36,140
you take your tahinis out you'll be

970
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,140
drinking that and you don't even know it

971
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,660
and I'm gonna be careful with these

972
00:41:38,339 --> 00:41:41,700
because these are going to Spill and

973
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:44,339
what a mess they're gonna make so I'm

974
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:47,040
gonna put them maybe over here

975
00:41:44,339 --> 00:41:48,660
let's hope uh

976
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:51,780
that's an almond butter that's never

977
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:55,440
been opened look on top

978
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:59,700
that's not the the oil from those nuts

979
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:02,400
that's a peanut butter never opened look

980
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:05,160
on top I'm gonna open it right now and

981
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,720
I'm gonna show you something

982
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:11,099
there's

983
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:15,599
the lid never been opened right there

984
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:19,400
there's the safety lid

985
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:19,400
I'm gonna move these over for the moment

986
00:42:20,099 --> 00:42:23,060
let's get started

987
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:27,960
there's so many different things that

988
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,880
stop us from healing when we're really

989
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:31,980
sick we have to go all the way sometimes

990
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,420
we have to incorporate more tools and

991
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:35,040
more tools and then we got to be careful

992
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:37,200
and we have to weed out the crap in the

993
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,880
garbage because there's people out there

994
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,440
they're doing some mm but they're also

995
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,940
doing whey protein powder which takes

996
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,380
down your health there's people out

997
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:44,760
there they're doing mm and they're doing

998
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:46,140
all these nut Butters which sure nut

999
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:47,640
Butters are pretty good it's not the

1000
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:49,859
worst thing now Butters are good for us

1001
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:51,920
in so many ways right but they're

1002
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:54,480
drinking gobs and gobs of old

1003
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:57,060
dilapidated rancid oil that came from

1004
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:58,740
other places in the world and was bought

1005
00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:02,720
in bulk in a cheap way and then

1006
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:02,720
impregnated into each bottle

1007
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:09,420
and so these things knock us down

1008
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:10,980
there's a thousand things out there in

1009
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:12,480
the health world that chip away at

1010
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:15,119
people while their bodies trying to

1011
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:17,819
fight to survive this is the mm-1500

1012
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:20,640
it's 100 off let's get into this let's

1013
00:43:17,819 --> 00:43:23,400

on

1017
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:31,260
Godspeed

1018
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:35,460
[Music]

1019
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:37,700
all right which one do I want to make

1020
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:37,700
first

1021
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:41,839
let's make some almond butter

1022
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,440
there we go

1023
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:58,500
look at that this is roasted almonds

1024
00:43:56,579 --> 00:44:01,079
whoa look at that

1025
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:03,300
take a look you guys I gotta do it nice

1026
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:06,599
and even so I can get a nice even stick

1027
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:08,220
look at that what maybe I can get a

1028
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:11,640
close-up to in a minute

1029
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:13,500
whoa that's insane

1030
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:16,260
that's what almond butter is supposed to

1031
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:18,060
look like there it is everybody and then

1032
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:20,099
1500

1033
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:21,960
spinning basket can't do that the

1034
00:44:20,099 --> 00:44:22,920
spinning basket juicer they can't even

1035
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:26,480
juice

1036
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:26,480
um vegetables properly

1037
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:33,660
what's a medical medium live without a

1038
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:36,500
little fun

1039
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:36,500
look at that

1040
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,960
take a look

1041
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:52,819
the thing is when it comes down to being

1042
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:52,819
sick every little bit counts

1043
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:57,540
every little bit counts that means if

1044
00:44:54,839 --> 00:44:59,640
you're going to eat a nut butter

1045
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:01,859
you want to make sure you're not totally

1046
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:04,980
being screwed over or taken advantage of

1047
00:45:01,859 --> 00:45:07,500
or ripped off or your body

1048
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:09,599
being betrayed

1049
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:11,040
The Nut Butter companies are betraying

1050
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:13,020
people

1051
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:15,180
bottom line

1052
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:16,740
look at look at this Nut Butter right

1053
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:19,260
here look at these roasts look at the

1054
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:21,980
roasted almond butter going through here

1055
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:21,980
look at that

1056
00:45:22,859 --> 00:45:27,200
that's insane right there you guys see

1057
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,200
this

1058
00:45:28,619 --> 00:45:32,819
probably one of the most mind-blowing

1059
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:34,980
things

1060
00:45:32,819 --> 00:45:36,260
from the mm-1500 link is in the

1061
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:39,000
description link is in the profile

1062
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:41,280
Victoria Smith says what is the point of

1063
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:44,579
companies to put oil in their nut

1064
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:47,760
Butters confused while they add it

1065
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:49,319
because they use less nuts which cost

1066
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:53,280
the nut butter companies a lot of money

1067
00:45:49,319 --> 00:45:57,060
they use less nuts but bring in cheap

1068
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:59,640
bulk oil that cost them pennies pennies

1069
00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:02,099
and then they mark up the price of your

1070
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:04,740
nut butter jar stick it on the Shelf at

1071
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:09,200
Whole Foods or whatever food store and

1072
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:09,200
you pay for rancid old oil

1073
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:19,100
how's that for an explanation

1074
00:46:16,859 --> 00:46:21,720
oh fact

1075
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:24,000
[Music]

1076
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:25,319
all right you guys I just made some

1077
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,760
almond butter right there let's get a

1078
00:46:25,319 --> 00:46:30,060
close-up on here

1079
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:33,060
look at that is that just sick

1080
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:35,460
right where's all that disgusting oil

1081
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:39,480
that's added later and here's the

1082
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:42,540
problem it's you can't you can't be sure

1083
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:45,839
that they're just adding plain old oil

1084
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:48,300
they could the oil could have garbage in

1085
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:52,440
it crapping it it's bulk rancid old oils

1086
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:54,300
in every nut butter out there

1087
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:57,960
that's what nut butter is supposed to

1088
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:59,520
look like right there mm-1500 boom if

1089
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:00,839
you guys are sticking around I want to

1090

00:47:00,839 --> 00:47:03,780
do even more than that I want to make

1092
00:47:02,099 --> 00:47:06,839
three guacamoles I want to make a hummus

1093
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:08,460
this is the mm 1500 it's 100 off I don't

1094
00:47:06,839 --> 00:47:10,740
know if they're ever gonna do a hundred

1095
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:12,780
dollars off again

1096
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:15,000
usually it's sixty dollars off forty

1097
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:18,060
dollars off or 80 off the biggest I've

1098
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:20,280
seen is 100 off Baseline says it's so

1099
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:23,160
messed up and they say on the jar oil

1100
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:25,980
separation is natural evil

1101
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:27,900
I can say so much about that comment

1102
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:30,000
meaning amazing comment I can say so

1103
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:32,640
much about that I could go to town on

1104
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,980
that but I gotta kind of like keep it

1105
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:37,859
contained

1106
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:40,520
got to keep it contained a little bit

1107
00:47:37,859 --> 00:47:40,520
all right

beginning so you know what's going on

1131
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:04,079
I've seen people they're like I don't

1132
00:49:02,099 --> 00:49:06,119
put anything in my body that shouldn't

1133
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:08,819
be in my body but let me just eat all

1134
00:49:06,119 --> 00:49:11,339

1135
00:49:08,819 --> 00:49:14,040
dumped into here and ripping me off in

1136
00:49:11,339 --> 00:49:15,720

00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:19,040

1139
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:26,300
running some hazelnuts through here here

1140
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,300
we go

1141
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:31,260
I'm gonna pack them into jars in a

1142
00:49:29,819 --> 00:49:33,119
minute but I'm just gonna actually just

1143
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:35,579
get them into their nice beautiful Bowl

1144
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:36,900
so let's get a close-up on the hazelnut

1145
00:49:35,579 --> 00:49:38,160
right here

1146
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:40,020

1147
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:42,000

1148
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:44,099
guys over here a close-up you guys here

1149
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,079
on Tick Tock IG

1150
00:49:44,099 --> 00:49:50,780
nice little close-up as well all right

1151
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:50,780
let's keep on doing it roasted cashews

1152
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:54,440
let's go

1153
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:02,640
now

1154
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:04,200
when you make your own nut Butters it's

1155
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,579
a game changer

1156
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:08,040
now if you're not going to eat nut

1157
00:50:05,579 --> 00:50:09,660
Butters

1158
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:12,420
and you're gonna buy a store-bought one

1159
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:14,160
once in a blue moon don't buy it

1160
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:17,280
don't buy it

1161
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:19,380
it's not worth it

1162
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:21,480
if you give nut Butters to your kids

1163
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:24,319
your children your family members

1164
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:24,319
that you want

1165
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:30,599
then you want something that works

1166
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:32,900
you want you to make your own

1167
00:50:30,599 --> 00:50:37,079
fresh clean

1168
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:40,760
non-rancet oils no oils in there rancid

1169
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:40,760
oils thrown in there to cheapen it

1170
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:45,359
you guys link is in the profile link is

1171
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:47,579
in the description

1172
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:49,440
I'm just making some roasted cashew

1173
00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:52,760
butter

1174
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:52,760
and then we're gonna move on

1175
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:58,020
now here's the thing though there's

1176
00:50:54,780 --> 00:51:01,319
people that can't have they don't have

1177
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:04,020
any options so what I recommend is if

1178
00:51:01,319 --> 00:51:07,020
you buy a nut butter

1179
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:10,440
if you buy a nut butter which is fine I

1180
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:13,140
recommend pouring the oil out

1181
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:15,599
that's something you can do pour the oil

1182
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:16,980
out like I did so if you see enough

1183
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:18,540
butter you like because you're going to

1184
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:19,980
eat nut Butters and you don't have any

1185
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:22,559
other way to do it you don't have a

1186
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:24,599
machine that makes your own pour the oil

1187
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:27,300
out

1188
00:51:24,599 --> 00:51:29,520
so when you get a nut butter

1189
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:31,380
it's important it doesn't get rid of all

1190
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:32,880
the oil you know I have a friend the

1191
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:34,380
other day that said listen I'm gonna eat

1192
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:36,420
enough butter no matter what I said okay

1193
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:37,440
then then here's here's some good nut

1194
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:39,359
Butters

1195
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:41,579
it's still going to have this oil in it

1196
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:44,220
it's still going to be oil that's just

1197
00:51:41,579 --> 00:51:45,839
bulk oil that's cheap that's from other

1198
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:48,540
places around the world that's how it

1199
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:50,880
works but dump the oil out if you can

1200
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:53,460
try to dump as much oil

1201
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:56,280
you possibly can out

1202
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:58,200
and that's what I tell friends and

1203
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:00,599
that's why I've even said people come to

1204
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:03,540
me like look aw I'm gonna eat nut butter

1205
00:52:00,599 --> 00:52:05,819
no matter what I go I got you totally

1206
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:08,640
understand there's some brands that that

1207
00:52:05,819 --> 00:52:10,440
I like then anyway they're like you know

1208
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:12,300
some Brands out there I've talked about

1209
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:14,579
I say look you can look at this brand

1210
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:16,559
that brand but I tell people I give them

1211
00:52:14,579 --> 00:52:18,540
tips if you're gonna have it anyway dump

1212
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:19,680
the oil out so what you want to do right

1213
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:23,099
there

1214
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:24,839
is you want to dump that oil out

1215
00:52:23,099 --> 00:52:28,079
it's still not going to get rid of all

1216
00:52:24,839 --> 00:52:29,700
of it by far but it gives you a better

1217
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:32,160
shot because there's people that are

1218
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:33,599
going to just go and buy it anyway so I

1219
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,980
want to just give them options if

1220
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:37,800
they're going to do that anyway all

1221
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:41,160
right so we just did some

1222
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:43,079
um roasted cashew butter that's roasted

1223
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:45,960
cashew butter

1224
00:52:43,079 --> 00:52:48,780
now here's raw cashews you can make a

1225
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:52,040
raw cashew nut butter as well so there's

1226
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:52,040
raw cashews

1227
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:55,980
into

1228
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:58,859
some little jars really quick I could

1229
00:52:55,980 --> 00:53:00,720
pack this one in so here's the cashew

1230
00:52:58,859 --> 00:53:01,630
butter right there

1231
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:04,760

1232
00:53:01,630 --> 00:53:04,760

so what I'm doing is putting it in these

1237
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:17,760
little jars and then I put a lid on it

1238
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:19,920

1239
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:22,800

00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,400
hands are clean

1242
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:33,119
I wasn't out at the post office or at

1243
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:34,980
the store or grocery store and I was

1244
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:37,200
opening up all kinds of doors out there

1245
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:38,700
and had my hands on the shopping cart

1246
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:42,420

00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:55,020
something you eat once in a while is it

1292
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:57,839
something you eat a lot of now I don't

1293
00:55:55,020 --> 00:56:00,839
like to buy store-bought hummus because

1294
00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:03,660
of all the stuff that's in it the amount

1295
00:56:00,839 --> 00:56:08,000
of junk and garbage that's in a

1296
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:08,000
store-bought hummus it's really scary

1297
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:13,920
actually frightening to tell you the

1298
00:56:10,859 --> 00:56:16,800
truth okay so I got chickpeas right here

1299
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:18,480
I want to show you guys

1300
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:20,880
you can make black bean hummus lentil

1301
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:22,800
hummus these are garbanzo beans

1302
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:24,599
chickpeas this is the kind of hummus I'm

1303
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:27,720
making right now

1304
00:56:24,599 --> 00:56:29,040
it's going to make a simple hummus I'm

1305
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:30,839
going to take orders what would you like

1306
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:32,940
in your hummus is there anything

1307
00:56:30,839 --> 00:56:34,440
particular you see I got different herbs

1308
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:36,960
here

1309
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:38,579
um I got lime lemon do you like lime in

1310
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,540
your hummus or do you like lemon in your

1311
00:56:38,579 --> 00:56:41,880
hummus

1312
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:43,859
do you like garlic in your hummus

1313
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:46,980
I think what I'm gonna do is grab a

1314
00:56:43,859 --> 00:56:48,960
garlic clove now and get it ready

1315
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:51,380
how much garlic do you like in your

1316
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:51,380
hummus

1317
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:55,040
you like a lot

1318
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:59,880
or a little

1319
00:56:57,420 --> 00:57:01,619
I tend to like a lot

1320
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:03,420
but I've seen you know people where it's

1321
00:57:01,619 --> 00:57:05,160
like whoa too much that's way too much

1322
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:07,680
garlic I don't like my hummus with that

1323
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:10,260
much garlic in there okay now what

1324
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:14,760
you'll see here is instead of putting

1325
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:16,380
tahini I am going to put sesame seeds

1326
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:18,780
one thing you're not going to get with

1327
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:21,660
sesame seeds is all that added

1328
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:24,540
gnarly oil you're not gonna have that

1329
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:27,059
it's just the seeds plus the sesame

1330
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:28,859
seeds have so much flavor you can just

1331
00:57:27,059 --> 00:57:31,619
add a little bit into your hummus in the

1332
00:57:28,859 --> 00:57:33,780
mm-1500 and it'll actually grind it all

1333
00:57:31,619 --> 00:57:36,359
together it'll get that flavor all

1334
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:37,800
through the hummus so that's what I'm

1335
00:57:36,359 --> 00:57:40,319
going to add I have people coming over

1336
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:43,280
later they like salt I want to

1337
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:46,020
accommodate anybody whoever comes over

1338
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:48,059
and I will make them anything they want

1339
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:50,900
I promise that the hummus would have

1340
00:57:48,059 --> 00:57:50,900
some salt in it

1341
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:55,980
so I'm going to find the salt in a

1342
00:57:54,359 --> 00:57:58,520
little bit here it is

1343
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:58,520
all right

1344
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:05,700
in a making decision right now what do I

1345
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:08,760
want in here lemon or lime I think I'm

1346
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:10,619
gonna go with a lemon

1347
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:13,980
and I'm going to cut that lemon in half

1348
00:58:10,619 --> 00:58:15,240
and get it ready there we go

1349
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:17,640
okay

1350
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:19,200
and the other decision is am I going to

1351
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:22,380
put herbs in here

1352
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:24,859
yes I am I'm gonna do a little bit of

1353
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:24,859
Basil

1354
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:30,780
we'll see we'll see

1355
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:32,280
maybe none at all

1356
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:34,760
all right

1357
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,760
Let's Roll

1358
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:42,260
extremely low-fat hummus

1359
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:51,599
hummus in the store usually has a mix of

1360
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:55,619
canola and olive oil

1361
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:57,900
canola oil declines your health

1362
00:58:55,619 --> 00:59:00,900
I've written about this for years in the

1363
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:02,160
medical medium books

1364
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:04,500

is that insane

1383
00:59:55,920 --> 01:00:00,420

fat you're not killing your pancreas

1389
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:17,099
one of the things that happens out there

1390
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:19,319
is people their pancreas just takes the

1391
01:00:17,099 --> 01:00:21,359
licking and takes a licking and one day

1392
01:00:19,319 --> 01:00:23,640
their pancreas says I can't do it

1393
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:26,599
anymore you've been killing me without

1394
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:26,599

1490
01:05:00,599 --> 01:05:03,440
I'm a little nervous

1491
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:08,460
guacamole time

1492
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:11,780
all right

1493
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:11,780
I'm gonna use

1494
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:15,500
this bowl right here

1495
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:22,200
okay I got some avocados I want to give

1496
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:23,760
you guys a couple of avocado tips

1497
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:26,460
when is

1498
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:28,260
I've showed you this before

1499
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:30,540
you'll see there's a butt where the stem

1500
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:33,180
was so the avocado was hanging off the

1501
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:35,460
tree and the stem went like this and it

1502
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:37,980
was attached to the avocado and then

1503
01:05:35,460 --> 01:05:39,660
when they Twisted it off or it was cut

1504
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:42,540
off the stem

1505
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:44,940
the avocado Growers it left the piece of

1506
01:05:42,540 --> 01:05:46,799
the stem right there and what I see

1507
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:49,020
happen with people's guacamole is

1508
01:05:46,799 --> 01:05:51,599
they're not prepared to bite on such a

1509
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:54,359
hard knobby thing and when people make

1510
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:55,319
their guacamole that knob see I just

1511
01:05:54,359 --> 01:05:57,960
took it off

1512
01:05:55,319 --> 01:06:00,000
then knob goes in the guacamole

1513
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:01,920
so many people

1514
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,960
had that happen a friend of mine was at

1515
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:05,460
a restaurant in La and was eating

1516
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:07,200
guacamole

1517
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:10,859
with his friend

1518
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:12,119
and he watched his friend bite onto that

1519
01:06:10,859 --> 01:06:14,880
very thing

1520
01:06:12,119 --> 01:06:15,839
that was in the guacamole and like bit

1521
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:18,420
it

1522
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:20,460
injured themselves bit their tongue bit

1523
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:22,140
their lip it was the weirdest thing he

1524
01:06:20,460 --> 01:06:24,059
said it was the strangest thing they

1525
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:26,520
took a look at what it was and they went

1526
01:06:24,059 --> 01:06:27,960
they were like we want to show you what

1527
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:29,940
was in your guacamole and they're like

1528
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:32,819
that's weird how did that get in there

1529
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:34,319
that's because chefs do it all the time

1530
01:06:32,819 --> 01:06:37,200
as they're making and preparing

1531
01:06:34,319 --> 01:06:38,700
guacamole that knob actually ends up in

1532
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:41,339
the food

1533
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:43,799
and so many people's guacamoles here's

1534
01:06:41,339 --> 01:06:46,619
another one right here

1535
01:06:43,799 --> 01:06:48,240
I'm taking this one off there it is make

1536
01:06:46,619 --> 01:06:50,280
sure you remove it before you start

1537
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:52,260
making your guacamole in your bowl or

1538
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:54,240
whatever you're doing all right cutting

1539
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:58,079
open these avocados

1540
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:59,760
preparing them really quick it's easy

1541
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:05,099
and we're gonna make

1542
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:08,480
a really basic good guacamole at first

1543
01:07:05,099 --> 01:07:08,480
so right now I'm doing this

1544
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:11,660
let's get another one

1545
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:17,299
wonderful

1546
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:17,299
okay

1547
01:07:20,339 --> 01:07:23,000
all right

1548
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:26,880
so

1549
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:28,440
there's the avocado half I'm just taking

1550
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:31,559
a spoon you can take any spoon you want

1551
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:34,440
in there removing that

1552
01:07:31,559 --> 01:07:37,020
I'm gonna put that down in there

1553
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:39,660
these are not fermented these are not

1554
01:07:37,020 --> 01:07:42,000
spoiled

1555
01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:44,160
what happens to a lot of people is they

1556
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,780
buy them dark do not buy your avocados

1557
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:47,700
dark like this unless you're taking a

1558
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:49,980
risk because you're gonna this is one

1559
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:52,500
that actually is over ripe in my hand

1560
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:54,299
you buy these over ripe you get a bad

1561
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:57,180
experience what happens is the avocados

1562
01:07:54,299 --> 01:07:59,099
fermented it's spoiled it'll have dark

1563
01:07:57,180 --> 01:08:00,900
spots or if it doesn't have dark spots

1564
01:07:59,099 --> 01:08:03,119
in there it could be fermented anyway

1565
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:04,619
and you have a bad experience a poor

1566
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:06,900
experience with your guacamole not even

1567
01:08:04,619 --> 01:08:11,339
realize it you're eating spoiled rancid

1568
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:13,440
old avocado and you don't even know it

1569
01:08:11,339 --> 01:08:15,359
so what you're seeing here these are not

1570
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:18,540
these even though there's a dark spot

1571
01:08:15,359 --> 01:08:20,640
right there these are still good

1572
01:08:18,540 --> 01:08:23,699
there's a difference between a dark spot

1573
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:25,620
and totally Rancid

1574
01:08:23,699 --> 01:08:27,660
it's you can actually take out like a

1575
01:08:25,620 --> 01:08:28,500
little dark spot if you want but there

1576
01:08:27,660 --> 01:08:30,420
we go

1577
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:33,859
all right

1578
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:33,859
I'm gonna do some lime

1579
01:08:35,699 --> 01:08:41,100
maybe uh let me crack open another lemon

1580
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:44,100
I'll do a blend of a little lime and

1581
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:46,640
lemon with this one here

1582
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:46,640

1583
01:08:46,739 --> 01:08:50,279
all right so the attachment for this if

1584
01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:52,140
you've done the if you actually own the

01:08:50,279 --> 01:08:55,080

1587
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:59,219

little bit of the hummus left over in

1593

1594
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:13,920

1595
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:15,239
I'm gonna put it back on the front

1596
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:18,259

and lemon

1617
01:10:07,739 --> 01:10:11,640

1638
01:11:26,900 --> 01:11:31,679
clean guacamole

1639
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:35,100

1656
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:23,480
cilantro basil anything

1657
01:12:23,580 --> 01:12:26,580
foreign

1658
01:12:28,219 --> 01:12:33,560
cilantro basil

1659
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:33,560
chives

1660
01:12:35,340 --> 01:12:37,820
all right

1661
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:51,659
and I'm gonna pop some lime on top

1662
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:53,159
because as you know guacamole

1663
01:12:51,659 --> 01:12:56,040
it's going to be sitting there for a

1664
01:12:53,159 --> 01:12:57,900
while and I want to keep it looking as

1665
01:12:56,040 --> 01:13:00,239
fresh as possible and there we are right

1666
01:12:57,900 --> 01:13:04,460
there that's going to go in this tray

1667
01:13:00,239 --> 01:13:04,460
I'm gonna get another one rolling now

1668
01:13:05,159 --> 01:13:07,640
okay

1669
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:11,900
all right next

1670
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:17,120
this next one is the medicine guacamole

1671
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:22,620
the difference with this one is it's

1672
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:24,360
going to have a lot of intense herbs in

1673
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:26,520
it

1674
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:29,420
you want to make the most out of every

1675
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:29,420
meal you have

1676
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:38,780
so what I'm doing is cutting open a few

1677
01:13:35,699 --> 01:13:38,780
avocados really quick

1678
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:45,420
I didn't want to pre-cut them because I

1679
01:13:41,940 --> 01:13:47,100
didn't want them oxidizing you know when

1680
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:49,920
you actually open an avocado if you let

1681
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:51,239
it sit too long it starts to oxidize I

1682
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:52,980
didn't want that to happen so you guys

1683
01:13:51,239 --> 01:13:56,600
got to hang in there while I just knock

1684
01:13:52,980 --> 01:13:56,600
out a few of these like this real quick

1685
01:13:56,820 --> 01:13:59,420
there we go

1686
01:13:59,699 --> 01:14:03,140
that one's a bad avocado

1687
01:14:03,780 --> 01:14:06,800
bad avocado

1688
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:13,159
that's a good one right there

1689
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:13,159
let's get another one

1690
01:14:17,699 --> 01:14:22,760
got one right there a little iffy but

1691
01:14:19,860 --> 01:14:22,760
I'm gonna hold on to it

1692
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:27,960
of course is they're dropped all the

1693
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:30,239
time on the floor and then the produce

1694
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:32,340
guy comes around and he puts them back

1695
01:14:30,239 --> 01:14:35,040
up and then people come around and they

1696
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:36,540
they're going to get their avocados and

1697
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:39,060
they drop

1698
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:40,560
a whole bunch on the floor and that's

1699
01:14:39,060 --> 01:14:42,120
one thing that happens or they squeeze

1700
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:43,800
them people go in and they're squeezing

1701
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:45,600
their avocados all the time all right

1702
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:49,500
let's roll

1703
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:52,880
so I'm putting herbs in with this one

1704
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:52,880

01:15:00,179 --> 01:15:05,640
know if they'll ever do that again

1708
01:15:02,580 --> 01:15:08,760

01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:24,600
yeah that nut butter thing just blows my

1842
01:22:22,260 --> 01:22:27,480
mind even till now it just blows my mind

1843
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:29,940
when I think about it what I like about

1844
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:31,500
the mm1500 is

1845
01:22:29,940 --> 01:22:33,719
I mean you can knock out so many

1846
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:36,239
guacamoles like this

1847
01:22:33,719 --> 01:22:39,420
if you have your stuff ready you could

1848
01:22:36,239 --> 01:22:41,699
just boom knock these babies out

1849
01:22:39,420 --> 01:22:43,560
so we've got another one here

1850
01:22:41,699 --> 01:22:47,120
all right

1851
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:47,120
turning the lightning speed for you guys

1852
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:52,260
all right let's roll

1853
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:55,040
this one's a spicy hot one I'm gonna get

1854
01:22:52,260 --> 01:22:55,040
these cayennes

1855
01:22:55,380 --> 01:23:03,480
so one Cayenne in a guacamole this size

1856
01:22:59,699 --> 01:23:04,500
is already probably too spicy like one

1857
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:06,600
of these

1858
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:09,739
I'm gonna put

1859
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:09,739
three in there

1860
01:23:10,860 --> 01:23:15,659
okay

1861
01:23:11,940 --> 01:23:18,060
it's going to be really hot really spicy

1862
01:23:15,659 --> 01:23:19,380
I don't recommend doing that though like

1863
01:23:18,060 --> 01:23:21,239
at your house if this is what you're

1864
01:23:19,380 --> 01:23:24,960
gonna do just put like a little bit if

1865
01:23:21,239 --> 01:23:29,040
you're into it but don't overdo it

1866
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:32,120
foreign because that's a lot

1867
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:32,120
all right let's roll

1868
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:42,500
it's gonna be the spicy one

1869
01:23:47,820 --> 01:23:53,640
here we go

1870
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:56,940
when it comes down to chronic illness

1871
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:59,340
and someone's really struggling

1872
01:23:56,940 --> 01:24:03,260
if they

1873
01:23:59,340 --> 01:24:03,260
if they give their body what it needs

1874
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:08,239
their body

1875
01:24:09,239 --> 01:24:13,020
knows

1876
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:14,280
it knows you're trying to give it what

1877
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:17,040
it needs

1878
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:21,020
it knows you're working hard on it

1879
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:21,020
communication with your immune system

1880
01:24:22,260 --> 01:24:26,219
is important because every time you do

1881
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:28,380
something good for yourself tell your

1882
01:24:26,219 --> 01:24:32,960
body that you're doing it

1883
01:24:28,380 --> 01:24:32,960
I am going to make a medicine guacamole

1884
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:38,280
talk to your immune system I'm going to

1885
01:24:36,120 --> 01:24:39,020
make a medicine guacamole for my immune

1886
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:40,980
system

1887
01:24:39,020 --> 01:24:43,199
[Music]

1888
01:24:40,980 --> 01:24:44,640
I'm putting a garlic clove in this one

1889
01:24:43,199 --> 01:24:47,120
so not only is it going to have the

1890
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:47,120
Cayenne

1891
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:54,879
the garlic in it as well

[Music]

1895
01:25:08,820 --> 01:25:13,260
what happens is that if you're going to

1896
01:25:10,860 --> 01:25:14,760
be not eating avocados that's fine if

1897
01:25:13,260 --> 01:25:17,400
you're going to be doing something like

1898
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:19,020
the 369 or the 28 day cleanse without

1899
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:22,140
the avocado if you're going to be doing

1900
01:25:19,020 --> 01:25:24,179
a 369 or a mono eating cleanse without

1901
01:25:22,140 --> 01:25:25,739
avocado because you're working on a

1902
01:25:24,179 --> 01:25:28,580
deeper level of your healing process

1903
01:25:25,739 --> 01:25:28,580
that's incredible

1904
01:25:28,980 --> 01:25:34,260
but if you're gonna eat a guacamole in

1905
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:38,120
between or some avocado on a salad and

1906
01:25:34,260 --> 01:25:38,120
make it as medicinal as possible

1907
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:56,239
all right got the garlic clove in here

1908
01:25:52,260 --> 01:25:56,239
let me add some lemon in here too

1909
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:02,420
let me add some lime in here as well

1910
01:26:03,420 --> 01:26:08,699
and I got to get the Cayenne in here

1911
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:09,560
I'm taking off the

1912

to

1950
01:28:20,820 --> 01:28:26,100

1951
01:28:24,540 --> 01:28:27,480
I'm gonna take this piece of broccoli

1952
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:30,800

1953
01:28:27,480 --> 01:28:30,800
spicy guacamole here

1954
01:28:32,460 --> 01:28:35,639
um

1955
01:28:33,780 --> 01:28:37,860
yeah those are from my garden those are

1956
01:28:35,639 --> 01:28:40,440
hot peppers from my garden and the herbs

1957
01:28:37,860 --> 01:28:43,460
are from my garden

1958
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:43,460
well that's insane

1959
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:47,239
oh that's that bites you

1960
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:51,659
I mean you guys there's probably some of

1961
01:28:50,159 --> 01:28:53,280
you that like eat so many hot peppers

1962
01:28:51,659 --> 01:28:55,139
you think I'm like probably a wuss or

1963
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:57,480
something and you're saying like well no

1964
01:28:55,139 --> 01:28:59,100
aw is a wuss because you just put three

1965
01:28:57,480 --> 01:29:00,540
big cayennes in there and it can't be

1966
01:28:59,100 --> 01:29:02,639
that hot

1967
01:29:00,540 --> 01:29:04,320
but for some reason this Cayenne have

1968
01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:07,620
been growing in the garden has been

1969
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:09,360
insane it's it's actually not every just

1970
01:29:07,620 --> 01:29:11,219
because if you go look up cayenne I'm

1971
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:13,020
like right

1972
01:29:11,219 --> 01:29:14,639
and you look at the heat units right and

1973
01:29:13,020 --> 01:29:17,159
you're like oh what does it have and it

1974
01:29:14,639 --> 01:29:18,719
says it'll have 95 000 or it'll have

1975
01:29:17,159 --> 01:29:20,400
whatever it'll say

1976
01:29:18,719 --> 01:29:22,440
I mean don't quote me on that whatever's

1977
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:24,300
out there but just so you know one

1978
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:26,699
Cayenne can be a lot hotter than another

1979
01:29:24,300 --> 01:29:28,920
Cayenne one Cayenne plant can be an

1980
01:29:26,699 --> 01:29:31,320
entirely different heat level than

1981
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:33,600
another one depending on the soil

1982
01:29:31,320 --> 01:29:36,540
and so many different factors for some

1983
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:38,639
reason these cayennes are like dangerous

1984
01:29:36,540 --> 01:29:42,139
they're way hotter but I'm gonna have a

1985
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:42,139
little bit more because I can't help it

1986
01:29:42,719 --> 01:29:45,719
foreign

1987
01:29:52,679 --> 01:29:56,520
