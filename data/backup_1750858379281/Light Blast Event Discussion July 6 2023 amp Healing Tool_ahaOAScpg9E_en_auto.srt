24
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:54,780
let's just get some stuff chopped up

25
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:57,180
really quick

26
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:00,180
to begin with four carrots

27
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,440

28
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,480

00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,939
after that light blast

32
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:12,320
incredible

33
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:15,240
truly I can't even tell you

34
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,000

00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,560

37
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,840
if you post your experience on the light

38
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,939
blast if you post a real or do a post

39
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,340
I'm not going to be able to see it

40
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:31,020
the algorithm has been changed on IG so

41
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,759
I can't see it so what you have to do is

42
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,520
you have to hashtag medical medium on

43
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,740
that post and tag at Medical medium but

44
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,759
you have to then put it on your insta

45
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,340
story

46
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:44,640
and hashtag medical medium and tag

47
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:48,079
medical medium on your insta story

48
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,079
then I can see it

49
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:57,420
I'm chopping up some carrots right now

50
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:59,700
let's get this going

51
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,040
we're making the healing broth because

52
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,119
it's an incredible tool medical medium

53
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,060
tool

54
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,320
to help with emotional healing emotional

55
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,399
cleansing

56
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,399
now I don't I mean

57
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:18,540
just talking to a family member

58
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:20,520
and a friend who was at the light blast

59
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:23,520
and they experience

60
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,780
the light that came down some people saw

61
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,180
the light

62
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,260
as clear as day it's all they saw was

63
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,140
the white light

64
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:32,760
and then some people saw it way up there

65
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:35,160
behind the Stars

66
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:38,160
and then some people saw a flash in

67
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:42,440
their eyes some people after it was done

68
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,440
saw white light when it was finished

69
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,239
some people didn't

70
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,860
felt it through their

71
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,300
body and they felt it in their hands

72
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,300
they felt it in their legs

73
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,200
I'm getting some carrots in here

74
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,580
I still have Goosebumps

75
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,440
it was really intense

76
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,120
really intense

77
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,280
right so I got my carrots going let's

78
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:11,700
let's keep this up

79
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:14,040
um I don't have celery stalks but I got

80
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:16,379
the tops of celery I had the celery

81
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,920
greens right very little stock but I'm

82
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:18,920
gonna use it

83
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:29,120
from broth

84
00:03:31,099 --> 00:03:36,780
ceiling broth is helpful because it

85
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,120
helps with emotions

86
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:42,420
a little bit cleansed what happens is

87
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,040
there's space now inside of us after the

88
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:47,580
light blast I don't know if you feel it

89
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:50,480

without chopping my hand

128
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:38,759
this knife happens to be a little extra

129
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:41,840
sharp

130
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:41,840

light blast it's gonna blow your mind

150
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:40,620
like transformational stuff

151
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:44,100
seriously

152
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:47,220

we have a very tough sweet potato here

157
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:05,600
and I'm just gonna be careful

158
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:07,500
be very careful

159
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,120
[Music]

160
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,440
don't want to mess around with these

161
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,740
sweet potatoes you don't want to cut

162
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:16,199
them wrong you don't want to mess up

163
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:17,900
you know what happened was after the

164
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:21,419
light blast

165
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:25,080
I was calm

166
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:28,460
I just stayed in my chair

167
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,460
I stayed in my chair

168
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:34,199
and then stayed in my chair and stayed

169
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,419
in my chair I didn't get up but I didn't

170
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:41,840
get up for a long time

171
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:41,840
I just soaked it in and I just sat there

172
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:46,199
and

173
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,520
it was a feeling I Can't Describe I'm

174
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,440
still trying to actually describe it

175
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,500
which leads me to this what's going to

176
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:55,440
happen with a lot of you guys

177
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:57,900
is things are going to unravel after the

178
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,699
light blast and I've seen this happen so

179
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:04,500
many times where

180
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:06,660
it a week later you start feeling all

181
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,400
these results from it two weeks later

182
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,919
you start feeling all these results from

183
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:15,000
it a month later it's still carrying on

184
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:17,160
or things start happening a month later

185
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,560
it works different in every single

186
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:22,500
person because we're not all the same no

187
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:24,419
one is the same as another person we're

188
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,979
not all the same some people are going

189
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:27,419
to see the light some people are

190
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:28,500
actually going to feel it in their hands

191
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:29,639
some people are going to feel it

192
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,199
instantly in their neck they're going to

193
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:32,820
feel it run through them

194
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,440
they're gonna sleep better tonight

195
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,820
they're going to have deeper Dreams

196
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,680
they're gonna have vivid dreams they're

197
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:40,020
going to have experiences everybody's

198
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:43,260
different it's going to be like that so

199
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:45,000
just remember as each day goes on how

200
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:47,360
things are going to be different along

201
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,360
the way

202
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:55,140
for each person no one is the same

203
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,100
you have emotional experiences someone

204
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,680
else

205
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:00,180
doesn't have someone else has emotional

206
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,420
experiences and wounds and they're soul

207
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:05,220
that someone else doesn't have

208
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:08,459
and that's how it works

209
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:11,279
someone asks what is the light blast we

210
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:13,320

211
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:16,580
we just did it

212
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:19,620
this morning Eastern Time afternoon

213
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:21,120
Pacific time

214
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:22,920
and it's something you want to

215
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,260
experience get on the newsletter so you

216
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:27,600
can learn about it because I want to do

217
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:33,240
another one

218
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:36,839
a hundred and ten thousand people

219
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:39,620
we're on the light blast today a hundred

220
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:43,860
and ten thousand people

221
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:45,899
33 000 people signed up registered for

222
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:49,580
the light blast

223
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:49,580
33 000 people

224
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:54,899
and what happened was

225
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:58,700
over a hundred and ten thousand people

226
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:58,700
ended up at the life blast

227
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:05,640
because people gave out the link

228
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:08,220
remember when I remember when I said

229
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,380
something about that try not to give out

230
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,540
the link I'm trying to say it in a

231
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:14,100
really nice way please don't give out

232
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:16,500
the link

233
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,360
because if you give out the link you're

234
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:20,700
probably gonna crash our technology

235
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,080
because we only have technology enough

236
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,899
for

237
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:29,339
with technology not from technology

238
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:32,160
experts telling us that 33 000 people 30

239
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:35,580
000 people was Max on this one that

240
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:39,080

00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:39,080
people for the sign up

242
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:46,560
but what happened was lots of people

243
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:49,200
shared the link gave the link out and it

244
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:52,040
ended up ended up over a hundred and ten

245
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,839
thousand people were on

246
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:57,120
but what happens when that happened is

247
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:59,339
it ends up starting to break down the

248
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,980
system a little bit and then some people

249
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:02,610
they lose a connection or something it

250
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,500
can happen

251
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:07,920

life look even abuse all kinds of

301
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,800
different things that have been

302
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,839
happening in their life maybe they were

303
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,660
gaslit forever in their life all these

304
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:06,000
years whatever it is broken trust issues

305
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:07,980

breakups or friendships

309
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:15,839

310
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,279
many people had so many wounds and the

311
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,200
world is getting tougher and what

312
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,060
happened was when that light went

313
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,760
through people and it hit the crown of

314
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:26,639
their head and it ran through them it

315
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:29,760
just it blew up that stuff to get it out

316
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:33,000
of them it literally sent shrapnel out

317
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,380
it sent debris out of their body and

318
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,420
that's why I was saying you got to kind

319
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:38,579
of like shake the air a little bit

320
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:40,139
because it was blowing that much out of

321
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:42,779
people

322
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:44,839
and it was that intense and the 10

323
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:48,839
people left were the toughest cookies

324
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:50,880
the ones with a lot of injuries a lot of

325
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:52,139
Heartache a lot of betrayal that

326
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,940
happened in their life a lot of broken

327
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:55,940
trust and those 10 people

328
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:02,279
they it all blew out of them by the end

329
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:05,160
it was just boom that debris came out

330
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:08,160
that hurt that wound all of it came out

331
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:10,200

332
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,959
10 people there were a few people that

333
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,639
went through close to the beginning went

334
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,779
right through them where the light goes

335
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,940
right through the crown of their head

336
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:19,920
runs through the body runs out of their

00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:23,339
feet into the ground there was a bunch

338
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:27,120

342
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,000
people didn't even get through their

343
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,000
head right at the beginning

344
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:52,560

345
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,720

00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:57,420
okay I felt

347
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,100
Zen veteran says I felt stop in the

348
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:01,680
chest and you felt the light stop in

349
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:03,839
your chest then you felt it stop in the

350
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,300
heart then you felt it stop in the

351
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,440
stomach and then it went all the way

352
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,860
through

353
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:13,199
that's what it was doing that's the kind

354
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:15,240
of that's the kind of experiences that

355
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,920
was happening and spirit of compassion

356
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,260
was telling me that light was getting

357
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,760
locked up in people the third one was

358
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,860
starting to really get through people

359
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,480
then it was Amplified then the fourth

360
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:27,120
one then it was Amplified and the more

361
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:30,300
people were freed

orange and purple and violet when I

375
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:04,560
closed my eyes during the blast a lot of

376
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,920
people saw a lot of different colors too

377
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,760
that's really interesting

378
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,560
foreign

379
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,240

380
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,339
pepper in here

381
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:17,100
I'm not going to put the whole Cayenne

382
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:20,040
in there because I don't want this broth

383
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:22,560
too bitey too hot so I'm going to do

384
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,940
that I still got garlic to put in I

385
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,139

389
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,040
tell you though I'm really actually

390
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,240
feeling really good after the white

391
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:40,199
blood

392
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:42,180
I feel okay so Rory says I feel so much

393
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:46,079
better since the light blast incredible

394
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:49,100
and then I am Freddy I think said I felt

395
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,100
it in my hands

396
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,079
I felt it in my hands and legs

397
00:16:56,339 --> 00:17:02,579
I couldn't get off my seat afterwards I

398
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:04,860
just sat there I was kind of in shop

399
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:07,260
I read some people saw rainbow colors I

400
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:10,939
see that coming in IG amazing I feel so

401
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,939
much better Julian says in IG

402
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:15,319
it's just it's such a miracle

403
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:21,120
windwild says I had a hard time getting

404
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:22,919
online so I got the end of it I want to

405
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:26,100
do it again I will try to make sure we

406
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:27,720
do it again soon not later but soon I

407
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:32,000
feel really bad for a lot of people that

408
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:34,679
could not get in to the light blast

409
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,480
Laura says I feel infused over there on

410
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:40,200
Facebook

411
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:42,419
you did cry after the first blast

412
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,400
well if you if you're you were there for

413
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:47,600
a oh my God at the first blast you'd be

414
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,600
the very first that came down

415
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:54,080
you got a little parsley in here if you

416
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:54,080
guys don't mind

417
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:03,419
loan says over there on Facebook why do

418
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:06,240
we cry during the light blast

419
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:11,580
so much is Letting Go

420
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:15,900
we bury we bury we stuff inside we hide

421
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:18,840
we put aside we put deep

422
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:21,059
deep the emotional wounds because you

423
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:23,160
have to move forward

424
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:25,200
you can't live in the hurt in the moment

425
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,640
so we have to pick up our our feet we

426
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,299
got to move forward

427
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:34,039
but what happens is over the years

428
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:34,039
it builds up inside of us

429
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,820
some people might not feel much at first

430
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,980
but then they'll feel it and see the

431
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:42,600
changes in the coming days weeks and

432
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:46,039
months

433
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,039
let's get some garlic in here

434
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:53,640
we stuff it inside

435
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,440
we stuff it inside

436
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,600
my anatomy's over there

437
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,640
Madeline says it was intense for me I

438
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,460
was dizzy nauseated and felt a little

439
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:04,860
weak afterward it was only later that I

440
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:06,059
got my energy back I feel good though it

441
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,679
is real

442
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:10,080
Thank you Madeline for being here thank

443
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:12,120
you for being at the light blast

444
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,100
truly I'm so glad you were able to get

445
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:18,020
in

446
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:20,340
I feel sad about people that people that

447
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:23,700
registered and and they say they

448
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:27,240
couldn't get in I'm 110 000 people there

449
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:29,220
the system was was barely hanging in

450
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,380
there by a thread because it wasn't

451
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:33,600
designed for a hundred and ten thousand

452
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:36,440
people

453
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,440
dear Lord

454
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:42,000
Patricia Santana over there on YouTube I

455
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:45,240
felt the light blast especially in my

456
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,100
legs I have a peaceful feeling let's see

457
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,840
how we sleep tonight too some of us

458
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:51,600
might sleep a lot better some of us

459
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:53,460
might just be buzzing because of the

460
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,780
amount of healing that occurred it's

461
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,520
almost like you don't know what to do

462
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:59,400
with yourself when you get that much

463
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:01,860
healing emotionally Cynthia C says is it

464
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,780
normal that we feel tired afterwards yes

465
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:06,000
yes

466
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:07,559
for a bunch of people that's definitely

467
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,880
gonna happen

468
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:10,880
doing some garlic here

469
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:13,860
[Music]

470
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,539
guys remember what it was I always say

471
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:17,340
about garlic when you see me crush it by

472
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:19,200
hand like that or you see a chef out

473
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:20,880
there crush it by hand like that

474
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,559
you have to have the blade facing out

475
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,140
you can't have a blade facing in When

476
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:27,240
you crush garlic like that

477
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:29,160
burning around town says there was less

478
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:33,179
Tech issues than last time though laugh

479
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:35,820

actually a thousand percent correct how

482
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:43,740
about a hundred thousand percent correct

483
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:46,620
we improved

484
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:48,900

what a smell garlic has isn't it

503
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:42,240
something else

504
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:44,820
I Saw The Light Deanna says

505
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,679

00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:48,780
I get goosebumps

I had chills

508
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:53,900
when I just read that just now I Saw the

509
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,900
Light

510
00:21:54,539 --> 00:22:01,140
we stuffed the stuff down we stuff it

511
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:04,440
deep inside hello I'm living my life oh

512
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:07,080
you just betrayed me crap I'm hurting

513
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:09,179
for a few weeks or months but I have to

514
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:11,100
move forward with my life so I'll pick

515
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:13,140
up my feet and I'll keep on moving

516
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:15,840
forward and I'm gonna have to stuff that

517
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:17,880
betrayal injury down deep inside walking

518
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,919
around and going on meet somebody else

519
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:22,980
or something happens hello how are you

520
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:25,980
oh you just broke my trust what the heck

521
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:27,840
it hurts hurts really bad but I have to

522
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:31,020
move forward I'm going to stuff it down

523
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,820
deep inside let me bury it down hello I

524
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:35,340
keep on moving on with my life I come

525
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:38,220
across something else like what why did

526
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:40,440
that happen hey that's unfair I'm not

527
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:42,659
validated you misunderstood me I stuff

528
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:45,140
it down deep inside because you got to

529
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:45,140
move forward

530
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:50,039
and then it sits there and it sits there

531
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:53,100
and it percolates and it percolates and

532
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:57,600
it grows and it turns it and it festers

533
00:22:53,100 --> 00:23:00,419
and festers over time and then

534
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,980
we're running around doing self-help

535
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:04,080
I'm trying this I'm trying that I'm

536
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:05,580
trying that I'm trying this but it keeps

537
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,260
on coming back the patterns keep on

538
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:08,820
coming back I try to do this I do this

539
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,260
meditation I go here I go to yoga class

540
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:12,659
I go wherever I'm doing well that's

541
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:15,120
great but it still comes back I still

542
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:18,600
have all the patterns coming back

543
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:20,400
and so what I love about the light blast

544
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,799
is it's different than anything else

545
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,440
because it's not man-made down here it's

546
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:28,799
not controlled by man it's not

547
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:31,080
controlled by time or space it's not

548
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:34,039
controlled by law it's not controlled by

549
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:37,799
Nature it's not controlled by physics

550
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:39,480
nature can be cruel nature can control

551
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:42,740
stuff

552
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:44,640
physics nature

553
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:46,980
controls things

554
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,140
we need light that's on the Angelic

555
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:53,659
realm there's no control

556
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:53,659
there's no earthly control

557
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:00,600
and what the light blast is it's not

558
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:03,240
about that the light blast is separate

559
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:07,440
from that it's out of the Earthly chaos

560
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:10,320
it's not involved with the Earthly chaos

561
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:12,780
that's entirely different

562
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,580
and so we need that kind of light when

563
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:16,440
we're all built up inside with

564
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:18,539
everything stuffed down in us to hurt

565
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:20,700
the Betrayal the broken trust all the

566
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:22,620
pain and suffering all the losses the

567
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:24,720
heartache all the different things we go

568
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:27,179
through the validation issues because

569
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,640
we've been not validated because we've

570
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:32,460
had trust broken because we're we're

571
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:34,500
taking advantage of or we're mistreated

572
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:36,659
or we're Gaslight or whatever you want

573
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:39,299
to call it there's so much hurt and then

574
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:40,919
we need a light that's not controlled by

575
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:44,340
law

576
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:46,679
govern here on planet mess we need a

577
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:49,320
light that's away from that comes from

578
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:50,820
above and you believe in God if you

579
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,500
believe in God that's where the light

580
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:54,659
comes from way up there if you believe

581
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:56,159
in the universe then it comes from there

582
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:57,960
if you believe in a Creator if you

583
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,900
believe in everybody has different

584
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:03,840
beliefs but the light is there

585
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:05,940
Alicia M this was my second light blast

586
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,159
that I felt so clear this second time

587
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:10,440
around I didn't feel like getting stuck

588
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:13,320
like I did last time which I want to say

589
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:15,240
to people once you've had a light blast

590
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:18,919
before

591
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,919
once you've had one

592
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:24,480
things can be different when you get

593
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:26,700
another light blast

594
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,380
and that's all incredible all in its own

595
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:30,360
things can be so much different when you

596
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:33,600
get another late blast

597
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:36,539
cold white spring said are you tired

598
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:39,200
cold white spring mayor you asking me if

599
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:39,200
I'm tired

600
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:48,020
the mm who burns a candle at five

601
00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:48,020
different ends

602
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:57,440
okay we're making the healing broth

603
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,440
right now

604
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,640
foreign

605
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:10,200
yeah I'm tired

606
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:10,980
because the light blast is not easy on

607
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,940
me

608
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:17,460
all right but I still

609
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:19,860
feel

610
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:22,200
a lot of the incredible effects

611
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:24,539
what happens is that

612
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:26,100
it is tiring on me

613
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:29,340
but

614
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:32,880
in a good way because I know I'm being

615
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:35,520
used as a conduit and that's the that's

616
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,559
what's tiring

617
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,460
right because I'm being used as the

618
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:41,480
conduit

619
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,480
the messenger

620
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:46,500
facilitated right so because of that

621
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:49,320
it's tiring yes

622
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:50,460
but I have no complaints

623
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,440
because

624
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:55,020
on the flip side

625
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:57,539
I get some light

626
00:26:55,020 --> 00:27:00,659
which is incredible

627
00:26:57,539 --> 00:27:03,179
and I feel so good because of it and on

628
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:05,340
the flip side the most important

629
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:07,380
which isn't about me anymore like the

630
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:09,659
most important is you guys getting

631
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:11,039
what you need a mattress service I want

632
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:13,020
to be at your service and that's the

633
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:15,720
critical part is you guys getting what

634
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:17,820
you need and that's the part that

635
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:20,400
matters to me because I'm at your

636
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:22,980
service that's the whole point

637
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:25,380
if I have to be the conductor if I have

638
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:28,140
to be the conduit and the conductor so

639
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:29,880
be it that's fine if it tires me out a

640
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:31,140
little bit fine if it targets me out a

641
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,820
lot fine

642
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:34,380
if it puts me in shock for a little bit

643
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:36,299
fine

644
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:38,640
but it's well worth it when I know you

645
00:27:36,299 --> 00:27:40,940
guys get what you need and I'm at your

646
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,940
service

647
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:47,760
and then I bounce back after being the

648
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:49,980
conduit in the conductor I bounce back

649
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:53,220
after being the messenger

650
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:55,320
and I feel the effects

651
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:57,900
of the light

652
00:27:55,320 --> 00:28:00,000
this is coming out incredible by the way

653
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:02,039
got hot pepper in here I got parsley in

654
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:06,620
here I got celery in here I got Tomatoes

655
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:06,620
I got carrots and I forgot the onions

656
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:13,380
I have an onion right here

657
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:15,690
oh

658
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:18,880
gonna get tears in the eyes

659
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:18,880
[Music]

660
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:23,520
we don't edit these These are live right

661
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,500
here I'm live in the moment I just want

662
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:29,480
you to know what's happening inside our

663
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:29,480
bodies mm sugar plum masks

664
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:36,059
hurt

665
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:38,039
takes up space

666
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:39,840
hurt from betrayal and broken trust in

667
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:41,820
Old Wounds going all the way back from

668
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,100
relationships to just different things

669
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:46,620
that have happened in life take up space

670
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:49,080
and then we've run around trying to

671
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:50,880
actually soothe ourselves and we get in

672
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:52,559
trouble we get into addictions we get

673
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,600
into self-destructive patterns we get

674
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:56,820
into everything we jump into self-help

675
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:59,640
we look for help we get we do all these

676
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:02,520
things we say we see we seek out therapy

677
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:04,559
everything we do right psychiatrists

678
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:06,900
therapists

679
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:11,100
we seek out therapy

680
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:14,940
because we're trying to fix it right

681
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:17,159
but those wounds take up space

682
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:19,679
they take up brain space they take up

683
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:22,320
Soul Space they take up

684
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:25,080
Spirit heart soul space

685
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:27,419
Mind Body however you want to call it it

686
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:29,340
takes up space so if you want to ask the

687
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:33,539
question what is happening

688
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:35,580
in our bodies mm start with

689
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:36,720
what the light blast does is it opens up

690
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:38,940
new space

691
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,100
inside of us inside our soul inside of

692
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:43,220
our body inside of our spirit inside of

693
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,220
us

694
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:49,980
it it actually

695
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:53,880
is extracting that Venom and that poison

696
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:55,440
right that old hurt and then when that

697
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,480
leaves

698
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,039
you got space

699
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,419
do you ever have a really cluttered

700
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,860
house did you ever have a cluttered

701
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:03,779
apartment do you ever have a cluttered

702
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:07,200
closet because you ever have anything

703
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:09,659
that was so cluttered right

704
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:12,919
your car is cluttered what about your

705
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:12,919
car is your car cluttered

706
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:18,000
you ever you ever drive a car that's

707
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,740
filled with so much stuff there's

708
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,820
garbage on the floors did you ever do

709
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:22,799
that you're like maybe you're somebody

710
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:24,299
that never happened to you there there

711
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:25,919
isn't a bunch of garbage on the floor

712
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:27,539
you don't have boxes you don't have

713
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:30,720
stuff I know people they have to live

714
00:30:27,539 --> 00:30:32,820
out of their cars practically and

715
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:35,720
their cars are just taking up there's no

716
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:35,720
space in their car

717
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:40,559
what happens when you clean that car up

718
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:42,059
and you get rid of all that stuff and

719
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:43,440
you organize it and you get it out and

720
00:30:42,059 --> 00:30:45,480
you throw out a lot of bunch of stuff

721
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,279
whether it's in a house an apartment

722
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:49,760
whether it's in a dwelling whether it's

723
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,760
in a car

724
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:58,100
it makes room for something else

725
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,100
makes room for something else

726
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:05,520
when you actually

727
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:07,260
are experiencing the removal of wounds

728
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:10,320
that shouldn't sit there and fester

729
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:13,260
forever year after year of 20 years 30

730
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:16,260
years when you remove those

731
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:19,220
what happens you guys

732
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:19,220
space opens up

733
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:26,100
and then things are possible an ignition

734
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:28,140
igniting the healing process

735
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,919

like because I understand

806
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:35,399

and got very emotional

810
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:45,320
then started crying thanks to Spirit of

00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:45,320

that

815
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:00,260
and uh kind of gets me choked up because

816
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:07,880
okay so got a comment here

817
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,119
um the light blast I signed up used a

818
00:35:11,339 --> 00:35:15,720
link

819
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:17,579
I signed up before nine o'clock CST this

820
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:19,560
morning and nothing

821
00:35:17,579 --> 00:35:21,660
I had check telegram for updates and the

822
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:23,960
final update was not clear that you were

823
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,960
starting

824
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:28,859
and no indication that it had finished I

825
00:35:26,339 --> 00:35:31,200
finally logged off after 10 20. this is

826
00:35:28,859 --> 00:35:33,599
breaking my heart as we as as I'm

827
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:36,000
speaking

828
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:38,640
this was a waste of my time and you seem

829
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:42,420
to have no consideration for others

830
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:44,640
look I know you're upset I I really do

831
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:46,680
feel bad that something went wrong there

832
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,660
I appreciate you having this service but

833
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:51,000
if you can't consistently deliver you

834
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:54,119
need to Pivot and find a new method

835
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:56,579
Instagram live allows way more people

836
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:58,680
why don't you just go live instead of

837
00:35:56,579 --> 00:36:00,960
whatever you are using that I didn't get

838
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:03,119
to take part in my partner will be

839
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:06,180
throwing your books out

840
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:08,880
since he is so disappointed this late

841
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:11,520
blast was a joke and apparently it's on

842
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:14,119
me and everyone else that didn't get to

843
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,119
join okay

844
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:20,099
please I just want to say something all

845
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:23,280
right first of all it kills me that

846
00:36:20,099 --> 00:36:26,220
you're upset and that's your that your

847
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:29,160
partner is upset first of all okay and

848
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:31,380
here's what happened okay

849
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:33,599
it takes a lot of technology to harness

850
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:35,640
this what we're doing

851
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:37,980
and a hundred and ten thousand people

852
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:39,599
got on because people share the link

853
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:41,940
and they're not supposed to share the

854
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:44,579
link and a lot of people share the link

855
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:46,020
and so glitches happen with the

856
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:47,940
technology

857
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:49,520
right and

858
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:52,740
Instagram

859
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:54,720
lives they have a cap on me

860
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:56,280
and they usually only let me have five

861
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:59,400
six seven hundred people when I used to

862
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:01,680
have six to ten thousand people

863
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:03,420
um per live I used to get six seven

864
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:05,220
eight ten thousand people every time I

865
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:07,079
went live on Instagram but they they

866
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:09,119
tapped me

867
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:11,940
and so they did that and they usually

868
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:13,619
keep me around six seven hundred or if

869
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:16,800
I'm lucky they'll let me have like

870
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:19,380
fourteen hundred like out of nowhere one

871
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,720
day but they won't let anybody else go

872
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:24,180
on they get kicked off

873
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:28,400
so I can't use IG

874
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:28,400
right so I'm just letting you know I'm

875
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:35,760
just you know so you understand

876
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,859
but

877
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,359
I feel for you I'm sorry if you're gonna

878
00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:41,460
throw the books out

879
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:44,760
and I'm sorry that like you're really

880
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:48,800
upset and I and

881
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,800
if I were you I would be mad too

882
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:54,060
and that's how I feel and there are a

883
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:55,980
lot of people that couldn't log on and

884
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:59,220
something went wrong it was either on

885
00:37:55,980 --> 00:38:01,500
their system or it was because of of our

886
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:03,540
system but people share the link and we

887
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:06,839
had 110 000 people on when there was

888
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:09,420
only supposed to be 33 000 people and it

889
00:38:06,839 --> 00:38:13,380
is a free event and I'm not trying to

890
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:16,920
cry or anything about stuff but to put

891
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:18,720
this event on it costs me thousands and

892
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:21,000
thousands of dollars

893
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:23,700
and so I don't charge like a hundred

894
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:26,400
dollars for a sign up a hundred dollars

895
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:28,740
for a ticket for each person

896
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:31,020
I don't do that there's no charge

897
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:33,359
and it but yet it cost me tens of

898
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:35,760
thousands of dollars to actually run and

899
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:37,980
and put on and pay my team and we work

900
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,420
on it for weeks

901
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:43,520
um including the Technologies were

902
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:43,520
expensive to use for that anyway

903
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:50,359
so I just want to be of service so what

904
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:50,359
I do is is

905
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:55,200
what I like to like what I love to do is

906
00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:57,359
give to the community

907
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:59,160
and not empty their pockets

908
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:00,359
that's what I've always done all these

909
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:02,820
years

910
00:39:00,359 --> 00:39:05,400
I'm the only one out there to whatever

911
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:07,800
they call it my caliber that's what PR

912
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:09,780
people will say my caliber up there in

913
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:11,520
the health and healing world

914
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:14,579
then I hate hearing that and when they

915
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:16,320
say I'm the only one that doesn't do

916
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:18,359
subscription fees for the website

917
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:20,339
programs and classes and courses and

918
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:22,200
certifications all these things that

919
00:39:20,339 --> 00:39:23,760
just make tons and tons of money to make

920
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:27,240
me a billionaire

921
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:29,700
also did you turn on the audio button on

922
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:32,160
the bottom left if you did not that is

923
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:34,800
another reason you have no sound for

924
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:37,380
people who didn't have sound so

925
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:40,099
onions are there are cooking

926
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:40,099
oh

927
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,800
so anyway

928
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:48,359
but I wanted to re I saw that comment

929
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,700
come up and I said look I want to

930
00:39:48,359 --> 00:39:54,750
address it we put instructions on the

931
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:56,579
screen and above the video by the way

932
00:39:54,750 --> 00:40:00,560
[Music]

933
00:39:56,579 --> 00:40:00,560
I'm hoping Dr Nesbitt stops by

934
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:04,700
do you guys remember Dr Nesbitt

935
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:12,180
does anybody remember Dr Nesbitt

936
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:13,980
Dr Nesbitt signed up for the light blast

937
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:15,960
and he got in

938
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:18,240
I get a beating no matter what I do by

939
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:21,660
the way you guys I get a beating

940
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:23,940
I get whipping I get a beating

941
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:26,420
I get the crap beat out of me no matter

942
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:26,420
what I do

943
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:32,060
and then of course you know

944
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:36,980
there are enough hate groups out there

945
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,980
that don't like me

946
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:43,560
I'm grateful too for you guys I just saw

947
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:45,920
that you're so grateful I'm grateful for

948
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,920
you too

949
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:52,140
all storms pass coaching I see that

950
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,540
right there

951
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:58,320
over there on YouTube

952
00:40:54,540 --> 00:41:00,960
I also felt the light stop in my chest

953
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:03,720
the first blast with the first blast

954
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:06,060
after that one I felt really

955
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:08,599
uncomfortable in my body can't explain

956
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:08,599
it

957
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:14,900
but felt a full release after the last

958
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,900
blast

959
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:20,700
and and you guys remember

960
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:23,880
it was like

961
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:27,720
the intensity was getting increased

962
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:30,480
so SSC would say increasing

963
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:32,720
and then I would get kind of like

964
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:35,700
they get kind of a little scared right

965
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:38,400
because I know that so much is going to

966
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:39,540
be flying out of people so much hurt and

967
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,180
so many things that have been trapped

968
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:45,300
there for so long and print it

969
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:47,880
like imprinted within us like imprint it

970
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:48,960
within us so much gets imprinted and

971
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:51,359
trapped

972
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,980
and so on Spirit of compassion Spirit of

973
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:55,500
compassion doesn't start out on the

974
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:57,300
first blast is the most powerful

975
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:59,339
because

976
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:01,619
it's

977
00:41:59,339 --> 00:42:04,260
graduate

978
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:07,619
because it has to be that way

979
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:09,720
because there are people with a lot less

980
00:42:07,619 --> 00:42:11,280
wounds

981
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:13,380
but there are a lot of people with so

982
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:16,560
much going on that it can't be full

983
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:18,420
power on the very first

984
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:21,420
blast

985
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:23,700
because that's like

986
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:27,800
pavement you know like for real it's

987
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:27,800
hitting the road real hard

988
00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:36,540
with the second length glass Janet says

989
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:41,660
with the second light blast I had

990
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:41,660
tingles in my arms and legs but it was

991
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:49,859
Technology's going crazy today but it

992
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:52,380
was the release of tears that surprised

993
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:55,260
me and I have just woken up from a

994
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:57,359
two-hour nap something I never do

995
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:58,859
I am feeling mellow and so thankful for

996
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:01,020
this opportunity and Janet what's going

997
00:42:58,859 --> 00:43:04,740
to happen is that's not where it stops

998
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:05,880
the healing with the light blast it

999
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:09,079

1000
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:09,079

1059
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:59,460

1061
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:02,060

1063
00:46:07,079 --> 00:46:10,680

can't say enough about it about how

1095
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:15,140
incredible of a day it is

1096
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,140

00:48:17,099 --> 00:48:19,700
you guys

1098
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:25,619
Dr Nesbitt

1099
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:27,119
got a label ass today

1100
00:48:25,619 --> 00:48:29,099
Dr Elizabeth what did you think about

1101
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:31,859
the lay blast

1102
00:48:29,099 --> 00:48:34,140
Dr Nesbitt says that he got the late

1103
00:48:31,859 --> 00:48:37,319
blast when he was in surgery

1104
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:39,540
he was doing an open heart surgery

1105
00:48:37,319 --> 00:48:42,619
and

1106
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:45,800
he said it was his best day in surgery

1107
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:45,800
in years

1108
00:48:49,859 --> 00:48:54,599
I need people to know that

1109
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:55,980
if for some reason you couldn't log on

1110
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:58,560
or anything

1111
00:48:55,980 --> 00:49:02,579
I will do everything I can

1112
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:04,680
in Technology power and my team to try

1113
00:49:02,579 --> 00:49:06,000
to make sure the next light Blast has

1114
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:07,440
the least amount of glitches but like

1115
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,940
somebody said it was a lot better than

1116
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,540

00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:11,540
um

1119
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:17,460
um Dr nessman Dr Nesbitt said that he

1120
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:19,500
said that his surgery went better today

1121
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:21,359
than any other surgery he's done because

1122
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:23,280
he had the light blast during his

1123
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:25,560
surgery

1124
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:27,599
and he said he had less alcohol to drink

1125
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:30,839
after the surgery so he

1126
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:33,119
he sent down less shots of

1127
00:49:30,839 --> 00:49:35,520
of vodka

1128
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:36,240
and whiskey

1129
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,680
um

1130
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:39,960

1131
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:41,819

1134
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:49,859

1135
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:51,839

1136
00:49:49,859 --> 00:49:53,579
