00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:58,680
happens with a lot of people is they're

22
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:01,280
battling bloating constipation other

23
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,719
things too loose St not loose dos then

24
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,520
it's constipation then it's back or it's

25
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:09,320
just straight straight plain old

26
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:12,560
bloating and that's what it is so we're

27
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:14,960
talking about some cool stuff right here

28
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,600
now I know a lot of people they fight to

29
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,320
get their bloating down they get the

30
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,880
lymphatic drainage lymphatic massage

31
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,159
they get their stomachs worked on so

32
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,960
that's a big thing right now everybody

33
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,079
goes in and someone's working on their

34
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,079
stomach now they're using machines on

35
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:29,920
their stomachs right to try to get the

36
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:32,399
bloating down and then right when it's

37
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,600
it's like getting a new haircut okay you

38
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:38,119

49
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,360
thing you you go get your stomach worked

53
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:11,120
and you're like okay my stomach's down

54
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:14,280
and then you sip some water or you drink

55
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,319
something whatever that is and then boom

56
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,680
it's back for a lot of people or you

57
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,040
just start seeing it slowly coming back

58
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,000
then next day it's slowly coming back

59
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,720
Third Day fourth day you're bloated

60
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,360
again you got the distension you're

61
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:29,360
stuck you're back to where you were so

62
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,040
let's talk about like true true causes

63
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:35,519
if you're fighting any kind of bloating

64
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:38,200
at all any kind of bloating at all you

65
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,599
got to go to your liver liver that's

66
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:43,040
right doesn't mean eat liver you don't

67
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:44,760
want to eat liver to fix your bloating

68
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,640
because that's not going to fix it

69
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,280
because people talk about that stuff too

70
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,920
they'll try anything it's all about

71
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:53,680
biohacks out there non-stop but your

72
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,319
liver something's going on stagnant

73
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,879
sluggish

74
00:02:55,319 --> 00:03:01,040
liver stagnant sluggish liver why is it

75
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,560
stagnant why is it slug sluggish from a

76
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,239
lot of different things you guys I'm in

77
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,319
Liver Rescue right now I'm just looking

78
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:09,599
through here and talking about some cool

79
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:12,000
stuff we're going to talk about this so

80
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:15,959
what happens with people is their liver

81
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,640
gets filled up and that filters stuffed

82
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:21,400
and clogged and then it starts to become

83
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,799
dysfunctional and then it doesn't

84
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,599
produce the bile it needs to produce to

85
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:30,000
break down your

86
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:34,360
fats and then it starts to weaken and

87
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,799
it's over 2,000 chemical functions start

88
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,840
to become

89
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:41,599
dysfunctional and so now your liver is

90
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:44,640
only running on 700 chemical functions

91
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,640
now your liver is only running on 900

92
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,720
chemical

93
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:51,680
functions now your liver is only running

94
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:54,920
on 300 chemical functions because your

95
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:58,480
liver is stagnant and sluggish and it's

96
00:03:54,920 --> 00:04:01,879
stuck and it's overburdened and over

97
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:04,239
tired and the the 2,000 plus chemical

98
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:06,599
functions that your liver does to keep

99
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:10,120
you healthy keep you alive keep your

100
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:11,519
skin looking good keep you doing good

101
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,159
all that's

102
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:17,000
diminishing and then over time you get a

103
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,560
fatty liver without even realizing it

104
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,440
people will get a fatty liver and then

105
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:25,919
your A1C goes up and then your blood

106
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,520
sugar is all over the place so if you're

107
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,759
somebody that's dealing with blood sugar

108
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,520
problems and that's what you're living

109
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:33,120
with and you're always trying to like

110
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,240
balance your blood sugar you're always

111
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,160
trying to figure out that magic

112
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:41,160
combination well let me this let me eat

113
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,440
that I'm going to have salmon with a

114
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:46,560
grapefruit I'm going to have a piece of

115
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,160
meat with a celery stick I'm going to

116
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,800
have something with something I'm going

117
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,120
to have sushi with an orange I'm going

118
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,520
to do whatever it is that you're I'm

119
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,720
going to have nuts and seeds with

120
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,320
raisins whatever you're trying to do to

121
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,280
balance that that blood sugar problem a

122
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,720
lot of people are like I eat hummus to

123
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,400
try to balance it I eat beans I eat

124
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,120
grains I eat fruit I eat vegetables

125
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,560
everybody's just fighting to balance

126
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,600
their blood sugar out there what they

127
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,240
don't

128
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:19,120
realize is they're battling a problem

129
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,479
much bigger than what it seems it's not

130
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,160
just about

131
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:25,240
glucose it's about a liver becoming

132
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,400
dysfunctional so one of the things that

133
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:30,360
happens when your liver becomes

134
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:33,560
dysfunctional is your glucose storage

135
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:36,400
diminishes and starts to disappear your

136
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:40,360
glucose storage so right here in your

137
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:42,120
liver okay every time you eat something

138
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,160
that has any kind of carbohydrate any

139
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,880
kind of

140
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,840
glucose say fructose and fruit it goes

141
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:50,400
into the liver and it helps to restore

142
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,639
the storage bin down in there so every

143
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,160
time you're eating something with a

144
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:55,800
carbohydrate because if you don't have a

145
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,800
carbohydrate if you don't have a sugar

146
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,840
if you don't have that fructose or

147
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:03,800
glucose you don't have that starch from

148
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:06,599
something what happens is you don't

149
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:09,560
refill all of your cells with needed

150
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:12,680
energy because our energy derives from

151
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:15,440
sugar our brain thrives and lives off of

152
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:18,039
sugar that's what our brain lives off of

153
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:22,319
you take sugar away from our brain it

154
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:27,000
dies in 10 seconds you take sugar away

155
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:29,720
from the brain cells start to die in 5

156
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,800
seconds and it just goes from there like

157
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:35,560
as the seconds are counting down the

158
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:37,919
brain starts to die so sugar and glucose

159
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,800
needs to store into the liver so that

160
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:43,759
your liver is releasing little bits of

161
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,880
it keeping your blood sugar balanced you

162
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,039
hear what I'm going right here how

163
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:50,840
important this is keeping your blood

164
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:54,599
sugar balanced your liver is like your

165
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:56,720
blood sugar balancer right there people

166
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:58,879
don't know that instead they're just

167
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,360
they're trying to master a food they go

168
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:03,039
and buy a hack foods and they're trying

169
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,080
like I'm trying to eat this and this and

170
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:07,360
at 12:00 I'm eating this and this and at

171
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:09,280
1:00 I'm eating this and this and

172
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,319
they're trying to figure out how to keep

173
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,840
their blood sugar their hypoglycemia

174
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:15,879
their hypoglycemia blood sugar spikes

175
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,080
they're keeping monitors on themselves

176
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:18,639
they're all freaked out about their

177
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,919
blood sugar they don't know what's going

178
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:24,199
on and what's really happening deep down

179
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:27,280
inside is you got a tired liver that

180
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:30,680
that doesn't have a glucose storage bin

181
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:33,599
anymore or the delivers overburdened

182
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:37,160
stagnant sluggish and it's not

183
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:40,240
functioning good enough to release

184
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:42,560
glucose properly it's not functioning

185
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,479
good enough to be able to release spurts

186
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:48,319
of that glucose to keep you strong so

187
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:51,000
you're not hitting the ground so you're

188
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:53,560
not you know hitting the wall so you can

189
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,159
function and live your life so your

190
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:59,280
liver needs to actually control that

191
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:01,479
glucose release and it sends out glucose

192
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,000
ose right into the bloodstream so that

193
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:05,400
you're stable so what happens is people

194
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,039
walk around they think they have the

195
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,479
worst blood sugar problems because it's

196
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,840
a blood sugar problem they're like it's

197
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:13,680
my pancreas what's going on am I

198
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:16,479
pre-diabetic what do I have going on

199
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,840
meanwhile it's the liver it's tired it's

200
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,080
beaten down it's problematic it's

201
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:23,599
stagnant it's

202
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:26,400
sluggish and that's what's going on so I

203
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:28,400
want everybody to know that the liver

204
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,840
plays a role in so much of your health

205
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,519
over 2,000 in chemical functions and

206
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:35,279
when it get stagnant and sluggish

207
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:38,120
everything starts going wrong you start

208
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:40,240
bloating you might get some

209
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,519
constipation you might get all kinds of

210
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,320
other issues along with it and then

211
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:47,160
there's the adrenaline so let's get the

212
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,279
adrenals out for a little bit that's

213
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:51,000
another thing that happens we run on a

214
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:53,279
high all the time we're always trying to

215
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
get high everybody's out there trying to

216
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:57,440
get high they're living off of

217
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,880
adrenaline they're running on adrenaline

218
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:03,560
every day and then they're burning out

219
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,440
their adrenals every day adrenaline's

220
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,600
being released and that adrenaline gets

221
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,480
absorbed into the liver and starts to

222
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,079
absorb into the liver and it tires the

223
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:15,079
liver out another reason why people have

224
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:18,440
stagnant sluggish liver that leads to

225
00:09:15,079 --> 00:09:21,040
bloating is because their adrenals have

226
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,800
released so much adrenaline so so many

227
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,680
people are on caffeine every day they're

228
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,760
on their coffee and their adrenals are

229
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:30,160
just flooding everywhere

230
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:32,760
like more caffeine the adrenals are just

231
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:36,480
releasing it out right more matcha tea

232
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:38,360
more coffee more cacao more caffeine and

233
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,880
it's just like stimulant stimulant and

234
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,040
the adrenals are just flooding and

235
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,079
flooding and

236
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,560
flooding that's not the only time the

237
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:46,440
adrenals are flooding when we're on a

238
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,360
really high fat diet all the time we're

239
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,440
eating fats everywhere whether you're

240
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:54,160
plant-based you're vegan whether you're

241
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,360
you know vegetarian whether you're just

242
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,800
animal protein a lot of people they're

243
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,959
on such high fat diets there's so much

244
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,800
fat in their diet that they're on an

245
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,880
adrenaline High because the fats get

246
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,760
into the bloodstream then your body does

247
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,800
this emergency situation where it

248
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:11,680
releases adrenaline to thin out the fats

249
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,600
inside the bloodstream so you don't have

250
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,320
a heart

251
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,079
attack and so all that adrenaline high

252
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:20,760
is happening with people they're walking

253
00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:23,760
around stimulated all the time and so

254
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:25,920
it's important it's important to heal

255
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,399
the liver work on healing the liver

256
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:32,120
restoring the liver so many people's

257
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:33,920
problems are are the liver okay eczema

258
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,279
psoriasis

259
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,880
dermatitis the liver plays a role in

260
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:39,639
that right there any skin problems you

261
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,320
don't

262
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:44,160
like any kind of different dark spots on

263
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,680
your skin all kinds of different skin

264
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,839
issues the liver plays a role right

265
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:51,079
there

266
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:54,000
bloating yes even constipation other

267
00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:55,920
digestive trouble the liver plays a role

268
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,519
right there so let's move into it a

269
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:03,120
little deeper okay one of your liver's

270
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:06,519
most important jobs is to disperse bile

271
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:09,399
and break down fat and if it doesn't

272
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:14,079
disperse enough bile guess what the fat

273
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:16,519
goes ran it ran it it sits in your gut

274
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,560
and it goes bad and it goes rancid and

275
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:20,440
it starts to harden up and it sits on

276
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,639
the walls of your intestinal tract and

277
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:25,839
your

278
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:29,040
gut the other role the liver

279
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:31,519
does is it actually makes it so your

280
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:34,519
stomach glands in your stomach stay

281
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:37,000
stronger so that they can create

282
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:39,880
hydrochloric acid and the hydrochloric

283
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,440
acid breaks down protein the weaker your

284
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:45,000
liver gets the less protein you break

285
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:47,920
down and then your protein ends up

286
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,519
rotting and putrifying and then you can

287
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:54,320
be stuck with all kinds of flatulent and

288
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:57,040
gas additionally tacked on to your

289
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,480
bloating so quick rundown stagnant

290
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,399
sluggish liver that's dysfunctional

291
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:04,600
that's not doing its 2,000 chemical

292
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:06,560
functions but instead it's doing 500

293
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:09,320
chemical functions or 400 chemical

294
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,160
functions it gets tired it can't

295
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:14,639
function as good as it needs to function

296
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:16,680
it gets hot it starts to heat up and

297
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,000
then it loses its ability to store

298
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:21,680
glucose so your blood sugar is all over

299
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,040
the map like this so when you got that

300
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:27,360
stagnant sluggish liver you guys your

301
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:30,320
glucose is all over the map and you're

302
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:33,639
just like everywhere it's like my A1C my

303
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:36,600
A1C where's my glucose I'm spiking I'm

304
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:39,839
lowering I'm spiking I'm crashing the

305
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:42,320
liver plays a huge role in all of that

306
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,040
the other thing hydrochloric acid the

307
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,320
liver keeps your stomach glands and

308
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:48,680
stomach stronger if the liver's strong

309
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,560
it keeps your stomach stronger your

310
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:54,399
glands in your stomach stronger

311
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:58,040
producing higher quality quantities of

312
00:12:54,399 --> 00:13:00,040
HCL which really helps someone actually

313
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,360
break down proteins you guys I see a lot

314
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:04,160
of people asking me what I'm talking

315
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,399

book for cleansing the liver

326
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,760
Okay so let's go into a little deeper

327
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,240
into it we're going to cover some other

328
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,560
stuff all around this so it's critical

329
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,160
to know what's going on inside your body

330
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,959
if you don't know what's happening

331
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,079
inside your body you're going to be

332
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:45,519
running around like a chicken with your

333
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:48,279
head cut off trying to biohack always

334
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:51,839
looking for an answer being stuck in the

335
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:53,440
mud but when you know what's going on

336
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,920
and why you're feeling like you do why

337
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,040
you're struggling like you do and you

338
00:13:54,920 --> 00:14:00,160
know why things can change you can turn

339
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,880
things around you you can heal you can

340
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:05,519
move forward and that's critical to know

341
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:08,839
so back to the liver a little bit

342
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:11,519
keeping a strong liver makes it so your

343
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:14,320
HCL is produced and stays strong and

344
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:16,160
breaks down your protein critical or

345
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,920
your protein will sit there and rot in

346
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:22,880
your gut and you'll have protein gut rot

347
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:25,519
inside your gut where it'll purify and

348
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:28,440
release ammonia and

349
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:32,959
gases and then you want your liver to be

350
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:35,560
strong to produce strong ample bile so

351
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:37,360
the bile can break down and disperse the

352
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:41,120
fats that you're eating when you do eat

353
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:43,920
fat in your food a weak liver means the

354
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:47,920
bile will actually go

355
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:50,920
rancid with the fats your own bile and

356
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:53,360
the fats together will actually join

357
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,279
together and purify and all go ran it

358
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,720
because your bile wasn't even strong

359
00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:02,560
enough to break down the fat so your

360
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:04,639
bile even lost its shelf life people

361
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:07,959
with weak livers they end up getting a

362
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:10,880
fatty liver liver starts to get toxic

363
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:12,880
and fat and when the liver is in that

364
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,880
condition all these things can go wrong

365
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,320
as

366
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,680
well another thing with the liver is

367
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:22,759
cholesterol readings when you go and get

368
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:24,519
your blood test liver problems mean

369
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:27,240
cholesterol

370
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:30,240
problems right there on its own high

371
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:32,600
blood pressure liver problems unless

372
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,399
there's a blockage somewhere and even

373
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,120
then if there's a blockage somewhere

374
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,480
with high blood pressure or heart

375
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:41,360
problems it starts originally from the

376
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,839
liver all the way back in years before

377
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,959
it starts with the liver keep that in

378
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:49,360
mind so I don't talk about it enough

379
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:52,079
lately but in order to stay healthy we

380
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:55,720
have to keep our livers healthy and

381
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:58,160
strong so we can stay healthy so

382
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:02,800
cleansing the liver strengthening it and

383
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:03,839
bringing it back is key it's critical

384
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,759
for

385
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,440
healing back to the high that

386
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:11,120
everybody's on everybody's chasing a

387
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:13,440
high said this before people love to

388
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,560
chase highs and when we Chase highs and

389
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:19,199
we're stimulated or jacked up on our own

390
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:21,880
adrenaline we weaken our liver even more

391
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:25,079
Liver Rescue is a legendary it has

392
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:27,560
changed the health of people worldwide

393
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:29,279
it's changed the medical system it's

394
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,959
changed the health system system

395
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,000
influencers every day all around the

396
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:36,040
world including on podcasts or talking

397
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,440
about information in Liver Rescue It is

398
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:40,399
it this is the book that brought liver

399
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,639
information to the world no one's ever

400
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,560
even heard

401
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:47,759
before this book right here is worth a

402
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:52,199
read to gain control and empowerment on

403
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:55,480
your health let's go into it a little

404
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:55,480
deeper all

405
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,600
right so you're eating whatever you

406
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,640
choose to

407
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,760
eat you're bloating from

408
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,280
it so you might be somebody that's

409
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:11,360
intermittent fasting maybe you're

410
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:14,160
holding back food maybe you did a water

411
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:18,439
fast and your water fast was like seven

412
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:20,160
days or 10 days or 14 days or 21 days

413
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:22,640
and you did it water fast and your

414
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,640
bloating went down and you're proud of

415
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,839
yourself cuz your bloating went

416
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,079
down and maybe you just you're somebody

417
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:29,280
who's intermittent fasting you're

418
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,120
probably yourself cuz you're bloating

419
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,679
went down or maybe you're somebody that

420
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,280
just didn't eat much for a few days and

421
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,960
you're getting lymphatic drainage and

422
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,360
you're getting your stomach worked on

423
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,919
and they're working on you and they're

424
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:43,200
even using machines on your abdomen

425
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:46,080
abdominal machines to try to push all

426
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:49,799
the fluid out of your

427
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:53,320
skin and then the next day it's back you

428
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:56,520
end your water cleanse it's back you end

429
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:59,039
your intermittent fasting moments it's

430
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:00,880
back you end you know you're done with

431
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:04,400
your lymphatic drainage after a little

432
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:08,280
while it's back there it is your

433
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:12,080
bloating is back what the heck is going

434
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:13,480
on that's what has to be addressed or

435
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:17,880
it's just a

436
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:20,000
game it's a charade it's about managing

437
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:23,840
now it's important to manage you that's

438
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,280
what you have to do if you know those

439
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:29,360
inner secrets about yourself where you

440
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:31,919
can manage just right to try to keep

441
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,960
balance to keep the bloating down to

442
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,840
keep the constipation at Bay if that's

443
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,080
something you have or even the IBS or

444
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,240
anything else around it if you have a

445
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,480
secret

446
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:44,880
recipe and you're using that secret

447
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:47,240
recipe then then that's great but you're

448
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,080
also managing and

449
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:52,600
micromanaging but you're not getting

450
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:55,400
down to the root to the root which is

451
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:57,799
critical and that's a big deal we want

452
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:00,720
to get down to the root so let's hit

453
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:03,480
ammonia gas what happens with everybody

454
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,280
okay people get stitches they get cramps

455
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,960
they get all kinds of problems with that

456
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:10,080
they get gastritis they can get cramps

457
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:13,320
and stitches that run all the way up to

458
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:15,919
their neck all the way up to their neck

459
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:18,159
and even the top of their throat their

460
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,919
shoulder people can have gastric cramps

461
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:22,480
and gastric problems where they're

462
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,159
bellowed over they're hanging on a couch

463
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,840
they're in their bed they're on the

464
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:27,440
floor they're trying to move around

465
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,679
they're trying to do yoga positions

466
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,640
they're trying to let gas out that's

467
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:35,919
trapped and they're trying to get that

468
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:39,840
trapped gas out right but in that gas is

469
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:42,360
ammonia and ammonia is something that's

470
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:45,240
produced from a lot of things being

471
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:47,400
stagnant and sluggish in here ammonia is

472
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:50,320
produced

473
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:52,520
from foods that are actually putrifying

474
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,440
and not breaking down proteins that are

475
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:57,480
putrifying and not breaking down fats

476
00:19:54,440 --> 00:20:00,080
that are rancid and pathogens that want

477
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:02,880
to feed

478
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:05,760
on what's going on that isn't being

479
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:08,960
digested that's starting to rot

480
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:11,360
pathogens bacteria that's not good

481
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,360
bacteria and when that bacteria that's

482
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,799
not good bacteria is sitting here

483
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:18,799
swimming inside your small intestinal

484
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:23,480
tract and inside your colon your

485
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:27,640
Elum it's feeding on ranet

486
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:28,919
undigested ammonia gas filled putrified

487
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,919
protein

488
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:35,600
and rancid

489
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:37,080
fats so the bacteria is feeding and then

490
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:40,840
the gas in the

491
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:43,240
flatulence produced by that bacteria

492
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:46,039
along with the ammonia gas that's

493
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:49,440
actually cycling

494
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:51,679
through that gas becomes toxic where

495
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:55,960
you're getting a stitch now so you're

496
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:59,039
feeling a stitch like oh man or oh I got

497
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:01,240
to let that gas out I'm feeling a stitch

498
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:03,600
or I don't feel good or my stomach's

499
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:07,480
kind of blowing up

500
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:09,679
again and what it is it's toxic painful

501
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:12,279
gas you might be somebody that doesn't

502
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:14,720
have the painful gas because the

503
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:17,039
bacteria might be a different kind of

504
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,720
bacteria or you don't have a lot of bad

505
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:22,679
bacteria feeding off of things but you

506
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:24,520
still have rotting putrified protein and

507
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:27,320
rancid

508
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:30,760
fats all inside the intestinal tract and

509
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:32,120
the gut that's leeching out ammonia gas

510
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:34,559
and putrifying

511
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:38,000
and that's creating flatulence

512
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:39,760
flatulence and gases well so you have to

513
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,760
just you have to roll around on the

514
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,640
ground on the floor you have to move and

515
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,279
shift your body to try to release that

516
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:48,600
gas to get it out and you might be

517
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:50,640
somebody where the gas just streams out

518
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:53,240
every day like that and you might be

519
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,799
somebody where it's trapped and you have

520
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:59,039
inflammation inside the the intestinal

521
00:21:55,799 --> 00:22:01,120
tract from pathogens from pathogens

522
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:03,440
inside the intestinal tract and that

523
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,640
those pathogens have little spots in

524
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,600
here that are

525
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:10,320
inflamed and that inflammation makes it

526
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,600
so the gas gets stuck so let's go into

527
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,600
that a little bit I want to talk about

528
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,200
stuck gas because that's a big deal for

529
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,640
a lot of people right

530
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,679
there so when you're in small intestinal

531
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:24,440
tract you can have narrowings and you

532
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:26,279
can have distension and swellings so a

533
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:29,679
lot of people they small intestinal

534
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:32,120
tract okay has

535
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:34,000
inconsistencies where they're expanding

536
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:36,640
in some areas it's kind of like the

537
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,159
pipeline is expanding in certain

538
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:43,600
areas or Contracting in certain areas so

539
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:46,559
the gas isn't moving through properly so

540
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:49,799
it builds up in one area until it builds

541
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:52,200
up and then you move and then boom it

542
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:54,760
starts pushing through and pushing

543
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,440
through and that's what happens and

544
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:58,640
there's other people that have different

545
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:01,679
areas like their elium

546
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:04,400
so right here you know their Elum

547
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:07,559
problematic the gas is stuck there it's

548
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:10,159
inflamed the gas won't move through and

549
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:12,760
it's just stuck and it's in the right

550
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:14,760
area the right lower region and they're

551
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,799
always like this or they're in the

552
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,240
bathroom and they're trying to go to the

553
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:20,200
bathroom and they're always holding this

554
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:23,039
spot they feel that discomfort and

555
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:26,279
there's that kind of person too and what

556
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:29,200
these little in inflamed areas in this

557
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:32,919
in the small intestinal tract from from

558
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:35,440
bacteria in the lining in the wall or

559
00:23:32,919 --> 00:23:37,200
even viruses in the lining in the wall

560
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,640
they get trapped in

561
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:42,080
there and when they're trapped in there

562
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:44,960
and they're in that lining you get a

563
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:48,520
swelling and an inflammation and then

564
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:50,320
the gas heads down the pike and when it

565
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:53,440
hits that spot it gets stuck and it

566
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:55,240
blows up and now you're bloating so

567
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,960

bloating right there okay

617
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:03,080
okay so we're just going into this a

618
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:04,600
little bit a little deeper and deeper

619
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:08,640
it's important to know what's going on

620
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:10,720
inside your body it's critical okay Tera

621
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,880
says why can emotional stress trigger

622
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:18,320
bloating for some people emotional

623
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:21,240
stress for some people can trigger off

624
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:24,039
adrenaline okay and when the

625
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,679
adrenals start flooding because it's

626
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:28,000
emotional stress in the adrenals and

627
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:30,200
that adrenaline it can then fil are

628
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,120
right into the liver and the liver gets

629
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,080
stuck very stagnant in the moment if

630
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:36,720
it's already stagnant and that can kind

631
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,320
of short circuit the liver a little bit

632
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,000
a lot of people deal with that that's

633
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,360
one thing there's a bunch of things that

634
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,159
can happen though when we're under

635
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:47,200
emotional

636
00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:52,799
stress so so many people

637
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:56,200
have five or 10 pounds on them of

638
00:26:52,799 --> 00:27:00,080
bloating but yet it's not

639
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:02,559
fat so this is is interesting really

640
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:04,039
interesting that's why when someone does

641
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:06,120
something like they'll go and they'll do

642
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:08,640
say a water fast they go do a juice fast

643
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:11,760
or they'll go do

644
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:16,480
something well what happens is they have

645
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:20,399
like 10 to 15 PBS 5 lbs 20

646
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:24,080
lb 20 lbs of swelling of

647
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:27,240
fluid in their intestinal tract swelling

648
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:29,080
in their liver stagnant sluggish right

649
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:31,600
food F in their intestinal tract that

650
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:34,440
hasn't moved in a long

651
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:36,320
time gas and all kinds of different

652
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:38,720
fluid throughout their

653
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,480
system and they're bloating and what

654
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,559
happens is they're bloating from all of

655
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:46,880
that and then when they go and they do

656
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:49,720
any kind of cleanse or they stop eating

657
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:52,880
it starts to go down and they start

658
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:55,080
releasing it they release the some of

659
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,120
the old putrified stuff some of the food

660
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:59,360
out of their system some of the fluid

661
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:02,000
retention goes

662
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:05,760
down and then they notice that wait I'm

663
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:09,120
5 lb lighter I'm 10 lb

664
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:12,279
lighter but it wasn't 5 lbs of fat that

665
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:15,360
they just lost and it wasn't 10 lbs of

666
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:18,000
fat that they just lost they're now 5

667
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:20,320
PBS lighter 10 pounds lighter of

668
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,399
putrified stuff that's in their system

669
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:27,640
fluid retention

670
00:28:23,399 --> 00:28:30,200
pus stagnant sluggish fluid filled liver

671
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:33,200
and they stopped eating and it went

672
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:34,399
down or they didn't eat much that went

673
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,320
down a lot of people who are

674
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:38,080
intermittent fasting they go without

675
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,720
food and they're just on coffee all day

676
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,519
they're on stimulants all day they go

677
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,880
without food and they're noticing they

678
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:46,919
slim down a little bit but it doesn't

679
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:51,600
mean they're losing fat really quickly

680
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:54,279
or anything they're losing swelling and

681
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:56,080
bloting but we can't just do that we

682
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:57,960
have to do things where we take care of

683
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,679
ourselves and we eat every day and we're

684
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:02,919
doing things that are cleaning it up on

685
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:05,519
a daily basis and healing the stagnant

686
00:29:02,919 --> 00:29:07,919
sluggish liver to begin with so we're

687
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:09,320
not all over the place like up and down

688
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:11,760
and all that a lot of people feel a

689
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:14,120
little better in the morning after

690
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,760
sleeping when they drink

691
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:18,960
water afterwards they bloat right back

692
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:21,519
up so you go to bed at night you're

693
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,919
bloated you're out to hear you go to bed

694
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:25,480
you wake up in the morning and it's down

695
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:27,559
your liver got a chance throughout the

696
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:31,000
night to pack up some toxins and sh chip

697
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:32,960
it out and your bloating is down now and

698
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,399
then you drink water all of a sudden or

699
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,919
something else and you're starting up in

700
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:38,039
the morning and the bloating comes back

701
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:41,279
fast and it comes back fast and now it's

702
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:44,320
building up all day long so your

703
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:47,279
bloating is building up a lot of people

704
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:49,279
try not to drink much during the day or

705
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:51,159
eat much during the day because they

706
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:53,640
don't want to be bloated so they're

707
00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:56,159
withholding food all day long they're

708
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:57,600
withholding fluid all day long and

709
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:01,760
you'll notice like a lot of times times

710
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:04,080
influencers tend to go really

711
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:07,360
dehydrated really dehydrated they're

712
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:10,080
drinking their coffee only all morning

713
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:12,360
all afternoon and they're literally

714
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,840
dehydrating their themselves then they

715
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:16,080
go and they get a lymphatic drainage

716
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:19,039
while they're dehydrated and their

717
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,399
lymphatic uh therapist says make sure

718
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:22,640
you drink a lot of water when you're

719
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:24,919
done with this and they don't even want

720
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,440
to drink water they get done with their

721
00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:29,799
lymphatic massage and they have a little

722
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:32,559
Sip and it starts to come back a few

723
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:34,960
sips and it starts to come back so a lot

724
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:37,000
of people right now that fit into their

725
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,039
swim suit and so forth they're like

726
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,840
going dehydrated and that's not the way

727
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:43,679
to do it either that's not healthy

728
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:46,640
either it's not the way to battle

729
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:49,159
this so Nicole over there on IG says why

730
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:54,480
does green juice bloat

731
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:56,360
me well if my my thoughts here with that

732
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,840
question are what happens with a lot of

733
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:00,600
people

734
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:02,679
so nothing else bloats you it's only

735
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,360
green juice so you're just somebody

736
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:06,679
that's never bloated or you're not

737
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:08,519
bloated and then it's green juice that

738
00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:10,320
only bloats you like you're not bloated

739
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:11,639
ever you live your life you eat your

740
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,480
dinner you eat your breakfast you eat

741
00:31:11,639 --> 00:31:16,080
your lunch you're living your life

742
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,600
you're drinking what you want eating

743
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,799
what you want doing what you want and

744
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:22,159
all of a sudden you have a sip of green

745
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:24,000
juice and you're bloated now or is it

746
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:26,080
you already have a bloating problem

747
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,480
you're fighting bloating all the time it

748
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,799
just so happens when you're drink green

749
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:32,639
juice too you get bloated from that as

750
00:31:29,799 --> 00:31:34,519
well because that's probably what's

751
00:31:32,639 --> 00:31:36,760
happening I think

752
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:39,440
right so it's not like you go through

753
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:41,120
life and you're never bloated ever and

754
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:44,679
then all of a sudden green juice makes

755
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:47,840
you bloated but soda doesn't coffee

756
00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:51,200
doesn't nothing else makes you bloated a

757
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:53,080
bagel or plant-based eating or vegan

758
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,880
eating or animal protein eating whatever

759
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:56,159
it is nothing gets you bloated it's just

760
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,799
green

761
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:00,559
juice it's just something to think about

762
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,960
or you get bloated all the time you're

763
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:03,679
struggling with bloat but when you have

764
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:06,000
grain juice it seems to come on a little

765
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:07,960
bit more if you're somebody you're

766
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,080
really toxic a lot of stuff is sluggish

767
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:12,120
your liver's sluggish and you put some

768
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,159
pretty healthy stuff in you there's a

769
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:17,159
good chance it's going to start

770
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:18,919
detoxifying you right away and you could

771
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:20,799
get a little bit of bloat from stuff

772
00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:23,360
being pushed out starting to get pushed

773
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:25,000
out people will eat only a little piece

774
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:28,320
of meat or an

775
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:31,159
egg or a piece of chicken

776
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:33,159
just a little piece with like two leaves

777
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:34,559
of lettuce and a little piece of chicken

778
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:36,440
because they don't want too much in

779
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:39,000
their stomach they don't want to feel

780
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:41,600
that bloating because if they eat too

781
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:45,080
much they're bloated and people go on

782
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:48,320
dates and people go on dates they never

783
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:50,039
tank if it's a brand new date somebody

784
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,600
and someone goes on a date and they're

785
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:54,880
sitting at the table in the

786
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:56,720
restaurant no one's tanking no one's

787
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:59,000
like I'm going to eat this big stack of

788
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:02,480
panc pakes in front of you right here

789
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,440
I'm stuffed and then and then you leave

790
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,559
the table just stuffed right I'm going

791
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:09,039
to eat this 12 oce steak right now on

792
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:12,360
the on this first date right here people

793
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:14,880
go on dates they usually hold back food

794
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:16,279
all day long you know anybody that's

795
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,760
ever done

796
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:21,440
this when women go on dates they hold

797
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:23,840
back food all day long all day long for

798
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,799
the date cuz they don't want to blo out

799
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:27,000
they don't want to be bloated on any

800
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:28,600
level they want to be able to fit into

801
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,039
to whatever they want to fit into they

802
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:32,080
want to look good for their date same

803
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:33,519
thing with guys guys will just all of a

804
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:36,279
sudden they'll be intermittent fasting

805
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:38,399
the whole day so that when the date when

806
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:40,880
the date happens everybody's holding

807
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:43,000
their stomachs in no one wants to be

808
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,360
like bloated and then when they order

809
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,600
dinner they're eating a little something

810
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,840
that's how you can always tell if it's a

811
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:51,919
first aid out there like no one's eating

812
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:54,039
anything and then you know that's what

813
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:55,960
happens because if they did no one's

814
00:33:54,039 --> 00:33:57,159
going to just tank and then be bloated

815
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,799
and that's how it works people people

816
00:33:57,159 --> 00:34:01,279
eat very little a lot of times during

817
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:04,399
the day to keep their bloting down so

818
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:06,720
they can feel like they're like flat

819
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:10,399
right and then they eat a vegetable and

820
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:12,359
fruit with fiber and water and lots of

821
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:15,520
just water

822
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:17,800
rich and they eat all these vegetables

823
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:20,919
and all these fruits and all that all

824
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:24,359
that pulp and that pecting and that

825
00:34:20,919 --> 00:34:27,119
fiber and that water Rich right those

826
00:34:24,359 --> 00:34:30,000
nutrients are all going down and it it's

827
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:32,200
feeling kind of like bulk and all of a

828
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,800
sudden they're feeling it in their

829
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,159
intestinal tract let's talk about that

830
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,000
let's head into that direction a little

831
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:38,000
bit that's that deserves a little bit a

832
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,159
few

833
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,839
minutes if you guys got a few minutes

834
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:47,720
why is it that a lot of people who are

835
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:50,960
eating like leafy greens and fruits and

836
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:53,639
vegetables and they can feel that

837
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,200
roughage so much and they say I can't do

838
00:34:53,639 --> 00:35:00,040
that I have to be carnivore I can only

839
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:02,720
eat meat only I can only eat eggs only

840
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:05,040
because every time I eat a vegetable or

841
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:07,800
a fruit or something anytime I even and

842
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:09,920
eat any of that I feel it in my gut and

843
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:12,839
it doesn't digest and it doesn't break

844
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:15,800
down I can't eat raw because if I eat

845
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:18,960
raw I can feel it it it kind of hurts it

846
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:21,680
makes me feel uncomfortable all that

847
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:23,000
roughage is moving through me and then

848
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,200
they go to somebody they go to a health

849
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,560
coach or whatever the health coach is

850
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:28,359
don't have all that roughage you can't

851
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:31,000
have all that roughage just eat eggs

852
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:33,040
only do just eggs every day like have

853
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,599
six eggs a day how many people seen

854
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:39,000
people do that a lot they like six eggs

855
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:40,760
a day eat eggs and cheese this way you

856
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,640
know you're not like dealing with all

857
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,520
that roughage of all the vegetables and

858
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:46,720
all the

859
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:47,640
fruits but that doesn't fix it the eggs

860
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,920
and the

861
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:51,200
cheese that doesn't fix it so what

862
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,640
happens is the reason why people can

863
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:57,359
feel all that roughage sometimes like

864
00:35:54,640 --> 00:36:01,440
raw lettuces and raw kale

865
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:04,800
and raw collared greens and raw zucchini

866
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:08,440
and raw redbell peppers and raw Tomatoes

867
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:10,520
they feel it because they're inflamed in

868
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:13,680
the intestinal tract so when that's

869
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:15,640
moving through you you feel it more and

870
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:18,640
the nerve endings on the intestinal

871
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:20,760
tract Linings are sending signals to you

872
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,920
that it's not digesting it's not

873
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:25,160
breaking down but it is breaking down it

874
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:27,359
is digesting you just don't know it so a

875
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:29,240
lot of people they go into panic they go

876
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:32,079
into fear and they think they're not

877
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:34,720
breaking down their food and they can't

878
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:37,720
eat lettuce and they can't eat a tomato

879
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:39,960
and they can't eat a red bell pepper and

880
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:42,800
they can't eat an apple because they

881
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:44,319
feel it and it's just too much roughage

882
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,599
and it's moving through them and they're

883
00:36:44,319 --> 00:36:48,079
better off just eating like eggs every

884
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:51,680
single

885
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:53,119
day something soft like ice cream and

886
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:56,440
eggs and

887
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:58,760
cheese and maybe chicken or something or

888
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:01,160
some meat and that's all they feel like

889
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:05,400
they can do but they don't realize it

890
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:07,480
that what happens is that the fruits and

891
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:09,440
the leafy greens and vegetables are

892
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:12,280
actually letting people know there's hot

893
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:15,119
spots in their intestinal tract those

894
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:18,079
hot spots are inflamed areas where the

895
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:21,640
nerves are sensitive because of

896
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:23,839
pathogens viruses and bacteria that are

897
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:25,920
in the Linings of the intestinal tract

898
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:27,960
nesting in there and when they're in

899
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:30,200
there NES

900
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:32,359
they're creating inflammation which are

901
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:34,480
hot spots so as you're eating the

902
00:37:32,359 --> 00:37:36,119
roughage and the roughage is going down

903
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,599
there and the lettuces and the greens

904
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:40,520
are moving through they're hitting those

905
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:42,560
hot spots and that's when people are

906
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:44,800
feeling it like I can't digest I'm not

907
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:47,319
digesting something's wrong I can't

908
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:50,400
break down the food I need to be on just

909
00:37:47,319 --> 00:37:53,280
like four eggs a day and and some kind

910
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:55,640
of like mono you know carnivore thing or

911
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:58,319
something and they don't realize it is

912
00:37:55,640 --> 00:38:02,200
they got sensitive nerves in sensitive

913
00:37:58,319 --> 00:38:05,480
Linings and they're just feeling it it

914
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:07,480
doesn't mean it's not breaking down or

915
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:09,839
digesting so let's get to the liver a

916
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:11,760
little bit more okay rejuvenating the

917
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:15,400
liver bringing the liver

918
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:17,480
back that is one of the big keys if you

919
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:19,800
want to take control over your health

920
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:21,680

people are you know eating better and

922
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:26,560
they're doing better things now out

923
00:38:24,319 --> 00:38:27,920
there and so their liers improve

924
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,760
improving just from the good things

925
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:32,720
they're doing doesn't mean it's getting

926
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:35,480
them out of the woods

927
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:38,000
entirely so bringing back the liver

928
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:41,079
getting it out of stagnancy and

929
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:45,160
sluggishness getting it out of

930
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:50,440
overburden bringing it back key right

931
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:53,599
there to IBS to bloating to

932
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:55,520
constipation getting your stomach strong

933
00:38:53,599 --> 00:39:00,240
so let's go into the stomach a little

934
00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:04,800
bit you guys important

935
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:08,000
okay inside your stomach are glands

936
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:09,319
those glands produce your HCL that HCL

937
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,839
is

938
00:39:09,319 --> 00:39:14,160
everything

939
00:39:10,839 --> 00:39:19,000
everything that hydrochloric acid which

940
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:22,960
is a seven blend seven blend of acids

941
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:26,079
that HCL is critical to breaking down

942
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:28,839
your food but also breaking down

943
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:30,680
different aspects of the food so that we

944
00:39:28,839 --> 00:39:33,560
get the nutrients we need and we get

945
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:37,480
what we need to get out of it right

946
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:40,920
there okay so the stomach stomach glands

947
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:43,200
HCL big part of recovery big part of

948
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:45,440
recovery for the liver

949
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,440
too so if you're somebody that's out

950
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,640

cramps

957
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:06,800
gastritis

that just they

972
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:42,079
stink that's another thing too it's from

973
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:44,520
getting toxic and getting the liver

974
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:47,920
toxic and everything being all hung up

975
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:50,040
and stuck and sluggish stagnant so it's

976
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:52,480
critical to get these things better so

977
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:55,640
another thing too let's go into it a lot

978
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:57,280
of people's livers are inhabited they're

979
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:59,240
inhabited

980
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,800
from pathogens and pathogens you're

981
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:05,560
sitting inside the liver viruses

982
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:11,079
bacteria sitting inside the liver ebvs

983
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:14,880
hhv 6s cyto megl viruses hhv7 simplex

984
00:41:11,079 --> 00:41:18,480
one 2 all these different bugs

985
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:21,640
strep staff H

986
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:25,240
pylori all sitting inside the liver

987
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:29,560
making it more stagnant and more

988
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:32,119
sluggish so eating foods that don't feed

989
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:34,839
those bugs is critical to recovery so

990
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:37,599
knowing what foods to eat it's critical

991
00:41:34,839 --> 00:41:41,280
to have the information right there like

992
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:46,200
deliver rescue and cleanse the

993
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:48,240
heel right there important

994
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:50,440
information one of the reasons why so

995
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:53,079
many people heal from celery juice

996
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:54,680
drinking their celery juice every day is

997
00:41:53,079 --> 00:41:58,079
because it's restoring the stomach

998
00:41:54,680 --> 00:42:00,119
glands inside of the stomach the ones

999
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:03,400
that produce your gastric acid which is

1000
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:07,280
your HCL and the celery juice every

1001
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:09,160
single day gives you a liver flush you

1002
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:12,200
have it in the morning especially gives

1003

you a liver flush helps to push the

1004
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:16,920
poisons and the toxins out and another

1005
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:18,359
thing the celery juice does too is it

1006
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:20,359
lowers

1007
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:23,200
pathogen

1008
00:42:20,359 --> 00:42:26,280
proliferation breaks down bugs and

1009
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:29,359
pathogens bringing them down to a lower

1010
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:31,920
level over time it's just one of the

1011
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:34,200

medium newsletter let's talk about

1058
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:25,000
constipation a little

1059
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:27,839
bit

1060
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,400
constipation most constipation issues

1061
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:33,440
are from inflamed areas inside the

1062
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:36,800
intestinal tract somebody might have an

1063
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:39,240
inflamed area in the elen somebody might

1064
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:42,400
have an inflamed area the descending

1065
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:45,280
colon the ascending colon and what

1066
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:48,240
happens is because it's inflamed poop

1067
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:50,880
can't move through okay another reason

1068
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:54,200
why people have constipation issues this

1069
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:56,680
peristaltic action has stopped because

1070
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:59,160
their vagus nerve is causing a problem

1071
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:00,839
where the vegus nerve is inflamed not

1072
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:04,280
getting the right signals to the

1073
00:45:00,839 --> 00:45:06,599
intestinal tract so it's neurological

1074
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:08,119
constipation is what I call it so it's

1075
00:45:06,599 --> 00:45:10,559
another reason so many people get

1076
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:11,680
constipation and another reason why it's

1077
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:13,640
because when they're inflamed they're

1078
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:15,880
inflamed with a lot of bad bacteria in

1079
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:18,119
certain pockets of the intestinal tract

1080
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:20,559
and expansions and narrowings have have

1081
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:22,520
occurred and so the fecal matter gets

1082
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:24,359
hung up and stuck in different areas

1083
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:26,640
between that and the peristaltic action

1084
00:45:24,359 --> 00:45:30,240
not being there plus areas that are

1085
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:32,599
inflamed all these things can heal so

1086
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:34,440
many people on MM info have gotten their

1087
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:35,240
inflammation down in their gut restored

1088
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,559
their

1089
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:39,040
livers and they're going to bathroom

1090
00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:41,640

00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:43,559
