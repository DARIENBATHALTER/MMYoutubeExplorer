[515.36 - 522.64] they are shockingly scary to some degree
[519.44 - 524.24] eye-opening awakening the whole bit so
[522.64 - 524.80] on the uncensored platforms apple
[524.24 - 526.40] podcast
[524.80 - 528.64] medical meeting podcast at apple podcast
[526.40 - 531.68] check it out um
[528.64 - 532.40] so uh fontana says i've done your brain
[531.68 - 534.72] meditation
[532.40 - 536.48] six times and you love it incredible i'm
[534.72 - 538.56] so proud of you that you're doing it
[536.48 - 541.04] that's amazing and it's really a
[538.56 - 542.72] powerful meditation to brain meditation
[541.04 - 544.16] because what happens is when we go
[542.72 - 547.28] through hardships like losses
[544.16 - 549.12] heartache betrayal broken trust when we
[547.28 - 550.48] have hard times in our life when we have
[549.12 - 552.40] struggles when we have all kinds of
[550.48 - 554.56] emotional hardships of different kinds
[552.40 - 556.64] when we go through things what happens
[554.56 - 558.40] is we get this out of body experience
[556.64 - 560.16] where it's not a good experience but we
[558.40 - 562.00] get kicked out of her body our soul gets
[560.16 - 564.24] kicked out of her body for a second
[562.00 - 565.12] and or for a day and we're just numb
[564.24 - 567.28] from it we get
[565.12 - 568.88] injured from say someone broke up with
[567.28 - 570.64] someone and say there's a
[568.88 - 572.48] relationship problem or somebody cheated
[570.64 - 574.08] on somebody or a
[572.48 - 575.60] work partner something went wrong with a
[574.08 - 577.44] work partner confrontation or
[575.60 - 578.96] something's just so stressful
[577.44 - 581.36] some kind of struggle some kind of
[578.96 - 583.44] hardship you know feelings of fear and
[581.36 - 585.52] loss and shame and guilt and
[583.44 - 587.20] struggles inside our heart all these
[585.52 - 588.64] things what happens is we get
[587.20 - 589.76] disconnected because of these
[588.64 - 591.28] experiences
[589.76 - 593.44] and it creates a little bit of anxiety
[591.28 - 595.36] or depression depersonalization
[593.44 - 597.36] and our soul just gets kicked out of her
[595.36 - 599.36] body like the crap gets kicked out of it
[597.36 - 601.36] it just boom gets kicked out of her body
[599.36 - 603.28] and then fear fills in and we walk
[601.36 - 605.60] around fearful we walk around
[603.28 - 607.44] broken trust we walk we don't trust
[605.60 - 609.04] we're afraid to trust we're afraid to
[607.44 - 610.80] you know whatever it is and we're all
[609.04 - 613.12] these different things and so
[610.80 - 614.40] the brain meditation is to repair the
[613.12 - 616.08] damage done
[614.40 - 617.52] because in this in the emotional center
[616.08 - 619.36] of the brain the emotional center of the
[617.52 - 620.48] brain these neurons they fry when you
[619.36 - 622.48] get bad news
[620.48 - 623.68] so when you get bad news like what what
[622.48 - 626.16] happened
[623.68 - 627.60] someone did what or what's going on the
[626.16 - 629.60] emotional center of the brain just all
[627.60 - 630.96] of a sudden gets boom like a shot of
[629.60 - 633.12] lightning bolts go through like
[630.96 - 634.64] electricity and then our soul just gets
[633.12 - 637.12] kicked out for a little bit
[634.64 - 638.40] and those those neurons get chewed up
[637.12 - 639.84] and we end up getting post-traumatic
[638.40 - 641.12] stress syndrome we can end up getting
[639.84 - 643.28] ptsd
[641.12 - 644.96] and so the brain meditation bridges the
[643.28 - 646.48] gap it heals the neurons in the
[644.96 - 648.72] emotional center of the brain
[646.48 - 649.84] bridges the gap so the soul and the and
[648.72 - 652.00] the brain connect
[649.84 - 653.52] i mean it's really powerful you can only
[652.00 - 656.40] experience it if you do it
[653.52 - 657.12] um so yeah you can use both there's
[656.40 - 659.20] messaging
[657.12 - 660.80] with message messaging with angels does
[659.20 - 662.64] that apply to itunes too you can use
[660.80 - 663.04] both or is it the same as apple podcast
[662.64 - 664.96] you could
[663.04 - 666.16] use both and that's the uncensored
[664.96 - 668.16] version right there
[666.16 - 669.68] so very very good that you know about
[668.16 - 672.32] that and know where to go
[669.68 - 674.56] so the medical meeting podcast make sure
[672.32 - 677.28] you check that out um
[674.56 - 678.64] powerful episodes but the episode today
[677.28 - 681.76] that was launched
[678.64 - 684.08] eggs eaters lose all so important
[681.76 - 686.96] melissa larkin says the brain meditation
[684.08 - 688.96] is helping my lifelong insomnia
[686.96 - 690.96] incredible and you know what when fear
[688.96 - 692.16] is trapped in there and broken trust and
[690.96 - 693.92] ptsd and
[692.16 - 696.00] any kind of hurt that's somewhere deep
[693.92 - 698.16] down inside there and a soul
[696.00 - 699.44] that meditation helps to clear that out
[698.16 - 702.24] and bring that out
[699.44 - 703.20] the power of that in in you guys have to
[702.24 - 705.44] know something
[703.20 - 706.80] okay this is really important right here
[705.44 - 708.96] check this out okay
[706.80 - 710.32] meditations are man-made and there's
[708.96 - 711.28] nothing wrong with that but they're
[710.32 - 713.12] man-made
[711.28 - 714.96] that's what meditations are it's like
[713.12 - 718.08] some guy's trying one thing
[714.96 - 719.04] he some other guy tries it in 1960 and
[718.08 - 722.48] then another try
[719.04 - 723.68] 1970 and another guy tries it another
[722.48 - 725.28] guy tries it and then
[723.68 - 727.12] there's a style of meditation and then
[725.28 - 727.92] it gets plugged into yoga then it gets
[727.12 - 729.60] plugged into
[727.92 - 731.36] and it's all man-made and that's all
[729.60 - 733.20] great but but
[731.36 - 735.52] the medical medium meditations they're
[733.20 - 737.04] not man-made i can't make that
[735.52 - 739.92] meditation
[737.04 - 741.20] no one can make the brain meditation
[739.92 - 743.20] really important to know
[741.20 - 744.48] that you just can't make a meditation
[743.20 - 745.20] like that it's not something you could
[744.48 - 748.40] just
[745.20 - 750.96] make or man-made come up with it it
[748.40 - 754.00] doesn't work that way it came from above
[750.96 - 756.32] so the brain meditation comes from above
[754.00 - 758.00] that came to me when i was younger and i
[756.32 - 760.08] coveted that brain meditation
[758.00 - 761.76] i covered a lot of the meditations but
[760.08 - 763.68] that when i coveted it meaning
[761.76 - 765.60] it was just for friends it was just for
[763.68 - 767.60] family when i was younger
[765.60 - 769.12] and to heal their their wounds and then
[767.60 - 771.52] i realized why don't i just
[769.12 - 773.04] podcast this brain meditation so
[771.52 - 775.04] millions can heal because millions have
[773.04 - 777.20] healed from medical medium books already
[775.04 - 778.96] with other meditations why am i not
[777.20 - 781.12] releasing the brain meditation
[778.96 - 782.72] and it was like a friend of mine said
[781.12 - 784.48] why aren't you releasing this
[782.72 - 786.40] what are you doing i'm like oh my god i
[784.48 - 788.16] will start a podcast tomorrow

[791.44 - 794.64] podcasts trisha you know what's funny
[793.20 - 796.48] is that's what i was worried about like
[794.64 - 798.00] did i give you guys too many and

[828.80 - 831.52] sicker and implementing the mm info is
[830.80 - 833.44] the only
[831.52 - 834.80] reason i'm healing you know what's

[845.44 - 849.28] different foods in the cleanses it's
[847.36 - 850.56] and medical medium information isn't
[849.28 - 853.92] fruits and vegetables

[1126.56 - 1130.72] and piece is missing or whatever i can't
[1128.96 - 1132.88] guarantee if the apple podcast

[1164.72 - 1168.96] it and you share the brain meditation
[1166.72 - 1170.24] and share these episodes it's not going
[1168.96 - 1171.44] to do anything for me because i don't
[1170.24 - 1174.32] have advertisements
[1171.44 - 1174.96] i don't have uh sponsorships with it i
[1174.32 - 1176.40] don't have

[1181.60 - 1185.92] whole point it's a free resource
