1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,980
we walk around with old hurt inside of

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:07,560
us from many many years ago in our lives

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:10,200
from betrayal broken trust not being

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:13,080
validated not being heard being

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,839
misunderstood being hurt by people that

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,520
we love people we don't love

7
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:20,100
relationships relationship breakups work

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,520
relationships because what we do is we

9
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:25,199
Harbor toxic baggage from wounds that

10
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,420
have been sitting inside of us for a

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,939
very long time inside of our soul side

12
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:33,360
of our heart inside of our spirit I'm

13
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:34,920

mind it's going to move you forward

18
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,160
you're not going to experience anything

19
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:46,140

guide you personally through stones have

22
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:55,620
an ability to absorb but that ability is

23
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,680
not tapped into when you start that

24
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:03,120
Journey on the 19th something incredible

25
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:05,339
happens and a deeper connection starts

26
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,320
