apple cider vinegar i want you guys to

46
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,479
know that i've always told people if you

47
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,439
can't let go of your vinegar if you

48
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,439
can't

49
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,360
yes use the apple cider vinegar and if

50
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,759
you can't let go of the grape vinegar if

51
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,159
you can't let go of the you know the red

52
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,719
the the you know the red grape vinegar

53
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,640
if you can't let go of that or balsamic

54
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,239
vinegar if you can't let go of that then

55
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,560
use the apple cider vinegar but

56
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:13,200
something has happened that's changed

57
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,520
over the last 10 years now and people

58
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,680
are using apple cider vinegar they're

59
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,360
using it in large quantities like one to

60
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,120
two teaspoons i mean one to two

61
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,040
tablespoons really one to three

62
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,720
tablespoons one to four tablespoons

63
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,239
they'll take it in the morning they'll

64
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,080
put it in water they'll put it in

65
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,720
smoothies they'll put it in something

66
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,800
but what happens is they don't know

67
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,440
what goes on internally with apple cider

68
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,640
vinegar it's acetic acid

69
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:42,000
and you have to listen to this episode

70
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,560
about acetic acid and what happens in

71
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,519
the body when that acetic acid enters

72
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,720
and

73
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,840
and i want to tell you something if

74
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,239
you're somebody where it helped your

75
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,920
acid reflux if you're somebody where

76
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,560
apple cider vinegar helped your acid

77
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,280
reflux or apple cider vinegar helped

78
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,400
your bloating there's a reason why it

79
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,200
helped

80
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,200
but

81
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:05,840
there's also backlash that occurs later

82
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,640
when the teeth start to actually fall

83
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,800
apart or the the enamel starts to wear

84
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,800
off later and i want to forewarn people

85
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,480
because when you're chronically sick

86
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,319
the last thing you need now is teeth

87
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,800
problems later on when you're already

88
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,879
dealing with fatigue and other issues

89
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,400
and everything so that's one thing right

90
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,040
there um

91
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,159
kate dillon delorenzo says i used acv

92
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,040
for months

93
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,239
morning night one teaspoon morning one

94
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,920
at night

95
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,440
but it killed me i ended up with

96
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,120
digestive problems and lots more and i

97
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,000
want kate i want to talk about that for

98
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,239
a second because what that means is

99
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,799
exactly what i talked about in the apple

100
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,480
cider vinegar episode so you have to

101
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,200
listen to this episode you guys now

102
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,200
here's how it works your stomach glands

103
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,040
if they're strong enough

104
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,439
what happens is you can take the apple

105
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,360
cider vinegar and then see some benefits

106
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,840
if your stomach lands are strong enough

107
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,519
but a lot of people their stomach lands

108
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,200
aren't strong enough the stomach glands

109
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,920
that produce gastric acid that's your

110
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,400
hcl hydrochloric acid and then when you

111
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,360
take acetic acid which is apple cider

112
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,280
vinegar when you take that vinegar and

113
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,200
it what it does is it puts stress on

114
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,640
those stomach glands and if they're not

115
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,400
strong enough those stomach lands

116
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,320
because your hcl is weak your stomach

117
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,880
glands are weakened and and they're

118
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,639
depleted then they just blow out and

119
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,000
when they blow out you get real sick

120
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,440
from acv

121
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,440
and you might be somebody that's not

122
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,680
there yet your stomach glands haven't

123
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,320
been that compromised yet but here's the

124
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,600
problem they will get compromised so if

125
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,120
you're doing your apple cider vinegar

126
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,960
for five years then you do it every

127
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,360
night or you do it every morning

128
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,840
eventually those stomach glands will get

129
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,040
burned out and when they burn out boom

130
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,960
you don't know what's causing your

131
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,520
problem you'll still do your apple cider

132
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,759
vinegar not knowing it's the apple cider

133
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,080
vinegar that made the stomach lands

134
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,080
really bad to begin with or really made

135
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,080
them worse actually because our stomach

136
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,240
lands get depleted anyway but this

137
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,680
pushes it over the edge so when you hear

138
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,520
this episode

139
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,880

judgment call and you throw shade at me

149
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,280

150
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,440
because here it is anthony william the

151
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,120
medical medium is talking about apple

152
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,320
cider vinegar now because he you know

153
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,840
he's always getting in trouble for

154
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,600
talking about something or another

155
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,320
because i'm always going to step on

156
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,000
somebody's toes by accident well you

157
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,240
know not by accident but just

158
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,160
automatically is what i mean it just

159
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,280
happens when you have information about

160
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,039
things so

161
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,440
and it just so happens though it gets

162
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:52,320
people upset um good to see everybody on

163
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,320
here right now so here's the thing about

164
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,160
apple cider vinegar if your stomach

165
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,000
glands are really strong and they

166
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,840
haven't been weakened yet and you want

167
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,759
to take apple cider vinegar internally

168
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,080
on a daily basis you're not going to

169
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,720
notice a problem yet you'll even see

170
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,160
that your acid reflux could back down

171
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,840
you can see which you could have fixed

172
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,680
it other ways but you'll see your acid

173
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,360
reflux back down you'll see you're

174
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,960
bloating back down

175
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,400
you might see what seems to be some

176
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,440
weight loss too because there's an

177
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:23,199
appetite suppressant but as the stomach

178
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:25,360
lands get tired from the acetic acid

179
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,039
and they start to blow out they start to

180
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,400
pickle so you have to know how this

181
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,880
works i'm going to talk about the pickle

182
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:34,240
process with this too when your stomach

183
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:36,400
lands start to pickle in there okay what

184
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,440
happens is they blow out they also get

185
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,199
depleted and they they get way far gone

186
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,600

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,599
about what i like about apple cider

221
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:58,479

222
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:01,039
how it's mineral rich so it does at

223
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:03,599
least have that it's the best

224
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:06,080
vinegar there is and i talk about why

225
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:08,560
apple cider vinegar is the best vinegar

226
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:11,360
there is outside of all the vinegars but

227
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,599
even with that said i talk about why we

228
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,120
have to look out and be very cautious

229
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,440
with it and i know that gets people

230
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,599
upset but there's reasons now here's one

231
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,479
reason right here okay and you'll hear

232
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:25,039
more in detail in the episode but

233
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:28,400
what happens with acetic acid it has a

234
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:30,400
chemical reaction with calcium calcium

235
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:34,399
calcium is in your teeth calcium is in

236
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:36,240
your bones acetic acid depletes calcium

237
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,800
there's a chemical reaction that occurs

238
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,640
when acetic acid hits calcium now i'm

239
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,680
just going to say this okay

240
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:45,839
there's vinegar in cleaning products

241
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,640
so remember that there's a reason why

242
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,600
vinegar is in cleaning products

243
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:54,959
and

244
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:57,920
vinegar can clean hard water stains yes

245
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,760
calcium stains hmm

246
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,160
think about that one for a little bit

247
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,160
okay now i know that gets apple cider

248
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,800
vinegar people upset by even you know

249
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,560
talking anything bad about it but i just

250
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,120
want you to have a chance to protect

251
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,760
yourself in case you got sucked into the

252
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,839
apple cider vinegar trend you know and

253
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,600
so this is how it works

254
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,560
why does vinegar

255
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:24,320
clean water stains

256
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:27,200
why does it do that hard water stains

257
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:30,240
it cleans them because

258
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:33,040
it can decalcify it can actually have a

259
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,880
reaction to calcium and start wearing

260
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,279
calcium away

261
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,200

going back 35 years you guys i have

310
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,480
always said if you're gonna do vinegar

311
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:31,120
and you're not to let it go it has to be

312
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,600

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,000
to say oh this is bad oh don't do this

316
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:44,000
ever and whatnot i'm just saying what

317
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,240
happened is over the last couple of

318
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,120
decades actually the last decade last 10

319
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,760
years

320
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,160
a a surge was happening about taking it

321
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,320
internally and it's really sad because

322
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,720
when you're struggling with you know any

323
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,399

328
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:09,680

fibroids if you're suffering with

331
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,560
something pretty intense like really

332
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:19,519
struggling whatever it could be

333
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:22,000
you know lupus lyme disease neurological

334
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,680
lyme whatever's going on you don't want

335
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,920
to have that apple cider vinegar shots

336
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,320
you don't want to have those tablespoons

337
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,399
of apple cider vinegar so important to

338
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,920
know because if you do that

339
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,480
what happens

340
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,240
is that we end up hurting ourselves in

341
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,560
other ways and i talk about all the

342
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,800
different ways it doesn't help somebody

343
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,120
who's really struggling and really

344
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,360

suppress your appetite or something

351
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,399

353
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:03,839
difference but by the time you're 30 by

354
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:05,519
the time you're 34 by the time you're 35

355
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,000

vinegar

420
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,839
messaging with angels what a cool name i

421
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:36,639
dropped vinegar and oils and it helped

422
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:38,800
my acid reflux if i do eat it i get the

423
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,639
acid reflux that's because

424
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,240
stomach lands when they're already

425
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,040
overloaded and you're trying to heal

426
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,040
them

427
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,600
and and when you when you throw that

428
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,839
acetic acid in that apple cider vinegar

429
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,800
oh forget it what it does is it

430
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:55,199
completely blows them out it squeezes

431
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,519
every last drop of hcl out of your

432
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:59,680
stomach lands these tiny little stomach

433
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:02,079
glands sitting in your stomach that's

434
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,399
what produces your gastric acid when you

435
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:07,040
drop those tablespoons of apple cider

436
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:09,600
vinegar down in there and you just it

437
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:12,480
pickles them and squeezes them out uh

438
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,320
ashley alexandra i knew a girl that

439
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,000
loved to faithfully drink regular white

440
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,480
distilled vinegar every day for many

441
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,639
months about a cup a day and it pickled

442
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:24,399
her insides and she went through major

443
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:27,199
stomach surgery it does so what happens

444
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:29,759
is that that acetic acid causes that

445
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:32,160

words don't come out of your mouth the

518
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,360
way they're supposed to because to the

519
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,799
thoughts in your head so you feel like

520
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,880
they're not matching the thoughts in

521
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,640
your head the words that you're speaking

522
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,760
or you can't really understand people

523
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,280
that are talking to you because you're

524
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,440
forgetting what they're saying or that

525
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,440
you can't compute it and you can't

526
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,679
register it or something meanwhile

527
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,240
you're brilliant you're smart you're a

528
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,640
good person you're not you're you're not

529
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,240
uneducated you're not you're not any of

530
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,160
those things you know a lot of people i

531
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,440
had a friend tell me that that told me

532
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,679
it's like you know

533
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,919
that told me that they feel like people

534
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,400
think she's like she doesn't she's not

535
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,400
smart and she's uneducated or something

536
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,640
and she's just doesn't have it together

537
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,559
and she's a ditz and that's not at all

538
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,799
she's suffering struggling from brain

539
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:47,120
fog and she was telling me how people

540
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:49,120
they underestimate her they misjudge her

541
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,360
they misunderstand her

542
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,400
and it's just not fair it's just not

543
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,400
fair

544
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,240

553
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,000
worked well for a while and then

554
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,120
developed digestive difficulties okay

555
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,440
okay

556
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,760
that's what i talk about in the episode

557
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,400
is it could work well for a bit for a

558
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,919
little bit and then you get problems

559
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,000
from it and i'll tell you why it was

560
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,640
what i was saying those gastric glands

561
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,280
of yours those little glands or stomach

562
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,120
glands what happens is when you dump

563
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,880
that acetic acid down in you so i'll

564
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,320
take a couple tablespoons okay let me

565
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,640
have my apple cider vinegar here i'll

566
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,960
take a couple tablespoons here and and

567
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,480
put it down and and send it down whoa

568
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,960
it's helping a little bit it's helping

569
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,640
what it's doing is it's blowing out

570
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,440
those glands what that means is it's

571
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:56,640
making them squeeze every last drop of

572
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:59,280
all that hcl out and then you get a max

573
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,960
out point so you get a max out point and

574
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,880
a leveling point where your stomach

575
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,120
glands go can't take this anymore i

576
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,799
can't do it anymore and then all the

577
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,960
digestive problems start coming back and

578
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,400
coming back coming back plus the acetic

579
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,320
acid is so hard on the lining of the

580
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,640

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,559
i don't know which one's my favorite at

617
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,320
this point because i had a favorite and

618
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,760
then i was like well i don't know if

619
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,200
fruit fear is my favorite anymore

620
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,480
because i love the air fresheners

621
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,919
episode well i don't know if the air

622
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,440
freshener sent the candle episodes my

623
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,200
favorite anymore because apple cider

624
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,360
vinegar that's my favorite now

625
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,640
neurological symptoms are my favorite

626
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,600
janice says

627
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:50,240
janice ellison says if you ingest acv

628
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,200
use a straw to protect your teeth smart

629
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,159
idea

630
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,640
but

631
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:57,520
you'll still get other problems too

632
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,520
though janice listen to the episode it's

633
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:02,080
really good to do and by the way janice

634
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,880
that's really that's really a good idea

635
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,799
but

636
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,240
that's not how you protect your teeth

637
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,880
entirely

638
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,520
because the apple cider vinegar it gets

639
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,520
in your bloodstream it gets everywhere

640
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:16,640
so it has a chemical reaction with

641
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:18,480
calcium altogether bones included so

642
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,000
even though you're bypassing the apple

643
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,240
cider vinegar and you're not letting it

644
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,039
touch your teeth it's bypassing your

645
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:27,760
teeth it still finds its way to your

646
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:30,000
teeth because it sucks calcium out it

647
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,000
vampires the calcium out it leeches it

648
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,080
out of the body so even though you're

649
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,520
kind of bypassing it with a straw which

650
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,520
is a great idea because at least you're

651
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,280
not getting direct contact to your teeth

652
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,360
so it was really smart

653
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:44,400
at the same time your teeth will still

654
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,679
be affected by it uh just just happening

655
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,200
because it's in your body and you're

656
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,960
drinking it and consuming it and it

657
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,960
still finds its way because

658
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,960
your teeth will still get hit with it it

659
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,960
will still touch your teeth so unless

660
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,320
you take the straw and kind of stick it

661
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,480
down further

662
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,159
and just try to suck that way so it goes

663
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:03,360
down your throat it's not really an easy

664
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:06,880
option it's not a great one um

665
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:08,559
yeah and so the thing is with with the

666
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,200
whole thing with apple cider vinegar and

667
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:12,559
any vinegar is it pickles organs too

668
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,880
because there's this chemical reaction

669
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:17,200
that happens inside the body with salt

670
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:20,000
so how do you pickle something well you

671
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:22,240
need vinegar and you need salt and we

672
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,240
have salt in our bloodstream naturally

673
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,159
occurring wait to hear about that and

674
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,640

we'll do a quick we'll do a quick

774
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,440
rundown on this a little bit

775
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,799
why was this episode named teeth

776
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,080
dissolver

777
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:03,039
because

778
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:05,039
unfortunately apple cider vinegar will

779
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:06,960
wear down the enamel on your teeth i

780
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:09,120
talk about why and how that happens

781
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,799
check that out and unless your teeth are

782
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,640
important and the apple cider vinegar is

783
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:14,159
more important than your teeth if it's

784
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,399
more important than your teeth then just

785
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:19,120
you can use it if you know

786
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:22,320
jeff says that's the problem it can make

787
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,840
you feel better at first yes exactly

788
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,600
jeff that's what i was saying in the

789
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,919
episode it can make you feel better at

790
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:30,480
first but then down the road symptoms

791
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:32,880
reoccur and you think nothing of it in

792
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:35,520
fact you may believe it is time to

793
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,679
increase acv but it is the acv causing

794
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,840
damage that's what happens you think you

795
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:41,440
have to increase acv meanwhile it's

796
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,919
causing the problem

797
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:46,480
