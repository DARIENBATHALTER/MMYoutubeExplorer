1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,040
out there about supplements and how it

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,839
works

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,600
so when we get a blood test it's just a

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:10,160
snapshot in time so we have to remember

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,799
that it's just a window in time that's

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,639
what it is it's like this one snapshot

7
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:16,160
and that's something to understand when

8
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,640
it comes down to blood work and stuff so

9
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,439
when someone says well

10
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,600
you know my b12 is fine in my blood test

11
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,920
then why are you sick

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,400
then why are you sick my blood test was

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,080
great my blood work is great doctor says

14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,840
everything looks good then why are you

15
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,520
at the doctor's office

16
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,520
you know why are you sick why are you

17
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,360
breaking out with acne why do you have

18
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,879
severe depression why do you have skin

19
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,320
problems why do you have eczema why do

20
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,480
you have psoriasis why do you have some

21
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,840
other problem too so there's a lot of

22
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,840
confusion out there it's like no my

23
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,280
blood works fine looks good

24
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,640
you know everything looks good my

25
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,800
nutrients are good oh my b12 is great

26
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,800
yeah a year later

27
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,000
you got brain fog and you're at a

28
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,399
specialist

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,320
a year later you're getting an mri

30
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,399
two years later you're sick with

31
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,680
something else three years later you got

32
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,439
fatigue

33
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,000
four years later hairs falling out

34
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:10,320
fatigue skin problems more acne

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,880
depression everything else and that's

36
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,720
what we're up against it's so but your

37
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,640
blood work was fine

38
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,520
your blood test was great

39
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,400
your b12 was perfect

40
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,119
right

41
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,320
your b12 was perfect meanwhile

42
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,159
you're sick

43
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,400
it's like oh my blood works too my blood

44
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,200
work was great i'm great today three

45
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,360
years later you're sick

46
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,720
so let's talk about like how this works

47
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,320
to begin with and everything around it

48
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,680
so this is all important information

49
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,799
we're talking about supplements today a

50
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,240
little bit

51
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,600
specifically we're going to talk about

52
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,040
melatonin

53
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,119
that's a good one to talk about right

54
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,960
there

55
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:50,000
5mthf we're going to talk about that

56
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,280
cat's call i'm not sponsored by the way

57
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,479
cat's claw

58
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,159
we're going to talk about that a little

59
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,560
bit too maybe a little bit of

60
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,799
ashwagandha if we have time of course we

61
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,399
got the b12 here

62
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,680
and

63
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,240
i think liz had a question about

64
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,600
elderberry circle with 369 cleanses

65
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,439
right because there's honey in

66
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,879
elderberry in this elderberry syrup

67
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,720
which is incredible

68
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,720
because it's not it's not something else

69
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,040
that's in there it's not like it's not

70
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,440
like straight corn syrup or sugar or

71
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,599
anything like that so it's it's nothing

72
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,239
like that too and that's important to

73
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,080
know

74
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:27,040
so

75
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,040
when it so you can do the 369 with the

76
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,239
369 cleanse

77
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,239
okay

78
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,519
you can do the elderberry syrup with 369

79
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,120
cleanse that's that's not a problem it's

80
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,400
not a lot of honey to begin with and

81
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,560
it's okay

82
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,319
you're welcome liz

83
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,599
i mean if i was doing the 369 cleanse

84
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,120
right now and i want to take elderberry

85
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,760
syrup i would do it i'll take all the

86
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,760
berry syrup

87
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,440
all right so here we are so i want to go

88
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,560
back to the blood work a little bit

89
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,480
it's interesting how someone will say

90
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,720
that all checks out finding my blood

91
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,800
work my blood work was good my b12 was

92
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,599
good my calcium was good my other

93
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,680
nutrients were good and everything

94
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,360
but they're sick and they're dealing

95
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,519
with autoimmune they're dealing with all

96
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,519
kinds of other issues and everything so

97
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,720
what is it is it really good or not so i

98
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,200
just want to start out real quick with

99
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,840
the b12 for a couple of seconds when b12

100
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,080
is

101
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,879
high in your system so hey my b12 is

102
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,519
high i don't need b12

103
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:29,120
but if there's any kind of mental

104
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,840
illness mental health issues

105
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,080
if there's any kind of

106
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:37,120
autoimmune anything neurological on any

107
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,200
level nervous system brain and central

108
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,920
nervous system is if there's anything

109
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,720
like that anything brain

110
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:47,040
central nervous system

111
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,959
elevated b12

112
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,440
doesn't mean oh

113
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,480
that's it don't need to take b12 ever

114
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,080
again

115
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,599
that's not how it works a couple of

116
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,439
things happen a lot of people are on a

117
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,400
high fat diet when they're on a high fat

118
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,799
diet

119
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,959
the b12 suspends in their bloodstream so

120
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:06,879
if they get a blood test and the blood

121
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:10,400
test shows that their b12 is high

122
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:13,200
and they had fat the previous day

123
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,360
nuts seeds nut milks and which is fine

124
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,880
right chicken if someone wants to eat

125
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,600
chicken this isn't an anti-animal

126
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,600
protein anti-vegan whatever i'm just

127
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,639
talking about fats right

128
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,360
okay

129
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,360
cheese butter whatever which is not good

130
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,160
that's not good right so say they had

131
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,240
some kind of animal fat or say they had

132
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,160
some kind of plant fat or even avocado

133
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,639
the day before

134
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,120
it can suspend nutrients in the

135
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,800
bloodstream not allowing them to absorb

136
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,479
easy so when you get your blood test and

137
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,479
you're like oh my b12 is high i need to

138
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:47,600
stop my b12 meanwhile the fats in the

139
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:49,360
diet are suspending the nutrients in the

140
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,880
bloodstream so they don't enter into

141
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,960
cells

142
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,840
it's an important piece of information

143
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,400
so

144
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,919
um

145
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,280
yeah

146
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,960
we're here right now we're talking about

147
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,479
supplements

148
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,160
we're talking about the central nervous

149
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,759
system in the moment talking about b12

150
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,600
how it enters into the central nervous

151
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:11,360
system so this is this is critical

152
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,479
anybody with neurological lyme

153
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,160
that

154
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,320
gets

155
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,120
information about their blood work and

156
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,800
their b12 is high and i was telling a

157
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,560
doctor this the other day

158
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,720
the doctor said to me what do you

159
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,479
recommend anthony because i i give

160
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,680
information to doctors all the time i

161
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:31,840
say i recommend that your patient stays

162
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,720
on b12

163
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,639
because

164
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,639
they're having neurological symptoms

165
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,400
they got neurological lyme

166
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,759
they get all the symptoms associated

167
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,600
with it right

168
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,960
and even though their blood tests this

169
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,160
doctor was saying well their blood test

170
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:48,479
shows they got plenty of b12

171
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,560
but that doesn't mean the nervous system

172
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,479
has plenty of b12 your central nervous

173
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,560
system doesn't have enough b12 doesn't

174
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,960
mean your brain has enough b12

175
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,759
it's a snapshot in the bloodstream

176
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,759
most likely the b12 they're taking

177
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,199
is just suspended because of the fats

178
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,960
and oils and i said well what is your

179
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,600
neurological lyme patients on he said

180
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,520
well i got them on a keto diet

181
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,960
i'm like so you got them on a keto diet

182
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,360
so they're on a high fat diet so the

183
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,560
fats are suspending the nutrients in

184
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,080
their bloodstream and it's not even

185
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,360
getting to their central nervous system

186
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:22,560
so the details matter is what i'm saying

187
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,960
the details matter all about it right

188
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,039
so when someone's dealing with a

189
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,039
neurological symptom of any kind so what

190
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,639
is the neurological symptom

191
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,800
tightness of the chest anxiety

192
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,639
depression aches and pains tingles and

193
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,479
numbness ringing in the ears vertigo and

194
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,800
dizziness those are just some of them

195
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:41,199
restless leg syndrome creepy crawlies on

196
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,199
the skin sciatic nerve pain back pain

197
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:46,400
neck pain head pain migraines this is

198
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:51,120
all neurological ocd depersonalization

199
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:52,080
bipolar neurological adhd neurological

200
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,360
so

201
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,039
and that's just some of them you guys

202
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,240
that's some of the neurological symptoms

203
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,759
right there

204
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,560
so when it comes down to a central

205
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,319
nervous system issue like fatigue

206
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,080
severe fatigue or any kind of fatigue

207
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,160
that's neurological

208
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,160
we got to make sure that the b12 we get

209
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,240
we're getting enough b12 to the central

210
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,720
nervous system to the brain stem to the

211
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,520
brain to the vagus nerves

212
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,919
so

213
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,759
our vagus nerves require b12 it's what

214
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:19,599
keeps us alive

215
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,520
and so what happens is a lot of people

216
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,360
so let's go into like other problems

217
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,000
that happen so somebody be like well

218
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,520
i'm on a b12

219
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,520
and i'm like well what kind of b12

220
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,680
you're on so i'll tell the doctor well

221
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,880
the doctor be like the doctor i'll talk

222
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,680
to you will be like well i'm giving my

223
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,840
patients aw i'm giving my patients a b12

224
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,759
so can you get the b12 out

225
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,360
not sure sure i'll get the b12 out i

226
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,039
could can you send me a snapshot of that

227
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,800
b12 can you get it out and send a

228
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:47,120
snapshot of that b12

229
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,440
so the doctor will send

230
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,479
a photograph of the b12

231
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,720
okay

232
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,479
and then i'll look at it and then i'll

233
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,479
say can you take a snapshot on the back

234
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,400
with the ingredients

235
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,319
and in the back

236
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,759
it'll say everything there right

237
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,520
including some things that won't say

238
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,360
that are hidden that companies do all

239
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,199
the time vimrgy doesn't do that i'm not

240
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,479
sponsored but i'm just talking about the

241
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:12,000
b12 that i trust the most and

242
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,000
so i'll look in the back of the bottle

243
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,319
it'll be citric acid in there or you'll

244
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,440
see something crazy like a filler or

245
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,840
you'll see

246
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,199
all right you'll see a natural flavoring

247
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,039
in there

248
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,639
you'll see citric acid alcohol you'll

249
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,560
see alcohol in there

250
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,160
you'll see a hidden alcohol

251
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,680
you'll see all kinds of things in there

252
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,680
and i'll be like okay well and then you

253
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,599
won't see the right kind of b12 the

254
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,680
point i'm trying to say is all these

255
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,680
details matter to somebody healing to

256
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,159
somebody actually surviving and healing

257
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,719
and recovering

258
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,320
it's critical to have the right things

259
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,160
so that's one thing i wanted to talk

260
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,000
about the b12 thing another another

261
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,959
thing too people have reactions to b12

262
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,519
when it's all these bad b12s now

263
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:56,160
when someone had b12 shots i just got to

264
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:59,600
tell you guys when someone had b12 shots

265
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,760
they become sensitive to b12

266
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,640
so if they ever had a b12 shot in their

267
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,640
life they could become sensitive to b12

268
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:11,360
and that's when it's critical

269
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:12,399
to have the 5mthf right the methylfolate

270
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,399
so

271
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,320
because what happens is when someone had

272
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,800
b12 shots

273
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,560
a methylation problem occurs with the

274
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,959
b12

275
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:26,080
because they had it they had a shot of

276
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:28,399
b12 so when you have a shot of b12 the

277
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,399
body

278
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,720
starts to

279
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,560
start to identify it as not being a

280
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,120
positive thing

281
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,800
so then you have an allergic reaction

282
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,560
that happens where an antibody actually

283
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,320
gets built up it's that's really what

284
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,399
happens an antibody gets filled up

285
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,959
towards your b12 because if you had the

286
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,600
b12 shot when that happens you don't

287
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,440
methylate b12 and

288
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,680
so a lot of people have difficulties

289
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,200
methylating b12 one reason is because

290
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,200
their liver

291
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,000
is really dysfunctional another reason

292
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,680
is because they had the b12 shots

293
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,760
so when they had to when they had that

294
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,000
in their life and they end up taking b12

295
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,519
they feel like they might react

296
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,200
one of the reasons why the react is

297
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,040
they'll do the wrong b12 one with

298
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,880
alcohol citric acid and add things you

299
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,200
don't know about msg and all that so

300
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,800
they're reacting to the msg

301
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,079
there's no msg in this one this is the

302
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,160
vimergy b12 right v is in victor i m

303
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:24,720
ergy.com if you don't know the company

304
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,880
the point is is that they'll use a b12

305
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,440
somebody will use a b12 and have msg in

306
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,040
there and they'll react

307
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,600
that's one problem another two is they

308
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,680
had b12 shots before

309
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,160
if they had b12 shots before they get

310
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,000
sensitive to b12

311
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,360
so because they they end up having a

312
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,320
difficult

313
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,079
time

314
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,399
methylating their their liver has a

315
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:49,360
difficult time methylating so

316
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,760
that's why i like the 5mthf so

317
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,000
anybody who thinks they have a b12

318
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,200
problem whether they're using a bad b12

319
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,959
and that's one of the reasons why

320
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,240
they're having the problem and using one

321
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,160
that's not good

322
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,160
regardless it's good to take the

323
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,839
methylfolate so if someone thinks they

324
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,640
have a b12 issue it's good to take the

325
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,399
methylfolate at the same time if you

326
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,519
want or you can take it another time ask

327
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,040
your doctor it's right for you i'm just

328
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,399
telling you what i recommend the doctors

329
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,519
i talk to doctors about their patients

330
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,079
all the time

331
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:18,399
chris chris sage says vimergy b12 has

332
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:20,399
gotten me off mattress island

333
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:23,440
carissa

334
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,120
i i gotta tell you something right

335
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,160
all right and you're you're on facebook

336
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,399
okay

337

i can't tell you how many

338
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,360
people

339
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,920
i've seen stuck on mattress island with

340
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,760
neurological symptoms

341
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,720
their life is

342
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,320
limited the quality of life they've lost

343
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,480
they're on mattress island most of the

344
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,680
time in their life and the right kind of

345
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,399
b12

346
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,720
and the right dosage i've seen people

347
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:51,040
turn around in 10 days from being on

348
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,200
mattress island i've talked to doctors

349
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,120
who come to me and be like i got so many

350
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,279
people laying on mattress island what

351
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,480
you call mattress island aw i got so

352
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:02,720
many people on mattress island

353
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,560
and what do i need to do and i'm like

354
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,279
get b12 in every one of them while their

355
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,680
b12 is okay though aw

356
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:12,399
i checked their b12 their b12 seems to

357
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:15,440
be adequate enough in the blood work

358
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:17,680
why are they on mattress island

359
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,160
so get the b12 in them right the right

360
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,880
kind and then the doctor would be like

361
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:25,120
i'm seeing people rise up like from the

362
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,519
grave practically

363
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,200
10 days later 12 days later they're

364
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,959
rising up

365
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,200
they're able to function more they're

366
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:35,120
off a mattress island a little bit more

367
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,120
each day they're using their muscles a

368
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,360
little bit more now they're doing things

369
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,839
in their kitchen they're going they're

370
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,399
they're taking walks outside

371
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:46,560
these details matter

372
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,639
and that's what it's about the details

373
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,480
so that was a little bit about b12 we've

374
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,920
got more to talk about talking about the

375
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,959
central nervous system so here's the key

376
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,120
sugar

377
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:59,360
takes the nutrients

378
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,959
into our cells

379
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,279
right

380
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:06,399
insulin

381
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:08,399
insulin's job the hormone insulins job

382
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,279
is to take sugar

383
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:14,160
in your bloodstream

384
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:16,240
and bring it into the cells so you can

385
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,079
stay alive

386
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,600
because without sugar we die

387
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,279
you guys know that right without sugar

388
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,360
we die

389
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,120
if we don't have a sugar

390
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,480
that enters our cells

391
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,240
we die

392
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,279
our brain

393
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,839
has to have sugar

394
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:37,360
in 10

395
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:39,920
seconds without sugar passing 10 seconds

396
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,000
5 seconds 8 seconds 12 seconds our brain

397
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,399
starts to die

398
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,079
so glucose is critical this is how we

399
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,959
live right

400
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:50,560
it's important to know okay

401
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,639
why do you think a diabetic will go into

402
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,000
a diabetic coma

403
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,560
either something's wrong they don't have

404
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,560
the insulin or they're out of insulin

405
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,320
right or something's or they have

406
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,160
another malfunction right

407
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,240
the malfunction regardless is about

408
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,480
glucose getting to the brain the sugar

409
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,000
goes low to the brain

410
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,839
and that's why a diabetic will be on the

411
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,440
back of a bus or somewhere

412
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,639
or they'll be in a bus somewhere or

413
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,079
somewhere else and they're just going to

414
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,360
be there like this passed out and

415
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,720
they're seizuring

416
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,920
then their tongue's hanging out of their

417
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,199
mouth

418
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,120
and then you've got to put a little

419
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,880
orange juice in their mouth to just get

420
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,399
them out of it a little bit regardless

421
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,880
of where their insulin is i mean i've

422
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:29,760
seen that happen so many times right so

423
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:33,760
you have to get sugar to the brain

424
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,560
so nutrients nutrients enter our cells

425
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,720
through

426
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,480
sugars is what they do

427
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,480
a lot of people are so jacked up on high

428
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,160
fat diets

429
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,839
that they're throwing

430
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,839
they're they're they're not

431
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,399
like they're not getting the nutrients

432
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,279
where they need to be so the b12 is one

433
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,040
of them

434
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,639
now i recommend i was telling a doctor

435
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,079
the other day i still recommend even if

436
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,440
somebody's on a high fat diet to make

437
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:57,519
sure they get the right supplements in

438
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,800
because they can sneak some in some will

439
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,880
mean they'll sneak some of those

440
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,560
nutrients into their cells it'll get

441
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,880
there

442
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,079
but for maximum healing you take

443
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,480
somebody on mattress island with

444
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:10,800
neurological problems that are suffering

445
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:14,399
you lower their fats and you get the

446
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,440
right b12 in them

447
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,680
and

448
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,160
you got a chance now

449
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,600
every day i i think about it like how

450
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,120
does anybody stand a chance of healing

451
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,320
with the misinformation out there for

452
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,560
one

453
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,079
how many people are derailed

454
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,320
from getting the right information so

455
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:32,160
they don't even stand a chance to heal

456
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,600
they'll never stand a chance to heal

457
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,279
yeah you heard it from me they will

458
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,040
never heal

459
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,720
there's people out there that will never

460
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,399
heal because

461
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,160
the the information

462
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,600
it's derailed before it even gets to

463
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,480
them or they just don't learn it or

464
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,320
there's so much misinformation out there

465
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,000
they don't understand b12 or how it

466
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,240
works they don't know about the right

467
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,079
things they'll never heal

468
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,079
they'll go to doctor doctor specialist

469
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,920
especially should crown round around

470
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:00,480
forever and they will never get their

471
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:03,920
life back and that's sad

472
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,920
that happens all the time

473
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:09,040
so

474
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,880
you know someone said the other day i

475
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,800
think that they actually said the other

476
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,639
day in the comments section right like

477
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,519
oh there he goes with supplements again

478
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,519
okay well okay

479
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,120
okay

480
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,519
it's better

481
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,519
to know why you're sick and how to heal

482
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,959
and supplements are a critical way of

483
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,480
doing that

484
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:30,720
or do you want to just keep on going

485
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,600
around okay let me

486
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:36,000
buy a 50 000 oxygen hyperbaric oxygen

487
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,079
chamber which don't work they don't work

488
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,759
they've been around forever

489
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,600
and people pouring into my office for

490
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,920
years i tried everything

491
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,839
they purchased auction you know chambers

492
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,880
all of it it's cute it's a great idea

493
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,800
but no

494
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,440
it doesn't work

495
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,360
you know um go to another doctor and

496
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,519
keep on pumping ozone therapy inside of

497
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,920
you over and over and over again

498
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,199
which i don't recommend

499
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,519
you know

500
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:03,199
keep on going around okay let's go cold

501
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,679
punching now let's see if that can fix

502
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:07,280
it all right let's go try a rife machine

503
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,640
let's see if that will fix this how many

504
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,039
times those things just ended up in

505
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,079
people's closets it's

506
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:15,360
and

507
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:17,839
that crap gets expensive

508
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,120
real expensive and it still doesn't fix

509
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:21,199
things and that's what i mean over and

510
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,720
over again oh grab an alkaline ionizer

511
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,240
water machine and poison yourself it

512
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,880
doesn't work

513
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,960
let's get a 5 000 alkaline ionizer water

514
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,840
machine let's do that

515
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,520
right

516
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,440
and

517
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:37,200
people don't realize

518
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:39,600
you know it's their simple

519
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,400
strong basic details

520
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,880
of how to get people out of the muck and

521
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,760
out of the darkness and into the light

522
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,760
of healing there's ways to do it

523
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,559
and using the right supplementation is a

524
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:54,640
critical way to do it it's part of it

525
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:57,280
sabine said

526
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,280

so we'll go into some more more about

542
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,360
the supplements a little bit

543
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,200
so cat's claw i want to talk about cat's

check this out you guys

546
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,919
years ago

547
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,600
years ago at different times in my life

548
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:45,280
when i had an office and people all

549
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,559
around the world came to see me

550
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:51,520
recommended by their doctors okay

551
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:52,880
right so let's just go back to any time

552
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,000
frame i've been doing this which is

553
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:59,039
decades since the 1990s people would

554
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,039
come to my office

555
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,880
right after seeing specialists after

556
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,880
specialist after specialist not have a

557
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,720
clue to why they were sick with their

558
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,880
neurological symptoms and sickness and

559
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,919
fatigue and everything right

560
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,440
and i would have all these herbs on my

561
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,320
shelf

562
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,320
all these herbs

563
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,240
and spirit of compassion would say they

564
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,440
need cat's claw

565
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,160
right

566
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,039
so i'd go and get the glass jar off the

567
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,440
shelf

568
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:29,919
like this

569
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,919
i would start up some tea

570
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,480
right there in my office

571
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,559
get some hot water going i'd get the

572
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,559
cat's claw out and the cat's claw would

573
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:41,039
be a dried cat's claw

574
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,240
sitting in a glass

575
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:45,600
jar

576
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,360
i would take the cat's claw out

577
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,559
and i would put it in the hot water and

578
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:52,720
steep it right in front of the person

579
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:54,960
and be like what's that okay it's cat's

580
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,960
claw

581
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,919
and then

582
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,440
have them sip it

583
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,320
right there

584
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,360
and i

585
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,720
i

586
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:07,280
and it wasn't the best cat's claw

587
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,280
it was survival

588
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,520
cat's claw

589
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,120
it helped

590
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,960
it was amazing

591
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:18,240
that i had some

592
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:20,240
no one knew about it

593
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,720
and when i think about where we are

594
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,559
today when like the cat's claw that's in

595
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,280
my hands right now

596
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:29,520
if i had this back then

597
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,840
i could have speeded up so many people's

598
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:34,240
healing processes

599
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,960
yeah it helped him when i took the cat's

600
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,640
claw out of the glass jar and i made

601
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:44,320
them a cat's claw tee right there in my

602
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:46,159
office whether it's 1994 or 1997 or 1999

603
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,440
at different times in different people

604
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,280
when spirit of compassion said this

605
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,799
would be really good for them and it was

606
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,400
beneficial

607
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:54,000
and their doctor would call me up their

608
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,799
doctor would come to my office the

609
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,840
doctor would sit there

610
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,720
and even as far as back as the 80s

611
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:04,240
right

612
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,240
and so the point is

613
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,799
that if i had something like this at my

614
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,360
ready

615
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:13,360
at their ready

616
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,960
i could have gotten so many more people

617
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,720
faster

618
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,039
and you know because it took more time

619
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,799
to use the dry cat's claw the best stuff

620
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,799
i could find at the time back all the

621
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,600
way decades ago

622
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,720
and

623
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,640
i didn't have the option so what i what

624
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,080
i realized in the supplement world is

625
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,000
there's so much crap out there and

626
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,880
there's so much

627
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,960
just junk and misinformation

628
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,880
and i think about it you know that

629
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,559
people they don't even know they just

630
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,600
take things for granted they don't even

631
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,720
know

632
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:47,280
like what what kind of blessings we have

633
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,120
that we're so lucky to have here if i

634
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:51,679
was suffering from neurological lyme

635
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,520
myself personally if i had all these

636
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,600
this fatigue and aches and pains and i

637
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,360
had tingles and numbness and i was

638
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,559
suffering and i had inflammation

639
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,080
throughout my body and i had

640
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:02,720
neurological symptoms because of the

641
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,159
epstein-barr virus because that's behind

642
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,000
that's actually behind neurological

643
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:09,600
lines shingles doesn't help either and

644
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,120
say i had all these viral issues

645
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,120
right

646
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:16,240
and i had something at the ready at this

647
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:18,799
my at my disposal like this and a

648
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,880
quality like this

649
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,480
i mean it's just a miracle is what i'm

650
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,400
trying to say

651
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,559
and that's that's the kind of thing that

652
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,559
counts that's the cat's claw right there

653
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:30,640
so with cat's claw

654
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:33,520
and i tell doctors all the time

655
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,360
is your patient on cat's claw

656
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,840
and they'll be like well well i don't

657
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,440
know there was a cat's call capsule that

658
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,960
i could always try to get them on or

659
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,919
something like that

660
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,320
be like

661
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:46,159
that's not that's not the answer

662
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,120
i want to hear your patience on cat's

663
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,360
claw

664
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,720
if you want to get your patients better

665
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,640
you know when it comes down to the

666
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,240
neurological line neurological symptoms

667
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,080
you don't even have to have a lyme tag

668
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,679
it's autoimmune

669
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,640
just autoimmune

670
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,240
right

671
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,480
and then it matters about the right kind

672
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,559
of cat's claw someone will have a cat's

673
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:08,400
claw it'll just have alcohol in it it'll

674
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:10,559
be ripped to shreds inside the nutrients

675
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,000
it can constitute all the nutrients

676
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:14,480
would be literally

677
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,799
damaged from the alcohol

678
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,600
and so you'll have all these issues

679
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:21,440
with the different cats claws out there

680
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,520
or dehydrated

681
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:27,280
capsulated

682
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:30,159
cat's claw it just doesn't work right

683
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:32,159
and the low potency and the low ratio

684
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:34,000
and the low low quality all of it

685
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,200
combined with the fillers and everything

686
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,720
else

687
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,600
basically what happens when we have

688
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,520
something at our disposal and

689
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,559
let me make something clear right here

690
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,120
right now

691
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:47,760
medical meeting information and tools is

692
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:50,240
as basic as just celery juice

693
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,360
and see how your problems go away

694
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,880
they're not going away and they're

695
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,039
sticking and you're only getting some

696
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,360
things better you stay with your celery

697
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:59,200
and then we move forward

698
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,440
and then it's now the heavy metal detox

699
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,960
smoothie i'm cleaning things up but if

700
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,799
you're somebody that's got

701
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,200
a lot of bugs and see you've got the

702
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:10,720
shingles and the cmv and you got the ebv

703
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,559
and you got the hh v6 and you're sick

704
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,720
and you got the streptococcus causing

705
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:18,400
all kinds of acne and crazy stuff and

706
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:20,400
utis with it all if you're sick

707
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,840
it may not just be celery juice being

708
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,960
enough for you

709
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,960
i've never been one to jump in heavy in

710
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,559
anything in the sense where you got to

711
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,240
do all these supplements and this is

712
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,520
what you got to do no start with celery

713
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,240
juice is fine

714
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:37,200
but just don't complain that you're not

715
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:39,039
getting better and you've tried mmm and

716
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,039
you did it all when you didn't and you

717
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:44,559
just did some celery juice because

718
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:47,279
there's so many more places you can go

719
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:50,480
so many more directions you can go into

720
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:52,640
customizing so it's like

721
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,720
you can start as at the beginning with

722
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,440
celery juice but you know the cat's

723
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,440
claws here if you're really struggling

724
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,840
let's see hannah says i take cat's claw

725
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,559
among other ones you have here they are

726
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:07,200
really moving the needle for me my fibro

727
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:08,159
has reduced immensely so what happens

728
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,559
with

729
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,919
lexi what happens with fibro is you're

730
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,960
dealing with the epstein-barr virus

731
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,400
right

732
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,840
i talk about that and i teach that to

733
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,279
doctors all the time see i've seen bar

734
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,120
virus creating fibromyalgia that's

735
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:21,600
original medical medium information now

736
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:24,240
science is talking about that now

737
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,080
and that's medical medium signs versus

738
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,080
that stuff out there so science is now

739
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:30,240
talking about hey epstein bars you know

740
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:32,000
creates fibromyalgia now

741
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:35,279
cat's claw

742
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,279
synapsing bar killer

743
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:40,799
epstein bar creates neurological lyme fc

744
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:42,400
bar creates multiple sclerosis

745
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:44,000
and just so you know all those articles

746
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,559
you see out there now about epstein-barr

747
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,960
creating ms i published it seven years

748
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,960
before

749
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:54,000
seven years before it was published okay

750
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:56,720
about the cause of multiple sclerosis

751
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,080
and taught years before that by me and

752
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,919
lectures

753
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,760
and and teaching doctors and so forth

754
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,120
about the cause of ms but the point is

755
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,200
with any symptoms you may be somebody

756
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,320
that's like i don't have ms aw i don't

757
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,720
have

758
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:11,039
neurological lyme a doctor says you know

759
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,080
i might have autoimmune

760
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,320
yeah

761
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:16,159
you got the autoimmune or you've got

762
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,279
your symptoms whatever symptoms those

763
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,880
are

764
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:21,760
so cat's cause one of those things where

765
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:24,799
i've always seen this as a miracle

766
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:26,880
i i saw it as a miracle going back years

767
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:29,600
ago in my office when i would take the

768
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:32,240
dried cat's claw out and make the person

769
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,679
a tea right there

770
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,679
and they would sit there and they'd be

771
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:37,120
sipping this cat's claw or they'd be

772
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:41,840
sitting there with their doctor and

773
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:41,840
they're both sipping the cat's claw

774
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,480
and

775
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,400
if i knew because you know everybody's

776
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,840
at their own free will the world has its

777
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,960
own free will

778
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:55,360
if i knew years and years later

779
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,600
that we'd have a cat's claw

780
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:00,000
at the ready in our hand

781
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:02,720
that's better than anything i've used

782
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,960
all these years i just i'd be blown away

783
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,799
and i am blown away

784
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,960
definitely now we have stronger bugs

785
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:10,480
today too than we did years before and

786
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,000
that's a problem we're up against we've

787
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,480
got stronger bugs we've got stronger

788
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,559
ebv's we got stronger shingles we got

789
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,720
more toxic heavy metals we cut more

790
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:21,039
chemicals we're up against all the time

791
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,200
so we're up against more than we ever

792
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:26,000
were up against before so what that

793
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:29,120
means is oh my blood tests just fine

794
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,840
with my b12 i don't need any b12

795
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:34,640
the doctor said my blood test is fine

796
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:37,039
the world has changed

797
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,760
did you know that the level that they

798
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:42,880
actually depict as being fine

799
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:46,080
the window of where the b12 needs to be

800
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:50,720
on the blood test is from the 1920s

801
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:52,480
did you know that the 1920s

802
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,080
so everybody's walking around now with

803
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,080
all kinds of different elevated al

804
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,840
epstein bars they got the herpes simplex

805
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:00,840
one and two they get cytomegalovirus

806
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,399
they got hpv they got hiv they got

807
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,760
aids

808
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,960
they're walking around with all this

809
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,200
stuff

810
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:10,000
toxic heavy metals lots of chemicals and

811
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:13,200
we're using the b12 level

812
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,159
that was a theory as being the right b12

813
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,760
level

814
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,720
in 1920. so what you see on your blood

815
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:22,720
work

816
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:26,000
is 1920s depiction of a group of doctors

817
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:27,200
in in the science world in 1920

818
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,840
that

819
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:32,480
believe that was where the b12 level

820
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:35,679
should be at and that's what we we rely

821
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:38,399
on we rely on something from 1920 from

822
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:40,159
guesswork to where your b12 needs to be

823
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:42,559
on blood on the blood test

824
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,640
not to what we're up against today in

825
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:47,200
the world we're up against fighting what

826
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:49,279
we're fighting against

827
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,440
trying to heal people on mattress island

828
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:53,279
everybody falling ill we know how

829
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,399
everybody's falling ill now and getting

830
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:57,919
there and so with all that in the flues

831
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:00,000
too that we're up against now and

832
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:02,080
everything else that we keep on getting

833
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,159
hit with

834
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,960
that we're going to then go by the

835
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:08,799
gold standard of 1920 from some

836
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,799
guesswork that that's where your b12

837
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:12,960
level is supposed to be at and if you do

838
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,880
go by that fine

839
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,720
but is it even getting into the cells

840
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,039
it's another thing too so anyways going

841
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,640
back to the 5mthf right

842
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:23,600
so that's the methylfolate right there

843
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,960
it helps with the methylation so

844
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,600
the incredible thing about like the

845
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:30,240
vimergy products like the vimergy b12 it

846
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,640
needs less of the

847
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:35,279
methylation that's what's amazing right

848
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:38,159
there right it needs less

849
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:40,000
of methylation other b12s that won't

850
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:41,840
even get into cells there's so many

851
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,640
b-12s out of there that won't even budge

852
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:46,399
into cells right the vimergy b12 is the

853
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,399
right blend of adenosine cobalamin and

854
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:50,240
methylcobalamin and then when you and

855
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:52,480
that alone

856
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,320
actually beats out methylation issues

857
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,880
but then if you're somebody that had all

858
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,159
these b12 shots and all these issues

859
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,440
you might want to ask your doctor hey

860
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:02,799
can i take the methyl methylfolate right

861
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,720
and this is the stuff that i recommend

862
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:06,240
friends and family people who come to me

863
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,399
doctors that talk to me about stuff like

864
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,600
that so let's move on to something else

865
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,720
so i'm just talking about a couple of

866
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,279
these things right there let's talk

867
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,760
about melatonin

868
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,760
right here

869
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:20,320
so on youtube

870
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,880
okay venislav says

871
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,480
i healed from a tough ear infection

872
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:27,120
after three months on medical medium

873
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:30,320
protocols and lifestyles lifestyle thank

874
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:32,399
you aw and soc this this is life saving

875
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,080
amazing honor to have you here truly and

876
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:36,000
i'm glad you're doing better and feeling

877
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,320
so much better so i'm talking about

878
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,120
melatonin right now

879
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,399
melatonin is really interesting okay

880
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,559
because first of all

881
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:48,080
it's an antioxidant and that's what it

882
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:49,679
is but an antioxidant that goes to the

883
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:52,480
brain

884
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:55,039
which is why i like melatonin right

885
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:57,039
so one of the things about melatonin

886
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:59,039
i'll show your brain right here

887
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:01,279
one of the things i like is it slows

888
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:03,360
down angiogenesis

889
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:06,960
right so it slows down

890
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:09,919
blood vessels growing from growths blood

891
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:12,559
vessels growing from tumors and cysts

892
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:15,519
and growths and stuff like that okay so

893
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:17,360
i really really love melatonin for that

894
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:20,159
reason alone but for mental health

895
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:22,559
conditions i love melatonin greatly

896
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:25,200
because it is an antioxidant

897
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:28,320
that has a different access to the brain

898
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:31,200
and brain stem so antioxidants all

899
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:33,039
antioxidants have a different pathway

900
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:36,480
into our body

901
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:40,640
an antioxidant from one source

902
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:42,000
a polyphenol anthocyanin from one source

903
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,679
will enter

904
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,120
the body in a different way organs in

905
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:48,320
the body and glands in a different way

906
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:50,159
than some other antioxidant source will

907
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,919
do when it comes down to a hormone

908
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:53,919
antioxidant like

909
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:57,120
melatonin

910
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:59,840
a brain hormone antioxidant it's easy

911
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:02,399
access through blood brain barrier it's

912
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,760
easy access and that's what i love about

913
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:05,600
it okay

914
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,840
audrey's antler says but doesn't

915
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:10,159
melatonin mess up your hormones it does

916
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,440
not has nothing to do with estrogen has

917
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:13,760
nothing to do

918
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,760
with anything of that sore has nothing

919
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:18,480
to do with testosterone

920
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:20,559
has nothing to do with epinephrine has

921
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,240
nothing to do with adrenal hormones has

922
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:24,320
nothing to do with thyroid hormones or

923
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,440
any of the sort or any of that there is

924
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,720
no

925
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,440
science

926
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:32,320
that has showcased that it does

927
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:34,399
okay that was an attack a while back on

928
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:37,840
melatonin because melatonin is very

else to do

1006
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,599
is

1007
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:35,040

1008
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:36,800
an

1009
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,320
announcement

1010
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,839
i'm hoping

1011
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,839

1012
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:47,359
and i'm excited so i got to surprise you

1013
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:49,200
guys beginning this week but anyway

1014
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:50,640
the point is is the reason why like why

1015
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:53,680
would i take this much if i don't have a

1016
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:56,960
health problem because i burn the candle

1017
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:59,119
at four ends i work 20 hour days i work

1018
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:02,320
22 hour days

1019
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:04,160
i work 18 hour days 19 hour days i work

1020
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:06,800
seven days a week i haven't taken a

1021
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:08,240
vacation in decades

1022
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,400
so

1023
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:12,320
that's what i do

1024
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,160
i work for god i work for the

1025
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:16,480
chronically ill

1026
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,839
i don't work for myself

1027
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,560
i work for god and i work for the

1028
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:23,359
chronically ill and when you do that

1029
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:26,079
you don't put yourself first

1030
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:28,000
so i don't do self-care i want everybody

1031
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:29,280
else to do self-care i want you guys to

1032
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,400
be into self-care i want you to take

1033
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,760
care of yourselves it's critical okay

1034
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,480
but

1035
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,920
what i do is something different

1036
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,280
so

1037
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,599
i push

1038
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:44,720
the pedal to the metal

1039
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:44,720
i step on the gas

1040
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:49,280
and i drive fast in life

1041
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,680
not literally in a car because driving

1042
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:54,320
fast is bad in a car don't do it

1043
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:57,920
the bottom line is so what i like to do

1044
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:59,599
is i like to protect myself because

1045
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,920
if anybody actually looked at my

1046
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:04,560
schedule and looked at my life and saw

1047
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:07,920
in my personal life how hard i work and

1048
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:10,400
how many years and how and what i do

1049
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,839
they would be scared for my life

1050
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,160
and so what i do because spirit

1051
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:16,000
compassion says take care of yourself

1052
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:18,640
make sure you're getting that

1053
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,119
antioxidant in your brain make sure your

1054
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:23,280
your b12 is cranked up because of what

1055
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:25,760
you do make sure you take care of

1056
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,760
yourself

1057
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,880
so that's what i do i try to take care

1058
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,040
of myself where i can like the easiest

1059
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:35,200
way i can so what brand of melatonin

1060
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:38,359
roxanne says that's vimergy

1061
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:41,599
it's v is in victor i m as in mary

1062
00:37:38,359 --> 00:37:43,680

1063
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:46,960

stuff there is

1069
00:37:54,720 --> 00:38:00,400
hands down it's the best does it make a

1070
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:02,079
difference when you have good stuff

1071
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,800
it makes a difference

1072
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:06,400
huge one it moves the needle and that's

1073
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,599
the difference right there

1074
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,040

00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:10,240

00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:21,200
world we're heading into a world where

1112
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,520
that's going to be more and more

1113
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,960
obvious happening in people's lives

1114
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,320
doctors are going to be hearing about it

1115
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,839
all the time

1116
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,839
so

1117
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:32,960
what i love about

1118
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:35,119
ashwagandha is ashwagandha does help the

1119
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,839
adrenals and it helps

1120
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:40,400
the adrenals restore

1121
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:41,599
which is a big part of why women have

1122
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,200
hair loss

1123
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:45,200
so

1124
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,440
so when it comes down to your adrenals

1125
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:49,440
they get weak and there's dosages in the

1126
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,960
book on that too like if you know if you

1127
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,240
have a cleanse to heal here's a cleanse

1128
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,760
the heel right here i show you the

1129
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,119
dosages and all that and cleanse the

1130
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,200
heel

1131
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:59,200
so in this life right here with the

1132
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:02,160
stress that women are under

1133
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:03,839
and men too and men too but the stress

1134
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,640
that women are under

1135
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:08,160
right

1136
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:11,040
like women's hair follicles depend on

1137
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:14,160
how strong their adrenals are because

1138
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:16,720
there's a hormone in their adrenal blend

1139
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:18,720
that keeps the hair follicle healthy and

1140
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,599
alive

1141
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,200
so

1142
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:23,680
when

1143
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:25,680
and you don't even have to have fatigue

1144
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:28,079
to have an adrenal problem you could be

1145
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:30,800
missing one of the adrenal hormones

1146
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:32,400
or be really low on it and then the hair

1147
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,680
starts falling out so if you're

1148
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,119
especially if you're up against stress

1149
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:37,839
or any kind of

1150
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:39,520
any kind of emotional

1151
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:42,800
so what happens is with a lot of women

1152
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:45,200
is they'll have a difficult relationship

1153
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:47,760
difficult friendship they'll have

1154
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:50,000
you know financial stress they'll have

1155
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:52,000
a divorce they'll have

1156
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,040
all kinds of other issues that happen in

1157
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,720
their life and then a year later the

1158
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:59,359
hair just starts pouring off their head

1159
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:01,520
like it's just coming out in droves it's

1160
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:03,359
in the shower it's on the shower floor

1161
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:05,119
it's everywhere it's in their hands and

1162
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:06,640
they brush it they just brush their hair

1163
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:08,480
and it's just filled and filling the

1164
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:10,160
brush and it's this

1165
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,480
it's like what feels to be like a

1166
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:14,079
tragedy as they're pulling out all the

1167
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,560
hair out of their brush and they have

1168
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:18,319
hair all over their sink and it becomes

1169
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,800
this thing where that all of a sudden

1170
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:23,040
becomes tremendous amounts of ptsd and

1171
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:26,319
stress as hair is just going everywhere

1172
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:27,760
and falling everywhere so

1173
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:29,200
family member reached out to me that has

1174
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,119
a best friend the best friend's just

1175
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:34,000
losing all their hair and she's just

1176
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:36,079
losing it's everywhere and like aw what

1177
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,680
do i do it's like ashwagandha that's the

1178
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:40,079
first thing make sure you've got enough

1179
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:41,359
ashwagandha

1180
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:44,079
and she was like well no i tried

1181
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:45,280
ashwagandha she tried ashwagandha well

1182
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:46,960
what kind

1183
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:49,119
and she was doing these ashwagandha

1184
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,720
capsules

1185
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:53,040
and then she switched and she used this

1186
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:54,240
ashwagandha and the hair started to slow

1187
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:56,240
down

1188
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:58,000
so it does make a difference when it's

1189
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,760
the right stuff right

1190
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,119
that's one another thing i said are you

1191
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:04,000
on b12

1192
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:06,800
like well there's b12 in my multivitamin

1193
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,880
so what this family member's friend said

1194
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,440
to me is there's b12 in their

1195
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:13,520
multivitamin and that should be enough

1196
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,280
and there's b12 in their hair skin and

1197
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:18,480
nails vitamin and that should be enough

1198
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:20,480
i said it's not enough it's not enough

1199
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,800
it's that much b12 and it's not even a

1200
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:25,200
good quality one so the b12 in the

1201
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:27,760
multivitamin is just only a smidgen it's

1202
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,599
not even a good one

1203
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:32,560
and it's just not enough

1204
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:35,359
well what do you suggest a w

1205
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:37,680
boom four dropper fulls of b12 a day two

1206
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:39,520
dropper holes twice a day and you do

1207
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,680
your ashwagandha

1208
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:43,440
and then boom less hair was falling out

1209
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,200
less hair was falling out and then it

1210
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:47,040
stopped

1211
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,800
and this person's hair was just falling

1212
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,400
out for quite a while and they went to

1213
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,760
all their functional medicine doctors

1214
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,599
and they were trying this and they're on

1215
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:56,960
hair skin nail formulas and they were

1216
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:58,960
doing this and it wasn't enough

1217
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:01,599
so anyway talking about ashwagandha for

1218
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,800
the adrenals strengthening the adrenals

1219
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:05,760
right

1220
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:07,920
i take ashwagandha i take it every night

1221
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:10,160
so what i do with ashwagandha

1222
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,160
right

1223
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:16,160
is do three dropper falls now with b12

1224
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:17,839
you don't have to do it in your mouth

1225
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,119
you can do it in water and have it in

1226
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:20,640
shot glass i'm just letting you guys

1227
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:22,240
know a lot of people are like well what

1228
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,599
about the b12 just put it in your mouth

1229
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,280
have it under your tongue you don't have

1230
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:27,200
to it's a bunch of dropper folds right

1231
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,359
there of ashwagandha

1232
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,359
so

1233
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,720
that's what i'll do at night

1234
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:35,040
right

1235
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:37,599
but i love that question why am i taking

1236
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,480
anything if nothing's wrong with me

1237
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:40,560
well

1238
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,880
i think if someone and i had a doctor

1239
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:45,839
tell me this a surgeon said that the

1240
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:48,720
hours i work if they did those hours

1241
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:51,200
they would literally need a sabbatical

1242
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:53,680
a year off so what i like to do is i

1243
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:56,960
like to keep the engine going so i use

1244
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:59,520
all the good stuff to do it

1245
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:01,040
i take all the good stuff away take away

1246
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:03,359
the cleanses the the medical mean

1247
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:05,200
cleanses that i like to do take away the

1248
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:07,040
mono eating cleanse which i love to do

1249
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:08,560
every now and then switch off and do

1250
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:11,119
that take away

1251
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:12,319
spirit of compassion's information

1252
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:15,440
put me on

1253
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:18,240
just whatever diet or keto diet or put

1254
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:21,520

1255
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:23,920
or a keto diet animal protein take away

1256
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:26,079
you know all all my access to all the

1257
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:28,319
best stuff and supplements and yeah if

1258
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:30,720
i'm doing 20 hours a day i could start

1259
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:32,960
probably getting some problems

1260
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:35,040
you know like adrenals can start getting

1261
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,880
worn down and beat up central nervous

1262
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:38,160
system needs fuel i mean you know so

1263
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,920
it's all these things that are so

1264
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,200
critical take away my celery juice and

1265
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,839
yeah

1266
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:45,599
i'm a human being and if you work 20

1267
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:47,280
hours a day and you push

1268
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:49,359
push

1269
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:52,000
push it that hard you can actually get

1270
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:53,760
yourself in trouble so i do my 32 ounces

1271
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,000
of celery juice every single morning i

1272
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:57,760
do my heavy metal detox smoothie because

1273
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,839
we're always getting all kinds of

1274
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:01,680
you know contamination with heavy metals

1275
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:02,880
everywhere it's in the air it's

1276
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,640
everywhere

1277
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,640
you know if i stop doing my heavy metal

1278
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:08,640
detox smoothie and my celery juice and i

1279
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:11,040
stop doing the things that protect me

1280
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:13,280
and the b12 that i take every day and

1281
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,319
the propolis and the zinc

1282
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,839
right

1283
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:17,119
then yeah

1284
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:20,000
there could be a problem that could

1285
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:21,359
develop i'm a human being i'm not super

1286
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,839
natural

1287
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:26,240
human to superhuman or something you

1288
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:27,200
know not a superhero

1289
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:29,280
um

1290
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:33,359
anna says anna says why does stomach get

1291
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:35,520
upset when you take so many at one time

1292
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:36,560
well i don't ever get an upset stomach

1293
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,880
right

1294
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:40,400
so i can take a whole bunch at once if

1295
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,839
you're somebody you know you could be

1296
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:44,000
somebody already

1297
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:45,280
here's here's the thing too so be your

1298
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,920
own detective

1299
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:49,680
your stomach never gets upset ever

1300
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,520
so only when you take a bunch of

1301
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:53,760
supplements at once like it never gets

1302
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:55,599
upset like you don't have a history like

1303
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:58,160
ask yourself do i have a history of my

1304
00:45:55,599 --> 00:46:01,760
stomach getting upset when i

1305
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:03,839
had popcorn and i ate this or i did this

1306
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:05,760
do i get have i ever been to a doctor

1307
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:07,599
about acid reflux have you ever been to

1308
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:10,160
a doctor about my stomach being upset

1309
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:12,560
like be your own detective and realize

1310
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:14,480
that it's not the supplements

1311
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:16,480
that make them upset

1312
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:18,240
unless it's something like you took a

1313
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:20,560
vitamin c that's straight ascorbic acid

1314
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:22,560
which is like battery acid right so you

1315
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:24,640
took a vitamin c i don't have the microc

1316
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:27,280
right here in front of me but you took a

1317
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:29,440
vitamin c that's like straight ascorbic

1318
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,960
acid and you have a sensitive stomach

1319
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:33,839
then yeah you're going to burn a hole in

1320
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:35,599
your stomach from bad vitamin c's

1321
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:37,280
there's vitamin c's in those packets you

1322
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:38,560
know those little packets everybody goes

1323
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,319
into the store they're like oh i'm going

1324
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:43,520
to grab some of those vitamin c packets

1325
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:45,920
right there that's straight battery acid

1326
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:47,760
straight but i saw i actually saw a what

1327
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:50,000
is a commercial on youtube for those

1328
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:52,079
just recently or something like that

1329
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,480
and i'm like oh great yeah

1330
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:56,400
put 10 million dollars into advertising

1331
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,599
advertising that battery acid in a

1332
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,359
packet

1333
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:01,119
right so you know

1334
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:03,040
and if you got a sensitive stomach it's

1335
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:05,359
things like that that can really

1336
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:07,280
aggravate that stomach

1337
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:08,720
but people that you know and you know

1338
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,400
people have inflamed nerves in the

1339
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:13,599
stomach so if they have inflamed nerves

1340
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:17,119
in the stomach if they have

1341
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:17,119
if someone has um

1342
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:26,160
someone has a sensitive nervous system

1343
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:28,640
nerves going to the stomach

1344
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:31,119
if someone has

1345
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:32,559
an ulcer and they don't know it right

1346
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:35,599
they might have an ulcer and they

1347
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:35,599
actually don't know it

1348
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,559
okay

1349
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,760
so

1350
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:41,520
that means you're gonna be sensitive

1351
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:43,280
with other things too so if you're

1352
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,960
someone that never went to a doctor or

1353
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:46,800
never complained about a stomach problem

1354
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,400
ever and you're taking a bunch of

1355
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,400
supplements and it's giving you a tummy

1356
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,920
ache make sure they're the right kind

1357
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,520
make sure they're high quality make sure

1358
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,880
there's no alcohol in those supplements

1359
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:56,720
make sure there's no

1360
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:58,800
all the fillers and crazy fillers and

1361
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:02,000
citric acid citric acid in a supplement

1362
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:04,400
will just burn the burn the heck out of

1363
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,079
the stomach lining

1364
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:07,680
i mean the vimergy stuff's not like that

1365
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:09,760
so i just want to make that clear so

1366
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:11,119
that's not like that and if for some

1367
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,880
reason you're somebody because you have

1368
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:14,160
stomach problems then you take it slow

1369
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,440
and you do a little bit at a time ask

1370
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:17,760
your doctor what's right for you that's

1371
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:20,480
what i would tell a family member

1372
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:23,040
when someone's sensitive they could

1373
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,720
think you know they can take less and

1374
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:26,240
then have it with foods it's another

1375
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:27,760
thing too like if someone's really

1376
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:29,200
sensitive because they have sensitive

1377
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:31,280
stomach issues and they want to take a

1378
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:34,240
little bit of b12 or something you take

1379
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:36,000
it with food and you take less

1380
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:37,599
right

1381
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,000

1384
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,000

and

1386
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:49,760
when it comes down to supplementation

1387
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:52,000
there's so many bad versions out there

1388
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,920
that they can create a scar in

1389
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,920
somebody's life with supplements so then

1390
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:58,960
someone is someone's taking so many bad

1391
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:00,880

that were with alcohol or herbal powders

1395
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:10,960

they have these bad experiences and that

1397
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:16,000
doesn't help right now you don't have to

1398
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:17,520
take supplements to heal depending on

1399
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,920

that their patients can put them all in

1424
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:12,960
the same thing because a lot of people

1425
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:14,640
are sick so what they'll do is they

1426
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:16,400
don't have the energy to do it

1427
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:18,240

would do personally or for my

1432
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:27,680
friends or family right and then you add

1433
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:29,599

1478
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,240
april taft's asking about dr nesbit i'm

1479
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:04,000
hoping he's doing good i haven't heard

1480
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:05,760
from dr nesbit in a little while and

1481
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,520
that scares me because he could be on a

1482
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:09,599
drinking binge

1483
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:11,440
and uh i know he said he had a tough

1484
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:15,760
week of surgeries and sometimes he just

1485
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:18,400
disappears and i hope he's not

1486
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:20,640
slaying around with too much alcohol in

1487
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:23,599
a system so i will check on dr nesbit

1488
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:26,720
when i can i love you guys

1489
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:30,839
and i am heading off to ig in a little

1490
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:30,839
bit so i'll see you soon
