[52.72 - 58.68] happens with a lot of people is they're
[55.36 - 61.28] battling bloating constipation other
[58.68 - 63.72] things too loose St not loose dos then
[61.28 - 66.52] it's constipation then it's back or it's
[63.72 - 69.32] just straight straight plain old
[66.52 - 72.56] bloating and that's what it is so we're
[69.32 - 74.96] talking about some cool stuff right here
[72.56 - 76.60] now I know a lot of people they fight to
[74.96 - 79.32] get their bloating down they get the
[76.60 - 80.88] lymphatic drainage lymphatic massage
[79.32 - 82.16] they get their stomachs worked on so
[80.88 - 83.96] that's a big thing right now everybody
[82.16 - 86.08] goes in and someone's working on their
[83.96 - 88.08] stomach now they're using machines on
[86.08 - 89.92] their stomachs right to try to get the
[88.08 - 92.40] bloating down and then right when it's
[89.92 - 95.60] it's like getting a new haircut okay you
[92.40 - 98.12] get a brand new haircut it's perfect you
[95.60 - 102.04] love what you're seeing you walk out of
[98.12 - 103.88] the the salon and then some wind hits
[102.04 - 105.24] you hop in your car you're like it's

[112.20 - 117.08] and your hair is not what you wanted it
[115.00 - 119.32] to be it's not where it was when you

[119.32 - 122.36] thing you you go get your stomach worked
[121.00 - 123.68] on you get your lymphatic drainage
[122.36 - 126.20] worked on you're getting your stomach
[123.68 - 128.12] just right then you walk out of there
[126.20 - 131.12] and you're like okay my stomach's down
[128.12 - 134.28] and then you sip some water or you drink
[131.12 - 136.32] something whatever that is and then boom
[134.28 - 138.68] it's back for a lot of people or you
[136.32 - 141.04] just start seeing it slowly coming back
[138.68 - 143.00] then next day it's slowly coming back
[141.04 - 145.72] Third Day fourth day you're bloated
[143.00 - 147.36] again you got the distension you're
[145.72 - 149.36] stuck you're back to where you were so
[147.36 - 151.04] let's talk about like true true causes
[149.36 - 155.52] if you're fighting any kind of bloating
[151.04 - 158.20] at all any kind of bloating at all you
[155.52 - 160.60] got to go to your liver liver that's
[158.20 - 163.04] right doesn't mean eat liver you don't
[160.60 - 164.76] want to eat liver to fix your bloating
[163.04 - 166.64] because that's not going to fix it
[164.76 - 168.28] because people talk about that stuff too
[166.64 - 170.92] they'll try anything it's all about
[168.28 - 173.68] biohacks out there non-stop but your
[170.92 - 175.32] liver something's going on stagnant
[173.68 - 178.88] sluggish
[175.32 - 181.04] liver stagnant sluggish liver why is it
[178.88 - 182.56] stagnant why is it slug sluggish from a
[181.04 - 185.24] lot of different things you guys I'm in
[182.56 - 187.32] Liver Rescue right now I'm just looking
[185.24 - 189.60] through here and talking about some cool
[187.32 - 192.00] stuff we're going to talk about this so
[189.60 - 195.96] what happens with people is their liver
[192.00 - 199.64] gets filled up and that filters stuffed
[195.96 - 201.40] and clogged and then it starts to become
[199.64 - 203.80] dysfunctional and then it doesn't
[201.40 - 205.60] produce the bile it needs to produce to
[203.80 - 210.00] break down your
[205.60 - 214.36] fats and then it starts to weaken and
[210.00 - 215.80] it's over 2,000 chemical functions start
[214.36 - 217.84] to become
[215.80 - 221.60] dysfunctional and so now your liver is
[217.84 - 224.64] only running on 700 chemical functions
[221.60 - 225.64] now your liver is only running on 900
[224.64 - 227.72] chemical
[225.64 - 231.68] functions now your liver is only running
[227.72 - 234.92] on 300 chemical functions because your
[231.68 - 238.48] liver is stagnant and sluggish and it's
[234.92 - 241.88] stuck and it's overburdened and over
[238.48 - 244.24] tired and the the 2,000 plus chemical
[241.88 - 246.60] functions that your liver does to keep
[244.24 - 250.12] you healthy keep you alive keep your
[246.60 - 251.52] skin looking good keep you doing good
[250.12 - 254.16] all that's
[251.52 - 257.00] diminishing and then over time you get a
[254.16 - 258.56] fatty liver without even realizing it
[257.00 - 262.44] people will get a fatty liver and then
[258.56 - 265.92] your A1C goes up and then your blood
[262.44 - 267.52] sugar is all over the place so if you're
[265.92 - 268.76] somebody that's dealing with blood sugar
[267.52 - 270.52] problems and that's what you're living
[268.76 - 273.12] with and you're always trying to like
[270.52 - 275.24] balance your blood sugar you're always
[273.12 - 278.16] trying to figure out that magic
[275.24 - 281.16] combination well let me this let me eat
[278.16 - 283.44] that I'm going to have salmon with a
[281.16 - 286.56] grapefruit I'm going to have a piece of
[283.44 - 288.16] meat with a celery stick I'm going to
[286.56 - 291.80] have something with something I'm going
[288.16 - 293.12] to have sushi with an orange I'm going
[291.80 - 296.52] to do whatever it is that you're I'm
[293.12 - 298.72] going to have nuts and seeds with
[296.52 - 301.32] raisins whatever you're trying to do to
[298.72 - 303.28] balance that that blood sugar problem a
[301.32 - 305.72] lot of people are like I eat hummus to
[303.28 - 308.40] try to balance it I eat beans I eat
[305.72 - 310.12] grains I eat fruit I eat vegetables
[308.40 - 311.56] everybody's just fighting to balance
[310.12 - 312.60] their blood sugar out there what they
[311.56 - 316.24] don't
[312.60 - 319.12] realize is they're battling a problem
[316.24 - 320.48] much bigger than what it seems it's not
[319.12 - 323.16] just about
[320.48 - 325.24] glucose it's about a liver becoming
[323.16 - 327.40] dysfunctional so one of the things that
[325.24 - 330.36] happens when your liver becomes
[327.40 - 333.56] dysfunctional is your glucose storage
[330.36 - 336.40] diminishes and starts to disappear your
[333.56 - 340.36] glucose storage so right here in your
[336.40 - 342.12] liver okay every time you eat something
[340.36 - 343.16] that has any kind of carbohydrate any
[342.12 - 345.88] kind of
[343.16 - 347.84] glucose say fructose and fruit it goes
[345.88 - 350.40] into the liver and it helps to restore
[347.84 - 351.64] the storage bin down in there so every
[350.40 - 353.16] time you're eating something with a
[351.64 - 355.80] carbohydrate because if you don't have a
[353.16 - 357.80] carbohydrate if you don't have a sugar
[355.80 - 360.84] if you don't have that fructose or
[357.80 - 363.80] glucose you don't have that starch from
[360.84 - 366.60] something what happens is you don't
[363.80 - 369.56] refill all of your cells with needed
[366.60 - 372.68] energy because our energy derives from
[369.56 - 375.44] sugar our brain thrives and lives off of
[372.68 - 378.04] sugar that's what our brain lives off of
[375.44 - 382.32] you take sugar away from our brain it
[378.04 - 387.00] dies in 10 seconds you take sugar away
[382.32 - 389.72] from the brain cells start to die in 5
[387.00 - 391.80] seconds and it just goes from there like
[389.72 - 395.56] as the seconds are counting down the
[391.80 - 397.92] brain starts to die so sugar and glucose
[395.56 - 400.80] needs to store into the liver so that
[397.92 - 403.76] your liver is releasing little bits of
[400.80 - 404.88] it keeping your blood sugar balanced you
[403.76 - 407.04] hear what I'm going right here how
[404.88 - 410.84] important this is keeping your blood
[407.04 - 414.60] sugar balanced your liver is like your
[410.84 - 416.72] blood sugar balancer right there people
[414.60 - 418.88] don't know that instead they're just
[416.72 - 421.36] they're trying to master a food they go
[418.88 - 423.04] and buy a hack foods and they're trying
[421.36 - 425.08] like I'm trying to eat this and this and
[423.04 - 427.36] at 12:00 I'm eating this and this and at
[425.08 - 429.28] 1:00 I'm eating this and this and
[427.36 - 431.32] they're trying to figure out how to keep
[429.28 - 433.84] their blood sugar their hypoglycemia
[431.32 - 435.88] their hypoglycemia blood sugar spikes
[433.84 - 437.08] they're keeping monitors on themselves
[435.88 - 438.64] they're all freaked out about their
[437.08 - 440.92] blood sugar they don't know what's going
[438.64 - 444.20] on and what's really happening deep down
[440.92 - 447.28] inside is you got a tired liver that
[444.20 - 450.68] that doesn't have a glucose storage bin
[447.28 - 453.60] anymore or the delivers overburdened
[450.68 - 457.16] stagnant sluggish and it's not
[453.60 - 460.24] functioning good enough to release
[457.16 - 462.56] glucose properly it's not functioning
[460.24 - 465.48] good enough to be able to release spurts
[462.56 - 468.32] of that glucose to keep you strong so
[465.48 - 471.00] you're not hitting the ground so you're
[468.32 - 473.56] not you know hitting the wall so you can
[471.00 - 476.16] function and live your life so your
[473.56 - 479.28] liver needs to actually control that
[476.16 - 481.48] glucose release and it sends out glucose
[479.28 - 484.00] ose right into the bloodstream so that
[481.48 - 485.40] you're stable so what happens is people
[484.00 - 487.04] walk around they think they have the
[485.40 - 488.48] worst blood sugar problems because it's
[487.04 - 490.84] a blood sugar problem they're like it's
[488.48 - 493.68] my pancreas what's going on am I
[490.84 - 496.48] pre-diabetic what do I have going on
[493.68 - 498.84] meanwhile it's the liver it's tired it's
[496.48 - 500.08] beaten down it's problematic it's
[498.84 - 503.60] stagnant it's
[500.08 - 506.40] sluggish and that's what's going on so I
[503.60 - 508.40] want everybody to know that the liver
[506.40 - 510.84] plays a role in so much of your health
[508.40 - 512.52] over 2,000 in chemical functions and
[510.84 - 515.28] when it get stagnant and sluggish
[512.52 - 518.12] everything starts going wrong you start
[515.28 - 520.24] bloating you might get some
[518.12 - 522.52] constipation you might get all kinds of
[520.24 - 524.32] other issues along with it and then
[522.52 - 527.16] there's the adrenaline so let's get the
[524.32 - 529.28] adrenals out for a little bit that's
[527.16 - 531.00] another thing that happens we run on a
[529.28 - 533.28] high all the time we're always trying to
[531.00 - 535.00] get high everybody's out there trying to
[533.28 - 537.44] get high they're living off of
[535.00 - 540.88] adrenaline they're running on adrenaline
[537.44 - 543.56] every day and then they're burning out
[540.88 - 545.44] their adrenals every day adrenaline's
[543.56 - 547.60] being released and that adrenaline gets
[545.44 - 549.48] absorbed into the liver and starts to
[547.60 - 552.08] absorb into the liver and it tires the
[549.48 - 555.08] liver out another reason why people have
[552.08 - 558.44] stagnant sluggish liver that leads to
[555.08 - 561.04] bloating is because their adrenals have
[558.44 - 562.80] released so much adrenaline so so many
[561.04 - 564.68] people are on caffeine every day they're
[562.80 - 566.76] on their coffee and their adrenals are
[564.68 - 570.16] just flooding everywhere
[566.76 - 572.76] like more caffeine the adrenals are just
[570.16 - 576.48] releasing it out right more matcha tea
[572.76 - 578.36] more coffee more cacao more caffeine and
[576.48 - 579.88] it's just like stimulant stimulant and
[578.36 - 581.04] the adrenals are just flooding and
[579.88 - 583.08] flooding and
[581.04 - 584.56] flooding that's not the only time the
[583.08 - 586.44] adrenals are flooding when we're on a
[584.56 - 588.36] really high fat diet all the time we're
[586.44 - 591.44] eating fats everywhere whether you're
[588.36 - 594.16] plant-based you're vegan whether you're
[591.44 - 596.36] you know vegetarian whether you're just
[594.16 - 598.80] animal protein a lot of people they're
[596.36 - 600.96] on such high fat diets there's so much
[598.80 - 602.80] fat in their diet that they're on an
[600.96 - 604.88] adrenaline High because the fats get
[602.80 - 606.76] into the bloodstream then your body does
[604.88 - 609.80] this emergency situation where it
[606.76 - 611.68] releases adrenaline to thin out the fats
[609.80 - 612.60] inside the bloodstream so you don't have
[611.68 - 615.32] a heart
[612.60 - 617.08] attack and so all that adrenaline high
[615.32 - 620.76] is happening with people they're walking
[617.08 - 623.76] around stimulated all the time and so
[620.76 - 625.92] it's important it's important to heal
[623.76 - 628.40] the liver work on healing the liver
[625.92 - 632.12] restoring the liver so many people's
[628.40 - 633.92] problems are are the liver okay eczema
[632.12 - 636.28] psoriasis
[633.92 - 638.88] dermatitis the liver plays a role in
[636.28 - 639.64] that right there any skin problems you
[638.88 - 642.32] don't
[639.64 - 644.16] like any kind of different dark spots on
[642.32 - 646.68] your skin all kinds of different skin
[644.16 - 647.84] issues the liver plays a role right
[646.68 - 651.08] there
[647.84 - 654.00] bloating yes even constipation other
[651.08 - 655.92] digestive trouble the liver plays a role
[654.00 - 658.52] right there so let's move into it a
[655.92 - 663.12] little deeper okay one of your liver's
[658.52 - 666.52] most important jobs is to disperse bile
[663.12 - 669.40] and break down fat and if it doesn't
[666.52 - 674.08] disperse enough bile guess what the fat
[669.40 - 676.52] goes ran it ran it it sits in your gut
[674.08 - 678.56] and it goes bad and it goes rancid and
[676.52 - 680.44] it starts to harden up and it sits on
[678.56 - 682.64] the walls of your intestinal tract and
[680.44 - 685.84] your
[682.64 - 689.04] gut the other role the liver
[685.84 - 691.52] does is it actually makes it so your
[689.04 - 694.52] stomach glands in your stomach stay
[691.52 - 697.00] stronger so that they can create
[694.52 - 699.88] hydrochloric acid and the hydrochloric
[697.00 - 702.44] acid breaks down protein the weaker your
[699.88 - 705.00] liver gets the less protein you break
[702.44 - 707.92] down and then your protein ends up
[705.00 - 710.52] rotting and putrifying and then you can
[707.92 - 714.32] be stuck with all kinds of flatulent and
[710.52 - 717.04] gas additionally tacked on to your
[714.32 - 719.48] bloating so quick rundown stagnant
[717.04 - 721.40] sluggish liver that's dysfunctional
[719.48 - 724.60] that's not doing its 2,000 chemical
[721.40 - 726.56] functions but instead it's doing 500
[724.60 - 729.32] chemical functions or 400 chemical
[726.56 - 731.16] functions it gets tired it can't
[729.32 - 734.64] function as good as it needs to function
[731.16 - 736.68] it gets hot it starts to heat up and
[734.64 - 739.00] then it loses its ability to store
[736.68 - 741.68] glucose so your blood sugar is all over
[739.00 - 744.04] the map like this so when you got that
[741.68 - 747.36] stagnant sluggish liver you guys your
[744.04 - 750.32] glucose is all over the map and you're
[747.36 - 753.64] just like everywhere it's like my A1C my
[750.32 - 756.60] A1C where's my glucose I'm spiking I'm
[753.64 - 759.84] lowering I'm spiking I'm crashing the
[756.60 - 762.32] liver plays a huge role in all of that
[759.84 - 764.04] the other thing hydrochloric acid the
[762.32 - 766.32] liver keeps your stomach glands and
[764.04 - 768.68] stomach stronger if the liver's strong
[766.32 - 770.56] it keeps your stomach stronger your
[768.68 - 774.40] glands in your stomach stronger
[770.56 - 778.04] producing higher quality quantities of
[774.40 - 780.04] HCL which really helps someone actually
[778.04 - 781.36] break down proteins you guys I see a lot
[780.04 - 784.16] of people asking me what I'm talking
[781.36 - 786.40] about talking about bloing constipation
[784.16 - 787.96] and IBS in Liver Rescue I don't know if
[786.40 - 790.28] you have this book right

[801.80 - 807.00] heel cleanse the heel is an important
[803.96 - 810.48] book for cleansing the liver
[807.00 - 811.76] Okay so let's go into a little deeper
[810.48 - 814.24] into it we're going to cover some other
[811.76 - 816.56] stuff all around this so it's critical
[814.24 - 818.16] to know what's going on inside your body
[816.56 - 819.96] if you don't know what's happening
[818.16 - 822.08] inside your body you're going to be
[819.96 - 825.52] running around like a chicken with your
[822.08 - 828.28] head cut off trying to biohack always
[825.52 - 831.84] looking for an answer being stuck in the
[828.28 - 833.44] mud but when you know what's going on
[831.84 - 834.92] and why you're feeling like you do why
[833.44 - 838.04] you're struggling like you do and you
[834.92 - 840.16] know why things can change you can turn
[838.04 - 842.88] things around you you can heal you can
[840.16 - 845.52] move forward and that's critical to know
[842.88 - 848.84] so back to the liver a little bit
[845.52 - 851.52] keeping a strong liver makes it so your
[848.84 - 854.32] HCL is produced and stays strong and
[851.52 - 856.16] breaks down your protein critical or
[854.32 - 858.92] your protein will sit there and rot in
[856.16 - 862.88] your gut and you'll have protein gut rot
[858.92 - 865.52] inside your gut where it'll purify and
[862.88 - 868.44] release ammonia and
[865.52 - 872.96] gases and then you want your liver to be
[868.44 - 875.56] strong to produce strong ample bile so
[872.96 - 877.36] the bile can break down and disperse the
[875.56 - 881.12] fats that you're eating when you do eat
[877.36 - 883.92] fat in your food a weak liver means the
[881.12 - 887.92] bile will actually go
[883.92 - 890.92] rancid with the fats your own bile and
[887.92 - 893.36] the fats together will actually join
[890.92 - 895.28] together and purify and all go ran it
[893.36 - 898.72] because your bile wasn't even strong
[895.28 - 902.56] enough to break down the fat so your
[898.72 - 904.64] bile even lost its shelf life people
[902.56 - 907.96] with weak livers they end up getting a
[904.64 - 910.88] fatty liver liver starts to get toxic
[907.96 - 912.88] and fat and when the liver is in that
[910.88 - 913.88] condition all these things can go wrong
[912.88 - 916.32] as
[913.88 - 918.68] well another thing with the liver is
[916.32 - 922.76] cholesterol readings when you go and get
[918.68 - 924.52] your blood test liver problems mean
[922.76 - 927.24] cholesterol
[924.52 - 930.24] problems right there on its own high
[927.24 - 932.60] blood pressure liver problems unless
[930.24 - 934.40] there's a blockage somewhere and even
[932.60 - 936.12] then if there's a blockage somewhere
[934.40 - 938.48] with high blood pressure or heart
[936.12 - 941.36] problems it starts originally from the
[938.48 - 943.84] liver all the way back in years before
[941.36 - 946.96] it starts with the liver keep that in
[943.84 - 949.36] mind so I don't talk about it enough
[946.96 - 952.08] lately but in order to stay healthy we
[949.36 - 955.72] have to keep our livers healthy and
[952.08 - 958.16] strong so we can stay healthy so
[955.72 - 962.80] cleansing the liver strengthening it and
[958.16 - 963.84] bringing it back is key it's critical
[962.80 - 965.76] for
[963.84 - 967.44] healing back to the high that
[965.76 - 971.12] everybody's on everybody's chasing a
[967.44 - 973.44] high said this before people love to
[971.12 - 975.56] chase highs and when we Chase highs and
[973.44 - 979.20] we're stimulated or jacked up on our own
[975.56 - 981.88] adrenaline we weaken our liver even more
[979.20 - 985.08] Liver Rescue is a legendary it has
[981.88 - 987.56] changed the health of people worldwide
[985.08 - 989.28] it's changed the medical system it's

[993.00 - 998.44] about information in Liver Rescue It is
[996.04 - 1000.40] it this is the book that brought liver
[998.44 - 1001.64] information to the world no one's ever
[1000.40 - 1004.56] even heard
[1001.64 - 1007.76] before this book right here is worth a
[1004.56 - 1012.20] read to gain control and empowerment on
[1007.76 - 1015.48] your health let's go into it a little
[1012.20 - 1015.48] deeper all
[1016.64 - 1021.60] right so you're eating whatever you
[1020.60 - 1024.64] choose to
[1021.60 - 1026.76] eat you're bloating from
[1024.64 - 1028.28] it so you might be somebody that's
[1026.76 - 1031.36] intermittent fasting maybe you're
[1028.28 - 1034.16] holding back food maybe you did a water
[1031.36 - 1038.44] fast and your water fast was like seven
[1034.16 - 1040.16] days or 10 days or 14 days or 21 days
[1038.44 - 1042.64] and you did it water fast and your
[1040.16 - 1044.64] bloating went down and you're proud of
[1042.64 - 1046.84] yourself cuz your bloating went
[1044.64 - 1048.08] down and maybe you just you're somebody
[1046.84 - 1049.28] who's intermittent fasting you're
[1048.08 - 1051.12] probably yourself cuz you're bloating
[1049.28 - 1053.68] went down or maybe you're somebody that
[1051.12 - 1055.28] just didn't eat much for a few days and
[1053.68 - 1056.96] you're getting lymphatic drainage and
[1055.28 - 1058.36] you're getting your stomach worked on
[1056.96 - 1060.92] and they're working on you and they're
[1058.36 - 1063.20] even using machines on your abdomen
[1060.92 - 1066.08] abdominal machines to try to push all
[1063.20 - 1069.80] the fluid out of your
[1066.08 - 1073.32] skin and then the next day it's back you
[1069.80 - 1076.52] end your water cleanse it's back you end
[1073.32 - 1079.04] your intermittent fasting moments it's
[1076.52 - 1080.88] back you end you know you're done with
[1079.04 - 1084.40] your lymphatic drainage after a little
[1080.88 - 1088.28] while it's back there it is your
[1084.40 - 1092.08] bloating is back what the heck is going
[1088.28 - 1093.48] on that's what has to be addressed or
[1092.08 - 1097.88] it's just a
[1093.48 - 1100.00] game it's a charade it's about managing
[1097.88 - 1103.84] now it's important to manage you that's
[1100.00 - 1106.28] what you have to do if you know those
[1103.84 - 1109.36] inner secrets about yourself where you
[1106.28 - 1111.92] can manage just right to try to keep
[1109.36 - 1113.96] balance to keep the bloating down to
[1111.92 - 1115.84] keep the constipation at Bay if that's
[1113.96 - 1118.08] something you have or even the IBS or
[1115.84 - 1119.24] anything else around it if you have a
[1118.08 - 1121.48] secret
[1119.24 - 1124.88] recipe and you're using that secret
[1121.48 - 1127.24] recipe then then that's great but you're
[1124.88 - 1129.08] also managing and
[1127.24 - 1132.60] micromanaging but you're not getting
[1129.08 - 1135.40] down to the root to the root which is
[1132.60 - 1137.80] critical and that's a big deal we want
[1135.40 - 1140.72] to get down to the root so let's hit
[1137.80 - 1143.48] ammonia gas what happens with everybody
[1140.72 - 1145.28] okay people get stitches they get cramps
[1143.48 - 1147.96] they get all kinds of problems with that
[1145.28 - 1150.08] they get gastritis they can get cramps
[1147.96 - 1153.32] and stitches that run all the way up to
[1150.08 - 1155.92] their neck all the way up to their neck
[1153.32 - 1158.16] and even the top of their throat their
[1155.92 - 1159.92] shoulder people can have gastric cramps
[1158.16 - 1162.48] and gastric problems where they're
[1159.92 - 1164.16] bellowed over they're hanging on a couch
[1162.48 - 1165.84] they're in their bed they're on the
[1164.16 - 1167.44] floor they're trying to move around
[1165.84 - 1169.68] they're trying to do yoga positions
[1167.44 - 1171.64] they're trying to let gas out that's
[1169.68 - 1175.92] trapped and they're trying to get that
[1171.64 - 1179.84] trapped gas out right but in that gas is
[1175.92 - 1182.36] ammonia and ammonia is something that's
[1179.84 - 1185.24] produced from a lot of things being
[1182.36 - 1187.40] stagnant and sluggish in here ammonia is
[1185.24 - 1190.32] produced
[1187.40 - 1192.52] from foods that are actually putrifying
[1190.32 - 1194.44] and not breaking down proteins that are
[1192.52 - 1197.48] putrifying and not breaking down fats
[1194.44 - 1200.08] that are rancid and pathogens that want
[1197.48 - 1202.88] to feed
[1200.08 - 1205.76] on what's going on that isn't being
[1202.88 - 1208.96] digested that's starting to rot
[1205.76 - 1211.36] pathogens bacteria that's not good
[1208.96 - 1213.36] bacteria and when that bacteria that's
[1211.36 - 1215.80] not good bacteria is sitting here
[1213.36 - 1218.80] swimming inside your small intestinal
[1215.80 - 1223.48] tract and inside your colon your
[1218.80 - 1227.64] Elum it's feeding on ranet
[1223.48 - 1228.92] undigested ammonia gas filled putrified
[1227.64 - 1230.92] protein
[1228.92 - 1235.60] and rancid
[1230.92 - 1237.08] fats so the bacteria is feeding and then
[1235.60 - 1240.84] the gas in the
[1237.08 - 1243.24] flatulence produced by that bacteria
[1240.84 - 1246.04] along with the ammonia gas that's
[1243.24 - 1249.44] actually cycling
[1246.04 - 1251.68] through that gas becomes toxic where
[1249.44 - 1255.96] you're getting a stitch now so you're
[1251.68 - 1259.04] feeling a stitch like oh man or oh I got
[1255.96 - 1261.24] to let that gas out I'm feeling a stitch
[1259.04 - 1263.60] or I don't feel good or my stomach's
[1261.24 - 1267.48] kind of blowing up
[1263.60 - 1269.68] again and what it is it's toxic painful
[1267.48 - 1272.28] gas you might be somebody that doesn't
[1269.68 - 1274.72] have the painful gas because the
[1272.28 - 1277.04] bacteria might be a different kind of
[1274.72 - 1279.72] bacteria or you don't have a lot of bad
[1277.04 - 1282.68] bacteria feeding off of things but you
[1279.72 - 1284.52] still have rotting putrified protein and
[1282.68 - 1287.32] rancid
[1284.52 - 1290.76] fats all inside the intestinal tract and
[1287.32 - 1292.12] the gut that's leeching out ammonia gas
[1290.76 - 1294.56] and putrifying
[1292.12 - 1298.00] and that's creating flatulence
[1294.56 - 1299.76] flatulence and gases well so you have to
[1298.00 - 1301.76] just you have to roll around on the
[1299.76 - 1303.64] ground on the floor you have to move and
[1301.76 - 1306.28] shift your body to try to release that
[1303.64 - 1308.60] gas to get it out and you might be
[1306.28 - 1310.64] somebody where the gas just streams out
[1308.60 - 1313.24] every day like that and you might be
[1310.64 - 1315.80] somebody where it's trapped and you have
[1313.24 - 1319.04] inflammation inside the the intestinal
[1315.80 - 1321.12] tract from pathogens from pathogens
[1319.04 - 1323.44] inside the intestinal tract and that
[1321.12 - 1324.64] those pathogens have little spots in
[1323.44 - 1327.60] here that are
[1324.64 - 1330.32] inflamed and that inflammation makes it
[1327.60 - 1331.60] so the gas gets stuck so let's go into
[1330.32 - 1333.60] that a little bit I want to talk about
[1331.60 - 1335.20] stuck gas because that's a big deal for
[1333.60 - 1337.64] a lot of people right
[1335.20 - 1339.68] there so when you're in small intestinal
[1337.64 - 1344.44] tract you can have narrowings and you
[1339.68 - 1346.28] can have distension and swellings so a
[1344.44 - 1349.68] lot of people they small intestinal
[1346.28 - 1352.12] tract okay has
[1349.68 - 1354.00] inconsistencies where they're expanding
[1352.12 - 1356.64] in some areas it's kind of like the
[1354.00 - 1360.16] pipeline is expanding in certain
[1356.64 - 1363.60] areas or Contracting in certain areas so
[1360.16 - 1366.56] the gas isn't moving through properly so
[1363.60 - 1369.80] it builds up in one area until it builds
[1366.56 - 1372.20] up and then you move and then boom it
[1369.80 - 1374.76] starts pushing through and pushing
[1372.20 - 1376.44] through and that's what happens and
[1374.76 - 1378.64] there's other people that have different
[1376.44 - 1381.68] areas like their elium
[1378.64 - 1384.40] so right here you know their Elum
[1381.68 - 1387.56] problematic the gas is stuck there it's
[1384.40 - 1390.16] inflamed the gas won't move through and
[1387.56 - 1392.76] it's just stuck and it's in the right
[1390.16 - 1394.76] area the right lower region and they're
[1392.76 - 1395.80] always like this or they're in the
[1394.76 - 1397.24] bathroom and they're trying to go to the
[1395.80 - 1400.20] bathroom and they're always holding this
[1397.24 - 1403.04] spot they feel that discomfort and
[1400.20 - 1406.28] there's that kind of person too and what
[1403.04 - 1409.20] these little in inflamed areas in this
[1406.28 - 1412.92] in the small intestinal tract from from
[1409.20 - 1415.44] bacteria in the lining in the wall or
[1412.92 - 1417.20] even viruses in the lining in the wall
[1415.44 - 1419.64] they get trapped in
[1417.20 - 1422.08] there and when they're trapped in there
[1419.64 - 1424.96] and they're in that lining you get a
[1422.08 - 1428.52] swelling and an inflammation and then
[1424.96 - 1430.32] the gas heads down the pike and when it
[1428.52 - 1433.44] hits that spot it gets stuck and it
[1430.32 - 1435.24] blows up and now you're bloating so
[1433.44 - 1436.96] you're somebody that's actually bloating
[1435.24 - 1438.92] so what you got your lymphatic drainage
[1436.96 - 1441.60] your lymphatic massage M they might have
[1438.92 - 1444.56] done like an abdom abdominal roller on
[1441.60 - 1447.80] you you're getting work done you're
[1444.56 - 1450.28] getting that out you walk away 6 hours
[1447.80 - 1452.88] later you're starting to build gas up
[1450.28 - 1455.44] the gas is building up in pockets and
[1452.88 - 1457.80] now you're bloating all over

[1564.60 - 1570.72] inside your body it's critical okay Tera
[1568.64 - 1573.88] says why can emotional stress trigger
[1570.72 - 1578.32] bloating for some people emotional
[1573.88 - 1581.24] stress for some people can trigger off
[1578.32 - 1584.04] adrenaline okay and when the
[1581.24 - 1585.68] adrenals start flooding because it's
[1584.04 - 1588.00] emotional stress in the adrenals and
[1585.68 - 1590.20] that adrenaline it can then fil are
[1588.00 - 1592.12] right into the liver and the liver gets
[1590.20 - 1594.08] stuck very stagnant in the moment if
[1592.12 - 1596.72] it's already stagnant and that can kind
[1594.08 - 1598.32] of short circuit the liver a little bit
[1596.72 - 1600.00] a lot of people deal with that that's
[1598.32 - 1601.36] one thing there's a bunch of things that
[1600.00 - 1603.16] can happen though when we're under
[1601.36 - 1607.20] emotional
[1603.16 - 1612.80] stress so so many people
[1607.20 - 1616.20] have five or 10 pounds on them of
[1612.80 - 1620.08] bloating but yet it's not
[1616.20 - 1622.56] fat so this is is interesting really
[1620.08 - 1624.04] interesting that's why when someone does
[1622.56 - 1626.12] something like they'll go and they'll do
[1624.04 - 1628.64] say a water fast they go do a juice fast
[1626.12 - 1631.76] or they'll go do
[1628.64 - 1636.48] something well what happens is they have
[1631.76 - 1640.40] like 10 to 15 PBS 5 lbs 20
[1636.48 - 1644.08] lb 20 lbs of swelling of
[1640.40 - 1647.24] fluid in their intestinal tract swelling
[1644.08 - 1649.08] in their liver stagnant sluggish right
[1647.24 - 1651.60] food F in their intestinal tract that
[1649.08 - 1654.44] hasn't moved in a long
[1651.60 - 1656.32] time gas and all kinds of different
[1654.44 - 1658.72] fluid throughout their
[1656.32 - 1660.48] system and they're bloating and what
[1658.72 - 1662.56] happens is they're bloating from all of
[1660.48 - 1666.88] that and then when they go and they do
[1662.56 - 1669.72] any kind of cleanse or they stop eating
[1666.88 - 1672.88] it starts to go down and they start
[1669.72 - 1675.08] releasing it they release the some of
[1672.88 - 1677.12] the old putrified stuff some of the food
[1675.08 - 1679.36] out of their system some of the fluid
[1677.12 - 1682.00] retention goes
[1679.36 - 1685.76] down and then they notice that wait I'm
[1682.00 - 1689.12] 5 lb lighter I'm 10 lb
[1685.76 - 1692.28] lighter but it wasn't 5 lbs of fat that
[1689.12 - 1695.36] they just lost and it wasn't 10 lbs of
[1692.28 - 1698.00] fat that they just lost they're now 5
[1695.36 - 1700.32] PBS lighter 10 pounds lighter of
[1698.00 - 1703.40] putrified stuff that's in their system
[1700.32 - 1707.64] fluid retention
[1703.40 - 1710.20] pus stagnant sluggish fluid filled liver
[1707.64 - 1713.20] and they stopped eating and it went
[1710.20 - 1714.40] down or they didn't eat much that went
[1713.20 - 1716.32] down a lot of people who are
[1714.40 - 1718.08] intermittent fasting they go without
[1716.32 - 1719.72] food and they're just on coffee all day
[1718.08 - 1721.52] they're on stimulants all day they go
[1719.72 - 1723.88] without food and they're noticing they
[1721.52 - 1726.92] slim down a little bit but it doesn't
[1723.88 - 1731.60] mean they're losing fat really quickly
[1726.92 - 1734.28] or anything they're losing swelling and
[1731.60 - 1736.08] bloting but we can't just do that we
[1734.28 - 1737.96] have to do things where we take care of
[1736.08 - 1739.68] ourselves and we eat every day and we're
[1737.96 - 1742.92] doing things that are cleaning it up on
[1739.68 - 1745.52] a daily basis and healing the stagnant
[1742.92 - 1747.92] sluggish liver to begin with so we're
[1745.52 - 1749.32] not all over the place like up and down
[1747.92 - 1751.76] and all that a lot of people feel a
[1749.32 - 1754.12] little better in the morning after
[1751.76 - 1756.76] sleeping when they drink
[1754.12 - 1758.96] water afterwards they bloat right back
[1756.76 - 1761.52] up so you go to bed at night you're
[1758.96 - 1763.92] bloated you're out to hear you go to bed
[1761.52 - 1765.48] you wake up in the morning and it's down
[1763.92 - 1767.56] your liver got a chance throughout the
[1765.48 - 1771.00] night to pack up some toxins and sh chip
[1767.56 - 1772.96] it out and your bloating is down now and
[1771.00 - 1774.40] then you drink water all of a sudden or
[1772.96 - 1775.92] something else and you're starting up in
[1774.40 - 1778.04] the morning and the bloating comes back
[1775.92 - 1781.28] fast and it comes back fast and now it's
[1778.04 - 1784.32] building up all day long so your
[1781.28 - 1787.28] bloating is building up a lot of people
[1784.32 - 1789.28] try not to drink much during the day or
[1787.28 - 1791.16] eat much during the day because they
[1789.28 - 1793.64] don't want to be bloated so they're
[1791.16 - 1796.16] withholding food all day long they're
[1793.64 - 1797.60] withholding fluid all day long and
[1796.16 - 1801.76] you'll notice like a lot of times times
[1797.60 - 1804.08] influencers tend to go really
[1801.76 - 1807.36] dehydrated really dehydrated they're
[1804.08 - 1810.08] drinking their coffee only all morning
[1807.36 - 1812.36] all afternoon and they're literally
[1810.08 - 1813.84] dehydrating their themselves then they
[1812.36 - 1816.08] go and they get a lymphatic drainage
[1813.84 - 1819.04] while they're dehydrated and their
[1816.08 - 1820.40] lymphatic uh therapist says make sure
[1819.04 - 1822.64] you drink a lot of water when you're
[1820.40 - 1824.92] done with this and they don't even want
[1822.64 - 1827.44] to drink water they get done with their
[1824.92 - 1829.80] lymphatic massage and they have a little
[1827.44 - 1832.56] Sip and it starts to come back a few
[1829.80 - 1834.96] sips and it starts to come back so a lot
[1832.56 - 1837.00] of people right now that fit into their
[1834.96 - 1839.04] swim suit and so forth they're like
[1837.00 - 1840.84] going dehydrated and that's not the way
[1839.04 - 1843.68] to do it either that's not healthy
[1840.84 - 1846.64] either it's not the way to battle
[1843.68 - 1849.16] this so Nicole over there on IG says why
[1846.64 - 1854.48] does green juice bloat
[1849.16 - 1856.36] me well if my my thoughts here with that
[1854.48 - 1857.84] question are what happens with a lot of
[1856.36 - 1860.60] people
[1857.84 - 1862.68] so nothing else bloats you it's only
[1860.60 - 1864.36] green juice so you're just somebody
[1862.68 - 1866.68] that's never bloated or you're not
[1864.36 - 1868.52] bloated and then it's green juice that
[1866.68 - 1870.32] only bloats you like you're not bloated
[1868.52 - 1871.64] ever you live your life you eat your
[1870.32 - 1874.48] dinner you eat your breakfast you eat
[1871.64 - 1876.08] your lunch you're living your life
[1874.48 - 1877.60] you're drinking what you want eating
[1876.08 - 1878.80] what you want doing what you want and
[1877.60 - 1882.16] all of a sudden you have a sip of green
[1878.80 - 1884.00] juice and you're bloated now or is it
[1882.16 - 1886.08] you already have a bloating problem
[1884.00 - 1887.48] you're fighting bloating all the time it
[1886.08 - 1889.80] just so happens when you're drink green
[1887.48 - 1892.64] juice too you get bloated from that as
[1889.80 - 1894.52] well because that's probably what's
[1892.64 - 1896.76] happening I think
[1894.52 - 1899.44] right so it's not like you go through
[1896.76 - 1901.12] life and you're never bloated ever and
[1899.44 - 1904.68] then all of a sudden green juice makes
[1901.12 - 1907.84] you bloated but soda doesn't coffee
[1904.68 - 1911.20] doesn't nothing else makes you bloated a
[1907.84 - 1913.08] bagel or plant-based eating or vegan
[1911.20 - 1914.88] eating or animal protein eating whatever
[1913.08 - 1916.16] it is nothing gets you bloated it's just
[1914.88 - 1918.80] green
[1916.16 - 1920.56] juice it's just something to think about
[1918.80 - 1921.96] or you get bloated all the time you're
[1920.56 - 1923.68] struggling with bloat but when you have
[1921.96 - 1926.00] grain juice it seems to come on a little
[1923.68 - 1927.96] bit more if you're somebody you're
[1926.00 - 1930.08] really toxic a lot of stuff is sluggish
[1927.96 - 1932.12] your liver's sluggish and you put some
[1930.08 - 1934.16] pretty healthy stuff in you there's a
[1932.12 - 1937.16] good chance it's going to start
[1934.16 - 1938.92] detoxifying you right away and you could
[1937.16 - 1940.80] get a little bit of bloat from stuff
[1938.92 - 1943.36] being pushed out starting to get pushed
[1940.80 - 1945.00] out people will eat only a little piece
[1943.36 - 1948.32] of meat or an
[1945.00 - 1951.16] egg or a piece of chicken
[1948.32 - 1953.16] just a little piece with like two leaves
[1951.16 - 1954.56] of lettuce and a little piece of chicken
[1953.16 - 1956.44] because they don't want too much in
[1954.56 - 1959.00] their stomach they don't want to feel
[1956.44 - 1961.60] that bloating because if they eat too
[1959.00 - 1965.08] much they're bloated and people go on
[1961.60 - 1968.32] dates and people go on dates they never
[1965.08 - 1970.04] tank if it's a brand new date somebody
[1968.32 - 1971.60] and someone goes on a date and they're
[1970.04 - 1974.88] sitting at the table in the
[1971.60 - 1976.72] restaurant no one's tanking no one's
[1974.88 - 1979.00] like I'm going to eat this big stack of
[1976.72 - 1982.48] panc pakes in front of you right here
[1979.00 - 1984.44] I'm stuffed and then and then you leave
[1982.48 - 1986.56] the table just stuffed right I'm going
[1984.44 - 1989.04] to eat this 12 oce steak right now on
[1986.56 - 1992.36] the on this first date right here people
[1989.04 - 1994.88] go on dates they usually hold back food
[1992.36 - 1996.28] all day long you know anybody that's
[1994.88 - 1998.76] ever done
[1996.28 - 2001.44] this when women go on dates they hold
[1998.76 - 2003.84] back food all day long all day long for
[2001.44 - 2005.80] the date cuz they don't want to blo out
[2003.84 - 2007.00] they don't want to be bloated on any
[2005.80 - 2008.60] level they want to be able to fit into
[2007.00 - 2010.04] to whatever they want to fit into they
[2008.60 - 2012.08] want to look good for their date same
[2010.04 - 2013.52] thing with guys guys will just all of a
[2012.08 - 2016.28] sudden they'll be intermittent fasting
[2013.52 - 2018.40] the whole day so that when the date when
[2016.28 - 2020.88] the date happens everybody's holding
[2018.40 - 2023.00] their stomachs in no one wants to be
[2020.88 - 2025.36] like bloated and then when they order
[2023.00 - 2026.60] dinner they're eating a little something
[2025.36 - 2029.84] that's how you can always tell if it's a
[2026.60 - 2031.92] first aid out there like no one's eating
[2029.84 - 2034.04] anything and then you know that's what
[2031.92 - 2035.96] happens because if they did no one's
[2034.04 - 2037.16] going to just tank and then be bloated
[2035.96 - 2038.80] and that's how it works people people
[2037.16 - 2041.28] eat very little a lot of times during
[2038.80 - 2044.40] the day to keep their bloting down so
[2041.28 - 2046.72] they can feel like they're like flat
[2044.40 - 2050.40] right and then they eat a vegetable and
[2046.72 - 2052.36] fruit with fiber and water and lots of
[2050.40 - 2055.52] just water
[2052.36 - 2057.80] rich and they eat all these vegetables
[2055.52 - 2060.92] and all these fruits and all that all
[2057.80 - 2064.36] that pulp and that pecting and that
[2060.92 - 2067.12] fiber and that water Rich right those
[2064.36 - 2070.00] nutrients are all going down and it it's
[2067.12 - 2072.20] feeling kind of like bulk and all of a
[2070.00 - 2073.80] sudden they're feeling it in their
[2072.20 - 2075.16] intestinal tract let's talk about that
[2073.80 - 2077.00] let's head into that direction a little
[2075.16 - 2078.00] bit that's that deserves a little bit a
[2077.00 - 2081.16] few
[2078.00 - 2083.84] minutes if you guys got a few minutes
[2081.16 - 2087.72] why is it that a lot of people who are
[2083.84 - 2090.96] eating like leafy greens and fruits and
[2087.72 - 2093.64] vegetables and they can feel that
[2090.96 - 2095.20] roughage so much and they say I can't do
[2093.64 - 2100.04] that I have to be carnivore I can only
[2095.20 - 2102.72] eat meat only I can only eat eggs only
[2100.04 - 2105.04] because every time I eat a vegetable or
[2102.72 - 2107.80] a fruit or something anytime I even and
[2105.04 - 2109.92] eat any of that I feel it in my gut and
[2107.80 - 2112.84] it doesn't digest and it doesn't break
[2109.92 - 2115.80] down I can't eat raw because if I eat
[2112.84 - 2118.96] raw I can feel it it it kind of hurts it
[2115.80 - 2121.68] makes me feel uncomfortable all that
[2118.96 - 2123.00] roughage is moving through me and then
[2121.68 - 2124.20] they go to somebody they go to a health
[2123.00 - 2126.56] coach or whatever the health coach is
[2124.20 - 2128.36] don't have all that roughage you can't
[2126.56 - 2131.00] have all that roughage just eat eggs
[2128.36 - 2133.04] only do just eggs every day like have
[2131.00 - 2135.60] six eggs a day how many people seen
[2133.04 - 2139.00] people do that a lot they like six eggs
[2135.60 - 2140.76] a day eat eggs and cheese this way you
[2139.00 - 2142.64] know you're not like dealing with all
[2140.76 - 2143.52] that roughage of all the vegetables and
[2142.64 - 2146.72] all the
[2143.52 - 2147.64] fruits but that doesn't fix it the eggs
[2146.72 - 2149.92] and the
[2147.64 - 2151.20] cheese that doesn't fix it so what
[2149.92 - 2154.64] happens is the reason why people can
[2151.20 - 2157.36] feel all that roughage sometimes like
[2154.64 - 2161.44] raw lettuces and raw kale
[2157.36 - 2164.80] and raw collared greens and raw zucchini
[2161.44 - 2168.44] and raw redbell peppers and raw Tomatoes
[2164.80 - 2170.52] they feel it because they're inflamed in
[2168.44 - 2173.68] the intestinal tract so when that's
[2170.52 - 2175.64] moving through you you feel it more and
[2173.68 - 2178.64] the nerve endings on the intestinal
[2175.64 - 2180.76] tract Linings are sending signals to you
[2178.64 - 2182.92] that it's not digesting it's not
[2180.76 - 2185.16] breaking down but it is breaking down it
[2182.92 - 2187.36] is digesting you just don't know it so a
[2185.16 - 2189.24] lot of people they go into panic they go
[2187.36 - 2192.08] into fear and they think they're not
[2189.24 - 2194.72] breaking down their food and they can't
[2192.08 - 2197.72] eat lettuce and they can't eat a tomato
[2194.72 - 2199.96] and they can't eat a red bell pepper and
[2197.72 - 2202.80] they can't eat an apple because they
[2199.96 - 2204.32] feel it and it's just too much roughage
[2202.80 - 2206.60] and it's moving through them and they're
[2204.32 - 2208.08] better off just eating like eggs every
[2206.60 - 2211.68] single
[2208.08 - 2213.12] day something soft like ice cream and
[2211.68 - 2216.44] eggs and
[2213.12 - 2218.76] cheese and maybe chicken or something or
[2216.44 - 2221.16] some meat and that's all they feel like
[2218.76 - 2225.40] they can do but they don't realize it
[2221.16 - 2227.48] that what happens is that the fruits and
[2225.40 - 2229.44] the leafy greens and vegetables are
[2227.48 - 2232.28] actually letting people know there's hot
[2229.44 - 2235.12] spots in their intestinal tract those
[2232.28 - 2238.08] hot spots are inflamed areas where the
[2235.12 - 2241.64] nerves are sensitive because of
[2238.08 - 2243.84] pathogens viruses and bacteria that are
[2241.64 - 2245.92] in the Linings of the intestinal tract
[2243.84 - 2247.96] nesting in there and when they're in
[2245.92 - 2250.20] there NES
[2247.96 - 2252.36] they're creating inflammation which are
[2250.20 - 2254.48] hot spots so as you're eating the
[2252.36 - 2256.12] roughage and the roughage is going down
[2254.48 - 2258.60] there and the lettuces and the greens
[2256.12 - 2260.52] are moving through they're hitting those
[2258.60 - 2262.56] hot spots and that's when people are
[2260.52 - 2264.80] feeling it like I can't digest I'm not
[2262.56 - 2267.32] digesting something's wrong I can't
[2264.80 - 2270.40] break down the food I need to be on just
[2267.32 - 2273.28] like four eggs a day and and some kind
[2270.40 - 2275.64] of like mono you know carnivore thing or
[2273.28 - 2278.32] something and they don't realize it is
[2275.64 - 2282.20] they got sensitive nerves in sensitive
[2278.32 - 2285.48] Linings and they're just feeling it it
[2282.20 - 2287.48] doesn't mean it's not breaking down or
[2285.48 - 2289.84] digesting so let's get to the liver a
[2287.48 - 2291.76] little bit more okay rejuvenating the
[2289.84 - 2295.40] liver bringing the liver
[2291.76 - 2297.48] back that is one of the big keys if you
[2295.40 - 2299.80] want to take control over your health
[2297.48 - 2301.68] it's bringing back the liver and so many
[2299.80 - 2304.32] people are you know eating better and
[2301.68 - 2306.56] they're doing better things now out
[2304.32 - 2307.92] there and so their liers improve
[2306.56 - 2309.76] improving just from the good things
[2307.92 - 2312.72] they're doing doesn't mean it's getting
[2309.76 - 2315.48] them out of the woods
[2312.72 - 2318.00] entirely so bringing back the liver
[2315.48 - 2321.08] getting it out of stagnancy and
[2318.00 - 2325.16] sluggishness getting it out of
[2321.08 - 2330.44] overburden bringing it back key right
[2325.16 - 2333.60] there to IBS to bloating to
[2330.44 - 2335.52] constipation getting your stomach strong
[2333.60 - 2340.24] so let's go into the stomach a little
[2335.52 - 2344.80] bit you guys important
[2340.24 - 2348.00] okay inside your stomach are glands
[2344.80 - 2349.32] those glands produce your HCL that HCL
[2348.00 - 2350.84] is
[2349.32 - 2354.16] everything
[2350.84 - 2359.00] everything that hydrochloric acid which
[2354.16 - 2362.96] is a seven blend seven blend of acids
[2359.00 - 2366.08] that HCL is critical to breaking down
[2362.96 - 2368.84] your food but also breaking down
[2366.08 - 2370.68] different aspects of the food so that we
[2368.84 - 2373.56] get the nutrients we need and we get
[2370.68 - 2377.48] what we need to get out of it right
[2373.56 - 2380.92] there okay so the stomach stomach glands
[2377.48 - 2383.20] HCL big part of recovery big part of
[2380.92 - 2385.44] recovery for the liver
[2383.20 - 2387.44] too so if you're somebody that's out
[2385.44 - 2389.64] there and you're like I got hypoglycemia
[2387.44 - 2392.40] my blood sugar's all over the place I'm
[2389.64 - 2395.12] struggling with that I got bloating I
[2392.40 - 2397.72] got problems constipation I got IBS or I
[2395.12 - 2400.04] had IBS or I got gas where I got all
[2397.72 - 2401.92] kinds of stitches and
[2400.04 - 2404.08] cramps
[2401.92 - 2406.80] gastritis
[2404.08 - 2409.68] diagnosis maybe some of your Crohn's
[2406.80 - 2412.52] colitis maybe somebody dealing with
[2409.68 - 2414.24] that ammonia gas leeching through the
[2412.52 - 2417.16] body maybe you
[2414.24 - 2420.20] smell maybe you're somebody and you
[2417.16 - 2423.56] stink so you just got smell coming out
[2420.20 - 2425.32] of your pits and you got smell coming
[2423.56 - 2427.00] off of you and people somebody or
[2425.32 - 2428.96] somebody in your family or somebody your
[2427.00 - 2431.64] friend is just like man you
[2428.96 - 2433.80] smell you go what's going on are you
[2431.64 - 2435.80] okay you got a strong smell what is
[2433.80 - 2437.80] going on with you maybe you're somebody
[2435.80 - 2440.44] that just they
[2437.80 - 2442.08] stink that's another thing too it's from
[2440.44 - 2444.52] getting toxic and getting the liver
[2442.08 - 2447.92] toxic and everything being all hung up
[2444.52 - 2450.04] and stuck and sluggish stagnant so it's
[2447.92 - 2452.48] critical to get these things better so
[2450.04 - 2455.64] another thing too let's go into it a lot
[2452.48 - 2457.28] of people's livers are inhabited they're
[2455.64 - 2459.24] inhabited
[2457.28 - 2461.80] from pathogens and pathogens you're
[2459.24 - 2465.56] sitting inside the liver viruses
[2461.80 - 2471.08] bacteria sitting inside the liver ebvs
[2465.56 - 2474.88] hhv 6s cyto megl viruses hhv7 simplex
[2471.08 - 2478.48] one 2 all these different bugs
[2474.88 - 2481.64] strep staff H
[2478.48 - 2485.24] pylori all sitting inside the liver
[2481.64 - 2489.56] making it more stagnant and more
[2485.24 - 2492.12] sluggish so eating foods that don't feed
[2489.56 - 2494.84] those bugs is critical to recovery so
[2492.12 - 2497.60] knowing what foods to eat it's critical
[2494.84 - 2501.28] to have the information right there like
[2497.60 - 2506.20] deliver rescue and cleanse the
[2501.28 - 2508.24] heel right there important
[2506.20 - 2510.44] information one of the reasons why so
[2508.24 - 2513.08] many people heal from celery juice
[2510.44 - 2514.68] drinking their celery juice every day is
[2513.08 - 2518.08] because it's restoring the stomach
[2514.68 - 2520.12] glands inside of the stomach the ones
[2518.08 - 2523.40] that produce your gastric acid which is
[2520.12 - 2527.28] your HCL and the celery juice every
[2523.40 - 2529.16] single day gives you a liver flush you
[2527.28 - 2532.20] have it in the morning especially gives
[2529.16 - 2535.08] you a liver flush helps to push the
[2532.20 - 2536.92] poisons and the toxins out and another
[2535.08 - 2538.36] thing the celery juice does too is it
[2536.92 - 2540.36] lowers
[2538.36 - 2543.20] pathogen
[2540.36 - 2546.28] proliferation breaks down bugs and
[2543.20 - 2549.36] pathogens bringing them down to a lower
[2546.28 - 2551.92] level over time it's just one of the
[2549.36 - 2554.20] medical medium tools if there's any

[2659.92 - 2663.20] medium newsletter let's talk about
[2661.76 - 2665.00] constipation a little
[2663.20 - 2667.84] bit
[2665.00 - 2670.40] constipation most constipation issues
[2667.84 - 2673.44] are from inflamed areas inside the
[2670.40 - 2676.80] intestinal tract somebody might have an
[2673.44 - 2679.24] inflamed area in the elen somebody might
[2676.80 - 2682.40] have an inflamed area the descending
[2679.24 - 2685.28] colon the ascending colon and what
[2682.40 - 2688.24] happens is because it's inflamed poop
[2685.28 - 2690.88] can't move through okay another reason
[2688.24 - 2694.20] why people have constipation issues this
[2690.88 - 2696.68] peristaltic action has stopped because
[2694.20 - 2699.16] their vagus nerve is causing a problem
[2696.68 - 2700.84] where the vegus nerve is inflamed not
[2699.16 - 2704.28] getting the right signals to the
[2700.84 - 2706.60] intestinal tract so it's neurological
[2704.28 - 2708.12] constipation is what I call it so it's
[2706.60 - 2710.56] another reason so many people get
[2708.12 - 2711.68] constipation and another reason why it's
[2710.56 - 2713.64] because when they're inflamed they're
[2711.68 - 2715.88] inflamed with a lot of bad bacteria in
[2713.64 - 2718.12] certain pockets of the intestinal tract
[2715.88 - 2720.56] and expansions and narrowings have have
[2718.12 - 2722.52] occurred and so the fecal matter gets
[2720.56 - 2724.36] hung up and stuck in different areas
[2722.52 - 2726.64] between that and the peristaltic action
[2724.36 - 2730.24] not being there plus areas that are
[2726.64 - 2732.60] inflamed all these things can heal so
[2730.24 - 2734.44] many people on MM info have gotten their
[2732.60 - 2735.24] inflammation down in their gut restored
[2734.44 - 2737.56] their
[2735.24 - 2739.04] livers and they're going to bathroom
