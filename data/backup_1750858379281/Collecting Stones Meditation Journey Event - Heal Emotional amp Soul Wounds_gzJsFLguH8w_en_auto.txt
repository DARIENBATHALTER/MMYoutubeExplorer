[61.44 - 66.24] we are made up of minerals but every
[64.68 - 67.92] single
[66.24 - 69.84] living
[67.92 - 73.62] creature
[69.84 - 73.62] living vegetation

[78.36 - 85.26] made up of minerals
[81.54 - 88.68] stones are made up of minerals
[85.26 - 90.90] every single living life form in this
[88.68 - 93.48] solar system
[90.90 - 95.88] and Beyond in the galaxy and other
[93.48 - 97.80] galaxies and other solar systems in
[95.88 - 101.48] other galaxies and
[97.80 - 101.48] anywhere else in the universe

[104.16 - 110.34] mineral precious mineral compositions
[108.06 - 112.32] so all life
[110.34 - 113.76] everywhere
[112.32 - 116.52] if you're someone that doesn't believe
[113.76 - 119.28] there's life beyond our planet then just
[116.52 - 120.72] all life here on this planet
[119.28 - 123.96] if you're somebody that doesn't believe
[120.72 - 126.66] there's life in another solar system
[123.96 - 129.80] in another galaxy somewhere else in the
[126.66 - 133.46] universe that's fine then all life here
[129.80 - 133.46] in this solar system
[133.50 - 138.30] so I want to invite you guys to sign up
[136.62 - 141.12] to the collecting Stones meditation
[138.30 - 142.68] Journey because it is going to be
[141.12 - 144.42] profoundly
[142.68 - 146.58] healing
[144.42 - 149.28] and I can't wait for you to experience
[146.58 - 151.92] it so let's talk about it a little bit
[149.28 - 154.32] each day you're gonna get
[151.92 - 155.94] some videos
[154.32 - 158.22] and
[155.94 - 159.72] what we're going to do is it starts on
[158.22 - 161.16] the 19th so first of all let's just get
[159.72 - 163.98] organized on that level today's
[161.16 - 165.78] registration today's the 12th
[163.98 - 169.10] the 19th
[165.78 - 169.10] is when it starts
[169.44 - 173.46] now if you're familiar with the
[171.06 - 176.22] collecting Stone's meditation out here
[173.46 - 177.90] in in medical medium New Edition if
[176.22 - 180.96] you're familiar with this or you've done
[177.90 - 182.22] this before through the book okay we've
[180.96 - 184.68] never done this before though we've
[182.22 - 186.96] never done one where I'm guiding you
[184.68 - 189.36] through a seven day
[186.96 - 191.76] Journey with this but if you're somebody
[189.36 - 195.42] that's done this before
[191.76 - 197.82] collect your stones on the day it starts
[195.42 - 200.52] if you can if you can't collect your
[197.82 - 204.08] stones on the day it starts
[200.52 - 204.08] so I got three stones right here
[204.72 - 211.44] I'm using these Stones as examples right
[208.62 - 212.76] so if you haven't collected your Stones
[211.44 - 217.14] yet
[212.76 - 219.00] wait until the 19th the first day of the
[217.14 - 221.16] seven day collecting Stone's meditation
[219.00 - 222.54] Journey now for some reason if you're
[221.16 - 224.28] not going to be able to do it that day
[222.54 - 226.20] if you're not going to be somewhere
[224.28 - 228.18] where there's Stones if you're not going
[226.20 - 229.44] to be able to find any stones for some
[228.18 - 230.88] reason maybe you're traveling maybe
[229.44 - 232.80] you're doing something then collect your
[230.88 - 235.26] Stones before
[232.80 - 238.92] the 19th
[235.26 - 241.08] so collect them at an earlier time frame
[238.92 - 242.52] if it's the only chance you have and the
[241.08 - 245.46] only way you can actually do this
[242.52 - 247.62] collecting Stone's meditation Journey
[245.46 - 249.42] so it's going to be really exciting so
[247.62 - 252.24] you might probably but here's the thing
[249.42 - 253.80] here's what I recommend go and scope out
[252.24 - 256.98] a spot
[253.80 - 259.32] maybe have an idea of where you're going
[256.98 - 261.48] to collect your stones
[259.32 - 263.16] maybe it's going to be some grassy
[261.48 - 265.14] Knolls somewhere maybe it's going to be
[263.16 - 267.84] some field maybe it's going to be some
[265.14 - 269.70] trail maybe it's going to be a park
[267.84 - 271.14] maybe it's going to be a beach wherever
[269.70 - 274.92] it is
[271.14 - 276.36] kind of get that in a place mentally
[274.92 - 278.70] emotionally where am I going to get my
[276.36 - 280.38] Stones where am I going to go and you
[278.70 - 282.18] can make that plan is it going to be in
[280.38 - 283.44] your yard is it going to be around your
[282.18 - 284.70] apartment building is it going to be
[283.44 - 287.46] around your house is it going to be
[284.70 - 289.56] around a friend's house someone said
[287.46 - 292.26] Trails I saw that
[289.56 - 295.20] so if you had trouble signing up through
[292.26 - 298.98] the link earlier we sent out a new link
[295.20 - 301.02] via email and you can sign up to that
[298.98 - 302.94] link in the description of this live or
[301.02 - 305.16] the profile
[302.94 - 307.08] so if you had a harder time signing up
[305.16 - 308.40] earlier and it was difficult because I
[307.08 - 310.70] saw some people had a difficult time
[308.40 - 314.28] signing up
[310.70 - 316.98] then try to sign up now we have a
[314.28 - 318.96] different link we're using
[316.98 - 321.12] a different
[318.96 - 323.22] way of doing it so
[321.12 - 325.04] let's go into it a little bit
[323.22 - 328.02] so what is the collecting Stones
[325.04 - 330.00] meditation Journey
[328.02 - 331.74] I was saying before stones have an
[330.00 - 334.62] ability
[331.74 - 337.08] to absorb
[334.62 - 339.36] but that ability is not tapped into
[337.08 - 342.78] totally
[339.36 - 345.78] walking by stones
[342.78 - 349.38] having a stone in your hand for a minute
[345.78 - 350.94] throwing a stone into a lake or into a
[349.38 - 353.34] river stream and you're just kind of
[350.94 - 355.08] skipping Stones right
[353.34 - 358.26] skipping rocks
[355.08 - 361.20] there's only a moment in time
[358.26 - 363.30] where there's a connection happening
[361.20 - 365.52] so if you go to a beach and you want to
[363.30 - 368.16] skip some stones
[365.52 - 370.08] on a body of water
[368.16 - 371.52] there's only that second where you pick
[370.08 - 373.56] the stone up
[371.52 - 376.02] and you're like I'm gonna just skip the
[373.56 - 379.14] stone here right and you do that
[376.02 - 380.88] the connection is small
[379.14 - 382.44] it's quick
[380.88 - 383.94] there's a big difference though when
[382.44 - 386.10] you're doing the collecting Stones
[383.94 - 388.98] meditation because
[386.10 - 392.04] when you're doing it that way
[388.98 - 397.26] something incredible happens
[392.04 - 399.06] and a deeper connection starts to occur
[397.26 - 401.34] and when that deeper connection starts
[399.06 - 403.70] to occur something else starts to happen
[401.34 - 403.70] too
[404.22 - 407.64] so there's a
[405.84 - 409.14] phrase where you say well you become one
[407.64 - 412.62] with something
[409.14 - 414.24] you become connected with something
[412.62 - 416.70] well when you're doing the collecting
[414.24 - 419.28] Stones meditation Journey starting on
[416.70 - 422.82] the 19th you got to sign up for it to
[419.28 - 424.74] get the videos by the way it's free
[422.82 - 427.94] but you guys already know that because
[424.74 - 427.94] that's all I do is free stuff
[429.42 - 435.18] but what happens is when you start that
[432.12 - 437.76] Journey on the 19th
[435.18 - 440.64] something's going to happen
[437.76 - 443.52] a deep deep rooted connection is going
[440.64 - 446.06] to occur with you and your stones that
[443.52 - 446.06] you choose
[446.46 - 452.70] put my Stones right there
[449.16 - 457.20] and that deep connection is gonna allow
[452.70 - 459.60] a transference process to happen
[457.20 - 463.64] sounds incredible
[459.60 - 463.64] yeah because it is incredible
[463.68 - 467.12] incredibly incredible
[468.36 - 472.08] if I dare say
[470.64 - 475.02] because what's going to happen is this
[472.08 - 479.58] transference is going to occur where
[475.02 - 482.64] something inside of you is going to
[479.58 - 487.28] frequency out of you
[482.64 - 487.28] it's going to travel on a frequency
[487.32 - 494.42] holding information
[490.20 - 494.42] that's going to absorb into your stones
[494.70 - 498.06] now if you're somebody that loves
[495.96 - 499.68] crystals I don't recommend taking your
[498.06 - 501.12] favorite crystals and using it it's not
[499.68 - 504.06] going to work I'm not saying your
[501.12 - 506.94] favorite crystals don't have powers or
[504.06 - 509.34] frequencies that's not it at all
[506.94 - 511.86] this is different
[509.34 - 513.54] entirely different
[511.86 - 516.12] because your favorite crystals have
[513.54 - 519.18] already been in your home they've been
[516.12 - 522.12] in your apartment
[519.18 - 524.28] they were also
[522.12 - 526.26] crafted
[524.28 - 529.02] by man
[526.26 - 531.84] Crystal collectors
[529.02 - 533.64] that machine them make them look
[531.84 - 536.34] beautiful
[533.64 - 539.18] turn them into certain shapes cut them
[536.34 - 539.18] in certain shapes
[539.82 - 543.12] the stones you're going to find are
[541.26 - 546.12] stones that are naturally in the
[543.12 - 547.62] environment wherever they lay wherever
[546.12 - 550.32] they lie
[547.62 - 555.20] however they are
[550.32 - 555.20] and these Stones don't know you
[557.10 - 560.34] so if you have like crystals you really
[558.72 - 561.48] like you're like well I'll just use my
[560.34 - 562.92] crystals I'll go to my crystal
[561.48 - 565.14] collection
[562.92 - 567.12] do not do that it won't do the same
[565.14 - 569.04] thing when you do the collecting Stones
[567.12 - 571.08] meditation Journey
[569.04 - 574.80] you're going to be getting
[571.08 - 578.58] stones that are out in the wild
[574.80 - 580.26] that could even mean a grassy edge of a
[578.58 - 582.30] parking lot
[580.26 - 584.46] but in the wild
[582.30 - 587.28] not stones that have been sitting in
[584.46 - 589.14] your dresser
[587.28 - 591.30] in your house
[589.14 - 593.04] up against your windows
[591.30 - 595.98] for years
[593.04 - 597.60] those are special those need to stay in
[595.98 - 599.82] your home they're in your home they need
[597.60 - 602.76] to stay in your life the way you like
[599.82 - 605.10] them to but this is different
[602.76 - 606.06] because the stones you're going to seek
[605.10 - 608.46] out
[606.06 - 610.74] come the 19th after you signed up
[608.46 - 611.82] hopefully you signed up now and today to
[610.74 - 612.72] the collecting Stone's meditation
[611.82 - 615.54] Journey
[612.72 - 617.70] those stones
[615.54 - 619.44] are going to be meant
[617.70 - 621.12] for you
[619.44 - 626.24] for this reason
[621.12 - 626.24] for this profound way to transmit
[627.24 - 633.12] something out of you
[629.82 - 638.30] to frequency something out of you
[633.12 - 638.30] to absorb and draw something out of you
[638.34 - 644.40] that shouldn't be there anymore
[642.30 - 645.78] that's how profound and that's how
[644.40 - 649.16] incredible
[645.78 - 649.16] this journey is going to be
[650.34 - 655.80] because what we do is we Harbor toxic
[653.28 - 657.60] baggage from wounds that have been
[655.80 - 660.42] sitting inside of us for a very long
[657.60 - 662.58] time inside of our soul
[660.42 - 666.26] side of our heart inside of our spirit
[662.58 - 666.26] however you want to see it
[668.04 - 671.22] sign up to the collecting Stones
[669.36 - 674.12] meditation Journey so you can get your
[671.22 - 674.12] instructions
[674.64 - 681.02] Iona says I live in the city and there
[677.10 - 681.02] are barely any Stones kicking about
[681.84 - 685.98] if you are in a place where you're not
[684.18 - 688.26] going to be able to get Stones you can't
[685.98 - 690.84] find them in a park
[688.26 - 692.70] in the city you live in
[690.84 - 694.56] you can't find them on the edge of a
[692.70 - 696.24] sidewalk
[694.56 - 697.98] in a park
[696.24 - 699.30] we can't find them on the edge of a
[697.98 - 702.06] sidewalk
[699.30 - 704.70] in a grassy little section in the city
[702.06 - 707.36] if you can't find
[704.70 - 707.36] stones
[708.60 - 713.40] and you don't know somebody else that
[710.40 - 716.34] may have stones in their area or you
[713.40 - 718.92] don't have a friend or anything
[716.34 - 720.98] of sorts
[718.92 - 724.62] then that's when I would probably resort
[720.98 - 727.56] to purchasing
[724.62 - 728.64] some Stones if you can't before it
[727.56 - 731.16] starts
[728.64 - 734.52] maybe there's a website where you can
[731.16 - 736.92] purchase a few stones and you can choose
[734.52 - 740.28] the stones you want to use for this
[736.92 - 743.40] collecting Stone's meditation Journey
[740.28 - 745.14] so that that would be if you have no
[743.40 - 747.48] other way to do this
[745.14 - 750.84] why does this work because those stones
[747.48 - 753.00] don't know you
[750.84 - 754.98] they don't know you
[753.00 - 757.80] and your connection to those stones are
[754.98 - 760.08] going to be brand new
[757.80 - 762.00] but it's only if for some reason you
[760.08 - 765.12] can't get anywhere to find some Stones
[762.00 - 769.26] anywhere anyhow wherever you can't find
[765.12 - 772.14] them Parks Trails beaches Lakes grassy
[769.26 - 774.80] Knolls sidewalks near grass Parks again
[772.14 - 774.80] wherever
[779.34 - 784.14] Hannity says Stones here are all
[781.44 - 786.38] clusters of shells and sand will that
[784.14 - 786.38] work
[786.42 - 792.66] if it if it isn't just a clump of sand
[789.24 - 795.42] that falls apart once you squeeze it
[792.66 - 798.48] then it'll work
[795.42 - 802.76] so if it's a stone that like it's made
[798.48 - 802.76] out of shells and sand but really
[803.10 - 806.36] really hardened
[807.84 - 812.28] Chrissy says how many do we need
[809.64 - 814.14] probably need a bucket you do not need a
[812.28 - 815.76] bucket what you see right there is three
[814.14 - 819.30] stones
[815.76 - 821.10] on the medical medium New Edition
[819.30 - 824.36] if you don't have the medical mean new
[821.10 - 824.36] edition you should get it
[825.66 - 828.48] so make sure you get the medical meme
[827.22 - 831.12] New Edition the collecting Stones
[828.48 - 832.80] meditation is inside this book
[831.12 - 834.48] but the collecting Stones meditation
[832.80 - 837.18] Journey
[834.48 - 839.70] is going to be a series of videos
[837.18 - 840.78] that you're going to receive it's a
[839.70 - 843.06] seven day
[840.78 - 844.50] Journey I'm guiding you through but you
[843.06 - 846.66] should have the medical medium New
[844.50 - 849.72] Edition where the collecting Stones
[846.66 - 851.94] meditation originates from
[849.72 - 854.24] and you can see in there it's three
[851.94 - 854.24] stones
[855.12 - 859.34] and I have three zones in my hand right
[857.22 - 859.34] now
[859.62 - 862.44] we walk around with old hurt inside of
[861.72 - 864.54] us
[862.44 - 867.06] from many many years ago in our lives
[864.54 - 870.36] from betrayal broken trust
[867.06 - 873.60] not being validated not being heard
[870.36 - 877.82] being misunderstood being hurt by people
[873.60 - 877.82] that we love people we don't love
[879.38 - 885.90] relationships relationship breakups
[883.26 - 887.94] work relationships
[885.90 - 889.86] and that's just one Avenue of how we get
[887.94 - 892.26] hurt on this planet
[889.86 - 894.18] if anyone ever says I will never get
[892.26 - 898.86] hurt I've never been hurt I've never had
[894.18 - 901.38] a single upset from birth to whenever
[898.86 - 903.72] then they're not being truthful every
[901.38 - 905.46] single person
[903.72 - 909.20] feels hurt
[905.46 - 909.20] and gets a wound one way or another
[912.54 - 917.52] do we need to collect new Stones if we
[914.70 - 920.52] already have them yes you do
[917.52 - 922.20] you have to collect new stones for this
[920.52 - 923.82] journey
[922.20 - 925.14] if you already have stones and you got
[923.82 - 926.40] them sitting in your house they've been
[925.14 - 928.44] there for years or they've been there
[926.40 - 930.96] for months they're on the windowsill
[928.44 - 932.64] they're on your desk
[930.96 - 934.26] they're on
[932.64 - 937.86] your nightstand or wherever you keep
[934.26 - 939.12] stones or crystals or so forth
[937.86 - 942.42] you need
[939.12 - 944.70] three new stones for this collecting
[942.42 - 947.40] Stone meditation Journey
[944.70 - 948.54] if you can't collect them on the 19th on
[947.40 - 950.94] the first day of the collecting Stone
[948.54 - 953.82] meditation Journey
[950.94 - 956.52] then collect them before that
[953.82 - 959.06] and then get ready for that Journey
[956.52 - 959.06] that's coming
[961.50 - 965.04] link is in the description link is in
[963.84 - 967.92] the profile
[965.04 - 970.56] sign up hit the link
[967.92 - 972.30] it's working better now it was a little
[970.56 - 974.46] sticky this morning I heard a lot of
[972.30 - 976.68] people could not get on
[974.46 - 978.54] Trixie says zoom out after clicking the

[982.80 - 985.94] really appreciate it
[987.36 - 992.06] so I'm going to tell you something you
[989.88 - 992.06] guys
[993.54 - 997.74] this is going to be a ride
[995.88 - 999.48] something you've never experienced in
[997.74 - 1001.28] your life
[999.48 - 1003.88] I'm giving you kind of like a
[1001.28 - 1003.88] forewarning
[1004.64 - 1008.68] disclaimer whatever you call it
[1009.20 - 1014.96] but it may seem like oh it can't be
[1012.14 - 1018.70] anything that great
[1014.96 - 1018.70] but when you're doing this journey
[1018.80 - 1022.06] you're gonna feel it
[1023.00 - 1026.92] a deep connection is going to grow
[1027.74 - 1033.88] an unbelievably deep connection
[1030.68 - 1033.88] is going to grow
[1033.92 - 1038.66] is something miraculous is going to
[1036.44 - 1040.34] occur
[1038.66 - 1041.84] with this collecting Stone's meditation
[1040.34 - 1045.02] Journey
[1041.84 - 1047.30] I'm preparing you now which is
[1045.02 - 1051.52] a little talk
[1047.30 - 1051.52] saying hi to let you guys know
[1053.00 - 1055.94] that this is going to be a profound
[1054.62 - 1059.42] experience
[1055.94 - 1063.10] I have a smile on my face for a reason
[1059.42 - 1063.10] because when you do this journey
[1063.32 - 1068.36] it's going to be extremely emotional but
[1065.90 - 1071.26] extremely emotional
[1068.36 - 1073.22] in an incredible way
[1071.26 - 1075.86] life-changing way
[1073.22 - 1078.32] extremely emotional
[1075.86 - 1081.56] in a good way
[1078.32 - 1084.40] in a way that clears
[1081.56 - 1084.40] the Slate
[1087.56 - 1092.90] I can't tell you how excited I am for
[1090.80 - 1095.06] anyone
[1092.90 - 1097.24] and all of you that are partaking in
[1095.06 - 1097.24] this
[1097.82 - 1103.46] and by the way it's not three thousand
[1099.50 - 1106.54] dollars it's not two thousand dollars
[1103.46 - 1106.54] it's not anything
[1108.38 - 1114.46] it's free
[1110.78 - 1114.46] and it starts on the 19th
[1114.56 - 1118.40] so I'm happy to announce that today's
[1116.60 - 1119.90] registration day if you guys are coming
[1118.40 - 1122.72] on right now
[1119.90 - 1125.24] don't miss out
[1122.72 - 1126.98] on the medical medium
[1125.24 - 1129.26] collecting Stone's meditation Journey
[1126.98 - 1130.94] the link is in the description link is
[1129.26 - 1132.86] in the profile
[1130.94 - 1134.90] sign up
[1132.86 - 1136.70] and start to think about where you're
[1134.90 - 1139.22] going to get your stones
[1136.70 - 1143.56] where are they
[1139.22 - 1143.56] where are these Stones going to be
[1144.62 - 1149.00] where can they be
[1147.14 - 1151.40] are they in the park are they on a trail
[1149.00 - 1156.56] are they at the beach are they just in
[1151.40 - 1158.60] the yard are they on a grassy sidewalk
[1156.56 - 1162.64] where are these Stones now here's
[1158.60 - 1162.64] another thing too the size of the Stone
[1164.48 - 1170.12] doesn't matter in the sense that there
[1167.18 - 1174.52] has to be a rule where the stone has to
[1170.12 - 1174.52] be a certain length or a certain size
[1176.48 - 1182.54] your stone can be any size you choose
[1179.18 - 1185.56] there's going to be three stones
[1182.54 - 1185.56] that are chosen
[1186.80 - 1191.78] now as you're choosing Stones you'll see
[1189.80 - 1195.80] on the 19th
[1191.78 - 1198.92] some tips as far as choosing them
[1195.80 - 1202.52] but size of the stones
[1198.92 - 1204.62] determines on how comfortable you are
[1202.52 - 1207.38] obviously you probably don't want to
[1204.62 - 1209.24] choose a stone that's like this big
[1207.38 - 1211.64] super heavy
[1209.24 - 1213.74] super cumbersome
[1211.64 - 1215.36] but if for some reason that's the stones
[1213.74 - 1217.28] you choose because that's what you want
[1215.36 - 1219.86] then I understand
[1217.28 - 1221.60] as you see here there's an example
[1219.86 - 1222.92] there's three stones in my hand right
[1221.60 - 1225.50] now
[1222.92 - 1228.56] and wait until Monday
[1225.50 - 1230.30] July 19th to choose your Stones unless
[1228.56 - 1233.98] you have no ability to choose your
[1230.30 - 1233.98] stones on July 19th
[1235.34 - 1241.24] and you need to choose them a little bit
[1237.32 - 1241.24] earlier it's Wednesday not Monday
[1241.94 - 1247.88] some so Wednesday July 19th
[1245.30 - 1249.80] choose your Stones then unless you have
[1247.88 - 1252.26] no ability to choose your stones
[1249.80 - 1255.62] that day on any level and you want to
[1252.26 - 1258.20] choose them earlier
[1255.62 - 1261.26] so Stones can be of any size they can be
[1258.20 - 1263.18] this big they can be that big they can
[1261.26 - 1264.86] be this big they can be smaller than
[1263.18 - 1266.96] this
[1264.86 - 1268.88] if for some reason all you can find what
[1266.96 - 1271.04] looks like is little Pebbles and that's
[1268.88 - 1274.10] what you can find out there
[1271.04 - 1277.00] in nature or wherever you are then
[1274.10 - 1277.00] that's what you choose
[1278.84 - 1282.38] and stones are going to resonate to you
[1280.58 - 1284.48] when you see them
[1282.38 - 1286.04] and you're going to have a knowing but
[1284.48 - 1287.30] I'm really excited about this link is in
[1286.04 - 1288.62] the description the link is in the
[1287.30 - 1291.14] profile
[1288.62 - 1296.02] and get ready for this this is going to
[1291.14 - 1296.02] be an experience you will never forget
