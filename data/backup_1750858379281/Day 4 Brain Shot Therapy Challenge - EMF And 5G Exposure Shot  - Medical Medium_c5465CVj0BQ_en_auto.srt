you guys

16
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:32,340
EMF and 5 G exposure

17
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:35,060
let's get all the devices out

18
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,060

you guys exciting time

20
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:44,940
we're doing it in math and five G

21
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:48,660
exposure shot got my ingredients here I

22
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:53,400
got my brain saver books about you guys

23
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:57,540
here we are right there brain saver

24
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:59,459

your seat when you're reading what's in

29
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,900
these books and we're in the brain shot

30
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,700
therapy challenge which is incredible do

31
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:17,940
you guys you guys see it do you guys

32
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:20,640
read the lines do you read the lines in

33
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:23,099
these books in between the lines and all

34
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,140
around through these books packed with

35
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:27,360
information

36
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:29,879
incredible really and today is the EMF

37
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,819
5G exposure shot that's the one we're

38
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:34,200
doing let's take a look let's get there

39
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:36,540
now

40
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,700
you guys doing you know work on your

41
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:41,340
devices you're on your computers you're

42
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:45,720
on your phones that's what I am I'm

43
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:46,860
doing it all day long every day man and

44
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,680
that's the whole thing so let's go and

45
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:54,780
take a look there it is

46
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:56,879
EMF 5G exposure shot right there

47
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,799
so you just entered the medical medium

48
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:02,459
brain shot therapy cleanse challenge day

49
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:04,739
four if you're unaware of what's going

50
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:06,299
on stick around so you can learn because

51
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:09,360
it's going to be exciting there's so

52
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:12,120
much information here it's really

53
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,580
incredible all on its own so

54
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:17,040
the AMF 5G exposed shot let's talk about

55
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,359
that for a little bit ready okay try

56
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,940
this shot

57
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:23,460
if you spend a lot of time on computers

58
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:26,759
and computerized devices

59
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:29,759
so you do this shot if you spend a lot

60
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:32,040
of time on computers and computerized

61
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,440
devices right

62
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:37,740
so that's that okay how about this one

63
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:40,560
live near a high voltage area

64
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:44,639
does anybody live near a high voltage

65
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,560
area most people do most people do right

66
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,360
so let's see what else we got too here

67
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,919
right

68
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,880
all right

69
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:55,620
we got how about this one spending time

70
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,940
talking or texting on cell phones are

71
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:59,220
you guys doing that

72
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,660
spending time talking texting on cell

73
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,560
phones right I got my cell phone right

74
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,759
here

75
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,300
and

76
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:08,340
I'm doing it all the time I'm like

77
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:10,259
I got the phone I even put don't put

78
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:12,300
your phone to your ear I like it on

79
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:14,400
speakerphone but I'll even put the phone

80
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:16,259
to my ear all the time I mean I will do

81
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,440
that

82
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:23,400
but I have this EMF and 5G exposure shot

83
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:25,740
is what I have okay traveling by plane

84
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,780
is anybody traveling by plane that's a

85
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:30,300
whole nother one all on its own so

86
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:32,340
anybody traveling by plane right that's

87
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:35,100
another thing too

88
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:37,380
live or work close to others while

89
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,320
they're using devices so you live with

90
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:41,639
people that are using their devices

91
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:43,440
you're living with people that are

92
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:45,300
actually using their devices so that's

93
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,340
another thing too you're always around

94
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:51,120
them they're always doing using their

95
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:54,419
devices right the whole bit okay

96
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,220
spend your day within several feet of a

97
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:58,979
router how about that one so spending

98
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:00,180
your day within several feet from a

99
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:02,580
router

100
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:04,259
living near a cell tower and at this

101
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:07,740
point now

102
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:10,919
this point now we're all living near

103
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:13,320
cell towers it's very few of us that are

104
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:17,100
kind of so far from a cell tower but get

105
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:19,440
this if a cell tower can reach

106
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:22,800
your phone

107
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:25,319
or your devices it doesn't really matter

108
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,940
too much how far that cell tower is away

109
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:29,100
right

110
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:30,840
so that's something right there to

111
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:34,699
actually be concerned about all on its

112
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,699
own all right so we got that

113
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:39,120
so we're doing the EMF and 5T exposure

114
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,280
shot now here's the thing this is going

115
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,539
to be really exciting because it's that

116
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,819
powerful

117
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:46,680
and the medical mean brain shot

118
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:48,600
therapies are giving people direct

119
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:52,199
relief which is incredible instant

120
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:55,319
relief so let's go and look around here

121
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:58,440
for another little spot to talk about

122
00:06:55,319 --> 00:07:01,259
so medical medium brain shot therapy

123
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,919
that's where we are now

124
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:03,919
so

125
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:13,500
we're in the actual

126
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:16,440
we're just moving through here you guys

127
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:18,360
these are big books a lot of information

128
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,979
so medical mean brain shot therapy so

129
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,620
here's what's incredible about it that's

130
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:24,660
exactly where I was a minute ago

131
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:26,520
so here we are

132
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:30,360
your brain and body have a quick

133
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:32,699
response to the liquid aspect the highly

134
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,199
absorbable rate of what's happening when

135
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:37,380
you take these shots it goes right into

136
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:40,680
your blood vessels right into the nerves

137
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:43,020
right into the bloodstream fast quick

138
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,900
that's part of how they work but that's

139
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,979
part of the incredible magic of how they

140
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:50,220
work

141
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:52,380
so it's quick delivery right into the

142
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:54,300
blood vessels right into the bloodstream

143
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:55,860
which is absolutely incredible all on

144
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,080
its own medical medium brain shot

145
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:01,259
therapy is Uncharted Territory never

146
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,240
been done before no one has tried this

147
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:04,800
because they won't know science can't

148
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,080
figure this out food science can't

149
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,240
figure this out nobody can figure this

150
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,680
information out it comes from above I

151
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,620
would never be able to figure this out

152
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:15,960
these work they offer instant relief

153
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:19,379
because the information is coming from

154
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:21,360
above because no one would know to put

155
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:25,379
potato

156
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:27,780
which celery and parsley together in a

157
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:30,840
certain level of ingredients in the

158
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:33,899
combination in the order they are to

159
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:36,839
make it work so it stops EMF

160
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:37,620
from affecting you and 5G from affecting

161
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:39,839
you

162
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:42,959
and that's what's incredible we would

163
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,540
never know it's not possible there's not

164
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:47,459
going to be trillions of dollars

165
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:49,260
invested in scientists trying to figure

166
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:50,760
out putting these three together to

167
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:53,339
create this that's what's incredible on

168
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,680
its own Anthony people at work told me I

169
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:57,420
look more calm must be the medical mean

170
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,459
brain shots which leads to another

171
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:03,899
interesting piece of information right

172
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:05,640
here many people don't know what issues

173
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:07,440
they have within like we walk around

174
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,880
we're not really sure what's going on

175
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,399
and why we're dealing with so many

176
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,620
problems right they don't know what's

177
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:15,240
broken inside of them like what's broken

178
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,040
that needs to be fixed

179
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,779
so with medical medium brain shot

180
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,700
therapy you don't need to know what's

181
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:22,320
wrong for these shots to help you that's

182
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:24,060
the whole point you can do these shots

183
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,040
and then something happens later like

184
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:28,740
wait a minute I'm more calm

185
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:31,440
or wait a minute I'm thinking better

186
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:34,019
or wait a minute I'm stronger feeling

187
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,660
wait a minute I have more energy wait a

188
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:39,660
minute I don't need to nap wait a minute

189
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:42,660

all these things happen

194
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,260
so with the medical medium brain shot

195
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,360

196
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,200
wrong for these shots to actually help

197
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,779
you

198
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,240

medical meaning brain shots they find a

202
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:09,660

the shots down and let them find their

206
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:20,820
way if we don't know why we need them

207
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:23,160
that's one reason why the medical medium

208
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:25,800
Branch out therapy cleanses some of

209
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:27,839

people you take the shots

214
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:39,060
and if you do them every day or you you

215
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:42,320
choose to do a different shot each day

216
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:45,779

it's like working with the light when

223
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,440
you're working with the brain shot

224
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,420
Therapies

225
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,459
with medical medium brain shot therapy

226
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:04,620
however you decide to use it you venture

227
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:06,180
into Uncharted Territory with your

228
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:08,339
healing and that's another incredible

229
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:10,620
thing hazeling says I made this shot

230
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:13,019
this morning and it surprised me made me

231
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,760
feel very peaceful immediately and I

232
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:16,800
felt more relaxed doing work on my

233
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:19,560
laptop after well that's the thing I'm

234
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,899
using this brain shot we're doing right

235
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:25,079
now because I'm sitting there

236
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:27,839
I'm sitting there on my computers on my

237
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:30,959
devices right I'm on my phone like on

238
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:32,519
and off all day long and I'm using this

239
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,560
shot every day

240
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:36,600
Ellie says I was so surprised to see raw

241
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,720
potatoes in the recipe would have never

242
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,279
guessed it I would have never guessed it

243
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,620
no one I don't think would ever have

244
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:46,079
guessed it it because it's information

245
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,700
that comes from above like we don't know

246
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,399
then that's what's incredible about it

247
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:53,700
Abby Doom says after yesterday my mind

248
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,920
was my own more than usual I wasn't so

249
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,120
into fretting about anything or

250
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,560
everything

251
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,980
well that's the obsessive thought

252
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:04,140
shifter that was a powerful one ah that

253
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:05,579
one hit me real nice and real hard it

254
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:08,459
was like incredible when I took that one

255
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:09,839
down I was just like whoa the rest of

256
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:12,240
the day I was feeling it I did another

257
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,160
one later on and then I did one last

258
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,040
night and I was like and here's what's

259
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:19,560
crazy they build upon themselves they

260
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,779
build upon like each one like they even

261
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:24,480
get stronger or something it's it's so

262
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:26,700
different than what anybody would expect

263
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:30,060
I thought that raw potato was poisonous

264
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:31,440
uh no it's not poisonous so I hope that

265
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:33,540
clears that up for you the

266
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,100
misinformation that's out there it's not

267
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:37,440
your fault you think raw potato is

268
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:39,320
poisonous that's the misinformation out

269
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,720
there

270
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:44,579
it's really incredible

271
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,500
so when it comes to these medical

272
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:49,139
meaning brain shots it's good to explore

273
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:52,380
there's 30 different brain shot

00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:54,360

276
00:12:54,360 --> 00:13:00,720
explore it's so exciting cynette says

277
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:03,300
the grief shot helped me I lost my 23

278
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:06,600
year old son of fentanyl poison oh God

you know

286
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,300
the thing is about the brain shot

287
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,740
therapies is that when Spirit of

288
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:25,380
compassion was giving me that

289
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:27,120
information it was all about like what

290
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:29,459
people need in the moment to give them

291
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,560
relief for their suffering great

292
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:33,720
suffering that so many people are living

293
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,940
with right now and these shots are for

294
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,040

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,440

you get a chance and before we move on I

331
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:57,839
want to say something about the mm-1500

332
00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:00,360
what I'm seeing out there and it's kind

333
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,160
of sad is I see I can't sit there every

334
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,540
day and tell everybody about the juicers

335
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,120
I don't have time

336
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:08,100
so I can't I mean it's been months I

337
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:10,440
think since I even talked about them and

338
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:13,440
the problem is with that is that other

339
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:15,360
juicers companies they'll advertise to

340
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,820
the medical medium communities and

341
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,820
they'll sell them crappy juicers that

342
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:22,199
will lose not save them money and it

343
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:24,600
breaks my heart they'll sell them

344
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:26,820
juicers that have like spinning things

345
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:30,420
in them and baskets and all that stuff

346
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:33,000
and what happens is that if you want to

347
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:35,459
save money for the future because food

348
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,260
prices are going up look into the

349
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:41,120
mm-1500

350
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:44,579
look into the mm-900 because it squeezes

351
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:47,220
all the G like almost every bit of that

352
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:50,579
juice gets squeezed out so when I make

353
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:52,560
the shots I'm using less the problem is

354
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:55,199
with the juicers that are that are like

355
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,180
the juicer companies that are breaking

356
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:59,339
into the medical medium communities to

357
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:01,019
try to you know run ads and and

358
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:02,880
basically sell their juicers because

359
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:04,440
they they know that this is the place to

360
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,000
be because all the sharks out there know

361
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,040
that this is the place to be

362
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,959
they'll sell you a juicer

363
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:12,660
that doesn't save you money and doesn't

364
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:13,980
pay for itself it breaks my heart but I

365
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:15,720
can't sit there and be the juicer guy

366
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:18,300
where I'm

367
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:20,399
trying to show you guys a juicer every

368
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:23,160
single day of my life I can't I have to

369
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:25,079
work I have to I have to get you the

370
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:27,600
information in the books and everything

371
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:29,639
else I can't be the guy the juicer guy

372
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,019
trying to like show you a juicer every

373
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:31,800
day so you don't get ripped off out

374
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:34,320
there

375
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:37,079
so what I'm trying to say is when it's

376
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,639
the mm-1500 if you already have a juicer

377
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:40,680
fine but I'm saying this for people that

378
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:43,500
are actually getting suckered into

379
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:46,380
buying juicers that won't give them all

380
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:48,420
the maximum juice it kills me because

381
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:50,639
it's like okay

382
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,600
food costs money these ingredients cost

383
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,820
money

384
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,980
and what's happening is like with these

385
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:59,519
juicers not all Omega juicers the

386
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:01,980
mm-1500 it has a compression to it and

387
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:04,799
squeezes more juice out of it so that

388
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:07,799
you get more shots for your money you're

389
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:10,199
buying less produce for more shots less

390
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:11,819
celery for more celery juice

391
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:13,919
I don't want to sit here and talk about

392
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:15,780
a juicer all day but I have because we

393
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,179
have so much to cover but I'm trying to

394
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:20,100
tell you guys that the Sharks got into

395
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:22,740
the medical medium community

396
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:25,559
and they scam everybody and then you

397
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:27,000
lose money and produce is going up and

398
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:29,220
you're juicing and losing all your juice

399
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,280
and it's it's breaking my heart I had to

400
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:34,860
say it I have to but someday

401
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:37,620
if you save up it's no big deal this is

402
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:42,419
20 off though someday if you get a 1500

403
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:44,280
or a 900 mm 900 1500 you can save so

404
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:45,660
much money it's paid for itself and paid

405
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,760
for itself and paid for itself over and

406
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:49,860
over again I don't even know what to say

407
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,440
let's see Sunny says yeah my juicer only

408
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:54,120
made one and so much was wasted exactly

409
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,740
but here's the thing the sharks have

410
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,840
come into the communities if you guys

411
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:00,539
can just be aware of this

412
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:03,059
I can't keep track of it all I can't I

413
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:04,500
can't protect everybody I'm trying but

414
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:06,360
the sharks get in

415
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,100
and they're gonna sell you these juicers

416
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,660
and everybody's gonna be using juicers

417
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,460
and throwing all their ingredients out

418
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:13,980
all their stuff like they're gonna need

419
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:15,840
so much more and it's gonna cost them so

420
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:18,000
much money

421
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,700
um doodle love says if it's so funny

422
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,980
when I see sharks bashing you but then

423
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,900
right after they bash they parrot your

424
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:26,940
info oh my God that's all they do out

425
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:29,220
there they all try to step on me and

426
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:31,020
then they take the information I wish I

427
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:34,020
could say names right now but I'm not

428
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:35,280
that mean of a person where I could you

429
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,900
know what I mean but I wish I could give

430
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,940
you all the podcast doctor names and

431
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,679
everybody of what they've done and what

432
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:42,240
they do Meanwhile we're the community

433
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:44,340
that's getting people better it's

434
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,200
actually psycho

435
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:48,140
um Meg says I have noticed my celery

436
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:51,000
Bunch goes further since I bought the

437
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:52,919
mm-1500 exactly so what I'm trying to

438
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,240
tell you guys and this is critical the

439
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:56,280
sharks have come in with juicer

440
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,100
companies and ads they're trying to

441
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:01,440
poach the whole medical medium Community

442
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:03,419
everybody's buying these juicers that

443
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,100
are different they're likes the spinner

444
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:07,980
things and this and things and all that

445
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:10,740
in it right and and what's happening

446
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:12,900
love my Omega mm-1500 Chloe amazing

447
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:13,799
what's happening is you're going to lose

448
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,780
money

449
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:17,580
you're going to lose money

450
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:19,799
you need your juicer to pay for yourself

451
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:22,320
you need your juicer to work for you to

452
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:24,360
work for you I'm just being honest and

453
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,640
that's what happens the juicer works for

454
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:28,919
me the juicer works for you meaning it's

455
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,940
there to save you money so it pays for

456
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:32,460
itself

457
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:33,780
if you buy juicers that are you they're

458
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:35,340
all they're all trying to bust into the

459
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,480
medical medium community and go on the

460
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:39,179
juicer ride

461
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,400
and and just poach all the people and

462
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:44,640
sell them juicers so if you already got

463
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:46,740
suckered and tricked think about in the

464
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,020
future maybe you correct the mistake

465
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:50,880
later down the road or whatever you know

466
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:52,500
and when you're making these shots and

467
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,600
juicing your celery you're you're going

468
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,220
to lose so much money on those juicers

469
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,660
that's what I've learned because I've

470
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:00,960
tried them all I know the ones that

471
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:03,900
people have and still they don't compare

472
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:07,200
to the compression and the the mm 1500

473
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:09,600
and 900 I have to say this because I got

474
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,980
I guess I got lazy with the juicers in a

475
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,480
sense where I've been too busy trying to

476
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,860
get the book done too trip busy trying

477
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,140
to get everything done and I can't keep

478
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:18,360
up with everything because I assume

479
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:21,419
everybody knows these are the best

480
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:24,419
but then all of a sudden the Sharks come

481
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:26,340
in and everybody gets taken and then

482
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:29,039
they're spending this much more for

483
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:31,380
their produce and it's unfair and it's

484
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:33,539
ripping them off and it makes me sick

485
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:35,100
that's so sad

486
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:38,179
so anyway

487
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,179
let's move on to it

488
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:42,900
if I'm excited

489
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:44,700
the brain shot therapy is about that

490
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:46,919
absorption it's also about the

491
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:49,260
ingredients being put together all of it

492
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:51,840
that's critical really incredible the

493
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:53,880
whole process so let's go into some info

494
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,280
really quick you guys so I'm in brain

495
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:58,740
saver right here

496
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:00,299
okay these are the two books do you have

497
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,740
one

498
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:03,720
and

499
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:06,299
I'm in this little section here called

500
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:09,240
coexisting with electricity so I'm in

501
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:12,120
the EMF chapter here's the incredible

502
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,860
thing about the brain saver books

503
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:17,460
right

504
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:20,580
it's EMF information nobody knows about

505
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:23,160
EMF information nobody knows about I'm

506
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:24,960
saying that because everybody in the EMF

507
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,940
world thinks they got it down and thinks

508
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,100
they know everything about EMF

509
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:31,020
so if you look out there it's like

510
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:34,320
almost like you think it's all figured

511
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:35,940
out about EMF it's not that's the

512
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,200
incredible thing about Spirit of

513
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:39,419
compassion that's incredible thing about

514
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,380
the brain saver books information that's

515
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:43,919
unique

516
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:47,039
and brand new original powerful comes

517
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:48,360
from above and the EMF people once they

518
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,820
get their hands on this are going to be

519
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:54,419
parroting it and not citing it back so

520
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:56,220
the new information about EMF and I've

521
00:21:54,419 --> 00:21:58,860
put EMF information out there in the

522
00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:02,100
last 20 years in 30 years

523
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:04,799
so some of that is already out that was

524
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:06,419
originally from mm right

525
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,880
we're doing it again we're putting

526
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:11,280
original EMF information out there

527
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,840
and once again it will be stolen shortly

528
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,000
and then put out there as if it's been

529
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,919
known or something so let's go into it

530
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,320
coexisting with electricity when it

531
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:20,580
comes to

532
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,799
electromagnetic fields

533
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:25,140
check this out our brains can actually

534
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:27,000
adapt to certain electrical currents

535
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:29,520
that are around us in the last hundred

536
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,860
years our brain

537
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,059
science doesn't know this EMF people

538
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:35,520
don't know it

539
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:37,080
our brain adapts

540
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,659
to EMF

541
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:43,260
certain EMF

542
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:45,480
so we actually adapt to EMF

543
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:46,799
not always but check this out incredible

544
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,500
information so when it comes to

545
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:51,120
electromagnetic fields our brains can

546
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,039
actually adapt to certain electrical

547
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,720
currents that are around us in the last

548
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:57,299
hundred years

549
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:00,000
so when electricity happened and

550
00:22:57,299 --> 00:23:03,059
everybody's homes got electricity

551
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,340
we've been able to adapt to those

552
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:07,440
electrical currents

553
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:09,179
really important to know and the EMF

554
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:12,539
people don't know this

555
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:15,960
our brains have indeed adapted to EMF

556
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:18,659
produced from electricity

557
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:20,640
so our brains have adapted to EMF

558
00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:24,539
produced by electricity

559
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:26,640
electrical wiring buildings electrical

560
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:29,940
panels and appliances such as

561
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,620
dishwashers refrigerators ovens stoves

562
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:34,080
do you guys have dishwashers

563
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:35,400
do you guys have refrigerators do you

564
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,100
have stoves

565
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:40,020
do you have ovens

566
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:44,039
so r

567
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:46,919
brain has adapted to electrical wiring

568
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:50,220
buildings electrical panels appliances

569
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:53,520
dishwashers refrigerators ovens stoves

570
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:56,100
electric cars lights power strips and

571
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:58,919
surge protector protectors and air

572
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:00,960
conditioners heaters washing machines

573
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:04,020
and dryers

574
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,820
our brain in the last hundred years has

575
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:07,980
learned to adapt with electrical

576
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:10,559
currents out of all those things

577
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:12,240
information unknown to anyone right now

578
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:15,240
in history you're getting out of this

579
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:18,000
book right now and it's mind-blowing

580
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:20,280
but there's some we're we're not done we

581
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,000
ain't done

582
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:26,460
with this form of EMF we've adapted in

583
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,159
such a way that when the power is out

584
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:31,320
even if the temperature is comfortable

585
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:34,320
many people tend to go through mad

586
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:34,320
withdrawal

587
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:40,260
unknown to research in science unknown

588
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,700
to the EMF crowd experts unknown to the

589
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:44,460
scientists

590
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:46,559
that when we lose power in our home

591
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:48,480
apartment house

592
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:52,020
building

593
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:55,080
we start going mad

594
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:57,000
with withdrawal

595
00:24:55,080 --> 00:25:00,120
critical to know

596
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,460
we start losing it

597
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:04,740
when we lose our power

598
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:06,900
we've adapted to power in the last

599
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:09,600
hundred years to such a degree that we

600
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:11,340
start losing it without power and if you

601
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,260
think you know somebody like oh I know a

602
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:17,700
dude that camps out in the desert he's

603
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:20,280
got no power he's got a truck

604
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:22,200
most likely he's got a truck and he's in

605
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:24,360
that truck once in a while getting his

606
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:27,720
power fix

607
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:30,299
getting his power fixed so if you're

608
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:32,159
like oh no I know people just just cool

609
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:34,500
crowd that hangs out in the desert and

610
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:36,840
they're just around a fire and they're

611
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:39,299
just like Off the Grid and they got no

612
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:43,340
power around them they find power

613
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:43,340
periodically and they get a fix

614
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,580
because the withdrawal can make you go

615
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:52,620
mad we've had a hundred years of

616
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:54,840
adapting to power to electricity

617
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:56,940
is this not mind-blowing

618
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,320
when I heard that from Spirit of

619
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,520
compassion in my office when I was

620
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,200
writing that down

621
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,059
I think that was a moment when it was

622
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,860
like 4 30 and 5 o'clock in the morning

623
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:06,419
and I was feverishly writing the

624
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:08,340
information and trying to get it right

625
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:10,200
making sure every word was correct and

626
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:12,120
then throwing it back at Spirit of

627
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,679
compassion saying is that correct is

628
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:16,320
that what you said and then writing it

629
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,820
writing it and the information that came

630
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,799
through was

631
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:23,039
our brains

632
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:25,679
and our children babies in the womb

633
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:28,260
in everyone for a hundred years has

634
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:30,600
adapted two electrical magnetic fields

635
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:32,220
with electricity to appliances to

636
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,080
everything I just mentioned

637
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:35,340
in here earlier if you just got here

638
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,000
watch this from the beginning it's

639
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:38,000
mind-blowing

640
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:46,980
and so when we lose our power

641
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:49,679
we don't feel peaceful maybe for a

642
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:52,860
little bit but that peacefulness starts

643
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:56,279
to wear off and we start going mad with

644
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:59,039
power withdrawal

645
00:26:56,279 --> 00:27:00,720
and that's why even people who are are

646
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:02,539
like they try to live off the grid long

647
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:06,179
enough they're still back in their truck

648
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:07,740
and they're still using their LED lights

649
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:10,200
and they're still doing things because

650
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:13,440
they get they draw from it because they

651
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:15,360
can't handle it fully

652
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:18,600
so Danny says we have this in South

653
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:20,820
Africa it's called load shedding

654
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,919
the city cuts out power to save money

655
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:25,799
and you can feel the difference when the

656
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:28,320
power is no more anywhere you feel the

657
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:30,480
difference you feel the withdrawal right

658
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,520
and I almost think the energy companies

659
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,419
are just doing it to just mess with us

660
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,940
because

661
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:39,559
you know because they know we probably

662
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:39,559
react but they don't know what it is

663
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:45,360
servina says oh my God I always wondered

664
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:47,400
why I'm so stressed when the power goes

665
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,840
out even when I Juiced all my juices for

666
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,679
the day and everything is okay and

667
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,120
you're sitting there and you're like

668
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,980
okay the power's out but it's only going

669
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:55,500
to be about for a little while but you

670
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:57,419
actually get really upset right because

671
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:59,400
we're going through withdrawal nobody

672
00:27:57,419 --> 00:28:01,260
knows this information it's brand new

673
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,880
it's getting out now it's in these brain

674
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:04,380
saver books but the brain saver books

675
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,799
are packed like that it's it's just it's

676
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:09,120
all incredible but either way this is

677
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:12,299
the first time

678
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:14,880
this is getting out in the world nobody

679
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:16,980
knew we've adapted to that electricity

680
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,380
for a hundred years babies included

681
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:21,480
babies in the womb pregnant moms all of

682
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:23,580
it and we're just born into it we've

683
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,140
adapted and we're born into it and when

684
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:27,960
that power goes out we lose that power

685
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:30,360
we go through withdrawal and can even go

686
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:33,679
mad at at certain points depending how

687
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,679
long that withdrawal lasts

688
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:39,840
with this form of EMF we've adapted in

689
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,340
such a way that when the power is out

690
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,659
even if the temperature is comfortable

691
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:44,460
like you're saying and everything's okay

692
00:28:42,659 --> 00:28:48,419
you got your juices done everything's

693
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:50,820
great you go through withdrawal it's not

694
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:53,039
and it's not withdrawal from having the

695
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:55,200
luxury of an employ of a appliance

696
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:57,900
here's another thing all on its own so

697
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,820
it's not withdrawal from having like

698
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:02,820
it's not withdrawal from having like

699
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:04,799
being without the luxury of an appliance

700
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:07,860
of some kind

701
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:10,260
it's not that

702
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:12,960
it's withdrawal from the EMF itself so

703
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:15,179
it's actual EMF withdrawal that's what

704
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,400
we go through when the power's out

705
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:19,140
that's incredible because our brains

706
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:21,179
have learned to coexist with this type

707
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:24,480
of EMF so here's the whole point our

708
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:28,020
brains have learned to coexist with this

709
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:30,899
variety of EMF so when it's gone

710
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:34,260
we're going through it it's like a drug

711
00:29:30,899 --> 00:29:36,480
so it's almost like we've been drugged

712
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:38,640
for a hundred years with this type of

713
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,580
EMF and electricity and then when it's

714
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:44,039
pulled from us you guys you feel it

715
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:46,200
Sandy says I'd get upset when power goes

716
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:49,799
out I thought it was internet withdrawal

717
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:52,380
nope it's electricity withdrawal that's

718
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:54,600
the main thing right there

719
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:57,179
herbal Ministry said I tried explaining

720
00:29:54,600 --> 00:30:00,000
that to a doctor once and they had no

721
00:29:57,179 --> 00:30:03,539
idea what I was talking about

722
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,159
okay you ready because it only gets more

723
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:07,919
intense

724
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:10,140
as you know well in this book like the

725
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:12,600
brain story if you guys have read this

726
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:14,399
our brain is made out of electricity

727
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:16,740
think about that

728
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:17,700
our brain is made out of electricity you

729
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:20,600
guys

730
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,600
just letting you know

731
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:27,000
while it's not the same electricity that

732
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:28,260
powers our homes and appliances get

733
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,240
ready

734
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:33,179
our brain's electricity has learned to

735
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:35,700
coexist with this EMF admitting from all

736
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:37,559
this outside electricity so that our

737
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:39,720
brain can continue to function optimally

738
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:41,760
so check this out our brain has adapted

739
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:45,179
because if it didn't our brains would

740
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:48,620
not work anymore it had to coexist with

741
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:48,620
the electricity that's around us

742
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:52,580
foreign

743
00:30:54,559 --> 00:31:01,399
all this information is blowing my mind

744
00:30:57,539 --> 00:31:04,679
all this information is blowing my mind

745
00:31:01,399 --> 00:31:07,200
but is it blowing yours or is it just or

746
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:09,720
is this all in just it's just me being

747
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:12,200
too excited or something

748
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,200
okay

749
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,580
when you head to a spiritual Retreat

750
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:19,679
okay when you head to a spiritual

751
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:22,620
retreat in a shack that has no

752
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:27,799
electricity or you sit in an open field

753
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:27,799
with no electrical conveniences nearby

754
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:36,020
it's an experience

755
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:36,020
you're going through withdrawal

756
00:31:36,899 --> 00:31:40,500
you go to a retreat

757
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:44,399
and you're like

758
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:45,600
ah so nice out here I'm with like-minded

759
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:47,460
people

760
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,620
we're just talk we're sitting around a

761
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:51,659
campfire right now breathing in all that

762
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:53,580
smoke which isn't a good idea it's a

763
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:55,559
totally bad idea by the way but either

764
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:57,899
way we're out here

765
00:31:55,559 --> 00:32:00,659
and you're going through a trawl

766
00:31:57,899 --> 00:32:03,000
and your brain is learning to adjust and

767
00:32:00,659 --> 00:32:05,640
live without the EMF so your spiritual

768
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,520
it's Retreat your spiritual Retreat that

769
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:10,620
so many people go on is really without

770
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:12,779
them realizing this is about them living

771
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:14,760
without EMF and their brain's

772
00:32:12,779 --> 00:32:18,899
coexistence with it

773
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:18,899
tell me that's not unbelievable

774
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:25,080
music says is this why my neighbors

775
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:27,179
always argue and yell when the power

776
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,620
goes out

777
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:31,140
I mean

778
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:32,640
I don't know your neighbors

779
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:34,500
but I can

780
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,880
definitely bet that there's a good

781
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,860
chance that it's happening because of

782
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:40,380
that

783
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:43,520
now coexisting with the everyday let me

784
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:43,520
just ask Spirit of compassion

785
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:48,659
yes they argue any Spirit of compassion

786
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:49,740
just said to me your neighbors argue

787
00:32:48,659 --> 00:32:52,440
anyway

788
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:55,260
and they have fights anyway but when the

789
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:56,580
power goes out the fights amplify swear

790
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:59,279
to compassion just said

791
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:01,919
spirit's saying they have fights anyway

792
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:04,320
I don't know if I I don't know if I've

793
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:06,840
done this with you guys like this but

794
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,460
it's it's actually you know I try not to

795
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:12,140
do this

796
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:12,140
so I'm asking Spirit of compassion

797
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:16,440
one starts the fights more than the

798
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:18,480
other

799
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:20,820
and

800
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:23,279
it happens like every Sunday they get

801
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:25,740
into a fight but when the power goes out

802
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:26,880
it gets just amplifies because of the

803
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:29,220
withdrawal so that's the spirit of

804
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:31,019
compassion to set

805
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:33,539
but I'm not spying I don't know where

806
00:33:31,019 --> 00:33:37,940
the dampers are and I'm done a spying

807
00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:37,940
I'm just helping you with your question

808
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,659
now coexisting with the everyday

809
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:44,880
electricity around us and what is one

810
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:46,740
thing let's not confuse that with the

811
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,539
EMF admitting from dangerous high

812
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:49,559
voltage scenarios so here's another

813
00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:51,960
thing

814
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:53,580
this is the MF that we live around every

815
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,740
single day but I don't want you to be

816
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:58,140
confused with a dangerous high voltage

817
00:33:55,740 --> 00:34:02,399
EMF situation that's at a base station

818
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:03,779
so don't confuse that base station

819
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:05,640
with what we're talking about we're

820
00:34:03,779 --> 00:34:07,080
talking about appliances your house your

821
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:09,839
apartment power going out the

822
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:12,060
coexistence of you and that EMF your

823
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:13,200
brain and that EMF that's different than

824
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:15,599
pulling up to one of those power

825
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,700
stations with all that power crap going

826
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:19,740
on and boom that that high voltage

827
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:22,619
shooting out that's another story

828
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:24,419
we're not like adapted for that

829
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:25,919
that can affect somebody differently

830
00:34:24,419 --> 00:34:28,200
okay get ready for this this next

831
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:30,240
section is just incredible if you

832
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:33,800
thought that was incredible this next

833
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:33,800
section is incredible

834
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:38,520
and I'm on page 240 of brain saver you

835
00:34:36,839 --> 00:34:40,560
guys just come came on here you guys can

836
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:43,639
admit the brain saver books

837
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,639
when you get a chance

838
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:50,940
then there's radio frequency EMF

839
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:54,480
which is more aggressive than regular

840
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:56,760
EMF radio frequency EMF is more

841
00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:00,119
aggressive than regular EMF

842
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:03,060
with radio frequency EMF we're no longer

843
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:05,640
talking about simple electricity being

844
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:09,960
used to power an appliance

845
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:12,780
so radio frequency EMF is not about an

846
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:14,339
appliance running or your electricity in

847
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:16,800
your home

848
00:35:14,339 --> 00:35:18,980
we're talking about devices such as

849
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:21,720
computers and cell phones inter

850
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:23,099
interacting with wireless internet and

851
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:25,079
cell towers that's what we're talking

852
00:35:23,099 --> 00:35:26,460
about now hello

853
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:28,380
hello

854
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:31,260
don't put the phone right up against my

855
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:32,940
head okay what should I do put on

856
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:35,960
speaker

857
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:35,960
all right is that better

858
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,599
so we're talking about devices such as

859
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,660
computers and cell phones interacting

860
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:48,839
with wireless internet and cell towers

861
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:51,480
these are radio frequency emfs a lot

862
00:35:48,839 --> 00:35:53,400
different you guys Danny says love this

863
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:55,440
Celia music said well now I know the

864
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:58,380
truth

865
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:03,000
other sources of radio frequency EMF

866
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:06,000
include microwaves smart devices and

867
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,520
radar facilities that's an entirely

868
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:12,079
different situation that's something we

869
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:12,079
have not adapted to

870
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:18,119
there's even cell tower exposure when

871
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:21,119
you're not using your phone you can shut

872
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:23,820
down your phone and shut off your phone

873
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:25,380
and those radio frequencies are still

874
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:26,640
there so people say well I'm not going

875
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:28,200
to have a phone in my life I'm just

876
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,760
going to throw my phone out I'm just

877
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,320
going to shut it down you're still going

878
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,300
to get hit with the radio frequencies

879
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:35,280
every day because we can't avoid those

880
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:37,560
cell towers they're going through our

881
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,240
houses they're going through our

882
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:40,920
Apartments they're going through our

883
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:43,079
dwellings they're just going through

884
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:45,060
right

885
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:47,339
so we're getting exposure that way

886
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:49,680
anyway these radio frequencies coming

887
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:51,540
from cell towers enter our brain and hit

888
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,579
our neuron so check this out you don't

889
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:55,560
even need you don't have to be on your

890
00:36:53,579 --> 00:36:58,079
computer you don't have to be on your

891
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:59,520
iPad and whatever your phone you don't

892
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:01,560
have to be on that you're still getting

893
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,880
hit with the radio frequencies it's

894
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:04,920
still going to come from the cell towers

895
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,900
and be hitting your brain

896
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:09,359
that's just how it is here on planet

897
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:10,920
Earth right now this is what it is here

898
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:12,839
on planet Earth I'm just letting you

899
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:14,040
know like that's what planet Earth is

900
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:16,380
now

901
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:18,000
so there's even cell tower exposure when

902
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:20,160
you're not using your phone you can shut

903
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,960
down your phone your devices the radar

904
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,540
the radio frequencies are still there

905
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:26,099
traveling through every single Home and

906
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:28,440
Office Building

907
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:30,960
Susan said the cats get weird when the

908
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:35,760
power goes out they too have to adapt to

909
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:37,560
electricity for a hundred years exactly

910
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,900
Sue said can you please describe what

911
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:41,640
the withdrawal symptoms are like

912
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:43,920
I will in a couple of minutes that's

913
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:45,900
really that's a great question

914
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,000
so we're getting exposure that way now

915
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:50,160
here's the thing these radio frequencies

916
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,980
coming from cell towers enter our brain

917
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,540
and hit our neurons this exposure is a

918
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:57,000
bit more aggressive than your typical

919
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:58,619
appliances inside your house so this is

920
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,240
different people think it's the

921
00:37:58,619 --> 00:38:02,880
electricity inside their house that's

922
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:05,640
giving them EMF problems really when

923
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,440
it's really just it's radio frequencies

924
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:09,900
shooting through their home from their

925
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,760
cell towers whether you have a device or

926
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:13,440
not that's why I love this shot we're

927
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,480
doing if you just came on here we're

928
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,700
talking about 5G we're talking about

929
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:19,680
um EMF we're talking about that stuff

930
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:21,000
and this is this is a radiation chapter

931
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,160
too wait till you read this whole

932
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:26,000
chapter and read about radiation it's

933
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:26,000
it's insane

934
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:32,579
yet as aggressive as cell tower exposure

935
00:38:29,339 --> 00:38:34,859
is it is not as harmful as other forms

936
00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:36,240
of radio frequency EMF exposure that

937
00:38:34,859 --> 00:38:37,800
we'll get into in a moment so let's just

938
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,300
talk about this I'm saying about the

939
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,920
cell tower stuff but even though that's

940
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:44,220
harmful it's still not as harmful as

941
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:46,560
other things so harmful

942
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:48,300
just and you can toss your devices in

943
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:50,040
the garbage it's not going to change a

944
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:52,500
thing

945
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:54,300
that cell tower radio frequency is

946
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:56,460
beaming through everybody's house and

947
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:58,500
apartment and dwelling everywhere you

948
00:38:56,460 --> 00:39:01,020
can't stop it it's not about your device

949
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:03,300
or not throw all your devices down the

950
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:04,619
street down the road whatever in a in a

951
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:06,420
pond in a lake it's still going to be

952
00:39:04,619 --> 00:39:09,260
the same radio frequency going into your

953
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:09,260
house all day long

954
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:14,579
Irena says this information is so unique

955
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:17,220
it can only be from above true because I

956
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:19,260
am not a genius and a genius can't come

957
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:22,260
up with this information it is

958
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:24,420
absolutely mind-blowing thank you Irena

959
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:26,400
you guys know I'm not a smart guy I

960
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:27,660
never went to college I never went to

961
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,599
whatever

962
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:32,339
right I mean but you know what it is I'm

963
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:33,960
a good listener I can take down the

964
00:39:32,339 --> 00:39:35,460
information given to me word for word

965
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:37,200
and then I have to learn it just like

966
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:39,180
everybody else I have to become my own

967
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,619
expert just like you guys have to become

968
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:42,980
your own expert with the medical media

969
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:42,980
books

970
00:39:44,339 --> 00:39:48,300
I'm just a messenger

971
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:49,680
people parrot that now too by the way or

972
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:51,000
is I don't know what it was someone's

973
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,099
telling me if there's this influencer

974
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,380
dude it's got a really big ego

975
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:56,760
and um he's out there selling his

976
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:58,140
supplements and all this other crap or

977
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:01,079
whatever he's doing he's got a huge ego

978
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:02,460
now he's saying I'm the messenger I'm a

979
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:03,900
messenger he's just taking like

980
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:06,599
everything from medical mediums like

981
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:08,280
you're not a messenger

982
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:09,300
if you don't know what a messenger is

983
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,619
dude

984
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:13,140
anyway

985
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:16,160
you would be mind blown how much info in

986
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:16,160
the health field today

987
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:20,220
that comes from medical medium like SOC

988
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:22,320
and spirit of compassion that's out

989
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:24,480
there now so you think about it all the

990
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:26,040
new information I keep on putting out so

991
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,200
many people don't even realize it's from

992
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:30,119
my my information or SOC from three

993
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:32,579
years ago five years ago ten years ago

994
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:34,500
15 years ago you wouldn't believe how

995
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:37,980
Bleak the Alternative Health movement

996
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:41,760
was 35 years ago it was literally a

997
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:45,119
desert it was dry it was Bleak there was

998
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:46,859
nothing there I had to put so much out

999
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:49,020
there and so much out there taught

1000
00:40:46,859 --> 00:40:51,180
doctors taught people taught Health

1001
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:53,640
practitioners taught thousands of people

1002
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:55,560
lectured travel did it and got the

1003
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:57,660
information out there there's so much mm

1004
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:58,980
info that's out there now people don't

1005
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:00,660
even realize where it came from I've

1006
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:02,880
been doing this for over 35 years all

1007
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:05,099
right let's go into the like let's go

1008
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:07,740
into the like crazy place on this that's

1009
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:09,240
just unbelievable right

1010
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:12,000
okay

1011
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:14,520
so we're getting exposure yet okay here

1012
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,980
we are in recent years our brains have

1013
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:18,960
been learning to adapt to cell tower EMF

1014
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:23,220
because of radio frequencies we're

1015
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:25,859
exposed to from the military

1016
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:30,020
so in recent years our brains have been

1017
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:33,599
learning to adapt to cell tower EMF

1018
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:36,540
because of radio frequencies were

1019
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:39,599
exposed to from military

1020
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:42,119
military bases including classified

1021
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:44,820
military bases around the world send out

1022
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:47,460
radio frequencies that travel across the

1023
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:48,960
planet and away from our planet into the

1024
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:50,820
atmosphere this has been developing

1025
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,859
since the 1930s so our brains and

1026
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:54,660
neurons have been learning to adapt so

1027
00:41:52,859 --> 00:41:57,060
our brains and neurons have already

1028
00:41:54,660 --> 00:42:00,000
they've already been learning to adapt

1029
00:41:57,060 --> 00:42:02,040
to certain radio frequencies

1030
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,420
because they've had to because of the

1031
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:05,400
military radio frequencies that have

1032
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:06,780
been happening since the 1930s it's

1033
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:09,780
interesting

1034
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:11,700
get ready for this our present-day cell

1035
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:15,119
towers are more aggressive than

1036
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:17,040
old-school radio frequencies

1037
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:21,540
that also still exists by the way

1038
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:23,700
whether 5G now or 6x

1039
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:25,560
6x

1040
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:28,140
see what's happening is

1041
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:29,700
Spirit of compassion told me that where

1042
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:32,599
they're going to go after 5g's they're

1043
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:32,599
going to call it 6x

1044
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:40,520
SOC gave me that incredible information

1045
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:40,520
it's going to be named 6x

1046
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:48,200
and you know what x stands for right

1047
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:48,200
six

1048
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:53,700
so in the future but you know what

1049
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:55,619
they'll probably change it now because

1050
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:57,839
they're not going to want to like

1051
00:42:55,619 --> 00:42:59,280
make the prophecies come true in every

1052
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:00,660
angle right so they'll probably like oh

1053
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:04,020
better not let

1054
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:05,460
you know yeah so she get that prophecy

1055
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:08,579
so

1056
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:11,099
whether 5G now or 6X in the future

1057
00:43:08,579 --> 00:43:13,859
transmission technology continues to

1058
00:43:11,099 --> 00:43:16,440
send stronger signals still these towers

1059
00:43:13,859 --> 00:43:19,319
mere presence is not totally where the

1060
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:20,819
threat Lies when we're talking about EMF

1061
00:43:19,319 --> 00:43:22,200
exposure and the possibility of

1062
00:43:20,819 --> 00:43:23,700
compromising our brain health so what

1063
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:27,180
I'm saying is even with all that that's

1064
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:30,380
not where the main problems are

1065
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:30,380
[Music]

1066
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,980
okay

1067
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:38,460
still these towers mere presence is not

1068
00:43:36,839 --> 00:43:40,200
totally where the threat lies as I was

1069
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:42,900
saying again our brains are learning to

1070
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:44,339
adapt to cell tower waves moving through

1071
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:47,160
the environment

1072
00:43:44,339 --> 00:43:49,079
what we haven't adapted to is using a

1073
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:52,079
device that's connected to a cell tower

1074
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:54,599
we have not adapted to using a device

1075
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:56,460
connected to a cell tower when our cell

1076
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:58,079
phone is turned on and especially if

1077
00:43:56,460 --> 00:44:00,359
we're using the phone there's additional

1078
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:02,220
radio frequency coming to our phone and

1079
00:44:00,359 --> 00:44:04,440
that's additional radio frequency to

1080
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:08,400
which we have not adapted is why there

1081
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:10,140
is an EMF and and 5G shot right here on

1082
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,579
the table that's why you see the three

1083
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:14,160
ingredients that's why it's in the book

1084
00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:17,460
because there's some some things that we

1085
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:19,619
don't adapt to and that's when we need

1086
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:21,599
that EMF and 5G shot you guys should

1087
00:44:19,619 --> 00:44:24,000
tell people about these books let them

1088
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:25,859
know get the word out there about these

1089
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,900
two brain saver books

1090
00:44:25,859 --> 00:44:29,220
if you feel up to it

1091
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:30,900
because I know a lot of you guys don't

1092
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:32,940
feel good and you got enough on your

1093
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:36,300
plate I understand

1094
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:39,480
um when your cell phone is off my cell

1095
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:41,400
phone is on airplane right now but when

1096
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:43,579
your cell phone is off where you turn it

1097
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,579
off

1098
00:44:44,339 --> 00:44:47,520
do you guys find this interesting am I

1099
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:48,480
boring you guys I hope I'm not boring

1100
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,280
you guys

1101
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:52,260
am I boring you guys about all the cmf

1102
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:53,880
crap and all this 5G stuff

1103
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:55,319
because I feel bad if I'm boring you

1104
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:59,060
guys

1105
00:44:55,319 --> 00:44:59,060
hmm all right

1106
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:03,560
oh halftime intermission

1107
00:45:07,619 --> 00:45:34,460
who wants to the robot with me

1108
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:34,460
[Music]

1109
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:59,369
foreign

1110
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:59,369
[Music]

1111
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:05,300
that's fun

1112
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:05,300
Lanes up everything

1113
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:12,000
we're an EMF we're in the 5G exposure

1114
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:14,940
shot right here

1115
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,980
excited love the robot

1116
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:20,520
you guys doing the robot so okay let's

1117
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:23,339
go into slip when ourselves okay ready

1118
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:24,900
this is good what we haven't adapted to

1119
00:46:23,339 --> 00:46:27,599
is using a device that's connected to

1120
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:29,460
the cell tower when our cell phone is

1121
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:31,440
turned on

1122
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:33,599
and especially if we're using the phone

1123
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:36,000
there's additional radio frequency

1124
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:39,359
coming to our phone

1125
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,760
so you shut your phone off

1126
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:43,440
put your phone somewhere there's still

1127
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,520
radio frequencies coming from the cell

1128
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,260
tower

1129
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:48,420
and they're just going right through the

1130
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:50,160
house right through the apartment and

1131
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:52,380
they're hitting us okay

1132
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:54,980
they're hitting us

1133
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:54,980
so

1134
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:02,160
all right let's find our spot all right

1135
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:05,160
when your cell phone is off

1136
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:07,980
that pinpoint radio frequency EMF has

1137
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:10,200
dissipated pinpoint is what I'm talking

1138
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:13,079
about so here's how it works your cell

1139
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:16,260
phone's off you're not getting pinpoint

1140
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:19,140
radio frequencies coming from the cell

1141
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:23,099
tower when your cell phone's off you're

1142
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:25,920
getting General overall

1143
00:47:23,099 --> 00:47:28,800
radio frequency still beaming through

1144
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:30,240
the home you turn on your phone now it's

1145
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,920
pinpoint

1146
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:35,119
see the difference

1147
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:35,119
you're getting pinpoint

1148
00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:40,920
that pinpoint radio frequency is

1149
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:42,300
dissipated and now you're back to being

1150
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:44,400
surrounded by the radio frequency

1151
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:46,800
everyone is surrounded by unless you're

1152
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:49,140
totally Off the Grid living on the side

1153
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:51,240
of a mountain with no cell towers for

1154
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:52,380
many miles and then if you're living on

1155
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:54,000
the side of a mountain and there's no

1156
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:56,280
cell tower for many miles you're going

1157
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,319
to get very little of that cell tower

1158
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:01,140
frequency but you're never going to be

1159
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:03,119
able to use a phone or a device ever

1160
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:05,280
you guys I'm getting this incredible

1161
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:07,680
information from the brain saver books

1162
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:11,160
right here a lot of new people coming on

1163
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:13,440
and they're like what's a brain shot man

1164
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:16,079
hey this dude's kind of wacky what's a

1165
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:18,480
brain shot therapy

1166
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:19,619
what's the brain saver books should I

1167
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,960
get one

1168
00:48:19,619 --> 00:48:25,140
so there we go

1169
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:28,079
I just came back from a retreat man

1170
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:30,420
all I know is I went bat crazy

1171
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:33,000
after there for about five days and I

1172
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:35,040
had to run into the town and get

1173
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,560
and get some

1174
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:39,000
snacks at the gas station I felt so much

1175
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:41,240
better when I was standing in the gas

1176
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,240
station

1177
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:45,119
is that because there was power at the

1178
00:48:43,619 --> 00:48:46,740
gas station

1179
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:49,339
okay guys see these are the books right

1180
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:49,339
here check out

1181
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:56,520
all right let's keep on going here

1182
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:58,619
the pinpointed radio frequency that

1183
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:01,859
comes to a device when it's connected to

1184
00:48:58,619 --> 00:49:03,839
a cellular network is why when using a

1185
00:49:01,859 --> 00:49:05,520
cell phone it's important not to have it

1186
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:06,900
pressed up to your ear that's why you

1187
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:09,000
don't want it pressed up to your ear

1188
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:11,819
that's the whole point

1189
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:14,220
you can press it up to your ear if your

1190
00:49:11,819 --> 00:49:16,319
phone is off

1191
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:17,819
you can press your phone to your ear

1192
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:19,140
when your phone's on but that's a

1193
00:49:17,819 --> 00:49:20,400
different story like the radiation

1194
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:22,619
that's a different story and I talk

1195
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:25,140
about that in this book but here's the

1196
00:49:22,619 --> 00:49:26,640
thing when you're on a phone call you

1197
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:30,960
don't want to press the phone to your

1198
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:33,420
ear because it's pinpoint cell tower

1199
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:36,420
it's a pinpoint

1200
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:40,160
cell tower hit

1201
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:40,160
that's the difference right there

1202
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:46,619
if you have your phone off and you press

1203
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:48,240
it to your ear no big deal if you have

1204
00:49:46,619 --> 00:49:49,800
your cell phone on and you press it to

1205
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:51,359
your ear you get a little radiation I

1206
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,020
talk about in the books but here's the

1207
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:54,900
thing

1208
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:58,020
if you have your cell phone with a call

1209
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:59,760
you're getting a call hey Mac I want to

1210
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:02,579
talk to you and you put it to your ear

1211
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:04,800
now you're getting a direct pinpoint to

1212
00:50:02,579 --> 00:50:08,119
your brain coming from the cell tower

1213
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,119
that's the difference right there

1214
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:12,660
so you want to talk to somebody on

1215
00:50:11,339 --> 00:50:13,920
speakerphone and you want to have your

1216
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:16,859
phone away

1217
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:19,020
so that the pinpoint goes to your hand

1218
00:50:16,859 --> 00:50:20,339
so the pinpoint goes to your hand you

1219
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:22,500
see what I mean you guys we haven't even

1220
00:50:20,339 --> 00:50:24,900
done the EMF shot but I can't wait to do

1221
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:27,619
that EMF shot hopefully

1222
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:27,619
hopefully

1223
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:32,819
it tastes good because these shots

1224
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:35,099
they're about

1225
00:50:32,819 --> 00:50:38,900
results and some of them don't taste as

1226
00:50:35,099 --> 00:50:38,900
great because it's medicine

1227
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:43,740
you guys got to read the rest of the

1228
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:47,579
book I'm just I'm scratching the surface

1229
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:49,500
in here I didn't finish this section

1230
00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:51,000
but I want you to know you can read the

1231
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:52,140
rest of the book I didn't even finish

1232
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,359
the section

1233
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:57,300
and the books are just both books you

1234
00:50:54,359 --> 00:50:59,460
want to get because they're one book

1235
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:02,280
so make sure you get both books and sale

1236
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:05,300
on amazon.com 40 off right now

1237
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:05,300
um us all right let's go

1238
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:09,839
so we're in the brain shot therapy you

1239
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:11,640
guys we're doing entry level brain shot

1240
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:13,740
therapy cleanse we're doing 10 days this

1241
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:15,420
is day four this is the entry level

1242
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:17,400
brain shot therapy cleanse make sure

1243
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:20,040
you're drinking 50 ounces of water

1244
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:22,079
through the course of the day don't

1245
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:24,059
drink the 50 ounces right when you send

1246
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:26,400
down your brain shot so when you send

1247
00:51:24,059 --> 00:51:27,960
down your brain shot don't drink the 50

1248
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,819
ounces

1249
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:33,440
um right then too at the same time so

1250
00:51:29,819 --> 00:51:33,440
don't don't do that right

1251
00:51:35,099 --> 00:51:39,839
it's like don't wash it down with water

1252
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:41,880
you do your 50 ounces throughout the day

1253
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:43,740
the minimum minimum 50 ounces of water

1254
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:46,980
throughout the day this is your entry

1255
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:48,900
level brain shot therapy cleanse

1256
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:50,700
for this challenge though we're doing

1257
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:53,099
one to three shots you can choose to do

1258
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:55,440
one shot a day I'm doing three shots a

1259
00:51:53,099 --> 00:51:59,460
day I did three obsessive thoughts

1260
00:51:55,440 --> 00:52:03,599
shifters yesterday I'm doing three EMF

1261
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:05,940
and 5G exposure shots today

1262
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:07,859
use the same shot that would be amazing

1263
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:11,760
so it would be EMF

1264
00:52:07,859 --> 00:52:14,099
in 5G brain shot therapy three times use

1265
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:16,760
the same one

1266
00:52:14,099 --> 00:52:16,760
incredible

1267
00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:21,480
all right

1268
00:52:20,099 --> 00:52:23,940
let's talk about this for a little bit

1269
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:27,420
you can choose 10 days 20 days 30 days

1270
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:29,280
in the entry level cleanse I am doing a

1271
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:30,839
10-day brain shot therapy cleanse

1272
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,880
challenge with you guys it's 10 days

1273
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:37,079
we're day four okay

1274
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:37,079
we're moving along amazing

1275
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:44,180
so much incredible information okay

1276
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:50,640
these cleanses are imperative to what

1277
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:53,160
we're up against today EMF and 5G is an

1278
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:55,440
example right there these are important

1279
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:57,359
the brain shot therapy cleanses go just

1280
00:52:55,440 --> 00:53:00,000
beyond the physical they hit the

1281
00:52:57,359 --> 00:53:02,640
metaphysical that's the whole point it's

1282
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,380
doing both this is allowing us to

1283
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:05,940
achieve enlightenment when we're getting

1284
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:08,339
rid of the stuff that shouldn't be in

1285
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:10,980
our brain we're protecting our brain and

1286
00:53:08,339 --> 00:53:13,680
we're healing our soul that's how we

1287
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:16,140
achieve enlightenment that's one of the

1288
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:18,599
biggest ways of doing it is huge right

1289
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:21,180
removing poisons from our brain opens up

1290
00:53:18,599 --> 00:53:22,559
that door which is really incredible now

1291
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:24,000
here's the other thing that happens with

1292
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:25,380
the medical medium brain shot therapies

1293
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,420
and you guys are going to see this your

1294
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:30,180
intuitive skills are Clairvoyant skills

1295
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:33,480
your telepathic skills

1296
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:35,760
your skills as being a Seer start to

1297
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:38,280
develop so if they're in there in you

1298
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:39,900
they start to get enhanced I'm letting

1299
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:42,359
you know so if you're as you're doing

1300
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:44,460
the brain shot therapy cleanses like

1301
00:53:42,359 --> 00:53:46,559
we're doing this 10 day one that

1302
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:48,480
Clairvoyant power that skill that

1303
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:51,240
telepathic psychic intuitive skill

1304
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:52,440
starts to build on itself as well now

1305
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:54,480
here's the whole thing with the brain

1306
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:57,780
shots they build on themselves as well

1307
00:53:54,480 --> 00:54:00,119
too not just your abilities of brain

1308
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:03,319
healing but everything

1309
00:54:00,119 --> 00:54:03,319
which is really incredible

1310
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:09,960
so we're in the exposure shots EMF and

1311
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:11,880
5G is an exposure shot and we are in the

1312
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:13,440
exposure shots right now important to

1313
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:15,720
know these brain shots can be

1314
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:18,660
administered before an exposure during

1315
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:21,059
during an exposure shortly after an

1316
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:23,940
exposure or even days weeks or months

1317
00:54:21,059 --> 00:54:27,540
after an exposure

1318
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:29,460
now I'm around a lot of different EMF

1319
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:31,200
I'm around computers around all kinds of

1320
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:32,520
stuff so I'm going to do this once in a

1321
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:34,980
while for me but there's a lot of brain

1322
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:38,040
shots that I like to do but I love this

1323
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:39,900
one so many details in the books so that

1324
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:41,880
you can read all the details and get the

1325
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:43,559
information you need but it's in here

1326
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:45,960
about all of this

1327
00:54:43,559 --> 00:54:47,579
okay

1328
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:50,540
let's see what we got maybe we're gonna

1329
00:54:47,579 --> 00:54:50,540
go and make this shot

1330
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:56,700
and we are going to do that all right

1331
00:54:55,319 --> 00:55:00,740
you guys

1332
00:54:56,700 --> 00:55:00,740
EMF 5G exposure shot

1333
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:06,559
let's go

1334
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:06,559
let's get the juicer out

1335
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:11,940
as I was saying before I feel bad for

1336
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:13,800
people who've been tricked into juicers

1337
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:17,099
that aren't going to save them money

1338
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:19,559
and I do feel bad I can't the problem is

1339
00:55:17,099 --> 00:55:23,040
I can't keep up with everything telling

1340
00:55:19,559 --> 00:55:24,900
everybody like what they can do

1341
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:27,960
or I'll just be literally talking about

1342
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:29,700
the juicer every day and as much as I

1343
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:31,020
want to like get that information out

1344
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:33,599
there it's really hard and I feel bad

1345
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:36,420
this has a compression this isn't metal

1346
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:38,160
grinding touching each other this has a

1347
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:40,260
compression literally that saves you

1348
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:42,000
money so that you get more juice and

1349
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:44,460
when it comes down to any juicing you do

1350
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,380
it's critical that you get that juice

1351
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:49,680
out that's the whole point and that's

1352
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:51,839
what the mm-1500 900s do 20 off right

1353
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:55,079
now I'm letting you know because I feel

1354
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:56,400
bad I see what's happening and so the

1355
00:55:55,079 --> 00:55:59,099
sharks have come into the communities

1356
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:01,079
they're selling them bum juicers in my

1357
00:55:59,099 --> 00:56:04,200
opinion that aren't squeezing the juice

1358
00:56:01,079 --> 00:56:06,059
out and I feel bad for everybody so just

1359
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:09,300
letting you guys know Pamela says yeah

1360
00:56:06,059 --> 00:56:11,760
but watch the shark buy the mm-1500 but

1361
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:13,500
sell the shark Brands I'm sure they

1362
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:16,200
already have I'm sure the sharks are

1363
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:17,579
using the mm-1500 to save that money and

1364
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:19,500
at the same time they're selling the

1365
00:56:17,579 --> 00:56:21,359
crappy Brands so I'm just letting you

1366
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:22,619
guys know spread the word and if someone

1367
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:24,720
said well I've been tricked by the

1368
00:56:22,619 --> 00:56:26,099
Sharks and I got the wrong one say well

1369
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,359
down the road when you get the right one

1370
00:56:26,099 --> 00:56:28,680
think about how much money you're going

1371
00:56:27,359 --> 00:56:30,839
to save and you're going to pay for both

1372
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:32,099
the bum juicer that you got and you're

1373
00:56:30,839 --> 00:56:33,480
going to pay for the good juicer that

1374
00:56:32,099 --> 00:56:35,760
you got

1375
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:37,380
all right here we go we're making this

1376
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,880
this is an interesting one right here

1377
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:41,339
we're going to do with parsley to start

1378
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:43,079
with quarter cup of tightly packed

1379
00:56:41,339 --> 00:56:44,460
parsley

1380
00:56:43,079 --> 00:56:46,380
stirring this on

1381
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:48,599
it's a quiet juicer by the way you guys

1382
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:50,940
it's incredible quarter cup of tightly

1383
00:56:48,599 --> 00:56:53,339
packed parsley

1384
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:55,859
so I'm packing it in my hand because I

1385
00:56:53,339 --> 00:56:59,660
kind of all these years I know what like

1386
00:56:55,859 --> 00:56:59,660
what that is and what that equals

1387
00:56:59,819 --> 00:57:05,000
there we go put a little parsley in

1388
00:57:02,819 --> 00:57:05,000
there

1389
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:13,460
so we're putting a little bit of parsley

1390
00:57:14,359 --> 00:57:17,660
here we go

1391
00:57:17,819 --> 00:57:21,839
now we're peeling a raw potato

1392
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:23,940
[Applause]

1393
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:27,059
I'm gonna grab a potato out of my potato

1394
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:29,520
bin here that's a nice potato very happy

1395
00:57:27,059 --> 00:57:32,280
you want a half a cup potato I'm gonna

1396
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:34,680
do a quick peeling right now because I

1397
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:37,859
did not peel it ahead of time

1398
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:40,380
and you can Cube it you can kind of chop

1399
00:57:37,859 --> 00:57:42,839
it up in one inch half inch cubes

1400
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:45,180
whatever and that's what we're gonna do

1401
00:57:42,839 --> 00:57:47,880
so I'm peeling this potato back

1402
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:49,920
getting the skin off

1403
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:52,020
because that was the direction from

1404
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:54,240
Spirit of compassion

1405
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:57,119
there we go

1406
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:59,300
all right I'm cutting up my potato as we

1407
00:57:57,119 --> 00:57:59,300
speak

1408
00:58:00,599 --> 00:58:04,980
this is not a juice this is a medicinal

1409
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:09,480
shot

1410
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:13,160
brain shot therapy isn't juicing it's

1411
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:13,160
creating medicinal shots

1412
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:17,540
putting a half a cup of the potato down

1413
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:17,540
in here

1414
00:58:20,819 --> 00:58:24,599
and then we're going to get a celery

1415
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:26,700
stick one stalk of celery stick to two

1416
00:58:24,599 --> 00:58:29,040
stalks the reason why it's one to two is

1417
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:31,800
someone might have a really small celery

1418
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:34,700
stick which happens

1419
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:34,700
it's really small

1420
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:46,579
here we go

1421
00:58:43,619 --> 00:58:46,579
amazing

1422
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:52,620
[Music]

1423
00:58:49,740 --> 00:59:10,500

there it is

1430
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:38,880
so much of us are surrounded by

1431
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:40,799
exposures we just don't understand

1432
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:42,059
it's rid of compassion has taught us a

1433
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:44,160
lot

1434
00:59:42,059 --> 00:59:46,619
in these brain saver books you'll get

1435
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:49,140
information you've never heard before so

1436
00:59:46,619 --> 00:59:52,020

1437
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:54,540

1464
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:19,079
that grounding but when you put that

1465
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:21,059
grounding nature of the potato Spirit of

1466
01:01:19,079 --> 01:01:22,740
compassion says and you mix it and no

1467
01:01:21,059 --> 01:01:25,619
one would ever know this and you mix

1468
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:28,319
that grounding nature of that potato and

1469
01:01:25,619 --> 01:01:30,660
you mix it with the trace mineral salts

1470
01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:33,839
in the celery so you have the trace

1471
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:36,900
minerals with the grounding nature right

1472
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:38,460
and the rich rich nutrients of the

1473
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:40,799

1474
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:44,819

get about 12 ounces from a whole bunch

1516
01:03:17,579 --> 01:03:24,299
but now with the 1500 I generally I get

1517
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:25,799
really close to 16 ounces and sometimes

1518
01:03:24,299 --> 01:03:27,900
more you guys the difference is

1519
01:03:25,799 --> 01:03:29,400
unbelievable with those other juicers

1520
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:33,059
that that are broken into the community

1521
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:35,940
the Sharks ripping everybody off

1522
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:39,180
you're getting less juice cost of

1523
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:42,119
produce is up the cost of food is up the

1524
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:44,160
mm 1500 pays for itself and you know

1525
01:03:42,119 --> 01:03:45,839
what it's not about a juicer it's about

1526
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:47,339
all the good stuff and everything else

1527
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:48,900
but I have to talk about the juicer

1528
01:03:47,339 --> 01:03:50,579
because of what the sharks have done I

1529
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:52,260
thought everybody knew what juicers that

1530
01:03:50,579 --> 01:03:54,480
were the best I've been talking about

1531
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:56,160
them for a few years now but I hope

1532
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:57,420
people know and spread the word that

1533
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:59,339
