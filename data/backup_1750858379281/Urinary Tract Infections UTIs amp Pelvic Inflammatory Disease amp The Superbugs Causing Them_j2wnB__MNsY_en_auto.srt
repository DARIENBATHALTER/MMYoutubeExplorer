1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:08,480
UTI PID all kinds of different

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:10,759
conditions urinary tract infections are

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:14,679
on the rise up up up up they're not

4
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:17,680
going down down down UTI are going up up

5
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:20,680
and away the problem is with UTI they're

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:24,760
not just going up they're going

7
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:27,000
chronically crazy where women are

8
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:29,439
suffering

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,559
incredible suffering we're talking about

10
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,360
devast dating suffering because of UTI

11
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:36,800
chronic UTI that don't want to go

12
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:40,399
anywhere because guess what the bacteria

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,320
became super bacteria it is now a super

14
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,640
bug that's what's happening so so many

15
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,920
people are dealing dealing with chronic

16
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,480
UTI they can't get past them they can't

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,039
move forward it's just tormenting them

18
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:56,600
and it doesn't go away same thing with

19
00:00:53,039 --> 00:01:00,199
pelvic inflammatory disease that too

20
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:02,160
just keeps on tormenting women in such

21
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:04,720
ways that is

22
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,240
undescribable because words don't match

23
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,240
the suffering they are suffering with so

24
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:12,040
we're going into that UTI bladder

25
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:15,759
infections kidney infections right

26
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:19,759
urinary tract infections yeast

27
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:23,560
infections yeast infections

28
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:25,079
interesting yeast yeast yeast so funny

29
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,840
thing about well it's nothing funny

30
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:30,240
about it but the funny thing about yeast

31
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:33,119
infections is it's not the yeast is not

32
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,960
the real problem it is

33
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,560
bacteria that's Underneath It All the

34
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,960
yeast just the immune system is so

35
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,920
challenged in that area that the the

36
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,880
yeast just grows because it's growing

37
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:48,399
because there's so much of an immune

38
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:50,520
suppressive um situation happening in

39
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,640
the bladder area the vaginal area all of

40
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,320
that that the yeast just tends to

41
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,960
explode but it's exploding because the

42
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,799
bacteria is thriving and taking over

43
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,840
we're talking about rep we're talking

44
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,880
about bacteria we're talking about super

45
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,759
bugs a little bit we're going into that

46
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,479
and we're talking about UTI we're going

47
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:10,959
to talk about solutions for UTI as well

48
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,200
so that's going to be really helpful for

49
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,360
a lot of people that are dealing with

50
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,560
UTI you don't want to miss this episode

51
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,239
this is an important one I'm even

52
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,640
reading a little bit out of Liver Rescue

53
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,440
a little bit out of cleanse the heel

54
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,920
don't miss this do you know anybody

55
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,480
struggling or suffering with UTI or have

56
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,440
a history of UTI and now they have acne

57
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,760
now they got sibo here's later they get

58
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:35,720
sibo now they get PID now they got acne

59
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,040
again then they got an ear infection

60
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,159
then they got a sore throat and a strep

61
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,040
throat

62
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:45,760
problem yeah exactly strep strep strep

63
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:48,000
strep strep strep strep exactly sio they

64
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,560
never talk about what bacteria it is

65
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,280
that creates small intestinal bacterial

66
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:57,840
overgrowth but it's STP our good old

67
00:02:54,280 --> 00:03:00,200
friend strep hey strep how are you fine

68
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,959
doing okay living in everybody body's

69
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:06,239
lymphatic vessels living in everybody's

70
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:09,680
pores living in everybody's throats

71
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:13,080
living in everybody's buts yep you got

72
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,879
it that's what happens strep is always

73
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:18,560
hanging around people's anuses it's

74
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:20,599
hanging around the rectums all the time

75
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,000
that's where strep loves to be it's

76
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:25,920
around everybody's throat it's in their

77
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,720
mouth every day people have more than

78
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,480
one variety two variety have three

79
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,439
variety four variety five variety six

80
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:34,599
variety seven variety they'll have 10

81
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:38,560
varieties of strep some dormant some

82
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:40,400
lowkey some much more serious creating

83
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:45,200
everything from acne to

84
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:47,959
sty yep sty thrush all that thrush on

85
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,159
their tongue just causing problems so

86
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:51,959
that's the whole thing there we're going

87
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:54,480
into strep and we're going into UTI but

88
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:57,560
let's hit the UTI problem because that

89
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:01,319
is critical because I'm seeing it more

90
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:04,480
and more years ago I didn't see it like

91
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:07,840
it was today you'd have that antibiotic

92
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:12,159
resistant UTI you'd have that out there

93
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:16,160
I saw it out there okay but now it's

94
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:18,959
unlike it's ever been it's never been to

95
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,120
this degree I called it though and I saw

96
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,400
it I've written about it that these bugs

97
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,120
would actually take off to such a degree

98
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:30,400
where they'd be antibiotic resistant but

99
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:34,560
not just Mera not talking about Mera

100
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:36,800
I'm talking about plain old Jane strep

101
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,240
not MCA this is important to know this

102
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,639
is a really good episode and we're going

103
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,320
to talk about Solutions too which are

104
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:46,880
critical um let's get into it a little

105
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:49,120
bit the antibiotic dilemma do you guys

106
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:53,080
uh love antibiotics antibiotics are the

107
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:56,320
leading treatment for

108
00:04:53,080 --> 00:05:00,919
UTI antibiotics are the leading

109
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:05,400
treatments for UTI you know that means

110
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:07,520
that means decade after decade of bugs

111
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:10,520
that are actually becoming

112
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:13,280
immune to the

113
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:16,560
antibiotic it's how it works and then

114
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:19,479
that bug spreads to another person and

115
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,639
so that person receives that bug and

116
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:26,600
then now they have an antibiotic

117
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:28,800
resistant bug they get sick and then

118
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:33,039
they go to the doctor the doctor gives

119
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:36,560
them an anti biotic again and now their

120
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:39,800
bug is in them that's already antibiotic

121
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,160
resistant is now even becoming more

122
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,319
antibiotic

123
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:46,199
resistant and

124
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:48,840
the and then it keeps on going on and on

125
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:51,639
and on and on so that's what's

126
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:54,680
happening it's not like the old

127
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:58,520
days and then the antibiotic kills the

128
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:01,560
weakest bacteria but the Strong Survive

129
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:05,080
so let's do this

130
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:10,039
okay I was prepared for this one here we

131
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:12,720
go okay you got a bacterium right here

132
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:14,759
you got a bacterium right here got a

133
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,280
bacterium right here and a bacterium

134
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:18,000
right here and I'll even put another one

135
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:22,120
right here and one more right here so

136
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,560
these are bacteria okay so here we are

137
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:28,000
take a look you guys these are inside

138
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:30,400
the bladder or the kidneys so let's make

139
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,039
a bladder here

140
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:36,840
okay there we are we got a

141
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:39,360
bladder right and in that bladder is a

142
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:41,639
whole bunch of bacteria and strep

143
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,720
bacteria is what it is okay so

144
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:47,919
antibiotics are used all of a sudden

145
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,280
boom we take an antibiotic the

146
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:53,880
antibiotic is coming through right now

147
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:56,280
here it goes there it is the antibiotic

148
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,280
coming

149
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,400
through there we go

150
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:06,680
can't really see this good but there it

151
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:09,680
is Boom the antibiotic came through then

152
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:12,840
now we get some dead

153
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,639
bacteria this one explodes Boom the

154
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:18,560
antibiotic killed

155
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,680
it boom Another One explodes boom

156
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,479
Another One

157
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:27,120
explodes interesting this one just gets

158
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:28,520
maed that bacterium gets maimed this one

159
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,599
just gets

160
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:35,000
weakened am I yelling this one gets

161
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,280
weakened okay this one doesn't get

162
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,080
harmed at

163
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:44,879
all all right we got a weakened

164
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:49,120
bacterium we got a maed bacterium

165
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:51,919
damaged but they survive they survive

166
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,759
and they provide information now against

167
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:57,720
that

168
00:07:52,759 --> 00:08:00,479
antibiotic they hold the key to survival

169
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:03,479
against the antibiotic that was given to

170
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:06,919
them think about that right now right

171
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:09,560
and then you got one that survived it

172
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:13,280
completely that also holds information

173
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:15,400
but it's completely unharmed in fact it

174
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:19,319
seemed to do good with the antibiotic

175
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:20,560
that one little bug right there drank

176
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:23,879
those

177
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:27,360
antibiotics consumed them it didn't hurt

178
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:30,240
them and now this one bug right here is

179
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,800
getting stronger

180
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,680
nice and strong now now it's a nice

181
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:38,200
strong bacterium you see this the maed

182
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,880
ones not as strong but they provide

183
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:44,039
information and they stay alive is what

184
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:46,640
they do they too survive it and they're

185
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:49,560
a they survive it and the aftermath

186
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:52,279
they're still hanging around okay and

187
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:54,560
then another one too at the same time

188
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:57,720
still survived it and it's it's there

189
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:01,240
right so now you got three bacterium but

190
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:04,959
three different bacter iums same

191
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:07,720
bacteria but three different experiences

192
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:09,120
three different strengths and three

193
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:13,440
different

194
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:15,600
injuries one not injured two one mimed

195
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:19,360
one injured there's a problem with that

196
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:22,120
though because then as it's producing

197
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:25,000
more bacteria is being produced okay

198
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:27,240
which happens more and more

199
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,440
bacteria is being

200
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,320
produced right here's your bacteria

201
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,000
right

202
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:36,000
here and these bacteria are getting

203
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,920
stronger and producing the weak

204
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:43,440
ones okay want to be as strong as the

205
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:46,320
strong one so the weak ones become even

206
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,240
stronger than the original strong one

207
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,279
that wasn't even affected by the

208
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,560
original back antibiotic okay this is

209
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:56,360
important the weaker

210
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:59,000
ones gain strength the ones that were

211
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:01,399
maimed and injured by the an antibiotic

212
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,959
keep that in mind they were maimed and

213
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:08,720
injured and they

214
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:12,000
now okay they strengthen they rise above

215
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:14,839
it they gather information from their

216
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,200
injuries they learn how to not get

217
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:20,519
injured again by the antibiotic they

218
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:23,560
become stronger than the one that

219
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:27,000
survived completely without injury at

220
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:30,839
all and that's a problem all on its own

221
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,600
okay so now you have very strong

222
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:37,200
bacteria here's the thing they get

223
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:40,120
stronger they get stronger and

224
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:46,240
then all

225
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:49,600
right and then a new infection

226
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:52,440
occurs they get stronger they override

227
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:55,200
the immune system of the person drops

228
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:57,560
exactly the immune system

229
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:01,600
drops there's another bladder right

230
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:04,600
there okay so white blood

231
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,959
cells for some reason aren't as strong

232
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,880
in that person their own white blood

233
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:13,200
cells aren't doing the jobs they need to

234
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:16,040
do they get triggered they get exposures

235
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:20,399
something happens there and then the

236
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:23,000
bacteria rise up and get stronger and

237
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,160
now we have a new infection they

238
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,880
reproduce I'm going to make a whole

239
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:29,920
bunch of them here if you guys with me

240
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:32,639
you're following me right now

241
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:35,399
okay and then the new antibiotic comes

242
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:38,200
through they're sick again and then a

243
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:40,600
new wave of antibiotic comes through

244
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,800
they're at the doctor's office they got

245
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,959
a new

246
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:46,959
UTI and then boom here comes the

247
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:49,959
antibiotic it's rushing

248
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,959
through

249
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:56,920
okay and what happens is all these new

250
00:11:54,959 --> 00:12:01,360
bacteria

251
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:04,920
right they don't budge everybody's happy

252
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:07,240
they're stronger they supersede the

253
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:09,760
antibiotic and then the doctor gets

254
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:13,040
pissed the patients gets the patient

255
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:15,160
gets pissed stays sick the doctor's

256
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:18,800
pissed and then they change up the

257
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:22,760
antibiotic get ready for this the new

258
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:25,560
antibiotic gets then prescribed so here

259
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:28,199
comes the new antibiotic coming through

260
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:30,160
and this is what sucks right here really

261
00:12:28,199 --> 00:12:34,839
sucks it's comes

262
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:37,560
through and then it mimes and injures a

263
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:40,199
whole bunch of them that's right this

264
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:43,079
one gets maed this one gets injured this

265
00:12:40,199 --> 00:12:46,639
one gets maed this one gets injured this

266
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:49,279
one gets almost killed completely this

267
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:52,760
one just gets slightly injured this one

268
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:56,079
never gets touched okay that's

269
00:12:52,760 --> 00:13:00,279
fine here's the problem now we got a

270
00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:02,680
whole bunch of brand new streps

271
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:04,959
and those brand new bacterium strep

272
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:08,920
bacterium have

273
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:11,920
information and survived a new

274
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:13,720
antibiotic that is not good they

275
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:17,079
survived a new

276
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:18,760
antibiotic they're still alive now they

277
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:21,399
have information from the original

278
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:23,760
antibiotic how to survive survival

279
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:26,880
instincts in the bacteria and now they

280
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:29,880
got new information from the new

281
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:32,720
antibiotic survival mechanis organisms

282
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:35,760
kick in in that bacteria the

283
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,880
bacteria does not want to lose so it's

284
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:40,959
going to now

285
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:44,480
supersede and then boom the next phase

286
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:46,320
happens okay you got a patient that's

287
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,399
getting a little better again the

288
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:52,680
patient's getting a little bit

289
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,680
better I really can't stand this

290
00:13:53,600 --> 00:14:01,480
whiteboard

291
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:01,480
yep all right new bacteria it's

292
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:08,839
reproducing here we

293
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:11,800
go once again immune system drops in the

294
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:16,440
patient the patient was getting

295
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:19,000
better a month later two months later at

296
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,600
some point okay there's the bladder

297
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,360
again I'm just doing a bladder you do

298
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,560
kidneys you can do you know urethras

299
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,279
whatever

300
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:30,199
so all

301
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:32,040
right playing around mark ERS here so we

302
00:14:30,199 --> 00:14:35,320
got a new

303
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:36,639
bacteria this bacteria has information

304
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:39,160
from two

305
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:42,639
antibiotics it has survived two

306
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:45,440
antibiotics yes it has indeed and it has

307
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:47,560
survived the person's immune

308
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,880
system that's the whole point it

309
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:51,759
survived their immune system and it

310
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:54,199
survived the antibiotic involved in

311
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:57,120
their immune system okay both with the

312
00:14:54,199 --> 00:14:59,160
immune system working on that working

313
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,839
with that antibiotic and both with with

314
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:03,639
that antibiotic okay so get ready for

315
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:07,079
this person gets sick again they got

316
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:09,199
another eiti it's pretty darn serious

317
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:11,279
they're in pain they got a fever they

318
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,160
don't know if they got kidney infections

319
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:16,279
bladder

320
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:19,279
infections and here we go there might be

321
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:22,399
some blood in the urine

322
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:25,920
right goes to the doctor doctor

323
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:27,959
prescribes an antibiotic the same one

324
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,240
that they used last time so you fill

325
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:32,120
your prescription now you're taking it

326
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,319
antibiotic runs through the body it's

327
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,680
triggering the immune system immune

328
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:38,000
cells you're trying to work with it it's

329
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,160
trying to work with everything it's

330
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,279
going

331
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:43,360
through okay and this time now with this

332
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:46,000
new

333
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,959
antibiotic it's only killing off this

334
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,399
one only killing off that one only

335
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:53,639
killing off that one that one that one

336
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,240
that one but this one right here is just

337
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:57,279
injured that one's injured that one's

338
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,800
injured that's one's injured injured

339
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:02,600
maimed and we get the whole thing over

340
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:05,199
again all the maed and injured ones say

341
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:07,959
I'm not going to do this anymore I'm not

342
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:11,240
going to let this antibiotic this new

343
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:13,880
antibiotic rule the roost and clean us

344
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,040
out we have to Rise Above This and we

345
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,920
have to get

346
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:21,079
stronger and then what happens is the

347
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:25,800
new reproduction of that of that

348
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:28,319
bacterium is even stronger so that the

349
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:30,839
next phase of the antibiotic on the

350
00:16:28,319 --> 00:16:32,240
fourth r which happens all the time and

351
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:34,839
sometimes it's a sixth round and

352
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:38,079
sometimes it's a seventh another one's

353
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:41,319
prescribed here we

354
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:44,880
go and now none of the bacteria are

355
00:16:41,319 --> 00:16:45,920
budging at all got a fever there's blood

356
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,040
in the

357
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:51,160
urine kidneys are inflamed they have to

358
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:54,160
give steroids out now so now it's

359
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:55,920
steroids plus the new antibiotic so here

360
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,839
we go doctor's got to play the game

361
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:01,560
again and here it

362
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:04,880
comes all right now it's

363
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,880
time to

364
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:10,880
use now it's time to use the new

365
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:13,240
antibiotic all right so we got this

366
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,640
bacteria that bacteria that bacteria

367
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:18,000
that one right there that one right

368
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,000
there here we go here's all the

369
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,919
bacteria yep we got another bladder

370
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:25,039
we'll just do bladder here we go there's

371
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:29,440
the

372
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:32,679
bladder now the doctor has to bring in

373
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:35,240
the super antibiotic one with a lot of

374
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:37,240
side effects one that causes a lot of

375
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:40,400
problems one that also says a lot of

376
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:43,520
terrible thing things on the side effect

377
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,840
package the little roll out and here we

378
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:52,600
go here it

379
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:52,600
comes boom boom boom bo bo I'm taking my

380
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:59,640
antibiotic

381
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:03,480
right the super antibiotic

382
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:05,360
the Super One a change

383
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:10,280
up

384
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:13,000
okay injures this guy kills off this guy

385
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:15,480
mimes this guy injures this guy kills

386
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,960
off this guy doesn't even touch that guy

387
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:21,880
that guy and that guy now you got three

388
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,280
guys here not even being touched by the

389
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:26,080
super

390
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,760
antibiotic but you still got injured but

391
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:31,200
not dead

392
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:34,159
bacteria injured but not dead bacteria

393
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,720
you got some dead

394
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:38,840
bacteria but too many

395
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:42,640
injured too many

396
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:46,000
injured and too many maimed but still

397
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:48,280
survived and others that didn't even get

398
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,120
affected and then we got a big problem

399
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:54,960
so now they reproduce

400
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:59,240
again after the Super antibiotic went

401
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:03,200
through they reproduce this time we're

402
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:06,120
in trouble now big trouble here we are

403
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,760
because they use the super antibiotic

404
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:12,159
again and then they have that running

405
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:15,080
through and now these

406
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:18,640
bacteria they are messaging they Cod it

407
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:22,600
they have information they're

408
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:25,919
superpowered they do not not give up at

409
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:27,720
this point they have information of four

410
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,520
to five different

411
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:33,200
antibiotics

412
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:35,720
and they don't want to budge anymore

413
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,320
they put their foot down they're done

414
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:41,120
that means they don't budge so then the

415
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:43,840
doctor has to run another

416
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:47,280
antibiotic brings that one

417
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:50,440
through and now the patient is just

418
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:53,720
chronically sick chronically suffering

419
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:56,000
and chronically sick a super buug has

420
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,000
been

421
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:05,320
born the patient has the

422
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:08,919
superbug whether it's a male

423
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:11,960
female the patient has a superbug and

424
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:15,159
then the patient has a

425
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:17,679
relationship or the patient is a chef

426
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:19,880
working in a restaurant who cuts their

427
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,240
finger and then bleeds on three

428
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,760
different meals that you can't really

429
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,240
tell because a lot of the chefs they we

430
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:26,720
the black gloves they put the black

431
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,039
gloves on they throw a bandage on put a

432
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,799
black glove on there's still blood

433
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:33,080
everywhere and get working really quick

434
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:35,799
they wipe their hands and or it's a

435
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:38,480
relationship sexual interactions of some

436
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:40,799
kind and then that super bug now gets

437
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,240
transferred onto someone else with all

438
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:45,840
this information and all this messaging

439
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:48,440
and that information or the shopping

440
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,400
cart shopping cart's a big one I've been

441
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:54,520
saying this for decades you guys heard

442
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:57,880
me say it years ago before c came around

443
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:59,799
the shopping cart is a big one okay lots

444
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:02,440
of different back bacteria on there lots

445
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:04,720
of strep lots of Staff lots of Cs L lots

446
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:07,600
of Mera lots of other stuff too but the

447
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:10,360
strep is just crazy on the shopping cart

448
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:13,720
handles crazy that's how much is on

449
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:15,600
there okay so with that if they swabbed

450
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:18,360
if they did a swab in a p tree dish if

451
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,320
they did that with off the shopping cart

452
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:23,960
handles you wouldn't believe what would

453
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:25,039
grow wouldn't believe it so you're

454
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,559
sitting there with a shopping cart

455
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:28,200
handle you're not using handy wipes

456
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,520
you're not doing an alcohol handy wipe

457
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,600
across the handle you're you don't

458
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,279
you're you're not thinking about

459
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,400
anything you don't care about anything

460
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:35,600
maybe you're just somebody that thinks

461
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,159
that your immune system will get

462
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,279
stronger because of it you won't have to

463
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:41,320
worry because hey who cares I can just

464
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:43,120
eat bugs and have bugs all over my skin

465
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:45,200
it's just all that whole thing that

466
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:48,200
philosophy that philosophy right it

467
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,480
makes you stronger you become immune to

468
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,440
it or something like that that's not

469
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:53,360
true that's not how it works the more

470
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,360
exposure you get to these bugs the more

471
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,840
exposure you get the more bugs you get

472
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:00,000
the more problems you have and then that

473
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,600
it doesn't work that way where we're

474
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,960
just all of a sudden hey I'm immune to

475
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,799
everything and that's what I want all

476
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,880
these bugs no it does not work like that

477
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:10,520
tell that to someone who got you know

478
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:12,039
Herpes Simplex 2 tell that to someone

479
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:14,279
who's got something else that they

480
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:16,440
caught from somebody it doesn't make you

481
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:18,919
stronger it's not how it works it's a

482
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:22,279
hassle it's all a hassle so then that

483
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:24,480
strep then that super bug gets into

484
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:27,640
somebody else through a shopping cart H

485
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:30,760
handle through a public bathroom off the

486
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:34,039
toilet seat off the dispenser whatever

487
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:37,640
it is and they get it and they get the

488
00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:40,520
bug that's superpowered it is a super

489
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:41,240
version of itself it already knows all

490
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,360
the

491
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:45,400
antibiotics it already knows about them

492
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,799
all that means when you come down with

493
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:50,200
something or you get sick or something

494
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:53,000
happens and now you got a UTI whatever

495
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:55,159
it may be you go to the doctor and the

496
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,600
process starts all over again but the

497
00:22:55,159 --> 00:22:59,080
doctor starts giving you that first

498
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:01,120
round of antibiotics and it won't budge

499
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,440
so easy especially if you have a

500
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,880
compromised immune system and you're

501
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,039
already struggling with something it

502
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:07,320
won't

503
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:09,640
budge and they're just like why do you

504
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:12,360
have these UTI all of a sudden or say

505
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:14,159
you know someone has someone has sex

506
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:17,000
with somebody else and you know it's

507
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:20,400
unprotective even if it's even if it's

508
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,760
protected sex it's still easy to

509
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,120
transfer these like these um these

510
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:26,720
streps and this bacteria and all a

511
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,960
sudden now there's a new UTI somebody

512
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,559
has that never had before

513
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,960
and now but it's an anti-resistant it's

514
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:37,000
a what is it antibiotic resistant is

515
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:39,200
what I mean version of itself that has

516
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,320
all this information that's coded that's

517
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:45,360
got all this Intel that survived all

518
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:47,679
these antibiotics that knows them well

519
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:50,600
so now we have another person with a

520
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:53,120
super bug and just as Grim as it sounds

521
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:54,720
it's not Grim when you know how to heal

522
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,240
and use tools and that's the thing about

523
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,919
medical medium information it's the one

524
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:02,960
place where people that are the sickest

525
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:05,120
come to find answers and it's not all

526
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:08,720
that biohack [ __ ] out there that's

527
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:10,840
going on it's real it's the real deal

528
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,559
it's real answers real information on

529
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:14,440
how to heal what to do and that's

530
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,919
medical medium information and that's

531
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,240
how it's always been people can be

532
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,960
jealous out there and they can rip it

533
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,600
apart or say what they want about it it

534
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,159
Stills the most people healed in the

535
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,840
world to the most chronic conditions and

536
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:27,440
this is why knowing about this

537
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:30,440
information not just biohacking crap on

538
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,080
social and just this this this and try

539
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,520
this it's for people who have been there

540
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,679
and done that they're seasoned and they

541
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:38,200
know so what happens is there is hope so

542
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:39,440
when these super bugs the super strap

543
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,960
gets to somebody else and they're

544
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,960
fighting these these battling these UTI

545
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:46,520
and it seems hopeless there are women

546
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:49,360
out there with chronic UTI every day of

547
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:52,360
their lives going into overactive

548
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:55,159
bladder going into chronic UTI

549
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:58,480
overactive bladder pain in their kidneys

550
00:24:55,159 --> 00:25:02,559
pain in their back p and then it attack

551
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:05,240
on acne and sore throats and sio because

552
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:07,919
they all get a sibo diagnosis eventually

553
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:10,360
tack on to all all those in there and

554
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,520
they're living with these Super Bug

555
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:13,840
streps it's happening more and more out

556
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:16,039
there and there are more people living

557
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,880
with this than ever before now there is

558
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:19,960
an

559
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:22,520
upsurge that's getting out of control a

560
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:24,960
serious upsurge and that

561
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:26,559
upsurge is not going to stop it's going

562
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,039
to keep on going unless people know how

563
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:30,880
to arm themselves and take care of

564
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:32,880
themselves and know how to fight feed

565
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,279
their bodies what they need do the right

566
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,520
things giving their bodies what their

567
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:39,480
need so they can they can beat this

568
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:41,440
Super Bug stuff down because it's no

569
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:44,679
joke right now cuz people are passing

570
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:47,320
these along and it's out of control

571
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:49,039
people need the right information

572
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:50,720
there's cleanse the heel right here in

573
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:53,399
front of me and in cleanse the heel I

574
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,760
got pelvic inflammatory disease right

575
00:25:53,399 --> 00:25:58,679
and even you know PID right and even

576
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:01,159
prostatis got that there too I'm talking

577
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:03,640
about bladder infections UTI all of that

578
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:06,279
in here so it's cleanse to heal people

579
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:08,440
need this book they need the

580
00:26:06,279 --> 00:26:09,720
information I have Liver Rescue in front

581
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,760
of me right here I want to read a little

582
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,120
bit about this for a couple of minutes

583
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,799
if you guys don't

584
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:18,279
mind the story of

585
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:21,720
strep is what I was just telling you

586
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:23,720
guys that's the story of strep right now

587
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:27,559
in this modern day what people are

588
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:29,960
dealing with and how bad it is okay most

589
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:31,440
people stress starts in childhood they

590
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:34,080
get the ear infections they get the

591
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,720
strep throat the sore throats it starts

592
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:39,360
earlier on it strep passed down from the

593
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,440
parents a lot of times and it's strep

594
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:43,640
that's passed down to the parents and

595
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,720
then the children the B the children

596
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:47,039
have it and the children pass it to each

597
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,799
other in

598
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:52,039
school and so it's it's strep being

599
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:55,559
passed around everywhere that's what it

600
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:58,240
is but that could be fine in some ways

601
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:59,960
but in others it's antibiotic resist

602
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,480
resistance STP that's being passed

603
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:03,000
around going to each person and that

604
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,200
takes us to the next level of

605
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:09,080
understanding which I want to go to

606
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:11,360
now which is the immune system okay

607
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:14,640
that's the next thing every time SHP

608
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:18,440
enters into somebody and battles our

609
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:21,399
immune cells and it survives so anytime

610
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:25,919
SHP enters into each person and it goes

611
00:27:21,399 --> 00:27:28,880
into war with our immune cells right

612
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,480
here goes into war every time that

613
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,760
happens and there's a

614
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:36,279
battle and the strep survives it has

615
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:38,880
information so when that strep is passed

616
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:41,799
onto another person it's not just

617
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:44,159
antibiotics it's also relationships with

618
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:47,720
the immune system of the person it was

619
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:50,200
in this whole time so then when that STP

620
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:52,720
gets passed on to somebody else it's

621
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:55,760
getting passed on to somebody else with

622
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:58,559
information on that person's immune

623
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:01,240
system information of how it survived

624
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:04,720
the battle with that person's white

625
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:07,720
count and so when that strep is in the

626
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,960
new person the strep now has a way to

627
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:11,640
beat immune systems it goes into another

628
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:14,039
person another person's immune system

629
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:16,840
goes up against it there it goes it's in

630
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:18,760
battle the the bacteria survives why do

631
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:21,240
you think people keep on getting acne

632
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:23,080
all over again you still have some strep

633
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:25,720
surviving why do you think they keep on

634
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:27,120
getting the UTI over again the bladder

635
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:32,240
infections the

636
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:34,039
overactive ladder right that one too OAB

637
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,399
they keep on getting these things and

638
00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:37,960
then the thigh and then the sore throats

639
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:39,440
and then the strep throat periodically

640
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:41,960
and then the ear aches and ear

641
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,320
infections or they get exposed to new

642
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:46,799
strains and that's another story and

643
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:48,440
we'll go into that too the strep has

644
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:50,960
information of the person's immune

645
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:53,360
system information of the antibiotics

646
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,480
the other person took they take it to

647
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:58,679
the next person the next person's immune

648
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:01,880
cells go against it they go into battle

649
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:04,080
what survives is Boom the bacteria again

650
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:06,559
some of it survives it gets passed on to

651
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,760
a new person with now immune system

652
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:10,840
information from two others now here's

653
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:12,760
where it gets really

654
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:16,919
intense that

655
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:21,200
bacteria can go through a 100 people and

656
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:24,600
gather information from their immune

657
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:29,000
systems of that 100

658
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:32,600
people that's how super bugs are made

659
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:35,519
it's not just the antibiotic over

660
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:37,799
usage and then the UN and then not being

661
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:39,120
taught how to heal and get rid of the

662
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:42,320
bacteria

663
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:46,360
naturally it's also information from

664
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:51,720
each person's immune cells to each

665
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:55,399
person and that bug becomes one

666
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:56,840
Unstoppable brutal bug and that's why

667
00:29:55,399 --> 00:30:00,120
there are women out there young women in

668
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:02,679
their 20s and in their early 30s that

669
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:05,919
are in tears on a daily basis and they

670
00:30:02,679 --> 00:30:09,640
are so sick and they have so much

671
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:12,519
UTI chronic UTI going on they have so

672
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:15,559
much overactive bladder UTI kidney

673
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:17,240
infection sore throats molay tired

674
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:18,679
fatigue everything else Under the Sun

675
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:20,360
with it and they're suffering and

676
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:21,720
they're bleeding they're on antibiotics

677
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,000
again their stomach's being ripped to

678
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,000
shreds from the

679
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,559
antibiotics then they get their sibo

680
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,600
diagnosis and it's all around the same

681
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:30,799
old thing more antibiotics for that and

682
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,240
they're

683
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:35,720
suffering and then

684
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,159
because they got a strep inside of them

685
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,919
that could have been through a hundred

686
00:30:37,159 --> 00:30:42,080
people that was passed on to them one

687
00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:44,679
way or another and that strep is smart

688
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:47,440
it's smart it knows the immune cell

689
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:50,000
information from dozens of people it

690
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:53,240
knows the antibiotic information from

691
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,320
dozens of people and it carries it with

692
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:57,240
it and we have to know how to destroy

693
00:30:55,320 --> 00:31:00,919
that bacteria and how to kill it and

694
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:02,639
what to use that it is not immune to

695
00:31:00,919 --> 00:31:05,440
because that's the key right medical

696
00:31:02,639 --> 00:31:08,559
medium information is always about the

697
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:13,360
cause cuz guess what they didn't know

698
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:16,000
strep was a UTI problem they didn't know

699
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:18,399
strep was other problems they knew about

700
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,639
strep throat but they didn't know strep

701
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:24,399
created acne they didn't know it created

702
00:31:21,639 --> 00:31:26,639
sty did they didn't know it created UTI

703
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:29,639
by the way that's medical medium

704
00:31:26,639 --> 00:31:30,960
information but it does it's just coming

705
00:31:29,639 --> 00:31:32,080
out people are poaching it and it's

706
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,440
going out there and it's just getting

707
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,559
out there every day just like you guys

708
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,159
are probably seeing because I know you

709
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,600
guys are telling me you see it every day

710
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:41,000
we see it every

711
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:43,320
day but the point is is that bacteria we

712
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,919
have to learn how to kill it you have to

713
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:48,919
identify it and know there's a cause

714
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:49,919
behind your PID there's a cause behind

715
00:31:48,919 --> 00:31:53,440
your

716
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:56,880
UTI there's a cause Behind these

717
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:59,639
things and there's a way to kill and

718
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:02,399
destroy kill and destroy the

719
00:31:59,639 --> 00:32:04,919
bacteria even bacterium that is

720
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:07,279
antibiotic resistant and knows a crap

721
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:09,480
ton of people's immune systems that

722
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:11,279
understands all these people's immune

723
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,200
systems that that bacteria was in all

724
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:16,080
this

725
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:18,000
time understands it is it expert at

726
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,799
immune systems because that's what the

727
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,840
bacteria becomes it becomes an expert at

728
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:27,200
everybody's white count immune cells all

729
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:30,000
of it it knows it all it's been in too

730
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,559
many people it hasn't been destroyed and

731
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,120
it's gotten stronger and stronger now

732
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:35,399
it's a super bug and that's where it's

733
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:37,000
at and that's happening now every day

734
00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:39,519
and we think these super bugs are bad

735
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,639
now wait till the next round of UTI 10

736
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:44,240
years from

737
00:32:40,639 --> 00:32:48,080
now and all the young men and women it's

738
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:50,880
going to be like nobody's ever seen ever

739
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:52,720
seen it's going to be that bad it's

740
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:56,120
going to be bleeding as normal

741
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:58,720
constantly bleeding catheters constantly

742
00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:01,039
on catheters that's another thing too so

743
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:03,159
the UTI are getting to a point where all

744
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:05,600
these young women are are literally

745
00:33:03,159 --> 00:33:08,240
living with

746
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:11,840
catheters that's how bad it

747
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:13,159
is and so we have to be mindful and

748
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,559
understand that there is a way to beat

749
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:15,919
it and there is a way to do we're going

750
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,080
to talk about that in a little bit but I

751
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:22,320
want to read a little if I

752
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:25,240
can okay maybe most people strep starts

753
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:28,240
in childhood maybe even pass down from a

754
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:30,080
parent at conception yes a new born can

755
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,159
enter the world with strep already in

756
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:35,039
her or his

757
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:37,960
system a child can also get strep from

758
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:39,360
daycare or school and it's easily passed

759
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:42,639
from child to

760
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:45,080
child it really is as well as adult to

761
00:33:42,639 --> 00:33:48,039
adult because strep is a type of

762
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:50,240
bacterium antibiotics do seem like the

763
00:33:48,039 --> 00:33:52,880
obvious choice to treat it but here's

764
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:55,960
the crucial point that I talked about to

765
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:59,039
know about strep long ago before

766
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:00,440
antibiotic Revolution before antibiotics

767
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:02,600
long ago you guys this is really

768
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:05,880
interesting right here before the

769
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:09,320
antibiotic was born long

770
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:13,560
ago strep used to be one strain of

771
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:15,800
bacterium strep was one strain of

772
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:17,079
bacterium which takes us to this next

773
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:20,480
part right here now this is really

774
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:22,800
important okay this is

775
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,800
important very

776
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,720
important going to bring this around for

777
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:30,320
a second

778
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:34,679
okay all right

779
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:38,320
so five antibiotics ago 10 antibiotics

780
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:40,079
ago 10 different people ago the bacteria

781
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:44,440
look like

782
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:48,839
this right but then it changes a new

783
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:53,119
strain is is is created along

784
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:56,760
with the superbug power it alters and

785
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:58,960
turns into a different bug now we have

786
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:00,839
the old strain

787
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,480
that's way in the past and it's in other

788
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:05,800
people we got the new

789
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:10,000
strain and there it

790
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:10,000
is right there that new

791
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,839
strain becomes another new strain

792
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:18,440
eventually another new strain another

793
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:21,240
new strain but here's the thing if you

794
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:24,079
pass on this strain that it became to

795
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:26,240
another person through sex or through

796
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:28,960
drinking from somebody's glass or from

797
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:30,680
being in a bar and eating something or

798
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,480
whatever you're doing in a restaurant or

799
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:34,359
on a shopping cart in a shopping cart or

800
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,640
in a public bathroom or so many other

801
00:35:34,359 --> 00:35:38,760
ways you can do

802
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:42,200
this if you pass on that strep bacteria

803
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:45,240
to somebody in that in that strain to

804
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:48,440
them they'll have that

805
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:51,800
strain and they may keep that strain but

806
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:55,960
it'll be that strain okay these in this

807
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:59,640
person can still alter and become a new

808
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:01,560
strain in a few few years that new

809
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:03,720
strain can be passed on to another

810
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:05,359
person and then they'll have that

811
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:08,880
strain

812
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:08,880
see that's how it

813
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:18,319
works men can get UTI too and they do

814
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:19,800
but they don't have a cycle men do not

815
00:36:18,319 --> 00:36:23,280
have

816
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:24,760
menstration they do not have a cycle so

817
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,599
they don't have the immune system

818
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,920
lowering thing that happens so what

819
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:29,480
happens is when a woman goes through

820
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,920
menstruation and she has her cycle her

821
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:33,839
monthly cycle her immune system drops

822
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,440
and 80% of her immune system goes to the

823
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:37,520
reproductive system that's medical me

824
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,160
information 20% stays around the body

825
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,880
for the rest of the body the

826
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:43,119
reproductive system is the number one

827
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:46,079
Focus that time of month where it's the

828
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:49,319
number one Focus for the immune system

829
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:51,079
think about that right so because of

830
00:36:49,319 --> 00:36:52,880
that the immune system is so focused

831
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:56,240
around the reproductive

832
00:36:52,880 --> 00:37:00,000
system okay that it's easy to catch STP

833
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:01,560
orally very easy to catch it orally or

834
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,200
in the eyes where the immune system

835
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:05,200
isn't there to destroy it right off the

836
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:07,119
running so if there's some kind of

837
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,599
relationship or a shopping cart like I

838
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:10,119
said or a public bathroom and something

839
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:14,160
goes in the eye or something gets in the

840
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:16,160
mouth whatever it is during the cycle

841
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:18,839
80% of the immune system isn't around

842
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:21,839
the mouth it's not there so for a woman

843
00:37:18,839 --> 00:37:26,160
it's not here it's down here so the

844
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:27,760
strep can easily start its its beginning

845
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,839
in the mouth in the throat and the so

846
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,839
for so forth in that area so that

847
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:32,680
happens too all right let's go into just

848
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:36,319
a little

849
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:40,200
bit all right here's the crucial point

850
00:37:36,319 --> 00:37:42,760
to know about strep long ago before the

851
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:45,400
antibiotic Revolution I'm reading out of

852
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,720
Liver Rescue if you guys never seen

853
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,760
these books you don't know about these

854
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,800
books you should get both of them go to

855
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:53,640
Amazon get both be the best thing you

856
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:56,440
ever did become an expert about your own

857
00:37:53,640 --> 00:38:00,520
health learn how to

858
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:02,839
heal become a true expert a true expert

859
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,839
not a

860
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:10,680
biohacker strep is not and never was a

861
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:14,200
super bug in the past so strep was never

862
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:16,599
a super buug it's not designed to be a

863
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:20,000
Super Bug originally it was never meant

864
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:23,119
to be one we are forcing it to become a

865
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:26,920
super buug

866
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:30,160
okay it's much more forgiving strep than

867
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:32,640
ever than anything else was okay in its

868
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:34,960
original state going back many years ago

869
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:37,119
it was much more forgiving it's a

870
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:40,880
forgiving

871
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:44,119
bacteria it's not as unforgiving as

872
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:48,400
merca it's not as unforgiving as Mera so

873
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:51,720
that is something to understand cith and

874
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:55,560
Mera can be even much more brutal much

875
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:59,800
more brutal of a superbug strep still

876
00:38:55,560 --> 00:39:03,040
even with its worst superbug mentality

877
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:07,119
whatever it's more superbug

878
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:10,440
creation it doesn't hold the power as

879
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:12,920
like Mera and what Mera can turn into

880
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:16,240
some kind of flesh eating bacterium that

881
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:19,240
just becomes a super super bug so I want

882
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:21,480
that clear so people

883
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:22,720
know so if they got strap and they're

884
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,680
living with st they're living with all

885
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,720
these symptoms you can turn it in it can

886
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:28,319
turn naturally into a Super Bug over

887
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:31,280
time because it's force-fed the

888
00:39:28,319 --> 00:39:34,680
antibiotics it's force-fed in the way I

889
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:38,440
was saying all those things but it won't

890
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:40,280
get to like a Mera level at mca's worst

891
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:42,040
so the different varieties of Mera

892
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:45,000
there's all these different varities of

893
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:47,599
Mera did you know there's thousands of

894
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:51,359
varieties of Vera and some of the top

895
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:55,480
tier varieties of Vera that are just

896
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:57,040
like God awful and they kill people is

897
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:59,520
what they do and they give them sepsis

898
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:03,079
and they die like the top tier of the

899
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:04,920
worst sh's not there so I wanted that to

900
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:08,480
be

901
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:10,200
clear but strep is no longer one strain

902
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,480
I want to go back to that a little bit

903
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:15,319
it's no longer one

904
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:18,079
strain there are so many varieties of

905
00:40:15,319 --> 00:40:20,680
strep at this point over the

906
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:23,240
decades strep being a victim of

907
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:25,680
antibiotics it found a way to survive to

908
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:27,760
adapt adaptation didn't just mean

909
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:30,119
getting stronger it meant mut eating and

910
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:32,440
spawning different strains and varieties

911
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:35,839
and that's what strep does it's the

912
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:39,240
ultimate like spawner of new varieties

913
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:42,680
of bacteria all strep all the same

914
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:44,480
family but it's the ultimate see here

915
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:47,280
with Mariana says over there on IG I

916
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:49,760
healed my UTI back in 2002 with the

917
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:53,359
herbs and supplements you recommend in

918
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:56,880
cleanse the heal book amazing is it

919
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:59,839
2020 let see what it is um healing with

920
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,960
Victoria I used to be on an antibiotic

921
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:03,440
once a month for UTI I haven't needed

922
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,599
them in four years thanks to your

923
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:08,440
protocols thanks to you andc medical

924
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:11,480
meme information destroys UTI just

925
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:13,079
destroys them so one thing about mm info

926
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:14,800
if you know how to use it and you use it

927
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:17,119
right you can annihilate so many

928
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:19,680
different strep

929
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:23,920
conditions Shamrock over there in IG

930
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:26,160
this was me with I see whoa I see for 20

931
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:29,440
years of extreme bladder pain until I

932
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:32,160
found medical me information thank you

933
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:35,079
aw incredible

934

incredible over here Heidi on IG before

935
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:40,400
medical medium I had chronic strep

00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:42,760
throat UTI and kidney infections I now

937
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:46,200
have no pain and haven't had to run to

938
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:49,119
the doctor in many years this info Works

939
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:53,359
quote from you amazing and I will add to

940
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:56,160
that quote from you it does work it does

941
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:59,000
work it does it has a track record of

942
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:01,480
working that's the power of it you no

943
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,960
biohackers and informationists messing

944
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:05,520
around all these different things out

945
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:07,280
there on social can do that for people

946
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:09,160
this information does and that's why I'm

947
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,319
a messenger of s so's information

948
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:13,760
because it saves lives Maria over there

949
00:42:11,319 --> 00:42:15,760
on YouTube great topic I used to get UTI

950
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:18,920
all the time and they are so painful

951
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:20,880
it's much better thanks to aw and S so

952
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:23,800
incredible let's go into a little bit of

953
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:25,400
protocol talk a little bit too and let's

954
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,119
just double check we covered some stuff

955
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,119
right

956
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:29,960
here let's talk about like the different

957
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:31,880
strains a little bit longer the spawning

958
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:33,599
the different strains I want to go into

959
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:35,359
that over there on YouTube wondering

960
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:38,119
wishing good to see you antibiotics used

961
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:42,119
to be the go-to for our family after

962
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:44,880
medical meeting protocols viy zinc micro

00:42:56,119 --> 00:43:03,559
medium it's going to get me

969
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:06,079
emotional because you know when you heal

970
00:43:03,559 --> 00:43:08,720
it is everything Maria over there on

971
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:10,520
YouTube great topic I used to get UTI oh

972
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:15,319
I saw that one already great Chrissy

973
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:18,160
over there and I think um twitch Stitch

974
00:43:15,319 --> 00:43:21,559
Chrissy I was in tears every time I had

975
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:24,000
a UTI I can't imagine the amount of

976
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:26,680
people that are going through it and

977
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,920
they go through it on levels that are

978
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:34,319
just devastating it's become like the

979
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:36,480
Super Bug now level and it's brutal and

980
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:38,119
so many people suffer from it their guts

981
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,880
get ripped to shreds from all the

982
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:42,720
antibiotics they have to take they're on

983
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:44,559
steroids almost all the time and it's

984
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:46,839
brutal along the way strep got

985
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:50,680
classified as having a group a and a

986
00:43:46,839 --> 00:43:53,079
group b yeah the medical world now

987
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:54,839
identifies strep all the way through

988
00:43:53,079 --> 00:43:58,960
Group

989
00:43:54,839 --> 00:44:01,760
H Group H though as you read about in

990
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:04,839
the acne chapter because acne is Strep

991
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:07,800
caused by the way you guys it is it's

992
00:44:04,839 --> 00:44:09,760
medical medium info but it's strep cause

993
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:13,079
that the population carries there are

994
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:14,920
also strains within the known groups

995
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:17,000
that are yet un that are yet

996
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:18,960
unidentified and undocumented so here's

997
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,440
how medicine

998
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:25,079
works medical research and science works

999
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:28,040
like this they've classified some of the

1000
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:30,280
bacterium the strains but they haven't

1001
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:32,240
classified all of them haven't even

1002
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:34,920
scratched the surface so there's

1003
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:37,160
bacteria out there that they haven't

1004
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:38,640
even documented classified got their

1005
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:41,359
hands on or anything like that and

1006
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:44,359
that's the scary thing it's even

1007
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:48,040
scarier yep even a gifted and talented

1008
00:44:44,359 --> 00:44:50,720
lab technician discovered that even if a

1009
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:52,160
gifted and talented lab technician

1010
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,640
discovered that there were more strains

1011
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:56,000
and groups of strep that weren't

1012
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:58,400
currently known the Breakthrough would

1013
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,359
go unrecognized the scientists would not

1014
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:02,240
be able to find funding for this area of

1015
00:45:00,359 --> 00:45:04,200
critical medical importance because

1016
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:08,640
right now funding is too tied up in

1017
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:11,359
misled areas like how genes relate to

1018
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:14,040
disease so yeah you guys let's go into

1019
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:15,480
this a little bit now some protocol

1020
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:18,880
stuff I'm in cleans the heal if you

1021
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:21,920
don't have the book I feel bad for

1022
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:25,359
you get the book get the book get the

1023
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:28,559
book I mean you don't have to spend a

1024
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:31,400
$5,000 program on how to walk Barefoot

1025
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:33,960
on your on your lawn you can do that but

1026
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:36,800
it won't make your UTI go away keep that

1027
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:39,280
in mind you can do earthing and you can

1028
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:41,119
do like you can not wear shoes and you

1029
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,800
can watch the sunrise in the morning and

1030
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:45,800
you can angle your bed a certain way in

1031
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:47,599
your room the way the sun rises and sun

1032
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:51,000
sun sets but none of that's going to get

1033
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:54,200
rid of somebody's de debilitating acne

1034
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,920
sty UTI bladder infections kidney

1035
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:57,480
infections

1036
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,680
PID

1037
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:04,240
it's just not going to

1038
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:05,880
happen hardcore stuff that has to work

1039
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:08,720
then you can do all that stuff for fun

1040
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:12,319
the other stuff I was mentioning okay

1041
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:15,400
danan 144 on IG I was in so much pain

1042
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:17,319
for nine months with intertial cystis

1043
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:20,319
celery juice saved my

1044
00:46:17,319 --> 00:46:22,240
life yeah and that's why when someone

1045
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:23,960
says celery juice sucks or celery juice

1046
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:26,440
isn't what it is or something out there

1047
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:30,040
that's it's actually such a disservice

1048
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:31,880
The Chronic ill it's so sad when celery

1049
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:35,800
juice literally has turned lives around

1050
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:37,960
saved lives yeah I know all right let's

1051
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:41,880
go into it pelvic inflammatory disease

1052
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:43,720
PID right here talks about UTI it's in

1053
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:47,599
here right here cleanse to

1054
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:51,280
heal all right the true cause bacterial

1055
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:53,280
infection of one or more strains from

1056
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:57,079
over 50 groups of

1057
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:59,319
strep they are different levels of PID

1058
00:46:57,079 --> 00:47:01,359
it's like different levels of

1059
00:46:59,319 --> 00:47:05,920
UTI different levels to all the

1060
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:05,920

00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:50,240
claw every day out there and more about

1094
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:52,280
cats claw every day it's the medical

1095
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:54,920
medium information that got that out

1096
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:57,280
there catclaw was around it's been

1097
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:58,839
around obviously but using for the

1098
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:01,000
things that it's being used for for

1099
00:48:58,839 --> 00:49:04,240
protocols is medical medium information

1100
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:06,559
originally for cats claw

1101
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:10,559
curcumin and there you go that's another

1102
