[0.20 - 5.44] today we're talking about teeth damaging
[2.68 - 8.04] diets and we're making asparagus
[5.44 - 11.12] sushi right here asparagus sushi I'm
[8.04 - 13.48] excited about this right out of brain
[11.12 - 13.48] saver
[14.44 - 18.24] protocols what you'll see out there in
[16.48 - 20.72] the world is everybody in the dental
[18.24 - 22.56] chairs they're in the dentist offices
[20.72 - 24.60] they're getting their teeth drilled
[22.56 - 27.52] they're getting root canals cavities
[24.60 - 30.88] filled they gum disease they're getting
[27.52 - 33.84] that plaque ripped out right all that
[30.88 - 36.52] plaque ripped out they're doing all that
[33.84 - 38.56] too it's another thing
[36.52 - 41.24] happening everybody's going in there and
[38.56 - 45.96] they dread it they dread getting the
[41.24 - 48.84] under the gum plaque ripped up it's
[45.96 - 50.88] awful scrape scrape scrape scrape we're
[48.84 - 52.12] going to numb you up here we'll do a
[50.88 - 54.00] whole bunch of numbing agents scrape
[52.12 - 55.68] scrape scrape scrape scrape that's a
[54.00 - 56.96] painful process so many people are up
[55.68 - 59.04] against that and then of course they get
[56.96 - 61.24] root canals they get all kinds of
[59.04 - 63.84] different things
[61.24 - 65.40] see they have problems with their nerves
[63.84 - 69.12] and their teeth they have pain that's
[65.40 - 70.84] not even Dental caused but either way
[69.12 - 72.44] people get a lot of root canals they
[70.84 - 73.96] have a lot of problems with their Dentin
[72.44 - 75.64] we're going to cover a little bit about
[73.96 - 77.60] that all on its own we're also making a
[75.64 - 80.68] sparga sushi but we're going into the
[77.60 - 83.60] teeth big time and I'm proud to say I'm
[80.68 - 86.72] going to say it right here every single
[83.60 - 90.52] one of my teeth are mine they are not
[86.72 - 93.12] implants every single one of
[90.52 - 94.36] them that's key to know because people
[93.12 - 96.40] are going to be probably wondering what
[94.36 - 99.32] about his deep what about his deep it's
[96.40 - 104.44] one thing the other thing right I don't
[99.32 - 107.04] have one root canal not one root canal
[104.44 - 110.56] important right there another thing too
[107.04 - 113.52] aw doesn't have any gum disease on any
[110.56 - 116.80] level not even the basic gum disease
[113.52 - 120.44] that people have not one gum
[116.80 - 123.52] disease and number three not one
[120.44 - 126.68] organic cavity which is critical for
[123.52 - 128.32] people to know how come how come aw
[126.68 - 132.20] doesn't have all of that like what's
[128.32 - 136.32] going on wonder wonder because I stay
[132.20 - 137.72] away from teeth damaging diets it's one
[136.32 - 139.44] thing too so we're going to talk about
[137.72 - 142.60] also when you come into this world as a
[139.44 - 144.80] child and you're severely Trace mineral
[142.60 - 147.24] deficient and filled with a lot of heavy
[144.80 - 150.00] metals because it's passed down from the
[147.24 - 153.00] parents how teeth can become a problem
[150.00 - 155.68] very early on with so many kids all the
[153.00 - 157.40] way going into teenager and and young
[155.68 - 159.12] adult and so forth how many teeth
[157.40 - 162.52] problems so many people can have and
[159.12 - 165.44] we're also going to cover how our teeth
[162.52 - 167.96] just start to fall apart we don't see it
[165.44 - 170.16] yet we don't know what's happening but
[167.96 - 173.52] deep inside our teeth are starting to
[170.16 - 176.64] fall apart we don't know and our acidic
[173.52 - 181.16] diets are actually draining the calcium
[176.64 - 183.08] from our teeth and then out of nowhere
[181.16 - 186.12] they fall apart when they fall apart
[183.08 - 187.80] they are time capsules that means you
[186.12 - 189.68] want to start a new diet that's really
[187.80 - 191.56] special and great and your teeth start
[189.68 - 193.80] falling apart right away within the
[191.56 - 196.16] first week or month or the first few
[193.80 - 198.76] months your teeth were going to fall
[196.16 - 200.80] apart anyway because it took years for
[198.76 - 202.64] them to fall apart and this is Inc
[200.80 - 205.76] incredible information we're covering
[202.64 - 208.72] get ready for this one you may like what
[205.76 - 210.80] you hear you may not like what you hear
[208.72 - 212.80] and we're also going to be doing the
[210.80 - 214.88] medical M cooking show today which is
[212.80 - 217.80] cool too cuz I'm making some really
[214.88 - 219.56] really badass Nory rolls the asparagus
[217.80 - 222.80] ones I got
[219.56 - 224.68] cauliflower as the rice I got my pan
[222.80 - 225.80] ready so let's give a run now you guys I
[224.68 - 228.12] don't know if you guys have the
[225.80 - 229.60] ingredients at your house right now
[228.12 - 231.08] maybe you do maybe you can make a Nori
[229.60 - 232.68] roll that maybe you don't have
[231.08 - 233.88] everything here but quick rundown we got
[232.68 - 236.44] the cauliflower that's going to be the
[233.88 - 240.32] cauliflower rice we got the
[236.44 - 241.80] scallions onion scallions from my Garden
[240.32 - 243.20] I'm I'm actually proud of those those
[241.80 - 244.80] are really good they're sharp though
[243.20 - 248.32] they got an edge to them they really
[244.80 - 250.52] they got the garlic ginger right there
[248.32 - 252.12] hot cayenne peppers for my garden we're
[250.52 - 255.08] going to use that in some of the dipping
[252.12 - 256.92] sauce we got the radishes I love the
[255.08 - 259.92] radishes whoa that one almost got away
[256.92 - 262.16] from me and we have the asparagus which
[259.92 - 264.80] is lightly steamed asparagus is lightly
[262.16 - 267.44] steamed it's not steamed to death but
[264.80 - 269.24] yet it's actually a little softer I like
[267.44 - 271.88] it that way for rolling up so it doesn't
[269.24 - 274.00] tear apart the Nory sheet the Nory roll
[271.88 - 276.12] right that's there I got my limes you
[274.00 - 277.72] might not be able to see in the bowl
[276.12 - 280.08] right here and of course I have my
[277.72 - 281.64] oranges as well so I got those as well
[280.08 - 282.96] so I'm excited I might even have
[281.64 - 284.64] something else that I'm using here I got
[282.96 - 286.80] some honey over here whole bunch of
[284.64 - 288.84] other stuff so let's get into some teeth
[286.80 - 290.48] talk and then we're going to do some
[288.84 - 292.60] cooking we're going to make the
[290.48 - 295.64] asparagus sushi

[325.96 - 331.16] every now and then you'll get somebody
[327.24 - 334.88] that does that all right let's roll into
[331.16 - 336.92] it teeth destroying I like using that
[334.88 - 338.48] word with this situation because it gets
[336.92 - 341.96] that bad number one thing you got to
[338.48 - 343.20] worry about right here probably one of
[341.96 - 346.64] the number one things there's a bunch of
[343.20 - 349.44] them what you see right here is vinegar
[346.64 - 352.68] okay different vinegars I got the white
[349.44 - 354.28] vinegar I got the vinegar that has a
[352.68 - 355.44] darker color I don't care if it's apple
[354.28 - 357.32] cider vinegar I don't care if it's
[355.44 - 359.64] vinegar from planet Mars I don't care if
[357.32 - 361.52] it's vinegar from planet Pluto I I don't
[359.64 - 363.92] care if it's vinegar from somebody's own
[361.52 - 366.60] backyard I don't care if it's red wine
[363.92 - 370.08] balsamic I don't care what it is where
[366.60 - 372.76] it comes from I don't care if a monkey
[370.08 - 375.96] in a tree in Costa Rica made the vinegar
[372.76 - 378.40] I don't care if someone pressed the
[375.96 - 380.88] apples themselves in their basement
[378.40 - 382.80] somewhere in the bush and made the
[380.88 - 385.56] vinegar and I don't care if it's the
[382.80 - 387.64] finest vinegar in Italy on a trip to
[385.56 - 389.52] Europe I always feel better when I go to
[387.64 - 390.88] Europe I'm always feeling better when I
[389.52 - 394.08] go there how come everybody in Europe
[390.88 - 396.48] though are sick sick sick sick and
[394.08 - 397.88] they're eating the food too reason why I
[396.48 - 399.76] must be feeling better when I go to
[397.88 - 402.40] Europe is because it's a vacation I'm
[399.76 - 404.00] not so stressed out and I'm happy to get
[402.40 - 405.96] out of the states for a little while and
[404.00 - 408.16] I could go on my little tour and I could
[405.96 - 409.64] be yeah exactly anyway we're going to
[408.16 - 410.96] cover that another day that's a big
[409.64 - 413.60] topic the point is I don't care if the
[410.96 - 416.44] vinegar comes from Grease it comes from
[413.60 - 420.28] Italy I don't care what kind it's going
[416.44 - 423.28] to slowly destroy your teeth I can say
[420.28 - 425.56] it over and over and over again until
[423.28 - 428.72] I'm blue in the face like blue in the
[425.56 - 431.40] face because people don't realize is
[428.72 - 434.40] vinegar not just wears away the enamel
[431.40 - 436.20] so you can stick a straw in something
[434.40 - 438.20] and drink it thinking it's not going to
[436.20 - 440.96] hit the enamel but that's not the
[438.20 - 443.12] problem the vinegar goes in deep and
[440.96 - 445.76] causes a Calcium deficiency meaning it
[443.12 - 448.08] draws calcium every time you use vinegar
[445.76 - 450.00] anywhere anyhow you're pulling calcium
[448.08 - 453.48] from your teeth
[450.00 - 456.32] yes and over time this gets worse and
[453.48 - 458.40] worse meaning the effects happen each
[456.32 - 460.92] year you don't even know it you might
[458.40 - 462.80] not be aware of it and then and the
[460.92 - 465.68] dentist doesn't even see it too doesn't
[462.80 - 469.80] even see deep down in the tooth deep
[465.68 - 471.92] down in the Dentin what's happening cuz
[469.80 - 474.52] that's important right there so let's go
[471.92 - 476.84] and let's talk about that a little bit
[474.52 - 480.20] down into the Dentin of the
[476.84 - 483.32] tooth it starts there
[480.20 - 487.40] that's where it starts in the Dentin
[483.32 - 490.80] critical to know you do the vinegar and
[487.40 - 495.88] then the vinegar eats away the inside
[490.80 - 498.20] out not just from the outside the inside
[495.88 - 500.00] out probably one of the most important
[498.20 - 502.12] things to learn if you're trying to
[500.00 - 504.44] protect your teeth now I don't have root
[502.12 - 507.12] canals I don't have teeth problems I
[504.44 - 510.56] don't have gum disease and I have all my
[507.12 - 513.88] original teeth I don't have in plants
[510.56 - 516.92] and I've never gotten veneers I don't go
[513.88 - 518.68] and get professional whitenings okay I'm
[516.92 - 520.76] not a supermodel supermodels get
[518.68 - 523.92] professional whitenings like once a
[520.76 - 525.32] month I get it that's what they do
[523.92 - 526.84] they're getting veneers they're getting
[525.32 - 528.12] dental work left and right they're
[526.84 - 529.92] getting implants they're getting
[528.12 - 531.56] whitenings I understand that's what
[529.92 - 534.20] people do and people in the public eye
[531.56 - 536.96] do that too I don't do anything for my
[534.20 - 538.68] teeth to be in the public eye I just
[536.96 - 542.56] want to make that clear to anybody
[538.68 - 546.72] that's here here I protect my Dentin and
[542.56 - 550.04] protect my teeth by not
[546.72 - 552.52] doing one of the things that people do
[550.04 - 554.52] every single day every salsa they have
[552.52 - 557.60] every condiment every relish every
[554.52 - 559.36] pickled this pickled that every little
[557.60 - 561.84] thing that has vinegar in it from
[559.36 - 564.76] mayonnaise to you name it they're doing
[561.84 - 567.44] vinegar every single day you might be
[564.76 - 569.88] one of the people that I don't want any
[567.44 - 572.28] restrictions I can't have restriction I
[569.88 - 574.08] want to eat what I want forget medical
[572.28 - 576.12] meat restrictions I'm going to have all
[574.08 - 578.00] the vinegar I want oh my teeth are
[576.12 - 580.36] falling apart 2 years later 3 years
[578.00 - 582.32] later my teeth are falling apart during
[580.36 - 584.48] that medical medium but I don't want to
[582.32 - 586.20] let go of my vinegars no way I'm going
[584.48 - 588.32] to make sure it's in all my condiments
[586.20 - 591.68] and all my Salsas and all my dishes and
[588.32 - 593.24] all my salads and people pay the price
[591.68 - 594.60] so vinegar is one thing right there so
[593.24 - 596.04] let's go a little deeper into it how
[594.60 - 598.64] does it work the minute that vinegar
[596.04 - 600.00] touches your mouth inside goes right
[598.64 - 602.12] inside
[600.00 - 603.88] there's a call for calcium your body
[602.12 - 606.60] goes into freakout mode it's like
[603.88 - 611.24] calcium where are you calcium where are
[606.60 - 613.08] you instantly because it's acetic acid
[611.24 - 615.64] send me the red wine vinegar the Apple
[613.08 - 618.44] Ceta vinegar whatever kind you want the
[615.64 - 621.24] minute it goes into your mouth your body
[618.44 - 624.84] screaming an alarm Bell that alarm Bell
[621.24 - 626.76] is calcium calcium the vinegar is acetic
[624.84 - 629.96] acid it's going to create it's going to
[626.76 - 632.56] create a problem it's going to burn the
[629.96 - 635.44] body internally I'm not talking about
[632.56 - 637.84] outside use there's there's uses for
[635.44 - 639.60] vinegar on the outside of the body
[637.84 - 643.92] periodically I'm talking about
[639.60 - 645.96] internally so there's a call for calcium
[643.92 - 647.96] it's kind of like when a fire starts in
[645.96 - 650.16] a building and the fire department's
[647.96 - 651.28] called and the fire department comes out
[650.16 - 652.64] and they're freaking out and they're
[651.28 - 653.92] bringing out their hoses and they're
[652.64 - 655.80] trying to save lives and they're trying
[653.92 - 657.40] to die out the fire what's happening is
[655.80 - 659.56] your body is freaking out the minute
[657.40 - 660.56] that acetic acid that vinegar enters
[659.56 - 663.40] into your
[660.56 - 666.12] mouth your body's calling for the fire
[663.40 - 668.16] hose it's calling for the calcium fire
[666.12 - 671.96] hose is what it's calling
[668.16 - 674.36] for and that calcium fire hose is your
[671.96 - 675.64] calcium storage bins so any kind of
[674.36 - 678.88] calcium you got in your bloodstream
[675.64 - 680.52] instantly gone instantly gone so what
[678.88 - 682.64] happens with people don't
[680.52 - 687.20] realize and this is an important thing
[682.64 - 687.20] to know right off right off the start
[687.28 - 692.36] here okay we have calcium floating
[691.12 - 694.52] around the
[692.36 - 696.48] bloodstream we have calcium that's
[694.52 - 698.88] circulating around the bloodstream just
[696.48 - 700.72] from the things you eat on a daily basis
[698.88 - 703.12] cuz a little bit of calcium in almost
[700.72 - 704.60] everything if you're a meat eater
[703.12 - 706.56] there's a little touch of calcium in the
[704.60 - 708.32] meat chicken eater there a little touch
[706.56 - 710.24] of calcium in the chicken it's not much
[708.32 - 712.68] but it's there if you eat a vegetable
[710.24 - 714.72] there some calcium in there if you eat
[712.68 - 717.60] an orange lots of calcium there's
[714.72 - 719.76] calcium in the foods you're eating that
[717.60 - 721.36] calcium is floating around your
[719.76 - 723.08] bloodstream you might be somebody that
[721.36 - 724.44] takes a calcium supplement maybe you got
[723.08 - 726.80] some of that floating around your
[724.44 - 728.92] bloodstream that's not exactly the same
[726.80 - 730.28] but the point is is we have calcium from
[728.92 - 732.12] the foods we eat that are floating
[730.28 - 733.68] around our bloodstream and guess what
[732.12 - 736.52] happens the minute you drop in that
[733.68 - 739.68] acetic acid right off the running that
[736.52 - 743.48] calcium is used up fast it's used up
[739.68 - 745.68] that hour that hour I'm going to take my
[743.48 - 747.76] apple cider vinegar shots because I
[745.68 - 750.60] heard on Tik Tock it's a great thing to
[747.76 - 752.80] do let me go keep doing it there and
[750.60 - 754.36] then you're losing all of your calcium
[752.80 - 755.96] that's in your bloodstream in that
[754.36 - 757.52] moment and not only do you lose the
[755.96 - 760.16] calcium that's in the bloodstream in
[757.52 - 763.68] that moment but you start losing calcium
[760.16 - 765.00] out of the bones and teeth you guys in
[763.68 - 767.72] that
[765.00 - 771.00] moment not next
[767.72 - 774.44] year in that moment you're losing
[771.00 - 778.40] calcium out of your bones and
[774.44 - 781.24] teeth calcium is there to neutralize the
[778.40 - 783.76] AC IC acid it doesn't do a great
[781.24 - 787.04] job but the calcium's there to
[783.76 - 790.00] neutralize the acetic acid so your bones
[787.04 - 792.28] and teeth don't fall apart too quick but
[790.00 - 795.56] they still fall apart over time let's go
[792.28 - 795.56] into drum
[798.12 - 803.44] roll we
[800.44 - 803.44] got
[804.52 - 807.76] chocolate we
[806.24 - 810.56] got
[807.76 - 812.68] caffeine
[810.56 - 817.12] caffeina we got
[812.68 - 819.32] chocolate Okay caffeine that's a big one
[817.12 - 821.88] that hurts the teeth too teeth
[819.32 - 823.80] destroying diets well I'm on this great
[821.88 - 825.92] diet it's really good it's this keto
[823.80 - 827.64] diet it's really cool it's a keto diet
[825.92 - 829.40] it's got some it's got a little bit of
[827.64 - 831.24] fruit and some lots of vegetables in
[829.40 - 834.08] there it's good yeah know I have my
[831.24 - 836.56] cacao I do have my cow I really like it
[834.08 - 839.20] and that's good there I do have my
[836.56 - 840.88] chocolate that's in my diet you know you
[839.20 - 842.60] got to have balance you got to have
[840.88 - 845.60] moderation and
[842.60 - 850.56] balance but your teeth are going to
[845.60 - 852.12] suffer they just are I'm not trying to
[850.56 - 853.36] just be like you guys look I want to
[852.12 - 855.20] make your lives miserable today I want
[853.36 - 857.08] to tell you about caffeine and chocolate
[855.20 - 859.24] cuz you guys are most most everybody's
[857.08 - 864.24] on it I'm sure some of you guys aren't
[859.24 - 867.16] right but I just think it's this if you
[864.24 - 870.32] know what causes teeth problems and you
[867.16 - 872.64] learn and you still do it I don't know
[870.32 - 873.92] what to say just when the teeth are
[872.64 - 875.68] falling apart and you're getting more
[873.92 - 878.08] root canals and you're getting more
[875.68 - 879.48] teeth work and more cavities filled and
[878.08 - 881.12] your gums are getting that plaque
[879.48 - 883.20] underneath the
[881.12 - 886.80] teeth just
[883.20 - 888.72] know some of the causes to begin with
[886.80 - 891.36] okay so a lot of people think
[888.72 - 893.24] chocolate's healthy chocolate's good for
[891.36 - 895.04] you because we're taught that we're high
[893.24 - 897.28] on chocolate we're high in the caffeine
[895.04 - 899.64] life's hard we need that rush we need
[897.28 - 902.08] that coffee we need that CA c in there
[899.64 - 905.56] coffee is so acidic it's another teeth
[902.08 - 907.68] destroyer from the inside out so when it
[905.56 - 910.52] comes down to coffee it's a little
[907.68 - 912.92] different than acetic acid coffee
[910.52 - 916.00] happens to be extremely acidic what it
[912.92 - 919.32] does is it kills those those um adrenal
[916.00 - 922.64] glands it kills your stomach glands it
[919.32 - 925.44] starts to actually cause problems
[922.64 - 927.64] deficits in those glands your adrenal
[925.44 - 929.44] glands and your stomach glands both
[927.64 - 932.00] those believe it or not do help and
[929.44 - 933.80] protect your teeth over time but what we
[932.00 - 936.92] do is we drink coffee every single day
[933.80 - 940.40] not only is the cdic nature of coffee
[936.92 - 942.28] really harsh on enamel do you ever hear
[940.40 - 944.00] about coffee stains right coffee stains
[942.28 - 946.60] coffee stains are different than if you
[944.00 - 949.08] eat a whole thing of
[946.60 - 951.08] blueberries blueberries that's a pigment
[949.08 - 952.48] that's anthocyan in that gets into the
[951.08 - 954.04] teeth sometimes you're eating a hole
[952.48 - 955.72] you're eating all these blueberries
[954.04 - 958.08] right blueberries blueberries
[955.72 - 961.72] blueberries that's different than coffee
[958.08 - 963.80] stains coffee stains coffee stains what
[961.72 - 966.84] you'll notice today in today's world is
[963.80 - 970.04] a lot different than back in the 80s in
[966.84 - 971.20] the 70s and '90s where everybody's teeth
[970.04 - 975.52] were just
[971.20 - 977.68] yellow just yellow you see people on
[975.52 - 979.20] talk shows in the 1980s their teeth were
[977.68 - 981.40] all
[979.20 - 983.72] yellow even they they're using white
[981.40 - 984.92] strips everybody had white strips in
[983.72 - 987.00] their mouth everybody in the
[984.92 - 989.04] professional you know public figure
[987.00 - 991.12] Arena all had white stripss their mouth
[989.04 - 993.24] every single day they did they were
[991.12 - 995.48] living on White Strips on their teeth
[993.24 - 997.00] but their teeth were all yellow you see
[995.48 - 1000.60] a
[997.00 - 1004.48] concert even like you see a you you see
[1000.60 - 1006.24] a theater or concert program and you see
[1004.48 - 1008.16] people in the front in the 1980s and you
[1006.24 - 1010.04] see them all their teeth are just
[1008.16 - 1012.36] doesn't matter what age they were 25
[1010.04 - 1013.84] years old 28 years old 32 years old
[1012.36 - 1016.28] their teeth were just all
[1013.84 - 1018.76] yellow right so we're in a place where
[1016.28 - 1022.04] there's so many cosmetic approaches es
[1018.76 - 1024.80] on teeth between veneers and whitening
[1022.04 - 1026.48] strategies that people have and getting
[1024.80 - 1028.40] you know implants and so forth and
[1026.48 - 1031.08] Replacements and everything else so all
[1028.40 - 1033.20] of that is kind of like putting that old
[1031.08 - 1034.44] Decor of what happened years ago and
[1033.20 - 1036.72] yester year with
[1034.44 - 1038.44] teeth okay but if you go back and you
[1036.72 - 1041.20] see some old footage and you're just
[1038.44 - 1045.72] like everybody's smiling laughing you go
[1041.20 - 1047.72] back to an old Oscars back in the 1979
[1045.72 - 1048.96] and you see footage of like the Oscars
[1047.72 - 1050.80] in 79
[1048.96 - 1053.20] 84
[1050.80 - 1054.96] 1985 all the celebrities her teeth are
[1053.20 - 1057.40] all
[1054.96 - 1060.20] yellow that's what it was like back then
[1057.40 - 1063.56] right before what we have now out
[1060.20 - 1065.76] there but it doesn't change what's
[1063.56 - 1068.28] happening inside of the teeth it doesn't
[1065.76 - 1071.32] change what's happening inside the
[1068.28 - 1073.92] Denton it does not change what's
[1071.32 - 1077.04] happening inside the
[1073.92 - 1078.96] enamel so right now we're in the world
[1077.04 - 1080.96] just like the world of the past we're in
[1078.96 - 1082.52] the teeth destroying world the only
[1080.96 - 1084.28] difference is we're probably doing even
[1082.52 - 1085.84] more vinegar cuz we're doing more apple
[1084.28 - 1088.20] cider vinegar probably doing more
[1085.84 - 1091.40] caffeine than we ever did 20 30 40 years
[1088.20 - 1094.00] ago and decaf coffee is in the same
[1091.40 - 1096.64] league it just has a little less
[1094.00 - 1098.68] caffeine a little less caffeine and
[1096.64 - 1101.16] guess what the crazy things most decaf
[1098.68 - 1103.36] drinkers maybe not you but most decaf
[1101.16 - 1106.96] drinkers drink more of
[1103.36 - 1109.00] it they drink more of it they supersede
[1106.96 - 1111.08] someone else who has a little bit higher
[1109.00 - 1112.28] caffeine in a cup of coffee a decaf
[1111.08 - 1113.48] Drinker would be like I'm going to drink
[1112.28 - 1116.48] four
[1113.48 - 1118.36] today because I can because it's less
[1116.48 - 1120.08] caffeine so they drink four cups of
[1118.36 - 1122.40] coffee when someone else is drinking one
[1120.08 - 1124.68] to two cups a day with the higher amount
[1122.40 - 1127.36] person drinks four or five of the
[1124.68 - 1130.52] decaffinated is like surpassing the
[1127.36 - 1132.08] person with the not decaffinated right
[1130.52 - 1135.92] caffeinated right so here we go people
[1132.08 - 1138.40] drink matcha they drink tea they drink
[1135.92 - 1140.12] soda they drink energy drinks they they
[1138.40 - 1141.96] drink all those things too getting all
[1140.12 - 1144.72] the caffeine with that but
[1141.96 - 1147.16] decaf still is a problem very important
[1144.72 - 1150.32] to know I want to go into like root
[1147.16 - 1151.68] canals a little bit too in this episode
[1150.32 - 1153.44] I'm going to cook for us in a little bit
[1151.68 - 1155.48] if you guys just got here we're doing
[1153.44 - 1158.56] asparagus Sushi is what we're doing I'm
[1155.48 - 1162.32] excited about this Claudia Draper yep my
[1158.56 - 1166.92] teeth were all yellow and same with
[1162.32 - 1169.20] everyone else I knew that was the world
[1166.92 - 1172.48] of yester year
[1169.20 - 1174.88] so Amanda says that's amazing my dad is
[1172.48 - 1177.80] losing his teeth they're just falling
[1174.88 - 1182.24] apart it's like a time capsule is what
[1177.80 - 1185.76] it is it's time capsule a time capsule
[1182.24 - 1188.16] that just starts to ring the bell it's
[1185.76 - 1190.76] kind of like on the ranch everybody's
[1188.16 - 1193.28] working out there right everybody gets
[1190.76 - 1195.12] hungry it's lunchtime ding ding ding
[1193.28 - 1197.60] ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding
[1195.12 - 1199.40] ding time to eat lunch ding ding ding
[1197.60 - 1202.32] ding
[1199.40 - 1205.96] the alarm goes off and what happens over
[1202.32 - 1208.36] time the alarm goes off and the teeth
[1205.96 - 1210.24] just start falling apart different areas
[1208.36 - 1212.88] of the mouth too sometimes it's a
[1210.24 - 1216.72] certain area of the mouth versus
[1212.88 - 1219.00] another and sometimes it's everywhere in
[1216.72 - 1219.80] the mouth starts you just falling apart
[1219.00 - 1221.88] like
[1219.80 - 1224.56] crazy
[1221.88 - 1227.28] everywhere important to know so let's go
[1224.56 - 1229.72] into bacteria a little bit so that's the
[1227.28 - 1231.68] next thing we want to do
[1229.72 - 1235.52] it's okay
[1231.68 - 1237.20] bacteria you have to have bacteria to
[1235.52 - 1240.36] have a
[1237.20 - 1243.40] cavity you have to have
[1240.36 - 1246.44] bacteria to have gum
[1243.40 - 1249.92] disease you got to have
[1246.44 - 1254.48] bacteria to have you guessed it root
[1249.92 - 1256.76] canals well infected abscess
[1254.48 - 1259.20] Roots
[1256.76 - 1262.12] bacteria and at leads us to the next
[1259.20 - 1266.28] place how does bacteria somehow get down
[1262.12 - 1267.92] in there deep when there isn't cavities
[1266.28 - 1269.80] and then where when there are cavities
[1267.92 - 1272.00] and so forth but how do we get bacteria
[1269.80 - 1274.56] down there deep in the roots because of
[1272.00 - 1277.56] our immune system our immune system is
[1274.56 - 1281.04] struggling we got zinc deficiencies
[1277.56 - 1284.56] Galore zinc deficiencies are rampant all
[1281.04 - 1286.44] around the world everywhere and that's a
[1284.56 - 1289.72] problem all on its
[1286.44 - 1291.84] own our immune systems are
[1289.72 - 1294.76] compromised therefore we get in trouble
[1291.84 - 1296.12] with teeth problems the more viruses we
[1294.76 - 1299.12] have in our
[1296.12 - 1302.16] life the more
[1299.12 - 1306.60] bacteria the weaker the immune
[1302.16 - 1308.52] system autoimmune so forth neurological
[1306.60 - 1310.84] problems usually people with multiple
[1308.52 - 1313.52] sceris suffer with their teeth the most
[1310.84 - 1315.24] usually not every exact person there
[1313.52 - 1316.72] reasons why there's different situations
[1315.24 - 1318.72] versus how many heavy metals somebody
[1316.72 - 1321.32] has how many toxic heavy metals and so
[1318.72 - 1324.00] forth and different toxins with
[1321.32 - 1326.80] viruses but the point is compromised
[1324.00 - 1329.00] immune system leads to the bacteria
[1326.80 - 1331.84] frenzy in the
[1329.00 - 1335.60] mouth that's why the medical medium
[1331.84 - 1340.32] information which I proudly
[1335.60 - 1342.20] follow which at my age I have all my
[1340.32 - 1346.16] teeth and no
[1342.20 - 1349.52] problems which no implants no veneers no
[1346.16 - 1351.68] root canals you name
[1349.52 - 1355.24] it
[1351.68 - 1356.64] right the goal is like when I take care
[1355.24 - 1358.00] of myself the best I can because
[1356.64 - 1359.12] honestly I'm not perfect at taking care
[1358.00 - 1362.96] of myself at
[1359.12 - 1365.32] all but I try my best in the sense where
[1362.96 - 1368.64] I work myself to the Bone I burn the
[1365.32 - 1372.60] candle at four ends I drive myself into
[1368.64 - 1374.88] the ground I wouldn't recommend that for
[1372.60 - 1377.72] anybody it's a bad
[1374.88 - 1380.68] habit s and I started from the beginning
[1377.72 - 1382.28] so so here's the thing okay when we get
[1380.68 - 1383.88] a compromised immune system and our
[1382.28 - 1386.04] immune system gets weakened we get more
[1383.88 - 1387.80] teeth problems because we have an immune
[1386.04 - 1389.52] system that's struggling it's trying to
[1387.80 - 1391.80] fight and battle different things like
[1389.52 - 1393.64] viruses and bacteria a lot of people
[1391.80 - 1397.88] have multiple varieties of strep and
[1393.64 - 1399.80] they have viruses like hhv6 and shingles
[1397.88 - 1402.08] and Epstein bar even if they just have
[1399.80 - 1405.44] an Epstein bar that's causing problems
[1402.08 - 1408.60] their immune system cannot keep a tight
[1405.44 - 1411.28] watch on the teeth and the gum so the
[1408.60 - 1414.84] immune system cannot keep a really close
[1411.28 - 1418.24] tight watch on the gums your immune
[1414.84 - 1422.80] cells want to capture viruses and
[1418.24 - 1425.60] bacteria on the gum line inside the gums
[1422.80 - 1430.64] and behind the teeth in the
[1425.60 - 1434.68] jaw our immune system wants to capture
[1430.64 - 1436.56] Invaders pathogens viruses bacteria but
[1434.68 - 1438.56] our immune systems are usually dealing
[1436.56 - 1440.84] with other problems
[1438.56 - 1442.48] other things that we're actually having
[1440.84 - 1444.08] inside our body our immune systems
[1442.48 - 1444.88] dealing with a lot of different viruses
[1444.08 - 1447.16] and
[1444.88 - 1450.24] bacteria people who have simplex one
[1447.16 - 1452.76] Simplex 2 different varieties of epine
[1450.24 - 1455.04] bar cyega virus is a pain in the butt
[1452.76 - 1459.44] and a lot of shingles viruses these are
[1455.04 - 1462.84] the autoimmune plague that's the
[1459.44 - 1464.80] autoimmune plague aroni is all those
[1462.84 - 1467.04] different bugs and
[1464.80 - 1468.72] pathogens and so our immune system is
[1467.04 - 1470.48] really busy on trying to protect us with
[1468.72 - 1472.96] all that and at the same time our immune
[1470.48 - 1475.12] system can't go and then take care of
[1472.96 - 1477.96] the teeth and gums it can't go and take
[1475.12 - 1480.60] care of everything here it just can't
[1477.96 - 1482.92] our immune system wants to help it wants
[1480.60 - 1485.04] to take care of things but it just can't
[1482.92 - 1489.28] cover every single tooth in every part
[1485.04 - 1491.48] of your gum there's no way it can only
[1489.28 - 1494.08] get some of it at different times some
[1491.48 - 1495.48] of it at different times so taking care
[1494.08 - 1497.16] of our immune system is critical
[1495.48 - 1500.52] learning why we're sick is critical it
[1497.16 - 1502.36] protects our teeth and then if you got
[1500.52 - 1505.12] somebody who's compromised and they're
[1502.36 - 1508.08] chronically sick you guys they're also
[1505.12 - 1511.08] doing chocolate they got the caffeine
[1508.08 - 1513.08] cranking in their system chocolate wears
[1511.08 - 1514.28] away your calcium reserves chocolate's
[1513.08 - 1515.24] another thing that breaks down your
[1514.28 - 1517.36] calcium
[1515.24 - 1519.52] reserves it breaks down your immune
[1517.36 - 1522.60] system I can't tell you how many time
[1519.52 - 1525.24] over how many times over the years
[1522.60 - 1527.32] helping out people all these decades did
[1525.24 - 1531.32] I see when someone went on a chocolate
[1527.32 - 1534.64] bin they broke out a week later with a
[1531.32 - 1537.76] Simplex cold sore fever blister
[1534.64 - 1540.24] chocolate binge fever blister if they
[1537.76 - 1543.00] didn't have herpy simplex one chocolate
[1540.24 - 1544.60] binge Simplex 2 if if that's what they
[1543.00 - 1547.84] had
[1544.60 - 1552.44] PS in the genitals area right if they
[1547.84 - 1555.44] didn't have that chocolate binge okay so
[1552.44 - 1559.56] chocolate binge and
[1555.44 - 1561.88] then a a flare for Epstein bar chocolate
[1559.56 - 1563.32] binge and then a new bout of mono
[1561.88 - 1567.44] chocolate
[1563.32 - 1569.56] binge and then an abscess in the tooth
[1567.44 - 1571.72] jaw starts to
[1569.56 - 1575.60] hurt chocolate
[1571.72 - 1578.16] binge and then catching an STD
[1575.60 - 1580.28] easily when they probably wouldn't have
[1578.16 - 1583.52] really caught it cuz their immune system
[1580.28 - 1585.96] would have pulverized Gara would have
[1583.52 - 1588.28] pulverized the clap would have
[1585.96 - 1589.52] pulverized it there means system didn't
[1588.28 - 1592.28] pulverize
[1589.52 - 1594.92] it so now they got
[1592.28 - 1596.88] chlamidia they got chlamydia and their
[1594.92 - 1598.84] immune system can't keep up with the
[1596.88 - 1600.60] chlamydia they just contracted in a
[1598.84 - 1603.20] relationship because their immune
[1600.60 - 1606.28] systems bombarded by chocolate binge and
[1603.20 - 1610.44] stuff like that and other
[1606.28 - 1614.20] things the point is is that our immune
[1610.44 - 1616.56] system can only do so much when we tip
[1614.20 - 1618.28] the scale and death by a Thousand Cuts
[1616.56 - 1619.76] and we push things over The Edge it's
[1618.28 - 1622.68] not our fault it's nobody's fault it's a
[1619.76 - 1622.68] hard World hard
[1624.20 - 1628.48] life but there's a real reason why
[1626.76 - 1630.40] people's teeth just start falling apart
[1628.48 - 1632.00] over time we have a lot of compromises
[1630.40 - 1634.88] our immune system is actually looking
[1632.00 - 1636.88] out for so let's go into root canals a
[1634.88 - 1639.80] touch
[1636.88 - 1643.16] vegans are in the
[1639.80 - 1646.52] dentist but so are animal protein people
[1643.16 - 1649.60] if I hear one more
[1646.52 - 1653.52] time that a vegan is going to be in the
[1649.60 - 1656.00] dentist chair more that vegans need
[1653.52 - 1660.04] dental work
[1656.00 - 1662.96] more the next live we do I'm GNA ask
[1660.04 - 1665.64] Samantha the the
[1662.96 - 1668.40] dietician to come on and talk about that
[1665.64 - 1670.72] topic the next time we're live I'm going
[1668.40 - 1672.92] to have Samantha come on you guys know
[1670.72 - 1674.72] you guys just met Samantha recently
[1672.92 - 1678.08] she's going to come on and talk about
[1674.72 - 1681.36] that like vegans and
[1678.08 - 1681.36] dentist chairs and stuff like
[1682.60 - 1689.88] that you know why people go vegan and go
[1686.84 - 1692.72] plant-based because they got sick
[1689.88 - 1695.56] outside of a handful of hippies that are
[1692.72 - 1696.92] trying to protect animals which I
[1695.56 - 1699.88] believe
[1696.92 - 1701.80] in I believe in
[1699.88 - 1705.36] immensely
[1701.80 - 1708.20] outside of a few people that don't want
[1705.36 - 1709.40] to actually drink C's milk because of
[1708.20 - 1712.12] you know they're worried about the abuse
[1709.40 - 1714.04] on the cow don't eat meat cuz they don't
[1712.12 - 1715.36] want to kill the cow cuz cow has a soul
[1714.04 - 1718.36] we know that right and this isn't a
[1715.36 - 1720.56] vegan Channel propaganda or animal
[1718.36 - 1723.20] protein Channel propaganda I'm trying to
[1720.56 - 1725.64] say something really important here
[1723.20 - 1730.00] outside of a few vegans that decided to
[1725.64 - 1730.00] go vegan because of a certain
[1730.28 - 1735.28] belief outside of that vegans go vegan
[1733.88 - 1738.80] because something's wrong with their
[1735.28 - 1741.20] health and they get sick that's what
[1738.80 - 1744.36] happens plant-based people go
[1741.20 - 1746.64] plant-based because they get
[1744.36 - 1749.96] sick
[1746.64 - 1753.08] fact and
[1749.96 - 1755.72] Truth vegans go vegan plantbased people
[1753.08 - 1758.56] go macrobiotic people went macrobiotic
[1755.72 - 1761.40] years ago because they got
[1758.56 - 1764.08] sick pescatarians went pescatarian
[1761.40 - 1764.08] because they got
[1764.52 - 1771.28] sick what it means is if vegans are more
[1768.32 - 1773.48] deficient and end up in a dentist chair
[1771.28 - 1775.48] they were sick to be they were sick
[1773.48 - 1777.92] animal protein
[1775.48 - 1779.80] eaters doesn't mean animal animal
[1777.92 - 1781.56] protein caused them to be sick they were
[1779.80 - 1783.96] sick Pro animal protein eaters and this
[1781.56 - 1786.04] is this is a Nuance it doesn't mean the
[1783.96 - 1788.80] animal protein caused them to be sick
[1786.04 - 1791.44] it's not what I'm trying to say I'm
[1788.80 - 1793.32] saying they were already sick and they
[1791.44 - 1795.00] were already sick animal protein eaters
[1793.32 - 1797.84] they were already sick Animal product
[1795.00 - 1800.76] eaters and they became vegan
[1797.84 - 1804.32] vegetarian macrobiotic pescatarian
[1800.76 - 1807.24] eating a few fish whatever it
[1804.32 - 1810.20] is they became these things because
[1807.24 - 1812.84] something was wrong something was wrong
[1810.20 - 1815.28] unless it's some like hippie dude that's
[1812.84 - 1817.56] like no killing animals is wrong I will
[1815.28 - 1819.16] not I will eat soy and everything else
[1817.56 - 1822.84] I'm going to be vegan unless it's
[1819.16 - 1824.60] somebody like that everybody's going to
[1822.84 - 1826.24] a different diet like that because
[1824.60 - 1829.92] they're not
[1826.24 - 1832.80] well and the bottom line is everybody's
[1829.92 - 1834.84] in the dental chair everybody's at the
[1832.80 - 1836.84] dentist office everybody's getting
[1834.84 - 1838.72] drilled everybody has a problem with
[1836.84 - 1841.52] their teeth at one time or another one
[1838.72 - 1844.04] way or another and the roots of the
[1841.52 - 1845.60] teeth problems or mineral deficiencies
[1844.04 - 1847.76] that I'm talking about like the Calcium
[1845.60 - 1849.32] deficiency from it being leaked from our
[1847.76 - 1852.00] bones and
[1849.32 - 1853.84] teeth along with coming into this world
[1852.00 - 1856.96] with immune system issues and
[1853.84 - 1859.36] deficiencies Along With viral issues to
[1856.96 - 1861.96] like pathogens and so forth along with
[1859.36 - 1864.44] toxic heavy metals Mercury is like the
[1861.96 - 1866.76] teeth Destroyer I'm not talking about
[1864.44 - 1869.28] just Mercury amalgams I'm talking about
[1866.76 - 1871.68] Mercury in our body in our bloodstream
[1869.28 - 1873.52] or Mercury in our organs and not even in
[1871.68 - 1875.56] our bloodstream Mercury and our organs
[1873.52 - 1877.04] which is a medical medium piece of
[1875.56 - 1879.32] information all on its
[1877.04 - 1880.76] own Mercury actually in organs
[1879.32 - 1882.76] undetected that's medical medium
[1880.76 - 1884.52] originally and then Mercury in our bones
[1882.76 - 1886.16] which is which is medical medium to
[1884.52 - 1888.00] information I have to say that because
[1886.16 - 1892.08] you be like oh I heard that before it
[1888.00 - 1894.08] comes from mm info so you know where the
[1892.08 - 1895.64] source is but the bottom line is you
[1894.08 - 1899.40] guys I'm trying to say
[1895.64 - 1901.64] something something that's really really
[1899.40 - 1902.96] important is that there are so many
[1901.64 - 1904.76] different angles we can do to protect
[1902.96 - 1907.16] your teeth down from the basic First
[1904.76 - 1909.16] Fundamental options right down to going
[1907.16 - 1910.76] as far as we want to protect our teeth
[1909.16 - 1913.32] and the first thing I would tell anybody
[1910.76 - 1915.32] right off the running hey a w I want to
[1913.32 - 1917.00] I want to keep my teeth I want I don't
[1915.32 - 1918.84] want teeth problems every minute I want
[1917.00 - 1923.00] my my teeth would be okay boom vinegar
[1918.84 - 1928.28] gone boom chocolate boom gone
[1923.00 - 1930.60] woo just gone coffee Bing
[1928.28 - 1932.08] gone that's just a few things right off
[1930.60 - 1933.52] the running then I would go even deeper
[1932.08 - 1937.12] than
[1933.52 - 1938.24] that deeper than that eggs boom gone
[1937.12 - 1939.64] because the eggs are going to feed all
[1938.24 - 1941.56] the viruses in your body and that's
[1939.64 - 1943.20] going to compromise your immune system
[1941.56 - 1945.32] and when that compromises your immune
[1943.20 - 1947.40] system who's going to be watching over
[1945.32 - 1948.92] your teeth and that's another thing oh
[1947.40 - 1950.48] and its own I was talking about before
[1948.92 - 1953.08] who is going to be watching over your
[1950.48 - 1956.20] teeth when your body your immune system
[1953.08 - 1958.52] is watching over
[1956.20 - 1962.12] pathogens pathogens that are feeding off
[1958.52 - 1964.36] of eggs and dairy products and
[1962.12 - 1965.40] gluten next thing IID tell people is get
[1964.36 - 1967.40] rid of the
[1965.40 - 1968.96] gluten not because the person's
[1967.40 - 1970.76] sensitive or not to gluten that's not
[1968.96 - 1973.16] what it would be no you want teeth
[1970.76 - 1975.36] problems to be gone someday or you want
[1973.16 - 1977.64] them slowed down and you want them
[1975.36 - 1979.96] halted you also get rid rid of gluten
[1977.64 - 1983.44] too cuz gluten is going to feed bacteria
[1979.96 - 1987.84] guess what that bacteria that sits in
[1983.44 - 1991.68] there eating away your root in your
[1987.84 - 1994.40] teeth feeds off of
[1991.68 - 1997.76] gluten so there's your root right there
[1994.40 - 1999.12] you see it you guys see your root we're
[1997.76 - 2002.40] going to do we're going to do a
[1999.12 - 2004.72] procedure right here hi I'm I'm the
[2002.40 - 2007.56] dentist here uh I'm filling in for your
[2004.72 - 2009.88] dentist yeah I'm here I'm a
[2007.56 - 2012.12] yeah I'm only here for a day say take a
[2009.88 - 2015.52] seat I'm going to cut this root right
[2012.12 - 2015.52] out here for
[2015.60 - 2023.28] you anyway the point is is those roots
[2019.20 - 2027.16] right there that people get bacteria in
[2023.28 - 2030.28] and around love to feed off of gluten
[2027.16 - 2032.24] love to feed off of gluten these are
[2030.28 - 2034.36] just some of the really powerful tidbits
[2032.24 - 2035.96] to actually show you guys a lot of
[2034.36 - 2038.40] people get
[2035.96 - 2041.04] staining with their
[2038.40 - 2045.36] enamel it's not just their enamel
[2041.04 - 2047.56] wearing down but they get stained right
[2045.36 - 2052.64] like I said 20 30 40 years ago
[2047.56 - 2056.96] everybody's teeth were yellow just
[2052.64 - 2061.00] yellow college kids their teeth were
[2056.96 - 2065.44] yellow high school kids their teeth were
[2061.00 - 2068.84] yellow it's rare you ever ever ever will
[2065.44 - 2071.44] know college student with yellow teeth
[2068.84 - 2074.28] anymore I'm sure there's some but it's
[2071.44 - 2076.36] rare they'll go to their dentist they'll
[2074.28 - 2078.36] do whatever it takes to make
[2076.36 - 2080.24] sure right they'll use whatever
[2078.36 - 2084.44] procedures they possibly can that did
[2080.24 - 2087.28] not exist before back in the 80s and
[2084.44 - 2089.20] 90s but yeah everybody's teeth get
[2087.28 - 2091.24] stained as well from all their different
[2089.20 - 2092.64] habits and then smoking that's another I
[2091.24 - 2095.64] got to tell you something interesting
[2092.64 - 2095.64] right
[2095.88 - 2101.60] so what are the top three things that
[2099.28 - 2103.44] cause dental
[2101.60 - 2104.68] problems like you'll hear out there
[2103.44 - 2107.12] there was a dentist out there pretty
[2104.68 - 2110.76] recently it was just like well tearing
[2107.12 - 2114.32] open envelopes with your
[2110.76 - 2115.96] teeth tearing open EV envelopes the
[2114.32 - 2118.24] dentist didn't say about calcium
[2115.96 - 2120.96] depletion because of vinegar the dentist
[2118.24 - 2121.92] didn't say anything about minerals Trace
[2120.96 - 2124.28] mineral
[2121.92 - 2125.72] deficiencies zinc deficiencies the
[2124.28 - 2127.48] dentist didn't say anything about
[2125.72 - 2131.12] pathogens and viruses the dentist is
[2127.48 - 2135.24] like tearing open envelopes with your
[2131.12 - 2137.20] teeth so doing that that's like tearing
[2135.24 - 2139.92] open envelopes that's a really good one
[2137.20 - 2143.84] right there it's like it's like um I am
[2139.92 - 2145.40] a dentist the top the top three the top
[2143.84 - 2149.40] five things you should avoid with your
[2145.40 - 2153.04] teeth one is try not to tear open open
[2149.40 - 2157.28] the envelopes you're going to ruin your
[2153.04 - 2160.24] teeth the second one is don't pop open B
[2157.28 - 2162.40] bottles with your teeth try not to pop
[2160.24 - 2166.40] open lids and Bottles your teeth I swear
[2162.40 - 2168.84] to God I swear to God that's the advice
[2166.40 - 2170.56] out there try not to break open bottles
[2168.84 - 2173.28] with your teeth yeah cuz that's
[2170.56 - 2174.88] something I do every day you guys break
[2173.28 - 2176.40] open bottles at your teeth bottle caps
[2174.88 - 2178.16] all day long is that what you guys do
[2176.40 - 2179.88] you do that every day do you tear open
[2178.16 - 2181.48] envelopes every day with your teeth how
[2179.88 - 2184.64] many of you guys tear envelopes open I'm
[2181.48 - 2188.72] sure somebody does but it's like the top
[2184.64 - 2188.72] reasons that's not good for your teeth
[2190.48 - 2192.64] all
[2195.36 - 2203.12] right it's obviously not good for you to
[2197.96 - 2206.60] pop open a bottle cap off a a beer
[2203.12 - 2209.08] bottle with your teeth or a soda pop
[2206.60 - 2212.32] bottle and it's not really smart to
[2209.08 - 2215.48] actually open up a can a bear
[2212.32 - 2217.60] can a bear can with your teeth and try
[2215.48 - 2220.68] to rip it open
[2217.60 - 2222.48] and it's not smart to tear open
[2220.68 - 2225.80] envelopes or anything else with your
[2222.48 - 2227.52] teeth it's a duh it's a duh but what
[2225.80 - 2229.16] about the real reasons why people's
[2227.52 - 2232.48] teeth are falling
[2229.16 - 2235.32] out if I hear another time out there
[2232.48 - 2237.00] that it's because of being vegan and
[2235.32 - 2241.52] your teeth fall apart because you're
[2237.00 - 2243.84] vegan that is so grossly
[2241.52 - 2247.36] mistaken not only are vegans in the
[2243.84 - 2251.92] dental chairs the dentist office so is
[2247.36 - 2254.08] every single animal protein eater that's
[2251.92 - 2257.52] a major
[2254.08 - 2259.32] ignorance that is a major cross theboard
[2257.52 - 2261.84] ignorance to actually think that
[2259.32 - 2265.00] plant-based people or a vegan ends up in
[2261.84 - 2267.04] a dental chair more than a meat eater
[2265.00 - 2268.64] probably the dumbest thing I've heard
[2267.04 - 2272.88] out there it's ignorance
[2268.64 - 2275.60] pure it's sad but it's said constantly
[2272.88 - 2278.56] out there over and over and over again
[2275.60 - 2281.92] everybody everybody is getting their
[2278.56 - 2286.20] teeth drilled and if they haven't
[2281.92 - 2289.24] already they're going to because even if
[2286.20 - 2290.84] someone seems indestructible they're
[2289.24 - 2293.40] exercising they look like they're in
[2290.84 - 2294.92] great shape they got it they're young
[2293.40 - 2296.48] their teeth look good they're getting
[2294.92 - 2299.16] they're going to their dentist I got all
[2296.48 - 2302.40] my original teeth I'm 22 years old I'm
[2299.16 - 2304.28] exercising I'm doing good uh it's all
[2302.40 - 2306.12] going to fall apart later even if it
[2304.28 - 2308.52] takes to their 39 years old and it just
[2306.12 - 2310.16] starts to fall apart and crumble all
[2308.52 - 2311.44] then fraction of the people on the
[2310.16 - 2314.04] planet are vegan by the way or
[2311.44 - 2318.92] plant-based a fraction it's a grain of
[2314.04 - 2322.84] rice to a silo of rice a grain of rice
[2318.92 - 2325.80] to a silo of rice meaning the grain of
[2322.84 - 2328.48] rice is the vegan and The Silo of rice
[2325.80 - 2330.60] are the Animal product
[2328.48 - 2332.12] eaters and the reason why they're vegan
[2330.60 - 2334.80] to begin with is because they have
[2332.12 - 2336.64] symptoms and conditions in most cases
[2334.80 - 2339.04] except for that random person that's
[2336.64 - 2340.60] like you know what they're chopping down
[2339.04 - 2342.56] the
[2340.60 - 2345.24] rainforest they're doing all kinds of
[2342.56 - 2347.24] stuff and I want to be vegan Jasmine
[2345.24 - 2350.96] over there on YouTube says my teeth are
[2347.24 - 2353.88] falling apart and I'm only 23 I had
[2350.96 - 2356.64] cavities on almost all of my teeth by
[2353.88 - 2358.92] the time I was 20 I got them all done
[2356.64 - 2361.44] but now they're back
[2358.92 - 2363.44] again I've seen this happen a lot over
[2361.44 - 2365.24] the years with a lot of young people we
[2363.44 - 2367.28] come into the world with a little bit
[2365.24 - 2368.96] higher elevations of mercury into toxic
[2367.28 - 2370.88] heavy metals I mean ask your dentist
[2368.96 - 2374.44] what's right for you ask him what you
[2370.88 - 2376.76] know he thinks but what I've said about
[2374.44 - 2379.12] younger Generations having teeth
[2376.76 - 2381.24] problems there's either immune system
[2379.12 - 2383.36] issues where they're battling some
[2381.24 - 2385.12] lowgrade pathogenic infections that
[2383.36 - 2387.96] happens a lot they have an elevated
[2385.12 - 2390.60] toxic heavy metal Reserve inside organs
[2387.96 - 2392.20] that happens a lot too and they're Trace
[2390.60 - 2395.72] mineral
[2392.20 - 2397.00] deficient and they're extremely acidic
[2395.72 - 2399.68] or
[2397.00 - 2400.96] it didn't take well like the vinegar and
[2399.68 - 2403.20] all the different things that they've
[2400.96 - 2405.84] been actually eating in their foods from
[2403.20 - 2407.84] meals out from eating out from when they
[2405.84 - 2409.96] were like 5 6 7even years old of the
[2407.84 - 2412.72] family and 10 years old and 15 years old
[2409.96 - 2414.40] and you know and so forth and it was
[2412.72 - 2416.72] just you know restaurant food's a big
[2414.40 - 2418.40] one right there for actually taking
[2416.72 - 2420.12] people out you can be somebody that's
[2418.40 - 2422.20] plant-based and you're in the finest
[2420.12 - 2424.80] plantbased restaurant you're in Europe
[2422.20 - 2427.24] and you found this wicked bitching cool
[2424.80 - 2429.44] plant-based restaurant and you're in
[2427.24 - 2431.40] there and you're having vinegar and
[2429.44 - 2434.64] everything else another thing is
[2431.40 - 2437.32] fluoride treatments it is by far one of
[2434.64 - 2439.12] the teeth destroyers of all is fluoride
[2437.32 - 2441.24] treatments something that people don't
[2439.12 - 2444.04] realize right is when they get a
[2441.24 - 2446.32] fluoride treatment in the past it causes
[2444.04 - 2448.48] damage in the future so a lot of
[2446.32 - 2449.84] children get their fluoride treatments
[2448.48 - 2452.00] and that fluoride treatment when you're
[2449.84 - 2453.24] 8 years old 9 years old 10 years old
[2452.00 - 2456.12] means you're going to have teeth
[2453.24 - 2458.20] problems when you're 20 25 30 and so
[2456.12 - 2461.12] forth forth so fluoride treatments is a
[2458.20 - 2465.32] big deal that's another one that eats
[2461.12 - 2467.84] away at the enamel and also affects the
[2465.32 - 2469.76] teeth from the inside out is
[2467.84 - 2470.96] fluoride going to start cooking in a
[2469.76 - 2474.52] minute you guys we're covering some
[2470.96 - 2476.24] teeth stuff on its own healing single
[2474.52 - 2478.36] over there in IG says I have a broken
[2476.24 - 2481.68] tooth my dentist wants to pull and
[2478.36 - 2485.24] replace with an implant I wonder if it's
[2481.68 - 2487.48] worth it since tooth the tooth is in the
[2485.24 - 2490.08] back
[2487.48 - 2491.76] so I mean it look it all depends on what
[2490.08 - 2493.76] your dentist wants to do if I ever had a
[2491.76 - 2498.52] broken tooth in the
[2493.76 - 2501.88] back you know I would I would avoid the
[2498.52 - 2504.56] implant I would avoid it and try to seek
[2501.88 - 2507.84] out every option possible also would
[2504.56 - 2509.68] seek out a see a few different dentists
[2507.84 - 2512.28] about the same topic that's what I would
[2509.68 - 2514.12] do I'd go to this dentist I'd go to that
[2512.28 - 2515.72] dentist I'd say okay what do you think
[2514.12 - 2518.96] do I need to just do is there another
[2515.72 - 2521.48] route I can do is it possible to fill it
[2518.96 - 2524.60] is the tooth cracked all the way
[2521.48 - 2526.60] through a root canal won't work a crown
[2524.60 - 2528.32] won't be sufficient do I just need an
[2526.60 - 2529.84] implant or I just pull the tooth these
[2528.32 - 2532.32] are all questions that you have to kind
[2529.84 - 2533.92] of obviously go along with with your
[2532.32 - 2536.16] your
[2533.92 - 2537.60] dentist or do you want to just pull the
[2536.16 - 2538.92] tooth and let it heal up and you're
[2537.60 - 2540.60] missing a tooth because you don't want
[2538.92 - 2542.48] to implant so many things you know
[2540.60 - 2545.00] there's so many options Divine Light
[2542.48 - 2546.88] says Anthony what does Spirit say is it
[2545.00 - 2549.52] okay to not go do anything anything to
[2546.88 - 2551.88] cavities should we always go get them
[2549.52 - 2553.28] fixed or is it fine to let them be the
[2551.88 - 2556.20] only thing
[2553.28 - 2557.96] is if you're battling pathogens your
[2556.20 - 2561.04] immune system's compromised you got
[2557.96 - 2563.92] bacteria in the mouth that's lit it's
[2561.04 - 2567.00] lit right and that bacteria is working
[2563.92 - 2568.12] on your teeth okay and you're taking
[2567.00 - 2570.20] care of yourself and you're trying to
[2568.12 - 2571.16] fix other problems it's hard sometimes
[2570.20 - 2574.56] to get the
[2571.16 - 2575.76] teeth up to par fast enough so you got
[2574.56 - 2577.12] to keep an eye on the cavities that's
[2575.76 - 2579.60] what I would do to keep an eye on them
[2577.12 - 2582.76] if they start they start doing more they
[2579.60 - 2584.32] start getting away from us then that's
[2582.76 - 2586.40] another story so you might want to keep
[2584.32 - 2587.88] on it that way but if it doesn't look
[2586.40 - 2590.64] like it's getting away from us that's
[2587.88 - 2591.96] another story I mean I have friends that
[2590.64 - 2593.04] they have cavities and stuff and they
[2591.96 - 2595.16] don't do anything with them because
[2593.04 - 2596.68] you're not getting away from them but
[2595.16 - 2598.16] there's different ways of handling it as
[2596.68 - 2599.48] you're building up your immune system as
[2598.16 - 2602.00] you're cleaning things out as you're
[2599.48 - 2603.48] avoiding all the bad stuff and the
[2602.00 - 2604.96] vinegars and everything else you're
[2603.48 - 2607.72] building up your calcium reserves in
[2604.96 - 2609.64] your teeth you're doing all that
[2607.72 - 2611.80] cavities start going away for a lot of
[2609.64 - 2613.40] people what I've noticed medical mem
[2611.80 - 2615.20] information I've seen over the years so
[2613.40 - 2616.64] many people get rid of cavities your
[2615.20 - 2619.16] cavities just healed right up in their
[2616.64 - 2621.28] mouths I have friends where they did mm
[2619.16 - 2623.72] really good like you know there's people
[2621.28 - 2625.44] that do mm there's people that do mm
[2623.72 - 2627.92] there people that do a little bit of mm
[2625.44 - 2629.96] fly on the wall you know like fly on the
[2627.92 - 2631.48] wall and you're like whoa why is that
[2629.96 - 2633.36] person doing this whoa why is that
[2631.48 - 2635.16] person doing Zite that'll really mess
[2633.36 - 2637.12] them up why is that person doing that
[2635.16 - 2638.60] why is the person doing dite clay that's
[2637.12 - 2640.28] not going to be good for them why is
[2638.60 - 2641.56] that person doing Pearl powder that's
[2640.28 - 2643.08] going to really rip their intestinal
[2641.56 - 2644.88] track apart so it's like you're seeing
[2643.08 - 2646.96] all the things they're doing why is that
[2644.88 - 2649.88] person doing sodium bicarbonate why is
[2646.96 - 2652.24] that person taking so much like crappy
[2649.88 - 2654.44] powders that have all these agents in
[2652.24 - 2656.16] them like you see all these things and
[2654.44 - 2658.44] why is that person eating this why are
[2656.16 - 2660.24] they eating that and then you know you
[2658.44 - 2662.88] know you know as all that's happening in
[2660.24 - 2664.12] there and they having all these problems
[2662.88 - 2665.40] problems are going to develop and
[2664.12 - 2667.76] everything but then there's people who
[2665.40 - 2669.16] do who and they'll do a little bit of mm
[2667.76 - 2670.96] they'll do some celery juice to do a
[2669.16 - 2672.72] little of this maybe do the heavy metal
[2670.96 - 2675.32] detox once in a while but they don't
[2672.72 - 2677.48] really do mm a lot they don't do a lot
[2675.32 - 2680.48] of mm their teeth start falling apart
[2677.48 - 2682.80] later and the easiest claim is like it's
[2680.48 - 2684.44] got to be mm that did it it's got to be
[2682.80 - 2687.72] that celery juice meanwhile what they
[2684.44 - 2690.48] were doing and what they had going on
[2687.72 - 2692.28] was like whoa that's not mm oh that's
[2690.48 - 2693.76] not mm you walk into their house and you
[2692.28 - 2695.96] go through their cupboards and you're
[2693.76 - 2698.12] like that's not mm that's not mm that's
[2695.96 - 2699.84] that's got natural flavors no way that
[2698.12 - 2701.44] stuff is terrible for the gut that
[2699.84 - 2702.84] stuff's bad for your immune system it's
[2701.44 - 2704.16] just you wouldn't believe what you would
[2702.84 - 2706.68] see in people's
[2704.16 - 2709.12] houses and then someone who's doing
[2706.68 - 2711.04] really good solid mm and they're working
[2709.12 - 2712.00] hard man they freaking cavities healing
[2711.04 - 2714.16] so many
[2712.00 - 2717.00] people a lot of people are not eating
[2714.16 - 2718.80] enough greens and mm is about getting
[2717.00 - 2720.24] the spinach soup in you that 28 day
[2718.80 - 2722.60] cleanse spinach soup one of those
[2720.24 - 2724.72] incredible spinach soups medical medium
[2722.60 - 2726.52] not eating enough greens not a lot of
[2724.72 - 2728.16] people stay low fat enough they're
[2726.52 - 2729.76] eating so much fats bacteria is
[2728.16 - 2733.12] proliferating let's go into that real
[2729.76 - 2735.76] quick that's a good one
[2733.12 - 2737.92] okay all right stomach and ol liver
[2735.76 - 2741.24] right here in my
[2737.92 - 2742.64] hand right A lot of people are eating so
[2741.24 - 2745.68] much fat they're blowing out their
[2742.64 - 2747.60] livers high fat diets every single day
[2745.68 - 2750.08] they can't stay away from the fat they
[2747.60 - 2751.36] can't even back it down a little bit
[2750.08 - 2752.68] even if they're like intermittent
[2751.36 - 2754.76] fasting or something like that which
[2752.68 - 2756.68] isn't medical medium even if they're
[2754.76 - 2758.68] intermittent fasting and by the end of
[2756.68 - 2761.92] the day they eat one meal they blow it
[2758.68 - 2766.40] out usually with a lot of fat so many
[2761.92 - 2769.64] people cheese butter eggs meat chicken
[2766.40 - 2771.72] too much avocado too much too much nuts
[2769.64 - 2774.16] too much seeds too much though too much
[2771.72 - 2775.96] chocolate too many oils and they're just
[2774.16 - 2779.24] blowing too much oil and they're blowing
[2775.96 - 2781.12] out their liver and their their stomach
[2779.24 - 2783.52] right and when they're when they're
[2781.12 - 2785.20] dealing with that what happens is their
[2783.52 - 2787.04] immune system can't keep track of the
[2785.20 - 2789.76] bacteria
[2787.04 - 2791.92] the bacteria starts to get out of
[2789.76 - 2793.48] control and when that bacteria starts
[2791.92 - 2795.68] getting out of control we get gum
[2793.48 - 2798.36] problems we get you know abscesses we
[2795.68 - 2800.20] get teeth problems we get all kinds of
[2798.36 - 2803.48] issues with
[2800.20 - 2805.96] cavities you can't control the bacteria
[2803.48 - 2808.72] in your mouth that's sitting on a cavity
[2805.96 - 2811.56] or creating a cavity should I
[2808.72 - 2813.16] say when we're dumping in so much fat in
[2811.56 - 2815.28] our diet so there's a lot of people that
[2813.16 - 2816.84] do medical medium to some degree but
[2815.28 - 2818.68] they still pound the fats because they
[2816.84 - 2820.28] go somewhere else and they hear fats are
[2818.68 - 2821.68] so good for you you should be on lots of
[2820.28 - 2824.48] fats and now they're on lots of fats but
[2821.68 - 2826.04] they still like medical medium stuff and
[2824.48 - 2827.60] then there's people that are just like
[2826.04 - 2829.48] they're just they're dabbling in medical
[2827.60 - 2831.44] medium but their teeth just start over
[2829.48 - 2834.48] the years falling apart but they love
[2831.44 - 2837.24] the medical medium stuff they might like
[2834.48 - 2839.84] what I do and they're just like my teeth
[2837.24 - 2844.32] aw and it's like dude you've been
[2839.84 - 2846.80] killing it high fat for months and years
[2844.32 - 2849.36] you had like one loow fat
[2846.80 - 2850.88] week you've had like you're not doing
[2849.36 - 2853.28] leafy greens you're not doing the
[2850.88 - 2855.08] spinach soups you're not staying really
[2853.28 - 2856.92] strong on the celery and you're not
[2855.08 - 2858.88] doing any of the supplemental protocols
[2856.92 - 2860.72] with the right stuff and yeah of course
[2858.88 - 2861.84] something might go wrong in tip because
[2860.72 - 2863.68] you're bringing all this you're still
[2861.84 - 2865.60] eating chocolate you're still doing your
[2863.68 - 2867.84] Apple CER vinegar and you're still doing
[2865.60 - 2871.32] whatever it's just really really
[2867.84 - 2872.84] difficult not judging anybody at all I'm
[2871.32 - 2875.12] happy you're here and if you even drink
[2872.84 - 2877.40] a sip of celery juice God bless you and
[2875.12 - 2879.52] be here that's great if you want to

[2885.48 - 2889.96] just doing one little thing I'm happy
[2888.24 - 2892.92] Ivon says for the past three and a half
[2889.96 - 2895.00] years my teeth are more luminous with
[2892.92 - 2896.92] medical Med protocols which happens when
[2895.00 - 2899.84] you're
[2896.92 - 2901.80] solid with you know JS says dentists
[2899.84 - 2905.20] always talk about how strong my teeth
[2901.80 - 2907.28] are boom I know it's thanks to celery
[2905.20 - 2909.04] juice lemon water lemon water is
[2907.28 - 2912.28] incredible for the teeth in all the
[2909.04 - 2914.76] fruits and veggies thank God for mm info
[2912.28 - 2916.64] this is a lime right
[2914.76 - 2919.92] here but
[2916.64 - 2921.48] lemons and limes lemons are amazing for
[2919.92 - 2923.72] the teeth when you hear dentists or
[2921.48 - 2926.88] anybody say it's a lemon water don't do
[2923.72 - 2929.08] lemon water who and
[2926.88 - 2930.56] what is that why everybody has teeth
[2929.08 - 2931.96] problems it's lemons because you know
[2930.56 - 2934.76] I'm scratching my head here and I'm like
[2931.96 - 2936.68] nobody eats lemons how much lemon is in
[2934.76 - 2938.48] their diet
[2936.68 - 2940.48] that's insane people have been in

[3457.96 - 3463.00] remind you guys because it happens all
[3460.40 - 3465.56] the time out there you do it this way
[3463.00 - 3467.12] the the knife naturally flips up like
[3465.56 - 3469.48] this when you're doing it that way and

[3469.48 - 3473.00] got garlic under here you're going to go
[3470.76 - 3473.00] like
[3473.16 - 3476.80] this boom
[3476.88 - 3482.16] ah bad you got to have it go out very
[3480.32 - 3484.92] important beatric
[3482.16 - 3486.68] says that some people get problems with
[3484.92 - 3488.72] their teeth with the medical medum diet
[3486.68 - 3490.80] and others have great teeth could it be
[3488.72 - 3492.80] due to the quality of the teeth when
[3490.80 - 3493.88] they were formed while lying in the
[3492.80 - 3496.96] mother's
[3493.88 - 3498.28] womb well first of all you don't know
[3496.96 - 3499.60] what they're actually doing a lot of
[3498.28 - 3501.80] people do medical Medium say they do
[3499.60 - 3503.68] medical medium and they really weren't
[3501.80 - 3506.16] doing a lot of medical medium they were
[3503.68 - 3507.76] doing teeth destroy in their diet they
[3506.16 - 3509.32] had a lot of teeth destroyers in their
[3507.76 - 3510.88] diet they had a lot of mineral
[3509.32 - 3513.16] deficiency problems because of what
[3510.88 - 3514.60] they're eating and doing they had a lot
[3513.16 - 3516.48] you know a lot of other problems going
[3514.60 - 3519.32] on that we covered in this whole episode
[3516.48 - 3522.08] keep that in mind so it's it's hard to
[3519.32 - 3523.68] say because I've heard people say
[3522.08 - 3527.40] they've done medical medium it's caused
[3523.68 - 3529.40] teeth problems and I know for a fact
[3527.40 - 3531.68] through
[3529.40 - 3536.72] evidence that they weren't doing medical
[3531.68 - 3536.72] media breaks my heart
[3541.00 - 3546.68] they were dabbling in medical
[3543.36 - 3550.28] medium they were dabbling in medical
[3546.68 - 3552.08] medium I'm not judging anybody for
[3550.28 - 3555.52] dabbling in medical
[3552.08 - 3561.00] medium I'm happy to have dabblers here I
[3555.52 - 3563.88] want dabblers here just try not to blame
[3561.00 - 3565.60] the wrong thing because you're a dabbler
[3563.88 - 3568.04] please if you
[3565.60 - 3570.12] in and it depends on the past what they
[3568.04 - 3572.52] were doing what they were eating teeth
[3570.12 - 3576.24] are like time capsules I just actually I
[3572.52 - 3578.84] was telling you guys they're time
[3576.24 - 3582.20] capsules is what they're are keep in
[3578.84 - 3586.16] mind that's very important to
[3582.20 - 3590.84] know okay
[3586.16 - 3595.04] teeth tell a story a story of the
[3590.84 - 3600.36] past coffee green tea energy drink
[3595.04 - 3604.12] drinks chocolate vinegar eggs dairy
[3600.36 - 3606.04] products teeth tell a story of the past
[3604.12 - 3608.68] and then you come and you do medical
[3606.04 - 3610.80] medium but you have the baggage of the
[3608.68 - 3614.16] past and your teeth for the last 20
[3610.80 - 3616.84] years were're already becoming weakened
[3614.16 - 3618.84] internally inside out yes and also in
[3616.84 - 3621.88] the womb too some people come into this
[3618.84 - 3626.56] world very deficient high in mercury and
[3621.88 - 3626.56] the teeth have problems automatically
[3628.84 - 3634.16] okay so what I'm doing here is I have
[3631.40 - 3637.64] sauteed onions if you want to take a
[3634.16 - 3640.12] look sauteed garlic in the pan let's
[3637.64 - 3641.32] keep that going a little bit more and
[3640.12 - 3644.88] we're going to make some cauliflower
[3641.32 - 3646.40] rice now crooked teeth have to do real
[3644.88 - 3648.40] crooked teeth have to do with toxic
[3646.40 - 3651.00] heavy metals too coming
[3648.40 - 3653.12] into the world with because they'll say
[3651.00 - 3655.24] it's jeans crooked teeth are jeans jeans
[3653.12 - 3657.28] jeans they say well the crooked teeth
[3655.24 - 3659.20] this person has is similar to the
[3657.28 - 3661.60] crooked teeth their family member had
[3659.20 - 3663.28] and so forth and it's like really what's
[3661.60 - 3664.84] happening it's similar to the Mercury
[3663.28 - 3666.52] the family member has all the way down
[3664.84 - 3668.32] the line it's Mercury Mercury Mercury
[3666.52 - 3670.20] that's in their body and it's passed on
[3668.32 - 3672.04] from generation to generation and then
[3670.20 - 3674.68] you get the crooked teeth because of all
[3672.04 - 3676.52] that mercury let's sauté these onions
[3674.68 - 3678.96] nice and good let's get some cauliflower
[3676.52 - 3678.96] in here
[3680.32 - 3684.76] now wild blueberry dream says I used to

[4165.04 - 4169.68] heal can't handle dentist visit
[4167.20 - 4171.48] completely understand is removing them a
[4169.68 - 4173.24] priority in order to get them to stop
[4171.48 - 4174.56] decaying look I always tell people I've
[4173.24 - 4176.48] said it over and over again I think it's
[4174.56 - 4181.52] in the books
[4176.48 - 4184.72] too is um if one breaks you got a crack
[4181.52 - 4186.52] tooth it's falling out falling apart
[4184.72 - 4190.08] that's the one I would get done in book
[4186.52 - 4194.92] one medical medum book one I talk about
[4190.08 - 4196.68] this I don't think it's good
[4194.92 - 4199.44] from what Spirit of compassion has
[4196.68 - 4201.64] taught me to get them all done at once
[4199.44 - 4205.44] if you're going to ever get them all
[4201.64 - 4208.64] done getting six done eight done at once
[4205.44 - 4213.08] not good you want to do just a couple at
[4208.64 - 4217.76] a time maybe one at a time um per Dental
[4213.08 - 4217.76] visit it's less burden on your immune
[4218.56 - 4223.20] system I tell friends they could leave
[4221.00 - 4225.88] them alone unless they're causing a
[4223.20 - 4228.68] problem in sense where they're um
[4225.88 - 4231.72] they're broken the tooth is cracked and
[4228.68 - 4231.72] needs to be cared
[4234.40 - 4238.92] for it's great to be on here you guys

[4275.08 - 4279.60] body that's a lot of mercury being

[4762.16 - 4766.56] take oranges
[4764.84 - 4768.48] I'm going to marinate Ginger this this
[4766.56 - 4771.84] is going to be really good right
[4768.48 - 4774.84] here all right let's do this again with
[4771.84 - 4777.92] a little bit more orange this rice is
[4774.84 - 4781.44] cooking keep an eye on it don't turn it
[4777.92 - 4783.44] into mush this is rice you're making
[4781.44 - 4788.20] don't turn it into you can turn rice
[4783.44 - 4791.84] into mush in a heartbeat you really
[4788.20 - 4794.84] can okay look at
[4791.84 - 4794.84] that
[4796.04 - 4801.84] nice that hot pepper and that the onions
[4799.28 - 4804.64] steaming in the pan with this asparagus
[4801.84 - 4807.36] sushi I'm making sushi
[4804.64 - 4810.52] rolls so
[4807.36 - 4812.76] good look at that orange that's a really
[4810.52 - 4814.84] good orange right there
[4812.76 - 4817.64] nice you
[4814.84 - 4821.00] guys but seriously with teeth
[4817.64 - 4823.00] problems you'll see everything blamed on
[4821.00 - 4825.20] the wrong thing with teeth like lemon
[4823.00 - 4827.36] water lemon's bad you'll see that out
[4825.20 - 4829.08] there like people would just say the
[4827.36 - 4832.36] wrong things for teeth but they just
[4829.08 - 4832.36] don't realize it they don't
[4833.64 - 4838.24] know and the whole vegan thing like if
[4836.40 - 4841.84] you're vegan and that's why your teeth
[4838.24 - 4844.16] are bad that's really rude and wrong I
[4841.84 - 4847.16] mean if it was real fine if it was
[4844.16 - 4853.36] actually accurate
[4847.16 - 4856.08] fine I will say this one diet that will
[4853.36 - 4858.60] destroy teeth turn them into that
[4856.08 - 4862.32] terrible time capsule
[4858.60 - 4865.08] problem it's the carnivore diet where
[4862.32 - 4866.40] it's not even the healthier meat eating
[4865.08 - 4867.72] diets where you're getting enough fruit
[4866.40 - 4869.68] and vegetables and everything and
[4867.72 - 4871.52] carnivore diets are changing right I
[4869.68 - 4873.56] predicted that I predicted it would
[4871.52 - 4875.88] change because you can't survive that
[4873.56 - 4878.60] way only eating meat on its own by
[4875.88 - 4881.04] itself you gets so deficient and glucose
[4878.60 - 4885.40] deficient no sugar to the brain it gets
[4881.04 - 4887.36] so bad and and so yeah that's a real hit
[4885.40 - 4889.92] on teeth right there intermittent
[4887.36 - 4891.56] fasting can be a hit on teeth too
[4889.92 - 4894.44] because it's you know done wrong you're
[4891.56 - 4896.20] not doing enough alkaline leafy greens
[4894.44 - 4898.28] so intermittent
[4896.20 - 4901.24] fasting that one right there can
[4898.28 - 4903.80] definitely hit teeth really
[4901.24 - 4907.92] hard okay let's get a little honey in
[4903.80 - 4907.92] here and we're going to marinate some
[4911.64 - 4916.52] ginger okay let's slice up some ginger
[4914.60 - 4918.64] pieces for this I'm going to move this
[4916.52 - 4922.88] over and I'm going to get another piece
[4918.64 - 4925.88] of Ginger and the rice is almost
[4922.88 - 4925.88] done
[4928.80 - 4935.60] nice you guys with me on this can you I
[4931.84 - 4938.52] can't wait to try these cannot
[4935.60 - 4941.56] wait okay let's slice these pieces of
[4938.52 - 4944.68] Ginger slice them
[4941.56 - 4949.64] thin don't slice them thick these are
[4944.68 - 4953.60] thin slices you want to marinade in that
[4949.64 - 4955.92] orange so I'm kind of doing thin slices
[4953.60 - 4958.96] carefully last thing I want to do is cut
[4955.92 - 4961.48] my finger in front of all you guys that
[4958.96 - 4961.48] would not be
[4961.76 - 4967.24] fun let me put the Bowl here you see
[4964.32 - 4969.60] that there we go I'll cut back here just
[4967.24 - 4974.56] get these Ginger pieces nice and
[4969.60 - 4974.56] sliced look at that nice and sliced in
[4974.88 - 4980.16] I threw a thick one in there I'm going
[4977.04 - 4985.56] to do another piece of Ginger why
[4980.16 - 4985.56] not okay check the rice one more
[4988.48 - 4991.84] time almost
[4993.20 - 4996.68] there almost
[4997.80 - 5004.48] there
[5000.64 - 5004.48] okay peeling back some this
[5013.40 - 5019.28] Ginger okay we're going to do these thin
[5017.24 - 5022.44] slices that are longer
[5019.28 - 5024.12] slices just like this might not be able
[5022.44 - 5028.84] to see them behind there but we'll we'll
[5024.12 - 5032.16] just get it going there we go
[5028.84 - 5033.56] nice okay look how thin these are take a
[5032.16 - 5037.28] look you you guys see popping them in
[5033.56 - 5040.64] like this and then here's a thick piece
[5037.28 - 5043.12] there you go marinating these rice is
[5040.64 - 5048.00] just about
[5043.12 - 5050.16] done all right put this
[5048.00 - 5053.00] aside
[5050.16 - 5056.56] wo when you're up against a lot
[5053.00 - 5059.84] already your body may not prioritize
[5056.56 - 5062.84] your teeth you're up against pathogens
[5059.84 - 5065.96] low-grade viral infections strep
[5062.84 - 5068.64] bacteria staff in your system a lot of
[5065.96 - 5071.60] people got CF in their system a lot of
[5068.64 - 5074.60] people got unproductive fungus yeast
[5071.60 - 5076.68] mold in their system right mainly the
[5074.60 - 5079.04] pathogens like the viruses and stuff
[5076.68 - 5082.36] really keep the immune system
[5079.04 - 5083.92] busy so bacteria and viruses tend to
[5082.36 - 5086.08] keep everybody busy and then add the
[5083.92 - 5088.44] toxic heavy metals and the chemicals and
[5086.08 - 5089.96] add the coffee and the caffeine and add
[5088.44 - 5091.72] the vinegar and all the other different
[5089.96 - 5093.44] things including a lot of the stuff
[5091.72 - 5095.92] that's in in the health realm that
[5093.44 - 5098.12] doesn't doesn't actually help you it
[5095.92 - 5100.04] hurts you and maybe you're in a bad
[5098.12 - 5103.20] stressful situation you're under a lot
[5100.04 - 5106.96] you're under a lot of stress you have an
[5103.20 - 5110.72] emotional um emotional challenge that's
[5106.96 - 5112.64] really hard on you losses struggles and
[5110.72 - 5115.28] it's draining minerals from you quickly
[5112.64 - 5117.72] and your adrenaline is rushing so I want
[5115.28 - 5121.76] to hit that one last
[5117.72 - 5124.08] time right there fight or flight bad for
[5121.76 - 5127.48] the teeth
[5124.08 - 5130.52] fight or flight flight or fight is bad
[5127.48 - 5132.96] for the teeth adrenaline surges because
[5130.52 - 5134.64] you're under something that has happened
[5132.96 - 5137.28] like someone texted you something that's
[5134.64 - 5139.48] awful maybe maybe someone misunderstood
[5137.28 - 5140.88] you maybe you're triggered maybe you're
[5139.48 - 5144.28] going through a really hard time maybe
[5140.88 - 5145.92] you're struggling it's adrenaline right
[5144.28 - 5148.44] maybe you're just somebody that's into
[5145.92 - 5150.12] adrenaline Sports you're physically
[5148.44 - 5153.88] capable of doing it and you're doing
[5150.12 - 5156.68] you're like an adrenaline junkie
[5153.88 - 5159.48] and so and you're somebody like that too
[5156.68 - 5161.20] so but adrenals what they do is when
[5159.48 - 5163.24] we're up against stuff and we're using
[5161.20 - 5165.32] them a lot they pump and they pump and
[5163.24 - 5167.56] they pump and what happens these little
[5165.32 - 5169.92] adrenal glands are pumping and
[5167.56 - 5171.60] pumping and they're releasing adrenaline
[5169.92 - 5174.36] and adrenaline is corrosive and
[5171.60 - 5175.88] adrenaline needs to be calmed down by
[5174.36 - 5178.16] minerals in the
[5175.88 - 5179.96] body but we just it depletes our
[5178.16 - 5182.36] minerals instead it just gives us
[5179.96 - 5185.08] mineral deficiencies and then we get get
[5182.36 - 5188.08] in trouble that's another thing too you
[5185.08 - 5191.80] add all of these
[5188.08 - 5193.32] up all right let's get the filling going
[5191.80 - 5195.72] let's get things
[5193.32 - 5198.76] going I have to thinly slice some
[5195.72 - 5198.76] radishes really
[5199.08 - 5202.08] quick
[5202.84 - 5209.28] okay Den gay says a w bro you got so
[5207.40 - 5211.68] much energy that's a testament to
[5209.28 - 5214.84] Medical mean protocols in itself I do

[5214.84 - 5219.28] very much I really appreciate that I do
[5217.16 - 5221.60] truly so what I'm going to do is slice
[5219.28 - 5223.48] these really thin because I'm going to
[5221.60 - 5225.56] place them in the Nori really thin so
[5223.48 - 5230.04] they don't break the Nori
[5225.56 - 5233.36] sheets so if you can see really quick
[5230.04 - 5233.36] and I think our rice
[5234.00 - 5239.32] is is just about there I'm going to give
[5236.60 - 5239.32] it a couple more
[5241.12 - 5246.76] minutes okay slicing these radishes
[5244.84 - 5248.80] really thin you guys this is going to be
[5246.76 - 5252.68] fun when we fill these Nory sheets it's
[5248.80 - 5254.24] going to be insane it's going to be sick
[5252.68 - 5256.80] seriously
[5254.24 - 5259.28] okay there's
[5256.80 - 5261.32] one I still got more to go I got some
[5259.28 - 5265.08] fixings to
[5261.32 - 5267.24] go I I I fell asleep on you guys if you
[5265.08 - 5269.48] have trouble with the screen freezing or
[5267.24 - 5272.24] sound go to YouTube rumble or medical
[5269.48 - 5275.24] medium.com on medical medium.com we are

[5292.56 - 5295.64] and then we'll get the Cucumber done and
[5293.84 - 5300.28] we're
[5295.64 - 5303.16] good so we're actually airing in a few
[5300.28 - 5305.00] different places
[5303.16 - 5307.40] few different
[5305.00 - 5310.24] channels I'm going to shut this
[5307.40 - 5314.64] off because this is
[5310.24 - 5318.72] actually at its best that's cauliflower
[5314.64 - 5318.72] rice these are really nice and
[5321.04 - 5326.76] thin I wouldn't say paper I would say
[5323.96 - 5326.76] close to it
[5327.48 - 5330.48] though
[5331.00 - 5335.08] okay
[5333.16 - 5337.48] the thing is is Dental when you get
[5335.08 - 5339.60] dental work done cosmetically it wears
[5337.48 - 5340.96] out and you got to redo it again it's
[5339.60 - 5345.32] like you get veneers then you got to get
[5340.96 - 5348.00] the veneers again it just wears
[5345.32 - 5349.84] out and so do fillings fillings wear out
[5348.00 - 5352.24] over time they crack they break they got
[5349.84 - 5353.72] to get redone and what happens is most
[5352.24 - 5356.56] of the time when they get redone if they
[5353.72 - 5357.88] were deep fillings deep ones then the
[5356.56 - 5360.76] dentist is going to say hey you need a
[5357.88 - 5362.20] root canal now that's a that's what the
[5360.76 - 5366.08] dentists will do they'll be like you
[5362.20 - 5368.68] need a root canal now and people run
[5366.08 - 5368.68] into that a
[5369.76 - 5374.00] lot okay radishes I want to put it in
[5372.84 - 5376.48] this
[5374.00 - 5378.88] bowl there we go and I want to move in
[5376.48 - 5382.08] cucumber really quick knock this
[5378.88 - 5385.24] out the rice is
[5382.08 - 5386.84] done all right I'm peeling the skin back
[5385.24 - 5389.28] on this I know I told you guys the last
[5386.84 - 5392.28] time I did the Nory rolls the reason why
[5389.28 - 5394.48] this is not a garden cucumber this skin
[5392.28 - 5398.12] will have this is an organic cucumber
[5394.48 - 5401.28] but the skin will have a treatment on it
[5398.12 - 5401.28] and kind of keep that in
[5401.36 - 5408.36] mind organic produce and conventional
[5405.88 - 5410.96] produce not all conventional produce but
[5408.36 - 5415.04] conventional produce will will be
[5410.96 - 5419.84] treated so this skin right here will
[5415.04 - 5422.68] have anything from MSG in it nicotine in
[5419.84 - 5425.24] it so what you'll see
[5422.68 - 5427.72] and not to mention if somebody's
[5425.24 - 5429.60] fingernails are got all kinds of crud
[5427.72 - 5433.60] under there like crazy
[5429.60 - 5435.80] DNA all kinds of different junk and
[5433.60 - 5437.24] garbage and feces and everything else
[5435.80 - 5438.72] and their fingernails and they're at the
[5437.24 - 5441.16] supermarket and they're grabbing the
[5438.72 - 5442.56] cucumbers and they Le they put it back
[5441.16 - 5444.84] and what happens is their fingernails
[5442.56 - 5447.68] went jammed into the Cucumber I kind of
[5444.84 - 5448.84] want to get the skin off a little bit I
[5447.68 - 5452.68] don't need
[5448.84 - 5454.68] to be eating somebody else's like FEC
[5452.68 - 5457.32] particles it's not something that I
[5454.68 - 5457.32] would like to
[5457.80 - 5464.48] do just like the feal matter implant
[5461.44 - 5468.20] thing feal implant matter I don't like
[5464.48 - 5471.36] that either I would never never allow
[5468.20 - 5473.32] that would never do that modality where
[5471.36 - 5476.24] they put somebody else's feces up you
[5473.32 - 5477.92] know in your colon through your anus oh
[5476.24 - 5479.32] my God I would never do that there's no
[5477.92 - 5481.12] way someone's putting somebody else's
[5479.32 - 5482.96] [ __ ] up my ass it's not happening it's
[5481.12 - 5485.44] not happening and I see that getting
[5482.96 - 5486.96] popular like are you insane they don't
[5485.44 - 5488.44] catch the viruses and that stuff they're
[5486.96 - 5490.16] not looking for all the viruses in
[5488.44 - 5492.96] different different pathogens and
[5490.16 - 5494.88] material that'ss in that stuff it's
[5492.96 - 5497.56] crazy so what I'm going to do is I'm
[5494.88 - 5499.40] going to cut this cucumber a certain way
[5497.56 - 5501.32] so it's
[5499.40 - 5504.48] not there we
[5501.32 - 5506.64] go I'm going to cut it like this too
[5504.48 - 5509.44] there we go I don't want them real big
[5506.64 - 5513.76] and hunky keep that in
[5509.44 - 5513.76] mind I want these nice
[5514.00 - 5520.60] watch this right I want it like
[5517.40 - 5523.64] this let me just get this right there we
[5520.60 - 5526.56] go thank you Anthony just had a tooth
[5523.64 - 5530.44] breaking some days ago it's one of my
[5526.56 - 5530.44] four dead teeth thank you so much
[5532.68 - 5538.28] forever okay making these nice and even
[5535.84 - 5539.88] because I don't want them tearing up
[5538.28 - 5542.28] these nor rolls normally I wouldn't be
[5539.88 - 5544.16] this careful but
[5542.28 - 5545.92] but I'm having having some people over
[5544.16 - 5549.36] and what's going to happen is I want
[5545.92 - 5551.04] these to really like have a look to them
[5549.36 - 5555.60] I want them to
[5551.04 - 5557.40] be you know presentable I mean honestly
[5555.60 - 5560.20] if I was making this for myself right
[5557.40 - 5562.32] now just for myself I would just throw
[5560.20 - 5564.96] this whole piece of cucumber in that
[5562.32 - 5567.12] that roll possibly with that rice and
[5564.96 - 5568.64] some other stuff I would probably
[5567.12 - 5571.64] wouldn't be doing it this way but this
[5568.64 - 5576.76] is okay this is great I like the Pres
[5571.64 - 5576.76] presentation that this is going to

[5614.16 - 5617.80] we got that we got that now we're just
[5616.48 - 5619.24] going to cut these scallions back a
[5617.80 - 5622.08] little bit look at these scallions from
[5619.24 - 5625.40] my garden take a look at that look at
[5622.08 - 5628.88] that is that insane or
[5625.40 - 5630.44] what it's really really amazing I'm
[5628.88 - 5632.68] going to cut this one this is very long
[5630.44 - 5634.88] one so you'll see half of it being cut
[5632.68 - 5637.12] here we
[5634.88 - 5640.80] go just made
[5637.12 - 5644.00] these nice ones right there look pretty
[5640.80 - 5647.64] cool right all right pop them here do
[5644.00 - 5649.72] another let's get this bottom
[5647.64 - 5651.20] piece lost that knife we're going to use
[5649.72 - 5654.56] this knife
[5651.20 - 5656.92] now got to be careful in the kitchen
[5654.56 - 5656.92] we're
[5657.04 - 5662.12] live all
[5659.88 - 5664.48] right there we go
[5662.12 - 5667.68] we'll do
[5664.48 - 5670.00] another we take off that tip all right
[5667.68 - 5672.08] Wendy says or Rook Canal's necessary
[5670.00 - 5674.84] Unfortunately they are to keep a tooth
[5672.08 - 5676.64] for a lot of people Unfortunately they
[5674.84 - 5680.52] are they're
[5676.64 - 5680.52] necessary if it gets that
[5684.40 - 5689.32] bad okay there we go all
[5689.80 - 5694.92] right so
[5693.32 - 5698.48] if your
[5694.92 - 5701.60] um if what happens is if that cavity
[5698.48 - 5704.32] went too deep or you just have bacteria
[5701.60 - 5706.00] that somehow got deep into the root your
[5704.32 - 5708.80] body's immune system did not like
[5706.00 - 5710.80] capture it it not grab it it didn't
[5708.80 - 5712.52] destroy it and you got bacteria that got
[5710.80 - 5718.28] in that root somehow and around that
[5712.52 - 5720.52] root or you had a cavity done
[5718.28 - 5725.08] okay there's a better better look at the
[5720.52 - 5726.92] root right and you had a cavity done and
[5725.08 - 5728.52] yet some bacteria still stayed in there
[5726.92 - 5731.00] it went too deep the cavity might have
[5728.52 - 5732.72] been too deep either way a lot of people
[5731.00 - 5733.92] are getting a cavity a lot of people
[5732.72 - 5736.20] don't know they're going to get a root
[5733.92 - 5738.80] canal until they're in the dentist chair
[5736.20 - 5741.00] and the their cavity is being drilled
[5738.80 - 5742.76] and then the dentist goes too far and
[5741.00 - 5746.04] goes into the pulp of the tooth right
[5742.76 - 5747.28] into the nerve way too deep and then
[5746.04 - 5750.08] they're like whoa you're going to need a
[5747.28 - 5751.84] rot canal in order to keep that tooth
[5750.08 - 5753.20] it's necessary to get a rot canal it's
[5751.84 - 5755.08] necessary to do that sometimes they'll
[5753.20 - 5756.32] do a crown sometimes they won't it all
[5755.08 - 5757.84] depends on the dentist or what's
[5756.32 - 5760.36] happening or how much how much of your
[5757.84 - 5763.44] tooth is left but a lot of times
[5760.36 - 5765.76] bacteria inflames those that
[5763.44 - 5768.16] nerve and yeah root canals are are
[5765.76 - 5768.16] necessary
[5768.76 - 5771.96] unfortunately you know in alternative
[5770.84 - 5773.28] movement it's like don't get a root
[5771.96 - 5774.96] canal don't get a root canal don't get a
[5773.28 - 5777.40] root canal okay then what are you going
[5774.96 - 5779.12] to do you're going to lose your tooth
[5777.40 - 5780.32] like what are we going to do like the
[5779.12 - 5783.24] tooth's
[5780.32 - 5785.76] gone
[5783.24 - 5785.76] got another
[5786.20 - 5791.00] knife like you know we get in trouble
[5788.96 - 5793.40] like that and then there's Teeth Let's
[5791.00 - 5794.84] talk about I didn't know I was actually
[5793.40 - 5796.72] going to be able to talk so much about
[5794.84 - 5798.68] teeth while we're doing this but it's
[5796.72 - 5799.92] fun that way I like that let's get a
[5798.68 - 5802.36] couple more of
[5799.92 - 5804.52] these this is actually
[5802.36 - 5807.08] fun I don't know about you guys but I'm
[5804.52 - 5808.80] having a good time let's just get the
[5807.08 - 5810.24] scallions the scallions done and we can
[5808.80 - 5811.84] make these rolls and we're going to make
[5810.24 - 5813.44] these rolls good
[5811.84 - 5815.80] look at that see how I'm doing that
[5813.44 - 5818.52] these are long long scallions from the
[5815.80 - 5820.16] garden and I can I can make so many out
[5818.52 - 5822.72] of these look I just made one right
[5820.16 - 5824.12] there see I'm going to add that to there
[5822.72 - 5825.92] right and then I'm going to take this
[5824.12 - 5828.00] and I'm going to cut this in half so
[5825.92 - 5830.84] we're not doing a huge
[5828.00 - 5833.28] scallion in in the Nori roll look I cut
[5830.84 - 5835.60] it in half and watch this you guys boom
[5833.28 - 5836.52] look at this perfect sizes let's do
[5835.60 - 5839.28] another
[5836.52 - 5843.20] one clenching I talk about in the
[5839.28 - 5843.20] medical medium books
[5843.60 - 5850.56] right shingles
[5846.68 - 5853.16] TMJ pain trigeminal nerve pain how about
[5850.56 - 5855.92] that all of it and then and then the
[5853.16 - 5859.24] tension and then the teeth grinding it's
[5855.92 - 5861.24] not just strep it's not just strep or
[5859.24 - 5863.24] and and bacteria that's in around
[5861.24 - 5867.08] people's teeth it's not just cavity
[5863.24 - 5869.28] bacteria it's not any of that it's viral
[5867.08 - 5870.88] so what happens with people is when
[5869.28 - 5873.48] they're clenching their jaw and they're
[5870.88 - 5877.12] grind Bing their
[5873.48 - 5879.28] teeth that right there that's from the
[5877.12 - 5881.80] nerves the cranial nerves like the
[5879.28 - 5884.96] trigeminal nerve being inflamed so when
[5881.80 - 5887.68] it's even mildly inflamed we get tension
[5884.96 - 5889.16] and we actually clench and when people
[5887.68 - 5891.84] have the fever blister the Simplex
[5889.16 - 5894.08] herpes one simplex virus you don't even
[5891.84 - 5896.24] have to have the blister on your lip you
[5894.08 - 5898.48] don't have to have it and you'll still
[5896.24 - 5898.48] be
[5900.12 - 5904.88] clenching so a lot of and shingles
[5903.28 - 5906.72] that's another one shingles in
[5904.88 - 5908.80] somebody's system can do a lot of
[5906.72 - 5910.76] clenching wondering Wishin says thank
[5908.80 - 5912.08] you for saying root canals are okay I
[5910.76 - 5913.76] had four before medical medium
[5912.08 - 5917.16] information now I don't feel so bad
[5913.76 - 5919.32] don't feel bad at all don't feel bad at
[5917.16 - 5921.56] all we try not to get root canals by
[5919.32 - 5923.92] taking care of our teeth in all the ways
[5921.56 - 5925.52] we can that's medical medum information
[5923.92 - 5927.76] but if you have to get a root canal in
[5925.52 - 5930.64] the past or something happens and you
[5927.76 - 5935.12] need one it's it's not it's it's not
[5930.64 - 5937.40] your fault it happens all right you guys
[5935.12 - 5937.40] I'm
[5939.60 - 5946.28] ready let's go and let's make these I
[5943.12 - 5948.56] actually think we're ready voila Nory
[5946.28 - 5951.00] sheet I need to tell you something about
[5948.56 - 5951.00] this Nory
[5952.72 - 5957.52] sheet if you take Nory sheets these are
[5955.44 - 5960.04] toasted if you take Nory sheets straight
[5957.52 - 5964.08] out of the
[5960.04 - 5965.92] package you have to moisten them if you
[5964.08 - 5969.20] want to make a roll up because they'll
[5965.92 - 5972.16] just explode they'll explode and fall
[5969.20 - 5973.76] apart so you have to moisten them dampen
[5972.16 - 5977.52] them I don't have to with these cuz I
[5973.76 - 5980.32] had the I had the package open for a
[5977.52 - 5982.20] long time and moisture just got in there
[5980.32 - 5984.16] and that's what's really cool too people
[5982.20 - 5987.44] do get unnecessary root canals I just
[5984.16 - 5990.36] want to say they do when there's viral
[5987.44 - 5993.64] issues a virus inflaming like shingles
[5990.36 - 5995.56] or herpes simplex 1 inflaming the
[5993.64 - 5998.52] trigeminal nerves and they're feeling
[5995.56 - 6000.92] jaw pain they're feeling gum pain like
[5998.52 - 6003.04] they're gum a lot of people have burning
[6000.92 - 6005.16] gums from the shingles virus even a
[6003.04 - 6006.28] little bit of Epstein bar they'll have
[6005.16 - 6009.44] burning
[6006.28 - 6011.88] gums they'll have jaw pain they'll be
[6009.44 - 6015.64] hurting over here really bad by their
[6011.88 - 6018.56] MERS the dentist does that
[6015.64 - 6020.32] Panorama takes digitals says
[6018.56 - 6023.00] everything's looking pretty good but if
[6020.32 - 6024.96] you keep on having pain over here if
[6023.00 - 6026.20] that hurts ma'am if that hurts right
[6024.96 - 6028.00] here we're going to have to do a root
[6026.20 - 6030.76] canal maybe that will fix it a lot of
[6028.00 - 6032.52] people get unnecessary root canals they
[6030.76 - 6034.16] don't work they get the root canal and
[6032.52 - 6036.48] they're still in pain because it was
[6034.16 - 6038.68] viral inflammation I see dentist talking
[6036.48 - 6039.96] about that now but guess what that was
[6038.68 - 6041.72] published first with medical medium
[6039.96 - 6044.68] material and medical medium
[6041.72 - 6049.04] information and now they're using that
[6044.68 - 6052.16] my most unfavorite thing ever is MM info
[6049.04 - 6055.72] out there origin it from the books and
[6052.16 - 6059.52] from my lectures over the years and then
[6055.72 - 6060.96] taken used the wrong way and then at the
[6059.52 - 6063.68] same time they say that medical medium
[6060.96 - 6065.64] knows nothing out there it hurts people
[6063.68 - 6068.52] bad because they can't get back to the
[6065.64 - 6070.08] source and learn the information so they
[6068.52 - 6072.60] can heal all
[6070.08 - 6074.36] right I got a nor sheet right here I
[6072.60 - 6075.48] don't have to moist inate I might take a
[6074.36 - 6078.04] little bit of the orange juice at the
[6075.48 - 6078.04] end to seal
[6079.20 - 6086.00] it okay I'm not going to use a sushi mat
[6084.40 - 6087.48] I don't need one I don't like using
[6086.00 - 6090.08] those I think they make it more
[6087.48 - 6092.20] difficult I think they're even harder on
[6090.08 - 6095.68] beginners so that's that's something
[6092.20 - 6098.64] that's important to to
[6095.68 - 6100.24] know all right let's get some rice in
[6098.64 - 6104.36] here let's
[6100.24 - 6104.36] roll we got some cauliflower
[6104.60 - 6109.36] rice piping hot too it's piping
[6109.52 - 6114.16] hot guys see see this it's up to you on
[6112.56 - 6116.68] how much you want to use how much you
[6114.16 - 6116.68] don't want to
[6118.04 - 6121.80] use
[6120.08 - 6124.32] okay all
[6121.80 - 6126.00] right I'm going to move this over so it
[6124.32 - 6129.20] actually
[6126.00 - 6132.20] helps okay there we are we have that

[6140.84 - 6145.08] one to start with right there I'm also
[6142.88 - 6146.92] going to put one of these cucumber
[6145.08 - 6149.48] slices in
[6146.92 - 6150.88] here I don't care if this cucumber slice
[6149.48 - 6152.84] is kind of long right there I'm going to
[6150.88 - 6155.56] put one of these you can also cut these
[6152.84 - 6158.52] in half a couple of these let me see do

[6217.92 - 6226.88] of this orange juice on the edge like
[6221.56 - 6226.88] that that one's done let's cut
[6229.20 - 6233.40] it now you want to give yourself
[6231.32 - 6234.96] somewhat of an end here so you can
[6233.40 - 6238.68] really have something to grab on to you
[6234.96 - 6243.36] want to saw you want to saw with your
[6238.68 - 6244.04] knife it's important see see I'm sawing

[6244.04 - 6248.40] there if you don't do the sawing
[6251.48 - 6257.00] action
[6254.48 - 6259.04] okay use a straight blade don't use a
[6257.00 - 6263.08] saw blade of any

[6384.08 - 6389.72] know I don't think we're missing
[6386.12 - 6391.84] something I think we have it let's get a
[6389.72 - 6395.20] little bit of this orange juice on the
[6391.84 - 6397.84] edge there and now we're ready to cut
[6395.20 - 6400.92] give yourself a little bit of an
[6397.84 - 6402.08] edge do a sawing action all right there
[6400.92 - 6404.92] we
[6402.08 - 6407.36] go seriously though a lot of
[6404.92 - 6409.92] people they're doing things that are
[6407.36 - 6411.36] hurting their teeth every single day
[6409.92 - 6413.96] they're out there're doing stuff that's
[6411.36 - 6417.44] hurting their teeth they don't know it
[6413.96 - 6417.44] they don't know it it's really
[6419.76 - 6424.36] sad now if I had look if I had a bunch
[6422.80 - 6428.52] of
[6424.36 - 6431.68] implants if I had a bunch of implants if
[6428.52 - 6435.24] I had three or four root
[6431.68 - 6436.72] canals I shouldn't be I honestly I most
[6435.24 - 6439.32] likely shouldn't be giving you any
[6436.72 - 6441.12] advice on this I
[6439.32 - 6443.08] mean
[6441.12 - 6445.12] because I've had a chance since I was
[6443.08 - 6447.24] younger to take care of my teeth through
[6445.12 - 6450.16] S so's information with this knowledge
[6447.24 - 6453.08] to stay away from things and to be
[6450.16 - 6456.48] cautious but um but when I talk to like
[6453.08 - 6457.56] podcast doctors or you know a lot of the
[6456.48 - 6459.20] guys that are out there in the health
[6457.56 - 6461.60] realm a lot of the doctors your teeth
[6459.20 - 6464.24] are just they're just they're a terrible
[6461.60 - 6467.12] shape their teeth
[6464.24 - 6470.32] and I mean they have so much teeth work
[6467.12 - 6472.08] done it it's crazy how much and I'm not
[6470.32 - 6473.64] judging them but they sit there and they
[6472.08 - 6475.52] actually try to say they know everything
[6473.64 - 6477.52] about everything they try to say they
[6475.52 - 6479.32] know everything about autoimmune they
[6477.52 - 6480.80] say the body attacks itself that's why
[6479.32 - 6482.92] people have autoimmune they say all
[6480.80 - 6485.68] these things right talk about genes and
[6482.92 - 6487.68] all kinds of stuff and they talk about
[6485.68 - 6489.36] like you know these different keto diets
[6487.68 - 6493.76] and intermittent fasting diets and their
[6489.36 - 6495.20] teeth are just all like mangled up and
[6493.76 - 6496.76] they've been in the the realm for a
[6495.20 - 6498.40] little while enough and they're like
[6496.76 - 6500.60] afraid of lemon water they're afraid of
[6498.40 - 6501.84] all kinds of things they just don't know
[6500.60 - 6503.84] I'm going to put a cucumber in here
[6501.84 - 6507.80] asparagus and let's get some more slices
[6503.84 - 6507.80] of of these right
[6508.08 - 6513.40] here I'm going to just cut a couple of
[6510.92 - 6517.20] these there we
[6513.40 - 6517.20] go radishes in
[6517.64 - 6522.40] here radishes are really good for you by
[6520.52 - 6527.48] the way don't be afraid of radishes
[6522.40 - 6527.48] bring them in when you can um I
[6528.88 - 6534.92] um I want people to know radishes are
[6532.92 - 6537.64] really a great
[6534.92 - 6539.48] food for so many reasons I can cover
[6537.64 - 6541.48] sometime but I'm going to put this end
[6539.48 - 6544.28] right up here let's get these done this
[6541.48 - 6544.28] is going to come out
[6548.16 - 6554.08] great remember saw or you're going to
[6550.28 - 6557.84] squish it out there you
[6554.08 - 6557.84] go Sushi board
[6558.64 - 6563.88] down let's get the over here I crushed
[6562.24 - 6566.32] that one right there all right you guys
[6563.88 - 6568.24] it's coming
[6566.32 - 6570.28] together I want to ask how many of you
[6568.24 - 6571.92] guys are using vinegars at all how many
[6570.28 - 6573.56] of you guys used vinegars in the past
[6571.92 - 6576.76] that's what I wanted to ask
[6573.56 - 6579.40] you how many of
[6576.76 - 6581.28] you do apple cider vinegar that's a
[6579.40 - 6582.72] question I wanted too like are any of
[6581.28 - 6585.72] you guys doing apple cider vinegar did
[6582.72 - 6587.60] you stop using it are you still using it
[6585.72 - 6589.12] don't get me wrong it's the best vinegar
[6587.60 - 6591.08] there is out of all the
[6589.12 - 6593.00] vinegars
[6591.08 - 6595.44] apple cider vinegar I don't want
[6593.00 - 6597.16] confusion I'm not trying to contradict
[6595.44 - 6599.20] myself I'm just saying it is the best
[6597.16 - 6600.16] vinegar out of all of them especially if
[6599.20 - 6602.88] it has the
[6600.16 - 6604.76] mother but it's just as damaging there's
[6602.88 - 6607.20] no difference it does a lot of damage in
[6604.76 - 6608.88] the body in different ways put a couple
[6607.20 - 6611.84] of these in here like that let's get
[6608.88 - 6614.24] another asparagus in the middle let's
[6611.84 - 6616.76] get a
[6614.24 - 6618.96] cucumber that let's get some of
[6616.76 - 6621.12] these wait till you taste this with
[6618.96 - 6622.32] dipping sauces
[6621.12 - 6625.32] so
[6622.32 - 6628.36] good let's roll that baby
[6625.32 - 6632.12] up it's a little it's a little tricky
[6628.36 - 6634.64] that one there we go okay another one
[6632.12 - 6634.64] slice it
[6635.48 - 6640.68] up there we
[6637.60 - 6642.92] go how many of you guys are doing apple
[6640.68 - 6642.92] cider
[6649.04 - 6652.84] vinegar
[6651.00 - 6656.44] all
[6652.84 - 6656.44] right these up
[6659.12 - 6665.12] here how's it look you guys coming along
[6661.92 - 6666.56] I'm making a really nice setup here take
[6665.12 - 6668.68] a
[6666.56 - 6672.60] look that's what we're
[6668.68 - 6672.60] doing I want it to look
[6672.68 - 6678.96] good and I'm not done
[6675.32 - 6681.08] yet we still have some more to
[6678.96 - 6682.88] do
[6681.08 - 6686.08] I think one of the most confusing Parts
[6682.88 - 6688.12] about teeth no matter what is because
[6686.08 - 6690.44] they're time capsules they're like a
[6688.12 - 6692.00] ticking Time Bomb what happens is
[6690.44 - 6694.60] because they're like that ticking Time
[6692.00 - 6696.60] Bomb people don't realize when they fall
[6694.60 - 6698.48] apart like what's happening in their
[6696.60 - 6701.00] life in that moment they'll be like wait
[6698.48 - 6704.40] a minute I'm taking care of myself I'm
[6701.00 - 6707.96] eating better I'm doing good things and
[6704.40 - 6710.40] then why are my teeth acting like
[6707.96 - 6712.36] this and they just don't know that
[6710.40 - 6713.68] that's because of the past that's
[6712.36 - 6717.04] because they're like little you know
[6713.68 - 6717.04] little ticking
[6717.08 - 6721.76] grenades in somebody's in somebody's
[6719.60 - 6723.60] mouth where they just start falling
[6721.76 - 6725.60] apart from Gears of all these different
[6723.60 - 6727.92] things we
[6725.60 - 6730.36] covered I don't want anybody feeling bad
[6727.92 - 6731.44] about a root canal getting a root canal
[6730.36 - 6734.08] in the
[6731.44 - 6737.64] past I completely understand when people
[6734.08 - 6737.64] have to get R canals
[6738.88 - 6743.88] um
[6741.64 - 6743.88] all
[6744.84 - 6751.16] right another thing too is finding a
[6748.92 - 6753.16] dentist that you trust and you're happy
[6751.16 - 6756.28] with that's something I want to kind of
[6753.16 - 6760.12] cover while we're doing this I I tend to
[6756.28 - 6761.96] actually not talk about that too much
[6760.12 - 6765.00] because there's so many other different
[6761.96 - 6766.36] things to talk about but finding a
[6765.00 - 6769.08] dentist you're comfortable with there's
[6766.36 - 6771.68] a lot of people that they feel really
[6769.08 - 6774.32] uncomfortable with with their
[6771.68 - 6778.56] dentist they don't trust their
[6774.32 - 6778.56] dentist but yet they have to go to
[6780.12 - 6785.12] them sometimes it takes shopping around
[6782.56 - 6787.44] to a few different
[6785.12 - 6789.84] dentists don't be afraid of a
[6787.44 - 6793.12] conventional D dentist you can say yay
[6789.84 - 6797.64] or nay you can be the one that says hey
[6793.12 - 6800.52] I don't want to do that but I want to do
[6797.64 - 6802.44] this to Don't Be Afraid like PE there's
[6800.52 - 6803.80] some people they're just afraid of
[6802.44 - 6806.24] conventional
[6803.80 - 6808.12] dentists they go to a holistic dentist
[6806.24 - 6809.92] that's fine there's some good holistic
[6808.12 - 6812.72] dentist out there but there's some bad
[6809.92 - 6816.72] ones there's some good um conventional
[6812.72 - 6816.72] dentists out there and there's some bad
[6816.76 - 6822.72] ones you might find a conventional
[6818.96 - 6825.84] dentist that's amazing really good
[6822.72 - 6829.28] drills like no other handles your mouth
[6825.84 - 6831.68] with care but yet they don't really know
[6829.28 - 6833.48] anything about holistic but yet they do
[6831.68 - 6836.28] the job they're doing that you hire them
[6833.48 - 6837.76] for they do it right and you you can go
[6836.28 - 6838.96] to a holistic dentist that has
[6837.76 - 6840.64] everything to all the bells and wh
[6838.96 - 6843.12] whistles they do the ozone they do the
[6840.64 - 6844.44] ozone therapy they do this they do that
[6843.12 - 6846.36] all the bells and whistle they tell you
[6844.44 - 6848.60] to stay away from lemon it's going to
[6846.36 - 6850.36] dissolve your teeth whatever which is
[6848.60 - 6852.40] wrong but they'll do all these bells and
[6850.36 - 6855.76] whistles they have all the equipment
[6852.40 - 6858.08] there and and but yet they're not really
[6855.76 - 6860.32] good as a driller they're not good when
[6858.08 - 6862.44] they when they're working on your mouth
[6860.32 - 6865.04] they're not changing out gloves when you
[6862.44 - 6867.40] ask them to change out
[6865.04 - 6869.20] gloves you want a dentist that you can
[6867.40 - 6872.32] feel free to say look change your gloves
[6869.20 - 6873.96] if you can I saw you touch this this and
[6872.32 - 6875.48] this

[7092.76 - 7097.88] stuff for people who are chronically
[7095.60 - 7099.92] sick but if that's what you're doing you
[7097.88 - 7101.40] know that's what you're doing
[7099.92 - 7104.20] but the
[7101.40 - 7108.20] Millet the Millet is definitely one you
[7104.20 - 7111.00] can do which is really really good but
[7108.20 - 7112.20] if you had to do Rice you can do Rice
[7111.00 - 7115.20] you can do
[7112.20 - 7115.20] it
[7115.28 - 7119.08] okay if it's something that you really
[7117.36 - 7122.04] wanted to do and that's something you do
[7119.08 - 7123.40] then you use rice all right another
[7122.04 - 7125.04] thing I want to talk about is about
[7123.40 - 7129.16] medical meme information is about
[7125.04 - 7132.40] ammonia coming up out of your gut rising
[7129.16 - 7136.28] up up and eating away at your gums also
[7132.40 - 7138.76] destroying your teeth ammonia is
[7136.28 - 7142.12] another problem that's all about the
[7138.76 - 7144.80] liver and the HCL being really bad off
[7142.12 - 7147.08] with people Hydrochloric acid's really
[7144.80 - 7150.04] low because they burned out their their
[7147.08 - 7152.36] stomach lands from all the coffee and
[7150.04 - 7154.52] all the chocolate and the the vinegar
[7152.36 - 7157.44] the acetic acid and they burned out

[7166.92 - 7171.04] rot and then all this ammonia is Ghostly
[7169.72 - 7173.24] and it's traveling through their
[7171.04 - 7176.28] intestinal tract into their bones
[7173.24 - 7178.40] everything and into the bones means into
[7176.28 - 7180.84] your teeth and when that ammonia is
[7178.40 - 7182.20] constantly percolating up all night as
[7180.84 - 7185.00] you sleep you lay flat when you're
[7182.20 - 7186.24] sleeping and it just seeps seeps right
