[72.88 - 78.56] information because I can promise you
[75.44 - 81.52] this it's going to be really interesting
[78.56 - 82.68] extremely interesting okay first of all
[81.52 - 85.24] I just want to do a couple little things
[82.68 - 86.96] before we go into daylight savings hell
[85.24 - 88.88] this what I call it daylight savings
[86.96 - 90.76] hell before I go into that little bit I
[88.88 - 93.20] just want to see what I got here what is
[90.76 - 94.72] what am I looking at I'm looking at some
[93.20 - 98.20] potatoes because I'm going to be making
[94.72 - 99.80] some crinkle cut fries with a little
[98.20 - 101.08] crinkle knife right here I'm going to
[99.80 - 104.00] make some crinkle
[101.08 - 106.08] fries because I'm having Burgers going
[104.00 - 108.68] to do the Millet burgers in this pot
[106.08 - 111.76] right here I got some Millet piping
[108.68 - 115.60] freaking hot right there in this pot you
[111.76 - 118.08] can see it okay and then what I have
[115.60 - 121.12] here is an assortment of leafy greens
[118.08 - 124.48] leafy greens a term I did did not hear
[121.12 - 128.00] before medical medium information didn't
[124.48 - 129.56] hear it the hygienic Health movement
[128.00 - 131.84] they didn't talk about leafy greens the
[129.56 - 133.96] most they ever said was Roma lettuce
[131.84 - 135.48] going all the way back the raw folks
[133.96 - 138.84] they didn't talk about leafy greens the
[135.48 - 140.24] raw folks were just eating lettuce and
[138.84 - 141.92] the health movement in general didn't
[140.24 - 144.08] talk about leafy greens and leafy herbal
[141.92 - 146.48] greens like herb greens didn't talk
[144.08 - 148.36] about that either but we did something
[146.48 - 150.08] in the health realm Spirit of compassion
[148.36 - 151.88] and I and the medical medium team
[150.08 - 153.16] helping we got the word out there about
[151.88 - 155.76] leafy
[153.16 - 158.32] greens yes we got the word out there and
[155.76 - 160.40] now you hear it in the strangest places
[158.32 - 162.12] friend of mine said they saw a
[160.40 - 163.80] commercial a TV commercial was like one
[162.12 - 166.00] of the fast food restaurants and the guy
[163.80 - 168.80] on there was like we have leafy greens
[166.00 - 171.76] with our chicken and our burgers and I
[168.80 - 173.52] was like don't want to hear it I don't
[171.76 - 176.68] want to hear it because first of all
[173.52 - 178.92] it's ridiculous because it's a term it's
[176.68 - 180.36] a medical medium ter term and it's
[178.92 - 181.56] important to know that because it brings
[180.36 - 183.56] you back to the importance of leafing
[181.56 - 185.64] grein like all about it and why and
[183.56 - 187.92] everything around it and how it's so
[185.64 - 189.52] important those details are critical
[187.92 - 192.24] remember the details matter with all of
[189.52 - 195.44] it it's not that I want a plug for every
[192.24 - 197.92] single thing mm info did no I mean that
[195.44 - 199.88] would be nice to get people back to the
[197.92 - 201.76] start right but most importantly it's
[199.88 - 203.96] about the chronically ill and then and
[201.76 - 205.72] they're actually bumping into walls and
[203.96 - 207.76] they're looking for help and theyve seen
[205.72 - 210.28] 10 doctors and they've done a ton of
[207.76 - 212.24] antibiotic treatments they've done a ton
[210.28 - 214.48] of this and a ton of that and they've
[212.24 - 216.84] tried everything and they've been in
[214.48 - 218.56] oxygen Chambers they like buy oxygen
[216.84 - 220.40] Chambers and they're in oxygen you know
[218.56 - 222.80] therapy and they're just laying in there
[220.40 - 224.68] for hours upon hours you know thinking
[222.80 - 226.76] the oxygen chamber is going to like just
[224.68 - 229.00] fix them and next thing you know it
[226.76 - 231.00] they're dipping in the cold bathtubs
[229.00 - 232.52] covered in ice and they're doing that
[231.00 - 234.52] and next thing you know it they're
[232.52 - 237.40] trying something else and it's endless
[234.52 - 239.08] endless endless and they try this
[237.40 - 241.72] supplement that supplement this Elixir
[239.08 - 243.68] that elixir and they stay sick and when
[241.72 - 245.80] they find medical medum information
[243.68 - 247.96] something happens you guys know have you
[245.80 - 251.32] been around from the first book that was
[247.96 - 253.56] released something magical happens you
[251.32 - 256.64] actually find out why you're sick like
[253.56 - 259.20] really find out why you're sick and how
[256.64 - 260.12] to heal and then you're on your journey
[259.20 - 262.52] and then you're healing and you're
[260.12 - 265.40] moving forward and it matters but today
[262.52 - 267.00] we're talking about cutting boards we're
[265.40 - 268.68] going to be talking about cutting boards
[267.00 - 270.32] today I hope you have your cutting board
[268.68 - 272.08] ready do you have your putting board in
[270.32 - 274.24] front of you right now we're going to be
[272.08 - 276.56] making the Millet Burgers too beef
[274.24 - 280.32] burgers we going making greasy beef
[276.56 - 282.44] burgers bow Vine burgers with the juices
[280.32 - 284.60] from the animal grease all grease
[282.44 - 286.44] dripping out of the meat and the blood
[284.60 - 288.12] all cooked up in the burger we're not
[286.44 - 289.60] going to do those we're doing there's
[288.12 - 291.84] nothing wrong if someone actually eats
[289.60 - 294.44] meat half the medical mem Community I
[291.84 - 298.36] think are meat eaters um of course
[294.44 - 299.96] because we are not discriminatory to
[298.36 - 301.84] animal protein and you can can actually
[299.96 - 304.12] heal while doing animal pro protein but
[301.84 - 305.56] you have to know how to do it and you
[304.12 - 307.08] can actually heal if you're vegan you
[305.56 - 309.64] just have to know how to do it and you
[307.08 - 311.80] can heal if you're pescatarian just need
[309.64 - 313.20] to know how to do it you can heal if
[311.80 - 315.64] you're vegetarian and doing medical
[313.20 - 319.36] medium you just need to know how to do
[315.64 - 323.76] it and then you can do it so let's do it
[319.36 - 325.04] all right so moving on moving on okay
[323.76 - 329.04] good good good
[325.04 - 331.44] call all right to start with I just want
[329.04 - 333.08] to make sure my Millet is ready so I
[331.44 - 335.28] want to get a closeup on this if I can
[333.08 - 337.20] I'm going to put the pot right down here
[335.28 - 340.56] here we are that's the Millet right
[337.20 - 341.84] there I'm going to take my wooden spoon
[340.56 - 343.44] and I'm just going to mix it up and make
[341.84 - 346.92] sure it's done it's done it's looking
[343.44 - 348.64] good okay I just wanted to do that first
[346.92 - 350.68] going to make sure it's nice and ready I
[348.64 - 352.32] just cooked it let's talk about Daylight
[350.68 - 354.56] Savings
[352.32 - 357.44] Time have you ever been in a situation
[354.56 - 360.16] where Daylight Savings Time happens and
[357.44 - 361.92] you feel worn down from it
[360.16 - 363.80] now I know if many of you guys know
[361.92 - 365.32] medical mum information going back I've
[363.80 - 368.04] talked about it first in the health
[365.32 - 371.32] realm it wasn't considered a health
[368.04 - 373.92] issue so mm info brought D daylight
[371.32 - 375.96] savings to town as far as in The Chronic
[373.92 - 378.72] Leo and health department and health
[375.96 - 380.60] issues other than that it wasn't talked
[378.72 - 383.28] about except for other reasons like the
[380.60 - 386.52] economy so why was Daylight savings put
[383.28 - 390.76] together one of the biggest reasons was
[386.52 - 394.84] economics economy it was to benefit the
[390.76 - 397.52] economy the bottom line the dollar and
[394.84 - 399.64] that's why daylight savings came to town
[397.52 - 401.64] but is that the real reason because
[399.64 - 407.00] remember this there's always some
[401.64 - 410.16] Sinister evil plot behind a lot of the
[407.00 - 412.20] big mainstream things going on now I'm
[410.16 - 416.40] not saying everything mainstream has an
[412.20 - 418.44] evil plot behind it but believe me most
[416.40 - 421.12] everything in mainstream does have an
[418.44 - 423.20] evil plot and there are things in the
[421.12 - 425.28] alternative stream that have evil plots
[423.20 - 428.64] too along with it but this one here
[425.28 - 431.12] daylight savings is on another level of
[428.64 - 434.08] evil one of the reasons why they do
[431.12 - 437.52] daylight savings is to make your life
[434.08 - 439.52] miserable yes now the powers that be on
[437.52 - 443.40] this planet the
[439.52 - 448.72] illumination on this planet they think
[443.40 - 451.76] every way possible they think in any way
[448.72 - 455.16] possible how can they make human life on
[451.76 - 458.72] this planet more difficult a bigger
[455.16 - 461.28] struggle much more of a hard time
[458.72 - 463.92] obstacles pitfalls
[461.28 - 467.20] traps tiger
[463.92 - 470.36] snares and so one of those is let's
[467.20 - 471.92] change the time around let's do that on
[470.36 - 474.24] people we'll have them running on the
[471.92 - 476.24] hamster wheel we'll have them tripping
[474.24 - 477.76] over themselves you might think well how
[476.24 - 480.28] does it really hurt us you know when the
[477.76 - 483.36] time change comes everything should be
[480.28 - 485.08] fine I'm okay just a little extra tired
[483.36 - 488.96] when the time change
[485.08 - 491.24] comes but it's more than that it throws
[488.96 - 494.44] off people who are sensitive it throws
[491.24 - 497.04] off people who are struggling and sick
[494.44 - 500.52] it throws off people mentally
[497.04 - 502.64] emotionally it's a trigger for people
[500.52 - 506.24] who a bipolar trigger for people who
[502.64 - 508.72] have depression anxiety OCD OCD is a big
[506.24 - 509.84] one right there one thing that people
[508.72 - 512.04] don't understand understand is when
[509.84 - 513.60] daylight savings occurs when they change
[512.04 - 517.92] the clock where they turn it back or
[513.60 - 519.36] forward OCD and many people most people
[517.92 - 523.24] they struggle they may not even
[519.36 - 525.68] attribute it to that time change but it
[523.24 - 529.40] can throw people with OCD into a major
[525.68 - 534.28] Tail Spin one that can set them back for
[529.40 - 536.32] months until the time gets changed again
[534.28 - 538.16] and then after they've somehow
[536.32 - 539.64] stabilized with their OCD even though
[538.16 - 542.36] they're struggling and and other things
[539.64 - 544.88] may trigger them comes along the time
[542.36 - 547.80] change again and then somebody with OCD
[544.88 - 550.20] boom they're now triggered again and
[547.80 - 552.80] they're on that hamster wheel of OCD
[550.20 - 554.92] hell because of the time change now you
[552.80 - 556.80] may think well hey why would the
[554.92 - 560.08] alumination be thinking about things
[556.80 - 562.64] like this they do massive think tanks
[560.08 - 566.28] with massive money behind it and
[562.64 - 569.96] evildoers that do sit around and make
[566.28 - 572.76] charts and power points on this very
[569.96 - 575.56] stuff because they think about the
[572.76 - 578.24] things that make our lives worse and
[575.56 - 581.76] more miserable like for instance baby
[578.24 - 585.48] formula baby formula with GMO corn oil
[581.76 - 589.32] GMO soy in it the worst ingredients
[585.48 - 592.88] you've ever seen in it baby formula you
[589.32 - 595.20] would think the world would know by now
[592.88 - 597.16] that they can make a better healthier
[595.20 - 600.20] baby formula for moms that can't
[597.16 - 602.84] breastfeed but no they won't and they
[600.20 - 607.16] won't go there instead the baby formula
[602.84 - 610.76] will be the worst crap there is there's
[607.16 - 612.52] a reason for that this is what they want
[610.76 - 614.20] same thing with daylight savings and I
[612.52 - 616.72] could I could make a list of this stuff
[614.20 - 618.84] going all the way back for years about
[616.72 - 620.56] the things that they actually purposely
[618.84 - 623.92] make the way they
[620.56 - 625.08] do so that it causes more trouble or
[623.92 - 627.36] harm or
[625.08 - 628.88] difficulties so daylight savings so why
[627.36 - 631.04] should that bother anybody overall if
[628.88 - 633.16] you have some type of emotional
[631.04 - 635.40] struggles whatever it is or you you got
[633.16 - 636.32] some type of condition a mental
[635.40 - 639.28] condition you're suffering and
[636.32 - 643.08] struggling from anxiety depression
[639.28 - 647.72] sadness depersonalization that's a big
[643.08 - 651.48] one it throws off the neurons it
[647.72 - 653.32] actually sends neurons in a tail spin so
[651.48 - 655.80] the first thing that happens when the
[653.32 - 659.16] time changes
[655.80 - 661.96] forcibly is neurons start to heat up
[659.16 - 664.24] when they heat up Metals start to cook
[661.96 - 666.68] they start to oxidize faster they start
[664.24 - 666.68] to move
[667.04 - 671.40] around and what happens is our brain is
[669.68 - 673.52] challenged so every time there's a time
[671.40 - 675.56] change our brain becomes challenged and
[673.52 - 676.68] do you think indigenous cultures going
[675.56 - 677.88] all the way back you think the Native
[676.68 - 681.36] Americans you think they had a time
[677.88 - 683.40] change going on you think so so when
[681.36 - 687.20] November 1 came
[683.40 - 689.52] along in a Native American village make
[687.20 - 690.72] sure you tell everybody across North
[689.52 - 693.64] America
[690.72 - 696.72] everybody that we're gonna change the
[693.64 - 700.12] time we're gonna do
[696.72 - 703.84] that it just doesn't happen it never
[700.12 - 707.16] did but we do it here because as the
[703.84 - 710.72] centuries have gone by and time has gone
[707.16 - 714.24] by certain powers at be govern the
[710.72 - 716.60] planet and we know that you know that if
[714.24 - 718.12] you still don't know that then uh that's
[716.60 - 720.16] a nice bubble you're in I'd like to
[718.12 - 722.64] climb into that Bub bub with you and be
[720.16 - 724.56] like yeah the world is perfect nothing's
[722.64 - 727.84] going on this bubble's amazing give me
[724.56 - 730.52] this bubble you're in I would love that
[727.84 - 732.52] bubble but it's not really truly reality
[730.52 - 734.44] of what's happening and daylight savings
[732.52 - 737.96] is a prime
[734.44 - 740.88] example prime example of how the world
[737.96 - 744.08] works of how the hierarchy
[740.88 - 746.76] works so when it comes down to Daylight
[744.08 - 749.64] Savings time when it comes down to
[746.76 - 752.40] spring ahead fall back and everything
[749.64 - 756.96] else that they've termed it and coined
[752.40 - 760.28] it it disturbs balance so it's geared
[756.96 - 762.92] and created just to disturb the balance
[760.28 - 764.32] of life and if you're somebody and it
[762.92 - 767.00] really doesn't throw you much doesn't
[764.32 - 769.76] throw you much but it does does throw
[767.00 - 771.16] you much now Canary and the coal mine I
[769.76 - 772.56] want to go into that a little bit so
[771.16 - 773.60] what's a canary and a coal mine so you
[772.56 - 777.04] got a
[773.60 - 779.96] canary nice yellow canary right here and
[777.04 - 782.88] it's in a cage in a
[779.96 - 786.00] mine carved deep into the Rock Tunnel
[782.88 - 787.68] deep into the Rock right when the air
[786.00 - 790.72] and the oxygen the oxygen starts to
[787.68 - 794.92] diminish the canary sings a different
[790.72 - 798.12] tune and the miners hear it they hear a
[794.92 - 800.60] canary struggling so the point is is you
[798.12 - 804.28] don't want to wait until the canary
[800.60 - 807.36] dies and falls to the bottom of the cage
[804.28 - 809.80] you want to hear the canary sing a
[807.36 - 811.80] different tune
[809.80 - 813.72] you want to hear the canary say
[811.80 - 815.56] something different so when the miners
[813.72 - 818.64] were working it wasn't just about
[815.56 - 820.68] checking the bird in the box or checking
[818.64 - 822.72] the bird in the cage oh it's still alive
[820.68 - 825.16] we're okay let's keep on mining let's
[822.72 - 829.48] keep on mining right the bird's okay in
[825.16 - 832.36] the cage they would pay detailed
[829.48 - 835.44] attention to the canary cuz they didn't
[832.36 - 837.48] have oxygen meters back then they
[835.44 - 839.28] couldn't be like well the oxygen in this
[837.48 - 841.64] cave we just dug
[839.28 - 844.28] is actually diminishing it's at 15%
[841.64 - 846.84] oxygen now it's at 14% oxygen now it's
[844.28 - 848.68] on 12% oxygen now we're down at 8%
[846.84 - 850.00] oxygen and we're struggling they didn't
[848.68 - 852.36] have the
[850.00 - 854.92] meters so they used the canary and when
[852.36 - 855.76] the canary would actually sing a
[854.92 - 859.84] different
[855.76 - 862.96] tune it's the sound the voice of the
[859.84 - 866.16] canary the chirp would alter and that's
[862.96 - 868.28] the first thing you looked for what's
[866.16 - 870.76] happening the last thing you wanted is
[868.28 - 873.32] to just get down into that hole and look
[870.76 - 875.28] into that cage and see a canary dead and
[873.32 - 876.76] then realize you can't breathe and you
[875.28 - 879.72] can't make it
[876.76 - 883.96] back daylight savings
[879.72 - 888.00] time is like sucking the oxygen out of
[883.96 - 891.16] human life ever so
[888.00 - 896.72] gently ever so
[891.16 - 900.00] small ever so subtle but that's what it
[896.72 - 903.00] does when you're 90 years old if you've
[900.00 - 904.76] been blessed to make it to 90 and you're
[903.00 - 907.44] in a nursing
[904.76 - 911.44] home that time
[907.44 - 914.36] change can determine life or death that
[911.44 - 915.88] time change can get a worker who's
[914.36 - 920.00] taking care of a 90-year-old in a
[915.88 - 922.08] nursing home off their
[920.00 - 924.16] game that time
[922.08 - 927.36] change can get
[924.16 - 930.16] a conductor of a
[927.36 - 933.56] train with a bunch of passengers in it
[930.16 - 937.00] off its game their game that time change
[933.56 - 939.08] can get a pilot in the sky in a plane
[937.00 - 942.64] off their
[939.08 - 945.20] game it can change the way we feel the
[942.64 - 946.12] way we think can make us more forgetful
[945.20 - 949.68] in the
[946.12 - 952.64] moment can make us more apprehensive can
[949.68 - 955.08] make us less Discerning can make us too
[952.64 - 959.28] Discerning can throw off our judgment
[955.08 - 961.36] calls and so every time a time change
[959.28 - 962.44] time changes and they don't measure this
[961.36 - 964.16] cuz they don't want to measure this
[962.44 - 967.16] science doesn't want to look at this
[964.16 - 968.80] every time the time changes a bunch of
[967.16 - 972.00]  happens on this
[968.80 - 973.68] planet a bunch of accidents happen a
[972.00 - 974.76] bunch of moms driving their kids to
[973.68 - 977.36] school
[974.76 - 979.96] crash yeah all in different states in
[977.36 - 982.12] different cities in different towns
[979.96 - 983.72] because they're off their game maybe
[982.12 - 985.00] maybe a mom didn't get their caffeine
[983.72 - 986.68] and they're all groggy headed cuz
[985.00 - 988.76] they're just sick every day maybe a mom
[986.68 - 991.64] got too much caffeine maybe whatever
[988.76 - 992.92] whatever it is or maybe a dad on a
[991.64 - 996.64] construction
[992.92 - 998.92] job because rushing to work cuz the time
[996.64 - 1001.40] change maybe somebody else maybe
[998.92 - 1003.28] somebody who was drunk all night all
[1001.40 - 1005.00] jacked up they're usually used to
[1003.28 - 1007.80] getting home at 4 in the morning they
[1005.00 - 1010.44] time their alcohol consumption as they
[1007.80 - 1012.00] leave the party or the bar or the club
[1010.44 - 1013.96] and their time change throws something
[1012.00 - 1015.32] off and now boom they're crashed with
[1013.96 - 1017.28] somebody
[1015.32 - 1019.08] else they shouldn't have been driving
[1017.28 - 1020.48] drunk but either way they had their
[1019.08 - 1022.20] system down while they were driving
[1020.48 - 1023.76] drunk and now their systems thrown off
[1022.20 - 1026.72] it's these subtleties I'm just talking
[1023.76 - 1029.00] about all these different
[1026.72 - 1030.72] subtleties you're not measuring it
[1029.00 - 1034.56] science isn't measuring it no one's
[1030.72 - 1037.48] measuring it but when it happens the
[1034.56 - 1039.92] illumination Powers at be are measuring
[1037.48 - 1042.00] it they know what's happening and they
[1039.92 - 1045.20] know a storm occurs every time the
[1042.00 - 1046.68] time changes they know it cuz people are
[1045.20 - 1048.92] off their
[1046.68 - 1051.20] game and they know the people that are
[1048.92 - 1053.80] the most sensitive feel it the worst
[1051.20 - 1055.00] like the canary and when we're talking
[1053.80 - 1056.32] about the chronically ill and we're
[1055.00 - 1058.24] talking about sick people we're talking
[1056.32 - 1061.44] about
[1058.24 - 1063.68] canaries people who they're
[1061.44 - 1065.96] sensitive they they can't be that
[1063.68 - 1068.32] indestructible 22y old that hasn't
[1065.96 - 1070.08] really had a Health Challenge yet that's
[1068.32 - 1071.64] working out every day and doing this and
[1070.08 - 1073.68] doing that and drinking what they want
[1071.64 - 1077.00] eating what they want running here going
[1073.68 - 1078.64] here and then surfing here they can't be
[1077.00 - 1081.12] like that right now in their Liv life
[1078.64 - 1083.28] they're not at that State they're at a
[1081.12 - 1085.04] place where they got ticks and Tremors
[1083.28 - 1088.40] and vibrations through the body and
[1085.04 - 1090.88] sleep problems and sleep apnea insomnia
[1088.40 - 1093.20] all kinds of different mental issues too
[1090.88 - 1094.56] depression anxiety OCD bipolar whatever
[1093.20 - 1096.84] all the different things they got going
[1094.56 - 1100.16] on and then you get old people that are
[1096.84 - 1102.68] older Elders time change knocks them
[1100.16 - 1105.28] hard it knocks grandpa and grandma and
[1102.68 - 1107.72] great grandma and Great Grandpa hard and
[1105.28 - 1110.20] the powers at be the hierarchy knows
[1107.72 - 1111.52] this and understands this completely
[1110.20 - 1114.12] understands this because that's the
[1111.52 - 1115.24] whole nature of the deception and that's
[1114.12 - 1117.44] part of the
[1115.24 - 1119.00] evil that's it's not the greatest evil
[1117.44 - 1120.56] in the world it's not the biggest evil
[1119.00 - 1122.72] in the world but let me tell you it
[1120.56 - 1124.36] changes when that time changes then
[1122.72 - 1126.44] everything on the planet changes and
[1124.36 - 1130.40]  happens
[1126.44 - 1132.04] and Calamity occurs happen stance
[1130.40 - 1134.84] happens
[1132.04 - 1136.84] everywhere everywhere happen stance
[1134.84 - 1138.72] happens here happen stance happens there
[1136.84 - 1142.60] happen stance happens there and
[1138.72 - 1145.36] goes wrong all around wherever they done
[1142.60 - 1146.84] that time switch on people it throws
[1145.36 - 1149.20] them
[1146.84 - 1150.80] off people who can't see good and can't
[1149.20 - 1151.76] drive at night end up driving in the
[1150.80 - 1154.48] dark
[1151.76 - 1156.48] now when they never drove at the dark in
[1154.48 - 1157.96] the dark at that time of day when that
[1156.48 - 1160.16] time changes and now they're driving in
[1157.96 - 1162.28] the dark for the first time at that time
[1160.16 - 1164.40] of day when they never did before
[1162.28 - 1166.88] Calamity happens they're in an accident
[1164.40 - 1170.48] on highway and somebody else gets
[1166.88 - 1174.20] killed this is the stuff they Revel in
[1170.48 - 1177.36] and love they love this destruction they
[1174.20 - 1179.32] love injuries they love hardship they
[1177.36 - 1181.52] love sickness and the thing is the time
[1179.32 - 1183.28] change it worsens chronic illness it
[1181.52 - 1185.36] worsens all the canaries and chronic
[1183.28 - 1186.72] illness it starts to break them down a
[1185.36 - 1188.80] little bit and then you got to recover
[1186.72 - 1191.72] recoup and then the next one comes you
[1188.80 - 1195.16] got to recover recoup and it's not like
[1191.72 - 1197.48] daylight savings um The Wizard of
[1195.16 - 1199.28] daylight savings in the sky isn't saying
[1197.48 - 1201.68] make sure you drink extra celery juice
[1199.28 - 1202.88] make sure you do your hmds make sure you
[1201.68 - 1204.52] take care of yourself make sure you do
[1202.88 - 1206.36] your spinach soup make sure you do your
[1204.52 - 1207.60] aloe vera they're not telling you to do
[1206.36 - 1210.16] that make sure you do your zinc make
[1207.60 - 1211.64] sure you do more B12 to overcompensate
[1210.16 - 1213.96] for the daylight savings time it's not
[1211.64 - 1216.24] like this big pie in the sky and I in
[1213.96 - 1217.84] the sky big brother and so forth up
[1216.24 - 1219.76] there isn't telling you you should
[1217.84 - 1222.64] probably be on Mor B12 when we change
[1219.76 - 1226.20] the time on you and mess you up but they
[1222.64 - 1228.72] don't cuz nobody cares it's a term I
[1226.20 - 1231.36] know very well nobody
[1228.72 - 1233.64] cares that's how it works in this
[1231.36 - 1235.52] world Death By A Thousand Cuts is
[1233.64 - 1238.32] something they love to do too it's all
[1235.52 - 1241.20] packaged in the same thing you know
[1238.32 - 1242.40] what's crazy is here we are you think
[1241.20 - 1244.84] that people are looking out for the
[1242.40 - 1246.96] chronical ill you think that's happening
[1244.84 - 1249.00] now after all the work I've done for 35
[1246.96 - 1250.60] years all all the work I'm sure a lot of
[1249.00 - 1252.32] other people have done helping people
[1250.60 - 1255.20] with chronic illness you think that the
[1252.32 - 1256.60] message would be out there but no people
[1255.20 - 1258.36] with chronic illness still get told
[1256.60 - 1259.84] they're crazy still get cold told
[1258.36 - 1260.96] they're lazy still get told there's
[1259.84 - 1262.24] nothing wrong with them it's all in
[1260.96 - 1263.52] their head that they're make believing
[1262.24 - 1265.48] their symptoms conditions and their
[1263.52 - 1268.00] diagnoses they're still being told all
[1265.48 - 1269.80] this stuff then on top of
[1268.00 - 1272.16] it
[1269.80 - 1273.88] there's all the sand being thrown in
[1272.16 - 1275.36] everybody's face there's all these
[1273.88 - 1276.92] monkey wrenches being thrown in
[1275.36 - 1279.64] everybody's
[1276.92 - 1283.36] wheel and that's how it's done on this
[1279.64 - 1285.72] planet but the daylight savings is
[1283.36 - 1288.60] hierarchy kind of like April Fool's Day
[1285.72 - 1291.32] on everybody that's how it works
[1288.60 - 1295.40] it's there for reason and hopes that the
[1291.32 - 1299.72] numbers rise every time they switch that
[1295.40 - 1301.00] time fatalities rise yeah that's right
[1299.72 - 1304.92] and with every
[1301.00 - 1307.40] fatality there's a gain for illumination
[1304.92 - 1309.76] with every sick person there's a
[1307.40 - 1311.32] gain with every person that gets sicker
[1309.76 - 1313.08] and sicker and a problem happens there's
[1311.32 - 1314.56] a gain in a Reliance on the system and a
[1313.08 - 1316.64] Reliance on the medical system that's
[1314.56 - 1319.32] how it's built and daylight savings time
[1316.64 - 1322.24] is all about helping to break the
[1319.32 - 1324.08] medical system and when you help to
[1322.24 - 1328.20] break the medical system things just
[1324.08 - 1328.20] start falling apart everywhere and all
[1328.48 - 1332.56] around and that's part of what the
[1330.96 - 1334.12] illumination does and that's part of
[1332.56 - 1336.32] daylight savings time let's go on The
[1334.12 - 1339.20] Cutting Boards a little bit but we got
[1336.32 - 1342.48] stuff to make though oh no pressure
[1339.20 - 1343.76] pressure I got food to make but we I'm
[1342.48 - 1347.48] going to get some fries going let's get
[1343.76 - 1349.36] some fries crinkle cut fries all right
[1347.48 - 1351.32] so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
[1349.36 - 1352.56] take this huge potato right here this
[1351.32 - 1355.12] huge rusted potato and I'm going to
[1352.56 - 1357.04] start making some crinkle cut fries
[1355.12 - 1359.04] these were just recently steamed they
[1357.04 - 1361.72] weren't in the fridge but they're still
[1359.04 - 1365.16] working out pretty good here so let me
[1361.72 - 1369.28] just cut these up I'll show you guys too
[1365.16 - 1369.28] what it looks like there we
[1369.40 - 1374.08] go all right so I'm going to make a
[1371.52 - 1375.96] bunch of these so just bear with me here
[1374.08 - 1379.96] so what I'm doing is I'm making fries
[1375.96 - 1379.96] cuz I like fries with my burger
[1380.64 - 1384.04] you know what's incredible about these
[1381.96 - 1387.08] Millet
[1384.04 - 1391.00] Burgers they don't taste like you know
[1387.08 - 1392.96] that like MSG and that gluten fake meat
[1391.00 - 1394.56] stuff and even the fake meats that don't
[1392.96 - 1396.04] have gluten in them still got all kinds
[1394.56 - 1398.08] of hidden flavors in there natural
[1396.04 - 1399.48] flavors and MSG in there and you don't
[1398.08 - 1401.36] have to worry about that with these
[1399.48 - 1402.68] Burgers but I like fries with these
[1401.36 - 1404.24] Burgers so I'm going to pop some of
[1402.68 - 1406.60] these on here right now just bear with

[1499.32 - 1503.64] and it makes them crunchy on the outside
[1501.40 - 1506.64] too when you do with steamed potatoes
[1503.64 - 1510.32] they actually get crunchy on the
[1506.64 - 1510.32] outside how cool is
[1511.16 - 1517.68] that
[1513.28 - 1517.68] yep all right let me just cut a few
[1520.00 - 1524.76] more I hope you enjoyed my daylight
[1522.32 - 1524.76] savings
[1526.68 - 1529.68] talk
[1531.56 - 1533.96] here we
[1534.08 - 1539.00] go and I'm sure I'll be punished greatly
[1536.76 - 1539.00] for
[1539.96 - 1544.64] it with extra censorship with that
[1549.44 - 1554.48] sauce I remember when my YouTube channel
[1551.80 - 1555.76] was censored cuz it's still censored
[1554.48 - 1557.68] even though you guys are on there some
[1555.76 - 1561.36] of you I remember when it was cens
[1557.68 - 1561.36] censored in I think it was
[1563.16 - 1570.04] 2020
[1565.76 - 1572.24] and yeah we were getting like 60,000
[1570.04 - 1575.20] views really quick 880,000 views really
[1572.24 - 1577.28] quick 100,000 views people were getting
[1575.20 - 1580.04] notifications and then YouTube censored
[1577.28 - 1581.88] our YouTube channel and then we're we're
[1580.04 - 1584.56] we're lucky if somebody can find it
[1581.88 - 1587.36] right now Mike Charles what's happening
[1584.56 - 1590.28] man what what temp do you cook them at
[1587.36 - 1593.00] when you're using steamed I cook him at
[1590.28 - 1595.96] 400 but you don't want to go too high
[1593.00 - 1599.96] you don't want to go too low you know
[1595.96 - 1601.32] 375 to 4 and A4 if you go to 4 and a qu
[1599.96 - 1603.28] you're going to be you know you might be
[1601.32 - 1605.76] toasting those babies if you go to 4 and
[1603.28 - 1608.76] a qu man good to see you by the way

[1616.60 - 1619.60] here
[1619.64 - 1624.96] all right and then Twitter was censored
[1622.20 - 1626.88] years ago too so my Twitter channel was
[1624.96 - 1628.84] censored long before Twitter was
[1626.88 - 1631.08] actually censoring
[1628.84 - 1632.76] people and then you know how Twitter
[1631.08 - 1634.76] says they don't censor
[1632.76 - 1637.56] anymore oh they haven't taken the
[1634.76 - 1643.52] censorship off my
[1637.56 - 1646.52] Twitter I don't know why why but here we
[1643.52 - 1649.48] go all
[1646.52 - 1651.76] right
[1649.48 - 1653.68] there we
[1651.76 - 1656.28] are and I think I'm going to put a

[1805.52 - 1811.52] crinkle fries in the oven Buzzy B says
[1808.96 - 1814.92] yeah telegram informs and then I just
[1811.52 - 1817.16] look it up it's incredible yeah that's
[1814.92 - 1817.16] that's
[1818.08 - 1822.60] amazing all right let's get into The
[1820.24 - 1824.36] Cutting Board stuff see guys what do you
[1822.60 - 1826.24] do with your cutting board how does it
[1824.36 - 1828.36] work for
[1826.24 - 1830.28] you how do like what have you been
[1828.36 - 1833.08] taught about your cutting boards what's
[1830.28 - 1834.56] happening there because and what do you
[1833.08 - 1837.40] actually put on your cutting boards are
[1834.56 - 1838.92] you a vegetarian are you plant-based are
[1837.40 - 1840.08] you somebody that you're plant-based but
[1838.92 - 1841.32] somebody else in your family is not
[1840.08 - 1842.52] plant-based they're eating animal
[1841.32 - 1843.76] products and their animal products are
[1842.52 - 1846.00] going on The Cutting
[1843.76 - 1847.40] Board and you're just like oh my God
[1846.00 - 1848.68] there's chicken on my cutting board
[1847.40 - 1851.56] there's chicken on my cutting board
[1848.68 - 1852.92] you're freaking out is that happening
[1851.56 - 1854.48] then you should have a separate cutting
[1852.92 - 1856.24] board so I will say this to anybody
[1854.48 - 1858.92] who's living in a house it's my first
[1856.24 - 1861.96] tip is if you're living in a house with
[1858.92 - 1864.20] somebody else that's actually cooking
[1861.96 - 1865.68] chicken and they're cutting chicken up
[1864.20 - 1867.08] and it's on The Cutting Board and all
[1865.68 - 1868.72] that and they take a sponge and they
[1867.08 - 1871.20] clean it all up and everything and you
[1868.72 - 1872.36] come along and you now actually do stuff
[1871.20 - 1874.52] on The Cutting Board you got some
[1872.36 - 1878.12] lettuce on here or whatever it's like
[1874.52 - 1881.56] Russian Roulette in the worst way so one
[1878.12 - 1883.40] of the tips I have to offer which is
[1881.56 - 1886.24] definitely have a separate cutting board
[1883.40 - 1890.16] if it's at all possible or flip the
[1886.24 - 1892.36] board and mark the board so board
[1890.16 - 1894.80] flipping is my first tip of the day but
[1892.36 - 1896.44] we're going to go into mold and bacteria
[1894.80 - 1899.32] we're going to go into some other stuff
[1896.44 - 1901.40] too we we ain't done with just flipping
[1899.32 - 1902.72] the board that's not the only thing
[1901.40 - 1905.08] we're going to talk
[1902.72 - 1907.96] about all
[1905.08 - 1909.88] right so say I'm cooking a chicken here
[1907.96 - 1912.04] on this
[1909.88 - 1913.28] board and I'm actually are cooking a
[1912.04 - 1915.32] chicken preparing a chicken and I'm
[1913.28 - 1918.36] cutting it up and it's raw and it's all
[1915.32 - 1919.64] raw chicken on here
[1918.36 - 1921.36] and you don't have another cutting board
[1919.64 - 1923.04] in the house but somebody does that you
[1921.36 - 1925.64] don't want to actually you know use that
[1923.04 - 1929.16] board you want to learn how to flip the
[1925.64 - 1931.00] board but you want to mark the board so
[1929.16 - 1933.04] you want to make sure you put a
[1931.00 - 1934.80] permanent marker somewhere on the edge
[1933.04 - 1937.80] that points an arrow
[1934.80 - 1939.76] down or points an arrow in a certain
[1937.80 - 1941.92] direction that arrow pointing in a
[1939.76 - 1942.92] certain direction will be your side of
[1941.92 - 1945.08] the
[1942.92 - 1947.24] board that's a really helpful thing to
[1945.08 - 1949.00] do so when someone's done and you want
[1947.24 - 1952.08] to make your food and someone actually
[1949.00 - 1954.00] had raw meat on the board some type of
[1952.08 - 1958.12] animal product or chicken on the board
[1954.00 - 1959.72] you can flip it after they did it and
[1958.12 - 1961.12] you got it I see someone talking about
[1959.72 - 1962.92] peroxide and we're going to talk about
[1961.12 - 1964.44] peroxide in the board peroxide ain't the
[1962.92 - 1967.68] only
[1964.44 - 1968.84] answer so that's one tip all on its own
[1967.68 - 1971.96] if you have somebody in the family
[1968.84 - 1973.52] that's actually using something deadly
[1971.96 - 1976.72] like raw
[1973.52 - 1978.96] chicken because raw chicken obviously
[1976.72 - 1980.44] can kill a lot of people it has in the
[1978.96 - 1983.36] past it just
[1980.44 - 1985.44] does it's not an anti-chicken talk it's
[1983.36 - 1987.32] just a fact anybody who loves chicken
[1985.44 - 1989.12] and eats chicken they have to be careful
[1987.32 - 1991.48] or they can get in trouble and they can
[1989.12 - 1994.96] get really
[1991.48 - 1997.28] sick so when it comes down to cutting
[1994.96 - 2000.12] boards here's one tip that's very
[1997.28 - 2003.48] important you don't want to get wetness
[2000.12 - 2004.76] under your cutting board if your cutting
[2003.48 - 2007.20] board sitting there on the counter and
[2004.76 - 2008.08] it's a wood cutting board or any kind
[2007.20 - 2010.96] would cuz that's what we're talking
[2008.08 - 2012.52] about today you don't want it moist or
[2010.96 - 2014.00] damp underneath the cutting board so
[2012.52 - 2015.68] what you want to do on the counter with
[2014.00 - 2021.28] your cutting board
[2015.68 - 2024.32] is you want to take a dry
[2021.28 - 2027.88] towel and you want to get the board off
[2024.32 - 2032.04] the counter a little bit with the dry
[2027.88 - 2034.92] towel so you got your board on a
[2032.04 - 2037.76] towel what this does is if you have
[2034.92 - 2041.12] drippage so you cut up tomato es you cut
[2037.76 - 2044.92] up something wet something juicy you cut
[2041.12 - 2047.04] up fruit apples you're cutting lemons
[2044.92 - 2048.24] and then dripping or you're using water
[2047.04 - 2052.00] on your board for some reason you're
[2048.24 - 2053.04] cleaning it and the drips then roll down
[2052.00 - 2055.20] go
[2053.04 - 2057.24] down and they end up going under the
[2055.20 - 2061.40] board they travel under the board and
[2057.24 - 2063.60] mold starts to happen very quickly like
[2061.40 - 2065.88] instantaneously mold will start to grow
[2063.60 - 2069.32] underneath your cutting
[2065.88 - 2072.16] board now mold does some weird stuff
[2069.32 - 2076.40] mold can travel through
[2072.16 - 2079.36] wood without it even looking like it can
[2076.40 - 2081.28] mold doesn't just get down to say a
[2079.36 - 2085.68] millimeter layer inside your cutting
[2081.28 - 2087.72] board mold can travel through the board
[2085.68 - 2090.24] how does it travel through the
[2087.72 - 2092.00] board most everybody's cutting boards
[2090.24 - 2094.68] are not one
[2092.00 - 2098.08] piece they're glued
[2094.68 - 2101.92] together cutting boards are multiple
[2098.08 - 2105.44] pieces glued together that's the cutting
[2101.92 - 2109.04] boards are now long gone are the days
[2105.44 - 2112.60] where there was Old Oaks and old wood
[2109.04 - 2115.44] old growth wood where you cut this one
[2112.60 - 2118.84] piece and that's your cutting board this
[2115.44 - 2118.84] one piece of
[2119.00 - 2129.04] wood cutting boards are pieces put
[2124.68 - 2130.04] together mold will travel without it
[2129.04 - 2134.08] being
[2130.04 - 2138.16] seen through each
[2134.08 - 2141.76] slab right through the glue mold loves
[2138.16 - 2146.36] glue the glue used for cutting
[2141.76 - 2148.60] boards it actually can use glue to
[2146.36 - 2151.36] travel and so even though that glue is
[2148.60 - 2155.80] hard and that board is pressed
[2151.36 - 2157.32] together mold can still grow through the
[2155.80 - 2159.92] glue
[2157.32 - 2161.56] and get deep into your board you might
[2159.92 - 2163.20] be somebody that's like well only one
[2161.56 - 2165.32] side of my board has mold I'm going to
[2163.20 - 2167.12] flip the board over and a lot of people
[2165.32 - 2169.76] do that I can't afford to get another
[2167.12 - 2172.08] board right now so I'm going to flip the
[2169.76 - 2173.68] board over and the moldy side of the
[2172.08 - 2175.64] board is there I like that I like when
[2173.68 - 2177.44] people do that that's a good thing you
[2175.64 - 2178.56] can do you can flip your board and have
[2177.44 - 2180.80] the
[2178.56 - 2183.16] mold on the other
[2180.80 - 2185.04] side eventually though the mold will
[2183.16 - 2187.16] grow through the glue and you won't see
[2185.04 - 2190.00] the mold on your other side your clean
[2187.16 - 2192.00] side but it will be
[2190.00 - 2195.40] there it'll
[2192.00 - 2197.32] be within the glue itself through each
[2195.40 - 2199.68] section of the
[2197.32 - 2201.36] board another thing about mold and
[2199.68 - 2203.20] cutting boards is there's people out
[2201.36 - 2205.08] there that are mold
[2203.20 - 2206.60] freaks they're making sure there's no
[2205.08 - 2208.16] mold in their house there's no mold
[2206.60 - 2209.72] under their kitchen counter sinks
[2208.16 - 2211.76] there's no mold in their bathrooms
[2209.72 - 2214.16] there's no mold in their
[2211.76 - 2216.00] showers they got mold meters and the
[2214.16 - 2219.56] mold meters are actually saying there's
[2216.00 - 2220.32] no mold in their house but their board
[2219.56 - 2223.36] is
[2220.32 - 2225.72] moldy and they don't even know it they
[2223.36 - 2227.32] have a moldy
[2225.72 - 2231.20] board
[2227.32 - 2234.52] now let's go into what we can lay on a
[2231.20 - 2237.76] board what we can put on a board you're
[2234.52 - 2240.16] thinking you got to oil up your
[2237.76 - 2243.40] board first thing that happens when you
[2240.16 - 2244.76] get a brand new cutting board is you're
[2243.40 - 2246.32] probably told or you're probably
[2244.76 - 2248.60] thinking that you got to oil up the
[2246.32 - 2248.60] board
[2248.80 - 2253.44] so you got to drop a little bit on there
[2250.68 - 2255.04] so let's put a little on here right here
[2253.44 - 2257.84] I'll show you two with a little close-up
[2255.04 - 2258.68] maybe we could get but I'll put a little
[2257.84 - 2261.28] bit
[2258.68 - 2263.28] on put a lot more on there cuz people
[2261.28 - 2266.64] put olive oil on their boards but I'm
[2263.28 - 2271.60] not telling you to put olive oil on your
[2266.64 - 2273.44] boards my boards stay dry and oil free
[2271.60 - 2276.00] not because I'm afraid of olive oil I'm
[2273.44 - 2278.00] not afraid of olive oil not because I'm
[2276.00 - 2281.08] afraid of pemp oil not because I'm
[2278.00 - 2283.08] afraid of walnut oil not because I'm
[2281.08 - 2284.92] afraid of avocado oil not because I'm
[2283.08 - 2289.00] afraid of coconut
[2284.92 - 2292.84] oil when you put oil on your cutting
[2289.00 - 2296.64] boards you're proliferating the bacteria
[2292.84 - 2300.52] levels and you're proliferating the mold
[2296.64 - 2302.96] levels so when you lay oil on your
[2300.52 - 2308.04] boards you're
[2302.96 - 2310.52] encapsulating mold and bacteria
[2308.04 - 2311.72] in between the oil and the wood and then
[2310.52 - 2315.08] the
[2311.72 - 2316.28] bacteria stays alive and preserved
[2315.08 - 2319.24] within the
[2316.28 - 2322.68] oil and then
[2319.24 - 2326.08] grows it grows it spawns couple of
[2322.68 - 2328.76] things go on that bacteria has
[2326.08 - 2330.92] oxygent that's on the surface of the air
[2328.76 - 2335.00] and mixed in the oil when you rub it in
[2330.92 - 2337.60] so you're rubbing oxygen into the board
[2335.00 - 2339.44] oxygen doesn't necess necessarily stop
[2337.60 - 2341.68] bacteria from growing that's how how it
[2339.44 - 2344.72] works at
[2341.68 - 2347.12] all in this situation you're rubbing the
[2344.72 - 2349.16] oil base with the oxygen and you're
[2347.12 - 2350.80] mixing it all up with the bacteria
[2349.16 - 2353.56] you're shoving it down into the wood
[2350.80 - 2356.36] fibers and bacteria is really
[2353.56 - 2358.88] small and you think you got a nice clean
[2356.36 - 2361.60] oily surface now and instead you got
[2358.88 - 2364.76] bacteria growing inside your board
[2361.60 - 2366.96] underneath the oil in the oil inside the
[2364.76 - 2369.44] the wood fibers
[2366.96 - 2373.00] in the wood pulp you have bacteria
[2369.44 - 2376.00] growing I don't recommend
[2373.00 - 2379.76] oiling or fattening up your
[2376.00 - 2384.00] boards it's not a good idea you can't
[2379.76 - 2387.04] kill bacteria well the oil will also go
[2384.00 - 2389.40] deep down into the first or second layer
[2387.04 - 2391.36] a good millimeter maybe even 2 millimet
[2389.40 - 2395.24] of your board maybe even 3 mm of your
[2391.36 - 2398.12] board and harbor and safe hold lots of
[2395.24 - 2400.68] bacteria and mold
[2398.12 - 2402.32] so you think you got a clean board I'm
[2400.68 - 2403.80] going to rub the oil on here right there
[2402.32 - 2405.96] you think you got a clean board you
[2403.80 - 2409.16] think you're you oiled it up nice you
[2405.96 - 2411.84] protected it oiled up your board and all
[2409.16 - 2415.68] you did was create a playground and a
[2411.84 - 2418.88] petri dish your board becomes a petri
[2415.68 - 2422.56] dish for
[2418.88 - 2425.00] bacteria viruses if they're
[2422.56 - 2427.08] there if somebody cut their finger while
[2425.00 - 2428.28] cooking and they got an epine bar
[2427.08 - 2431.44] somebody cut their finger while they're
[2428.28 - 2433.76] cooking and they got hsv1 2 someone cut
[2431.44 - 2437.60] their finger and they got hhv7 whatever
[2433.76 - 2439.80] it is it's in the board ceglar virus HPV
[2437.60 - 2441.68] it's in the board because it's not going
[2439.80 - 2443.28] to die it's going to sit in the board on
[2441.68 - 2444.84] the board and the oil is going to
[2443.28 - 2446.48] preserve it and keep it there for quite
[2444.84 - 2449.52] a long
[2446.48 - 2453.40] time and it might even procreate while
[2449.52 - 2455.56] it's actually there bacteria will for
[2453.40 - 2456.92] sure so I'm giving you this little
[2455.56 - 2458.68] tidbit right here which is very
[2456.92 - 2460.76] important and valuable which is don't
[2458.68 - 2463.44] oil up your
[2460.76 - 2466.16] boards don't grease them up oil them up
[2463.44 - 2468.32] don't avocado oil them up don't walnut
[2466.16 - 2471.56] oil them up don't cookon oil oil them up
[2468.32 - 2475.32] don't sesame seed oil them up
[2471.56 - 2478.36] don't don't oil them up and don't pork
[2475.32 - 2480.48] fat them don't Crisco them don't stick
[2478.36 - 2484.76] some other kind of oil don't vegetable
[2480.48 - 2487.24] oil them either Lane says wow wow now I
[2484.76 - 2492.48] realized I didn't have problems with
[2487.24 - 2495.16] mold until properly oiled the
[2492.48 - 2498.80] board oiling your
[2495.16 - 2501.72] board will create a mold Fest and a
[2498.80 - 2504.20] bacteria Fest in and on your board
[2501.72 - 2505.96] eventually also possibly getting through
[2504.20 - 2508.76] your
[2505.96 - 2511.12] home
[2508.76 - 2512.64] okay are you guys liking the tip so far
[2511.12 - 2514.96] or no should I keep
[2512.64 - 2517.88] going should I keep
[2514.96 - 2521.36] going all right Right cleaning board
[2517.88 - 2524.16] let's hit it you want your board dry you
[2521.36 - 2527.60] want your board clean that's what you
[2524.16 - 2531.40] want always have a sponge designated for
[2527.60 - 2533.64] the board the sponge was in the toilet
[2531.40 - 2535.68] and in the bathroom I accidentally
[2533.64 - 2537.88] designated this one for the bathroom and
[2535.68 - 2540.76] for the
[2537.88 - 2543.96] toilet and uh but that's okay I'll
[2540.76 - 2547.24] squeeze it out that's all right we'll
[2543.96 - 2550.60] clean this board this sponge was in the
[2547.24 - 2552.56] toilet clean in the toilet and the sink
[2550.60 - 2554.60] their boogers in the sink that people
[2552.56 - 2557.12] have and everything else and just all in
[2554.60 - 2560.40] there and make sure you want to
[2557.12 - 2561.64] designate a sponge specifically for your
[2560.40 - 2564.00] cutting
[2561.64 - 2566.24] boards that's your
[2564.00 - 2568.64] sponge that sponge isn't for your
[2566.24 - 2571.36] counters that sponge is not for your
[2568.64 - 2573.92] counters really important tip you
[2571.36 - 2575.44] guys you don't want that sponge for this
[2573.92 - 2576.76] right you don't want this I'm going to
[2575.44 - 2578.92] just do this here here I'm going to do
[2576.76 - 2581.84] this I'm going to do
[2578.92 - 2583.28] this oh yeah I got to get this clean I
[2581.84 - 2586.20] don't want anybody seeing this dirty
[2583.28 - 2588.32] here give a good wipe I got to get this
[2586.20 - 2590.64] cutting board done now too let's do this
[2588.32 - 2593.96] right here let's get the cutting
[2590.64 - 2595.52] board yeah you see it everywhere you see
[2593.96 - 2600.12] everybody doing it it's like yeah get
[2595.52 - 2602.52] the counters this done this this this
[2600.12 - 2604.72] let me do the sink over
[2602.52 - 2606.72] here never do
[2604.72 - 2609.96] that never
[2606.72 - 2612.36] do that reminds me of people that like
[2609.96 - 2614.68] they're so anal and OCD about something
[2612.36 - 2616.24] a certain something and mean something
[2614.68 - 2619.00] else it's just like
[2616.24 - 2620.32] what do you ever run into that out there
[2619.00 - 2621.52] there's people out there they're so anal
[2620.32 - 2624.00] about something like so anal about
[2621.52 - 2625.68] something like off the charts right but
[2624.00 - 2629.20] then all of a sudden they got this going
[2625.68 - 2629.20] on and they're doing this it's like
[2629.76 - 2633.60] what I've seen people like don't dirty
[2631.96 - 2635.76] up my car don't put a single thing on
[2633.60 - 2637.88] the floor don't get sand in my car floor
[2635.76 - 2639.52] don't get dust on my car what is that is
[2637.88 - 2641.92] that a bag of chips don't get the grease
[2639.52 - 2644.08] from the bag of chips on the
[2641.92 - 2645.68] thing but I'm going to go pick up a
[2644.08 - 2647.16] piece of gum off a sidewalk and they'll
[2645.68 - 2649.56] just throw it in their mouth and chew it
[2647.16 - 2651.80] up you don't think people do that no
[2649.56 - 2654.28] they don't but they go and do other
[2651.80 - 2655.88] things they go on to a kissing Fest
[2654.28 - 2657.32] maybe they go into a kissing Fest where
[2655.88 - 2659.60] they're kissing
[2657.32 - 2661.84] people they got their mouth inside
[2659.60 - 2664.36] somebody else's mouth they're exchanging
[2661.84 - 2666.68] every single microb and bacteria and
[2664.36 - 2668.52] virus and meanwhile you get in their car
[2666.68 - 2670.20] they're screaming at you because you
[2668.52 - 2672.80] actually touch your your feet to the
[2670.20 - 2672.80] floor of the
[2673.72 - 2680.28] car you want a designated sponge for
[2677.72 - 2682.68] your cutting
[2680.28 - 2685.84] board you just do all right let's go
[2682.68 - 2685.84] into some cleaning of The Cutting
[2687.48 - 2693.72] Board cleaning dry and
[2691.00 - 2695.68] clean you want the wood dry now what
[2693.72 - 2696.80] you'll see out there mainstream is no
[2695.68 - 2699.36] the
[2696.80 - 2702.60] wood will be ruined your cutting board
[2699.36 - 2704.96] will be ruined you just bought a brand
[2702.60 - 2707.68] new wooden cutting board and you're
[2704.96 - 2710.48] going to keep it all dry like that where
[2707.68 - 2712.56] it's dry how are you going to do that
[2710.48 - 2715.08] you got to oil that board man you're
[2712.56 - 2716.28] you're destroying your cutting board
[2715.08 - 2717.88] you'll hear that out there that's the
[2716.28 - 2720.88] mainstream
[2717.88 - 2720.88] view
[2720.92 - 2726.60] mainstream isn't always right you want
[2724.40 - 2728.16] your board dry
[2726.60 - 2729.60] to the bone of course it's going to be
[2728.16 - 2730.96] wet when it's wet because you're using
[2729.60 - 2731.96] your designated sponge and you're
[2730.96 - 2733.24] cleaning it and everything and we're
[2731.96 - 2734.76] going to go into that like what do you
[2733.24 - 2736.92] use to clean your board so let's head
[2734.76 - 2739.88] there too but first of all you want your
[2736.92 - 2742.56] board dry no oil and you want it where
[2739.88 - 2744.64] the board looks like it's starting to
[2742.56 - 2747.72] bleach but you're not bleaching your
[2744.64 - 2749.24] board with a bleach which takes me to
[2747.72 - 2750.68] the another another level there what are
[2749.24 - 2753.08] you cleaning your board
[2750.68 - 2755.32] with you want something that's going to
[2753.08 - 2757.88] clean your board but you want something
[2755.32 - 2757.88] that's not
[2758.40 - 2763.32] toxic you want something that can help
[2760.72 - 2767.36] clean it but not toxic and the lemon
[2763.32 - 2769.80] juice Theory it's a cute
[2767.36 - 2771.52] one where you put lemon juice on the
[2769.80 - 2773.68] board I've seen people do raw meat on
[2771.52 - 2776.16] the board and then they squeeze lemon
[2773.68 - 2780.68] afterwards and they wash it down with
[2776.16 - 2780.68] lemon juice and they're like done that's
[2781.12 - 2786.32] clean that's not
[2783.28 - 2789.48] enough I just saw lemon on I with a
[2786.32 - 2794.24] question lemon question it's not
[2789.48 - 2797.20] enough you want nothing on here no food
[2794.24 - 2799.92] no fruit no vegetable
[2797.20 - 2803.88] juice no
[2799.92 - 2805.36] oils nothing but water but you still
[2803.88 - 2806.72] need to clean the board so here's one of
[2805.36 - 2808.16] the tricks your board will end up
[2806.72 - 2809.68] collecting things lots of different
[2808.16 - 2812.16] things on top of your hardened food
[2809.68 - 2814.24] different stuff and after you've taken
[2812.16 - 2816.68] off the stuff that's loose you take off
[2814.24 - 2818.32] all the stuff that's loose okay
[2816.68 - 2821.80] after you do
[2818.32 - 2826.36] that you want to get water on your
[2821.80 - 2830.68] board you want water water becomes a
[2826.36 - 2832.52] killer for microbes not a thriver check
[2830.68 - 2834.72] this out nobody knows this stuff it's
[2832.52 - 2837.32] it's all mm
[2834.72 - 2840.08] info mm
[2837.32 - 2843.52] info what is
[2840.08 - 2843.52] it mm
[2843.76 - 2850.12] info okay water
[2846.60 - 2853.96] is an inhibitor why water swells the
[2850.12 - 2853.96] wood it swells the
[2855.08 - 2862.84] wood it swells it that swelling of the
[2859.52 - 2865.00] wood brings out Bug Killers naturally in
[2862.84 - 2868.92] the
[2865.00 - 2871.20] tree so you want water on your board but
[2868.92 - 2873.88] you don't want
[2871.20 - 2876.08] oil what happens is the water on the
[2873.88 - 2879.36] board is going to loosen up Harden food
[2876.08 - 2881.96] Harden this juices from things that are
[2879.36 - 2883.24] in there it's going to harden it's what
[2881.96 - 2885.12] it's going to do is it's going to soften
[2883.24 - 2886.52] up the wood and it's going to loosen up
[2885.12 - 2888.88] the hardened things that are on your
[2886.52 - 2892.24] board and then you take off the hardened
[2888.88 - 2896.16] stuff you do your sponge
[2892.24 - 2898.48] right you can get some more water on
[2896.16 - 2902.24] here and get it on here but what happens
[2898.48 - 2904.84] is the wood swells and the
[2902.24 - 2908.20] antimicrobials come out of the wood
[2904.84 - 2909.96] antimicrobial are naturally inside this
[2908.20 - 2912.88] wood
[2909.96 - 2915.68] forever you can have a cutting board
[2912.88 - 2918.56] that's 30 years old 40 years old in your
[2915.68 - 2921.20] family line and that wood will still
[2918.56 - 2923.36] have antimicrobials in here forever
[2921.20 - 2926.16] sitting in here but you can't access
[2923.36 - 2928.32] them cuz you ain't got the key if you're
[2926.16 - 2931.76] putting oil all over your board you'll
[2928.32 - 2935.08] never access them it's never going to
[2931.76 - 2938.12] happen you keep your boards wet with oil
[2935.08 - 2939.88] you're never never going to access the
[2938.12 - 2941.28] antimicrobials they're not going to come
[2939.88 - 2943.60] out and
[2941.28 - 2946.04] play when you keep that board dry and
[2943.60 - 2948.16] clean and you put water in that board to
[2946.04 - 2949.76] clean it what happens is and you leave
[2948.16 - 2951.84] it even if it's for a couple of minutes
[2949.76 - 2954.24] when you're cleaning a few minutes your
[2951.84 - 2956.84] wood starts to swell when your wood
[2954.24 - 2960.28] starts to swell the
[2956.84 - 2962.88] antimicrobials are now leeching out
[2960.28 - 2966.52] they're leeching out and they're killing
[2962.88 - 2968.60] stuff naturally killing stuff so nothing
[2966.52 - 2972.32] can live deep within the wood of the
[2968.60 - 2972.32] board and harbor itself
[2973.68 - 2977.52] there you get your board
[2979.00 - 2985.60] clean take a hand
[2981.64 - 2985.60] towel and dry it up
[2988.60 - 2993.68] now now say that
[2991.48 - 2995.16] wasn't say you're somebody you had raw
[2993.68 - 2997.28] chicken on your board you had beef on
[2995.16 - 2998.28] your board board you had raw fish on
[2997.28 - 3001.88] your
[2998.28 - 3005.00] board you want to clean it like this but
[3001.88 - 3005.00] then you want to do something
[3007.12 - 3010.88] else you want to bring
[3011.76 - 3017.92] in the hydrogen
[3014.72 - 3020.32] peroxide this one hasn't been opened yet
[3017.92 - 3024.32] I'm going to open it I'm going to give
[3020.32 - 3024.32] you a play bypl as I try to open
[3024.44 - 3027.44] this
[3028.04 - 3031.52] okay now we got
[3032.00 - 3036.68] peroxide
[3033.64 - 3040.68] peroxide won't
[3036.68 - 3044.68] destroy the wood's ability to release
[3040.68 - 3047.68] antimicrobials keep that in mind bleach
[3044.68 - 3050.08] will you don't want to use bleach or
[3047.68 - 3050.92] toxic cleaners especially bleach on top
[3050.08 - 3054.16] of your
[3050.92 - 3057.12] boards bleach will destroy your natural
[3054.16 - 3060.00] anti microb Rials that lie within the
[3057.12 - 3064.24] wood surface and deep within the wood of
[3060.00 - 3067.24] the tree a tree will have a lifetime of
[3064.24 - 3070.56] antimicrobials built into it that will
[3067.24 - 3074.56] seep out right peroxide won't destroy
[3070.56 - 3074.56] that so you put your peroxide on the
[3075.44 - 3080.24] board you can take your sponge that's
[3077.80 - 3082.16] designated for your board and you can
[3080.24 - 3083.80] move that peroxide around your board
[3082.16 - 3087.60] just like
[3083.80 - 3090.88] this and you can start making sure you
[3087.60 - 3092.80] kill that chicken salmonella that eoli
[3090.88 - 3095.20] from the beef and
[3092.80 - 3098.04] whatever you want to get that peroxide
[3095.20 - 3101.56] on here just like I just did right there
[3098.04 - 3104.20] okay give it some time Ivon says
[3101.56 - 3104.20] unbelievable
[3104.40 - 3110.04] information unbelievable
[3107.08 - 3117.36] comment thank
[3110.04 - 3117.36] you over here boom boom boom I like that
[3118.96 - 3125.32] boom boom
[3121.76 - 3129.44] boom I like it all right that's peroxide
[3125.32 - 3131.40] on the board ready take a towel you
[3129.44 - 3135.96] should watch this live a bunch of times
[3131.40 - 3138.40] because it might go in one ear
[3135.96 - 3139.76] right and might go out the other ear by
[3138.40 - 3141.16] accident some of this stuff there's a
[3139.76 - 3144.76] lot of info I just cleaned off the
[3141.16 - 3146.08] proide but that's not all now get some
[3144.76 - 3149.32] water on it
[3146.08 - 3152.80] rinse out your sponge your designated
[3149.32 - 3155.76] sponge rinse out your designated
[3152.80 - 3158.84] sponge now take off the residue of the
[3155.76 - 3160.76] peroxide with
[3158.84 - 3163.76] water like
[3160.76 - 3163.76] that
[3163.92 - 3170.04] done done that's
[3167.08 - 3173.04] it your wood will swell the
[3170.04 - 3174.64] antimicrobials will come out strong used
[3173.04 - 3177.24] a little bit of peroxide on there
[3174.64 - 3177.24] amazing
[3177.28 - 3182.60] Natasha says thank you so so so much for
[3179.24 - 3184.60] this information wow wow wow
[3182.60 - 3187.00] wow all
[3184.60 - 3189.68] right so I want to go into a little bit
[3187.00 - 3192.40] more of some other things say you do you
[3189.68 - 3193.56] can't afford another cutting board you
[3192.40 - 3195.64] don't have the money you don't have the
[3193.56 - 3198.36] budget but your cutting board has mold
[3195.64 - 3200.16] on it you can see the mold on it what
[3198.36 - 3202.08] happens is that with a lot of people the
[3200.16 - 3204.16] mold usually starts on the other side of
[3202.08 - 3206.48] the board like this the back of the
[3204.16 - 3208.52] board you have to have that towel
[3206.48 - 3209.76] underneath your board because the juices
[3208.52 - 3212.16] of whatever you're doing are going to
[3209.76 - 3214.84] most likely end up soak falling down
[3212.16 - 3216.64] here and soaking underneath the board in
[3214.84 - 3219.32] the counter and it's going to sit there
[3216.64 - 3222.52] and fester and it's going to soak itself
[3219.32 - 3225.68] back into the board
[3222.52 - 3228.08] right and you don't want to do that you
[3225.68 - 3230.64] want to have that Bo that that towel and
[3228.08 - 3234.16] then you want to change that towel every
[3230.64 - 3236.16] like week or 4 days or 5 days you want
[3234.16 - 3238.60] to change the towel flip it out get a
[3236.16 - 3242.08] new towel down put your board down I got
[3238.60 - 3242.08] to check the crinkle cut fries hold
[3242.12 - 3249.60] on nice sprinkle cut fries are in the
[3246.40 - 3251.44] works I might even pump this up a little
[3249.60 - 3254.20] bit remember that question you had
[3251.44 - 3258.28] before like what do you want your oven
[3254.20 - 3259.60] at I said 375 to 4 and A4 I'm playing
[3258.28 - 3262.28] with 4 and a qu right now I'm playing
[3259.60 - 3263.24] with fire I got the crinkle cut fries
[3262.28 - 3266.16] going in
[3263.24 - 3267.48] there okay I'm trying to remember is
[3266.16 - 3270.40] there anything else about the cutting
[3267.48 - 3272.36] boards I want to tell you on this show I
[3270.40 - 3276.60] think there can be there are a couple of
[3272.36 - 3278.88] things okay oh yeah there
[3276.60 - 3281.88] is
[3278.88 - 3285.00] duh
[3281.88 - 3289.40] okay when you oil your
[3285.00 - 3293.00] boards you end up splintering your
[3289.40 - 3296.00] wood last thing you need is splinters
[3293.00 - 3298.20] you can't really see going in a family
[3296.00 - 3301.72] member's throat and getting stuck in
[3298.20 - 3303.64] there does it happen yeah it does ever
[3301.72 - 3305.48] hear of somebody having a a something
[3303.64 - 3307.60] going on with their
[3305.48 - 3311.12] throat
[3307.60 - 3313.28] right it can happen little splinters can
[3311.12 - 3315.20] get in places we can swallow the wood
[3313.28 - 3317.52] splinters they can get hung up and
[3315.20 - 3320.96] jammed into the intestinal tract lining
[3317.52 - 3322.80] for a year and just sit there the lining
[3320.96 - 3325.44] and then the the intestinal tract just
[3322.80 - 3326.84] calluses over it eventually and it
[3325.44 - 3330.04] becomes a
[3326.84 - 3333.16] pup in the intestinal
[3330.04 - 3336.16] tract the point is the oilbased
[3333.16 - 3337.44] surfaces eventually weaken the wood to
[3336.16 - 3341.04] such a
[3337.44 - 3342.68] point where it splinters so much easier
[3341.04 - 3344.32] when you're cutting and chopping so keep
[3342.68 - 3347.20] that in mind you'll end up splintering
[3344.32 - 3347.20] without even seeing
[3348.48 - 3354.00] it let's see here's a question over in
[3350.56 - 3355.68] IG can you run it under the water in the
[3354.00 - 3358.48] sink
[3355.68 - 3360.20] two if the board is smaller or it's
[3358.48 - 3362.08] better to just wait you can run it you
[3360.20 - 3364.40] can run it under sink you can run it
[3362.08 - 3365.64] under the sink if you can or want to
[3364.40 - 3368.96] just make sure the other side of the
[3365.64 - 3371.20] board is dry before you place the board
[3368.96 - 3372.72] down on your counter on that towel on
[3371.20 - 3374.80] your
[3372.72 - 3376.36] counter here's something very important
[3374.80 - 3377.80] about the cutting boards another tip I
[3376.36 - 3380.04] think I should say is the reason why you
[3377.80 - 3382.32] want to towel towel underneath your
[3380.04 - 3384.96] board too you don't want your board
[3382.32 - 3386.96] sliding so when you're cutting fruits
[3384.96 - 3388.72] and vegetables and meat and poultry or
[3386.96 - 3390.72] whatever you're cutting and chopping up
[3388.72 - 3392.64] you don't want the board accidentally
[3390.72 - 3394.56] moving on you and you cut your wrist cut
[3392.64 - 3397.36] your hand cut your
[3394.56 - 3399.48] finger so why I like the towel a nice
[3397.36 - 3400.72] towel underneath the board that's one
[3399.48 - 3403.28] thing that's really important too people
[3400.72 - 3403.28] don't know
[3405.72 - 3409.60] that your board's going to get less
[3407.84 - 3411.60] damage by the way in last longer if you
[3409.60 - 3413.08] don't oil it it's the opposite to what
[3411.60 - 3414.88] they say so they say your board will
[3413.08 - 3417.68] last forever if you oil it but your
[3414.88 - 3419.84] board will actually weaken go moldy
[3417.68 - 3422.20] become problematic become a bacterial
[3419.84 - 3422.20] ridden
[3422.48 - 3428.40] board and it'll start to wear out too
[3425.68 - 3428.40] faster than it
[3428.68 - 3435.28] should did you ever hear of a
[3432.68 - 3437.08] tree that's in a
[3435.28 - 3439.44] river
[3437.08 - 3443.80] underwater and it's
[3439.44 - 3445.32] petrified did you ever hear about a tree
[3443.80 - 3447.48] that
[3445.32 - 3450.24] and I wasn't even thinking of this like
[3447.48 - 3453.48] so is giving me this right now you ever
[3450.24 - 3454.60] you ever hear about a tree that falls
[3453.48 - 3456.72] into a
[3454.60 - 3461.16] lake and it's
[3456.72 - 3465.84] underwater it's in the mud and the
[3461.16 - 3468.08] water and it comes out of that Lake it's
[3465.84 - 3471.92] petrified or it can be
[3468.08 - 3473.44] used all the same as if it was cut down
[3471.92 - 3476.56] literally the
[3473.44 - 3479.48] 1865 they cut cut it down it was logged
[3476.56 - 3482.00] it got away it went down under the water
[3479.48 - 3483.72] it it lost track with all the other logs
[3482.00 - 3485.48] right and you pull that out do you guys
[3483.72 - 3488.12] know how this stuff works with wood and
[3485.48 - 3492.36] you pull that you can pull that oak tree
[3488.12 - 3494.64] out of the freaking River and pl it and
[3492.36 - 3494.64] cut
[3495.80 - 3498.80] it
[3498.92 - 3503.72] yeah it was
[3501.04 - 3509.00] water it was in the
[3503.72 - 3509.00] water not in the oil it wasn't in the
[3510.20 - 3516.16] oil so why do I prefer wood over plastic
[3514.60 - 3517.04] well plastic I don't like all the little
[3516.16 - 3519.96] plastic
[3517.04 - 3522.28] fibers they they peel off the board you
[3519.96 - 3523.80] chop it up you got plastic little pieces
[3522.28 - 3525.04] you can't see are everywhere and you
[3523.80 - 3527.04] know the whole plastic thing I won't
[3525.04 - 3528.40] give you guys a lecture on plastic you
[3527.04 - 3530.08] can read the medical me books I have
[3528.40 - 3531.52] lots of information about Plastics and
[3530.08 - 3534.28] medical me
[3531.52 - 3537.96] books right and when it comes down to
[3534.28 - 3541.80] the plastic boards you'll have a higher
[3537.96 - 3544.20] bacteria range Pro procreating on your
[3541.80 - 3547.08] boards it's something you don't want I
[3544.20 - 3548.76] prefer wood over plastic and even glass
[3547.08 - 3551.40] now glass I don't like because you don't
[3548.76 - 3555.24] know it but the glass
[3551.40 - 3556.68] shards are flaking they're flaking so
[3555.24 - 3558.72] here's what they do with glass so the
[3556.68 - 3560.32] glass cutting boards is they put a layer
[3558.72 - 3563.16] of plastic on your glass cutting board
[3560.32 - 3565.72] you guys know that there's a layer of
[3563.16 - 3567.60] plastic you can never see like Plexi
[3565.72 - 3571.12] like plexiglass over your glass cutting
[3567.60 - 3572.84] board over the glass you can't see it
[3571.12 - 3574.60] that's supposed to give that coating for
[3572.84 - 3576.40] you that chemical based coating while
[3574.60 - 3578.48] you're cooking and chopping and you're
[3576.40 - 3580.80] on your glass and all that eventually
[3578.48 - 3584.36] you'll be eating all that
[3580.80 - 3586.40] plexiglass plastic crap petroleum based
[3584.36 - 3588.56] product that they laced on your glass
[3586.40 - 3590.12] cutting board you'll be eating that with
[3588.56 - 3592.56] your sandwiches you'll be eating out
[3590.12 - 3594.76] with your food and then when that wears
[3592.56 - 3596.88] off guess what you guys you'll be eating
[3594.76 - 3598.36] glass chips not chips like the kind of
[3596.88 - 3600.00] chip where you chip a glass and it's a
[3598.36 - 3602.20] big chip and you see the chip fly or you
[3600.00 - 3604.52] see you get cut on a little sharp chck
[3602.20 - 3606.40] no when you use glass cutting boards you
[3604.52 - 3609.24] won't see it but they actually temper
[3606.40 - 3611.36] the glass so it doesn't shatter the same
[3609.24 - 3612.96] so what happens is little micr flakes of
[3611.36 - 3614.92] glass come off the glass cutting board
[3612.96 - 3617.52] that you can't see it's wear and tear
[3614.92 - 3619.44] that you can't see little tiny bits and
[3617.52 - 3621.44] you eat it you eat it you long before
[3619.44 - 3623.00] you won't even know it 10 years later
[3621.44 - 3624.36] you might start seeing something weird
[3623.00 - 3627.48] with your glass cutting board and you're
[3624.36 - 3631.56] like I just ate all that stuff for
[3627.48 - 3631.56] years Uma so
[3633.24 - 3637.20] live all right those french fries are
[3635.44 - 3639.52] are
[3637.20 - 3641.24] cooking okay I think I can start making
[3639.52 - 3642.64] food you guys there's more information
[3641.24 - 3646.12] about cutting boards I can give you guys
[3642.64 - 3648.56] and provide you guys there is we'll be
[3646.12 - 3651.12] here all day that's okay that's okay I
[3648.56 - 3654.88] wouldn't I'd rather be here all day than
[3651.12 - 3657.72] anywhere else and that's a fact Jack I'm
[3654.88 - 3657.72] going to put the cutting board
[3658.96 - 3663.20] down all right as long as I'm
[3663.96 - 3667.60] permitted
[3665.56 - 3668.88] okay so I think what I'm going to do
[3667.60 - 3671.48] while those french fries those crinkle
[3668.88 - 3672.80] cut fries are kicking ass in the oven I
[3671.48 - 3674.32] think what I'm going to do is I'm going
[3672.80 - 3676.20] to start making I'm going to start
[3674.32 - 3678.60] chopping up an onion that's going to go
[3676.20 - 3682.48] inside this Millet first of all I'm
[3678.60 - 3684.64] going to add some potato starch this is
[3682.48 - 3686.68] potato flakes oilfree
[3684.64 - 3688.28] oil flip free I'm going to add some of
[3686.68 - 3692.24] these in
[3688.28 - 3695.00] here recipe calls for a tablespoon or so
[3692.24 - 3697.16] I'm going to mix this Millet in right
[3695.00 - 3698.88] here with these
[3697.16 - 3702.76] potato
[3698.88 - 3702.76] flakes I'm going to chop up an
[3704.04 - 3708.00] onion okay I'm going to crank up the
[3706.32 - 3710.88] heat on this a little bit I'm going to
[3708.00 - 3712.56] add a little touch of
[3710.88 - 3714.20] water and I'm going to show you the
[3712.56 - 3718.28] recipe in the book here little touch of
[3714.20 - 3720.20] water in my Millet with the heat up says
[3718.28 - 3722.48] that in the book I think and
[3720.20 - 3723.52] then this is the recipe we're making
[3722.48 - 3724.72] look at that check this out but it's
[3723.52 - 3726.44] going to look a little different today
[3724.72 - 3728.72] because I got an assortment of leafy
[3726.44 - 3730.24] greens instead of iceberg lettuce I
[3728.72 - 3732.28] couldn't find a good iceberg lettuce in
[3730.24 - 3734.52] the store could not find one for the
[3732.28 - 3736.76] life of me sometimes they're really
[3734.52 - 3739.32] solid you just know you got a good one
[3736.76 - 3741.64] right but then it wasn't there though it
[3739.32 - 3743.52] just didn't happen so these are garden

[5071.04 - 5076.56] but we're we're getting
[5072.64 - 5079.84] there okay onig some people
[5076.56 - 5085.36] believe of the sulfur of garlic and
[5079.84 - 5085.36] onions cause bloating in gas is that
[5085.92 - 5094.36] true the sulfur and garlic and onions do
[5088.80 - 5094.36] not cause um bloating in gas
[5095.52 - 5103.20] garlic kills a lot of yeast and
[5100.40 - 5107.36] mold and a lot of unproductive
[5103.20 - 5110.48] fungus garlic kills a lot of microbes
[5107.36 - 5113.64] garlic kills bad
[5110.48 - 5116.00] bacteria and when you send raw garlic
[5113.64 - 5117.12] down and you're filled you're like
[5116.00 - 5119.92] you're
[5117.12 - 5121.48] overfilled or you got a pocket or two
[5119.92 - 5124.56] maybe a pocket or two that you haven't
[5121.48 - 5127.76] tapped into in inside your gut that
[5124.56 - 5127.76] garlic is going
[5128.84 - 5135.56] to Boom blow it up and all it takes is
[5133.76 - 5139.60] one microbe
[5135.56 - 5143.92] dying and that can give you some gas
[5139.60 - 5146.12] just one microbe dying can give you
[5143.92 - 5147.48] gas but it's not the sulfur that's
[5146.12 - 5149.76] giving people
[5147.48 - 5152.80] gas plus it's
[5149.76 - 5155.04] hell like hot spicy
[5152.80 - 5156.96] you name it too and that's that's a
[5155.04 - 5159.32] whole another thing um I can go into
[5156.96 - 5162.20] that in a second too so over here on IG
[5159.32 - 5164.48] I got a sponsored ad the other day
[5162.20 - 5166.60] trying to debunk info on celery juice
[5164.48 - 5166.60] and
[5167.08 - 5172.72] hmds
[5168.72 - 5176.16] yeah yeah it's like it's really stupid
[5172.72 - 5177.72] is what it is it's really dumb celery
[5176.16 - 5179.88] juice is literally saving lives around
[5177.72 - 5182.48] the planet the stores can't keep celery
[5179.88 - 5184.68] juice or celery in stock anymore they
[5182.48 - 5187.68] just can't they haven't been able to
[5184.68 - 5191.00] there was a celery shortage around the
[5187.68 - 5194.12] world roughly over 500 million people
[5191.00 - 5195.84] are drinking it on the day on The
[5194.12 - 5200.64] Daily
[5195.84 - 5203.88] okay celery juice doesn't
[5200.64 - 5207.36] make the scammers
[5203.88 - 5209.92] money you can't make money off of celery
[5207.36 - 5212.92] juice but you can make money off of
[5209.92 - 5216.40] ripping apart celery juice and leading
[5212.92 - 5218.68] them to something else you're
[5216.40 - 5221.40] selling what you'll find is people
[5218.68 - 5223.84] ripping down celery juice are usually
[5221.40 - 5227.20] selling something what are they selling
[5223.84 - 5229.08] products programs courses what are they
[5227.20 - 5230.80] selling it's like praying on the
[5229.08 - 5231.72] community that's people come in they
[5230.80 - 5233.76] come in the
[5231.72 - 5235.40] Sharks sometimes the sharks aren't baby
[5233.76 - 5237.92] sharks sometimes the sharks are bigger
[5235.40 - 5241.20] sharks and they come into the
[5237.92 - 5242.68] community and they try to brain you
[5241.20 - 5244.52] and that's what they do
[5242.68 - 5245.80] and they do nothing but and
[5244.52 - 5248.52] that's what they
[5245.80 - 5250.64] do they come in like that those those
[5248.52 - 5253.72] words are warranted for the situation
[5250.64 - 5256.92] they come in for and they use money in
[5253.72 - 5261.16] advertising and and what happens
[5256.92 - 5263.24] is it's like I know people that would be
[5261.16 - 5264.92] dead without celery juice out there I
[5263.24 - 5268.00] know people who got their intestinal
[5264.92 - 5270.04] tracks back to stabilization when they
[5268.00 - 5272.52] were in the worst situations they were
[5270.04 - 5274.84] on colostomy bags I know people people
[5272.52 - 5277.96] that celery juice restored their gut so
[5274.84 - 5279.40] they can digest a protein I know people
[5277.96 - 5281.84] they got rid of their acne got rid of
[5279.40 - 5284.84] this celery juice they acid reflux but
[5281.84 - 5288.44] celery juice is all of a sudden bad you
[5284.84 - 5288.44] can't make money off of celery
[5288.88 - 5294.24] juice but you can make money off of
[5292.00 - 5298.32] selling something you're selling but
[5294.24 - 5298.32] talk about celery juice at the same
[5299.76 - 5304.04] time just needs a couple more minutes
[5307.12 - 5311.64] here a lot of these people also take the
[5309.80 - 5313.00] medical medium original information at
[5311.64 - 5314.32] the same time you guys and they mix it
[5313.00 - 5315.24] up a little bit with their junk that
[5314.32 - 5317.40] they're
[5315.24 - 5319.08] selling they talk about binders or
[5317.40 - 5321.80] whatever whatever they just try to mess
[5319.08 - 5324.80] up people's heads and that's how it
[5321.80 - 5324.80] works
[5331.00 - 5333.72] yeah
[5332.52 - 5335.92] all right just cooking these a little
[5333.72 - 5339.08] bit longer what it is is I'm using this
[5335.92 - 5340.64] burner instead of the burner here so I
[5339.08 - 5342.80] might do that I actually might flip it
[5340.64 - 5345.44] onto this burner so I can get equal heat
[5342.80 - 5345.44] everywhere on
[5345.56 - 5349.44] there so that's what I'm going to do I'm
[5347.44 - 5353.60] going to flip this pan to the
[5349.44 - 5353.60] stove make sure there's nothing on the
[5354.20 - 5357.60] stove yeah we're
[5358.68 - 5363.28] good there are millions of people around
[5361.00 - 5366.96] the planet drinking s juice they needed
[5363.28 - 5366.96] every single day it's
[5368.56 - 5372.76] critical I mean critical for the
[5375.28 - 5380.96] recovery
[5376.96 - 5383.04] yeah including misinformation about
[5380.96 - 5385.40] hmds which they wouldn't even know about
[5383.04 - 5387.80] hmds anything anyway if it wasn't for
[5385.40 - 5389.92] medical medium information with all the
[5387.80 - 5391.64] Decades of putting heavy metal

[5391.64 - 5395.92] metal and toxic metal information out
[5393.84 - 5398.36] there all right I'm going to flip this
[5395.92 - 5400.64] onto
[5398.36 - 5403.40] here guys I'm putting on the big pan
[5400.64 - 5405.80] right here the big burner so I can

[5426.52 - 5431.56] sharks whatever the smaller sharks come
[5428.88 - 5435.68] in and what they do is they'll rip apart

[5650.12 - 5654.48] want to give you that close on this
[5654.96 - 5662.20] pan take a look see that that's the way
[5660.16 - 5665.16] you do it right there that's the way you
[5662.20 - 5665.16] want it look at
[5668.72 - 5672.12] that get them
[5677.00 - 5682.48] toasty
[5679.08 - 5685.76] okay I couldn't find celery yesterday at
[5682.48 - 5685.76] two stories two
[5687.88 - 5693.48] stores yeah this is
[5696.96 - 5699.96] Stefan
[5702.96 - 5709.44] yeah yes the sponsored ad was
[5706.88 - 5711.20] marketed yep to another person stuff
[5709.44 - 5712.88] yeah well that's what you know what
[5711.20 - 5715.16] happens is what they'll do is they'll
[5712.88 - 5717.04] they'll they're look the medical medum
[5715.16 - 5719.12] community is unlike anything else out
[5717.04 - 5721.00] there it doesn't you have to understand
[5719.12 - 5723.20] you guys there's no Community out there
[5721.00 - 5725.36] that exist exists like this community
[5723.20 - 5727.24] there just isn't because there isn't a
[5725.36 - 5729.68] community out there where that many
[5727.24 - 5731.56] people healed or are healing like that
[5729.68 - 5733.16] are really sick like chronically ill
[5731.56 - 5736.04] that doesn't exist out
[5733.16 - 5738.76] there and so because that doesn't exist
[5736.04 - 5740.64] this is the prime location though
[5738.76 - 5743.04] because the medical Med Community is a
[5740.64 - 5744.84] large community and it's and it's
[5743.04 - 5747.00] getting new people in all the time that
[5744.84 - 5748.08] are kind of like scared sitting on
[5747.00 - 5749.72] sitting on the fence they've been
[5748.08 - 5751.52] through hell out there and they're just
[5749.72 - 5753.00] starting to get their sea legs and
[5751.52 - 5754.56] they're just starting to come around
[5753.00 - 5755.88] where they're like you know they've been
[5754.56 - 5758.56] through so much and then it's the
[5755.88 - 5761.00] perfect place to shoot propaganda at
[5758.56 - 5762.40] them to lead them astray so then they
[5761.00 - 5765.20] get confused like I just started
[5762.40 - 5767.08] drinking celery and now what I just
[5765.20 - 5769.60] started drinking celery just and what's
[5767.08 - 5771.64] going to happen to me now like
