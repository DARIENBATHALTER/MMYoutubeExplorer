35
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,060
won't support any company unless they go

36
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:30,479
so Advanced and so ahead of the curve

37
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:32,820
and they do it in a way that's good for

38
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,259
the customer in every way possible and

39
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,700
that's what I'm talking about you guys

40
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:37,140
know I've worked with these guys because

41
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,700
of that I want this company to stick

42
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,259
around for The Chronic Leo because I

43
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,299
know the people behind the companies out

44
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:44,159
there I know what's going on behind the

45
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:47,420
scenes I talk to a lot of people and I

46
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,420
know the bull crap that's out there

47
00:01:53,759 --> 00:02:00,420
okay why is it so good so what you see

48
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,100
in front of me is a blender

49
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,140
and in this blender I'm going to make a

50
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,460
green smoothie we're gonna do three cups

51
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,320
we're going to get a decent amount of

52
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:10,319
mango in here one to two stalks of

53
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,360
celery four cups tightly packed spinach

54
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,580
and add a cup of water

55
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,560
we're gonna add this there we go

56
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,360
green smoothie with the immune powder

57
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,340
the micro C immune powder when you take

58
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,140
all that spinach with that vitamin C

59
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,200
together so all those trace minerals

60
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:28,200
from the spinach oh it's incredible

61
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,120
incredible there it is so not only are

62
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,040
you actually getting the micro C powder

63
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,840
collagen building effects right there

64
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,360
you're bringing it into the green

65
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,160
smoothie how good is that and what you

66
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,660
won't see in this green smoothie is a

67
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,239
whole bunch of fat you don't see a whole

68
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:44,400
bunch of oil put into here or coconut

69
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,800
oil because that inhibits what you're

70
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,000
trying to do you especially if you're

71
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,280
dealing with something or trying to

72
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,480
battle something or you got a cold or

73
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,519
you got something you're under the

74
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,560
weather you want something as clean as

75
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,480
this green smoothie without all the junk

76
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,940
in it not all these natural flavors we

77
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,459
need powerful tools what I call weapons

78
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:06,180
against the microbe world and what's

79
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:08,879

80
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,560
