[203.36 - 208.32] you need to sleep there's so many people
[206.40 - 210.00] with their sensitive nervous system they
[208.32 - 211.28] could hardly sleep anyway
[210.00 - 213.20] and the fact that they're just gonna be
[211.28 - 214.00] hearing these bombs blow off past
[213.20 - 215.36] midnight
[214.00 - 217.36] some neighborhoods they just blow them
[215.36 - 218.80] up cops don't do anything nobody does
[217.36 - 222.00] anything about it
[218.80 - 225.04] yeah yeah i mean the fireworks
[222.00 - 225.52] just before this should be just for the
[225.04 - 227.28] park
[225.52 - 229.20] that has it and then everybody goes
[227.28 - 230.48] there it should be for the beach or
[229.20 - 232.16] something and everybody goes there
[230.48 - 235.28] whatever
[232.16 - 236.96] i know i know i know i don't know what
[235.28 - 238.00] to say all i know is i have one dog in
[236.96 - 241.92] the closet shaking
[238.00 - 244.72] already had a seizure yeah and

[244.72 - 248.88] there but it's
[245.76 - 250.40] he's traumatized he's traumatized yeah
[248.88 - 252.56] so one dog in the closet having a
[250.40 - 253.04] seizure but this this dog's hanging in
[252.56 - 256.08] there but
[253.04 - 257.60] i don't think i think that over time it
[256.08 - 259.20] gets worse
[257.60 - 261.28] and then next year it's gonna be worse
[259.20 - 264.32] and then at other times of the year
[261.28 - 266.08] yeah i know i i think it's just a
[264.32 - 268.32] disrespect for
[266.08 - 270.16] wildlife too like what about all the
[268.32 - 271.44] birds that are trying to sleep
[270.16 - 273.52] and they're just blowing these things
[271.44 - 276.00] off everywhere in everybody's yard
[273.52 - 277.52] and everybody's apartment home it's just
[276.00 - 278.96] blowing them up everywhere

[349.20 - 351.92] starting to blow them off but it's
[350.56 - 353.76] really devastating you got to think
[351.92 - 355.12] about it you got a little baby right
[353.76 - 357.92] so you got neighborhoods with all these
[355.12 - 360.88] little newborn babies right

[366.88 - 371.92] it's unbelievable right how it works
[370.24 - 373.20] i mean what they're doing out there
[371.92 - 374.32] fireworks need to be banished they
[373.20 - 377.20] really do
[374.32 - 379.04] they do selena they do um you know if
[377.20 - 380.00] you want to do them at this one place
[379.04 - 382.16] park where everybody
[380.00 - 383.28] rolls in and you want to just one place
[382.16 - 386.08] you know and it's it's
[383.28 - 388.56] it's it's a lot easier unless you live
[386.08 - 391.52] next to that park but
[388.56 - 392.40] bev says should stopped should stop
[391.52 - 395.60] cause the
[392.40 - 396.96] uh vietnam vets yeah shell shock yeah
[395.60 - 398.96] they jump under things i have to tell
[396.96 - 400.96] you i've had so many vets that i helped
[398.96 - 404.32] out throughout the years you guys
[400.96 - 406.48] that are tortured by the the
[404.32 - 408.48] by the four fourth of july but it's not
[406.48 - 410.32] just the fourth of july that's not it
[408.48 - 412.64] they're tortured by
[410.32 - 414.16] neighborhoods blowing them up in their
[412.64 - 415.92] driveways
[414.16 - 417.84] and in their yards all across the
[415.92 - 421.04] country so it's neighborhoods it's
[417.84 - 422.08] in the driveway a driveway next to a
[421.04 - 426.00] house with pets
[422.08 - 428.00] right there or elderly people that
[426.00 - 429.84] you know that what about without people
[428.00 - 431.20] that are like having difficult
[429.84 - 433.36] problems they're breathing they're on
[431.20 - 436.00] oxygen tanks what about people that
[433.36 - 437.20] that are um you know elderly people that
[436.00 - 439.76] had strokes
[437.20 - 441.92] and they're you know they're home thank
[439.76 - 443.76] god and they're at least alive and then
[441.92 - 444.56] they're just blowing these bombs off
[443.76 - 447.28] i've seen it
[444.56 - 448.24] all for years but here's the thing it
[447.28 - 451.60] got
[448.24 - 454.32] really really bad last
[451.60 - 455.68] year the last couple of years it got
[454.32 - 459.04] really really bad
[455.68 - 460.72] and it's gonna be the worst probably
[459.04 - 462.16] this year because the whole thing with
[460.72 - 464.80] covet and everything
[462.16 - 466.48] right it's made this whole thing even a
[464.80 - 468.56] little bit more complex
[466.48 - 470.16] people just they kind of went insane
[468.56 - 471.12] from being locked in their homes and all
[470.16 - 472.72] their stuff just people
[471.12 - 474.96] bought a lot of fireworks it's probably
[472.72 - 478.00] way worse this year right
[474.96 - 481.20] and it's really really it's
[478.00 - 484.80] sad it's that and you know and no one
[481.20 - 487.44] no one gets it a man in my neighbor lost
[484.80 - 488.32] her dog he jumped the fence and was hit
[487.44 - 490.00] by a car
[488.32 - 492.00] because of the fireworks right scared
[490.00 - 494.72] the dog over the fence
[492.00 - 496.40] and they blow them they blow them off
[494.72 - 498.32] they blow them off
[496.40 - 500.24] all through the night everywhere and
[498.32 - 503.60] it's not like anybody's
[500.24 - 504.96] like stopping it or you know anything's
[503.60 - 507.68] happening like that
[504.96 - 508.40] it doesn't it doesn't work like that
[507.68 - 511.52] it's just
[508.40 - 511.84] it's just it's just terrible and i think
[511.52 - 513.28] that
[511.84 - 515.92] i think it's it's important to say
[513.28 - 517.68] something about it this fourth of july
[515.92 - 519.52] it's gotten so bad last few years i've
[517.68 - 521.76] always seen it bad
[519.52 - 524.48] yeah late night too they'll do it late
[521.76 - 525.92] night as well so you know i mean
[524.48 - 528.08] i've always been asked what do you do
[525.92 - 528.64] what do you do and i say look i i know
[528.08 - 531.92] that
[528.64 - 534.56] lemon balm tea can't fix it right can't
[531.92 - 535.28] fix people blowing these bombs off
[534.56 - 537.84] non-stop
[535.28 - 538.72] everywhere and it happens all night long
[537.84 - 541.60] right
[538.72 - 543.60] and but but i always recommend lemon
[541.60 - 545.76] balm tea just lots of lemon balm tea i
[543.60 - 546.40] got lemon balm tea now i recommend that
[545.76 - 549.04] you know

[562.08 - 565.92] lemon balm if you guys want something to
[564.72 - 568.80] help
[565.92 - 570.72] in some way so especially with so many
[568.80 - 571.04] people with crippling anxiety problems
[570.72 - 572.96] too
[571.04 - 574.80] these fireworks are really out of hand i
[572.96 - 575.84] cannot take it they release toxins in
[574.80 - 577.60] the air and i want to talk about that
[575.84 - 580.32] that's one thing i want to talk about
[577.60 - 582.72] we get anxious causes anxiety my cats
[580.32 - 583.84] get scared too adrina i totally
[582.72 - 585.52] understand
[583.84 - 587.28] you guys on tick tock how you guys doing
[585.52 - 588.08] thanks for coming on we're talking about
[587.28 - 590.16] the firework
[588.08 - 592.48] problem lorena good see everybody's
[590.16 - 596.00] coming on and
[592.48 - 597.76] and i think that you know uh the toxic
[596.00 - 598.64] part okay so let's go into that part
[597.76 - 601.92] right
[598.64 - 604.40] fireworks are manufactured right
[601.92 - 606.24] without eyeballs on them i want you to
[604.40 - 607.60] know so there's no eyeballs on the
[606.24 - 609.84] manufacturing of
[607.60 - 611.12] of fireworks right and even if i
[609.84 - 613.44] eyeballs were on them
[611.12 - 614.88] in the industry they'd still be toxic
[613.44 - 617.92] but they're
[614.88 - 618.64] severely toxic fireworks aren't gun
[617.92 - 623.20] powder
[618.64 - 624.80] alone they're a brew of chemical toxins
[623.20 - 626.56] and they just and and so when
[624.80 - 628.64] everybody's blowing them off the stuff's
[626.56 - 630.96] drifting and floating through the air
[628.64 - 632.16] really bad for people with asthma bad
[630.96 - 633.44] for people with all kinds of
[632.16 - 635.84] sensitivities
[633.44 - 636.72] and chemical sensitivities right all
[635.84 - 639.92] that kind of stuff
[636.72 - 641.92] and so this stuff just drifts and drips
[639.92 - 645.28] and it's a chemical soup it's not
[641.92 - 645.76] gun powder gun powder is just one aspect
[645.28 - 648.32] of it
[645.76 - 650.32] it's a chemical soup like literally a
[648.32 - 653.44] chemical soup is what it is
[650.32 - 656.40] and and so no one's even like
[653.44 - 657.04] no one even is monitoring that no one
[656.40 - 660.88] cares
[657.04 - 663.12] about that no one cares whatsoever
[660.88 - 665.04] i got nervous about people hurting
[663.12 - 668.00] themselves too i mean that's just
[665.04 - 669.84] one aspect exactly michelle that's one
[668.00 - 671.04] aspect of it right there's always a
[669.84 - 674.24] child that gets their
[671.04 - 675.44] like hand blown off her fingers blown
[674.24 - 678.72] off every single year
[675.44 - 680.64] not one there's always like a good 100
[678.72 - 682.64] children that get injured from it being
[680.64 - 683.44] shot one way or shot the other and then
[682.64 - 685.76] and then
[683.44 - 686.56] you know causing a severe injury to kids
[685.76 - 688.16] right
[686.56 - 690.24] so there's that too and then that's
[688.16 - 694.24] scary that's terrifying really
[690.24 - 696.80] but it's it's terrifying
[694.24 - 698.00] that it's all encompassed children's
[696.80 - 702.08] injuries
[698.00 - 703.12] babies getting like a form of shell
[702.08 - 705.12] shock
[703.12 - 706.88] in their life so here's how it works so
[705.12 - 708.96] when the bombs are blowing up and you
[706.88 - 710.96] got your little baby
[708.96 - 712.24] and your little baby's hearing these
[710.96 - 715.04] explosions
[712.24 - 717.76] what happens is you don't know it but it
[715.04 - 718.24] affects situations years later down the
[717.76 - 720.48] road
[718.24 - 722.08] in the child's life so it affects it and
[720.48 - 724.32] even into adult
[722.08 - 725.52] adulthood so people don't realize that
[724.32 - 727.52] the shapes
[725.52 - 729.12] it causes problems like it causes
[727.52 - 730.88] problems
[729.12 - 733.44] down the road and that's another thing
[730.88 - 735.84] too i'm just sad about it all
[733.44 - 736.56] conrad i once witnessed how a drunken
[735.84 - 739.36] young man
[736.56 - 741.20] blew off half of his thumb by holding on
[739.36 - 744.64] to a big firecracker
[741.20 - 746.88] in his hand without throwing it away
[744.64 - 748.80] absolutely i mean there's hands blown
[746.88 - 752.00] off there's
[748.80 - 753.92] feet burned and toes blowing off there's
[752.00 - 755.84] there's all that stuff for sure and
[753.92 - 757.68] there's head injuries and deaths
[755.84 - 760.08] there's deaths there's lots of those
[757.68 - 763.28] every single year catherine elizabeth
[760.08 - 764.24] espanol years ago we know a child that
[763.28 - 766.96] died
[764.24 - 768.80] from a mortar blowing up in his face
[766.96 - 771.52] absolutely and catherine
[768.80 - 772.96] i i know stories of that children that
[771.52 - 774.88] died
[772.96 - 777.36] from it going to the face and just
[774.88 - 781.36] blowing the child's face
[777.36 - 785.28] off i mean literally
[781.36 - 786.72] i know one tastes horrifying i don't
[785.28 - 787.92] know anything worse than that actually
[786.72 - 789.04] there's nothing worse than that on the
[787.92 - 792.32] planet right
[789.04 - 794.16] and so um
[792.32 - 795.76] yeah so anyway i was talking about like
[794.16 - 798.00] the lemon balm and stuff for people see
[795.76 - 800.08] if you guys got the anxiety
[798.00 - 801.76] um you can't get a hold of emergency
[800.08 - 804.96] lemon balm maybe get a hold of
[801.76 - 807.04] uh a traditional medicinals right
[804.96 - 809.12] get a hold of their tea do a whole bunch
[807.04 - 811.84] of lemon balm tea
[809.12 - 812.80] i'm not sponsored by vimergy i'm not
[811.84 - 815.28] sponsored by
[812.80 - 816.56] traditional medicinals just so you know
[815.28 - 818.32] okay
[816.56 - 820.88] but that's the vimergy lemon balm
[818.32 - 822.64] vimergy magnesium glycinate i recommend
[820.88 - 825.28] that all the time for this and
[822.64 - 826.96] the vimergy gaba the vimergy gaba i
[825.28 - 829.12] recommend to
[826.96 - 831.36] war vets who live through wars and
[829.12 - 833.28] there's lots of them
[831.36 - 834.48] there's lots of them and they live
[833.28 - 836.56] through wars you know
[834.48 - 837.76] and they watch their friends die in wars
[836.56 - 839.68] and
[837.76 - 841.20] and uh but check you know check with
[839.68 - 842.00] your doctor and what's right for you of
[841.20 - 843.36] course you know
[842.00 - 845.04] check with your doctors what's right for
[843.36 - 846.40] you but that's what i recommend friends
[845.04 - 848.80] and family
[846.40 - 850.56] um i think that i think one of the
[848.80 - 852.00] things to consider really with it all is
[850.56 - 854.88] that
[852.00 - 856.08] is that it's a compilation of all of it
[854.88 - 859.28] right you've got the elderly
[856.08 - 861.52] people okay lots of them out there
[859.28 - 864.08] right and lots of them are sick now so
[861.52 - 865.36] we've got elderly people that are sick
[864.08 - 866.72] and then we got young people that are
[865.36 - 868.40] sick now two struggling with their
[866.72 - 870.16] central nervous system struggling with
[868.40 - 872.00] severe fatigue struggling with all kinds
[870.16 - 874.56] of problems they got ocd
[872.00 - 875.36] they got bipolar they got ptsd from
[874.56 - 877.44] being sick
[875.36 - 879.36] they got migraines they got all these
[877.44 - 882.00] different issues right
[879.36 - 883.44] and you guys know that and these bombs
[882.00 - 886.32] blowing up it's just
[883.44 - 887.36] downright torture just downright torture
[886.32 - 889.84] it's heartbreaking
[887.36 - 891.52] and and then you've got the wildfires
[889.84 - 892.48] that happen from it like nobody cares
[891.52 - 896.08] about that
[892.48 - 897.44] does anybody realize after every fourth
[896.08 - 900.72] of july
[897.44 - 901.84] there's a serious fire in california
[900.72 - 905.76] that starts
[901.84 - 909.04] up like a new one and a really bad one
[905.76 - 912.08] so let's just make the connection there
[909.04 - 915.20] okay because every fourth of july
[912.08 - 917.92] in california we have the fires
[915.20 - 918.48] and they start up and then before they
[917.92 - 921.36] become
[918.48 - 922.32] raging which is like a week later two
[921.36 - 925.52] weeks later
[922.32 - 928.24] but they start it during the fourth and
[925.52 - 929.92] it and they caught on and no one really
[928.24 - 931.36] found out about it until late or a
[929.92 - 933.04] little bit like a week later as it's
[931.36 - 936.64] already blue
[933.04 - 938.16] but you know everyone should be aware
[936.64 - 939.76] they should bring awareness about this
[938.16 - 940.88] stuff people should start voicing about
[939.76 - 942.80] it
[940.88 - 944.32] you know everybody's about them here's
[942.80 - 946.40] the thing here's the thing that bothers
[944.32 - 948.32] me the most right
[946.40 - 950.08] is not bothers me the most but just one
[948.32 - 951.92] of these things that bothers me right
[950.08 - 954.08] hey paige hall crystal how you doing
[951.92 - 958.08] exactly right and the fire's raging
[954.08 - 960.72] and yeah now so here's here's something
[958.08 - 962.72] to consider okay it's like isn't
[960.72 - 965.04] everybody about this awareness thing
[962.72 - 966.96] everybody's so aware and so spiritual
[965.04 - 970.00] and so together and
[966.96 - 970.40] and i know listen i know people have
[970.00 - 974.00] their
[970.40 - 975.44] thoughts uh about like certain groups of
[974.00 - 977.12] people are more apt to blow off
[975.44 - 980.16] fireworks i i don't believe that
[977.12 - 982.80] it's everybody it's east west coast
[980.16 - 983.20] it's it's everywhere in between it's
[982.80 - 986.88] south
[983.20 - 988.64] north it's you know
[986.88 - 990.56] it's north it's south it's east it's
[988.64 - 992.88] west it's everywhere
[990.56 - 994.08] and so it's not about hey you know
[992.88 - 995.68] everybody's like well you know
[994.08 - 997.52] everybody's so spiritual everybody has
[995.68 - 1000.24] so much awareness
[997.52 - 1001.84] and i just wonder about that because i
[1000.24 - 1004.00] scratch my head on that one i'm like i'm
[1001.84 - 1005.84] scratching my head on that one
[1004.00 - 1007.52] and what about kindness everybody's got
[1005.84 - 1009.12] that whole kindness thing going on like
[1007.52 - 1010.00] everybody's pulling that whole kindness
[1009.12 - 1013.52] thing behind this i
[1010.00 - 1016.88] just wonder um i think that
[1013.52 - 1018.24] um you know so it's kind of stuff i
[1016.88 - 1020.56] wanted to talk about for a couple of
[1018.24 - 1024.40] minutes with you guys
[1020.56 - 1027.52] and adriana says it's everywhere yes
[1024.40 - 1028.00] yeah it is you know firework negatives
[1027.52 - 1031.36] don't
[1028.00 - 1035.12] outweigh the positives firework you know
[1031.36 - 1038.16] sorry firework positives don't
[1035.12 - 1041.44] they don't outweigh the negatives
[1038.16 - 1042.80] gotta flip that one around yeah and uh
[1041.44 - 1045.36] that's what happens when you're working
[1042.80 - 1047.36] on the book all practically all night
[1045.36 - 1048.56] and then you get three hours of sleep
[1047.36 - 1050.32] and then you want to let everybody know
[1048.56 - 1052.40] about fireworks jewel

[1071.60 - 1074.88] is when you look at all the different
[1073.44 - 1078.40] pieces of it it's

[1115.84 - 1124.32] these things matter so much so much
[1120.84 - 1125.44] and and then there's like i said the

[1128.32 - 1131.12] we get them everywhere too we get them
[1129.76 - 1132.40] in other places because the fourth

[1178.40 - 1182.32] ig now
[1180.72 - 1184.48] i know i just think you know think about
[1182.32 - 1186.00] it you know give it give it some thought
[1184.48 - 1187.68] you guys if you haven't thought about it
[1186.00 - 1188.72] before i know you guys know what's going
[1187.68 - 1189.76] on you guys in the medical meme
[1188.72 - 1190.72] community you always know what's going
[1189.76 - 1192.40] on
[1190.72 - 1193.76] there's so many other ways to celebrate
[1192.40 - 1195.60] the fourth of july
[1193.76 - 1196.88] i'm not saying that all fireworks have
[1195.60 - 1198.88] to be completely banned
[1196.88 - 1200.00] it's not what it is it's like what has
[1198.88 - 1203.28] to be done is
[1200.00 - 1205.76] i don't think we should be allowed to
[1203.28 - 1207.84] go and buy because quarter stick of
[1205.76 - 1209.20] dynamite half stick of dynamite
[1207.84 - 1211.84] these blockbusters right they're all
[1209.20 - 1215.28] blockbusters they're m80s
[1211.84 - 1216.72] m60s blockbusters their quarter stick of
[1215.28 - 1217.84] dynamites have sticker dynamites they
[1216.72 - 1221.36] get propelled in the air
[1217.84 - 1223.12] through a rocket right and um i just
[1221.36 - 1224.64] i just don't think that the cool that
[1223.12 - 1227.76] those big bomb
[1224.64 - 1229.60] blasts should be a part of it i think
[1227.76 - 1233.20] that those big bomb blasts i think
[1229.60 - 1235.44] curfews on on on fireworks too
[1233.20 - 1237.04] i just don't think your neighbor should
[1235.44 - 1240.48] be allowed to go get a half a stick of
[1237.04 - 1243.20] dynamite and propel it in their driveway
[1240.48 - 1244.40] while you got a one month baby one month
[1243.20 - 1246.40] old baby
[1244.40 - 1248.80] two dogs that might be seizuring cat
[1246.40 - 1252.08] that might be seizuring
[1248.80 - 1253.12] a war vet home whether a female or a
[1252.08 - 1256.48] male warbuck
[1253.12 - 1258.00] man or woman and uh at home
[1256.48 - 1259.68] and i i just think i just think that
[1258.00 - 1261.52] that shouldn't be
[1259.68 - 1262.96] part of everything you know i think we
[1261.52 - 1264.40] just should be mindful
[1262.96 - 1266.16] and then the chronic illness and then
[1264.40 - 1268.16] the elderly and then and then
[1266.16 - 1269.60] i i know situations where you know you
[1268.16 - 1273.44] got
[1269.60 - 1275.36] an elderly person who's hypersensitive
[1273.44 - 1277.04] been through enough in their life
[1275.36 - 1279.76] they're older
[1277.04 - 1280.08] sick and then they also have a pet and
[1279.76 - 1282.24] they
[1280.08 - 1284.40] can't even get the pet in the closet to
[1282.24 - 1286.40] try to stop the seizures you know
[1284.40 - 1287.84] because they're just too sick they're
[1286.40 - 1290.56] going around in a walker
[1287.84 - 1291.04] and they're trying to get their pets you
[1290.56 - 1294.96] know
[1291.04 - 1295.76] and war vets they had to serve the
[1294.96 - 1298.48] country
[1295.76 - 1300.16] they lived through the wars they they've
[1298.48 - 1302.72] been through all that they've had
[1300.16 - 1304.00] explosives blow up and around them and
[1302.72 - 1307.44] close by they're damaged
[1304.00 - 1310.80] emotionally uh spiritually
[1307.44 - 1312.16] ptsd right you know
[1310.80 - 1313.52] and when you think about that i just
[1312.16 - 1315.36] don't think we should be blowing off
[1313.52 - 1316.32] these bombs right next to the war vets
[1315.36 - 1319.04] that could be you know
[1316.32 - 1322.24] nearby got to have some respect i mean
[1319.04 - 1324.72] they went to war to hear those bombs
[1322.24 - 1326.80] right they didn't want to hear it in
[1324.72 - 1328.16] their backyard while sitting in a chair
[1326.80 - 1328.64] in the backyard or they don't want to
[1328.16 - 1330.32] hear it
[1328.64 - 1332.64] when they're trying to go to sleep at 10
[1330.32 - 1334.96] o'clock at night 11 12 o'clock at night
[1332.64 - 1336.16] i don't know it's all it's everything
[1334.96 - 1337.68] it's everything
[1336.16 - 1339.60] right now a lot of people with
[1337.68 - 1342.00] trigeminal neuralgia by the way
[1339.60 - 1343.52] trigeminal neuralgia really have a hard
[1342.00 - 1346.72] time in the migraines in the
[1343.52 - 1350.08] in the trigeminal neuralgia
[1346.72 - 1353.12] i mean seriously that's really rough
[1350.08 - 1355.36] really rough so i keep that in mind
[1353.12 - 1356.48] then i keep keep in mind too about the
[1355.36 - 1358.00] homeless you know
[1356.48 - 1360.00] the homeless because there's millions of
[1358.00 - 1362.72] homeless people now in the u.s
[1360.00 - 1364.32] millions right and millions of homeless
[1362.72 - 1365.52] people in the u.s right now
