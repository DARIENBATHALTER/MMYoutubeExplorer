everyone's gut because what people need

17
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:01,160
to understand is that medical research

18
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:04,760
and science doesn't understand stand

19
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:08,840

20
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:11,400

okay I'll I'll talk to you soon bye

65
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,920
you've probably heard of leaky gut

66
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:27,879
before I remember when leaky gut hit the

67
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:31,120
town and it just took off and it was

68
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:32,959
like the answer for everything years ago

69
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,680
a little history lesson right here if

70
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,239
you don't know when you're new in health

71
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,560
and or you just got sick or you're

72
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:43,439
somebody that just wasn't aware of this

73
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:46,280
but leaky gut was one of those panaceas

74
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:50,080
that solved everything but yet solved

75
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:52,200
nothing cuz nobody got better back then

76
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,439
it was just oh you got leaky gut you got

77
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:58,760
leaky gut alternative medicine took that

78
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:01,480
leaky gut they ran with it and ran with

79
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:04,120
it they would not stop that went along

80
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:07,000
with candida of course you either got a

81
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:09,200
Candida diagnosis or a leaky gut

82
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,400
diagnosis and then sometimes you get

83
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:16,440
both now back then 10 20 30 years ago

84
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:19,519
alternative medicine wasn't ined with

85
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:21,600
conventional medicine now it is you guys

86
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,880
they're in bed together and then the

87
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,360
lines are

88
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:29,360
blurred but back then they weren't so

89
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:32,639
conventional medicine was like there's

90
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:35,440
no way someone has leaky gut because

91
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,520
leaky gut to us conventional medicine

92
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:41,120
would be a puncture inside the

93
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:44,600
intestinal tract or the colon or in the

94
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:47,840
stomach or dadum and that puncture would

95
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:51,600
allow contents from the intestinal tract

96
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:54,800
to leak into the bloodstream of the body

97
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,199
or leak into a different Avenue of the

98
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,759
body then the person would get an

99
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,639
infection they would be in the hospital

100
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,160
they'd have a fever maybe even a really

101
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:07,440
high fever or a low grade fever too for

102
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:10,000
a while and then they would get

103
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,680
sepsis and be really sick and

104
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
potentially die that was leaky gut

105
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,759
syndrome to Conventional medicine back

106
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,120
then I'm not talking about 100 years ago

107
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:23,080
I'm talking about 10 years ago 15 years

108
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:25,960
ago 20 that was the definition of leaky

109
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:30,360
gut from conventional medicine's point

110
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:33,639
of view alternative medicine was just a

111
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:37,039
term not understood though not

112
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:38,479
understood but a term leaky gut it was

113
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,680
like the answer for everything at the

114
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,720
time now there was no science for

115
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,560
alternative medicine or conventional

116
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,680
medicine that deemed leaky gut as a

117
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,400
possibility alternative medicine didn't

118
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,600
have an answer they did not have a

119
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,880
microscope inside somebody's intestinal

120
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,720
tract looking at the possibility of

121
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:58,160
contents leaking from their intestinal

122
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:01,520
tract into their bloodstream it didn't

123
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:05,160
happen it just wasn't there science did

124
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:09,599
not see it nobody saw it it was a theory

125
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:11,639
it was 100% a theory and nothing but a

126
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:13,479
theory that somebody had leaky gut and

127
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:15,080
that's why they were struggling so when

128
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:17,319
a patient came to an alternative

129
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:20,720
doctor's office I was like well I'm

130
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:23,680
fatigued I don't feel good I'm not well

131
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,360
I got aches and pains I got brain fog

132
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,199
I'm bloating what is it and then

133
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,160
alternative medicine would be like well

134
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:32,639
I think you got leaky guts in

135
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,039
like whoo leaky gut syndrome now I have

136
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,240
an answer I can take that and do

137
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,960
something with it it's not that they saw

138
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:43,039
the person had a leaky gut nobody knew

139
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:46,240
there was no test that determin it truly

140
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:49,120
it was just a guess or a theory and a

141
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,800
guess just compiled onto itself but the

142
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:56,120
health movement back then was Barren it

143
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:58,919
was dry it was like a desert and people

144
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:02,240
were thirsty you're sick for enough

145
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:04,039
years you hit a new alternative doctor

146
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,160
it's the year

147
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:10,319
2002 it's the Year

148
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:12,599
1997 it's the year 2010 and when you hit

149
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:15,039
that alternative medicine clinic and a

150
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:17,919
doctor's like you got leaky gut and it's

151
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:22,280
like The Thirst is quenched in that

152
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:24,720
moment Hallelujah there's an answer here

153
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:27,479
I'm not thirsty anymore let me drink

154
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,240
this up you leave on a high it was a

155
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:33,680
miracle moment in Alternative Health but

156
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,960
really it was just a theory but you know

157
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,680
what when you got stuff in your head

158
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,199
like that and you've been looking for a

159
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,639
long time it makes sense my gut is

160
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:44,879
leaking darn it that's what it is

161
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,400
because everything I eat matters and

162
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:49,280
what I'm doing matters my stomach my gut

163
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,039
I don't feel good it has to all stem

164
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,280
from the gut and it was the perfect

165
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:56,039
opportunity for alternative medicine to

166
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:58,199
look good especially since conventional

167
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:59,960
medicine was torturous at the time for

168
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:02,440
so many people

169
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:05,759
absolutely torturous all they did was

170
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:08,960
offer a steroid an antibiotic an

171
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,000
anti-depressant an anti-anxiety Med a

172
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,080
benzo

173
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,319
aspine some type of anti-inflammatory

174
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:18,680
and you're on your way didn't matter

175
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:21,400
what was going on where who when unless

176
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:23,479
you broke your leg or your penic

177
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:26,240
exploded and you needed emergency

178
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:27,960
surgery other than that and maybe a few

179
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,720
other things that are life- saving of

180
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,479
course conventional medicine is life

181
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:35,080
saving but when it comes down to chronic

182
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:38,039
illness it was just emptier than

183
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:40,399
alternative medicine truly emptier you

184
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:43,839
ran through gamma of tests didn't have

185
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:45,480
any answers and you went home to feed it

186
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,440
everybody went home to feed it and it

187
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:51,040
even happens now till this day even with

188
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:53,880
conventional medicine being married now

189
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,640
to alternative medicine like it is it's

190
00:08:53,880 --> 00:09:00,160
still defeating in so many ways but back

191
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:02,440
then getting an answer was everything

192
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,000
so let's hit leaky gut for a little bit

193
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:07,959
so when people were getting a leaky gut

194
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:12,000
diagnosis it wasn't about other things

195
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:14,800
like ulcers diverticulosis

196
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,560
diverticulitis Pockets that were in the

197
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,640
intestinal tract or colon that were

198
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:22,640
highly inflamed and very damaged with

199
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:25,720
scar tissue it wasn't about these things

200
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:28,560
at all these things weren't even in the

201
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,920
picture this was just people who've

202
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,200
already had

203
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,640
colonies endoscopies they've already had

204
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,680
you know people looking inside the

205
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,640
intestinal tract they had

206
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,279
cameras everywhere inside their

207
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,200
intestinal tract but they still didn't

208
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,800
have

209
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:45,920
answers it was people that just didn't

210
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,800
feel good for all these other reasons or

211
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,560
having all these other symptoms were

212
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,680
given these leaky gut

213
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:54,880
diagnosis so it's very different if

214
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:57,880
somebody has an ulcer that's blowing up

215
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:00,560
exploding inside their gut an ulcer in

216
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:03,040
their stomach the water them and that

217
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:06,000
Ulster is a bleeding hemorrhaging

218
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,800
uler and there could be a possible

219
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,079
Fisher or window into the other side of

220
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:14,920
that area leaking things into the

221
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:16,880
bloodstream very different right there

222
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:20,440
or a puncture which happens when people

223
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:23,760
get colon oopes the camera goes up they

224
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:25,880
roll it out and it punctures people's

225
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,279
colons and now they're in the hospital

226
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:30,120
for 4 months 6 months 2 months because

227
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:32,079
they have a puncture and they're

228
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,560
fighting for their lives with

229
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:37,160
sepsis it's different than anything like

230
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:40,399
that leaky gut that was happening with

231
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:43,079
people wasn't for any reason besides you

232
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,839
don't feel good you got leaky gut when

233
00:10:43,079 --> 00:10:48,639
it comes to the alternative theory of

234
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:50,920
leaky gut it's Advanced along the years

235
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:53,200
now it's all about different things that

236
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:55,320
are happening medical communities and

237
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,800
alternative medicine describe a

238
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:00,079
condition in which mold or fungus like

239
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,639
candid

240
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:05,320
or unproductive bacteria Thrive and

241
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:07,639
burrow tiny holes in the Linings of the

242
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:09,320
intestine and cause micro levels of

243
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:12,160
toxins to leak directly into the

244
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:14,399
bloodstream resulting in a multitude of

245
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:17,000
symptoms there are different variations

246
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:19,720
of this belief and they all mimic each

247
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,240
other though now having an intestinal

248
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:27,399
tract filled with unproductive bacteria

249
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:29,839
unproductive mold yeast different fungus

250
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:32,200
having an intestinal tract fil with all

251
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,959
of that can give you symptoms there can

252
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:37,079
be problems you can have a strep you can

253
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:39,040
have an eoli you can have different

254
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:42,480
bacteria causing different problems in

255
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:45,000
the intestinal tract for many reasons

256
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:49,000
and doing different things but that's a

257
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,360
far cry from leaky gut if these

258
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,480
pathogens were truly Crossing

259
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:59,800
barriers if unproductive fungus candida

260
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:02,079
mold were crossing into the blood stream

261
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:04,040
from the intestinal tract lining or

262
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,000
entering into the body through the

263
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:09,040
intestinal tract in any way the stomach

264
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,279
dadum the colon if that was happening

265
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:14,560
there would be a war going on and

266
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:17,079
somebody would be bedridden sick with

267
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,560
fevers and levels of toxins in their

268
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:22,519
bloodstream creating a sepsis a chronic

269
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:25,000
sepsis all the time now the hospital

270
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:26,760
would know that they would have sepsis

271
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,600
it would be a mystery maybe to how it's

272
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,040
happening it would be a mystery to why

273
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,519
they have sepsis

274
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,959
but if there were holes throughout the

275
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:38,320
intestinal tract or colon and bacteria

276
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:40,639
was crossing barriers Crossing that

277
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,720
lining and all kinds of other different

278
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:46,360
fungus and yeast and mold and other

279
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:48,920
toxins were crossing out of that

280
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:52,600
intestinal environment into the body in

281
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:54,800
some way they would know it's sepsis

282
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,920
they would know we have a problem and

283
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,720
maybe a really smart doctor might be

284
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,880
like wo this could be coming from

285
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,360
somewhere maybe it's coming from the gut

286
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,880
somewhere and there's some kind of

287
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:08,320
fisser there's some kind of opening but

288
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,959
that's a far cry and very different so

289
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,199
different from a whole host of other

290
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:14,920
symptoms that are created from inflamed

291
00:13:12,199 --> 00:13:17,839
neurological systems and brain

292
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:20,120
inflammation and viruses and metals and

293
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,519
other toxins and so forth it would be

294
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:24,120
much different than the sepsis somebody

295
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:26,839
would have in the hospital where they

296
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:28,880
would be identifying that really easy

297
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:31,440
and that would be like okay now that

298
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,360
would be a leaky gut if there was really

299
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,279
a passageway through the intestinal

300
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,880
tract into the body but this is much

301
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:39,880
different than people being sick or

302
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:42,160
vetan with neurological conditions

303
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:44,240
chronic illness aches and pains body

304
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:47,160
aches and pains all kinds of different

305
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,440
issues far different than that but what

306
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,519
happens with leaky gut enthusiasts

307
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,360
doctors that believe in leaky gut in the

308
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:56,240
way they do they'll just package it all

309
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:58,600
up and that's what they did years ago

310
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,720
alternative medicine packaged everything

311
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:03,920
up in into leaky gut you walk through

312
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,920
the door with all your host of symptoms

313
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:09,880
everything you're suffering from neck

314
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:12,680
pain ear pain vertigo dizziness ringing

315
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:15,399
in the ear tingles and numbness back

316
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:17,360
pain leg pain feet pain insomnia

317
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:19,839
whatever it was it would be like okay

318
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,800
this is leaky gut and so let's treat it

319
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:25,240
and that's what's going on and the sad

320
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:28,320
part was they were wrong and it wasn't

321
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,720
it wasn't Lecky gut it was other things

322
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,600
viral infection

323
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:36,480
Epstein bar which originally starts as

324
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:39,399
mononucleosis hhv6 simplex one Simplex 2

325
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:42,759
setav virus shingles

326
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:45,720
hhv7 different forms of bacteria like

327
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:47,639
strep lots of toxic heavy metal exposure

328
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:50,320
throughout an entire lifetime and even

329
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:52,160
before passed down from generations and

330
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,560
generations all kinds of different

331
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,000
toxins and poisons chemicals and so

332
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,040
forth and antagonists neuro antagonists

333
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,839
that everybody gets exposed to to f

334
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,800
Pharmaceuticals people drink in their

335
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:04,240
water and don't even realize it from all

336
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,360
kinds of different pharmaceutical

337
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:10,759
exposure all of this plus radiation

338
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:14,240
pesticides herbicides DDT all of the

339
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:16,240
above is happening but yet it's all

340
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,440
blamed on leaky gut as if that was what

341
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:21,480
it was but it wasn't even when people

342
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,519
deal with fatigue and aches and pains

343
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:27,600
and constipation and digestive

344
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:29,720
discomfort acid reflux even them those

345
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,880
people are not dealing with leaky gut

346
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:34,759
they're dealing with other problems like

347
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:37,000
low hydrochloric acid ammonia problems

348
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:39,959
which we're going to explore in a minute

349
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,000
liver issues stagnant sluggish toxic

350
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:45,800
livers and then pathogens all throughout

351
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,959
the body all of that plus weak nervous

352
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:50,480
systems they're suffering with all of

353
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:53,399
this but it gets packaged up as if it's

354
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,279
this leaky gut thing when it's not as

355
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:57,680
the years went by leaky gut syndrome

356
00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:00,399
turned into a new label a new

357
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:03,160
identification which was intestinal

358
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:05,680
permeability it was a newer version of

359
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:07,720
leaky gut the reason why because leaky

360
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,639
gut never made sense to begin with and

361
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,920
they knew it along the way and we're

362
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:14,160
like wait a minute this isn't leaky gut

363
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:17,199
so let's call it intestinal permeability

364
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:19,680
so the name changed it was meant to give

365
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:22,480
the illusion of progress but it wasn't

366
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:25,920
progress but what really is happening

367
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:28,399
inside people's guts is ammonia

368
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:31,319
permeability ammonia is a gas that's

369
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:34,319
produced when something's rotting when

370
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:35,720
something's rotting in someone's gut so

371
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:38,000
what's happening out there is people

372
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:40,920
have gut rot instead of leaky gut

373
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,079
syndrome they have gut rot a prime

374
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:46,199
example of this is when somebody eats

375
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:48,880
beans and they don't digest properly

376
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:51,639
because their liver is weakened stagnant

377
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:55,360
sluggish their hydrochloric acid is very

378
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:58,399
low to zero their bio reserves inside

379
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:00,839
their liver is low to zero in many

380
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:03,880
people so what happens is when someone

381
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:05,839
eats a whole bowl of beans they don't

382
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:08,559
digest and break down properly and they

383
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:11,520
start to rot they rot inside the gut

384
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:13,679
it's called Bean rot something similar

385
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,880
happens with nuts so many people eat

386
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,600
gobs of nut butter or they eat a lot of

387
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:20,199
nuts out of hand and what occurs is that

388
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,280
their liver is too weak their bio

389
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:24,360
reserves are too low their hydrochloric

390
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:27,439
acid is too low and then the nuts begin

391
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:29,640
to rot it's called nut rot this can also

392
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,120
happen with eating poultry any kind of

393
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:34,280
turkey or chicken or any kind of other

394
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:36,120
Bird that's eaten what happens is the

395
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,679
body doesn't digest it properly through

396
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,640
all those avenues that I talked about

397
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,160
before with nut rot and bean rot and you

398
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:45,600
get poultry rot this could happen with

399
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:48,000
fish too Snapper tuna Cod halib bit

400
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,200
Trout the stomach can't break it down

401
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,760
properly because the HCL is low the bio

402
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,919
reserves are low and can't break down

403
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,200
any of the fats and then the liver is

404
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:59,159
too stagnant and sluggish and what you

405
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:03,880
have is fish rot same thing happens with

406
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:05,720
meat beef pork lamb these foods are hard

407
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,960
to digest when someone's digestive

408
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:11,280
system is weakened and in turn you get

409
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:13,320
meat rot it doesn't stop there either

410
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:16,120
when someone's eating chocolate and

411
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:18,200
maybe somebody you know notice this or

412
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:21,159
maybe it happened to you later on you

413
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:23,720
get a really bad breath a real stink

414
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:25,400
coming out of you right off your breath

415
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:27,679
someone might say hey that's chocolate

416
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,880
but really someone might also say what's

417
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:33,200
rotten and what ST thinks it's rotting

418
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:35,960
chocolate it's chocolate rot the stench

419
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,760
that a lot of people think is hosis just

420
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:41,720
plain old bad breath or dental problems

421
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:43,559
is really the stench of ammonia food

422
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:46,240
that's rotting in the gut doesn't just

423
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:47,799
stop rotting in one day it could sit

424
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,080
there and rot for

425
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:52,400
days sometimes people have enough food

426
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,919
in their intestinal tract to rot for

427
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:58,080
weeks and some people have food sitting

428
00:18:54,919 --> 00:18:59,400
in their guts rotting for months as the

429
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:03,080
food rots

430
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:05,880
ammonia gas is produced and that ammonia

431
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:08,600
gas seeps past the lining of the

432
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:11,159
intestinal tract and colon and even

433
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:14,000
stomach lining and dadum and it enters

434
00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:15,840
the bloodstream that ammonia gas travels

435
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,520
through the bloodstream into every

436
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:21,720
single organ in the body but that's just

437
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:24,919
one Avenue the ammonia gas travels it

438
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:28,120
also travels through artery walls the

439
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:29,320
Linings of veins it travels through

440
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:32,400
anything

441
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:35,760
it's like a ghost and it moves through

442
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:38,520
bones not just in Bones it moves through

443
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:41,159
them this ammonia gas doesn't just leave

444
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:44,679
the body through the armpits or through

445
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:48,000
sweat when someone works out it leaves

446
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:51,200
every orus every single cell every part

447
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,200
of the skin it leaves your skull at the

448
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,880
top of your head it goes through

449
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,120
everything and it leaves the body in

450
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,880
every way you would think that's a good

451
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,880
thing then it just travels out of the

452
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:05,080
body and it leaves us but no it also

453
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:08,000
stays behind it's a ghost that leaves

454
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:11,080
and stays it's everywhere saturates all

455
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,640
the tissue every cell every organ the

456
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:16,200
entire bloodstream the lymphatic system

457
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:18,320
and yet still gases out and leaves us

458
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:21,240
but there's always more to come more to

459
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:24,120
be produced it's always there one of the

460
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:27,400
most annoying parts of ammonia

461
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:28,960
permeability is when it enters the mouth

462
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,520
especially when somebody's sleeping at

463
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:34,559
night and they're just laying down the

464
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:37,559
ammonia gas produced by rotting food in

465
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:39,679
the gut doesn't just go through the

466
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:42,240
intestinal lining and into the

467
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:45,760
bloodstream it goes up the intestinal

468
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:49,480
tract it floats up it's a ghost that

469
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:52,200
floats upward so it starts heading up

470
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:54,919
into the dadum and it heads into the

471
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:57,320
stomach up the esophagus and into the

472
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:59,200
mouth and then it sits there while

473
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:02,760
somebody's sleeping

474
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:05,799
why should that be a problem one is it

475
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:08,799
starts to affect oral health it starts

476
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:12,679
to cause teeth problems over time bad

477
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:15,360
teeth problems ammonia gas just doesn't

478
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:18,440
move through bones it just doesn't move

479
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:21,159
through organs it moves through teeth

480
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:23,960
and when ammonia gas moves through teeth

481
00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:25,720
it weakens teeth now you might say Well

482
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,799
when it moves through bones it weakens

483
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:30,919
bones but not exactly it does doesn't

484
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:33,080
just weaken bones what happens with

485
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:36,039
bones is there's not a lot of oxygen

486
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:38,240
inside the body not compared to oxygen

487
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:42,080
inside your mouth so what happens when

488
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:44,480
ammonia gas reacts with oxygen from

489
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:47,760
breathing air in and then the ammonia

490
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:50,880
gas entering the mouth from down below

491
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:53,400
the two mix and it becomes more damaging

492
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:56,520
to teeth causing teeth problems quickly

493
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:58,840
versus bone problems quickly in the body

494
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:02,320
the oxygen that enters our mouth helps

495
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:05,440
to keep oral problems down it's one of

496
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:07,799
the self-protecting built-in mechanisms

497
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,600
that we have as human beings we breathe

498
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:13,559
in air through our mouth and the oxygen

499
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:16,159
levels are high keeping bacteria to a

500
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:18,520
certain level lower instead of really

501
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:21,360
high what happens with ammonia

502
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:23,840
permeability and then ammonia gas when

503
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:26,279
the ammonia leeches into the mouth it

504
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,240
starts to lower the oxygen levels

505
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:30,679
meaning bacteria in the mouth grows

506
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,640
faster fter so if somebody has

507
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:34,520
deficiencies for years mineral

508
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,000
deficiencies their teeth are already at

509
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:39,200
a weakened state or they're high intoxic

510
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,400
heavy metals or they have pathogens such

511
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:44,640
as viruses and food deficiencies

512
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:48,600
nutrient deficiencies antioxidant

513
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:51,320
deficiencies B12 deficiencies if you

514
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:53,679
compile ammonia permeability on top of

515
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:56,120
those deficiencies then you have a real

516
00:22:53,679 --> 00:23:00,760
problem so oxygen diminishes in the

517
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:04,000
mouth ammonia Rises bacteria Rises and

518
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:06,000
teeth and gums get worse one thing that

519
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,840
happens though is when someone builds up

520
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,520
their HC they're breaking down proteins

521
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:13,840
better they build up their liver their

522
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:17,360
BS breaking down and dispersing fats

523
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:20,760
better their digestive system is getting

524
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:25,679
stronger they're healing but they have a

525
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:28,159
past a past history of decades or years

526
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,279
and years of ammonia permeability and

527
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,679
Amon

528
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:36,000
damaging teeth so

529
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:39,000
then Father Time kicks in and that teeth

530
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,960
damage shows later even when they're

531
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,919
healing and getting stronger and

532
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:47,559
healthier the past shows up and the

533
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:50,000
teeth start to show what happened

534
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:52,279
especially if people were eating vinegar

535
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,760
and drinking vinegar all these years

536
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:56,360
especially if they were doing apple

537
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:59,240
cider vinegar shots and apple cider

538
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:02,240
vinegar chews all these years the apple

539
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:04,279
cider damages teeth all on its own but

540
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:07,400
it also doesn't help ammonia

541
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:10,400
permeability it worsens it creating more

542
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:12,520
ammonia gas people's refrigerators are

543
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,640
filled with condiments and they eat

544
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:19,240
these condiments and in these condiments

545
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:21,400
is vinegar or vinegars even apple cider

546
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:25,000
vinegar a lot of people use it as a

547
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:27,960
staple in their dressings on their food

548
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,880
in their sauces and vinegar damages the

549
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,520
liver

550
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:34,480
and it injures the HCL production with

551
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:37,240
the stomach glands your gastric glands

552
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:39,520
over the years it contributes to ammonia

553
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:42,440
permeability and ammonia gas

554
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:45,559
production another ammonia producer is

555
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:48,480
salt an overload of salt not just

556
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:51,279
minimal on the salt or small amounts of

557
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,799
salt let a people over Sal their food or

558
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:56,279
eat restaurant food that's overs salted

559
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:59,039
what happens with salt is it injures the

560
00:24:56,279 --> 00:25:01,880
gastric glands it slows down the liver's

561
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:04,960
function and salt itself when saturated

562
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:07,919
in the bloodstream it reacts to ammonia

563
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:11,200
gas Just Like Oxygen reacts to ammonia

564
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:14,559
Gas Salt reacts creating a much more

565
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:17,039
potent form of ammonia gas this is

566
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:19,080
different from natural occurring sodiums

567
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:23,159
like the sodium cluster salts in celery

568
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:25,520
juice which neutralize ammonia gas the

569
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:29,159
sodium in celery juice and the sodium in

570
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:31,840
leafy greens like spinach and lemon

571
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:34,440
is a neutralizer it's there to keep a

572
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,640
sodium balance in the bloodstream a

573
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:40,039
natural occurring sodium

574
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:43,200
balance another problem with gut rot are

575
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:46,480
fats that go rancid a lot of people have

576
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:49,120
high fat diets overt fats are in their

577
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:52,480
diet morning noon and night or even if

578
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:55,039
it's once a day overt fats and what

579
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:58,520
happens is if the blood gets thick and

580
00:25:55,039 --> 00:26:01,799
fat and stagnant and sluggish and the

581
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:04,000
ammonia gas has a field day it could get

582
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:07,360
trapped in places you don't want it

583
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,279
trapped in special places like nerves

584
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:12,080
like the Vegas nerves a hypers sensitive

585
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:14,559
nervous system one that's already

586
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:16,840
dealing with pathogen exposure like

587
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:19,320
neurotoxins produced by Epstein bar

588
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:22,799
virus can be highly sensitive to ammonia

589
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:25,200
permeability ammonia gas this affects

590
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:27,600
nerve response time when somebody has a

591
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,480
thought there's a delay like they think

592
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,120
about lifting their arm and they lift

593
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:33,919
their arm when somebody has a thought

594
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,559
about running there's a slight delay a

595
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:38,000
lot of people run into this with loved

596
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:40,240
ones or they say something and they get

597
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,919
an answer back with a little bit of a

598
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,640
delay the ammonia gas can produce this

599
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:46,960
type of delay when it affects the

600
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,679
central nervous system so how do we

601
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:52,279
reverse ammonia permeability how do we

602
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:55,120
reverse ammonia production inside our

603
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:57,960
body we have to restore the hydrochloric

604
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:00,960
acid levels we have to restore our liver

605
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:03,320
those are the two main things to restore

606
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,559
the hydrochloric acid level you have to

607
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:08,039
bring back those gastric glands you have

608
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:10,600
to strengthen them so as we're

609
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:13,480
revitalizing our gastric glands and

610
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:15,559
making our hydrochloric acid stronger

611
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:17,399
we're up against something that

612
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:21,440
everybody's up against pretty much every

613
00:27:17,399 --> 00:27:23,640
day which is stress everyday stress and

614
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,279
stress puts people in fight ORF flight

615
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:27,760
when we're in fight or flight our

616
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:30,080
adrenals are releasing adrenaline that

617
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:33,399
adrenaline is toxic to the gastric

618
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:36,159
glands keeping HCL down low so we have

619
00:27:33,399 --> 00:27:39,440
to work harder and longer to restore it

620
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:42,519
and Revitalize it so what do we do how

621
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:44,799
do we fix this how do we stop gut rot

622
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:47,880
how do we stop ammonia permeability

623
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:50,880
what's the first step celery juice

624
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:53,640
something that truly works it helps to

625
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:57,519
restore those gastric glands bringing

626
00:27:53,640 --> 00:28:00,760
that HCL back bringing the HCL blend

627
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:04,279
back making it strong so that it breaks

628
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:05,840
down proteins and breaks down food so

629
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:09,120
the gut rot

630
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:12,960
minimizes some people are doing 2 oz

631
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:15,880
some people are doing 8 oz 16 oz 32 oz

632
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,760
some people do 32 ooun twice a day

633
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:20,600
everybody's different everybody chooses

634
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:22,600
to drink the amount they choose but one

635
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:24,519
thing's for certain any amount of

636
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:27,480
accelery juice somebody's drinking is

637
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:28,720
helping this problem and in each person

638
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:30,799
they're different

639
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:34,080
someone's liver could be really stagnant

640
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:36,679
sluggish and highly toxic someone's

641
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:40,399
pancreas could be weakened and highly

642
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:43,000
toxic somebody's spleen can be weakened

643
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:44,799
and highly toxic somebody's gastri

644
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,039
glands could have been damaged from

645
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:52,120
years and years of coffee tea chocolate

646
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:53,880
vinegar someone could be hind pathogens

647
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,960
lots of different viruses rowing inside

648
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:57,799
their liver somebody could have a lot of

649
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:00,200
neurotoxins floating around in their

650
00:28:57,799 --> 00:29:02,120
system and bloodstream and somebody

651
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:04,039
could just be up against a lot of stress

652
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:06,399
they're in fight or flight and their

653
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:08,559
adrenals are pumping out adrenaline

654
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:11,440
every day and that adrenaline is

655
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:14,159
weakening their system but we have tools

656
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,760
to battle this it just requires some

657
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,200
patience and some

658
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:20,399
dedication there are tools that actually

659
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:23,679
work and have street cred they have a

660
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:25,399
track record tools like celery juice

661
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:28,840
tools like the medical medium heavy

662
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:31,080
metal detox in any form in a smooth form

663
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:33,279
a smoothie bowl or just the ingredients

664
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:35,720
on their own throughout the day and then

665
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:38,200
there's the mono cleanse and the medical

666
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:41,720
medium morning cleanse and the medical

667
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:45,039
medium 369 Advanced the medical medium

668
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:47,519
28-day cleanse and the spinach soup and

669
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:50,679
the healing broth there are so many

670
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:53,080
different tools and then protocols

671
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:56,720
supplement protocols for the gut that

672
00:29:53,080 --> 00:30:01,240
are inside the medical medium book

673
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:02,760
series hey Dr doctor hey so what's your

674
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,880

derailed

691
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:04,000
look out it's another

692
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:07,679
storm gigantic balls of

693
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:10,039
hail I think I'm getting a flare my

694
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:11,559
stomach feels like it's getting back to

695
00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:13,120
square

696
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:16,679
one

697
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:20,039
two I can't go through another round of

698
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:23,919
this but I got to just hang in there I

699
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:27,919
know I can do all that I need to do

700
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:30,720
don't tell me I can't do this don't

701
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:35,360
don't tell me I don't have what it

702
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:39,760
takes I have it all inside of me I may

703
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:44,320
make a mistake but that's okay don't we

704
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:45,200
all as we go through this sometimes we

705
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:48,960
take a

706
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:53,440
fall we get back up again and we dust

707
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:57,480
ourselves off no matter what it don't

708
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:58,960
matter just throw a curve ball and guess

709
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:03,480
what

710
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:07,720
who cares if that person is a screw ball

711
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:11,360
because you do have everything it takes

712
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:15,399
it's in the hall the halls of our soul

713
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:18,960
and our body and our free will we know

714
00:32:15,399 --> 00:32:22,600
what the angel saw the intentions inside

715
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:25,639
of you are of the goodest call you are

716
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:30,080
on your way to Healing so you can rise

717
00:32:25,639 --> 00:32:34,000
above all all that don't see you for who

718
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:37,639
you are but instead trip you up in hopes

719
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:41,480
to take a fall but you are smarter than

720
00:32:37,639 --> 00:32:43,840
the darkness you're a Seer and a

721
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:45,600
teacher and you don't need to prove

722
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:49,000
yourself no

723
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:54,000
more you have the floor it's your time

724
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,000
to heal your time to soar
