[0.76 - 5.24] The Following episode is part of a
[2.80 - 7.64] series dedicated to exposing an
[5.24 - 9.56] organized hateful group that has been on
[7.64 - 11.76] a Relentless pursuit to destroy the
[9.56 - 14.72] medical medium community and that has
[11.76 - 17.48] been attacking bullying harassing and
[14.72 - 20.32] preying upon the chronically ill joining
[17.48 - 22.92] me in this series is a guest named Amber
[20.32 - 25.92] bakaro she's an alternative medicine
[22.92 - 28.00] practitioner who became a whistleblower
[25.92 - 30.64] after she witnessed this hateful group
[28.00 - 34.04] in action when they tried to recruit her
[30.64 - 37.28] to join them last year Amber caught the
[34.04 - 39.40] main members of this group on legally
[37.28 - 42.88] recorded calls describing their
[39.40 - 46.64] premeditated multi-step plan to create a
[42.88 - 50.52] quote post-medical medium era by feeding
[46.64 - 52.56] false stories and claims about me and
[50.52 - 55.56] about medical medium information to
[52.56 - 58.52] Major media outlets in hopes that it
[55.56 - 61.32] would lead to securing themselves a deal
[58.52 - 64.48] for an anti-ed medium documentary on
[61.32 - 68.44] Netflix that would bring Fame and other
[64.48 - 70.60] benefits to them now known infamously
[68.44 - 73.84] instead for their malicious plot that
[70.60 - 77.00] was caught on recording and exposed we
[73.84 - 80.08] refer to this hateful group as the
[77.00 - 82.96] plotters their entire smear campaign is
[80.08 - 86.24] spearheaded by one woman who comes from
[82.96 - 88.92] an extremely wealthy family didn't get
[86.24 - 91.84] what she wanted from me years ago and is
[88.92 - 94.76] now seeking Rev venge she's made it her
[91.84 - 97.72] mission to gather a bunch of plotters
[94.76 - 99.52] with ulterior motives and aess to grind
[97.72 - 103.16] including competitors in the health
[99.52 - 106.12] industry to try to frame medical medium
[103.16 - 109.00] and take down the community what this
[106.12 - 110.96] organized hateful group has done is
[109.00 - 112.84] unprecedented it's one of the biggest
[110.96 - 115.92] scandals that's ever happened in the
[112.84 - 118.32] health industry as you'll see it's also
[115.92 - 120.32] one of the biggest instances of
[118.32 - 123.60] capturing corruption within the
[120.32 - 126.60] mainstream media so prepare yourself for
[123.60 - 129.40] lots of details and nuances as we are
[126.60 - 132.52] going to be thoroughly untangling the
[129.40 - 135.04] massive Web of Lies they have spun and
[132.52 - 137.76] we're going to be releasing a lot of
[135.04 - 140.76] disturbing new information new
[137.76 - 144.12] recordings and mindblowing evidence of
[140.76 - 146.80] just how far they are going to lie to
[144.12 - 148.72] try to get what they want some of the
[146.80 - 151.48] evidence we're presenting in these
[148.72 - 154.68] episodes in includes original written
[151.48 - 157.44] content such as text messages social
[154.68 - 160.64] media posts that have been produced by
[157.44 - 163.96] the plots and will be reenacted for
[160.64 - 166.24] greater ease in following along those
[163.96 - 168.72] who are listening along to the podcast

[168.72 - 173.56] episodes on the medical medium YouTube
[171.20 - 177.16] and Rumble channels that will be

[177.16 - 183.96] more some of you may be unaware that
[180.40 - 186.92] this has even been happening but many of
[183.96 - 190.28] you have been tremendously injured and
[186.92 - 192.80] harmed by what they have done the record
[190.28 - 195.80] needs to be set straight and they need
[192.80 - 198.28] to be called out for what they've done
[195.80 - 200.40] and are still doing the medical medium
[198.28 - 202.88] Community does not deserve to be
[200.40 - 205.64] attacked like this and we are going to
[202.88 - 208.87] set the record straight as many times as
[205.64 - 213.47] we need to
[208.87 - 213.47] [Music]
[216.28 - 222.84] all along Ashley Foster has had ulterior
[219.48 - 226.96] motives all along Ashley Foster has been
[222.84 - 229.40] wrong all along Ashley Foster has been
[226.96 - 230.96] lying Ashley's original story about
[229.40 - 233.00] Stephanie included the claim that
[230.96 - 235.92] Anthony never told Stephanie to see a
[233.00 - 238.16] doctor we've proven that wrong with
[235.92 - 240.16] evidence even before we released the
[238.16 - 242.04] evidence Ashley was publicly corrected
[240.16 - 244.44] on this claim Years Ago by the husband
[242.04 - 246.80] of one of Stephanie's friends this
[244.44 - 249.56] husband was actually around for what
[246.80 - 252.20] happened with Stephanie while Ashley was
[249.56 - 254.44] not after being publicly corrected
[252.20 - 257.04] Ashley pivoted and moved forward with a
[254.44 - 260.44] new manufactured story line the new
[257.04 - 262.28] Stephanie story became well okay he told
[260.44 - 264.88] her to go to the doctor I guess but it
[262.28 - 268.08] wasn't until the end after it was too
[264.88 - 269.92] late we've proven that wrong with
[268.08 - 271.44] evidence Ashley claimed that that
[269.92 - 273.08] Stephanie discovered her breast lump
[271.44 - 273.88] while she was staying nights with Ashley
[273.08 - 276.28] in
[273.88 - 278.40] 2016 we've proven that wrong with
[276.28 - 281.92] evidence Stephanie did not develop the
[278.40 - 285.00] breast lump until a whole year later in
[281.92 - 287.44] 2017 Ashley then claimed that Anthony in
[285.00 - 290.08] 2016 had told Stephanie that her breast
[287.44 - 292.96] lump would never become cancerous we've
[290.08 - 295.12] proven that very wrong with evidence
[292.96 - 298.12] that is not possible because the breast
[295.12 - 300.48] lump that was discovered in 2017 did not
[298.12 - 302.20] exist in 2016
[300.48 - 304.36] Ashley's story was
[302.20 - 305.64] artificial Ashley also claimed that
[304.36 - 307.28] Anthony told Stephanie that she had
[305.64 - 309.00] heard her back in yoga but that
[307.28 - 311.44] Stephanie told Ashley that she didn't
[309.00 - 314.48] remember hurting it in yoga we've proven
[311.44 - 316.36] that wrong with evidence Ashley said
[314.48 - 320.16] that Anthony's message to Stephanie was
[316.36 - 323.04] to just lie still on the floor we've
[320.16 - 324.48] proven that wrong with evidence Ashley
[323.04 - 327.36] claimed that Stephanie had done
[324.48 - 330.28] everything Anthony ever told her to do
[327.36 - 333.12] we've proven that wrong with evidence
[330.28 - 335.68] that's seven major falsities that Ashley
[333.12 - 337.32] was proven wrong on last year seven
[335.68 - 339.60] major falsities that were designed to
[337.32 - 341.36] tarnish Anthony's reputation and to
[339.60 - 344.20] scare people away from applying medical
[341.36 - 346.92] medium information to heal seven major
[344.20 - 349.68] falsities that harmed many people's real
[346.92 - 352.00] lives seven major falsities that Ashley
[349.68 - 353.96] needs to be held accountable for among
[352.00 - 356.72] all of the other falsities and lies that
[353.96 - 359.16] have been produced by her since this is
[356.72 - 361.48] the false story that Ashley took the
[359.16 - 363.68] vanity fair when the journalist Dan
[361.48 - 366.92] Adler reached out to me regarding the
[363.68 - 369.68] hit piece she had him working on I was
[366.92 - 372.12] sent a list of hundreds of questions the
[369.68 - 374.44] questions that were asked line up and
[372.12 - 378.32] coordinate exactly with Ashley's
[374.44 - 379.80] original false Stephy story from 2020 we
[378.32 - 382.52] are going to be reading off those
[379.80 - 385.80] questions in an upcoming episode Vanity
[382.52 - 387.84] Fair manipulated material and got so
[385.80 - 389.68] many things wrong in the story they
[387.84 - 392.72] published and that is going to be
[389.68 - 395.48] thoroughly exposed in this series but
[392.72 - 397.60] there's a reason why even Vanity Fair
[395.48 - 400.64] would not publish these falsities from
[397.60 - 402.76] Ashley that Ashley wanted them to the
[400.64 - 404.52] plotters have since expressed dismay
[402.76 - 407.52] with Vanity Fair by stating that the
[404.52 - 410.80] article only quote skim the surface the
[407.52 - 413.32] article is a lie it just isn't as big of
[410.80 - 415.92] a lie as they wanted it to
[413.32 - 417.60] be we held back on a lot last time
[415.92 - 419.24] around with these podcasts to give
[417.60 - 422.32] Ashley an opportunity to do the right
[419.24 - 424.36] thing and at the very least just stop
[422.32 - 426.60] lying and spreading
[424.36 - 428.52] misinformation not only has Ashley not
[426.60 - 431.16] taken any accountability for the major
[428.52 - 433.36] falsi she's been proven wrong on but
[431.16 - 436.00] rather she has since continued on with
[433.36 - 437.88] her deranged plot she's pivoted she's
[436.00 - 440.44] created new false narratives and she's
[437.88 - 443.56] manufactured and spread an unimaginable
[440.44 - 445.60] number of New Lies I suspect that
[443.56 - 447.88] another motive of Ashley's now is to try
[445.60 - 449.92] to cover her tracks because we exposed
[447.88 - 452.08] in a large scale that her original story
[449.92 - 455.28] about Stephanie was fabricated and that
[452.08 - 457.60] she was lying from the very beginning we
[455.28 - 459.40] have also only just begun to publicize
[457.60 - 461.84] the evidence of the true corruption that
[459.40 - 463.72] took place in the process of Ashley and
[461.84 - 466.24] the other plotters pushing their false
[463.72 - 467.96] storyline onto Vanity Fair having to
[466.24 - 471.00] hammer it into the head of the
[467.96 - 473.48] journalist and having to threaten him to
[471.00 - 475.04] get him to publish it yes you heard that
[473.48 - 477.48] right if you're new to the series it's
[475.04 - 480.48] all on recorded calls and there's a lot
[477.48 - 482.44] more that's coming Ashley probably feels
[480.48 - 484.88] like she has to keep going and trying to
[482.44 - 486.96] come up with more lies and stories and
[484.88 - 488.88] trying to drum up fake controversy to
[486.96 - 491.96] keep up the facade so that she doesn't
[488.88 - 494.36] look like the liar that she is but being
[491.96 - 497.08] dishonest and manipulative can only ever
[494.36 - 500.68] get you so far we are going to be
[497.08 - 503.12] exposing all of it it's all coming out
[500.68 - 505.32] now Ashley's pattern is that when she
[503.12 - 508.00] gets proven wrong she pivots to other
[505.32 - 509.48] topics and she deflects it's a tactic
[508.00 - 511.52] meant to distract everyone who's listen
[509.48 - 513.68] listening to her by throwing more
[511.52 - 516.08] seemingly inflammatory false information
[513.68 - 518.20] about Anthony at them to divert their
[516.08 - 521.72] attention away from the fact that their
[518.20 - 524.68] leader Ashley was proven wrong and is
[521.72 - 526.68] lying so I implore anyone who's left out
[524.68 - 530.16] there still taking Ashley seriously in
[526.68 - 532.84] any way to ask themselves this if Ashley
[530.16 - 535.40] is so principled about honesty and the
[532.84 - 537.96] truth as she so claims then why hasn't
[535.40 - 540.40] she addressed any one of these seven
[537.96 - 542.48] major things that she spread online that
[540.40 - 545.44] she brought to the media and that she
[542.48 - 547.00] got so blatantly and provably wrong I
[545.44 - 550.56] will let you sit with
[547.00 - 552.68] that one of Ashley's true obsessions is
[550.56 - 555.52] repeatedly declaring how perfectly
[552.68 - 557.36] honest and morally Superior she is at
[555.52 - 560.20] the same time as she incessantly calls
[557.36 - 563.56] Anthony a liar sometimes multiple times
[560.20 - 565.48] per day it seems like Ashley thinks if
[563.56 - 567.88] she just repeats the words and accuses
[565.48 - 570.32] him enough times that people will submit
[567.88 - 572.04] and believe her regard L of how much the
[570.32 - 574.32] substance of her arguments either makes
[572.04 - 577.00] no sense at all or is just verifiably
[574.32 - 579.00] wrong that is the definition of true
[577.00 - 581.16] brainwashing and
[579.00 - 583.00] indoctrination after our podcast came
[581.16 - 585.12] out that exposed her and the other
[583.00 - 587.48] individuals involved with this plot
[585.12 - 590.16] using their own words on recording
[587.48 - 593.88] Ashley really ramped up this behavior
[590.16 - 597.00] for example on April 20th of 2023 Ashley
[593.88 - 599.96] changed her Instagram bio to
[597.00 - 606.04] read in case anyone comes looking for
[599.96 - 608.40] information about mm/ Amber frauds and
[606.04 - 610.76] Liars of course she now attacks and
[608.40 - 613.24] targets me as well because I am the one
[610.76 - 616.52] who exposed her and her friends using
[613.24 - 618.52] their own words on recordings around the
[616.52 - 620.56] same time Ashley posted the following
[618.52 - 623.84] comment and then deleted it along with
[620.56 - 625.40] the post that was attached to it shortly
[623.84 - 629.32] after
[625.40 - 632.36] period I will die on this hill if some
[629.32 - 634.56] someone literally pointed a gun at me
[632.36 - 639.32] and asked me to say something other than
[634.56 - 643.80] the truth I am telling I would not do it
[639.32 - 643.80] if I don't have my Integrity I have
[643.84 - 649.80] nothing when asked by a commenter do you
[647.04 - 651.28] seriously believe your own
[649.80 - 654.44] Ashley
[651.28 - 657.40] replied I believe fully and the truth of
[654.44 - 662.84] what I'm saying
[657.40 - 666.08] yes and on May 5th of 2023 Ashley posted
[662.84 - 668.24] this when Anthony started spewing more
[666.08 - 671.28] of his dark lies on his wacky and
[668.24 - 674.52] idiotic podcast because of the impending
[671.28 - 678.48] Vanity Fair article I realized just how
[674.52 - 682.04] confused and lost people would
[678.48 - 684.24] be Ashley has yet to produce a single
[682.04 - 687.20] piece of legitimate evidence that
[684.24 - 690.40] Anthony or I have lied about a single
[687.20 - 693.08] thing she's only just to spin ridiculous
[690.40 - 695.48] false stories get things wrong spread
[693.08 - 696.80] ridiculous rumors and other plotters who
[695.48 - 698.84] might think that they've got something
[696.80 - 700.88] with PO on social media they are very
[698.84 - 703.76] wrong and that will all be exposed in
[700.88 - 705.52] due time meanwhile Ashley and her
[703.76 - 707.48] hateful group continue to ignore the
[705.52 - 709.80] fact that Ashley was proven wrong on
[707.48 - 712.72] these seven major falsities and more
[709.80 - 714.92] with evidence after the podcast came out
[712.72 - 716.88] last year Ashley went on a whole Rampage
[714.92 - 720.16] about lying as she tried to deflect
[716.88 - 722.08] attention away from that in that Rampage
[720.16 - 724.00] Ashley used a well-known true story
[722.08 - 727.36] about the experiences of a family that
[724.00 - 730.48] saved the lives of an estimated 800 Jews
[727.36 - 732.28] and other refugees during the Holocaust
[730.48 - 734.68] Ashley used the story to try to make a
[732.28 - 736.92] ludicrous point about lying and in the
[734.68 - 740.72] process of doing so Ashley ironically
[736.92 - 742.80] got no less than 18 facts wrong she
[740.72 - 745.08] expressed extremely offensive viewpoints
[742.80 - 746.92] regarding the Holocaust she disgraced
[745.08 - 748.80] the names of honorary women who risked
[746.92 - 751.72] their lives to save others during World
[748.80 - 754.40] War II too and Ashley provided a perfect
[751.72 - 756.92] example that everyone can verify of just
[754.40 - 759.24] How Deeply she manipulates butchers and
[756.92 - 762.20] twist the story she tells to serve her
[759.24 - 763.96] own agenda we are going to read off what
[762.20 - 766.24] Ashley posted and then I'm going to
[763.96 - 770.08] unpack all of the 18 things that she got
[766.24 - 772.76] wrong one by one almost every single
[770.08 - 775.80] sentence of Ashley's entire series is
[772.76 - 777.92] wrong in some way the story of the ten
[775.80 - 780.28] booom family was recounted in a book
[777.92 - 782.48] called The Hiding Place written by Corey
[780.28 - 784.44] ten booom I read it cover to cover
[782.48 - 786.08] myself and anyone out there can use this
[784.44 - 787.88] book to independently fact check
[786.08 - 790.76] Ashley's false information for
[787.88 - 792.32] themselves I encourage you to do so for
[790.76 - 793.84] context here's some background on the
[792.32 - 796.12] ten booom family from the official
[793.84 - 799.48] website of the museum dedicated to
[796.12 - 801.44] preserving its historical Legacy it says
[799.48 - 804.12] during the second world war the tboom
[801.44 - 807.04] home became a refuge a hiding place for
[804.12 - 808.80] fugitives and those hunted by the Nazis
[807.04 - 811.08] by protecting these people Casper and
[808.80 - 813.60] his daughter daughters Betsy and Corey
[811.08 - 815.88] risked their lives this non-violent
[813.60 - 817.52] resistance against the Nazi oppressors
[815.88 - 820.76] was the ten boom's way of living out
[817.52 - 823.92] their Christian faith during 1943 and
[820.76 - 825.88] into 1944 there were usually five to six
[823.92 - 828.32] people illegally living in the tboom
[825.88 - 830.44] home some of whom were Jews and other
[828.32 - 832.16] members of the Dutch underground
[830.44 - 834.56] additional refugees would stay with the
[832.16 - 836.16] tenb Booms for a few hours or a few days
[834.56 - 838.60] until another safe house could be
[836.16 - 840.60] located for them through these
[838.60 - 843.04] activities the tboom family and their
[840.60 - 845.40] many friends and co-workers of the bay
[843.04 - 848.40] group saved the lives of an estimated
[845.40 - 851.36] 800 Jews and other
[848.40 - 854.44] refugees in July of last year Ashley
[851.36 - 858.24] posted the following
[854.44 - 860.76] series okay question do you believe that
[858.24 - 862.76] sometimes lying to them is in people's
[860.76 - 866.52] best
[862.76 - 870.44] interest I am a lying is never the right
[866.52 - 874.92] choice person no matter what what I want
[870.44 - 878.20] to share the story that convicted me of
[874.92 - 881.28] this Betsy 10 boom was personally
[878.20 - 885.48] convicted about honesty she and her
[881.28 - 888.12] family including Corey ten Boom H juw in
[885.48 - 891.84] their house throughout World War II and
[888.12 - 895.76] were eventually arrested Betsy died in
[891.84 - 898.52] Raybrook concentration
[895.76 - 901.44] camp okay already we have falsity number
[898.52 - 903.44] one it was Betsy's sister nollie and
[901.44 - 905.48] nollie's daughter cocky who were
[903.44 - 907.52] convicted about honesty and struggled
[905.48 - 910.72] with the concept of telling lies in
[907.52 - 912.68] order to save Jewish life not Betsy
[910.72 - 915.04] Betsy was clear in her stance that under
[912.68 - 916.68] the circumstances of the Nazi regime it
[915.04 - 918.44] was the right thing to do to lie when
[916.68 - 921.16] necessary for the purposes of saving
[918.44 - 923.40] innocent lives Ashley also got the name
[921.16 - 927.28] of the Concentration Camp wrong it's
[923.40 - 929.76] Raven's Brook not Rave Brook she
[927.28 - 932.52] continues
[929.76 - 935.12] her sister Corey recounted a story of
[932.52 - 935.12] Betsy's
[935.20 - 940.44] honesty falsity number two again it was
[938.64 - 942.76] not Betsy who was convicted about
[940.44 - 945.68] honesty it was nollie and nollie's
[942.76 - 947.68] daughter cocky and we've got falsity
[945.68 - 950.56] number three here what Ashley is
[947.68 - 952.40] referring to is not a singular story as
[950.56 - 953.96] we go through the next several posts
[952.40 - 956.28] you'll see that Ashley incorrectly
[953.96 - 959.28] conflated multiple stories of separate
[956.28 - 959.28] instances
[959.60 - 965.40] once when German soldiers came to search
[962.68 - 968.08] the house there was not time for the
[965.40 - 973.36] Jews staying with them at that time to
[968.08 - 973.36] fully hide so they hid under the kitchen
[973.40 - 979.16] table we've got falsity number four the
[976.64 - 982.20] incident involving the kitchen table in
[979.16 - 984.32] fact occurred when there was a ria a ria
[982.20 - 986.40] was a hostile raid during which the
[984.32 - 988.52] Germans would come to forcibly enlist
[986.40 - 991.28] young males in Holland to work in
[988.52 - 993.00] munition factories the ten booom family
[991.28 - 995.40] had the young men in their household
[993.00 - 998.00] hide in a cellar with a trapo underneath
[995.40 - 1000.88] the kitchen table we've got falsity
[998.00 - 1003.24] number five the target of this raid was
[1000.88 - 1005.88] not Jews to be placed in concentration
[1003.24 - 1008.12] camps it was Dutch boys like Cory's
[1005.88 - 1009.32] nephews that the Nazis wanted to enlist
[1008.12 - 1012.56] to work in
[1009.32 - 1015.16] factories and falsity number six during
[1012.56 - 1016.80] the Ria Cory's nephews did not hide
[1015.16 - 1020.04] underneath the table because they didn't
[1016.80 - 1021.92] have enough time to quote fully hide
[1020.04 - 1023.32] there was actually a Cellar underneath
[1021.92 - 1025.52] the kitchen table that had been
[1023.32 - 1028.00] specifically designed for hiding from
[1025.52 - 1029.84] Nazi soldiers and other threats The
[1028.00 - 1032.24] Cellar under the table is exactly where
[1029.84 - 1036.28] the boys intended to
[1032.24 - 1039.80] go a German soldier asked bety directly
[1036.28 - 1043.44] are there any Jews hiding in this
[1039.80 - 1046.24] house falsity number seven this is not
[1043.44 - 1048.32] the question that was asked in fact the
[1046.24 - 1051.12] German Soldier asked where are your
[1048.32 - 1054.68] brothers do you have brothers how old
[1051.12 - 1056.36] are they where are they now again in
[1054.68 - 1060.40] this incident the soldiers were looking
[1056.36 - 1063.00] for Dutch boys not Jews and falsity
[1060.40 - 1067.08] number eight it was not Betsy who the
[1063.00 - 1070.68] soldiers questioned it was cocky Betsy's
[1067.08 - 1073.08] niece she said yes they are under the
[1070.68 - 1073.08] kitchen
[1073.16 - 1080.20] table falsity number nine this is not
[1076.88 - 1082.88] what happened cocky not Betsy at first
[1080.20 - 1084.80] tried to avoid the question next when
[1082.88 - 1087.08] pressured cocky tells the soldiers that
[1084.80 - 1089.36] two of her brothers were under the table
[1087.08 - 1091.64] but then cocky burst out laughing which
[1089.36 - 1094.32] tricked them the Nazis thought that she
[1091.64 - 1097.84] was joking they got upset and they left
[1094.32 - 1101.24] the soldiers did not capture any of the
[1097.84 - 1103.56] boys her sister Cory was horrified and
[1101.24 - 1107.12] crushed the couple was arrested and
[1103.56 - 1110.76] taken away to a concentration camp Betsy
[1107.12 - 1110.76] held fast to her conviction
[1111.80 - 1118.20] this post unbelievably has four
[1114.32 - 1119.92] falsities in one falsity number 10 this
[1118.20 - 1121.72] is where Ashley began conflating
[1119.92 - 1123.08] different incidents there was a
[1121.72 - 1124.92] different event separate from the
[1123.08 - 1127.76] kitchen table story in which one
[1124.92 - 1129.92] individual woman not a couple was taken
[1127.76 - 1132.08] away to the old Jewish theater in
[1129.92 - 1133.64] Amsterdam the theater was a holding
[1132.08 - 1135.92] place from which Jews could be
[1133.64 - 1139.00] transported to concentration camps it
[1135.92 - 1141.68] was not a concentration camp itself
[1139.00 - 1143.56] falsity number 11 even in this other
[1141.68 - 1145.36] incident that occurred at a completely
[1143.56 - 1148.04] different time than the kitchen table
[1145.36 - 1150.16] Story the Jewish woman who was captured
[1148.04 - 1154.08] Analise was never taken to a
[1150.16 - 1156.80] concentration camp falsity number 12
[1154.08 - 1158.80] Corey was not horrified nor crushed by
[1156.80 - 1160.92] the kitchen table incident the kitchen
[1158.80 - 1163.12] table incident in fact made Corey start
[1160.92 - 1165.12] to question the logic of nollie and her
[1163.12 - 1167.76] daughter cocky who nearly gave her
[1165.12 - 1169.44] brothers up to the Nazis Cory was
[1167.76 - 1171.56] horrified and crushed by the theater
[1169.44 - 1173.56] incident that resulted in Analise being
[1171.56 - 1174.44] captured by the Nazis which happened
[1173.56 - 1178.84] later
[1174.44 - 1180.92] on falsity number 13 it was not Betsy
[1178.84 - 1183.12] who held fast to her conviction it was
[1180.92 - 1185.44] nollie and it was in a completely
[1183.12 - 1188.36] different
[1185.44 - 1190.84] incident less than a week later the
[1188.36 - 1194.48] Concentration Camp those Jews were taken
[1190.84 - 1196.56] to was liberated by Allied Forces and
[1194.48 - 1199.32] everyone there was transported to
[1196.56 - 1201.76] Freedom including the couple that had
[1199.32 - 1205.64] been in
[1201.76 - 1209.48] hiding and this one post from Ashley
[1205.64 - 1212.04] shockingly has five falsities in it
[1209.48 - 1214.04] falsity number 14 the kitchen table
[1212.04 - 1216.36] incident was further than a week apart
[1214.04 - 1218.60] from this event Ashley conflated
[1216.36 - 1222.04] different incidents and got the timeline
[1218.60 - 1224.16] wrong falsity number 15 in the other
[1222.04 - 1226.32] story involving Analise it was not a
[1224.16 - 1228.68] concentration camp that got liberated
[1226.32 - 1231.84] Analise was being held in the old Jewish
[1228.68 - 1234.44] theater and the theater was broken into
[1231.84 - 1236.44] falsity number 16 the book does not
[1234.44 - 1240.56] specify that the theater was broken into
[1236.44 - 1242.20] by Allied Forces falsity number 17 not
[1240.56 - 1245.44] everyone in the theater was transported
[1242.20 - 1247.36] to Freedom only 40 Jews were rescued and
[1245.44 - 1248.64] it was not a concentration camp that
[1247.36 - 1252.40] they were coming
[1248.64 - 1254.72] from and falsity number 18 Analise was
[1252.40 - 1256.76] part of those 40 rescued Jews but she
[1254.72 - 1258.72] was not part of a couple like Ashley
[1256.76 - 1261.36] said
[1258.72 - 1264.56] it is not our job to control the outcome
[1261.36 - 1267.40] of our actions it is not our job to
[1264.56 - 1270.36] decide how and when the truth should be
[1267.40 - 1275.68] known we either believe in the immutable
[1270.36 - 1275.68] importance of it or we don't
[1276.12 - 1280.72] period here Ashley concludes her
[1278.84 - 1283.12] mutilated version of The Story by
[1280.72 - 1285.20] asserting her ridiculous Viewpoint that
[1283.12 - 1287.12] anyone who lied to the Nazis to protect
[1285.20 - 1291.12] and save the lives of Jews during the
[1287.12 - 1294.00] Holocaust was morally wrong following
[1291.12 - 1295.64] her asinine logic Ashley is saying that
[1294.00 - 1298.08] she believes everyone should have been
[1295.64 - 1300.44] honest with the na soldiers even if it
[1298.08 - 1302.96] led to more Jews being Mass
[1300.44 - 1304.84] murdered Ashley declares that one should
[1302.96 - 1307.28] not be concerned with the consequences
[1304.84 - 1309.68] of their actions even in the context of
[1307.28 - 1311.04] the Holocaust and even if their actions
[1309.68 - 1314.64] enabled
[1311.04 - 1314.64] genocide truly
[1314.80 - 1320.80] unbelievable people who lie are liars if
[1318.68 - 1323.04] you're willing to lie about one thing
[1320.80 - 1326.16] you might be willing to lie about
[1323.04 - 1328.64] everything One Lie calls into question
[1326.16 - 1334.56] the entirety of someone's
[1328.64 - 1334.56] character what about two three 4 100
[1334.76 - 1342.60] lies I mean how much more ironic could
[1338.32 - 1345.52] this possibly be Ashley Foster told 18
[1342.60 - 1347.32] falsities 18 falsities in a story she
[1345.52 - 1350.28] tried to use to make an absurd point
[1347.32 - 1353.20] about lying this series was all about
[1350.28 - 1355.16] Ashley's Doctrine on always being honest
[1353.20 - 1357.88] which Ashley claims she aderes to
[1355.16 - 1360.20] perfectly and she's literally violating
[1357.88 - 1361.64] that in the very story she used to try
[1360.20 - 1364.48] to make that
[1361.64 - 1367.16] point and then here Ashley even went as
[1364.48 - 1369.28] far as to use derogatory terms to refer
[1367.16 - 1372.08] to what the tboom family heroically did
[1369.28 - 1375.28] to protect and save the lives of 800
[1372.08 - 1377.20] innocent people from being murdered if
[1375.28 - 1379.04] the members of the tboom family did not
[1377.20 - 1381.68] lie to the Nazi oppress
[1379.04 - 1384.20] who were committing atrocities those 800
[1381.68 - 1386.52] Jews would have died and Ashley has the
[1384.20 - 1388.84] audacity to call into question the
[1386.52 - 1391.48] entirety of the ten booom family's
[1388.84 - 1394.24] character who cares if people are being
[1391.48 - 1395.96] tortured abused and murdered it's not
[1394.24 - 1398.16] your job to worry at all about the
[1395.96 - 1400.32] consequences of your actions what's
[1398.16 - 1402.12] important according to Ashley is that
[1400.32 - 1403.96] you try to prove your own superiority
[1402.12 - 1405.56] like she's trying to do with this warped
[1403.96 - 1407.84] story that she
[1405.56 - 1411.52] invented this is not about promoting
[1407.84 - 1414.40] lying it's about having sanity Ashley
[1411.52 - 1416.84] could have used anything any other story
[1414.40 - 1419.20] or anecdote or something else to express
[1416.84 - 1422.32] herself and make the claim that she
[1419.20 - 1425.76] doesn't believe in lying but to use this
[1422.32 - 1429.32] story in this way let alone distorting
[1425.76 - 1432.24] it with 18 falsities in the process to
[1429.32 - 1433.84] say that when faced with Nazis asking
[1432.24 - 1435.92] about Jews hiding in your home during
[1433.84 - 1437.72] the Holocaust knowing that they are
[1435.92 - 1439.96] going to be taken to a concentration
[1437.72 - 1443.20] camp at Ashley saying that she would
[1439.96 - 1445.84] give up the Jews it's a window into how
[1443.20 - 1449.00] Ashley thinks this is what we're dealing
[1445.84 - 1452.24] with who in their right mind thinks like
[1449.00 - 1455.12] this Ashley's entire false story about
[1452.24 - 1458.04] Stephanie was built on her original
[1455.12 - 1460.36] claim I never told Stephanie to see a
[1458.04 - 1462.72] doctor and not once did Ashley ever
[1460.36 - 1465.16] reach out to me or call me up and say
[1462.72 - 1468.04] hey what's up did you tell Stephanie to
[1465.16 - 1471.60] see a doctor but because she lied she
[1468.04 - 1473.88] had a save face and stay with the lie
[1471.60 - 1476.08] and that takes a certain kind of person
[1473.88 - 1479.08] a person who doesn't want to admit a
[1476.08 - 1482.80] huge mistake a person who doesn't want
[1479.08 - 1486.36] to come clean and keeps going making
[1482.80 - 1488.88] more huge false claims lies and mistakes
[1486.36 - 1492.16] if anyone wants a window into Ashley's
[1488.88 - 1495.12] mind it's this Holocaust story tell
[1492.16 - 1497.96] dozens and dozens of lies and falsities
[1495.12 - 1499.16] and then say how one should never tell a
[1497.96 - 1501.44] lie
[1499.16 - 1503.44] so much so that it's best to just call
[1501.44 - 1506.48] out the Jews hiding underneath the table
[1503.44 - 1509.48] to the Nazis you have the daughter of a
[1506.48 - 1512.44] billionaire family that lies and tells
[1509.48 - 1515.48] falsities and she's using this false
[1512.44 - 1517.88] story about the Holocaust to try to give
[1515.48 - 1520.68] you permission to not care about the
[1517.88 - 1523.60] consequences of your actions this is the
[1520.68 - 1526.40] entitlement of Ashley who doesn't care
[1523.60 - 1528.88] about who gets harmed by a false story
[1526.40 - 1531.44] she just wants her documentary she
[1528.88 - 1534.28] doesn't care who's in the
[1531.44 - 1536.36] way when Ashley's business proposals got
[1534.28 - 1537.92] turned down by Anthony and her big
[1536.36 - 1540.32] career dreams didn't work out the way
[1537.92 - 1542.92] that she wanted them to Ashley set out
[1540.32 - 1545.28] on this mission to tear Anthony down to
[1542.92 - 1548.24] constantly take stabs at him to try to
[1545.28 - 1550.20] blast him in the media to attack him to
[1548.24 - 1552.92] put him and the entire medical medium
[1550.20 - 1555.68] Community down to be little and demean
[1552.92 - 1557.60] them to try to make them feel small and
[1555.68 - 1559.48] there is no low that she will not stoop
[1557.60 - 1561.88] to in her
[1559.48 - 1564.88] Pursuit what makes Ashley's series on
[1561.88 - 1566.76] lying even more of an absolute farce is
[1564.88 - 1569.24] the fact that Ashley Gravely missed the
[1566.76 - 1571.68] mark on what the actual ten booom story
[1569.24 - 1573.12] portrays about lying which is very
[1571.68 - 1576.36] different from the story that Ashley
[1573.12 - 1578.24] seems to have made up in her head Betsy
[1576.36 - 1580.80] and Corey tboom took on the role of
[1578.24 - 1583.76] protecting and saving Jews they are the
[1580.80 - 1585.92] heroes of the story their sister nollie
[1583.76 - 1587.56] and nollie's daughter cocky are the ones
[1585.92 - 1590.48] who were struggling with the concept of
[1587.56 - 1592.96] lying not Betsy whom Ashley confused
[1590.48 - 1596.28] them with throughout the story nollie's
[1592.96 - 1599.24] family pointed out nollie's illogic
[1596.28 - 1601.36] nollie was still doing lies with her
[1599.24 - 1604.08] actions even if she wouldn't tell lies
[1601.36 - 1605.68] from her lips with words and nalii
[1604.08 - 1606.88] taught her daughter to think in the same
[1605.68 - 1610.04] illogical
[1606.88 - 1612.80] way for example to nollie as well as
[1610.04 - 1615.00] cocky it was okay to partake in creating
[1612.80 - 1617.56] the hiding place in the cellar under the
[1615.00 - 1620.20] kitchen table for her sons to deceive
[1617.56 - 1622.04] and hide from from German soldiers in
[1620.20 - 1624.00] but when the soldiers asked cocky a
[1622.04 - 1626.20] question she felt that she must tell the
[1624.00 - 1629.00] truth from her lips even though it
[1626.20 - 1631.08] nearly harmed her own brothers and then
[1629.00 - 1632.88] cocky also burst out laughing during
[1631.08 - 1634.64] this incident which made it seem like
[1632.88 - 1636.88] she was joking about the boys being
[1634.64 - 1639.72] under the table and that was not
[1636.88 - 1641.64] truthful it was an inconsistency that
[1639.72 - 1644.44] was directly addressed in the book
[1641.64 - 1647.76] itself such as in the following excerpt
[1644.44 - 1649.76] written by Cory tboom it says it was a
[1647.76 - 1651.48] strange dinner party that evening
[1649.76 - 1653.24] veering as it did from heartfelt
[1651.48 - 1655.28] Thanksgiving to the nearest thing to a
[1653.24 - 1658.84] bitter argument our closet family has
[1655.28 - 1661.48] ever had nollie stuck by cocky insisting
[1658.84 - 1664.92] she would have answered the same way God
[1661.48 - 1664.92] honors truthtellah
[1678.40 - 1683.60] uniform on
[1680.64 - 1685.44] Katrine nonetheless Ashley goes on to
[1683.60 - 1687.52] end her depraved series with the
[1685.44 - 1690.60] following
[1687.52 - 1691.48] quote choose your Leaders with wisdom
[1690.60 - 1694.44] and
[1691.48 - 1699.80] forethought to be led by a liar is to
[1694.44 - 1699.80] ask to be told lies Octavia E
[1700.04 - 1705.84] Butler 18 falsities later and on top of
[1703.64 - 1708.36] the repulsive spin she put on a
[1705.84 - 1711.24] holocaust story Ashley ALS also
[1708.36 - 1713.52] disrespected the names of true heroes
[1711.24 - 1715.68] Betsy and Cory tboom were incredible
[1713.52 - 1718.32] honorable
[1715.68 - 1720.68] leaders by demonizing the decisions
[1718.32 - 1723.00] these women made under entirely evil
[1720.68 - 1725.32] circumstances in order to save hundreds
[1723.00 - 1727.96] of people's lives Ashley utterly
[1725.32 - 1729.52] disgraces the tboom Legacy and all of
[1727.96 - 1732.28] those who fought the absolutely
[1729.52 - 1734.08] reprehensible acts of the Nazi regime
[1732.28 - 1735.96] including the 6 million Jews who
[1734.08 - 1738.20] perished during the
[1735.96 - 1741.20] Holocaust and then of course what
[1738.20 - 1744.60] Ashley's inferring with all of this is
[1741.20 - 1747.04] that I'm a liar and that she's not she's
[1744.60 - 1749.00] saying that she's such an honest person
[1747.04 - 1751.08] she wouldn't even lie to protect a Jew
[1749.00 - 1755.44] during the Holocaust while she's telling
[1751.08 - 1759.48] a story herself with 18 falsities in
[1755.44 - 1762.96] it this is Ashley's pattern she accuses
[1759.48 - 1766.80] people of what she's actually doing
[1762.96 - 1769.20] Ashley lies Ashley tells false stories
[1766.80 - 1772.60] Ashley's version of Hiding Place story
[1769.20 - 1775.56] had 18 falsities in it in Ashley's March
[1772.60 - 1777.64] 6th 2020 Instagram post about Stephanie
[1775.56 - 1779.84] there were more than 15
[1777.64 - 1782.36] falsities in the comment section of
[1779.84 - 1785.32] Ashley's March 6th 2020 Instagram post
[1782.36 - 1786.36] about Stephanie Ashley told more than 15
[1785.32 - 1789.32] additional
[1786.36 - 1791.08] falsities in Ashley's March 7th 2020
[1789.32 - 1792.76] blog post about Stephanie there were
[1791.08 - 1794.88] more than 20
[1792.76 - 1797.52] falsities in the comment section of
[1794.88 - 1799.96] Ashley's February 11th 2020 Instagram
[1797.52 - 1801.64] post about Stephanie Ashley told more
[1799.96 - 1804.64] than 10
[1801.64 - 1808.40] falsities in just these few instances
[1804.64 - 1810.56] alone Ashley told a total of 78
[1808.40 - 1812.96] verifiable lies and
[1810.56 - 1815.32] falsities for someone who supposedly
[1812.96 - 1817.28] feels so strongly about the truth that
[1815.32 - 1819.48] she believes it's not even right to lie
[1817.28 - 1821.88] to save a Jew's life during the
[1819.48 - 1824.24] Holocaust for someone who claimed that
[1821.88 - 1827.00] they a lying is never the right choice
[1824.24 - 1829.72] person no matter what that's a lot of
[1827.00 - 1833.12] falsities
[1829.72 - 1836.40] I am a lying is never the right choice
[1833.12 - 1840.12] person no matter
[1836.40 - 1843.68] what a lying is never the right choice
[1840.12 - 1845.48] person no matter what H but wait a
[1843.68 - 1847.64] second in addition to the immeasurable
[1845.48 - 1850.16] number of falsities and Flatout lies
[1847.64 - 1852.44] Ashley has continued to spew in the last
[1850.16 - 1854.76] year like saying that her family doesn't
[1852.44 - 1856.76] have a private jet or vacation homes
[1854.76 - 1859.72] when they do and that she's never made
[1856.76 - 1862.16] money off of Instagram when she has
[1859.72 - 1864.88] Ashley also has a documented record of
[1862.16 - 1868.44] instructing other people to lie and be
[1864.88 - 1870.92] dishonest for her in fact I am one of
[1868.44 - 1872.68] those people in my calls with the
[1870.92 - 1875.20] plotters last year after they had
[1872.68 - 1877.64] explained their plan to smear Anthony
[1875.20 - 1880.36] and try to create a post-medical medium
[1877.64 - 1882.20] era Ashley said this to
[1880.36 - 1885.96] me
[1882.20 - 1889.88] so I'm just grateful that you that
[1885.96 - 1893.36] you're on that um that you're exploring
[1889.88 - 1897.72] that now and and I hope that you'll
[1893.36 - 1897.72] honor Robbie and Taylor's confidence
[1898.00 - 1906.48] by by um by not sharing
[1902.64 - 1909.20] with oh anything with Anthony until it's
[1906.48 - 1911.72] the right time it's a little bit of a
[1909.20 - 1915.32] it's a little bit of a d Dynamite like a
[1911.72 - 1915.32] loaded situation right
[1915.52 - 1922.48] now and Taylor said this to me as
[1919.64 - 1924.72] well
[1922.48 - 1927.56] sure can we hear that
[1924.72 - 1929.96] again to make sure you wouldn't tell
[1927.56 - 1933.36] Anthony I wanted to make sure you
[1929.96 - 1935.56] wouldn't tell Anthony the plotters and
[1933.36 - 1937.52] Ashley specifically wanted me to keep
[1935.56 - 1939.96] everything they told me a secret from
[1937.52 - 1942.16] Anthony if Anthony had reached out and
[1939.96 - 1944.28] asked me what was going on Ashley's
[1942.16 - 1947.20] expectation was that I was supposed to
[1944.28 - 1949.24] lie to him Ashley apparently believes
[1947.20 - 1951.68] it's never the right choice to lie not
[1949.24 - 1953.84] under any circumstance no matter what
[1951.68 - 1954.96] not even to save people's lives during
[1953.84 - 1957.16] the
[1954.96 - 1959.60] Holocaust except when Ashley wanted me
[1957.16 - 1961.92] to lie for the benefit of her and her
[1959.60 - 1965.80] friends that was somehow
[1961.92 - 1968.68] okay on July 16th of 2018 a friend
[1965.80 - 1970.56] texted Ashley and said by the way a pure
[1968.68 - 1972.60] encapsulations order I placed went
[1970.56 - 1974.16] missing and they are calling me but just
[1972.60 - 1977.00] in case they accidentally call your
[1974.16 - 1979.24] number that's why haha and Ashley
[1977.00 - 1981.12] replied
[1979.24 - 1983.84] okay just tell them I pleas the order
[1981.12 - 1987.88] for you because I'm not supposed to let
[1983.84 - 1990.88] people use my account
[1987.88 - 1992.96] LOL so here Ashley is letting a friend
[1990.88 - 1994.64] use her supplement purchasing account
[1992.96 - 1997.36] and she's acknowledging that she's not
[1994.64 - 1999.52] supposed to this is what Corey and Betsy
[1997.36 - 2003.84] tboom from The Hiding Place story that
[1999.52 - 2005.76] Ashley referenced would call doing a lie
[2003.84 - 2007.80] then Ashley's also instructing her
[2005.76 - 2010.20] friend in this text to lie about who
[2007.80 - 2012.60] placed her supplement order as her
[2010.20 - 2014.76] actions make very clear Ashley said she
[2012.60 - 2017.04] is a lying is never the right choice
[2014.76 - 2018.76] type of person only because that suited
[2017.04 - 2020.88] her Narrative of the moment as that is
[2018.76 - 2022.68] obviously not something Ashley actually
[2020.88 - 2025.56] believes in or lives
[2022.68 - 2027.84] by again we're not arguing for or
[2025.56 - 2029.96] against the morality of lying here I'm
[2027.84 - 2033.12] simply pointing out the absolutely
[2029.96 - 2035.88] unhinged contradictions in Ashley's own
[2033.12 - 2038.32] thinking writing speech and
[2035.88 - 2040.68] behavior since the beginning of Ashley's
[2038.32 - 2042.68] mission to smear Anthony Ashley has
[2040.68 - 2044.36] attempted to shield and cover for her
[2042.68 - 2047.40] falsities by saying that she's just
[2044.36 - 2049.68] sharing her truth she's also tried to
[2047.40 - 2051.64] infer credibility based on her purported
[2049.68 - 2054.16] direct experience with Stephanie for a
[2051.64 - 2055.76] short period of time in the comment
[2054.16 - 2059.32] section of a post Ashley made on
[2055.76 - 2062.80] February 11th of 2020 she said
[2059.32 - 2065.68] this the reason I chose to share exactly
[2062.80 - 2067.68] what I did about her story is because I
[2065.68 - 2070.48] was there for that small part in physic
[2067.68 - 2073.96] physically present with her so I felt
[2070.48 - 2073.96] like something I could share
[2074.04 - 2078.60] truthfully in this comment Ashley is
[2076.60 - 2081.40] referring to the false timeline that she
[2078.60 - 2083.04] also repeated later on in 2020 in which
[2081.40 - 2084.60] Ashley stated that Stephanie had
[2083.04 - 2087.32] discovered her breast lump while
[2084.60 - 2090.40] Stephanie was staying with Ashley in
[2087.32 - 2092.72] 2016 as we've shared many times this is
[2090.40 - 2094.08] incorrect the evidence clearly shows
[2092.72 - 2097.76] that Stephanie discovered her breast
[2094.08 - 2099.88] lump on March 6th of 2017 a whole year
[2097.76 - 2102.68] year after the timeline of Ashley's fake
[2099.88 - 2105.04] story Ashley was not with Stephanie when
[2102.68 - 2108.08] Stephanie discovered her breast lump in
[2105.04 - 2110.32] 2017 as we discussed previously Ashley
[2108.08 - 2112.88] admitted that she did not see Stephanie
[2110.32 - 2114.60] once during the entire two years that
[2112.88 - 2117.56] passed between the time that Stephanie
[2114.60 - 2119.92] stayed in Ashley's home in 2016 and the
[2117.56 - 2122.40] time that Stephanie passed away in
[2119.92 - 2124.12] 2018 Ashley did not visit Stephanie
[2122.40 - 2126.48] during the time of her injury nor when
[2124.12 - 2128.40] Stephanie was in the hospital Ashley's
[2126.48 - 2130.52] even admitted that she barely kept in
[2128.40 - 2133.00] communication with Stephanie at all
[2130.52 - 2136.24] during the time of her injury on March
[2133.00 - 2139.56] 6th of 2020 she wrote
[2136.24 - 2141.84] this stephani I didn't talk often during
[2139.56 - 2144.72] her back
[2141.84 - 2147.36] injury the truth is that Ashley was not
[2144.72 - 2149.20] physically present for any single part
[2147.36 - 2152.00] of Stephanie's entire Journey with her
[2149.20 - 2155.16] breast lump her back injury her cancer
[2152.00 - 2157.20] or her passing so not only is Ashley
[2155.16 - 2159.08] devoid of facts but the single leg of
[2157.20 - 2160.88] credibility she tried to stand on by
[2159.08 - 2162.64] saying that she was physically present
[2160.88 - 2165.64] for a small portion of what Stephanie
[2162.64 - 2168.16] experienced with her breast lump is a
[2165.64 - 2169.92] lie after the release of our first four
[2168.16 - 2171.80] podcasts in which we presented a large
[2169.92 - 2174.20] amount of evidence that disproved
[2171.80 - 2176.20] Ashley's false storylines Ashley got a
[2174.20 - 2178.00] lot of push back for what she had done
[2176.20 - 2181.12] and the falsities she was continuing to
[2178.00 - 2183.80] try to spread in response to this push
[2181.12 - 2186.80] back Ashley continued to Pedal the I'm
[2183.80 - 2189.12] just sharing my truth narrative it's a
[2186.80 - 2192.80] tactic to try to evade being held to an
[2189.12 - 2194.48] objective standard of the truth rather
[2192.80 - 2196.88] than presenting legitimate facts or
[2194.48 - 2200.72] evidence Ashley constantly uses and
[2196.88 - 2204.20] relies upon someone told me I was there
[2200.72 - 2206.64] for it I experienced it personally or I
[2204.20 - 2209.52] heard a rumor statements which cannot be
[2206.64 - 2212.00] verified and of course can easily be
[2209.52 - 2215.04] fabricated and even if it were a valid
[2212.00 - 2218.28] pass that she's just sharing her truth
[2215.04 - 2220.20] Ashley can't even get her truth straight
[2218.28 - 2222.16] in all of Ashley's attempts to make
[2220.20 - 2224.64] Anthony and medical medium information
[2222.16 - 2226.88] look bad she's told numerous stories
[2224.64 - 2229.20] multiple times in completely different
[2226.88 - 2231.72] contradictory versions that cannot all
[2229.20 - 2234.16] be true at the same time here is an
[2231.72 - 2237.32] example of a storyline Ashley told four
[2234.16 - 2239.72] different versions of on February 11th
[2237.32 - 2241.76] of 2020 when Ashley first started
[2239.72 - 2243.44] posting false information about what had
[2241.76 - 2246.28] happened to Stephanie she got a
[2243.44 - 2249.32] commenter who said I find this very hard
[2246.28 - 2252.84] to believe and and Ashley
[2249.32 - 2255.20] replied that's okay I understand I
[2252.84 - 2257.48] worked really hard while writing this to
[2255.20 - 2260.92] make sure everything I wrote was
[2257.48 - 2263.64] absolutely true and not opinion the
[2260.92 - 2266.64] truth is she was a close friend of his
[2263.64 - 2269.56] for several years and had followed his
[2266.64 - 2273.48] protocol more exactly than anyone else
[2269.56 - 2276.64] I've ever met for that entire
[2273.48 - 2279.64] time in this version Ashley's saying
[2276.64 - 2281.16] that from her own perspective she
[2279.64 - 2283.92] observed that Stephanie followed
[2281.16 - 2286.28] Anthony's protocol more exactly than
[2283.92 - 2287.40] anyone else she's ever met for that
[2286.28 - 2290.00] entire
[2287.40 - 2291.84] time those who actually understand
[2290.00 - 2294.84] medical medium information know that
[2291.84 - 2296.60] there is no one medical medium protocol
[2294.84 - 2299.48] anyway so this is a problematic
[2296.60 - 2300.96] statement in and of itself but then in
[2299.48 - 2303.16] the second version of this same
[2300.96 - 2306.56] statement Ashley says something similar
[2303.16 - 2309.40] but adds to it on March 6th of 2020
[2306.56 - 2313.28] Ashley posted this
[2309.40 - 2317.00] and allow me to be clear I have never
[2313.28 - 2320.60] met to this day anyone who followed
[2317.00 - 2324.08] Anthony's advice more closely than Steph
[2320.60 - 2324.08] not even Anthony
[2324.64 - 2330.40] himself she told this version now with
[2327.72 - 2332.64] the addition of not even Anthony himself
[2330.40 - 2335.16] in at least two different places which
[2332.64 - 2337.56] is ridiculous because Ashley had no idea
[2335.16 - 2339.24] what Anthony was eating or not eating as
[2337.56 - 2342.00] they were not nearly as close as she
[2339.24 - 2344.32] constantly tries to portray it to be in
[2342.00 - 2347.48] the third version from May 5th of last
[2344.32 - 2351.40] year she says something
[2347.48 - 2354.72] different also I don't want to be rude
[2351.40 - 2356.84] but you're patently wrong some of us
[2354.72 - 2359.72] here have studied and applied his
[2356.84 - 2363.08] information more carefully than even
[2359.72 - 2365.60] Anthony himself that's something he told
[2363.08 - 2365.60] Steph
[2365.92 - 2371.24] once so now instead of Ashley making the
[2369.00 - 2373.28] statement about Stephanie like she did
[2371.24 - 2375.80] in the previous two versions she's
[2373.28 - 2378.16] changed the subject of the story to some
[2375.80 - 2379.72] of us here have applied the information
[2378.16 - 2382.88] better than Anthony
[2379.72 - 2384.92] himself Stephanie passed away in 2018
[2382.88 - 2386.16] and again Ashley posted this version
[2384.92 - 2389.24] last year
[2386.16 - 2391.12] 2023 does she mean by some of us here
[2389.24 - 2392.68] that her and her co- plotters have
[2391.12 - 2395.72] followed and applied medical medium
[2392.68 - 2398.36] information better than Anthony that's
[2395.72 - 2400.36] laughable and instead of this being an
[2398.36 - 2402.64] observation from her own perspective
[2400.36 - 2405.68] like it was in the previous two versions
[2402.64 - 2408.64] Ashley's changed it to this is something
[2405.68 - 2413.88] Anthony told Stephanie
[2408.64 - 2413.88] once in the fourth version Ashley says
[2413.96 - 2420.36] this remember when Anthony claimed Steph
[2417.24 - 2424.68] didn't follow his protocols well enough
[2420.36 - 2427.32] what a lie from the pit of Hell Anthony
[2424.68 - 2430.40] told me personally one time that step
[2427.32 - 2432.72] followed his protocols even better than
[2430.40 - 2432.72] he
[2432.76 - 2437.20] did first of all because Ashley
[2435.28 - 2440.16] literally gets everything wrong I have
[2437.20 - 2441.52] to clear this up Anthony has never said
[2440.16 - 2443.68] that Stephanie didn't follow his
[2441.52 - 2446.44] protocols well enough absolutely never
[2443.68 - 2449.16] said it in previous podcast episodes we
[2446.44 - 2450.68] simply debunked Ashley's falsity that
[2449.16 - 2453.24] Stephanie had followed medical medium
[2450.68 - 2454.68] information to a te we used multiple
[2453.24 - 2457.44] pieces of evidence to show that
[2454.68 - 2459.84] Stephanie factually did not follow it to
[2457.44 - 2462.52] a tea there was no implication made that
[2459.84 - 2464.88] Stephanie should have done anything
[2462.52 - 2466.92] better or differently in fact we played
[2464.88 - 2469.20] an audio message from Stephanie in which
[2466.92 - 2472.28] she had said that she knew that Anthony
[2469.20 - 2474.80] wasn't a fan of the Dr Morse grape fast
[2472.28 - 2477.52] that Stephanie said she was quote hooked
[2474.80 - 2479.76] on doing but that she was doing them
[2477.52 - 2482.36] anyway and that Anthony was not pushing
[2479.76 - 2484.00] her to do medical medium instead anyone
[2482.36 - 2487.68] can go back and listen to our previous
[2484.00 - 2489.72] episodes to verify that Stephanie took
[2487.68 - 2492.60] in lots of different modalities and
[2489.72 - 2495.00] health approaches at times I would say
[2492.60 - 2497.92] this is fine or that is fine because
[2495.00 - 2500.44] Stephany was on her own path doing her
[2497.92 - 2502.68] own raw food thing and as she said in
[2500.44 - 2505.04] the audio she was already hooked on
[2502.68 - 2507.36] certain things so I was supportive of
[2505.04 - 2510.40] Stephanie doing what she wanted to do I
[2507.36 - 2513.64] did not control Stephanie's decisions or
[2510.40 - 2516.60] even try to instead I supported her in
[2513.64 - 2519.56] any decision she made with things that
[2516.60 - 2522.40] spoke to her even if it wasn't medical
[2519.56 - 2525.28] medium they're trying to punish me for
[2522.40 - 2527.44] not controlling Stephanie's wishes and
[2525.28 - 2530.24] health choices and then they're also
[2527.44 - 2532.92] trying to punish me and blame me for
[2530.24 - 2535.80] supposedly controlling them this is very
[2532.92 - 2538.44] abusive behavior on their
[2535.80 - 2541.48] part Ashley said that Anthony's claim
[2538.44 - 2544.36] was a lie from the pit of Hell when
[2541.48 - 2546.64] Ashley fully made up the claim he never
[2544.36 - 2549.08] said it what we did share on the podcast
[2546.64 - 2551.64] was hard evidence from Stephanie herself
[2549.08 - 2554.56] far from a lie and Ashley saying all of
[2551.64 - 2557.20] this at the same time as she herself is
[2554.56 - 2559.92] telling an actual lie as part of a story
[2557.20 - 2563.08] she told four different contradictory
[2559.92 - 2564.96] versions of in this fourth version of
[2563.08 - 2566.96] the same story from Ashley about what
[2564.96 - 2568.64] Stephanie was eating and doing instead
[2566.96 - 2571.16] of the statement being an observation
[2568.64 - 2573.92] from Ashley's own perspective or
[2571.16 - 2576.64] something Anthony told Stephanie once
[2573.92 - 2580.44] like Ashley said previously now she's
[2576.64 - 2582.52] changed to Anthony told Ashley that
[2580.44 - 2586.04] Stephanie followed his protocols even
[2582.52 - 2588.04] better than he did so which is it all of
[2586.04 - 2589.84] these four story versions contradict
[2588.04 - 2592.88] themselves and they cannot all be true
[2589.84 - 2595.20] at the same time that is because Ashley
[2592.88 - 2596.40] is lying and she can't even keep her own
[2595.20 - 2599.84] madeup story
[2596.40 - 2602.44] straight Ashley did not know what I was
[2599.84 - 2605.08] eating I didn't speak to Ashley about
[2602.44 - 2607.80] how I ate I didn't tell Ashley that
[2605.08 - 2611.04] Stephanie ate better than me I never
[2607.80 - 2613.64] talked to Ashley about Stephanie at all
[2611.04 - 2615.44] so it's not even possible I never told
[2613.64 - 2617.72] Stephanie that Stephanie eats better
[2615.44 - 2619.92] than me Ashley's just fabricating
[2617.72 - 2622.96] stories
[2619.92 - 2624.64] again furthermore Ashley has admitted
[2622.96 - 2627.00] that she isn't really that versed in
[2624.64 - 2630.24] medical medium information in a live
[2627.00 - 2633.64] stream she did in 2020 she said
[2630.24 - 2636.00] this all right will I read his new book
[2633.64 - 2639.76] I honestly haven't read like the last
[2636.00 - 2643.28] three probably if I'm being really
[2639.76 - 2646.36] honest she honestly hasn't read like the
[2643.28 - 2647.80] last three books this was in 2020 in
[2646.36 - 2649.44] reference to when the cleans to heal
[2647.80 - 2651.92] book was coming out so it was before
[2649.44 - 2654.60] medical medium revised and expanded and
[2651.92 - 2656.80] it was also before the brains saer books
[2654.60 - 2659.72] that means Ashley basically only
[2656.80 - 2662.88] supposedly read the first two out of
[2659.72 - 2665.12] what's now nine books Ashley didn't read
[2662.88 - 2667.92] thyroid healing Liver Rescue celery
[2665.12 - 2671.44] juice cleanse to heal Medical revised
[2667.92 - 2673.84] brainsaver 1 or brainsaver 2 Ashley has
[2671.44 - 2676.20] hardly read any medical medium material
[2673.84 - 2679.04] and it shows which makes her far from an
[2676.20 - 2681.32] expert on medical medium information so
[2679.04 - 2683.00] how would Ashley know that Stephanie was
[2681.32 - 2685.32] following medical medium information to
[2683.00 - 2687.24] the letter or not if Ashley doesn't even
[2685.32 - 2689.80] know medical medium
[2687.24 - 2691.72] information what's even more insane is
[2689.80 - 2693.92] that there are more examples of Ashley
[2691.72 - 2696.72] telling multiple completely different
[2693.92 - 2699.04] contradictory versions of the same story
[2696.72 - 2701.76] The One one I'm going to unpack now is
[2699.04 - 2705.20] one that Ashley has told nine different
[2701.76 - 2707.80] versions of would you trust someone who
[2705.20 - 2711.56] has nine different versions of the same
[2707.80 - 2713.92] story about something this one is jam
[2711.56 - 2715.84] packed with falsities and fiction so
[2713.92 - 2717.76] bear with us as we unload this pile of
[2715.84 - 2720.28] crap onto the public this is the
[2717.76 - 2723.52] infamous cat
[2720.28 - 2726.28] story Ashley's son was sick with a skin
[2723.52 - 2728.48] condition in 2018 he was a baby at the
[2726.28 - 2731.96] time and Ashley sought Anthony's help
[2728.48 - 2733.64] with it in 2019 a year later Ashley
[2731.96 - 2736.32] started publicly telling fake stories
[2733.64 - 2738.20] about this experience she's changed and
[2736.32 - 2741.28] adapted the story more and more with
[2738.20 - 2743.16] time in 2020 right after Ashley came out
[2741.28 - 2745.04] with her false story about Stephanie
[2743.16 - 2747.76] Ashley did a live stream and said that
[2745.04 - 2749.56] Anthony had gotten it wrong with her son
[2747.76 - 2752.12] because Anthony missed the fact that it
[2749.56 - 2753.52] was really a cat allergy that was behind
[2752.12 - 2755.84] his eczema
[2753.52 - 2758.68] outbreak this is a story that Ashley
[2755.84 - 2760.12] told me on my recorded calls with her as
[2758.68 - 2763.12] she was trying to convince me that
[2760.12 - 2765.28] Anthony is a liar it's a story that I
[2763.12 - 2767.84] later found out has been used many many
[2765.28 - 2769.92] times by Ashley to intentionally try to
[2767.84 - 2772.08] break people's trust and confidence in
[2769.92 - 2774.28] Anthony and in medical medium
[2772.08 - 2776.20] information most people who have turned
[2774.28 - 2778.64] against Anthony have heard it it's a
[2776.20 - 2783.80] story that Ashley is still telling to
[2778.64 - 2786.68] this day it's the cat story the cat
[2783.80 - 2788.60] story so as the real cat story was
[2786.68 - 2791.92] actually actually happening in real time
[2788.60 - 2794.00] in 2018 there is a documented record of
[2791.92 - 2797.08] Ashley telling the story correctly and
[2794.00 - 2799.04] consistently to four different people
[2797.08 - 2801.24] when Ashley's son was actively dealing
[2799.04 - 2803.76] with his eczema outbreak Ashley texted
[2801.24 - 2804.96] with Anthony Anthony's wife and two
[2803.76 - 2807.88] different friends about what was
[2804.96 - 2809.96] happening I have all the texts and these
[2807.88 - 2811.60] four truthful versions serve as a record
[2809.96 - 2814.52] for contrasting with all of the
[2811.60 - 2818.48] fabricated versions that Ashley has told
[2814.52 - 2820.92] since now since 2019 Ashley has told
[2818.48 - 2823.04] five false versions of the cat story
[2820.92 - 2824.52] that we are aware of and who knows how
[2823.04 - 2827.28] many other versions she's told that we
[2824.52 - 2829.44] haven't seen not only are these five
[2827.28 - 2830.92] versions false contradictory and
[2829.44 - 2832.96] different from the four truthful
[2830.92 - 2836.20] versions of the cat story from when it
[2832.96 - 2838.48] was happening in 2018 but they're also
[2836.20 - 2841.20] each different from each other and they
[2838.48 - 2843.44] contradict one another I'm going to
[2841.20 - 2845.44] first play one rendition of Ashley's
[2843.44 - 2848.96] fake version of the cat story which was
[2845.44 - 2850.60] told during her April 1 2020 live stream
[2848.96 - 2852.96] we are redacting the name of Ashley's
[2850.60 - 2854.56] son for his privacy so every time you
[2852.96 - 2857.28] hear a bleep throughout the series it's
[2854.56 - 2859.80] someone saying Ashley's son's name or in
[2857.28 - 2861.44] one instance the name of another one of
[2859.80 - 2865.48] Ashley's
[2861.44 - 2867.36] children in regards to it's interesting
[2865.48 - 2870.36] I feel like it's another thing that just
[2867.36 - 2872.52] stood out to me as concerning um when
[2870.36 - 2875.64] got really bad eczema of course Anthony
[2872.52 - 2876.80] and I were really close and I had
[2875.64 - 2878.52] followed medical medium approach
[2876.80 - 2881.96] approach during pregnancy and so it was
[2878.52 - 2885.28] like holy cow what is going on of course
[2881.96 - 2889.04] I called Anthony about it and um we
[2885.28 - 2892.20] talked he changed my diet a lot uh well
[2889.04 - 2894.36] not a lot but he was very clear about
[2892.20 - 2896.08] like you need to cut out almost all fat
[2894.36 - 2897.92] except avocado from your diet I was
[2896.08 - 2902.08] doing like more of the cashews and the
[2897.92 - 2902.08] nuts and seeds and stuff
[2902.20 - 2908.48] um and so I did I I took that out of my
[2905.44 - 2911.68] diet and um
[2908.48 - 2914.16] um and slowly started to get a little
[2911.68 - 2916.88] bit better over the course of the next
[2914.16 - 2919.12] six months until he finally healed but
[2916.88 - 2923.36] the actual turning point in his healing
[2919.12 - 2925.44] came when we went to Hawaii and realized
[2923.36 - 2927.40] that he was severely allergic to cats
[2925.44 - 2929.64] because he was doing really well and
[2927.40 - 2933.40] then we changed airbnbs to an Airbnb
[2929.64 - 2935.32] where there was a cat and he started
[2933.40 - 2937.00] breaking out an eczema again like the
[2935.32 - 2938.56] following morning just like full whole
[2937.00 - 2942.92] body
[2938.56 - 2943.88] hives um and so we realized oh he has a
[2942.92 - 2946.52] cat
[2943.88 - 2948.84] allergy um and that was causing like the
[2946.52 - 2951.92] bulk of the problem and so I just find
[2948.84 - 2953.48] it curious that in talking to Anthony
[2951.92 - 2955.00] like why wouldn't he have mentioned like
[2953.48 - 2957.16] yes you can make all these dietary
[2955.00 - 2961.60] changes but also the fact that you got a
[2957.16 - 2964.16] cat four weeks ago is probably the real
[2961.60 - 2966.08] problem so Ashley was breastfeeding her
[2964.16 - 2967.88] baby during this time and what she was
[2966.08 - 2970.08] eating had the the ability to impact her
[2967.88 - 2971.96] son through her breast milk Ashley
[2970.08 - 2974.04] saying here that she was doing nuts and
[2971.96 - 2977.24] seeds and that Anthony had told her to
[2974.04 - 2979.20] cut out almost all fat except avocado
[2977.24 - 2980.96] she's saying that when she did that her
[2979.20 - 2982.92] son's eczema started to improve
[2980.96 - 2986.00] gradually until it healed
[2982.92 - 2988.16] completely but that she on her own
[2986.00 - 2989.88] realized that the actual turning point
[2988.16 - 2992.08] was when they were in an Airbnb in
[2989.88 - 2994.92] Hawaii with a cat in it and her baby
[2992.08 - 2996.76] broke out in eczema again Ashley is
[2994.92 - 2999.04] saying that she realized that he was
[2996.76 - 3002.84] reacting due to a cat allergy that
[2999.04 - 3004.92] Anthony had missed sounds convincing
[3002.84 - 3006.60] right if Ashley had reached out to you
[3004.92 - 3008.96] on Instagram like she's doing to many
[3006.60 - 3011.44] people tried to recruit you into her
[3008.96 - 3014.00] hateful group and told you the story
[3011.44 - 3016.04] what would you think why didn't Anthony
[3014.00 - 3018.16] catch that it was a cat allergy he's
[3016.04 - 3020.08] supposed to be able to do that he should
[3018.16 - 3023.44] have known that it was a cat allergy
[3020.08 - 3025.88] he's obviously not who he says he is
[3023.44 - 3028.76] well here's the real story of what
[3025.88 - 3030.40] actually happened from Anthony's text
[3028.76 - 3032.44] thread we know that Ashley's baby
[3030.40 - 3034.76] started having an eczema Outbreak on
[3032.44 - 3036.92] June 19th of
[3034.76 - 3038.92] 2018 and then there's a text thread
[3036.92 - 3040.88] between Ashley and a friend from when
[3038.92 - 3044.72] her son was dealing with his eczema in
[3040.88 - 3047.64] real time on June 28th of 2018 the
[3044.72 - 3052.16] friend texted Ashley and said hey honey
[3047.64 - 3055.84] how are you how's the rash Ashley
[3052.16 - 3058.96] replied hey BB doing good here gearing
[3055.84 - 3061.92] up to heads Dallas tomorrow it's still
[3058.96 - 3065.24] pretty bad but not getting worse I think
[3061.92 - 3069.56] it's actually starting to scab
[3065.24 - 3071.00] up the friend said a poor little Dallas
[3069.56 - 3073.72] will hopefully be
[3071.00 - 3076.24] nice Ashley sent a photo of her baby's
[3073.72 - 3079.20] eczema and said
[3076.24 - 3081.80] this I talked to Aunt and he said it's
[3079.20 - 3085.24] most likely the
[3081.80 - 3087.52] cat okay we have to pause here this is
[3085.24 - 3090.08] the Smoking Gun
[3087.52 - 3093.44] Ashley texted her friend saying that
[3090.08 - 3096.40] Anthony told her it's most likely the
[3093.44 - 3099.72] cat whereas in the 2020 version of the
[3096.40 - 3101.60] story Ashley said she herself discovered
[3099.72 - 3105.08] that the cat was causing her baby skin
[3101.60 - 3107.68] problems and that Anthony had missed it
[3105.08 - 3111.80] here it is again the 2020
[3107.68 - 3113.04] version um and so we realized oh he has
[3111.80 - 3115.64] a cat
[3113.04 - 3117.20] allergy um and that was causing like the
[3115.64 - 3119.44] bulk of the problem
[3117.20 - 3121.76] and so I just find it curious that in
[3119.44 - 3123.36] talking to Anthony like why wouldn't he
[3121.76 - 3125.80] have mentioned like yes you can make all
[3123.36 - 3128.16] these diary changes but also the fact
[3125.80 - 3130.92] that you got a cat four weeks ago is
[3128.16 - 3130.92] probably the real
[3131.56 - 3137.84] problem versus what actually happened
[3134.52 - 3140.08] according to Ashley's own text messages
[3137.84 - 3143.04] from
[3140.08 - 3146.84] 2018 I talked to Aunt and he said it's
[3143.04 - 3149.80] most likely the cat
[3146.84 - 3152.48] Ashley Foster is a
[3149.80 - 3156.56] liar there you have it right out of the
[3152.48 - 3158.12] horse's mouth Ashley's own words proving
[3156.56 - 3160.92] that she
[3158.12 - 3164.20] lied now we can
[3160.92 - 3167.88] continue I talked to an and he said it's
[3164.20 - 3170.24] most likely the cat cat has been gone 4
[3167.88 - 3172.84] days but I'm sure there's still a lot
[3170.24 - 3175.72] here so Dallas might actually help it
[3172.84 - 3178.76] heal up further well I mean liver issues
[3175.72 - 3178.76] but the cat is you
[3178.92 - 3184.52] know the friend said a the poor baby so
[3182.64 - 3188.16] did you give the cat away or just having
[3184.52 - 3190.60] a break from it and Ashley
[3188.16 - 3193.64] replied we gave it to our friends who
[3190.60 - 3196.20] wanted it really badly I really love
[3193.64 - 3199.72] having a pet around but they create so
[3196.20 - 3202.16] much mess and our home just feels so
[3199.72 - 3204.92] clean
[3202.16 - 3207.84] now Ashley's saying in these text
[3204.92 - 3210.24] messages that Anthony told her that her
[3207.84 - 3213.84] son's eczema outbreak was due to liver
[3210.24 - 3216.32] issues plus the cat Ashley also says
[3213.84 - 3219.80] that they gave the cat away on June 24th
[3216.32 - 3223.28] of 2018 this is 4 months before the
[3219.80 - 3225.76] Hawaii Retreat remember that in the fake
[3223.28 - 3228.84] story she told in 2020 Ashley said it
[3225.76 - 3230.88] wasn't until the Hawaii Retreat that she
[3228.84 - 3233.96] realized that cats affected her son's
[3230.88 - 3236.60] skin condition but in reality Ashley had
[3233.96 - 3240.28] already given their pet cat away four
[3236.60 - 3244.72] months be the Hawaii Retreat even took
[3240.28 - 3248.96] place again Ashley Foster is a
[3244.72 - 3251.12] liar then on July 14th of 2018 Ashley
[3248.96 - 3255.12] texted the same
[3251.12 - 3258.92] friend poor little is so bad it's
[3255.12 - 3262.44] breaking my heart anything I can do I'm
[3258.92 - 3266.12] drinking celery juice nettle tea off all
[3262.44 - 3269.64] green and oil and very low fat is
[3266.12 - 3274.28] getting little sips of celery juice too
[3269.64 - 3274.28] I'm taking zinc and vitamin C in high
[3275.04 - 3280.96] quantities the friend said poor baby is
[3278.52 - 3285.84] this worse than he was at the
[3280.96 - 3289.16] start h no it was worse at one
[3285.84 - 3291.32] point the friend asks it's been ebbing
[3289.16 - 3293.28] and flowing then or just gotten a little
[3291.32 - 3297.24] better and not gone up and
[3293.28 - 3298.92] down Ashley says that's sort of what
[3297.24 - 3301.92] it's
[3298.92 - 3304.36] done the friend replies well that's
[3301.92 - 3306.84] normal for a rash at least a bad one
[3304.36 - 3308.84] anyway it could still just be that his
[3306.84 - 3310.96] immune system is weakened still from the
[3308.84 - 3313.32] cat and the allergic reaction and it
[3310.96 - 3315.16] will get better soon if it's not worse
[3313.32 - 3319.52] right now that's a good sign are you
[3315.16 - 3322.92] drinking a lot of OJ and Ashley
[3319.52 - 3324.52] says no yeah it isn't continuing to get
[3322.92 - 3329.60] worse at
[3324.52 - 3332.80] least just slower to calm down than I
[3329.60 - 3335.04] thought Anthony had told Ashley already
[3332.80 - 3336.80] that the cat was a trigger for her son
[3335.04 - 3339.12] and Ashley had gotten rid of the cat
[3336.80 - 3341.56] nearly a month prior to this
[3339.12 - 3343.72] conversation as you can see everyone
[3341.56 - 3346.20] Ashley spoke to was well aware that the
[3343.72 - 3348.44] cat was a trigger because as Ashley said
[3346.20 - 3350.76] in her own text messages that was
[3348.44 - 3354.32] something Anthony had told her from the
[3350.76 - 3357.08] beginning on August 15th of 2018 the
[3354.32 - 3359.24] same friend asked how
[3357.08 - 3361.92] and Ashley
[3359.24 - 3364.64] replied he's not great pal but I'm
[3361.92 - 3366.72] trying to be patient we're having our
[3364.64 - 3369.60] whole house cleaned top to bottom this
[3366.72 - 3373.68] weekend including all furniture and our
[3369.60 - 3376.40] HVAC system it still hasn't been as bad
[3373.68 - 3376.40] as at its
[3376.52 - 3383.28] worst the friend says a poor little
[3380.52 - 3385.80] guy keep the date that Ashley got her
[3383.28 - 3386.96] house and HVAC system cleaned in mind
[3385.80 - 3388.04] for lat
[3386.96 - 3390.68] August
[3388.04 - 3394.48] 15th in a conversation that took place a
[3390.68 - 3396.40] month later on September 19th of 2018
[3394.48 - 3399.76] Ashley says
[3396.40 - 3401.68] this still dealing with skin but I spoke
[3399.76 - 3404.32] with Aunt and he got us on the right
[3401.68 - 3407.44] track I think we'll be through it in the
[3404.32 - 3410.36] next few weeks I was having very little
[3407.44 - 3413.20] fat like maybe one tablespoon of cashews
[3410.36 - 3416.28] a day but it turns out it's not the fat
[3413.20 - 3419.00] itself it's the nuts he actually said
[3416.28 - 3422.56] said like olive oil would be better than
[3419.00 - 3426.16] cashews in terms of helping heal so I
[3422.56 - 3429.48] got completely off any Not seeds he
[3426.16 - 3432.20] seems like he's starting to come through
[3429.48 - 3434.40] it so now we're getting into what was
[3432.20 - 3438.36] happening with the fats the friend
[3434.40 - 3440.80] responded I'm thrilled about yippe keep
[3438.36 - 3443.84] me posted on his continued healing been
[3440.80 - 3446.48] praying for him next we're going to read
[3443.84 - 3450.00] off a series of texts Ashley sent to a
[3446.48 - 3452.20] friend also in mid-september of 2018
[3450.00 - 3454.76] telling the true story consistent with
[3452.20 - 3456.88] the last text thread we just read off of
[3454.76 - 3459.24] what Ashley had discussed with Anthony
[3456.88 - 3462.88] about her son's
[3459.24 - 3467.36] skin nothing crazy but he set to give a
[3462.88 - 3469.60] little vitamin c 200 mgram per day and
[3467.36 - 3473.16] that I shouldn't be eating any nuts or
[3469.60 - 3475.52] seeds he actually said olive oil is fine
[3473.16 - 3477.20] but no nuts or seeds because of the
[3475.52 - 3479.96] ariny
[3477.20 - 3481.16] and then he said lots of squashes and
[3479.96 - 3483.08] green juices for
[3481.16 - 3486.52] [Music]
[3483.08 - 3489.76] me if you remember in the fabricated cat
[3486.52 - 3491.56] story Ashley told in 2020 Ashley said
[3489.76 - 3494.00] the real turning point was when she
[3491.56 - 3496.84] realized her son had a cat allergy while
[3494.00 - 3499.40] they were in Hawaii with a cat in their
[3496.84 - 3501.76] Airbnb in the real story of what
[3499.40 - 3503.76] actually happened the true turning point
[3501.76 - 3506.84] was when Ashley listened to Anthony's
[3503.76 - 3509.44] guidance to cut out nuts and seeds
[3506.84 - 3511.88] when she realized it was not the fat
[3509.44 - 3513.20] that was the problem it was the nuts and
[3511.88 - 3515.48] seeds
[3513.20 - 3518.16] specifically when Ashley cut those out
[3515.48 - 3520.32] as she said in her own words her son
[3518.16 - 3523.32] started to turn the corner and get
[3520.32 - 3526.40] better and then from October 15th
[3523.32 - 3529.08] through October 21st of 2018 Ashley
[3526.40 - 3530.76] hosted a retreat in Hawaii this is the
[3529.08 - 3533.44] retreat that took place right before
[3530.76 - 3535.52] Stephanie passed away I've spoken to
[3533.44 - 3537.16] individuals who were at this Retreat one
[3535.52 - 3539.52] of them shared with me first of all that
[3537.16 - 3542.20] there was not a cat in any of Ashley's
[3539.52 - 3544.04] airbnbs only an outdoor cat around one
[3542.20 - 3546.48] of the airbnbs that was not allowed
[3544.04 - 3548.08] inside this person also shared with us
[3546.48 - 3550.48] that at the retreat Ashley started
[3548.08 - 3552.88] eating nuts again and that is the real
[3550.48 - 3555.92] reason why her son's skin flared up
[3552.88 - 3558.48] again I have a copy of the menu Ashley
[3555.92 - 3560.84] created for the retreat and it has nuts
[3558.48 - 3563.28] in at least one of the meals for almost
[3560.84 - 3565.48] every single day of the
[3563.28 - 3567.84] retreat here are some examples from the
[3565.48 - 3569.68] menu we've got a chopped salad with
[3567.84 - 3572.64] Branch dressing which included Brazil
[3569.68 - 3575.32] and cashew nuts a taco bar with cashew
[3572.64 - 3577.52] cream which is basically all cashew
[3575.32 - 3581.20] there was a cashew curry sauce which is
[3577.52 - 3583.72] basically all cashew as well there was a
[3581.20 - 3585.88] pasta with cashew butter in the sauce
[3583.72 - 3587.52] There was a macadamia nut parmesan which
[3585.88 - 3589.96] is basically entirely made from
[3587.52 - 3591.80] macadamia nuts there were potato
[3589.96 - 3594.32] pancakes with a roasted garlic cream
[3591.80 - 3596.80] sauce which is basically all cashew
[3594.32 - 3598.60] again there was a pad tie with almond
[3596.80 - 3600.72] butter in it there were sweet potato
[3598.60 - 3603.28] fries with a cilantro lime Crea which is
[3600.72 - 3605.32] basically all cashew there was a
[3603.28 - 3608.20] horseradish sauce which included a lot
[3605.32 - 3611.60] of cashews there was also an option for
[3608.20 - 3613.92] almond butter sauce on Collard wraps
[3611.60 - 3616.16] this was a menu again that Ashley
[3613.92 - 3618.12] created herself and there are
[3616.16 - 3619.88] individuals who witnessed Ashley eating
[3618.12 - 3621.24] these dishes with nuts throughout the
[3619.88 - 3623.52] course of the
[3621.24 - 3625.76] retreat when Ashley returned from The
[3623.52 - 3628.24] Retreat she got off of nuts and seeds
[3625.76 - 3631.52] again and that is when her son's eczema
[3628.24 - 3634.32] cleared up for good again there are
[3631.52 - 3636.32] witnesses it is not possible that
[3634.32 - 3638.20] Ashley's son was still being affected by
[3636.32 - 3640.84] their household cat around the time of
[3638.20 - 3643.36] the October Retreat like Ashley said in
[3640.84 - 3645.52] her fabricated 20120 version of the cat
[3643.36 - 3648.00] story I'm going to walk through the
[3645.52 - 3649.64] facts of the timeline Ashley first
[3648.00 - 3651.52] texted Anthony's wife when she was
[3649.64 - 3656.56] thinking about getting the cat on June
[3651.52 - 3659.60] 7th of 2018 the text says this
[3656.56 - 3662.28] okay we're thinking of taking in our
[3659.60 - 3664.28] friends can possible to keep it on a
[3662.28 - 3666.68] vegan
[3664.28 - 3668.84] diet I have to put out a disclaimer
[3666.68 - 3670.60] first that Anthony has shared publicly
[3668.84 - 3672.76] that he does not recommend having cats
[3670.60 - 3675.00] on a vegan diet and Anthony's wife
[3672.76 - 3676.48] expressed this to Ashley at the time
[3675.00 - 3678.76] we're just reading this off to show that
[3676.48 - 3681.16] Ashley got the cat around this time in
[3678.76 - 3683.16] June and then the thread we read
[3681.16 - 3685.56] previously included Ashley confirming
[3683.16 - 3688.64] that she gave the cat away on June 24th
[3685.56 - 3690.84] of 201 2018 so between the time Ashley
[3688.64 - 3693.48] was considering taking the cat in on the
[3690.84 - 3696.36] 7th and the date she gave it away on the
[3693.48 - 3701.60] 24th Ashley only had the cat for a
[3696.36 - 3704.76] maximum of 18 days in June June 24th the
[3701.60 - 3707.84] day she gave the cat away is 4 months
[3704.76 - 3711.44] before Ashley was in Hawaii for her
[3707.84 - 3714.48] Retreat this alone makes Ashley's 2020
[3711.44 - 3717.12] fake version of the cat story entirely
[3714.48 - 3719.00] impossible
[3717.12 - 3723.24] but the actual turning point in his
[3719.00 - 3725.28] healing came when we went to Hawaii and
[3723.24 - 3727.84] realized that he was severely allergic
[3725.28 - 3730.08] to cats CU he was doing really well and
[3727.84 - 3733.84] then we changed airbnbs to an Airbnb
[3730.08 - 3735.76] where there was a cat and he started
[3733.84 - 3739.76] breaking out an eczema again like the
[3735.76 - 3739.76] following morning just like full body
[3740.00 - 3744.96] hives she claimed that she realized her
[3742.72 - 3746.72] son was allergic to cats because he was
[3744.96 - 3749.80] doing really well at first when they
[3746.72 - 3752.20] went to Hawaii in October of 2018 and
[3749.80 - 3754.96] that it was because he got relief from
[3752.20 - 3757.32] the cat that they had at home but in
[3754.96 - 3759.16] reality the cat had already been gone
[3757.32 - 3762.08] for 4
[3759.16 - 3765.00] months Ashley had sent this text on June
[3762.08 - 3769.28] 28th of
[3765.00 - 3771.52] 2018 CAD has been gone 4 days we gave it
[3769.28 - 3774.76] to our friends who wanted it really
[3771.52 - 3778.44] badly I really love having a pet around
[3774.76 - 3782.28] but they create so so much mess and our
[3778.44 - 3782.28] home just feels so clean
[3782.32 - 3789.32] now I will say again that Ashley Foster
[3786.24 - 3791.80] is a liar the cat story she told
[3789.32 - 3794.20] publicly in 2020 was
[3791.80 - 3797.28] fabricated and she went on to tell more
[3794.20 - 3799.44] fabricated versions of it keep the facts
[3797.28 - 3802.40] and records of what really happened with
[3799.44 - 3804.88] Ashley son his eczema and the cat in
[3802.40 - 3807.72] mind as I unpack several other
[3804.88 - 3810.12] fictitious cats story versions the facts
[3807.72 - 3812.64] are that Anthony did tell Ashley that
[3810.12 - 3815.12] the cat was a factor in her son's eczema
[3812.64 - 3817.80] he did not get it wrong or miss the cat
[3815.12 - 3821.56] allergy Ashley only had the cat for a
[3817.80 - 3824.20] maximum of 18 days and got rid of it 4
[3821.56 - 3826.44] months before the October Retreat
[3824.20 - 3829.40] Anthony only told Ashley to avoid nuts
[3826.44 - 3831.84] and seeds specifically her son's skin
[3829.40 - 3834.00] started improving when she implemented
[3831.84 - 3836.00] that and then his eczema flared up again
[3834.00 - 3838.88] in October because Ashley started eating
[3836.00 - 3840.72] nuts again at the retreat in Hawaii
[3838.88 - 3842.96] Ashley's son's eczema cleared up for
[3840.72 - 3845.72] good when Ashley got off of nuts and
[3842.96 - 3847.24] seeds again several months after she had
[3845.72 - 3849.24] already given the cat away and gotten
[3847.24 - 3851.40] her house deep
[3849.24 - 3853.96] cleaned when the plotters made their
[3851.40 - 3856.48] attempt to recruit me last year on a
[3853.96 - 3858.76] call that I legally recorded Ashley was
[3856.48 - 3862.08] trying really hard to convince me that
[3858.76 - 3864.08] Anthony is a liar and a fraud she told
[3862.08 - 3866.24] me a false version of the infamous cat
[3864.08 - 3868.00] story that was even more fabric ated
[3866.24 - 3870.84] than the false version that we just
[3868.00 - 3872.88] played from her 2020 live stream I'm
[3870.84 - 3874.64] going to go through and actually count
[3872.88 - 3876.24] the number of falsities from the cat
[3874.64 - 3879.20] story she told me personally on the
[3876.24 - 3883.36] phone because there are so
[3879.20 - 3886.68] many um I then gave birth to my middle
[3883.36 - 3889.68] son and he got like full body eczema
[3886.68 - 3892.08] when he was born and I remember asking
[3889.68 - 3894.68] Anthony what to do what do I do about
[3892.08 - 3899.00] this I was a breastfeeding mom he put me
[3894.68 - 3901.40] on a fat free raw diet um which I stayed
[3899.00 - 3901.40] on for
[3901.52 - 3906.84] months we've got falsity number one in
[3905.00 - 3910.00] this version she says Anthony put her on
[3906.84 - 3912.32] a fat-free diet in previous version she
[3910.00 - 3915.84] had said Anthony told her avocado and
[3912.32 - 3918.64] olive oil were okay in reality he said
[3915.84 - 3922.04] nuts and seeds specifically were the
[3918.64 - 3924.60] problem not fats as a whole falsity
[3922.04 - 3927.40] number two Ashley added here that he
[3924.60 - 3929.92] told her to eat raw food only this is
[3927.40 - 3931.76] the only one of nine versions of the cat
[3929.92 - 3934.16] story in which she mentioned this and it
[3931.76 - 3936.44] is not true in one of the text threads
[3934.16 - 3938.24] we just read from Ashley told a friend
[3936.44 - 3940.52] while the outbreak was happening in real
[3938.24 - 3942.68] time that Anthony had suggested for her
[3940.52 - 3946.16] to eat lots of squashes and said that
[3942.68 - 3948.60] olive oil was okay I'm positive Anthony
[3946.16 - 3951.32] that you did not mean for Ashley to only
[3948.60 - 3953.84] consume all of those squashes raw and to
[3951.32 - 3957.24] only have olive oil
[3953.84 - 3959.96] raw I did not tell Ashley to eat raw or
[3957.24 - 3961.96] to eat fat-free for her son's eczema
[3959.96 - 3965.36] Ashley's lying
[3961.96 - 3967.00] again right and we've also got falsity
[3965.36 - 3969.00] number three here with Ashley saying
[3967.00 - 3971.64] that she stayed raw and fat-free for
[3969.00 - 3973.36] months someone I've spoken to who knows
[3971.64 - 3975.84] Ashley witnessed her consuming both
[3973.36 - 3978.04] cooked food and fats during this time
[3975.84 - 3979.96] Ashley only cut out nuts and seeds for
[3978.04 - 3981.68] about one month and then at her Retreat
[3979.96 - 3984.40] she was eating nuts again as well as
[3981.68 - 3986.24] other fats and cooked food even during
[3984.40 - 3988.68] the one month that she cut out nuts and
[3986.24 - 3989.76] seeds Ashley was still eating other fats
[3988.68 - 3992.84] and cooked
[3989.76 - 3994.96] food there is a publicly available
[3992.84 - 3997.36] YouTube video that was submitted to us
[3994.96 - 4001.16] of a vegan G together that took place on
[3997.36 - 4004.16] August 14th of 2018 and the video stars
[4001.16 - 4006.80] Ashley this is just under two months
[4004.16 - 4008.96] after Ashley's Sun broke out with eczema
[4006.80 - 4012.12] Ashley is shown in the video with a
[4008.96 - 4014.64] salad with avocado and cooked potato
[4012.12 - 4017.28] cakes with dollops of cashew aoli cream
[4014.64 - 4020.56] and avocado on top sitting next to her
[4017.28 - 4022.96] son and you can see his active eczema a
[4020.56 - 4025.08] witness who was at the Gathering saw
[4022.96 - 4027.68] Ashley eating the salad with avocado and
[4025.08 - 4031.20] the cooked potato cakes with cashew oi
[4027.68 - 4033.12] cream and avocado on top cashew oi cream
[4031.20 - 4035.28] is very dense and takes a lot of cashews
[4033.12 - 4037.24] to make this is yet another piece of
[4035.28 - 4039.72] evidence to show that Ashley's claim of
[4037.24 - 4041.80] being on a raw fat-free diet is
[4039.72 - 4044.64] completely
[4041.80 - 4047.44] false during my call with Ashley she
[4044.64 - 4051.12] continued on
[4047.44 - 4054.28] um and he told me all this different
[4051.12 - 4057.20] stuff we have like a billion air
[4054.28 - 4059.80] purifiers this is falsity number four
[4057.20 - 4062.68] Ashley didn't have air purifiers until
[4059.80 - 4064.56] after her son's eczema had cleared up
[4062.68 - 4067.20] the air purifiers she got were for
[4064.56 - 4069.04] remediation from the Malibu fires they
[4067.20 - 4071.40] had nothing to do with the cat or her
[4069.04 - 4073.96] son's skin and it was during a different
[4071.40 - 4076.08] time period it's a whole other separate
[4073.96 - 4078.20] story which we're going to cover later
[4076.08 - 4079.84] that as conflated with this false
[4078.20 - 4082.00] version of the cat story when she told
[4079.84 - 4086.00] it to
[4082.00 - 4088.20] me we I was not eating I mean I wasn't
[4086.00 - 4089.80] eating anything I was eating fruit and
[4088.20 - 4093.48] some
[4089.80 - 4095.80] grains falsity number five now Ashley's
[4093.48 - 4099.60] down to saying she wasn't even eating
[4095.80 - 4101.48] vegetables just fruit and greens that's
[4099.60 - 4104.32] how the number two plotter Ashley's
[4101.48 - 4106.56] friend Robbie Barbaro eats somehow it's
[4104.32 - 4109.56] not restrictive to her when he does
[4106.56 - 4111.32] it but there are witnesses who observed
[4109.56 - 4113.68] Ashley eating many foods other than
[4111.32 - 4116.36] fruit and greens during this time such
[4113.68 - 4118.16] as plenty of potatoes and beans in
[4116.36 - 4120.20] another version of this story Ashley
[4118.16 - 4122.84] said she was eating nuts and seeds up
[4120.20 - 4125.84] until a month before the retreat and as
[4122.84 - 4128.60] we covered she reintroduced nuts at The
[4125.84 - 4130.68] Retreat and at Ashley's Retreat there
[4128.60 - 4133.12] were plenty of vegetables on the menu
[4130.68 - 4137.00] that she created herself lots of
[4133.12 - 4139.80] potatoes radishes yams asparagus carrot
[4137.00 - 4142.12] red cabbage and more along with other
[4139.80 - 4145.80] foods like coconut ice cream kelp
[4142.12 - 4148.28] noodles raw honey maple syrup Wasabi
[4145.80 - 4149.80] aerrow root and much more than just
[4148.28 - 4152.12] fruit and
[4149.80 - 4153.64] greens furthermore in a different
[4152.12 - 4155.96] version of the cat story I'm going to
[4153.64 - 4158.24] share from Ashley later Ashley says in
[4155.96 - 4160.04] her own words that she was eating
[4158.24 - 4163.40] vegetables during this
[4160.04 - 4165.40] time obviously Ashley's purposely trying
[4163.40 - 4167.96] to make it look like Anthony put her on
[4165.40 - 4170.16] some kind of extremely restrictive diet
[4167.96 - 4172.00] which he did not by telling these
[4170.16 - 4174.88] falsities because she has to convince
[4172.00 - 4176.68] people somehow that Anthony's a bad guy
[4174.88 - 4179.72] or
[4176.68 - 4181.80] something and he kept saying like just
[4179.72 - 4184.16] keep going he's cleansing his liver
[4181.80 - 4186.60] cleansing my hair was falling out my
[4184.16 - 4186.60] nails were
[4187.12 - 4192.48] breaking oh the drama there's so much
[4190.92 - 4194.96] that's wrong with this part of her fake
[4192.48 - 4197.68] story from the false he's just cleansing
[4194.96 - 4199.44] narrative to her false Health claims
[4197.68 - 4201.88] that we're going to be unpacking further
[4199.44 - 4204.40] in another episode for now I'm just
[4201.88 - 4207.32] going to stick to the main falsities
[4204.40 - 4209.48] falsity number six here Ashley's
[4207.32 - 4211.72] omitting the fact that her son's skin
[4209.48 - 4214.24] did clear up after she made the dietary
[4211.72 - 4216.00] changes Anthony suggested she's doing
[4214.24 - 4219.00] this to make it sound like what Anthony
[4216.00 - 4222.36] suggested wasn't working while it was so
[4219.00 - 4224.32] restrictive that it was harming her in
[4222.36 - 4226.48] reality Ashley took some time to
[4224.32 - 4229.32] implement what Anthony had had suggested
[4226.48 - 4232.36] which was to Simply remove nuts and
[4229.32 - 4234.36] seeds and as you guys heard in her own
[4232.36 - 4236.68] text messages from the true version of
[4234.36 - 4239.52] the cat story Ashley said that once she
[4236.68 - 4243.08] did that her son's skin started clearing
[4239.52 - 4245.20] up and falsity number seven Ashley was
[4243.08 - 4246.88] dealing with pre-existing symptoms and
[4245.20 - 4248.68] conditions before she ever started
[4246.88 - 4251.76] applying medical medium information
[4248.68 - 4253.96] including hair loss and there is plenty
[4251.76 - 4255.76] of evidence of that that Ashley maybe
[4253.96 - 4257.96] doesn't remember
[4255.76 - 4259.52] I mean it's got to be a full-time job at
[4257.96 - 4261.72] this point for her to keep her lies
[4259.52 - 4264.56] straight when she's being so obscenely
[4261.72 - 4266.68] dishonest all over the place these
[4264.56 - 4268.72] pre-existing symptoms like hair loss
[4266.68 - 4270.72] however presented long before Ashley was
[4268.72 - 4274.08] recommended by Anthony to remove nuts
[4270.72 - 4278.72] and seeds for the one month or so that
[4274.08 - 4279.64] she actually did in total so restrictive
[4278.72 - 4282.36] I
[4279.64 - 4284.20] know in fact in one of the ebooks that
[4282.36 - 4287.04] Ashley had sold to the medical medium
[4284.20 - 4289.00] Community years ago Ashley wrote this
[4287.04 - 4290.88] about what was going on with her health
[4289.00 - 4293.28] during the time that she gave birth to
[4290.88 - 4296.40] her other child that she had before her
[4293.28 - 4296.40] son who had the eczema
[4296.68 - 4303.72] outbreak after was born my health
[4300.32 - 4308.44] crashed even more severely my depression
[4303.72 - 4311.56] became so intense magnified 100 times
[4308.44 - 4315.44] getting out of bed felt impossible and
[4311.56 - 4319.12] at times it was my hair fell out my my
[4315.44 - 4322.80] skin grew dull and pale I felt horrible
[4319.12 - 4325.72] in my own body and for a brief period I
[4322.80 - 4328.96] even battle thoughts of suicide I
[4325.72 - 4331.80] weighed 185 lbs and my entire body
[4328.96 - 4336.04] seemed to Sag in the aftermath of
[4331.80 - 4338.40] creating new life at 6 months postpartum
[4336.04 - 4341.72] I found help from Anthony William who
[4338.40 - 4341.72] wrote the book medical
[4342.16 - 4347.76] Medium as you can see from Ashley's own
[4345.56 - 4349.28] testimony of her healing Journey from
[4347.76 - 4350.72] before she got mad at Anthony and
[4349.28 - 4353.44] started telling these fake stories and
[4350.72 - 4355.60] trying to rewrite history Ashley's hair
[4353.44 - 4359.20] loss was happening after she had her
[4355.60 - 4361.28] first baby which was 6 months before she
[4359.20 - 4363.08] ever interacted with Anthony or his
[4361.28 - 4366.24] information in the first
[4363.08 - 4368.72] place Ashley's using this falsity as a
[4366.24 - 4370.68] tactic to mess with other women's heads
[4368.72 - 4372.96] it's a great way to scare women who are
[4370.68 - 4375.84] applying medical medium information
[4372.96 - 4377.16] women do not want to lose their hair or
[4375.84 - 4380.76] the health of their
[4377.16 - 4383.52] nails yeah and that's real
[4380.76 - 4386.20] fear-mongering somebody who has to twist
[4383.52 - 4388.16] stories like this in order to try to
[4386.20 - 4390.32] scare and mess with the heads of women
[4388.16 - 4393.00] who are already struggling to serve
[4390.32 - 4395.36] their own agenda is clearly someone who
[4393.00 - 4396.80] is operating from a place of malice and
[4395.36 - 4399.56] not from a place of
[4396.80 - 4401.92] Sanity during our call Ashley continued
[4399.56 - 4405.64] to tell me this fake cat
[4401.92 - 4407.64] story um we went to Hawaii actually with
[4405.64 - 4409.72] Taylor to do a retreat with
[4407.64 - 4411.64] Taylor while we were there we were
[4409.72 - 4413.16] staying at an Airbnb with a cat and
[4411.64 - 4415.64] halfway through the retreat we moved to
[4413.16 - 4419.16] an Airbnb without a cat we also had a
[4415.64 - 4421.36] cat um when we moved to the Airbnb
[4419.16 - 4423.52] without a cat my son's eczema went away
[4421.36 - 4427.32] within like the three days that we were
[4423.52 - 4429.68] there falsity number eight what's funny
[4427.32 - 4431.20] is that this is the opposite from other
[4429.68 - 4434.44] versions of the false story that
[4431.20 - 4436.04] Ashley's told in another false version
[4434.44 - 4438.60] Ashley said that the cat was in the
[4436.04 - 4440.52] second Airbnb and now she's saying that
[4438.60 - 4443.64] the cat was in the first
[4440.52 - 4445.72] Airbnb as we stated previously a witness
[4443.64 - 4447.84] who was at the retreat said that there
[4445.72 - 4449.20] was actually not a cat in either of
[4447.84 - 4452.24] Ashley's
[4449.20 - 4454.04] airbnbs falsity number nine in this
[4452.24 - 4456.28] version Ashley's claiming that her son's
[4454.04 - 4459.56] eczema went away within 3 days while
[4456.28 - 4462.72] they were in Hawaii in the real story
[4459.56 - 4464.56] from Ashley's own text messages remember
[4462.72 - 4467.76] that her son's eczema actually started
[4464.56 - 4470.64] clearing up one month before the Hawaii
[4467.76 - 4472.16] retreat in October Ashley's son's eczema
[4470.64 - 4474.28] flared up again while they were in
[4472.16 - 4475.64] Hawaii because Ashley started eating
[4474.28 - 4478.52] nuts
[4475.64 - 4481.64] again so we got home we gave the cat to
[4478.52 - 4483.48] a friend we had our um air conditioning
[4481.64 - 4485.48] and it cleaned his eczema went away and
[4483.48 - 4489.16] it never came
[4485.48 - 4490.96] back falsity number 10 if you remember
[4489.16 - 4492.96] back to one of the text threads we read
[4490.96 - 4496.16] from Ashley's real version of the cat
[4492.96 - 4498.72] story sent to a friend on August 15th of
[4496.16 - 4501.12] 2018 Ashley said
[4498.72 - 4503.20] this we're having our whole house
[4501.12 - 4507.96] cleaned top to bottom this weekend
[4503.20 - 4507.96] including all furniture and our HVAC
[4508.16 - 4513.60] system in fact Ashley had her air
[4511.60 - 4517.56] conditioning unit cleaned the weekend of
[4513.60 - 4520.88] August 17th which was 2 months before
[4517.56 - 4523.64] the Hawaii Retreat not after the Hawaii
[4520.88 - 4526.56] Retreat and that concludes this version
[4523.64 - 4529.16] of the cat story leaving us with 10
[4526.56 - 4531.40] total falsities in just one of the
[4529.16 - 4534.88] multiple fictitious versions that Ashley
[4531.40 - 4537.32] has told of this cat story Ashley has
[4534.88 - 4540.08] adapted the infamous cat story more and
[4537.32 - 4542.32] more with time right after we released
[4540.08 - 4544.16] the first podcast about the plotters a
[4542.32 - 4546.00] lot of people were shocked to figure out
[4544.16 - 4548.04] that Ashley was behind this attack on
[4546.00 - 4550.08] Anthony and the community because they
[4548.04 - 4552.24] remembered how much Ashley has said in
[4550.08 - 4555.28] previous years about how Anthony has
[4552.24 - 4557.04] helped her and her family one woman
[4555.28 - 4558.60] recounted what she had seen in a
[4557.04 - 4560.28] Facebook group that she was in with
[4558.60 - 4563.12] Ashley during the time of her son's
[4560.28 - 4567.56] eczema problem in a comment thread from
[4563.12 - 4569.76] April 20th of 2023 the woman said aw
[4567.56 - 4572.08] helped Ash's baby recover from pretty
[4569.76 - 4574.60] severe eczema I don't know if Ash had
[4572.08 - 4576.64] issues herself or just her baby I
[4574.60 - 4579.16] remember seeing before and after
[4576.64 - 4582.08] picks Ashley replied with another
[4579.16 - 4585.36] version of her fake cat
[4582.08 - 4589.00] story respectfully can't let let these
[4585.36 - 4592.40] inaccuracies go un addressed Anthony did
[4589.00 - 4595.28] not cure my son's eczema he told me to
[4592.40 - 4598.24] go on a fat-free diet as a breastfeeding
[4595.28 - 4601.84] postpartum mom he recommended it for
[4598.24 - 4604.28] months and months and months he
[4601.84 - 4607.76] specifically told me that I just needed
[4604.28 - 4610.96] to keep going to detox to help my son we
[4607.76 - 4613.88] went on a trip and realized that my son
[4610.96 - 4617.16] was allergic to cats we came back and
[4613.88 - 4619.96] gave our cat to dear friend my son's
[4617.16 - 4623.24] eczema went away within the week and has
[4619.96 - 4625.72] never come back I however have suffered
[4623.24 - 4629.40] incredible depletion from being on such
[4625.72 - 4631.52] a restrictive diet for so long I went on
[4629.40 - 4634.80] to have two miscarriages while
[4631.52 - 4638.48] continuing to follow Anthony's
[4634.80 - 4641.72] advice wow this false version is even
[4638.48 - 4643.68] more extreme than the last Ashley has a
[4641.72 - 4645.56] pattern of escalating the severity of
[4643.68 - 4647.40] her fake stories over time time
[4645.56 - 4650.08] presumably after not getting enough of a
[4647.40 - 4651.80] rise out of people initially here
[4650.08 - 4654.32] Ashley's telling the same falsities
[4651.80 - 4656.20] about Anthony missing the cat allergy
[4654.32 - 4659.32] and that Anthony had told her to go on a
[4656.20 - 4661.68] fat-free diet this time she says for
[4659.32 - 4664.24] months and months and
[4661.68 - 4666.64] months Ashley also told the same
[4664.24 - 4669.64] falsities about how Anthony told her to
[4666.64 - 4671.72] just keep going to detox her son that
[4669.64 - 4673.84] she herself discovered the cat allergy
[4671.72 - 4675.80] at The Retreat that they gave the cat
[4673.84 - 4677.80] away after the retreat Retreat and that
[4675.80 - 4680.16] her son's eczema cleared after the
[4677.80 - 4682.92] retreat none of which is
[4680.16 - 4685.12] accurate now she's added in outrageous
[4682.92 - 4687.08] Health claims to imply that not only
[4685.12 - 4689.20] Anthony got the cause of her son's skin
[4687.08 - 4691.24] problem wrong but also that his
[4689.20 - 4695.00] recommendations were restrictive and
[4691.24 - 4697.56] caused her harm she says that she quote
[4695.00 - 4700.88] suffered incredible depletion from being
[4697.56 - 4703.12] on such a restrictive diet for so long
[4700.88 - 4705.28] all of this is
[4703.12 - 4706.96] inaccurate again we're going going to be
[4705.28 - 4708.88] thoroughly addressing Ashley's
[4706.96 - 4711.60] outrageous Health claims in other
[4708.88 - 4714.04] episodes for now I'm going to share the
[4711.60 - 4715.48] text message that Ashley sent to Anthony
[4714.04 - 4716.92] when she reached out to him for help
[4715.48 - 4720.48] with her baby's
[4716.92 - 4723.64] eczema sweet is pretty miserable still
[4720.48 - 4727.28] an I'm doing the basic things I can do
[4723.64 - 4731.40] while breastfeeding celery juice low fat
[4727.28 - 4734.44] green free zinc vitamin C he's getting a
[4731.40 - 4738.56] little celery juice too any other
[4734.44 - 4741.00] thoughts for me poor little bugs seem so
[4738.56 - 4743.20] miserable I'm willing to do something
[4741.00 - 4746.64] extreme like a melon juice and green
[4743.20 - 4749.04] juice fast or something but I don't want
[4746.64 - 4752.48] to detox and make him
[4749.04 - 4754.76] worse Ashley has made it clear over and
[4752.48 - 4757.60] over again that she's never understood
[4754.76 - 4760.24] medical medium information Anthony very
[4757.60 - 4763.32] much advises against things like melon
[4760.24 - 4765.16] juice and green juice fasts Ashley said
[4763.32 - 4768.32] herself here that she would was willing
[4765.16 - 4771.92] to do something extreme to help her baby
[4768.32 - 4774.28] that was Ashley's input Ashley herself
[4771.92 - 4776.40] has a history of extreme dieting that
[4774.28 - 4779.40] existed long before she ever discovered
[4776.40 - 4781.44] medical medium information in a post
[4779.40 - 4783.64] Ashley made years ago to promote one of
[4781.44 - 4785.76] her ebooks Ashley shared a photo of
[4783.64 - 4788.28] herself in a wedding dress appearing
[4785.76 - 4791.24] very thin and she said
[4788.28 - 4793.92] this I was thin before my first
[4791.24 - 4797.44] pregnancy but it wasn't a healthy calm
[4793.92 - 4800.44] thin I used juice and water fasting to
[4797.44 - 4803.60] control my weight and it swung wildly
[4800.44 - 4806.24] all over the place even at times when I
[4803.60 - 4808.80] was thin I experienced a lot of mental
[4806.24 - 4812.28] chaos around
[4808.80 - 4815.12] food Ashley's first pregnancy as I went
[4812.28 - 4817.92] through previously was before she ever
[4815.12 - 4820.60] connected with Anthony or medical medium
[4817.92 - 4823.56] information for her son's eczema Anthony
[4820.60 - 4825.72] said no to Ashley's suggestion of melon
[4823.56 - 4828.12] juice and green juice fasting and
[4825.72 - 4830.96] literally recommended for her to Simply
[4828.12 - 4834.32] remove nuts and seeds from her diet to
[4830.96 - 4836.36] help him millions of people with nut and
[4834.32 - 4839.12] Seed allergies live without them every
[4836.36 - 4841.56] day it's far from restrictive and nobody
[4839.12 - 4843.60] made her do it she was pleading for help
[4841.56 - 4846.56] from Anthony and again according to
[4843.60 - 4848.48] Ashley's own text messages from the true
[4846.56 - 4850.36] version of this story what Anthony
[4848.48 - 4853.20] suggested started clearing up her son's
[4850.36 - 4855.84] skin right away in the same comment
[4853.20 - 4859.44] thread from last year Ashley
[4855.84 - 4862.60] added for clarity's sake you need to
[4859.44 - 4865.00] know that during that entire time we had
[4862.60 - 4867.36] the cat in our house while Anthony was
[4865.00 - 4870.20] calling me and doing check-ins with
[4867.36 - 4872.56] spirit and telling me that the eczema
[4870.20 - 4876.44] was just cleansing and I needed to keep
[4872.56 - 4878.76] on my restrictive diet weird that Spirit
[4876.44 - 4881.48] never mentioned the cat to him 6 months
[4878.76 - 4881.48] earlier
[4881.84 - 4889.52] right I mean is this a joke this is how
[4885.40 - 4892.08] dangerous Ashley is every single line of
[4889.52 - 4894.28] that comment is wrong this is a perfect
[4892.08 - 4897.00] example of blatant falsities Ashley is
[4894.28 - 4899.08] pedaling to damage Anthony to plant fear
[4897.00 - 4900.80] and doubt to deliberately try to
[4899.08 - 4902.64] convince people that Anthony doesn't
[4900.80 - 4905.00] have accurate information and that he's
[4902.64 - 4907.72] harming people and she's trying to break
[4905.00 - 4910.20] people's Faith she's a faith
[4907.72 - 4912.36] Buster here she's saying the cat was in
[4910.20 - 4915.16] her house the entire time Anthony was
[4912.36 - 4917.84] talking to her but Ashley got rid of the
[4915.16 - 4921.08] cat on June 24th of
[4917.84 - 4923.00] 2018 this was 4 months before she's now
[4921.08 - 4926.08] claiming that she gave the cat
[4923.00 - 4927.88] away she said weird that Spirit never
[4926.08 - 4931.96] mentioned the cat to him six months
[4927.88 - 4934.04] earlier right this is false ridiculously
[4931.96 - 4937.32] false Anthony mentioned the cat as a
[4934.04 - 4939.44] trigger from day one but this is exactly
[4937.32 - 4941.88] how Ashley deceives and manipulates
[4939.44 - 4943.76] people she's trying to rewrite history
[4941.88 - 4945.48] here to create an entirely false
[4943.76 - 4948.12] narrative
[4945.48 - 4950.84] I don't care if people believe in my
[4948.12 - 4953.64] gift or not that's okay that comes with
[4950.84 - 4955.56] a territory since I was 4 years old but
[4953.64 - 4958.52] people should be able to make that
[4955.56 - 4961.96] choice for themselves without a falsity
[4958.52 - 4965.24] persuading them I did know about the cat
[4961.96 - 4967.92] and I told Ashley plain and
[4965.24 - 4969.52] simple as the comment thread goes on the
[4967.92 - 4971.56] woman who remembered that Anthony had
[4969.52 - 4973.48] helped Ashley's baby with eczema
[4971.56 - 4974.96] continued to question Ashley's false
[4973.48 - 4977.04] story
[4974.96 - 4980.32] she said did you have two babies with
[4977.04 - 4983.72] skin issues I pulled up my notes I have
[4980.32 - 4986.04] 414 pages of notes from our group found
[4983.72 - 4989.16] a convo between you and Mana about you
[4986.04 - 4991.96] getting a kitten and had a whole body
[4989.16 - 4995.12] rash a week after you got the kitten
[4991.96 - 4997.56] Mana suggested zinc and C for you not
[4995.12 - 4999.92] him you asked about the cat and she said
[4997.56 - 5002.12] yes totally about the
[4999.92 - 5004.52] cat the group that this woman is
[5002.12 - 5006.24] referring to was a Facebook group she
[5004.52 - 5008.72] saying that another woman had suggested
[5006.24 - 5012.04] for Ashley to do vitamin C and Zinc for
[5008.72 - 5013.88] her son's eczema Ashley implemented that
[5012.04 - 5015.84] and then Ashley texted a friend about
[5013.88 - 5019.76] her taking these supplements on July
[5015.84 - 5021.16] 14th of 2018 months before the Hawaii
[5019.76 - 5023.84] retreat in
[5021.16 - 5026.04] October Anthony and people in the
[5023.84 - 5028.16] medical medium Community all knew that
[5026.04 - 5030.16] the pet cat was part of the problem way
[5028.16 - 5032.88] before Ashley and her son stayed in the
[5030.16 - 5035.76] Airbnb that Ashley is trying to claim
[5032.88 - 5037.64] had a cat in it a woman who wasn't even
[5035.76 - 5040.28] involved had
[5037.64 - 5042.60] 414 pages of notes from the time that
[5040.28 - 5044.76] this was happening and she knew that
[5042.60 - 5046.80] Ashley's fake cat story on this thread
[5044.76 - 5048.52] wasn't adding up and was contradictory
[5046.80 - 5051.44] to the notes she had
[5048.52 - 5053.56] taken in the same comment thread Ashley
[5051.44 - 5056.64] tried to convince yet another person of
[5053.56 - 5057.80] her false cat story to this person she
[5056.64 - 5061.64] said
[5057.80 - 5064.40] this here's my experience my son had
[5061.64 - 5067.28] whole body eczema from a few weeks after
[5064.40 - 5069.80] after getting a kitten until a week
[5067.28 - 5072.88] after giving it
[5069.80 - 5075.40] away I'm going to pause to note that
[5072.88 - 5078.24] Ashley's saying here that her son got
[5075.40 - 5081.60] the rash a few weeks after they got the
[5078.24 - 5084.36] kitten in another comment on the very
[5081.60 - 5086.96] same thread Ashley said to a different
[5084.36 - 5089.72] person that he had gotten the rash one
[5086.96 - 5091.40] week after they got the kitten the
[5089.72 - 5095.36] comment one
[5091.40 - 5098.24] version my son had whole body EA from a
[5095.36 - 5102.20] few weeks after getting a
[5098.24 - 5105.24] kitten versus the comment 2
[5102.20 - 5107.68] version we had a cat for a week when he
[5105.24 - 5107.68] got the
[5108.08 - 5113.56] rash which is it Ashley a few weeks or
[5111.44 - 5116.76] one week after getting the cat it can't
[5113.56 - 5118.36] be both this is getting embarrassing for
[5116.76 - 5120.84] the woman who said that she would never
[5118.36 - 5123.96] tell a lie and calls herself a truth
[5120.84 - 5125.56] teller Ashley continued on with her fake
[5123.96 - 5128.60] cat
[5125.56 - 5131.20] Story the way we realized what was
[5128.60 - 5135.20] causing it is that we stayed in an
[5131.20 - 5138.72] Airbnb without a cat and he began to
[5135.20 - 5141.88] improve then we moved to an Airbnb with
[5138.72 - 5144.56] a cat and he declined the difference was
[5141.88 - 5148.04] rapid enough that we noticed got rid of
[5144.56 - 5150.44] the cat his severe whole body eczema
[5148.04 - 5154.64] that he had for six months of his life
[5150.44 - 5157.44] went away and never came back so that's
[5154.64 - 5161.04] my experience I feel like a broken
[5157.44 - 5161.04] record but that's all I have to
[5161.32 - 5166.28] share here we have a lot of the same
[5163.48 - 5169.12] falsities from other fictitious versions
[5166.28 - 5171.60] and in this version Ashley also again
[5169.12 - 5174.84] flipped the order of the Airbnb with a
[5171.60 - 5176.76] cat and the Airbnb without a cat
[5174.84 - 5179.76] Ashley's saying here that they had the
[5176.76 - 5181.80] cat for six months before giving it away
[5179.76 - 5184.76] which is really funny because the woman
[5181.80 - 5186.68] with 414 pages of notes from the
[5184.76 - 5189.00] Facebook group Ashley originally asked
[5186.68 - 5192.56] for help and called her out on that lie
[5189.00 - 5195.60] by commenting PS no mention in my notes
[5192.56 - 5198.28] that you had a cat for months just a
[5195.60 - 5200.76] week this woman is correct that Ashley
[5198.28 - 5202.68] did not have the cat for months as a
[5200.76 - 5205.24] reminder for everyone of the receipts
[5202.68 - 5207.92] and the timeline Ashley texted this to a
[5205.24 - 5211.96] friend on June
[5207.92 - 5214.72] 28th cat has been gone 4
[5211.96 - 5218.00] days which means that Ashley only had
[5214.72 - 5219.92] the cat for a maximum of 18 days after
[5218.00 - 5222.92] she texted about considering taking the
[5219.92 - 5225.40] cat in on June 7th we don't have a
[5222.92 - 5227.96] record of the exact date Ashley took the
[5225.40 - 5229.72] cat in after the 7th it very well could
[5227.96 - 5232.16] have only been a week before she gave it
[5229.72 - 5234.44] away on the 24th but she did not have it
[5232.16 - 5238.24] for longer than 18 days and she most
[5234.44 - 5241.24] certainly did not have it for 6 months
[5238.24 - 5243.60] Ashley Foster's lies are
[5241.24 - 5245.76] pathological it's also worth mentioning
[5243.60 - 5247.76] that Ashley interestingly deleted that
[5245.76 - 5250.16] whole entire post along with all of
[5247.76 - 5251.40] these comments a few short days after
[5250.16 - 5253.96] she posted
[5251.40 - 5255.92] them that's the end of this version of
[5253.96 - 5257.96] the cat story I hope your head isn't
[5255.92 - 5259.80] spinning too much yet because believe it
[5257.96 - 5262.76] or not there are still two
[5259.80 - 5264.92] more the next false version is Ashley's
[5262.76 - 5266.80] first ever public post about the
[5264.92 - 5268.08] infamous cat story from
[5266.80 - 5271.04] [Music]
[5268.08 - 5274.76] 2019 when started struggling with his
[5271.04 - 5277.44] rash we had no idea what was causing it
[5274.76 - 5279.68] but about a week later I started feeling
[5277.44 - 5282.88] it was the kitten we adopted for our
[5279.68 - 5285.40] daughter thankfully some friends of ours
[5282.88 - 5288.92] fell in love with sweet Wendell Kitty
[5285.40 - 5292.32] and adopted him he so loved in their
[5288.92 - 5295.16] home but even after the cat left the
[5292.32 - 5298.56] reactions continued they got a little
[5295.16 - 5301.80] better maybe but it was so hard to tell
[5298.56 - 5301.80] because it kind of came in
[5302.40 - 5307.84] waves okay right here she's admitting
[5305.36 - 5309.80] that they got rid of the cat early on
[5307.84 - 5312.48] not months later and that it still
[5309.80 - 5314.00] didn't fix the problem which is true
[5312.48 - 5316.08] she's leaving out the fact that Anthony
[5314.00 - 5317.32] told her the cat was part of the problem
[5316.08 - 5319.68] and that that's when she made the
[5317.32 - 5322.04] decision to give the cat away she's
[5319.68 - 5323.96] acting like it was her own Discovery in
[5322.04 - 5326.24] other versions that she claimed the cat
[5323.96 - 5327.88] allergy was her own Discovery in she
[5326.24 - 5330.88] claimed she didn't make the discovery
[5327.88 - 5332.20] and until going to Hawaii later on here
[5330.88 - 5334.60] she's claiming that she made the
[5332.20 - 5336.28] discovery essentially right away
[5334.60 - 5338.60] Ashley
[5336.28 - 5342.32] continues on the advice of medical
[5338.60 - 5346.32] medium I completely overh my diet and
[5342.32 - 5349.68] took out nuts seeds oils anything that
[5346.32 - 5353.04] could potentially be an irritant my diet
[5349.68 - 5355.24] consisted and still does of fruits and
[5353.04 - 5357.20] vegetables if you want to know more
[5355.24 - 5360.56] about what I eat you can check out my
[5357.20 - 5365.44] story highlights the diet changes helped
[5360.56 - 5365.44] so much and were a critical component
[5365.48 - 5370.12] Ashley's admitting here at least that
[5367.72 - 5372.20] the dietary changes did help and were a
[5370.12 - 5374.12] critical component she's Miss
[5372.20 - 5376.32] representing the dietary changes as if
[5374.12 - 5379.20] Anthony had advised her to cut out oils
[5376.32 - 5381.88] and only eat fruits and vegetables when
[5379.20 - 5384.56] in fact he said that olive oil was fine
[5381.88 - 5387.32] and simply told her to cut out nuts and
[5384.56 - 5389.12] seeds in this story version Ashley
[5387.32 - 5391.92] wasn't clear about the timeline of the
[5389.12 - 5394.24] dietary changes Ashley only implemented
[5391.92 - 5397.72] getting off nuts and seeds after
[5394.24 - 5400.00] September 18th in 2018 and that's when
[5397.72 - 5402.28] she started seeing results in her son it
[5400.00 - 5404.48] was only less than a month before she
[5402.28 - 5407.88] went to Hawaii and started eating nuts
[5404.48 - 5412.08] again then Ashley said
[5407.88 - 5414.72] this but our guy kept on reacting we had
[5412.08 - 5418.04] our whole house cleaned top to bottom
[5414.72 - 5420.48] including our air ducts that helped some
[5418.04 - 5422.96] but it still
[5420.48 - 5425.28] persisted now she's saying that her son
[5422.96 - 5427.72] kept reacting even after the dietary
[5425.28 - 5429.28] changes which is not what she said in
[5427.72 - 5431.64] other versions and doesn't even make
[5429.28 - 5434.52] sense in the context of the rest of this
[5431.64 - 5436.96] version Ashley's also admitting here
[5434.52 - 5439.24] that her air ducts were cleaned early on
[5436.96 - 5441.72] before the retreat and that that still
[5439.24 - 5443.32] didn't fix the problem which is true and
[5441.72 - 5445.00] contradicts what she said in other
[5443.32 - 5447.24] versions about getting the house
[5445.00 - 5449.84] including the air duct cleaned after the
[5447.24 - 5453.04] retreat she goes
[5449.84 - 5455.04] on it wasn't until we went to Hawaii
[5453.04 - 5458.04] that we found the fin piece of the
[5455.04 - 5461.28] puzzle we stayed in an airbeam bee that
[5458.04 - 5465.36] had a cat in it before we arrived and
[5461.28 - 5467.24] within hours broke out in hives all over
[5465.36 - 5470.24] his
[5467.24 - 5472.44] body here's where it gets absurd because
[5470.24 - 5475.56] this part makes no sense after what you
[5472.44 - 5477.72] just heard her say Ashley's deliberately
[5475.56 - 5479.92] leaving out so many things from this
[5477.72 - 5481.72] story she's leaving out the fact that
[5479.92 - 5484.00] Anthony told her that the cat was a
[5481.72 - 5485.68] trigger for her son's eczema and that
[5484.00 - 5488.64] that that's when she decided to get rid
[5485.68 - 5490.40] of the pet cat in the first place she's
[5488.64 - 5492.80] leaving out the fact that she was off of
[5490.40 - 5494.40] nuts and seeds for less than a month and
[5492.80 - 5495.16] then she started eating nuts again at
[5494.40 - 5497.36] The
[5495.16 - 5499.44] Retreat she's leaving out the fact that
[5497.36 - 5502.60] the menu she created for her Hawaii
[5499.44 - 5504.28] retreat was full of nuts she's leaving
[5502.60 - 5506.24] out the fact that the real reason why
[5504.28 - 5509.28] her son broke out in eczema again in
[5506.24 - 5511.52] Hawaii was because of the nuts she
[5509.28 - 5514.12] reintroduced now Ashley's saying that
[5511.52 - 5516.40] there was a cat in the Airbnb before
[5514.12 - 5518.32] they arrived whereas in other versions
[5516.40 - 5521.88] she always said there was a cat in the
[5518.32 - 5523.64] Airbnb while they were there Ashley also
[5521.88 - 5525.44] contradicted herself with this one by
[5523.64 - 5527.76] saying that the retreat cat was the
[5525.44 - 5530.04] missing piece acting like it was such a
[5527.76 - 5532.72] surprise when she said in the beginning
[5530.04 - 5535.00] of this same story version that she
[5532.72 - 5536.60] already knew their pet cat was a trigger
[5535.00 - 5538.72] and that's why they had given it away
[5536.60 - 5541.56] four months prior to the
[5538.72 - 5544.16] retreat and now we have the ninth and
[5541.56 - 5547.16] final version of Ashley's cat story she
[5544.16 - 5550.36] is still weaving and twisting to this
[5547.16 - 5553.16] day Ashley posted this one right at the
[5550.36 - 5555.00] end of last year 20123 as she was
[5553.16 - 5558.88] rattling off a ridiculous list of
[5555.00 - 5562.24] reasons why Anthony is supposedly a
[5558.88 - 5566.00] liar um I have another one with my son's
[5562.24 - 5567.88] eczema where he kept telling me it was
[5566.00 - 5570.40] because I was eating too much fat I was
[5567.88 - 5575.04] a postpartum nursing mom eating like
[5570.40 - 5578.00] less than half an avocado a day um
[5575.04 - 5579.92] and you know he had me testing our house
[5578.00 - 5581.92] for mold and doing all this stuff and my
[5579.92 - 5584.24] son was allergic to our cat and we
[5581.92 - 5587.00] figured that out ourselves
[5584.24 - 5591.00] and so that was another one where I was
[5587.00 - 5591.00] like wait why why was he so
[5591.52 - 5597.12] wrong why was he so wrong my son was
[5594.88 - 5598.92] allergic to our cat and we figured that
[5597.12 - 5602.44] out
[5598.92 - 5605.72] ourselves versus what actually happened
[5602.44 - 5608.40] according to her own text
[5605.72 - 5611.68] messages I talked to Aunt and he said
[5608.40 - 5611.68] it's most likely the
[5612.08 - 5617.44] cat and she also said that he kept
[5615.20 - 5619.04] telling me it was because I was eating
[5617.44 - 5623.60] too much
[5619.04 - 5626.60] fat versus what actually
[5623.60 - 5628.56] happened still dealing with skin but I
[5626.60 - 5631.20] spoke with Aunt and he got us on the
[5628.56 - 5633.80] right track I think we'll be through it
[5631.20 - 5636.16] in the next few weeks I was having
[5633.80 - 5639.08] having very little fat like maybe one
[5636.16 - 5641.48] tablespoon of cashews a day but it turns
[5639.08 - 5645.32] out it's not the fat itself it's the
[5641.48 - 5647.60] nuts he actually said like olive oil
[5645.32 - 5648.96] would be better than cashews in terms of
[5647.60 - 5652.16] helping
[5648.96 - 5652.84] heal it turns out it's not the fat it's
[5652.16 - 5656.52] the
[5652.84 - 5659.40] nuts as you can see Ashley Foster is a
[5656.52 - 5661.88] liar who lies about lying while accusing
[5659.40 - 5663.96] Anthony of being a liar as she's lying
[5661.88 - 5666.92] and has told nine different
[5663.96 - 5669.60] contradictory versions of the same
[5666.92 - 5671.76] story yet another contradiction is that
[5669.60 - 5673.80] in one of these versions Ashley claims
[5671.76 - 5676.04] that her only fat Source each day was
[5673.80 - 5677.76] avocado and in the other version she
[5676.04 - 5680.56] claimed that her only fat Source each
[5677.76 - 5683.56] day was cashews these two things cannot
[5680.56 - 5685.92] be true at the same time and in this
[5683.56 - 5687.72] most recent version Ashley also added in
[5685.92 - 5691.16] for the first time the claim that
[5687.72 - 5693.72] Anthony had her quote testing for mold
[5691.16 - 5696.76] and all this stuff which is just
[5693.72 - 5699.12] blatantly not true that is completely
[5696.76 - 5702.24] false and it's very telling that she's
[5699.12 - 5704.36] only adding that on now years and years
[5702.24 - 5706.68] after she started telling this story
[5704.36 - 5708.92] Ashley likes to try to play to people's
[5706.68 - 5712.24] emotions because many people are
[5708.92 - 5714.32] concerned about mold I never told Ashley
[5712.24 - 5716.32] to test for mold in her multi-million
[5714.32 - 5720.04] doll Malibu
[5716.32 - 5722.04] mansion further more in only one of the
[5720.04 - 5725.56] previous false versions of the cat story
[5722.04 - 5729.88] we went through Ashley mentioned
[5725.56 - 5731.48] purifiers um and he told me all this
[5729.88 - 5733.80] different stuff we had like a billion
[5731.48 - 5736.04] air
[5733.80 - 5738.40] purifiers Ashley was trying to make it
[5736.04 - 5740.56] look like she did everything right she
[5738.40 - 5742.48] followed all of Anthony's advice she
[5740.56 - 5745.88] spent a bunch of money on air purifiers
[5742.48 - 5749.28] for the cat dander and still Anthony was
[5745.88 - 5752.36] wrong but here is what actually happened
[5749.28 - 5754.28] with the air purifiers in late 2018
[5752.36 - 5756.64] there were massive fires devastating the
[5754.28 - 5759.60] area of Malibu California where Ashley
[5756.64 - 5762.20] was living at the time on November 9th
[5759.60 - 5764.16] Anthony texted her to check in Anthony's
[5762.20 - 5768.08] going to read the text he had sent to
[5764.16 - 5769.96] her please be safe hang in their Ash
[5768.08 - 5773.08] worried about you and your precious
[5769.96 - 5775.84] babies hope you are okay praying for
[5773.08 - 5778.44] your house to be safe too and putting
[5775.84 - 5781.08] light all around
[5778.44 - 5783.12] it so Anthony you told her that you were
[5781.08 - 5786.12] putting light around her house can you
[5783.12 - 5788.48] explain for everyone what that means I
[5786.12 - 5791.36] asked Spirit to Encompass the entire
[5788.48 - 5793.04] house with a force of light and I was
[5791.36 - 5794.92] envisioning this force of light
[5793.04 - 5797.56] inhibiting
[5794.92 - 5800.52] Flames okay so you did that and then
[5797.56 - 5802.08] Ashley texted you on November 21st to
[5800.52 - 5805.12] say
[5802.08 - 5808.56] this okay friend what are we talking
[5805.12 - 5811.56] about here the devastation is immense
[5808.56 - 5813.64] the house next to us burnt to the ground
[5811.56 - 5816.40] obviously we want to do the highest
[5813.64 - 5818.84] level of smoke remediation we can but
[5816.40 - 5821.20] with all of the ash in the environment
[5818.84 - 5824.08] and the months it will take to remove
[5821.20 - 5827.04] the debris do we need to plan to be
[5824.08 - 5830.12] somewhere else for a few
[5827.04 - 5833.20] months next Ashley sends a video of her
[5830.12 - 5835.40] husband showing their house in perfect
[5833.20 - 5837.16] condition and then her husband pivots
[5835.40 - 5839.80] the camera so that it's looking through
[5837.16 - 5841.52] the burnt part of their Hedges out at
[5839.80 - 5844.32] the empty plot where the neighbor's
[5841.52 - 5848.20] house used to be in awe the video gets
[5844.32 - 5848.20] cut off a bit but he says
[5862.64 - 5869.32] unbelievable next Ashley sends this
[5866.48 - 5872.76] text that's our house versus the house
[5869.32 - 5875.84] next door supernaturally protected and
[5872.76 - 5875.84] surrounded By
[5875.92 - 5881.52] Angels so Anthony and spirit protected
[5879.24 - 5883.96] Ashley's multi-million doll home with
[5881.52 - 5886.52] light and the video shows that her house
[5883.96 - 5887.80] was completely Untouched by the fires
[5886.52 - 5890.36] while her neighbor's house was
[5887.80 - 5892.80] completely disintegrated down to the
[5890.36 - 5894.84] ground it's literally right next to
[5892.80 - 5897.64] Ashley's home there's hardly any space
[5894.84 - 5899.48] in between it's just a very tall wall of
[5897.64 - 5901.72] Hedges and only a small part of the
[5899.48 - 5903.52] hedges burnt down that whole thing
[5901.72 - 5905.12] should have lit up in flames and taken
[5903.52 - 5906.76] Ashley's house along with it it makes no
[5905.12 - 5908.84] sense there's nothing left of the
[5906.76 - 5910.64] neighbor's house and it's truly a
[5908.84 - 5911.92] miracle that Ashley's home was left
[5910.64 - 5914.88] entirely
[5911.92 - 5919.16] intact then Anthony texted her
[5914.88 - 5921.56] back amazing your house was so protected
[5919.16 - 5924.12] if you stay there you just have to stay
[5921.56 - 5926.72] inside a lot because when the wind blows
[5924.12 - 5929.12] there's a lot of Ash in the air that
[5926.72 - 5931.36] will go into your lungs but if you're
[5929.12 - 5934.08] inside a lot and the inside isn't
[5931.36 - 5936.60] saturated with smoke smell then you can
[5934.08 - 5941.24] stay there and work with it once the
[5936.60 - 5945.40] rain comes the outside will be so much
[5941.24 - 5945.40] better the conversation
[5945.80 - 5950.84] continues okay I think in general we're
[5948.52 - 5953.16] planning to stay away until beginning of
[5950.84 - 5955.68] the year and have the whole house
[5953.16 - 5959.24] treated with ozone and clean top to
[5955.68 - 5963.08] bottom you think by January is a good
[5959.24 - 5965.00] bet yes that's what I would do wait till
[5963.08 - 5967.36] then
[5965.00 - 5969.68] and we're going to buy some of the IQ
[5967.36 - 5969.68] air
[5969.84 - 5974.48] filters it's important to note here that
[5972.40 - 5977.32] in this conversation that takes place
[5974.48 - 5980.60] one month after Ashley's Hawaii Retreat
[5977.32 - 5983.80] and is about smoke remediation not about
[5980.60 - 5985.48] Eczema or a cat Ashley brings up air
[5983.80 - 5988.32] filters and says they're going to buy
[5985.48 - 5990.48] some for smoke remediation Anthony was
[5988.32 - 5991.84] not the one to bring it up the
[5990.48 - 5996.08] conversation goes
[5991.84 - 5997.92] on some rain could come in between
[5996.08 - 5999.64] too
[5997.92 - 6002.68] yep
[5999.64 - 6006.08] yes lots of rain
[6002.68 - 6008.20] predicted get the multi-gas one plus
[6006.08 - 6010.52] when the rain comes with no brush to
[6008.20 - 6014.68] hold it back there will be lots of
[6010.52 - 6016.84] landslides so best to be away
[6014.68 - 6019.28] yes got
[6016.84 - 6022.88] it thank
[6019.28 - 6025.64] God Amen so many prayers covering our
[6022.88 - 6030.20] home thank
[6025.64 - 6033.40] you okay so as I said this was one month
[6030.20 - 6035.16] after Ashley's Hawaii Retreat Ashley had
[6033.40 - 6039.32] gotten rid of their household cat on
[6035.16 - 6041.72] June 24th of this same year five months
[6039.32 - 6044.28] prior to this conversation the air
[6041.72 - 6047.28] purifiers were her idea and she got them
[6044.28 - 6049.20] for smoke remediation not for pet dander
[6047.28 - 6051.92] or her son's eczema like one of her
[6049.20 - 6054.36] false versions of the infamous cat story
[6051.92 - 6057.40] suggested it's also worth noting that
[6054.36 - 6061.28] this conversation on November 21st about
[6057.40 - 6064.20] Ashley's home took place 8 days after
[6061.28 - 6066.64] Stephanie passed away Ashley made no
[6064.20 - 6068.68] mention of Stephanie or any problems she
[6066.64 - 6070.24] had with Anthony around it but she
[6068.68 - 6073.40] certainly wanted his help with her
[6070.24 - 6076.36] multi-million dollar home I know that
[6073.40 - 6078.04] this is a lot for everybody to take in
[6076.36 - 6080.76] thank you Amber for doing this for the
[6078.04 - 6083.32] community the evidence we presented
[6080.76 - 6086.60] today shows that Ashley can't get any
[6083.32 - 6088.84] anything right even historical stories
[6086.60 - 6091.08] that can be easily fact checked and she
[6088.84 - 6093.60] has to fabricate and lie about her own
[6091.08 - 6096.24] personal experiences with me to try to
[6093.60 - 6099.28] convince people that I got it wrong to
[6096.24 - 6102.96] call me a liar and a fraud when as you
[6099.28 - 6105.12] can see here she is caught so many times
[6102.96 - 6107.48] in just what has been covered in this
[6105.12 - 6110.52] episode alone lying and telling
[6107.48 - 6113.28] fraudulent Stories the story about the
[6110.52 - 6116.08] ten booms and the Holocaust is a lip m
[6113.28 - 6118.84] test to Ashley's inability to tell not
[6116.08 - 6121.24] only stories about Stephanie and me and
[6118.84 - 6124.00] the cat but clearly shows that she
[6121.24 - 6126.44] cannot even get a historic story even
[6124.00 - 6128.88] partially correct it's one thing when
[6126.44 - 6131.60] people hear all these versions of lies
[6128.88 - 6133.96] and falsehoods and her madeup stories
[6131.60 - 6136.44] but it's another when you have a
[6133.96 - 6139.56] landmark such as the 10 Booms to clearly
[6136.44 - 6141.32] see how Ashley can't get it right it's
[6139.56 - 6143.24] another reason why I wouldn't do
[6141.32 - 6145.92] business with Ashley when she proposed
[6143.24 - 6148.68] so many business deals she wanted to
[6145.92 - 6151.16] partner with me on painfully almost
[6148.68 - 6153.72] everything she said always had falsities
[6151.16 - 6156.28] or mistakes or misinformation saturated
[6153.72 - 6158.44] in it what Ashley's been doing with the
[6156.28 - 6161.52] cat story is what she's been doing with
[6158.44 - 6164.36] her entire smear campaign against me as
[6161.52 - 6167.64] a whole it's an endless stream of sloppy
[6164.36 - 6171.72] lies and psychological games how sad is
[6167.64 - 6174.08] it that I actually did help her son he
[6171.72 - 6177.64] recovered and I helped her out of the
[6174.08 - 6180.00] kindness of my heart for free I wasn't
[6177.64 - 6182.52] making any money from it I wasn't
[6180.00 - 6185.20] gaining anything from it and because she
[6182.52 - 6188.76] has nothing to show that I'm a bad guy
[6185.20 - 6191.40] or did anything wrong she has to lie and
[6188.76 - 6193.52] take something that was positive that I
[6191.40 - 6196.60] actually helped her with and was
[6193.52 - 6198.88] accurate about and perverted to make it
[6196.60 - 6201.52] look like the exact opposite of what
[6198.88 - 6204.52] really happened so that she can try to
[6201.52 - 6206.64] take me down
[6204.52 - 6209.00] there are people who have serious mental
[6206.64 - 6211.76] health problems there are people who are
[6209.00 - 6213.48] just inaccurate and get things wrong
[6211.76 - 6215.36] there are people who attack and
[6213.48 - 6217.96] intentionally set out to harm other
[6215.36 - 6220.76] people there are people who FIB there
[6217.96 - 6223.64] are people who are pathological liars
[6220.76 - 6226.44] and then there's Ashley Foster she's
[6223.64 - 6229.00] truly in a league of her own this is
[6226.44 - 6231.84] unprecedented as we've said and in my
[6229.00 - 6234.60] opinion it should be studied
[6231.84 - 6236.64] clinically what's even more disturbing
[6234.60 - 6239.08] is that this episode just barely
[6236.64 - 6241.76] scratches the surface this is what
[6239.08 - 6244.80] Ashley does with every story with every
[6241.76 - 6248.68] claim with every rumor she spreads it's
[6244.80 - 6250.20] all this distorted it's all this Twisted
[6248.68 - 6252.24] it's all this
[6250.20 - 6254.72] untrue and the other plotters have
[6252.24 - 6257.48] followed suit and have the same patterns
[6254.72 - 6259.64] we could do hundreds of podcast episodes
[6257.48 - 6262.56] on twisting the lies and falsities like
[6259.64 - 6264.40] this the evidence is all there and this
[6262.56 - 6266.92] is just the
[6264.40 - 6268.80] beginning with the Stephanie story
[6266.92 - 6270.96] Ashley and Stephanie's brother are
[6268.80 - 6272.96] abusing the fact that nobody else has
[6270.96 - 6275.08] access to the entirety of Stephanie's
[6272.96 - 6277.12] text threads with all of the people who
[6275.08 - 6279.16] were involved or any of the other
[6277.12 - 6281.28] evidence to see what Ashley and
[6279.16 - 6283.48] Stephanie's brother have hidden
[6281.28 - 6285.56] manipulated taken out of context and
[6283.48 - 6287.44] altered as they're making outrageous
[6285.56 - 6289.92] claims against Anthony and trying to
[6287.44 - 6292.48] rewrite history to push a fake story
[6289.92 - 6295.20] we'll get to more of that in due time
[6292.48 - 6297.56] the 10 Boom story and the cat story are
[6295.20 - 6300.52] examples that everyone can use to verify
[6297.56 - 6303.24] for themselves exactly the level of
[6300.52 - 6305.76] unimaginable reality Distortion and
[6303.24 - 6308.12] perversion of the truth that Ashley and
[6305.76 - 6310.52] her hateful group have continued to
[6308.12 - 6312.24] employ with the Stephanie story and with
[6310.52 - 6314.88] the other stories that they
[6312.24 - 6317.24] tell one online commenter who has
[6314.88 - 6319.20] observed the behavior of Ashley and her
[6317.24 - 6321.88] hateful group said
[6319.20 - 6324.64] this everything they accuse Anthony and
[6321.88 - 6327.64] the mm community of being is what they
[6324.64 - 6329.88] themselves are doing to the mm Community
[6327.64 - 6332.40] it's so frustrating and sad the amount
[6329.88 - 6334.40] of gaslighting belittling and just pure
[6332.40 - 6336.80] hostility from these people is hard to
[6334.40 - 6339.04] Bear especially after years of suffering
[6336.80 - 6341.20] chronic illness with no answers and all
[6339.04 - 6343.52] the trauma that comes with that it's
[6341.20 - 6345.20] painful and scary to witness how
[6343.52 - 6347.12] committed these people are to twisting
[6345.20 - 6348.92] reality and taking advantage of people
[6347.12 - 6350.04] who don't know any better how do they
[6348.92 - 6353.36] live with
[6350.04 - 6356.60] themselves another online commenter said
[6353.36 - 6358.40] this it's so despicable what are we in
[6356.60 - 6360.80] high school this is something high
[6358.40 - 6362.96] schoolers and middle schoolers do it's
[6360.80 - 6365.40] Petty and narcissistic behavior it's a
[6362.96 - 6368.20] narcissistic smear campaign it's got
[6365.40 - 6369.76] narcissists written all over it only
[6368.20 - 6372.68] people with hatred in their hearts would
[6369.76 - 6375.00] do this it's obvious but then comes the
[6372.68 - 6376.76] fakeness the lies the smearing of
[6375.00 - 6379.56] another person's name and reputation
[6376.76 - 6381.08] Without Regrets they are heartless
[6379.56 - 6383.32] you're supposed to take everyone into
[6381.08 - 6385.96] consideration before you act and speak
[6383.32 - 6388.04] that is what adults do they will die a
[6385.96 - 6389.56] slow and lonely death on their socials
[6388.04 - 6392.28] and they should regret this the rest of
[6389.56 - 6393.64] their lives but Ashley probably won't
[6392.28 - 6395.96] she's always seemed like she doesn't
[6393.64 - 6398.60] actually care about others which is
[6395.96 - 6401.80] depressing and a third online commenter
[6398.60 - 6403.84] said this it has become ridiculous now
[6401.80 - 6405.72] Amber I truly hope the plotters just
[6403.84 - 6408.56] fade into the background and leave this
[6405.72 - 6410.84] wonderful mm Community alone they are
[6408.56 - 6413.20] cruel very childish obsessed with
[6410.84 - 6415.08] revenge and embarrassing not forgetting
[6413.20 - 6417.36] the Carnage they leave behind that you
[6415.08 - 6419.60] mm and the community have to pick up and
[6417.36 - 6420.80] repair for those that sadly fell for
[6419.60 - 6424.12] their
[6420.80 - 6426.16] lies Ashley has formed her hateful Group
[6424.12 - 6428.20] by taking advantage of people who
[6426.16 - 6430.60] already have an ulterior reason why they
[6428.20 - 6432.72] don't like medical medium whether it's
[6430.60 - 6434.36] pure spiritual discrimination or
[6432.72 - 6436.56] somebody who sells ionizer water
[6434.36 - 6438.00] machines for example who got mad at
[6436.56 - 6440.96] Anthony when he started sharing about
[6438.00 - 6442.56] the downsides of ionizer water machines
[6440.96 - 6443.72] because of how much influence he has in
[6442.56 - 6445.96] the health
[6443.72 - 6447.44] industry they're also taking advantage
[6445.96 - 6449.40] of the fact that when people are dealing
[6447.44 - 6451.08] with chronic illness they often get
[6449.40 - 6453.72] confused about their
[6451.08 - 6455.60] symptoms when somebody's confused
[6453.72 - 6458.12] they're may be not reading the books or
[6455.60 - 6460.52] understanding trajectory or flare Cycles
[6458.12 - 6462.84] or new exposures they're may be having a
[6460.52 - 6464.76] hard time implementing the information
[6462.84 - 6467.04] they're frustrated with their symptoms
[6464.76 - 6468.80] they're emotional they're vulnerable and
[6467.04 - 6471.12] then they come across a post from Ashley
[6468.80 - 6473.36] Foster that says Anthony is a liar and a
[6471.12 - 6476.04] fraud he missed the fact that my son had
[6473.36 - 6477.96] a cat allergy he put me on a restrictive
[6476.04 - 6481.36] diet that made my nails break and my
[6477.96 - 6484.36] hair fall out it strikes a cord it
[6481.36 - 6487.36] instills doubt and fear and that is
[6484.36 - 6489.48] Ashley's goal when in reality the story
[6487.36 - 6490.48] she told is the opposite of what
[6489.48 - 6493.40] actually
[6490.48 - 6496.32] happened it's all lies designed to play
[6493.40 - 6498.00] on people's emotions it's sick it's
[6496.32 - 6500.52] manipulative and it's
[6498.00 - 6502.88] self-serving Ashley does not care about
[6500.52 - 6505.60] the chronically ill Ashley doesn't care
[6502.88 - 6508.08] about people healing Ashley has publicly
[6505.60 - 6511.24] attacked shamed and humiliated the
[6508.08 - 6513.20] chronically ill and women and children
[6511.24 - 6516.00] which is going to be exposed in this
[6513.20 - 6519.32] series this is all about Ashley getting
[6516.00 - 6522.20] what she wants and she will lie and use
[6519.32 - 6525.44] and harm anyone that she needs to in the
[6522.20 - 6528.04] process there's no other way to say it
[6525.44 - 6530.12] it is abusive behavior and Ashley needs
[6528.04 - 6532.84] to be held
[6530.12 - 6535.20] accountable as we are in the process of
[6532.84 - 6537.16] exposing Ashley and her organized
[6535.20 - 6539.60] hateful group for who and what they
[6537.16 - 6541.56] really are it's important to take note
[6539.60 - 6544.08] of their tactics and patterns that are
[6541.56 - 6546.48] likely to follow the plotters have a
[6544.08 - 6549.60] documented history of initiating attacks
[6546.48 - 6551.88] using lies and misinformation and then
[6549.60 - 6554.96] upon getting called out and corrected
[6551.88 - 6557.60] trying to flip it and play victim that
[6554.96 - 6560.16] is not going to work here all this group
[6557.60 - 6562.36] has done is spread verifiable lies and
[6560.16 - 6564.84] falsities they've carelessly attacked
[6562.36 - 6566.64] and harmed hared many innocent people
[6564.84 - 6568.56] they've used and exploited deceased
[6566.64 - 6570.64] individuals and others in the process of
[6568.56 - 6573.40] trying to get what they want they've
[6570.64 - 6575.60] repeatedly explicitly expressed the
[6573.40 - 6577.32] intent to harm medical medium and
[6575.60 - 6579.24] they've even deliberately tried to stop
[6577.32 - 6581.00] Anthony from doing a free event to
[6579.24 - 6583.48] support and raise money for the
[6581.00 - 6585.88] community we have every right to set the
[6583.48 - 6588.08] record straight and to defend the truth
[6585.88 - 6589.68] with facts and evidence and to defend
[6588.08 - 6591.64] the chronically ill against the
[6589.68 - 6595.28] malicious attacks of this group and we
[6591.64 - 6598.04] are going to continue to do so we expect
[6595.28 - 6600.48] the plotters to evade and ignore what
[6598.04 - 6603.44] they have done wrong we expect them to
[6600.48 - 6606.20] continue to lie and spread falsities we
[6603.44 - 6608.68] expect them to Pivot onto something new
[6606.20 - 6612.20] they'll make up and we expect them to
[6608.68 - 6614.72] skew and alter data and to hide critical
[6612.20 - 6617.24] pieces of evidence that undermines their
[6614.72 - 6620.64] entire campaign we also expect the
[6617.24 - 6622.72] plotters to fabricate explanations as
[6620.64 - 6625.20] they do everything they can to try to
[6622.72 - 6629.48] discredit what we're exposing them for
[6625.20 - 6631.96] having done and said in their own words
[6629.48 - 6635.72] but we are using their own text messages
[6631.96 - 6638.68] voice messages social media posts words
[6635.72 - 6641.04] that they spoke on recorded calls and
[6638.68 - 6644.20] other published materials there's no use
