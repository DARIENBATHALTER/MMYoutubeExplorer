[173.04 - 180.36] played Sports together and they meet up
[176.72 - 182.76] later and right when they see each other
[180.36 - 186.20] that's a conversation that has happened
[182.76 - 188.56] a lot where one guy he don't care he'll
[186.20 - 190.08] just say it because it's a buddy of his
[188.56 - 192.48] he'll even laugh about it and then he'll
[190.08 - 195.84] just get a drink but he'll say what
[192.48 - 198.44] happened to you man like what's going on
[195.84 - 200.68] are you seeing the right doctor are you
[198.44 - 202.00] watching your weight and it doesn't even
[200.68 - 204.56] mean they're
[202.00 - 207.56] overweight what happens is when we swell
[204.56 - 211.08] we change as the years go on and our
[207.56 - 214.08] heads get bigger even our chest can get
[211.08 - 217.84] bigger our frame can get bigger but it's
[214.08 - 220.68] not supposed to get bigger but it does
[217.84 - 223.04] so it's not just their head gets bigger
[220.68 - 226.40] but their nose gets bigger did you ever
[223.04 - 228.88] see that out there like somebody's nose
[226.40 - 230.76] it's two times bigger than it was or
[228.88 - 233.48] three times bigger than it was or it
[230.76 - 235.88] gets really bulbous lots of veins on
[233.48 - 239.32] there to or just red did you ever see a
[235.88 - 243.32] guy where the nose is just protruding
[239.32 - 245.84] it's all all swollen and big cheeks all
[243.32 - 248.68] swollen and you also see it in people's
[245.84 - 251.08] faces and heads where it's almost like
[248.68 - 255.24] even above their eyes their foreheads
[251.08 - 257.92] swell out their ears get bigger they
[255.24 - 261.12] even get red it's like it happens over
[257.92 - 263.04] time as the years go by two or three
[261.12 - 265.68] years another two or three years 10
[263.04 - 268.16] years later 15 years and it just
[265.68 - 270.12] develops it's like some kind of
[268.16 - 272.68] metamorphosis you know you might be
[270.12 - 274.68] thinking well yeah sure when someone
[272.68 - 276.84] gets overweight everything's just going
[274.68 - 279.12] to get bigger but I'm not talking about
[276.84 - 280.88] that I'm not talking about weight yes
[279.12 - 282.80] you can have weight you can be
[280.88 - 284.80] overweight and still have this
[282.80 - 285.80] additional problem but this is a
[284.80 - 289.40] separate
[285.80 - 292.56] problem you could be thin and everything
[289.40 - 294.68] just gets thick widens out and
[292.56 - 298.00] everything just gets big including your
[294.68 - 301.28] head everything and not be overweight
[298.00 - 303.96] yes you can have EX excess weight and
[301.28 - 305.64] this additional swelling problem of
[303.96 - 308.44] things just kind of
[305.64 - 312.56] enlarging because that's what it really
[308.44 - 315.96] is everything's enlarging it's
[312.56 - 319.24] swelling but it's not just in
[315.96 - 323.32] intermittent or acute swelling that
[319.24 - 326.64] happened at one time it's a slow slow
[323.32 - 329.56] development and you can't see it you
[326.64 - 332.52] just live your life and it happens every
[329.56 - 334.24] every single day now there are people
[332.52 - 336.76] that see any kind of
[334.24 - 339.40] subtleties women see subtleties they see
[336.76 - 342.32] if they're swelling a little bit or it
[339.40 - 345.20] goes down but that could be bloating and
[342.32 - 348.52] fluid retention see people can have flu
[345.20 - 350.56] retention for years they expand with
[348.52 - 353.20] fluid retention they feel like they have
[350.56 - 355.88] fluid retention they feel the swelling
[353.20 - 358.12] women feel that and then it goes down
[355.88 - 360.88] then it goes up goes down but that's
[358.12 - 364.80] separate that's sep separate than a
[360.88 - 368.20] thickening an expansion of tissue that
[364.80 - 370.96] happens over time as the years go on a
[368.20 - 373.60] thickening is different than lymphatic
[370.96 - 375.48] fluid buildup where you're swelling a
[373.60 - 378.48] little bit you go to the lymphatic
[375.48 - 380.76] massage therapist get some work done you
[378.48 - 382.92] feel better for a couple days and then
[380.76 - 386.04] it starts all over again and you're up
[382.92 - 388.80] and down little bit of swelling fluid
[386.04 - 389.96] retention and then it goes down little
[388.80 - 391.48] bit of swelling
[389.96 - 394.08] goes down you have a little too much
[391.48 - 397.48] salt goes up you eat a little too much
[394.08 - 400.20] party food goes up don't eat for a half
[397.48 - 402.92] a day goes down go see the lymphatic
[400.20 - 404.60] massage therapist goes down and then it
[402.92 - 406.84] just does this thing and you play this
[404.60 - 409.96] game this is different because you can
[406.84 - 412.52] play that game live your life but
[409.96 - 414.80] there's this other thing happening as
[412.52 - 416.80] the years are going on it's this
[414.80 - 420.16] thickening of connective
[416.80 - 423.16] tissue this widening that happens
[420.16 - 426.64] we just start expanding and still you
[423.16 - 428.48] can have that fluid retention still you
[426.64 - 431.04] can go to see your massage therapist and
[428.48 - 433.84] lymphatic drainage massage can still do
[431.04 - 435.76] all that but you're still getting wider
[433.84 - 437.96] and it doesn't mean it's weight it
[435.76 - 439.52] doesn't mean it's fat or anything like
[437.96 - 441.44] you're gaining all this weight of course
[439.52 - 444.40] you can have that too you can be
[441.44 - 447.80] somebody that's gaining weight so you're
[444.40 - 450.56] moving up on the weight and you have the
[447.80 - 453.72] fluid retention and swelling
[450.56 - 455.40] and your thickening which is a different
[453.72 - 457.40] thing and we're talking about the body
[455.40 - 459.60] widening and thickening the connective
[457.40 - 462.08] tissue and the joints and everything
[459.60 - 463.24] expanding there are people who get their
[462.08 - 467.04] lymphatic
[463.24 - 469.24] massage for years decades and as the
[467.04 - 471.64] years go by they get it they're eating
[469.24 - 473.88] pretty good they're eating pure enough
[471.64 - 475.36] they don't eat a lot of processed foods
[473.88 - 478.20] a lot of times they'll go on a healthy
[475.36 - 480.80] keto diet or even a healthy vegetarian
[478.20 - 483.20] diet or healthy vegan diet they care
[480.80 - 485.40] about their health they exercise
[483.20 - 487.68] regularly they take care of themselves
[485.40 - 489.48] they sleep good they try to get 10 hours
[487.68 - 491.84] of sleep every night and they're back to
[489.48 - 494.08] the massage therapist and they're
[491.84 - 496.56] getting wider as the years go on thicker
[494.08 - 499.76] as the years go on you see a photograph
[496.56 - 502.04] of them when they were 25 years old and
[499.76 - 505.08] then you see them when they're 45 years
[502.04 - 508.48] old something's changed and it's not
[505.08 - 510.68] about aging has nothing to do with aging
[508.48 - 512.80] just that by the time they got to 45
[510.68 - 515.00] years old something
[512.80 - 518.48] happened something happened within their
[515.00 - 522.32] body some kind of transformation occurs
[518.48 - 525.60] everything thickened up and widened and
[522.32 - 527.72] it wasn't aging that did this and all
[525.60 - 531.04] these years they did their fluid
[527.72 - 533.24] retention Management program the fluid
[531.04 - 536.60] retention Management program was
[533.24 - 539.64] caffeine a diuretic always kind of
[536.60 - 542.12] peeing out all their fluid not staying
[539.64 - 543.92] that hydrated all those years so they
[542.12 - 545.72] didn't have that much water because
[543.92 - 547.92] they're kind of afraid of it they're at
[545.72 - 550.20] their massage therapist they're at their
[547.92 - 552.92] lymphatic massage therapist and they're
[550.20 - 553.92] afraid to crank in all the water because
[552.92 - 556.40] they feel like they're just going to
[553.92 - 559.16] balloon up so they done all this
[556.40 - 562.48] management over the years including
[559.16 - 565.04] things like body wraps all kinds of
[562.48 - 569.48] massages different diets different
[565.04 - 571.44] exercise programs dry brushing INF red
[569.48 - 575.92] sauna steam
[571.44 - 578.44] saunas Steam Baths all these things but
[575.92 - 581.28] as time goes on it was just management
[578.44 - 583.68] as the years go by managing yes
[581.28 - 586.52] sometimes their vices little alcohol
[583.68 - 590.52] when they want to sometimes too salty or
[586.52 - 592.24] greasy oily foods but they were managing
[590.52 - 595.32] and taking care of themselves in between
[592.24 - 598.60] it all and doing that lymphatic drainage
[595.32 - 600.20] Mage constantly and as the years gone by
[598.60 - 603.24] something still happened and it was
[600.20 - 606.60] Unstoppable for some reason they just
[603.24 - 609.04] got thick and their head
[606.60 - 611.68] enlarged not just their head thickened
[609.04 - 615.12] up but their body thickened up even
[611.68 - 616.32] their feet thickened up but why well
[615.12 - 617.96] we're going to head there in a little
[616.32 - 620.32] bit we still got a lot more to talk
[617.96 - 622.76] about and what I notice right now is
[620.32 - 624.48] that young people people in their 20s
[622.76 - 626.72] that are into Health are doing the
[624.48 - 628.24] lymphatic drainage they're going to see
[626.72 - 631.00] the massage therapist they're getting
[628.24 - 634.20] lymphatic drainage done and they think
[631.00 - 636.56] they found the Holy Grail now I support
[634.20 - 638.24] lymphatic drainage I support massage
[636.56 - 641.64] therapy I think it's one of the greatest
[638.24 - 646.28] things out there but it's been out there
[641.64 - 649.80] it's already been out there it's not new
[646.28 - 653.08] we already have Decades of women using
[649.80 - 656.52] this management tool and still by the
[653.08 - 658.76] time they turn 40 it could be subtle but
[656.52 - 661.72] there is a thickening happening to the
[658.76 - 664.28] tissue tissue connective tissue to the
[661.72 - 666.12] joints sometimes it's more noticeable as
[664.28 - 668.76] it's happening throughout the years and
[666.12 - 673.80] it's not so subtle but it could be
[668.76 - 676.16] passed off as excess weight gain so if
[673.80 - 678.12] weight is gaining it's like well no it's
[676.16 - 680.12] cuz I'm gaining too much weight so then
[678.12 - 683.08] when you try to lose the weight you
[680.12 - 685.68] obviously thin out a little bit and see
[683.08 - 688.64] think that must be it but there's this
[685.68 - 691.12] other thing happening within it all this
[688.64 - 693.80] actual ual tissue expansion that's
[691.12 - 695.80] occurring but when you're young and
[693.80 - 697.88] you're just dealing with some bloating
[695.80 - 700.44] and you want to look your best and feel
[697.88 - 702.92] your best and you don't feel that great
[700.44 - 704.88] and you're into Health it's easy to be
[702.92 - 707.84] like oh my God my lymphatic drainage
[704.88 - 709.60] massage it's the greatest I'm so happy
[707.84 - 711.72] let me go on social media I'll do a post
[709.60 - 715.04] about it now and talk about it and then
[711.72 - 717.88] it Trends and today since swelling is
[715.04 - 720.24] becoming so big so many people are
[717.88 - 722.00] swelling out there by the millions
[720.24 - 724.24] because it's becoming an actual symptom
[722.00 - 726.76] and condition that's happening to
[724.24 - 729.32] everybody that social media is blowing
[726.76 - 732.04] up about lymphatic drainage and
[729.32 - 733.64] lymphatic massage for your swelling but
[732.04 - 736.04] no one's saying that we've had
[733.64 - 738.52] Generations before all of them before
[736.04 - 740.68] the young people that already did it
[738.52 - 744.88] been there and done that years of
[740.68 - 747.88] lymphatic drainage to try to manage and
[744.88 - 750.72] as the years went by their tissue
[747.88 - 753.36] expanded and these same Generations also
[750.72 - 755.88] did the body wraps they did the dry
[753.36 - 759.80] brushing they did different diet
[755.88 - 762.64] programs they intermittent fasted they
[759.80 - 765.88] waved back and forth vacillated from
[762.64 - 768.32] eating to not eating but what's the real
[765.88 - 770.88] reason we're swelling and need a
[768.32 - 774.68] lymphatic massage what's the real reason
[770.88 - 776.92] to begin with the lymphatic massage is
[774.68 - 779.88] not the real reason you're swelling to
[776.92 - 782.80] start with that's just a a Band-Aid
[779.88 - 785.68] until you swell again a day later or 3
[782.80 - 788.68] days later or a week later what caused
[785.68 - 791.36] the swelling allowing you to have to go
[788.68 - 792.96] get a lymphatic drainage massage you
[791.36 - 795.16] know what's crazy is according to
[792.96 - 797.80] alternative medicine and conventional
[795.16 - 799.76] Medicine Science which they teach a lot
[797.80 - 802.96] of professionals is that the body
[799.76 - 805.24] cleanses itself so you don't need to
[802.96 - 808.20] cleanse or to do a cleanse or to do an
[805.24 - 811.16] actual juice or anything because your
[808.20 - 813.40] body takes care of itself but those same
[811.16 - 815.56] people same professionals say oh you
[813.40 - 818.56] better go get a massage you better go
[815.56 - 821.36] get a lymphatic massage so basically you
[818.56 - 824.12] become a te on a cow where you have to
[821.36 - 827.36] be milked every other day because your
[824.12 - 829.92] body can't do it itself but I'm confused
[827.36 - 832.52] here cuz they say your body cleanses
[829.92 - 836.16] itself so why are they then telling you
[832.52 - 838.92] to go get a lymphatic drainage massage
[836.16 - 841.20] if your body cleanses perfectly
[838.92 - 844.20] naturally all on its own and why do we
[841.20 - 847.16] need a manual squeeze you lay there on a
[844.20 - 851.16] table and somebody has to push and
[847.16 - 853.08] squeeze and massage and rub anywhere
[851.16 - 855.40] they can find that feels a little bit
[853.08 - 858.60] more swollen especially anything
[855.40 - 860.60] lymphatic that they can actually access
[858.60 - 864.20] I've always been supportive of lymphatic
[860.60 - 867.00] drainage massage and massage and but
[864.20 - 870.24] I've also been mindful that it's a
[867.00 - 875.32] luxury because not everybody has $100 a
[870.24 - 877.92] week or $100 every 3 days or two days to
[875.32 - 880.04] get it done or the time maybe they're
[877.92 - 882.88] busy a lot of demands in life they're
[880.04 - 886.04] working hard maybe they don't have the
[882.88 - 889.12] excess cash maybe it's not a resource
[886.04 - 890.80] that they have to do but yet on social
[889.12 - 893.24] media of course I see a lot of people
[890.80 - 895.12] like just had my drainage massage it was
[893.24 - 897.52] incredible I'm going to get it again in
[895.12 - 900.40] a couple days I'm going to get it next
[897.52 - 902.68] week and and my massage therapist wants
[900.40 - 904.40] me there five times a month six times a
[902.68 - 908.04] month and I'm adding it up and I'm like
[904.40 - 910.80] some massage therapy now it's like $150
[908.04 - 913.52] some is like $60 if you're lucky but
[910.80 - 916.12] lymphatic drainage somewhere Falls in
[913.52 - 917.80] that area where okay well it's five
[916.12 - 921.04] times a month or six times a month if
[917.80 - 923.44] you have that resource to manage things
[921.04 - 926.04] incredible but I'm always about getting
[923.44 - 929.00] down to the actual problem fixing the
[926.04 - 931.32] root the root cause of why this SW is
[929.00 - 933.40] happening all the time and again we're
[931.32 - 936.40] just managing so we're not fixing the
[933.40 - 939.76] root problem because as each year goes
[936.40 - 941.48] by the tissue expansion is developing
[939.76 - 944.04] and that's not being stopped by a
[941.48 - 946.72] lymphatic massage and that's not being
[944.04 - 950.20] stopped by a regular massage that's
[946.72 - 952.76] helping with managing fluid retention
[950.20 - 954.84] but it's not stopping that thickening
[952.76 - 957.68] that happens with everybody as they're
[954.84 - 959.40] getting older each year goes by and each
[957.68 - 962.56] decade goes by and everything just
[959.40 - 965.36] starts to expand and get bigger I posted
[962.56 - 966.88] a video about edema and swelling and
[965.36 - 969.52] it's pretty interesting I would love to
[966.88 - 971.40] read you some of the comments I thought
[969.52 - 974.60] the head getting larger was part of
[971.40 - 976.56] middle age it's so unattractive a person
[974.60 - 978.92] responds I know someone who started
[976.56 - 982.24] having this problem in their early 30s
[978.92 - 984.92] age is not a factor in some cases here's
[982.24 - 987.28] another I feel swollen all the time
[984.92 - 989.80] can't figure it out eating healthy but
[987.28 - 992.44] healthy foods causing me to feel bloated
[989.80 - 995.68] I feel better when I don't eat at all

[995.68 - 1001.20] food has been poisoned from all angles

[1003.20 - 1008.96] have helped me so much I'm way less

[1058.36 - 1063.36] to my body the next response I've gone a
[1061.56 - 1065.44] day without eating and I did see a
[1063.36 - 1068.24] difference in the swelling but no energy

[1084.44 - 1089.68] veggies out thank you with a heart
[1086.92 - 1091.72] another person from experience veggies

[1095.20 - 1100.32] coconut water eat one large meal at
[1097.40 - 1102.96] night a new guy says stop eating all
[1100.32 - 1105.32] carbs and the swelling will go down so
[1102.96 - 1108.72] other person said oh my God I thought I
[1105.32 - 1111.20] was alone another person nope you're not

[1126.20 - 1132.24] calcium form Googled it give it a go
[1129.52 - 1134.72] removes toxins from your body other
[1132.24 - 1137.48] person bentonite clay is not recommended

[1137.48 - 1141.80] else awesome some info thank you I'm
[1139.72 - 1143.88] learning how to live with crohn's and a
[1141.80 - 1146.40] naturopath told me to try it goes to
[1143.88 - 1148.80] show there's bad so-called good
[1146.40 - 1150.96] this other person chimes in intermittent
[1148.80 - 1153.20] fasting and minimum eating of carbs and
[1150.96 - 1156.12] sugar and more protein stop my swelling
[1153.20 - 1158.92] and inflammation and this other person
[1156.12 - 1161.32] most days I fast 23 hours and I eat one
[1158.92 - 1164.00] meal a day it's not always easy to do
[1161.32 - 1167.04] every day and every day is a new day and
[1164.00 - 1169.64] then oh my God those are all my symptoms

[1169.64 - 1174.08] this is very true thank you for
[1171.24 - 1177.00] explaining this in more detail another
[1174.08 - 1179.72] person exercise daily to combat this
[1177.00 - 1182.68] running helps and then Barbie says
[1179.72 - 1185.48] running genuinely does help even if it's
[1182.68 - 1188.20] 10 minutes a day and then I've always
[1185.48 - 1190.68] had this problem like I was full of air
[1188.20 - 1193.88] it's inflammation eating processed foods
[1190.68 - 1196.40] fast food soda Etc it's all poison
[1193.88 - 1198.72] someone else I feel swollen all the time
[1196.40 - 1201.68] and I eat very little someone said me
[1198.72 - 1203.68] too another I can relate with this don't
[1201.68 - 1205.76] have migraines but my face is rounder
[1203.68 - 1209.16] since 5 years ago but I'm the same
[1205.76 - 1212.00] weight another person key equals
[1209.16 - 1214.20] intermittent fasting this other person
[1212.00 - 1216.08] thank you for the validation doctors
[1214.20 - 1217.64] just look at you like you're crazy when
[1216.08 - 1220.84] you tell them you feel
[1217.64 - 1223.16] swollen and somebody else yes that's me
[1220.84 - 1225.92] right now another person yes I need help
[1223.16 - 1228.20] from this and somebody else so what can
[1225.92 - 1231.12] we do for this and then somebody said
[1228.20 - 1233.24] says is this a new phenomenon is it
[1231.12 - 1234.40] something that has also been prevalent
[1233.24 - 1237.32] in the past
[1234.40 - 1240.04] Generations new person says this is my
[1237.32 - 1243.08] daughter another person and here I was
[1240.04 - 1245.68] thinking it was menopause somebody else
[1243.08 - 1248.80] my legs swell in the summer so what can
[1245.68 - 1251.92] we conclude from these comments to begin
[1248.80 - 1254.04] with everybody's swelling or has some
[1251.92 - 1256.60] type of flute retention problem and
[1254.04 - 1259.32] they're struggling but what was their
[1256.60 - 1262.32] Solutions like all their Wise
[1259.32 - 1267.40] information to help others one was just
[1262.32 - 1269.36] don't eat that's one like go 20 3 hours
[1267.40 - 1270.72] without eating well I don't know if
[1269.36 - 1272.72] that's going to work for people who got
[1270.72 - 1275.64] to work a job or if they have a
[1272.72 - 1278.20] demanding schedule um let's see what was
[1275.64 - 1282.08] another one okay eat lots of grass-fed
[1278.20 - 1284.08] beef and ghee and olive oil oh that's a
[1282.08 - 1286.32] stomach ache I'm already feeling when I
[1284.08 - 1288.56] think about that because they were like
[1286.32 - 1292.52] don't eat any vegetables
[1288.56 - 1294.80] okay so so if I was needing help and I
[1292.52 - 1297.44] went on that thread and I was like well
[1294.80 - 1300.36] I need to find some help in here okay so
[1297.44 - 1302.88] don't eat any vegetables but eat a lot
[1300.36 - 1305.84] of ghee a lot of people just stopped
[1302.88 - 1308.40] eating is is that the best way to go
[1305.84 - 1310.64] just stop eating it's not sustainable
[1308.40 - 1313.52] really because it's a roller coaster
[1310.64 - 1316.24] ride as some of them stay they just had
[1313.52 - 1318.32] no energy and it was really hard to do
[1316.24 - 1319.88] and intermittent fasting may not not be
[1318.32 - 1322.60] the best route there's a lot of
[1319.88 - 1325.04] drawbacks and it's not easy to do check
[1322.60 - 1327.48] out my podcast episode on intermittent
[1325.04 - 1330.20] fasting it's almost 2 hours and it's
[1327.48 - 1332.68] highly informative now when somebody's
[1330.20 - 1335.68] swelling and they say they're swelling
[1332.68 - 1338.12] is it the same swelling that someone
[1335.68 - 1341.28] else is going through is it the same
[1338.12 - 1343.36] swelling somebody else has or if
[1341.28 - 1346.40] somebody's bloating and they feel kind
[1343.36 - 1348.72] of swollen is it the same bloating and
[1346.40 - 1350.84] swelling as someone else
[1348.72 - 1354.04] or when someone says their hands are
[1350.84 - 1355.60] swollen like their fingers are swollen
[1354.04 - 1357.88] and their joints feel a little bit
[1355.60 - 1359.20] swollen is that the same as somebody
[1357.88 - 1362.92] else's
[1359.20 - 1365.40] bloating or is it all the same or is it
[1362.92 - 1367.80] really different well there isn't a
[1365.40 - 1370.32] one-size fits-all here everybody does
[1367.80 - 1372.44] have different nuances
[1370.32 - 1375.12] subtleties different reasons for
[1372.44 - 1379.12] bloating different types of swelling
[1375.12 - 1381.56] some people bloat in their digestive
[1379.12 - 1384.60] tract and they feel like they're
[1381.56 - 1386.64] swelling but it's different than someone
[1384.60 - 1390.32] else who's not bloating in their
[1386.64 - 1393.48] digestive tract but yet they're swelling
[1390.32 - 1395.96] underneath their skin and then there's
[1393.48 - 1399.72] someone who has all of it they're
[1395.96 - 1402.00] bloated and they're swelling and then
[1399.72 - 1404.16] there's someone who has a weight gain
[1402.00 - 1406.92] issue where they're gaining weight so
[1404.16 - 1410.48] they're gaining excess fat and they're
[1406.92 - 1413.72] swelling with retention fluid retention
[1410.48 - 1415.60] and they can have digestive bloating
[1413.72 - 1418.24] plus tissue
[1415.60 - 1420.76] expansion and if they're a woman they
[1418.24 - 1422.28] can have their period if they're a man
[1420.76 - 1424.12] they're not going to have their period
[1422.28 - 1426.88] so that part of the swelling may not be
[1424.12 - 1428.96] in the mix and some women swell a lot
[1426.88 - 1431.52] more during their period and some women
[1428.96 - 1433.92] swell a lot less there's endless
[1431.52 - 1436.80] combinations of swelling too and fluid
[1433.92 - 1440.28] retention 100 people can have swollen
[1436.80 - 1442.08] hands and and 100 people can have a 100
[1440.28 - 1445.60] different reasons why they're swollen in
[1442.08 - 1448.00] the hands because everything changes one
[1445.60 - 1450.48] person ate this the other person ate
[1448.00 - 1452.20] this one person has this problem inside
[1450.48 - 1454.16] their body and the other person has this
[1452.20 - 1456.84] problem inside their body their swelling
[1454.16 - 1459.72] may look almost the same but it's not
[1456.84 - 1463.04] the same even if it looked the same it's
[1459.72 - 1465.24] not the same one person can have
[1463.04 - 1466.88] endometriosis and it's contributing
[1465.24 - 1469.36] adding into all their swelling in a
[1466.88 - 1472.32] different way another person can have
[1469.36 - 1474.36] IBS intestinal tract issues they're on
[1472.32 - 1476.44] the toilet a lot they're aggravated
[1474.36 - 1479.52] their intestinal tracts inflamed they
[1476.44 - 1482.48] have diarrhea another person has fatty
[1479.52 - 1486.04] liver liver is all congested stagnant
[1482.48 - 1489.04] sluggish overworked overburdened another
[1486.04 - 1490.96] person could have gout somebody else
[1489.04 - 1492.44] could have an entirely different issue
[1490.96 - 1494.84] around all of this they could have a
[1492.44 - 1497.00] really bad chemical sensitivity it's
[1494.84 - 1500.12] never going to be the same the exact
[1497.00 - 1503.08] measurements the exact type of fluid or
[1500.12 - 1506.72] amount of fluid or amount of tissue
[1503.08 - 1508.92] expansion or the amount of gas inside
[1506.72 - 1510.96] the intestinal tract either or how the
[1508.92 - 1513.28] intestinal tract is built and how it
[1510.96 - 1515.40] moves and the peristaltic action
[1513.28 - 1518.00] combination of bloating with the
[1515.40 - 1520.16] digestive system swelling with the liver
[1518.00 - 1522.96] and lymphatic system and the
[1520.16 - 1525.80] reproductive system and then the amounts
[1522.96 - 1529.04] and the locations the locations of a
[1525.80 - 1531.92] fluid locations of the swelling are
[1529.04 - 1534.96] going to be different for everybody so
[1531.92 - 1537.56] why is everybody swelling how come
[1534.96 - 1540.16] everybody swelling everybody's got some
[1537.56 - 1542.60] type of flute retention or some type of
[1540.16 - 1545.16] layer on them or swelling so let's go
[1542.60 - 1548.32] into the different causes we're talking
[1545.16 - 1550.44] about mystery swelling mystery fluid
[1548.32 - 1554.76] retention we're not talking about if
[1550.44 - 1558.84] someone has a clearcut case where their
[1554.76 - 1561.60] heart is having a problem or kidney
[1558.84 - 1565.00] failure and they're swelling because of
[1561.60 - 1568.44] kidneys and heart a big part stems from
[1565.00 - 1571.68] the liver that's the place where a lot
[1568.44 - 1573.48] of Calamity occurs our livers get toxic
[1571.68 - 1577.28] as the years go on see your liver is a
[1573.48 - 1579.96] filter like a fish filter in a fish tank
[1577.28 - 1582.88] that's filtering the water your liver is
[1579.96 - 1585.20] filtering your blood it's filtering
[1582.88 - 1587.44] everything before the lymphatic system
[1585.20 - 1590.48] even gets its chance your liver is doing
[1587.44 - 1592.80] it at first your lymphatic system was
[1590.48 - 1595.64] never designed to handle what the world
[1592.80 - 1598.48] throws at us we're talking about
[1595.64 - 1600.52] pesticides herbicides fungicides the air
[1598.48 - 1603.08] freshener chemicals the fragrances the
[1600.52 - 1605.08] Colones perfumes all the different
[1603.08 - 1607.24] petrochemicals and the toxins that fall
[1605.08 - 1609.44] out of the sky all the different
[1607.24 - 1611.64] Pharmaceuticals all the carpet cleaning
[1609.44 - 1614.52] solvents and chemicals that come out of
[1611.64 - 1617.20] carpets all the secondhand smoke all the
[1614.52 - 1619.60] vaping all the psychedelics in the brain
[1617.20 - 1621.24] all the different recreational drugs and
[1619.60 - 1623.40] all the chemicals that are used on them
[1621.24 - 1624.92] when they're growing nanotechnology
[1623.40 - 1627.48] falling out of the sky now
[1624.92 - 1629.68] nanotechnology and the Pharmaceuticals
[1627.48 - 1633.16] hair products chemicals and those body
[1629.68 - 1635.72] products makeup and then tattoos the ink
[1633.16 - 1637.88] itself all the toxic heavy metals I know
[1635.72 - 1640.96] people say well that wasn't my tattoo
[1637.88 - 1643.36] ink but all ink has toxic heavy metals
[1640.96 - 1646.92] even the vegan ink or the cruelty-free
[1643.36 - 1650.48] ink but either way all of this wasn't
[1646.92 - 1652.92] for the lymphatic system but it became
[1650.48 - 1655.28] the lymphatic system's problem but it
[1652.92 - 1658.76] was never supposed to be our lymphatic
[1655.28 - 1661.28] system was not our main filter it was
[1658.76 - 1664.68] just there for our normal bodily
[1661.28 - 1667.28] problems and functions our liver is
[1664.68 - 1670.16] supposed to take the hit it's the Fall
[1667.28 - 1673.68] Guy It's supposed to take on the toxins
[1670.16 - 1675.64] first that are in this world see we're
[1673.68 - 1677.64] not supposed to naturally be up against
[1675.64 - 1680.12] the toxins we're up against but the the
[1677.64 - 1682.64] industries create them and then we get
[1680.12 - 1684.80] exposed to them and our liver it's a
[1682.64 - 1687.44] first line of defense that's the big
[1684.80 - 1691.12] filter all this blood is rushing through
[1687.44 - 1694.12] the liver it's that big massive filter
[1691.12 - 1697.76] it's grabbing onto toxins poisons
[1694.12 - 1700.20] pathogens toxic heavy metals chemicals
[1697.76 - 1703.16] and it's collecting them to keep the
[1700.20 - 1705.72] blood clean enough to protect the heart
[1703.16 - 1708.76] your lymphatic system is critical its
[1705.72 - 1711.16] job is to clean and purify by to get the
[1708.76 - 1713.40] bodily waste some of the bodily waste
[1711.16 - 1715.96] out of the bloodstream and if some of
[1713.40 - 1719.68] that bodily waste is a pathogen a
[1715.96 - 1722.64] bacteria a microb a virus then the
[1719.68 - 1725.28] lymphatic job is to suck it up and have
[1722.64 - 1727.60] your lymphocytes try to kill it your
[1725.28 - 1730.64] lymphatic system is dependent on the
[1727.60 - 1732.92] liver to do the big cleanup because if
[1730.64 - 1735.04] the liver doesn't do the big cleanup
[1732.92 - 1738.24] including pathogens and all the
[1735.04 - 1741.40] industrial toxins and exposures if the
[1738.24 - 1744.64] liver doesn't do that well lymphatic
[1741.40 - 1747.96] system pays the price the liver gets so
[1744.64 - 1750.48] overloaded and so bogg down so fill the
[1747.96 - 1754.40] toxins and poisons it starts to get
[1750.48 - 1757.36] sluggish stagnant fats even get balled
[1754.40 - 1761.08] up inside the liver the liver starts to
[1757.36 - 1763.60] slow down and slow down it can't produce
[1761.08 - 1766.60] its bio reserves it can't function as
[1763.60 - 1769.12] good as it needs to be and then the
[1766.60 - 1771.84] immune system inside the liver starts to
[1769.12 - 1774.76] weaken and the lymphatic system relies
[1771.84 - 1777.40] on the liver's immune system to handle
[1774.76 - 1780.32] the big pathogens the pathogenic
[1777.40 - 1784.96] infections the Epstein bars the shingles
[1780.32 - 1788.80] viruses the hhv 6s the herpes simplexes
[1784.96 - 1791.48] it's there to handle those pathogens so
[1788.80 - 1794.40] that the lymphatic system lymphocytes
[1791.48 - 1797.52] don't have to take on the whole storm
[1794.40 - 1800.88] but it all goes wrong what starts to
[1797.52 - 1803.40] happen is the liver starts to break down
[1800.88 - 1807.04] it can't handle it itself because it's
[1803.40 - 1809.68] so overburdened so stagnant and sluggish
[1807.04 - 1812.96] it's not even just the chemicals and the
[1809.68 - 1815.60] pathogens it's also the way we eat it's
[1812.96 - 1817.96] also the things we use like the caffeine
[1815.60 - 1821.48] and all the vinegars the liver's already
[1817.96 - 1824.56] up against so much but we bombard it and
[1821.48 - 1826.84] then throw the alcohol in the mix or
[1824.56 - 1828.16] drinking and the liver has to suck up
[1826.84 - 1830.76] the alcohol
[1828.16 - 1834.24] it becomes a problem over time where
[1830.76 - 1836.92] your liver the filter weakens starts to
[1834.24 - 1839.36] break down yeah it might look good at
[1836.92 - 1842.68] the doctor's office they might not see
[1839.36 - 1844.96] anything wrong with your liver yet but
[1842.68 - 1847.88] they don't see everything anybody who's
[1844.96 - 1851.28] been sick long enough knows that they
[1847.88 - 1853.28] don't see everything so the liver starts
[1851.28 - 1856.88] to not work properly and then the
[1853.28 - 1859.56] lymphatic system has to work harder but
[1856.88 - 1863.04] here's the thing it's not equipped to
[1859.56 - 1866.88] work harder and that's why everybody's
[1863.04 - 1869.76] swelling and that leads us to tissue
[1866.88 - 1872.68] expansion tissue expansion is not
[1869.76 - 1876.00] lymphatic system expansion tissue
[1872.68 - 1878.00] expansion is all the poisons and toxins
[1876.00 - 1880.80] that got out of the liver and the
[1878.00 - 1883.84] lymphatic system couldn't process or
[1880.80 - 1886.84] handle them or clean them those toxins
[1883.84 - 1889.64] and poisons and chemicals went into deep
[1886.84 - 1893.52] connection itive tissue and deep into
[1889.64 - 1894.20] the organs deep into the brain deep into
[1893.52 - 1896.92] the
[1894.20 - 1900.96] spleen deep into the intestinal tract
[1896.92 - 1904.80] lining deep into the skin these tissues
[1900.96 - 1907.76] got saturated overloaded with multitudes
[1904.80 - 1912.88] of toxins and poisons and pathogenic
[1907.76 - 1916.56] waste year after year after year decade
[1912.88 - 1920.64] after decade even in the bones and then
[1916.56 - 1924.36] everything started to widen out tissue
[1920.64 - 1927.12] started to expand joints started to
[1924.36 - 1930.52] expand this is beyond just fluid
[1927.12 - 1933.56] retention this is beyond just lymphatic
[1930.52 - 1937.00] fluid this is toxins and poisons and
[1933.56 - 1939.04] pathogenic waste that found its way into
[1937.00 - 1942.68] the guts of the person and I don't mean
[1939.04 - 1944.84] intestinal tract I mean into the core of
[1942.68 - 1947.84] their Essence into their bones and
[1944.84 - 1951.88] connective tissue and tendons
[1947.84 - 1955.68] right into their joints and organs and
[1951.88 - 1958.24] it expands because cells expand because
[1955.68 - 1960.92] cells themselves that are made in the
[1958.24 - 1963.92] nerves and the connective tissue and the
[1960.92 - 1968.36] joints they can't hold all the poisons
[1963.92 - 1970.64] and toxins so they inflame and swell and
[1968.36 - 1973.00] then there's the dead cells all the
[1970.64 - 1975.84] cells that have died they didn't get
[1973.00 - 1978.60] flushed out they didn't cleanse out
[1975.84 - 1981.24] lymphatic system didn't cleanse them out
[1978.60 - 1983.72] liver didn't cleanse them out all the
[1981.24 - 1987.72] dead cells that gathered around the
[1983.72 - 1990.48] joints tendons the connective tissue in
[1987.72 - 1993.76] and around the organs create a swelling
[1990.48 - 1996.76] all on their own so an expansion happens
[1993.76 - 1999.08] with our organs and tissue and Bones
[1996.76 - 2001.76] because we have all this dead tissue
[1999.08 - 2005.52] intertwined in all of it that never
[2001.76 - 2007.52] escaped while surrounded by living cells
[2005.52 - 2010.68] that are also filled with toxin and
[2007.52 - 2013.20] poisons and they're at their limit and
[2010.68 - 2016.80] is everything's swelling we need more
[2013.20 - 2020.08] blood so vessels develop varicose veins
[2016.80 - 2023.76] are a prime example of excess veins that
[2020.08 - 2025.96] are actually growing to feed areas that
[2023.76 - 2029.04] were expanding because of a lot of
[2025.96 - 2033.12] toxins and poisons either from pathogens
[2029.04 - 2036.00] chemical exposure or even weight gain or
[2033.12 - 2038.44] even scar tissue or injuries that
[2036.00 - 2041.00] expansion called for more veins to be
[2038.44 - 2043.16] produced but see this expansion is
[2041.00 - 2045.52] subtle all through the body as well
[2043.16 - 2048.28] where you don't need a varicose vein but
[2045.52 - 2051.60] these tiny blood vessels are created all
[2048.28 - 2054.04] around expanding tissue so a thickening
[2051.60 - 2057.92] happens if the liver doesn't get what it
[2054.04 - 2060.28] needs to toxification Cleansing the care
[2057.92 - 2063.88] it really needs to carry us through life
[2060.28 - 2066.56] it enlarges gets stagnant sluggish gets
[2063.88 - 2067.76] filled with too much poison and Toxin
[2066.56 - 2070.24] and then
[2067.76 - 2073.68] those poisons and toxins fill every
[2070.24 - 2076.56] organ they fill the brain they fill the
[2073.68 - 2079.88] heart a heart can enlarge as the years
[2076.56 - 2083.16] go on because it gets so toxic because
[2079.88 - 2085.36] of the liver being a weakened filter
[2083.16 - 2087.84] expansion of tissue can happen in an
[2085.36 - 2090.04] obvious way too not just internally
[2087.84 - 2093.20] where you can't see it or can't see the
[2090.04 - 2095.44] blood vessels internally it can happen
[2093.20 - 2098.60] externally in a way like when someone's
[2095.44 - 2101.60] nose gets bulbous and big there's lots
[2098.60 - 2104.64] of more new blood vessels in the nose
[2101.60 - 2106.52] that have grown so the nose got large
[2104.64 - 2109.24] because it has more blood vessels and
[2106.52 - 2112.04] more tissue this expansion is obvious
[2109.24 - 2114.36] when it comes down to a nose but it's
[2112.04 - 2115.96] not obvious when it's inside all of our
[2114.36 - 2119.12] other connective tissue and everywhere
[2115.96 - 2122.56] else in our organs we can't notice it we
[2119.12 - 2124.52] just notice the person is expanding over
[2122.56 - 2126.52] the years so you take a look at a
[2124.52 - 2128.60] picture when they were in college when
[2126.52 - 2130.88] they were 20 years old and then you take
[2128.60 - 2133.28] a look at them when they're 50 and you
[2130.88 - 2135.84] see the difference when the liver is all
[2133.28 - 2138.56] filled up there's no room anymore in it
[2135.84 - 2141.60] to hold all those toxins so those toxins
[2138.56 - 2144.08] end up leaving the liver escaping or
[2141.60 - 2145.64] going straight through the filter
[2144.08 - 2148.24] straight through the liver in the
[2145.64 - 2151.00] bloodstream and then the lymphatic
[2148.24 - 2154.00] system gets way overburdened it can't
[2151.00 - 2156.16] handle that toxic load so the toxins
[2154.00 - 2159.08] have nowhere to go there either but the
[2156.16 - 2162.24] lymphatics system still draws the toxins
[2159.08 - 2164.40] in problem is the toxins stay in the
[2162.24 - 2167.40] lymphatic system they have nowhere else
[2164.40 - 2170.24] to go and then you need more fluid in
[2167.40 - 2173.24] the lymphatic system to dilute the
[2170.24 - 2175.88] toxins so then the lymphatic system
[2173.24 - 2178.92] keeps on receiving more fluid drawing
[2175.88 - 2180.68] more fluid in to try to dilute the
[2178.92 - 2184.04] toxins that are inside the lymphatic
[2180.68 - 2186.76] system so a trap occurs a catch 22 in
[2184.04 - 2189.80] the lymphatic system lymphatic system
[2186.76 - 2191.92] needs to try to filter but it can't it's
[2189.80 - 2194.16] too overloaded so the Vicious Cycle
[2191.92 - 2196.88] keeps on carrying on and carrying on and
[2194.16 - 2198.84] as that's happening more fluid is
[2196.88 - 2202.88] building up accumulating in the
[2198.84 - 2205.00] lymphatic system with more toxins what's
[2202.88 - 2207.88] interesting though is this can happen
[2205.00 - 2210.32] with the entire lymphatic system the
[2207.88 - 2213.56] entire lymphatic system within the body
[2210.32 - 2216.28] so you can't see it's more fluid based
[2213.56 - 2218.88] in one area versus more fluid retention
[2216.28 - 2221.64] based in another area it's the whole
[2218.88 - 2224.04] body is retaining fluid because the
[2221.64 - 2226.76] lymphatic system is overburdened within
[2224.04 - 2230.16] the entire body this can be hard to see
[2226.76 - 2233.12] on a person one person can have a very
[2230.16 - 2235.84] thin layer of this what that means is
[2233.12 - 2239.12] their whole lymphatic system is slightly
[2235.84 - 2241.96] swollen so the retaining fluid the
[2239.12 - 2244.56] retaining water but you can't quite see
[2241.96 - 2246.88] it the person may be able to feel it
[2244.56 - 2248.76] though and then there's the person that
[2246.88 - 2250.72] can see it they can look in the mirror
[2248.76 - 2252.80] in the morning they can see when it's
[2250.72 - 2254.64] gone and they can look in the mirror at
[2252.80 - 2257.68] the end of the day and they can see when
[2254.64 - 2260.28] it appears cuz it can build up all day
[2257.68 - 2263.16] long at night their liver is trying to
[2260.28 - 2265.88] detox trying to cleanse trying to push
[2263.16 - 2268.56] whatever it can out by morning
[2265.88 - 2271.12] everything is down a bit this is why
[2268.56 - 2273.40] people who are more swollen at the end
[2271.12 - 2276.12] of the day des swell in the morning and
[2273.40 - 2278.16] the cycle goes on every single day this
[2276.12 - 2279.76] person though know has different times
[2278.16 - 2281.12] and moments in their life where all of a
[2279.76 - 2282.48] sudden they're like whoa they're in
[2281.12 - 2284.56] front of the mirror and they're like
[2282.48 - 2286.68] everything's down I'm looking good I'm
[2284.56 - 2288.88] wearing the pants I want to wear I'm
[2286.68 - 2291.00] wearing the shirt I want to wear I like
[2288.88 - 2293.36] this look and then a week later they got
[2291.00 - 2295.80] the layer building up again the fluid
[2293.36 - 2297.88] retention is building in their system
[2295.80 - 2300.68] their whole body is getting that extra
[2297.88 - 2302.16] fluid retention they put their pants on
[2300.68 - 2303.72] they put their shirt on and now they're
[2302.16 - 2305.36] like oh I don't like this and then it
[2303.72 - 2307.40] looks like they're gain gaining weight
[2305.36 - 2309.52] they're getting fat when really they're
[2307.40 - 2312.48] not gaining weight they're not gaining
[2309.52 - 2314.76] extra fat they're gaining extra fluid
[2312.48 - 2316.88] and that extra fluid is just pushing
[2314.76 - 2319.20] everything outward and this is where a
[2316.88 - 2321.72] lot of confusion lies you think you're
[2319.20 - 2324.88] getting heavier and heavier but you're
[2321.72 - 2327.72] not gaining lots of fat you're gaining
[2324.88 - 2331.32] lots of fluid there's people who yes are
[2327.72 - 2334.96] overweight they do have 10 lbs of extra
[2331.32 - 2338.24] fat on their body or 20 lbs of extra fat
[2334.96 - 2342.12] on their body but yet they're 50 lb
[2338.24 - 2344.64] overweight they have 20 to 30 lb of
[2342.12 - 2346.32] fluid retention and that's where a lot
[2344.64 - 2349.04] of confusion lies that's why when
[2346.32 - 2352.52] someone says I intermittent fasted I
[2349.04 - 2356.68] didn't eat for 23 hours or I didn't eat
[2352.52 - 2359.72] for 48 hours and I lost 27 lbs what
[2356.68 - 2363.36] happens is they didn't lose 27 PBS of
[2359.72 - 2366.84] fat they lost 27 pounds of fluid but
[2363.36 - 2369.56] here's the problem you have to eat it's
[2366.84 - 2372.00] the only way to sustain be functional
[2369.56 - 2374.60] have your brain working you can't always
[2372.00 - 2377.68] be on no food so then when you start
[2374.60 - 2380.20] eating again living your life the fluid
[2377.68 - 2382.92] builds all back up again and you're back
[2380.20 - 2385.64] to square one there's so many different
[2382.92 - 2387.96] variations somebody may be only up about
[2385.64 - 2391.40] three or four pounds of fat on their
[2387.96 - 2393.60] body with 10 pounds of fluid somebody
[2391.40 - 2396.80] else might have five pounds of fat on
[2393.60 - 2399.64] their body 12 pounds of fluid someone
[2396.80 - 2403.44] may have 5 lbs of fat on their body and
[2399.64 - 2407.36] 5 lbs of fluid and someone else might
[2403.44 - 2409.84] have 75 lbs of fat with an additional 40
[2407.36 - 2412.56] lb of fluid there are endless
[2409.84 - 2414.84] combinations no two are alike
[2412.56 - 2417.88] everybody's different there are so many
[2414.84 - 2420.76] variables within everyone they're not
[2417.88 - 2422.76] exact they can be off the mark on ounces
[2420.76 - 2424.88] they could be different in pounds but
[2422.76 - 2427.00] none of them are the same but that's not
[2424.88 - 2429.28] the only differences there's differences
[2427.00 - 2431.84] everywhere for example what's causing
[2429.28 - 2434.88] the person's lymphatic swelling what's
[2431.84 - 2436.68] causing their flu retention is different
[2434.88 - 2439.04] than somebody else with their flute
[2436.68 - 2441.36] retention for example somebody could
[2439.04 - 2443.44] have Epstein bar inside the liver and
[2441.36 - 2446.20] that Epstein bar virus could be feeding
[2443.44 - 2449.20] off of mercury inside the liver then
[2446.20 - 2451.24] releasing a Mercury based neurotoxin
[2449.20 - 2454.12] into the bloodstream because the liver
[2451.24 - 2456.84] is so overburdened it can't contain it
[2454.12 - 2459.00] all when that neurotoxin starts floating
[2456.84 - 2461.40] around in the bloodstream it finds its
[2459.00 - 2463.76] way into the lymphatic system so the
[2461.40 - 2466.64] lymphatic system draws it in but our
[2463.76 - 2470.08] lymphatic system isn't used to such an
[2466.64 - 2472.64] unnatural Toxin and poison so it sits in
[2470.08 - 2474.52] the lymphatic system and then requires
[2472.64 - 2476.80] more fluid to build up into the
[2474.52 - 2479.28] lymphatic system in order to control
[2476.80 - 2482.56] that toxin how does the lymphatic system
[2479.28 - 2485.04] control the toxin the immune cells have
[2482.56 - 2487.20] to eat up the Toxin and that's where
[2485.04 - 2489.76] your immune system gets overburdened
[2487.20 - 2492.36] inside the lymphatic system you got an
[2489.76 - 2494.96] army of lymphocytes inside your
[2492.36 - 2497.88] lymphatic system they're there to clean
[2494.96 - 2500.36] up the mess but they can die they can
[2497.88 - 2504.04] expire especially if the toxins and
[2500.36 - 2507.16] poisons are very strong the more toxins
[2504.04 - 2509.96] that enter the lymphatic system then
[2507.16 - 2513.28] more fluid has to be in the lymphatic
[2509.96 - 2515.88] system your lymphocytes can't be in a
[2513.28 - 2519.24] small amount of fluid while up against a
[2515.88 - 2521.16] large amount of toxins and as the larger
[2519.24 - 2523.92] amount of toxins build up inside your
[2521.16 - 2526.80] lymphatic system you need more
[2523.92 - 2529.44] lymphocytes but more lymphocytes can't
[2526.80 - 2531.64] do their job cleaning up the toxins if
[2529.44 - 2534.68] there's very little fluid because the
[2531.64 - 2538.32] toxins are now turning the fluid into a
[2534.68 - 2541.56] toxic sludge so then a requirement
[2538.32 - 2544.32] occurs need more fluid more fluid goes
[2541.56 - 2547.20] into the lymphatic system to give your
[2544.32 - 2549.76] lymphocytes and immune cells a chance so
[2547.20 - 2552.24] they could swim around the toxins and
[2549.76 - 2555.12] gather them up this is why when somebody
[2552.24 - 2558.04] gets a lymphatic massage at this point
[2555.12 - 2560.48] it pushes the fluid out and a large
[2558.04 - 2562.68] amount of toxins Escape into the
[2560.48 - 2564.36] bloodstream and that person if they're
[2562.68 - 2567.00] chronically ill and they're dealing with
[2564.36 - 2570.60] any kind of condition or autoimmune tend
[2567.00 - 2572.48] to get sicker after lymphatic massage if
[2570.60 - 2574.76] someone isn't that sick and they don't
[2572.48 - 2576.60] have a lot of fluid buildup inside their
[2574.76 - 2579.28] lymphatic system and they get a
[2576.60 - 2582.32] lymphatic massage they may not feel it
[2579.28 - 2584.64] so much it may feel more of a relief so
[2582.32 - 2587.72] they had that drainage occur and they're
[2584.64 - 2589.76] happy but someone else could be really
[2587.72 - 2591.92] sick and have a lot more fluid now
[2589.76 - 2594.28] here's the difference too someone's
[2591.92 - 2596.84] lymphatic fluid could be a lot more
[2594.28 - 2599.60] toxic than someone else's lymphatic
[2596.84 - 2601.64] fluid someone might have a different
[2599.60 - 2604.56] Toxin and a different poison in their
[2601.64 - 2608.20] fluid somebody else might have less of a
[2604.56 - 2611.16] toxin less of a pathogen based toxin not
[2608.20 - 2613.52] as toxic so when the the fluid escapes
[2611.16 - 2617.24] into the bloodstream the person doesn't
[2613.52 - 2619.28] get so sick but the person can get sick
[2617.24 - 2621.40] if it's really toxic and it escapes into
[2619.28 - 2623.92] the bloodstream but here's the next
[2621.40 - 2626.52] problem we just think that this fluid
[2623.92 - 2628.80] magically leaves us after we pushed it
[2626.52 - 2631.04] out of our lymphatic system so if
[2628.80 - 2633.24] someone had a lot of toxic fluid in
[2631.04 - 2636.08] their lymphatic system and they had a
[2633.24 - 2638.92] lymphatic massage they think oh good
[2636.08 - 2641.08] will just pee it out and alls well it
[2638.92 - 2644.28] doesn't always work that way a lot of
[2641.08 - 2647.20] the toxins end up back into the liver a
[2644.28 - 2649.76] stagnant sluggish toxic liver a
[2647.20 - 2652.24] dysfunctional liver the toxins go right
[2649.76 - 2654.56] back up into it but since the liver
[2652.24 - 2657.36] can't hold on to any more toxins because
[2654.56 - 2661.16] it's stagnant and sluggish it sends it
[2657.36 - 2664.24] back out now it's recycling it ends up
[2661.16 - 2667.60] back into the lymphatic system 3 days
[2664.24 - 2670.16] later the person's blown up again 5 days
[2667.60 - 2672.56] later the person's blown up again a week
[2670.16 - 2675.88] later they're blown up again because it
[2672.56 - 2678.20] just recycled you pushed it out it went
[2675.88 - 2680.12] through the liver then it went back up
[2678.20 - 2682.92] into the bloodstream back into the
[2680.12 - 2684.92] lymphatic system it's a vicious cycle it
[2682.92 - 2687.40] keeps on circulating and then the
[2684.92 - 2690.04] person's like whoa I'm back in here
[2687.40 - 2692.72] again I have to live here at my massage
[2690.04 - 2695.24] therapists because each day it builds
[2692.72 - 2697.04] back up sometimes it takes a day
[2695.24 - 2700.12] sometimes it's three days days sometimes
[2697.04 - 2702.08] it's 5 days our lymphatic systems are
[2700.12 - 2704.56] one of the most important body systems
[2702.08 - 2708.36] we have so everybody's focused on the
[2704.56 - 2709.60] lymphatic system while missing the liver
[2708.36 - 2713.16] what they're doing is they're
[2709.60 - 2715.88] overlooking the core of the problem the
[2713.16 - 2718.68] place where it all starts if we don't
[2715.88 - 2721.76] fix the liver we can't fix the lymphatic
[2718.68 - 2724.76] system but the liver is no fun to work
[2721.76 - 2727.96] with it's like okay I have a liver the
[2724.76 - 2730.84] liver is stagnant what do I do what do I
[2727.96 - 2733.40] take what do I eat lymphatic system
[2730.84 - 2735.04] massage that's actually fun well it's
[2733.40 - 2737.60] fun for a lot of people that's what I
[2735.04 - 2740.16] hear every day well I'm just going to go
[2737.60 - 2744.72] and get serviced I'm going to head there
[2740.16 - 2747.28] relax ah I'm on the table oo I'm
[2744.72 - 2749.44] thinking about nothing but mantras
[2747.28 - 2751.80] thinking about my affirmations my
[2749.44 - 2754.92] massage therapist is amazing such a
[2751.80 - 2759.12] great person I'm relaxing ah this feels
[2754.92 - 2762.00] so good ooh I'm stagnant here okay that
[2759.12 - 2764.64] feels good ooh yeah I'm a little sore
[2762.00 - 2768.96] here Ah that's nice getting this fluid
[2764.64 - 2771.56] out of me it's so great the liver no fun
[2768.96 - 2774.16] it's like what I can't have a martini
[2771.56 - 2776.96] what I can't ever drink what I can't
[2774.16 - 2778.84] have a greasy fatty meal what I have to
[2776.96 - 2781.32] worry about what I eat I have to worry
[2778.84 - 2783.24] about what I take liver that's the
[2781.32 - 2786.08] problem no let me just go to my massage
[2783.24 - 2788.40] therapist I'll get my lymphatic massage
[2786.08 - 2790.68] she or he can do all the work let them
[2788.40 - 2794.44] do the work that's their job I want them
[2790.68 - 2796.28] to service me but me what 32 ounces of
[2794.44 - 2800.20] celery juice I don't know if I want to
[2796.28 - 2802.68] do that today huh spirulina no not going
[2800.20 - 2804.96] to do that huh heavy metal detox
[2802.68 - 2806.92] smoothie uh maybe not I have an
[2804.96 - 2808.64] appointment at my lymphatic massage
[2806.92 - 2811.84] therapist I think what I'll do is just
[2808.64 - 2814.12] lay on the table think about waves on
[2811.84 - 2816.20] the beach think about that vacation I
[2814.12 - 2819.04] took years ago think about about things
[2816.20 - 2823.20] that make me happy and get my massage
[2819.04 - 2825.52] massages are very healing old old staple
[2823.20 - 2828.36] going back thousands of years when the
[2825.52 - 2831.00] first human being put their hand on the
[2828.36 - 2833.84] other human being there was a feeling it
[2831.00 - 2836.32] had touch is critical for a lot of
[2833.84 - 2839.32] people massage is healing in so many
[2836.32 - 2840.68] ways I've said this forever and you get
[2839.32 - 2843.00] instant
[2840.68 - 2844.60] gratification instant results and a lot
[2843.00 - 2846.08] of people like that like the swelling
[2844.60 - 2849.48] goes down for a lot of people people
[2846.08 - 2852.04] really quick and it feels so good ooh my
[2849.48 - 2854.48] body feels so good after that massage
[2852.04 - 2856.84] it's like instant gratification you can
[2854.48 - 2859.52] even see results right away I always
[2856.84 - 2862.20] recommend to my family and friends
[2859.52 - 2864.80] people I love get a massage it's very
[2862.20 - 2868.24] healing very powerful and if you get a
[2864.80 - 2870.44] really good massage therapist incredible
[2868.24 - 2872.68] really helpful one that cares has
[2870.44 - 2874.68] compassion even better if you're
[2872.68 - 2876.32] somebody that's really sick has a lot of
[2874.68 - 2877.96] flute retention
[2876.32 - 2880.36] you're living with a lot of that flute
[2877.96 - 2882.60] retention it's really hard and you have
[2880.36 - 2886.08] to get lymphatic massage a lot I
[2882.60 - 2888.12] recommend trying to fix the core issue
[2886.08 - 2891.68] get down to the liver start to do
[2888.12 - 2893.72] healing tools clean the liver up so that
[2891.68 - 2895.96] you don't have to get lymphatic massage
[2893.72 - 2898.20] every day or other day or three times a
[2895.96 - 2902.20] week so you don't have to constantly
[2898.20 - 2904.32] force the fluid out fix the liver clean
[2902.20 - 2906.48] the pathogens out and the toxins out
[2904.32 - 2908.56] kill the pathogens help support your
[2906.48 - 2911.80] lymphocytes and the rest of your immune
[2908.56 - 2914.04] system and eventually take yourself out
[2911.80 - 2916.32] of that vicious cycle and then there's
[2914.04 - 2918.48] people with severe lymphadema where
[2916.32 - 2920.64] they're swelling in their leg their
[2918.48 - 2923.32] whole leg swollen they're swelling in
[2920.64 - 2926.68] their arm swelling in their breast
[2923.32 - 2929.20] swelling in their feet their calves
[2926.68 - 2931.48] where it's severe and they have to use
[2929.20 - 2933.52] compression stockings and they're
[2931.48 - 2936.00] suffering from lymphadema because they
[2933.52 - 2938.04] had an injury or they had a surgery y or
[2936.00 - 2941.08] they had breast cancer something else
[2938.04 - 2942.92] happened or an obstruction is going on
[2941.08 - 2945.20] and they're dealing with some severe
[2942.92 - 2948.24] lymphadema in a certain section in their
[2945.20 - 2951.08] body and even then it's critical to fix
[2948.24 - 2952.84] the liver rebuild our immune system our
[2951.08 - 2955.12] immune system is not just our
[2952.84 - 2957.60] lymphocytes and our lymphatic system so
[2955.12 - 2961.12] if somebody has a damaged lymphatic
[2957.60 - 2964.04] system from an injury breast cancer or a
[2961.12 - 2966.28] surgery then that's okay because our
[2964.04 - 2968.32] immune system is in other places too we
[2966.28 - 2969.72] have an immune system in our bloodstream
[2968.32 - 2971.48] that's where a large amount of our
[2969.72 - 2973.48] immune system is we have an immune
[2971.48 - 2976.52] system in our liver we have an immune
[2973.48 - 2979.04] system in other organs so this immune
[2976.52 - 2981.60] system needs to get coddled it needs to
[2979.04 - 2983.96] be cared for it needs to be recovered
[2981.60 - 2986.72] and that's a Powerhouse for us so not
[2983.96 - 2989.44] only do we fix and heal the liver but we
[2986.72 - 2991.52] also heal the liver's immune system and
[2989.44 - 2994.80] our immune system throughout our body
[2991.52 - 2996.88] lymphatic problems aren't genetic now I
[2994.80 - 2999.12] know there's misin information out there
[2996.88 - 3001.24] the gene blame game that's out there
[2999.12 - 3003.40] where anything anybody has they'll just
[3001.24 - 3005.68] be like whoa It's your genes it's your
[3003.40 - 3008.80] genes that's doing it you got bad genes
[3005.68 - 3011.36] faulty genes lympha is from your Gene
[3008.80 - 3013.68] problem genetic man and that's the
[3011.36 - 3016.24] people are told all the time it's not
[3013.68 - 3020.32] genetic There's real true causes it
[3016.24 - 3022.60] could seem genetic if our parents or our
[3020.32 - 3024.36] ancestors had it or somebody in our
[3022.60 - 3027.44] family has it and we're like whoo it is
[3024.36 - 3029.96] genetic but no no we still have the same
[3027.44 - 3032.20] Epstein bar virus passed down from our
[3029.96 - 3035.12] family pathogens are passed down from
[3032.20 - 3038.36] our family line it's not genetics it's
[3035.12 - 3040.60] bugs passed down toxins passed down too
[3038.36 - 3043.32] toxic heavy metals passed down from
[3040.60 - 3045.68] generation to generation to generation
[3043.32 - 3048.60] or the new generation of people got a
[3045.68 - 3051.20] new exposure all together so the whole
[3048.60 - 3054.72] family the whole family line in that
[3051.20 - 3057.24] generation got that recent exposure if
[3054.72 - 3059.24] someone's not that toxic they're just
[3057.24 - 3061.64] slightly toxic they don't have a lot of
[3059.24 - 3063.24] neurotoxins and dermato toxins they
[3061.64 - 3066.16] don't have a lot of pathogens and
[3063.24 - 3069.00] pathogen waste they haven't been exposed
[3066.16 - 3072.44] to a lot of different chemicals if that
[3069.00 - 3076.32] happens their lymphatic fluid will be
[3072.44 - 3079.24] clear it'll be a clear fluid now if
[3076.32 - 3081.56] someone's really toxic and they've been
[3079.24 - 3084.12] exposed to a lot of pathogens a lot of
[3081.56 - 3086.00] bugs they're fighting a lot of lowgrade
[3084.12 - 3087.52] infections they gotten a lot of
[3086.00 - 3091.36] diagnoses like
[3087.52 - 3093.16] autoimmune then that fluid isn't clear
[3091.36 - 3096.72] science of research says it's clear but
[3093.16 - 3098.84] it's not it's got a yellow tinge to it
[3096.72 - 3101.60] sometimes it could be very yellow
[3098.84 - 3104.28] sometimes it could be pus-like colored
[3101.60 - 3108.04] because if it gets too dirty and the
[3104.28 - 3111.84] lymphatic fluid is too gunked up it will
[3108.04 - 3114.04] be and if the fluid gets too
[3111.84 - 3116.52] then what happens more fluid has to go
[3114.04 - 3118.92] into the lymphatic system Sy to dilute
[3116.52 - 3121.24] all the toxins and poisons and then that
[3118.92 - 3123.64] person's lymphatic system is now blown
[3121.24 - 3126.04] up larger so now someone is retaining
[3123.64 - 3128.08] more fluid lymphatic wise they're
[3126.04 - 3129.88] swelling more and they're more
[3128.08 - 3131.32] uncomfortable and this leads to
[3129.88 - 3132.88] something that a lot of people go
[3131.32 - 3135.40] through all the time which is hot
[3132.88 - 3138.08] weather sensitivities to when it gets
[3135.40 - 3140.64] hot outside or really humid outside so
[3138.08 - 3144.28] summertime comes around it's really hot
[3140.64 - 3146.64] out really humid and the person's really
[3144.28 - 3148.76] uncomfortable they're sitting outside
[3146.64 - 3151.96] and they can't stand it any longer
[3148.76 - 3153.92] because it feels like the swelling is
[3151.96 - 3156.48] enlarging or they feel like they're
[3153.92 - 3158.36] swelling more than someone else and then
[3156.48 - 3162.80] somebody else that doesn't have that
[3158.36 - 3164.24] fluid retention is fine in the Heat and
[3162.80 - 3165.92] they look okay they look like they're
[3164.24 - 3167.96] dealing with it they look happy they're
[3165.92 - 3170.16] doing something maybe an activity and
[3167.96 - 3172.40] then somebody else they're actually
[3170.16 - 3174.44] suffering it's like I can't handle the
[3172.40 - 3177.04] Heat or the humidity I have to stay
[3174.44 - 3181.12] inside it's just just hard on my body I
[3177.04 - 3183.36] feel just like so bloated or swollen
[3181.12 - 3185.48] what determines the difference between
[3183.36 - 3188.28] someone with fluid retention not
[3185.48 - 3190.60] handling the humidity and Heat versus
[3188.28 - 3194.08] somebody else with fluid retention
[3190.60 - 3196.88] handling the humidity and heat is the
[3194.08 - 3199.40] toxic nature of the lymphatic fluid so
[3196.88 - 3201.92] if it has that yellow tinge to it if
[3199.40 - 3205.24] it's dirty fluid if it has a lot of
[3201.92 - 3207.80] toxins and poisons and the color of the
[3205.24 - 3209.44] fluid isn't clear inside the lymphatic
[3207.80 - 3211.32] system then they're going to struggle
[3209.44 - 3213.72] more because when you're in the heat and
[3211.32 - 3216.40] humidity in the Sun and you're highly
[3213.72 - 3219.20] toxic and the fluid retention is highly
[3216.40 - 3221.56] toxic the body reacts differently it
[3219.20 - 3223.72] weighs you down makes you feel more
[3221.56 - 3226.24] swollen makes you feel more
[3223.72 - 3229.08] uncomfortable toxins in the lymphatic
[3226.24 - 3230.84] fluid react to body heat so if you're
[3229.08 - 3233.36] somebody and you're out in the sun
[3230.84 - 3236.64] you're hanging out it's really a hot day
[3233.36 - 3239.60] it's 90° it's humid outside and your
[3236.64 - 3242.60] body temperature starts to raise your
[3239.60 - 3246.08] core temperature starts to raise if your
[3242.60 - 3250.20] lymphatic vessels are filled with toxic
[3246.08 - 3253.12] yellow fluid then as the core
[3250.20 - 3256.48] temperature raises in your body and it's
[3253.12 - 3259.48] hot outside the toxins and poisons
[3256.48 - 3262.44] create additional heat and then more
[3259.48 - 3265.88] expansion occurs from the heat CU it's
[3262.44 - 3268.44] not just the fluid that's Heating up
[3265.88 - 3271.60] it's the toxins inside the fluid that
[3268.44 - 3274.52] are heating up and those toxins start to
[3271.60 - 3276.32] expand and if someone is that toxic they
[3274.52 - 3278.68] usually have toxins everywhere else
[3276.32 - 3281.04] floating around they have toxins
[3278.68 - 3284.80] floating around in their bloodstream and
[3281.04 - 3288.68] in other organs so when the heat happens
[3284.80 - 3292.16] outside the humidity goes up they feel
[3288.68 - 3293.84] not good and then when they go inside
[3292.16 - 3295.96] the house and they're in air
[3293.84 - 3298.92] conditioning they're not feeling great
[3295.96 - 3301.32] that day because they're so toxic the
[3298.92 - 3303.36] heat expanded a lot of the toxins
[3301.32 - 3306.04] throughout the bloodstream and the
[3303.36 - 3308.24] organs and then they feel unwell and
[3306.04 - 3310.44] they feel like they got sun sickness but
[3308.24 - 3314.04] they weren't outside in the sun for a
[3310.44 - 3316.44] long time but yet they feel sick after
[3314.04 - 3319.44] being in the sun that means that if they
[3316.44 - 3321.32] were to go somewhere to a beach or sit
[3319.44 - 3324.20] outside for a long period of time in
[3321.32 - 3326.96] heat and Sun there's a good chance they
[3324.20 - 3329.44] are going to feel very sick a day later
[3326.96 - 3331.76] or that same day or the end of the day
[3329.44 - 3334.56] because they're so toxic and they have
[3331.76 - 3336.52] not only toxins in their lymphatic fluid
[3334.56 - 3338.28] and they have the fluid retention but
[3336.52 - 3340.36] they have toxins floating everywhere
[3338.28 - 3342.20] else inside the body if you're curious
[3340.36 - 3345.16] of what kind of toxins these are it
[3342.20 - 3347.72] could be neurotoxins from low-grade
[3345.16 - 3350.52] viral infections dermat toxins from
[3347.72 - 3352.24] lowgrade viral infections toxins from
[3350.52 - 3354.76] all kinds of different bacteria and
[3352.24 - 3357.00] viruses along with toxic heavy metals
[3354.76 - 3359.28] other chemical toxins all floating
[3357.00 - 3362.48] around so now let's talk about when
[3359.28 - 3365.48] people say I feel best when I don't eat
[3362.48 - 3368.40] hey I stopped eating I don't eat for 21
[3365.48 - 3371.72] hours and then I have a meal I try not
[3368.40 - 3375.48] to eat for 2 days it's kind of hard but
[3371.72 - 3378.08] I do it anyway hey I only eat meat I eat
[3375.48 - 3381.44] beef all day and then I top it off with
[3378.08 - 3384.32] some ghee I won't eat a vegetable hey I
[3381.44 - 3386.16] feel better ever since I quit sugar well
[3384.32 - 3388.68] they didn't quit sugar they quit
[3386.16 - 3392.92] everything not just sugar I feel better
[3388.68 - 3395.28] when I quit sugar um hey I feel better
[3392.92 - 3398.36] just drinking a little bit of water and
[3395.28 - 3400.12] then eating like every other day all
[3398.36 - 3402.64] right so let's explore these when
[3400.12 - 3405.28] someone says I feel better now that I
[3402.64 - 3406.96] quit sugar now when they say that you
[3405.28 - 3410.04] think wait a minute what were they
[3406.96 - 3412.32] eating well they weren't eating sugar
[3410.04 - 3413.96] you know like a box of sugar or a bag of
[3412.32 - 3415.84] sugar in the grocery store where it's
[3413.96 - 3418.80] processed sugar and you're just doing
[3415.84 - 3420.68] tablespoons or sugar cubes right when
[3418.80 - 3422.24] you're a kid and you have a sugar cube
[3420.68 - 3424.32] it wasn't like they were eating a whole
[3422.24 - 3426.52] bunch of sugar cubes all day long what
[3424.32 - 3430.72] they're talking about is processed foods
[3426.52 - 3434.68] like cookies cakes Donuts treats ice
[3430.72 - 3437.36] cream coffees with lots of sugar put in
[3434.68 - 3440.04] and cream or iced coffees with lots of
[3437.36 - 3442.48] sugar and cream baked goods uh
[3440.04 - 3444.92] croissants with powdered sugar on top
[3442.48 - 3446.76] candy bars like really bad candy bar
[3444.92 - 3448.68] bars and then those health food store
[3446.76 - 3450.40] candy bars that are supposedly good
[3448.68 - 3452.84] candy bars that have all that sugar in
[3450.40 - 3455.44] it too either way candy bars and then
[3452.84 - 3458.48] maybe like candies but like gummy bears
[3455.44 - 3460.20] with gelatin in it and all kinds of yes
[3458.48 - 3463.20] a little bit of sugar but natural
[3460.20 - 3465.60] flavors gelatin other additives
[3463.20 - 3468.36] preservatives and when you think about
[3465.60 - 3471.00] it is a candy bar all sugar is a
[3468.36 - 3474.12] croissant all sugar is a cookie all
[3471.00 - 3477.28] sugar is a cake doughnut or ice cream
[3474.12 - 3480.16] all sugar no it's not there's sugar in
[3477.28 - 3483.24] there but there's also all this fat or
[3480.16 - 3486.08] additives or flavorings there's all this
[3483.24 - 3488.84] other junk or some type of grain that's
[3486.08 - 3491.84] not a good grain but yet when the person
[3488.84 - 3494.96] stopped eating all of these they say I
[3491.84 - 3497.68] feel better when I'm not eating sugar um
[3494.96 - 3499.40] you weren't eating sugar yeah you kind
[3497.68 - 3502.28] of were eating a little sugar that was
[3499.40 - 3505.88] in the mix no you are eating milk
[3502.28 - 3508.12] proteins Dairy you're eating all this
[3505.88 - 3510.40] other grain like bad grain you were
[3508.12 - 3512.28] eating gluten you were having lots of
[3510.40 - 3514.68] fat you were eating butter you were
[3512.28 - 3517.16] eating lard you were eating vegetable
[3514.68 - 3521.36] oil you were eating all these other
[3517.16 - 3523.52] things MSG additives red dye number one
[3521.36 - 3525.60] you were eating all of that and when you
[3523.52 - 3527.44] quit all those processed foods those
[3525.60 - 3529.48] cakes cookies donuts and all of that you
[3527.44 - 3532.28] started feeling better but what you tell
[3529.48 - 3534.36] everybody else is I quit sugar and that
[3532.28 - 3536.88] made me feel better so then somebody
[3534.36 - 3539.84] else hears that and they'll go oh I
[3536.88 - 3542.68] better quit fruit because fruit has
[3539.84 - 3544.76] sugar in it so that person said they
[3542.68 - 3547.36] quit sugar and they're feeling better I
[3544.76 - 3549.20] better stop eating my apples meanwhile
[3547.36 - 3551.48] there's all these health professionals
[3549.20 - 3553.68] that say that out there oh quit sugar
[3551.48 - 3556.04] look out for sugar and they just add to
[3553.68 - 3558.48] it they spread a bad message and then
[3556.04 - 3561.52] everybody's confused so what about when
[3558.48 - 3563.28] the person says I only eat meat try that
[3561.52 - 3565.60] that's the best way to do it grasp that
[3563.28 - 3568.00] beef only and then I give myself a treat
[3565.60 - 3570.52] and I have some ghee and then they say
[3568.00 - 3573.00] they're doing so much better well
[3570.52 - 3575.00] they're mono eating what happened was
[3573.00 - 3577.16] they were originally confused about what
[3575.00 - 3578.84] they were eating before all these years
[3577.16 - 3580.84] because they were eating cakes cookies
[3578.84 - 3582.96] donuts growing up they were eating
[3580.84 - 3584.64] cheeseburgers because they like their
[3582.96 - 3587.00] meat but they were eating the whole
[3584.64 - 3588.96] cheeseburger they got rid of the bun so
[3587.00 - 3590.72] now they're grainfree so now they're
[3588.96 - 3593.28] moving out all these other things they
[3590.72 - 3595.40] hear dairy's bad from someone so they
[3593.28 - 3597.92] get rid of the dairy but a lot of people
[3595.40 - 3600.08] who just eat meat do eat dairy too but
[3597.92 - 3603.72] if you get somebody that mono eats only
[3600.08 - 3605.44] meat they're doing the elimination deal
[3603.72 - 3607.64] where they're eliminating all these
[3605.44 - 3610.08] other Foods now when they eliminate
[3607.64 - 3612.60] those other Foods they're eliminating
[3610.08 - 3615.12] things that may have aggravated them and
[3612.60 - 3617.80] they didn't know they were eliminating
[3615.12 - 3619.88] some packaged food that has MSG in it
[3617.80 - 3622.64] but they didn't know the MSG was causing
[3619.88 - 3624.88] the problem or they're eliminating
[3622.64 - 3628.48] gluten right dairy products they're
[3624.88 - 3631.12] eliminating grains but some of those
[3628.48 - 3633.24] grains were actually okay but they never
[3631.12 - 3636.28] tried it where they only did Mill it
[3633.24 - 3638.96] only so they decided to stay with the
[3636.28 - 3641.32] fat which is the meat they were on a
[3638.96 - 3643.64] high-fat diet All These Years anyway and
[3641.32 - 3645.88] in the end when they decided to Mono eat
[3643.64 - 3647.84] to try to do the food elimination they
[3645.88 - 3649.48] kept with the fats and they kept with
[3647.84 - 3652.04] the thing that they've been taught the
[3649.48 - 3654.80] most as far as what the body needs high
[3652.04 - 3657.52] protein high fat so they kept with the
[3654.80 - 3660.24] meat but they got some results for a
[3657.52 - 3662.92] little while mono eating can give you
[3660.24 - 3665.72] results even when it's something not
[3662.92 - 3668.00] great eventually all the fat from the
[3665.72 - 3670.52] meat catches up to them because now
[3668.00 - 3673.20] they're on just a meat diet meat diet
[3670.52 - 3676.08] only and that catches up because they
[3673.20 - 3678.48] need calories they need some type of
[3676.08 - 3679.96] fuel and you can't get that from a piece
[3678.48 - 3681.76] of meat because there's not enough
[3679.96 - 3683.88] glucose in that piece of meat there's
[3681.76 - 3686.56] only a little bit so then they start
[3683.88 - 3689.12] hitting the wall after about 3 months
[3686.56 - 3690.68] and they decide to bring in more meat so
[3689.12 - 3692.48] they're eating more of it now they're
[3690.68 - 3694.28] getting bloated they can't go to
[3692.48 - 3696.68] bathroom good they're feeling kind of
[3694.28 - 3698.72] sick they have no vegetables or leafy
[3696.68 - 3702.20] greens in their diet and now they hit a
[3698.72 - 3703.40] wall now they don't eat at all and
[3702.20 - 3706.04] they're doing this thing where they
[3703.40 - 3708.16] don't mono eat all day they take a day
[3706.04 - 3710.80] off the next day they fill themselves up
[3708.16 - 3713.32] with meat and they mono eat the meat
[3710.80 - 3715.68] next day they don't eat and now they're
[3713.32 - 3718.20] every other day and they're losing their
[3715.68 - 3719.88] strength and losing their energy then
[3718.20 - 3721.84] they find that they have to eat every
[3719.88 - 3723.64] day to some degree so they do the
[3721.84 - 3726.36] intermittent fasting but they only use
[3723.64 - 3728.60] their meat they don't eat all day and
[3726.36 - 3731.20] they have a whole bunch of meat at night
[3728.60 - 3733.40] one meal a day eventually that doesn't
[3731.20 - 3735.80] work anymore either that it's back to
[3733.40 - 3738.64] the old drawing board which means a
[3735.80 - 3740.32] binge eventually happens of other Foods
[3738.64 - 3741.96] they're with a friend somewhere they're
[3740.32 - 3743.44] out getting something to eat they're not
[3741.96 - 3745.28] sticking to their diet in that moment
[3743.44 - 3747.48] and they just lose it and they eat about
[3745.28 - 3748.92] five slices of pizza and on their way
[3747.48 - 3750.72] home they're like I'm going to get right
[3748.92 - 3752.60] back to the drawing board I'm going to
[3750.72 - 3754.44] get right back to eating my mono meat
[3752.60 - 3755.72] that's when I felt the best I remember
[3754.44 - 3758.36] and they're just stuck in the Vicious
[3755.72 - 3760.24] Cycle all over again this is just one
[3758.36 - 3762.28] example of trying to hack your bloating
[3760.24 - 3764.32] and your swelling and your digestive
[3762.28 - 3767.04] discomfort there's hundreds and hundreds
[3764.32 - 3770.16] and hundreds examples and what they are
[3767.04 - 3772.96] it's about people coming from a high fat
[3770.16 - 3774.68] high protein diet right with some
[3772.96 - 3776.60] goodies thrown in the mix too that
[3774.68 - 3778.60] aren't good some processed foods and
[3776.60 - 3780.88] they're in that realm and they have to
[3778.60 - 3783.52] crawl out of that realm and so when they
[3780.88 - 3785.88] do they do different approaches one
[3783.52 - 3787.76] person might do a keto diet that works
[3785.88 - 3790.08] for a little while then they have to
[3787.76 - 3792.28] intermit and fast and do keto another
[3790.08 - 3794.76] person might just do the carnivore
[3792.28 - 3796.72] another person might do a vegan version
[3794.76 - 3798.48] or a plant-based version it's all nut
[3796.72 - 3800.04] Butters and nut Butters and stuff like
[3798.48 - 3801.68] that at the end of the day and then
[3800.04 - 3803.48] eventually they have to stop eating for
[3801.68 - 3805.64] a day because they just get so sick
[3803.48 - 3808.08] they're still doing the high fat diet
[3805.64 - 3810.28] high protein diet and they don't realize
[3808.08 - 3812.16] they're just stuck so everybody then
[3810.28 - 3814.08] plays these guessing games like well I'm
[3812.16 - 3816.08] not swelling that much today I better
[3814.08 - 3818.28] not eat again this is working for me for
[3816.08 - 3820.12] a minute let me do this green juice too
[3818.28 - 3822.36] oh let me try this and they're just all
[3820.12 - 3824.24] over the place each day is different
[3822.36 - 3826.00] each month is different there's hundreds
[3824.24 - 3828.56] of variations but they all have
[3826.00 - 3831.48] something in common they all come from a
[3828.56 - 3834.60] high fat high protein diet vegan or
[3831.48 - 3837.24] animal protein they also have something
[3834.60 - 3840.80] else in common they all have something
[3837.24 - 3843.84] wrong with their health so why do they
[3840.80 - 3846.60] feel better when someone says well I
[3843.84 - 3848.28] just don't eat and I feel better that
[3846.60 - 3850.36] way another person will be like I'm best
[3848.28 - 3853.00] when I'm fasted another person is like
[3850.36 - 3855.04] I'm better at one meal a day my swelling
[3853.00 - 3857.84] goes down yeah when I don't eat that
[3855.04 - 3860.08] much my swelling goes down why is that
[3857.84 - 3863.12] happening how come their swelling goes
[3860.08 - 3866.04] down when they stop eating for a while
[3863.12 - 3869.40] because they stopped burdening they're
[3866.04 - 3872.52] already overburdened liver and they
[3869.40 - 3875.04] stopped burdening they're already over
[3872.52 - 3878.24] burdened lymphatic system they stopped
[3875.04 - 3880.56] eating they started cleansing they gave
[3878.24 - 3883.36] their liver a break from all the fat
[3880.56 - 3886.40] they eat and this is why the swelling
[3883.36 - 3889.08] starts to go down what's interesting is
[3886.40 - 3891.40] all these people stopping their eating
[3889.08 - 3894.72] and their swelling goes down they're all
[3891.40 - 3898.00] eating different diets all of them like
[3894.72 - 3901.24] some are vegans some are plant-based
[3898.00 - 3902.04] some are keto animal protein some are
[3901.24 - 3903.96] just
[3902.04 - 3905.84] carnivore it's a whole bunch of
[3903.96 - 3908.28] different people some are just processed
[3905.84 - 3911.60] foods just all they do is eat fast food
[3908.28 - 3913.20] and processed food but either way it's
[3911.60 - 3915.28] all these different diets no one's
[3913.20 - 3918.12] eating the same diet but when they all
[3915.28 - 3920.00] stop they're all like I feel better I'm
[3918.12 - 3922.00] getting the swelling down I feel a
[3920.00 - 3924.16] little better because they all got that
[3922.00 - 3928.32] other thing in common they're all eating
[3924.16 - 3932.16] all this fat so it's all this fat lard
[3928.32 - 3934.80] butter oil nut Butters avocado processed
[3932.16 - 3936.92] oils it's all that fat that's the thing
[3934.80 - 3938.36] that they got in common yeah they got
[3936.92 - 3940.24] different diets they all do it a
[3938.36 - 3942.32] different way one person eats eggs in
[3940.24 - 3944.48] the morning another person has eggs in
[3942.32 - 3946.84] their salad in the afternoon another
[3944.48 - 3948.88] person has eggs for dinner but they're
[3946.84 - 3951.00] all doing the eggs oh and if they don't
[3948.88 - 3952.72] do eggs then they're doing cheese if
[3951.00 - 3955.04] they don't do cheese then they're doing
[3952.72 - 3957.24] nuts either way they're all doing the
[3955.04 - 3959.08] fat and the high fat it's burdening the
[3957.24 - 3961.08] liver and that's what's in common on
[3959.08 - 3964.20] that part now someone could only be
[3961.08 - 3967.20] doing greasy fried fatty foods like
[3964.20 - 3969.76] processed foods right from a diner
[3967.20 - 3973.20] processed foods right from a fast food
[3969.76 - 3975.52] takeout and they'll get the same results
[3973.20 - 3978.04] when they stop eating as someone else
[3975.52 - 3980.68] does when they eat a vegan diet filled
[3978.04 - 3982.32] with nut Butters they all stop eating
[3980.68 - 3984.24] their swelling goes down they're all
[3982.32 - 3987.56] getting the same results even though
[3984.24 - 3990.28] diets are vastly apart if we never feel
[3987.56 - 3992.64] good when we're eating it can cause a
[3990.28 - 3994.96] lot of confusion let's just face it
[3992.64 - 3996.88] that's why when some Guru out there like
[3994.96 - 3999.24] somebody in health that seems like they
[3996.88 - 4001.88] got it all together they say well I
[3999.24 - 4003.64] don't eat food's not important I eat
[4001.88 - 4006.36] when I feel like it I can go days
[4003.64 - 4011.00] without eating everybody goes
[4006.36 - 4013.64] ooh that's the answer that's the Panacea
[4011.00 - 4016.32] it's this Guru guy sits on a Mountaintop
[4013.64 - 4018.84] and he meditates and he goes to all the
[4016.32 - 4020.84] Retreats and everybody knows who he is
[4018.84 - 4023.56] and he says he doesn't need to eat he's
[4020.84 - 4026.96] like a lizard you just need one meal a
[4023.56 - 4029.28] week and this guy's got it all down and
[4026.96 - 4031.80] I feel sick when I eat and I try every
[4029.28 - 4034.76] healthy diet there ever was every trendy
[4031.80 - 4037.00] diet and I just can't eat but this guy
[4034.76 - 4039.36] this guy here this Guru he's got it all
[4037.00 - 4041.72] down he just doesn't need to eat that's
[4039.36 - 4044.04] what I have to gravitate to like that's
[4041.72 - 4046.64] the mission and you'll see the
[4044.04 - 4049.72] consistencies out there people who are
[4046.64 - 4051.04] into Health they're doing a certain diet
[4049.72 - 4054.20] they get a whole bunch of people on
[4051.04 - 4056.88] board everybody's watching them 6 months
[4054.20 - 4059.44] later they alter their diet it's not
[4056.88 - 4061.36] working but who cares about the six
[4059.44 - 4063.92] months of people that watched them and
[4061.36 - 4066.76] tried it too like who cares about them
[4063.92 - 4068.80] all messing up or being in the dark or
[4066.76 - 4071.76] not knowing where to go and being lost
[4068.80 - 4074.16] switch gears so now that same influencer
[4071.76 - 4076.56] or health professional or Guru is is now
[4074.16 - 4078.72] doing a different take a different diet
[4076.56 - 4081.64] so now it's a whole 6 months more of all
[4078.72 - 4083.64] that watch me now watch me now here's my
[4081.64 - 4086.16] morning routine here's what I do during
[4083.64 - 4087.64] the day I'm on this new thing ofama jig
[4086.16 - 4089.80] I'm taking this and then everybody
[4087.64 - 4091.96] follows along and they're all following
[4089.80 - 4093.76] along and it gets all messed up again
[4091.96 - 4095.60] and then they shift gears again but it
[4093.76 - 4097.56] happens over and over again you could
[4095.60 - 4099.68] watch it sometimes it's just years and
[4097.56 - 4101.84] years if they've been in it long enough
[4099.68 - 4104.52] if somebody has been doing this for 5
[4101.84 - 4107.20] years it's 5 years of mistake akes and
[4104.52 - 4109.96] different directions and who pays for it
[4107.20 - 4112.24] the people that watched and got invested
[4109.96 - 4114.36] and they put their health at risk they
[4112.24 - 4116.80] invested into what the person was doing
[4114.36 - 4118.80] they lost 6 months or they lost another
[4116.80 - 4120.92] year another year of what they could
[4118.80 - 4122.88] have done for their health and the
[4120.92 - 4124.72] reason why it went downhill was because
[4122.88 - 4126.04] of the consistency what the health
[4124.72 - 4128.92] professional they were watching was
[4126.04 - 4132.52] doing was being inconsistent it's every
[4128.92 - 4136.20] change every 4 months 6 months or every
[4132.52 - 4138.84] year and that in consistency was proof
[4136.20 - 4140.16] that the professional or the influencer
[4138.84 - 4142.88] didn't know what they were doing to
[4140.16 - 4146.00] begin with it was all hacks and
[4142.88 - 4148.48] makeshift bait and switch it was all try
[4146.00 - 4151.52] this get quick results instant
[4148.48 - 4152.64] gratification oh doesn't work sorry guys
[4151.52 - 4155.00] didn't mean to put you through that in
[4152.64 - 4156.52] the last 6 months let's start again but
[4155.00 - 4159.28] yet they really don't say sorry to
[4156.52 - 4161.52] anybody they just go quiet for a while
[4159.28 - 4163.28] reinvent themselves or act like it never
[4161.52 - 4164.40] even happened and then you get new
[4163.28 - 4166.80] followers
[4164.40 - 4169.96] and the old ones just dissipate and fall
[4166.80 - 4172.16] away so if we're at the point in
[4169.96 - 4175.64] Everybody's Health and where we are
[4172.16 - 4178.56] today that we all have to just stop
[4175.64 - 4180.60] eating and that's the only way out and
[4178.56 - 4183.04] that's the only fix then something's
[4180.60 - 4185.40] terribly wrong because if we're not
[4183.04 - 4188.04] eating and we're just starving ourselves
[4185.40 - 4190.12] all day long or only eating one meal a
[4188.04 - 4193.28] day then we're not getting the things we
[4190.12 - 4195.72] need for our brain our liver our heart
[4193.28 - 4198.12] the rest of our body systems our nervous
[4195.72 - 4200.44] system we're not giving all these
[4198.12 - 4204.40] different body systems what they need
[4200.44 - 4207.08] we're just skating by playing around we
[4204.40 - 4210.60] need to actually fix problems like
[4207.08 - 4213.72] really fix problems core problems we
[4210.60 - 4216.48] need to fix our sick livers we need to
[4213.72 - 4219.64] get them cleansed and healed we need to
[4216.48 - 4222.40] get them restored stagnant sluggish
[4219.64 - 4225.80] overburdened livers we need to protect
[4222.40 - 4228.36] our nervous system get it fed give our
[4225.80 - 4230.72] nervous system the feedings it actually
[4228.36 - 4233.44] needs we have to make sure that there's
[4230.72 - 4236.60] ample glucose in our bloodstream enough
[4233.44 - 4239.68] glucose to feed our organs our brain
[4236.60 - 4242.16] starts to die in 5 seconds if it doesn't
[4239.68 - 4244.52] get sugar so we have to make sure we
[4242.16 - 4247.00] have enough glucose so the brain can
[4244.52 - 4250.00] receive that Sugar our heart also needs
[4247.00 - 4253.24] glucose too our heart's a muscle our
[4250.00 - 4256.36] heart can thin out the walls can weaken
[4253.24 - 4257.56] in the heart the muscle walls can weaken
[4256.36 - 4260.08] we have to make sure there's enough
[4257.56 - 4262.36] glucose getting to the heart our brain
[4260.08 - 4265.24] also needs electrolytes Trace mineral
[4262.36 - 4267.44] salts phytochemical compounds
[4265.24 - 4270.00] antioxidants our immune system needs to
[4267.44 - 4272.24] be fed too it needs the zinc it needs
[4270.00 - 4274.48] the minerals it needs the trace minerals
[4272.24 - 4277.88] to keep it strong it needs glucose as
[4274.48 - 4280.24] well our liver needs glucose too it
[4277.88 - 4282.72] needs strength to actually cleanse and
[4280.24 - 4285.36] detox the liver has its own immune
[4282.72 - 4288.00] system the immune cells inside the liver
[4285.36 - 4290.64] also need to be fed too phytochemical
[4288.00 - 4292.84] compounds from Foods antiviral compounds
[4290.64 - 4295.56] from Foods getting into these immune
[4292.84 - 4299.24] cells making them stronger we can't just
[4295.56 - 4301.36] run on our own adrenaline all day long
[4299.24 - 4303.44] because we're keeping food from our
[4301.36 - 4306.12] stomachs we're keeping food from our
[4303.44 - 4308.24] body we can't just run on adrenaline and
[4306.12 - 4310.48] caffeine all day long because we're
[4308.24 - 4312.72] trying to stay on a caffeine high and
[4310.48 - 4314.64] we're withholding food but using
[4312.72 - 4316.60] caffeine as a diet diuretic to try to
[4314.64 - 4318.24] keep the swelling down we just can't
[4316.60 - 4321.52] walk around with our blood sugar low
[4318.24 - 4324.04] either bumping into walls passing out
[4321.52 - 4326.00] fainting a lot of people faint it's a
[4324.04 - 4328.32] big thing right now they're withholding

[4438.96 - 4446.32] easy when we don't feel at ease we feel
[4442.68 - 4450.80] sluggish inside our body doesn't feel
[4446.32 - 4454.80] that peace our confidence in ourselves
[4450.80 - 4458.44] minimizes as our swelling over time
[4454.80 - 4462.28] maximizes and we want to jump out of our
[4458.44 - 4466.68] skin as the pressure inside of us
[4462.28 - 4470.72] swells some have it so bad feels like a
[4466.68 - 4474.88] sin they never feel level and never feel

[4478.52 - 4485.68] when we're down and out are lacking not
[4481.56 - 4487.96] eating at all has all the backing it's
[4485.68 - 4491.72] understandable to withhold the food we
[4487.96 - 4494.92] love when your stomach extends you wish
[4491.72 - 4498.52] the problem would end and the next day
[4494.92 - 4502.16] begins the problem's not solved there's
[4498.52 - 4504.92] so much more to who we are there's no
[4502.16 - 4508.08] way we need to be under this long
[4504.92 - 4513.04] uncomfortable spell it doesn't have to
[4508.08 - 4517.36] be this way over time it can be resolved
[4513.04 - 4521.16] internally inside of us inside our veins
[4517.36 - 4524.16] we have fortitude we have a light we
[4521.16 - 4528.64] have a universal connection to up and
[4524.16 - 4532.00] Beyond we have a deep healing well what
[4528.64 - 4535.52] we truly go through only God really
[4532.00 - 4538.92] knows our heart is pumping our
[4535.52 - 4542.04] bloodstream is running the blood and
[4538.92 - 4544.68] fluid is living proof that our
[4542.04 - 4548.36] unrelenting spiritual and physical
[4544.68 - 4550.96] strength will prevail and overcome we
[4548.36 - 4554.52] don't have to fear our food we don't
[4550.96 - 4558.16] have to be scared of a food
[4554.52 - 4562.32] run it's not our fault we should be
[4558.16 - 4565.88] allowed to eat what we want but
[4562.32 - 4569.68] instead all of a sudden the carpet is
[4565.88 - 4573.32] pulled out from under us and we go down
