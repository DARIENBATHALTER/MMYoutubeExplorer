41
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,720
janet it was it was powerful did you try

42
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,600
that hi you guys

43
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,960
hi michelle um it you know it's really

44
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,960
one of these things where

45
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:27,360
i had to make sure that you guys

46
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,040
have this tool because here's what goes

47
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,759
on when we go through losses

48
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,240
betrayals broken hearts broken

49
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:37,439
friendships broken relationships

50
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:40,479
dorina you fell asleep while listening

51
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,479
so and um

52
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,560
alexandra hi anthony i did the brain

53
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,040
meditation twice today

54
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,159
oh my god incredible i felt nauseous the

55
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,720
first time why

56
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,079
the second i fell asleep afterwards that

57
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,799
was a release

58
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,840
so that's what that was when fear leaves

59
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,600
us

60
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,280
it it it what happens is that nausea

61
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,040
that's the vagus nerve the vagus nerve

62
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,840
is attached to the emotional center of

63
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,119
your brain

64
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,599
the emotional center of your brain is

65
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,560
is holding on to all this fear even if

66
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,040
you don't know

67
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,000
it's holding on to this fear from maybe

68
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,879
a relationship

69
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,160
uh breakup that happened years ago or

70
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,720
confrontation

71
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,959
or a loss or a heartache or broken trust

72
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,120
or a friendship of some kind that may

73
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,000
not any kind of hurt or wounds or maybe

74
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,120
a great loss

75
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,840
and what happens is that fear sits

76
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,040
inside

77
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:35,920
of us and it it creates a gap

78
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,959
between the soul and our physical brain

79
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,200
so

80
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,319
when that fear leaves and it's leaving

81
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,160
that's why it's important to do the

82
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,480
brain meditation more than once

83
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,440
do it twice or do three times alexandra

84
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,360
i'm really

85
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,480
happy that you did it more than once

86
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,640
because

87
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,400
then it's only gets better because

88
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,920
you're releasing that much fear and that

89
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,480
much fear and then

90
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,920
the bridge comes together the bridge

91
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,560
actually comes together between your

92
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,560
soul

93
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,000
and your physical brain the emotional

94
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,519
center of your physical brain and this

95
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,840
bridge comes together

96
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,560
and it starts to close the gap because

97
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,560
that gap

98
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,599
was filled with fear as we go through

99
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,480
hardships that gap

100
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,599
opens and opens and opens and it gets

101
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,120
filled with fear

102
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:19,519
and so this powerful brain meditation

103
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,560
releases that fear so the gap gets

104
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,120
filled so

105
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,799
so your soul comes back to the emotional

106
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,840
center of the brain so it starts to

107
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,440
reconnect again

108
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,120
because then we get depersonalization

109
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,920
when fear is sitting in there

110
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,799
we get mild bouts of depression we get

111
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,879
mild

112
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,400
mild issues anxiety all kinds of

113
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,959
different things that happen along the

114
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,519
way

115
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,959
we can't trust anymore so the brain

116
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,959
meditation

117
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,560
is a way to get rid of that fear so that

118
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,599
the soul can come back and

119
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,879
heal and that connection can be made and

120
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,560
it's really powerful

121
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,000
really really powerful and you can fall

122
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,319
asleep during it

123
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,159
which is incredible because it's still

124
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,400
going to have an effect it's still going

125
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:01,920
to work you can do the brain meditation

emotional center of your brain as you're

are going to cry

190
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,800
and because it's that healing from a

191
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,919
deep level so he cried during the entire

192
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,960
meditation

193
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:08,479
and felt a deep loss i felt before thank

194
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,800
you for sharing anthony

195
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,960
if you can you do the meditation again

196
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,880
and you do it again and you make sure

197
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,240
any kind of fear that happened during

198
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,600
that deep loss keeps on

199
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,319
leaving so it works more and more jody

200
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,479
said

201
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,360
did brain meditation today extremely

202
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,759
emotional

203
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,960
lots of tears but felt like some weight

204
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,600
was lifted

205
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,400
we'll be doing this every day jody a

206
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,360
weight was

207
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:36,000
lifted that was trapped fear that

208
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,000
creates this divide between the soul

209
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,039
and your physical brain and body how

210
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,120
does this happen

211
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,639
when you get when things happen to you

212
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,960
in your life trauma or

213
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,240
loss or any kind of ptsd that you've

214
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,400
been suffering with or any kind of

215
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,120
emotional blow that you've ever had

216
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,800
what happens the soul comes out of body

217
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,120
a little bit that's what happens to us

218
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,280
like

219
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,960
you get this news like oh my god what

220
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,479
just happened i just got hurt

221
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,000
i just got hurt emotionally i got a

222
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,840
broken heart now and

223
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,680
you have this out of body experience for

224
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,919
a moment and when that happens

225
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,280
fear fills the gap and but the fear

226
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,199
doesn't go away

227
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,880
it stays there and minute there's other

228
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,800
meditations don't rid that fear

229
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,120
it won't go anywhere this is actually

230
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,000
designed to pull that fear out

231
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,520
so the soul comes together with the

232
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,280
physical part of your body

233
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,720
and it fills that gap and then that

234
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:26,960
weight is lifted

235
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:30,560
that weight is lifted it's so important

236
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:33,039

00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,440
it's the brain meditation

250
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,240
okay and it's at uh it's medical medium

251
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,759
podcast at

252
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,000
apple podcast and it's the brain

253
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,759
meditation it's the third episode

254
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
now i want to give you a forewarning

255
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,960
okay the first episode chemtrails

256
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,800
is a really scary episode okay and it's

257
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,440
shocking okay so i'm just letting you

258
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:18,160
know this is an uncensored podcast

259
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,440
and in the sense where the the

260
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,199
information is so

261
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,199
powerful and no one's ever heard about

262
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,160
it before and it could be shocking the

263
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,479
information

264
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,759
that kind of uncensored and then there's

265
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,520
the fruit fear episode

266
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,919
and then there's the brain meditation

267
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,839
episode and the details are

268
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,599
in these episodes meaning like when you

269
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,959
hear the chemtrail episode the details

270
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,320
just mind-blowing

271
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,640
because someone might heard of

272
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,360
chemtrails but they really haven't heard

273
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,279
anything

274
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,040
about what was really going on because

275
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,320
that information doesn't exist besides

276
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,080
the medical medium information so when

277
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,880
you hear it it's like oh my god it's

278
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,399
mind-blowing

279
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,080
and you'll connect all the dots when you

280
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,200
hear all the details and then the fruit

281
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,080
fear episode

282
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,360
very groundbreaking and and and in the

283
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,760
shocker too and then

284
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,040
the brain meditation episode is the

285
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,360
third episode

286
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,040
okay powerful meditation that i've had

287
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,800
family and friends do

288
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,320
all through these years like 35 plus

289
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,920
years when spirit of compassion

290
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,080
gave me this meditation now the

291
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,000
meditations medical medium are not

292
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,000
man-made it's not like a guy's idea and

293
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,399
then he got it from this guy's idea and

294
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,640
then

295
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,399
they kind of blended their ideas and now

296
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,680
it became popular down the road and

297
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,000
someone's trying to meditate with this

298
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,680
idea

299
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,080
this is from above so this is not

300
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:29,120
man-made so because it's not man-made

301
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:32,080
it's super powerful and it does the job

302
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,519
and that's the key it does the job so if

303
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,040
the spirit of compassion tells me this

304
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,880
reds fear

305
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,800
it's going to rid fear and it does and

306
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,120
it has i've used it for friends and

307
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,279
family that were suffering from ptsd

308
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,040
for many many years and i've used this

309
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:48,560
to rid that to rid the fear

310
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:51,200
from trauma and loss and it's really

311
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,399
really powerful but it's emotional too

312
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,839
you may cry

313
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,519
as you're ridding that it could feel

314
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,839
like a weight's been lifted off of you

315
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,760
which

316
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,120
exactly which happens there's just so

it's really really powerful so what this

363
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,000
does what the brain meditation does

364
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,959
okay with which nothing else like this

365
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,440
does this

366
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,880
is it reconnects your soul to your

367
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,480
physical body because when you get

368
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:44,560
delivered

369
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:46,720
uh jarring news like a loss or

370
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,160
maybe somebody cheated on you or a

371
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,720
friendship didn't work out and you've

372
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,000
been really

373
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,839
hurt or you lost a loved one or you had

374
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,560
a bad experience or a bad emotional

375
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,639
experience

376
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,600
well we have this fear that builds up

377
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,240
between our soul

378
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,320
and our physical brain and the soul

379
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,320
every time we get delivered bad news

380
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,839
we have this out of body shock and our

381
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,040
soul just gets shocked and it gets out

382
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,240
of body for a second it's like a

383
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,519
protection method

384
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,200
but it never realigns back again because

385
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,360
fear fills in the gap

386
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,839
old wounds old emotional wounds from

387
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,160
that fear gets filled into the gap

388
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,760
what this exercise does what this brain

389
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:25,440
meditation does

390
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:28,480
is it pulls the fear out of the middle

391
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,720
so that your soul can come close and

392
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,320
reconnect with your physical brain your

393
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,959
neurons in the emotional center of your

394
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,880
brain

395
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,480
up here so in the emotional center of

396
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,120
the brain so it's critical

397
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,320
and then what happens then is you have

398
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,560
this weight lifted off

399
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,760
you start healing you may cry during

400
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,720
this and

401
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,000
you everything starts to just improve

402
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,639
emotionally

403
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,200
mentally clarity the healing that can

404
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,240
happen

405
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,160
and if you're somebody that has a

406
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,920
difficult falling sleep try this as a

407
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,519
sleep meditation too because

408
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,200
or just even if you don't have a

409
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,079
difficulty falling asleep use it as a

410
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,000
sleep meditation

411
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:05,040
every single night so that when you fall

412
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,600
asleep and the meditation is going

413
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,279

this happens for you um

469
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,079
haley says does it work if you are angry

470
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,320
yes because the anger

471
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:06,000
what happens with anger is that anger

472
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,800
usually starts because we get fearful

473
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,279
and fearful

474
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,480
and fear is trapped in us and it's

475
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,000
trapped between our soul and our

476
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,920
emotional brain so our physical

477
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,360
emotional brain so we get we get this

478
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,639
fear that's trapped in us and that can

479
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,199
easily trigger off fear

480
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,839
and anger too in so many ways deep

481
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,560
seated

482
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:24,399
and it's incredible for that to help rid

483
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,240
that if you feel anger coming on

484
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,720

485
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,399

497
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,680
advertisements

498
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,360
you're not going to have an infomercial

499
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,920
in the middle of this podcast you're not

500
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,240
going to have

501
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,480
advertisements before it there's none of

502
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,600
that it's a free resource please share

503
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,040
it for everybody

504
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:03,040
to everybody and um and and so the brain

505
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,519
meditation is that powerful okay

506
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,360
the reason why it's on apple podcast is

507
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,360
because the official platform

508
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,279
i chose was apple podcast because i can

509
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,600
trust that it's uncensored

510
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:15,360
and other platforms if you think if you

511
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,839
think you heard one of my old radio

512
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,920
shows

513
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,759
that you listen to on other platforms

514
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,680
i'm going to tell you right now

515
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,040
i've always been censored on all of

516
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,519
those so

517
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,360
um and so what happens with this it's

518
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,040
not it's uncensored so even if it looks

519
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,040
like the same minutes that

520
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,480
you see on another platform and you want

521
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,839
to measure it and be like well it

522
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,920
doesn't look like it looks the same

523
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,279
it's not it's not little pieces

524
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,480
fragments are missing

525
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,959
that's how it's done it's just

526
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:44,000
unbelievable really

527
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,320
so but um but so much healing can be

528
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,920
done

529
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,000
when you do the sprain meditation i

530
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,399
recommend doing it every single night so

531
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,240
you can heal while falling asleep

532
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,320

it's i'm sorry that you've even gone

587
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,480
through that and you experienced that

588
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:40,720
and i'm really sorry about that

589
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,160
and because no one should have to go

590
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,760
through these experiences and these

591
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,679
traumatic experiences

592
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,799
and what happens is when you get that

593
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,039
shock i mean

594
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,480

595
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,320

you something you don't know michelle

597
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:57,280
and when you go through that shock it

598
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:59,600
just knocks the soul right out of you

599
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,720
and just knocks it right out of you and

600
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,799
it just hovers

601
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,760
the outer body when you get that trauma

602
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,520
when you get that

603
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,840
news when you get that experience it

604
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:11,280
just knocks it out of you like this

605
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,880
and it's so hard it's so hard and so um

606
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,640
to bring that back and make that

607
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,799
connection to get

608
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,480

609
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,760

censored yes it is

624
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,840
yep exactly and the other platforms that

625
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,080
my old radio show was on a censored and

626
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,919
if you listen if you find this podcast

627
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,200
on other platforms if you find this

628
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,559
medical media podcast

629
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,080
with the brain meditation and everything

630
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,039
else on other platforms and the

631
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,360
chemtrails

632
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:04,480
and the fruit fear it's i can't

633
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,480
guarantee it's

634
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,600
not censored so that's why apple podcast

635
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,720
is the is the choice

636
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:14,720
that i chose um

637
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:17,760
so and i'm just reading some i'm reading

638
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,760
some comments here

639
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,919
and what you're going to feel you you

640
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,080
might cry so many people cry during this

641
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:28,480
brain meditation

642
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,480
so that can happen right there um

643
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,120
i'm reading comments right now on the

644
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,640
monitor so it takes a second you guys

645
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,799
thanks for hanging in there with me

646
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,760
and i want to talk about what happens

647
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,280
like i said

648
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,440
with that connection so the brain

649
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:44,240
meditation

650
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,400
brings the strengthens the bridge and

651
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,960
gets rid of the gaps in the bridge

652
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,360
that's what it is the brain meditation

653
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,679
gets rid of the gaps in the bridge

654
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,760
so the soul and the physical brain can

655
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:59,039
come together and the fear leaves

656
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:01,679
it's critical to mend the wounds

657
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:03,600
in the bridge that's happening there

658
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,720
it's critical to mend those wounds

659
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,240
and the brain meditation is the only is

660
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,120
the only powerful tool

661
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,320
i've ever seen out there from that from

662
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,080
my source or any

663
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,000
source that does this so that you can

664
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,280
have that healing and if you do it every

665
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
night what it can do is just

666
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,919

00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,799
it is so

754
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,720
it works there's a question right there

755
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:20,320
elsie says asks

756
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,960
does it work if you fall asleep while

757
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:26,159
it's happening i mean elise

758
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,919
sorry yeah elise yes it works

759
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,360
while you while you fall asleep or if

760
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:30,240
you fall asleep while it's happening the

761
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,720
reason why

762
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,919
is is your subconscious brain your

763
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,880
subconscious mind

764
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:38,159
is actually hearing the entire episode

765
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,960
when you're sleeping

766
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,159
so and i'm doing the work for you that's

767
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,640
the difference

768
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,159
so i'm doing the work for you so you

769
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:49,360
have every opportunity

770
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:51,840
to heal and you do the exercise with me

771
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,120
but if you fall asleep that's fine too

772
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,559
because i'm still

773
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,559
doing that i'm still talking to the

774
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,360
subconscious mind through the episode

775
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:00,080
through

776
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,400
that powerful brain meditation and so

777
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,640
that

778
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,440
you can still have that healing process

779
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,400
occur

780
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,480
that's how it's that's how it's created

781
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,480
so that you can use this also as a sleep

782
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,480
meditation every single night

783
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,919
and heal because a lot of people don't

784
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,039
even have the time during the day or

785
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:15,440
they don't have the time in the morning

786
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:17,360
to do

787
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:20,400
you just do it before bed and you can

788
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,400
fall asleep with it

789
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,039
wyla green said hello anthony the brain

790
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,679
meditation was incredible cried after

791
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:28,159
then

792
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,039
fell into a deep sleep what's amazing

793
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,600
about while

794
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:33,279
is that when you fall asleep after the

795
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,039
brain meditation

796
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,720
the the the amount of healing that

797
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:38,559
occurs even before that

798
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,919
and then you fall asleep and you're you

799
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:42,720
have the peace

800
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,919
without the fear and the fear goes away

801
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,679
so important so

802
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,120
you guys i'm so glad that we had a

803
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:50,080
chance to be on tonight

804
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,120
um this is incredible i'm so glad we're

805
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,039
on today

806
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,159
and so i just want to give you just a

807
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,679
recap real quick

808
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,520
it's about healing the soul it's about

809
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,400
bridging the gap between the soul and

810
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,559
the physical brain

811
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,760
the brain meditation does this because

812
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,679
when we have trauma

813
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:06,080
we get out of body experiences fear

814
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:08,400
fills the gap the bridge gets

815
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,600
beaten down it gets broken down it gets

816
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,039
chewed up

817
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:14,559
and frazzled and this disconnect happens

818
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,679
but we still live our lives

819
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:17,679
but we still live our lives the

820
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,240
disconnect happens and so forth and so

821
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,559
forth

822
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,240
so really important to know that when

823
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:23,440
you rid this fear and you do this brain

824
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,720
meditation

825
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:29,039
and the soul starts to come back

826
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,279
and connect and there's nothing in there

827
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:32,960
anymore between the fear and all the

828
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,480
chaos and that goes away

829
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,919
then you can make this connection each

830
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,760
time and make it stronger and get rid of

831
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,960
that fear and do so much powerful

832
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,799
incredible healing

833
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,480
