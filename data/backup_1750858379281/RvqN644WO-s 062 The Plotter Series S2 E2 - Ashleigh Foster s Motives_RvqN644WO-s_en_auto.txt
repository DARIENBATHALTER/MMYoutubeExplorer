[50.56 - 55.56] about medical medium information to
[52.60 - 58.52] Major media outlets in hopes that it
[55.56 - 61.36] would lead to securing themselves a deal
[58.52 - 64.52] for an anti-ed medium documentary on
[61.36 - 68.48] Netflix that would bring Fame and other
[64.52 - 70.64] benefits to them now known infamously

[112.88 - 118.36] health industry as you'll see it's also
[115.92 - 120.36] one of the biggest instances of
[118.36 - 123.64] capturing corruption within the

[200.40 - 205.64] attacked like this and we are going to
[202.92 - 208.90] set the record straight as many times as
[205.64 - 212.76] we need to
[208.90 - 215.40] [Music]
[212.76 - 217.80] people who lie are liars if you're
[215.40 - 221.00] willing to lie about one thing you might
[217.80 - 223.48] be willing to lie about everything One
[221.00 - 227.76] Lie calls into question the entirety of
[223.48 - 229.76] someone's character what about two three
[227.76 - 233.36] 4 100
[229.76 - 236.08] lies these are words from Ashley Foster
[233.36 - 237.60] words that she is soon going to eat
[236.08 - 240.20] because as I've said from the very
[237.60 - 242.96] beginning what Ashley projects and tries
[240.20 - 246.16] to accuse other people of being and
[242.96 - 248.60] doing is usually what she herself is
[246.16 - 251.16] guilty of being and
[248.60 - 254.08] doing Ashley is the ring leader of an
[251.16 - 256.96] organized anti-ed medium hateful group
[254.08 - 258.96] that she created on a mountain of Lies
[256.96 - 261.08] Ashley has been lying and attacking
[258.96 - 263.00] Anthony for years and she has now
[261.08 - 265.72] incited a group of people that are out
[263.00 - 267.80] there attacking harassing and bullying
[265.72 - 269.76] the medical medium community and even
[267.80 - 273.72] going as far as to make videos of them
[269.76 - 275.44] eles burning medical medium books okay
[273.72 - 276.96] all these medical medium books are going
[275.44 - 280.20] to be burned
[276.96 - 280.20] today it's
[280.72 - 284.28] happening this is going in first celery
[283.28 - 286.72] juice
[284.28 - 289.32] one I took out the insides because it's
[286.72 - 292.08] going to take forever to burn why is
[289.32 - 294.08] Ashley really doing this many have asked
[292.08 - 297.16] in response to the activities of the
[294.08 - 299.28] plotters one online commenter said it's
[297.16 - 300.32] clear there are other motives behind all
[299.28 - 302.56] this
[300.32 - 305.28] a different commenter said it's just
[302.56 - 306.96] full-on Reckless ruthless attacks that
[305.28 - 309.36] seems like it doesn't have anything to
[306.96 - 311.76] do with the realities nor facts of our
[309.36 - 315.40] community just attacks simply to bring
[311.76 - 318.20] us down utterly nonsensical and
[315.40 - 320.96] infuriating and another commenter said
[318.20 - 322.80] it's so clear that there's an agenda I
[320.96 - 324.24] don't see why anyone would listen to all
[322.80 - 328.68] their
[324.24 - 331.44] n so what are Ashley's ulterior motives
[328.68 - 334.56] what is this really about for her what
[331.44 - 336.52] type of person is capable of harboring
[334.56 - 338.80] so much hatred towards someone who does
[336.52 - 340.72] nothing but help the chronically ill
[338.80 - 343.12] even long after the madeup story they
[340.72 - 344.16] tried to use to slander him was proven
[343.12 - 347.20] to be
[344.16 - 350.76] false what type of person could be so
[347.20 - 353.20] painfully entitled and careless so as to
[350.76 - 355.12] spend years plotting and obsessively
[353.20 - 356.88] trying to bring Anthony and the entire
[355.12 - 359.08] medical medium community of chronically
[356.88 - 360.76] ill people who are already struggling
[359.08 - 362.68] down
[360.76 - 364.96] today we're going to be answering these
[362.68 - 367.80] questions Ashley's true motives are
[364.96 - 369.16] going to be exposed for the first time
[367.80 - 371.04] we're going to be revealing some
[369.16 - 373.96] shocking new facts that are wildly
[371.04 - 376.20] inconsistent with Ashley's Proclamation
[373.96 - 380.52] that she's doing this smear campaign
[376.20 - 382.92] quote #for step to Zone and we're going
[380.52 - 385.52] to begin exposing some of the many many
[382.92 - 387.80] more lies that Ashley has told since the
[385.52 - 390.52] release of our podcast episodes last
[387.80 - 392.28] year you may recall that in our previous
[390.52 - 394.60] episodes we played the following
[392.28 - 397.04] recording of Taylor call and Robbie
[394.60 - 400.40] Barbaro describing their friend and the
[397.04 - 402.88] number one plotter Ashley
[400.40 - 407.88] Foster and by the way Ash do need to
[402.88 - 410.84] work Ash ever ever the woman is she
[407.88 - 414.00] family money a lot of it you know
[410.84 - 414.00] private jet and
[414.24 - 419.88] plus Ashley has since responded to this
[417.24 - 422.28] part of our podcasts somebody said to
[419.88 - 424.16] her you are independently wealthy what
[422.28 - 426.80] is the source of your family's wealth
[424.16 - 428.20] I'm suspicious because of that and
[426.80 - 432.04] Ashley
[428.20 - 434.80] replied my dad grew up without shoes or
[432.04 - 437.80] electricity his first job was knocking
[434.80 - 441.72] the cement off off all Briggs for a
[437.80 - 444.80] penny a brick he worked incredibly hard
[441.72 - 447.52] harder than anyone else I have ever met
[444.80 - 450.56] eventually he was able to buy one of the
[447.52 - 454.32] houses he built for $700
[450.56 - 457.08] he sold it later for a few thousand he
[454.32 - 460.84] built another house by hand and sold
[457.08 - 464.44] that by the time he died at 83 he had
[460.84 - 467.24] been working in real estate for 60 years
[464.44 - 470.24] he built and sold houses and eventually
[467.24 - 473.52] apartment buildings he was able to leave
[470.24 - 475.96] an amazing Legacy for our family I'm
[473.52 - 479.20] incredibly proud of him and
[475.96 - 482.28] grateful that said we don't own a plane
[479.20 - 484.12] like they said in the podcast we aren't
[482.28 - 487.08] able to spend money without thinking
[484.12 - 490.08] about it we don't have vacation homes
[487.08 - 492.32] like Anthony does we don't have the
[490.08 - 495.28] ability to pay indefinitely for
[492.32 - 497.76] aggressive lawyers like Anthony does
[495.28 - 500.44] we're just able to live a comfortable
[497.76 - 503.64] life where I can stay home with my kids
[500.44 - 506.80] and homeschool them my husband works
[503.64 - 509.56] incredibly hard there's nothing crazy
[506.80 - 511.40] here we're just blessed and I'm really
[509.56 - 514.00] really
[511.40 - 516.64] grateful so Ashley's claiming
[514.00 - 519.56] specifically that quote we don't have a
[516.64 - 522.32] plane and quote we don't have vacation
[519.56 - 524.84] homes she's trying to portray herself as
[522.32 - 526.48] a victim of Anthony's lawyers saying
[524.84 - 528.68] that she can't afford ongoing legal
[526.48 - 531.36] representation of her own and she's
[528.68 - 535.28] depicting herself as having a simple
[531.36 - 537.04] humble life just to give you an idea of
[535.28 - 538.92] how absurd these statements and
[537.04 - 541.28] characterizations are I'm going to
[538.92 - 543.80] reference some of the many news articles
[541.28 - 547.04] that have been published about Ashley's
[543.80 - 550.16] family a July 2021 article in the Daily
[547.04 - 552.40] Mail is headlined son of late

[575.28 - 581.36] $3.5 billion fortune in real estate and
[579.04 - 584.60] energy The Daily Beast
[581.36 - 587.60] reported Ashley the number one plotter
[584.60 - 590.20] as you just heard is the daughter of a
[587.60 - 592.84] multi-billionaire with a
[590.20 - 594.84] B Not only was Ashley dishonest about
[592.84 - 596.36] her family's wealth but she also said
[594.84 - 598.28] that her father was able to leave an
[596.36 - 601.04] amazing Legacy for her family and that
[598.28 - 603.64] she is incredibly proud of of him in

[715.80 - 720.92] monitoring stations where typically one
[718.44 - 722.88] is needed
[720.92 - 724.28] Jean did not end up being convicted
[722.88 - 726.32] however news Outlet records and
[724.28 - 728.00] litigation documents show that Ashley's

[728.00 - 732.88] action lawsuits many scandals and many
[730.68 - 736.72] other types of lawsuits even still to

[866.20 - 870.04] document and combining it with a new
[868.44 - 872.44] cover page
[870.04 - 875.40] It also says the document was altered by
[872.44 - 876.92] a typewriter after the fact to reflect
[875.40 - 879.76] that pillar was a third party to the
[876.92 - 882.60] agreement with Phillips and moose the
[879.76 - 884.60] pillar signature lines font differs from
[882.60 - 887.72] the rest of the
[884.60 - 889.92] document as it turns out it's an awfully
[887.72 - 892.96] fragile glass mansion that Ashley is
[889.92 - 895.76] trying to throw stones from can we play
[892.96 - 898.28] that last audio
[895.76 - 900.16] again and by the way Ash didn't need to
[898.28 - 904.72] work Ash
[900.16 - 909.00] ever ever the woman is she family money
[904.72 - 912.36] a lot of it you know private jet and
[909.00 - 914.72] plus Ashley's closest friends said that
[912.36 - 917.64] she doesn't have to work and that she
[914.72 - 919.72] has a lot of family money like private
[917.64 - 923.20] jet
[919.72 - 926.32] plus and then Ashley denied their claims
[923.20 - 926.32] after the podcast came
[926.40 - 933.00] out that said we don't own a plane like
[929.92 - 935.84] they said in the podcast we aren't able
[933.00 - 938.44] to spend money without thinking about it
[935.84 - 941.04] we don't have vacation homes like
[938.44 - 941.04] Anthony
[941.56 - 946.28] does this part is hilarious because
[944.48 - 948.16] Ashley has always been an aspiring
[946.28 - 950.64] writer and she had written a piece about
[948.16 - 952.36] her own life years ago she sent it to
[950.64 - 954.60] multiple people who have since submitted
[952.36 - 957.48] evidence to us in this piece in
[954.60 - 959.40] reference to her family Ashley had said
[957.48 - 962.40] this
[959.40 - 965.24] my mother was gorgeous my father was
[962.40 - 969.48] brilliant and Rich they had cars and
[965.24 - 975.88] planes and houses all over the
[969.48 - 980.12] globe brilliant and rich cars and planes
[975.88 - 983.04] plural and homes all over the globe
[980.12 - 985.04] furthermore in 2018 Ashley's childhood
[983.04 - 988.20] home was listed in an article by D
[985.04 - 990.40] Magazine titled the 100 most expensive
[988.20 - 993.52] homes in Dallas Alice her family's home
[990.40 - 994.56] ranked number six at a value at the time
[993.52 - 998.88] of
[994.56 - 998.88] 29,5 56,0
[999.60 - 1004.44] $320 the house Ashley currently lives in
[1002.52 - 1007.40] and posts about on social media in
[1004.44 - 1008.56] Colorado is an 80 acre property worth
[1007.40 - 1010.96] $10
[1008.56 - 1015.00] million Ashley's previous home in
[1010.96 - 1016.56] California sold for $73 million and we
[1015.00 - 1018.32] know people who have visited multiple
[1016.56 - 1020.32] different properties of Ashley's in
[1018.32 - 1023.80] different places around the country some
[1020.32 - 1026.44] of which are worth close to $13
[1023.80 - 1028.56] million once in the process of trying to
[1026.44 - 1031.84] purchase a property Ashley had sent a
[1028.56 - 1035.44] text to a friend that says the
[1031.84 - 1037.84] following our first loan didn't close 2
[1035.44 - 1040.00] days before closing the board of the
[1037.84 - 1042.16] bank had approved the loan when our
[1040.00 - 1044.68] broker got a random call they were
[1042.16 - 1044.68] cancelling
[1044.76 - 1051.12] it the friend asked was your dad a
[1047.92 - 1055.60] backer and Ashley
[1051.12 - 1057.96] replied I was in tears and so confused
[1055.60 - 1061.16] and he was so pissed off and
[1057.96 - 1065.12] Confused my dad looks at the paperwork
[1061.16 - 1068.16] and goes oh this Bank never would have
[1065.12 - 1074.20] made you alone I sued them for $70
[1068.16 - 1074.20] million last year # thanks
[1074.32 - 1082.92] Dad the friend said holy LOL
[1079.44 - 1085.92] so Ashley's dad a late billionaire had
[1082.92 - 1088.84] sued a bank for $70
[1085.92 - 1090.96] million but Ashley wants you to believe
[1088.84 - 1093.56] that she can't afford a lawyer and that
[1090.96 - 1095.72] she is somehow a victim of Anthony's
[1093.56 - 1097.32] legal representation because she has
[1095.72 - 1099.56] simply been notified that she is
[1097.32 - 1101.36] repeatedly spreading verifiably false
[1099.56 - 1103.32] information about Anthony and about
[1101.36 - 1105.44] medical medium information and she
[1103.32 - 1107.84] continues to ignore the facts that have
[1105.44 - 1110.20] been presented to her in a different
[1107.84 - 1112.88] text Ashley wrote
[1110.20 - 1116.68] this we bought an apartment building in
[1112.88 - 1120.04] Texas with the help of my
[1116.68 - 1122.80] dad Ashley and her husband bought an
[1120.04 - 1126.52] apartment building with the help of her
[1122.80 - 1130.04] dad a lot of people rent apartments not
[1126.52 - 1131.36] many people can buy apartment buildings
[1130.04 - 1133.88] as investment
[1131.36 - 1135.84] properties and we have another text from
[1133.88 - 1138.92] Ashley to a
[1135.84 - 1143.04] friend a lot of huge huge things going
[1138.92 - 1146.76] on over here 100 plus million doll deals
[1143.04 - 1149.12] Etc it's a lot to get my mind around and
[1146.76 - 1151.60] I feel easily overwhelmed if I don't
[1149.12 - 1152.52] just focus on listening for what God has
[1151.60 - 1156.28] for
[1152.52 - 1158.40] me so she's involved with a 100 plus
[1156.28 - 1161.72] million doll
[1158.40 - 1163.96] deals 100 plus million dollar deals but
[1161.72 - 1167.16] remember everybody Ashley just lives a
[1163.96 - 1169.52] simple humble life she can't even afford
[1167.16 - 1171.48] legal representation and again she's the
[1169.52 - 1173.68] victim when she gets called out for the
[1171.48 - 1176.04] falsities that she originated and took
[1173.68 - 1179.32] to the media with the expressed intent
[1176.04 - 1179.32] of harming Anthony and the
[1179.36 - 1187.00] community um oh my
[1184.52 - 1192.28] um yeah we're hopeful that once the
[1187.00 - 1195.48] article's out um one of the directors or
[1192.28 - 1198.68] producers that Britain works with
[1195.48 - 1200.36] will uh you know become interested in
[1198.68 - 1202.64] telling the story really well I think
[1200.36 - 1206.48] it's going to take that because Anthony
[1202.64 - 1208.48] is so um he has such a presence and if
[1206.48 - 1210.92] it just stops at the article I'm
[1208.48 - 1213.08] guessing that like there would be some
[1210.92 - 1215.20] buzz in the medical medium Community for
[1213.08 - 1217.36] a few months but like really I think
[1215.20 - 1219.16] then it would kind of die down
[1217.36 - 1221.72] ultimately the
[1219.16 - 1223.92] way to really get the word out is like
[1221.72 - 1224.96] would be like a Netflix documentary you
[1223.92 - 1228.76] know
[1224.96 - 1231.68] so um once you hit that level of like
[1228.76 - 1234.72] being exposed there's kind of no there's
[1231.68 - 1234.72] no coming back from
[1234.80 - 1241.44] that there's kind of no coming back from
[1238.32 - 1243.96] that that's what Ashley wants for
[1241.44 - 1246.44] Anthony and let me be clear that nobody
[1243.96 - 1248.56] over here cares if Ashley has money or
[1246.44 - 1250.60] not that's not the problem it's the fact
[1248.56 - 1252.64] that she's being ridiculously dishonest
[1250.60 - 1254.92] about it and even publicly rebutting
[1252.64 - 1256.96] with her own close friends who know her
[1254.92 - 1259.48] situation personally said about her
[1256.96 - 1261.48] wealth at the same time as Ashley's
[1259.48 - 1264.88] trying to convince everyone that she's
[1261.48 - 1267.04] so perfectly honest and morally
[1264.88 - 1269.12] Superior the truth is that Ashley will
[1267.04 - 1271.04] throw anybody under the bus even her own
[1269.12 - 1272.60] friends who threaten The Masks she's
[1271.04 - 1275.16] wearing as she's trying to portray
[1272.60 - 1276.60] herself to be an everyday innocent Mommy
[1275.16 - 1277.84] so that people are more likely to
[1276.60 - 1280.96] believe her
[1277.84 - 1282.56] lies Ashley's misrepresenting herself
[1280.96 - 1284.92] just like she's misrepresented the
[1282.56 - 1287.16] entire Stephanie story and just like she
[1284.92 - 1289.56] continues to misrepresent Medical medium
[1287.16 - 1291.24] information with every lie and every
[1289.56 - 1294.76] falsity she's out there
[1291.24 - 1297.48] pedling here is again Ashley's response
[1294.76 - 1300.76] to what Taylor and Robbie said about
[1297.48 - 1303.36] her that said we don't own a plane like
[1300.76 - 1307.64] they said in the
[1303.36 - 1309.60] podcast they don't own a plane hm maybe
[1307.64 - 1311.92] Ashley doesn't have a plane but her
[1309.60 - 1314.40] family does or at least they did there's
[1311.92 - 1316.52] obviously a reason why Robbie and Taylor
[1314.40 - 1319.40] said what they did and Ashley's being
[1316.52 - 1320.88] dishonest again just a minute ago you
[1319.40 - 1323.08] heard what we read from Ashley from
[1320.88 - 1326.60] another time in which she said
[1323.08 - 1331.04] explicitly that her family has homes and
[1326.60 - 1332.52] cars and planes all over the globe if
[1331.04 - 1336.04] that wasn't enough there's also an
[1332.52 - 1337.84] article on businesswire.com from 2017
[1336.04 - 1340.24] about Ashley's father that
[1337.84 - 1342.76] reads Dallas real estate entrepreneur
[1340.24 - 1345.64] and philanthropist Jean e Phillips
[1342.76 - 1347.76] offered his private plane for a
[1345.64 - 1349.96] humanitarian flight to St Thomas and the
[1347.76 - 1353.96] US Virgin Islands last
[1349.96 - 1357.88] week her father offered up his plane not
[1353.96 - 1359.92] a plane his plane there are also
[1357.88 - 1361.72] multiple currently public posts on
[1359.92 - 1363.20] Ashley's mother's Instagram account in
[1361.72 - 1366.84] which the family can be seen on a
[1363.20 - 1366.84] private jet like in this
[1369.16 - 1375.12] video Ming with the
[1372.48 - 1378.12] dogs look at those dogs trying to bite
[1375.12 - 1378.12] me
[1380.72 - 1386.36] crazy dogs
[1383.36 - 1386.36] right
[1390.40 - 1394.36] more you wants to do it
[1397.00 - 1400.08] [Music]
[1400.32 - 1405.68] again if you're listening to the podcast
[1403.08 - 1407.88] version of this episode what you just
[1405.68 - 1410.84] heard is the sound to a video of
[1407.88 - 1412.88] Ashley's family on a private jet that
[1410.84 - 1416.60] seems to be on its way to the location
[1412.88 - 1418.28] tagged of CIO Hawaii it appears as
[1416.60 - 1420.16] though Ashley's mother is recording the
[1418.28 - 1422.20] video while Ashley's dad is holding
[1420.16 - 1424.76] Ashley's daughter on his lap as he's
[1422.20 - 1427.68] showing her something on his phone and
[1424.76 - 1432.20] Ashley herself is in plain view talking
[1427.68 - 1435.32] to someone behind him on the private jet
[1432.20 - 1439.52] it was posted on June 25th of 2019 with
[1435.32 - 1440.88] the caption quot memories Priceless as
[1439.52 - 1444.16] if from a trip they had taken in
[1440.88 - 1447.08] previous years it gets even crazier
[1444.16 - 1451.40] there are two posts one from July 7th of
[1447.08 - 1453.32] 2018 and one from July 15th of 2018 with
[1451.40 - 1456.48] photos of Ashley's kids on a private
[1453.32 - 1459.48] plane with Ashley's dad the July 7th
[1456.48 - 1461.00] 2018 post is captioned quote we are
[1459.48 - 1464.12] headed to
[1461.00 - 1466.88] Pennsylvania this was four months before
[1464.12 - 1469.28] Stephanie passed away and Pennsylvania
[1466.88 - 1472.52] is where Stephanie lived
[1469.28 - 1474.52] Ashley's family took the private jet
[1472.52 - 1477.80] that Ashley's now claiming that they
[1474.52 - 1480.76] don't have or have access to to the very
[1477.80 - 1483.64] state in which Stephanie lived just four
[1480.76 - 1487.84] months before Stephanie died and
[1483.64 - 1490.92] yet Ashley did not visit Stephanie once
[1487.84 - 1493.20] during the entire time she was sick we
[1490.92 - 1499.20] know this because in a blog post Ashley
[1493.20 - 1499.20] wrote on March 7th of 2020 she said this
[1499.56 - 1505.12] Steph went back home after a few months
[1502.36 - 1507.96] and a relationship turned into texts and
[1505.12 - 1510.88] occasional phone calls she was the kind
[1507.96 - 1514.00] of friend I didn't talk to every day but
[1510.88 - 1516.48] I never worried about it because I knew
[1514.00 - 1519.04] the second I saw her again it would be
[1516.48 - 1523.20] like we hadn't missed a day
[1519.04 - 1523.20] unfortunately I wouldn't have that
[1524.72 - 1531.36] chance here Ashley is referring to a
[1527.76 - 1533.92] Time when Stephanie stayed with her in
[1531.36 - 1537.04] 2016 Ashley is saying in this post that
[1533.92 - 1540.40] she never saw Stephanie again after that
[1537.04 - 1545.48] time Stephanie passed away on November
[1540.40 - 1548.60] 13th of 2018 over two years later in an
[1545.48 - 1551.56] Instagram post from March 6th of 2020
[1548.60 - 1553.96] Ashley said something similar Steph went
[1551.56 - 1556.68] back home to Pennsylvania a few months
[1553.96 - 1560.32] later and a relationship turned into
[1556.68 - 1562.20] texts and occasional calls she was the
[1560.32 - 1565.04] kind of friend I didn't talk to every
[1562.20 - 1568.36] day but who I knew I would never miss a
[1565.04 - 1571.48] beat with the second I saw her again
[1568.36 - 1574.64] unfortunately I never
[1571.48 - 1577.12] would Ashley saying she would never get
[1574.64 - 1580.04] the chance as if Stephanie had died
[1577.12 - 1581.72] right after that but Ashley had over two
[1580.04 - 1584.52] years of a
[1581.72 - 1586.44] chance for someone who claims to have
[1584.52 - 1589.04] cared so much about Stephanie that
[1586.44 - 1591.28] Stephanie is the reason why she is so
[1589.04 - 1593.60] determined to blatantly harm Anthony and
[1591.28 - 1596.16] the medical medium Community it seems
[1593.60 - 1598.84] just a little strange that Ashley did
[1596.16 - 1602.12] not visit Stephanie once while Stephanie
[1598.84 - 1604.28] was sick for 2 years Ashley clearly has
[1602.12 - 1608.16] the means her family according to her
[1604.28 - 1610.72] own words has quote cars and planes and
[1608.16 - 1613.76] houses all over the globe and Ashley
[1610.72 - 1615.88] appears to even have been on one of said
[1613.76 - 1617.88] private planes with her family to
[1615.88 - 1621.12] Pennsylvania just a few months before
[1617.88 - 1624.68] Stephanie died in Pennsylvania and yet
[1621.12 - 1627.60] Ashley still did not visit her instead
[1624.68 - 1629.56] during that time that Stephanie was sick
[1627.60 - 1632.52] Ashley was traveling to run Retreats
[1629.56 - 1635.12] with her friends here is a text that
[1632.52 - 1638.56] co-plot Taylor call had sent to a friend
[1635.12 - 1638.56] on November 6th of
[1639.08 - 1646.04] 2018 I'm good just now back from
[1642.56 - 1648.92] California the retreat was wonderful but
[1646.04 - 1651.96] loads of work gret and was sick and in
[1648.92 - 1655.24] the hospital the whole time so it was me
[1651.96 - 1658.96] Ash and Mel full
[1655.24 - 1662.08] on that text was sent just seven days
[1658.96 - 1664.72] before Stephanie passed away so for over
[1662.08 - 1667.16] two years despite Ashley taking multiple
[1664.72 - 1669.52] trips despite her having the time to run
[1667.16 - 1671.92] Retreats despite the family using a
[1669.52 - 1674.04] private jet to visit Pennsylvania where
[1671.92 - 1677.92] Stephanie lived all while Stephanie was
[1674.04 - 1680.08] sick Ashley didn't visit Stephanie once
[1677.92 - 1682.20] in instead Ashley was using that time
[1680.08 - 1685.32] trying to become something in the health
[1682.20 - 1687.60] industry using the medical medium name
[1685.32 - 1689.52] in Ashley's blog post from 2020 where
[1687.60 - 1691.04] she began pedaling her original false
[1689.52 - 1695.56] storyline about what happened with
[1691.04 - 1699.68] Stephanie she told a massive additional
[1695.56 - 1702.28] falsity I have absolutely no agenda I
[1699.68 - 1706.24] don't make money off clients or my
[1702.28 - 1708.16] Instagram I intentionally never have and
[1706.24 - 1711.80] the reason for that is because of how
[1708.16 - 1713.32] how highly I value the truth I know it's
[1711.80 - 1716.32] hard to trust people in the current
[1713.32 - 1718.68] climate of social media and no one is
[1716.32 - 1722.80] perfect but I want you guys to be able
[1718.68 - 1722.80] to trust me as much as you choose
[1723.12 - 1728.72] to As Nice And as trusting as that might
[1726.28 - 1731.40] sound it's far from the truth and it's
[1728.72 - 1734.16] incredibly manipulative Ashley clearly
[1731.40 - 1735.64] had an agenda all along and Ashley has
[1734.16 - 1738.20] very much made money off of her
[1735.64 - 1740.52] Instagram or at least she's tried to and
[1738.20 - 1742.80] she had every intention to do so I'm
[1740.52 - 1744.88] going to go through some examples first
[1742.80 - 1747.56] of all Ashley once had a platform on
[1744.88 - 1749.20] Instagram of around 20,000 followers she
[1747.56 - 1751.64] had this platform mostly because the
[1749.20 - 1753.32] medical medium account was reposting her
[1751.64 - 1756.04] and that's largely how her account grew
[1753.32 - 1757.96] to what it was at the time Ashley then
[1756.04 - 1759.68] used that platform built from the
[1757.96 - 1761.68] medical medium Community to sell a
[1759.68 - 1762.92] myriad of different digital products and
[1761.68 - 1765.32] inperson
[1762.92 - 1767.32] events one type of digital product
[1765.32 - 1769.20] Ashley made money from was her ebooks
[1767.32 - 1771.28] that she marketed on her Instagram
[1769.20 - 1773.52] account there were three different
[1771.28 - 1775.08] ebooks and we have receipts that were
[1773.52 - 1778.76] submitted To Us by people who had
[1775.08 - 1779.48] purchased them from Ashley in 2018 2019
[1778.76 - 1782.80] and
[1779.48 - 1786.08] 2020 two of them were $7 each for PDF
[1782.80 - 1789.64] copies and $15 each for hard copies and
[1786.08 - 1794.76] one of them was $20 for a PDF copy and
[1789.64 - 1796.72] $25 for a hard copy in 2018 through 2020
[1794.76 - 1799.08] Ashley was promoting her offerings a lot
[1796.72 - 1801.12] on social media Ashley shared
[1799.08 - 1803.16] screenshots directly on her Instagram
[1801.12 - 1805.00] stories that customers had taken of
[1803.16 - 1807.68] their receipts from purchasing Ashley's
[1805.00 - 1809.60] ebooks at the time of course Ashley
[1807.68 - 1811.52] would share these receipts to try to
[1809.60 - 1814.16] encourage more people to buy her ebooks
[1811.52 - 1816.68] through her Instagram Ashley promoted
[1814.16 - 1818.96] her ebooks constantly on her Instagram
[1816.68 - 1820.52] page there were so many promotional
[1818.96 - 1823.24] posts but we're going to read off the
[1820.52 - 1825.56] captions for just a few of them in one
[1823.24 - 1828.32] post Ashley made during that time period

[1956.88 - 1964.32] 23rd of 2019 six months after Stephanie

[1991.24 - 1993.64] your
[1994.76 - 1999.80] favor but what takes the cake out of all
[1997.20 - 2002.32] of this is that Ashley actually released
[1999.80 - 2005.96] her second ebook the day after Stephanie
[2002.32 - 2008.56] passed away in her November 14th 2018
[2005.96 - 2010.36] promotional post Ashley even casually
[2008.56 - 2012.72] mentioned in the caption that a friend
[2010.36 - 2014.08] of hers had died last night but that she
[2012.72 - 2016.40] felt like it was still the right thing
[2014.08 - 2019.64] to do to launch and start selling her
[2016.40 - 2021.44] next ebook anyway Ashley is the daughter
[2019.64 - 2023.76] of a billionaire it's not like she
[2021.44 - 2026.76] needed the money she had no publisher
[2023.76 - 2028.68] and no deadline this was an ebook Ashley
[2026.76 - 2030.96] self-published she had the freedom to
[2028.68 - 2032.60] release it at any time of her choosing
[2030.96 - 2036.04] and she decided that the day after
[2032.60 - 2037.84] Stephanie died was the right time and
[2036.04 - 2040.72] then in the caption of the promotional
[2037.84 - 2043.36] host Ashley said
[2040.72 - 2046.52] this I could use your help getting the
[2043.36 - 2048.44] word out about this little book I just
[2046.52 - 2050.56] didn't have the energy to do the
[2048.44 - 2055.48] giveaways and the hype stuff to build
[2050.56 - 2055.48] momentum for it but that's the way life
[2055.56 - 2060.56] goes Ashley offered to donate some of
[2058.36 - 2063.12] the proceeds of her book sales to relief
[2060.56 - 2065.48] efforts for the Wy fires that were going
[2063.12 - 2068.36] on and affecting Ashley personally at
[2065.48 - 2069.76] the time but not all of the proceeds and
[2068.36 - 2071.92] again Ashley is the daughter of a
[2069.76 - 2073.56] billionaire she doesn't need sales from
[2071.92 - 2076.64] the medical medium Community to donate
[2073.56 - 2080.60] to a cause what a bizarre time to try to
[2076.64 - 2082.80] make money not even 24 hours after
[2080.60 - 2084.76] Stephanie died that's the kind of thing
[2082.80 - 2088.72] you do when you don't care about the
[2084.76 - 2092.00] person who died but to each their
[2088.72 - 2093.60] own so not only did Ashley lie about
[2092.00 - 2095.84] never making money or trying to make
[2093.60 - 2098.32] money off of her Instagram clearly she
[2095.84 - 2100.20] did but Ashley even tried to make money
[2098.32 - 2103.20] off of her Instagram the very next day
[2100.20 - 2105.00] after Stephanie passed away and Ashley
[2103.20 - 2107.56] was not only making money on Instagram
[2105.00 - 2110.00] with her ebooks but she was also trying
[2107.56 - 2113.12] desperately to make a name and a brand
[2110.00 - 2115.24] for herself Ashley used the name of her
[2113.12 - 2117.20] weight loss ebook and made a separate
[2115.24 - 2119.28] Instagram account for it she did
[2117.20 - 2121.40] Instagram lives promoting it she made a
[2119.28 - 2123.72] Facebook group for it she created an
[2121.40 - 2125.52] Instagram hashtag for it and she used
[2123.72 - 2127.00] the hashtag in a bunch of her posts and
[2125.52 - 2128.40] encouraged other people to use the
[2127.00 - 2130.20] hashtag too
[2128.40 - 2132.84] and Ashley wanted to do a retreat in
[2130.20 - 2135.32] 2020 centered around this brand she
[2132.84 - 2137.64] created one Instagram post she had made
[2135.32 - 2140.80] a few years ago said
[2137.64 - 2144.52] this I'm over here dreaming up holding
[2140.80 - 2147.72] some Retreats this year based on my meal
[2144.52 - 2150.40] plan Ashley also participated in a vegan
[2147.72 - 2152.88] bundle with one of her ebooks another
[2150.40 - 2154.96] Avenue of Ashley making money off of her
[2152.88 - 2156.56] Instagram we have a receipt that was
[2154.96 - 2158.08] submitted to us from someone who
[2156.56 - 2161.60] purchased the bundle without Ashley's
[2158.08 - 2164.76] ebook in it for $50 from Ashley on
[2161.60 - 2166.96] February 7th of 2020 which was just 4
[2164.76 - 2169.04] days before Ashley started coming out
[2166.96 - 2171.08] against medical medium and publicly
[2169.04 - 2173.88] spreading false stories about
[2171.08 - 2175.76] Stephanie think about this Ashley was
[2173.88 - 2179.76] making money off of the medical medium
[2175.76 - 2181.68] community Through Instagram 4 days
[2179.76 - 2183.92] before coming out with her false
[2181.68 - 2185.72] story for anyone who doesn't know how
[2183.92 - 2187.76] bundle companies work I'll give you an
[2185.72 - 2189.60] example I was asked to be an affiliate
[2187.76 - 2192.12] for a bundle company multiple times over
[2189.60 - 2193.80] the past year I chose not to participate
[2192.12 - 2196.12] but I was sent all of the information
[2193.80 - 2197.52] about how the commission structure works
[2196.12 - 2199.20] the vegan bundle that Ashley
[2197.52 - 2201.00] participated in was a different type of
[2199.20 - 2202.72] bundle than the one I was asked to be a
[2201.00 - 2204.16] part of but the structure for all of
[2202.72 - 2206.24] them is very similar so I'm going to
[2204.16 - 2207.84] read off parts of the pitch that I
[2206.24 - 2209.40] received to give you a peek into how
[2207.84 - 2211.56] much money Ashley could have made from
[2209.40 - 2213.68] being a digital product contributor in
[2211.56 - 2215.72] the vegan bundle and selling and
[2213.68 - 2218.24] marketing it directly from her Instagram
[2215.72 - 2221.56] account the pitch I received ceed said
[2218.24 - 2223.92] this in short we have over 100 creators
[2221.56 - 2226.08] come together and each ad their book or
[2223.92 - 2229.36] course as an affiliate you would make
[2226.08 - 2230.80] $19 per bundle you sell I sold 800
[2229.36 - 2233.20] bundles our last
[2230.80 - 2235.04] launch in the bundle companies Creator
[2233.20 - 2236.52] section of their website participating
[2235.04 - 2239.08] in the bundle is marketed to have the
[2236.52 - 2244.20] following benefits it says why should I
[2239.08 - 2247.60] join one high earnings two huge exposure
[2244.20 - 2249.80] three followers love it and then in the
[2247.60 - 2251.84] the commission breakdown section it says
[2249.80 - 2253.72] if you contribute with one or several of
[2251.84 - 2257.00] your digital products in the bundle you
[2253.72 - 2260.76] get 70% Commission of the net profit
[2257.00 - 2262.64] which is $33 per bundle sold as somebody
[2260.76 - 2264.60] contributing an ebook Ashley could have
[2262.64 - 2266.96] gotten a similar commission making
[2264.60 - 2269.48] around $33 per bundle she sold through
[2266.96 - 2271.16] promoting it on her Instagram the person
[2269.48 - 2273.60] who reached out to me with this proposal
[2271.16 - 2276.76] said that they sold 800 bundles during
[2273.60 - 2278.72] one 10day launch as an example so just
[2276.76 - 2280.96] to piece all this together for everyone
[2278.72 - 2283.56] if Ashley with her 20,000 followers at
[2280.96 - 2285.40] the time would have sold even half of
[2283.56 - 2287.92] the example amount that I was given for
[2285.40 - 2291.60] a similar bundle and therefore made 400
[2287.92 - 2293.40] sales at $33 commission per bundle sold
[2291.60 - 2295.92] Ashley would have made
[2293.40 - 2298.44] $13,200 in 10
[2295.92 - 2300.12] days and again all of this is done
[2298.44 - 2302.92] through marketing the bundles on
[2300.12 - 2305.52] Instagram meaning that Ashley in fact
[2302.92 - 2307.96] made money or tried to make money off of
[2305.52 - 2311.28] her Instagram
[2307.96 - 2313.64] once again Ashley misled
[2311.28 - 2316.32] people we not only have proof that
[2313.64 - 2318.76] Ashley did in fact make money or try to
[2316.32 - 2320.36] make money off of her Instagram but we
[2318.76 - 2322.80] also have proof that she got new
[2320.36 - 2324.40] customers and likely made more money
[2322.80 - 2325.88] after she started pedaling her false
[2324.40 - 2328.24] storyline about
[2325.88 - 2331.28] Stephanie here's a comment somebody made
[2328.24 - 2334.72] to Ashley on Instagram on February 11th
[2331.28 - 2336.64] of 2020 it says hi Ash I had no idea who
[2334.72 - 2337.84] you were until today when your post
[2336.64 - 2340.76] about your dear friend started
[2337.84 - 2342.04] circulating social media first I'm so
[2340.76 - 2344.24] sorry for the losses that you've
[2342.04 - 2345.88] experienced and I'm hopeful that by
[2344.24 - 2347.92] sharing this that it will help those of
[2345.88 - 2349.60] us who follow Anthony make those hard
[2347.92 - 2351.96] decisions about the intersection of
[2349.60 - 2354.56] holistic wellness and life-saving modern
[2351.96 - 2356.56] medicine so many of us have been so sick
[2354.56 - 2358.56] for so long and we are vulnerable to a
[2356.56 - 2360.96] message of healing even if it's tainted
[2358.56 - 2362.84] or imperfect in some way thank you for
[2360.96 - 2364.68] sharing your truth I think it's so
[2362.84 - 2366.88] important to not follow anything or
[2364.68 - 2369.28] anyone blindly although so many have
[2366.88 - 2371.20] experienced healing with Anthony and I
[2369.28 - 2373.64] was super excited to order all of your
[2371.20 - 2377.64] books sending you lots of
[2373.64 - 2380.64] love to begin with that person believed
[2377.64 - 2383.40] I did what Ashley said I did Ashley
[2380.64 - 2387.16] created a false story and that person
[2383.40 - 2389.88] believed it and now that person believes
[2387.16 - 2392.04] Ashley is doing a justifiable action
[2389.88 - 2395.16] most likely that person will never hear
[2392.04 - 2397.68] the truth and they're probably just gone
[2395.16 - 2400.24] they left thinking that I hurt somebody
[2397.68 - 2404.48] second she purchased all of Ashley's
[2400.24 - 2406.80] books so Ashley made money selling books
[2404.48 - 2409.60] on a platform that was built off of
[2406.80 - 2412.88] medical medium and then at the same time
[2409.60 - 2416.08] using a false story to do so in that
[2412.88 - 2418.44] instance oh yeah and Ashley claimed that
[2416.08 - 2421.36] she never made money on her Instagram
[2418.44 - 2423.52] and here it is little old honest Ashley
[2421.36 - 2426.48] once again being
[2423.52 - 2428.16] dishonest even better than that Ashley's
[2426.48 - 2431.32] ebooks are still still available for
[2428.16 - 2432.92] purchase to this day multiple people
[2431.32 - 2435.04] submitted receipts to us from their
[2432.92 - 2435.96] purchases of Ashley's ebooks in December
[2435.04 - 2438.76] of
[2435.96 - 2441.00] 2023 and Ashley wanted to make a whole
[2438.76 - 2443.80] lot more money off of the medical medium
[2441.00 - 2446.20] community Through many different Avenues
[2443.80 - 2447.96] this was what she wanted one
[2446.20 - 2452.00] money-making Avenue was through running
[2447.96 - 2453.84] big Retreats first in 2016 Ashley began
[2452.00 - 2456.04] by sending an email to let Anthony and
[2453.84 - 2458.40] his wife know that she wanted to host a
[2456.04 - 2460.20] retreat in Santa Monica California and
[2458.40 - 2463.24] she asked them if they would give her
[2460.20 - 2466.04] and her Retreat a shout out then later
[2463.24 - 2468.76] on in 2016 Ashley submitted a business
[2466.04 - 2470.76] proposal to Anthony Ashley wanted to do
[2468.76 - 2472.52] medical medium Retreats with Anthony
[2470.76 - 2473.76] using the medical medium name in the
[2472.52 - 2476.40] summer of
[2473.76 - 2478.84] 2017 in the business proposal which I
[2476.40 - 2481.40] have in front of me Ashley included a
[2478.84 - 2484.16] cost analysis and financial forecast for
[2481.40 - 2487.44] 150 attendees with a cost of attendance
[2484.16 - 2490.48] of $33,000 per person and a total
[2487.44 - 2490.48] Revenue amount of
[2490.84 - 2496.44] $450,000 it's worth noting that in this
[2493.56 - 2498.92] 2016 business proposal Ashley listed
[2496.44 - 2500.32] Robbie Barbaro on the retreat itinerary
[2498.92 - 2502.52] as someone who would have been teaching
[2500.32 - 2506.04] classes at the medical medium Retreat
[2502.52 - 2508.24] that she wanted to run and profit from
[2506.04 - 2511.16] Ashley also stated in her business
[2508.24 - 2513.96] proposal that quote by looking ahead to
[2511.16 - 2517.36] 2018 the quote event could grow up to
[2513.96 - 2519.76] 250 people if desired this shows was
[2517.36 - 2522.48] that Ashley's desire was to do medical
[2519.76 - 2525.28] medium Retreats for years to come and to
[2522.48 - 2528.64] make even more money with more people at
[2525.28 - 2530.76] $3,000 per person with 250 people like
[2528.64 - 2533.08] Ashley desired the revenue would have
[2530.76 - 2533.08] been
[2534.12 - 2540.68] $750,000 and then came a pivotal moment
[2537.52 - 2543.96] in history Anthony turned it all down
[2540.68 - 2546.64] and said no to Ashley's big Retreat
[2543.96 - 2548.44] proposal I've always felt Ashley was not
[2546.64 - 2551.24] looking out for the community and The
[2548.44 - 2553.96] Chronic ill so much she was more into
[2551.24 - 2555.36] what can Ashley get out of this and that
[2553.96 - 2558.24] concerned
[2555.36 - 2560.44] me Ashley got turned down and then
[2558.24 - 2562.72] Ashley still had Her Mind Set On Doing
[2560.44 - 2565.00] Retreats so she went forward with trying
[2562.72 - 2567.28] to do them on her own we have a
[2565.00 - 2569.00] screenshot from Ashley's old website in
[2567.28 - 2572.16] which she had a spot she was using to
[2569.00 - 2576.60] Market upcoming Retreats under upcoming
[2572.16 - 2578.52] events it says summer Retreat 2017 check
[2576.60 - 2581.32] back for more information
[2578.52 - 2583.16] soon Ashley was trying to Market her own
[2581.32 - 2586.04] retreat but it seems as though this
[2583.16 - 2587.72] Retreat never ended up taking place
[2586.04 - 2589.88] however Ashley still kept trying to move
[2587.72 - 2592.88] forward to make her big Retreat business
[2589.88 - 2597.40] plans happen here is the text Ashley
[2592.88 - 2597.40] sent to someone on April 29th of
[2597.56 - 2603.52] 2018 would be fun to buy a small house
[2600.76 - 2606.52] there and just set it up to do Retreats
[2603.52 - 2610.28] let comfy bunk beds in each room and
[2606.52 - 2613.00] make it hold 10 to 12 people and then I
[2610.28 - 2617.28] could fly into lead Retreats once a
[2613.00 - 2619.72] month and make like 30 grand house would
[2617.28 - 2619.72] pay for
[2620.16 - 2626.12] itself and here is another text she sent
[2623.08 - 2628.92] to the same person 3 days
[2626.12 - 2630.64] later it would make even more sense for
[2628.92 - 2635.24] me to just do like a full month of
[2630.64 - 2639.24] Retreats twice a year and bring in
[2635.24 - 2642.08] 240k less with cost of course how much
[2639.24 - 2645.08] cashh do I need in the bank do you think
[2642.08 - 2647.56] to get a loan on these houses I'd want
[2645.08 - 2650.16] to do it without my
[2647.56 - 2653.80] trust she's the daughter of a
[2650.16 - 2656.68] billionaire family she has a trust fund
[2653.80 - 2659.08] and she was trying to use medical medium
[2656.68 - 2660.84] to make it big in the health industry
[2659.08 - 2663.40] and she didn't want to dip into her
[2660.84 - 2666.28] trust and I can promise you this her
[2663.40 - 2668.08] trust fund doesn't just have $220,000 in
[2666.28 - 2669.44] it
[2668.08 - 2671.52] I'm sure it
[2669.44 - 2673.40] doesn't we've got the daughter of a
[2671.52 - 2675.20] billionaire with a trust fund who's
[2673.40 - 2677.36] trying to act like she can't even afford
[2675.20 - 2679.32] a lawyer but she does have a lawyer by
[2677.36 - 2680.80] the way everybody should know that and
[2679.32 - 2683.24] she was trying to do medical medium
[2680.80 - 2686.40] Retreats so that she could make
[2683.24 - 2688.20] $240,000 a year from the chronically ill
[2686.40 - 2690.00] only have to show up for two months out
[2688.20 - 2692.68] of the year and she didn't want to dip
[2690.00 - 2694.88] into her trust fund
[2692.68 - 2697.12] amazing next I'm going to play voice
[2694.88 - 2700.36] text that Ashley sent to Anthony around
[2697.12 - 2702.80] that same time in 2018 asking him again
[2700.36 - 2705.48] about doing Retreats note that we are
[2702.80 - 2708.52] redacting the name of her child for
[2705.48 - 2711.20] privacy as you'll hear in the audios the
[2708.52 - 2713.28] Retreats were her and her friend's ideas
[2711.20 - 2716.28] Ashley reached out multiple times over
[2713.28 - 2719.40] the course of 17 days trying to get me
[2716.28 - 2721.20] on the phone trying to get me involved
[2719.40 - 2723.96] and still trying to use the medical
[2721.20 - 2726.36] medium name on them and get me to
[2723.96 - 2729.16] promote them and I was not interested
[2726.36 - 2730.76] and told her no this was many months
[2729.16 - 2732.64] after Stephanie was diagnosed with
[2730.76 - 2735.20] cancer and Ashley was trying to do
[2732.64 - 2735.20] business with
[2735.56 - 2739.52] me hey it's Ash I
[2742.24 - 2748.88] know sorry got too
[2745.24 - 2750.60] bigle it's okay Budd um okay I know you
[2748.88 - 2752.04] talked to gret about this that she and I
[2750.60 - 2754.76] are trying to get some Retreat stuff
[2752.04 - 2756.52] going and she's doing one in Hawaii that
[2754.76 - 2759.32] I'm going to help her do the food for
[2756.52 - 2763.16] which will be really fun but we've also
[2759.32 - 2765.04] been talking about this main idea and um
[2763.16 - 2766.92] we're getting a proposal from them to do
[2765.04 - 2769.40] a retreat for a smaller group like you
[2766.92 - 2771.88] and I talked about of about 30 people
[2769.40 - 2774.96] this coming September and I just wanted
[2771.88 - 2777.12] to get a feel from you because I wasn't
[2774.96 - 2778.64] sure I kind of felt like you weren't
[2777.12 - 2780.64] really wanting to be involved in that
[2778.64 - 2783.44] which is totally fine I just wanted to
[2780.64 - 2784.72] make sure before we go ahead and see
[2783.44 - 2787.60] like is that something that you would
[2784.72 - 2791.56] want to do through medical medium at all
[2787.60 - 2793.68] and um if not we're going to just Market
[2791.56 - 2795.16] it as like a family Retreat where like
[2793.68 - 2798.16] the food happens to follow medical
[2795.16 - 2799.36] medium healing um guidelines and you
[2798.16 - 2801.28] know we'll be we'll run all our
[2799.36 - 2804.00] marketing by you guys just to make sure
[2801.28 - 2805.76] it's like on the up and up but um it
[2804.00 - 2807.80] wouldn't be like we would make sure to
[2805.76 - 2809.84] make it clear it's not like affiliated
[2807.80 - 2811.60] with medical medium so that's kind of
[2809.84 - 2813.28] what I'm thinking because I sort of got
[2811.60 - 2816.28] the vibe of like you're not sure about
[2813.28 - 2818.80] that yet but correct me if I'm wrong
[2816.28 - 2822.08] okay if you guys would like to
[2818.80 - 2824.04] be like have medical medium be the SP of
[2822.08 - 2826.84] something like that the idea I mean the
[2824.04 - 2829.48] retreat is just on a beautiful Retreat
[2826.84 - 2831.96] facility and there's hiking and beaches
[2829.48 - 2833.76] and a lake and we're not going to plan
[2831.96 - 2836.32] like too much for people it's mostly
[2833.76 - 2839.32] about you know a chance to get together
[2836.32 - 2841.12] with other people and all the food you
[2839.32 - 2843.52] know have the food done for you and just
[2841.12 - 2845.96] to rest and maybe there'll be like a
[2843.52 - 2847.36] cooking demo and some like guided
[2845.96 - 2849.56] meditations or something something like
[2847.36 - 2852.44] that but nothing nothing super
[2849.56 - 2855.20] structured nothing real um formal it'll
[2852.44 - 2859.28] just be an opportunity for people to
[2855.20 - 2859.28] come take advantage of the
[2860.52 - 2864.84] location all I have to say just let me
[2862.60 - 2867.20] know if it's something you guys did do
[2864.84 - 2870.52] end up feeling like you want to be more
[2867.20 - 2872.88] through the mm Banner or if you're if
[2870.52 - 2875.88] you'd rather us just kind of Take the
[2872.88 - 2877.32] Lead and run with it and like I said
[2875.88 - 2880.00] we'll be well you know you know I'll
[2877.32 - 2881.60] check with you in case to make sure all
[2880.00 - 2883.72] our marketing is really clear in that
[2881.60 - 2885.24] case that it's not through you guys and
[2883.72 - 2887.72] and we won't we'll be careful with the
[2885.24 - 2887.72] wording and
[2888.80 - 2895.32] everything that first audio was sent on
[2891.56 - 2898.52] April 27th in 2018 Ashley did not get a
[2895.32 - 2901.24] response from Anthony and then Ashley
[2898.52 - 2902.48] sent another one nudging him further on
[2901.24 - 2906.08] May
[2902.48 - 2908.08] 14th hello good morning good afternoon I
[2906.08 - 2911.00] don't know where you are
[2908.08 - 2913.84] um this is the week we have to make a
[2911.00 - 2916.76] decision about the main Retreat we got a
[2913.84 - 2921.60] proposal back from Catherine at Point
[2916.76 - 2923.40] Lookout it suggests a cost of about
[2921.60 - 2926.52] 41,000
[2923.40 - 2929.80] and that's with an estimate of 30 people
[2926.52 - 2931.88] 30 adults and 10 children so the cost
[2929.80 - 2933.20] per person comes down to a little like
[2931.88 - 2935.16] around
[2933.20 - 2938.12] $1,100 per
[2935.16 - 2940.52] person so
[2938.12 - 2942.96] I think it has the potential to be a
[2940.52 - 2945.60] pretty good little test trial you know
[2942.96 - 2947.16] if we are thinking of a retreat cost of
[2945.60 - 2948.80] around
[2947.16 - 2951.12] $3,000
[2948.80 - 2953.52] um and it's really cool because if it
[2951.12 - 2957.48] did work next year we could do the same
[2953.52 - 2958.96] thing for 150 people and all of a sudden
[2957.48 - 2961.32] then it would really be generating some
[2958.96 - 2963.28] income let me know your thoughts it's
[2961.32 - 2965.40] obviously no pressure but we just are
[2963.28 - 2969.64] going to have to make some decisions
[2965.40 - 2971.36] about it this week so so um any insight
[2969.64 - 2973.44] into what you're thinking and whether
[2971.36 - 2977.96] you guys would want to be involved would
[2973.44 - 2977.96] be awesome okay love you
[2980.52 - 2984.76] bye Ashley's saying here that the
[2982.84 - 2987.56] retreat she had been planning would just
[2984.76 - 2990.52] be a test trial she said that she wants
[2987.56 - 2993.76] to charge people $3,000 for the retreat
[2990.52 - 2996.16] and ultimately at some point host 150
[2993.76 - 2999.36] people which if you do the math would
[2996.16 - 3002.52] bring in almost half a million dollar
[2999.36 - 3005.56] half a million dollar for one
[3002.52 - 3008.88] Retreat Anthony how did you respond to
[3005.56 - 3010.48] this prodding from Ashley I turned her
[3008.88 - 3013.44] down
[3010.48 - 3015.52] again right and then after you turned
[3013.44 - 3017.80] her down Ashley still tried to pursue
[3015.52 - 3020.44] doing Retreats on her own to whomever
[3017.80 - 3022.84] she could sell them to Ashley did end up
[3020.44 - 3025.00] posting a retreat later on with now co-
[3022.84 - 3028.00] plotters Taylor and Gretchen and they
[3025.00 - 3030.28] had a total of 12 attendees
[3028.00 - 3033.76] I'm sure that 12 attendees made Ashley a
[3030.28 - 3036.16] lot less money than the 150 to 250
[3033.76 - 3038.00] attendees that Ashley was hoping to get
[3036.16 - 3039.56] from doing Retreats with Anthony using
[3038.00 - 3041.76] his name and
[3039.56 - 3044.40] likeness Ashley's retreat with Taylor
[3041.76 - 3048.16] and Gretchen took place in aahu Hawaii
[3044.40 - 3050.68] from October 15th through the 21st in
[3048.16 - 3053.72] 2018 this Retreat ended just three and a
[3050.68 - 3055.00] half weeks before Stephanie passed away
[3053.72 - 3056.88] in the marketing that was done to
[3055.00 - 3059.60] promoted on Instagram the details of the
[3056.88 - 3061.92] retreat included quote all organic
[3059.60 - 3063.96] plant-based grain-free meals in line
[3061.92 - 3067.68] with the medical medium protocol and
[3063.96 - 3070.72] quote cooking classes led by
[3067.68 - 3073.56] Ashley so again Ashley was too busy to
[3070.72 - 3075.32] visit Stephanie once while she was sick
[3073.56 - 3076.80] but she certainly wasn't too busy to
[3075.32 - 3079.28] travel from where she was living in
[3076.80 - 3081.00] California to Hawaii and run Retreats
[3079.28 - 3084.12] using medical medium
[3081.00 - 3086.64] information and then even over a year
[3084.12 - 3088.48] after Stephanie passed away Ashley was
[3086.64 - 3090.72] still trying to run medical medium
[3088.48 - 3092.40] Retreats Ashley ended up trying to sell
[3090.72 - 3094.24] a retreat that she would have hosted
[3092.40 - 3096.60] along with Gretchen in
[3094.24 - 3099.76] 2020 initially The Retreat dates were
[3096.60 - 3102.76] going to be August 31st to September 5th
[3099.76 - 3104.48] of 2020 initially Ashley had said that
[3102.76 - 3106.88] she wanted to add a second week to that
[3104.48 - 3109.44] but then she changed her mind Ashley
[3106.88 - 3112.44] marketed this Retreat all over her
[3109.44 - 3114.60] Instagram in early 2020 just literal
[3112.44 - 3118.08] weeks before she came out with her false
[3114.60 - 3120.08] Stephanie story in one Instagram post
[3118.08 - 3122.00] Ashley started describing the retreat by
[3120.08 - 3124.20] saying
[3122.00 - 3127.72] this cost is
[3124.20 - 3132.20] $3,800 for the week all meals daily
[3127.72 - 3132.20] hiking and yoga and celery juice
[3132.36 - 3137.56] included in that same Instagram story
[3135.08 - 3140.00] post Ashley included a blurry photo of
[3137.56 - 3142.16] random people swimming in the ocean she
[3140.00 - 3143.60] Drew an arrow pointing to two of them
[3142.16 - 3146.52] and said
[3143.60 - 3150.84] this I recognize that these are random
[3146.52 - 3150.84] some people but this could be you and
[3152.52 - 3158.88] me in the next Instagram story Ashley
[3155.64 - 3161.76] said this I know it's expensive but if
[3158.88 - 3166.24] you find a Budd and save $10 a day
[3161.76 - 3166.24] between now and then you can both
[3166.52 - 3171.16] come Ashley then did a series of
[3169.40 - 3174.28] promotional Instagram stories for the
[3171.16 - 3178.60] retreat one said
[3174.28 - 3181.56] this OMG you guys I booked it I'm
[3178.60 - 3183.72] freaking out who will come eat dinner at
[3181.56 - 3187.28] this table with
[3183.72 - 3189.60] me she also included a poll in this post
[3187.28 - 3192.84] with one option being yes and the other
[3189.60 - 3195.92] option being yes also next to a photo of
[3192.84 - 3198.28] an outdoor table overlooking the beach
[3195.92 - 3200.48] then Ashley posted a very blurry photo
[3198.28 - 3205.20] of a bed and said
[3200.48 - 3208.44] this there are so few spaces six each
[3205.20 - 3208.44] week is this your
[3208.64 - 3214.20] bed Ashley did many other promotional
[3211.44 - 3216.16] posts for this Retreat on her Instagram
[3214.20 - 3218.68] and then she said
[3216.16 - 3221.56] this and for those of you who feel like
[3218.68 - 3224.64] you're missing out don't worry I'll do
[3221.56 - 3227.60] something here in LA in May more on that
[3224.64 - 3231.00] after I fill up
[3227.60 - 3234.48] Hawaii so Ashley planned to continue on
[3231.00 - 3236.12] doing Retreats and making money Ashley
[3234.48 - 3238.16] then had two long-standing story
[3236.12 - 3240.80] highlights lights up on her Instagram in
[3238.16 - 3242.40] 2020 one was for marketing her Retreat
[3240.80 - 3245.36] and the other was for marketing one of
[3242.40 - 3247.92] her ebooks in addition to those Retreats
[3245.36 - 3250.08] on her former website Ashley marketed a
[3247.92 - 3251.68] variety of different offerings a dinner
[3250.08 - 3254.64] party she hosted in
[3251.68 - 3255.88] 2018 a wellness week private retreat for
[3254.64 - 3258.60] two people in
[3255.88 - 3261.88] 2019 a cooking class and meal planning
[3258.60 - 3264.88] workshop that Ashley charged $150 per
[3261.88 - 3266.60] person for in 2018 and a virtual meal
[3264.88 - 3269.32] planning workshop that Ashley char Char
[3266.60 - 3271.92] $60 per person for in
[3269.32 - 3274.60] 2018 Ashley also had an Amazon
[3271.92 - 3276.64] storefront she linked products like VI's
[3274.60 - 3278.80] barleygrass juice powder which Ashley
[3276.64 - 3281.68] described by saying
[3278.80 - 3284.96] this one of the supplements I take every
[3281.68 - 3287.12] single day I filed it under Beauty
[3284.96 - 3289.24] because it has helped my hair grow in so
[3287.12 - 3292.24] thick and
[3289.24 - 3294.04] shiny Ashley had plenty of plans for
[3292.24 - 3296.12] making money off of the medical medium
[3294.04 - 3297.20] community Through many other avenues as
[3296.12 - 3299.88] well
[3297.20 - 3302.04] in 2016 Ashley submitted a proposal to
[3299.88 - 3303.92] Anthony's wife in which Ashley offered
[3302.04 - 3306.72] to invest in getting a YouTube channel
[3303.92 - 3310.00] going for medical medium Ashley proposed
[3306.72 - 3312.72] doing a 5050 Revenue split Ashley wanted
[3310.00 - 3314.68] 50% of all of the medical medium YouTube
[3312.72 - 3317.32] earnings this is something that never
[3314.68 - 3320.12] ended up panning out and so just so
[3317.32 - 3322.48] everyone is clear to this day I do not
[3320.12 - 3325.48] accept money from YouTube this was
[3322.48 - 3327.76] Ashley calculating and planning some
[3325.48 - 3330.40] kind of financial Endeavor that she
[3327.76 - 3332.64] wanted to do with me that wasn't about
[3330.40 - 3335.52] money going back into the community with
[3332.64 - 3338.60] more free resources instead it was
[3335.52 - 3340.04] Ashley hoping to make money for herself
[3338.60 - 3343.08] classic
[3340.04 - 3345.40] Ashley we also have texts that Ashley
[3343.08 - 3350.40] sent to a health practitioner friend on
[3345.40 - 3353.68] November 7th of 2017 they said
[3350.40 - 3356.92] this what if we did an ebook
[3353.68 - 3360.12] specifically for the postpartum period
[3356.92 - 3362.87] and if we kept it short and sweet we
[3360.12 - 3364.72] could release it for like $10 or
[3362.87 - 3368.12] [Music]
[3364.72 - 3370.48] something we could possibly talk to an
[3368.12 - 3373.12] and rage and see if they want to do it
[3370.48 - 3374.76] through medical medium like we could
[3373.12 - 3377.76] design the whole thing but they could
[3374.76 - 3381.04] release it as an MMA ebook or something
[3377.76 - 3384.00] so much more reach that
[3381.04 - 3386.68] way again this was taking place during
[3384.00 - 3389.04] the time that Stephanie was sick instead
[3386.68 - 3391.24] of visiting Stephanie Ashley was using
[3389.04 - 3393.00] that time trying to become something in
[3391.24 - 3396.08] the health industry using the medical
[3393.00 - 3400.32] medium name another text she sent to the
[3396.08 - 3404.24] same friend on March 27th of 2018
[3400.32 - 3407.08] reads I know I wrote a whole book last
[3404.24 - 3412.44] year and then realized I had to do a
[3407.08 - 3412.44] proposal and still haven't started
[3412.64 - 3419.76] lol on May 15th of 2018 the friend asked
[3417.16 - 3421.56] when is your ebook launch so exciting
[3419.76 - 3425.52] and Ashley
[3421.56 - 3428.84] replied hm probably in another two weeks
[3425.52 - 3431.56] or so I know so much exciting stuff
[3428.84 - 3434.80] these days I'm cooking for Gretchen's
[3431.56 - 3437.60] retreat in October I decided to host the
[3434.80 - 3440.92] one-day cooking class of my very own
[3437.60 - 3443.96] this August and the
[3440.92 - 3446.72] ebook I'm talking to an agent today
[3443.96 - 3451.00] about doing my own cookbook we're
[3446.72 - 3453.40] remodeling the playroom and the yard my
[3451.00 - 3456.64] head is
[3453.40 - 3458.60] spinning around this time Ashley had
[3456.64 - 3461.28] asked me to co-author a medical medium
[3458.60 - 3462.72] recipe book with her and I said no and
[3461.28 - 3465.32] turned her
[3462.72 - 3467.16] down it looks like after Ashley got
[3465.32 - 3469.24] turned down on co-authoring a medical
[3467.16 - 3471.96] medium book Ashley then went around
[3469.24 - 3474.88] trying to pursue a book deal on her
[3471.96 - 3477.28] own and Ashley was desperately trying to
[3474.88 - 3481.08] grow a following on social media here is
[3477.28 - 3481.08] a text she sent to a friend in
[3481.28 - 3485.84] 2017 had a meeting with a marketing
[3483.76 - 3488.84] consultant
[3485.84 - 3491.28] yesterday the friend responded by asking
[3488.84 - 3493.68] is this for your brand for your book and
[3491.28 - 3493.68] Ashley
[3493.92 - 3499.16] replied I basically just have to get my
[3496.60 - 3503.08] numbers up before I post all the random
[3499.16 - 3505.56] baby photos and stuff yeah every time I
[3503.08 - 3509.56] post something other than food I lose
[3505.56 - 3513.28] about 10 followers which adds up so I
[3509.56 - 3517.64] have to sort of streamline and
[3513.28 - 3520.72] focus in the same text thread Ashley
[3517.64 - 3523.32] said up for a little friendly
[3520.72 - 3525.88] competition I just want to like I don't
[3523.32 - 3528.84] know I need some inspiration to get
[3525.88 - 3530.32] serious about growing my insta so I
[3528.84 - 3533.44] thought you might be down for a little
[3530.32 - 3538.04] challenge like first one to gain 10K or
[3533.44 - 3538.04] something we can put some fun Stakes on
[3538.84 - 3543.32] Ashley was regularly asking this person
[3541.24 - 3546.68] for advice on how to grow her social
[3543.32 - 3550.56] media following in another text she
[3546.68 - 3552.80] asked question did your IG growth slow
[3550.56 - 3555.32] down so much because your only posting
[3552.80 - 3558.92] less frequently how many times do you
[3555.32 - 3562.64] think one needs to post to
[3558.92 - 3565.48] grow after receiving advice Ashley said
[3562.64 - 3566.60] this okay I've been trying to post once
[3565.48 - 3569.20] a day
[3566.60 - 3572.24] and I like lose followers at that rate
[3569.20 - 3574.56] LOL it seems like if you start a YouTube
[3572.24 - 3577.52] channel you get way more followers
[3574.56 - 3577.52] without posting as
[3577.88 - 3583.80] much after receiving advice again a
[3580.96 - 3586.72] couple days later Ashley said
[3583.80 - 3589.48] this I finally have been consistent
[3586.72 - 3592.32] enough with insta where I'm not losing
[3589.48 - 3595.12] followers at least once a day posting
[3592.32 - 3598.28] results in like super slow growth like
[3595.12 - 3601.32] 10 new a day or
[3598.28 - 3604.04] so on a later date frustrated with not
[3601.32 - 3606.64] seeing the growth she so desired Ashley
[3604.04 - 3606.64] sent this
[3608.32 - 3617.32] text I'm posting twice a day on IG
[3612.60 - 3619.80] really top quality photos and seeing no
[3617.32 - 3622.24] growth she got some more advice from
[3619.80 - 3624.20] this person on Switching up her hashtags
[3622.24 - 3626.84] and then several hours later Ashley
[3624.20 - 3629.24] texted back
[3626.84 - 3631.84] okay I changed them up to see if it
[3629.24 - 3633.80] helps got a little boost from switching
[3631.84 - 3636.60] them
[3633.80 - 3639.16] up okay so Ashley had a meeting with an
[3636.60 - 3640.72] agent about getting herself a book deal
[3639.16 - 3642.68] Ashley had a meeting with a marketing
[3640.72 - 3644.76] consultant and then she was trying
[3642.68 - 3647.48] really hard to grow her social media
[3644.76 - 3650.08] following Anthony can you explain for
[3647.48 - 3652.92] listeners how book deals work and why
[3650.08 - 3655.48] this was so important to her it was a
[3652.92 - 3657.80] different world back in 2018 it was
[3655.48 - 3660.28] before influencers could become famous
[3657.80 - 3663.48] on social media you either got somewhere
[3660.28 - 3666.04] on television acting music getting
[3663.48 - 3668.84] signed in a record deal something in
[3666.04 - 3671.68] sports or in publishing getting a book
[3668.84 - 3673.56] deal maybe it was before the time period
[3671.68 - 3675.04] we living in now where someone hits
[3673.56 - 3677.92] their grandmother over the head with a
[3675.04 - 3679.40] 2x4 and gets 20 million views and the
[3677.92 - 3682.00] person who hit the grandmother over the
[3679.40 - 3685.20] head with a 2x4 has endorsement deals
[3682.00 - 3687.60] the world has changed Ashley was
[3685.20 - 3690.56] desperate to to get a book deal
[3687.60 - 3692.76] desperate to become somebody Ashley
[3690.56 - 3696.08] wanted to co-author a book with me she
[3692.76 - 3698.92] was very entitled and raised that way
[3696.08 - 3702.12] and she expected to co-author a book
[3698.92 - 3705.00] with me she expected it I said no for a
[3702.12 - 3708.00] multitude of reasons and I'm so glad I
[3705.00 - 3710.84] said no because this is the kind of
[3708.00 - 3713.32] person she is back then I noticed that
[3710.84 - 3715.60] when I spoke to Ashley she would say
[3713.32 - 3717.92] something and then the second time she
[3715.60 - 3720.92] said said it it would be different I
[3717.92 - 3723.20] didn't trust her I said no so Ashley
[3720.92 - 3725.48] tried to get a book deal on her own and
[3723.20 - 3728.28] in order to get a book deal on her own
[3725.48 - 3730.28] she needed a certain number of followers
[3728.28 - 3732.80] so Ashley was trying to learn from
[3730.28 - 3734.84] people like Robbie her best friend one
[3732.80 - 3737.72] of the other plotters how to build
[3734.84 - 3740.52] followers on her Instagram
[3737.72 - 3742.08] Facebook that makes sense so clearly
[3740.52 - 3744.56] Ashley was trying to make a name for
[3742.08 - 3747.28] herself and build a platform for herself
[3744.56 - 3750.28] she ultimately wanted to be famous she
[3747.28 - 3751.64] was definitely also trying to make money
[3750.28 - 3753.40] the claims Ashley made when she was
[3751.64 - 3755.28] trying to get people to trust her with
[3753.40 - 3757.32] her fake Stephanie story that she never
[3755.28 - 3759.68] made money off of her Instagram and
[3757.32 - 3762.76] intentionally never did because of how
[3759.68 - 3765.96] much she quote values the truth are
[3762.76 - 3769.36] Flatout lies Ashley was using Instagram
[3765.96 - 3771.00] to sell ebooks Retreats bundles and more
[3769.36 - 3773.56] and let's be clear making money off of
[3771.00 - 3775.64] Instagram is fine that's not the problem
[3773.56 - 3778.72] but why did Ashley feel the need to lie
[3775.64 - 3780.52] about about it furthermore Ashley even
[3778.72 - 3783.16] tried to pursue another Avenue for
[3780.52 - 3785.84] profit by offering to invest in a brand
[3783.16 - 3789.16] that Anthony endorses here is the text
[3785.84 - 3792.72] she had sent to the owner of that
[3789.16 - 3794.68] company also bear this in mind if you
[3792.72 - 3797.44] ever decide you want to do a big push
[3794.68 - 3800.48] with vimergy and take on some investment
[3797.44 - 3803.72] and try and grow it up quick let me know
[3800.48 - 3803.72] I do it with y'all in a
[3803.80 - 3809.60] heartbeat there you have it Ashley got
[3806.48 - 3813.92] turned down on this proposal as
[3809.60 - 3817.00] well Ashley Foster always gets her way
[3813.92 - 3820.44] no one's allowed to tell Ashley no if
[3817.00 - 3823.52] they do Ashley will turn on them anyone
[3820.44 - 3824.96] who tells her no will pay the price it's
[3823.52 - 3827.92] who she
[3824.96 - 3830.16] is not only did Ashley eagerly want to
[3827.92 - 3832.72] invest in vimergy but this is also a
[3830.16 - 3834.96] company that has products that before
[3832.72 - 3837.28] Ashley got upset and turned on everyone
[3834.96 - 3840.48] Ashley said she used every day and that
[3837.28 - 3841.20] helped her hair quote grow in so thick
[3840.48 - 3843.76] and
[3841.20 - 3845.88] shiny now after being turned down by
[3843.76 - 3848.12] them years ago Ashley and her hateful
[3845.88 - 3849.80] group repeatedly attacked this company
[3848.12 - 3852.48] along with Anthony and the medical
[3849.80 - 3854.88] medium Community after we released the
[3852.48 - 3856.44] plotter podcast episodes last year in
[3854.88 - 3859.60] another post Ashley made as she was
[3856.44 - 3862.48] trying to say face she said this
[3859.60 - 3864.84] something that really bothers me is how
[3862.48 - 3867.48] Anthony claimed in his podcast that we
[3864.84 - 3869.76] were doing this for money but at the
[3867.48 - 3873.00] same time claims that we must be part of
[3869.76 - 3875.56] some evil plot because we have money
[3873.00 - 3875.56] which one is
[3875.64 - 3882.36] it this is inaccurate if you listen back
[3880.04 - 3885.40] this instead is what was actually said
[3882.36 - 3885.40] in our first podcast
[3885.44 - 3890.60] episode what I learned is that the
[3888.68 - 3894.00] strategy of this group is to try to
[3890.60 - 3896.24] capture people like those young women
[3894.00 - 3898.12] with a manipulated story
[3896.24 - 3900.44] of a deceased person who isn't here
[3898.12 - 3902.04] anymore to speak for herself or to
[3900.44 - 3904.32] defend the truth of what actually
[3902.04 - 3906.48] happened they might throw in some other
[3904.32 - 3908.20] random misinformation to add to their
[3906.48 - 3910.88] story of why you shouldn't trust medical
[3908.20 - 3913.32] medium because they try to act like they
[3910.88 - 3915.72] have some special information that you
[3913.32 - 3917.56] just don't know even though all these
[3915.72 - 3919.08] people still admitted to applying
[3917.56 - 3921.04] medical medium information into their
[3919.08 - 3923.72] own lives yet they say that they don't
[3921.04 - 3925.20] trust you they just don't they they
[3923.72 - 3926.68] explicitly say that they don't credit
[3925.20 - 3930.00] the source they use it and don't credit
[3926.68 - 3932.08] the source and I literally heard them
[3930.00 - 3935.28] out on all of their points for a total
[3932.08 - 3937.56] of over 17 hours and I can tell you that
[3935.28 - 3939.40] everything that they think they have is
[3937.56 - 3941.44] a bunch of Twisted
[3939.40 - 3944.00] misinformation their false narrative
[3941.44 - 3946.60] story is the guys that they're using but
[3944.00 - 3949.00] what these calls also made clear to me
[3946.60 - 3951.40] is that some of these sources are part
[3949.00 - 3954.08] of this plan because they're actually
[3951.40 - 3956.64] being driven by some of it is misplaced
[3954.08 - 3960.12] grief some of it is is people being
[3956.64 - 3962.28] driven by guilt but most of them
[3960.12 - 3964.16] disturbingly are being driven by
[3962.28 - 3966.20] self-interests and what they would stand
[3964.16 - 3969.96] to gain financially and otherwise from
[3966.20 - 3969.96] the impact of a medical medium
[3970.40 - 3975.84] takedown I stand by all of that Ashley
[3973.40 - 3978.88] always gets it wrong first as you can
[3975.84 - 3981.04] hear it was me who said this not Anthony
[3978.88 - 3983.16] hi Ashley I did not say that you were a
[3981.04 - 3984.88] part of a plot because you have money
[3983.16 - 3986.92] your friend Taylor called you out for
[3984.88 - 3990.32] having a lot of money like private jet
[3986.92 - 3992.88] plus her words I said that I suspected
[3990.32 - 3994.36] that the plotters had mixed motives we
[3992.88 - 3996.08] didn't mention the fact that some of
[3994.36 - 3998.24] them have money and some of them don't
[3996.08 - 3999.80] have money and there are plenty of
[3998.24 - 4001.84] extremely wealthy people out there
[3999.80 - 4003.80] including billionaires and Daughters of
[4001.84 - 4006.60] billionaires who never stop wanting to
[4003.80 - 4009.56] make more money what Ashley said is a
[4006.60 - 4012.12] false dichotomy in fact Ashley knows
[4009.56 - 4015.08] that this is a false dichotomy in text
[4012.12 - 4016.92] messages she sent to a friend in 2017
[4015.08 - 4019.48] Ashley used the following words to
[4016.92 - 4021.40] describe her own father who had long
[4019.48 - 4023.76] since been a billionaire and his
[4021.40 - 4023.76] business
[4024.24 - 4029.88] dealings he's trying to build something
[4026.96 - 4032.96] bigger and bigger and bigger I think
[4029.88 - 4035.72] he's just addicted to the game he's a
[4032.96 - 4039.72] real true addict the rush of the
[4035.72 - 4042.24] gambling element is so addictive to
[4039.72 - 4044.28] him while Ashley was applying medical
[4042.24 - 4046.44] medium information she wanted to do
[4044.28 - 4049.20] high-profit retreats without dipping
[4046.44 - 4051.72] into her trust fund admitting in that
[4049.20 - 4054.76] very text that she has money but that
[4051.72 - 4056.44] she wants to make more Ashley was
[4054.76 - 4058.44] selling eBooks she was working with
[4056.44 - 4060.56] bundle companies she wanted to be an
[4058.44 - 4062.16] author she was meeting with marketing
[4060.56 - 4063.80] consultants she wanted to grow a
[4062.16 - 4065.96] following she wanted to run the medical
[4063.80 - 4068.04] medium YouTube channel for 50% of the
[4065.96 - 4070.92] earnings she wanted to have a stake in a
[4068.04 - 4073.72] company endorsed by medical medium and
[4070.92 - 4076.16] more Ashley also talked about wanting to
[4073.72 - 4079.48] do a positive medical medium documentary
[4076.16 - 4082.52] on Me on the light blast years ago she
[4079.48 - 4083.68] had her sight set on it she was obsessed
[4082.52 - 4086.24] with
[4083.68 - 4088.24] it okay so this is going to be shocking
[4086.24 - 4091.20] for people listening to hear to hear
[4088.24 - 4093.68] that so Ashley has wanted to make a
[4091.20 - 4096.16] documentary in some way shape or form
[4093.68 - 4099.00] about you for a long time this goes way
[4096.16 - 4101.28] back one of the most interesting things
[4099.00 - 4103.16] I've seen from Ashley is that one of her
[4101.28 - 4106.08] longest standing goals has been to
[4103.16 - 4108.84] become successful specifically in the
[4106.08 - 4111.36] film industry in a blog post Ashley
[4108.84 - 4115.80] wrote in 2010 she described a rule book
[4111.36 - 4118.64] she had for herself one of her rules was
[4115.80 - 4121.92] this right did you write
[4118.64 - 4124.16] today right and the writing you do today
[4121.92 - 4127.32] must eventually lead to a successful
[4124.16 - 4127.32] career in the film
[4128.24 - 4132.68] industry as you just heard Ashley has
[4130.92 - 4136.04] always wanted to be successful in the
[4132.68 - 4138.24] film industry Ashley's husband is also a
[4136.04 - 4141.12] documentary cinematographer I'm sure
[4138.24 - 4143.20] that he wants to be well known for that
[4141.12 - 4145.20] can you describe for everyone Anthony
[4143.20 - 4147.24] what the proposal that Ashley made to
[4145.20 - 4149.12] you years ago for a positive medical
[4147.24 - 4152.40] medium documentary was
[4149.12 - 4154.60] like Ashley was so fixated I wanting to
[4152.40 - 4157.28] do a documentary she asked me about it
[4154.60 - 4160.20] first on the phone she asked a mutual
[4157.28 - 4162.44] friend about it over and over again that
[4160.20 - 4165.44] mutual friend brought it up to my wife
[4162.44 - 4168.04] and I again and was in conversation with
[4165.44 - 4170.12] Ashley about it Ashley wanted to write
[4168.04 - 4172.40] and control the content of the
[4170.12 - 4175.16] documentary she wanted her husband to
[4172.40 - 4177.68] film it and she wanted her sister to
[4175.16 - 4180.56] edit it over the years I've been
[4177.68 - 4182.96] approached many times by big producers
[4180.56 - 4185.48] media companies and networks about doing
[4182.96 - 4187.60] a medical medium documentary or TV show
[4185.48 - 4189.92] my wife and I thought it'd be great to
[4187.60 - 4191.56] get people's healing stories and more
[4189.92 - 4194.76] information out there to help the
[4191.56 - 4197.28] chronically ill at some point but we
[4194.76 - 4200.00] wouldn't have have gone to Ashley to do
[4197.28 - 4202.32] a documentary we entertained Ashley's
[4200.00 - 4205.56] ideas but then we quickly became
[4202.32 - 4208.80] concerned about what Ashley was
[4205.56 - 4211.00] saying so I have that text thread in
[4208.80 - 4213.12] front of me your wife initiates a
[4211.00 - 4214.92] conversation with Ashley about it after
[4213.12 - 4217.32] Ashley had been prodding about doing a
[4214.92 - 4218.76] documentary for a while Ashley says that
[4217.32 - 4221.12] she had thought about doing the
[4218.76 - 4223.72] documentary idea a lot and then she gets
[4221.12 - 4225.72] into her proposal she starts describing
[4223.72 - 4227.72] some of her ideas
[4225.72 - 4230.64] I like the idea of following a new
[4227.72 - 4233.28] client we could even fake that part of
[4230.64 - 4233.28] it
[4233.52 - 4239.00] LOL it can be an actor that recreates a
[4236.36 - 4241.52] storyline that is true that's frequently
[4239.00 - 4241.52] done for
[4242.28 - 4247.40] documentaries this sounds super sketchy
[4245.44 - 4248.84] very weird of Ashley to suggest being
[4247.40 - 4250.64] dishonest and to say that that's
[4248.84 - 4253.04] frequently done in
[4250.64 - 4256.00] documentaries after your wife politely
[4253.04 - 4257.92] responds interesting Ashley right away
[4256.00 - 4261.72] changes her mind on the idea that she
[4257.92 - 4265.16] herself just presented the actor idea is
[4261.72 - 4271.32] no good if someone got wind of it it
[4265.16 - 4271.32] would be real bad but it is common
[4271.64 - 4277.08] LOL these were more signs we saw
[4274.60 - 4281.84] firsthand of Ashley being manipulative
[4277.08 - 4284.16] and dishonest it made us really really
[4281.84 - 4286.12] uncomfortable right after Ashley's last
[4284.16 - 4288.56] message your wife changed es the subject
[4286.12 - 4290.52] and ends the documentary conversation so
[4288.56 - 4294.20] I'm guessing you guys had turned her
[4290.52 - 4297.00] down on that sketchy proposal as well
[4294.20 - 4299.48] yeah in the nicest way possible she kept
[4297.00 - 4300.92] asking about it and prodding and it's
[4299.48 - 4304.48] something we were never going to do with
[4300.92 - 4306.68] her we didn't want to disappoint Ashley
[4304.48 - 4309.88] but we just were not on the same page
[4306.68 - 4312.72] about it at all for Ashley to suggest
[4309.88 - 4316.12] altering a documentary so it becomes
[4312.72 - 4318.60] dishonest was unimaginable for a medical
[4316.12 - 4321.96] medium documentary we were sitting there
[4318.60 - 4325.04] wondering why on Earth is Ashley telling
[4321.96 - 4328.44] us this is how you do a documentary you
[4325.04 - 4330.68] fabricated in a dishonest way this was a
[4328.44 - 4334.44] shocker to
[4330.68 - 4336.80] us yeah so Ashley wanted her hand in
[4334.44 - 4339.36] every pot with you I'm sure that she saw
[4336.80 - 4340.68] you as a ticket to success everybody
[4339.36 - 4342.96] knows that you're one of the biggest
[4340.68 - 4344.88] Health authors in the world Ashley was
[4342.96 - 4346.20] trying to use the medical medium name to
[4344.88 - 4348.00] get her herself and her husband
[4346.20 - 4351.20] somewhere and she ended up getting
[4348.00 - 4353.76] turned down from basically every angle
[4351.20 - 4355.28] Ashley had spent years trying to pursue
[4353.76 - 4357.92] all these different Avenues and they
[4355.28 - 4360.20] were unsuccessful Ashley was struggling
[4357.92 - 4362.44] to grow a following she got turned down
[4360.20 - 4364.76] on co-authoring a book with you getting
[4362.44 - 4366.80] a book deal on her own evidently didn't
[4364.76 - 4369.16] work out she got turned down on
[4366.80 - 4371.16] investing in a company endorsed by you
[4369.16 - 4373.08] the medical medium YouTube channel deal
[4371.16 - 4375.76] that Ashley proposed didn't work out for
[4373.08 - 4377.80] her she got turned down on her proposal
[4375.76 - 4380.12] to partner with you to do medical medium
[4377.80 - 4382.88] Retreats her independent Retreat only
[4380.12 - 4385.20] filled 12 spots Ashley never made it in
[4382.88 - 4387.20] the film industry like she wanted to she
[4385.20 - 4389.08] got turned down on her proposal to do an
[4387.20 - 4391.04] inspirational documentary about medical
[4389.08 - 4393.64] medium that she wanted her husband to
[4391.04 - 4397.44] film and her sister to
[4393.64 - 4399.36] edit was Ashley upset with you I mean
[4397.44 - 4402.16] how did she respond to all of this
[4399.36 - 4405.16] rejection at the time she was
[4402.16 - 4407.64] disappointed and frustrated Ashley
[4405.16 - 4410.40] wanted desperately to have a hand in
[4407.64 - 4412.80] Everything Medical medium everything she
[4410.40 - 4415.52] wanted a piece of everything I was doing
[4412.80 - 4417.96] and now look what she's doing because
[4415.52 - 4421.08] she didn't get her way Ashley's not used
[4417.96 - 4423.80] to being told no it's an entitlement and
[4421.08 - 4426.04] an ego thing when Ashley realized she
[4423.80 - 4428.00] wasn't going to be able to get all of
[4426.04 - 4431.20] these high-profile business deals with
[4428.00 - 4433.20] me she flipped the switch was flipped
[4431.20 - 4435.76] and she started making things up that
[4433.20 - 4437.96] didn't exist she started Ed working on
[4435.76 - 4440.32] her false storylines and any
[4437.96 - 4442.84] communication she had with me of any
[4440.32 - 4445.28] kind or anybody I was associated with
[4442.84 - 4447.48] she started to try to twist and rewrite
[4445.28 - 4450.60] history so she could tell people a
[4447.48 - 4452.92] disturbing story that never existed and
[4450.60 - 4457.08] then she decided to take her stories to
[4452.92 - 4457.08] the media to try to hurt me and the
[4457.12 - 4461.88] community and you turned her down on
[4459.84 - 4464.60] these deals years ago because you had
[4461.88 - 4466.80] concerns about her intentions I turned
[4464.60 - 4469.32] her down for multiple reasons first of
[4466.80 - 4471.68] all every time someone I knew would talk
[4469.32 - 4473.48] to Ashley they would be left shaking
[4471.68 - 4475.40] their heads because it seemed that
[4473.48 - 4478.88] nothing that came out of Ashley's mouth
[4475.40 - 4482.44] was totally accurate she was 50/50 at
[4478.88 - 4486.16] best 50% mixed in accurate things with
[4482.44 - 4488.44] 50% mixed in completely wrong inaccurate
[4486.16 - 4490.64] information and it was obvious to me
[4488.44 - 4492.48] that Ashley was only wanting to be
[4490.64 - 4495.00] involved with medical medium because of
[4492.48 - 4497.92] her wanting to start a business invol
[4495.00 - 4500.76] olving me or use me to launch her
[4497.92 - 4503.24] business and I knew this about Ashley
[4500.76 - 4506.16] it's not that I'm saying it's bad she
[4503.24 - 4509.00] wants to become somebody it's bad that
[4506.16 - 4513.12] her desire was to become somebody using
[4509.00 - 4515.32] me and then when I said no afterwards
[4513.12 - 4517.60] trying to destroy the medical medium
[4515.32 - 4520.92] community and me because she didn't get
[4517.60 - 4523.20] her way even if there was a world where
[4520.92 - 4525.88] I was naive enough to give Ashley all
[4523.20 - 4529.16] that she wanted a book deal with me big
[4525.88 - 4532.48] Retreats with my name on them $750,000
[4529.16 - 4535.88] like pop documentaries for her and her
[4532.48 - 4537.76] husband money made from those Ventures
[4535.88 - 4539.76] which could have equated to Millions
[4537.76 - 4542.40] would have been taken from the community
[4539.76 - 4545.24] and not invested back into the community
[4542.40 - 4548.12] on any level it would have been selfs
[4545.24 - 4551.16] serving as we'll cover later on Ashley
[4548.12 - 4553.80] is so cheap she wouldn't buy Stephanie a
[4551.16 - 4556.16] coach plane ticket to help Stephanie get
[4553.80 - 4559.00] out to Ashley's family is Pebble Beach
[4556.16 - 4561.32] mansion and money that I've made from
[4559.00 - 4563.80] working around the clock a big portion
[4561.32 - 4566.44] of that money goes back into producing
[4563.80 - 4568.12] free everything for the community if
[4566.44 - 4570.80] there was a world where I was naive
[4568.12 - 4573.56] enough to let Ashley go into multiple
[4570.80 - 4574.76] business deals with me all that money
[4573.56 - 4577.12] would have been
[4574.76 - 4579.28] squandered Penny pinched and
[4577.12 - 4581.48] self-serving for her children and her
[4579.28 - 4583.92] lifestyle so that she can have expensive
[4581.48 - 4586.92] vacations and grandiose dinners with
[4583.92 - 4588.76] friends all all while I will still be
[4586.92 - 4591.04] standing in my kitchen eating a steamed
[4588.76 - 4593.96] potato standing up working 20 hours a
[4591.04 - 4598.12] day to get the next book out so people
[4593.96 - 4599.88] can heal an example of how Ashley works
[4598.12 - 4603.08] is that she wanted to make all this
[4599.88 - 4605.92] money from you the community that
[4603.08 - 4608.88] doesn't have money so she's didn't have
[4605.92 - 4612.00] to touch her trust fund a trust fund
[4608.88 - 4614.24] with an exorbitant amount of money in it
[4612.00 - 4616.84] it would have been unfair to the
[4614.24 - 4620.32] community that Ashley was making a
[4616.84 - 4622.44] killing off their backs I could not live
[4620.32 - 4624.88] with that so I chose not to do a
[4622.44 - 4627.32] documentry with her I chose not to let
[4624.88 - 4629.36] her co-author books with me and I chose
[4627.32 - 4632.20] not to go into the retreat business with
[4629.36 - 4635.24] her using my name Ashley would have made
[4632.20 - 4638.44] a killing so that she could avoid using
[4635.24 - 4641.08] her trust fund from her billionaire
[4638.44 - 4643.64] father now after I turned her down and
[4641.08 - 4645.44] she didn't get what she wanted Ashley is
[4643.64 - 4648.60] trying to become famous
[4645.44 - 4651.16] through pretending to be a whistleblower
[4648.60 - 4653.72] spreading lies false claims and
[4651.16 - 4656.80] disinformation and trying to frame me
[4653.72 - 4659.72] along with her partner Tony tazone
[4656.80 - 4662.52] Stephanie's brother who as one of the
[4659.72 - 4665.08] plotters said is just looking for
[4662.52 - 4668.04] someone to blame according to another
[4665.08 - 4671.12] plotter Tony has multiple fake accounts
[4668.04 - 4674.28] on social media platforms and he may not
[4671.12 - 4675.76] realize it but he's doing Ashley's
[4674.28 - 4678.56] bidding
[4675.76 - 4680.88] she's stoking the Flames of his grief
[4678.56 - 4683.72] and anger and Tony doesn't know why
[4680.88 - 4686.92] Ashley's really on this Mission she's
[4683.72 - 4689.56] using him Ashley has recruited other
[4686.92 - 4692.72] people to spread her lies for her we
[4689.56 - 4694.60] have Insider information that she's
[4692.72 - 4698.16] promising the people who are supporting
[4694.60 - 4700.84] her a spot in a documentary ultimately
[4698.16 - 4703.48] Ashley's goal is now to make it
[4700.84 - 4705.64] somewhere in the film industry by trying
[4703.48 - 4708.12] to get a deal for negative hitpiece
[4705.64 - 4711.92] documentary about me and to take the
[4708.12 - 4714.28] medical mum Community down in the
[4711.92 - 4715.60] process I also want to ask you this
[4714.28 - 4718.84] because I know that there will be people
[4715.60 - 4721.92] out there wondering about spirit and if
[4718.84 - 4724.92] Ashley was capable of all of this
[4721.92 - 4726.52] spinning stories and lying to harm you
[4724.92 - 4729.84] and attacking the medical medium
[4726.52 - 4731.52] Community then can you explain why why
[4729.84 - 4734.40] did spirit let you engage with her at
[4731.52 - 4735.32] all Spirit told me not to engage with
[4734.40 - 4738.40] Ashley
[4735.32 - 4742.12] and I voiced that to my friends Ashley
[4738.40 - 4744.56] was a friend of a friend I communicated
[4742.12 - 4747.40] with Ashley very little I kept her at
[4744.56 - 4750.12] arms length when I got off the phone
[4747.40 - 4753.32] after one of my first calls with her I
[4750.12 - 4756.44] said to my wife no she is not a good
[4753.32 - 4760.40] person she seems empty and soulless and
[4756.44 - 4763.16] not genuine and spirit's given me a
[4760.40 - 4765.20] warning but I gave it a chance because I
[4763.16 - 4767.88] always keep faith that people will heal
[4765.20 - 4770.84] their mental state Spirit gave me the
[4767.88 - 4773.84] potential that Ashley could be an
[4770.84 - 4776.00] ill-intentioned person but you can only
[4773.84 - 4778.72] hope that someone uses their free will
[4776.00 - 4781.60] to do good things and not harmful things
[4778.72 - 4783.80] despicable things abusive things and I
[4781.60 - 4785.56] didn't want to let a mutual friend down
[4783.80 - 4788.84] who was wanting me to connect with
[4785.56 - 4792.48] Ashley for somebody that said I saved
[4788.84 - 4795.84] her and her sister's life and to turn so
[4792.48 - 4798.88] dark and to lie so much really brings me
[4795.84 - 4801.52] a new understanding of what people can
[4798.88 - 4803.88] be I mean you expect out there in the
[4801.52 - 4807.76] world for things to go wrong but you
[4803.88 - 4811.24] never expect a mom to be so conniving
[4807.76 - 4814.84] and just plain evil she built the whole
[4811.24 - 4817.20] thing off of originally I never told
[4814.84 - 4820.92] Stephanie to see a doctor which was a
[4817.20 - 4823.64] lie that alone is sick if you think or
[4820.92 - 4826.96] falsities lies and fabricated stories
[4823.64 - 4828.92] about me are harmful and ridiculous now
[4826.96 - 4831.40] what would have happened if I didn't
[4828.92 - 4834.28] keep Ashley at arms
[4831.40 - 4836.96] length I mean just in what we've exposed
[4834.28 - 4839.24] in this episode alone Ashley has been
[4836.96 - 4841.32] wildly dishonest about her wealth she
[4839.24 - 4843.68] said quote there's nothing crazy going
[4841.32 - 4846.56] on over here when she is in fact the
[4843.68 - 4850.12] daughter of a late multibillionaire with
[4846.56 - 4852.56] cars and homes and planes all over the
[4850.12 - 4854.96] world and she grew up in a mansion
[4852.56 - 4858.56] according to the Daily Beast next door
[4854.96 - 4861.36] to former US President George W
[4858.56 - 4863.64] bush just a good old humble nextdoor
[4861.36 - 4866.12] neighbor nothing crazy going on over
[4863.64 - 4868.32] here she lied about not having a private
[4866.12 - 4870.40] jet she lied about not having vacation
[4868.32 - 4873.04] homes she lied about not making money
[4870.40 - 4874.88] off of Instagram she lied about never
[4873.04 - 4878.80] having the intention to make money off
[4874.88 - 4880.68] of Instagram Ashley in fact had every
[4878.80 - 4883.32] intention to make money off of per
[4880.68 - 4886.32] Instagram and also specifically to
[4883.32 - 4888.44] repeatedly make 200 $40,000 off of the
[4886.32 - 4890.76] medical medium Community without dipping
[4888.44 - 4893.56] into her trust fund by doing Retreats
[4890.76 - 4895.88] two months out of the year plus to gain
[4893.56 - 4897.80] a whole lot more money and fame off of
[4895.88 - 4900.24] other Ventures she wanted you to set up
[4897.80 - 4903.32] for her Ashley lied about having No
[4900.24 - 4905.68] Agenda her agenda is Despicable and
[4903.32 - 4907.92] Crystal Clear for everyone to see
[4905.68 - 4909.64] Stephanie was sick for two whole years
[4907.92 - 4912.12] and despite Ashley having all of the
[4909.64 - 4914.60] means in the world the convenience of a
[4912.12 - 4916.92] private jet that even went directly to
[4914.60 - 4919.12] Pennsylvania where Stephanie lived and
[4916.92 - 4921.80] somehow the time to be able to travel
[4919.12 - 4923.92] for other purposes like to host Retreats
[4921.80 - 4927.36] that she was trying to make money off
[4923.92 - 4929.92] of Ashley did not visit Stephanie
[4927.36 - 4933.04] once what Ashley's doing is not about
[4929.92 - 4935.52] Stephanie Ashley has exploited and used
[4933.04 - 4937.80] Stephanie now along with multiple others
[4935.52 - 4939.64] as well and because her Twisted
[4937.80 - 4942.28] Stephanie story didn't do the damage she
[4939.64 - 4944.64] desperately wanted it to Ashley's now
[4942.28 - 4947.32] twisting and manipulating and spinning
[4944.64 - 4949.24] more stories whatever she can do to harm
[4947.32 - 4951.88] you and the
[4949.24 - 4953.08] community Ashley has a vendetta against
[4951.88 - 4955.76] you because she didn't get what she
[4953.08 - 4958.04] wanted from you that's clear she didn't
[4955.76 - 4960.88] get the success the fame The Retreat
[4958.04 - 4962.88] deal the book deal the followers or the
[4960.88 - 4964.96] positive documentary deal that she
[4962.88 - 4966.88] wanted and now that she didn't get what
[4964.96 - 4969.32] she wanted from you she's running a
[4966.88 - 4971.24] smear campaign against you and still out
[4969.32 - 4973.48] there obsessively now wanting to do a
[4971.24 - 4975.00] negative hitpiece documentary about you
[4973.48 - 4976.44] so that she can become famous and
[4975.00 - 4979.16] successful that
[4976.44 - 4982.08] way this isn't some whistleblower who
[4979.16 - 4984.76] walked away because of Integrity Ashley
[4982.08 - 4986.68] is trying hard to convince her followers
[4984.76 - 4989.76] that she is such an honest and
[4986.68 - 4991.76] transparent person yet Ashley has not
[4989.76 - 4993.84] publicly disclosed the fact that she had
[4991.76 - 4997.04] every desire to make money and become
[4993.84 - 4999.20] somebody using medical medium Ashley has
[4997.04 - 5001.16] not disclosed the fact that she made all
[4999.20 - 5003.72] of these business proposals to Anthony
[5001.16 - 5005.28] and that she got turned down all right
[5003.72 - 5006.64] around the same time as what was
[5005.28 - 5009.36] happening with
[5006.64 - 5010.92] Stephanie Ashley has not disclosed that
[5009.36 - 5012.76] she was still marketing and trying to
[5010.92 - 5015.36] sell Retreats using medical medium
[5012.76 - 5018.40] information to the community for over a
[5015.36 - 5020.76] year after Stephanie passed away and all
[5018.40 - 5024.16] the way up until literal weeks before
[5020.76 - 5027.36] she came out with her false story about
[5024.16 - 5029.76] Stephanie it's hard to think that Ashley
[5027.36 - 5031.96] is this motive driven person when she's
[5029.76 - 5035.04] breastfeeding or acting like she's this
[5031.96 - 5037.92] well-to-do authentic or honest mom
[5035.04 - 5041.48] it's really a good cover like she's just
[5037.92 - 5043.32] a whistleblower to stop a mean man the
[5041.48 - 5046.40] story she's telling people never
[5043.32 - 5049.76] happened but a mom who seems so honest
[5046.40 - 5052.28] in every sense it can win somebody over
[5049.76 - 5054.52] it can win a journalist over it can win
[5052.28 - 5056.92] other people over especially people who
[5054.52 - 5059.88] are looking for reason to not like me
[5056.92 - 5063.24] her cloak in Disguise is this wholesome
[5059.88 - 5066.00] mother with seemingly so much wisdom who
[5063.24 - 5068.76] cares so deeply about the world from the
[5066.00 - 5071.80] outside raises her children with the
[5068.76 - 5074.80] best of values and then she seeks out
[5071.80 - 5078.04] journalists they see this she puts on
[5074.80 - 5080.44] this front how can she be wrong
[5078.04 - 5082.64] influencers who weren't friends of mine
[5080.44 - 5085.28] but were acquaintances she would
[5082.64 - 5088.60] befriend them purposely to try to sell
[5085.28 - 5090.88] them these stories that I'm a fraud and
[5088.60 - 5094.04] she's worked really hard at it for years
[5090.88 - 5094.84] now and in reality the truth she has a
[5094.04 - 5097.36] condition
[5094.84 - 5100.12] either born out of jealousy and hatred
[5097.36 - 5102.80] towards me or just a different illness
[5100.12 - 5105.52] where she just can't help but to lie and
[5102.80 - 5108.44] makeup stories as you'll learn in these
[5105.52 - 5112.00] episodes to come Ashley can't get
[5108.44 - 5114.84] anything right or anything straight not
[5112.00 - 5117.60] just her own madeup stories but factual
[5114.84 - 5120.48] worldly understandings that can actually
[5117.60 - 5122.84] be fact checked and she'll still be
[5120.48 - 5125.64] completely off the
[5122.84 - 5127.68] mark we've only Only Just Begun exposing
[5125.64 - 5129.84] Ashley and her group so buckle your seat
[5127.68 - 5131.92] bels everybody and stay tuned for the

[5131.92 - 5137.00] series as we are in the process of
[5134.56 - 5138.96] exposing Ashley and her organized
[5137.00 - 5141.44] hateful group for who and what they
[5138.96 - 5143.36] really are it's important to take note
[5141.44 - 5145.92] of their tactics and patterns that are
[5143.36 - 5148.32] likely to follow the plotters have a
[5145.92 - 5151.40] documented history of initiating attacks
[5148.32 - 5153.68] using lies and misinformation and then
[5151.40 - 5156.76] upon getting called out and corrected
[5153.68 - 5159.40] trying to flip it and play victim that
[5156.76 - 5161.96] is not going to work here all this group
[5159.40 - 5164.20] has done is spread verifiable lies and
[5161.96 - 5166.88] falsities they've carelessly attacked
[5164.20 - 5169.04] and harmed many innocent people they've
[5166.88 - 5170.76] used and exploited deceased individuals
[5169.04 - 5173.52] and others in the process of trying to
[5170.76 - 5176.04] get what they want they've repeatedly
[5173.52 - 5177.88] explicitly expressed the intent to harm
[5176.04 - 5179.68] medical medium and they've even
[5177.88 - 5181.88] deliberately tried to stop Anthony from
[5179.68 - 5184.60] doing a free event to support and raise
[5181.88 - 5186.72] money for the community we have every
[5184.60 - 5189.20] right to set the record straight and to
[5186.72 - 5191.12] defend the truth with facts and evidence
[5189.20 - 5192.64] and to defend the chronically ill
[5191.12 - 5195.48] against the malicious attacks of this
[5192.64 - 5198.96] group and we are going to continue to do
[5195.48 - 5201.68] so we expect the plotters to evade and
[5198.96 - 5203.56] ignore what they have done wrong we
[5201.68 - 5206.48] expect them to continue to lie and
[5203.56 - 5209.48] spread falsities we expect them to Pivot
[5206.48 - 5212.64] onto something new they'll make up and
[5209.48 - 5214.84] we expect them to skew and alter data
[5212.64 - 5217.16] and to hide critical pie pieces of
[5214.84 - 5220.12] evidence that undermines their entire
[5217.16 - 5223.00] campaign we also expect the plotters to
[5220.12 - 5225.20] fabricate explanations as they do
[5223.00 - 5228.16] everything they can to try to discredit
[5225.20 - 5230.32] what we're exposing them for having done
[5228.16 - 5233.00] and said in their own
[5230.32 - 5235.88] words but we are using their own text
[5233.00 - 5239.60] messages voice messages social media
