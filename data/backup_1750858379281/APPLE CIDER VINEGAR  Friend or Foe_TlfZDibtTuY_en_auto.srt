time goes on

126
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,640

130
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,319
somebody else it gives them really bad

131
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,239
acid reflux like

132
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,720
they drink it they're like oh my god

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,320
someone can drink it and feel that way

141
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,479

you know i'm honored i want to look out

203
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:24,720
for you guys so i want to talk about

204
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,560
can you drink can you drink

205
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,080
apple cider vinegar or whether diluting

206
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,039
water or straight

207
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,639
can you do it with a straw first of all

208
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,919
you're going to hit the back molars no

209
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,280
matter what you stick a straw in your

210
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:37,120
mouth and you suck that stuff

211
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,639
up it's going to get somewhere it's

212
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,240
going to get on the back molars there's

213
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,759
no question it's going to get there

214
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,440
so that's number one you guys so

215
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,680
important to know number two is

216
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,479
unless you jam that straw so far down

217
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,759
your throat

218
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:51,599
and you actually try to suck that stuff

219
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,759
up from your glass through a straw with

220
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,599
a straw halfway down your throat

221
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,360
you're really not going to keep it away

222
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,319
from your teeth but that's not the

223
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,720
problem

224
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,759
it's not about it touching your teeth so

225
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,720
much

226
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:07,280
it's about it being in the body acetic

227
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,000
acid has a chemical reaction so it's not

228
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,360
just

229
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,759
when it touches something like teeth

230
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,800
it's not that it's the chemical reaction

231
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,160
that happens

232
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,280
inside the body trace mineral calcium we

233
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,919
rely on

234
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,360
to keep our bones strong so they stay

235
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,840
strong throughout the years

236
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,960
trace mineral calcium is how we keep our

237
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,120
bones strong

238
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,720
our teeth strong and what happens when

239
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,319
you put that acetic acid

240
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,759
i know a lot of people say what's acetic

241
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,840
acid what is that

242
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,880
well it's vinegar and a lot of people

243
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,720
say you know

244
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,639
how can i do this let me use a straw

245
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,840
that's not it when you dump the acetic

246
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,440
acid in your body

247
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,120
a chemical reaction happens throughout

248
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,360
your entire body

249
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,319
and then it starts to leach that's when

250
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,120
it could leech

251
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,240
calcium it can take your trace mineral

252
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,319
calcium away

253
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,319
so that that trace mineral calcium isn't

254
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,960
going into bones isn't going into place

255
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,319
it's like

256
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,599
okay you know vinegar use for decades

257
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,400
will lead you into

258
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:05,919
problems with your bones and teeth and

259
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,759
apple cider vinegar yeah it's from

00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:10,080
apples and i talked about in the episode

261
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,560
why it's good but you gotta listen

262
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,360

286
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,720
to get you off of apple cider vinegar

287
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,360

anthony william let me tell you what

291
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,000
happens when i tell you to get off apple

292
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,120
cider vinegar anthony william gets a lot

293
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,560
of crap so the only thing i have to gain

294
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,160
by getting you off your apple cider

295
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,279
vinegar is a whole

296
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,640
bunch of noise and crap and so

297
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,560
i don't like making my life more

298
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,160
difficult than it already is with all

299
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,640
the stuff i'm up against for putting out

300
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,200
truth

301
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,800
all the time constantly and it it goes

302
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,920
against the trends that are actually

303
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,320
backed by money

304
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,320
you guys know how it works but i have

305
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,680
nothing to gain by trying to actually

306
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,839
say

307
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,360
say hey stop doing your two tablespoons

308
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,600
apple cider vinegar every morning

309
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,680
stop doing this i have nothing what can

310
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,519
i gain besides a smack in the head

311
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,440
which i get anyway from all this stuff

312
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,839
like why do i want that anyway

313
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,640
bottom line okay let's go into what it

314
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,399
does your gastric glands this is

315
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,760
critical michelle l says people are

316
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:57,440
detailed oriented

317
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,519
laugh out loud um so people aren't

318
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,360
detailed oriented laughable laugh out

319
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,079
loud that i messed that up just now

320
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:06,000
uh read that wrong so listen you guys

321
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:08,959
your little stomach glands produce

322
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,680
hcl that's how you keep your bloating

323
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,320
down

324
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,680
that's how you keep pathogens down like

325
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,640
bad bacteria

326
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,120
that's how you break down and digest

327
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,320
food

328
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,279
properly okay it's that hydrochloric

329
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,480
acid that your

330
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:27,519
your stomach glands produce and

331
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,760
when you drop in acetic acid like boom

332
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,560
i got apple cider vinegar in here two

333
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,560
tablespoons

334
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,720
it's mixed in water i'm gonna have some

335
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,680
now

336
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,720
oh god so acidic ah my mouth is

337
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,720
puckering

338
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:44,880
mmm ah my stomach feels sick now

339
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,320
and this is just straight water but the

340
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,000
point is is when you put that apple

341
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,720
cider vinegar in

342
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,320
what it does okay is the minute it goes

343
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,200
into the stomach

344
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,560
your stomach the lining of your stomach

345
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,040
sees it as a poison

346
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:01,120
so it starts to release mucus so it

347
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,480
starts to produce mucus to battle the

348
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,240
acetic acid while

349
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,680
it's sitting inside your stomach it

350
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,440
starts to battle it

351
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,720
and then it's one thing the next thing

352
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,120
is your

353
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,079
gastric glands have to over produce now

354
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,040
hcl

355
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,920
to try to neutralize this acetic acid

356
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,640
because now there's an

357
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,079
acid competition going on okay so your

358
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,600
gastric glands are trying to literally

359
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:24,480
neutralize the stuff it's

360
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,800
pouring out the hcl what happens is you

361
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,680
can

362
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,320
play that game if you got strong stomach

363
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,120
lands

364
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,480
you can play that game for years until

365
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,240
that game

366
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,079
bites you in the butt and then you lose

367
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,920
all your hcl and then you're just in bad

368
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:40,160
shape altogether

369
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,000
lena says linda says i think it has

370
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,839
burned my esophagus

371
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,399
i drank it regularly and now i'm

372
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:49,120
wondering what's wrong with my voice

373
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,399
it listen i mean you can heal that you

374
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,480
can heal things

375
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,120

00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,880
you can also get it on sale on amazon

751
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,120

752
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,240
the podcast it's a free resource so you

753

00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:38,960
infomercials there's no commercials

756
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,320

758
