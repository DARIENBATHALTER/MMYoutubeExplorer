[0.72 - 6.96] our brains are under attack
[3.72 - 8.40] our brains are under attack
[6.96 - 10.20] that's what's happening I want to read a
[8.40 - 12.90] quote we're doing the brain saver books
[10.20 - 16.08] right here you guys check this out
[12.90 - 19.26] if you're someone who wakes up in the
[16.08 - 21.60] morning and shakes their head wondering
[19.26 - 24.66] why there's a lack of answers out there
[21.60 - 26.88] for the chronically suffering
[24.66 - 30.38] now you understand why because you've
[26.88 - 30.38] read the brand saver books
[31.68 - 36.30] you're learning the answers you're
[34.26 - 38.40] learning the truth so you can do
[36.30 - 40.20] something about your health and your
[38.40 - 42.72] family's health because your family's
[40.20 - 46.44] health is critical it's important by
[42.72 - 49.20] knowing what that critical truth is that
[46.44 - 51.78] for one toxic heavy metals are
[49.20 - 54.44] saturating our brains and we can remove
[51.78 - 58.86] them to enjoy a better quality of life
[54.44 - 62.64] we supersede the machine
[58.86 - 65.64] We rise above the so-called authority of
[62.64 - 67.68] our well-being so that well-being is in
[65.64 - 71.58] our own hands
[67.68 - 73.02] We rise above the machine
[71.58 - 74.64] so I want to talk a little bit about
[73.02 - 76.14] some we're in the brain saver books you
[74.64 - 78.56] guys and we'll pop these down right here
[76.14 - 78.56] really quick
[79.20 - 83.58] so I'm in a section right here chapter
[81.00 - 85.38] 15 The Brain saver book both of these
[83.58 - 86.94] brain saver books are just absolutely
[85.38 - 88.86] phenomenal
[86.94 - 90.30] packed with information you guys know
[88.86 - 92.28] and you've got the brain shot therapies
[90.30 - 94.14] and everything else this section is
[92.28 - 95.58] called evolving backwards and I was
[94.14 - 97.20] talking a little bit about our brain and
[95.58 - 99.90] our immune system earlier before right
[97.20 - 101.22] but now I'm talking about a couple of
[99.90 - 104.22] other things so let's go into it a
[101.22 - 106.74] little bit we think humans are evolving
[104.22 - 109.92] and advancing right we think humans are
[106.74 - 112.20] advancing and evolving
[109.92 - 114.90] we know that's not true
[112.20 - 117.30] what's really evolving are the toxic
[114.90 - 120.12] chemicals we're exposed to
[117.30 - 123.00] the EMF were exposed to that's what's
[120.12 - 126.66] evolving we're up against the pathogens
[123.00 - 128.40] we're exposed to that's what's evolving
[126.66 - 131.88] we're up against
[128.40 - 134.88] brain betrayers our brain becomes
[131.88 - 137.40] betrayed designed by Industries to
[134.88 - 138.54] supposedly make our lives better so they
[137.40 - 141.66] say they're trying to make our lives
[138.54 - 143.76] better but yet they betray us we confuse
[141.66 - 146.34] the long-standing theory that humankind
[143.76 - 148.74] is evolving with the advancements in
[146.34 - 150.00] technology that we see all around us so
[148.74 - 151.56] we're thinking there's so much
[150.00 - 153.84] technology I'm here talking to you
[151.56 - 155.52] because of technology technology means
[153.84 - 157.92] whoa technology is advancing then
[155.52 - 159.66] everything's advancing that we're but
[157.92 - 160.98] we're getting more chronically ill and
[159.66 - 163.26] chronically sick that's what's
[160.98 - 165.36] incredible about it all we see
[163.26 - 168.36] advancements in life-saving surgical
[165.36 - 170.70] medicine too right advancements in how
[168.36 - 173.40] far we can reach into space with our
[170.70 - 175.62] telescope whoa that's all technology it
[173.40 - 178.38] gives us the misperception that
[175.62 - 183.00] humankind is getting ahead by Leaps and
[178.38 - 185.64] Bounds in some ways that we may be true
[183.00 - 187.50] some ways that may be true when it comes
[185.64 - 189.24] to technology
[187.50 - 191.22] but what about our physical brain so
[189.24 - 192.96] let's go into that what about our
[191.22 - 195.54] physical brains and bodies what about
[192.96 - 197.52] the physical existence of humankind is
[195.54 - 199.92] that evolving
[197.52 - 201.12] just want to ask you like is humankind
[199.92 - 203.88] evolving
[201.12 - 206.16] life expectancy will decrease did you
[203.88 - 207.72] know I was the only oh my God I hate
[206.16 - 209.40] saying this
[207.72 - 211.26] I was the only one that said it was
[209.40 - 213.18] decreasing all these decades
[211.26 - 214.92] and they're like no life expectancy is
[213.18 - 216.78] better than ever it's better than ever
[214.92 - 218.58] all the clinics are saying so medical
[216.78 - 220.32] research and science is saying life
[218.58 - 221.64] expectancy is incredible it's only
[220.32 - 223.14] getting better and I was like no it's
[221.64 - 226.68] not they're just not telling anybody
[223.14 - 230.16] they're not telling anybody that
[226.68 - 234.18] actually it's not
[230.16 - 237.48] it was decreasing all along and now it
[234.18 - 239.28] is decreasing it has dropped it's out
[237.48 - 242.04] there it has dropped
[239.28 - 245.46] life expectancy will decrease at a
[242.04 - 248.06] gradual Pace during this decade and then
[245.46 - 250.98] life expectancy will decrease at an
[248.06 - 252.84] unprecedental drastic Pace over the next
[250.98 - 254.28] decade and Beyond what's going to happen
[252.84 - 255.42] here and reading on the brain saver
[254.28 - 258.48] books
[255.42 - 260.76] life expectancy I hate being kind of a
[258.48 - 263.28] bummer
[260.76 - 264.84] but after 10 years it's gonna
[263.28 - 270.08] decrease
[264.84 - 270.08] at a drastic Pace a drastic pace
[271.68 - 276.12] over the next decade and Beyond at
[273.90 - 278.10] drastic Pace already The New Normal is
[276.12 - 280.98] to struggle with symptoms whether you
[278.10 - 283.98] identify a sick or not everybody has a
[280.98 - 286.08] symptom everybody has a symptom
[283.98 - 289.68] everybody has something
[286.08 - 292.74] acne stuffy nose all the time an allergy
[289.68 - 296.78] asthma aches and pains stomach problem
[292.74 - 299.70] acid reflux everybody has a symptom
[296.78 - 302.04] tiredness fatigue headaches whatever it
[299.70 - 304.02] is they have a symptom
[302.04 - 306.06] Eating Disorders whatever it is they
[304.02 - 308.82] have a symptom
[306.06 - 311.64] virtually every human being on the
[308.82 - 313.56] planet experiences at least one symptom
[311.64 - 316.32] at
[313.56 - 318.30] this point where we stand right now in
[316.32 - 319.98] history so right now in history at this
[318.30 - 322.08] point every single human being on the
[319.98 - 324.38] planet does experience at least one
[322.08 - 324.38] symptom
[324.48 - 328.62] there are different levels from very
[326.64 - 331.20] mild to devastatingly severe symptoms
[328.62 - 333.24] you guys know about that there's The Not
[331.20 - 334.98] So Sick group those who are experiencing
[333.24 - 336.66] symptoms and still functioning you see
[334.98 - 338.46] them out there they're all at the stores
[336.66 - 339.96] they're filing into the drug stores
[338.46 - 341.58] they're in the grocery store you think
[339.96 - 343.02] everybody is fine and dandy in the
[341.58 - 346.38] grocery store everybody's got a symptom
[343.02 - 348.42] I know so they all have a symptom or or
[346.38 - 350.94] more
[348.42 - 352.38] those who are experiencing symptoms and
[350.94 - 354.48] still functioning working being
[352.38 - 356.52] productive even playing all day if they
[354.48 - 357.90] have that privilege of playing all day
[356.52 - 359.76] there's people out there that have the
[357.90 - 361.44] privilege of playing all day
[359.76 - 363.66] they could play play play it doesn't
[361.44 - 367.02] matter they could be big trust funders
[363.66 - 368.94] they can play so either way they still
[367.02 - 371.70] have a symptom then there's the sick
[368.94 - 374.34] group those who are frightfully ill out
[371.70 - 375.90] there those for whom each day is about
[374.34 - 377.70] surviving then there's a people there's
[375.90 - 379.02] people that are really struggling and
[377.70 - 380.10] suffering and they're just trying to
[379.02 - 382.20] survive
[380.10 - 384.42] this increase in sickness like never
[382.20 - 387.72] before is only going to keep developing
[384.42 - 389.40] over time in the next 10 years in this
[387.72 - 392.12] 10 years here worse than the next 10
[389.40 - 392.12] years drastic
[392.16 - 396.60] so are we evolving in that in the right
[394.56 - 399.48] direction or backwards that's the
[396.60 - 401.52] question right here the book's asking
[399.48 - 403.98] are our physical bodies any different
[401.52 - 406.62] than they were in ancient Rome 2500
[403.98 - 408.84] years ago and if you believe that we
[406.62 - 410.70] have evolved since then are we evolving
[408.84 - 412.98] faster than what's evolving around us
[410.70 - 415.56] now that's destroying us
[412.98 - 417.42] so we're up against so much
[415.56 - 419.46] toxins more than ever before the
[417.42 - 421.32] pathogens more than ever before heavy
[419.46 - 424.20] metals more than ever before
[421.32 - 427.26] and the list goes on we need to be aware
[424.20 - 429.36] that we are going backwards not forwards
[427.26 - 431.64] but nobody cares
[429.36 - 436.10] you guys do with their physical health
[431.64 - 436.10] in the next one to five years
[436.32 - 440.64] we're going to see chronic illness rise
[438.36 - 442.44] to levels no one could ever imagine so
[440.64 - 444.78] in the next one to five years we're
[442.44 - 448.08] going to see chronic illness rise to a
[444.78 - 449.70] level no one ever ever imagined before
[448.08 - 452.76] you guys I'm reading on the brain saver
[449.70 - 456.24] books brain saver and brain saver
[452.76 - 458.46] protocols two very heavy books I'm sorry
[456.24 - 459.90] about that about them being so heavy and
[458.46 - 462.44] everything I'm going to bring this over
[459.90 - 462.44] a little bit
[465.54 - 470.22] so and that's because instead of our
[467.88 - 472.32] bodies advancing everything wrong about
[470.22 - 473.72] the world is evolving
[472.32 - 476.22] you guys know what's out there
[473.72 - 478.44] environmental pollution is involved is
[476.22 - 480.90] evolving the ocean is becoming more
[478.44 - 483.06] toxic the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is
[480.90 - 485.46] becoming bigger the chemical industry is
[483.06 - 487.08] evolving creating new chemical soups by
[485.46 - 489.18] the hour Around the World Around the
[487.08 - 490.98] Clock the pharmaceutical industry is
[489.18 - 492.78] evolving even overreaching and
[490.98 - 494.82] controlling the nutraceutical industry
[492.78 - 497.36] and not always evolving in our best
[494.82 - 497.36] interests
[497.42 - 501.24] pathogens are evolving more and more new
[499.74 - 503.22] strains of pathogens that have been
[501.24 - 504.90] released from Labs over the last hundred
[503.22 - 506.82] years and keep people sick with chronic
[504.90 - 508.68] illness or mutating and strengthening as
[506.82 - 510.78] we pass those pathogens around to each
[508.68 - 512.76] other whether through our family line or
[510.78 - 516.06] any other means of exposure
[512.76 - 518.88] everything's evolving around us
[516.06 - 521.28] but the industry is in and the world of
[518.88 - 522.72] health is not saying hey hey we have to
[521.28 - 523.92] do something about it we got to protect
[522.72 - 525.78] our brain
[523.92 - 528.48] we have to take care of our brain we
[525.78 - 530.28] have to look out for our health not
[528.48 - 531.90] doing that instead it's all gimmicky
[530.28 - 534.00] trendy stuff it's like take your
[531.90 - 536.46] Omega-3s make sure you do your
[534.00 - 539.04] probiotics
[536.46 - 542.64] make sure you make sure you take your
[539.04 - 545.52] vitamin D right and it's all about that
[542.64 - 548.04] and it's not it's not medicine is not
[545.52 - 549.54] evolving enough to keep up with
[548.04 - 551.70] everything that's why there's hundreds
[549.54 - 553.86] of symptoms with no answers and there's
[551.70 - 556.26] hundreds of symptoms where people are
[553.86 - 558.90] struggling and suffering and it's like
[556.26 - 560.82] the lotto in a way to get some relief
[558.90 - 563.10] out there maybe you'll get relief for a
[560.82 - 565.50] second maybe you won't
[563.10 - 568.14] that's very difficult
[565.50 - 571.08] so the world of sicknesses is getting
[568.14 - 573.54] worse the the attack on our brains is
[571.08 - 576.12] evolving but our brains are not evolving
[573.54 - 578.28] enough to override the attack so we need
[576.12 - 580.76] help and support the brain saver books
[578.28 - 580.76] are that
[581.40 - 583.58] foreign
[583.82 - 587.52] look I want to go into this a little bit

[822.48 - 827.46] it's really really rare
[825.24 - 829.74] and medical meeting books creates this
[827.46 - 831.60] situation where you heal and you get
[829.74 - 833.34] relief where you get relief and heal but

[862.98 - 867.12] that better than the heavy metal detox
[864.78 - 869.22] smoothie no it's not better than the
[867.12 - 871.32] heavy metal detox smoothie it's part of
[869.22 - 873.24] the heavy metal detox cleanse you can

[877.02 - 880.68] that's what's incredible about it
[878.82 - 883.26] someone else may not need the extractor
[880.68 - 885.42] somebody else can use the extractor what
[883.26 - 889.26] happens is when you'll see reading in
[885.42 - 893.46] here that Spirit of compassion was
[889.26 - 895.56] basically trying to get a sense from a
[893.46 - 897.84] billion people on the planet
[895.56 - 899.70] because it's not MediCal medium was
[897.84 - 902.28] never one size fits all it's not like
[899.70 - 905.22] all the different programs out there or

[912.36 - 917.64] customize you can do the extractor you
[915.48 - 920.10] don't have to do the extractor but it's
[917.64 - 921.84] there for you to move that needle if you
[920.10 - 923.64] need it you got the heavy metal detox
[921.84 - 925.62] smoothie you can just do that but you
[923.64 - 927.90] can also do the advanced heavy metal
[925.62 - 930.06] detox movie and then the seven levels of
[927.90 - 932.88] heavy metal detox where there's other
[930.06 - 936.48] things to do that are recommended in
[932.88 - 939.78] that level so it's really comprehensive
[936.48 - 942.12] and you can find your way and find what
[939.78 - 943.80] feels and works best for you
[942.12 - 945.72] because you're different than another
[943.80 - 948.06] person and why are you different because
[945.72 - 949.50] you have different things going on so
[948.06 - 952.14] there's something called the nerve gut
[949.50 - 954.06] acid stabilizer that's one of the brain
[952.14 - 956.10] shot Therapies
[954.06 - 958.44] I love that one for people I know people

[993.42 - 997.98] time speaking their truth and they're
[996.12 - 1000.50] looking to actually
[997.98 - 1002.96] hone their purpose there's a wisdom and
[1000.50 - 1006.20] intuition stabilizer
[1002.96 - 1009.08] which is really powerful
[1006.20 - 1011.48] and so
[1009.08 - 1012.92] the dream shifter that's incredible all
[1011.48 - 1015.20] on its own so I don't know if you guys
[1012.92 - 1017.54] keep track of your dreams if your dreams
[1015.20 - 1019.58] mean anything to you A lot of people
[1017.54 - 1021.20] don't dream and then there's a lot of
[1019.58 - 1022.22] people who have nightmares and a lot of
[1021.20 - 1024.86] people that
[1022.22 - 1026.86] wish they had better dreams and there's
[1024.86 - 1030.32] also people that want to find messages
[1026.86 - 1033.50] in their dreams too there's also people
[1030.32 - 1035.18] that want to be reached by loved ones in
[1033.50 - 1036.14] their dreams they want to be reached by
[1035.18 - 1038.60] people
[1036.14 - 1040.34] in their dreams too they want to connect
[1038.60 - 1042.68] spiritually in their dreams their dreams
[1040.34 - 1045.80] mean a lot because dreams do mean a lot
[1042.68 - 1047.78] for sure so this is the dream shifter
[1045.80 - 1049.16] I recommend trying the dream shifter
[1047.78 - 1052.10] someday
[1049.16 - 1055.04] because get ready for that
[1052.10 - 1057.38] I mean that's a really that's a really
[1055.04 - 1059.66] incredible one all in its own
[1057.38 - 1063.32] so there's over there's sorry there's 30
[1059.66 - 1065.36] brain shots but there's seven brain shot
[1063.32 - 1067.52] therapy cleanses
[1065.36 - 1068.96] so the craving shifter I know so many of
[1067.52 - 1070.28] you struggled now we're going into the
[1068.96 - 1071.60] holidays and I want to talk about this
[1070.28 - 1074.00] for a little bit we're heading into the
[1071.60 - 1074.84] holidays got the Halloween candy coming
[1074.00 - 1077.48] up
[1074.84 - 1078.98] and then we got Thanksgiving coming up
[1077.48 - 1082.70] depending on where you are in the world
[1078.98 - 1084.38] and such and then you got Christmas
[1082.70 - 1087.26] coming up
[1084.38 - 1089.54] and then you know so either way
[1087.26 - 1091.04] the holidays are on and then New Year's
[1089.54 - 1094.04] right you got the new year so you got
[1091.04 - 1096.32] the holidays coming up for everybody
[1094.04 - 1097.64] and there's a bunch of holidays I
[1096.32 - 1099.02] haven't even mentioned that I haven't
[1097.64 - 1100.60] got the chance but the point is is
[1099.02 - 1104.84] there's holidays all over the world
[1100.60 - 1107.72] everywhere and what happens is we end up
[1104.84 - 1109.94] having like craving problems
[1107.72 - 1112.10] so we end up like eating whatever we can
[1109.94 - 1113.84] like Cake's cookie Donuts whatever it is
[1112.10 - 1115.04] or overeating or eating things that
[1113.84 - 1116.54] we're not supposed to eating so much
[1115.04 - 1119.06] especially for struggling we're
[1116.54 - 1120.38] chronically sick and we know we're maybe
[1119.06 - 1122.72] not supposed to eat certain things
[1120.38 - 1124.46] because we've learned but the craving
[1122.72 - 1126.38] shifter is something that I recommend
[1124.46 - 1128.00] for the holidays so that alone is
[1126.38 - 1133.16] incredible in the book and the Brain
[1128.00 - 1135.38] saver books is the craving shifter
[1133.16 - 1137.90] I mean be the judge of that one try that
[1135.38 - 1139.70] one and whoa you know
[1137.90 - 1142.64] a friend of mine right now is doing that
[1139.70 - 1145.40] one like on and off all day now a lot of
[1142.64 - 1147.56] people have food fear
[1145.40 - 1149.60] they've developed it along the way they
[1147.56 - 1152.42] have food fear for a lot of reasons so
[1149.60 - 1154.34] maybe Eating Disorders or food fear that
[1152.42 - 1156.14] one right there is something that you
[1154.34 - 1157.94] might want to try if you're a food for
[1156.14 - 1160.52] your kind of you know like if you're in
[1157.94 - 1162.14] that zone where you're kind of stuck
[1160.52 - 1164.54] a lot of people need their energy
[1162.14 - 1166.82] shifted
[1164.54 - 1168.32] so it's not just about fatigue that's a
[1166.82 - 1169.64] whole other thing too you could use it
[1168.32 - 1171.86] for that but the point is this energy
[1169.64 - 1173.72] shifter that's a great one too so it
[1171.86 - 1175.52] says at the midpoint of a long day when
[1173.72 - 1177.20] you're desperate for an energy boost you
[1175.52 - 1180.02] know that like long name it's hitting
[1177.20 - 1181.88] you or when you feel unbalanced as if
[1180.02 - 1183.62] you don't have enough energy the energy
[1181.88 - 1186.38] shifter is good for that if you're
[1183.62 - 1189.02] feeling that your energy is off
[1186.38 - 1190.34] then you're not on point right or
[1189.02 - 1192.14] someone says something to you and you're
[1190.34 - 1194.54] like why are you like you are right now
[1192.14 - 1196.88] like what's going on are you okay are
[1194.54 - 1198.86] you okay do the energy shifter if you
[1196.88 - 1201.62] feel like you have too much energy and
[1198.86 - 1204.50] you're hoping to calm down and you know
[1201.62 - 1206.06] kind of like de-escalate right so
[1204.50 - 1208.46] there's that thing too where you're just
[1206.06 - 1210.14] like the the energy is like going going
[1208.46 - 1211.82] but then you're gonna burn out so you
[1210.14 - 1215.18] might want the energy shifter so you can
[1211.82 - 1218.78] like burn it just right so you don't
[1215.18 - 1221.90] just blow all your energy in one shot
[1218.78 - 1223.76] if you're removing caffeine from your
[1221.90 - 1224.96] life do the energy shifter so that's one
[1223.76 - 1226.40] right there so if you're trying to get
[1224.96 - 1227.72] rid of the caffeine trying to break the
[1226.40 - 1229.34] coffee addiction you're trying to break
[1227.72 - 1230.54] the cacao addiction the chocolate
[1229.34 - 1232.70] addiction
[1230.54 - 1234.98] when you want to wind down at the end of
[1232.70 - 1236.90] the day so you can recalibrate because
[1234.98 - 1238.22] you come home or you're it's the end of
[1236.90 - 1240.74] the day and you're already home but
[1238.22 - 1242.12] you're feeling really weird so it's the
[1240.74 - 1244.64] end of the day you feel kind of like
[1242.12 - 1247.34] confused or lost or you're not kind of
[1244.64 - 1248.78] feeling quite right or your Energy's low
[1247.34 - 1251.06] at the end of the day you want to
[1248.78 - 1253.52] recalibrate before the night moves on
[1251.06 - 1255.68] that's another time to use it
[1253.52 - 1258.26] the energy shifter is also ideal for
[1255.68 - 1260.48] overreactive or under reactive adrenals
[1258.26 - 1263.44] so if you got some like overreacting
[1260.48 - 1265.40] adrenals under reacting you know
[1263.44 - 1267.26] adrenals sorry
[1265.40 - 1269.48] got a lot of words going on in my brain
[1267.26 - 1271.94] and mouth right here and
[1269.48 - 1275.06] so low blood sugar that's another one
[1271.94 - 1278.60] too hypoglycemia Sensations such as
[1275.06 - 1281.36] edginess exhaustion feeling emotional
[1278.60 - 1283.82] for unexplained reasons or you're
[1281.36 - 1286.10] getting triggered really easily so check
[1283.82 - 1287.54] that out so the energy shift is great if
[1286.10 - 1288.92] you're feeling like you're getting
[1287.54 - 1291.02] triggered
[1288.92 - 1292.58] like easily triggered like you're just
[1291.02 - 1294.50] like oh my God I can't handle this
[1292.58 - 1297.50] everybody's triggering me
[1294.50 - 1299.66] so that's a whole another reason to use
[1297.50 - 1301.58] that
[1299.66 - 1303.44] these are so great then there's the
[1301.58 - 1305.00] nerve shifter so I want to talk about
[1303.44 - 1306.92] the nerve shifter just for a couple of
[1305.00 - 1308.00] minutes which is really powerful on its
[1306.92 - 1310.04] own I don't know if you guys had a
[1308.00 - 1312.50] chance to try this one
[1310.04 - 1314.90] when you're feeling shaky or anxious
[1312.50 - 1316.58] like have you ever felt anxious or shaky
[1314.90 - 1318.50] so it's not just the normal anxiety
[1316.58 - 1320.54] you're dealing with anxiety too but
[1318.50 - 1323.06] you're shaky you're shaky you got like
[1320.54 - 1325.76] the shakes If you experience random
[1323.06 - 1328.16] spasms Twitches ticks are shifting and
[1325.76 - 1330.74] moving pain throughout your body
[1328.16 - 1332.30] like you know the random spasms and the
[1330.74 - 1334.22] Twitches and the ticks and all of that
[1332.30 - 1336.44] when you're struggling with any kind of
[1334.22 - 1338.30] neurological onset or episode so the
[1336.44 - 1339.68] nerve shifter a lot of people that
[1338.30 - 1341.78] they'll have their neurological symptoms
[1339.68 - 1344.06] neurological problems
[1341.78 - 1345.74] maybe you know you're just you're just
[1344.06 - 1348.14] in a place where you have all the stuff
[1345.74 - 1349.52] going on and you want to do something
[1348.14 - 1352.76] because you're getting into an episode
[1349.52 - 1354.68] so there's a nerve episode coming on and
[1352.76 - 1357.56] you want to use the nerve shifter that's
[1354.68 - 1360.32] a big deal right there on its own
[1357.56 - 1362.60] to break a nervous feeling about the
[1360.32 - 1364.04] moment you're in so if you're in this
[1362.60 - 1365.78] moment you've got this nervous feeling
[1364.04 - 1367.82] going on just get the nerve shifter out
[1365.78 - 1368.90] the future or something that happened in
[1367.82 - 1370.34] the past if you're thinking about
[1368.90 - 1371.96] something that happened in the past and
[1370.34 - 1375.38] it's bothering you like why did I say
[1371.96 - 1377.42] that why did I say that to that person
[1375.38 - 1379.40] like what was I thinking I don't know
[1377.42 - 1381.14] how it even came out of my mouth but it
[1379.40 - 1382.88] did get the nerve shifter out because
[1381.14 - 1386.14] now you're focused on that you're really
[1382.88 - 1386.14] upset you're worried about it
[1387.26 - 1392.00] to calm restless leg syndrome so if
[1390.26 - 1393.98] you've got restless leg syndrome if you
[1392.00 - 1395.24] can't you know deal with like if you
[1393.98 - 1396.38] can't deal with the restless legs
[1395.24 - 1398.00] because it's getting out of control
[1396.38 - 1400.76] you're having an episode you're trying
[1398.00 - 1402.62] to get to sleep do the nerve shifter
[1400.76 - 1404.54] and then if you're gonna take a flight
[1402.62 - 1406.58] somewhere or you're taking a trip that's
[1404.54 - 1408.32] another time to use the Nerf shifter too
[1406.58 - 1410.90] that's incredible the nerve shifter is
[1408.32 - 1412.94] also an excellent tool to use for
[1410.90 - 1415.04] weddings and other events that have
[1412.94 - 1416.84] great meaning to you so it's like send
[1415.04 - 1420.02] out a nerve shifter before you go to
[1416.84 - 1422.36] your friend's party or whatever it is
[1420.02 - 1423.62] so these are really potent these are
[1422.36 - 1425.18] really powerful and what you're going to
[1423.62 - 1427.04] find is you're gonna like you're gonna
[1425.18 - 1429.26] like some
[1427.04 - 1430.70] so much that you're gonna just keep them
[1429.26 - 1432.02] there but always know that there's these
[1430.70 - 1433.88] other ones you can always try and then
[1432.02 - 1435.98] you might be surprised like whoa that
[1433.88 - 1437.54] just hit me like it did this is a big
[1435.98 - 1439.22] one I talked about a little bit the
[1437.54 - 1441.80] other day obsessive thoughts shifter
[1439.22 - 1444.68] this is a huge one right here mind
[1441.80 - 1447.32] racing thoughts you can't fall asleep
[1444.68 - 1449.36] you can't rest you don't feel at peace
[1447.32 - 1450.86] because the thoughts are coming in and
[1449.36 - 1452.78] they keep on coming in or they're doing
[1450.86 - 1454.52] this the Vicious Cycle they're just
[1452.78 - 1456.44] spinning around in your head the
[1454.52 - 1458.90] thoughts are moving around in your head
[1456.44 - 1461.66] they're just in your brain going
[1458.90 - 1463.88] swimming around or they feel like it's
[1461.66 - 1465.44] painful and it's repetitive it's just
[1463.88 - 1467.18] repetitive and you can't get rid of
[1465.44 - 1470.36] those thoughts if you're stuck with them
[1467.18 - 1472.94] could be anything and maybe somebody or
[1470.36 - 1475.28] something triggered you so it became
[1472.94 - 1477.44] worse and now you got those obsessive
[1475.28 - 1479.78] thoughts and it's much worse and you're
[1477.44 - 1483.08] struggling with it that can happen too
[1479.78 - 1484.64] the obsessive thoughts shifter love it
[1483.08 - 1486.02] so let me give you a couple of things
[1484.64 - 1487.88] about it right here that's really
[1486.02 - 1489.68] incredible because this is one of my
[1487.88 - 1492.50] favorites for people because I see so
[1489.68 - 1495.50] many people struggle out there
[1492.50 - 1498.02] try this shot when you're trying to
[1495.50 - 1500.06] break repeated painful thought patterns
[1498.02 - 1501.32] resulting from a difficult situation or
[1500.06 - 1504.32] hardship if you're under a hardship
[1501.32 - 1506.96] stressful situations anything like that
[1504.32 - 1509.36] this can help break that pattern there's
[1506.96 - 1511.70] a question I want to read here
[1509.36 - 1514.22] um meditation and breathing are proven
[1511.70 - 1516.86] to reduce long-term nerve feelings it
[1514.22 - 1519.86] would be nice if he discussed all
[1516.86 - 1521.66] strategies instead of just a drink okay
[1519.86 - 1523.88] so first of all
[1521.66 - 1525.86] something you have to understand when
[1523.88 - 1528.26] people have neurological problems
[1525.86 - 1530.24] tightness in the chest
[1528.26 - 1532.46] Skin's burning
[1530.24 - 1534.92] they're having panic attacks
[1532.46 - 1538.10] the last thing they need to be doing is
[1534.92 - 1539.60] intense breathing exercises so
[1538.10 - 1541.82] I'm not trying to say you're not
[1539.60 - 1543.74] experienced I'm not trying to say you
[1541.82 - 1545.06] don't have experience whatever it is I'm
[1543.74 - 1548.06] not trying to
[1545.06 - 1551.78] be judgmental or anything
[1548.06 - 1554.78] but it's critical to know that people
[1551.78 - 1557.60] who have asthma
[1554.78 - 1560.42] people that have neurological asthma
[1557.60 - 1561.26] people that have gastroparesis nerve
[1560.42 - 1564.02] related
[1561.26 - 1566.90] people who have trigeminal neuralgia
[1564.02 - 1568.82] people that have vertigo and dizziness
[1566.90 - 1570.56] people that have balance issues are you
[1568.82 - 1573.14] following me because I saw that question
[1570.56 - 1574.52] I wanted to read that balance issues
[1573.14 - 1576.56] dizziness
[1574.52 - 1578.36] vertigo
[1576.56 - 1580.52] people that are struggling where they're
[1578.36 - 1582.08] very weak and they're fatigued with
[1580.52 - 1584.42] neurological fatigue let's keep on going
[1582.08 - 1586.34] people that have numbness in their
[1584.42 - 1588.92] fingers and hands
[1586.34 - 1591.26] real physical neurological problems
[1588.92 - 1592.94] which the Chronicles suffer from you
[1591.26 - 1595.88] can't sit there and do all that intense
[1592.94 - 1597.80] breathing exercise you'll end up a
[1595.88 - 1600.02] possibly in the hospital with a massive
[1597.80 - 1602.18] panic attack up all night because your
[1600.02 - 1603.98] nerves are jacked up now
[1602.18 - 1605.48] and then you'll also create too much
[1603.98 - 1607.40] brain Heat
[1605.48 - 1609.44] so when you read the book you'll read
[1607.40 - 1610.70] about that it's not that I don't want
[1609.44 - 1612.80] you to breathe if you don't want to
[1610.70 - 1615.14] breathe that's not it at all and it's
[1612.80 - 1617.06] not that a deep breath in a meditation
[1615.14 - 1620.48] is a bad thing
[1617.06 - 1622.10] but breathing exercises are for the not
[1620.48 - 1623.06] so sick or the people who aren't sick
[1622.10 - 1624.98] yet
[1623.06 - 1626.84] that's what that's for
[1624.98 - 1628.64] if you have experience with health
[1626.84 - 1629.84] experience with other ones that are sick
[1628.64 - 1632.54] and I have
[1629.84 - 1635.24] Decades of experience here
[1632.54 - 1638.18] I know for a fact through Decades of
[1635.24 - 1639.98] experience tingles numbness dizziness
[1638.18 - 1642.32] balance issues
[1639.98 - 1644.24] asthma neurological asthma tightness in
[1642.32 - 1646.48] the chest tightness in the throat
[1644.24 - 1649.10] trigeminal neuralgia
[1646.48 - 1650.54] gastroparesis stomach problems you can't
[1649.10 - 1653.96] sit there and do all that breathing
[1650.54 - 1655.46] exercise stuff you do it you're going to
[1653.96 - 1658.34] be hurting
[1655.46 - 1659.84] so I just want you to think before you
[1658.34 - 1661.46] throw stuff out there because it sounded
[1659.84 - 1663.80] like it was a little snarky like I don't
[1661.46 - 1666.32] know what I'm talking about and I'm just
[1663.80 - 1667.94] trying to get you to drink a drink and
[1666.32 - 1669.50] you know and you're gonna teach me
[1667.94 - 1671.30] something here you're gonna teach me
[1669.50 - 1674.00] that why doesn't he just have all that
[1671.30 - 1677.24] great breathing exercise stuff if it was
[1674.00 - 1679.88] that great I'd be tooting it and tooting
[1677.24 - 1681.92] it for decades for people
[1679.88 - 1684.68] when you read the books you will learn
[1681.92 - 1686.54] about how the balances go off when you
[1684.68 - 1688.76] do the heavy heavy breathing exercises
[1686.54 - 1691.46] how your oxygen levels go off the chart
[1688.76 - 1694.10] and start to eat up neurons you have to
[1691.46 - 1696.20] understand very important information is
[1694.10 - 1699.50] in these brain books helping you and
[1696.20 - 1701.42] protecting you from serious breathing
[1699.50 - 1703.94] exercises when you're not feeling well
[1701.42 - 1706.70] it's critical to know
[1703.94 - 1709.54] I'm not anti-taking breath some breaths
[1706.70 - 1713.18] in I'm not anti-breathing deeply I'm not
[1709.54 - 1715.40] anti-breathing in a meditation but heavy
[1713.18 - 1716.96] breathing exercises does not work with
[1715.40 - 1718.76] the chronically sick with neurological
[1716.96 - 1719.48] problems and in 10 years there's so many
[1718.76 - 1720.98] people they're going to have
[1719.48 - 1722.48] neurological problems
[1720.98 - 1724.22] and they're going to learn as they try
[1722.48 - 1727.28] breath work that it's going to tank them
[1724.22 - 1730.76] and send them down the drain
[1727.28 - 1732.26] so and I I get it I'll probably lose a
[1730.76 - 1733.40] couple of followers that aren't really
[1732.26 - 1735.50] sick and they don't have the
[1733.40 - 1737.00] neurological problems they don't have
[1735.50 - 1739.04] the true vagus nerve issues and
[1737.00 - 1741.50] trigeminal nerve issues and facial nerve
[1739.04 - 1743.06] issues and I get it they'll probably be
[1741.50 - 1744.50] like oh he doesn't know what he's
[1743.06 - 1746.18] talking about but when you get sick
[1744.50 - 1748.22] someday really sick and you got
[1746.18 - 1750.02] neurological symptoms mark my words here
[1748.22 - 1751.40] you'll be picking up the brain saver
[1750.02 - 1754.76] book and you'll be reading it and being
[1751.40 - 1757.28] like why didn't I know this five years
[1754.76 - 1758.66] ago and why did I think I knew
[1757.28 - 1760.84] everything
[1758.66 - 1760.84] foreign
[1763.10 - 1767.48] I'm going to read you a little section
[1764.54 - 1771.50] right here on page 84. let me see it's
[1767.48 - 1773.42] 84. I think it's in the brain saber book
[1771.50 - 1777.20] so I want to read a little something for
[1773.42 - 1779.90] you so let me go to page 84.
[1777.20 - 1781.40] maybe 484 let's go let's go I think it's
[1779.90 - 1784.12] in here
[1781.40 - 1784.12] and it is
[1786.08 - 1790.04] so if you got a second the person who
[1788.24 - 1792.26] was complaining that there's not enough
[1790.04 - 1794.30] breath work in the books there's only
[1792.26 - 1795.80] life-saving information in the medical
[1794.30 - 1797.66] medium books that have saved people's
[1795.80 - 1798.98] lives
[1797.66 - 1802.34] okay
[1798.98 - 1805.60] taking care with breath work get ready I
[1802.34 - 1805.60] want to read a little something here
[1806.90 - 1810.70] so let me just find it here
[1814.76 - 1817.24] okay
[1818.50 - 1823.10] here's what an imbalance of electrical
[1821.12 - 1825.38] brain supplies in the bloodstream looks
[1823.10 - 1827.00] like in practice
[1825.38 - 1829.34] I'll just go one more time you ready
[1827.00 - 1830.96] this is Advanced information
[1829.34 - 1833.78] the person who was throwing the breath
[1830.96 - 1836.30] work at me can you follow along
[1833.78 - 1838.28] here's what an imbalance of electrical
[1836.30 - 1840.62] brain supplies in the bloodstream looks
[1838.28 - 1842.36] like in practice
[1840.62 - 1845.84] in the bloodstream
[1842.36 - 1847.22] ready if someone already has crippling
[1845.84 - 1850.04] anxiety
[1847.22 - 1851.96] and they're not eating an even close to
[1850.04 - 1853.64] the balance of foods and liquids they
[1851.96 - 1856.58] need to keep their glucose and water
[1853.64 - 1859.40] levels high in the bloodstream
[1856.58 - 1861.14] you following me with that and then they
[1859.40 - 1862.88] go through some type of emotional
[1861.14 - 1865.88] turmoil
[1862.88 - 1867.92] their adrenaline will be elevated
[1865.88 - 1870.92] get this
[1867.92 - 1874.10] their glucose in water will be reduced
[1870.92 - 1875.42] and their breathing will be increased
[1874.10 - 1878.96] fondly
[1875.42 - 1880.88] driving in more oxygen to the brain
[1878.96 - 1883.52] heightened oxygen and heightened
[1880.88 - 1885.50] adrenaline creating elevated heat on the
[1883.52 - 1887.72] brain's electrical grid without glucose
[1885.50 - 1890.06] and water to suppress the heat can even
[1887.72 - 1892.28] lead to hyperventilation in some
[1890.06 - 1895.10] situations it's why people who do breath
[1892.28 - 1898.40] work who have neurological problems end
[1895.10 - 1900.14] up in a big problem a massive big
[1898.40 - 1903.26] problem I hope the person with the
[1900.14 - 1905.66] breath won't work uh Judgment at me is
[1903.26 - 1907.70] still listening and if they're not I
[1905.66 - 1909.02] don't know what to tell you maybe you
[1907.70 - 1911.06] know maybe you'll just leave because
[1909.02 - 1914.06] it's all free because we do everything
[1911.06 - 1916.28] free so it's probably not valuable
[1914.06 - 1918.14] okay
[1916.28 - 1919.52] so let's go into this height and oxygen
[1918.14 - 1921.26] and heightened adrenaline creating
[1919.52 - 1922.88] elevated heat on the brain's electrical
[1921.26 - 1924.56] grid without glucose and water to
[1922.88 - 1927.02] suppress the heat can even lead to
[1924.56 - 1929.24] hyperventilation in some situations the
[1927.02 - 1931.94] electrical Sparks check this out
[1929.24 - 1935.00] the electrical Sparks on the grid run
[1931.94 - 1938.24] hotter and more sporadically and can
[1935.00 - 1940.52] even go Rogue with brain electricity
[1938.24 - 1942.98] becoming Reckless the electrical grid
[1940.52 - 1945.44] becomes extra hot and travels to places
[1942.98 - 1947.30] it's not supposed to travel in the brain
[1945.44 - 1949.76] for what is occurring in the person's
[1947.30 - 1951.86] life this can take a person to the level
[1949.76 - 1954.26] of being completely overwhelmed push
[1951.86 - 1956.66] them into a panic attack or shut them
[1954.26 - 1958.28] down so they're less responsive lying
[1956.66 - 1960.20] curled up in bed feeling wrecked I'm
[1958.28 - 1962.36] trying to talk about what happens with
[1960.20 - 1963.98] breath work where literally it can throw
[1962.36 - 1966.44] somebody into a horrible panic attack
[1963.98 - 1969.50] I'm giving you the actual medical medium
[1966.44 - 1971.84] science into how that can happen that's
[1969.50 - 1974.00] so farther ex that's so far Advanced
[1971.84 - 1976.54] past science and past anybody who's into
[1974.00 - 1976.54] breath work
[1977.48 - 1981.14] I always told you guys I'm not smart I'm
[1979.52 - 1982.64] just a messenger with this Advanced
[1981.14 - 1984.62] information
[1982.64 - 1986.48] the balances get off when someone
[1984.62 - 1988.40] doesn't have enough electrolytes and
[1986.48 - 1989.84] glucose in their brain so the balance
[1988.40 - 1991.82] goes off and they don't have enough
[1989.84 - 1993.14] water electrolyte and glucose in the
[1991.82 - 1994.76] brain and that's what happens people
[1993.14 - 1996.92] with chronic that are chronically ill
[1994.76 - 1998.42] don't have enough of that in them and
[1996.92 - 2001.48] people who aren't chronically ill don't
[1998.42 - 2004.30] have enough of that in them either
[2001.48 - 2006.88] taking care with breath work so let's
[2004.30 - 2008.98] walk down that aisle a little bit if you
[2006.88 - 2010.78] guys got a second we're often taught to
[2008.98 - 2013.90] use breath work to help regulate
[2010.78 - 2016.06] emotions deep breathing and breath work
[2013.90 - 2019.06] certain types of it
[2016.06 - 2021.82] do have some value I'm not negating
[2019.06 - 2023.74] breathing I'm not saying breathing's bad
[2021.82 - 2024.88] I'm not saying you can't do a little
[2023.74 - 2028.18] breath work
[2024.88 - 2030.82] but at the same time breath work is not
[2028.18 - 2033.40] what people think it is
[2030.82 - 2035.92] what people don't realize is that there
[2033.40 - 2038.44] is such a thing as too much oxygen
[2035.92 - 2040.72] uh-huh
[2038.44 - 2042.16] even though we're in a world lacking
[2040.72 - 2044.08] oxygen
[2042.16 - 2045.94] we're also in a world where people are
[2044.08 - 2047.98] lacking what they need in their diet if
[2045.94 - 2049.84] you're not keeping a balance with other
[2047.98 - 2052.12] brain supplies such as glucose Trace
[2049.84 - 2053.80] mineral salts and water then driving up
[2052.12 - 2055.42] oxygen to your brain heats up your
[2053.80 - 2057.34] electrical grid and that can be
[2055.42 - 2059.32] traumatizing to the brain and body on
[2057.34 - 2061.06] top of which people are often doing
[2059.32 - 2063.22] breath work while also consuming
[2061.06 - 2064.54] caffeine which dries up adrenaline
[2063.22 - 2066.82] putting their brain and bloodstream
[2064.54 - 2070.72] further out of balance what I'm trying
[2066.82 - 2072.22] to say this is really like incredible
[2070.72 - 2073.78] information here
[2072.22 - 2075.70] is that
[2073.78 - 2078.34] it's Advanced information if you don't
[2075.70 - 2080.62] have what your brain needs
[2078.34 - 2082.24] and you're chronically sick and you're
[2080.62 - 2084.04] sitting there trying to drive an oxygen
[2082.24 - 2086.74] to the brain through breath work
[2084.04 - 2088.24] the nerves can't handle it the brain
[2086.74 - 2090.16] heats up and the nerves can handle it
[2088.24 - 2093.58] throws you into panic attacks throws you
[2090.16 - 2096.16] into anxiety makes the skin burn worse
[2093.58 - 2099.24] can cause a lot of Tremors ticks and
[2096.16 - 2099.24] spasms everywhere
[2099.82 - 2105.64] It's Like Oxygen to a fire
[2102.52 - 2107.68] and you don't want the fire burning that
[2105.64 - 2109.48] hot while you're doing your breath work
[2107.68 - 2112.44] especially if you're suffering with any
[2109.48 - 2112.44] kind of symptom or condition
[2112.66 - 2118.18] ready if you guys got a second like many
[2115.84 - 2120.40] Trends in health breath work is a tool
[2118.18 - 2122.20] for the not so sick did you hear that
[2120.40 - 2125.38] like many Trends in health breath work
[2122.20 - 2127.78] is a tool for the not so sick
[2125.38 - 2129.70] if symptoms haven't sidelined you in
[2127.78 - 2132.10] life that means you're not so sick yet
[2129.70 - 2134.56] you're just not so sick if symptoms
[2132.10 - 2136.72] haven't sidelined you in life you can
[2134.56 - 2139.36] bring breath work in and have fun with
[2136.72 - 2142.36] it I'm not and tie it to the point where
[2139.36 - 2143.62] I'm anti-it if you if you haven't been
[2142.36 - 2146.86] sick yet
[2143.62 - 2149.08] and you want to play with it be my guest
[2146.86 - 2150.88] you can bring breath work in and have
[2149.08 - 2152.44] fun with it if you're really sick or
[2150.88 - 2155.62] struggling and here's a key fact and
[2152.44 - 2157.48] that person is one size fits all I hate
[2155.62 - 2159.88] to say it but everybody seems to be the
[2157.48 - 2161.80] one size fits all out there
[2159.88 - 2163.18] it's really sad because we got a whole
[2161.80 - 2165.70] bunch of people on here watching this
[2163.18 - 2168.04] that aren't one size fits all they're
[2165.70 - 2169.54] sick their problems aren't one size fits
[2168.04 - 2171.72] all
[2169.54 - 2176.46] if you're really sick or struggling
[2171.72 - 2176.46] breath work isn't going to fix you
[2176.68 - 2181.72] that's a fact
[2178.84 - 2183.58] if you're really sick and struggling and
[2181.72 - 2185.02] you've got bad fibromyalgia and you got
[2183.58 - 2187.18] chronic fatigue syndrome and you got
[2185.02 - 2188.68] mecfs and you got lupus and you got
[2187.18 - 2190.12] neurological Lyme and you got 20
[2188.68 - 2191.74] neurological symptoms and you're really
[2190.12 - 2194.38] sick and your life has been derailed
[2191.74 - 2197.34] breath work is not gonna fix you I'm
[2194.38 - 2197.34] sorry but it won't
[2197.50 - 2200.86] it's amazing when I see people out there
[2199.36 - 2204.46] like teaching us if it's going to fix
[2200.86 - 2206.32] people it doesn't breath work isn't
[2204.46 - 2208.48] going to fix you breath work is really
[2206.32 - 2210.28] difficult for people with anxiety and
[2208.48 - 2212.94] even worsens it for most anxiety
[2210.28 - 2212.94] sufferers
[2213.28 - 2218.26] Heidi M says I signed up for a breath
[2215.50 - 2220.06] work class webinar and realized halfway
[2218.26 - 2222.46] through it was not for me thank you
[2220.06 - 2224.62] Anthony and SOC Valerie I taught yoga
[2222.46 - 2227.62] and breath work and had someone have a
[2224.62 - 2229.48] panic attack in my class
[2227.62 - 2231.64] but remember the person that was judging
[2229.48 - 2234.76] me on this
[2231.64 - 2236.62] was going for one size if it's all Lynn
[2234.76 - 2238.66] Lynn Goss I had a breath work
[2236.62 - 2241.24] practitioner come to my home and I
[2238.66 - 2243.96] passed out he said it was out for over
[2241.24 - 2246.82] five minutes because the brain got
[2243.96 - 2247.72] intensely hot and the neurons had an
[2246.82 - 2249.88] attack
[2247.72 - 2251.62] this is Advanced information this is the
[2249.88 - 2254.86] brain saver books this is information
[2251.62 - 2256.72] isn't out there this is Advanced info no
[2254.86 - 2258.76] one's ever heard of it it's going to get
[2256.72 - 2260.14] stolen in poached tonight with me just
[2258.76 - 2262.54] talking about it I'm sure there's
[2260.14 - 2265.12] someone that's got a devious devious
[2262.54 - 2266.86] heart sitting behind here watching this
[2265.12 - 2269.08] free information that I'm not charging
[2266.86 - 2270.22] for and they're probably watching and
[2269.08 - 2271.90] they're going to go out and next thing
[2270.22 - 2273.58] you know it'll be on some invited on
[2271.90 - 2275.08] somebody's podcast and spreading it
[2273.58 - 2277.24] around and not citing it back to Medical
[2275.08 - 2279.28] medium it's a sick world I never
[2277.24 - 2280.84] expected it to be that sick meaning
[2279.28 - 2283.06] demented
[2280.84 - 2284.74] and evil and dark I never expected that
[2283.06 - 2286.36] when I was a kid I thought everybody was
[2284.74 - 2288.28] going to be happy and loving and want
[2286.36 - 2290.50] the info and do the right thing doesn't
[2288.28 - 2294.06] work that way they'll poach it so no one
[2290.50 - 2294.06] else can find their way backward to heal
[2294.16 - 2298.00] breath work is really difficult for
[2295.96 - 2300.40] people with anxiety and even worsens it
[2298.00 - 2302.14] for most anxiety sufferers it worsens it
[2300.40 - 2303.40] for anxiety sufferers stick a bunch of
[2302.14 - 2304.96] people who aren't feeling well in a
[2303.40 - 2306.34] breath work class and you got a whole
[2304.96 - 2308.38] bunch of sick people
[2306.34 - 2310.00] Holly's health I almost passed out from
[2308.38 - 2311.86] it and I was crying I've seen people
[2310.00 - 2313.30] damaged and injured by it that's why you
[2311.86 - 2314.44] don't see me recommending breath work
[2313.30 - 2316.60] out there
[2314.44 - 2318.76] Allison star holy crap so true
[2316.60 - 2321.04] explanation points I struggle with
[2318.76 - 2323.62] anxiety and breath work it makes me feel
[2321.04 - 2325.36] awful it actually hurts people more than
[2323.62 - 2327.40] helps them
[2325.36 - 2329.14] people who are not so sick who don't get
[2327.40 - 2331.06] affected by it yet it's still hurting
[2329.14 - 2333.64] them they're just not feeling the hurt
[2331.06 - 2335.26] yet but they will later down the road so
[2333.64 - 2337.72] the person who judged me on this I hope
[2335.26 - 2338.92] they're still watching you'll see the
[2337.72 - 2340.36] people there's a lot of people they're
[2338.92 - 2342.52] gonna get hurt down the road by it
[2340.36 - 2345.12] really great you know better you know
[2342.52 - 2345.12] more than me
[2345.46 - 2349.48] breath work is really difficult for
[2347.62 - 2351.10] people with anxiety and even worsens it
[2349.48 - 2353.74] for most anxiety suffers especially
[2351.10 - 2356.50] those with sensitive vagus nerves
[2353.74 - 2359.26] sensitive vagus nerves reading out a
[2356.50 - 2361.06] brain saver you guys
[2359.26 - 2362.86] do you know how many people have
[2361.06 - 2364.30] sensitive Vegas nerves so let's go do a
[2362.86 - 2366.28] breath work class and let's just make
[2364.30 - 2368.80] our Vegas nerves freak out and so we end
[2366.28 - 2370.72] up in the hospital overnight
[2368.80 - 2371.86] causing neurological symptoms such as
[2370.72 - 2373.48] tightness of the chest and remember
[2371.86 - 2375.70] breath work was something that came
[2373.48 - 2377.86] about over a dude that was never well
[2375.70 - 2380.38] not had symptoms but not sick
[2377.86 - 2382.90] neurologically
[2380.38 - 2385.48] so it's like a dude thing
[2382.90 - 2388.24] breath work was initially a dude thing
[2385.48 - 2391.12] it was a dude thing
[2388.24 - 2392.44] and then it eventually got into the yoga
[2391.12 - 2394.54] community and everything else yoga
[2392.44 - 2397.48] wasn't really all breath work
[2394.54 - 2400.30] 30 years ago yoga wasn't all about
[2397.48 - 2402.10] breath work yes breath work was involved
[2400.30 - 2404.50] but now they've like they're they're
[2402.10 - 2405.82] mixing it now it's like breath work and
[2404.50 - 2407.32] they get all these people that are just
[2405.82 - 2408.88] like they can't handle it so they quit
[2407.32 - 2410.62] yoga because they're confused you don't
[2408.88 - 2413.76] have to do all that intense breath work
[2410.62 - 2413.76] to do a little bit of yoga
[2414.04 - 2419.86] breath work is not going to make lupus
[2417.28 - 2422.74] neurological Lyme eczema fibromyalgia
[2419.86 - 2424.96] Parkinson's or Ms go away you can bring

[2444.22 - 2447.46] trace minerals and macro minerals such
[2445.84 - 2449.52] as magnesium and trying to stay off
[2447.46 - 2451.78] caffeine if you're staying off caffeine
[2449.52 - 2453.10] and you bring in trace minerals and
[2451.78 - 2454.72] macro minerals and you're getting enough
[2453.10 - 2456.28] glucose and electrolytes and you're
[2454.72 - 2458.02] staying hydrated you can enjoy a little
[2456.28 - 2460.18] bit of breath work but no one's talking
[2458.02 - 2463.14] about how to do it right or how you can
[2460.18 - 2463.14] do it if you're sick
[2466.72 - 2471.64] the books are packed with life-saving
[2470.08 - 2473.44] information and brain protecting
[2471.64 - 2475.54] information
[2473.44 - 2477.16] anyone who just got to health like a few
[2475.54 - 2479.68] years ago and now they're an expert and
[2477.16 - 2481.00] they want to try to school me get the
[2479.68 - 2483.30] brain books
[2481.00 - 2486.70] because you can't make this stuff up
[2483.30 - 2488.64] this is complicated
[2486.70 - 2490.78] critical information
[2488.64 - 2493.48] comprehensive information from above
[2490.78 - 2496.86] brain shot therapy is a physical tool to
[2493.48 - 2496.86] assist fit the physical body
[2497.32 - 2501.76] the body doesn't only survive on oxygen
[2499.90 - 2504.88] so you want to be a breatharian and just
[2501.76 - 2507.10] die somewhere in a desert
[2504.88 - 2509.08] so oxygen is how we only survive we only
[2507.10 - 2511.72] survive with oxygen
[2509.08 - 2513.58] that's it so quit your quitcher than
[2511.72 - 2515.80] your your tonics
[2513.58 - 2517.78] quit your don't do brain shot therapy
[2515.80 - 2520.12] don't do heavy metal detox cleanses
[2517.78 - 2522.94] don't do celery juice don't do any kind
[2520.12 - 2526.26] of supplementation just do oxygen and
[2522.94 - 2526.26] just die in a desert somewhere
[2526.36 - 2530.08] Michelle L none of that crap helped me
[2528.64 - 2532.06] ever and you went through a lot Michelle
[2530.08 - 2535.42] I've seen comments before
[2532.06 - 2537.16] sunrid yes that's me my Vegas nerve
[2535.42 - 2538.96] stress out with breath work and that's
[2537.16 - 2540.94] what they don't understand the breath
[2538.96 - 2545.20] work
[2540.94 - 2547.48] the breath work trashes the vagus nerves
[2545.20 - 2549.46] but don't be afraid to breathe or do
[2547.48 - 2550.96] gentle breathing exercises if you want
[2549.46 - 2554.14] to incorporate that into your life I
[2550.96 - 2558.16] talk about it in the brain saver books
[2554.14 - 2560.94] yeah but there's a difference of what is
[2558.16 - 2560.94] happening here
[2563.38 - 2566.40] very important
[2566.56 - 2573.16] but I love being schooled
[2569.86 - 2575.38] 35 years of getting people better eight
[2573.16 - 2577.00] books that have saved millions of lives
[2575.38 - 2579.64] around the planet
[2577.00 - 2582.28] but you you want to school me
[2579.64 - 2583.84] people get adrenaline high from heavy
[2582.28 - 2585.52] breath work and that's the next thing I
[2583.84 - 2587.44] want to talk about read the books I talk
[2585.52 - 2590.14] about it inside the books people go on
[2587.44 - 2591.76] adrenaline highs when they do intense
[2590.14 - 2594.34] breath work and they're not sick or
[2591.76 - 2597.22] suffering with all kinds of problems yet
[2594.34 - 2599.56] I know people that actually weren't sick
[2597.22 - 2601.72] doing breath work for a few years
[2599.56 - 2603.34] feeling great but then they got sick and
[2601.72 - 2604.72] then they went to their old staple I'm
[2603.34 - 2606.88] going to do my breath work and get
[2604.72 - 2608.26] myself better but they were sick and
[2606.88 - 2610.36] they didn't realize you can't mix the
[2608.26 - 2611.98] both the two and they start doing their
[2610.36 - 2613.60] breath work and they started doing it
[2611.98 - 2615.64] all and started following all the breath
[2613.60 - 2617.80] word Kings and they're doing it and they
[2615.64 - 2619.54] ended up like this seizuring on the
[2617.80 - 2621.34] ground wondering why and that they're
[2619.54 - 2623.14] literally at the doctor's office the
[2621.34 - 2624.40] next day going what's wrong with me and
[2623.14 - 2625.84] the doctor's like what were you doing
[2624.40 - 2628.66] it's like I was doing breath because I
[2625.84 - 2632.34] wasn't the reason they were sick the
[2628.66 - 2632.34] breath work just ignited the fire
[2633.34 - 2639.22] you have to smother a fire
[2636.28 - 2642.04] take the oxygen down
[2639.22 - 2645.70] too much oxygen to a fire makes it
[2642.04 - 2648.34] hotter and faster and spreads
[2645.70 - 2650.02] and so what happens is when you have
[2648.34 - 2651.28] electricity in your brain so let's go
[2650.02 - 2652.60] into it a little bit this turned out to
[2651.28 - 2653.86] be a breath work talk when you have
[2652.60 - 2656.62] electricity in your brain swimming
[2653.86 - 2658.18] around you got the match that's your
[2656.62 - 2660.10] fire
[2658.18 - 2662.08] if you don't have enough glucose in
[2660.10 - 2664.18] electrolytes and hydration inside the
[2662.08 - 2666.04] brain and glycogen storages inside the
[2664.18 - 2667.96] brain and you want to bring in all that
[2666.04 - 2670.06] oxygen but you don't have anything else
[2667.96 - 2671.32] in there to keep the fire down and you
[2670.06 - 2672.76] want to bring in the oxygen you're going
[2671.32 - 2674.32] to blow that fire up and your Vegas
[2672.76 - 2675.64] nerves are going to be spasming out
[2674.32 - 2677.68] you're going to be tightness to the
[2675.64 - 2681.66] chest you're going to be all whacked out
[2677.68 - 2681.66] you're going to be in a bad situation
[2684.40 - 2688.78] and don't you know don't if you don't
[2686.80 - 2690.40] have the brain saver books
[2688.78 - 2691.96] and you're sitting here judging me and
[2690.40 - 2694.72] you want to throw breath work nonsense
[2691.96 - 2696.22] at me like you know and and judge me on
[2694.72 - 2697.78] that you don't even have these credible
[2696.22 - 2700.84] books with all the life-saving medical
[2697.78 - 2702.40] information and stuff you read 10 lines
[2700.84 - 2704.08] in just the first chapter and it's
[2702.40 - 2707.32] unbelievable how much info's in here
[2704.08 - 2710.68] what people notice is Medical
[2707.32 - 2712.54] medium info makes sense it's very
[2710.68 - 2714.10] complex information but it makes sense
[2712.54 - 2716.38] so people don't realize that medical
[2714.10 - 2718.24] meme information makes so much sense all
[2716.38 - 2721.62] the time so all you have to do is just
[2718.24 - 2721.62] read it or be open to it
[2721.90 - 2724.08] foreign
[2729.40 - 2732.64] I'm not picking on anybody for schooling
[2731.56 - 2735.16] me
[2732.64 - 2736.36] but you gotta kind of you know know what
[2735.16 - 2738.78] you're talking about if you're going to
[2736.36 - 2738.78] school me
[2738.88 - 2743.32] little medium information is not common
[2741.28 - 2746.80] sense it's
[2743.32 - 2748.72] not common sense it sense that nobody
[2746.80 - 2752.86] knew
[2748.72 - 2755.20] and then they learn and it makes sense
[2752.86 - 2757.00] common sense is just crap out there oh
[2755.20 - 2759.10] it's Common Sense oh really
[2757.00 - 2761.32] and then someone you know gets hurt Oh I
[2759.10 - 2763.30] thought I was doing it right
[2761.32 - 2765.70] the truth hits you when you read the
[2763.30 - 2768.88] brain saver books truth just hits you
[2765.70 - 2771.64] it's just whoa it's there
[2768.88 - 2773.26] Michelle L says it's insulting aw to you
[2771.64 - 2776.74] and to us
[2773.26 - 2778.42] yeah but here's how it works Michelle
[2776.74 - 2780.22] that person or that per or another
[2778.42 - 2782.32] person or another person you're just
[2780.22 - 2784.84] gonna leave their comfort zone of not so
[2782.32 - 2786.28] sick and they're gonna get sick someday
[2784.84 - 2787.66] and then they're going to get the
[2786.28 - 2789.40] medical medium books after they visit
[2787.66 - 2791.20] their 10th neurologist and 10th
[2789.40 - 2792.94] functional medicine doctor they're going
[2791.20 - 2794.50] to get to the medical medium books and
[2792.94 - 2796.06] you know what's going to happen they're
[2794.50 - 2797.32] going to heal themselves and they're
[2796.06 - 2799.78] still going to on the medical
[2797.32 - 2801.34] medium name and the medical medium
[2799.78 - 2802.90] Community because they're just going to
[2801.34 - 2804.28] do it spitefully they're going to do it
[2802.90 - 2805.84] behind the scenes and they're not going
[2804.28 - 2807.40] to come clean on their mistakes and
[2805.84 - 2809.44] they're just going to like take the info
[2807.40 - 2811.24] and poach it for themselves heal
[2809.44 - 2813.76] themselves and still tote how apple
[2811.24 - 2815.98] cider vinegar did it or some collagen
[2813.76 - 2818.52] did it or some charcoal did it or
[2815.98 - 2818.52] something else
[2821.08 - 2825.88] Kerry Rose said this happened to me my
[2823.36 - 2827.86] chiropractor told me to do these big
[2825.88 - 2829.78] breath work exercises I ended up
[2827.86 - 2833.08] crippled in pain in my neck and
[2829.78 - 2834.16] shoulders anxiety was so much worse it's
[2833.08 - 2837.34] real
[2834.16 - 2840.40] it's real you guys
[2837.34 - 2842.56] it's real I've seen it mess people up
[2840.40 - 2845.68] I've seen it mess people up for years
[2842.56 - 2847.60] but it tells me that people don't have
[2845.68 - 2851.20] experience with the chronic wheel then
[2847.60 - 2852.88] how come I have to know all these things
[2851.20 - 2854.98] it's like people don't have the
[2852.88 - 2856.84] experience then when they say things
[2854.98 - 2858.58] they don't have the experience with the
[2856.84 - 2860.08] chronically all these years it's obvious
[2858.58 - 2862.00] they got into Health who knows how many
[2860.08 - 2863.50] years ago played arounds bought an eat
[2862.00 - 2865.84] better diet book from some podcast
[2863.50 - 2867.52] doctor and just got rid of their junk
[2865.84 - 2869.44] and processed food

[2869.44 - 2872.98] of exposure a lot of bugs in them and
[2871.12 - 2875.56] they were like okay I got a free ride in
[2872.98 - 2878.14] life right now I'm a health expert let's
[2875.56 - 2880.42] go you know but it's insulting because
[2878.14 - 2882.84] it's real this information of what's
[2880.42 - 2882.84] Happening
[2884.94 - 2888.82] laughs
[2886.54 - 2890.38] yeah I can't even understand how anyone
[2888.82 - 2892.72] can do that I know but they do it by the
[2890.38 - 2894.70] hundreds and thousands out there
[2892.72 - 2897.70] Death By A Thousand Cuts it's what they
[2894.70 - 2899.44] try to do out there oh quick
[2897.70 - 2902.20] just cleaning your book kind of thing
[2899.44 - 2905.02] Amazon has grease on their conveyor
[2902.20 - 2908.08] belts it happens every book launch every
[2905.02 - 2910.36] single book release and everybody gets
[2908.08 - 2912.40] their books and they see because these
[2910.36 - 2915.04] beautiful white covers and stuff like
[2912.40 - 2917.44] that right they see
[2915.04 - 2918.64] that there's marks all over it and they
[2917.44 - 2920.92] think they have a used book and then
[2918.64 - 2923.02] they give me a one star review saying he
[2920.92 - 2925.48] gave me a used book gave me a used book
[2923.02 - 2930.34] a publisher
[2925.48 - 2934.90] gave pristine books to Amazon and other
[2930.34 - 2937.30] um you know other warehouses and the
[2934.90 - 2939.16] conveyor belt got them dirty so I wanted
[2937.30 - 2941.08] to say you can take a little dish soap
[2939.16 - 2943.36] with a damp towel and clean off your
[2941.08 - 2945.04] covers creative heart says a lot of
[2943.36 - 2946.78] people wonder why they don't feel good
[2945.04 - 2949.38] after doing breath work thanks for
[2946.78 - 2949.38] explaining
[2949.42 - 2953.26] look
[2950.74 - 2955.18] I like explaining I like meaning like
[2953.26 - 2957.88] explaining what's in here because this
[2955.18 - 2959.80] is where it's all at
[2957.88 - 2961.78] that's what's incredible so what I do is
[2959.80 - 2964.60] I take like a handy wipe
[2961.78 - 2967.54] handy wipes tend to work good too
[2964.60 - 2969.46] I gotta kick me sign on my back is what
[2967.54 - 2971.14] I have you guys know that
[2969.46 - 2974.80] and all we you know which is terrible
[2971.14 - 2977.74] anyway but s life right
[2974.80 - 2979.90] boom Handi wipe cleans the grease off
[2977.74 - 2981.58] wow medical medium books come out nice
[2979.90 - 2983.74] and clean
[2981.58 - 2985.78] quality of medical media books equality
[2983.74 - 2987.82] is incredible because I don't want any
[2985.78 - 2989.98] cheap stuff you guys can you leave some
[2987.82 - 2992.44] reviews for the protocols book and for
[2989.98 - 2993.88] brain saver just so the trolls don't get
[2992.44 - 2996.22] ahead of us
[2993.88 - 2997.96] and leave the illegal reviews they don't
[2996.22 - 3000.42] buy the books they don't purchase them
[2997.96 - 3002.40] and they leave reviews it's evil
[3000.42 - 3004.74] so if you can leave some reviews if you
[3002.40 - 3006.60] like the books right just doing a quick
[3004.74 - 3009.18] little cleanup right here
[3006.60 - 3011.70] and a reminder
[3009.18 - 3015.60] that these books
[3011.70 - 3018.00] were stored in a warehouse that had no
[3015.60 - 3021.12] plug-in air fresheners no chemical
[3018.00 - 3023.46] toxins none of that kind of stuff and
[3021.12 - 3025.02] the publisher did that for me and my
[3023.46 - 3027.84] people
[3025.02 - 3029.64] so if you do get a book that smells and
[3027.84 - 3032.34] needs to air out for a little while it's
[3029.64 - 3035.10] not because of us it's because of the
[3032.34 - 3037.38] scented candles in a warehouse
[3035.10 - 3040.20] um somewhere else
[3037.38 - 3041.88] maybe a you know whatever the the chain
[3040.20 - 3042.90] that you got the store from whatever it
[3041.88 - 3045.12] is
[3042.90 - 3046.44] you know that's another story so I'm
[3045.12 - 3050.76] just letting you know air them out but
[3046.44 - 3053.76] the books are pristine and we're stored
[3050.76 - 3055.98] without that chemical that's always in
[3053.76 - 3058.62] those warehouses
[3055.98 - 3060.84] laundry detergents and stuff like that
[3058.62 - 3062.16] none of that was stored around the
[3060.84 - 3064.14] medical medium books like everybody
[3062.16 - 3065.76] else's books
[3064.14 - 3069.12] and it was done
[3065.76 - 3070.74] purposely to look out for you guys
[3069.12 - 3072.48] a lot of thought goes into these
[3070.74 - 3075.06] incredible books I just want you to know
[3072.48 - 3078.06] a lot of thoughts go into it
[3075.06 - 3079.92] um I know I do a lot of like lives and
[3078.06 - 3081.48] stuff like that and a lot of I do the
[3079.92 - 3084.12] podcasts and lives and I do everything
[3081.48 - 3085.68] and there's no pay walls and stuff like
[3084.12 - 3087.96] that I just don't want to recreate that
[3085.68 - 3090.66] there's no courses there's no this and
[3087.96 - 3092.40] that I know that people poached bits and
[3090.66 - 3093.78] pieces from the medical medium books and
[3092.40 - 3095.52] they create their own courses out there
[3093.78 - 3098.58] in the world and add in all this bad
[3095.52 - 3102.60] stuff it's really a sad world out there
[3098.58 - 3104.96] I think people are just desperate to be
[3102.60 - 3104.96] somebody
[3105.24 - 3109.32] um
[3106.20 - 3112.44] whatever I don't know all I'm saying is
[3109.32 - 3114.72] that I'm keeping this stuff free
[3112.44 - 3116.64] I hear every time I have people tell me
[3114.72 - 3119.46] all the time that if you make everything
[3116.64 - 3122.28] for free people think it doesn't have
[3119.46 - 3124.14] value I know you guys don't believe that
[3122.28 - 3126.36] but that's what I'm told anyway I'm
[3124.14 - 3128.52] keeping it free like I do it's free
[3126.36 - 3130.98] wherever I can
[3128.52 - 3132.48] if you need to wait someday down the
[3130.98 - 3134.28] road for the book to get into the
[3132.48 - 3136.32] library which takes me time to get them
[3134.28 - 3138.30] into a library then wait for that day
[3136.32 - 3141.66] but these books are on sale right now on
[3138.30 - 3144.18] amazon.com and Walmart
[3141.66 - 3145.80] so that's another place right there by

[3195.36 - 3199.14] I don't oh look out for imposters you
[3197.28 - 3202.08] guys and there's imposters
[3199.14 - 3203.70] and the imposters are getting people
[3202.08 - 3205.20] upset out there because they take their
[3203.70 - 3206.40] money and they say terrible things and
[3205.20 - 3208.44] they do terrible things so there's
[3206.40 - 3211.32] imposters out there that do terrible
[3208.44 - 3213.42] things and so then people go out and
[3211.32 - 3215.88] they'll say they they use the imposters
[3213.42 - 3217.98] use my name Anthony William the medical
[3215.88 - 3220.38] medium and then they try to get a
[3217.98 - 3222.78] consult with somebody they tell the
[3220.38 - 3225.24] person I'm gonna fix you and the person
[3222.78 - 3228.48] then does a consult with them and then
[3225.24 - 3230.18] they do terrible horrible things
[3228.48 - 3233.10] and then the person who's been wrong
[3230.18 - 3235.74] goes online and says terrible horrible
[3233.10 - 3238.38] things about me when I had nothing to do
[3235.74 - 3239.76] with it and I don't do consults
[3238.38 - 3241.92] so
[3239.76 - 3243.54] keep an eye out for that it's really sad
[3241.92 - 3247.14] it's
[3243.54 - 3249.24] pretty sick Beyond actually words and
[3247.14 - 3250.38] please let others know
[3249.24 - 3252.60] right
[3250.38 - 3254.52] so
[3252.60 - 3255.84] on that note I don't know what else
[3254.52 - 3258.36] there is to talk well there's tons to
[3255.84 - 3261.78] talk about lots of stuff but I hope you
[3258.36 - 3263.46] guys enjoy the books and you know when
[3261.78 - 3266.04] you get them in your hands
[3263.46 - 3268.98] just know they're living words inside

[3270.60 - 3276.30] you can feel it it's there and they're
[3274.20 - 3277.26] not dead books with dead words on the
[3276.30 - 3281.52] pages
[3277.26 - 3283.50] and that is obvious when you hold them
[3281.52 - 3287.52] keep in mind though it's a lot of
[3283.50 - 3289.80] information in every single line is
[3287.52 - 3292.38] packed with a message
[3289.80 - 3294.36] for everybody cold white spring I told

[3299.76 - 3303.84] by that fake
[3301.68 - 3305.52] they end up saying bad things about me
