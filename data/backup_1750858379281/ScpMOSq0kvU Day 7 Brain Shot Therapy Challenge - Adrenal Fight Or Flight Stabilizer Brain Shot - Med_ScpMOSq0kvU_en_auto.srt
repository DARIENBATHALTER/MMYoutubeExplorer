about it for a minute right

69
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:11,879
stress is dominating your life and

70
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,860
you're not getting a chance to have a

71
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:17,760
break or reprieve

72
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:20,699

73
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:22,079

74
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:24,900

75
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,639
break or that reprieve

76
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,919

00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:57,240
fight-or-flight stabilizer how about

193
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:59,519
this one you're living on adrenaline

194
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:02,760
without realizing it

195
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,380
such as with intermittent fasting and or

196
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,120
caffeine use

197
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:08,760
great time for the adrenal fight or

198
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:11,519
flight stabilizer

199
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:13,740
caffeine use if you're doing caffeine

200
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,540
then get that stabilizer and they're

201
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,640
critical all right so let's take a look

202
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:21,380
here

203
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,380
we're into our next little spot

204
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:27,060
medical medium brain shot therapy it's

205
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,560
where we are now but you know what we'll

206
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,060
switch up

207
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,380
we'll switch things up a little bit

208
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:33,380
we'll change it up this time

209
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:38,760
the heat of the

210
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,880
motion right here in brain saver you

211
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:45,180
guys we're talking about day seven we're

212
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:48,720
in the brain shot therapy cleanse

213
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:51,420
challenge we're doing 10 days one to

214
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,360
three shots a day today is the adrenal

215
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:55,620
fight or flight stabilizer shot I'm

216
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,420
pumped up

217
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,040
okay and I'm reading right out of here

218
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,779
because I see all my little postage

219
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,760
notes everywhere

220
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:04,920
right

221
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:08,580
the Heat of the Moment as we go through

222
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:11,899
life we come across difficult situations

223
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:15,600
betrayal loss heartbreak loneliness

224
00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:18,060
confrontation all of us experience these

225
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,000
one way or another somehow or some way

226
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:22,980
we do even if things are going okay for

227
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,740
a while they're going good for a while

228
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:27,000
and then boom we experience that like

229
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:30,620
they're going okay for a while going

230
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,620
okay and then we experience it

231
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,700
all of us experience these one way or

232
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,800
another we get emotionally hurt and the

233
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,779
physical aspect of this goes wholly

234
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:44,100
ignored

235
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:46,320
no one gives a crap about stuff

236
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:50,459
happening in our lives and it affecting

237
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:52,320
us physically people don't care

238
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:53,640
you can get in a confrontation with

239
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,300
somebody or something or something

240
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:59,339
happens and just no one cares if it

241
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:01,740
affected anyone physically I've seen

242
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:03,920
this over and over again

243
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,920
foreign

244
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:11,040
when we get emotionally hurt a physical

245
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:13,500
aspect occurs inside our body but

246
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,360
nobody's like saying oh

247
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:18,240
sorry about that I hope you physically

248
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:21,899
aren't sicker because of that really bad

249
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,579
argument we had that we started or I

250
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:26,279
started or whatever it is no one's

251
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:29,339
saying hey you know I'm so sorry you're

252
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:31,980
probably you know physically sick from

253
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:33,019
this for days

254
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:35,399
foreign

255
00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:37,380
s to so many people to get physically

256
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:39,839
sick from all kinds of confrontations

257
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:43,459
and other kinds of emotional things that

258
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,459
happen it's really sad

259
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:49,940
we need to address the physical core

260
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:49,940
strength of the brain

261
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:54,779
we need to address that so that no

262
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:56,940
matter what we're experiencing

263
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:58,860
emotionally or what we're thinking that

264
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:01,980
inner core strength of the brain can

265
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:04,560
survive emotional injuries we want to

266
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:07,079
strengthen the core of the brain so that

267
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,940
we don't get these emotional injuries so

268
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:11,040
they're not hurting us or not hitting us

269
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:12,779
hard and the adrenal fight or flight

270
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,120
stabilizer is one of these incredible

271
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:19,140
ways to protect ourselves

272
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:21,480
which is a big deal it's really big deal

273
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:23,640
incredible

274
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:26,339
when we have a loss or betrayal our

275
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:28,140
physical brain can become injured people

276
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:30,180
don't realize that when we're betrayed

277
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:32,339
we can get these little tiny micro

278
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:34,680
injuries inside our brain and talk about

279
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:37,100
that all through these incredible books

280
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,100
right here

281
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,899
especially if our brain doesn't have

282
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:44,519
what it needs and that's another problem

283
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:46,980
a lot of times our brain doesn't have

284
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:49,139
always what it needs and it said part of

285
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:52,320
what injures the brain is not the broken

286
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:55,200
trust itself like the broken trust

287
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,240
that causes us to just be like oh that

288
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,760
broken trust

289
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:02,700
it's the fire that occurs when an event

290
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:06,000
like that happens so that's what goes on

291
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:08,459
it's the fire that blows up in our head

292
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,700
when we've been let down and broken

293
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:14,100
trust has happened it's the fire that

294
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:16,680
lights up inside the brain that's why

295
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,600
the adrenal fight-or-flight stabilizer

296
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:21,720
is so critical for people it's why it's

297
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,279
in here it's why it's so powerful

298
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:26,459
laughs

299
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:30,500
that fire is the heating up of the brain

300
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:30,500
in intense electrical Heat

301
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:37,800
stress loss trauma and betrayal burn hot

302
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:41,339
as well so if we're under stress it

303
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:43,620
burns the brain hot

304
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:45,899
if we had any kind of loss it burns the

305
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:48,720
brain hot trauma burns the brain up

306
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:50,459
betrayal burns the brain hot that's what

307
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,040
happens that's why we need this

308
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:56,160
stabilizer and we're not just talking

309
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:58,380
about one angry spell of the Year we're

310
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,600
talking about every day frustrations too

311
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:02,639
everyday frustrations lights the brain

312
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:06,360
up on fire

313
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:09,779
every day frustrations heats up the

314
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:13,560
brain it's being human fine it's what

315
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:16,740
it's like to be here on Earth human our

316
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:18,300
brain heats up it lights up

317
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:21,540
that's

318
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:23,880
Perfectly Natural but we have to protect

319
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:28,160
ourselves though along the way too and

320
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:28,160
that's something humans don't get taught

321
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,579
we're talking about everyday

322
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:34,740
frustrations for example driving to work

323
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:37,440
in traffic when you're late slowed down

324
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:39,959
or stuck in lights causes the brain to

325
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,120
heat up you start getting a heating of

326
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:43,500
the brain as simple as that you're late

327
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,720
for an appointment you're trying to get

328
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:47,459
there and your brain heats up if you

329
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,079
can't get there on time these are small

330
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:51,360
little things but that's how much

331
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:52,980
heating happens instead of rain having a

332
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,100
difficult conversation can cause the

333
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:58,740
brain to heat up oh yeah having a

334
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:00,660
difficult conversation can cause the

335
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:04,040
brain heat up that's why we have to give

336
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:04,040
our brains what it needs

337
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,220
if you are having trouble on social

338
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,360
media watching these lives and you're

339
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,279
getting kicked off and all kinds of

340
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,440
other stuff go to medicalmedium.com I'm

341
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:16,199
streaming live there right now we are

342
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,760
live at medicalmedium.com and I saw some

343
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:20,100
of you guys say how you love the medical

344
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,959
medium.com website it's free everything

345
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,699
on there everything's free on there by

346
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:26,040
the way but I love what I'm seeing

347
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:28,139
because you guys actually are noticing

348
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:31,440
what we're doing to the website

349
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:32,760
doing all kinds of great stuff

350
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,500
so if you're having a difficult

351
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,660
conversation it can cause the brain to

352
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,339
heat up participating in a virtual

353
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:40,139
meeting can cause the brain to heat up

354
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:42,060
do you know that

355
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:43,860
if you're doing a zoom or something else

356
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:46,260
or any kind of virtual meeting that

357
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:48,839
causes the brain to heat up as well

358
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:51,120
it's incredible because video calls

359
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:52,800
often involve an additional form of

360
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:56,420
stress there's an additional form of

361
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,420
stress when you're doing video calls

362
00:15:56,519 --> 00:16:00,480
that's incredible

363
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:03,300
whether from spotty internet connections

364
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:06,300
that cause delays participants talking

365
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:08,040
over one another or because we tend to

366
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:11,100
raise our voice increase facial

367
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:13,860
expressions or emphasize body language

368
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:15,660
when we feel the format isn't allowing

369
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:18,300
us to project our message it's just

370
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:20,880
meetings just family meetings with

371
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,899
family virtually can also heat up the

372
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,079
brain I don't know if that's ever

373
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:26,940
happened to you guys the brain heat of

374
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:28,680
life's challenges is harder on the

375
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:30,300
chronically ill because they're often

376
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,880
stuck in bed and that's another thing if

377
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:35,100
you are on mattress island or if you had

378
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:38,519
a sickness or an illness or any kind of

379
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:42,380
symptoms or conditions brain heat tends

380
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:42,380
to get hotter

381
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,459
I mean who knows this stuff I mean when

382
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:49,019
I was getting this information from

383
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:51,060
Spirit of compassion it's just it's all

384
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:52,500
like who no one talks about this

385
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:55,259
anywhere

386
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:57,240
so uh people asking about seizures and

387
00:16:55,259 --> 00:17:01,459
other conditions there are true answers

388
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,459
in these books the brain protocol book

389
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,679
you gotta have both critical to have

390
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:06,679
both books

391
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,380
so let's keep on going a little bit so

392
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:14,699
the brain heat of life's challenges is

393
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:16,140
harder on The Chronic Leo because

394
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:18,059
they're stuck in bed they're too

395
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:20,100
fatigued to walk it off or go exercise

396
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:21,780
and that's another thing too

397
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:23,100
what happens is when you're stuck on

398
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,900
mattress Islander you're dealing with

399
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:27,720
any kind of chronic illness or you feel

400
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:30,419
compromised because of a symptom

401
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:33,059
it's not easy to just walk off any

402
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:36,299
frustration

403
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:38,640
that makes it so hard on people

404
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:40,500
that's why I wanted to make sure that in

405
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,660
these books there's over 300 symptoms

406
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,400
conditions and protocols I want people

407
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:48,660
better faster and the brain shot

408
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:50,640
therapies are just miraculous

409
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:52,500
all of it is

410
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,780
so when you're too fatigued to walk it

411
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:57,240
off go exercise or distract yourself or

412
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:59,220
shake it off a lot of people

413
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,020
have a problem where they're like oh my

414
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:03,900
God I'm like I'm stuck in bed I don't

415
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:05,460
feel good a lot going on it's hard to

416
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:08,100
just walk this stuff off so the

417
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,600
frustration can grow

418
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,700
you won't know unless you're in

419
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,740
somebody's shoes that has struggled or

420
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:15,480
you know suffered or been through a lot

421
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:17,460
you won't know until you're in their

422
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,460
shoes that's another thing too

423
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:21,780
a lot of people run from their stress do

424
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,820
you ever see that out there they run

425
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:26,220
from their stress they burn off the

426
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:28,740
adrenaline also called epinephrine

427
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:30,539
created by a mild Stress and Anxiety by

428
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:32,640
keeping busy with the activities they

429
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:34,320
like wearing themselves out so that the

430
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,320
thoughts don't keep cycling a lot of

431
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:39,059
people run a lot of people

432
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:41,460
they're lucky in the moment

433
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:43,559
we're fortunate in the moment to not

434
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:45,600
have symptoms or conditions drag them

435
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:47,580
all the way down yet

436
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,760
they may be young they may be strong so

437
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:53,160
what they do is they keep moving

438
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:55,620
that's what they do

439
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:57,720
self-care appointments exercising

440
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:58,559
running around hitting coffee shops

441
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,880
right

442
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,679
staying out late with friends whatever

443
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,360
it is you just keep moving and you keep

444
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,760
running from the stress that's how you

445
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,980
do it right you're young

446
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,780
but then if you get really sick and all

447
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:12,059
of a sudden you're like whoa now it's

448
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:13,679
just a doctor's appointments now I got

449
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:15,179
to spend a lot of time at home now I got

450
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,860
to spend a lot of time on the couch I

451
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:18,539
don't really feel good I can't really go

452
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:22,460
everywhere I want to go that's a whole

453
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:22,460
nother game and then that heat rises

454
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:30,780
people who are chronically ill don't

455
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:33,539
have that luxury or option when you're

456
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:36,000
stuck on the mattress Island

457
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:38,039
you you can get caught up in your

458
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,240
headspace with the brain fire burning

459
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:40,679
hotter and I want to tell everybody

460
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,960
who's stuck on mattress Island who's

461
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:44,820
been sick who's you know got some kind

462
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,520
of chronic symptom who's struggling all

463
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:50,400
of it I want to tell you guys

464
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,419
that I understand and that you know it's

465
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,760
okay

466
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:55,740
because we can do things about it

467
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,120
we can protect our brain while we're

468
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:59,760
dealing with that while we're on

469
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,860
mattress Island while we're like slowed

470
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,100
down in our life in the moment before we

471
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,100
heal

472
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,160
so when you're stuck on mattress Island

473
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:10,620
you can get caught up in your headspace

474
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,179
and I see that happen because the people

475
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:16,400
who aren't stuck on mattress Island

476
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:16,400
they're able to run from their headspace

477
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,880
they're able to run and just couldn't do

478
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,380
this gonna go see this friend gonna go

479
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,299
back gonna go here and if you're able to

480
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:26,220
run from it constantly until they get

481
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:28,880
sick and then doom boom they're stuck

482
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,880
with it all right

483
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:35,160
Lauren oh my God I just saw saw that

484
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,860
incredible

485
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:39,960
Lauren hashian's so incredible uh to see

486
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:41,400
you here right here by the way it's an

487
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:45,120
honor

488
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:48,179
um to have you here dear friend of mine

489
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:50,760
so that's what happens to people if you

490
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:54,240
get too sick

491
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:56,340
then you're stuck and then the Mind

492
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,559
races

493
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:00,480
all that comes out and you can't run

494
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:03,120
from all that

495
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,340
stress it's harder that's why it's

496
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,020
critical to get healthy too and you can

497
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:08,460
do that with this information even when

498
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:10,020
you're stuck on mattress Island and you

499
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,700
don't feel good it's about being

500
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:14,760
empowered and having the information to

501
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:15,960
heal brain heat can even burn on a

502
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:18,240
different level

503
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,760
with a different kind of heat

504
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,260
when everything is good and happy so

505
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:24,360
even when things are really happy and

506
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:26,160
joyful and great we can burn a lot of

507
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:29,880
brain heat that's why it's critical to

508
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:31,559
get what we need inside our brain

509
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,840
so what I love about the adrenal

510
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:35,820
fight-or-flight stabilizer it's giving

511
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:41,640
your brain

512
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:41,640
this incredible instant fast infusion

513
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:47,039
that ignites the brain

514
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:51,059
in the right direction giving it the

515
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:53,880
fuel it needs so so many of us

516
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:55,320
we're just so stressed out we got a lot

517
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:57,659
going on and we end up burning

518
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:59,580
everything good up in the brain and we

519
00:21:57,659 --> 00:22:02,700
need to restore it we need to refuel it

520
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:04,799
like I talked about the other day

521
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:07,080
she conscious says I did two burnout

522
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:10,980
stabilizer shots yesterday in mid

523
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:13,200
sentence I stopped without trying it did

524
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:17,640
not make a sentence blunder

525
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:20,520
it was almost automated incredible

526
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:22,919
the branch out therapies are miracles

527
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:24,960
you will feel it they're changing lives

528
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:27,780
it's nothing that's ever been released

529
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,039
in this world of health and healing

530
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:31,799
and I'm so glad you guys are

531
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:35,520
experiencing that

532
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:37,020
the brain heat of Happiness can also be

533
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,559
exhausting

534
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:42,780
so even it's like if you play hard

535
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:46,020
or you have a lot of happiness you still

536
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:47,820
have to refill the brain it's not just

537
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:49,080
if you don't play hard and you're sick

538
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:53,059
or you don't feel good and you got to

539
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:53,059
refill the brain it's both sides

540
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:58,440
boots McGee said Anthony I had your

541
00:22:55,559 --> 00:23:00,299
burnout shot today and I cannot describe

542
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:02,039
it I'm starting to feel hope and

543
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:04,080
brightness for the first time in a long

544
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:05,520
time you are a true miracle and

545
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:09,679
inspiration I'm honored you're here

546
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,679
incredible I'm so happy to hear that

547
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:16,500
person who's feeling pretty good in the

548
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:19,260
moment doesn't get

549
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:21,360
an immunity card when it comes to brain

550
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:22,980
heat and burning up all of our reserves

551
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,320
we still need the adrenal

552
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:27,720
fight-or-flight stabilizer even when

553
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:30,720
we're feeling great or when we're

554
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:33,299
feeling sick the brain heat still occurs

555
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,400
and burns up everything inside the brain

556
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:37,740
that's good

557
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:39,720
but we have to refill remember you guys

558
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:41,940
I was telling you guys a swimming pool

559
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,980
water's leaving a swimming pool and not

560
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:45,419
enough Waters coming in so the level of

561
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:47,700
the swimming pool is going down and

562
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:49,320
dropping and dropping and as the water's

563
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:51,120
going out you got water coming in but

564
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,679
more water is going out less water is

565
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:56,240
coming in and the swimming pool's

566
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:56,240
dropping dropping dropping dropping

567
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,559
the solution here isn't to stop yourself

568
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:03,360
from having emotions we all have

569
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:05,580
emotions we're all human and emotions

570
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:08,720
are going to create that

571
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:08,720
that brain Heat

572
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:14,580
we don't have total control over that

573
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:16,020
anyway we can make what feels to be a

574
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:18,360
lot of progress emotionally with

575
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:19,980
conquering demons we can move mountains

576
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:22,140
in our emotional state

577
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:25,260
and that does not mean we will stop

578
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:27,960
having emotions life is not definitive

579
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:31,380
mapped out journey we know that our life

580
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:33,419
is not somebody else's life

581
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:36,299
yet if we look at the lives of others

582
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:38,460
they can seem to have a good run for it

583
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:41,039
for a little while and we think they

584
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:42,900
must have figured everything out they're

585
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:45,299
showing their best life's moments in

586
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:47,400
public behind the scenes though they're

587
00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:50,039
running into emotional quicksand more

588
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:53,580
than we know and they need help too

589
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:55,679
everybody needs the right stuff going

590
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:57,780
back into the brain

591
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:00,059
hope for healing says this adrenal

592
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:02,580
stabilizer shot is magical helping me

593
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:04,140
sleep again I hear that a lot it helps

594
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:06,179
with sleep and I want to say this really

595
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:07,559
quick you guys

596
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:09,720
when you're doing the brain shot

597
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:11,700
therapies keep in mind

598
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:14,640
healing is happening on all kinds of

599
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:16,860
different levels healing that doesn't

600
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,600
necessarily always match up to what the

601
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:20,400
shot says it's doing for because what

602
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:22,799
it's doing is it's healing one thing

603
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,419
other things start to heal because

604
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,700
you're healing this one thing it's

605
00:25:24,419 --> 00:25:28,799
incredible what it could do

606
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:30,360
Arena says since I've been I've been

607
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:32,820
since

608
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:34,799
I've been drinking those shots I sleep

609
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:36,900
so well can't believe it

610
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:39,600
I'm hearing that all the time

611
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:41,640
their powerhouses of healing the brain

612
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,140
so when you're doing the shots and you

613
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,480
do them more often and you pick

614
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:48,779
different ones or whichever one you like

615
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:50,100
really you start to see that power that

616
00:25:48,779 --> 00:25:52,740
healing

617
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:55,200
loving healing says anxiety is a beast

618
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:57,600
this adrenal shot is a legit Game

619
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,220
Changer this is one of my favorites but

620
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,539
you know at the same time I say that and

621
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:02,220
then all of a sudden there's another one

622
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:04,980
that's one of my favorites to be honest

623
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:08,039
all 30 of the brain shot therapies from

624
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:10,080
Spirit of compassion are my favorites so

625
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:14,000
it's a tough one but this one right here

626
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:16,320
this one hits me right smack instantly

627
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,840
and you know I heard you know a friend

628
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,700
of mine took this shot this brain shot

629
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,799
therapy the adrenal fight or flight

630
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:25,500
stabilizer and it hit him a day later

631
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:28,200
and it was like his life changed a day

632
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:32,279
later so it can it can hit at different

633
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,279
moments so just be prepared

634
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:40,860
MK says good afternoon SOC and Anthony I

635
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:42,840
just got my books after a week wow the

636
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:45,720
books are so high quality by the way

637
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:48,240
they are incredible high quality

638
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,440
and you say beautiful colors and the

639
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,779
important thing is the helpful

640
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,940
information in the books the price is so

641
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:55,980
cheap versus the quality yes there's 12

642
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:58,380
books in these two books

643
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:00,360
and the quality is unbelievable we

644
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:02,039
probably only paid for the cost to make

645
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:04,080
the book

646
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:06,240
it costs more to make the book actually

647
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,460
than what everybody's paying for no

648
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,919
profit here poor Anthony he's working

649
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:13,320
really really hard to save our lives not

650
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:15,240

made me high but in a good way loved it

686
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:39,240
I noticed that some of the stabilizers

687
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:41,400
will actually level you out so it'll

688
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:44,159
give you a high

689
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:46,559
which is incredible that leveling it

690
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:49,679
does can give you a high some of the

just medicinal food in the end how

695
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:03,240
incredible but why does it work it works

696
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:05,760
because of the synergistic combinations

697
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:08,220
from above of exactly what needs to be

698
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,900
put together to create what it does for

699
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:11,760
what it's saying it does like adrenal

700
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:14,100
fight or flight stabilizer it's what is

701
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,840

wild blueberry juice when you put that

705
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:25,100
together

706
00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:25,100
it's an entirely different thing

707
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:30,059

try holding your breath though don't try

731
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:53,399
holding your breath I hold my breath

732
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,520
when I hear the robot so you can stay

733
00:30:53,399 --> 00:30:58,799
perfectly still like

734
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:01,200
but you got to get air in there

735
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:02,460
by the end of it

736
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,140
all right

737
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,640
talking about brain heat we're talking

738
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:07,260
about the adrenal finer flight

739
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:10,620
stabilizer

740
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:12,000

741
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:15,179
so

742
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,919
all right we could get worn down

743
00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:19,380
by the little ups and downs and

744
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:21,419
challenges thrown out our way

745
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:23,460
we can get worn down by the larger

746
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:25,679
challenges that come our way

747
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:30,120
whatever life brings

748
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:32,580
we can heal the brain critical to know

749
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:36,120
our brains can burn hot

750
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:38,100
but we can cool them down by feeding our

751
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:40,260
brains what it needs think about that

752
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:42,720
how incredible it is

753
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:45,000
being prepared ahead of time is the

754
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,860
ultimate defense and protection for our

755
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,659
brain and that's what we're doing we're

756
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:51,240
preparing ourselves with this knowledge

757
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:53,340
and information so

758
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:55,679
if I know I can do an adrenal

759
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:58,980
fight-or-flight stabilizer

760
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:02,640
and I can do that one before I go into

761
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:04,320
the fire the Heat of the Moment

762
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,059
like I got a big day ahead of me on

763
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:08,580
meetings I got people I got to talk to

764
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:10,799
you never know what's gonna happen

765
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:13,559
you want it all to work out

766
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:15,899
you want everything to be smooth

767
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:17,520
but life doesn't really work that way we

768
00:32:15,899 --> 00:32:20,279
don't have control over everything

769
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:23,159
everybody's got their own free will

770
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:24,720
just like you have your own free will so

771
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:27,000
life is always going to just throw

772
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:30,240
something at you somewhere along the way

773
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,980
but if you can be prepared

774
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,740
and do you like a fight or flight

775
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:36,659
stabilizer that morning before you go

776
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:39,419
off

777
00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:40,740
or you can be prepared by having the

778
00:32:39,419 --> 00:32:43,980
ingredients of the fight-or-flight

779
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:45,659
stabilizer at home in your refrigerator

780
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:46,919
so that when you're having your day and

781
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:51,440
you come home and you're like you know

782
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:51,440
what I need a fight or flight stabilizer

783
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:54,840
maybe you're on the phone with the phone

784
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:57,120
company maybe you're on the phone with

785
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:59,279
some other you know company and they got

786
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:01,140
you on hold for an hour and you're

787
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:02,399
trying to fix something and you're like

788
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:04,620
you know what I need that fight or

789
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:06,480
flight stabilizer maybe you're going to

790
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:09,059
be an old friend maybe you got to meet

791
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,440
family maybe somebody's in a really bad

792
00:33:09,059 --> 00:33:12,779
mood that you're spending time with

793
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:14,580
whatever it is that fight or flight

794
00:33:12,779 --> 00:33:19,559
stabilizer is so powerful because the

795
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:22,559
brain heat rises but we can be prepared

796
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:24,419
cut it off at the pass we can have our

797
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:26,519
stuff in hand

798
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:28,019
but one thing I'll tell you right now is

799
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:29,640
the instant relief that these

800
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:32,519
stabilizers bring

801
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:35,700
is like a true Miracle so you'll feel it

802
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:37,919
I feel it on the first sip with the

803
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:41,000
adrenal fight or flight stabilizer

804
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:41,000
really incredible

805
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:49,019
little did we know these steps

806
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:51,539
might not have been appropriate

807
00:33:49,019 --> 00:33:53,760
in our life where we take these steps in

808
00:33:51,539 --> 00:33:56,580
life but we didn't know we were going to

809
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,840
have a pitfall but we can pick ourselves

810
00:33:56,580 --> 00:34:01,080
back up

811
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:03,120
and we could not only Rectify what went

812
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,799
wrong inside our bodies because of any

813
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,059
kind of stress but we can move ourselves

814
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:07,440
forward and that's another thing with

815
00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:09,540
the brain shot therapies the adrenal

816
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,760
fight-or-flight stabilizer starts to

817
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:14,399
build you up so that when you get

818
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:17,220
another Pitfall you have a stressful

819
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:19,080
situation you have a hard day you're

820
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:21,419
already ahead

821
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:23,280
you do the fight-or-flight stabilizer I

822
00:34:21,419 --> 00:34:25,440
have a doctor friend of mine now dude

823
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,899
the fight-or-flight stabilizer it's been

824
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,639
doing it for like two weeks now every

825
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:31,260
day for two weeks the fight-or-flight

826
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:33,720
stabilizer

827
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:35,879
and now what's happening

828
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:37,740
is like any kind of bad news this

829
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:39,839
doctor's getting or any kind of stress

830
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:41,940
from any kind of family situation or any

831
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:45,060
kind of stress what's happening in his

832
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:46,619
life he's like it's not even phasing him

833
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:48,599
he's doing the adrenal fight or flight

834
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:51,419
stabilizer every day for two weeks he

835
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:53,399
says it's almost like he's ahead of it

836
00:34:51,419 --> 00:34:55,200
and he can just shake it off like it's

837
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:57,300
no big deal and keep on moving forward

838
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:59,460
and that's the whole point we can

839
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:01,740
actually prepare ourselves we can make

840
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:04,740
ourselves stronger so that when we're

841
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:07,500

842
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:09,000

851
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,200

so it helps to rewire and reset the

857

brain

858
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:45,060
so the brain shot therapies rewire the

859
00:35:42,359 --> 00:35:48,180

to the brain

864
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:03,540
so the whole point of the brain shot

865
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:08,760

866
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:11,099

when you're dealing with negative

879
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:39,540
exposure that you think you're dealing

880
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:41,280
with resetting the brain putting a

881
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:44,099
shield around you and moving negative

882
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:46,200

could be the next morning

887
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:56,339
it could be that second you're taking it

888
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:58,079
down

889
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:59,760
and usually you'll feel it no matter

890
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:01,380
what you'll feel something when you're

891
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,000
taking down the shot because they're

892
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:05,640
doing something

893
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:08,280
miraculous in the moment but you can

894
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:11,220

895
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:13,680
they're really potent

896
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:15,599
I remember being in my office

897
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,099
getting the information from Spirit of

898
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:20,000
compassion writing it down about the

899
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:20,000
brain shot Therapies

900
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:25,260
and

901
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:27,359
say well what do I do

902
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:29,220
how do I forewarn people about this

903
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:32,040
because in the Alternative Health world

904
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:35,160
you don't get things

905
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:37,079
at the snap of your fingers

906
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:39,000
an alternative health and healing world

907
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:41,520
it's just not a lot of options people

908
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,440
don't heal chronic illness easy out

909
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:45,300
there at all medical medium books have

910
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,920
fast-tracked people

911
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:48,359
in the last eight years with all the

912
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,980
medical medium books people have fast

913
00:37:48,359 --> 00:37:52,140
tracked and their healing diseases

914
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:55,560
conditions symptoms faster than anything

915
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:57,720
but what do I tell people I said to SOC

916
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:59,460
about these brain shot therapies because

917
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:02,160
I have to forewarn them they have to

918
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:04,320
know that just like it says in the book

919
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:07,339
they have to know it comes quick I don't

920
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,339
want them caught off guard

921
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:12,780
so systematically these combinations of

922
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:14,940
ingredients work together to help heal

923
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:17,760
the problem you're dealing with in even

924
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:20,579
more than that deeper issues too along

925
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:22,980
with it so the power of these brain shot

926
00:38:20,579 --> 00:38:24,240
therapies is just absolutely incredible

927
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:25,800
so let's talk about what are we even

level if you just got here we're doing

930
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:32,280
the entry level brain shot therapy

931
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:34,380
cleanse we're on day seven of a 10 day

932
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:35,099
brain shot therapy challenge cleanse

933
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:37,500
right

934
00:38:35,099 --> 00:38:40,140
so we're in the entry level that means

935
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:42,119
whatever diet you're doing whatever

936
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:44,820
Foods you're doing you can just continue

937
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:48,599
to continue to do

938
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:50,579
so whatever diet you subscribe to or if

939
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:52,680
you're doing medical medium stuff if

940
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:54,119
you're doing medical medium tools

941
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:56,460
whatever's happening and how you're

942
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:59,520
eating you can still keep that and still

943
00:38:56,460 --> 00:39:01,079
do these brain shot Therapies

944
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,520
what's amazing about these Branch out

945
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:05,460
therapies they're giving you relief

946
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:08,160
while you bring in other medical medium

947
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:11,339
tools too because you're fixing other

948
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:14,520
issues deep inside your body long term

949
00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:16,440
so I like having them both

950
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:19,460
the entry-level brain shot therapy

951
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:22,200
cleanse you drink 50 ounces of water

952
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:24,119
throughout the day as your minimum 50

953
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,619
ounces of water but don't drink the 50

954
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:27,839
ounces right when you had your shot

955
00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:29,940
don't send down your shot just had my

956
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:32,700
shot let me do 50 ounces of water now

957
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:36,480
don't do that

958
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:39,780
so when you have your brain shot therapy

959
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:41,339
make sure you wait like 10 minimum 15

960
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:44,579
minutes really but 10 minutes is

961
00:39:41,339 --> 00:39:47,640
probably the best the closest we can get

962
00:39:44,579 --> 00:39:49,380
but you want like 15 minutes before you

963
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:51,240
start drinking or eating other things

964
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:53,359
you want that to get into your

965
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:56,940
bloodstream and get to your brain before

966
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:59,160
you Sidetrack it with other food and

967
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:00,599
things

968
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:02,940
so when you do the adrenal

969
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:04,800
fight-or-flight stabilizer make sure you

970
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:06,780
when you send it down you wait 15

971
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,700
minutes there's

972
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:10,920
children guidance in the brain saver

973
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:12,839
books two

974
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:14,579
and there's breastfeeding questions if

975
00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:16,079
you're okay with taking the brain shot

976
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:17,820
therapies ask your doctor what's right

977
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:20,339
for you take the books to your doctors

978
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:24,079
if you want but it's fine to do brain

979
00:40:20,339 --> 00:40:24,079
shot therapies while breastfeeding

980
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:29,280
so the entry level cleanse is what we're

981
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:31,800
doing and we're in 10 word seven of ten

982
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:35,339
days of it right now

983
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:37,320
and you can do one to three shots so I'm

984
00:40:35,339 --> 00:40:38,940
doing three shots a day so today's the

985
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:41,040
adrenal fight or flight stabilizer so

986
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:43,500
this is the first shot

987
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:45,540
I'm gonna do a second one later and the

988
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:47,339
third one tonight

989
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:49,440
so that's how I'm doing it you can do it

990
00:40:47,339 --> 00:40:52,440
the way you want to do you can do one

991
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,400
shot a day each day you can do two or

992
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:55,320
three

993
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,520
and you could do the same shot now if

994
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:59,820
you want to do

995
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:01,800
your own thing you're in the 10 day

1005
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:23,099
amethyst says 15 to 30 minutes away from

1006
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:24,660
food yes when you're doing the brain

1007
00:41:23,099 --> 00:41:28,320
shot therapy

1008
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:30,420
Darcy Lee said I just did three at once

1009
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:32,040
it's actually really funny

1010
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:35,099
day seven adrenal fighter flight

1011
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:36,900
stabilizer let's get into it

1012
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:40,079
incredible you guys

1013
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:42,000
all right so the ingredients are pretty

1014
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:44,280
straightforward you'll see in there but

1015
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,780
you want to keep them in order

1016
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:49,320
so what you'll see over here I got

1017
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:51,480
lemons I got garlic

1018
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:53,880
so the first thing I need is a clove of

1019
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:55,920
garlic now it says small clove of garlic

1020
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:57,599
so you don't want a really large one you

1021
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,980
know how there's elephant garlic you

1022
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:00,780
guys

1023
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:03,060
you don't want to get the big old

1024
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:06,000
elephant garlic and have like one big

1025
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:09,359
gigantic clove and you also don't want

1026
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:13,079
the largest clove in the bunch

1027
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:16,560
you want to go with like a medium clove

1028
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:18,599
a small clove right so that's the clove

1029
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,940
of garlic right there just getting my

1030
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:23,640
ingredients ready before they run I run

1031
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:25,680
them through the juicer

1032
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:27,599
so that's one thing right there the

1033
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:30,180
other thing is I don't have any Frozen

1034
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:32,460
wild blueberries right now so I got the

1035
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:34,800
Wyman's wild blueberry juice you guys

1036
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:37,980
know it well right which is an

1037
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:40,320
incredible tool all on its own which is

1038
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:41,520
amazing and you guys know I work with

1039
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:43,320
Wyman's

1040
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:46,140
to try to keep the stuff out there

1041
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:48,119
because it is incredible anyway what I'm

1042
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:50,880
going to do is I'm going to pour some of

1043
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:53,160
the wild blueberry juice into

1044
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,660
the container after I juice the

1045
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:56,579
ingredients so I'm not going to use the

1046
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:59,339
Frozen wild blueberry because I don't

1047
00:42:56,579 --> 00:43:01,380
have any in stock in the house right now

1048
00:42:59,339 --> 00:43:03,240
but and they got a sale going on right

1049
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:05,460
now they've had a sale going on check it

1050
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:07,560
out when you when you see so go to

1051
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:09,780
Wyman's but anyway that's what I'm using

1052
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:12,540
I got that ready

1053
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:18,319
what else do we need here

1054
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:18,319
I have lemon so let's get that prepared

1055
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:24,180
so it says in the book

1056
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:28,579
peel your lemon right a peeled lemon so

1057
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:28,579
don't juice the lemon rind

1058
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,740
so I'm doing a half a peeled lemon in

1059
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:35,339
here

1060
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:37,560
so I'm peeling The Lemon Back

1061
00:43:35,339 --> 00:43:39,720
right and you can use a peeler I'm just

1062
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:43,099
using a knife

1063
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:43,099
little paring knife right

1064
00:43:44,119 --> 00:43:50,660
now if you have a really large Lemon

1065
00:43:48,839 --> 00:43:54,119
like

1066
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:57,180
big old Myers lemon that's going to give

1067
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:58,980
you a lot of juice just preparing you so

1068
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:02,400
try to use a quarter of that big old

1069
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:04,319
lemon this is kind of like you know a

1070
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:07,099
smaller lemon I'm gonna use a half of

1071
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:07,099
this smaller lemon

1072
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:12,660
so it says it says Ginger first

1073
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:13,980
is that what it says okay here's a

1074
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:18,180
question here

1075
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:21,300
what juicer is best so the best juicer

1076
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:23,900
that I have endorsed is the mm-1500

1077
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:23,900
right here

1078
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:27,500
now I know the sharks are getting upset

1079
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:30,300
at me

1080
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:32,339
because I haven't been talking about the

1081
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:33,660
MN 1500 or 900 in a while because I've

1082
00:44:32,339 --> 00:44:34,859
been so busy writing the books getting

1083
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:37,140
the books published making sure

1084
00:44:34,859 --> 00:44:38,579
everything was all set but this is the

1085
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:39,780
best juicer I know the sharks have

1086
00:44:38,579 --> 00:44:41,040
swooped into the medical medium

1087
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:42,119
community and they're pushing their

1088
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:45,060
juicers

1089
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:48,060
but this one squeezes the heck out of

1090
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:50,280
the produce and then you have more juice

1091
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:53,579
when you have more juice

1092
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:56,339
you save money and that's why I love

1093
00:44:53,579 --> 00:44:59,040
these only the mm 1500 and 900 can do

1094
00:44:56,339 --> 00:45:00,480
that has that high compression but

1095
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:02,040
here's the incredible thing and I see

1096
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,839
people are getting upset because they

1097
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:06,540
see me defending

1098
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:08,520
the mm1500

1099
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:10,980
so what you have to know that this not

1100
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:13,440
only juices and saves you money on that

1101
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:15,780
it makes nut Butters nut milks and the

1102
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:18,540
other juicers don't mix nut Butters nut

1103
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:21,480
milks Salsas hummus

1104
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:24,300
all of that

1105
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:24,960
so that's something to be really you

1106
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:27,260
know

1107
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:30,900
aware of because it's incredible so

1108
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:32,760
there's that but the point is is that by

1109
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:35,460
far when you're saving money with your

1110
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:36,960
produce and you're spending less money

1111
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:40,260
on your produce

1112
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:42,480
that's what the mm 900 and 1500 do

1113
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:44,280
no other juicers do that in my opinion

1114
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:46,079
I've tried them all they don't do it

1115
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:48,540
these are designed to actually squeeze

1116
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:51,960
more juice out so that means you're

1117
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:54,540
saving all this money and adds up my

1118
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:58,680
mm-900 paid for itself a dozen times

1119
00:45:54,540 --> 00:46:00,839
which juicers can't do and the MN 1500

1120
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:02,040
is paying for itself all the time too so

1121
00:46:00,839 --> 00:46:04,020
I'm just letting you know since you guys

1122
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:05,640
are asking the question now I know the

1123
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:09,420
other juicer companies are telling all

1124
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:11,880
their MLM people to fight back

1125
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:14,640
and say oh no our squeezes all the juice

1126
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:16,079
out too no it doesn't or they'll be like

1127
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:18,359
whatever because they're all freaking

1128
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:20,819
out because they had like the Sharks

1129
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:23,460
came in when I was like asleep but I

1130
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:25,440
wasn't asleep I was working my ass off

1131
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:28,560
anyway guys I got the ginger for the

1132
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:31,560
fight-or-flight stabilizer here

1133
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:34,380
that's going to go first

1134
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:37,560
and then

1135
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:40,020
let's cut this lemon in half we got the

1136
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:41,520
half lemon right there

1137
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:45,319
so I'm just getting these all ready we

1138
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:45,319
got the garlic we got the ginger

1139
00:46:47,099 --> 00:46:51,660
we got the lemon

1140
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:55,200
so let's keep on going all right the

1141
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:58,319
next thing we need is the parsley

1142
00:46:55,200 --> 00:47:01,859
so we need a cup of tightly packed

1143
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:04,079
parsley so what I like to do I have like

1144
00:47:01,859 --> 00:47:05,339
little measuring way I do with my hand

1145
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:08,400
because I've done it so many times

1146
00:47:05,339 --> 00:47:10,200
versus cups and all that so I get a cup

1147
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:12,300
of parsley here

1148
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:14,099
tightly packed

1149
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:17,599
so I'm all set that's going to be my

1150
00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:21,300
parsley excited getting everything ready

1151
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:23,460
so the next is kale a half cup of

1152
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:25,319
tightly packed kale so I'm just gonna

1153
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:28,339
roll this kale up a little bit tightly

1154
00:47:25,319 --> 00:47:28,339
pack it up in my hand

1155
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:34,079
so get a half cup in here

1156
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:35,940
so now some of this stuff is a little

1157
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:38,900
juicy so you're going to get probably a

1158
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:38,900
little bit more in your shot

1159
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:44,099
all right

1160
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:46,260
and then we got the watermelon rind so

1161
00:47:44,099 --> 00:47:49,440
let's get that going

1162
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:52,460
one cup of chopped watermelon rind so I

1163
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,460

00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:57,680
let's get up get a rind real quick

1165
00:47:59,579 --> 00:48:05,720

[Music]

1182
00:48:44,099 --> 00:48:47,160

1183
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:51,440

1184
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:51,440
the wild blueberry juice in the end

1185
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:55,880
so I'm going to start out with my Ginger

1186
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:02,099
now look if your order isn't perfect

1187
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:04,560
because you missed one first or a second

1188
00:49:02,099 --> 00:49:08,760
it's okay but you want to get it in

1189
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:11,040
order the best you can it does help

1190
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:14,220

1191
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:18,440
my SOC all right

1192
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:18,440

1195
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:26,640
garlic

1196
00:49:23,650 --> 00:49:28,859
[Music]

1197
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:30,839
that's in there right there

1198
00:49:28,859 --> 00:49:33,240
third thing

1199
00:49:30,839 --> 00:49:34,800
it says put the blueberries in but I'm

1200
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:36,540
gonna pour it in after and you can just

1201
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:38,760
pour it in

1202
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:40,440
right from here too if you're dealing

1203
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:43,640
with the juice so I'm gonna pop in a

1204
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:43,640
little bit of the juice right here

1205
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:49,220
it says two teaspoons will go with a

1206
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:49,220
little bit of juice right there

1207
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:57,260
all right half peeled lemon

1208
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:06,680
get that down there

1209
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:06,680
next we're going with the parsley

1210
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:11,480
here we go

1211
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:17,480
I'm actually really excited

1212
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:23,640
you know there's a feeling you get

1213
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:25,619
when you know you're doing something so

1214
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:28,200
incredible for your brain

1215
00:50:25,619 --> 00:50:30,359
because you're using your free will and

1216
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:31,859
your intentions you're using your brain

1217
00:50:30,359 --> 00:50:33,480
to heal your brain you have to remember

1218
00:50:31,859 --> 00:50:36,500
that and how incredible that is we're

1219
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:36,500
going to do some kale next

1220
00:50:36,839 --> 00:50:42,300
you're using

1221
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:44,760
your brain to heal your brain

1222
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:46,859
that's empowerment but people don't do

1223
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:48,900
that and if they try to do it they get

1224
00:50:46,859 --> 00:50:50,700
the wrong information which doesn't help

1225
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:53,280
if your brain is using the wrong

1226
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:55,500
information to heal your brain it's not

1227
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:56,940
going to help but when you use your

1228
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:59,700
brain to heal your brain and it's the

1229
00:50:56,940 --> 00:51:02,220
information that actually works

1230
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:03,900
that's when everything changes

1231
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:06,260
so we're gonna do some watermelon rind

1232
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:06,260
in here

1233
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:13,099
do you guys find any watermelon

1234
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:19,800
a little bit more in here

1235
00:51:17,339 --> 00:51:21,540
and what you'll notice with the mm1500

1236
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:25,520
the the

1237
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:25,520
pulp comes out like dust

1238
00:51:25,859 --> 00:51:28,640
so dry

1239
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:34,220
incredible

1240
00:51:31,099 --> 00:51:34,220
all right

1241
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:42,059
I'm excited and that's the thing that's

1242
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:44,819
real dry pole big difference

1243
00:51:42,059 --> 00:51:46,859
all right you guys

1244
00:51:44,819 --> 00:51:48,660
let's do it

1245
00:51:46,859 --> 00:51:50,339
got your shot glass

1246
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:52,579
I got a bunch of different shot glasses

1247
00:51:50,339 --> 00:51:52,579
now

1248
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:59,300
there we go

1249
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:59,300
[Music]

1250
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:03,839
[Applause]

1251
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:06,839
when you use your brain to heal your

1252
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:08,720
brain and you use your soul to feel your

1253
00:52:06,839 --> 00:52:11,370
brain and you're using your free will

1254
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:14,520
you're using your intentions

1255
00:52:11,370 --> 00:52:14,520
[Applause]

1256
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:23,300
here we go

1257
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:23,300
something special happens inside

1258
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:31,040
you're breaking the rules because down

1259
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:31,040
here on Earth

1260
00:52:31,319 --> 00:52:36,430
it's not easy to heal and it's kind of

1261
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:37,800
been set up like that so people struggle

1262
00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:39,780
[Music]

1263
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:41,760
and they don't find their way

1264
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:43,319
so many sick people around the world but

1265
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:45,780
we can change that

1266
00:52:43,319 --> 00:52:47,819
when we have tools that actually work

1267
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:49,819
and change our lives

1268
00:52:47,819 --> 00:52:53,640
turn things around it is another

1269
00:52:49,819 --> 00:52:56,420
entirely different story

1270
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:56,420
it's incredible

1271
00:52:56,819 --> 00:53:05,510
that's the first step right there

1272

that

1277
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:29,359
is so powerful do you feel that

1278
00:53:26,579 --> 00:53:29,359
feel it inside

1280

incredible you guys

1281
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:47,099
what I notice about the adrenal fight or

1282
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:49,559
flight stabilizer

1283
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:51,540
is it's hitting the brain but then my

1284
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:53,400
brain is sending messages and I'm being

1285
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:55,260
a little bit quiet when I'm drinking

1286
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:58,319
this one because I'm trying to feel the

1287
00:53:55,260 --> 00:54:00,900
sensations and I feel my brain talking

1288
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:02,940
to my adrenals where my brain is

1289
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:04,559
actually connected to my adrenals that's

1290
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:05,640
what I'm getting right now and when I do

1291
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:07,619
this

1292
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:11,160
Anna says oh my God I love the taste

1293
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:13,380
incredible do you guys feel that I gave

1294
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:15,660
it a few seconds

1295
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:18,420
and I feel

1296
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:21,240
what's happening inside Carrie said she

1297
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:24,480
just ordered the 1500 amazing

1298
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:26,700
you guys I can feel my brain talking to

1299
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:28,380
my adrenals and making that connection

1300
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:30,240
through the central nervous system

1301
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:33,480
because your adrenals are directly

1302
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:35,579
connected wire to your vagus nerves

1303
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:38,040

wherever you got the books

1320
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:18,720
that would be amazing if you can leave

1321
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:21,359
reviews that would be just incredible

1322
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:24,240
because it it helps other people know

1323
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:27,599
what is in the books and what they can

1324
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:29,819
do to heal and that part all on its own

1325
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:31,920
is so special and remember if you get a

1326
00:55:29,819 --> 00:55:34,980
book remember that

1327
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:37,920
all the books are pristine and they're

1328
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:39,599
clean and they go to the warehouses like

1329
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:41,579
Amazon and other places so when you

1330
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:44,040
order one and they throw it on the

1331
00:55:41,579 --> 00:55:45,900
conveyor belt you might see some dirt or

1332
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:48,119
grease from their conveyor belt go on

1333
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:50,460
your book just get a little dish towel

1334
00:55:48,119 --> 00:55:52,740
or a handy wipe or something put a

1335
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:55,020
little tiny soap on there a damp one

1336
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:57,240
cloth and you just clean off your book

1337
00:55:55,020 --> 00:56:00,240
and it cleans off like brand new because

1338
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:02,400
they are brand new all of them and so

1339
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:04,380
you might get a book that's like that

1340
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:06,300
gets smudged because it goes on the

1341
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:09,119
conveyor belt and it goes on down right

1342
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:11,460
and that whole bit so when you order it

1343
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:14,400
just letting you know

1344
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:16,559
but that shot feels so good what it does

1345
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:19,440
is I could see why it's helping people

1346
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:21,420
sleep at night better because it's it's

1347
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:23,940
rejuvenating my brain

1348
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:26,099
but at the same time supporting my

1349
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:28,980
adrenals and calming me down but

1350
00:56:26,099 --> 00:56:30,839
strengthening me so I can tell now that

1351
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:33,180
later on today I'm gonna have this extra

1352
00:56:30,839 --> 00:56:34,980
burst of energy because everything is

1353
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:36,660
getting recharged my adrenals are

1354
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:40,800
getting recharged what I was doing is

1355
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:45,540
when I was sipping that Juice shot

1356
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:47,520
when I was sipping that brain stabilizer

1357
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:50,099
what I noticed was

1358
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:51,960
it was going to my brain but then my

1359
00:56:50,099 --> 00:56:54,420
brain was sending a message to my

1360
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:57,480
adrenals and I was feeling that message

1361
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:59,579
get driven down my vagus nerves down my

1362
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:01,380
spine down my other nerves and just

1363
00:56:59,579 --> 00:57:03,900
going down my phrenic nerves all of it

1364
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:05,880
and heading down to my adrenals and my

1365
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:08,220
adrenals were actually getting that

1366
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:10,740
information I could feel that they were

1367
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:13,619
getting that information and absorbing

1368
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:15,240
it and it felt so good and all I can

1369
00:57:13,619 --> 00:57:17,760
think clear and feel clear is so much

1370
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:19,559

many imposters right now out there in

social media and they're taking

1427
00:59:31,319 --> 00:59:35,819
advantage of people on their medical

1428
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:38,220

and they don't have the blue check and

1442
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:06,000
they're not verified so look out for

1443
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:07,200
that so the imposters don't have the

1444
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,000

01:02:36,839 --> 01:02:40,980
I was feeling the first Sip and the

1513
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:43,260
second sip go straight to the brain with

1514
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:46,020
the fight-or-flight stabilizer but then

1515
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:49,200
the reason why I got quiet

1516
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:50,040
was I was feeling a sensation go down my

1517
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,540
back

1518
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:53,579
from my brain

1519
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:57,240
and go down through my body through my

1520
01:02:53,579 --> 01:02:59,099
vagus nerves and reach my adrenals so I

1521
01:02:57,240 --> 01:03:00,299
actually was experiencing so what I was

1522
01:02:59,099 --> 01:03:02,700
