[112.56 - 118.32] this is incredible really
[114.24 - 121.36] so look you guys metals are in the way
[118.32 - 124.88] of a lot of people's lives they
[121.36 - 128.00] shape how they think
[124.88 - 131.04] metals take over they
[128.00 - 132.32] actually are like an alien in someone's
[131.04 - 134.56] brain
[132.32 - 137.60] they make people make decisions that
[134.56 - 140.24] people wouldn't even make in their life
[137.60 - 141.68] did you know that metals when they're
[140.24 - 145.36] inside the brain
[141.68 - 149.36] can control people control
[145.36 - 152.32] people metals inside our brain
[149.36 - 154.40] can control us that's something you
[152.32 - 157.84] haven't heard right
[154.40 - 160.16] metals inside the brain can trip us up
[157.84 - 161.84] make us say things we don't want to say
[160.16 - 164.96] in times of our life
[161.84 - 168.32] metals in our brain can throw us off
[164.96 - 170.72] our game in our life
[168.32 - 172.88] that's what they can do they can give us
[170.72 - 174.64] diagnoses that are brain related they
[172.88 - 176.48] can cause us problems they can give us
[174.64 - 179.44] brain fog
[176.48 - 179.84] they can take us off our game like i
[179.44 - 183.20] said
[179.84 - 186.08] of life right and so
[183.20 - 186.96] metals do some things with people they
[186.08 - 190.08] do
[186.96 - 191.44] they can get people depressed
[190.08 - 194.00] when they're not supposed to be
[191.44 - 195.20] depressed sad when they're not supposed
[194.00 - 197.20] to be sad right
[195.20 - 199.28] think about someone who spent years with
[197.20 - 202.56] severe depression
[199.28 - 205.12] think about that severe depression
[202.56 - 206.88] because the metals inside the brain are
[205.12 - 209.52] creating that situation
[206.88 - 211.12] so think about how that shapes someone's
[209.52 - 214.16] life
[211.12 - 217.92] right toxic heavy metals
[214.16 - 220.16] inside the brain and brain stem
[217.92 - 222.08] shaping someone's life into something
[220.16 - 224.16] that they may not have wanted to be
[222.08 - 225.12] or something that was happening severe
[224.16 - 227.84] depression
[225.12 - 228.72] crippling panic and anxiety for years
[227.84 - 231.76] that too
[228.72 - 234.32] right so this is important this is so
[231.76 - 236.96] critical to get metals out of us
[234.32 - 237.68] so we can live free because you can't
[236.96 - 241.28] live
[237.68 - 241.68] free metals do shape things that we may
[241.28 - 244.08] not
[241.68 - 245.60] want shaped in the way they become
[244.08 - 247.28] shaped and we don't like that

[761.36 - 766.24] extra excited i am
[764.56 - 768.64] so what you see in front of me just so
[766.24 - 770.32] you know you see spirulina
[768.64 - 771.92] that's the vimergy spirulina it's the
[770.32 - 772.56] best one it's so one that i trust i
[771.92 - 775.36] don't trust
[772.56 - 776.88] pacific spirulina anymore for a lot of
[775.36 - 779.12] reasons
[776.88 - 781.20] a lot of reasons i've talked about it's
[779.12 - 782.88] terrible
[781.20 - 785.68] and what you see is barley grass juice
[782.88 - 788.00] powder not barley grass
[785.68 - 789.52] right it's the vimergy stuff i'm not
[788.00 - 790.56] sponsored by beemerjeep the stuff's
[789.52 - 794.00] amazing
[790.56 - 797.84] right and then
[794.00 - 800.72] you also see some wild blueberries these
[797.84 - 802.08] are frozen wild blueberries i defrosted
[800.72 - 804.16] right so there's a frozen wild
[802.08 - 806.48] blueberries that are frosted
[804.16 - 807.28] now you can't find frozen wild
[806.48 - 810.80] blueberries
[807.28 - 814.32] to do this cleanse then maybe grab
[810.80 - 817.60] another wild blueberry food
[814.32 - 819.68] like right here that's the wild
[817.60 - 822.32] blueberry powder from vimergy so maybe
[819.68 - 825.92] grab a wild blueberry food
[822.32 - 828.48] right that's the wyman's by the way um
[825.92 - 830.48] the wyman's juice is back in stock which
[828.48 - 831.84] blows my mind because
[830.48 - 833.60] i've been praying it would come back to
[831.84 - 834.80] stock and
[833.60 - 836.72] it's incredible you know there's a
[834.80 - 838.32] discount on cases
[836.72 - 840.64] so when you get a case you save more
[838.32 - 843.92] money too on top of it
[840.64 - 845.84] so that's at shop.wymans.com
[843.92 - 848.48] um i'm going to show you how i use it
[845.84 - 851.68] i'm excited about that
[848.48 - 857.20] this is just such a great day all right
[851.68 - 858.32] so here we go we got our celery juice
[857.20 - 860.40] right there i'm going to remove the
[858.32 - 864.56] juicer
[860.40 - 870.00] thank you for being patient right
[864.56 - 872.16] remove that
[870.00 - 873.36] how many ounces of celery juice do you
[872.16 - 875.68] guys do
[873.36 - 877.04] okay you gotta strain the celery juice
[875.68 - 878.96] right don't add anything
[877.04 - 880.40] you guys know that you guys know that
[878.96 - 883.68] not to add anything
[880.40 - 887.76] don't put ice in there don't add water
[883.68 - 891.28] don't do any of that so no water no ice
[887.76 - 895.84] right no apple cider
[891.28 - 899.28] vinegar god forbid that's a tragedy
[895.84 - 901.60] to actually add that in here
[899.28 - 901.60] okay
[904.08 - 908.08] so we got our celeries use 16 to 32
[906.16 - 910.56] ounces celery juice that's the next part
[908.08 - 911.76] of the heavy metal detox cleanse if
[910.56 - 914.24] you're sensitive and
[911.76 - 915.68] you all this is a lot because you're
[914.24 - 918.24] really toxic
[915.68 - 918.72] your nerves are really sensitive from
[918.24 - 920.48] all those
[918.72 - 921.60] metals and all those pathogens and
[920.48 - 922.88] there's someone that's sick with all
[921.60 - 924.48] kinds of stuff going on
[922.88 - 926.00] maybe do a little bit of celery juice
[924.48 - 927.76] four or eight ounces
[926.00 - 929.92] maybe do four or eight ounces of lemon
[927.76 - 931.92] water maybe do that maybe do four or
[929.92 - 932.40] eight ounces of the smoothie we're about
[931.92 - 934.16] to do
[932.40 - 935.60] and then you build up and you build up
[934.16 - 936.16] and then you can feel like whoa i could
[935.60 - 937.76] do more
[936.16 - 939.60] i could do more you're getting the junk
[937.76 - 941.20] out you're okay you're okay
[939.60 - 943.04] you can do more you can do more and it's
[941.20 - 944.56] incredible so that's one way of doing it
[943.04 - 947.28] you guys so i have a celery juice right
[944.56 - 948.64] here so 16 to 32 ounce celery juice
[947.28 - 950.64] is a great thing there's a question on
[948.64 - 953.28] tick-tock right there why is adding
[950.64 - 955.04] water bad because you dilute the sodium
[953.28 - 958.16] cluster salts the very thing that
[955.04 - 959.76] magically helps us heal celery juices
[958.16 - 960.96] phytochemical compounds that have to
[959.76 - 963.84] stay
[960.96 - 964.24] suspended in a living solution right
[963.84 - 965.60] here
[964.24 - 967.04] you don't want to dilute it you don't
[965.60 - 968.32] want to add anything if you hear out
[967.04 - 969.12] there someone adding lemon to their
[968.32 - 970.80] cellar juice
[969.12 - 972.48] they just lost what celery juice does
[970.80 - 975.04] for them they just lost it
[972.48 - 977.20] boom they just lost it another thing too
[975.04 - 977.84] don't do hpp so when you go into the
[977.20 - 980.24] store
[977.84 - 981.60] and you see a celery juice that's in
[980.24 - 983.92] like a brand
[981.60 - 985.76] and the brand is in the cold section you
[983.92 - 986.16] guys of the store the health food store
[985.76 - 989.52] right
[986.16 - 989.92] and it says fresh or just not just juice
[989.52 - 992.00] but
[989.92 - 993.76] it says fresh celery juice or something
[992.00 - 996.08] and it's in a bottle
[993.76 - 998.32] and it wasn't freshly juiced that day
[996.08 - 1000.64] instead it was manufactured right
[998.32 - 1002.16] off an assembly line okay that's called
[1000.64 - 1003.84] high pressure pasteurization
[1002.16 - 1005.36] you don't want that kind of celery juice
[1003.84 - 1007.60] it doesn't work high pressure
[1005.36 - 1010.24] pasteurization which is hpp
[1007.60 - 1011.52] that's a trick so you just get full what
[1010.24 - 1013.04] happens is in the health movement
[1011.52 - 1013.92] everybody gets screwed over constantly
[1013.04 - 1016.00] they don't know it
[1013.92 - 1017.36] they throw away their money they get
[1016.00 - 1019.76] they don't even know what's happening
[1017.36 - 1022.64] they're buying hpp products that's not
[1019.76 - 1025.44] fresh celery juice gotta make it fresh
[1022.64 - 1027.44] or a juice bar makes it fresh for you
[1025.44 - 1029.52] and that's a different story because
[1027.44 - 1031.28] that's how you make it work
[1029.52 - 1032.64] and then you might be somebody that says
[1031.28 - 1033.84] hey i did celery juice and it didn't
[1032.64 - 1034.64] work it's like well you've been doing
[1033.84 - 1036.32] hpp
[1034.64 - 1037.84] you've been adding lemon to it or you've
[1036.32 - 1039.60] been doing something else
[1037.84 - 1041.60] you're not doing the way it's supposed
[1039.60 - 1043.68] to be so we're day one medical medium
[1041.60 - 1046.24] heavy metal detox cleanse challenge
[1043.68 - 1047.36] we're going through day one right now
[1046.24 - 1048.88] i'm excited
[1047.36 - 1051.52] what kind of juicer is that that's the
[1048.88 - 1053.20] mm-900 hds
[1051.52 - 1055.68] that's the one it's the celery juicer
[1053.20 - 1058.64] model it cuts your celery
[1055.68 - 1060.08] cost literally almost in half i've saved
[1058.64 - 1061.28] thousands of dollars with that juicer
[1060.08 - 1063.92] it's the only juicer that pays for
[1061.28 - 1066.16] itself so that's the mm-900 hds
[1063.92 - 1067.12] at omegajuicers.com if you're interested
[1066.16 - 1069.20] i get asked that
[1067.12 - 1070.96] question all the time all the time but
[1069.20 - 1072.24] that's the specific one if you don't get
[1070.96 - 1074.96] that one it's not going to do
[1072.24 - 1076.80] what it needs to do so 15 to 30 minutes
[1074.96 - 1079.12] right between let's do a recap really
[1076.80 - 1081.84] quick so we got the lemon water okay
[1079.12 - 1082.96] 16 to 32 ounces of lemon water right
[1081.84 - 1086.00] there empty stomach
[1082.96 - 1089.04] upon waking what you're doing so you
[1086.00 - 1092.40] know you're preparing to remove metals
[1089.04 - 1095.60] the lemon water hydrates you have to be
[1092.40 - 1099.60] hydrated in order to get metals out
[1095.60 - 1102.64] efficiently critical you guys
[1099.60 - 1106.00] have to be hydrated in order to get
[1102.64 - 1108.56] metals out efficiently that's
[1106.00 - 1109.44] how it works so you get the 16 to 32
[1108.56 - 1112.48] ounces
[1109.44 - 1115.28] of lemon water wait 15 to 30
[1112.48 - 1116.48] minutes and then you're off to getting
[1115.28 - 1118.72] your celery juice
[1116.48 - 1120.72] got to strain your celery juice can't
[1118.72 - 1123.60] add anything into it into it like i said
[1120.72 - 1126.24] no water no lemon no nothing no ice
[1123.60 - 1127.84] no anything no apple no nothing then you
[1126.24 - 1130.96] got your celery juice
[1127.84 - 1133.68] once again you're hydrating
[1130.96 - 1134.96] but celery juice the sodium cluster salt
[1133.68 - 1138.24] starts to
[1134.96 - 1140.96] dislodge metals like it gets it
[1138.24 - 1142.08] prepped it gets metals prepped it helps
[1140.96 - 1144.64] to loosen them

[1476.16 - 1479.92] don't even know what to say thank you
[1477.60 - 1482.00] for being here so exciting
[1479.92 - 1483.12] so the wild blueberry is the star you
[1482.00 - 1486.56] guys
[1483.12 - 1488.48] it does so much right so
[1486.56 - 1490.40] nutrition in the wild blueberry is
[1488.48 - 1492.48] understudied so they don't even
[1490.40 - 1494.24] they don't even have really the
[1492.48 - 1495.52] understanding of why the wild blueberry
[1494.24 - 1497.84] is so amazing
[1495.52 - 1499.68] cultivated blueberries are weak they're
[1497.84 - 1501.68] still good for you but they're weak so
[1499.68 - 1502.48] the big cultivated blueberry in the
[1501.68 - 1504.96] store
[1502.48 - 1505.92] is actually a weakened version of this
[1504.96 - 1508.40] right here
[1505.92 - 1510.64] this is the original this is not just
[1508.40 - 1512.40] heirloom but this is a wild food
[1510.64 - 1514.48] and medical medium information is about
[1512.40 - 1515.12] wild foods and it always was about wild
[1514.48 - 1517.44] foods
[1515.12 - 1518.88] medical medium information isn't fruits
[1517.44 - 1522.32] and vegetables
[1518.88 - 1523.60] it's wild foods that's something to know
[1522.32 - 1526.16] and it's so important
[1523.60 - 1528.00] okay susan says the book has so much
[1526.16 - 1531.04] info that changes lives you're really
[1528.00 - 1532.48] missing a lot if you don't have it all
[1531.04 - 1534.40] of anthony's books are valuable
[1532.48 - 1535.12] reference books that will help you stay
[1534.40 - 1537.28] healthy
[1535.12 - 1539.20] or regain health thank you for sue thank
[1537.28 - 1541.76] you for susan for saying that thank you
[1539.20 - 1543.20] for that so let's get the blueberries in
[1541.76 - 1545.68] here
[1543.20 - 1548.08] blueberries can cross the blood-brain
[1545.68 - 1550.72] barrier when they're wild
[1548.08 - 1551.84] wild blueberries cross the blood-brain
[1550.72 - 1555.12] barrier
[1551.84 - 1556.00] important to know right there cultivated
[1555.12 - 1559.60] blueberries
[1556.00 - 1562.96] don't cross the blood-brain barrier
[1559.60 - 1566.16] critical information right there to know
[1562.96 - 1567.84] right so let's scoop some in we'll talk
[1566.16 - 1568.64] about wild blueberries a little bit more
[1567.84 - 1570.00] and a little bit more
[1568.64 - 1571.92] right so these are frozen wild
[1570.00 - 1574.32] blueberries right here
[1571.92 - 1576.72] can't do lemon water even a tiny amount
[1574.32 - 1578.16] do water in the morning if you can't do
[1576.72 - 1582.56] lemon water
[1578.16 - 1585.84] not even a tiny amount do regular water
[1582.56 - 1588.88] that's okay let's do that right
[1585.84 - 1589.92] or squeeze a tiny amount of lemon in
[1588.88 - 1592.48] your water
[1589.92 - 1594.40] if you can't do lemon now you might not
[1592.48 - 1595.76] you might say you can't do lemon because
[1594.40 - 1597.04] you've been told by your dentist that
[1595.76 - 1599.20] it's bad for your teeth
[1597.04 - 1601.20] don't stop it because of that reason
[1599.20 - 1604.00] because that's not true
[1601.20 - 1604.80] you might not do lemon because you think
[1604.00 - 1608.80] it's
[1604.80 - 1612.00] uh acidic and it's bad for you
[1608.80 - 1615.36] it's not true it's alkaline lemon
[1612.00 - 1617.68] is alkaline pretty cool right you guys
[1615.36 - 1619.44] this is about information powerful
[1617.68 - 1622.00] information important information
[1619.44 - 1623.28] two cups of wild blueberries that's what
[1622.00 - 1624.72] we're doing in here putting a little bit
[1623.28 - 1626.48] more we should have that
[1624.72 - 1627.92] two cups of wild blueberries inside the
[1626.48 - 1631.60] smoothie
[1627.92 - 1633.20] so we're gonna put this down okay
[1631.60 - 1636.64] let's start putting the rest of this
[1633.20 - 1639.76] together bananas
[1636.64 - 1641.20] important to have the glucose now i got
[1639.76 - 1643.20] substitutions
[1641.20 - 1645.04] for people who are afraid of bananas or
[1643.20 - 1646.24] maybe they don't do good with bananas or
[1645.04 - 1648.00] somebody that might have allergic
[1646.24 - 1651.52] reaction to bananas sure
[1648.00 - 1653.92] it's it's very possible right now
[1651.52 - 1655.60] with the wild blueberry okay let's just
[1653.92 - 1657.20] finish the wild blueberry information
[1655.60 - 1658.72] though okay i was going to do it
[1657.20 - 1660.40] add it a little later but i'm going to
[1658.72 - 1663.36] do it now
[1660.40 - 1665.52] all right so if you don't have frozen
[1663.36 - 1667.84] wild blueberries
[1665.52 - 1669.84] then pick up a wild blueberry powder
[1667.84 - 1672.72] that's the vimergy wild blueberry powder
[1669.84 - 1674.48] right so that's one option because some
[1672.72 - 1675.44] people they can't get the frozen wild
[1674.48 - 1676.72] blueberries
[1675.44 - 1679.28] depending on where they are around the
[1676.72 - 1680.32] world what they can get the vimergy wild
[1679.28 - 1681.68] blueberry powder
[1680.32 - 1684.24] so that's the best one right there that
[1681.68 - 1686.48] i use okay so
[1684.24 - 1690.64] i what i do anyways i put a little in
[1686.48 - 1690.64] anyway with the frozen wild blueberries
[1690.88 - 1694.80] so i'm gonna put some of that in that's
[1693.36 - 1698.88] right there
[1694.80 - 1698.88] i call that gold
[1699.04 - 1705.60] got that right there i also put
[1702.32 - 1707.36] the wyman's juice they got a new stock
[1705.60 - 1707.92] and you guys know i work with wyman's
[1707.36 - 1709.84] right
[1707.92 - 1711.20] i'm making sure this product stays alive
[1709.84 - 1713.04] stays out there
[1711.20 - 1715.44] um because people don't realize what it
[1713.04 - 1717.44] takes to harvest wild blueberries
[1715.44 - 1719.28] and then actually squeeze it down to a
[1717.44 - 1721.36] juice it's an incredible process
[1719.28 - 1722.64] it's an incredible process so i actually
[1721.36 - 1725.76] support
[1722.64 - 1728.08] uh wyman's 100 with this juice it's and
[1725.76 - 1729.57] it's an incredible product
[1728.08 - 1732.12] you're if you're ever interested it's
[1729.57 - 1733.52] [Music]
[1732.12 - 1735.28] shop.wymans.com
[1733.52 - 1737.36] they have it there i buy it by the case
[1735.28 - 1739.36] you get like 13
[1737.36 - 1741.20] discount off of each bottle when it's
[1739.36 - 1741.68] that way so i put about two ounces in
[1741.20 - 1745.04] here
[1741.68 - 1746.48] right two to four out look if you don't
[1745.04 - 1747.60] have wild blueberry frozen wild
[1746.48 - 1749.44] blueberries you could do two to four
[1747.60 - 1751.76] ounces of this in the smoothie
[1749.44 - 1753.20] you can do that i just throw two ounces
[1751.76 - 1756.32] in with my wild blueberries
[1753.20 - 1758.08] and my vemma g powder but you know
[1756.32 - 1760.56] the blueberry powder right but the point
[1758.08 - 1763.36] is is you can do
[1760.56 - 1764.16] um you can do two to four ounces of this
[1763.36 - 1767.20] no problem
[1764.16 - 1769.76] if that's all you have is this
[1767.20 - 1771.28] so it's good to find other options in
[1769.76 - 1771.92] case you don't have the frozen wild
[1771.28 - 1773.36] blueberries
[1771.92 - 1776.72] so here we go we've got that covered
[1773.36 - 1781.84] let's go into banana land
[1776.72 - 1781.84] two bananas right
[1781.92 - 1787.84] one banana down another
[1786.08 - 1790.00] we're talking about glucose right here
[1787.84 - 1793.76] right now glucose
[1790.00 - 1796.56] carries the properties
[1793.76 - 1798.00] in the wild blueberry and the properties
[1796.56 - 1800.32] in the rest of
[1798.00 - 1802.24] of um the smoothie that we're going to
[1800.32 - 1805.20] talk about carries the properties the
[1802.24 - 1808.24] glucose carries to enter the cells
[1805.20 - 1810.64] if someone's on like no carb
[1808.24 - 1811.52] no sugar from fruit i'm scared of all
[1810.64 - 1813.52] that
[1811.52 - 1814.72] then how are you going to get the metals
[1813.52 - 1817.20] out because
[1814.72 - 1818.32] glucose is what carries every nutrient
[1817.20 - 1820.64] into a cell
[1818.32 - 1822.56] do you know how you can age really fast
[1820.64 - 1825.20] you want to age really quick
[1822.56 - 1826.16] don't eat any fruit don't ever eat any
[1825.20 - 1828.08] potato
[1826.16 - 1829.52] don't have any kind of critical clean
[1828.08 - 1832.24] carbohydrate that's what i call
[1829.52 - 1833.68] medical medium in the books critical
[1832.24 - 1835.68] clean carbohydrates
[1833.68 - 1838.24] don't have any of that be afraid of that
[1835.68 - 1840.16] completely just do some vegetables and
[1838.24 - 1840.72] some animal protein or some vegetables
[1840.16 - 1842.88] and nuts
[1840.72 - 1844.40] or whatever if you know people do and
[1842.88 - 1846.00] and they like stay with that whole thing
[1844.40 - 1848.48] where they they're afraid of sugar and
[1846.00 - 1850.72] you will age so fast down the line
[1848.48 - 1852.40] because you need the glucose to carry
[1850.72 - 1855.04] the nutrients
[1852.40 - 1857.36] in so now if you're afraid of banana i
[1855.04 - 1860.08] got alternatives right here okay
[1857.36 - 1861.76] i got mango i'll crack one of these open
[1860.08 - 1864.24] right
[1861.76 - 1865.84] so i got mango that's an alternative
[1864.24 - 1867.76] papaya's another one
[1865.84 - 1870.32] so i'll have to get that out a little
[1867.76 - 1872.72] bit but i got the mango
[1870.32 - 1874.56] and you can do frozen mango so that's an
[1872.72 - 1876.24] option too he's putting frozen mango in
[1874.56 - 1877.68] here that's okay if you do that
[1876.24 - 1879.36] you guys just got on here we're talking
[1877.68 - 1881.76] about day one
[1879.36 - 1883.68] of the medical medium heavy metal detox
[1881.76 - 1884.32] cleanse challenge it's going on three
[1883.68 - 1886.52] days
[1884.32 - 1890.00] do you have the book get it from
[1886.52 - 1892.24] amazon.com us 16.99 51
[1890.00 - 1894.00] off right there or try to find it in a
[1892.24 - 1894.64] local bookstore or barnes noble or
[1894.00 - 1896.24] something
[1894.64 - 1897.52] or try to get the library but the
[1896.24 - 1899.28] waiting listing libraries are here is
[1897.52 - 1900.80] like it takes times that might not be
[1899.28 - 1901.92] that beneficial right now while we're
[1900.80 - 1904.48] doing the cleanse
[1901.92 - 1906.96] but get a hold of the book page 179 the
[1904.48 - 1908.72] heavy metal detox cleanse is on here
[1906.96 - 1910.56] critical to have the details the details
[1908.72 - 1912.48] matter the information's right here
[1910.56 - 1914.00] we're doing this cleanse we just talked
[1912.48 - 1915.76] about the wild blueberries now we're
[1914.00 - 1920.88] adding the bananas
[1915.76 - 1923.68] let's move on to something else cilantro
[1920.88 - 1925.68] let's get cilantro in there now even if
[1923.68 - 1928.08] you don't like cilantro
[1925.68 - 1929.04] but you you you'll you'll put a little
[1928.08 - 1931.60] in that's okay
[1929.04 - 1933.12] put a little in then if that's what you
[1931.60 - 1935.76] that's all you can do
[1933.12 - 1937.84] right put a little bit in there can you
[1935.76 - 1938.80] blend the papaya with the seeds i
[1937.84 - 1941.12] wouldn't no way
[1938.80 - 1942.80] no way the seeds are edible i've been
[1941.12 - 1943.92] teaching that for years since i was a
[1942.80 - 1947.44] child the seeds
[1943.92 - 1948.88] are edible but you don't want the seeds
[1947.44 - 1950.64] in the smoothie okay
[1948.88 - 1951.76] if you want to eat a couple of teaspoons
[1950.64 - 1952.80] of the seeds while you're eating the
[1951.76 - 1955.20] papaya
[1952.80 - 1956.00] right you can always do that but they're
[1955.20 - 1959.20] spicy
[1956.00 - 1960.56] and they're gritty very gritty you don't
[1959.20 - 1962.16] want them in here there's no need to
[1960.56 - 1964.40] have them in here
[1962.16 - 1966.08] so we're putting some cilantro in here
[1964.40 - 1968.24] let's do that
[1966.08 - 1969.92] i like putting a lot of cilantro i like
[1968.24 - 1972.80] having a cup of cilantro
[1969.92 - 1975.68] right you can do less if you want you
[1972.80 - 1979.52] can do a little bit more if you want
[1975.68 - 1982.56] cilantro works really well
[1979.52 - 1985.84] in removing toxic heavy metals
[1982.56 - 1988.88] when it's got the other four
[1985.84 - 1991.92] players involved that's
[1988.88 - 1994.64] critical to know you want the cilantro
[1991.92 - 1995.68] fresh and raw because it's got the
[1994.64 - 1999.04] living
[1995.68 - 2000.64] water inside of it if you don't like the
[1999.04 - 2003.04] taste of cilantro
[2000.64 - 2004.96] that means you're high in toxic heavy
[2003.04 - 2005.76] metals all these tips are really
[2004.96 - 2007.28] important
[2005.76 - 2008.88] got the cilantro in there now we're
[2007.28 - 2010.32] doing bananas so we don't need to crack
[2008.88 - 2011.92] open the mango
[2010.32 - 2013.52] i can maybe cut it open a little while
[2011.92 - 2018.72] but we don't have to do that right now
[2013.52 - 2021.60] so let's move on a little bit
[2018.72 - 2023.04] what about cilantro tincture marcy nope
[2021.60 - 2025.36] it won't do the same thing
[2023.04 - 2027.44] not even close it won't be enough it
[2025.36 - 2028.96] won't be enough with one dropper full
[2027.44 - 2030.88] you'd have to use the whole bottle and
[2028.96 - 2032.72] that's not going to work and be enough
[2030.88 - 2034.00] so cilantro tincture is not the way to
[2032.72 - 2036.56] go
[2034.00 - 2038.08] i mean it's real listen if you don't
[2036.56 - 2040.16] have the cilantro you can't get the
[2038.08 - 2042.08] cilantro keep it out of the smoothie
[2040.16 - 2043.60] i'd rather have you keep that out of the
[2042.08 - 2047.84] smoothie i'd rather have you
[2043.60 - 2047.84] not do the cilantro tincture
[2048.00 - 2052.64] okay then meaning like i'd rather have
[2050.88 - 2053.76] you just not do any cilantro at all if
[2052.64 - 2054.72] you're gonna use the tincture is what i
[2053.76 - 2057.20] mean

[2091.92 - 2095.92] incredible there's a lot of a lot of
[2094.40 - 2099.92] incredible reasons why it's good
[2095.92 - 2101.60] right this means it's been juiced
[2099.92 - 2103.04] it's been juiced this is the barley
[2101.60 - 2106.16] grass juice
[2103.04 - 2109.44] powder it's the only way to make it work
[2106.16 - 2111.36] in the heavy metal cleanse
[2109.44 - 2112.96] important details really you know let's
[2111.36 - 2117.12] put a teaspoon in there
[2112.96 - 2118.88] it's fine we got that
[2117.12 - 2120.72] so what are the players we have in here
[2118.88 - 2123.20] right now we got the wild blueberries

[2123.20 - 2126.16] blueberry powder right we got the wild
[2124.80 - 2128.72] blueberry
[2126.16 - 2130.40] we got that one right the kingpin the
[2128.72 - 2132.88] wild blueberry
[2130.40 - 2134.56] that's in here then we got the cilantro
[2132.88 - 2136.40] that's another important one now we got
[2134.56 - 2138.08] the barley grass juice powder that's
[2136.40 - 2142.96] another one in here
[2138.08 - 2146.00] what's next spirulina spirulina
[2142.96 - 2148.88] don't get this confused
[2146.00 - 2150.48] by the sales people who are pushing
[2148.88 - 2152.96] chlorella
[2150.48 - 2155.84] don't get that confused don't be like
[2152.96 - 2158.00] whoa i hear about heavy metals
[2155.84 - 2159.84] aw is talking about it let me go and
[2158.00 - 2162.48] check into oh chlorella
[2159.84 - 2164.96] hey claire clarell is good you know
[2162.48 - 2167.44] don't get confused by all the admin
[2164.96 - 2169.04] the thousands of them and the chlorella
[2167.44 - 2171.36] trolls that are being paid
[2169.04 - 2173.28] by the thousands of them being paid by
[2171.36 - 2175.36] chlorella companies to try to
[2173.28 - 2177.20] get that stuff out there don't get
[2175.36 - 2180.64] thrown off the track
[2177.20 - 2181.36] chlorella is dangerous for a lot of
[2180.64 - 2183.92] people
[2181.36 - 2184.40] how it's caused them to throw their guts
[2183.92 - 2186.72] up
[2184.40 - 2187.92] for weeks at a time hugging onto their
[2186.72 - 2190.24] toilet
[2187.92 - 2191.12] it's not properly checked with bacteria
[2190.24 - 2195.12] chlorella
[2191.12 - 2197.60] harbors bacteria it's a bacteria harbor
[2195.12 - 2199.52] not to mention even in a perfect world
[2197.60 - 2202.08] the best chlorella out there
[2199.52 - 2203.12] without bacteria will not get metals out
[2202.08 - 2205.84] of the brain
[2203.12 - 2208.56] so important chlorella is irresponsible
[2205.84 - 2212.00] it drops metal even if it picked it
[2208.56 - 2212.88] up important to know drops it that means
[2212.00 - 2215.20] if chlorella
[2212.88 - 2216.00] is moving metal it moves it into more
[2215.20 - 2218.08] tissue
[2216.00 - 2219.20] it doesn't carry it with it all the way
[2218.08 - 2221.76] out of the body
[2219.20 - 2223.20] do not get confused with chlorella which
[2221.76 - 2226.32] doesn't work
[2223.20 - 2228.16] with spirulina which does work very
[2226.32 - 2230.16] important to know
[2228.16 - 2233.28] okay and to answer a question i just saw
[2230.16 - 2236.00] barley grass juice powder is gluten free
[2233.28 - 2237.12] barley grass juice powder at least the
[2236.00 - 2240.32] let me correct that
[2237.12 - 2240.80] at least the vimergy barley grass juice
[2240.32 - 2242.80] powder
[2240.80 - 2244.32] is gluten free i can't speak for any
[2242.80 - 2247.52] other barley grass juice powder
[2244.32 - 2250.96] companies okay or whatever right
[2247.52 - 2252.72] frozen cilantro another question frozen
[2250.96 - 2255.36] cilantro is okay
[2252.72 - 2256.00] but use it right after meaning use it
[2255.36 - 2258.08] right when you
[2256.00 - 2261.76] pull it out of that freezer don't let it
[2258.08 - 2263.52] defrost and turn into yuck muck
[2261.76 - 2265.52] don't let the cilantro come out of the
[2263.52 - 2268.64] freezer and defrost
[2265.52 - 2270.64] in a bag or on the counter and turn into
[2268.64 - 2273.12] yucky muck
[2270.64 - 2274.72] it won't work it can only work when you
[2273.12 - 2275.12] throw that stuff in there while it's
[2274.72 - 2276.88] still
[2275.12 - 2278.32] frozen frozen state you throw it in
[2276.88 - 2279.68] there
[2278.32 - 2281.52] that's important to know all these
[2279.68 - 2284.64] details matter
[2281.52 - 2287.04] spirulina is critical
[2284.64 - 2288.16] for the heavy metal detox smoothie it's
[2287.04 - 2290.40] another star
[2288.16 - 2292.08] in the smoothie it's another star in the
[2290.40 - 2293.36] heavy metal detox cleanse if you're
[2292.08 - 2294.48] somebody that can only do a little bit
[2293.36 - 2295.68] do a little bit
[2294.48 - 2297.76] if you're someone that's you know that's
[2295.68 - 2299.60] someone that's sensitive to a little bit
[2297.76 - 2300.96] i mean a lot of sense of people do a lot
[2299.60 - 2302.40] but if you're someone you can just do a
[2300.96 - 2302.80] little bit of the smoothie a little bit
[2302.40 - 2304.00] of this
[2302.80 - 2305.84] a little bit of that in here a little
[2304.00 - 2308.64] bit of cilantro a little bit you can you
[2305.84 - 2310.64] can baby step it if you need to right
[2308.64 - 2312.48] and that's okay could do a quarter
[2310.64 - 2314.00] teaspoon instead of a teaspoon
[2312.48 - 2315.44] so there's the spirulina it's the best
[2314.00 - 2317.04] spirulina out there it's the bemergey
[2315.44 - 2319.28] spirulina by far
[2317.04 - 2321.20] the best stuff on the market i used to
[2319.28 - 2322.00] like the pacific many years ago this is
[2321.20 - 2323.68] the only thing
[2322.00 - 2325.68] that was out there that was decent
[2323.68 - 2328.00] enough but this supersedes it
[2325.68 - 2328.72] problem is pacific ocean has gotten real
[2328.00 - 2330.64] nasty
[2328.72 - 2332.16] i wouldn't swim in there if someone paid
[2330.64 - 2334.08] me to and someone said
[2332.16 - 2335.28] hey medical medium go surfing in the
[2334.08 - 2336.56] pacific ocean
[2335.28 - 2338.32] you know we'll give you ten thousand
[2336.56 - 2339.84] dollars every time you ride a wave in
[2338.32 - 2341.76] i'll be like no way am i letting that
[2339.84 - 2343.84] pacific ocean water touch me it's so
[2341.76 - 2347.68] polluted at this point with dioxin
[2343.84 - 2350.16] and metals it's out of control so anyway
[2347.68 - 2350.80] um keep that in mind that's that i don't
[2350.16 - 2353.92] recommend
[2350.80 - 2355.60] pacific spirulinas anymore not to
[2353.92 - 2358.48] mention i found something
[2355.60 - 2359.60] one of the pacific spirulina companies
[2358.48 - 2362.24] uh jar
[2359.60 - 2364.08] that i actually contacted company to
[2362.24 - 2365.44] talk to and they blew me off and it was
[2364.08 - 2366.56] dangerous what i found in one of their
[2365.44 - 2369.44] jars
[2366.56 - 2370.56] bottom line anyway spirulina right here
[2369.44 - 2372.64] got the vimergy
[2370.56 - 2374.24] so let's go let's keep on moving along
[2372.64 - 2376.72] we're not sponsored by bimergy but your
[2374.24 - 2379.76] stuff's amazing
[2376.72 - 2382.48] all right juice from one orange
[2379.76 - 2383.28] one orange here's a question that comes
[2382.48 - 2384.96] up all the time
[2383.28 - 2387.84] some people say can i put the whole
[2384.96 - 2390.64] orange in there don't put the rind
[2387.84 - 2392.96] don't put the rind in there yes you can
[2390.64 - 2394.40] put the orange inside in there you don't
[2392.96 - 2395.28] have to just do the juice from one
[2394.40 - 2398.16] orange
[2395.28 - 2400.72] i do the juice i look sometimes you guys
[2398.16 - 2402.40] i'll do juice from two oranges
[2400.72 - 2404.48] i like two oranges in there and the
[2402.40 - 2406.16] juice in there okay you can do that you
[2404.48 - 2407.12] can add a little bit more banana a
[2406.16 - 2409.52] little bit more
[2407.12 - 2411.20] orange a little bit more orange in my
[2409.52 - 2413.36] smoothie you can do that right
[2411.20 - 2415.92] okay i'm squeezing this in just like
[2413.36 - 2419.44] this just juice from one
[2415.92 - 2419.44] orange going in my smoothie
[2420.24 - 2425.04] love a little extra vitamin c a little
[2423.20 - 2428.08] extra calcium
[2425.04 - 2429.36] oranges are extremely alkaline inside
[2428.08 - 2431.04] the body
[2429.36 - 2434.88] which is great to do when you're
[2431.04 - 2437.36] removing metals extremely alkaline right
[2434.88 - 2438.48] if you can't do orange juice do a half a
[2437.36 - 2441.92] cup of water
[2438.48 - 2444.64] or coconut water half a cup of water or
[2441.92 - 2446.40] coconut water if you guys just if you
[2444.64 - 2447.52] guys just woke up and you got here you

[2465.52 - 2471.52] doing the cleanse challenge right now
[2467.60 - 2473.92] if your coconut water is pink toss it
[2471.52 - 2475.12] if your coconut water is red toss it
[2473.92 - 2477.68] another scam
[2475.12 - 2479.28] in the world of health all right
[2477.68 - 2481.92] everybody just gets
[2479.28 - 2482.96] totally jaked over it's a major scam
[2481.92 - 2486.00] going on
[2482.96 - 2486.80] pink and red coconut water went bad it's
[2486.00 - 2489.76] rancid
[2486.80 - 2490.40] but the problem is okay coconut water
[2489.76 - 2492.80] companies
[2490.40 - 2494.00] lie and say it's good for you and it's
[2492.80 - 2497.44] the good stuff
[2494.00 - 2498.64] because if they don't lie and say that
[2497.44 - 2500.48] then they're not going to be able to
[2498.64 - 2502.72] sell as much coconut water because their
[2500.48 - 2504.88] coconut water is going bad
[2502.72 - 2507.12] that's what that means when it's red and
[2504.88 - 2508.32] pink that means the coconut water went
[2507.12 - 2510.64] rancid
[2508.32 - 2512.96] that's what happens so don't do the pink
[2510.64 - 2516.80] and red coconut water important to know
[2512.96 - 2520.72] okay so let's see

[2881.28 - 2883.44] know
[2884.64 - 2887.84] something that's
[2889.28 - 2892.40] and i'm going to move this over
[2892.56 - 2895.76] so what i'm going to make
[2896.00 - 2901.84] something a little different here right
[2904.40 - 2908.80] so i'm gonna do the apples next okay
[2907.20 - 2910.96] apples
[2908.80 - 2914.48] are important in the heavy metal detox
[2910.96 - 2916.48] cleanse right
[2914.48 - 2918.96] but let me use my food processor for
[2916.48 - 2918.96] this one
[2920.56 - 2925.52] you don't want to do fats in the morning
[2923.12 - 2927.12] you don't want to do fats in the morning
[2925.52 - 2928.96] with a heavy metal detox cleanse you
[2927.12 - 2930.48] don't want avocado you don't want oils
[2928.96 - 2931.28] you don't want nut butters you don't
[2930.48 - 2933.28] want nuts
[2931.28 - 2935.52] you don't want any of that in the
[2933.28 - 2936.24] morning because once you do radical fats
[2935.52 - 2939.44] like that
[2936.24 - 2941.36] you just shut your cleanse down you just
[2939.44 - 2943.60] shut it down
[2941.36 - 2945.60] you're doing all that work the heavy
[2943.60 - 2946.48] metal detox smoothie only can take out a
[2945.60 - 2948.96] portion
[2946.48 - 2950.48] a small portion of the metals when
[2948.96 - 2952.08] you're doing all that fat
[2950.48 - 2953.84] because if you're doing avocado with
[2952.08 - 2955.52] your smoothie i'll do the heavy metal
[2953.84 - 2956.08] detox smoothie but i'll throw a half an
[2955.52 - 2957.68] avocado
[2956.08 - 2959.52] in here too because someone said healthy
[2957.68 - 2961.44] fats are good for me let me mix it in
[2959.52 - 2965.12] here boom you just blew it
[2961.44 - 2966.80] blew it you can't get the metals out
[2965.12 - 2968.32] you got to keep the oils out of the

[2998.08 - 3000.32] later on
[2998.80 - 3001.68] if you're an animal protein then you eat
[3000.32 - 3002.40] animal protein at night at the end of
[3001.68 - 3004.08] the day
[3002.40 - 3006.16] you can't do it in your morning you

[3037.76 - 3042.80] can you do one apple before noon
[3040.40 - 3043.60] that's great half an apple i'm okay if
[3042.80 - 3047.36] you do a half an
[3043.60 - 3050.16] apple but the pulp of the apple
[3047.36 - 3052.88] the pulp the pectin of the apple helps
[3050.16 - 3055.12] to carry out some of the metals
[3052.88 - 3056.40] that got excreted out of your liver
[3055.12 - 3058.16] let's head there now we're in the heavy
[3056.40 - 3060.48] metal detox lens we're day one you guys
[3058.16 - 3063.04] this is really important information

[3063.04 - 3066.24] cleanse to heal

[3067.20 - 3071.04] make sure you order the book when you
[3068.56 - 3072.15] can okay let's go let's talk about this
[3071.04 - 3073.52] for a couple of minutes
[3072.15 - 3077.28] [Applause]
[3073.52 - 3080.96] right that's your liver right there
[3077.28 - 3082.80] okay your liver produces bile
[3080.96 - 3084.08] you're doing the heavy metal detox
[3082.80 - 3087.52] cleanse
[3084.08 - 3089.92] your spirulina your wild blueberries
[3087.52 - 3090.64] your cilantro your barley grass juice
[3089.92 - 3093.20] powder
[3090.64 - 3094.88] everything your celery juice all of it
[3093.20 - 3097.20] is working
[3094.88 - 3098.32] on getting those toxic heavy metals out
[3097.20 - 3100.80] of you to free you
[3098.32 - 3102.00] up free you up of conditions and
[3100.80 - 3105.52] symptoms
[3102.00 - 3109.60] right when all that enters
[3105.52 - 3112.56] into the liver it starts to loosen up
[3109.60 - 3116.40] the metals and grabs onto the metals
[3112.56 - 3116.40] and when it grabs onto the metals
[3116.56 - 3123.28] the bile spews up the pipe
[3120.56 - 3126.32] and goes into the intestinal tract that
[3123.28 - 3128.32] bile has toxic heavy metal in it
[3126.32 - 3130.32] keep that in mind that bile has toxic
[3128.32 - 3133.20] heavy metal in it
[3130.32 - 3135.04] so and and the smoothie that you're
[3133.20 - 3136.40] doing in the heavy metal detox cleanse
[3135.04 - 3138.32] is already circulating throughout the
[3136.40 - 3141.60] entire body including the brain
[3138.32 - 3145.04] taking metals out of the brain right
[3141.60 - 3148.96] but the liver is gonna volcano
[3145.04 - 3150.64] volcano that metal out into the bile
[3148.96 - 3152.00] the bile is gonna drop back into the
[3150.64 - 3156.08] intestinal tract
[3152.00 - 3160.88] right you guys and then the apples
[3156.08 - 3164.40] help to carry it out the pectin
[3160.88 - 3168.40] the pulp of the apple helps the bind
[3164.40 - 3171.04] onto that bile that's contaminated
[3168.40 - 3172.72] with toxic heavy metals and pull it out
[3171.04 - 3172.96] of your body you see how important this
[3172.72 - 3176.00] is
[3172.96 - 3179.28] see how details matter so important

[3234.72 - 3238.88] about the liver and but why
[3236.00 - 3239.68] the apples are so important how come the
[3238.88 - 3242.40] apples are
[3239.68 - 3243.28] so important you guys so let's just i
[3242.40 - 3246.80] like making an
[3243.28 - 3249.12] apple sauce from for me for
[3246.80 - 3250.00] for the cleanse right a quick applesauce
[3249.12 - 3251.84] just apples
[3250.00 - 3254.00] though right for this that's what i like
[3251.84 - 3257.20] to do so i take the apples i'm cutting
[3254.00 - 3258.80] them up right here right
[3257.20 - 3260.24] so i like doing this during the heavy
[3258.80 - 3262.16] metal detox cleanse
[3260.24 - 3263.52] for me you guys can just eat the apple
[3262.16 - 3265.04] if you want don't worry
[3263.52 - 3267.12] you can eat the apple if you want if
[3265.04 - 3270.32] that's what you want to do that's fine
[3267.12 - 3271.20] i could totally do that right i toss the
[3270.32 - 3272.48] core
[3271.20 - 3274.40] you know i don't want to grind up the
[3272.48 - 3275.44] core so i toss the course if there's any
[3274.40 - 3279.52] questions there
[3275.44 - 3281.04] right you can do a half an apple you can
[3279.52 - 3282.24] eat a half an apple you can eat a
[3281.04 - 3285.60] quarter of an apple
[3282.24 - 3287.28] you can do that if you can't do the
[3285.60 - 3288.64] apple if you're somebody that's allergic
[3287.28 - 3290.00] to an apple if you're somebody that
[3288.64 - 3291.52] doesn't like an apple if you're somebody
[3290.00 - 3292.64] that just can't do an apple or you can't
[3291.52 - 3296.16] find an apple
[3292.64 - 3298.16] realize that your atlantic dolls
[3296.16 - 3299.44] is part of getting the metals out of
[3298.16 - 3301.36] that that bile
[3299.44 - 3303.36] out of the intestinal tract too you
[3301.36 - 3305.68] don't have the atlantic balls
[3303.36 - 3307.28] right then you're still you're still
[3305.68 - 3308.08] doing the frozen wild blueberry which
[3307.28 - 3309.76] helps to get it
[3308.08 - 3311.52] out of the intestinal tract you're still
[3309.76 - 3312.40] doing the spirulina which also helps to
[3311.52 - 3316.24] get it out
[3312.40 - 3318.32] right so let's bring this over
[3316.24 - 3319.68] i know on tick-tock you guys don't see a
[3318.32 - 3322.00] lot when it's when it's

[3323.36 - 3326.00] to do is make a quick applesauce is what
[3325.28 - 3328.16] i'm doing
[3326.00 - 3330.32] so i'm chopping up two apples i'm gonna
[3328.16 - 3332.84] have an apple sauce before lunch
[3330.32 - 3334.24] that's what i'm gonna do you guys i'm
[3332.84 - 3336.16] excited
[3334.24 - 3339.04] right so that's what i'm doing let's see
[3336.16 - 3340.80] if it all works out remember we're live
[3339.04 - 3343.36] all kinds of disasters happen when we're
[3340.80 - 3346.84] live yep what's going on
[3343.36 - 3349.60] there we go averted disaster
[3346.84 - 3353.12] here okay
[3349.60 - 3353.12] do a little pulse action here
[3354.08 - 3357.84] anybody who just got on here i advise
[3356.32 - 3358.64] you to watch this from the beginning to
[3357.84 - 3362.00] the end
[3358.64 - 3364.16] watch it on youtube or or a facebook
[3362.00 - 3365.52] allows us to see it because because i'm
[3364.16 - 3370.56] censored there a lot
[3365.52 - 3370.56] watch it on facebook can do that too
[3372.88 - 3379.52] so i'm making an apple sauce this is a
[3375.04 - 3381.36] fresh living applesauce right here
[3379.52 - 3382.56] that's what i'm doing i'm going to eat
[3381.36 - 3386.88] this before
[3382.56 - 3389.60] 12 o'clock every day during the cleanse
[3386.88 - 3390.16] right you're not going to see any nuts

[3390.16 - 3394.40] no almond milk in here nothing like that
[3393.04 - 3396.40] because if you do that
[3394.40 - 3398.24] you're blowing the cleanse you've got to
[3396.40 - 3402.00] be fat free before noon
[3398.24 - 3403.52] to get the metals out if anybody's on
[3402.00 - 3404.96] here right now stay tuned because i'm

[3404.96 - 3408.40] um a little display on where you get
[3406.80 - 3409.52] your toxic heavy metals which i think is
[3408.40 - 3411.04] important because no

[3558.00 - 3563.04] in pharmaceuticals antibiotics
[3561.24 - 3566.00] antidepressants
[3563.04 - 3568.08] cold medicine loaded with aluminum

[3577.60 - 3580.96] it's all mercury
[3578.80 - 3582.24] mercury mercury mercury right how many
[3580.96 - 3583.44] times can you say it three times in a
[3582.24 - 3586.08] row really quick
[3583.44 - 3586.88] mercury america bright mercury there you

[3586.88 - 3591.20] so sushi boom how many people are eating
[3589.76 - 3595.92] sushi
[3591.20 - 3597.68] copper you guys there was a question
[3595.92 - 3600.00] by the way there was a question
[3597.68 - 3602.56] yesterday that said well 14 karat gold
[3600.00 - 3605.12] 18 karat gold why not 24 karat gold
[3602.56 - 3608.00] because 24 karat gold breaks
[3605.12 - 3609.20] it breaks it's not strong enough it's
[3608.00 - 3612.56] too soft that's why
[3609.20 - 3613.68] 24 karat gold jewelry i mean you just
[3612.56 - 3615.12] you lose it
[3613.68 - 3617.44] you're on the beach and boom there goes
[3615.12 - 3618.72] your earrings gone you hit one wave and
[3617.44 - 3621.36] boom there goes your necklace
[3618.72 - 3623.44] gone you know you're on your paddle
[3621.36 - 3625.92] board boom you just lost your gold chain
[3623.44 - 3628.24] if it's 24 karat it just falls apart
[3625.92 - 3628.96] so that's why so 18 karat is the way to
[3628.24 - 3631.92] go
[3628.96 - 3633.44] 14 karat if you can that's fine too but
[3631.92 - 3637.12] copper
[3633.44 - 3639.28] copper pipes copper's passed on in utero
[3637.12 - 3640.56] okay mommy and daddy pass copper on
[3639.28 - 3642.32] sperm and egg

[4296.72 - 4302.48] the things i need i don't have cilantro
[4298.80 - 4306.16] then i try to get three
[4302.48 - 4309.28] out of five three
[4306.16 - 4313.60] out of five is what i try to do
[4309.28 - 4316.64] that means three what's one spirulina
[4313.60 - 4318.40] that's one of the five that takes the
[4316.64 - 4321.52] metals out together
[4318.40 - 4322.88] right one teaspoon boom barley grass
[4321.52 - 4325.28] juice powder
[4322.88 - 4326.80] one of the three out of the five so
[4325.28 - 4328.16] that's the vimergy barley grass juice
[4326.80 - 4332.40] powder right
[4328.16 - 4335.52] teaspoon of that in there okay
[4332.40 - 4336.24] okay i do the weinman's wild blueberry
[4335.52 - 4340.84] juice
[4336.24 - 4343.68] i do two ounces in there boom
[4340.84 - 4346.72] incredible
[4343.68 - 4348.40] three out of the five or the powder it's
[4346.72 - 4351.36] the vimergy powder right there
[4348.40 - 4352.24] or the powder right why blueberry powder
[4351.36 - 4355.52] three
[4352.24 - 4357.92] out of the five this is important okay
[4355.52 - 4357.92] mix it
[4359.12 - 4362.80] if i can't do the full smoothie
[4363.68 - 4367.84] i got the coconut water version right
[4365.36 - 4370.32] there and the three out of the five
[4367.84 - 4372.24] right sure it would be ideal to have the
[4370.32 - 4374.48] cilantro but try to get the cilantro in
[4372.24 - 4376.56] your diet later on during the day
[4374.48 - 4377.92] or maybe later on if you're not doing
[4376.56 - 4379.36] all the fats yet
[4377.92 - 4380.96] you're not doing those fats and try to
[4379.36 - 4382.24] get a little dose in there maybe later
[4380.96 - 4382.96] on during the day if you're not doing
[4382.24 - 4384.40] all the fats
[4382.96 - 4386.40] then you get the five out of the five
[4384.40 - 4388.48] during that day
[4386.40 - 4389.52] right if you're keeping the fats away
[4388.48 - 4392.56] you can do three
[4389.52 - 4393.28] out of the five add the cilantro later
[4392.56 - 4398.96] tik tok
[4393.28 - 4402.80] add the dose later how bitching is that
[4398.96 - 4404.32] it's really cool really cool
[4402.80 - 4406.40] a friend of mine used that term all the
[4404.32 - 4407.68] time so i talked to them for an hour on
