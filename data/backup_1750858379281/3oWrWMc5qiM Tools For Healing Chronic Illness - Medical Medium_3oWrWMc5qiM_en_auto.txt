[83.12 - 85.76] on
[84.32 - 88.32] it's good to see everybody coming on
[85.76 - 89.76] here so this is exciting this mm 1500
[88.32 - 92.80] you guys
[89.76 - 95.28] food costs going up going up i said it a
[92.80 - 97.92] year ago i said it a year ago the reason
[95.28 - 101.04] why i like the mm-900 and the mm 1500
[97.92 - 102.72] right here is because it saves me money
[101.04 - 104.72] and i know it's saving other people
[102.72 - 106.64] money too so when they're juicing it's
[104.72 - 108.80] saving saving the money so what happens
[106.64 - 111.28] is when you go to a juice bar
[108.80 - 113.60] you're paying more now for the juice
[111.28 - 116.24] than ever before in a juice bar right
[113.60 - 119.12] when you make it at home to help heal
[116.24 - 122.24] yourself you're paying away less when
[119.12 - 124.64] you use a juicer that squeezes more out
[122.24 - 125.76] of the celery and out of the greens
[124.64 - 127.36] right
[125.76 - 130.16] when you use a juicer that's squeezing
[127.36 - 132.88] more and more out of it you're saving
[130.16 - 135.44] more money that's the whole point before
[132.88 - 137.84] the food crisis like where the food food
[135.44 - 139.44] prices are going up right before that i
[137.84 - 141.04] was already saving myself a few thousand
[139.44 - 144.08] dollars a year more
[141.04 - 145.04] with actually doing like the mm-900
[144.08 - 146.64] right
[145.04 - 148.56] you guys by the way we're live on
[146.64 - 150.32] medicalmedium.com we're live streaming
[148.56 - 151.84] on the website we're live on tick tock
[150.32 - 154.32] you guys we're live on facebook youtube
[151.84 - 156.56] we're live on twitch we're live on
[154.32 - 159.20] rumble we're live on we're live on
[156.56 - 161.04] telegram we're live which is incredible
[159.20 - 162.96] good to see you guys so we're live on
[161.04 - 165.28] getter too as well
[162.96 - 167.36] so what i love about
[165.28 - 169.12] saving money with the juicing is because
[167.36 - 170.24] i'm seeing friends going to juice bars
[169.12 - 172.48] right they go into a juice bar and
[170.24 - 175.20] they're like why was my juice 20
[172.48 - 178.56] why was my celery in green juice 20
[175.20 - 181.28] why was my green juice in la 25
[178.56 - 182.72] now right the price and that's all over
[181.28 - 184.72] the country and around the world the
[182.72 - 187.44] prices are going up right so what i love
[184.72 - 190.00] about juicing at home
[187.44 - 192.00] myself is the juicer pays for itself and
[190.00 - 194.08] it's saving me money and that's what's
[192.00 - 196.40] happening so every time i'm juicing
[194.08 - 199.28] every single morning i'm saving myself
[196.40 - 201.12] money it's paying for itself which is
[199.28 - 203.60] incredible so the juicer pays for itself
[201.12 - 205.44] over and over and over again i get big
[203.60 - 208.00] glasses of celery juice that i'm not
[205.44 - 209.92] paying 25 for
[208.00 - 211.68] because it's squeezed this juicer
[209.92 - 213.44] squeezes so much out of it so that's
[211.68 - 214.96] just cool all on its own man so
[213.44 - 216.72] important so let's start making some ice
[214.96 - 217.76] cream right now
[216.72 - 219.60] so you guys

[870.24 - 876.00] the benefits as far as what it's doing
[873.68 - 877.76] for people it's incredible so look i got
[876.00 - 880.00] some kale here i'm gonna run a little
[877.76 - 881.76] bit of kale through here as well but
[880.00 - 883.20] we'll just do a little straight celery
[881.76 - 885.76] juice to start with so if you're doing
[883.20 - 887.60] straight celery juice
[885.76 - 891.04] here we go
[887.60 - 893.12] i washed this celery really good this is
[891.04 - 895.68] conventional celery
[893.12 - 897.76] just so you know
[895.68 - 899.12] if you got organic celery
[897.76 - 899.92] incredible
[899.12 - 902.48] right
[899.92 - 904.48] couldn't get any organic right now
[902.48 - 906.64] so i was like you know what
[904.48 - 907.68] still incredible to juice
[906.64 - 910.40] this
[907.68 - 913.76] conventional celery absolutely wash it
[910.40 - 916.80] really good
[913.76 - 919.36] so what i'm doing right now
[916.80 - 921.92] is i'm doing straight
[919.36 - 921.92] celery
[922.80 - 928.24] what you'll notice is the pulp is not so
[926.48 - 931.44] sloppy wet
[928.24 - 934.16] because it's extracting so much out of
[931.44 - 934.16] the celery
[939.20 - 942.88] yeah
[941.60 - 946.32] now
[942.88 - 948.80] the whole thing about celery in itself
[946.32 - 950.16] is it's turning lives around
[948.80 - 952.16] here's the here's the point that's
[950.16 - 954.64] actually kind of funny there's a lot of
[952.16 - 956.96] people juicing celery it's keeping them
[954.64 - 958.24] afloat while they're doing all this bad
[956.96 - 960.56] stuff
[958.24 - 962.16] so they're doing all this bad stuff
[960.56 - 963.76] they're doing supplements that are bad
[962.16 - 965.44] like supplements that are actually not
[963.76 - 967.36] good for them they're doing other things
[965.44 - 968.80] that are bad they're eating things that
[967.36 - 970.24] aren't good for them they're drinking
[968.80 - 972.32] things that aren't good for them and
[970.24 - 974.64] then they're juicing celery and the
[972.32 - 976.48] celery is keeping them afloat while
[974.64 - 979.04] they're doing all this other bad stuff
[976.48 - 981.12] the celery juice is keeping them alive
[979.04 - 984.40] it's keeping their skin clear it's
[981.12 - 987.04] keeping their mind working better
[984.40 - 988.88] the electrolytes and celery is like no
[987.04 - 991.68] other when you're doing celery juice
[988.88 - 992.64] it's critical to do it by itself in the
[991.68 - 994.80] morning
[992.64 - 996.80] and then you can do celery and like a
[994.80 - 1000.48] green a leafy green i'll show you how to
[996.80 - 1003.12] do that at the end of the day
[1000.48 - 1006.32] you guys just came on here sale mm-1500
[1003.12 - 1006.32] i'm going to make a few things
[1007.60 - 1011.20] so
[1009.28 - 1013.52] right now i'm making some killer celery
[1011.20 - 1013.52] juice
[1018.56 - 1022.80] germ theory you're worried about mineral
[1020.00 - 1025.92] deficiencies that's a great way to clear
[1022.80 - 1027.92] up mineral deficiencies is by using
[1025.92 - 1029.52] celery juice because of the trace
[1027.92 - 1031.68] mineral salts are so
[1029.52 - 1034.00] so over the top that's one of the things
[1031.68 - 1036.40] that really helps santara's healing good
[1034.00 - 1036.40] to see you
[1036.48 - 1039.92] you see celery juice all the time
[1038.00 - 1041.20] keeping them afloat right you guys
[1039.92 - 1045.28] hundreds of millions of people are
[1041.20 - 1045.28] drinking celery juice around the world
[1045.52 - 1049.36] they're feeling better they're getting
[1046.88 - 1051.60] their lives back their inflammation is
[1049.36 - 1053.92] dropping because they're knocking down
[1051.60 - 1055.92] their viral load they're helping to
[1053.92 - 1057.84] detox their liver they're helping to
[1055.92 - 1059.84] detox their body
[1057.84 - 1062.16] that's the difference that's what celery
[1059.84 - 1066.12] juice does you can't get that from other
[1062.16 - 1066.12] things it doesn't work
[1066.16 - 1069.52] one of the most powerful tools it's one
[1068.56 - 1071.60] of the most
[1069.52 - 1074.48] powerful tools for chronic illness it's
[1071.60 - 1076.80] a medical medium tool
[1074.48 - 1078.84] people are closet drinking it everywhere
[1076.80 - 1081.92] and i'll tell you what
[1078.84 - 1083.68] everybody everybody right all the
[1081.92 - 1085.20] influencers they're all trying to sell
[1083.68 - 1086.80] their potion they're all trying to sell
[1085.20 - 1088.56] their stuff out there right so they
[1086.80 - 1090.56] don't want to talk about their celery
[1088.56 - 1092.40] juice anymore because they can't make
[1090.56 - 1094.96] any money off of celery juice and they
[1092.40 - 1096.88] don't want to make celery farms rich
[1094.96 - 1099.20] so but they're drinking it everybody's
[1096.88 - 1101.92] drinking it it's the largest crop in
[1099.20 - 1104.08] produce there is right now in the world
[1101.92 - 1106.32] the health food stores get deliveries
[1104.08 - 1108.72] where it's just a truck of celery that's
[1106.32 - 1111.12] never happened in our history it's just
[1108.72 - 1112.24] really amazing how it works okay so we
[1111.12 - 1113.92] got
[1112.24 - 1115.92] we got some celery juice right there
[1113.92 - 1116.72] we're also going to do some kale juice
[1115.92 - 1118.24] too
[1116.72 - 1120.72] so i'm going to run a little kale in
[1118.24 - 1120.72] there now
[1120.84 - 1125.28] so
[1122.64 - 1127.68] we can actually do some kale now what i
[1125.28 - 1129.60] recommend is you do celery juice by
[1127.68 - 1132.00] itself in the morning on an empty
[1129.60 - 1135.20] stomach you guys know 16 ounces 8 ounces
[1132.00 - 1137.52] 16 ounces try a minimum 16 ounces 32
[1135.20 - 1139.92] ounces if you can every single morning
[1137.52 - 1141.68] on an empty stomach to start cleaning up
[1139.92 - 1143.28] the liver to start cleaning up the
[1141.68 - 1144.64] organs to help kill off all the
[1143.28 - 1146.80] pathogens that aren't supposed to be in
[1144.64 - 1147.60] your intestinal tract the bad pathogens
[1146.80 - 1150.48] right
[1147.60 - 1151.84] you want to get rid of all that
[1150.48 - 1153.36] so
[1151.84 - 1155.60] i'm just running a little kale through
[1153.36 - 1155.60] here
[1155.84 - 1161.20] jenny tinkle boss says best juicer i've
[1158.88 - 1163.28] ever used loved it aw
[1161.20 - 1164.88] honored you're here
[1163.28 - 1167.68] now what i'm doing is i'm running a
[1164.88 - 1170.32] little bit of dinosaur kale through here
[1167.68 - 1173.44] this would be an afternoon or at the end
[1170.32 - 1176.08] of the day or evening drink right here
[1173.44 - 1178.16] because you want the celery by itself in
[1176.08 - 1181.28] the morning
[1178.16 - 1182.96] but now i'm doing a kale
[1181.28 - 1185.36] santara's healing said oh my god the
[1182.96 - 1187.44] recent hits on celery juice while
[1185.36 - 1189.60] selling their coffee products yeah i
[1187.44 - 1191.68] know
[1189.60 - 1194.24] know all about it and thank you for
[1191.68 - 1195.44] mentioning it too it's a good reminder
[1194.24 - 1196.88] that that's what they're doing they're
[1195.44 - 1200.16] selling their
[1196.88 - 1200.16] they're selling their coffee
[1200.64 - 1205.12] the drug dealers are really out there
[1202.72 - 1206.96] heavy right now you guys because so many
[1205.12 - 1209.28] people are depressed so many people are
[1206.96 - 1210.88] suffering emotionally so the drug
[1209.28 - 1212.00] dealers are taking advantage of all
[1210.88 - 1213.52] those people
[1212.00 - 1215.84] so they're selling all their caffeine
[1213.52 - 1217.76] products so the drug dealers are really
[1215.84 - 1219.68] out there right now
[1217.76 - 1221.52] selling like their caffeine products
[1219.68 - 1222.56] left and right to try to keep people
[1221.52 - 1224.88] high
[1222.56 - 1226.40] it's like it's it's really sad actually
[1224.88 - 1229.36] when you think about it so i'm running
[1226.40 - 1229.36] some kale through here
[1231.12 - 1236.16] so this is a kale celery juice but i
[1233.44 - 1237.36] started it out with straight celery
[1236.16 - 1238.96] and
[1237.36 - 1241.76] that's what you want you want straight
[1238.96 - 1243.68] celery is what you want right pulp nice
[1241.76 - 1247.12] and dry i mean you guys got to see this
[1243.68 - 1247.12] i'll show you up close right here
[1247.20 - 1250.80] see this bulb
[1248.56 - 1251.76] see how like dry it is it falls apart
[1250.80 - 1254.40] right
[1251.76 - 1256.56] it's got that like real dry kind of look
[1254.40 - 1259.12] to it that's where you're saving money
[1256.56 - 1261.28] right there so when you buy a juice they
[1259.12 - 1262.80] just keep on going up in price in the
[1261.28 - 1265.20] stores because that's going to happen in
[1262.80 - 1267.28] about six months when you go to the
[1265.20 - 1269.92] health food store in about six months
[1267.28 - 1272.00] from now when you go to right any kind
[1269.92 - 1274.08] of juice bar or health food store you're
[1272.00 - 1276.24] gonna see if you ever want a green juice
[1274.08 - 1278.80] of any kind even the crappy junky green
[1276.24 - 1280.16] juices that are all pasteurized right
[1278.80 - 1281.60] when you go
[1280.16 - 1283.60] and get your green juice you're gonna
[1281.60 - 1285.68] see the price of the green juice go like
[1283.60 - 1287.68] three dollars more
[1285.68 - 1288.96] and then four dollars more they already
[1287.68 - 1291.36] are right
[1288.96 - 1293.92] when you have your own juicer and you're
[1291.36 - 1295.52] squeezing everything out of it you're
[1293.92 - 1298.48] actually saving money and you're doing
[1295.52 - 1300.96] the reverse of that right so it's really
[1298.48 - 1301.92] that's that's what i love about it
[1300.96 - 1305.52] so let's
[1301.92 - 1308.56] get this uh set up right here
[1305.52 - 1310.64] rosvita says on facebook celery juice

[1324.56 - 1330.32] antibiotics and topical steroids to take
[1326.88 - 1333.28] away perioral dermatitis from mask and i

[1335.36 - 1338.80] weeks completely

[1350.48 - 1354.88] free from suffering that's the whole
[1352.40 - 1357.92] point this is the chronic illness
[1354.88 - 1360.32] fighting you know strategy right here
[1357.92 - 1363.20] that's what it is decelerates juice the
[1360.32 - 1364.80] really incredible food all of it amy
[1363.20 - 1366.32] says i just made some banana ice cream

[1366.32 - 1370.32] inspiring me yum yum mine's over there
[1368.56 - 1372.84] kind of defrosting a little bit right i

[1372.84 - 1375.84] and
[1374.40 - 1377.36] get a close-up on this if you can you
[1375.84 - 1380.16] might not be able to get you might not
[1377.36 - 1381.44] be able to see it so easy there you go
[1380.16 - 1385.76] voila
[1381.44 - 1388.76] that's a kale celery juice right there
[1385.76 - 1388.76] right
[1390.88 - 1396.00] yeah it's medical medium clumsy
[1393.60 - 1399.68] i think medical medium is clumsy
[1396.00 - 1401.04] he's done this too many times
[1399.68 - 1402.88] all right
[1401.04 - 1405.52] that's the celery juice right there you
[1402.88 - 1406.56] guys now like i said before i put kale
[1405.52 - 1408.40] in there
[1406.56 - 1410.08] and that's great because that's a kale
[1408.40 - 1411.76] celery juice something you do in the
[1410.08 - 1413.36] afternoon or at night or something like
[1411.76 - 1415.36] that if you want which is incredible
[1413.36 - 1417.92] right it's an entirely different weapon
[1415.36 - 1419.52] for chronic illness but celery juice on
[1417.92 - 1422.16] its own
[1419.52 - 1424.32] is unmatched in the morning especially

[1496.32 - 1500.16] different things with their celery juice
[1498.64 - 1503.04] right
[1500.16 - 1505.36] that's made up there's no study that
[1503.04 - 1508.40] shows celery juice damages a kidney
[1505.36 - 1510.88] there's no there's no study there's no
[1508.40 - 1513.20] review study there's no
[1510.88 - 1515.36] paper that can prove it there's nothing
[1513.20 - 1519.04] out there i'll tell you what kills your
[1515.36 - 1520.64] kidneys and kills them fast high protein
[1519.04 - 1522.32] high fat
[1520.64 - 1525.04] you want to kill your kidneys high
[1522.32 - 1528.40] protein high fat i'm talking vegan or
[1525.04 - 1530.72] animal you can you can high protein your
[1528.40 - 1532.48] kidneys to death as a vegan and a
[1530.72 - 1534.72] plant-based person
[1532.48 - 1535.76] you can high protein your kidneys to
[1534.72 - 1538.40] death
[1535.76 - 1540.16] as an animal protein person keto animal
[1538.40 - 1542.32] protein whatever animal protein doesn't
[1540.16 - 1543.52] matter what what brand what style
[1542.32 - 1546.00] whatever
[1543.52 - 1548.56] you can kill your kidneys with high
[1546.00 - 1550.88] protein your kidneys get a viral
[1548.56 - 1552.72] infection that starts the process off
[1550.88 - 1554.24] and if anybody has a viral infection in
[1552.72 - 1556.72] their kidneys nobody knows about for
[1554.24 - 1558.32] years and years and years we end up
[1556.72 - 1560.40] killing the kidney because the kidney
[1558.32 - 1562.16] can't keep up with the viral infection
[1560.40 - 1564.08] so we end up killing the kidneys with
[1562.16 - 1566.00] high protein high fat that's how we
[1564.08 - 1568.40] damage kidneys that's how we get kidney
[1566.00 - 1570.56] stones we get the kidney stones from
[1568.40 - 1572.16] high protein high fat destroying our
[1570.56 - 1575.60] kidneys and then the other thing is
[1572.16 - 1577.84] caffeining our kidneys to death high
[1575.60 - 1580.80] caffeine caffeine consumption every
[1577.84 - 1582.32] single day coffee that's how we kill our
[1580.80 - 1585.20] kidneys and you know what i can
[1582.32 - 1586.48] guarantee you anybody that said hey
[1585.20 - 1589.60] you're gonna hurt your kidneys with
[1586.48 - 1591.04] celery juice is selling caffeine
[1589.60 - 1592.08] i can guarantee you they're selling
[1591.04 - 1595.28] caffeine
[1592.08 - 1596.88] okay and they're the drug dealers right
[1595.28 - 1598.72] so listen
[1596.88 - 1600.40] here's the thing don't add anything to
[1598.72 - 1602.16] your celery juice make sure you do it on
[1600.40 - 1603.68] an empty stomach in the morning if you
[1602.16 - 1606.16] can that's best
[1603.68 - 1607.60] don't purchase a celery juice off the
[1606.16 - 1609.76] shelf be like
[1607.60 - 1611.76] yeah can i can i get that off the shelf
[1609.76 - 1613.68] there okay i got my celery juice off the
[1611.76 - 1615.76] shelf at the health food store
[1613.68 - 1617.92] it's hpp
[1615.76 - 1620.16] if it's on the shelf in the health food
[1617.92 - 1622.48] store unless they juiced it that day and
[1620.16 - 1624.72] then put it up in their own bottle
[1622.48 - 1627.92] but it's if it's not and it's a brand if
[1624.72 - 1630.48] you find a celery juice brand
[1627.92 - 1632.00] on the store shelf somewhere out on the
[1630.48 - 1635.20] shelf

[1637.52 - 1640.40] think it's raw you think it's fresh
[1639.36 - 1641.60] uh-uh
[1640.40 - 1644.00] it's not
[1641.60 - 1645.44] it's not raw it's not fresh if it's on
[1644.00 - 1647.76] the shelf
[1645.44 - 1650.56] and it's got a due date on there and
[1647.76 - 1653.04] it's a brand it's high pressure
[1650.56 - 1654.72] pasteurization okay

[1654.72 - 1657.92] i'll tell you the difference with
[1656.00 - 1659.60] medical medium
[1657.92 - 1660.48] and the others out there
[1659.60 - 1662.80] right
[1660.48 - 1664.64] here's the difference okay
[1662.80 - 1666.88] i wasn't in it
[1664.64 - 1668.80] to just make peace
[1666.88 - 1671.52] i wasn't in it
[1668.80 - 1673.60] to just get along with the cool kids
[1671.52 - 1676.72] the cool kids in the industry
[1673.60 - 1679.36] right that's why i wasn't in it for that
[1676.72 - 1682.24] i was i was in it instead to get you the
[1679.36 - 1684.32] truth it didn't matter how many people

[1693.44 - 1696.88] broke into the business
[1695.20 - 1698.88] and they're selling their caffeine drug

[2076.88 - 2081.28] now i'm making a fat free hummus but i
[2079.20 - 2084.08] have these sesame seeds here now here's
[2081.28 - 2087.28] the difference when you put sesame seeds
[2084.08 - 2090.48] in your hummus through the machine
[2087.28 - 2094.96] you're not getting a whole bunch like a
[2090.48 - 2097.12] tablespoon of tahini oil sesame oil
[2094.96 - 2099.36] this is it gives you the flavor of the
[2097.12 - 2102.32] sesame if that's what you like it gives
[2099.36 - 2104.08] you it doesn't it's not a blob of tahini
[2102.32 - 2106.56] with all that added oil they put in the
[2104.08 - 2108.00] tahini this is the best way to do it
[2106.56 - 2109.20] that's why i call this like the medicine
[2108.00 - 2111.20] maker because you're making the
[2109.20 - 2113.52] healthiest version of the food you can
[2111.20 - 2116.24] ever have or imagine
[2113.52 - 2118.08] see i won't go out and buy a hummus out
[2116.24 - 2120.08] there because they're all unhealthy for
[2118.08 - 2123.44] a million reasons they got citric acid
[2120.08 - 2125.92] in them they got additives you can't see
[2123.44 - 2128.00] right they got carrageenan and they have
[2125.92 - 2131.52] msg they have natural flavors in the
[2128.00 - 2132.96] hummuses now so when you go buy hummus
[2131.52 - 2134.72] there's all the stuff in there that you
[2132.96 - 2138.16] shouldn't be eating and then they dump
[2134.72 - 2141.52] all this canola oil in their hummus
[2138.16 - 2143.28] and other stuff too like canola oil they
[2141.52 - 2144.48] put too much olive oil in their hummus
[2143.28 - 2146.08] they have too much tahini in their
[2144.48 - 2148.96] hummus they have nutritional yeast in
[2146.08 - 2152.32] their hummus nutritional yeast is msg
[2148.96 - 2154.56] right they put citric acid which is corn
[2152.32 - 2156.32] so that's what they i won't buy a hummus
[2154.56 - 2157.44] if i walk by the hummus section in the
[2156.32 - 2160.48] store
[2157.44 - 2162.48] all i'm seeing is bad that that that's
[2160.48 - 2164.56] not good i would never give that to my
[2162.48 - 2166.48] kids that's a bad hummus right there
[2164.56 - 2168.24] that's a vet look what's in this one and
[2166.48 - 2169.20] you see it over and over and over again
[2168.24 - 2170.88] right
[2169.20 - 2173.76] and that's what i love about this it's
[2170.88 - 2174.88] like you break away from that it's like
[2173.76 - 2177.52] freedom
[2174.88 - 2179.92] which is incredible so
[2177.52 - 2182.72] let's put some beans in here
[2179.92 - 2182.72] some chickpeas
[2184.32 - 2187.60] okay
[2185.28 - 2189.84] now you can put a little bit of um
[2187.60 - 2192.32] sesame seeds right in here too check
[2189.84 - 2192.32] this out

[2596.96 - 2600.56] dip your cucumber into it right
[2601.44 - 2606.04] so good as well there we go
[2607.52 - 2610.80] that's a really amazing one
[2609.44 - 2612.96] i'm going to make a black bean one real
[2610.80 - 2612.96] quick
[2613.92 - 2620.40] so you guys you can do a cracker i'll do
[2616.88 - 2622.80] that with the black bean one okay

[2625.36 - 2629.04] really really good stuff right
[2631.52 - 2635.84] so let's go with the black bean
[2638.08 - 2641.04] and if you want to use a different bean
[2639.84 - 2642.88] and that's what you want to do for your
[2641.04 - 2644.16] hummus like sprouted lentil is something
[2642.88 - 2646.24] that i'm going to make one time with
[2644.16 - 2648.48] this
[2646.24 - 2650.64] austin says never thought to put the
[2648.48 - 2651.68] herbs in it it looks so good it's so
[2650.64 - 2654.88] good
[2651.68 - 2657.92] so fresh so amazing low fat which is
[2654.88 - 2659.84] incredible right there right
[2657.92 - 2662.64] so what i'm doing is i'm drop dropping
[2659.84 - 2664.16] in some black beans
[2662.64 - 2666.08] there you guys
[2664.16 - 2668.56] a little bit of leftover chickpea hummus
[2666.08 - 2671.60] is coming out
[2668.56 - 2671.60] but who's complaining
[2671.68 - 2675.68] there we go
[2673.76 - 2677.28] okay
[2675.68 - 2680.32] you can you don't even have to do the
[2677.28 - 2683.12] sesame seeds you don't have to
[2680.32 - 2686.72] i'm just doing it
[2683.12 - 2686.72] right little flavor going in there
[2688.56 - 2693.84] so this is the black bean one right here
[2692.08 - 2697.60] and do your fresh herbs in the black
[2693.84 - 2697.60] bean one too at the same time
[2697.76 - 2703.36] i don't like using blenders for hummus
[2700.16 - 2704.40] ever since the mm 1500 i won't use a
[2703.36 - 2705.60] blender
[2704.40 - 2707.68] for hummus
[2705.60 - 2709.84] i won't sit there you know with that
[2707.68 - 2712.00] it's just it's not it's not the same
[2709.84 - 2714.00] experience there's so many reasons i
[2712.00 - 2716.48] don't like using the food processor with
[2714.00 - 2716.48] it either
[2716.56 - 2719.92] it's really not a fun experience
[2718.48 - 2723.60] i love doing it this way i'm going to
[2719.92 - 2723.60] put some garlic chives in here
[2724.08 - 2729.92] the flavor in here is insane
[2727.36 - 2732.00] it's much smoother with this that's why
[2729.92 - 2735.52] you can't get it any smoother than this
[2732.00 - 2735.52] some rosemary going in there
[2740.16 - 2743.20] it's so smooth
[2744.96 - 2747.92] right and there you don't have to use
[2746.48 - 2749.04] the oil
[2747.92 - 2751.04] and that's the thing when you do the
[2749.04 - 2753.44] blenders you gotta put that's what they
[2751.04 - 2755.28] do they put all that oil in there that
[2753.44 - 2757.28] nutritional yeast
[2755.28 - 2759.52] you don't have to do any fat in here
[2757.28 - 2761.52] whatsoever fat free so you're protecting
[2759.52 - 2763.12] your liver
[2761.52 - 2765.44] which is so good
[2763.12 - 2767.76] your liver doesn't like fats so you got
[2765.44 - 2769.84] to be careful yeah you know sure you can
[2767.76 - 2772.00] do some healthy avocado some healthy
[2769.84 - 2773.68] hemp seeds some
[2772.00 - 2775.68] sesame seeds some pumpkin seeds
[2773.68 - 2777.28] sunflower seeds right
[2775.68 - 2780.00] it's fine because you can make nut milks
[2777.28 - 2783.52] in here you can do nut butters in here
[2780.00 - 2783.52] with this machine which is incredible
[2784.00 - 2788.96] that hot pepper got me before you guys
[2785.68 - 2790.56] i'm gonna throw another one in here
[2788.96 - 2792.16] this is a super chilly dropping that
[2790.56 - 2794.48] super chilly in here
[2792.16 - 2797.76] but the point is you can do low fat too
[2794.48 - 2797.76] really give your liver a break
[2797.84 - 2801.36] when you need to give it a you know a
[2799.36 - 2803.28] break once in a while
[2801.36 - 2805.68] there's still there's still fat and
[2803.28 - 2805.68] beans
[2808.32 - 2811.44] i always do it to myself with those hot
[2810.00 - 2813.76] peppers
[2811.44 - 2815.68] i'm gonna put a few more sesame seeds in
[2813.76 - 2817.36] there big difference with just putting
[2815.68 - 2819.28] the sesame seeds in there like that
[2817.36 - 2822.08] versus sesame oil
[2819.28 - 2825.20] right and all that tahini
[2822.08 - 2825.20] really big difference
[2825.28 - 2829.12] so this black bean hummus
[2827.84 - 2831.44] is like a
[2829.12 - 2832.96] friend and family's favorite over here
[2831.44 - 2834.96] at the aw
[2832.96 - 2838.00] household i'm gonna put a little bit
[2834.96 - 2838.00] more oregano
[2838.24 - 2840.96] in here
[2839.52 - 2843.52] there we go
[2840.96 - 2845.84] all right looking good
[2843.52 - 2848.00] i'll drop a few more in here
[2845.84 - 2850.24] and you see aw what causes extreme
[2848.00 - 2851.60] drowsiness right after eating food i
[2850.24 - 2853.92] noticed that drinking coconut water
[2851.60 - 2856.50] helps to relieve the drowsiness and dc
[2853.92 - 2858.48] that's neurological
[2856.50 - 2861.92] [Music]
[2858.48 - 2863.52] that central nervous system
[2861.92 - 2866.08] right i was telling a doctor the other
[2863.52 - 2867.68] day when people get really tired when
[2866.08 - 2869.52] they're eating food
[2867.68 - 2872.08] their nervous system
[2869.52 - 2874.72] is not getting the full energy it needs
[2872.08 - 2876.88] because it's going to all your digestion
[2874.72 - 2878.80] so your all your reserves go to your
[2876.88 - 2882.72] digestion versus your central nervous
[2878.80 - 2882.72] system so then you get tired right
[2882.80 - 2886.96] that's your central nervous system a lot
[2884.96 - 2889.68] of people it everybody's different if
[2886.96 - 2891.12] you have health issues sometimes it it
[2889.68 - 2893.12] only takes a little bit of food and you
[2891.12 - 2894.88] feel tired because you have you know
[2893.12 - 2896.24] neurological issues right but then
[2894.88 - 2898.08] there's somebody that doesn't have any
[2896.24 - 2899.76] neurological issues yet they can eat a
[2898.08 - 2901.60] whole turkey dinner and they only get
[2899.76 - 2904.08] tired when it's thanksgiving when they
[2901.60 - 2905.84] eat a gigantic turkey dinner and they're
[2904.08 - 2907.44] in insulin resistance and they're
[2905.84 - 2909.28] falling asleep on the couch and they're
[2907.44 - 2911.52] like what can i have another turkey
[2909.28 - 2914.72] drumstick what you know they're falling
[2911.52 - 2916.64] asleep on the couch right
[2914.72 - 2918.40] so this is a black bean hummus right
[2916.64 - 2920.00] here
[2918.40 - 2922.40] i'm gonna put a little bit of lemon in
[2920.00 - 2923.92] there as well
[2922.40 - 2926.48] cold white spring says it depends what
[2923.92 - 2928.80] you are eating too right true may you
[2926.48 - 2930.72] you are so right if you get tired
[2928.80 - 2933.92] absolutely
[2930.72 - 2933.92] that plays a role too
[2934.08 - 2938.24] and if you have nervous systems symptoms
[2936.48 - 2940.64] of any kind
[2938.24 - 2942.64] right and you eat food that's much
[2940.64 - 2944.96] harder on the system
[2942.64 - 2946.56] then you're really going to feel it
[2944.96 - 2948.32] if you have nervous system issues and
[2946.56 - 2950.00] you eat food that's really good and
[2948.32 - 2952.16] healthy still might feel it because you
[2950.00 - 2954.32] have nervous system talk about way less
[2952.16 - 2956.32] right
[2954.32 - 2958.16] because all your reserves they go to
[2956.32 - 2959.76] your digestion and then your nerves are
[2958.16 - 2961.84] like whoa we gotta wait a little while
[2959.76 - 2963.52] until things start leveling out all
[2961.84 - 2967.24] right so i just mixed this hummus up i'm
[2963.52 - 2967.24] gonna put it in a little bowl
[2970.56 - 2976.08] i could actually put it right here too
[2972.72 - 2976.08] just a little black bean hummus
[2979.20 - 2982.88] so i'm gonna put a little bit next to
[2980.56 - 2985.04] this hummus right here so you got like
[2982.88 - 2987.04] one side you got the black bean
[2985.04 - 2988.64] the other side you have the chickpea
[2987.04 - 2991.12] right
[2988.64 - 2991.12] there you go
[2991.36 - 2994.24] and then you got like these crackers
[2992.64 - 2995.92] right here
[2994.24 - 2997.76] try them all out with a little brown
[2995.92 - 2999.84] rice cracker and that fruit brown rice
[2997.76 - 2999.84] cracker
[3000.16 - 3003.60] but you don't have to use that
[3009.20 - 3013.68] oh wait bryce is here
