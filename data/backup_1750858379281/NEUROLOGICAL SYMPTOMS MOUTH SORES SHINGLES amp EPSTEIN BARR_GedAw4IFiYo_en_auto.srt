a lot of pain and suffering with it it

156
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,880
isn't just the mouth hurting it could be

157
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,400
the mouth being on fire and hurting but

158
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,800

159
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,560
temperature pain in your neck pain in

160
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,120

sore

164
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,000

290
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:57,279
this is that valuable this information

291
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,959
so you dry off the canker sore

292
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,519
and then

293
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,839
keep your mouth open

294
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,760
and then you put

295
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:08,399
it right on the canker sore and you let

296
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,399
it sit there right on the mouth ulcer

297
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:13,200
right wherever that is now if you can't

298
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,920
reach your mouth ulcer

299
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,399
or

300
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,120
your canker sore

301
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:21,600
if you can't reach reach it

302
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,399
then you squirt a dropper full in its

303
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,600
vicinity so if you got a wisdom tooth

304
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:30,079
that's coming out or you or a corn chip

305
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,040
when a jagged corn chip went right into

306
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,640
your gum or gum line

307
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,120
and now you got a sore but you're like

308
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,040
what is that it hurts right between my

309
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,519
two back molars

310
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,800
you want to go to the vicinity like that

311
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,720
and be like okay it's on the left side

312
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,040
of my mouth

313
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,640
boom you hit it

314
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,959
that's what you do

315
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,760
and you let it sit there

316
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:55,279
you let it sit there on that area in

317
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,760
that area you let it sit there that

318
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,839
propolis

319
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,600
same

320
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:04,640
thing right

321
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,160
if you got a sore throat

322
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,440
and do what your doctor tells you to do

323
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,240
but i'm just showing you what i tell my

324
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,360
family members and my friends

325
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,040
okay

326
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,279
and it's something i would do if i had a

327
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,800
sore throat or what i was saying like a

328
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,240
sore somewhere

329
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,000
and so

330
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,279
now if you have sore throat

331
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,600
and dealing with sore throats you could

332
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,680
have a canker sore on your throat

333
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,279
people don't know this

334
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,480
same thing with people with tonsil

335
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,720
stones

336
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:34,000
they get sores because of those tonsil

337
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,880
stones starting to pop out right

338
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,959
tonsil stones really being streptococcus

339
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,519
bacteria producing tremendous amounts of

340
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:43,760
junk and garbage and then it then it um

341
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,120
calcifies

342
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,360
right

343
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,279
so what's happening is you take this and

344
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,200
you put it in there and you have it sit

345
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,959
there in your throat tamara says will it

346
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,480

and then put the propolis directly on it

374
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,839
you can get rid of canker sores so quick

375
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,880
it's

376
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:57,040
insane overnight they start going away

377
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,880
when you use a real propolis like

378
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,000
something that's unbelievable like this

379
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,200
right

380
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,959
and you know

381
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,399
right on that spot right

382
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:07,839
check this out okay

383
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,839
then you let it sit there

384
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,839
and then you do it again

385
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,600
a minute later

386
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,120
you take your paper towel you hit the

387
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,680
canker sore or mouth sore or anything

388
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,680
like that and boom you dry it real quick

389
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,399
and then you hit it with another drop

390
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,480
and you let it sit on there

391
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,560
you do that before bed your canker sores

392
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,560
start to heal overnight they start to go

393
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,839
away overnight mouth sores canker sores

394
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,200

so yeah so that's one example now let's

401
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,839
talk about like

402
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,959
herpes simplex one cold sore fever

403
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:52,720
blisters now propose isn't just good for

404
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,959
the sore

405
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,720
it's good for the virus when the virus

406
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,560
you don't know it is creating all this

407
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,040
hell in your life

408
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:04,000
like neurological symptoms

409
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:06,639
like causing cranial nerve inflammation

410
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,079
causing vagus nerve inflammation causing

411
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,560
all these problems people don't realize

412
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:12,880
trigeminal nerve pain clenching of the

413
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,880
teeth all the time herpes simplex one

414
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,680
you don't need the cold sore virus to

415
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,360
have it it's in the nerves

416
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,399
randa says love everything you do makes

417
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,079
so much sense on facebook thank you

418
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,199
i'm honored you're here truly just so

419
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,800
you know

420
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,800
okay

421
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,120
so tamara says i have cold sore using

422
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,680
tea tree oil is that okay well ask your

423
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,839
doctor if that's okay but if i had

424
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,560
a cold sore i wouldn't be using tea tree

425
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,639
oil personally i'd be using propolis

426
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,320
that's what i would be using

427
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:45,839
but you if your doctor tells you tea

428
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,839
tree oil you listen to your doctor

429
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,079
anyway

430
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,399
the bottom line is i want to talk now

431
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:54,880
about the herpes source so people get a

432
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,639
lot of cold sores and so let's go into

433
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,360
the cold sore section here but first of

434
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,399
all we're going to go back and forth a

435
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,000
little bit because i want to talk about

436
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,680
some other supplements involved with

437
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,600
that

438
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,880
but i'm in herpes simplex section right

439
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,720
here so let's get a close-up see if we

440
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,160
can see this and and we were getting a

441
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,160
pretty good close-up before it was it

442
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,600
was amazing so there it is herpes

443
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,800
simplex do you guys see that right where

444
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,519
the post with postage note is

445
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,040
right

446
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,720
so there's a protocol in here this is

447
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,720
cleanse the heel you guys so this is a

448
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,360
book that millions of people have around

449
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,959
the world millions of copies have sold

450
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,639
it's almost in every single country on

451
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,399
the planet

452
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,079
people use it i hear it all the time use

453
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,759
it as the reference books

454
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:35,600
they use it as the reference guides they

455
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:38,079
use it as their bible a lot of people

456
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,320
say all of that right this is the

457
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:43,040
medical textbook cleanse the heel if you

458
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:46,000
guys don't have it okay amazon.com it's

459
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:48,959
51 off or free at the library so we're

460
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,639
in the herpes simplex part right here

461
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:53,440
so anita says which one is for the

462
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,480
tongue and mouth sore so the propolis

463
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,880
you use

464
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,639
on any source that are in the mouth

465
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,000
right

466
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,360
and

467
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,199
here's the thing on in other propolises

468
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,160
you will taste the difference right they

469
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:10,079
have alcohol in them and you'll know it

470
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,320
there's a difference with this one you

471
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,839
don't have the hidden alcohol or the

472
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,759
hidden solvents

473
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,920
it's the first of its kind you cannot

474
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,839
make a propolis without alcohol and

475
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,120
hidden solvents by the way it's not it

476
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,839
can't be done

477
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,639
first time ever it was done and that's

478
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,480
how incredible this is but the thing is

479
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:31,120
is what vimergy did

480
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:35,279
they did it and they left over 50

481
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,720
percent of the active quercetin

482
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,519
and other

483
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,279
incredible polyphenols right

484
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,279
now people say why not take a quercetin

485
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:46,160
supplement because it's dead

486
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:47,680
you can't really bottle corsetin that's

487
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,920
why medical medium doesn't talk about

488
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,320
quercetin all day long because it has to

489
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,800
be in its living form

490
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,320
quercetin is is practically useless

491
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,480
actually it's useless in a

492
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,759
supplementation form on its own so

493
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,279
everybody says well i'll take my course

494
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,199
and the reason why you don't see me ever

495
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:05,120
talk about quercetin is because it

496
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:07,360
doesn't work

497
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:10,400
but when quercetin is left in its active

498
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:12,799
state in a living form in the propolis

499
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,559
the resin itself that was that was

500
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,760
designed by the bees

501
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:18,400
from

502
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:21,679
from gathering it from tree buds the the

503
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,839
quercetin is actually alive and active

504
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:26,319
and real it wasn't baked and cooked and

505
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:28,000
run through the mill

506
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:30,880
so just so you know people who love

507
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,080
corsetin or think corseton's good

508
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,600
this is the first time you're going to

509
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,679
be getting a course attendant actually

510
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,160
works even though it doesn't say corsa

511
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,760
10 it says propolis

512
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,720
it's the only place to get quercetin

513
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,960
that's active and alive

514
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,039
so that's a piece of information all in

515
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,120
its own that's mind-blowing that's

516
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:52,160
mind-blowing

517
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:54,320
in the world of health

518
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:57,039
like you know i mean

519
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,480
it's just it's just crazy how it works

520
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,480
so we got the herpes simplex we're

521
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,400
talking about that right now um clearly

522
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,080
clearly nature cool handle right there

523
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,039
on youtube good to see you can you

524
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:09,360
explain why the propylene glycol glycol

525
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:12,240
is bad because propylene glycol is

526
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:14,080
alcohol it's an industrialized alcohol

527
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,160
that's why it's bad so what it does is

528
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:19,280
it destroys the active constituents that

529
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:21,200
are actually in proplus

530
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,720
so your propolis

531
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,960
is destroyed

532
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,960
with the alcohol in it propylene glycol

533
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,120
if that's in your

534
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,320
propolis your propolis isn't living

535
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,320
anymore

536
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,160
that means your quercetin isn't living

537
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,320
anymore in there that means it's not

538
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,799
even a fraction of what it can do

539
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:41,600
that's just one the other is alcohol and

540
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:44,160
tinctures burn holes in stomachs

541
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:48,160
i've said this for years so alcohol and

542
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:50,080
tinctures burn holes in stomachs

543
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,799
irritates everything irritates the

544
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:55,280
linings irritates the nerves irritates

545
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,720
you don't see alcoholic tinctures

546
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,160
recommended by medical medium

547
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,280
information because spirit of compassion

548
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,039
told me since day one they're the worst

549
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,120
and it's why people don't heal when they

550
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,720
do herbal remedies that have alcohol in

551
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,559
them that's why they go to their next

552
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,760
naturopath and people have done this

553
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,280
stuff for years they go to another

554
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,280
naturopath another functional doctor

555
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,480
another guy another guru another healer

556
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,760
and they're taking all their teachers

557
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,480
all this alcohol in them and just

558
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,080
getting sicker

559
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,919
sicker

560
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,760
each other says vimorji is so incredible

561
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,120
they really go above and beyond for us

562
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,080
because they care about the chronically

563
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,760
ill

564
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,840
so you say i'm so grateful for them they

565
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,440
really have taken my healing to the next

566
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,919
level every time i can't wait for the

567
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,520
propolis to get here hopefully today so

568
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,799
let's talk about the herpes a little bit

569
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,960
before we get cruz in here okay um on

570
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:42,320
rumble lee says hi

571
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,840
hi lee

572
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,760
i love rumble

573
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,600
all right

574
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,000
so we're in the herpes simplex section

575
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,840
here there are many strains of mutations

576
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,600
of herpes simplex one you guys and

577
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,679
almost every single person if not every

578
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,440
single person has one strain inside

579
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,280
their liver somewhere hiding out and

580
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,360
will come out or not come out or it all

581
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,919
depends on what's going on but a lot of

582
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,200
people gather a lot more than one strain

583
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,960
that's the whole thing with herpes

584
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:10,320
simplex 1.

585
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,760
herpes simplex 1 and herpes simplex 2

586
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,600
symptoms that can arise from these

587
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,080
viruses including fatigue you can get

588
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,960
fatigue from herpes simplex 1 in your

589
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:21,440
system not even having the sore jaw pain

590
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,120
ear pain pain in the lower neck pain in

591
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,360
the lower neck pain in the upper neck

592
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,440
pain in the back of the head pain in the

593
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,480
genital area bladder pain and

594
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,640
inflammation sore throat mild fever

595
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,640
mouth sores sores on the genitals

596
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,480
adjacent areas in many cases someone is

597
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,559
actually dealing with shingles and it's

598
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,640
misdiagnosis herpes simplex one or two

599
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:42,320
but still these are all herpetic viruses

600
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,720
and in here

601
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,159
okay you'll see a protocol right here

602
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,960
and i'll give you give you a close-up on

603
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,960
this protocol right here right so

604
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,320
there's the protocol you can't see it

605
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,919
it's probably a little blurry but i'm

606
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,440
trying to show you

607
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,440
right and

608
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,159
and in this protocol

609
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:03,600
okay you'll see propolis it says five

610
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:06,240
dropper folds twice a day or dab on the

611
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:09,039
herpes source so i want to show you this

612
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,919
right okay

613
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,760
so

614
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,840
if you have a cold sore if you don't

615
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,679
have a cold sore but you but the virus

616
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,760
is creating problems and making you sick

617
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,200
that's another story right

618
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,960
but you know and i'm going to show you

619
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,039
also in the shot glass so you take the

620
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,840
paper towel and you dry off

621
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:27,919
your herpes cold sore

622
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,640
and then you put the propolis right on

623
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:32,799
the herpes cold sore right here so at

624
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,600
least you can start killing

625
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:37,919
the sore where it lies here even though

626
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,159
this the virus is still in the system so

627
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:43,600
that's why it also says take five

628
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:45,520
dropper fulls of propolis twice a day

629
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,600
twice a day so you're taking five

630
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,960
dropper fulls right here

631
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,559
okay

632
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,480
you guys people traveled around the

633
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:55,039
world to enter my office just so you

634
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:58,159
know i've been doing this for 35 years

635
00:21:55,039 --> 00:22:00,799
people traveled around the world coming

636
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:04,240
to my office

637
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:06,480
praying to god they can even talk to me

638
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,720
it was a sad situation to see that many

639
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,080
sick people people being carried into my

640
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,200
office

641
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:15,360
because they couldn't walk and

642
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,320
this information

643
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,320
okay

644
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,720
is really important i mean this could

645
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,880
change lives for so many people natalia

646
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,799
says aw what about propolis and water

647
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,480
base

648
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:28,480
doesn't work

649
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,799
for a lot of reasons

650
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,720
it goes rancid and ferments and goes

651
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,080
south

652
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,919
and that's

653
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,280
and okay first of all any propolis that

654
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,880
says it's in water-based it's just in

655
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,240
water-based is still an alcohol but

656
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,960
they're not saying it's an alcohol or

657
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,960
it's in solvents

658
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,400
that's a whole thing too unless you take

659
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,640
propolis yourself that you harvested

660
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,679
from a bee hive and then you mixed it in

661
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,280
water

662
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,640
but but but

663
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,000
that's another story and i don't think

664
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,440
that's what that is if they're selling

665
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,039
it is prolific and water-based it's not

666
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,960
purples and water-based you don't have

667
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:00,799
to disclose here's the thing you don't

668
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,880
have to disclose all the wrongs about

669
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:05,600
propolis in the world no one's keeping

670
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,520
after that that's how like

671
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,799
problematic it all is and that's why the

672
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,600
vimergy

673
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:13,280
uh people did a different thing

674
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,520
selena says what supplements would you

675
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:19,039
recommend for visual snow would it help

676
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:21,520
this condition i floaters i floaters are

677
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:23,280
a herpes virus that's what i floaters

678
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:26,480
are so it's one of the herpes family

679
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:28,240
members ebv can create the eye floaters

680
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,120
even a little bit of simplex all those

681
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,159
neurotoxins so we're we're talking about

682
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,840
that kind of thing and we're talking

683
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,640
about neurological symptoms so let's go

684
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:38,880
into this a little bit more so we're in

685
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:42,240
i want to go back to canker source for a

686
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,240
second here too okay

687
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,400
so we're in the canker sores

688
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:49,960
all right

689
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,960
canker sore viruses

690
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:54,240
and we're in here now so we're in canker

691
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,240
sores so i just want to show you

692
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,799
it says propolis for kinkosaurus three

693
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,559
dropper folds twice a day

694
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,480
so it's not just you dab it on the

695
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:04,400
kicker store you can you can dab it just

696
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:07,360
right on the canker sore if you want

697
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:09,120
you can do that but you can also do

698
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,720
three dropper holes twice a day you can

699
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,000
do the protocol now i want to give

700
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,440
everybody a little window in this when

701
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,720
you look at cleanse the heel and you're

702
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,320
learning about this and seeing the

703
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,679
protocols try not to just jump to the

704
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,919
protocols

705
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:22,640
try to read the section before the

706
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:24,720
protocols read the supplements section

707
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:27,200
like all the information the do's and

708
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,880
don'ts what to look out for the link for

709
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,400
this book is in the bio and the link for

710
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,440
this book is in the description right

711
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,679
there

712
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,919
the life-saving book it has a history

713
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:38,960
and street cred of saving lives millions

714
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:41,360
of people have it around the world

715
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,559
and amazon's selling it dirt cheap right

716
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,480
now because they

717
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:48,240
they i think they you know what i think

718
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:50,240
it's angelic intervention personally i

719
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,400
think at the same time maybe they're

720
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,720
trying to price it so low that i don't

721
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,880
i don't get my 10 cents for it but it

722
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,480
doesn't matter you can go to you can go

723
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,840
to the library and get it for free or

724
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:04,400
amazon 51 off us but the point is it's a

725
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:07,440
medical textbook critical information so

726
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,320
what about propolis mixed in honey

727
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,080
okay

728
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,600
so it's in either way if someone takes

729
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,440
propolis and they mix it in honey that

730
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,960
means there must be alcohol or solvent

731
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,760
in your honey

732
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,679
i'd rather take a propolis that doesn't

733
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,000
have a solvent or alcohol one that's

734
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,520
high grade at the highest grade possible

735
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,279
with active

736
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:29,120
polyphenols

737
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:31,360
and 120 milligrams per serving then

738
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:33,600
actually take a honey that someone

739
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,279
slapped in some alcohol and solvent

740
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,559
propolis and mixed it into a whole bunch

741
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,760
of honey

742
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:39,120
that's just something i probably

743
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,640
wouldn't want to do of course you do

744
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,960
what you want to do

745
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,080
right

746
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,880
um

747
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:50,159
lacey game says why

748
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:52,320
i can have it too much how why i it when

749
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:54,320
i have too much vitamin c it gives me

750
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,760
canker sores

751
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,760
what kind of vitamin c you have an

752
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,360
ascorbic acid

753
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,200
that's a whole other problem so let's

754
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:04,000
talk about vitamin c just for a second

755
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:06,159
because we we actually

756
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,320
i'm just looking here at this

757
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:10,159
okay so this is this is another reason

758
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,960
why vimmergy does what they do so i just

759
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:14,960
want to just run this by you guys

760
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:18,000
vimergy doesn't

761
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,760
package up ascorbic acid now i'm not

762
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,760
going to name all the brands out there

763
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,480
that have all ascorbic acid including

764
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:27,679
that one that has a packet they got the

765
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:31,760
packet so let me get my

766
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:33,039
uh urgent packet out let me get my

767
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,960
urgent

768
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:37,039
packet out

769
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:40,799
and they don't realize that urgent

770
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:43,520
packet is garbage it's straight ascorbic

771
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:45,679
acid of the cheap kind right

772
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:48,480
straight ascorbic acid you take too much

773
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:50,640
of straight ascorbic acid vitamin c and

774
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,159
yeah you will literally you could you

775
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,679
you could break out with canker swords

776
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:56,720
you could get a stomach ulcer you can

777
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:59,360
hurt your stomach right so the microc

778
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:02,480
is not ascorbic acid so it's not all

779
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:05,279
this it's not all ascorbic acid

780
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,600
then that's the difference right there

781
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:09,679
so the germ theory hoax layer which i am

782
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:12,159
honored you were here because you tend

783
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,760
to leave youtube comments like

784
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:16,720
mmm really is

785
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:18,080
stupid or mm is dumb

786
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,240
and them is

787
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:22,159
doesn't know what about anything and

788
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,480
then does it know right so i'm honored

789
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:26,320
to hear a germ theory hoax slayer

790
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,080
so you say herbal products were made

791
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,720
with alcohol for thousands of years and

792
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,640
they worked really were you there

793
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,240
because i'm i'm confused there were you

794
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,840
there thousands of years why they worked

795
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:39,360
or didn't work because everybody had a

796
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:41,200
lifespan of 35 years old back then

797
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:44,399
so i'm just curious how good did they

798
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,480
work and who even had access to them

799
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:48,960
that's what i'd like to know too right

800
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,720
and here's another thing too

801
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,720
was anybody up against the bugs we're up

802
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,640
against today no they weren't there

803
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,240
weren't any labs out there creating new

804
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,760
bugs left and right and releasing them

805
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,440
into the environment

806
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:02,640
how many strains of herpetic family

807
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:04,480
viruses were there then none

808
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,320
none so we got all these engineered

809
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,440
viruses now that are making everybody

810
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,440
sick and making everybody have

811
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:12,000
neurological symptoms

812
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:14,559
they didn't have that back then

813
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,480
that's a whole thing on its own and

814
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:18,640
try not to get confused with thousands

815
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,320
of years ago and that being like this

816
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,080
blatant statement if it means everything

817
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,640
worked a thousand years ago are you

818
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,840
kidding emperors died of mercury

819
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,760
poisoning

820
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:30,000
emperors

821
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:33,200
emperors in china

822
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,120
emperors around the world kings

823
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,360
in great britain

824
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,640
died of mercury poisoning or went insane

825
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,240
because of murky poison because they

826
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,320
used to give them all they gave all the

827
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:45,520
kings and queens and emperors

828
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:47,120
they gave all the the ruling class a

829
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,919
thousand years ago and more they gave

830
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:52,240
them mercury tonics you got sick you

831
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:54,640
were given a mercury tonic oh maybe they

832
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,960
put alcohol in there too that's great

833
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:59,440
they give you a mercury alcohol tonic

834
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:02,240
and then you went completely insane

835
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:04,000
that's actually known out there so let's

836
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,159
kind of not get confused by everything

837
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,320
so great a thousand years ago or 2 000

838
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,720
years ago

839
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,720
all right

840
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,840
thank you

841
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,799
all right let's go into this a little

842
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:20,399
bit more you guys we're talking about

843
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:22,240
cleanse the heel

844
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:24,720
right here and that leads me to the

845
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:27,039
whole copper thing too we won't go into

846
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,120
it too deep but copper vats in india a

847
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:31,200
thousand years ago to keep amoebas from

848
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,559
not filtering you know taking over the

849
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,480
water

850
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:36,880
actually helped for as far as killing

851
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,399
one amoeba but what people don't realize

852
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,320
you got copper poisoning again you died

853
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:42,480
at 50 years old or 40 years old copper

854
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,559
poisoning so it's like okay let's we

855
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,200
just got to kind of like we got to get a

856
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:49,120
grasp about how things work out there

857
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,640
got to get a grasp all right so we're in

858
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,559
canker source i'm looking at different

859
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,880
so goldenseal is an option right there

860
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:57,279
so i got the golden seal goldenseal is

861
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,640
another incredible

862
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:00,799
supplement

863
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,399
that's really important so when i when

864
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:04,399
what happens is you have to realize when

865
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:06,640
you go into like herpetic family viruses

866
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:09,760
like shingles and herpes and cold sores

867
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:12,320
and canker sores and epstein-barr

868
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:15,200
you have to have the antivirals that's a

869
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,559
big deal you have to have the antivirals

870
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,520
that's the thing

871
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:21,760
so when it comes down to that

872
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,200
if you don't have the antivirals because

873
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,640
that's what's happening with people

874
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,840
people they're dealing with all these

875
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,440
viral issues neurological problems you

876
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,600
think people just magically have a

877
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,120
neurological problem is it because of a

878
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,880
past life like why do they have a

879
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:37,200
neurological problem

880
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,120
now why do they have severe severe brain

881
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,880
fog and aches and pains their neck is

882
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,240
killing them but nothing's really wrong

883
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,720
with them why are they suffering with

884
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:47,200
burning skin and vertigo and dizziness

885
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:49,760
because they got these pathogens

886
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,360
and these pathogens are causing problems

887
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,039
so we have all these different pathogens

888
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,880
we got the herpes cold sore virus that

889
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:56,720
causes all that trigeminal neuralgia we

890
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:59,279
got the shingles virus that creates all

891
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:01,120
that trigeminal neuralgia too so these

892
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:03,200
are herpetic families they sit inside

893
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:06,240
the trigeminal nerves you guys they can

894
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:08,640
actually sit inside the brain stem

895
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:11,600
is what they do so

896
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:13,679
what we're doing right now is we're

897
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:16,720
talking about

898
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:18,640
ways to deal with that now part of my

899
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,760
time is teaching doctors just so you

900
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:23,840
know okay

901
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,840
so part of my time is teaching doctors

902
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,440
so i have conversations with doctors on

903
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:31,519
the phone okay

904
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,399
and in meetings

905
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:34,320
about

906
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:35,519
why people are sick

907
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,799
so they're learning now and they're

908
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,960
learning more and more about these

909
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:40,960
neurological conditions the brain stem

910
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:43,360
inflaming and doctors didn't know your

911
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,600
brain stem can get inflamed

912
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,360
that's actually recently as far as i'm

913
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,880
teaching doctors that stuff i've tried

914
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:51,760
to teach that throughout the years about

915
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:53,679
the vagus nerves brain stem right but

916
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,519
it's kind of brand new for everybody

917
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:57,519
when your brain stem is inflamed and

918
00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:00,320
your vagus nerve is inflamed and your

919
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:02,080
vestibular nerves inflamed and facial

920
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:04,080
nerves inflamed all these are inflamed

921
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,360
all these cranial nerves you get all

922
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,440
these problems you get the ticks and

923
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,840
spasms and the aches and pains and the

924
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,279
jabbing pain and the popping in the ear

925
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,120
and the ringing in the ear and the

926
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:14,799
dizziness and you get the balance issues

927
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,720
in the tight tightened chest where you

928
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:18,399
can't breathe

929
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,600
you just can't breathe you don't know

930
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:21,600
what it is and you don't know if you're

931
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,840
having anxiety attack or not these are

932
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,039
inflamed nerves right

933
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,240
and that's what they are if you guys

934
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:27,919
just came on here talking about

935
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,440
neurological symptoms now we covered

936
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:31,120
canker sores please watch this from the

937
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,640
beginning when you get a chance covered

938
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,880
what to do with canker sores and cold

939
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,159
source and herpes simplex cold sores

940
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,760
so and we're talking about

941
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:39,200
supplementation what you see in front of

942
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,120
me is vemorgy products that i'm not

943
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,399
sponsored so this isn't the kind of

944
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,799
thing where it's just the best stuff

945
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:46,640
that's out there so if i was to hide the

946
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:48,159
best stuff that was out there and didn't

947
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,600
want to show it how would anybody

948
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:52,240
actually get

949
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:54,480
like that chance to actually really heal

950
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,880
in so many ways let's cover shingles a

951
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,640
little bit shingles likes to sit

952
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,240
in the spinal nerves it likes to sit in

953
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:03,120
the sciatic nerve it likes to sit in the

954
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,720
lumbar so people have a lot of shingles

955
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,120
viruses there's different varieties over

956
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,960
30 varieties of shingles viruses right

957
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:11,039
shingles will create a lot of problems

958
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,039
like that neuropathy issue

959
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:14,320
plantar fasciitis

960
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:16,960
neuropathy

961
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:18,159
pain down the leg piriformis issues a

962
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,399
lot of people out there they'll have

963
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:22,399
piriformis problems right they'd be like

964
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:24,880
i don't know what it is but i just can't

965
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:27,120
i can't do anything i can't walk right i

966
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,640
got this piriformis problem these are

967
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,720
all nerves that get inflamed by the

968
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:33,279
shingles virus right there a lot of

969
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,559
people have the epstein bar and shingles

970
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:37,200
and people who are sick with like

971
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:39,279
neurological lyme and ms and a lot of in

972
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,440
lupus and they have all these sets of

973
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:42,880
symptoms they get the vertigo one day

974
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,279
they get the ringing in the ears they

975
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,799
get the back pain they get the tingles

976
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:49,120
and numbness they get the tightness of

977
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:51,279
the chest they got more than just one

978
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,120
bug they'll have an epstein bar and a

979
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:56,080
shingles

980
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:58,080
it's mm school today

981
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:00,559
so they'll have epsine bar they'll have

982
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:02,399
shingles they might have a simplex so

983
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,919
here's what happens people walk around

984
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:06,000
and they'll have one or two simplex

985
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:07,519
viruses they'll have that are sitting

986
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,280
inside their trigeminal nerve they'll

987
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,960
have an epstein bar they'll have maybe

988
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,280
two epstein bars they'll have a shingles

989
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:16,079
virus and to boot they might even have a

990
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,919
cytomegalovirus or an hhv6 and sometimes

991
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:19,440
these viruses move up and people have

992
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:21,839
problems and sometimes these viruses

993
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,280
move down and they they survive

994
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:25,520
meaning like they get through their day

995
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,359
but but it's this ebb and flow of this

996
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,359
immune system thing and that's why it's

997
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:32,320
critical that for instance like that

998
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:34,159
propolis is such a breakthrough

999
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:37,280
so kelly says i have shingles now what

1000
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,280

1001
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:40,480

1003
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,399

1004
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:46,480

varieties of shingles all but one

1059
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:40,160
undiscovered seath shingles chapter in

1060
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,240
medical medium book i was just showing

1061
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:44,079
you too now there's

1062
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:46,560
a supplement protocol right there just

1063
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,560
so you know

1064
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:51,440
and i'm in there

1065
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:53,280
okay so let's go over let's go over it a

1066
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,720
little bit so it says fresh celery juice

1067
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,000
is one thing it says right there in the

1068
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,920
protocol

1069
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,240
so

1070
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,640
i got a celery juice right here there's

1071
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:04,320
one right here fresh celery juice that's

1072
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,400
in the protocol now understand you don't

1073
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,880
have to do full protocols in here you

1074
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:11,280
can customize medical medium information

1075
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,839
isn't one size fits all it's an answer

1076
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,920
to why we're sick but you can do what's

1077
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:17,359
what you feel like you can do you can

1078
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,599
take your healing as far as you want to

1079
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:21,359
go but here's why everybody's so

1080
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:23,040
different besides the fact that their

1081
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:24,880
souls are different and unique

1082
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:27,200
everybody's soul is unique another

1083
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,960
reason why people are unique is someone

1084
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,320
may have two or three viruses of a

1085
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,079
different kind another person may have

1086
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,599
only one another person may have a whole

1087
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:35,599
bunch of streptococcus another person

1088
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:37,280
may have heavy metals and that another

1089
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:39,280
person may have one type of metal not

1090
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,320
the other it goes on forever and ever

1091
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,000
and ever

1092
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,680
is different varieties of bugs different

1093
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,839
varieties of metals different varieties

1094
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,680
of toxins and then what happens is

1095
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:50,079
everybody's got a mix of all this stuff

1096
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:52,400
a whole hush pasha mix about with all

1097
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:54,560
this stuff okay and different viruses

1098
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,320
have different aggression too so

1099
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,240
everybody's different with what's ailing

1100
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,640
them so you can customize and go as far

1101
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,240
as you need to go so in the shingles

1102
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,079
chapter right here

1103
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:06,000
it says aloe vera is something you can

1104
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:08,400
take two or more inches a fresh gel

1105
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,920
removed cat's claw is another one so

1106
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,400
let's look for the cat's claw i was just

1107
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,320
grabbing the wrong one right there so

1108
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:17,280
i think we got the cat's claw somewhere

1109
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,280
or it's over here

1110
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:21,440
got the cat's claw right here okay so

1111
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:23,440
i'll give you a close-up on the cat's

1112
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,839
claw

1113
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,440
cat's claw okay

1114
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:29,040
is make or break for somebody with

1115
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,800
neurological line

1116
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:33,280
that's make or break

1117
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:35,520
that's an important one right there

1118
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:37,119
someone's really suffering okay that's

1119
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,040
the vimorgy cat's claw though there's a

1120
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:42,320
difference if you run out you go by a

1121
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:44,160
cat's claw i can't say yeah okay yeah

1122
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,599
could help a little maybe not so i'll

1123
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:48,000
show you guys on tick tock right that's

1124
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:50,240
a cat's claw okay

1125
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,240
so

1126
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,000
let's see here

1127
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,119
so i'm backing guys

1128
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,359
so all right i showed you the cat's claw

1129
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,119
so back in the shingles right here says

1130
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:16,079
cats call it two dropper foals twice a

1131
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:17,520
day so two dropper folds twice a day and

1132
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:18,880
you got your little shot glass right

1133
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,880
here you can put your dropper holes

1134
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:25,560
right in the shot glass you can probably

1135
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:25,560
catch this on a close-up right here

1136
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:41,000
okay we got a close-up right there

1137
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:47,359
so i just did two dropper folds you add

1138
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,800
a little bit of water

1139
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:50,079
and then you got it in your shot glass

1140
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,680
so i just showed you guys right here in

1141
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:53,520
tick tock right

1142
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:57,079
okay

1143
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,079
and there it is

1144
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,320
so

1145
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:02,800
i'm giving an example now if you if you

1146
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,480
read this chapter you'll see before for

1147
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,839
all the protocols you'll see hey you can

1148
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,480
start with just a couple of different

1149
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:11,280
things you can start with b12

1150
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:13,599
to give yourself then the nerve food i

1151
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:16,240
call it like nerve food central nervous

1152
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:17,599
system needs the b12 so that's something

1153
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:20,400
you can start with right there where

1154
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:22,160
it's b12 all on its own if you look in

1155
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:25,280
the shingle section

1156
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:27,839
right you'll see b12 three dropper folds

1157
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:29,839
twice a day so a lot of people have that

1158
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:31,200
sciatic nerve pain they have that

1159
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:33,760
different the different neurological

1160
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:36,079
symptoms so it's critical that the b12

1161
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,839
gets in their system right so you can

1162
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:39,760
take it slow you can literally take it

1163
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:41,200
with some salt you can take celery juice

1164
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,800
you can start with that you can work

1165
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,800
your way up you can work your way up in

1166
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:47,200
dosages you can start with a small

1167
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,960
amount of b12 it says three dropper

1168
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:51,119
falls twice a day you can start with a

1169
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:53,119
small amount you can customize it and

1170
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:55,119
work to where you're at and build

1171
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:56,960
yourself up that's how incredible it is

1172
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:59,280
what's the name of the book

1173
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:01,359
it's called cleanse the heel right here

1174
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,040
that's the name all right medical medium

1175
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:04,560
cleanse the heel

1176
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:08,079
it's a medical textbook get it free at

1177
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:10,960
the library or amazon.com 51 off it's

1178
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:12,640
only 16 there in the us

1179
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,880
and we're doing protocols watch this

1180
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,960
from the beginning too someone said uh

1181
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:19,680
the b12 is life changing you take in

1182
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:21,920
michelle l says i take a lot of b12 i

1183
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:25,119
take a lot of b12 too you're on uh

1184
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,240
you're on twitch incredible

1185
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:29,200
so

1186
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:31,040
i take a lot of b12 too i do i take i

1187
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,480

00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,000
day sometimes i'll take two dropper

1189
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,760
fulls twice a day

1190
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,280
rennes says that cleanse the heel is

1191
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,599
your bible

1192
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:41,680
i'm honored that's

1193
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:43,680
quite serious

1194
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:45,280
so jackie says i love the b12 right

1195
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,720
there too you can't wait to try the

1196
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,720
alisa henry says can't wait to try the

1197
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,599
propolis so you guys we're talking about

1198
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,440
shingles we're talking about

1199
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:53,680
neurological symptoms we're talking

1200
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,760
about herpes simplex canker sores herpes

1201
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:57,280
simplex one two talk about all the

1202
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,280
different symptoms people are dealing

1203
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:01,280
with so what happens is right now the

1204
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,640
neurological symptoms are exploding and

1205
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,160
everybody's just filing into their

1206
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:06,160
doctor's offices with the tightness of

1207
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:08,240
the chest they can't breathe right the

1208
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:10,480
pain the dizziness the burning skin the

1209
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,680
jaw pain the neck pain the back pain the

1210
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,760
fatigue

1211
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,599
and also like the brain fox all these

1212
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,200
neurological symptoms so we're talking

1213
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,240
about like game changers that's the

1214
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,720
propolis

1215
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:22,240
that's the new like the new game changer

1216
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,079
it's a whole new level there's no

1217
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,920
propolis out there like that i'm not

1218
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:28,160
sponsored just talking about that it's

1219
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:30,480
talking about how ascorbic acid the

1220
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:32,640
vitamin c from vimergy is not ascorbic

1221
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:34,079
acid how ascorbic acid can burn a hole

1222
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,839
in people's stomach like make them feel

1223
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:38,480
really sick in their stomach

1224
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:40,079
or trigger something else like trigger

1225
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,480
off a canker sore or something because

1226
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:45,440
it's so acidic it just eats away the

1227
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:48,160
linings right so that's why i don't like

1228
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:49,680
ascorbic acid vitamin c so a lot of

1229
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,599
people will make a mistake and they'll

1230
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:54,560
take just straight ascorbic acid vitamin

1231
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:56,640
c whether it's in that that you know

1232
00:42:54,560 --> 00:43:00,000
other other varieties too where they mix

1233
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:02,079
fat lipids in it which is a bad idea all

1234
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
of it either way it's not great and it's

1235
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,920
hard on the system

1236
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,200
so we're going i'm going through here

1237
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,720
shingles a little bit more because

1238
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,000
people have shingles more than they know

1239
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:12,400
and they have problems more than they

1240
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,680
know because of shingles right so i'm

1241
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,520
going into a couple other things

1242
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,839
licorice root that's another big one

1243
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:19,520
right there licorice root is an

1244
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:20,880
important one so i'll show you right

1245
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:23,760
here close up

1246
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,720
and the licorice root

1247
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:27,599
now

1248
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:30,480
licorice root and viruses don't get

1249
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:33,760
along so what happens is licorice root

1250
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:36,000
tends to get viruses sluggish and docile

1251
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:38,040
and they can't handle licorice root the

1252
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,720
phytochemical compounds

1253
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:42,800
intoxicate viruses the ones that are in

1254
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:44,560
licorice root so that's why it's a great

1255
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,720
antiviral

1256
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,920
and that's why it's really helpful for

1257
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,599
all kinds of different things that we

1258
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:52,000
deal with that are neurological symptoms

1259
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:53,520
and viral symptoms neurological lyme i

1260
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,560
see neurological line but here's the

1261
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,640
irony

1262
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:58,800
if you go to a lyme doctor which is

1263
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:00,560
tingles and numbness

1264
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,960
and a little fatigue and brain fog

1265
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:05,599
you're walking out with a lime patch on

1266
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,839
your back like a lime sticker on your

1267
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:09,839
on your hand a lime bracelet a lime

1268
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:11,839
diagnosis whatever you're going to be

1269
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:13,920
walking out of the lyme doctor's office

1270
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:15,920
with a lyme diagnosis so if you go into

1271
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,960
a lyme doctor's office all you need is

1272
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,000
just

1273
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,920
fatigue

1274
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,800
tingles and numbness if you go this is

1275
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:26,000
he was really crazy too if you go into a

1276
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:27,359
gynecologist's office

1277
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,359
and you go in there with fatigue and

1278
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:30,880
brain fog you'll walk out with a pcos

1279
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:33,280
diagnosis even if they didn't find

1280
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:35,040
fluid-filled cysts in your ovaries

1281
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:37,520
you'll walk out with pcos i mean it all

1282
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:39,359
depends on what they specialize in

1283
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:41,040
two that's how crazy that is if you walk

1284
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:42,720
into a multiple sclerosis doctor's

1285
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,079
office then you've got tingles and

1286
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,680
numbness and aches and pains and

1287
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:48,079
dizziness and vertigo you're walking out

1288
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:49,920
with an ms diagnosis

1289
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:52,160
i mean that that's that's also you know

1290
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,359
like so when i say neurological line

1291
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,200
people walk around with all the

1292
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:57,760
neurological lyme symptoms all day long

1293
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:59,440
they got back pain they got leg pain

00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,960
weakness in the limbs

1296
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:04,560
they got confusion they got brain fog

1297
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,000
they're walking around with neurological

1298
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,839
lyme dye you know like all they have to

1299
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,440
do is just bump into a lime doctor and

1300
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:11,359
on the subway

1301
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:13,839
you got lyme disease

1302
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:16,400
really what's happening is no

1303
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:18,800
you have low grade viral infections

1304
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:21,119
or higher grade viral infections

1305
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:23,359
chronic viral infections bacterial

1306
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:25,359
infections too like streptococcus can

1307
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:27,359
add to it but mostly the viral

1308
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:30,160
infections the trigeminal neuralgia

1309
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:32,960
viruses the back pain viruses all the

1310
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:35,520
shingles all the herpes all the ebv

1311
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:37,599
stuff cindy reeves says is propolis good

1312
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,960
for tinnitus if i had tinnitus i'd be

1313
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:40,720
taking propolis if i had any

1314
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:43,520
neurological symptom i would be taking

1315
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:44,880
propolis definitely okay

1316
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,640
that's what i would be doing that's the

1317
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:49,680
licorice right there but if i had

1318
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:51,119
tinnitus yeah i would take propyl so

1319
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:53,359
now if you look in cleanse of healing

1320
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:56,000
you don't see propolis in a lot of the

1321
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:57,839
symptoms and conditions right list one

1322
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,640
reason is because the propolises that

1323
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:02,319
have been out there they're hard on

1324
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:04,560
people who are really sensitive so i

1325
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:07,280
only had to use them where i had to use

1326
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:09,440
them where i had to use them i recommend

1327
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:10,800
them but now that there's a propolis

1328
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,640
that i don't have to worry about

1329
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,400
sensitivities for people now it's just

1330
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:16,240
like whoa yeah anybody with the

1331
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,960
neurological autoimmune all of it

1332
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:20,319
propolis is fantastic for right

1333
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,560
so yeah

1334
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:24,319
this is all important information

1335
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:25,520
so if you if you i could give you a

1336
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:27,119
quick rundown on some of the

1337
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:28,720
supplementation here right i talked

1338
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:30,880
about the vitamin c a little bit this is

1339
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:32,720
the ly scene right here okay

1340
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:35,760
so high quality all i seen is great for

1341
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:37,440
viruses too andy and anthony good handle

1342
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,920
i'm frustrated with all the different

1343
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:41,520
diagnoses tests appointments and all the

1344
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,040
different medications and i don't blame

1345
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:45,200
you one bit

1346
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:46,319
i wish i just had one answer and one

1347
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,640
solution

1348
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:50,800
i could completely understand a lot of

1349
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:53,920
people have gone to 10 or 20 doctors and

1350
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:56,240
50 doctors and it's what i saw all day

1351
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:59,839
every day for seven days a week in my

1352
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:01,520
office back years ago for decades it's

1353
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:03,440
people that went to 50 doctors again

1354
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,960
remember people don't go and see the

1355
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,160
medical medium

1356
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,920
because

1357
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:09,760
because for whatever reason they go

1358
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,560
because they've actually exhausted every

1359
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,920
other

1360
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,280
angle and

1361
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,720
bent have rather docked around the

1362
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,720
planet i mean why would you see the

1363
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:19,040
medical medium unless you weren't

1364
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:20,559
desperate i mean people billionaires and

1365
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:22,400
wealthy people around the globe flying

1366
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:24,559
their private jets to try to get a

1367
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:27,119
chance to talk to me because they had

1368
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:29,440
the best doctors in the world to see but

1369
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:31,119
they still couldn't get better and so

1370
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:33,200
that's when you go and knock on the

1371
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:34,800
medical mediums door

1372
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,400
right i mean that's and it's also why i

1373
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,559
get so much hate it's like i gotta kick

1374
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:40,800
me sign on the on my back because of

1375
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:42,319
that michelle l says labels aren't

1376
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,960
answers and that's the thing if you get

1377
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:46,559
a fibromyalgia diagnosis it's not really

1378
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,559
a diagnosis

1379
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:49,920
it's a label that someone else will give

1380
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:51,760
you but someone else might give you a

1381
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:53,839
lupus one someone else might give you an

1382
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:56,000
autoimmune one someone else might give

1383
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:57,760
you a lime one it's just exactly what

1384
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,160
they but really what's happening is you

1385
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:02,720
have these low-grade viral infections

1386
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:04,079

00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:33,839
so lysine's right here so that's an

1468
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:36,000
option nettle leaf is a good one too so

1469
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:38,319
then we got the nettle leaf right

1470
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,480
so nettle leaf is a great

1471
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:41,839
herb as well so what i love about nettle

1472
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:44,000
leaf it has anti-inflammatory

1473
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:45,280
phytochemical compounds

1474
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,680
and

1475
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:49,440
even though it's probably not out there

1476
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:51,359
yet or maybe they finally talked about

1477
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:53,839
it out there but it's anti-viral on a

1478
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:54,960
mild level but i love nettle leaf

1479
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:57,359
because it's incredible for the

1480
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:59,280
reproductive system so i want to go into

00:50:57,359 --> 00:51:00,559

1489
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:16,720
be in this next you know five years so

1490
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:18,240
it's going to be a massive problem

1491
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,520
and and you're going to see more and

1492
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:21,440
more and

1493
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:23,359
junky hair skin nail supplements just

1494
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:25,200
don't work they never did

1495
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:26,880
they never will they're just kind of

1496
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,839
like one of that stuff where you see

1497
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:30,319
hair

1498
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:32,559
skin nails and then as a woman you're

1499
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:34,480
like well i don't like my hair right now

1500
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:36,160
i don't like my skin right now and i

1501
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:38,559
don't like my nails right now so i'm

1502
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:39,920
gonna buy that hair skin nail supplement

1503
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:41,640
so that's how they do it it's an

1504
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:43,440
industry designed on

1505
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:45,599
psychologically

1506
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:47,520
trying to crack women that's what it is

1507
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:49,599
so the hair skin nail supplements are

1508
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:51,520
it's just it's just rigged it's rigged

1509
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:53,599
to just gaslight women that's what hair

1510
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:57,599
skin nail supplements have always been

1511
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:59,839
it's just a total gas lighting right so

1512
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:03,040
and this is what they've always done

1513
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:04,800
but what's happening is if you really

1514
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:06,480
understand hair loss or hair thinning

1515
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:08,400

00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:13,359
if you understand i'm going to go into

1519
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:15,440

okay so

1564
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:41,839
there's a lot of people a lot of women

1565
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:43,119
that come into the medical medium

1566
00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:45,280
community and don't know it but they're

1567
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:47,359
about to lose their hair

1568
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:48,400
okay they had something happen in their

1569
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:50,079
life

1570
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:52,559
like they had something happen in the

1571
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:55,200
last nine months like severe stress over

1572
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:57,920
the plague we just went through

1573
00:53:55,200 --> 00:54:00,319
maybe they caught a flu

1574
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:01,520
like four months ago and don't realize

1575
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:03,920
it but they're gonna get the hair

1576
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:04,800
thinning and hair loss later on

1577
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,800
okay

1578
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,920
a lot of women also have then maybe they

1579
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:09,520
have

1580
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:12,480
a stressful moment

1581
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:14,960
betrayal a relationship breakup

1582
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:18,240
relationship breakups are

1583
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:19,520
infamous for hair thinning afterwards

1584
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:21,839
childbirth

1585
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:23,359
right a lot of women they give birth to

1586
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:24,800
a child

1587
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:27,119
three months later they're losing all

1588
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:28,319
their hair now if they for some reason

1589
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:29,760
just got into the medical medium

1590
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:31,680
community and started drinking celery

1591
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:33,440
juice for the first time

1592
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:34,880
they'd be like oh my god is my hair

1593
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:37,200
thinning because i just drank celery

1594
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:40,000
juice hair thinning happens when

1595
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:42,160
something in your life a year before was

1596
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,680
involved or nine months before and if

1597
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:45,760
you're coming into medical medium and

1598
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:48,160
you're doing things you're slowing down

1599
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:49,119
the hair loss and you're saving your

1600
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,799
hair

1601
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:52,960
that's why so many people who are in the

1602
00:54:50,799 --> 00:54:55,119
medical meeting community with hair loss

1603
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:56,880
right women they actually get their hair

1604
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:58,400
back if they stick with the protocols

1605
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,920
and they work on it

1606
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:01,119
so

1607
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:02,880
right here

1608
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:04,640
okay we're in hair thinning and hair

1609
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:07,119
loss and you see ashwagandha three

1610
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:09,680
dropper folds twice a day

1611
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:12,079
and that's the vimergy ashwagandha so

1612
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:14,000
that's that's the best one out there

1613
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:16,000
okay it's only one i trust because

1614
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,000
ashwagandhas are filled with toxic heavy

1615
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,920
metals lots of heavy metals so

1616
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,880
ashwagandha supplements are loaded with

1617
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:22,880
metals

1618
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:24,400
and i can't trust any of them

1619
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,359
and metals is just one thing they're

1620
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,599
loaded with they're loaded with

1621
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:29,440
fungicides so what i've noticed by

1622
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:31,119
buying all the different ashwagandhas

1623
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:34,240
from the best companies out there and

1624
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:36,240
trying them i tasted fungicide

1625
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:37,920
isn't that interesting

1626
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:39,760
fungicide that means all the

1627
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:41,680
ashwagandhas out there were highly

1628
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:42,880
sprayed with fungicides and then bottled

1629
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:44,960
up

1630
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:46,640
vimergy is the only one

1631
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:49,119
that wasn't sprayed with the fungicides

1632
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:51,359
like all that heavy fungicide so i don't

1633
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:53,440
taste fungicide when i'm using

1634
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:55,680
ashwagandha

1635
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:57,280
so just letting you know so

1636
00:55:55,680 --> 00:56:00,720
anyway when it comes down to hair loss

1637
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:03,040
ashwagandha helps the adrenals

1638
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:05,680
and when it's hair thinning

1639
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:06,640
a stagnant sluggish liver

1640
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:09,599
right

1641
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:11,839
along with adrenal problems

1642
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:15,359
when you meet you're missing

1643
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:18,640
critical hormones in the adrenal glands

1644
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:21,760
hair starts to fall out

1645
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:24,480
and so ashwagandha helps to restore the

1646
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:28,240
adrenal glands in women

1647
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:30,960
that missing hormonally start to lose

1648
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:32,880
and when they start to lose that

1649
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:35,119
they end up

1650
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:37,760
losing everything else they lose their

1651
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:40,000
hair they lose other things too

1652
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,000
so

1653
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:45,839
he's not sponsored someone's saying uh

1654
00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:47,680
affiliate affiliate marketing i'm not

1655
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:49,520
sponsored so let's go back into that a

1656
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:51,359
little bit i don't own the vimergy

1657
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:52,720
company i'm not sponsored i'm not an

1658
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:54,960
ambassador

1659
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:56,559
okay so i'm just letting you know and i

1660
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:59,200

1661
00:56:56,559 --> 00:57:01,440
i buy them i order i just ordered a

1662
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:03,040
bunch of propolis

1663
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:04,319
but i ordered a few more bottles because

1664
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,760
i try not to order too much because i'm

1665
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:07,760
worried about it going out of stock and

1666
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:10,319
then somebody with chronic illness

1667
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:12,720
needs to buy up a propolis and all of a

1668
00:57:10,319 --> 00:57:13,760
sudden you know whatever so i'm and and

1669
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:15,520
if you look if you're dealing with

1670
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:17,680
symptoms you should stock up on it so

1671
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:20,160
you have it so you're not out of it so

1672
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:22,640
make sure so i got a couple of a bottle

1673
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:24,079
so i hope you guys got enough of it

1674
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:26,160
anyway

1675
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:28,000
so when it comes down to ash ashwagandha

1676
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:29,920
i want to go into that a little bit so

1677
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,400
what ashwagandha does is it helps to

1678
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:34,160
restore the balance

1679
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:36,079
in the adrenals so dr

1680
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:38,559
epinephrine is not your only hormone in

1681
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:40,640
your adrenals

1682
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:42,640
that's not your only hormone

1683
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:44,720
so it's not like okay what boom we just

1684
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:47,200
have adrenaline is complex right there's

1685
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:49,359
a lot of different blends of adrenaline

1686
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:51,440
and so hair loss once those adrenals

1687
00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:53,280
start to drop down and break down you

1688
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:55,839
end up with a hair loss because you're

1689
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:58,720
losing critical hormones

1690
00:57:55,839 --> 00:58:01,440
adrenals even produce some estrogen

1691
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:02,960
right they produce that so you're losing

1692
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:04,880
these different hormones in the adrenal

1693
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:06,559
glands when we go through stress and

1694
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:08,240
everything else so a relationship break

1695
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:09,920
up something bad happens or do you just

1696
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:11,520
been through a sickness

1697
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:13,280
and you end up losing hair so

1698
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:14,559
ashwagandha is critical so that's just

1699
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:16,079
one right there and i'm just showing you

1700
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:18,640
hair thinning and hair loss the

1701
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:19,760
ashwagandha right here

1702
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:20,960
hell glue

1703
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:22,640
so there's a lot of there's a lot of

1704
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:24,240
different things um

1705
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:27,119

1707
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:32,319

1708
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:35,119
sets of energy msm right there

1709
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:38,079
and for hair loss it says one capsule

1710
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:40,720
daily right there one capsule daily

1711
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:43,520
so you'll see out there hair skin nail

1712
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:45,680
supplements but they don't have things

1713
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:47,839
that are critical for hair building for

1714
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:49,599

right so i'm going to show you three

1716
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:53,760
critical things for bringing back hair

1717
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,799
msm

1718
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:56,480
right

1719
00:58:54,799 --> 00:58:58,720
nettle leaf let me show you three

1720
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:00,960
critical things

1721
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:01,920
and ashwagandha

1722
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:06,000
three

1723
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:07,839
critical pieces for bringing back hair

1724
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,319
right there

1725
00:59:07,839 --> 00:59:10,319
these three

1726
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:15,760
and

1727
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:17,359
the msm that just came out from bimrg is

1728
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:19,760
really incredible it's got the silica in

1729
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:22,319
it the whole bit carrie says vimergy

1730
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:23,680
supplements are game changing i hear it

1731
00:59:22,319 --> 00:59:25,599
all the time you're on facebook awesome

1732
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:27,599
i hear i hear it all the time it's like

1733
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:29,119
i stopped using my vimorgy i got another

1734
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:31,680
brand or i got another thing and all of

1735
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:33,280
a sudden things started changing

1736
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:35,920
so rosalie

1737
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:38,720
cac says i take organic ashwagandha

1738
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:40,319
organic ashwagandha doesn't mean it

1739
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:43,200
doesn't have the fungicides i've

1740
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:44,880
purchased all the organic ashwagandhas

1741
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:46,400
that's the whole point i purchased them

1742
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:48,480
from all the different companies

1743
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:50,640
from all the different places the best

1744
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:51,520
companies and the best known brands

1745
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,319
okay

1746
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:54,319
and

1747
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:55,920
it doesn't mean the quality is there for

1748
00:59:54,319 --> 00:59:57,839
other reasons and i still tasted

1749
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:59,680
fungicide so i think the whole

1750
00:59:57,839 --> 01:00:01,119
ashwagandha world you can have it it's

1751
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:03,359
great to have an organic one with

1752
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:06,160
ashwagandha but it's not everything when

1753
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:08,079
it comes down to ashwagandha because

1754
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:09,760
of that fungicide

1755
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:10,559
that i taste it that's the whole thing

1756
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:12,000
too

1757
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:13,200
so

1758
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,240
anyway

1759
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:16,240
when it comes down to

1760
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:19,520
and another thing too what you're going

1761
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,319
to say well here's the thing what people

1762
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:21,760
say

1763
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:23,760
it happens all the time i try to

1764
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:26,559
amendment doesn't work for me and they

1765
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:28,400
didn't even have the right stuff

1766
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:30,000
they didn't have the right type of b12

1767
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:32,880
they had cya cobalamin they didn't have

1768
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,400
adenosine volume and methylcobalamin

1769
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:35,920
so their meanwhile their neurological

1770
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:37,839
symptoms aren't showing any prove

1771
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:39,599
improvement and they're like i tried mmm

1772
01:00:37,839 --> 01:00:42,319
really because you didn't use adenosine

1773
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:44,720
cobalamin and methylcobalamin combined

1774
01:00:42,319 --> 01:00:46,640
or really good one right so it's these

1775
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:48,319
things that matter you know you know

1776
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:50,079
it's like oh i tried propolis it didn't

1777
01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:52,240
work oh really well you tried one with

1778
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:53,440
alcohol and solvents in it and it wasn't

1779
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:55,440
active

1780
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:56,640
so there's differences here that's

1781
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:57,839
that's why the medical medium

1782
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:59,760
information

1783
01:00:57,839 --> 01:01:00,799
is is different than other people out

1784
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:02,720
there so

1785
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:05,920
people say i tried i tried celery juice

1786
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:07,520
they tried eight ounces for a week

1787
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:09,200
i tried the heavy metal detox and they

1788
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:10,880
had chlorella and charcoal in their

1789
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:12,400
heavy metal detox

1790
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:14,559
because someone's like

1791
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:16,079
you need charcoal you need you know

1792
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:17,440
chlorella you need whatever and they're

1793
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:19,200
like i tried the heavy metal thing and

1794
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:21,280
then they just what it is i'm an easy

1795
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:22,200
target easy target to be picked on and i

1796
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:24,559
get it because it's called

1797
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:26,480
discrimination because i hear a voice

1798
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:28,000
and i understand that i accepted that at

1799
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:30,720
age four

1800
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,839
then it's not my my first rodeo with

1801
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:34,079
like

1802
01:01:31,839 --> 01:01:36,000
all of it with discrimination so it

1803
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:37,440
happens when you hear a voice

1804
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,200
and that voice tells you what's wrong

1805
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:40,799
with people and what they need or what

1806
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,920
they what's wrong what's happening

1807
01:01:40,799 --> 01:01:43,599
what's wrong with the industry and

1808
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:45,760
everything else right and then you

1809
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:47,280
provide that information and it's just

1810
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:49,359
like just like

1811
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:51,599
people just can't handle it

1812
01:01:49,359 --> 01:01:53,359
